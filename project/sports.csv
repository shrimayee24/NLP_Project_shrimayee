#INDvsNZ: Rohit Sharma and Co. Need to Stop Playing On Raging Turners At Home

That beautiful June afternoon in Barbados now seems a million miles away. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli - the two best Indian batters of this generation - had just realized their long-cherished dream of winning a World Cup together. Immediately after India's title-winning run, they proceeded to announce their T20 retirements in a span of half-an-hour, but you could see both were hopeful about a bright couple of years ahead in the other two formats.Just five months on, though, the cutthroat quality of international cricket has reminded the two champions that life can be cruel. Little did they know on June 29 that India would be departing for the five-Test series in Australia with little or no hope of making the World Test Championship final, and that there would be serious question marks over their futures.From a World Cup-winning captain, Rohit has now become the first Indian skipper to suffer a whitewash at home in Tests. Virat is in the middle of a most dismal year in red-ball cricket, with 250 runs from six games at an average of 22.72.Virat turned 36 on Tuesday and it's an age when a tour of Australia can be really challenging. We have seen some great careers coming to an end in Australia - from Dilip Vengsarkar and VVS Laxman to Rahul Dravid - and all those who have loved the Delhi cricketer for so long wouldn't want a similar story to pan out over the next couple of months.Former India captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth, who also finished his Test career in Australia in 1992, is hopeful that Virat will weather the storm. ""The best thing about Virat is the determination and the hunger to achieve more. Add to that his enviable record in Australia and I think he will bounce back strongly from this debacle against New Zealand,"" Srikkanth told TOI.Virat's first Test century came in Adelaide during the 2011-12 series and since then, the modern master has added five more to his kitty Down Under. ""The bounce from the pitches in Australia isn't something that should bother Virat. In fact, he is probably at his best against the short ball, and the fact that he is extremely fit gives him a good chance to succeed,"" Srikkanth said, adding that he believes Virat still has a couple of years of Test cricket left in him.The situation, probably, isn't as straight forward for Rohit. Just 91 runs from three Tests against New Zealand is as bad as it can be, and it's the nature of dismissals that's going to worry the skipper more than anything else.It's the pacers who dismissed Rohit four out of six times in the New Zealand series where spinners called all the shots barring the first innings in Bengaluru. The way he was hurried on to mistiming his favourite pull-shot in both the innings at Wankhede would surely leave the right-hander a worried man going to Australia.While Srikkanth said on his YouTube channel that Rohit may pull the curtains down on his Test career if he doesn't do well in Australia, he went into a deeper analysis of what the captain needs to do as a batter if he has to succeed in the Border Gavaskar Trophy .""I also had a similar batting style to Rohit, I mean a bit of a dasher. What experience taught me is that even if you are an attacking opener, it is important to give yourself a little more time in the middle, especially in Australia, before going for the shots,"" Srikkanth, who was the chairman of selectors when the 2011-12 debacle in Australia happened, said.What complicates things just a little more for Rohit is that he is the captain of the side. If the team doesn't do well, all the pressure will come on him and the Australians will look to feed on that. They will look to keep the captain down because that can pull the entire Indian team down, a thing that Rohit has to guard against. Sunil Gavaskar, in fact, has suggested that if Rohit doesn't lead the team in the first Test due to personal reasons, the captaincy for the entire series should be given to Jasprit Bumrah Srikkanth didn't want to get into that debate, but he wants Rohit to be cautious about the fact that ""your strength can sometimes turn into your weakness in Australia"".""The Aussies have seen that Rohit isn't at his best with the pull shot early on in his innings. They are going to bowl slightly short at a good pace on bouncy tracks to Rohit, asking him to go for his favourite stroke. All Rohit needs to do is to be slightly careful and he has the talent to manage it from there,"" Srikkanth said.That's what all of us want. It's on Rohit and Virat to justify the belief and keep the Indian flag flying Down Under.","Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli will probably feature on their last tour of Australia.

Virat & Rohit’s Home Struggles: Left-Arm Spin & Lost Intent? | Beyond the Boundary Highlights

India's batting failures, particularly against spin, in the Test series against New Zealand has ignited a debate on the nature of pitches and the over-aggressive approach of the Indian batsmen in red-ball cricket; and former Pakistan batsman Basit Ali has pointed finger at the batting coach for not doing his duty in guiding the youngsters.India suffered a first ever 0-3 whitewash in a Test series at home. After losing in overcast and rainy Bengaluru, the hosts opted for rank turners in Pune and Mumbai. The decision backfired as the Kiwi spinners Mitchell Santner and Ajaz Patel ran through the Indian line-up.Santner took a match-haul of 13 wickets in the Pune Test, while Patel bagged 11 in Mumbai.""India ka batting coach hai kaun, jo yeh nahi bata pa raha ki Test cricket session to session hoti hai? Bas har over 12 run bana lo, 10 run bana lo. Yeh koi cricket hai yaar! (who is India's batting coach , not able to advise the batsmen that you approach Tests session by session. Trying to score 10-12 runs every over is not cricket),"" said Basit in a video on his YouTube channel.Shubman Gill, who made 90 in the first innings in Mumbai, was dismissed for 1 in the second innings. Yashasvi Jaiswal got his eye in and reached 30 in the first innings, but gave away his wicket reverse-sweeping.""Is there no one to tell players like Jaiswal and Gill that when you reach 30-35, then don't get out playing loose shots, try to play out the session? Because only a set batsman can be successful (on such tracks), at that time he is your Bradman,"" said the former Pakistan batsman. ""But it seems they wait and think that there is still Virat Kohli to come, Rishabh Pant too, also KL Rahul and Sarfaraz; but on these tracks, the one who is set is the big player.""Head coach Gautam Gambhir 's coaching staff includes assistant coaches in the form of Abhishek Nayar and Dutchman Ryan ten Doeschate , but there is ambiguity on who performs the role of a batting coach.""Who is the batting coach? Doesn't he tune up the batsmen?"" Basit questioned again. ""(It's because of) white-ball cricket. What happens in white-ball cricket? You have to reach the ball. In Test matches, you have to allow the ball to come to you. That's the difference. That's what you had to tell them.""The 53-year-old continued to criticize the Indian team's decision to ask for turning pitches.""Jaiswal scored 200 against England. Those were better pitches. (Rahul) Dravid has a better mind (as a coach) compared to Gautam. Dravid used to advise for four-day pitches, so that a Test match goes at least until the fourth day. Let it turn from the third, fourth day, fifth day.""But you guys are asking for wickets (that turn) from the first day, where someone who is not a regular spinner will get turn even if he bowls straight. Santner took 13 wickets in one Test, something he may not have done in a series of five ODIs...I am not taking credit away from New Zealand. They played very good cricket after the Sri Lanka tour,"" he concluded.India will next embark on the tough tour of Australia, where the title-holders of the Border Gavaskar Trophy will take on the hosts in a series of five Test matches.The first Test begins on November 22 in Perth.",India suffered a first ever 0-3 whitewash in a Test series at home.

Jonathan Mingo Trade: Jonathan Mingo Trade Leaves Cowboys Fans Feeling ‘Robbed’ Amid Calls for Jerry Jones’ Resignation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jonathan-mingo-trade-leaves-cowboys-fans-feeling-robbed-amid-calls-for-jerry-jones-resignation/articleshow/114992794.cms,"Jim Dedmon-Imagn Images

A Controversial Acquisition: Jonathan Mingo's Stats Fall Short

Criticism Mounts as Fans Recall Recent NFL Trades

Fourth-Round Picks: Lost Potential

Fan Reactions and Calls for Change

Looking Ahead: Can Mingo Redeem the Trade?

As the Dallas Cowboys grapple with a challenging season, a recent trade for wide receiver Jonathan Mingo has fueled frustration among fans, who are calling for Jerry Jones to step down as General Manager. After a tough start, with the Cowboys losing five of their first eight games, fans expected a game-changing move from Jones. Instead, the team acquired Mingo from the Carolina Panthers, a decision many fans and analysts are finding difficult to understand.Also read - Former NFL Star Threatens to Leave U.S. if Kamala Harris Wins, Sparking Reaction from Patriots’ Champ Jones' decision to trade a 2025 fourth-round pick for Mingo surprised many. Selected as a second-round pick in 2023, Mingo’s rookie season saw moderate productivity, with 43 catches for 418 yards on 85 targets but no touchdowns. This season, he’s managed only 12 catches for 121 yards without a single score. The Panthers’ return of a fourth-rounder has left Cowboys fans feeling “robbed” by the trade, with some going as far as calling Dallas “the most embarrassing franchise in the NFL.”Comparisons with other recent NFL trades only intensified the backlash. Many pointed out that the Kansas City Chiefs acquired five-time Pro Bowler DeAndre Hopkins for a conditional 2025 fifth-round pick, a trade that reflects greater value in fans’ eyes. Additionally, fans recalled how the Cowboys received only a fifth and sixth-round pick for Amari Cooper in 2022, further fueling discontent about what they see as a lopsided exchange for Mingo.Historically, the Cowboys have found gems in the fourth round, including notable players like quarterback Dak Prescott and linebacker Anthony Hitchens. Now, fans worry that trading away next year’s fourth-round pick for Mingo eliminates the chance for another standout draft selection. This sentiment was echoed by Cowboys Editor-in-Chief RJ Ochoa, who shared his disappointment on social media, calling the trade “gross.”The Mingo trade has led to a wave of public outcry, with some fans openly calling for Jerry Jones’ resignation. ""Well done, Jerry Jones,"" one fan wrote, ""you’ve proved my point. As long as you’re in charge, this team will never make it past the first round of the playoffs.” Another fan defended head coach Mike McCarthy, placing full responsibility on Jones: ""It’s not McCarthy; it’s Jerry Jones who needs to let go of his control.”To appease frustrated fans, Mingo will need to make a significant impact on the field, possibly as early as his expected debut next week. Until then, Cowboys Nation remains critical, holding onto hopes that the 2024 season can still bring some much-needed redemption for Dallas.Also read - Former NFL Star Threatens to Leave U.S. if Kamala Harris Wins, Sparking Reaction from Patriots’ Champ","Dallas Cowboys General Manager Jerry Jones traded a 2025 fourth-round pick for wide receiver Jonathan Mingo.

Gyokeres then made it 3-1 from the penalty spot after Josko Gvardiol was penalized for a shove on Francisco Trincão in the area.Haaland’s penalty hit the crossbar, before Gyökeres showed the Norwegian how it’s done with another spot kick at the other end to complete the scoring.It is the first time since 2018 that City have lost three straight games, coming off a defeat to Tottenham in the English League Cup and a loss to Bournemouth in the Premier League.“In my seven and a half years at the club, I don't remember losing three games in a row,” City midfielder Bernardo Silva said.In Spain, Christian Pulisic sent in a corner for Malick Thiaw to head Milan into a 12th-minute lead, ensuring Madrid trailed in a third straight game in the Champions League this season. The 15-time champions had already lost to surprise team Lille in their second game.Vinícius Júnior equalized from the penalty spot in the 23rd after he’d been tripped, but Álvaro Morata pounced on the rebound after Andriy Lunin saved Rafael Leão’s shot to restore the visitors’ lead against his former club.Morata had already been given a hostile reception from the home fans, who evidently remember the goal he scored to take Juventus through to the 2015 final at their team’s expense.Tijjani Reijnders scored Milan’s third goal as the home fans made their frustrations known at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.“The last two defeats are inexplicable. We have to analyze and react quickly,"" Lunin said, referring to Madrid's 4-0 loss to Barcelona in their previous Spanish league game.It's the first time since 2009 that Madrid have lost two successive games at home with at least three goals conceded in each, according to Opta.“We have to get back on track,” Lunin said.German forward Nicolas Kuhn scored twice as Celtic defeated Leipzig 3-1 at home, and Juventus drew 1-1 at Lille.Lille midfielder Edon Zhegrova eluded two defenders before playing a perfect pass for Jonathan David, who fired inside the far post, but Dusan Vlahovic equalized with a penalty for the Italian club.Donyell Malen scored late for Borussia Dortmund to beat Sturm Graz 1-0 at home, and Thilo Kehrer did likewise for Monaco to win at Bologna 1-0.United States midfielder Malik Tillman scored one goal and set up another as PSV Eindhoven beat Spanish team Girona 4-0.Dinamo Zagreb dealt Slovan Bratislava their fourth straight defeat in the competition as the visitors came from behind to win 4-1 in Bratislava.",Real Madrid lose 3-1 at home to AC Milan. Manchester City lose 4-1 to Sporting Lisbon. Luis Diaz scores hat trick as Liverpool beat Bayer Leverkusen 4-0.

#IPL Retentions: Why No Shreyas Iyer in KKR Doesn't Come As a Surprise

A very charming speaker, Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan is known for his excellent communication skills but the same cannot be said for his Indian Premier League ( IPL ) franchise Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). Even days after the IPL franchises submitted their list of retained players to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), Australia bowler Mitchell Starc is yet to hear from KKR.“I still haven’t heard from them (KKR)...,"" said Mitchell Starc to Australia's Picked up at the mini-auction for Rs 24.75 crore in December 2023, the speedster was Player of the Match in the IPL 2024 final for his spell of 2/14 versus Sunrisers Hyderabad but surprisingly hasn't had any dialogue with the defending champions.TimesofIndia.com reached out to KKR CEO Venky Mysore for a comment but the top boss didn't respond to a text message and chose to press the block button on Whatsapp. KKR's silence towards Starc shouldn't come as a surprise considering the franchise followed a similar approach with captain Shreyas Iyer too.As we had reported last week , KKR had their first chat with Shreyas only three days before the IPL retentions deadline. Prior to the chat on October 27, no one at KKR had reached out to the player who led them to their third IPL title.Word on the street was that Shreyas was looking at a high retainer fee but even for that to happen, the two parties had to engage in timely discussions but that wasn't the case. KKR were always looking at the likes of Andre Russell (Rs 12 crore) and Sunil Narine (Rs 12 crore) as first choices and they got the second-best price tag. Rinku Singh was top retention at Rs 13 crore and uncapped players Harshit Rana and Ramandeep Singh were retained for Rs 4 crore each.KKR CEO, in an interaction with the team's official website, maintained they ""engaged in conversations"" but latest revelation by Starc and the Iyer episode suggest otherwise.""First and foremost, I think our approach has always been to maintain transparency and have proper conversations with everyone. I've not only had conversations with the six we have retained, but I have also engaged in conversations with the ones we couldn't retain. Obviously I am aware of some of the narratives that have been going around. It’s sufficient to say that, we always engage in talks with everyone and most people understand our position,"" Mysore was quoted by KKR.in. Shreyas will now enter the IPL mega auction and is already attracting a lot of interest from leading franchises for a leadership role.",Mitchell Starc is yet to hear from Kolkata Knight Riders. Starc was Player of the Match in the IPL 2024 final for his spell of 2/14. KKR's silence towards Starc shouldn't come as a surprise considering the franchise followed a similar approach with captain Shreyas Iyer too.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114972089,imgsize-118360,width-400,resizemode-4/114972089.jpg"

(Photo by Tauseef Mustafa/AFP via Getty Images)

MUMBAI: In a controversial, yet audacious decision, Mumbai have dropped opener Prithvi Shaw on ""fitness grounds"" during their ongoing campaign in the Ranji Trophy The 24-year-old batsman, who recently uploaded a video of himself toiling in the gym, was given a 'break' for the last match against Tripura at Agartala, and will also remain absent from the defending champions' next fixture against Odisha at the Sharad Pawar Cricket Academy in BKC from Wednesday. It's understood that Shaw has been prescribed a rigorous regimen to reduce excess weight.Following Mumbai's practice session at BKC on Tuesday, Mumbai's bowling mentor, former India pacer Dhawal Kulkarni emphasised that despite his omission, the team maintains faith in the swashbuckling batsman's ability. ""Yes, fitness is paramount. We, as a team, want to see him flourishing, and it's beneficial for himself that he's working on his fitness. He's one of the finest players Mumbai has ever produced. And he's steadily progressing (fitness),"" Kulkarni told TOI.In a match they must win to maintain their knockout prospects, Mumbai will be strengthened by the return of batsman Shreyas Iyer , after he bypassed the Tripura match to rest his shoulder. During his last appearance at BKC, Shreyas had notched his maiden century against Maharashtra last month.""Certainly, Shreyas' return is a significant boost for us. He scored a hundred at this venue. He's back and batting splendidly in the nets,"" Kulkarni said.Positioned fourth in a relatively modest Elite Group A, Mumbai has experienced an inconsistent Ranji campaign thus far. They began with a setback against Baroda on a spinning track in Vadodara, before vanquishing Maharashtra at home at BKC and then unexpectedly drawing their match against Tripura at Agartala. With nine points accumulated, they're earnestly hoping for two outright victories against Odisha at home and subsequently against Services at the Palam ground in New Delhi from November 13, before the Ranji pauses for the Mushtaq Ali T20 and Vijay Hazare Trophy tournaments.""Indeed, it's been an erratic campaign. As champions, we invariably aim to finish atop. Home fixtures are crucial for outright wins. We consider this a vital game. There's another match afterwards, followed by SMAT. Hence, it's essential to conclude strongly in the next two matches. If we excel here, and players maintain form, that advantages us heading into SMAT,"" Kulkarni said.According to sources, MCA's BKC curator Nadim Memon has prepared a greenish wicket, suggesting Mumbai's pacers Shardul Thakur, Mohit Avasthi, Royston Dias and possibly Juned Khan will be expected to deliver, reminiscent of their performance in March during the Ranji Trophy semifinals at this venue, when they dismantled Tamil Nadu for 146 on Day One.Confronting Mumbai in Mumbai presents a huge challenge for Surendra Bhave coached Odisha, currently occupying the 7th position in Elite Group A. However, their captain, Govinda Poddar, remained undaunted.""There are several prominent names in the Mumbai team, including Shreyas Iyer, Shardul Thakur and Ajinkya Rahane . But notably, we defeated Mumbai in the Vijay Hazare Trophy at Bengaluru last year. Undoubtedly, in the Ranji Trophy, in red-ball cricket, Mumbai are formidable. However, the superior team on match day will prevail,"" Poddar asserted.",Mumbai drop Prithvi Shaw on 'fitness grounds' in Ranji Trophy. The 24-year-old batsman was given a 'break' for the last match against Tripura. He will also remain absent from the defending champions' next fixture against Odisha at the Sharad Pawar Cricket Academy in BKC.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114999486,imgsize-27722,width-400,resizemode-4/114999486.jpg"

With his legbreak, he not only picked up four wickets against Haryana but also troubled the Karnataka batters and got rid of players like Mayank Agarwal and Manish Pandey among others.However, the visitors won’t be in any mood to make it easy for the hosts.

Rajasthan Cricket Association bows to Deepak Hooda’s demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/rajasthan-cricket-association-bows-to-deepak-hoodas-demand/articleshow/114988976.cms,"JAIPUR: The issue of team selection has sparked internal conflict between Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) ad hoc committee and captain Deepak Hooda . What became the point of contention was the committee's stance on Hooda’s choice of players, particularly Kunal Singh Rathore who was left out of the team for the fourth match.Displeased with the 16-member squad announced on late Monday evening, Hooda and vice-captain Deepak Chahar resigned from their positions. As the situation took a more serious turn, the management was forced to beat a hasty retreat and conceded to Hooda’s demand by including Rathore in the squad on the eve of their Elite Group B Ranji Trophy match against Hyderabad at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium here on Wednesday.It has been learnt that Hooda communicated to the management that he is unwilling to lead the side but he was requested by the ad hoc panel to continue at least for the game against Hyderabad.“The senior players disapproved of certain players and it has been learnt that the squad released was not the same as it was discussed by the selectors and the captain. There are a few names which have made a back door entry in the squad and that did not go down well with the senior players. It's a good sign that this time all the seniors have raised their voice against such corrupt practices which are not new at the RCA. I hope Hooda and Chahar continue as the captain and as the vice-captain and the matter is addressed by the state sports minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore,” said a source privy to the development.Ad hoc committee member Dharmveer Singh Shekhawat denied receiving resignation from both Hooda and Chahar.”Nothing like this happened. Yes, Rathore was not included in the official squad because he doesn’t have any performance to show. So we thought of giving another wicketkeeper batsman Rajkumar Saini a chance who has done well in the Challenger Trophy and Colvin Shield,” he said.Shekhawat added that on Hooda’s request they added Rathore back as the skipper did not want to experiment with any player at this stage of the tournament.“Hooda told us that the fourth game is a crucial one and he can’t afford to bring in a new batsman. He added that he won’t be able to captain the side if his choice of players are not there. Hooda also said that he is looking for stability in the side. I feel he is right in his thinking,” Shekhawat stated.Ad hoc panel coordinator Jaideep Bihani also cited lack of runs to justify initial exclusion of Rathore from the squad.Moreover, a similar story unfolded in the previous match against Gujarat when middle-order batsman Salman Khan failed to find a place in the squad, but was later included after the captain’s insistence.The entire functioning of the RCA ad hoc panel also reflects poorly on the selection committee which is apparently being arm-twisted by ‘the people at the higher level’.In this backdrop, how the team will gather itself to face Hyderabad will be interesting to see. Rajasthan are currently placed fourth in their group with 10 points that includes two draws and a solitary win.Squad: Deepak Hooda (captain),Deepak Chahar (vice-captain), Mahipal Lomror, Bharat Sharma, Abhijeet Tomar, Ram Mohan Chauhan, Kanhaiya Lal Swami, Ajay Singh Kookna, Arafat Khan, Aniket Choudhary, Zuber Ali, Rajesh Bishnoi (Junior), Shubham Garhwal, Sahil Dewan, Rajkumar Saini, Rajveer Singh and Kunal Singh Rathore.","The issue of team selection has sparked internal conflict between Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) ad hoc committee and captain Deepak Hooda.

"New Zealand’s 3-0 victory in India driven by preparation and adaptability, says Ajaz Patel",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/new-zealand-in-india/new-zealands-3-0-victory-in-india-driven-by-preparation-and-adaptability-says-ajaz-patel/articleshow/114987227.cms,"Ajaz Patel (X Photo)

New Zealand's cricket team achieved a historic win against India, securing a 3-0 victory in their Test series. This marks the first time a visiting team has defeated India in a Test series played on Indian soil. Ajaz Patel , a key player in the New Zealand team, shared his thoughts on this victory, emphasizing the team's comprehensive preparation. He highlighted their focus on adapting to various playing conditions, a crucial aspect of their success.“We had a great winter back home where we prepared on turning wickets. We made sure we had different surfaces that we tried and practiced on, so we were, I guess, conditioned to bowling on different surfaces as well,” Patel told ICC.Patel explained that their rigorous training included practicing on different types of turning pitches, preparing them for the challenges of playing in India. This strategy proved effective as the team seamlessly adjusted to the varying conditions encountered during the series.Patel further elaborated on the distinct challenges posed by the pitches in Bangalore, Pune, and Mumbai, emphasizing the need for adaptability. He highlighted that adjusting to changing conditions is a significant challenge for teams touring the subcontinent.“It's been three different surfaces and three different games, and we’re well aware that one of the challenges of going to Asia is that the conditions are going to change all the time and you have to be adaptable and even within the game the conditions change very quickly.“I mean even in this Mumbai Test, I was bowling in the first innings and I felt like I was bowling really well, but the wicket wasn't really turning and then (when) I came back after Lunch, all of a sudden everything started happening.”The Mumbai Test held special significance for Patel, as it was at Wankhede Stadium that he achieved a remarkable feat in 2021.He became only the third bowler in Test cricket history to claim all 10 wickets in an innings, joining the ranks of Jim Laker and Anil Kumble . This accomplishment further solidified his reputation as a skilled spin bowler.Patel discussed the art of spin bowling, emphasizing the importance of versatility and adaptability. He stressed the need to quickly assess the playing surface and adjust one's bowling technique accordingly.“It's also reading the surface quickly because the conditions, as I say, do change at a constant (rate). Sometimes the conditions in the morning can be very different from the conditions in that middle session, and so as a spinner, it's about knowing how to get the most out of that. How to change your pace, how to go up and down while still having the ball shape,” said Patel.He explained that the ability to decipher the nuances of the pitch and adapt to changing conditions is crucial for spin bowlers to succeed.New Zealand's triumph in India followed a contrasting outcome in their previous series against Sri Lanka, where they experienced a complete reversal of fortune, losing all matches.Despite the contrasting results, Patel asserted that the team's overall performance remained consistent. He attributed the differing outcomes to factors like luck, especially the toss, which plays a crucial role in determining the course of a match, particularly in subcontinent conditions.“From Sri Lanka to here, I don't think we were too much different. I think we played some really good cricket in Sri Lanka, but unfortunately (lost the series). When you come to the subcontinent, the toss is so important and bowling in the last innings in comparison to bowling in the third innings, especially on a turning wicket, can sometimes be the difference as spinners,” Patel said.“While the results didn't go our way in Sri Lanka, I don't feel like we played too poorly or anything like that. Even from a batting department, we still put runs on the board. It was just a matter of, you know, having a bit of luck our way as well in the series,” Patel added.He acknowledged that while they faced setbacks in Sri Lanka, their overall performance was not drastically different.

have got 22 yellow cards in just 6 games so far in this ISL. Is discipline a worry for you so early in the season?

Jose Molina loves to live in the present. This is the byword for his life.The Mohun Bagan Super Giant coach's 'weltanschauung' or world philosophy may have been influenced by a personal battle to overcome cancer 22 years ago.Even a long-term contract is not something the 54-year-old Spaniard pines for. ""For me it's a piece of paper I need to sign. I'm here because Mohun Bagan wanted me and I wanted to come. But if any one of the parties is not happy, the best thing is to shake hands and leave,"" he said rather nonchalantly.His mind is now preoccupied with the catastrophic floods back in Spain. ""I live in the north of Valencia and floods have devastated the south. All my family and friends are okay. But it's a terrible catastrophe to have happened in Spain,"" he remarked, now with a serious, somber note.Molina - a former Spanish goalkeeper who's still regarded as a hero at Atletico Madrid - is not new to Indian football. By his own admission, since guiding now defunct ATK to the 2016 ISL title, he continued to be sounded out by several Indian clubs until he said yes to Bagan's call this year.During an exclusive chat with a select media persons, including TOI, at the Mohun Bagan tent on Tuesday, Molina opened up on several key chapters of his career, from playing with the likes of Diego Simeone and Lionel Scaloni to serving the Spanish football federation as its sporting director.I was a goalkeeper but made my debut for Spain as a left-winger! During the match against Norway (a friendly held in Oslo in 1996), the coach (Javier Clemente) used up all his substitutions and when another player got injured, I was given two options - either staying on the bench or coming on as a left-winger. I played for 16 minutes. (It was) not my position but an amazing experience.My last game (he played 9 matches in all for La Roja) was also against Norway (in Euro 2000). As a goalkeeper I made a mistake and we lost 1-0. The coach (José Antonio Camacho) said after the game that I would no longer play. As a player I had to accept the coach's decision. We all make mistakes and that decision still hurts me. Because I believe that I had the talent to play for Spain longer.I was also in the 1998 World Cup squad and (Andoni) Zubizarreta was No. 1 goalkeeper. We lost the first match 3-2 to Nigeria and Zubizarreta made mistakes. But the then coach (Clemente) decided that Zubizarreta stayed in the XI. That was not the case with me in 2000.Was it the best experience for me as a player? No. Every time I win any title that is the best experience. To win the ISL in 2016, the title in the Hong Kong league (with Kitchee). These are all parts of my best experiences.That was an amazing moment. Everyone at Real Madrid was preparing to celebrate the occasion by winning that match (Copa del Rey) since it was their centenary year and they were hosting the final at Estadio Santiago Bernabéu. It was more special because of my Atletico past. Day before the final, some of my friends at Atletico came over to me and wished me luck. People still talk about that match in La Coruna.When you are a player, you never know what will happen to you in future. Simeone and Scaloni - they too didn't know their future at that time. Even I wasn't sure about my future. I live in the present. Maybe my illness has helped me understand the value of enjoying my present as much as I can.One of the first things I did as a technical director (of Spanish football) was to look for more balance in our style and the kind of players suitable for this so that we could create a winning team. Football is a constant evolution. Spain has not changed tiki-taka style. But it's a process of evolution. Tiki-taka is still there, but sometimes you need to be more direct in your approach to the game.I am not happy with the AFC's decision. I would prefer my team to play in Asia. Now, you have to forget about the AFC and focus on ISL. We'll try to win it and play in the AFC next year to prove that an Indian team can be strong in Asia tournaments as well.Not at all. The yellow cards are the referee's decisions and they can be right or wrong. But Mohun Bagan have brought me here not to win the Fair play trophy but the title. If both are achieved, it's better, but the aim is always to win the championship.","Mohun Bagan coach Jose Molina is a former Spanish goalkeeper. Molina won the Liga and Cup 'double' for Atletico Madrid in 1996 and 2002. The 54-year-old also played for Deportivo la Coruna, Real Madrid and Atletico.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115000189,imgsize-45212,width-400,resizemode-4/115000189.jpg"

JFC suffer consecutive 5-goal hammering,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/jfc-suffer-consecutive-5-goal-hammering/articleshow/114964574.cms,"It proved to be another nightmare for Jamshedpur FC at JRD Tata Sports Complex on Monday as they were made to endure a 1-5 loss to Chennaiyin FC after their five-goal defeat in the last Indian Super League game.Jamshedpur's former Shield-winning coach Owen Coyle dealt a blow on Khalid Jamil's hosts with his new wards - with youngster Irfan Yadwad playing a lead role - as the visitors climbed two spots to sixth on the ISL table even as Jamshedpur held on to their fourth position after seven games with a number of seventh round fixtures still to go.The onslaught started as early as in the sixth minute when Pratik Chaudhary, in his bid to clear a Vinci Barretto cross from the left of the box, actually made a perfect finish into his own goal to the disappointment of his helpless goalkeeper Albino Gomes.Although Vishal Yumnam was a bit wide in putting in the ball in the 20th minute, Chennaiyin were gifted their second juts two minutes later. This time, it was the pace, skill and power of Yadwad as he vindicated the trust shown in him by veteran Coyle with a defence-splitting turn in the midfield that began the build-up to his first goal. The 23-year-old then made a run into the Jamshedpur box that could not be contained by the defenders led by Jamil's go-to man and captain Ashutosh Mehta as his shot at goal took a slight deflection en route the goal.There was no respite for Jamshedpur's weary defence, and Jamil at the stands, as two minutes later, in the 24th minute, Yadwad turned provider to Connor Shields - who had been missing his first goal of the season - with a pass outside the box that the Scottish shot into the right of the goal with Mehta at the other end.There was, however, no improvement in Jamshedpur's game as every trick in Khalid's book looked to have backfired in absence of defensive talisman Stepehn Eze, missing the match with a red card in the last game at NorthEast United.The script stayed the same after the change of ends as Chaudhary lost the ball a little outside the box to a Yadwad charge at him from the left in the 54th minute. It was Wilmar Jordan Gill who landed the pass from Yadwad and with only the goalkeeper to beat, made no mistake in adding the fifth to his goal tally this season.With both Jordan Murray and Javier Siverio having a bad day in office, and Jamil's 4-4-2 formation failing to stop the visitors' march, it was only a matter of time before Chennaiyin scored again and delivered a back-to-back five-goal assault on the Men of Steel. It was Lucas Brambilla's swerving solo effort from outside the box that left Gomes in another no position for a save.The hosts, with fans already leaving the Furnace, got a consolation goal after earning a controversial penalty kick from a Yadwad hand ball in the box - that was preceded by an offside call against Jamshedpur. Veteran Murray made no mistake to send in the spot kick but it was too little to ease the team and coach Jamil's disappointment after a great start to the season.",Jamshedpur lost 1-5 to Chennaiyin FC at JRD Tata Sports Complex on Monday.

WTA Finals: Top seed Aryna Sabalenka reaches semi-finals with win over Jasmine Paolini,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/wta-finals-top-seed-aryna-sabalenka-reaches-semi-finals-with-win-over-jasmine-paolini/articleshow/114962943.cms,"Aryna Sabalenka reacts during her women's singles group stage match against Jasmine Paolini at WTA Finals.

World number one Aryna Sabalenka secured a semi-final berth at the WTA Finals by beating Italian fourth seed Jasmine Paolini 6-3, 7-5 on Monday to stay unbeaten in the purple round-robin group.The 26-year-old is on the brink of clinching the year-end number one ranking. A win over Elena Rybakina in the final group match on Wednesday or a loss from her rival, Poland's Iga Swiatek, would seal the year-end top spot for the Belarusian.Sabalenka's win combined with Chinese Zheng Qinwen 's earlier 7-6(4) 3-6 6-1 victory over Rybakina ensured the top seed will finish first in her group regardless of her final result on Wednesday, making her the first player to reach the final four.Australian Open and U.S. Open champion Sabalenka also won her opening match in Riyadh against seventh seed Zheng. The Chinese player and Paolini, with 1-1 records, both remain in contention for the semis and meet on Wednesday.Swiatek is the only player who can overtake Sabalenka. The 23-year-old, who plays Coco Gauff on Tuesday, needs to retain her title undefeated and hope Sabalenka loses her remaining matches in order to claim the year-end number one spot.""I'm proud of myself. Not only myself, my team,"" Sabalenka said after her win. ""We were able to overcome a lot of things. To be able to show such great tennis and become world number one, It's teamwork. It's not only me.""""Nobody sees the behind the scenes work. But they do a lot for me. I really appreciate them for everything they do for me. This is motivation for me to keep winning on this court. Those guys deserve to be called the best team ever.""Sabalenka is the first player to reach back-to-back semis at the WTA Finals as world number one since Serena Williams in 2013-2014.Zheng, 22, notched her first career win over 25-year-old Kazakh Rybakina in their third meeting, bouncing back from her loss to Sabalenka to become the second Chinese player after Li Na to win a match at the Finals since they started in 1972.Rybakina suffered her second defeat, having arrived in Riyadh with fitness issues. Zheng, by contrast, came into the event after winning titles in Palermo and Tokyo plus Olympic gold in Paris.""I'm really happy to win this match because I'd never beaten her before and she's one of the greatest players right now on tour,"" Zheng said.""Even though I had a chance in the second set and didn't take it, I'm happy I came back in the third set and stayed focused.""","Aryna Sabalenka beats Jasmine Paolini 6-3, 7-5 to reach WTA Finals semi-finals.

PARIS: Germany's Alexander Zverev outserved Holger Rune in the semi-finals of the Paris Masters on Saturday to book his place in the final for the first time since losing to Daniil Medvedev in 2020.Zverev's 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) win against the Dane sent the 27-year-old to his second ATP 1000-level final of the season -- after his victory in Rome in May.World number three Zverev will face either Frenchman Ugo Humbert , who downed world number two Carlos Alcaraz in the last 16, or Russia's Karen Khachanov in Sunday's showpiece.""I feel like I made it a little difficult for myself but he (Rune) is a champion,"" said Zverev.""It is probably his favourite tournament and favourite court, but I am happy to be in my second final here.""For 2022 champion Rune, the loss put an end to his outside hopes of reaching the ATP Finals in Turin, which run from November 10-17.Zverev put pressure on Rune right from his first service game with the Dane eventually holding after two deuces.Zverev, standing at 198cm, relied on his big first serve and the speed of the surface at Paris' Bercy Arena to carry him through his service games.Rune, on the other hand, misfired regularly on his first serve and lacked fluency with his groundstrokes as two consecutive framed shots off his forehand and backhand at deuce gave the German a 3-1 lead.The 21-year-old suddenly raced to 15-40 in the next game but was again let down by his backhand as he sent two shots long and an attempted pass wide as Zverev recovered to consolidate.Despite leading 4-1, the 2024 French Open runner-up was also unconvincing from behind the baseline as the unforced errors accumulated for both players.However, Zverev could always rely on his serving to carry him through as he claimed the first set.Neither Rune nor Zverev challenged on serve at the beginning of the second set, with both holding to love or 15 until the seventh game.At 3-3, Zverev pounced to take a 0-40 lead and he broke Rune with a powerful inside-out forehand that set him up to finish easily at the net.The third seed now seemed in total control of the match and consolidated the break with a hold to love.But the resilient Rune defied expectation by suddenly breaking Zverev when the German was serving for the match.As the pressure mounted, both responded by upping their level from the open court and winners flew off both rackets as Rune eventually held a gripping game at 5-5, which had lasted 17 minutes.Zverev then served out comfortably to set up a tiebreak.Errors again crept into Rune's play and Zverev got an early mini-break, which he defended to book his spot in the final despite a superb passing shot on the run by the Dane to save a first match point.In the day's second semi-final, home hope Humbert bids to reach his first championship match at a Masters event, but to do so must overcome 2018 Paris winner Khachanov.","Alexander Zverev beats Holger Rune 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) in Paris Masters semi-final.

Anyways, second game was the toughest for both the players. Overall, I am happy with the performance.
