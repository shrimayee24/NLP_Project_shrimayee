Throwback to when Patrick Mahomes got candid about being a proud girl dad for the first time: “I Wanted to Have a Boy First”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/throwback-to-when-patrick-mahomes-got-candid-about-being-a-proud-girl-dad-for-the-first-time-i-wanted-to-have-a-boy-first/articleshow/121870109.cms,"Patrick Mahomes reveals what being a girl dad means to him (Getty Images)

Patrick Mahomes’ heartfelt moment as a girl dad resurfaces and it’s melting fans all over again







Kansas City Chiefs superstar Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany Mahomes, recently melted hearts on social media by revealing the face of their youngest child, Golden, for the first time. The post, shared jointly by the couple on Instagram, marks the first public glimpse of baby Golden’s face since her birth five months ago, on January 12, 2025.The post featured a tender family moment, highlighting all three of their children — Sterling (4), Bronze (2), and the newest member of the Mahomes clan, baby Golden. Patrick, holding Golden gently in his arms, beams with pride as she sucks on her tiny hand, dressed in a white onesie and sporting an oversized white bow that made her look even more adorable. Another frame captures Brittany and Golden, with the little one flashing a radiant smile in a cute denim romper — a moment that quickly stole fans' hearts.True to their tradition, Patrick and Brittany had earlier decided not to reveal their children’s faces immediately after birth. The couple has always placed high importance on privacy, especially when it comes to their kids. But when they finally shared this sweet family portrait, fans couldn’t stop gushing over how grown and happy the Mahomes family looked.While many are surprised at how young Patrick is to be a father of three, the 29-year-old quarterback has always embraced early parenthood. “No, it’s awesome. I always wanted to have kids young. I got to grow up in the locker room. I think I’ve talked about it before, and it made such an impact on my life,” he once said.Despite his high-pressure role leading the Chiefs, Mahomes never lets family take a backseat. As soon as he wraps up on the field, he’s quick to head home and soak up every moment with Brittany and their children. Fatherhood, as he describes, changed him for the better. Initially, he dreamed of having a son first, but everything shifted when he met his daughter Sterling.“Growing up I wanted to have a boy first, then I had a girl & it’s like God knew exactly what to do with me. He helped me mature as a man. It’s a different bond with a daughter because you’ve got to be that protector,” Mahomes shared during a candid conversation with Tom Brady on NFL on Fox.With every public glimpse of their family life, Patrick and Brittany continue to redefine what it means to balance fame, love, and parenthood — one sweet moment at a time.Also Read: “It affects everything”: Taylor Swift’s alleged falling out with Blake Lively gets deeper — and Travis Kelce may be caught in the crossfire","Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany Mahomes, recently revealed the face of their youngest child, Golden, for the first time.

Here are some of the best.But beyond the jokes and memes celebrating Bavuma’s calm demeanour and emotional post-match interview, the moment marked a defining chapter in South African cricket.At the presentation, Bavuma was quick to credit his teammates for the landmark victory.He heaped praise on Kagiso Rabada , who claimed nine wickets in the match, including a crucial five-for in the first innings.Despite returning from a one-month ban for recreational drug use, Rabada delivered when it mattered most, surpassing Allan Donald to become South Africa’s fourth-highest Test wicket-taker.Bavuma also hailed Aiden Markram , whose majestic 136 anchored the Proteas’ record-breaking chase.“People have questioned Aiden’s place, but he showed character. KG will surely be in the Hall of Fame one day,” Bavuma said, reflecting the deep camaraderie in the side.Rabada, visibly emotional, described the victory as a culmination of years of frustration and near-misses for South African cricket. “We’ve seen the heartbreak over the years. This is for our past players and our people back home. Hopefully this is just the beginning,” he said.The match itself was a rollercoaster.After bowling out Australia for 212 on day one, the Proteas collapsed to 138, handing the Aussies a 74-run lead.But a fiery second-innings bowling effort and Markram’s sublime knock sealed the chase of 282.Kyle Verreynne’s winning shot sent the crowd into raptures, while Bavuma memes lit up the internet, turning the captain into both a hero and a viral sensation.","Temba Bavuma led South Africa to a historic ICC triumph after 27 years.

Kylie Kelce’s honest talk with her mom about sex before marriage will leave you stunned

Kylie Kelce is no stranger to real, unfiltered conversations, especially when it comes to family. In the latest episode of her Not Gonna Lie podcast, aired June 12, the mom of four opened up about a deeply personal memory that revealed the bond she shares with her mother, Lisa McDevitt — whom she lovingly refers to as “Lil’ Lis. ”Joining forces with Olympic rugby player Ilona Maher, the episode unfolded into an honest discussion about how their mothers influenced their understanding of sex and communication. For Kylie Kelce, this comfort was rooted in openness from an early age. Recounting a moment that clearly stuck with her, she said, ""I bombarded her, and came in and sat in a room while she was doing something, and just was like, 'OK, Mom, here. We're here now.'""At the time, Kelce had made up her mind to wait until marriage to have sex. But her mother’s response was anything but conventional. ""I think I'm gonna save myself for marriage,"" she told her mom. The reply? ""I think you're gonna change your mind."" And that wasn’t even the punchline.Kelce laughed as she remembered her mom’s brutally honest follow-up. ""Lil' Lisa doubled down... She was like, 'Hey, you gotta test drive a car before you buy it, right?'""While the original plan didn’t pan out, Kelce said the point wasn’t about the decision itself — it was the freedom she felt in making it.“It made it less scary. It made it less risky,” she said, adding that being able to speak openly with her mom gave her a safer, more informed perspective on sex and relationships.Now a mother to four daughters — Wyatt (5), Elliotte (4), Bennett (2), and baby Finnley, born in March — Kylie hopes to build the same trusting dynamic with her own girls. She believes that kind of environment allows for real conversations about protection and safety. “With my mom, then I could talk about getting an IUD, I could talk about condoms and all that stuff with her,” she explained.Beyond the sex talk, Kelce also let fans into the chaos of raising four young kids. She joked, “If I had to describe the change going from three kids to four kids in two words or less: ‘Holy shit?’” Despite being a seasoned mom, she admitted she’s “still Googling things because that doesn’t stop, either.”For Kelce, authenticity and humor are part of the journey. Whether she’s parenting or podcasting, one thing is clear — the candid legacy of “Lil’ Lis” lives on.Also Read: Ex-girlfriend of Aaron Rodgers reacts after he confirms secret marriage: ""It's really just harassment""","Kylie Kelce opened up about a deeply personal memory that revealed the bond she shares with her mother, Lisa McDevitt.

How Wiggins Fits With LeBron and Doncic





Theare weighing their options this offseason, and according to a popular NBA analyst, one potential move involves swapping a key forward for a proven NBA champion.The Los Angeles Lakers have two clear paths in free agency: pursuing a dominant center or trading for an experienced wing player to bolster their championship aspirations. According to recent reports, the franchise may lean toward the latter by targeting Miami Heat star Andrew Wiggins.Lake Show Life’s Svyatoslav Rovenchuk suggests the Lakers could package forward Rui Hachimura in a deal to acquire Wiggins from the Miami Heat.""The fit of Rui Hachimura alongside (Luka) Doncic and (LeBron) James has quickly come under scrutiny after a premature first-round exit to the Minnesota Timberwolves,"" Rovenchuk wrote. ""This has led many to believe the Lakers are better off trading the starting forward."" (H/t: Sporting News)Andrew Wiggins could provide the Los Angeles Lakers with much-needed perimeter scoring and defensive versatility. Here’s why this trade could work:- Salary Match: Hachimura ($17 million) plus another expiring contract could match Wiggins’ $28.2 million salary for 2025-26.- Proven Playoff Performer: Wiggins was instrumental in Golden State’s 2022 title run, averaging 17.2 points and 4.5 rebounds per game.- Immediate Upgrade: While Hachimura is solid, Wiggins offers better two-way impact and championship experience.Once considered an underachieving talent in Minnesota, Wiggins revitalized his career with the Golden State Warriors . His improved motor and efficiency made him a key piece in Golden State’s success.However, after a slow start in 2024-25, the Warriors traded him to Miami in the Jimmy Butler deal.Wiggins’ skill set complements the Lakers’ star duo:- Reliable three-point shooting for better floor spacing.- Strong perimeter defense to ease the load on LeBron James.- Playoff-tested mentality, crucial for deep postseason runs.With the Heat struggling, Wiggins may welcome a move to a contender like the Lakers.While Hachimura has been a steady presence, Wiggins represents a clear upgrade for a Los Angeles Lakers team in win-now mode. If Los Angeles can structure the right deal, adding the former Warriors champion could be the move that pushes them back into title contention.","The Los Angeles Lakers have two clear paths in free agency: pursuing a dominant center or trading for an experienced wing player.

Tyrese Haliburton fires back at critics, Stephen A. Smith takes it personally in fiery rant



Hilarious fan reactions to ‘ Dumb and Dumber ’ trolling of Stephen A. Smith and Kendrick Perkins at Game 4







Sometimes, the loudest message in a Finals game doesn’t come from a superstar or a coach—it comes from the stands. During Game 4 of the 2025 NBA Finals at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, while most fans rocked gold Pacers shirts, two individuals turned heads with bold fashion choices straight out of a comedy classic. Dressed in Dumb and Dumber-style tuxedos—one bright orange, one electric blue—they topped it off with oversized face cutouts of ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith and Kendrick Perkins. It was a hilarious, pointed response to recent media criticism of Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton—and fans online immediately took notice.The media heat on Tyrese Haliburton started after Game 2, when he was criticized for his passiveness in a 107–123 Pacers loss. On “First Take”, ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith didn’t hold back. “Win the damn chip, bro… That ain’t on me. That’s on you,” he said, implying Haliburton wasn’t delivering when it mattered. Smith continued, “Just in case he was talking about me—my brother, I'm not going away… this train don’t stop.”Then came Game 3. Haliburton bounced back with 22 points, 11 assists, and 9 rebounds in a 116–107 Pacers win. After the game, he was asked about the media noise. He didn’t name names but made his feelings clear: “Most of the time, the talking heads on the major platforms, I couldn’t care less honestly. Like, what do they really know about basketball?” Kendrick Perkins , speaking on NBA Today, gave Haliburton credit for stepping up.“He finally arrived to the NBA Finals—to us box score watchers,” Perkins said. He even acknowledged, “He outplayed SGA.”And then came Game 4, when two fans used fashion to flip the script. Their orange and blue tuxes carried double meaning: orange symbolizing Smith’s New York Knicks loyalty, and blue a nod to the Oklahoma City Thunder—Perkins’ former team. It was comedy, commentary, and petty brilliance all rolled into one.Fans took to X with no shortage of reactions to the trolling masterclass.One fan said: “Absolutely incredible troll job by Pacers fans dressed as Stephen A. Smith and Kendrick Perkins. Dumb and Dumber tuxedos and all.”This tweet captured the moment perfectly and praised the fans for the elite-level trolling and creative execution.A second user chimed in with: “Two guys in the front row at the Pacers game dressed like Dumb and Dumber with Stephen A Smith and Kendrick Perkins faces on their suits.”This user highlighted the boldness of the fans’ courtside position, emphasizing how visible and intentional the troll job was.Another user joked: “Are these two guys front row at the Pacers game calling Stephen A Smith and Kendrick Perkins Dumb and Dumber?”This tweet added playful speculation, bluntly asking if the fans were deliberately labeling the ESPN duo as the classic comedy characters.One more said:“Best thing I’ve seen tonight…. Dumb and Dumber at the Pacer game tonight!”This comment called the bit the highlight of the evening—more memorable than even the on-court action for some viewers.And finally, another user said:“Pretty sure these fans are in Dumb and Dumber costumes…with face cutouts of Stephen A Smith and Kendrick Perkins.”This tweet added to the confirmation and appreciation of the stunt, acknowledging the detail in the fans’ outfits and execution.Also Read: Tyrese Haliburton shares heartwarming moment with Obi Toppin’s daughter before crucial Indiana Pacers vs. Oklahoma City Thunder NBA Finals Game 4 From Tyrese Haliburton shrugging off criticism to two fans turning sports talk into visual satire, Game 4 of the NBA Finals was about more than basketball. It became a statement on media narratives, on confidence, and on the creative passion of Indiana’s fan base.

Jasson Dominguez’s error hurts Yankees in close game

Fans doubt Dominguez is ready for the majors

Young star faces high expectations





Jasson Dominguez, a young Yankees star made a huge error that angered fans during a game against the Boston Red Sox. He froze on the bases, costing his team a chance to score. ""I mean what the f**k are you DOING. Dominguez should be benched tomorrow for this alone I’m sorry. Completely inexcusable and unacceptable,"" one fan posted angrily on social media.During the seventh inning of the Yankees’ 4-3 loss to the Red Sox on June 14, 2025, Jasson Dominguez made a costly mistake. He was on second base when Trent Grisham swung at a pitch. Dominguez thought Grisham struck out and stopped running, but Grisham hadn’t.This confusion meant Dominguez didn’t advance, missing a chance to put runners on second and third with Aaron Judge up next. The inning ended without a score, frustrating fans. Dominguez said after the game, “I have nothing to say. No excuses. I made a mistake.” Fans were quick to react online, with one saying, “Send him back to the minors or trade him.”Another posted, “Jasson Dominguez may rank among the game’s all time overhyped prospects.” The mistake added to doubts about Dominguez’s focus, as the Yankees fight for a playoff spot.Dominguez’s error wasn’t the only thing upsetting fans during the Red Sox series.His defense has been shaky, and he’s struggled at the plate at times. One fan wrote, “Speaking of being asleep, how does Jasson get picked off second base. WTF.” Manager Aaron Boone defended other players, like Anthony Volpe, who also made a baserunning mistake, but fans weren’t happy. They even criticized Boone, with one saying, “Yesterday completely unnecessary and now this again. ”Even with Dominguez's very good minor-league resumé like .314 hitting and 11 home runs in 2024, he has been an inconsistent big-league player. The fans are divided: some want him sent to the minors for refinement while others see him still as a potential star.Also Read: Jasson Dominguez's net worth in 2025 - Exploring career earnings, salary details, and everything else His youth and inexperience-weighing in just at 22 major-league games-are said to be working against him in waning moments when he needs to grow more. But the spotlight is on Dominguez; pressure is mounting for him to prove his worth.Jasson Dominguez, called “The Martian” for his amazing talent signed with the Yankees for $5.1 million in 2019 when he was just 16. Fans expected him to be a superstar like Mike Trout after he hit a home run in his first MLB at-bat in 2023. But injuries like Tommy John surgery and an oblique strain have slowed him down.In 2025, he hit three home runs in one game against the Athletics showing his power but mistakes like the one against the Red Sox have hurt his reputation. Boone believes Dominguez will learn from these errors, but fans want results now.With the Yankees aiming for the playoffs every game matters and Dominguez’s performance is under close watch. Can he overcome these challenges and become the star fans hoped for? His next games will be key to answering that question.","Jasson Dominguez, a young Yankees star made a huge error that angered fans during a game against the Boston Red Sox.

So that's what we're going to do now. So, before the game, we're just going to set up a camera using a pole. For that, we get the feed to capture the data.""Pushkar Sawant, India A performance analyst, highlighted the camera's key features.""Two good things about this camera is one it doesn't require power, and second, it's a PTZ, so you can change the angle, you can set the frame so it becomes pretty handy.""The team uses this practice match to assess various aspects of player performance.""Basically, it's a four-day game where you know we would try to simulate a few things in terms of you know the batters and the bowlers, you know if they have to achieve something, and also you know talking to the sports science team, you know they would like to get the bowlers road also.""The analysts ensure they maintain professional broadcast standards even for practice matches.""You can replicate the vision, which, you know, the frame that you see during live games. So we're just trying to get the same frame. So, as Pushkar was saying, just connect the LAN, and then you connect it to your laptop, and then you get the feed. So it's pretty much a very simple process.""The setup allows the team to capture and analyze crucial performance data despite the match not being televised.Shubman Gill (c), Rishabh Pant (vc), Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Karun Nair, Nitish Reddy, Ravindra Jadeja, Dhruv Jurel, Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Akash Deep, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav.Shoaib Bashir, Jacob Bethell, Harry Brook, Brydon Carse, Sam Cook, Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Jamie Overton, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Jamie Smith (wk), Ben Stokes (c), Josh Tongue, Chris Woakes.","Jasprit Bumrah's fiery bowling action during India's intrasquad game surfaced online.

Fans are losing it over Joe Burrow’s long curls in resurfaced Bengals photo





Apparently, all it takes to break the internet is one photo of Joe Burrow with long, dramatic locks. No new interview, no injury update, no trade buzz just curls, a football, and a menacing QB stare straight out of a retro yearbook.A picture of the Bengals star QB rocking longer-than-usual hair is making the rounds online again, and let’s just say: NFL fans are doing everything from crying laughing to thirst-tweeting like it’s 2013 Tumblr.Once twitter dropped the throwback-style pic, it was over. Fans saw Joe Burrow channeling peak teen-movie heartthrob energy, and the X replies went absolutely feral.Some were stunned. Others are confused. Most? Completely entertained.It’s giving: Netflix teen drama villain, Midwestern rock band lead singer, Guy who drives a vintage Camaro and never texts backBut also? It's giving confidence. Joe’s always been the guy who knows he looks good. And with the internet losing it over this photo, he clearly knew what he was doing.To be clear: Joe didn’t show up at minicamp like this. This isn’t his latest haircut debut. It’s just a photo, likely old, possibly for media day or a promo shoot and yet somehow, it’s got more reach than half the league’s OTA footage combined.There’s something about this version of Burrow that’s just too memeable. The fierce stare. The flowing locks. The Bengals jersey. It’s giving “villain in a lacrosse drama,” and fans can’t get enough.This isn’t just an internet moment. It’s a moment. A digital campfire around which NFL fans gather to joke, flirt, and photoshop Burrow into vintage movie posters.And for a league that lives and breathes QB drama, it’s kinda perfect. No hot takes. No controversies. Just hair, vibes, and a Bengals QB looking like he’s about to steal your girl and your playoff hopes.Whether you think he looks like 80s Batman, a soap opera villain, or just a dude who forgot to get a trim, one thing’s clear: Joe Burrow is unintentionally owning the NFL timeline today.And all it took... was a photo.Also read - Antonio Brown posts carefree video after attempted murder warrant, internet stunned","A picture of Bengals star QB Joe Burrow rocking longer-than-usual hair is making the rounds online again.

'South Africa kept fighting, deserved champions': Pat Cummins





South African legend AB de Villiers has opened up about his tumultuous time with the now-defunct Delhi Daredevils (now Delhi Capitals), calling his early IPL years a bittersweet chapter clouded by internal chaos. Despite boasting an array of cricketing legends, Delhi never made it past the semi-finals during de Villiers' stint from 2008 to 2010.“There were a lot of poisonous characters in that team,” de Villiers revealed in an interview with Cricket.com. “I'd hate to give you names - burning people, you know - but the Delhi Daredevils were in shambles.”De Villiers made the playoffs with Delhi in 2008 and 2009 and was one of the team's standout performers, scoring 465 runs in the 2009 season held in South Africa. However, his role diminished in 2010, and to his surprise, he found himself in the auction pool ahead of 2011.“I thought I was going to be the man,” he recalled. “Then, all of a sudden, I wasn't playing again… I was told I would be retained, and then the next minute, I saw myself in the auction. I didn't even know what had happened. So many weird things went on.”Despite the bitter fallout, de Villiers fondly remembers sharing the dressing room with icons like Glenn McGrath and Daniel Vettori “Some of the highlights of my life and career came during that stint,” he said.De Villiers went on to become one of the most beloved and successful players in IPL history with Royal Challengers Bengaluru, amassing over 5000 runs. “The day I walked into RCB, I felt like they wanted me,” he said. “You're going to become a great player with us - you're part of the family.”",AB de Villiers has opened up about his time with the now-defunct Delhi Daredevils.

Poll Should Shubman Gill prioritize a strong bowling attack over batting depth? Yes, bowling is crucial No, batting depth is more important It depends on the conditions I’m not sure

Yashasvi Jaiswal's Coach on England Prep, Opening Partner, & Playing Under Gill





As India gear up to face England in the first Test of the five-match series starting June 20 at Headingley, former cricketer Aakash Chopra has cautioned against compromising bowling potency for batting depth.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Chopra urged the team management, led by new Test captain Shubman Gill , to avoid repeating selection mistakes made in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.“We got a learning from the Border-Gavaskar Trophy that if you get a little obsessed about the batting and play batters who can bowl and choose bowlers who can bat, then you are just going down the wrong path,” Chopra said, underlining the need for a more incisive bowling attack.India's 18-member squad includes five specialist pacers, two seam-bowling all-rounders, one frontline spinner, and two spin-bowling all-rounders. Chopra believes a minimum of three specialist fast bowlers should feature in the XI.“So I am thinking you should have a minimum of three proper fast bowlers. The fourth fast bowler could be Shardul Thakur for sure, if you wish, and then you can have Nitish Kumar Reddy as the fifth bowler and Ravindra Jadeja as the sixth bowler.So you have plenty of bowling options, but the batting is not compromised,” he explained.Alternatively, Chopra proposed including Karun Nair as a specialist batter at No. 6, moving Jadeja to No. 7 and opting for a four-pronged pace attack — excluding Shardul.Chopra also stressed that the first Test will reveal Gill’s leadership philosophy. “It will be worth watching how this era proceeds in Shubman Gill's captaincy… The Headingley match will decide what our thought process will be,” he said, noting the temptation to play an extra batter due to India's slightly inexperienced batting lineup.",India face England in the first Test of the five-match series starting June 20 at Headingley.

Inter Miami and Al Ahly played to a goalless draw in the opening match of FIFA's new 32-team tournament, with Lionel Messi narrowly missing a stoppage-time winner in front of 60,927 fans at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens on Saturday.Messi's curling shot from 20 yards out in the final minutes was tipped onto the crossbar by Al Ahly goalkeeper Mohamed El Shenawy, denying Miami the victory.The Egyptian side had their own opportunity to take the lead when Trezeguet's first-half penalty was saved by Miami's Argentine goalkeeper Oscar Ustari.El Shenawy made another crucial save in the dying seconds, preventing a header from Maxi Falcon as Miami pressed for a win in the Group A encounter.The tournament opener proved successful for FIFA, with strong attendance at the 64,000-capacity venue and efficient security measures in place.Over 10,000 Al Ahly supporters created an energetic atmosphere, arriving early to support their team, which has won the African Champions League 12 times and the Egyptian league 45 times.The match saw plenty of action despite the lack of goals, with Al Ahly dominating the first half before Miami improved after the break.Al Ahly threatened early when Emam Ashour was denied by Ustari after being set up by Trezeguet.Palestine international Wessam Abou Ali had a goal disallowed for offside and later saw his powerful shot tipped over by Ustari.The penalty came after Telasco Segovia fouled Zizo, but Trezeguet's weak spot-kick was saved, and he couldn't convert the rebound.Miami showed more attacking intent in the second half, with Messi's 64th-minute free-kick grazing the post before hitting the side-netting.""The truth is we leave with the feeling that we could have won it in the second half. Going forward we have to do what we did in the second half, not have any fear, shed whatever baggage we had because when we play like that, we can play even with any team,"" said Miami's Argentina coach Javier Mascherano.""It's a game of mistakes. We had a decent amount of chances in the first half to put the game in a different space,"" said Al Ahly's Spanish coach Jose Riveiro, who took charge of the team specifically for this tournament.""It was like we were playing in Cairo and that was a surprise for me in my first official match with Al Ahly. To be here in the States and have it like you were playing at home is something that can probably only happen in this club,"" Riveiro added.Miami's upcoming matches include facing Porto in Atlanta on Thursday before returning home to play Brazil's Palmeiras on Monday.The stadium operations showed significant improvement from last year's Copa America final between Argentina and Colombia, which had experienced chaotic scenes with fans breaking into the ground due to entry delays.The tournament opening proceeded smoothly without any impact from the controversial immigration crackdown by US President Donald Trump's administration on the heavily Hispanic South Florida community.","Inter Miami and Al Ahly played to a goalless draw in the opening match of FIFA's new 32-team tournament.

'The Sun is on us': Temba Bavuma soaks it in





South Africa captain Temba Bavuma has called out Pat Cummins-led Australia for using the ""chokers"" tag in their second innings of the World Test Championship (WTC) final at Lord's.“While we were batting, we could hear the Aussies using that dreaded word: choke,” Bavuma told reporters after the match.“We came in with a lot of belief and a lot of doubters. We got ourselves into the final, and there were doubters as to the route we took. This win squashes that. Here’s an opportunity for us as a nation, divided as we are, to unite.”Bavuma said he hoped winning the mace for best Test nation would lift the profile of Test cricket in South Africa, where no Test matches are scheduled for the upcoming 2025–26 home season.""We want to play more Test cricket,"" he said. ""We want to play against the bigger nations. So I think this will go a long way in making us a lot more attractive — and also the so-called smaller nations.""Bavuma, the first Black African specialist batsman to play Test cricket for the Proteas, said his side had been inspired by South Africa's Springboks, who have won four Rugby World Cups — including the two most recent tournaments.""This is special for this group, special for myself, for the country,"" Bavuma told reporters.""I have watched the rugby guys, and the biggest thing I admire about them is the way, with their success, they have embraced what being South African actually means.""As South Africans, we are unique in a lot of ways. Our present and future are shaped by our past, and the way they (the Springboks) have gone about things has really captured the hearts of everyone. It's something we've spoken about — to try and do something special.""The captain said his players wanted to achieve the consistent success of earlier South African Test teams, in particular the sides that held the Test mace for three years between 2013 and 2015, as a result of topping the rankings before the introduction of a Test final.""We've said as a team we would like to judge ourselves after three or four years as a group,"" said Bavuma.

While the composer’s post rubbished the marriage talk, he chose not to address rumours about dating Kavya, which intensified after alleged sightings of the two at a dinner outing.The origin of the rumours can be traced back to a Reddit thread that claimed the two had been in a relationship for over a year and that superstar Rajinikanth had spoken to Kavya’s father, media baron Kalanithi Maran , about a possible alliance. The speculative story quickly gained traction and led to multiple media reports suggesting a wedding announcement was imminent.Anirudh comes from a distinguished artistic family.

Lobo Predicted It, Again: South Africa’s Historic WTC Win vs Australia





NEW DELHI: South Africa defeated reigning champions Australia by five wickets in the World Test Championship final at Lord's on Saturday, successfully chasing down a target of 282 before lunch on the fourth day. Aiden Markram 's superb 136 and captain Temba Bavuma's 66 led South Africa to victory, while Australia's captain Pat Cummins acknowledged his team fell short despite being favoured to win against a South African side with fewer star players.Australia initially held a 74-run lead after the first innings, but couldn't maintain their advantage as South African fast bowler Kagiso Rabada delivered an impressive performance with match figures of 9-110.""Things can change pretty quickly. Unfortunately, it was a bridge too far,"" said Cummins at the post-match presentation ceremony.Steve Smith's first-innings score of 66 stood as the only half-century or better by an Australian specialist batsman in the match. Smith's participation in the upcoming first Test against the West Indies in Barbados on June 25 is now uncertain due to a dislocated finger sustained while dropping a slip catch.""We've got a couple of weeks before the first Test in the Windies, so we'll sit down and have a bit of a think,"" said Cummins.""To make these finals, it's normally off the back of being really strong at home, but you've got to win some away series too,"" he later added at a post-match press conference. ""So, in some ways, it's good we get to dust ourselves off and turn around in a couple of weeks and start looking ahead to the next one. That's one of the good things about the World Test Championship, every Test series and every Test match feels like you're playing for something significant. ""South Africa's successful run chase marked the second-highest at Lord's in Test history, behind only the West Indies' 344-1 against England in 1984.""They (South Africa) were fantastic in that fourth innings. There wasn't a lot in the wicket but they didn't give us a chance,"" said Cummins.The match concluded the third edition of the World Test Championship, following New Zealand's victory in 2021 and Australia's triumph in 2023, with India finishing as runners-up in both instances.The championship's format has faced criticism due to countries having the freedom to determine their Test match participation during the two-year qualifying cycle. South Africa played just 12 Tests in the recent cycle, without facing England or Australia, while Australia reached the final after winning 13 out of 19 matches.""They showed why they're in this final and are deserved champions,"" Cummins said of South Africa.Regarding the format, Cummins jokingly remarked, ""I preferred it at the Oval last time,"" before adding more seriously, ""It's something you build towards for two years, it's a huge achievement to make the final, and then a one-game shootout, I think it's a fantastic spectacle.""Australia may need to reassess their batting lineup as they begin a new World Test Championship cycle, particularly considering Marnus Labuschagne's struggles, who averaged only 25.63 in Tests during the 2024/25 season and scored just 17 and 22 at Lord's after being promoted to opener.",South Africa defeated reigning champions Australia by five wickets in the World Test Championship final at Lord's on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: Sarfaraz Khan continued his strong form in England with a blazing century for India A against the main Indian Test squad on Day 2 of the ongoing intra-squad warm-up game in Beckenham on Saturday. While the 27-year-old dazzled with a 76-ball 101, Jasprit Bumrah endured a quiet outing, finishing wicketless in his seven-over spell.India A ended Day 2 at 299/6 in reply to India's 459, with Ishan Kishan unbeaten on 45 and Shardul Thakur on 19. The highlight of the day, however, was Sarfaraz’s explosive ton, laced with 15 fours and two sixes. He was eventually retired out to allow others a hit in the middle — a tactical call that didn’t diminish the impact of his knock.Sarfaraz’s latest hundred adds to his growing reputation in English conditions. He had earlier scored 92 against England Lions in an unofficial Test match, showcasing his talent ahead of India’s five-match Test series against England starting June 20.Earlier in the innings, India A lost Ruturaj Gaikwad for a two-ball duck to Mohammed Siraj , caught behind by Rishabh Pant. But Abhimanyu Easwaran (39) and Sai Sudharsan (38) — both part of the upcoming Test squad — provided some stability.Among the Indian bowlers, Siraj (2/86) and Prasidh Krishna (2/41) made notable contributions, while Nitish Kumar Reddy picked up one wicket. However, India's premier fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah failed to make an impact, conceding 36 runs in his seven overs without taking a wicket.

Temba Bavuma on picking Ngidi over Paterson for WTC Final: 'Tough decision'





South African fast bowler Kagiso Rabada has etched his name alongside West Indies legend Gordon Greenidge as the only two players in the 141-year history of Lord’s to appear on the iconic honours boards in both the home and away dressing rooms. Rabada ’s latest feat came during the World Test Championship (WTC) final against Australia at the historic ground. The 30-year-old delivered a masterclass, claiming 5 for 51 in the first innings and following it up with another four wickets in the second, helping South Africa stay competitive against a strong Australian side.In Test cricket, players who score a century or take a five-wicket haul at Lord’s earn the privilege of having their name inscribed in gold lettering on the famous honours boards - an accolade revered by cricketers worldwide.Before Rabada, this rare distinction belonged solely to Gordon Greenidge. The legendary opener’s scores of 214 not out and 103 for the West Indies against England in 1984 and 1988 are immortalised on the away honours board. Lesser known, however, is Greenidge’s appearance on the home board — a result of his 122 while playing for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against the Rest of the World in 1987.Rabada, too, was already on the away board for his five-wicket haul (5 for 52) against England in 2022.But this time, a unique twist added to the story. As South Africa were assigned the home dressing room for the WTC final, Rabada’s first-innings five-for earned him a place on the home board as well — making him only the second player in Lord’s history to achieve this honour.A piece of sticky batting tape with Rabada’s name written on it has been temporarily attached to the board for his figures of 5-51, as tradition dictates during the match. The gold lettering will follow soon, reported the BBC.Rabada’s achievement is even more poignant given his recent redemption arc, bouncing back strongly after serving a doping ban for using a recreational drug — an incident Australian captain Pat Cummins confirmed his side would not exploit as a sledging tactic. “That’s not our style. I doubt that will come up,” Cummins said before the final.Cricket greats have not held back in their praise. Former Australia skipper Ricky Ponting likened Rabada’s prowess at Lord’s to that of Glenn McGrath, who famously exploited the unique slope at the ground to devastating effect. “Glenn McGrath was exactly the same at Lord’s. He loved bowling there and mastered the slope from both ends — something not talked about as much as it should be,” Ponting told the ICC. “These big games are about big-name players standing up, and Rabada did exactly that. ”Reflecting on his name appearing in both dressing rooms, Rabada called the achievement “cool”, underlining the personal significance of joining such a niche club in cricket’s spiritual home.",Kagiso Rabada has become only the second player in Lord's history to have his name inscribed on both the home and away honours boards. The 30-year-old claimed a total of 9 wickets during the World Test Championship (WTC) final against Australia at the historic ground.

What do you make of India’s bowling attack?

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!



Among the main pacers, only Bumrah and Siraj have played Tests in England, and Bumrah will not be available for the entire series. How difficult is it to plan for a series like that when your premier bowler is not available for the entire series?

Kuldeep Yadav hints at spin-friendly wicket ahead of England Test series

How important is it to give this inexperienced attack a clear plan for the entire series to follow, like you did in Australia in 2020-21 where you didn’t

have the senior bowlers?

You had a big influence on Siraj since his Hyderabad days. He has not had those big spells in Test cricket. He’s been more of a support bowler or a third pacer…

How important is it not to get obsessed with a big batter like Joe Root when you plan for a series?

How important is it for the batting to find a way to score 300-plus scores to give these bowlers a chance?

We lost a Southampton Test in 2018 because Moeen Ali out-bowled our spinners. How important is it to give the spinners as much a role as pacers in England?

There was a time when your management thought that Kuldeep could be the No. 1 Test bowler overseas. What do you make of him now?





As the Indian team’s bowling coach, Bharat Arun was at the centre of the pace-bowling revolution in India. He oversaw the golden generation of fast bowling in Test cricket that gave India some of the most remarkable overseas wins. As he sat down with TOI to analyse India’s bowling attack for the England tour, he emphasised not dwelling on past glory. Excerpts from the conversation…It’s got great potential if you look at Arshdeep Singh. Akash Deep is a very good swing bowler. Prasidh Krishna is doing well. We have depth with two good fast-bowling all-rounders and three spin-bowling all-rounders.I would like to look ahead. Yes, we enjoyed the services of Bumrah, Shami, Ishant Sharma, Bhuvneshwar, and Umesh Yadav. Instead of going to England saying Bumrah will not play all Tests, I see there is a challenge for the other bowlers to rally around him. If they bowl really well and keep Bumrah’s workload levels down, then he has a chance to play all five Tests. If he takes the brunt of the workload, then I’m afraid he will not be available for all matches.More than giving a plan for the entire series, I would look at it match to match because the conditions can vary in England. Also, England have announced the team only for the first match, so the team can also be different. It’s not only about having a good plan. It is also about preparing your bowlers to work towards that plan.It’s a great opportunity for Siraj. He’s got enough experience under his belt. I have seen him bowl some exceptional spells, like the one he bowled in the Lord’s Test, which we won last time. It’s time for Siraj to put his hand up and say, ‘I’m going to be the frontline bowler of our country’. He’s got the skill set. It’s now what kind of mindset he has that is going to be vital. He’s pretty smart. Siraj is someone who can be a captain’s delight who will give his all. It’s good to be aggressive, but controlling it is going to be key. He’s had a good IPL. He looked in good rhythm.Playing at this level, you’re bound to come across great batters. For these batters, the most important thing is the planning for the first 30 minutes. There can be vulnerable zones that all these batters do have. If the planning is right, then you sharpen the axe by execution at practice.The key to being successful in England is to be very consistent and accurate. There are two ways you could create pressure. One is by getting wickets. Secondly, make scoring as difficult as possible. You cannot be leaking runs all the time and expect to create pressure. Also, bowling in partnerships is important. How we hand over a spell, maintaining that pressure so that the next bowler who comes in is also bowling to sustain the pressure is going to be very important.It is an opportunity for KL Rahul to step in and say, ‘let me take the bulk of this responsibility. The onus is on me.’ The captain himself, Shubman Gill, is a very capable batter. Sai Sudharsan has County experience where he’s done very well. Rishabh is the most experienced batter. It will be interesting to see if they can now put their hand up.We have experience in Ravindra Jadeja. England don’t have too many left-handers. It’s going to be either Kuldeep or Jadeja depending on the conditions. Kuldeep, with his wrist spin, can trouble the Englishmen. They would look at Jadeja, who adds value with the bat. This is a relatively inexperienced batting lineup.Earlier, the speeds at which he was bowling were not conducive when he was playing overseas. That is one aspect he’s worked really hard on. Kuldeep is ready now. He’s done exceptionally well whenever he has played at home. In England, there would definitely be some assistance to spinners in the second innings. That is where Kuldeep can be most dangerous.",Bharat Arun was at the centre of the pace-bowling revolution in India.

We love @stephencurry30 so much!!! The best dad in the world. Our babies are obsessed and in awe of him (as am I) and it is such a blessing to watch.

NFL legend Tom Brady marked Father’s Day 2025 with an emotional double tribute—one celebrating his own father and another reflecting on his journey as a dad. The seven-time Super Bowl champion’s message struck a chord across social media, reminding fans why family remains at the core of his legacy. Even years after retirement, Brady continues to lead conversations that go beyond football. With heartfelt posts and rare personal reflections, he offered a glimpse into the values that have defined his life on and off the field.Tom Brady began the day by reposting a heartfelt throwback clip from his youth, where he was asked who his hero was. With a boyish smile and earnest tone, young Brady had replied, “Who’s my hero? That’s a great question. Well, I think my dad is my hero because he’s someone I look up to every day… my dad.” Revisiting that video years later, Brady added a touching overlay to the clip on his Instagram Stories, writing, “Meant it then and mean it more than ever today. HFD dad, ILYSM .”Just an hour later, Brady expanded his message with a longer Instagram post that resonated with fellow parents and fans alike. He included a mix of nostalgic photos—some with his parents, others featuring tender moments with his children.The caption served both as a tribute to his father and a reflection on his values as a dad.“Happy Father’s Day to my dad who taught me everything about what it means to be a father. And to all the Dads out there who are great role models to their kids,” Brady wrote. “My dad has always been my biggest supporter, my best friend, and my number one teacher, not just in sports but in life.”The NFL icon continued by crediting his father for instilling principles that shaped him on and off the field, “The values he passed on to our family — hard work, integrity, compassion and unconditional love — shaped me in every way. Each day I try to live up to the example he set: to be present and to make sure my kids know how much I love and care about them. I’m grateful for every moment and it’s a pleasure watching these three beautiful angels grow up!”Tom Brady shares a close bond with his three children—Jack, Benjamin, and Vivian. Jack, his son with Bridget Moynahan, has often joined him at games and on the field. Benjamin and Vivian, his children with Gisele Bündchen, frequently appear in his posts, highlighting their playful and affectionate relationship. From football tosses to quiet moments, Brady often says fatherhood is his most important role—and his 2025 tribute made that clearer than ever.Also read: “I love that”: Tom Brady praises Caitlin Clark–Angel Reese rivalry, unveils Mount Rushmore of sports icons Brady’s post quickly gained traction, drawing praise from fans, fellow athletes, and parents who saw reflections of their own stories in his words.

J.J. Spaun clinched his first major golf title at the US Open in Oakmont on Sunday, June 16, 2025, with a dramatic 65-foot birdie putt on the final hole. He overcame a challenging start, including five bogeys in the first six holes, to defeat Scotland's Robert MacIntyre by two strokes with a two-over 72.Spaun's victory was highlighted by four birdies in the last seven holes, including a tap-in birdie at the par-four 17th hole where he drove the green. He joined golf legends Jack Nicklaus, Ben Hogan, Tom Watson, and Jon Rahm in finishing with consecutive birdies to win the US Open.""Just to finish it off like that is just a dream. You watch other people do it... you see crazy moments. To have my own moment like that at this championship, I'll never forget this moment for the rest of my life,"" Spaun said.""It's definitely like a storybook, fairytale ending, kind of underdog fighting back, not giving up, never quitting. With the rain and everything and then the putt, you couldn't write a better story. I'm just so fortunate to be on the receiving end of that,"" he added.Prior to this victory, Spaun's only PGA Tour win was the 2022 Texas Open. He had been runner-up at both the Cognizant Classic and Players Championship this year, losing to second-ranked Rory McIlroy in a playoff at the latter event.""I just felt like you keep putting yourself in these positions, like eventually you're going to tick one off,"" Spaun reflected.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? A 96-minute weather delay proved crucial for Spaun after his difficult start. ""I just needed to reset everything, kind of like start the whole routine over. I felt like I had a really good chance to win the US Open at the start of the day. It just unravelled very fast. But that break was actually the key for me winning this tournament,"" he explained.The victory was particularly meaningful given Spaun's personal challenges. He was misdiagnosed with one type of diabetes in 2018, receiving ineffective treatment until 2021 when he was correctly diagnosed with a different type.The morning of his victory had started chaotically. ""My daughter had a stomach bug and was vomiting all night long. Kind of a rough start to the morning. I'm not blaming that on my start, but it kind of fit the mold of what was going on, the chaos,"" Spaun shared.""I was just in shock, disbelief that it went in and it was over. I couldn't even believe what I witnessed when that went in,"" Spaun said about his winning putt.Norway's Viktor Hovland, ranked 14th, finished third at 282 and witnessed Spaun's remarkable comeback. ""That was unbelievable. After his start, it just looked like he was out of it immediately. Everyone came back to the pack. And then the one on 18, it's just absolutely filthy there,"" Hovland commented.""As bad as things were going, I just still tried to just commit to every shot,"" Spaun said.

It’s my first one as a father, and my dream was to have my daughter with me, playing on the outfield at Lord’s, with a winner’s medal on her,” said Maharaj.One of the most iconic images from the victory was of captain Temba Bavuma holding the WTC mace in one hand while his son held the other.“Fatherhood has definitely changed me as a person.

Just a few years ago, cinema in Saudi Arabia didn’t exist, not publicly, not legally. Fast forward to 2025, and Gerard Butler is walking a red carpet in Riyadh, meeting fans, and watching animated dragons soar across the Kingdom Tower.The Scottish actor, known forand, was in the Saudi capital for the regional premiere of thetrilogy, which officially released in UAE cinemas on June 12, 2025. But this wasn’t just another stop on a global press tour.“I’d always wanted to come to Saudi Arabia,” Butler said in an exclusive video interview with. “It had always been this kind of land that was very mystical and mysterious, you know, and now I think that it’s being opened up to the world.”Saudi Arabia lifted its 35-year cinema ban in 2018. Since then, what was once a film-free zone has rapidly evolved into a serious player in global entertainment. The transformation is part of, a national reform plan led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman , aimed at diversifying the country’s economy and reshaping its cultural identity.Butler had already witnessed this shift while filming, his 2023 action thriller, in the sandstone valleys of AlUla.“I loved my experience on. I loved AlUla. It was maybe my favourite location that I filmed on,” he said.But it wasn’t just the backdrop that left an impression. “I just found the people so incredibly hospitable and warm,” he added. “And a lot of young, talented filmmakers that were also on our set, these young students. I think it’s great that it’s opening up to the world.”Before 2018, Saudi film lovers had to leave the country to watch a movie. Now, the appetite is growing, and fast. Cinemas are packed, premieres are turning into city-wide events, and stars like Butler are taking notice.“I love that people are really into cinema here,” he said. “It’s new, it’s fresh, it’s exciting. I kind of wish we still had that more around the rest of the world, because that’s the way it should be. Going to see a movie with a crowd of people on the big screen, you can’t beat that.”The Riyadh premiere of, held at Roshn Front Cinemas, was a spectacle. Fans lined the red carpet. The Kingdom Tower lit up with animated dragons. For a country that once had no theatres, it was a statement.At the heart of theseries is Stoick the Vast, a towering Viking chieftain and father figure voiced by Butler. It’s a role he’s played for over a decade, and one he feels personally connected to.“There’s a lot of my personality in Stoick,” he said. “I think the part of me that wasn’t in Stoick was probably in my beard. So maybe not so much me, because the beard, to me, is the bit that made him more like a granddad. You know, kind of brought him up even another generation.”Butler doesn’t see Stoick as just a cartoon character. When he steps into the costume, even for voice work, it changes something.“When I put on that costume, I became the chieftain of Berk,” he said. “That helmet, and the weight of that costume, and the size of it, it was both challenging. But to fit into it, you needed that power. And that power I grew to feel and understand and enjoy.”What makes Stoick memorable, Butler believes, is that blend of strength and vulnerability.“It felt great to be able to play a character that is so big and bombastic,” he said, “but also to let people into his heart and his soul and his grief and his pain and his joy.”“And yet not abandon the bigness, the goofiness, the fear, the offishness. He’s imposing. He’s powerful. But I always tried to bring in as many colours as I could. I never wanted it to feel like a generalised animated take.”There’s a reasonhas lasted this long, with fans ranging from kids to adults. It speaks to something deeper.“We’re maybe a different generation, I don’t know,” Butler said. “But when I grew up, I feel like there were some pretty deep, intense movies grappling with very challenging topics. And then I think it kind of disappeared. But I definitely think it’s coming back.”, he said, doesn’t shy away from those themes.“I think that’s what’s surprising and grown-up about. It works for, it’s eight to 80, as we say. Because I think it has the kind of complexity of those really interesting themes. And yet you can also just let go and be charmed and amazed and involved with the beauty and the fun of the journey.”","Gerard Butler attended the How to Train Your Dragon premiere in Riyadh on June 12, 2025, as part of his global tour.

2025 highlights: Familiar faces and dramatic falls



Is it just madness or tradition





Every year on a steep hill in Gloucestershire, England, hundreds gather to chase a rolling 7-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down a dangerously steep slope. Known as the Cooper’s Hill Cheese Rolling Contest, the event is chaotic, absurd, and completely thrilling. With participants tumbling, somersaulting, and crashing their way to the bottom, the headline “People sprint to catch a 7-pound wheel of cheese” is technically accurate, but it doesn’t quite capture the madness, tradition, and injuries that define this bizarre British spectacle. So, is it a good headline? That depends on what you’re hoping to convey.The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. Dating back at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize. It sounds simple, but the event is notorious for its steep incline, dangerous tumbles, and frequent injuries.The hill is so steep that it's nearly impossible to stay upright. Most participants end up tumbling head over heels, colliding with each other or the ground.Gravity takes over quickly, and the cheese, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, is almost never actually caught. Still, competitors willingly risk sprains, fractures, and concussions for a shot at glory and a round of cheese.This year, German YouTuber Tom Kopke claimed victory for the second year in a row. Shirtless and triumphant, he declared, “I risked my life for this. It’s my cheese. Back to back.” On the women’s side, Ava Sender Logan from London tumbled repeatedly but emerged victorious, saying, “It felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head. I’m fine.” Around them, spectators packed the woods and fences for a glimpse of the chaos.While the event may seem absurd to outsiders, for locals and returning participants, it’s a point of pride and cultural identity. Despite calls to regulate or cancel it over safety concerns, the contest continues to thrive, drawing international competitors and media attention. Volunteers, medics, and long-time residents treat it as an important local tradition","The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire.

Chet Holmgren addresses ankle injury after Game 4 scare as Thunder brace for crucial Game 5 vs the Indiana Pacers







Chet Holmgren is silencing all concerns just days before Game 5 of the NBA Finals between the Oklahoma City Thunder and Indiana Pacers. After suffering a noticeable ankle twist in Game 4, Thunder fans feared the worst. But Holmgren, who’s played a critical role in OKC’s Finals run, seems determined to push through the pain. With the series locked at 2-2, his health has become a storyline almost as important as the basketball itself.Chet Holmgren plays through pain as the OKC Thunder prepare to regain control at home. In Game 4, Holmgren’s grit was tested early. A hard drive to the rim saw the 7-foot-1 forward collapse, clutching his left ankle and wincing in pain. His reaction was concerning, but what followed spoke volumes about his resolve. As he lay on the hardwood, he looked up to see Shai Gilgeous-Alexander towering over him. The Thunder’s MVP asked, “You OK?” and then gave a direct charge: “C’mon man. We need you. Get up.”Holmgren got up and stayed in the fight. Despite rolling the ankle multiple times, he powered through 37 minutes of action, contributing 14 points and 15 rebounds.Down the stretch, he made the Pacers pay for trying to exploit what they thought was a weakness. Tyrese Haliburton, in particular, found himself settling for tough shots rather than beating Holmgren to the rim.After the game, Holmgren didn’t lean into excuses. Instead, he explained his mindset, saying, “I was just kind of thinking about how to make individual plays that could put us in a better situation. Not try to get a home run or make it all happen at once.” That measured approach helped OKC rally from behind, closing Game 4 with a 31-17 final quarter and winning 111-104.Even after tweaking the ankle again later in the game, Holmgren showed no signs of slowing down. His rebounding dominance has been a constant, leading both teams in that category this series. According to The Oklahoman, Holmgren told reporters at Sunday’s practice that “it’s fine,” while moving without restriction in front of media during open sessions.With Monday’s Game 5 at the Paycom Center, the Thunder once again hold home-court advantage. But certainly, they’ll need Holmgren to be close to full strength to make that a reality.Also Read: Stephen Curry gets heartwarming message from his wife Ayesha Curry on Father's Day: “Our babies are obsessed and in awe of him”","Chet Holmgren suffered an ankle injury in Game 4 of the NBA Finals against the Indiana Pacers.

The Indian cricket team will conduct their final preparations for the upcoming five-match Test series against England through an intra-squad warm-up game against India A, starting June 13, 2025. The four-day practice match, which will be played behind closed doors at the request of head coach Gautam Gambhir, will not be available for live streaming as the team aims to keep their tactical plans private from the opposition.The warm-up fixture will feature 360 overs of match simulation, providing crucial preparation time for both bowlers and batsmen.

The extended session will help players adapt to English conditions before the series opener at Headingley.Jasprit Bumrah's return to Test cricket after a six-month hiatus will be closely monitored during the warm-up game. The pace spearhead, who had to leave the fifth Test in Australia due to injury, has only participated in IPL matches since recovering from a back stress fracture.The team management plans to assess Bumrah's fitness and form by having him bowl multiple spells during the practice match. This evaluation will be crucial in determining his readiness for the demanding Test series.The warm-up game will also help resolve selection dilemmas facing the team. A key decision revolves around choosing a seam bowling partner for Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, with Akash Deep and Prasidh Krishna being the contenders.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Another strategic choice awaits the team management regarding the spin department. The selection between Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav as the primary spinner presents different tactical advantages. Jadeja offers additional batting depth along with his spinning abilities, while Kuldeep could serve as an attacking option against England's aggressive batting approach.The practice match marks a significant milestone as it represents Shubman Gill 's first assignment as the official captain of the Indian Test team. The closed-door session will allow the new captain to work with his team without external pressure.The decision to conduct the warm-up match away from public view reflects the team's focus on preparation rather than publicity. This approach allows players to concentrate on acclimatization and strategy development without revealing their tactical plans to their upcoming opponents.The Test series against England, scheduled to begin on June 20, will be the first major challenge for the Indian team under Gill's leadership. The warm-up match serves as the final opportunity for the team to address various tactical and selection questions before the series commences.The comprehensive nature of the practice match, with its extensive over allocation, demonstrates the team's commitment to thorough preparation. This format ensures that all squad members get adequate time to adjust to the demands of Test cricket and English conditions.The practice match represents a crucial phase in India's preparation strategy, combining the need for match practice with tactical discretion.

""It might not go down as the most attacking or entertaining, but when you factor in the expectation, the stage, and the pressure after failing in the first innings, it was extraordinary.""Praising Markram's mental strength, Pietersen added, ""He lost Rickelton early, yet still went on to produce something truly magnificent. When your country is counting on you and you have to deliver — that pressure is immense.""Pace spearhead Kagiso Rabada , who took a nine-wicket match haul, called Markram a ""big-match player"" and praised his composure under pressure. ""His presence, the way he dominated his space, and stuck to his game plan without wavering was just brilliant,"" Rabada said.""It wasn't a pitch where you could be loose. He handled all their plans, traps — off-side, leg-side — with amazing focus.""Former fast bowler Dale Steyn also lavished praise on the team's performance. ""Rabada, Starc, Cummins — big names delivered, but Markram and Bavuma finishing it off made it special. I'm thrilled for South Africa — they've finally won a trophy they've been chasing for a long time.""He also noted the unusual crowd dynamics: ""Lord's backed us. Maybe the Ashes rivalry played a part, but that support mattered.""","Kevin Pietersen hails Aiden Markram's match-winning century against Australia.

Resurfaced video reveals Michael Jordan’s true pick for the best player



Michael Jordan chooses between LeBron & Kobe





Kevin Durant rarely misses when it comes to basketball—and apparently, not when it comes to legacy debates either. The Phoenix Suns superstar recently came across a resurfaced Michael Jordan clip that’s catching fire again on social media. In the video, Jordan jokingly mentions Durant while weighing in on the infamous Kobe Bryant vs. LeBron James question. Now, more than a decade later, Durant’s sharp but playful response has reignited the conversation, with fans and media alike taking notice.It all started when a throwback clip from 2013 began circulating across social platforms this week. In it, NBA legend Michael Jordan is asked one of basketball’s most heated questions: Kobe or LeBron? Sitting down with analyst Ahmad Rashad for the “Michael Jordan at 50” special, Jordan seemed momentarily caught off guard before throwing out an unexpected name: “Kevin Durant.”Though Jordan immediately laughed and clarified that he was joking—“Naw, I’m just kidding,” he said—the clip has lived on in NBA lore as a light-hearted but fascinating moment. And this week, it got new life when Durant himself saw the post and added fuel to the fire.“Goat was on to something,” Durant wrote in the comments section, flipping the joke into a subtle flex that left fans buzzing. Kevin Durant , who turns 37 this year and will enter his 18th NBA season, is widely recognized as one of the most skilled scorers in league history.The two-time NBA champion and two-time Finals MVP has averaged 27.2 points per game across his career while maintaining an elite shooting clip of over 50%. With that kind of resume, even a joke from Jordan feels like a nod worth keeping in the vault.The moment drew even more attention thanks to another clip included in the video—this one featuring a resurfaced quote from Kobe Bryant that added weight to the conversation. “Kevin Durant. That was the one I retired without being able to figure out how I can stop him,” Bryant once admitted. That rare praise from one all-time great to another only added gravity to Durant’s reaction.The viral interview dates back to early 2013, when Michael Jordan was reflecting on his legacy ahead of his 50th birthday. The special, titled “Michael Jordan at 50,” gave the six-time NBA champion a chance to weigh in on the league’s future—and the players most often compared to him.When asked “Kobe or LeBron?” by Rashad, Jordan initially responded with a smirk and said “Kevin Durant” before laughing it off. Then, he gave a more measured answer.“In terms of dominance of the game of basketball, at this stage it’s LeBron,” Jordan acknowledged at the time, crediting James for his physical impact on the game during his Miami Heat prime.But Jordan wasn’t done. He added a clear preference for Bryant’s mentality and hunger.“Championship-wise, it’s Kobe Bryant . He wants it so bad and he’s willing to go to the extreme,” Jordan said. “Guarding a point guard at the age of 34, playing 38 minutes, 40 minutes, that’s ludicrous.”Jordan even suggested that Bryant shared his obsessive drive for greatness: “He’s cursed as much as I am.”When it came to championships—a standard Jordan always held in the highest regard—he summed it up plainly: “Five (rings) beats one.”More than a decade later, the Kobe vs. LeBron debate remains heated—but the narrative has evolved. LeBron James , who joined the Lakers in 2018, now holds four championship rings and recently became the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, the first player ever to surpass 50,000 career points. His longevity and all-around excellence have kept him in the GOAT conversation.Bryant, who tragically passed away in 2020, remains a symbol of competitive spirit. He finished his career with five rings and a 5–2 record in the Finals, while Jordan, famously, went 6–0.Also Read: LeBron James or Kobe Bryant? Dwight Howard’s shocking pick in the legendary NBA debate between his two former teammates What began as a quick-witted joke from Jordan in a 2013 interview has taken on new life in 2025, especially now that Durant has joined the chat. With Kobe openly praising Durant’s unguardable game, and Jordan once (even jokingly) tossing his name into the GOAT conversation, Durant’s legacy is secure.","Kevin Durant responded to a resurfaced Michael Jordan clip from 2013.
