Ozzie Albies’ Legacy in Atlanta Braves

Thecould be facing a major roster shake-up as general manager Alex Anthopoulos weighs the future of second baseman. Albies’ recent injury and Anthopoulos’ cautious comments have only fueled speculation that his tenure in Atlanta may be nearing its end.On Monday night, the Braves made MLB history by extending their win streak to nine games. But the celebration was cut short when Ozzie Albies suffered a fractured hamate bone in his left wrist.According to ESPN: “Atlanta Braves second baseman Ozzie Albies left Monday’s game against the Washington Nationals due to a fractured hamate bone in his left hand. Albies showed discomfort in his wrist after fouling off a pitch in the third inning while batting against Washington right-hander Konnor Pilkington.”This setback raises questions about his future with the organization, especially at a time when the Braves are already re-evaluating their roster.Earlier this month, Anthopoulos addressed the uncertainty surrounding player options and offseason decisions. His words hinted that Albies’ future may not be guaranteed.“With all these options (on players), we always make the decision at the end of the year - you have five days after the World Series, and that’s when you make the decision.It’s just, things can happen, things change. You always wait,” Anthopoulos said.Atlanta’s struggles this season have not gone unnoticed, and much of the criticism has been directed at the front office. Chase Irle of Sportstalk ATL pointed directly at Anthopoulos’ offseason strategy.“If blame must be assigned, it’s hard to ignore the offseason decisions of general manager Alex Anthopoulos. Atlanta entered 2025 with glaring needs at shortstop, in the rotation, bullpen, and outfield - and none were adequately addressed,” Irle wrote.This lack of depth has come back to haunt the Atlanta Braves, even as manager Brian Snitker remains a steady presence.These gaps have made it difficult for the Braves to maintain consistency, even with strong performances in certain stretches.If this is truly the end of Ozzie Albies’ time with the Atlanta Braves, it would close a chapter filled with memorable moments. Albies grew up in the Braves system, became a World Series champion, and earned the admiration of fans for his energy and consistency.However, Atlanta has shown a willingness to part ways with fan favorites in the past. While it would be a heartbreaking move, it would not be unprecedented.The Braves will have five days after the World Series to make decisions on contract options. Until then, Albies’ future remains uncertain.Also read: MLB Trade Rumors: New York Mets Predicted to Turn to $3,997,500 Star; Cedric Mullins Getting Axed?

Owens went on to play nine seasons as a linebacker before retiring in 1989.But football wasn’t the end of his professional journey.

Owens has been deeply involved in their lives, often coaching their sports teams and focusing on fatherhood after the divorce. Host Jesse Palmer, who visited Owens and his children, described their relationship as “a unique and special bond.”""We were watching the regular Bachelor earlier on. He goes, 'Yeah dad, you should be the Bachelor,' "" Owens said. ""The ad came out for [The Golden Bachelor]. He goes, 'But you should be the real one though.' ""Owens added what his son's special request was: he wants to be standing next to his dad when the women ""come out"" to meet their potential match.""I go, 'Maybe if I get it, maybe I'll pitch it to him,' "" Owens said.Now, with his sons grown, Owens feels ready to open his heart again. He told ABC he’s looking for love built on “the simple joys of companionship — sharing life’s everyday moments, making plans for the future and growing stronger together as a couple.”While Owens admits he doesn’t have one perfect date in mind, he enjoys traveling, relaxing at home, and appreciating life’s quieter moments. As he teased about the upcoming season: “There’s ups and downs, twists and turns. It’s like, whoa, I can’t even believe what just happened. This is an adventure.”Golden Bachelor season 2 premieres Sept. 24 at 8 p.m. ET on ABC, with episodes streaming the next day on Hulu.Also Read: Bills superstar Josh Allen shares his ultimate buffalo wings guide with one shocking underrated choice included","Mel Owens, 66, is a retired NFL linebacker turned sports lawyer.

Inside details of India’s preparations for Bangladesh

TimesofIndia.com in Dubai: Team India might have sealed a comfortable win against Bangladesh, but fielding lapses continue to haunt Suryakumar Yadav ’s men in the ongoing Asia Cup . With as many as 12 catches dropped in the tournament, nine of them in the last two games, questions are mounting over India’s fielding standards despite their dominant run.Varun Chakravarthy, who himself has been at the receiving end of these lapses, admitted that the team can’t hide behind excuses.“As they say, you can't give excuses at this level. As a team we definitely have to start catching all those because we look like we will be qualifying for the finals and we should be taking them,” Varun said after India’s thumping 41-run win over Bangladesh in their Super Four clash.The spinner pointed to the ""ring of fire"" at the Dubai International Stadium as a factor that occasionally distracts fielders.“It comes in the eyesight sometimes and it’s a little bit of disturbance. We have to get acclimatised to it,” he said.Chakravarthy acknowledged that the fielding coach T Dilip will have stern words.“This team has been picked with a mission till the World Cup. We have to pick up our fielding obviously and definitely the fielding coach will have lots to say. Last match he didn’t say much, but this match I think he’ll have a lot to say,” he added.Asked about the surface, Varun felt that conditions were more favourable than in earlier matches.“Compared to the first match wicket that we played against UAE and the other teams, definitely this pitch is a fresh pitch and definitely it looked better, a lot better. It was not too paced, it was coming on to the bat very well.”Chakravarthy himself enjoyed a strong comeback after a testing start. He revealed that subtle changes in how the ball behaved through the innings helped him strike back.“See if you ask me, I was just keeping it the same. It was just that initially the ball was skidding on more and as the ball started getting older, I started getting a little bit more purchase from the wicket. But other than that they definitely played me well in the powerplay.”The spinner also acknowledged the tactical challenge of bowling on pitches where runs dry up after the 10th over.“Talking in spinner’s perspective, if you’re bowling in the powerplay or right after the powerplay, there’s not much help from the wicket. But as the game progresses and as the field spreads out, it’s getting better.”Having cemented his place in India’s white-ball plans, Varun admitted that confidence plays a big role in how he approaches his spells.“In the powerplay the only aim is to look for wickets. It’s just looking for that one ball — if it pitches on that right spot and it turns a little bit, it can edge it. Even if I go for a few runs, my aim is to keep on attacking and try to look for more wickets.”Chakravarthy also gave a glimpse into the work he has put in since the IPL.“Right after IPL, we had the State Premier League, Tamil Nadu Premier League. We played that and after that I got one week break which I definitely went and practiced a lot. Yes, I’ve been working on my batting also. That has been my focus as of now.”India have already cemented their place in the final. They will lock horns against Sri Lanka on Friday.","Varun Chakravarthy says team can't hide behind excuses.

Deion Sanders supports his son's decision to avoid backup roles

Shedeur Sanders’ unexpected fall to the fifth round in the 2025 NFL Draft has left fans and analysts scratching their heads. The Cleveland Browns’ decision to select Dillon Gabriel earlier in the third round sparked widespread debate, raising questions about the team’s quarterback evaluation strategy. ESPN analyst Mike Greenberg voiced his disbelief, highlighting a sharp contrast between public perception and what draft analysts had actually said about Sanders.Speaking on ESPN Cleveland, Mike Greenberg didn’t hold back about his confusion regarding Sanders’ draft position. “There is not one draft analyst, not one who said this guy can’t play at all,” Greenberg said. “The idea that all of a sudden we’ve decided he can’t play, there’s not one who hasn’t rated behind Dillon Gabriel, not one I prepare for the draft.”He elaborated on his own research, emphasizing the thorough study he and other analysts did leading up to the draft. “I start studying these guys. The week after the college football championship game, I did nothing but look at quarterbacks and all the rest of the guys. There is not one person. Go back and find me one draft analyst who had Dillon Gabriel rated ahead of Shedeur Sanders. So I personally am confounded.”Greenberg also addressed the comparisons between Sanders and Gabriel.“And the things that people are saying that Dillon Gabriel does well, processing and all that stuff are exactly the things people were telling me that Shedeur did well.”Greenberg’s statements underline a key tension: Sanders was widely regarded as a top-tier talent, yet he was bypassed in favor of Gabriel, a player analysts consistently rated lower. The Browns’ decision reverberated through the draft community, showing how team strategies can sometimes defy public and expert expectations. Fans and insiders continue to debate whether this was a strategic move or a misjudgment in quarterback evaluation.Despite the surprising drop, Sanders has maintained a professional and focused mindset. He is currently the third-string quarterback for the Browns, behind Dillon Gabriel and veteran Joe Flacco. Analysts like Greenberg have pointed out that Sanders’ skills—decision-making, processing, and leadership—remain on par with or superior to Gabriel, making his limited early-season reps a topic of discussion.Reports indicate that Sanders declined offers from teams like the Baltimore Ravens, preferring not to sit behind established starters. Hall of Famer Deion Sanders publicly backed his son, emphasizing Shedeur’s commitment to starting opportunities and long-term development, which aligns with the young quarterback’s confidence and focus despite being a later-round pick.While the draft outcome was unexpected, Sanders’ potential remains undeniable. Greenberg’s critique highlights that the expert consensus did not anticipate this result, and now Sanders faces the challenge of proving doubters wrong on the field. Each practice and game presents an opportunity to validate his pre-draft hype and showcase the talent that initially made him a top prospect.Also read: Ashton Jeanty enters the NFL with high hopes but struggles early as other rookie running backs make big impacts","Shedeur Sanders was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft.

NHL Trade Rumor: Will tampering allegations affect Kirill Kaprizov and Minnesota Wild talks?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumor-kirill-kaprizov-contract-talks-with-the-minnesota-wild/articleshow/124102855.cms,"Kirill Kaprizov (Credit: Getty Images)

Elliotte Friedman hints at tampering with Kirill Kaprizov



Bill Guerin discusses Minnesota Wild negotiations



Carolina Hurricanes linked to Kirill Kaprizov trade



Kirill Kaprizov’s future with the Minnesota Wild is under the spotlight. Contract negotiations have stalled. Along with sparking rumors, speculation, and even talk of tampering. While the team insists they want to keep their star forward, outside interest continues to grow. The situation is quickly becoming one of the most closely watched stories as training camps get underway.NHL insider Elliotte Friedman added fuel to the fire this week, suggesting that rival clubs may have interfered in discussions involving Kirill Kaprizov. Speaking on Sportsnet’s The FAN Hockey Show, Friedman admitted he could not prove it but believed tampering had occurred. His comments suggest that external pressure may be complicating Minnesota’s ability to finalize a new long-term deal.For Minnesota Wild fans, such speculation is concerning. Kaprizov is the face of the franchise and one of the most skilled players in the league. Any indication that other teams are making back-channel efforts only increases uncertainty around his future.Minnesota Wild general manager Bill Guerin addressed the situation during media availability at training camp.He emphasized the importance of keeping Kirill Kaprizov but remained vague about progress. “These negotiations are private. I can't really get into it. Things are fine. The most important thing is that we want to sign Kirill. He's our franchise player. We want to keep him here. He's a big part of our team. We're working towards that. We're doing the best we can,” Guerin told reporters.The statement did little to ease concerns. While Guerin maintained confidence that the team is doing everything possible, the lack of specifics left many wondering how far apart the sides remain. Kaprizov himself later spoke to the media, stressing that his focus was on hockey and that he enjoys playing in Minnesota.Amid stalled talks, speculation has shifted toward the Carolina Hurricanes. According to reports from Wild insider Michael Russo, Carolina appears ready to pursue Kaprizov if Minnesota explores trade options aggressively. The Hurricanes are reportedly willing to make a major financial commitment to secure his services, positioning themselves as a serious contender in this developing situation.The rumors gained momentum after it was suggested Kaprizov turned down an eight-year deal worth around $16 million per season. If accurate, that signals a significant gap between the player’s expectations and the Wild’s current offer. Carolina, with its cap space and ambition, could step in if negotiations collapse.For now, Kaprizov remains with Minnesota, but the uncertainty grows. As training camp continues, fans, insiders, and rival teams alike are watching closely, whether Minnesota finds a way to lock down its star or risks losing him to a bold suitor like Carolina. This could define the future of the franchise.Also Read: NHL star Connor McDavid’s wife, Lauren Kyle, opens her cottage retreat","Kirill Kaprizov's future with the Minnesota Wild is under the spotlight.

Our predictions and what to expect from this game

The Saudi Pro League returns with a compelling mid-table clash on September 25, 2025, as Al Shabab welcome Al Kholood to the SHG Arena in Riyadh. With just a single point separating the sides Al Shabab sitting at the 11th spot and Al Kholood following in at 12th spot. Both teams will be desperate to tip the balance in their favour and gather some much-needed momentum.For Al Shabab, it’s been an inconsistent start to the season, but they boast plenty of individual talent names like Yannick Carrasco and Abderrazak Hamdallah leap off the teamsheet, however a collective cohesion has been lacking. Their recent 2-2 draw against Abha in the King’s Cup, eventually losing out on penalties, was a perfect snapshot of their season: moments of brilliance marred by lapses in focus. Still, on home turf, Al Shabab remain a difficult team to break down and will see this as a must-win to kick-start their campaign.Al Kholood, meanwhile, have had to battle through a rocky opening to the season. Two early defeats threatened to set the tone, but a spirited 2-1 win over Damak and a follow-up cup victory against Al Bukayriyah have breathed life into their campaign. They don’t have a depth of star names, but they make up for it in grit.If Al Kholdood can keep things tight at the back, which is a big ask given their defensive frailties, they could pose a genuine threat on the counter.However, history has not been on their side. Al Shabab have won all of the last three meetings between the two clubs, each time without conceding. Their superior tactical structure, faster transitions, and clinical edge have consistently proved too much for Al Kholood to handle. It’s a psychological hurdle that Kholood will need to overcome if they are to pull off a surprise in Riyadh.This matchup could be a slow burner early on, but the second half might bring the fireworks. While Al Kholood's recent uptick in form makes them a dangerous underdog, the odds still lean heavily towards an Al Shabab home win.A scoreline of 2-1 or 3-1 feels likely, especially with both sides showing attacking intent in recent fixtures. We can expect over 2.5 goals and a lively atmosphere in Riyadh. This isn't just a mid-table game, it's a chance for both teams to shift the narrative of their seasons. Either way, fans are in for an engaging battle.","The Saudi Pro League returns with a compelling mid-table clash on September 25, 2025. Al Shabab welcome Al Kholood to the SHG Arena in Riyadh.

Tom Brady says his work with Fox Sports and Las Vegas Raiders is not a conflict of interest

Tom Brady calls critics blinded by distrust and insists integrity guides his work

Tom Brady is fighting back against claims that his dual roles as Fox Sports broadcaster and Las Vegas Raiders minority owner are a conflict of interest. The seven-time Super Bowl winner used his weekly newsletter to launch a fiery defense, calling those who doubt him “paranoid and distrustful. ”Brady’s $375 million deal with Fox, signed in 2024, made him the network’s lead NFL analyst. In October 2024, NFL owners also approved his minority stake in the Raiders. That overlap has fueled questions ever since.The conversation heated up again when Brady was seen wearing a headset inside the Raiders’ coaching booth during their Week 2 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers. Critics argued his broadcast access to coaches and players gave him and the Raiders an unfair edge.In “The 199” newsletter, Brady rejected the accusations. “I love football. At its core it is a game of principles. And with all the success it has given me, I feel I have a moral and ethical duty to the sport; which is why the point where my roles in it intersect is not actually a point of conflict, despite what the paranoid and distrustful might believe,” Brady wrote.He added that both roles allow him to serve the game. “Rather, it’s the place from which my ethical duty emerges: to grow, evolve, and improve the game that has given me everything.”Brady made it clear that he views the criticism as more about the accusers than himself. “When you live through uncertain and untrusting times like we are today, it is very easy to watch a person’s passions and profession intersect, and to believe you’re looking at some sort of dilemma. Because when you’re blinded by distrust, it’s hard to see anything other than self-interest,” he wrote.He didn’t stop there. “People who are like that, particularly to a chronic, pathological degree, are telling on themselves. They’re showing you their worldview and how they operate. They’re admitting that they can only conceive of interests that are selfish; that they cannot imagine a person doing their job for reasons that are greater than themselves. (These kinds of people make horrible teammates, by the way.),” Brady said.The NFL confirmed Brady broke no rules by sitting in the booth. League policy allows him to join Fox production meetings remotely but prohibits team facility visits. Still, the optics of Brady gaining insider access to Bears coaches before a Chicago game, when the Raiders were scheduled to play them the following week, fueled the controversy.Chicago Bears head coach Ben Johnson brushed off the concern, saying he was not worried about “trade secrets” getting back to Las Vegas. Raiders leadership has also stood by Brady. General manager John Spytek called his insight “invaluable,” and offensive coordinator Chip Kelly told ESPN he speaks with Brady multiple times per week to go over film and game plans, though head coach Pete Carroll later denied that specific detail.Brady defended his intentions, saying his aim is to improve the game. “If I can bring my knowledge and experience to bear inside the Raiders organization to ensure there’s one more team that does things the right way; and then I can apply it in the booth so millions of people know and enjoy what the right way looks like, then I will have lived up to the expectations I have for myself.”","Tom Brady calls critics blinded by distrust and insists integrity guides his work.

'My job is to play': Haris Rauf stays calm as Pakistan ride out Asia Cup drama

Poll Do you think political posturing is overshadowing sportsmanship in cricket? Yes No

The Asia Cup has once again become a stage for political posturing rather than cricket . Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi has sparked outrage after posting a video of Cristiano Ronaldo making a fighter-jet gesture. The act is being seen as a deliberate provocation and an attempt to legitimise behaviour that has already drawn heavy criticism.This comes on the heels of Haris Rauf’s controversial ‘6-0’ and fighter-jet gesture during the Super Four clash against India in Dubai. Rauf’s actions, aimed at Indian fans chanting “Kohli, Kohli,” were slammed across social media as cheap, classless, and unbecoming of an international cricketer. Adding to the embarrassment, Sahibzada Farhan mimicked firing a gun with his bat, showing how quickly Pakistan ’s players turned a sporting contest into a theatre of political provocation.Instead of calming matters, Naqvi has only worsened the situation. A board chairman using Ronaldo’s image to back such behaviour has shocked fans, who expect administrators to rise above pettiness. Pakistan cricket, instead of focusing on its on-field struggles, is hiding behind provocative symbolism that damages the spirit of the game.While Pakistan wrestles with controversy, India have done their talking on the pitch. Abhishek Sharma ’s sparkling 75 set up a strong total, and Kuldeep Yadav alongside Varun Chakravarthy dismantled Bangladesh to seal a 41-run win on Tuesday. With this result, India stormed into the Asia Cup final, knocking out Sri Lanka and leaving Pakistan to battle Bangladesh in a virtual semifinal for the remaining spot.Naqvi’s actions, however, have ensured that Pakistan’s cricket remains in the headlines for the wrong reasons.",Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi has sparked outrage after posting a video of Cristiano Ronaldo making a fighter-jet gesture.

There was palpable anticipation on social media about whether India and Bangladesh players would skip the customary post-match handshakes after their Asia Cup Super Four clash in Dubai on Wednesday.However, a photo taken by TimesofIndia.com reporter Pratyush Raj from the ground quickly confirmed there was no breach of sporting spirit as players from both sides lined up and shook hands after India’s 41-run win, putting the chatter to rest.The confusion came in the backdrop of earlier incidents when India captain Suryakumar Yadav twice avoided shaking hands with Pakistan’s Salman Agha, first in the group stage and again in the Super Four clash.On both occasions, Surya instead greeted match officials, prompting debate around whether India would extend the gesture to other opposition teams.But in Dubai, Surya and Bangladesh’s stand-in skipper Jaker Ali exchanged handshakes at the toss, and later, both teams followed protocol at full-time.The images of mutual respect offered a timely reminder that, despite fierce competition, India and Bangladesh maintain healthy sporting relations.On the field, India’s march into the Asia Cup final was powered by a blazing 75 off 37 from Abhishek Sharma, who struck six fours and five sixes in a knock full of timing and power. His onslaught, along with cameos from Hardik Pandya (38) and Shubman Gill (29), pushed India to 168/6 despite a mid-innings stutter.Bangladesh’s chase never gained momentum beyond Saif Hassan’s valiant 69. Kuldeep Yadav (3/18) and Varun Chakaravarthy (2/29) spun a web, while Jasprit Bumrah (2/18) nailed his yorkers. The Tigers eventually folded for 127 in 19.3 overs.India’s convincing win means they are the first side to book a spot in the final. Thursday’s Bangladesh–Pakistan clash will decide their opponent, with the prospect of a third India–Pakistan showdown looming large.For now, though, the post-match handshake proves there’s no controversy between India and Bangladesh, just competitive cricket.","India beat Bangladesh by 41 runs in the Asia Cup Super Four clash in Dubai.

Indian teenage cricket sensation Vaibhav Sooryavanshi has set a new record for most career sixes in Youth ODI cricket, surpassing Unmukt Chand's previous mark of 38 maximums.

Former India batting coach and close friend Abhishek Nayar shared a glimpse of Rohit’s new look during a training session in Mumbai, writing, “10,000 grams later, we keep pushing.”The 38-year-old is expected to be back in action on October 19, when India begin their three-match ODI series against Australia.

The two senior batters had retired from T20 internationals last June after India’s T20 World Cup triumph in Barbados and stepped away from Test cricket in May, just days before India’s England tour.Both Rohit and Kohli have completed their mandatory pre-season fitness tests. Rohit trained in Bengaluru at the BCCI ’s Centre of Excellence, extending his sessions to focus on the upcoming ODI series. Kohli, who has relocated to London following the IPL 2025 season, completed his fitness assessments there.With just weeks to go before India’s first ODI in Australia, all eyes are on Rohit’s form and fitness as he aims to lead the team in the three-match series starting October 19.","Rohit Sharma has shed 10 kilograms ahead of his return to international cricket.

India create new record of drop catches: Inside their training sessions with fielding coach T Dilip

Dropped catches in Asia Cup 2025 by teams

12 catches dropped, catching efficiency 67.5 per cent





11 Hong Kong China, 52.1 per cent





8 Bangladesh, 74.1 per cent





6 Sri Lanka, 68.4 per cent





4 Afghanistan, 76.4 per cent





4 Oman, 76.4 per cent





3 Pakistan, 86.3 per cent





2 UAE, 85.7 per cent





India managed a 41-run win over Bangladesh on Wednesday, but the team’s fielding remained a major concern. The side dropped five catches in the match, bringing their tournament total to 12 missed chances, the most by any team so far in the Asia Cup.With a catching efficiency of just 67.5 per cent, India rank second-worst behind Hong Kong China. The game also marked one of the rare instances in T20Is where a single batter saw four catches dropped off them in an innings, a feat previously recorded by Jason Roy, Mohammad Hafeez, Pathum Nissanka, and now Saif Hassan Varun acknowledged the team’s shortcomings but stressed the importance of improvement. “This team has been picked for a mission till the World Cup. We have to pick up our fielding and the fielding coach will have lots to say. Last match he didn’t say much, but after today he’ll have plenty to say,” he said.He also pointed to the challenges of playing under the “Ring of Fire” floodlights and in high humidity. “It comes into your eyesight sometimes and it’s a bit of a disturbance. We have to get used to it. But at this level, you cannot make excuses. We have to take every catch,” Varun added.During the match, Bangladesh’s Saif Hassan was dropped four times at critical moments on scores of 40, 60, 65, and 69. Despite these opportunities, India’s spinners eventually shared seven wickets among them, with Kuldeep Yadav leading the charge with 3 for 18. Varun Chakravarthy took 2 for 29, Axar Patel 1 for 37, and part-timer Tilak Varma contributed to wrapping up the innings. Suryakumar Yadav also effected a key run-out to further restrict Bangladesh’s chase.The team’s struggles under pressure highlight that, while India’s batters and bowlers have been effective, fielding improvements are essential for high-level success.","India managed a 41-run win over Bangladesh on Wednesday, but the team’s fielding remained a major concern.

Bears nominees highlight the franchise's historic impact

Notable omission sparks discussion

The Pro Football Hall of Fame has announced its 128 Modern Era nominees for the Class of 2026, which, of course, includes 12 former Chicago Bears. Such a verbose representation truly sheds light on the franchise's deep-rooted history and continuous impact on the history of the NFL. The nominees are among the great players from different generations, showcasing the type of excellence that has marked the franchise's history and the development of professional football. Whether it be fans or analysts of varying backgrounds, all have been clamoring to see which among these Bears greats will receive his fateful call to Canton in due time.Standout players from different eras round out the 12 Bears nominees. Lance Briggs had a long and impactful career with the Bears, being a stalwart in the defense for over a decade. He is consistently great and always great when it matters. They had a dominant force on the offensive line in Olin Kreutz, who was the anchor of the team's front five for years. The man whose ""Peanut Punch"" changed the way a cornerback can impact the game has to be here on this list, and obviously, Charles Tillman would be on it.Thomas Jones, Brandon Marshall, and Muhsin Muhammad are also among the nominees, all of whom left their respective imprints while with the team. This diverse collection represents the myriad of talent that has filtered through Chicago and impacted the long history of this storied franchise.Also Read: Jerry Jones sends strong playoff message after Cowboys’ frustrating loss to struggling Bears However, even with the legendary list of nominees, this one is a head-scratcher: Matt Forte. That included the versatile running back, who is second in Bears franchise history in rushing yards (8,602) and finished his career with more than 14,000 scrimmage yards. Over nine seasons, Forte undoubtedly made a lasting impression, which is why fans and analysts alike have been left scratching their heads over his absence from the ballot. He was one of the most indelible Bears of his time, with a dynamic style of play and production to match.The Hall of Fame selection process is always taking about who should go into Canton; the Bears' representation reflects the legacy that players from this franchise have left behind.

Bill Belichick may have a new chapter in his personal life with 24-year-old Jordon Hudson, but wedding bells? Not so fast. The internet has been buzzing with talk of an engagement between the legendary coach and his much younger girlfriend, but insiders are slamming the brakes on those rumors. Despite all the speculation, sources close to the 73-year-old coach insist marriage is not on the horizon and they’re even dropping some savage one-liners about why.Back in May, the chatter started when Hudson allegedly mentioned to at least one person that she and Belichick were engaged. Naturally, that set off a wave of gossip, with fans and media jumping on the story. But according to, there’s little truth to it.

Nolan Smith's injury history and expected impact on the Eagles

Eagles make roster adjustments and next steps

The Philadelphia Eagles just picked up a big loss heading into their Week 4 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The team announced on September 24, 2025, that star linebacker Nolan Smith is on injured reserve with a triceps injury. As a result, Smith will not be able to play in at least the next four contests, which includes the much-anticipated matchup with the Buccaneers. Smith's absence is a significant blow to the Eagles' defense, which has relied on his versatility to set the tone so early this season.This isn't something new for Smith, who has faced a triceps problem in the past as well. The 24-year-old also had surgery in February to repair a torn triceps he played with at Super Bowl LIX. Smith had put up 6.5 sacks, 42 tackles, and 24 quarterback pressures through the 2025 season despite the offseason procedure. He subsequently worsened the injury in the Eagles' Week 3 win over the Los Angeles Rams, which is why he was placed on injured reserve.The Eagles' defense takes a hit with the absence of Smith. He has become a significant contributor as a first-round draft pick in 2023, especially in passing situations.His quickness and elusiveness have made him a lethal edge rusher. The Eagles will obviously need guys to step up with Smith out, especially in high-leverage defensive moments.Also Read: Eagles vs Cowboys turns gritty as Landon Dickerson injury shakes Philadelphia’s offensive line The Eagles also announced several roster moves to compensate for Smith's injury. They also added injured reserve corners Jakorian Bennett and WR Darius Cooper. Safety Marcus Epps, tight end Cameron Latu, and cornerback Parry Nickerson were elevated from the practice squad to help fill out the roster. The practice squad also included linebacker Lance Dixon, defensive back Eli Ricks, and receiver Quez Watkins.Moving forward in the season, the Eagles must change things up on defence without Smith around. Expect players like Jalyx Hunt, Joshua Uche, and Za'Darius Smith to step up in the pass rush department. The Eagles' depth and ability to adapt will be put to the test in their next game against the Buccaneers.The Eagles were without Nolan Smith heading into Week 4, proving once again that the NFL season can be unpredictable and star power can't always make the difference; depth is needed at every position. What the team does to respond to and weather this challenge is going to be a huge factor in their effort to remain steady and defend their Super Bowl title.","Nolan Smith is on injured reserve with a triceps injury.

Full practice participation signals Xavier Worthy’s readiness to elevate Chiefs’ offensive firepower

Worthy’s return could provide Kansas City Chiefs crucial edge against Ravens’ defense

After shoulder injury , Xavier Worthy brings speed and playmaking to Chiefs’ offense

Kansas City Chiefs fans are finally getting a spark of hope as wide receiver Xavier Worthy prepares to return to the field this Sunday against the Baltimore Ravens. Worthy, sidelined since Week 1 due to a dislocated shoulder, fully participated in Wednesday’s practice, signaling that his long-awaited comeback is imminent. His return comes at a crucial juncture, offering the Chiefs a dynamic playmaker to inject energy and versatility into their struggling offense.Worthy’s full participation in practice represents more than just recovery—it’s a significant boost to Kansas City’s game plan. The Texas product has been out since the season opener, when a collision with tight end Travis Kelce left him with a painful dislocated shoulder. Coaches have been carefully monitoring his progress, ensuring he regains full strength before rejoining the lineup. Worthy’s return promises speed, field awareness, and explosive potential that could reshape the Chiefs’ offensive strategies.Kansas City’s offense has struggled without Worthy in the early weeks of 2025, often allowing defenses to key in on other top targets. Bringing him back adds a new threat, forcing the Ravens’ defense to stretch coverage and adjust schemes.Quarterback Patrick Mahomes can utilize Worthy’s ability to track deep passes and create separation, potentially opening opportunities for the entire receiving corps. Analysts suggest that even limited snaps from Worthy could significantly alter the dynamics of the matchup.Beyond tactical advantages, Worthy’s comeback embodies perseverance and resilience. Recovering from a dislocated shoulder is a challenging process, and reaching full practice readiness reflects mental toughness and dedication. His teammates are excited for his return, recognizing how his presence on the field can energize the locker room. Worthy’s speed, route-running precision, and big-play capability provide the Chiefs not only with an offensive weapon but also a morale booster heading into a critical Week 4 matchup.Worthy’s impending return against the Ravens marks a turning point for Kansas City’s early-season campaign.

On the occasion of Saudi Arabia’s 95th National Day, football legend Cristiano Ronaldo took to social media to express his deep appreciation for the country he now calls home. His heartfelt tribute not only extended well-wishes to the Saudi people but also offered rare glimpse into his personal connection with the Kingdom, a place he says he and his family have come to cherish deeply.Cristiano Ronaldo, the Al-Nassr and Portugal forward, marked Saudi Arabia’s 95th National Day by sharing a personal message through his official Instagram account. The 40-year-old football star posted several visuals dedicated to the occasion, along with a caption that read:In addition to the post, Ronaldo shared a short video in which he reflected on his life in the Kingdom. Speaking candidly, he praised Saudi Arabia’s culture, safety, and quality of life, positioning it as a top destination for both living and tourism:He highlighted the country's excellent schools, rich cultural heritage, beautiful yet underrated tourist attractions, and its strong sense of safety and hospitality, urging people worldwide to visit and discover what Saudi Arabia truly offers.Ronaldo’s heartfelt tribute goes beyond a simple social media gesture. It clearly reflects a deeper, long-term commitment to Saudi Arabia, which he personally emphasized in a video shared by Al-Nassr Football Club on YouTube earlier this year.In July 2025, following the extension of his contract with Al-Nassr until 2027, Ronaldo made it clear that he envisions a life in the Kingdom well beyond his football career:He went on to describe Saudi Arabia as a “land of peace and safety,” expressing genuine satisfaction with his family’s experience in the country.This includes a strong sense of belonging and admiration for the local community and way of life.Cristiano Ronaldo joined Al-Nassr in late 2022 after a dramatic exit from Manchester United. Since his arrival, he has made a significant impact on the pitch. As of September 2025, he has scored 103 goals across all competitions, including his latest two in a dominant Saudi Professional League win over Al Riyadh on September 22, 2025. The brace brought his career tally to 945 goals, putting him just 55 goals away from the historic 1,000-goal milestone. Watching from the stands, his children and partner Georgina celebrated with infectious joy, a heartfelt scene that added a layer of warmth to an already memorable night.In June 2025, Al-Nassr officially announced the historic extension of Ronaldo’s contract, securing his legendary services until 2027. This remarkable extension will take him beyond his 42nd birthday, a testament to both his extraordinary physical resilience and his relentless hunger for continued success.Despite individual achievements and lifting the King Salman Club Cup, Ronaldo acknowledged that a major domestic or continental title still eludes him at Al-Nassr. But he remains undeterred:His drive stems not from resting on past laurels but from a desire to create a lasting legacy, both in football and in the country he now calls home.September 23, 2025, marks the 95th National Day of Saudi Arabia, a public holiday celebrated across the Kingdom with great enthusiasm. The date commemorates the unification of Saudi Arabia in 1932 under King Abdulaziz Al Saud.This year’s theme is “Our Pride Lies in Our Nature,” celebrating both the Kingdom’s rich cultural heritage and its diverse natural landscapes.Festivities planned in major cities include:All government offices, banks, schools, and both public and private institutions are closed for the day.First officially observed in 1965 during the reign of King Faisal, Saudi National Day became a permanent holiday in 2005 by royal decree under King Abdullah. It has since evolved into a major symbol of national pride and progress, in alignment with Vision 2030, the country’s long-term development blueprint.","Cristiano Ronaldo marked Saudi Arabia’s 95th National Day by sharing a personal message through his official Instagram account.

Ashton Jeanty faces hurdles behind Raiders’ inconsistent offensive line performance

Cam Skattebo quickly becomes Giants’ unexpected offensive weapon

Jacory Croskey-Merritt shines as Commanders’ breakout rookie back

Quinshon Judkins emerges as key contributor for Browns’ offense

Rookie running backs highlight depth of 2025 class in early NFL season

Ashton Jeanty stepped into the NFL carrying enormous expectations. A record-setting career at Boise State and a sixth overall pick by the Las Vegas Raiders made him one of the most watched rookies of 2025. Yet, three weeks into the season, Jeanty has struggled to dominate as anticipated. While he navigates a challenging start, other rookie running backs are already turning heads with standout performances, leaving fans and analysts questioning how quickly Jeanty can adjust to the professional level.The Raiders’ offensive line has struggled to open consistent running lanes, creating a tough environment for Jeanty. In Week 3 against Washington, he carried the ball 17 times for 63 yards, averaging just 3.7 yards per carry. Through the first three games, he has totaled 144 rushing yards and one touchdown. While Jeanty has shown flashes of power and vision, limited blocking and a slow start have kept him from fully showcasing the skills that made him a top draft pick.Fourth-round rookie Cam Skattebo has capitalized on an opportunity created by an injured starting running back.In Week 3, he recorded 60 rushing yards, a touchdown, and 61 receiving yards, demonstrating his versatility as both a runner and receiver. Skattebo’s ability to adapt quickly has made him a reliable contributor in the Giants’ backfield and put him on the radar as one of the rookie class’s most effective newcomers.Seventh-round rookie Jacory Croskey-Merritt has made an immediate impression with his efficiency and explosiveness. Through two games, he leads all rookie running backs in rushing yards, averaging over eight yards per carry. Despite being a late-round pick, Croskey-Merritt’s performance has proven that determination and skill can outweigh draft position, as he consistently gains yardage and provides a spark in the Commanders’ offense.Second-round rookie Quinshon Judkins has also made a strong early impact. In Week 3, he rushed for 94 yards and scored a touchdown, helping the Browns edge past the Packers 13–10. Judkins has consistently gained positive yardage after contact, showing both vision and strength. His contributions have quickly established him as an integral part of the Browns’ backfield and a standout among 2025 rookies.The first three weeks of the season reveal a clear contrast: Jeanty is adapting to professional play, while Skattebo, Croskey-Merritt, and Judkins are making significant early contributions. Their performances demonstrate the unpredictability of rookie development and highlight the talent emerging across the league. Each running back is finding his path, proving that opportunity, adaptability, and execution define early success in the NFL.Also read: NFL sends warning to teams about players joining Saudi Arabia flag football event","Ashton Jeanty, a sixth-round pick by the Las Vegas Raiders, has struggled to adapt to the NFL.

Shilo Sanders gets another NFL shot after Buccaneers exit as 49ers show interest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/shilo-sanders-gets-another-nfl-shot-after-buccaneers-exit-as-49ers-show-interest/articleshow/124091781.cms,"Image credit: Getty Images

49ers bring Shilo Sanders in for a workout amid secondary needs

What this opportunity really means for Shilo’s future

When it comes to the Sanders family, drama and football always go hand-in-hand. Just a few weeks ago, Shilo Sanders was waived by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after a preseason incident that left fans wondering if his NFL dreams were already over. Now, in a twist worthy of a comeback movie, Deion Sanders’ son is back in the mix, working out with the San Francisco 49ers and proving he’s still very much on the league’s radar.According to multiple reports, the San Francisco 49ers recently brought Shilo in for a workout. The team is dealing with depth issues in its secondary, and Sanders was one of the names on their radar as they look to add reinforcements. Now, a workout doesn’t guarantee a roster spot, teams often cycle through players just to keep options open but the fact that the 49ers even called him in shows there’s still some NFL interest in the defensive back.Shilo Sanders’ start in the NFL wasn’t exactly smooth sailing. The undrafted rookie out of Colorado signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers this offseason but didn’t even make it to Week 1. His preseason turned messy when he was ejected for throwing a punch during a game, and the Bucs quickly showed him the door. Many thought that would be the end of his shot but Shilo’s story is turning out to be more complicated than that.Part of the intrigue with Shilo is, of course, his last name.Being Deion “Prime Time” Sanders’ son and Shedeur Sanders’ brother means every move he makes gets extra attention. Fans have watched his college career at Jackson State and Colorado closely, and his transition into the NFL has been just as closely tracked. Even when he struggles, the Sanders brand ensures people are still talking and that attention keeps doors cracked open that might close on other players.So, what’s next? Right now, it’s too soon to call this a full comeback. The 49ers’ workout could be a stepping stone toward a practice squad signing or even a depth role, but it could also end with no deal at all. Still, the fact that Shilo is being looked at by a team as strong as San Francisco shows that his name hasn’t faded from league circles just yet.Also read - Viral AI video shows Bill Belichick and girlfriend Jordon Hudson obsessively making out on the sidelines — fans call it “wild and fake”",The San Francisco 49ers recently brought Shilo Sanders in for a workout.

What preseason opportunity did Kashawn Aitcheson get with the New York Islanders?

Kashawn Aitcheson - Highlights Compilation | 2025 NHL Entry Draft

Kashawn Aitcheson goes back to Barrie Colts for the OHL season



What Waits for a Teenager who Got a Sip of the NHL ? The New York Islanders had Kashawn Aitcheson, their recent first-round draft pick, showcase his skills during preseason action. The young defenseman is heading back to junior hockey now, but not before leaving an impression on everyone: his colleagues, his coaches, and the fans.He was selected 17th overall in the NHL Draft in 2025 and attended two preseason games for the New York Islanders, totalling close to 36 minutes of ice time. He had four shots on goal, one hit, and showed that he could be willing to compete seriously. This style of physical play was appreciated by his teammates and coaches alike, with Alexander Romanov saying, ""he is a great player who hits hard.""After a knee-on-knee collision caused by the Philadelphia Flyers, Aitcheson was feared to have his training camp declared over. Instead, he bounced back to face the New Jersey Devils and showed grit and commitment. Head coach Patrick Roy praised the rookie for his performance, relating his young NHL camp experience to that of his own and stating that Aitcheson would go back to juniors confident in his ability to compete at the highest level.Training camp is now behind him, and Aitcheson returns to the Barrie Colts team to serve as a top-pair defenseman who gets big minutes.He also has some unfinished business; he must serve a three-game OHL suspension for a head-checking call in a September 1 preseason contest. Despite that setback, his future is bright.Going forward, Aitcheson is bound to sign that entry-level contract following this coming season. Should league stipulations warrant, Aitcheson could be ready to strap on the AHL skates by 2026–27, just 19 years of age. Meanwhile, the Islanders' prospect receives a return to junior hockey, carrying valuable experience and confidence-along with the knowledge that the doors into the NHL may soon open for him.Also Read: Donovan Sebrango signs for one year with the Ottawa Senators in the 2025-26 season The brief Aitcheson preseason appearance reminded everyone why he was a first-round pick.

Held at Greensboro, North Carolina, the event took place from September 12 to September 15, 2025. After the successful completion of the event, Sonya drafted an emotional post cherishing the journey of this retreat. A random idea that was planted like a seed turned out to be one of the most successful ventures of Sonya’s life.In a heartfelt post, Sonya Curry acknowledged the individuals who have been associated with her throughout the journey. Starting off with gratitude, Sonya wrote, “Over a year and a half, four of these ladies @dd_jones @lexussafford @triniksherman @weslijones and I embarked on an assignment, the Fierce Love retreat!” The initial team had five members—Detra Snell Jones, Lexus Safford, Trini Kathleen Sherman, Wesli Jones and Sonya herself.With time, more members were added. The idea was initially proposed by Detra, who was Sonya’s cousin. In the gratitude post, Sonya mentioned this and further added, “I thought it was a great idea, though I wasn’t convinced it could happen. After almost 10+ months of planning, we added one more lady @lilbr1t , and the rest is history!” She continued, “I am so grateful for each and every one of these ladies! They remained passionate, committed, joyful, and encouraging throughout the process, even when I grew weary; they anchored me and kept me focused on my calling from God, remaining steadfast to the assignment!”Along with the women who attended the retreat, Sonya also thanked her personal trainer, Katherine Nyhan and other individuals who were associated with organizing the event. Towards the end, Sonya added, “Thank you to @neenpreston @tonyascales76 @tieraperry for assisting with the day-of coordination and Tonya for sharing “Unfinished”by @mandisaofficial which became our FLR Theme song”Fierce Love Retreat is an event that brings together women from different parts of the world.Initially, there were seats for 30 women to join this micro-community. Looking at the response, later on, the capacity was increased to cater to 5 additional women. The retreat weekend was full of introspection, fun and healing through various activities. Sonya Curry believed that each member of the retreat will have something valuable to contribute and this will be of a greater help to the community.The idea primarily stemmed from the book wrote by Sonya, ‘Fierce Love’. In the book, she tried exploring her personal journey navigating through her parenting, career and faith. Sonya believed that these ideologies could be pushed further to reflect on the life of other fellow women professionals as well. The primary aim of this retreat is to embark on a transformative journey together.Also Read: Will Jayson Tatum play 2025-26 season? 6X NBA All-Star gives a promising return update","Stephen Curry’s mother, Sonya Curry, is achieving milestones in her life.

Ottawa Senators forward Drake Batherson ruled out two weeks with upper-body injury ahead of NHL season opener



“pulled something,”

Ottawa Senators’ growing list of preseason injury concerns ahead of NHL season

The Ottawa Senators have been dealt an untimely blow just weeks before the new NHL season begins. Forward Drake Batherson, one of the team’s most consistent performers, will miss the next two weeks with an upper-body injury sustained in practice. While the team is optimistic about his return for the season opener on October 9 against the Tampa Bay Lightning, the absence creates early concerns for Ottawa’s preseason depth.Batherson’s injury was confirmed after he left Tuesday’s practice early, with head coach Travis Green revealing that the forward hadthough the exact cause remained unclear. The timeline suggests Batherson will not appear in any more preseason games. However, the Senators are hopeful he can return in time for opening night. Batherson, 27, hasn’t missed a single game since the 2021-22 season, underlining his importance to Ottawa’s lineup.The loss comes on the heels of Batherson’s strongest campaign in 2024-25, when he registered career highs in assists (42) and points (68), along with 26 goals. His contributions were vital in helping the Senators snap an eight-year playoff drought before bowing out in the first round to the Toronto Maple Leafs.Entering the fifth year of a six-year contract carrying a $4.975 million cap hit, Batherson remains a cornerstone of the Sens’ offense.The Senators’ injury list has been steadily growing throughout training camp. Defenseman Tyler Kleven suffered a setback after crashing into the end boards in a game against the Maple Leafs, while blueliner Nick Jensen and veteran Lars Eller both started camp on the sidelines before gradually returning to the ice. Batherson’s absence adds to the uncertainty as Ottawa attempts to build momentum heading into the regular season.Despite the injury, Batherson had already made his presence felt this preseason.
