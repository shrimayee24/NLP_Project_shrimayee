Jacob Fatu vs Damian Priest vs Drew McIntyre vs LA Knight



Becky Lynch vs Lyra Valkyria

Penta vs Dominik Mysterio

Pat McAfee vs Gunther

John Cena vs Randy Orton

WWE Backlash 2025 was a spectacular show that saw no title changes, amazing in-ring matches, a surprise debut and a controversial ending to the main event. WWE presented their latest Premium Live Event, Backlash, from the Enterprise Arena in St.Louis, Missouri. The event produced some remarkable matches, a former NJPW star making his debut, and John Cena once again using underhanded tactics to retain his WWE title after chaos erupted in the main event.This was the opening match, which was a Fatal 4-Way for Jacob Fatu's WWE United States Championship. The match went all over the ringside and showed carnage as all four superstars used everything to their advantage. Towards the end, heated rivals, Damian Priest and Drew McIntyre, took the fight in the crowd, and Priest delivered a South of Haven chokeslam from a raised platform. Back in the ring, Solo Sikoa appeared to save Jacob Fatu as LA Knight was about to put him through a table. Knight took out Solo, but was attacked by the surprise debut of Jeff Cobb. This led to Fatu to capitalize and hit the moonsault to pick up the win and retain his title.Lyra Valkyria defended her WWE Women's Intercontinental Championship against Becky Lynch. They engaged in a heated combat and delivered a spectacular match. Some spots saw Lynch beating Lyra in front of her fiancé, who was sitting in the front row, and The Man trying to use some underhanded tactics. However, Valkyria managed to roll up Lynch to score the pinfall and win. Right after that moment, Lynch lost it and laid a beatdown on her opponent before walking away.Dominik Mysterio defended his WWE Intercontinental Championship against Penta in a rematch from RAW. Both high-flyer superstars displayed an excellent showing in the ring. Penta fought the interference of all Judgment Day members who came to Mysterio's aid. In the end, Penta's rival, El Grande Americano, appeared and nailed him with the object in his mask. Dirty Dom hit the frogsplash and pinned Penta to win the match.Pat McAfee displayed an excellent effort against a much stronger Gunther in the match. However, the Ring General had dominated him towards the end, which led to Michael Cole leaving his commentary duties to come to his aid. Cole tried his best to assist McAfee, but Gunther managed to lock him in the sleeper hold and win the match. Following the bout, he showed a sign of respect to McAfee before leaving the ring.This was the headliner match for the Undisputed WWE Championship. Randy Orton had the hometown crowd on his side, while Cena went up against Orton with everything he had. The match saw fans erupting in a This is Awesome chant and saw massive chaos towards the end. Orton had multiple opportunities to pin Cena, but every time, a referee was taken out. Moreover, Orton also RKOed multiple WWE officials, including Nick Aldis, who came out to check on the referees. Just as he was about to punt kick Cena, R-Truth showed up to stop him and also ate an RKO. Cena utilized the opportunity to hit Orton with a low blow and hit him with the belt to retain his title.Also read: WWE Backlash 2025 results: John Cena successfully retains the WWE Undisputed title","WWE presented their latest Premium Live Event, Backlash, from the Enterprise Arena in St.Louis, Missouri.

Shedeur Sanders picked off on Day 1, but Browns still see upside in rookie QB



The NFL dream has finally begun for Shedeur Sanders, as the former Colorado standout took the field in Berea, Ohio, for his first rookie minicamp with the Cleveland Browns . While the spotlight was bright and the expectations even brighter, Sanders' NFL debut was a mixture of rough starts and promising flashes.The very first pass Shedeur Sanders threw during team drills didn’t go according to plan.Under pressure from a free rusher, he attempted a play-action pass in the red zone, lofting the ball toward the left sideline—only to have it intercepted by a defender. A forgettable first impression? Perhaps. But for a quarterback known for his 74 percent completion rate in his final college season, this was less about mechanics and more about adjusting to the unforgiving speed of the NFL.Yet, Sanders didn’t let that early mistake define his day.Despite the shaky beginning, Sanders settled in and delivered a performance that revealed why the Browns were willing to bet on him, even after his surprising draft slide to the fifth round at No. 144 overall. Participating in various drills and 7-on-7 sessions, Sanders demonstrated his passing range—from sharp short throws to tight-window touchdowns.Browns insider Brad Stainbrook captured and shared glimpses of Sanders in action, highlighting two touchdown passes during scrimmage plays and several well-placed throws over defenders. Stainbrook later noted that Sanders “looked sharper than Dillon Gabriel,” the other quarterback in the rookie camp, who was selected by the Browns 94th overall.The quarterback competition is already becoming one of the more intriguing storylines of Cleveland’s offseason. Sanders and Gabriel, both entering the league with impressive college résumés, will have every opportunity to climb the depth chart. And while Gabriel got the first reps, Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski made it clear that nothing is set in stone. “I wouldn't look into anything,” Stefanski remarked. “I think you'll see the whole weekend, going through the spring. I mean, we don't pay too close attention to who is in there first.” When asked if the order would change, he simply replied, “I’ll see who.”For Sanders, Friday marked more than just his first practice—it was a statement of intent. Dressed in shorts, a jersey, and helmet—far from full NFL gear—he still managed to showcase glimpses of poise and precision that hint at his potential to grow under center.“This is only the beginning,” Stainbrook wrote. And for Shedeur Sanders, whose college career spanned from Jackson State to the bright lights of Colorado, this beginning may come with challenges—but also a chance to shape his legacy in Cleveland, one pass at a time.Also Read: Despite buzz, Aaron Rodgers not locked in with Steelers; retirement rumors keep gaining steam",Shedeur Sanders made his Cleveland Browns rookie minicamp debut on Friday.

“I have decided to retire from the National Football League,” shares New Orleans Saints quarterback Derek Carr

Fans react to Derek Carr’s retirement from the NFL after 11 seasons

Also read:

34-year-old New Orleans Saints quarterback Derek Carr retires after 11 seasons, the NFL announced on May 10 via their X account. A fan commented, “Are you surprised that Derek Carr decided to retire?” The reason for his retirement is a significant degenerative injury to the rotator cuff of the right shoulder.According to the official website of the New Orleans Saints, “In late March, while ramping up his preparation for the 2025 NFL season, Derek experienced pain in his right shoulder.It was his first time throwing a football at a significant volume since recovering from both a concussion and left-hand injury sustained during play on December 8, 2024. Derek immediately contacted the Saints Medical Team. Eventually, medical scans determined objectively that Derek sustained a labral tear and also had significant degenerative changes to his rotator cuff.”Since the shoulder injury, Derek Carr thought of a pathway to follow after consulting with his medical staff - surgery was an option but it would ruin his 2025 NFL season, and could not guarantee the kind of play he would have as a quarterback post-surgery.Derek Carr shared with the New Orleans Saints official website, “Upon reflection of prayer, and in discussion with Heather, I’ve decided to retire from the National Football League. For more than 11 years, we have been incredibly blessed, and we are forever grateful and humbled by this experience. It’s difficult to find the right words to express our thanks to all the teammates, coaches, management, ownership, team officials, and especially the fans who made this journey so special. Your unwavering support had meant the world to us.”NFL shared an X post with the caption: “Saints QB Derek Carr is retiring after 11 seasons. (via @rapsheet, @tompelissero, @mikegarafolo)”Fans reacted to it with varied emotions. Some expected it, while some did not see it coming.“The Saints future is looking ROUGH 👀”“Are you surprised that Derek Carr decided to retire?”“Doing this after free agency and the draft is nasty work. I love it 😂”“Just when we thought the Saints could have been competitive this upcoming season”“One of the best average QBs ever somehow”“Damn. Rough way to end it”“I’m pretty sure he retired about 2 years ago”“Wow.. his shoulder must be screwed like mine.”“Now he can ride of into the sunset with his millions of dollars“Felt like much longer, 11 seasons is an eternity in football days”“I’ll admit, Saints now have the worst QB room.”“Makes passing on Shedeur seem worse”“This is possibly the biggest surprise of the season”","34-year-old New Orleans Saints quarterback Derek Carr retires after 11 seasons.

Why Game 3 is a must-win for the Boston Celtics (May 10, 2025)

Can the Boston Celtics turn things around?

Theface a critical Game 3 against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden, trailing 0-2 in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. After squandering 20-point leads in both home games, the pressure is on. The biggest question looming over the matchup: Will Kristaps Porzingis be healthy enough to make an impact?Good news for Celtics fans - Kristaps Porzingis will play and start in Game 3.He has no official injury designation, but his recent performances reveal a player struggling with a lingering viral illness.- In Game 1, he played just 13 minutes and failed to score.- In Game 2, he logged 14 minutes and managed only 8 points before exiting.Adding to Boston’s challenges , forward Sam Hauser is listed as doubtful with an ankle injury. His absence hurts the Celtics’ wing depth and removes a key three-point threat off the bench.With Porzingis limited and Hauser likely out, Boston’s rotation will be tested. Mazzulla may need to rely more on small-ball lineups and extended minutes from Al Horford and Luke Kornet.History is not on Boston’s side. No NBA team has ever come back from a 0-3 deficit—teams in that spot are 0-159. The Celtics themselves nearly pulled off the impossible in 2023, rallying from 0-3 against the Miami Heat before falling in Game 7.Another loss tonight would put them on the brink of elimination. After blowing two big leads at home, they can’t afford another slip-up. Every possession matters, and the margin for error is gone.The Knicks are rolling, but Boston still has the talent to make this a series. If Kristaps Porzingis can give them even 20 productive minutes and the bench steps up without Hauser, they have a shot. If not, their season could effectively end tonight.Also read: Will Jaylen Brown play tonight against the New York Knicks?

The rise and rise of India, Royal Challengers Bengaluru star Virat Kohli

On multiple occasions during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, Virat Kohli gave reminders to his Team India colleagues of how 'he is done' with Test cricket .It is understood that not many took it seriously at that time because it was an exhausting tour for the team where Kohli, too, didn't have a good time except a hundred early in the series. In nine outings, he could manage only 190 runs and 100 of those came in a single innings.Down Under, the right-hander struggled after the early high and was nowhere close to the high standards he had set in that part of the world.The next big assignment for the Indian team after the BGT was the Champions Trophy and the highs of the multi-nation tournament pushed the Test discussions back.However, well before the discussions for the England Test tour got underway, Kohli reached out to the Board of Control for Cricket in India BCCI ) and said he wanted to call it a day in the longest format. While it came as a surprise to the men who matter, who had him in the scheme of things at least for England, Kohli had made up his mind.Not just BCCI, even people, who have the best interests of Indian cricket at heart, outside of it want him on that flight to England but the ball seems to be in Kohli’s court now.It is worth noting that Kohli expressed desire to lead the side again but it wasn't entertained by the BCCI as they had an eye on the future, and wanted to groom a young leader for the new World Test Championship cycle. As TimesofIndia.com had reported, Shubman Gill was earmarked as the leader for the future as the Indian cricket board didn't want to look back as far as captaincy is concerned.""A new WTC cycle is starting. Future and continuity has to be kept in mind as far as the team is concerned. Even coach Gautam Gambhir would want a set of players he is likely to work with for an extended period.

Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

Rohit Sharma’s last press conference as a captain

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma ’s decision to step away from Test cricket has sparked widespread debate, and former cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar didn’t hold back when weighing in.Taking to his official ‘X’ handle, Manjrekar pointed to Rohit’s recent slump and waning fitness as key reasons why the decision made sense.“164 in his last 15 innings. Out of which 10 were at home v Bangladesh & NZ.Average 10.9. With his current fitness levels… Rohit Sharma’s days as Test opener were over. So…” Manjrekar posted, summarising his view with stark clarity.Rohit, 38, officially announced his Test retirement on Wednesday via Instagram. In a brief but heartfelt note, he wrote, “It’s been an absolute honour to represent my country in whites.

IPL 2025 suspended: What happens next?

‘Bombs Are Coming’: India-Pak Aerial Clash Sparks Panic During IPL; Chilling Video from Dharamsala

The Board of Control for Cricket in India has suspended the Indian Premier League , with 16 games remaining, due to escalating conflict between India and Pakistan, and England has emerged as a potential host for the final stages of the tournament. The BCCI will prioritise hosting the remaining matches in India if security concerns are resolved, but the England and Wales Cricket Board is open to discussions about hosting if approached.ECB chief executive Richard Gould confirmed England would be willing to step in if needed.“We will help our counterparts at the BCCI where we can,” he was quoted as saying by English media outlet Mail Online.The initial postponement is for a week , following consultations with the 10 franchises who expressed concerns about player safety, broadcaster views, and fan sentiments.Former England captain Michael Vaughan suggested completing the IPL in the UK before India's Test series against England begins on June 20.""I wonder if it's possible to finish the IPL in the UK,"" Vaughan wrote on X. ""We have all the venues and the Indian players can then stay on for the Test series… Just a thought?""The timing of the remaining matches presents a significant challenge. Hosting the tournament before India's Test tour would require quick agreements between the BCCI, ECB, and English venues, complicated by ongoing domestic cricket schedules.Another possibility is rescheduling IPL games for September during the Asia Cup window , which is unlikely to proceed.England's schedule includes South Africa white-ball series from September 2 to 14, suggesting the IPL could potentially resume in England afterward, utilising grounds not needed for the County Championship.A potential clash with England's three-match T20 tour of Ireland from September 17-21 is considered less problematic.Devajit Saikia, the BCCI's honorary secretary, confirmed the decision to suspended the league was made after consultation with franchises who ""conveyed the concern and sentiments of their players, and also the views of the broadcaster, sponsors and fans.""The BCCI released a strong statement of national solidarity: ""At this critical juncture, the BCCI stands firmly with the nation. We express our solidarity with the government of India, the armed forces and the people of our country. The Board salutes the bravery, courage, and selfless service of our armed forces, whose heroic efforts under Operation Sindoor continue to protect and inspire the nation, as they lead a resolute response to the recent terrorist attack and the unwarranted aggression by Pakistan's armed forces.""The statement continued: ""While cricket remains a national passion, there is nothing greater than the nation and its sovereignty, integrity, and security of our country. The BCCI remains firmly committed to support all efforts that safeguard India and will always align its decisions in the best interest of the nation.""",The Indian Premier League has been suspended due to security concerns.

San Jose Sharks secure Mattias Hävelid with three-year contract to bolster their defensive lineup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/san-jose-sharks-secure-mattias-hvelid-with-three-year-contract-to-bolster-their-defensive-lineup/articleshow/121040040.cms,"Mattias Hävelid signs a three-year deal with the San Jose Sharks (Image via: X)

A rising NHL defenseman with potential for the San Jose Sharks?



International success raises expectations but NHL transition remains uncertain for Hävelid



The San Jose Sharks are stirring up the NHL waters once again, making headlines with the announcement of their newest signing: defenseman Mattias Hävelid . At just 21 years old, Hävelid has been carving out a name for himself in Sweden, and now, he's making the leap to the NHL after penning a three-year, entry-level contract with the Sharks. But is this a masterstroke of scouting or another risky gamble by a franchise in need of serious revamping?Mattias Hävelid’s résumé is undeniably impressive for someone of his age.In his recent season with Linköping HC and Djurgårdens IF, Hävelid racked up solid numbers, finishing as one of the top contributors on the blue line. He logged 14 points, including two goals and 12 assists, for Djurgårdens, and helped lead them to a HockeyAllsvenskan Championship with an impactful postseason performance. His success at both ends of the rink in Sweden raises one burning question: Is he ready to translate this success into the NHL?Hävelid’s experience in the Swedish Hockey League (SHL) shows promise, with 43 games under his belt and a tally of 12 points. The defenseman’s offensive upside, combined with his ability to play both power play and penalty kill roles, makes him a versatile asset. But here’s the kicker: the SHL is not the NHL. The level of competition, the speed, and the physicality differ drastically. Hävelid’s size, standing at 5’10” and weighing 176 pounds, could also be a factor in whether he can withstand the grind of North American hockey, where larger, more aggressive players dominate.The Sharks have been rebuilding for some time now, and Hävelid's signing looks like part of that long-term plan. But this isn’t the first time San Jose has taken a shot on an international prospect who hasn't quite proven themselves on the big stage. Are the Sharks making the right bet, or is this just another misstep in their roster construction?Hävelid’s international experience with Sweden's U-18 and U-20 teams certainly suggests a bright future. He was instrumental in Sweden’s gold medal-winning campaign at the 2022 U-18 World Juniors, leading all defensemen in goals, assists, and points. His silver medal at the 2024 World Juniors, where he finished among the top contributors in assists and points, further elevates his profile.However, translating that international success into the NHL is no guarantee. The transition from junior hockey to the pros is a monumental one, and Hävelid's development will be heavily scrutinized over the next few seasons.Also Read: Oilers lean on depth and drama to snatch Game 2 from Vegas With the Sharks in need of a solid defenseman to build their future around, Hävelid may be their guy, if he can adjust to the league’s demands quickly. But with their franchise in flux, fans may be left wondering: Will this gamble pay off, or will the Sharks be left wishing for a better defensive prospect? Time will tell, but the pressure is on.","Mattias Hävelid, 21, signs a three-year deal with the San Jose Sharks. The defenseman has been carving out a name for himself in the Swedish Hockey League.

Madhura Dhamangaonkar spearheaded India’s medal success with three podium finishes in the Shanghai Archery World Cup Stage 2 on Saturday. India’s compound archers achieved their highest medal count, with Madhura, from Amravati in Maharashtara, securing individual women’s gold, women’s team silver and mixed team bronze.Indian archers dominated the penultimate day, collecting five of the 15 medals on offer, while Turkiye and Mexico followed with three and two medals respectively.While Madhura won her career’s first international gold medal,veteran Abhishek Verma and Rishabh Yadav won a couple of medals as the compound archers concluded the event with two gold, a silver, and two bronze medals.The day began with disappointment as the women’s team of Jyothi Surekha Vennam, Madhura and Chikitha Taniparthi fell to Mexico 222234 in the final. The Indian men’s team of Abhishek Verma, Rishabh Yadav and Ojas Deotale, however, outplayed Mexico 232-228 in the title clash. India’s first gold in Shanghai was followed by the mixed team bronze medal when the duo of Madhura and Verma prevailed over Malaysia 144-142.India’s hat-trick of morning medals set the stage for young Madhura’s afternoon show. On her return to the Indian team after three years, the 24-year-old delivered a stellar performance with a careerbest 708 points in the qualification round, thereafter reaching the semifinals.Facing Turkiye’s world No.13 Hazal Burun in the semifinal, Madhura started strongly and took an early four-point lead (60-56) with back-to-back perfect scores of 30. The Amravati girl, who practises under Pravin Sawant at Satara’s Drushti Archery Academy, finished well to surprise the two-time World Cup medallist 143-141 to set her individual women’s title clash with USA’s Carson Krahe.In the final, Madhura rallied from 81-85 down in the third end to bring parity at 110 in the fourth set and produced her second successive 29s in the final round to get the better of Krahe 139-138 for her maiden international gold.Madhura was elated with her performance and said, “I took this as a challenge. My intention was to take the bow and hit a 10 with confidence. I have been working on my mental strength and my shooting skills, and that’s the reason I could perform better. Happy to start the year on a positive note and can say this is the big turning point of my career.”Much like Madhura, Haryana’s Rishabh Yadav clinched his maiden World Cup medal when the 22-yearold registered a thrilling shoot-off win over South Korea’s Kim Jongho in the men’s individual bronze play-off. Despite losing his semifinal contest to World No. 1 and eventual champion Mike Schloesser of Netherlands 143-149, Yadav remained positive during his bronze medal match.On Sunday, India will be in the hunt for two more medals. Recurve archers Parth Salunkhe and Deepika Kumari will fight it out in the semis.","Madhura Dhamangaonkar won her career’s first international gold medal.

India's probable Test squad for England Tour

Shami's Test future in doubt

Virat Kohli has not yet clarified to the Indian cricket board (BCCI) whether he is amenable to touring England for the upcoming five-Test series, after having communicated his wish to call time on a stellar red-ball career.has learnt that Kohli, after having received a request from the board to reconsider his decision — in the wake of Rohit Sharma also retiring from the format ahead of what will be a crucial series — has not backed down from his stand.Sources, however, said the BCCI and the selection committee are still trying to convince him to tour and shore up India’s inexperienced middle-order on such an important tour.“Kohli had informed the selectors two weeks ago (about his desire to quit Tests). They were trying to persuade him to play in the Test series against England. However, he is still firm on his stance. The final call will come close to the selection meeting next week,” sources said.Kohli has had a stellar Test career but has struggled in the format in recent times. In Australia late last year, the repetitive manner of his dismissals — caught fishing outside off stump — even raised questions about whether he still deserved a permanent place in the side.Despite his recent struggles and prolonged dip in form, the selectors are keen that he be present in India’s squad in England to lend experience to a new-look team in which Shubman Gill has emerged as the likely frontrunner for the captain’s post.Kohli’s unavailability, if it comes to pass, could present a new headache for the selectors regarding his replacement at No. 4 in the batting order. If Kohli doesn’t budge, the selectors may be forced to look at either Shreyas Iyer or Karun Nair as likely replacements.Meanwhile, Rajat Patidar has emerged as a strong contender to replace Sarfaraz Khan in the squad.The selectors may be forced to take a tough call on veteran pacer Mohammed Shami. TOI has learnt that there are serious concerns about Shami’s form and fitness and his ability to endure the rigours of Test cricket following a long injury-enforced layoff. India’s frontline pace lineup is looking shaky, with workload concerns surrounding Jasprit Bumrah adding to the worries.“As of now, Shami isn’t an automatic pick. It’s been months since he has come back to international cricket but he has barely been in rhythm. While IPL performances are not usually considered while picking India teams, Shami is struggling to finish his run-up and the ball is not carrying to the wicketkeeper like it used to before his Achilles tendon injury after the 2023 ODI World Cup. He invariably goes back to the dressing room after a short spell for recovery,” BCCI sources said.The selectors, it is understood, are expecting to get Bumrah’s services on the tour for two or three Tests only. In such a scenario, they were pinning their hopes on 35-year-old Shami to perform. “The initial plan was to ensure the team can at least play either of Shami or Bumrah in every Test. However, if Bumrah is rested for a match and Shami struggles to pull through, it will be a big issue. They are trying to understand the problem Shami may be facing,” sources said.Selectors are also concerned about Mohammed Siraj not being able to step up as lead pacer in Bumrah or Shami’s absence. The England tour could also be a makeor-break one for him.There are also talks about choosing between left-arm pacers Arshdeep Singh, Khaleel Ahmed and Yash Dayal. While Arshdeep has shown his potential to swing the ball both ways, it’s his lack of first-class experience that could pose a problem.",Virat Kohli has not yet clarified to the Indian cricket board (BCCI) whether he is amenable to touring England for the upcoming five-Test series.

World number one tennis player Jannik Sinner made a successful return to tennis at the Italian Open in Rome on Saturday, following a three-month doping ban , with a straight-sets victory over Mariano Navone in front of over 10,000 enthusiastic fans at the Foro Italico.Sinner dominated the match, winning 6-3, 6-4, while being cheered on by supporters dressed as carrots and wearing orange clothing in tribute to his ginger hair.The Italian player's absence began in February after testing positive twice for traces of banned substance clostebol. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accepted that Sinner had been accidentally contaminated by his physiotherapist, with no evidence of intentional cheating.""It has been amazing to go again on court after such a long time, having a great support also in the last days. From the first day I came here, it has been amazing,"" Sinner told reporters.""That means much more than any result, to be honest. It has been an amazing feeling to come here, starting from the first practices with other players.""Sinner acknowledged experiencing pre-match anxiety about his comeback performance.""I have doubts. I had doubts before going on court today. I have doubts now what's going to happen in the next match,"" said Sinner. ""But we have to live with doubts because it means that you really care, that you want to improve, that you want to show yourself, that you want to do something special.""The Italian player emphasized his focus on regaining his best form in Rome, having previously stated that the French Open later this month was his main target.""I feel like we prepared in the best possible way. Of course, I was missing the feedback of official matches, which are the best feedbacks we player can get,"" he said.""At least now I have a bigger picture of what I'm doing well and what I have to improve. Of course, the nerves and everything, it has to go again into my body, trying to understand what we can do better the next round.""""But yeah, hopefully I can play here one or two matches more to see where I am at, which would be my main goal.

NEW DELHI: Alexander Sorloth netted four goals during the initial half-hour period, guiding Atletico Madrid towards a commanding 4-0 triumph against Real Sociedad in La Liga on Saturday.The Norwegian striker's quartet of goals ensured Atletico strengthened their position in third, whilst La Real dropped to 12th spot.Sorloth achieved his hat-trick within the first 11 minutes, setting a new La Liga record.This surpassed previous achievements from 1929 and 1941, when Europa's Carles Bestit and Valencia's Mundo scored their trebles by the 15th minute.Diego Simeone , Atletico's manager, has typically utilised Sorloth as a substitute this season. However, the 29-year-old demonstrated his capabilities when given a starting role with an impressive opening display.The ex-Real Sociedad forward dismantled his former club, opening his account at seven minutes with a precise finish from Pablo Barrios' delivery.Three minutes later, Sorloth struck again, sending a powerful shot from the box's edge beyond Alex Remiro's reach.His third goal, arriving in the 11th minute, resulted from poor Real Sociedad defending, allowing him an easy finish from close range.The 30th minute saw Sorloth complete his scoring spree, converting Javi Galan's low cross with authority.Previously, Villarreal sustained their Champions League qualification pursuit with a narrow 1-0 victory at Girona.The Yellow Submarine, positioned fifth with five teams qualifying, secured three points through Karl Etta Eyong's 89th-minute header at Montilivi against struggling Girona.The Catalan side were without their manager Michel Sanchez, who remains in hospital for observation as a ""precaution"", according to Girona's Friday announcement, regarding an unspecified condition.Despite controlling proceedings, Villarreal only broke through when Alfonso Pedraza's cross found Cameroon-born midfielder Eyong.The win places Villarreal alongside fourth-placed Athletic Bilbao on 61 points, maintaining a four-point advantage over sixth-placed Real Betis, who face Osasuna on Sunday.Mallorca, ninth-placed, maintained their European qualification hopes by defeating relegated Real Valladolid 2-1.Sunday's fixture sees league leaders Barcelona confront second-placed Real Madrid in a crucial Clasico that could determine the Spanish championship outcome.","Atletico Madrid defeated Real Sociedad 4-0 in La Liga on Saturday.

A timeless tribute to a Mother’s love and unshakable strength that shapes us all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/a-timeless-tribute-to-a-mothers-love-and-unshakable-strength-that-shapes-us-all/articleshow/121071516.cms,"Mother’s Day gives us a reason to pause, in the middle of our busy lives, and look back at the one relationship that shaped us the most: the bond between a mother and her child.Thinking about motherhood, we think about patience, sacrifice, and strength. We think about the countless ways mothers build lives, often quietly, often invisibly, without ever asking for anything in return.As a doctor, I have had the privilege of seeing this love up close, in hospital wards, in waiting rooms, in hospice care, and even at home visits. A mother’s love shines through in a way that no medicine, no intervention, and no therapy can replicate.There is something universal about mothers.Across languages, across cultures, across time, the word “mother” carries a kind of weight and emotion that nothing else does.Even when patients are at their most vulnerable, whether they are five years old or eighty, it is often their mothers they call out for. Sometimes in words, sometimes simply in their eyes. It is one of the purest truths I have seen in my profession, we never really outgrow our need for a mother’s comfort.Motherhood is not just biological. It is a lifelong commitment to nurturing, worrying, guiding, and loving, even when it is inconvenient, even when it is exhausting.Mothers stay awake by a hospital bed for days without complaint. Elderly mothers continue to worry about their adult children, even when they themselves face the end of life. Mothers who lost their children carry on with unimaginable strength, finding ways to keep their child’s memory alive by helping others.It is humbling. No matter how much science advances, the most powerful healer in the world remains love, and very often, a mother’s love.On Mother’s Day, we celebrate all these silent sacrifices. But one day is not enough. Every day should be a chance to honor the mothers in our lives, whether it is our own mother, a grandmother, a mentor, a caregiver, or any woman who has played the role of a nurturer for us.In our busy lives, we sometimes forget to be thankful. We take for granted the comforting voice on the other end of the phone, the endless patience with which our smallest worries are heard, the quiet faith that someone has in our dreams, even when we doubt ourselves. Today is a reminder to say the things we sometimes leave unsaid.To the young mothers who are just beginning their journey, raising children in a complex and fast-changing world, your role is not easy, but it is vital. To the mothers who are watching their children grow up and move away, building lives of their own, I salute your grace and courage.To the elderly mothers who have spent a lifetime giving, and who now sometimes find themselves needing care, you remind us that love is never one-way. You have given the world so much, and you deserve nothing less than dignity, respect, and deep gratitude.Motherhood also teaches us about resilience. It teaches us that true strength is not in shouting the loudest, but in carrying on quietly, doing what needs to be done even when no one is watching. It teaches us about forgiveness, about unconditional acceptance, and about the kind of hope that never gives up, even in the darkest times.In my own life and work, I owe a great debt to the mothers who have shown me what true courage looks like. They have taught me that healing is not only about medicines and treatments. It is about listening, about caring, about being present. Lessons that I carry with me every day.On this Mother’s Day, let’s not just send flowers and gifts. Let’s offer our time, our attention, and our gratitude. Let’s tell the mothers in our lives that we see them, that we appreciate them, and that we love them. Not just today, but every day.Because a mother’s love is not seasonal. It is constant. It shapes who we are, and it continues to guide us long after we have grown. Happy Mother’s Day to every mother, everywhere. Thank you for everything you do, seen and unseen.","Mother’s Day gives us a reason to pause, in the middle of our busy lives, and look back at the one relationship that shaped us the most: the bond between a mother and her child. As a doctor, I have had the privilege of seeing this love up close, in hospital wards, in waiting rooms, in hospice care, and even at home visits. No matter how much science advances, the most powerful healer in the world remains love, and very often, a mother's love.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121071575,imgsize-40576,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/121071575.jpg"

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

A 5.7-magnitude earthquake struck Pakistan on Saturday morning, Reuters reported. The tremor occurred just hours after a 4.0-magnitude quake had hit the region.Shallow earthquakes tend to be more dangerous than deeper ones because their seismic waves have a shorter distance to travel to the Earth's surface. This results in stronger ground shaking, increasing the potential for structural damage and higher casualties.Pakistan is among the most seismically active countries in the world due to its position along the boundary between the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. The ongoing collision between these plates generates frequent and often destructive seismic activity.Several major fault lines run through the country, further heightening its vulnerability. The provinces of Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, and the former FATA lie on the southern edge of the Eurasian Plate, while Sindh, Punjab, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir sit on the north-western edge of the Indian Plate.",Shallow earthquakes tend to be more dangerous than deeper ones because their seismic waves have a shorter distance to travel to the Earth's surface.

What’s the tile game Meghan Markle played on Netflix? A beginner’s guide to mahjong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/whats-the-tile-game-meghan-markle-played-on-netflix-a-beginners-guide-to-mahjong/articleshow/120736644.cms,"Meghan Markle played the game of Mahjong in her Netflix series

From the Qing dynasty to pop culture

How is mahjong played?

Connor Wan, a 29-year-old British-Chinese artist, learned mahjong while visiting family in Hong Kong. He enjoyed it so much that he started the Four Winds Mahjong Club in London, and later brought it to Toronto after moving there in 2024. “Moving countries is hard, especially when you don’t know anyone,” he said. The club became popular quickly, not as a place for gambling, but for making friends and celebrating Asian culture. Nicole Wong, a writer and audio producer from California, started playing mahjong as a teenager with her grandparents. She later began The Mahjong Project in 2019 to share the game’s cultural stories and organise pop-up game nights. This year, she published a book called Mahjong: House Rules from Across the Asian Diaspora. Nicole says the sound of the tiles is especially powerful. “Mahjong is more than just fun,” she says. “It has a deep history and brings back strong memories.” In Toronto, Robyn Feldberg has taught over 250 people how to play mahjong through her courses. She donates all the money—about $50,000 so far—to charities like Save A Child’s Heart. She says the game is especially popular with young mothers who want a fun way to relax and connect with others. “They tell me, ‘We want something that’s just for us,’” she said.

A centuries-old Chinese game called mahjong is having a modern revival across continents, from luxury cruise ships and trendy hotel lounges to Meghan Markle’s Netflix series.In the sixth episode of her docuseries With Love, the Duchess of Sussex invites friends for a cosy game night – playing mahjong, reports the Globe and Mail.The four-person tile-based game, traditionally associated with Chinese culture, is now catching on with new generations across the globe. “The game itself is really so fun,” says Markle. “But what was so great was the idea of learning something new with your friends, together... the mahjong becomes the background of the expansion of friendship. It’s the feeling of community.”Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China. Traditionally played with 144 tiles, the game blends skill, strategy and a touch of luck. Players pick and discard tiles to form winning hands, much like the card game rummy.The game’s expansion across the world has now erupted into a full-blown trend. The World Mahjong Championship was recently held in Mississauga, Ontario – the first time it’s been hosted in North America. Hotels such as the Ace Hotel New York and Thompson Hotel Dallas regularly hold mahjong-themed nights.Fans with money to spare are buying fancy mahjong sets from Hermès, Louis Vuitton, and Ralph Lauren. Some are even splashing out on luxury tables that shuffle the tiles automatically – costing over $4,500.Even cruise ships have joined the trend, offering mahjong tournaments and special rooms just for playing the game.Mahjong is played with 144 tiles. Players begin by shuffling the tiles face down. Everyone rolls dice and the highest roller becomes the dealer. Each player picks 36 tiles and builds a wall—two rows of 18 tiles. The walls are pushed forward, creating a space in the middle for discards. Each player then draws 13 tiles (the dealer starts with 14), and the game begins.Players take turns drawing one tile and discarding one, always keeping 13 tiles in hand. You can draw a new tile or pick up someone’s discarded one. If a discarded tile helps complete a set (called a meld), you can grab it, announce the set, and show the tiles. To win, a player must have four melds (like three or four matching tiles or a sequence of three in a suit) and one pair (two matching tiles)—making 14 tiles total.There are five types of tiles: Bamboo, Characters, Dots (these are the three main suits), and special tiles called Honors (Dragons and Winds) and Bonus (Flowers and Seasons). Each suit goes from 1 to 9. Honors and Bonus tiles add extra excitement but aren't needed to win. Mahjong mixes strategy and memory with a bit of luck—and it’s all about building the right sets before your opponents do.For many mahjong fans, it’s not just a game but a deeply social experience.","Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China.

LONDON: Over 30 years after Britain's elite Magic Circle expelled a woman for posing as a man to gain admittance, the formerly male-only society is to welcome her back as a full member.The London-based international magic organisation ejected Sophie Lloyd after she masqueraded as a male in 1991 to win membership.But after her story came to light last year, the society's first female chair Laura London launched a search to track down Lloyd and apologise.She was eventually located living abroad and will later on Thursday be presented with a membership certificate at a special ceremony at the organisation's London headquarters.""It is so exciting after all these months tracking Sophie... I can't tell you how happy we are as a society to welcome her back into the fold,"" London told BBC radio.Lloyd posed as Raymond Lloyd for 18 months before unmasking herself as a woman.But members, who voted to admit women in September 1991, were so angered by her ""deliberate deception"" that they went ahead with her expulsion.The deception was in fact a two-person act involving the late magician Jenny Winstanley, who recruited Lloyd to help her prove that women magicians were just as good as men.""I did a 20-minute show in front of 200 people, three examiners, and spoke to the examiner for an hour-and-three-quarters afterwards,"" Lloyd said, recalling how she managed to pull the wool over everyone's eyes.After the Magic Circle changed its stance on allowing women in, Winstanley, who died in 2004, phoned the society to explain.""Two days later we got a letter to say Raymond's been expelled,"" said Lloyd.""We couldn't get our heads round it. We just thought, 'come on it's funny, it's amusing' but they didn't think so and Jenny was completely snubbed, unfortunately.""After the expulsion, Lloyd continued to perform magic for 11 years in an anti-bullying variety show before eventually moving overseas.She said the Magic Circle had changed out of all recognition in the 30 years since she was thrown out, adding: ""This is for Jenny really, Jenny would have loved it.""London said Thursday's ceremony would also be a chance to recognise Winstanley both for her contribution to magic and her audacious trick at the Magic Circle's expense.""I just think she's a wonderful woman and I know she'd have loved to be here and I just wish more than anything I could have met her myself,"" she said.The Magic Circle was founded in 1905 by around 20 magicians at a restaurant in London's Chinatown district.Members must vow never to give away the secrets of magic.Although women have now been admitted to the Magic Circle for over 30 years, they still make up only around five percent of the society's 1,700 membership.The body says, however, that increasing numbers are now coming through in the 10-18-year-old age group.","Sophie Lloyd was expelled from the Magic Circle after posing as a man to gain admittance.

Hours after TimesofIndia.com reported that star India batter Virat Kohli has reached out to the Board of Control for Cricket in India BCCI ) and said he wanted to call it a day in the longest format, the X handle of County Championship took a shot at the Indian legend, indicating that he is afraid of facing the England quicks in the upcoming five-match Test series, starting from June 20.In a ten second video posted on the X by the County Championship, the England speedster Gus Atkinson and Josh Tongue can be seen shattering the stumps in the ongoing four-day tournament in England.The post was quoted with the comment ""We don't blame you Virat.""In Border-Gavaskar Trophy held earlier this year, Virat Kohli could manage only 190 runs in nine innings and 100 of those came in a single knock at Perth.Down Under, the right-hander struggled after the early high and was nowhere close to the high standards he had set in that part of the world.It is worth noting that Kohli expressed desire to lead the side again but it wasn't entertained by the BCCI as they had an eye on the future, and wanted to groom a young leader for the new World Test Championship cycle."" - This sentence is grammatically correct.As TimesofIndia.com had reported, Shubman Gill was earmarked as the leader for the future as the Indian cricket board didn't want to look back as far as captaincy is concerned.Kohli, who made his Test debut in 2011, has represented India in 123 Tests, scoring 9230 runs at an average of 46.85.He also led India in 68 Tests, making him the country's most successful captain in the format. His intensity, fitness, and leadership transformed India into a dominant Test side both at home and overseas.With Rohit Sharma having recently retired from Test cricket, Kohli’s exit would leave the team without its two most experienced batters. This raises serious concerns about leadership and depth as India prepare for a challenging English summer.","Virat Kohli has reached out to the Board of Control for Cricket in India.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Shikhar Dhawan unleashed a blistering response to Pakistan’s ceasefire violation just hours after a mutual truce was agreed upon.On Sunday, May 10, at around 8 PM, Pakistan reportedly launched multiple drone attacks targeting key Indian regions such as Srinagar and Kutch, barely three hours into the ceasefire.The truce, which was announced jointly by India’s Ministry of External Affairs and US President Donald Trump, was intended to pause escalating tensions.However, Pakistan's latest provocation has drawn condemnation from both officials and public figures across India.Taking to social media platform X, Shikhar Dhawan expressed his outrage in no uncertain terms.“Ghatiya desh ne fir apna ghatiyapan poori duniya ke aage dikha diya (The filthy nation has once again shown its filthiness to the whole world),” he posted, calling out Pakistan for once again showing its ""true colours.""His sentiment echoed the growing frustration among Indian citizens who see Pakistan's repeated breaches as deliberate and deceitful.Dhawan wasn’t alone. Virender Sehwag, Yuzvendra Chahal, and Rahul Tewatia also criticised Pakistan’s duplicity, with Sehwag sharing a stinging Hindi proverb that likened Pakistan’s actions to something inherently incorrigible.The implications of this breach have spilled into the sporting world as well. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has reportedly halted plans to resume IPL 2025, originally scheduled to end on May 25, after a security scare during the Punjab Kings vs Delhi Capitals match.Meanwhile, Indian defence forces remain on high alert, with many drone threats neutralised promptly.","Former Indian cricketer Shikhar Dhawan takes to social media to criticise Pakistan's latest ceasefire violation.

IPL 2025 suspended: What happens next?

MUMBAI: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will consult all the stakeholders over the next two days and seek government nod before resuming IPL 2025 , BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia told TOI on Saturday. Even though US President Donald Trump announced the ceasefire between India and Pakistan on Saturday, the on-ground situation was still fluid, with Pakistan violating the ceasefire later in the day.""The BCCI suspended the IPL yesterday for a period of seven days, and, today, we are on the second day with five more days left.The BCCI is closely monitoring the evolving situation and developments, and will take a call on IPL resumption after consulting all stakeholders of IPL and the concerned Government authorities,"" Saikia said.He then told this paper: ""In the next 48 hours, we will begin consultations with the franchises, broadcasters, sponsors and the state associations slated to host the remaining matches before crystallizing to a decision on the league's resumption. Given the importance of IPL at this juncture, it will also be prudent and necessary to take the nod of the Government of India before finalising the time for its restart. BCCI will duly announce the date of IPL restart once the whole process is over in due course of time.""The BCCI is likely to hold a meeting of its IPL Governing Council on Sunday on when and how to resume the remainder of the IPL 2025. Informally, the BCCI has informally sounded out the franchises about restarting the IPL in a week’s time.""It will be resumed soon, ASAP,"" is how a franchise official put it, though another said, ""not before next Friday,"" which means it's likely that it will be resumed from the next weekend.It's also likely that venues in the south like Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad, and in the west like Mumbai and Ahmedabad, host the 16 remaining IPL 2025 matches. The tournament was suspended on Friday for a week due to heightened tensions between India and Pakistan. The BCCI is set to soon get a nod from the Indian government to resume the tournament.The difficult part of resuming the IPL quickly in the current environment, is of course that plenty of foreign players, who have left for their homes, may not return for the rest of the season. ""Apart from the Australian and South African players involved in the World Test Championship final at Lord's in London (from June 11-15), the others will return,"" a franchise official said. It's clear that with Sunrisers Hyderabad out of the race for a playoffs berth, Australian captain Pat Cummins and opener Travis Head may not return for the rest of the league.A total of 57 matches had been completed in IPL 2025. The 58th match was going on May 8 between Punjab Kings (PBKS) and Delhi Capitals (DC) in Dharamsala, which was called off after 10.1 overs of play on security grounds. A decision will also be taken by the IPL GC on whether that match would be replayed or resumed from the point where it was abandoned.There are 12 league matches remaining, followed by the four playoffs.

Rohit Sharma’s last press conference as a captain

NEW DELHI: Several former cricketers, including West Indies great Brian Lara, have urged Virat Kohli to reconsider his reported decision to retire from Test cricket. According to TOI reports , Kohli has conveyed his desire to step away from the longest format of the game—a development that has sent ripples through the Indian cricketing community.But what does Test cricket mean to Kohli?In a video going viral on social media, Kohli—who has played 123 Tests and scored 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85—opened up about how much the format means to him.""You need to be honest with yourself. I mean, you know, Test cricket is tough. I mean, even when you're one of the top teams in the world or probably the best test team in the world over the last few years, you can still go into a space where you probably don't want it. You know, at certain stages, you feel like, for five days, do I want to do this again? So you really need to be absolutely honest with yourself. Are you ready for the hard grind? Are you ready to wake up on day three when things are absolutely stacked up against you, when you know that you are in trouble? You know, as a batting unit, are you going out there to get that 100 or get that 150 for your team? You know it's going to be tough. You probably have to do it for five, six hours over a period of two days. Are you strong enough to do that? If you told me I had to walk away from this game tomorrow, I can walk away without any regrets. Because everything that I've done since I entered the Indian cricket team has always been for the team, has always been from the point of view, how can I improve this environment that I'm a part of?"" Kohli said.""The reason why I reach out to these guys is because I don't want them to waste probably months and years of my life that I wasted as a youngster still trying to figure things out when I found out the formula for success and what it means to compete at this level,"" he added.""I want these guys to pick it up early so that the transition with Indian cricket can be very smooth. It should not take youngsters two and three years after the seniors are gone to build the team again. So I want them up to speed immediately when we are, you know, almost about to step out and Indian cricket stays on top of,"" Kohli said.Since making his Test debut in 2011, Kohli has played a pivotal role in India's red-ball resurgence. Renowned for his aggressive leadership, consistent batting, and fierce competitiveness, he transformed India into a formidable Test unit both at home and abroad.With over 9,000 runs and 30 centuries in the format, Kohli’s contribution to Test cricket has been nothing short of monumental.","Virat Kohli reportedly plans to retire from Test cricket.
