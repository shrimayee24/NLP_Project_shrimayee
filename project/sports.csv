NEW DELHI: In Chennai Super Kings' commanding 78-run victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad, Tushar Deshpande's sensational bowling performance during the powerplay proved to be the game-changer. Ruturaj Gaikwad, the skipper, recognized Deshpande's pivotal role in shifting the momentum back in their favour, a momentum that had been elusive throughout the season.Deshpande's wholehearted effort reflected in his figures of 4/27 off three overs. Particularly impactful were his three wickets during the powerplay, which dismantled the formidable Sunrisers Hyderabad batting order, led by Travis Head.In terms of individual performances for IPL 2024 Purple Cap list, Mustafizur Rahman's exceptional bowling performance saw him claim two wickets, elevating him to the second position in the IPL Purple Cap List. Rahman now has 14 wickets in 8 innings, tying with Purple Cap leader Jasprit Bumrah of Mumbai Indians, who has taken 14 wickets in 9 innings. However, Bumrah retains the top spot due to his superior economy and average.Also See:Harshal Patel of Punjab Kings follows closely behind in third place in the Purple Cap race, also with 14 wickets in 9 innings, but his economy and average are not as impressive as Bumrah and Rahman's. Matheesha Pathirana of CSK also had a noteworthy performance in the match, claiming two wickets, bringing his total to 13 wickets in 6 innings, securing him the fourth spot on the purple cap list. T Natarajan is in fifth place, having taken 13 wickets in 7 innings, including the crucial dismissal of Ruturaj Gaikwad for 98.In the upcoming match between Mumbai Indians and Lucknow Super Giants, Jasprit Bumrah's track record against key LSG batsmen is notable. He has dismissed K.L. Rahul, Nicholas Pooran, and Devdutt Padikkal twice each in previous encounters. This statistic adds an interesting dimension to the contest between Bumrah and the LSG batting lineup.",The IPL Purple Cap 2024 will be the largest in the history of the Indian Premier League. The cap will be worth an estimated $1.2 billion. It is the largest cap in the league's history. It will also be the most expensive in the world.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109681945,imgsize-59894,width-400,resizemode-4/109681945.jpg"

Delhi Capitals' Rishabh Pant is on fifth place with 398 runs in 11 matches.Earlier, in match 48th of IPL 2024, Lucknow Super Giants secured a thrilling four-wicket victory against Mumbai Indians at the Ekana Cricket Stadium in the ongoing IPL 2024, thanks to yet another rescue act by Marcus Stoinis. Despite a shaky start and a middle-order collapse, Stoinis played a pivotal role, ensuring victory for the hosts.In the face of a challenging chase of 145 runs, LSG encountered early difficulties, but skipper KL Rahul and Marcus Stoinis steadied the ship with a crucial 58-run partnership. While Rahul showcased solidity with his 28-run contribution, Stoinis took charge, anchoring the innings with a well-compiled 62.KL Rahul's innings of 28 runs in the match helped him secure the fourth position in the IPL 2024 orange cap race. He crossed the 400-run mark for the season, currently tallying 406 runs in 10 innings. Rahul became the fourth batter in the season to reach the 400-run mark.Virat Kohli, continuing his scorching form, added another half-century to his tally against Gujarat Titans. He displayed a remarkable strike rate against their spinners and became the first player to surpass the 500-run mark for the season, further solidifying his lead in the orange cap race.Earlier, Ruturaj Gaikwad's exceptional knock of 98 runs almost saw him reaching another century and guided CSK to a crucial victory against SRH. This outstanding performance boosted him to the second place on the orange cap list, with a total of 447 runs in just 9 innings, trailing only behind Virat Kohli of RCB.Sai Sudarshan's composed half-century against RCB also keeps him in contention, closely trailing with 418 runs in 10 innings, securing the third spot in the highest run-scorers' list. Rishabh Pant's 27-run innings in his last match has propelled him to the fifth position in the race for the IPL 2024 Orange Cap, with a total of 398 runs in 11 innings.","The IPL Orange Cap is worth an estimated $1.2 billion. The team is made up of players from the IPL, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh.

With five wins and four losses, the 2016 champions are determined to bounce back and reclaim their spot in the playoffs race.On the contrary, the Rajasthan Royals are riding high on their impressive form, demonstrating their ability to excel in any condition. With a comfortable lead at the top of the table, the Royals are focused on maintaining their winning streak and securing their spot in the knockout stage.Also see: IPL live score Sunrisers Hyderabad and Rajasthan Royals have engaged in 18 IPL matches over the years, with both teams securing nine wins each.

Notably, some mammoth totals were posted in a single match, with scores of 277/3 and 246/5 recorded at this venue.Known for its hard pitch and short square boundaries, the Hyderabad pitch tends to favour batsmen, leading to high-scoring matches.

On the other hand, the lowest total recorded is 165/5 in 20 overs by the Chennai Super Kings against Sunrisers Hyderabad.The Rajiv Gandhi Stadium in Hyderabad, where the upcoming match will take place, has witnessed high-scoring contests this IPL season. Considering this trend and the batting prowess of both teams, fans can expect another display of boundary-hitting cricket.Despite the pitch favouring batsmen, team captains are likely to include at least one specialist spinner to contain runs in the middle overs.With 338 runs in 8 matches, including two of SRH’s fastest half-centuries and a century, Head has been instrumental in the team's success this season.Samson has amassed 385 runs in 9 matches, including four half-centuries, with a batting average of 77, making him a vital player for the Royals.

Rohit Sharma's 20:20 spin vision: Indian skipper says he wanted four tweakers in T20 World Cup squad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/rohit-sharmas-2020-spin-vision-indian-skipper-says-he-wanted-four-tweakers-in-t20-world-cup-squad/articleshow/109800346.cms,"India's games start at 10 AM and dew will not play a major role

Dube for middle-order power

'In IPL, performances change daily'

MUMBAI: Keeping in mind the conditions in the Caribbean, where the wickets are likely to be low, slow and sluggish, the unusually early start timings for India's matches - 10 am local time - and perhaps also the ordinary form of their pacers barring Jasprit Bumrah , India have clearly devised a bowling plan for the upcoming T20 World Cup based around a heavy diet of spin.While Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel are the left-arm spinning allrounders in the squad, Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal are the two wrist spinners. On Thursday, captain Rohit Sharma , while trying to avoid giving out too much in terms of team strategy, justified the logic of having picked four spinners and just three pacers in the 15-member squad.""I don't want to go too much into details. I'm sure opposition captains are listening to this. I wanted four spinners. We've played a lot of cricket there (Caribbean). We know what the conditions are like. With a morning start at 10-10.30am, there's a little bit of technical aspect involved in this,"" Rohit said.""The reason for picking four spinners is something I won't reveal now. I wanted four spinners. With two of them being allrounders (Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja) and two attacking options (Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal), it gives you balance. Based on the opposition, we can decide who to play,"" the captain stressed.""Maybe when I do the first press conference upon landing, I'll give more details,"" he added.After India's failures in the last two T20 World Cups, it's clear that Rohit and the selectors wanted someone to do the heavy lifting in the middle overs against spinners, where acceleration has been a big problem.In that aspect, the skipper is banking on Mumbai allrounder Shivam Dube, who has been in sizzling form for the Chennai Super Kings in the last three IPLs now and has shown the ability to tonk the spinners.In the IPL so far, Dube has smashed 350 runs in 10 matches at a strike rate of 171.56 (average 50.00), in a tally which includes 26 sixes. In the three-match T20I series against Afghanistan at home in January, he carted 124 runs in three innings at a strike-rate of 158.97.""The one thing we really looked at was middle-overs hitting. The top-order hitting has been alright, hasn't been bad, but there are options there as well. In the middle overs, we wanted someone to come and play that role where he can play freely without worrying about who is bowling and who is not. We picked Shivam Dube based on the IPL and a few games before the IPL as well,"" Rohit said.The Indian captain expects Dube to chip in with the ball too, even though he has bowled just one over in this IPL. ""I know Shivam has not bowled much, but he's a seasoned cricketer who bowls a lot of overs in red-ball cricket. If we need Shivam to bowl a few overs, he will bowl. Hardik as well.""Rohit revealed that he had ""70-80%"" of India's World Cup-bound squad in his mind before the IPL.""You make the playing XI in your mind and work around it. The talk of what our final 15 started much before the IPL. In the IPL, performances change every day. Anyone will come and score a hundred or take five wickets.""",India's games start at 10 am local time and dew will not play a major role.

However, Australian Travis Head and all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy accelerated the scoring rate with a 96-run stand off just 47 deliveries. The pair took a heavy toll on leg spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, who conceded 62 runs in his four-over spell.After Head's pivotal innings of 57 off 44 balls came to an end, Nitish Kumar Reddy, who remained unbeaten on 76 off 42 balls, was then joined by South African power hitter Heinrich Klaasen, as they propelled Hyderabad past the 200-run mark for the fifth time in the tournament.-- First defeat in a run chase for RR this season.",Sunrisers Hyderabad beat Rajasthan Royals by one run in IPL match.

Sanju Samson 's consistency has always kept him in contention to represent India, but stiff competition for places in the Indian batting line-up and Rishbah Pant being the first-choice wicketkeeper meant that Samson was in and out of the national squad. However, he has been given another opportunity, this time alongside Pant, to wear the India jersey with a recall to the T20 World Cup squad.Samson is currently leading Rajasthan Royals in the ongoing Indian Premier League season, and it's his consistent performance in the league, both as a captain and as a batsman, that has earned him a recall ahead of KL Rahul.Speaking on Star Sports show 'Captains Speak', the 29-year-old Samson opened up on how he looks at his career graph and the change in approach he has adopted to enhance his chances of cementing a place in the Indian team.""When you are playing cricket in the world's best (cricket-playing) country, I think India is number one in the whole world (in terms of) the number of players who play and the number of talent we have and the competition we have, a guy from Kerala, if he has to come and cement his place in the national side, he has to do something special,"" Samson said.He made his international debut in a T20I against Zimbabwe in July 2015 but played his first ODI only six years later in 2021. In nine years since wearing the India jersey for the first, Samson has played only 16 ODIs and 25 T20Is. In 14 ODI innings he has scored 510 runs with a century and three fifties, while in 22 T20I innings he has accummulated 374 runs with one fifty at a strike rate of 133.09.However, Samson has re-invented his game lately, which shows in his current IPL numbers.Under Samson's captaincy, Rajasthan presently top the points table with a remarkable 8 wins in 9 matches. The skipper ranks 7th in the list of leading run-scorers of IPL 2024, accumulating 385 runs in 9 matches, including four half-centuries. He maintains an impressive strike rate of 161.08 and an average of 77.0.""I just always wanted to be special, always wanted to stand out the way I bat. I just wanted to create my own style of batting. No matter even if it's the first ball, I want to go out there and hit a six,"" said Samson.""So that's the shift in the mindset, which I had. I just wanted to do something different, like why do we have to wait for 10 balls to hit a six? So I just walk in and if I feel like, I do that the first ball. That was the motive behind development of my power stroke.""The T20 World Cup, slated from June 2 to 29, will be jointly hosted by the West Indies and the USA. India are set to kick off their campaign against Ireland on June 5 in New York.""I think I put in lots and lots of effort during the Covid time. A lot of people did help me.

Srikkanth's scathing remarks highlight concerns of favoritism and biased selection practices within the cricketing hierarchy.Expressing his dismay over Ruturaj Gaikwad's omission, Srikkanth denounced the decision as he questioned the inclusion of Shubman Gill , despite his subpar performances across formats.""There's no doubt that Ruturaj Gaikwad deserves a place. He scored more than 500 runs in 17 T20I innings. Also he scored a century against Australia,"" Srikkanth said on his YouTube channel.""Shubman Gill is totally out of form, but why is he selected in the team? Shubman Gill is the selectors' delight.

The team selection is all about favoritism,"" voiced Srikkanth, pointing out what he perceives as unjustifiable favoritism towards Gill.Srikkanth's criticism stems from Ruturaj Gaikwad's impressive display in the IPL 2024 too, where he has emerged as the highest run-scorer with over 500 runs in 10 innings. Despite his stellar form, Ruturaj found himself snubbed from the national squad, raising eyebrows among cricket enthusiasts and pundits alike.Furthermore, Srikkanth's condemnation extended to the exclusion of Rinku Singh from the T20 World Cup squad , which he branded as ""rubbish"" selection.

Runs continue to come off his bat in the ongoing Indian Premier League and the BCCI selectors had no second thoughts about including his name in India's T20 World Cup squad. Those two facts highlight that even in the twilight of his career, you discount Virat Kohli at your own peril.There was a lot of talk about his strike rate in T20 cricket before the announcement of India's squad for the T20 World Cup to be held this June, but all the cricket experts had him in their 15-member line-ups, which also firmly reflected in the official Indian squad that was revealed earlier this week.Irfan Pathan, former India pacer cum commentator, went a step ahead to predict that when time comes for a stiff chase during the T20 World Cup, it will be Virat Kohli who will be standing there till the end.""Jab waqt aata hai, yehi player akela khada hota hai, Virat Kohli (when it's required, he is the player who stands alone),"" said Pathan while talking on Star Sports (see video below).""Believe me, there will be a point during the T20 World Cup when there will be need, and the guy you will find chasing it till the end will be him, Virat Kohli.""Virat has already touched the figure of 500 runs in this IPL , which includes a century and four fifties, at a strike rate of 147.49, which can't be considered poor.To further stress on Kohli's proven track record while chasing, which also earned him the nickname 'chase master', Pathan mentioned the India vs Pakistan match in Melbourne during the T20 World Cup where Kohli famously hit Haris Rauf for two sixes to bring India back into contention.Virat's 53-ball 82 not out took India to a famous four-wicket win.""Pick all the big matches, especially when chasing, you won't find a bigger player than him in T20 cricket. He has a calculative mind. (He is like) 'You keep talking about strike rate, I will keep talking about chasing runs and the target.' Never doubt Virat Kohli,"" said Irfan.""I was saying the same thing even when the squad was not yet selected. He is a big-match player, a World Cup player. When the World Cup comes, he will have an impact.""The T20 World Cup runs from June 2 to 29 and will be jointly hosted by the West Indies and USA.India play their opening group match against Ireland on June 5 in New York, followed by the big game against Pakistan at the same venue on June 9. Canada and co-hosts USA are the other two teams in India's group.",Virat Kohli has scored 500 runs in the ongoing Indian Premier League. All cricket experts had him in their 15-member line-ups for the T20 World Cup. Former India pacer Irfan Pathan says Kohli will be the man to stand up to the challenge.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109801216,imgsize-46124,width-400,resizemode-4/109801216.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Bhuvneshwar Kumar shone with a sensational final over as Sunrisers Hyderabad stunned Rajasthan Royals by just one run in a last-ball thriller, keeping their IPL playoff hopes alive on Thursday.With two runs needed from the final delivery, Bhuvneshwar (3/41) trapped Rovman Powell (27) lbw with a full toss, leaving RR at 200 for seven while chasing a target of 202.After choosing to bat, Sunrisers Hyderabad posted 201 for three thanks to explosive fifties from Nitish Reddy (76 not out) and Travis Head (58), as well as Heinrich Klassen's unbeaten 42 off 19 balls.Things were looking up when Bhuvneshwar removed Jos Buttler and Sanju Samson for ducks in the opening over to leave RR at 1 for 2.However, youngsters Yashasvi Jaiswal (67) and Riyan Parag (77) came up with counterattacking fifties on way to a massive 134-run partnership to lay the foundation of the runchase.But once the duo was back in the hut, Shimron Hetmyar (13) hit a four and a six as it seemed like a regulation chase butT Natarajan got rid off Hetmyar, who perished at long-on and then skipper Pat Cummins removed Dhruv Jurel, who was caught at deep square leg in the 19th over.The sudden loss of wickets gave SRH hope of a turnaround but Powell produced a six in the last ball of the 19th over to bring the equation down to 13 off six balls.The West Indian kept a calm head to bring it down to 2 off the last ball but Bhuvneshwar denied him the glory.Following the win, SRH snapped their two-game losing streak and moved to the fourth spot with 12 points, same as Kolkata Knight Riders, Lucknow Super Giants, while RR stayed at the top with 16 points.Chasing the total, Jaiswal and Parag were dropped early in their innings and they capitalised on the reprieves to script a quick recovery.Parag broke the shackles in third over when he carted Bhuvneshwar for two fours and a six. Jaiswal then blasted Marco Jansen for two boundaries after Cummins spilled a straight forward catch.Parag, who was dropped on 24 by Abhishek Sharma, hammered Cummins for another maximum, before carting Jansen for two more fours.Cummins finally introduced spin into the attack but Jaiswal smashed Shahbaz Ahmed for a four to complete his fifty. Three balls later, Parag produced a reverse sweep four to reach his milestone in 32 balls.Jaiwal then played a T Natarajan delivery onto the stumps, while two overs later Parag was holed out at long-on.Earlier, Head forged a 96-run stand off 57 balls for the third wicket with Nitish, who also added another 70 off 32 balls with Klassen to take SRH across the 200-mark for the fifth time this season.Head, who was dropped by Parag in the first ball of the innings, hit six fours and three sixes, while Nitish smashed eight maximums and three fours during his brutal assault.Playing his 300th game, Yuzvendra Chahal, who has been picked for the T20 World Cup, was on the firing line as he conceded 62 in his quota of four overs.Avesh Khan (2/39) produced the first breakthrough, having Abhishek (12) caught at deep midwicket. Sandeep Sharma (1/31) then claimed a first-ball wicket, removing Anmolpreet Singh (5) as SRH scored 37 for 2 in the powerplay, their lowest this IPL.The spin duo of Chahal and R Ashwin (0/36), however, disappointed as the batters milked them for runs to set SRH on the road to recovery.Chahal had a horrible night as Head smashed him for two sixes and a four during an 18-run over after he came on to bowl immediately following the powerplay.The leg-spinner was then taken apart by Nitish, who plundered him for two sixes and two fours to accumulate 21 runs.Nitish, who also clobbered Ashwin and Avesh for two maximums, then sent Sandeep sailing over extra cover, while Head pulled Avesh for another six in the 15th over.The Australian, however, played the pacer onto his middle stump as SRH slipped to 131/3.New man Klassen then joined the party, sending Chahal into the orbit with back-to-back sixes. When Trent Boult was back, Klassen picked him for two fours, while blasting another six off Sandeep.","Bhuvneshwar Kumar shines with sensational final over as Sunrisers Hyderabad stun Rajasthan Royals by just one run in a last-ball thriller.

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders ' assistant coach Abhishek Nayar on Thursday shared insights into Shreyas Iyer 's journey, highlighting how the cricketer has embraced setbacks with a positive mindset.Despite facing significant disappointments, including injury setbacks leading into a crucial international season, Iyer has approached these challenges constructively and is gearing up to return stronger by engaging in domestic cricket.In the build-up to IPL 2024, Iyer encountered a back problem, raising concerns about his availability for KKR's matches. However, demonstrating resilience and determination, the skipper made a remarkable comeback. Throughout the tournament, he has showcased his prowess, amassing over 250 runs, which notably includes a half-century innings.Nayar's remarks shed light on Iyer's commendable attitude and commitment to overcoming obstacles. By focusing on his recovery and performance on the field, Iyer exemplifies the spirit of perseverance and dedication, traits that are essential for success in the competitive realm of professional cricket.The BCCI also dropped Iyer from the annual central contract list.""Mentally, to have a mindset like that after being rejected or not getting his due, he has taken it very positively. Even when he talks about it, he is not negative, he understands he needs to go back and do well,"" Nayar told the media during KKR's training session in Mumbai.""His mindset is to score runs, whether he plays the IPL, the Ranji Trophy or for India. He looks to score runs, it (disappointments) has affected him but the way he has handled it, kudos to him because I can imagine a lot of people reacting very differently than he has,"" he added.""Having known him for a really long time, without any bias, he is one of the strongest people mentally I have ever known, just in terms of how he has accepted certain things that have happened with him.""I would have seen a lot of people cribbing and talking about it, but I haven't heard him whine about it or complain about it at all. The way he has approached life is in a positive manner, what is in front of you, you try and accept it.""His fitness is in his control, and he is feeling a lot better now. He is great on the field, he is batting longer hours, he's trained really hard. Our strength and conditioning (coaches) and physios have worked hard with him,"" Nayar added.Under Iyer's leadership, Kolkata Knight Riders have demonstrated impressive performance, securing six victories out of nine games and currently occupying the second position on the table with 12 points. This strong standing puts them in a favorable position to qualify for the playoffs.However, despite their promising position, Nayar refrained from making any firm commitments regarding their playoff prospects.""I wish I could tell you that 16 (points) is good or 14 is good, but we never know. I think this competition is one of the toughest in the world. It's a two-month competition which is a long competition,” said Nayar.He drew parallels between IPL and Ranji Trophy, saying teams have to perform consistently throughout the tournament to achieve their goals.""I often think about it like a Ranji Trophy, wherein you have to constantly play well and it's not so much about how you play the first half but it's also as important to play the second,"" he said.""Just in terms of points, we have seen teams that have been at the bottom of the table do really well against table toppers. It's very hard to say this is going to be safe and this is enough. The more (points) the merrier (it is) for any team,"" Nayar added.Giving an update on batter Nitish Rana , Nayar said no timeline had been set for his return from a finger injury.""He is on his way back to recovery. We are hoping that he is fit soon. We don't have the timelines yet. But hopefully, he (has) started batting now. Still, getting match-fit is something he is working towards,"" Nayar said.Nayar said the motivation to beat Mumbai on their home turf, be it the IPL or Ranji Trophy, drives several rival sides.""...wanting to go out and beat Mumbai, whether it is Ranji Trophy or the IPL, everyone wants to beat Mumbai,"" he said.",Kolkata Knight Riders assistant coach Abhishek Nayar shares insights into skipper Shreyas Iyer's journey. Nayar says Iyer is one of the strongest people mentally he has ever known.

NEW DELHI: Renowned Inter Miami star and eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi took a break from his football duties to attend the Miami Heat playoff game against the Boston Celtics on Monday night.Accompanied by his teammates Jordi Alba , Sergio Busquets , and Luis Suarez , who also played with him at Barcelona, Messi arrived at the arena just before tip-off.The group, with some wearing Heat attire and Busquets donning a Heat hoodie, entered through the players' parking garage and were escorted via a VIP entrance to their suite seats above the lower level.Although Messi had previously visited the arena for at least one other event, this marked his first arranged attendance at a Heat game since relocating to Miami last year.Inter Miami have been performing exceptionally well in the Major League Soccer (MLS) this season, boasting a 6-2-3 record and currently leading the Eastern Conference with the highest points tally in the league.Messi's contributions have been instrumental, with two goals and an assist in Inter Miami's recent 4-1 victory over New England on Saturday. He has achieved the remarkable feat of having multiple goal contributions in five consecutive matches, a first for any MLS player.Throughout his illustrious career, Messi has amassed over 800 goals for both club and country, solidifying his status as one of the greatest scorers in soccer history.His crowning achievement came in 2022 when he led Argentina to the World Cup title, scoring twice in the final against France. The match ended in a thrilling 3-3 draw, with Argentina ultimately triumphing 4-2 on penalty kicks.","Lionel Messi attended the Miami Heat playoff game against the Boston Celtics.

ISL: Mumbai see off Goa to set up final showdown with Bagan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/isl-mumbai-see-off-goa-to-set-up-final-showdown-with-bagan/articleshow/109703553.cms,"MUMBAI: Jorge Pereyra Diaz wanted to lap up every second of it. The Argentinian striker had just given Mumbai the lead in the second leg of their Indian Super League semifinal against FC Goa , putting the Islanders 4-2 ahead on aggregate, and he was in the mood to celebrate.Joining him were thousands of Mumbai City fans who made sure their delight was heard around the 7000-capacity Mumbai Football Arena.They had to wait until the 69th minute for that joyous moment, and it was to get even better seven minutes from the end of regulation time.This time it was Lallianzuala Chhangte who timed his run perfectly from inside his half to latch on to a sublime assist from Vikram Partap Singh, neatly take it past Goa goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh, and tap the ball into the net to make it 2-0. For the second time in five days, Goa were left crestfallen.They had been looking good to arrive here with a 2-0 lead from their first leg at Fatorda last Wednesday. But in a matter of six crazy minutes in the closing stages of that game, the Gaurs watched in agony as Chhangte and Vikram turned that lead into a 3-2 win in favour of the Islanders.Despite that slap in the face, Manolo Marquez's side, backed by around 250 travelling fans, would have come to Mumbai encouraged by their form on the road, having scored in their last nine away games. It's another matter that they were up against the league's meanest defence, and the latter eventually won.Mumbai's 2-0 victory on Monday and a 5-2 win on aggregate has earned them the right to take on Mohun Bagan Super Giant in Saturday's final. Petr Kratky's side will look at it as a chance to avenge their narrow defeat to the Kolkata giants a fortnight ago on the last day of the league stage which saw Bagan thwart Mumbai's hopes of becoming the first team to defend the League Winners Shield.For now though, the Islanders will cherish a win they had to work extremely hard for, against an opponent who has challenged them each time they have met this season.They may have endured a nightmare finish to the first leg of this semifinal but Goa managed to make a positive start here, looking clearly to their American winger Noah Sadaoui to launch attacks down the left channel.After his tremendous impact as a second half substitute in Fatorda, where he produced two sublime assists for the goals that contributed to Mumbai's jaw-dropping comeback, Jayesh Rane was duly rewarded with a starting spot on this occasion. But the midfielder struggled to get his teeth into the game for most of the first half.The home side soon settled and would come the closest to scoring in the opening 45 minutes when they struck the post twice, first through a Tiri header off a corner, and later when Chhangte wasn't able to curl his left-footed effort enough.In his pre-match press conference, Marquez had admitted that the Gaurs could well find themselves in a situation where they would have to take increased risks. That moment arrived in the second half when Mumbai captain Rahul Bheke saw his header off Yoel van Nieff's corner cleared off the goal line by Goa defender Nim Dorjee Tamang. But Pereyra Diaz was there, as he usually is, perfectly placed, to poke the ball home.Vikram has scored eight times for the Islanders in the league this season, including a hat-trick against NorthEast United in March, but the forward showed how well he can create opportunities too, releasing Chhangte with a delightful pass around Goa's defence, as Mumbai's number 7 got the home support going again with a fine finish.There are likely to be questions raised about the relevance of the ISL playoffs going forward, with the format now really holding no significance apart from the prize money on offer. What there can be little doubt about though, is the two best teams over the course of the 2023-24 campaign will clash for the trophy at Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday!","Mumbai City beat FC Goa 4-2 on aggregate to reach Indian Super League final.

Impressively, despite primarily operating in midfield, he leads Real Madrid's league goal-scoring charts this season with 17 goals to his name.Tuchel's acknowledgment of Bellingham's prowess underlines the recognition within Bayern Munich's camp of the threat posed by the young midfielder. As the two European giants lock horns, the spotlight will undoubtedly be on Bellingham as he seeks to maintain his influential presence and impact on the semi-final stage.Tuchel said Bellingham was ""a key player in a very offensive position"" for the Spanish giants.""Jude is extraordinary. He was fantastic here in the Bundesliga, how he progressed shows the level of personality he has, it's only possible with a huge personality.""Everyone who plays for Madrid plays with the pressure of the shirt.
