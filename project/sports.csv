The third day's play of the first India-Bangladesh Test was no different as bad light forced the early stumps in Chennai.The match came to a halt on Saturday evening when the two on-field umpires decided to suspend play due to the arrival of dark clouds from the beach side, causing poor visibility on the ground.In response to the situation, India captain Rohit Sharma approached the umpires to inquire about the possibility of employing spinners to continue the game.However, it was Mohammed Siraj who came up with an unusual suggestion, which left his teammates and the umpires amused and chuckling.Umpire Rod Tucker suddenly stopped the game in the 38th over due to bad light that prompted Rohit to ask whether he could use spinners.Siraj was seen honing his spin bowling skills, which piqued the interest of the commentators. They wondered whether the Indian skipper would be bold enough to utilize this option.Siraj's self-assurance was evident as he approached Rohit, spinning the ball in his hand, and proposed an idea. However, when the umpires conveyed Siraj's suggestion to Rohit, the captain dismissed it with a chuckle, stating, ""He can't bowl spin.""

Cricket holds a special place in the hearts of millions across India, with fans passionately following every move of their favorite cricketers. Legends like Sachin Tendulkar , Mahendra Singh Dhoni, and Virat Kohli enjoy massive fanbases, with their fame reaching almost mythical proportions within the country. However, this intense recognition doesn't always extend beyond India's borders, as a recent viral video highlights.A video recently surfaced on Instagram that caught the attention of cricket enthusiasts.The clip, shot in a foreign country, features a host stopping random passersby, asking them if they know who Virat Kohli is or if they've even heard of cricket. Much to the shock of Indian fans, the responses were overwhelmingly negative.In the video, the host begins by asking two men, ""Do you know who Virat Kohli is?"" Both men, without hesitation, admit they have no idea who the cricket star is. The host then turns to a woman and poses the same question, ""Have you heard of Virat Kohli?"" Initially confused, she too confirms that she’s unfamiliar with the name.The video continues as the host approaches more people, asking the same questions. Each time, the answer remains the same—none of the individuals interviewed had ever heard of Virat Kohli or cricket. This highlights the stark difference in the sport's popularity within India and globally. While Kohli is revered as a cricketing superstar in his homeland, cricket remains a relatively niche sport in many other parts of the world, where other sports like soccer or basketball dominate.Since being posted, the video has garnered over 1.6 million views on Instagram and sparked a flood of reactions. Thousands of users have liked, shared, and commented on the post, expressing everything from surprise to amusement.One user quipped, ""If you ask about Ronaldo, they'll know,"" referring to the global fame of football icons like Cristiano Ronaldo, whose recognition transcends borders. Another user called Virat Kohli ""the king"" in the comments, showcasing the immense pride Indian fans take in their cricket stars.A user named Suraj pointed out the obvious cultural divide, stating, ""When cricket isn’t famous worldwide, how will they know Virat Kohli?"" Another amused commenter asked, ""Brother, which country have you gone to?"" as others filled the comment section with shock emojis and disbelief.",Cricket holds a special place in the hearts of millions across India.

Imran Khan should get to next level: Khalid Jamil,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/imran-khan-should-get-to-next-level-khalid-jamil/articleshow/113576072.cms,"KOLKATA: Jamshedpur FC coach Khalid Jamil was more than pleased with the performance of Imran Khan who had an incredible Indian Super League (ISL) game against Mumbai City FC at JRD Tata Sports Complex in Jamshedpur on Saturday.Imran, who got a call up to the Indian team early this year, had quite a remarkable outing with the Men of Steel last season and he has continued from where he left off, this season too.On Saturday, playing against the defending champions and one of the favourites this season, too, the footballer from Manipur was a livewire on the right wing and made Sahil Panwar ’s life quite difficult.After making some lovely runs early on, it was finally in the 36th minute that he made a decisive move. Imran played a dummy, and then dropped his shoulders to get past Panwar before releasing a cross towards the centre with his left foot from outside the box. It was inch perfect and all Jordan Murray had to do was jump up and redirect the ball towards the goal, and he obliged.About four minutes later, the Maniouri winger delivered another cross near the middle from much further out. This time it was for Javier Siverio but the Spaniard’s header was saved by Mumbai goalkeeper Phurba Lachenpa.However, within a couple of minutes he forced Panwar for a foul on him that earned the Mumbai player a yellow and helped Jamshedpur win a free-kick. It was well outside the box but at a good position. AndJavi Hernandez had no trouble in scoring directly from it.Any coach would have been proud of such a performance and speaking after the game which the hosts won 3-2, Jamil said, “Imran is doing well. He is experienced and he knows better. He’s making good deliveries. He now should just maintain his form and try to get to the next level.”The coach, however, added, “He could have done better at times.”As for the overall performance, Jamil said, “We worked very hard and that’s why we got the result. We must keep the same spirit. We should now think of the next game.”The coach, meanwhile, made only one change to the starting eleven from the last match by bringing in Murray and it was quite a masterstroke.Murray, who scored the winner in the last game against FC Goa, not only gave Jamshedpur the lead but also played a part in the third goal.Speaking of the change, Jamil added, “We needed an early goal, so played Jordan Murray from the beginning to give support to Javier Siverio and Javi Hernández.”Hopefully the trio will be able to carry on their good show even in the next game which will be away to Odisha FC coming Saturday.Also all eyes will be on Imran, who will hope to deliver once again and maybe then get a chance to play for the national team sometime in the future.","Imran Khan had an incredible Indian Super League (ISL) game against Mumbai City FC at JRD Tata Sports Complex in Jamshedpur on Saturday.

snares three as India thump Bangladesh by 280 runs

CHENNAI: In a few years' time, when we will look back at the India vs Bangladesh Test at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in the September of 2024, we will remember it as the 'Ashwin Test'.From the second session of the first day to the time when India wrapped it up in the first session of Day 4, it was Ashwin all the way.A century on Day 1, his 37th five-wicket haul to equal Shane Warne , another Man of the Match award, his father, wife, kids, former coaches and many friends in the galleries, the stage might have been incredibly tempting for the 38-year-old to announce that it was his last at his beloved home ground.He didn't. ""Who knows if this was my Chepauk swansong in Tests? But if it was, what a swansong it was,"" Ashwin left it open-ended, soaking in all the adulation after another match-winning spell of 6-88 as India won the Test by 280 runs to go 1-0 up. When the fourth day started, the result of the Test was never in doubt. The challenge for India was to wrap it up as early as possible before the team leaves for Kanpur in the search of the second of their four wins that will book them aWorld Test Championship Final berth.One felt that on a tired pitch here on Day 4, captain Rohit Sharma might bring Ashwin and his spin twin Ravindra Jadeja into action right from the start. But he waited, allowed the effect of the roller to wear off, and let the Bangladeshi batters Najmul Hossain Shanto and Shakib Al Hasan get used to the pace of the quick bowlers.Just when it seemed the two lefthanders might just stretch the game a bit, Ashwin and Jadeja were brought in. Ashwin, coming in from round the wicket and bowling with a 5-4 offside field to the left-hander, chose to take the middle-stump line rather than off. It took the cut and the reverse sweep out of the equation and the master offie was looking to bowl a little slow through the air, to get maximum purchase out of a pitch which hadn't shaped up into a vicious turner.The skill of the bowler had to come into play and that's exactly what happened when Ashwin induced an inside-edge off Shakib's bat and the forward short-leg fielder completed a good catch diving to his left.That was the beginning of the end as Ashwin and Jadeja looked more and more dangerous. Litton Das, a super success in Pakistan recently for Bangladesh, didn't have the quality to deal with the spin duo and Jadeja (3 58) sent him back.The ball pitched on the middle and turned just a little bit and the edge was a regulation at slip. At this point, the only point of interest was whether Bangladesh captain Shanto (82) could complete his century. But with wickets falling at the other end, the left-hander who had batted with a lot of belief till then, tried a big shot against Jadeja and gave his wicket away.Jadeja, though, was made to wait for his milestone 300th wicket, stopping at 299, when he had the last man Hasan Mahmud bowled 15 minutes before lunch. In a way, it was fitting as well, because Jadeja was equally instrumental in this win, scoring 86 with Ashwin, taking the two big wickets in the first innings, and now, finishing things off in a hurry, the way he has been doing on Indian soil over the years.""Jadeja is such an inspirational story…My admiration for Jadeja keeps on increasing as I realize I will never be able to beat him,"" Ashwin paid his comrade the ultimate compliment as India truly looked like a happy family.",India beat Bangladesh by 280 runs to go 1-0 up in the Test. Ravindra Jadeja takes his 300th Test wicket. Ashwin takes 6-88 to equal Shane Warne's record of 37 wickets. India will play in the World Test Championship Final in Kanpur.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113583068,imgsize-91588,width-400,resizemode-4/113583068.jpg"

On Sunday at his home ground, he equalled one of his heroes Shane Warne on the five-wicket haul count in Tests. Ashwin's 37th five-wicket haul was one of the many records that he has achieved in an international career of 13 years, and there's one still that he had said earlier that he wanted to break.That's Anil Kumble 's record of 619 Test wickets --the highest by an Indian.But Ashwin, who is at the back-end of his career insists that he isn't exactly chasing anything.""Look, I don't think of any goals. I just wanted to enjoy my game, be the best that I can be, seek excellence. I am not ambitious at this point of time. I love my game and want to play as long as I can,"" the champion offie said after a match-winning effort with the bat and the ball over the last four days.Ashwin isn't getting any younger - at 38, the body has to deal with a lot as he looks to go from one peak to the other. ""Yes, it's a challenge. It's not the same when you are 25 …Every bit of work that you put in, you have to put doubly hard to earn the right to be there,"" Ashwin said.He explained how he has changed his training regime so that he doesn't stress himself out, especially when there's a dodgy knee to deal with as well. ""To be fair, I have reduced my strength training sessions. I work differently on my mobility and other aspects of life. I am living life, do a bit of yoga,"" he said, the smile intact.There's another growing interest in Ashwin's life --chess. The offspinner is a fan of Magnus Carlsen , he himself plays the sport and now owns a team in theGlobal Chess League as well. As Ashwin went on with his exploits at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai boys D Gukesh and R Praggnanandhaa took India towards a gold in Chess Olympiad.While Ashwin is following them with a lot of intent, the allrounder felt this success has a lot to do with what Viswanathan Anand did for Indian chess. ""Without any history of chess coming out of this country, we produced a legend like Anand, which is something fantastic. This morning also, I saw Hikaru Nakamura tweet about it. It is just amazing, I think he is someone who is under-praised a lot, he hasn't got his due,"" Ashwin said.It was at the MA Chidambaram Stadium 11 years ago against Australia that Ashwin had cemented his place in the Indian Test team with a seven-wicket haul. With his six-fer and the century against Bangladesh and his family, friends and coaches at the ground, it seemed life had come to a full circle for him. Test cricket will probably return to Chennai after three years and he will be 41 by then.Will he get to see him again playing in India's whites at his home ground again?""Maybe, maybe not. Who knows? Like I said, every day, every Test match I am playing is a big grind. And you never really know what is next when it comes to Test matches…I haven't thought too far ahead, but if that was my swansong, what a swansong,"" Ashwin left it at that, still smiling.","R Ashwin equalled Shane Warne on the five-wicket haul count in Tests.

After umpire Kettleborough raised his finger in favour of the bowler, Kohli opted against reviewing the decision.However, UltraEdge later revealed a spike-there was an inside edge, and even Kohli wasn't aware of it.Kohli's costly error left Rohit visibly baffled, as he appeared frustrated with Kohli's decision not to take the DRS review.

Daniel Dubois knocks out Anthony Joshua to retain IBF world heavyweight title,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/boxing/daniel-dubois-knocks-out-anthony-joshua-to-retain-ibf-world-heavyweight-title/articleshow/113562589.cms,"(Reuters Photo)

Daniel Dubois successfully defended his IBF world heavyweight championship by delivering a devastating fifth-round knockout against fellow Briton Anthony Joshua in a thrilling encounter at Wembley Stadium on Saturday night. The event drew a passionate crowd of 96,000 spectators.From the opening bell, the 27-year-old champion asserted his dominance, flooring the former two-time heavyweight titleholder on multiple occasions.Dubois had previously expressed his resolve to ""legitimise"" his reign as IBF champion, having been awarded the title vacated by Oleksandr Usyk in June.The challenger's powerful performance raises serious doubts about Joshua's boxing future, although his promoter, Eddie Hearn, indicated that he anticipates Joshua will seek a rematch.Despite entering the fight as the underdog, Dubois relentlessly pursued his renowned opponent from the outset, with his heavy punches visibly affecting the 2012 London Olympic champion throughout the contest.In a gripping fifth round filled with intense action, Dubois landed the fight-ending punch, having weathered some concerning moments himself as Joshua finally found his rhythm.The victory solidifies Dubois' position as a formidable force in the heavyweight division.""Are you not entertained?"" he said, speaking to DAZN after the biggest win of his 24-fight career. It's been a journey and I'm grateful to be in this position. I'm a gladiator, I'm a warrior until the bitter end. I want to get to the top of this sport and reach my full potential.""Before the explosive fireworks display over Wembley, Liam Gallagher of Oasis energized the eager audience with a three-song live performance.In a thrilling opening round, the British opponents clashed, culminating in Joshua being rescued by the bell after being knocked down by a vicious overhand right.Joshua, weighing 1.8 kilograms more than his younger rival, was in complete survival mode in the second round. Dubois floored him again in the third round with a left hook that caused his legs to give way.Following a standing eight count, the bell rang, and as the fourth round commenced, Joshua hit the canvas for the third time, despite his objection that it was not a valid knockdown.The fifth round was action-packed, with Dubois briefly stunned by two right hands. As Joshua attempted to capitalize on the situation, he was caught by consecutive right hands and found himself on the canvas once more, this time unable to beat the count.Both boxers stepped into the ring with the goal of securing a chance to face Tyson Fury or Usyk for the undisputed world championship.Usyk achieved a historic feat in May by becoming the first boxer to hold all four major heavyweight titles simultaneously, including the IBF, WBO, WBC, and WBA belts, after defeating Tyson Fury.Instead of facing the mandatory IBF challenger, Dubois, Usyk opted for a rematch with Fury. Dubois won the interim IBF title in June and was elevated to world champion status when Usyk vacated the belt.Joshua had aspirations of joining the prestigious group of three-time heavyweight champions, which includes legendary figures such as Muhammad Ali, Lennox Lewis, and Evander Holyfield. However, Joshua's career took a significant hit after suffering defeats against Andy Ruiz in 2019 and two subsequent losses to Usyk.Despite bouncing back with four consecutive victories, Joshua aimed to reclaim his position at the top of the heavyweight division.Following his devastating loss to Dubois at Wembley, which marked his fourth defeat in 32 professional bouts, Joshua suggested he would continue his boxing career, but the setback will undoubtedly require introspection and careful consideration of his future in the sport.""We came up short as a team,"" he said. ""You know I'm ready to kick off in the ring but I'm going to keep it respectful. Before I came here, I always say to myself I'm a fighter for life. You keep rolling the dice. I had a fast and sharp opponent, a lot of mistakes from my end.""","Daniel Dubois successfully defended his IBF world heavyweight championship by delivering a devastating fifth-round knockout against fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.

Top Picks For You India vs Bangladesh, 1st Test: Gill, Pant strike centuries before Ashwin grabs three to leave Bangladesh facing heavy defeat

CHENNAI: Stats don't necessarily reveal the entire story, but they do leave an indicator. So, when Rishabh Pant matches MS Dhoni 's six-Test-centuries feat — achieved over 90 Tests — in just 34 games, it's a very special achievement indeed. The Pant story is all the more special because of the cruel turn that life had taken on a wintry morning in 2022.Lucky to be alive after a car accident, not too many gave him a chance to play top-flight cricket again, let alone play Tests.Pant's comeback story is well documented. His return in the last IPL was a tale of determination while his role as a No. 3 batter on the most difficult pitches of the T20 World Cup spoke volumes of his grit. There were still doubts whether his body would be able to take the rigours of five-day cricket, but after Saturday, all those speculations have been put to rest. The comfort with which he batted against the Bangladesh bowlers showed that the cobwebs in the mind have been taken care of. Shubman Gill , who has seen him from close quarters and shared a 167-run partnership on Saturday, said that it was special to see Pant score the comeback ton. ""I've spent a lot of time with him on and off the field and watching him score his first 100 after his comeback gives me so much pleasure. I've seen him work so hard for it when he was coming back from the injury and I think he also must be feeling really good,"" Gill said.A couple of months ago in New York, as India were preparing for a game against Pakistan, the pitch in one of the nets had so much variable bounce that most batters refused to bat there. But Pant asked the throwdown expert to hurl the white ball at him from 18 yards on that pitch. He kept getting hit on the body, but connected a few as well with the bat. While Pant was trying to get used to the short ball, he was also trying to test his pain threshold, and now we can see all the hard work has paid off.While former coach Rahul Dravid was effusive in his praise of Pant, current boss Gautam Gambhir , too, had a lot of good things to say about the dynamite that he possesses in his arsenal. ""He's got runs everywhere around the world, and not many wicket-keepers of that age have done it so consistently in red-ball cricket . It is always good to have someone like him who can open the game for us, and more importantly, can bring a lot of impact as well,"" Gambhir had said before the Test.As we keep discussing about Pant the batter, sometimes we forget how well he has kept on Indian pitches as well. In this Test too, he has looked in top shape and his glovework has been on point. ""Probably his batting overshadows his 'keeping many times. It's not easy to keep against the likes of Ashwin, Jadeja and Kuldeep on Indian conditions and what he has done behind the stumps has been remarkable as well,"" Gambhir said.For Pant, things can only get better from here and we all believe the best is yet to come.",Rishabh Pant matches MS Dhoni's six-Test-centuries feat in just 34 games. Pant story is all the more special because of the cruel turn that life had taken on a wintry morning in 2022.

India's two centurions from day three of the first Test against Bangladesh in Chennai, Rishabh Pant and Shubman Gill , not just entertained the crowd at the MA Chidambaram Stadium but also had a good time on the crease teasing each other, besides pummeling the bowlers.In one such incident shared by Shubman Gill after the close of play on Saturday, whenever either of them hit a boundary, Pant would hit Gill's bat hard with his.While that's normal for a batsman to do as a way of congratulating his partner in the middle, Gill had his reasons to ask Pant to stop doing it.""I was telling him not to because I was playing with a bat that I played the England series with, so my bat is quite old actually,"" said Gill at the press conference after play ended.But Pant, who is a character that keeps his teammates entertained, didn't listen.""He was hitting my bat so hard, I was telling him that I am trying to save my bat. But if he didn't middle it (hit well), he would say 'no, let's do it again'. Bro, calm down!"" a smiling Gill said, much to the delight of the reporters in the room.The duo added 167 runs for the third wicket, with Pant making 109 on his return to Test cricket since his car accident in December 2020.

NEW DELHI: Veteran Ravichandran Ashwin delivered an all-round masterclass while swashbuckling Rishabh Pant had an emotional and memorable Test return as India thrashed Bangladesh in just over three days in the series opener in Chennai to go 1-0 up in the 2-game series on Sunday.Kicking off the new and a gruelling Test season in style, Rohit Sharma and co. were absolutely clinical, securing a massive 280-run win to hand 'Guru' Gautam Gambhir his first triumph as a Test coach.After a long break, India did have a jittery start to the game, but local boy Ashwin (119) first came up with a majestic first innings ton and then weaved his magic with the ball in the fourth innings to hand India a comfortable win.To go with that, Pant marked his Test return after the 2022 horrific car accident, with a dazzling ton and rising star Shubman Gill too hit a century, making the win a memorable affair at the Chepauk.The win was India's 7th in 10 games in the current World Test Championship cycle and saw the hosts achieve quite a few remarkable feats as a team and on individual levels as well.Here's a close look at the numbers in India's clinical win over Bangladesh:- India achieved a historic milestone in their 92-year Test cricket history, recording more wins than defeats for the first time. It took 580 Tests for India to achieve a win/loss ratio greater than 1 for the first time. Till date India have drawn 222 Tests.- Before the Chennai Test, Rishabh Pant had last played Test cricket against Bangladesh in December 2022 in Dhaka before he suffered a horrific car crash forcing him out of action for over one and a half years. After a title-winning run at T20 World Cup earlier this year, Pant made a successful Test comeback at the Chepauk, scoring a superb second innings ton -- 109.- The Rishabh Pant 6th Test ton in Chennai was also special as he helped him level with the legendary MS Dhoni for joint-most centuries by a wicketkeeper-batter for India in the format. While Dhoni managed 6 centuries in 144 innings, Pant did it in just 58.- Aging like a fine wine, Ashwin, aged 38 years and 2 days, became the oldest man to claim a fifer for India in the longest format. Before Ashwin, Vinoo Mankad held the record, bagging a fifer aged 37 years and 306 days in 1955 Peshawar Test vs arch-rivals Pakistan.- With the fifer in the second innings after a ton with the bat in the first, Ashwin became the oldest player to achieve a double (100 and 5-wicket haul) in the history of men's Test cricket.- Ashwin now has a ton and a fifer in a Test at one venue twice, making him the only cricketer to have such a feat. He had scored a century and had a five-wicket haul against England at Chepauk in 2021 as well.- With his 6 for 88, Ashwin reached the milestone of 750 international wickets. He is now only the fourth spinner to achieve this after Muttiah Muralitharan, Shane Warne , and Anil Kumble.- With 6 wickets in the Test, Ashwin moved up to the eighth spot on the all-time leading Test wicket-takers list, surpassing Courtney Walsh's 519 wickets in the format.- Ashwin now has a hundred and a fifer in the same Test 4 times. And he is only behind England great Ian Botham, who had achieved the same feat 5 times.- Ashwin bagged his 37th five-wicket haul in Tests, helping him tie with spin great Shane Warne for joint second-most fifers in the format. The only one ahead of Ashwin is Sri Lankan legend Muttiah Muralitharan, who has 67 five-wicket hauls.- Ashwin now has 7 five-fors in the fourth-innings, the joint-second most, alongside Warne and Muralidaran.- As Ashwin claimed a six-for on Sunday, he surpassed Anil Kumble on the list of most wickets by an Indian in the fourth innings. Ashwin now has 99 fourth-innings wickets while Kumble has 94. Bishan Bedi bagged 60 while Ishant Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja are joint-fourth on the list.- Ravindra Jadeja now has a 50-plus score and five or more wickets in a Test 12 times. Ian Botham did it 16 times in the format while Shakib Al Hasan and Ashwin have done the same on 11 occasions.- At 37, star Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan logged his most expensive bowling figures in his Test career, leaking 129 runs in 21 overs while failing to take a single wicket across two innings. It was the fifth time in his career that he went wicketless in a Test match after bowling at least 20 overs.- The second day of the Test saw the fall of a staggering 17 wickets, which is now the most at the Chepauk. In the 1979 Test between India and West Indies, Day 3 of the Chepauk Test saw a fall of 15 wickets. In the 2021 India vs England Test, Day 2 and Day 4 also saw the fall of 15 wickets respectively.- India's Yashasvi Jaiswal is now fourth on the list of batters with most runs after first 10 Tests. Australia's Don Bradman had scored 1446 runs while Everton Weekes (West Indies) and George Headley (West Indies) scored 1125 and 1102 runs respectively after the first 10 Tests. For India, the record was previously held by Sunil Gavaskar -- 978 runs. Virat Kohli scored 6 and 17 in the two innings of the Chepauk Test and now has 18 dismissals vs spinners since 2021 in Tests. He has 499 runs at an average of 27.72.",India beat Bangladesh by 280 runs to go 1-0 up in the 2-game series. Ravichandran Ashwin (119) and Rishabh Pant (109) starred in India's clinical win. Ashwin became the oldest player to achieve a double (100 and 5-wicket haul) in men's Test cricket.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113572991,imgsize-52084,width-400,resizemode-4/113572991.jpg"

But the bounce is going to be quite daunting. The beauty about red soil is you put revs on it, there is value and there is bounce,"" PTI quoted Ashwin as saying to reporters in the post-match press meet.The Chennai-based cricketer expressed his preference for playing on red-soil pitches over black-soil ones.""You play on some black clay surfaces around the country, and without naming them, you have to do a lot of hard work, put a lot of revs and see nothing come out of it.""He elaborated on the complexities of different soil types and the experience he has gained from them over the years.""Sometimes it's better to not put revs on it in certain places. So, to even understand all these, and talk about it is a fair amount of learning for me. It's happened over the years. Like I said, this one's got solid bounce. I will any day play on a surface like this and get hit than play on other surfaces.""Lamenting the prevalence of black-soil pitches in the country, Ashwin noted that red-soil pitches have historically been crucial for Test cricket in India.""The surfaces react very differently at different times of the year. We've lost a lot of red soil pitches over the years, which was a key component of playing Test cricket in India.""He advocated for preserving pitch variety rather than standardizing them.""Sometimes around the country, people do make the mistake of terming India as a whole. I actually think India has a lot of foreign soil in its own nature. Sometimes, you go to Eden, it doesn't feel home. Then you go to Dharamshala, all of a sudden, it doesn't feel home.""Addressing misconceptions about Indian pitches, Ashwin emphasized their diverse nature.""For some wild reason, people don't seem to assimilate this because the nature of soil is different, the weather is different.""He concluded by highlighting the lack of uniformity in India's cricket calendar compared to other countries.""It's not like Australia where every Boxing Day Test match happens at Melbourne.

However, they struggled to breach East Bengal’s solid defence. In the ninth minute, Jesus Jimenez and Noah Sadaoui combined well to enter the rival box, with the latter finding Danish Farooq, who cut the ball back to Jesus. The Spanish forward’s curling shot beat goalkeeper Prabhsukhan Gill but got deflected off the far post.The visitors had their best chance of the first half in the 44th minute when Zothanpuia delivered a perfect cross from the left, but Diamantakos failed to connect with the ball. Although the ball fell to Madih Talal, the French midfielder couldn’t capitalise on the opportunity, and Sachin Suresh gathered the ball to avert danger.East Bengal’s decision to introduce Kerala native Vishnu PV in the 57th minute had an immediate impact, as he broke the deadlock within two minutes.

ISL: Mohammedan Sporting concede in injury time again as FC Goa snatch a draw,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/isl-mohammedan-sporting-concede-in-injury-time-again-as-fc-goa-snatch-a-draw/articleshow/113563901.cms,"SATURDAY’S RESULTS

In Kolkata:

In Jamshedpur:

KOLKATA: The way Mohammedan Sporting players sat on the Kishore Bharati Stadium turf after the final whistle on Saturday — some looking blank and others with faces buried in their knees — said it all.For the second game running, Andrey Chernyshov ’s black-and-white brigade conceded a goal in stoppage-time. Unlike their loss against NorthEast United FC in the opener, the ISL debutants managed to eke out a 1-1 draw against FC Goa But it was a victory snatched away from under their feet at the death.Having controlled the proceedings against Manolo Marquez’s visitors, Alexis Gomez became Mohammedan Sporting’s first goalscorer in ISL history when he deservedly put his team in front in the 66th minute, converting a penalty earned by his Brazilian striker Carlos Franca .Spurred on by the partisan crowd, Chernyshov’s team looked headed towards a victory until FC Goa came calling in the fourth of the six-minute stoppage-time and spoiled the hosts’ party. Armando Sadiku — who joined the Goan outfit after being released by Mohun Bagan SG — turned out to be the party pooper, planting substitute Akash Sangwan’s cross with a powerful header from close.While FC Goa — who lost 1-2 to Jamshedpur FC at home four days ago — escaped another defeat, Mohammedan Sporting faced another reminder of the adage that nothing gets over in football until it’s over.Goa started on the front foot but the hosts gradually grew in confidence as the game wore on. Franca was a constant threat to the Goa box, drawing a couple of saves from the rival goalkeeper Laxmikanth Kattimani and hitting the cross piece on another occasion in the opening 45 minutes.FC Goa hold the record of scoring maximum away goals (124) in ISL history but they appeared to have got cold feet in the face of Mohammedan Sporting’s relentless pressure even after the break.Franca — who again missed a couple of sitters — finally earned a penalty when FC Goa's Spanish defender Odei Onaindia pushed the Brazilian from behind, leading referee Aditya Purkayastha to point to the spot. Alexis made no mistake to convert the resultant penalty.Still Goa came calling when Muhammad Nemil rounded goalkeeper Padam Chhetri but Mohammedan Sporting’s defender Zuidika came up with a vital block to deny him.The home fans thought it was enough to clinch the issue. But the next time Goa stormed the box, Sangwan whipped in an inviting cross and Sadiku rose to the occasion to bring home the equalizer for his team and plunge the hosts into another round of stoppage-time ‘heartbreak’.Mohammedan SC 1 (Gomez 66) FC Goa 1 (Sadiku 90+4);Jamshedpur FC 3 (Murray 36, Javi 44, 50) Mumbai City 2 (Karelis 18, Van Nieff 77).",ISL debutants Mohammedan Sporting eke out a 1-1 draw against FC Goa. Alexis Gomez scored the only goal of the game in the 66th minute. Armando Sadiku equalized for the visitors in the 90th minute at the Kishore Bharati Stadium.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113563943,imgsize-72872,width-400,resizemode-4/113563943.jpg"
"Vinicius, Mbappe thwart Espanyol's challenge in Real Madrid's win",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/vinicius-mbappe-thwart-espanyols-challenge-in-real-madrids-win/articleshow/113563080.cms,"Vinicius Junior's introduction from the bench proved pivotal as Real Madrid overcame a spirited Espanyol 4-1 on Saturday, closing the gap to La Liga pacesetters Barcelona to a single point.Despite Thibaut Courtois' unfortunate own goal early in the second half, which handed the visitors a surprise lead, Madrid fought back through Dani Carvajal's equalizer before Vinicius took center stage.The Brazilian prodigy set up Rodrygo Goes for a goal and then found the net himself to seal the comeback. Kylian Mbappe , who has now scored in four straight matches for the club, added a late penalty to put the result beyond doubt.Meanwhile, league leaders Barcelona, boasting a 100% record with five wins from five games, face a tough test on Sunday as they visit fourth-placed Villarreal, who are yet to taste defeat this season. Hansi Flick's men will be looking to reestablish their four-point cushion at the top of the table.""It was hard for us to score goals in the first half but we made so many chances,"" midfielder Luka Modric told Real Madrid TV, as quoted by AFP. ""The team played well... we had a great game and we can be happy, but we have to continue (like this).""The win marked 38th game in a row where Real Madrid did not get defeated. It's been a year since they lost, which was in September last year when Atletico Madrid beat their city rivals.""That says a lot, not losing games in so many weeks is really nice, but we have to continue,"" added Modric. ""It's quality, character, commitment from the team, everyone is ready when called on... those are the key factors.""Carlo Ancelotti, the coach of Madrid, decided to rest Vinicius for the start of the match, given the team's busy schedule. Instead, he chose to play Arda Guler alongside Mbappe and Rodrygo.Throughout the first half, Madrid dominated the game but failed to score. Mbappe was heavily involved, seeking his sixth goal of the season across all competitions. Joan Garcia, the Espanyol goalkeeper, made an impressive save at his near post to deny Mbappe's attempt from a tight angle.Following the corner, Eder Militao's header narrowly missed the target. Mbappe had another long-range effort stopped and also sliced a shot off-target. Growing increasingly frustrated, Mbappe received a booking for arguing against a decision made against him.Jude Bellingham struck a powerful shot from the edge of the box, but Garcia saved it comfortably, resulting in a goalless scoreline at halftime. Madrid has only managed to score one first-half goal in eight matches this season.In the second half, Carlos Romero's off-target strike provided a glimmer of hope for the newly-promoted visitors, but Madrid continued to dominate possession and create chances.However, in the 54th minute, Madrid were left stunned as Courtois inadvertently deflected Jofre Carreras' cross into his own net, giving the underdogs a surprising lead.Ancelotti quickly introduced Vinicius, but it was Carvajal who equalized just four minutes later, tapping in on the line after Bellingham's cross eluded the previously unbeatable Garcia.As Madrid intensified their pressure, Espanyol's defense eventually crumbled. Vinicius showcased his skill with a sublime outside-of-the-boot cross, setting up Rodrygo for Madrid's second goal.The Brazilian then turned provider, unselfishly playing Vinicius through on goal to score the third. Mbappe capped off the resounding victory by converting a late penalty, securing a comfortable win for the home side.","Real Madrid beat Espanyol 4-1 to close gap on La Liga leaders Barcelona to one point.
