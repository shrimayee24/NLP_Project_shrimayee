NEW DELHI: Under-fire Pakistan skipper Babar Azam on Sunday achieved a remarkable feat as he surpassed legendary MS Dhoni in the list of most run-getters as a captain in the history of the T20 World Cup during their match against Ireland in Lauderhill, United States.Riding on Babar's fighting unbeaten knock, Pakistan somehow managed to eke out a narrow three-wicket win in a low-scoring thriller. Despite chasing a paltry target of 107, Pakistan once again slumped to 62 for six in 11 overs. But skipper Babar (32 not out) and Abbas Afridi (17) shared a crucial 33-run stand to take them home at 111 for 7 in 18.5 overs.Already-eliminated from the race of Super 8, Pakistan concluded their T20 World Cup campaign with a third-place finish in Group A while arch-rivals India and co-hosts USA advanced to the next round, finishing at first and second positions respectively.Leading from the front, these captains have demonstrated remarkable skill and composure under pressure, etching their names into the history of the tournament with substantial run tallies.Pakistan's Babar stands atop this illustrious list, amassing 549 runs in just 17 innings.

Renowned for his finishing prowess and strategic acumen, Dhoni’s contributions with the bat were pivotal in numerous tight contests. His calm and calculated approach in the death overs made him one of the most feared finishers in the game, ensuring India’s competitive edge in many tournaments.New Zealand’s Kane Williamson, with 527 runs in 19 innings, holds the third spot and exemplifies consistency and grace under pressure. His tactical brilliance and ability to adapt to different match situations have been key to New Zealand’s success. Williamson’s composed and technically sound batting style has made him a reliable leader and a vital run-scorer for his team.Sri Lanka’s Mahela Jayawardene , accumulating 360 runs in just 11 innings, showcased his class and elegance and takes the fourth spot. Despite playing fewer matches, his impact was profound, often leading from the front and guiding his team through challenging phases with his experience and skill.South Africa’s Graeme Smith, with 352 runs in 16 innings, rounds off this elite group. Smith’s aggressive and fearless approach set the tone for his team, providing quick starts and building solid foundations for South Africa’s innings.",Babar Azam tops the list of most runs scored as a captain in T20 World Cup.

NEW DELHI: Nicholas Pooran etched his name in the record books by playing his part in the most expensive over in T20I cricket history. In the final Group C match of the T20 World Cup against Afghanistan at the Daren Sammy Stadium in St Lucia, Pooran unleashed a brutal assault on Afghan bowler Azmatullah Omarzai , who conceded an astonishing 36 runs in a single over.Hitting eight sixes on the night, Pooran, who also became the first Caribbean batter to score 2000 T20I runs, created history by surpassing Chris Gayle's record for hitting the most sixes in T20Is for West Indies. Pooran now has 128 sixes, four more than Gayle's previous record.T20 World Cup 2024: Points Table West Indies, batting first after Afghanistan captain Rashid Khan opted to bowl, were cruising at 73/1 after four overs, with Pooran and Johnson Charles at the crease.Azmatullah Omarzai, tasked with bowling the fourth over, bore the brunt of Pooran's onslaught, as the left-hander unleashed a barrage of boundaries and maximums.The over in question, bowled by Azmatullah Omarzai, conceded a staggering 36 runs, placing it among the most memorable overs in T20 International cricket. Pooran's assault included a series of powerful shots that left the Afghanistan bowlers and spectators in awe.The over's breakdown is as follows: starting with a six, followed by another maximum, a boundary, leg byes for four runs, a no-ball resulting in a boundary, five wides, and concluding with another six.Notably, Omarzai's over included 10 extras, comprising five wides, a no-ball, and four leg-byes, contributing significantly to the total tally of 36 runs.This onslaught not only boosted the West Indies' run rate but also brought up a 50-run partnership between Pooran and Johnson Charles in just 14 balls.Pooran's batting made the elite list of cricketers who have scored 36 runs in an over in T20 internationals, a record previously set by Yuvraj Singh, Kieron Pollard, Rohit Sharma , and Dipendra Singh Airee.Thanks to his flamboyant batting, Pooran reached his half-century in just 31 balls, propelling the West Indies to a formidable total.

NEW DELHI: Both India and Australia delivered dominant performances, topping their respective groups to advance to the Super 8s of the T20 World Cup. India, who last faced Australia in the ICC ODI World Cup final at home where they lost, will meet Australia again in their Super 8 clash on June 24 at the Darren Sammy National Cricket Stadium in St Lucia.Was the India vs Australia T20 World Cup Super 8 clash pre-determined?Yes, it was.The Super Eight stage groups were primarily determined by seedings assigned to the teams during the preliminary stage, which consisted of four groups.If a pre-seeded team failed to advance to the Super Eight, the seeding was automatically transferred to the next highest-performing team in their group.A notable example occurred when Pakistan were eliminated in the group stage, resulting in the USA, the second-best team from Group A, inheriting the A2 seeding.For the first time ever, the ICC implemented a pre-tournament seeding system for the T20 World Cup. This system clearly outlined the path for Team India, revealing the three teams they would face in the Super Eight, provided they finished in the top two of Group A. India are set to face Australia, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan in the Super 8s.The seeding system effectively rendered group-stage performances irrelevant for teams that finished in the top two positions.For example, Australia had a perfect record in Group B, securing victories against Oman, England, Namibia, and Scotland. Despite their impressive performance, the ICC assigned them the B2 seed, meaning that even if they had finished second in Group B, they would still be matched up against India, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan in the Super Eight.The primary purpose of introducing the seeding system was to provide more clarity regarding the schedule for spectators traveling across the Caribbean islands.However, it inadvertently resulted in several group-stage matches becoming inconsequential.- India- Pakistan- England- Australia- New Zealand- West Indies- South Africa- Sri LankaA1, B2, C1, D2 (India, Australia, Afghanistan and Bangladesh)A2, B1, C2, D1 (United States, England, West Indies and South Africa), June 20, Kensington Oval Barbados, June 22, Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, Antigua, June 24, Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium, St Lucia",India and Australia both topped their respective groups to advance to the Super 8s of the T20 World Cup.

NEW DELHI: The football world's attention is fixed on Germany as it plays host to Euro 2024. This 17th edition of Europe's premier football tournament guarantees a thrilling showcase of talent and passion. From June 14 to July 14, the continent's top 24 teams will compete for the coveted title.Portugal 's star forward Cristiano Ronaldo is determined to create more European Championship history this summer, aiming to add another major international trophy to Portugal's Euro 2016 triumph. The 39-year-old veteran, set to appear in a record-extending sixth Euros, believes his team deserves further success.Portugal begins its campaign against Czech Republic in Leipzig, with Ronaldo expected to play a crucial role. Managed by Roberto Martinez, Portugal had a flawless qualification and is likely to advance comfortably from Group F, which also includes Turkey and Georgia.Ronaldo, now playing for Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia, scored twice against the Republic of Ireland in a recent friendly, increasing his international goals record to 130. His 14 goals in European Championships make him the competition's all-time top scorer, surpassing France 's Michel Platini.Having first appeared at the Euros in 2004, Ronaldo has scored in every edition since, except for one game. He aims to become the oldest Euros goalscorer, currently held by Austria's Ivica Vastic.In other Euro 2024 news, England started their campaign with a 1-0 victory over Serbia, thanks to Jude Bellingham's header. The Netherlands also secured a late 2-1 win over Poland. Denmark, with Christian Eriksen scoring, drew 1-1 against Slovenia in a poignant return to the tournament three years after Eriksen's cardiac arrest.While England is considered one of the tournament favourites, their performance in the opener was underwhelming, with Bellingham being a standout player. Manager Gareth Southgate aims to lead England's talented squad to their first major tournament title in 58 years.GROUP A - Germany, Switzerland, Hungary and ScotlandGROUP B - Spain, Italy, Albania and CroatiaGROUP C -

'They have to find those players...': Virender Sehwag on what Pakistan need to do to remain competitive in T20 cricket,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/they-have-to-find-those-players-virender-sehwag-on-what-pakistan-need-to-do-to-remain-competitive-in-t20-cricket/articleshow/111048709.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former India opening batter Virender Sehwag has suggested that Pakistan need to find batters who can bat with a high strike rate to stay competitive in T20 cricket The Babar Azam-led Pakistan team was eliminated from the current ICC T20 World Cup during the group stage. They lost two crucial matches at the start of their campaign but managed to win their next two games.Despite this, they finished third in Group A with four points, behind India and co-hosts USA.Sehwag emphasized the need for Pakistan to develop more aggressive batsmen to compete at this level in the future. He pointed out that many of Pakistan's batters tend to anchor the innings, similar to how Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan play.""Now Babar Azam and the others have to go back and think about what the way forward is in the T20 format. This team may not be able to win matches against a good team even when they get a good wicket,"" Sehwag said on Cricbuzz.""They have to play differently from the way that Babar Azam plays if they want to play in the next T20 World Cup, that is for sure. There are a few players who play with the same strike rate which is not good enough for T20. They have to find those players with high strike rates, whether it be from the PSL or domestic cricket. And those players have to be given chances. It's not like Babar became the player he is today on his first day itself, he also took time to give consistent performances. So they have to give someone enough time,"" Sehwag elaborated.Sehwag also expressed his disappointment in how Pakistan narrowly won their final group game against Ireland.""We didn't think that (Ireland) would reach 106 runs and we also didn't think that Pakistan would take 19 overs to chase that down,"" former India batter Sehwag said.""What have Pakistan done here, I don't get it. Yes, they won but first they let them go from 32/6 to 106 and then it wasn't like it was a very difficult wicket or that Ireland's bowling was so good that you had to play so carefully in the chase.""Sehwag noted that internal issues within a team can lead to poor performances, even though he admitted not knowing if such issues exist within the Pakistani squad.""This is why we call them unpredictable, you can never tell if they will play well or poorly. In this World Cup they have been poor more often. I don't know what their dressing room is like. If things are fine between the players. That also plays a role.""""If there are players who are unhappy with the captain or if there are two or three groups within the dressing room and so on, that also plays a role, but I say you have to keep those things to the side and think for Pakistan. This match shouldn't have gone on for so long. But fine, at least they won it,"" Sehwag added.Sehwag's comments highlight the need for Pakistan to rethink their strategy in T20 cricket. He calls for identifying and fostering talent that can play an aggressive game, thus increasing the team's chances in future tournaments.",Virender Sehwag says Pakistan need to find batters who can bat with a high strike rate.

NEW DELHI: Lockie Ferguson made history with the most economical spell in T20Is as New Zealand ended their World Cup campaign with a dominant seven-wicket win over Papua New Guinea in Trinidad on Monday.Ferguson's stunning spell of 4-4-0-3 helped New Zealand bowl out PNG for just 78 in 19.4 overs. The Kiwis then chased down the target with 46 balls to spare.Ferguson's performance was remarkable as he joined Canada’s Saad Bin Zafar as only the second bowler in T20I history to bowl all four overs as maidens and return with three or more wickets.

New Zealand’s bowlers successfully kept PNG’s batters on the defensive throughout their innings.Trent Boult played his last T20 World Cup match, starting with a tight two-run over.

NEW DELHI: Gary Kirsten , the head coach of the Pakistan cricket team , has expressed his deep disappointment and frustration with the team's performance in the ongoing T20 World Cup in the USA and West Indies.In a scathing criticism, Kirsten stated that there is ""no unity"" within the team, and he has ""never seen such a situation"" throughout his extensive coaching career.Pakistan's dismal showing in the tournament culminated in a group stage exit, a far cry from their runner-up finish in the previous edition.The team's lackluster performance was marked by a shocking defeat against tournament debutants USA, followed by a loss to their arch-rivals India. Pakistan managed to salvage some pride with a consolation victory over Ireland, but it was too little, too late.According to PTI, reports from Pakistani media outlets suggest that Kirsten, who famously led India to their ODI World Cup victory in 2011, did not mince his words when assessing the team's shortcomings after their elimination from the T20 World Cup.His candid remarks underscore the urgent need for the Pakistan cricket team to address the apparent lack of cohesion and unity within their ranks if they hope to bounce back from this disappointing campaign.""There's no unity in Pakistan's team.

He also mentioned that the team's skill level is significantly lower compared to other teams worldwide.Following Pakistan's loss against India, Kirsten attributed the team's defeat to subpar decision-making on their part.""Disappointing loss, that's for sure,"" Kirsten had said.""I knew 120 was not going to be an easy target.

NEW DELHI: The Indian cricket team commenced their Caribbean leg of the T20 World Cup with a focused and intense practice session. Virat Kohli , Ravindra Jadeja , and Kuldeep Yadav put in extra effort to prepare for the Super 8s stage of the tournament, PTI reported.Kohli struggled to find his footing on the challenging pitches in New York, scoring only 1, 4, and 0 in the group stage matches. Fans and experts alike are hoping for the superstar batsman to regain his form and make a significant impact in the crucial Super 8s and knockout stages.India's first Super 8 match is scheduled for Thursday against Afghanistan at the renovated Kensington Oval.T20 World Cup 2024: Points Table Jadeja, too, has yet to make a notable contribution with either bat or ball. However, the all-rounder was only required to bat once and was not heavily relied upon for his bowling due to the pace-friendly conditions in New York.Kuldeep, who has not featured in the playing eleven thus far, is expected to play a crucial role in the Caribbean conditions, which have traditionally favored spinners.The entire Indian squad participated in the practice session, eager to make the most of the opportunity after not having played since completing the New York leg on June 12. Poor weather conditions in Fort Lauderdale prevented any training or play, making this session all the more important.The pitches in New York were heavily criticized, and now attention turns to the surfaces being prepared at the six Caribbean venues.In the tournament, a score of 200, considered par in the IPL, has only been surpassed twice, both times in the Caribbean. Even a total of 150 has often proven to be competitive.As Indian captain Rohit Sharma entered the practice area, he asked his teammates about the condition of the training pitches. Given the circumstances, his inquiry was not completely unexpected.""Pitch kaisa hain (how is the pitch)?"" he asked his lead pacer Jasprit Bumrah who seemed to be pleased with the surfaces provided for training.Virat Kohli, the first player to enter the nets after warming up on the field, spent at least 30 minutes facing throwdowns before taking on Kuldeep and Hardik Pandya .He focused on lofted drives down the ground and over extra cover, as well as practicing the pull shot against Jasprit Bumrah. One delivery from Bumrah rose sharply from back of length, and Kohli hooked it towards the fine-leg region, resulting in an exchange of wry smiles between the two players.Following a short break, Kohli received gentle throwdowns from Yuzvendra Chahal and coach Rahul Dravid. In the adjacent net, Jadeja worked on his slog sweep and inside-out drive over extra cover against a leg-spinner from the net bowlers.Rishabh Pant, India's most impressive batter in the tournament so far, faced deliveries from Bumrah, Hardik, Kuldeep, and Axar Patel in the nets. Later, Hardik returned to the field to practice his range hitting.The next group to bat in the nets consisted of Suryakumar Yadav , Shivam Dube, and Yashasvi Jaiswal.With the breeze blowing across the facility, Mohammed Siraj and Arshdeep Singh managed to generate significant swing with the ball.","Virat Kohli, Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav put in extra effort to prepare for Super 8s stage.

Kensington Oval

practice arena after meagre returns in the US leg of the tournament

T20 WORLD CUP:

|

BRIDGETOWN: There's a tip for the Virat Kohli fans. If you really love watching the man bat, try getting into one of India's net sessions. And if it's from 45 yards just behind the stumps under the shadow of a Garry Sobers statue at the Kensington Oval, you're a lucky guy. The comfort cushion of the 'exhibition leg' of the T20 World Cup , in the USA, is over. Now, under the sweltering sun of Barbados , India are preparing for their first Super 8 game against Afghanistan on Thursday.The team reached the city of Sobers, the 3 Ws, Malcolm Marshall and many others on Sunday and hit the ground running first thing on Monday. Despite the feel-good factor about the three victories in the USA leg, Kohli's scores of 1, 4 and 0 wouldn't have made him happy. The champion's body language in front of cameras during practice doesn't betray any sense of unease, but deep down he would be bothered.And it's this hunger to turn things around and make it his World Cup that seemed to be driving the modern master when he took guard against the best bowler in the world - Jasprit Bumrah .The Mumbai Indians man wasn't being friendly to Kohli at all in the nets, at least with the ball. It virtually felt like game-time as Bumrah explored his arsenal. ""It doesn't worry us at all that Kohli hasn't got runs in the games in the US. He has been batting beautifully at the nets and he looks all the more hungry,"" Team India batting coach Vikram Rathour had said after the Miami washout on Saturday.Rathour was absolutely right. The short balls aimed at Kohli's rib-cage were pulled ferociously while the ones pitched up were driven beautifully on Monday.Kohli, playing as opener in the World Cup, quite clearly is looking to hit top gear right from the word go, even if he is coming off a rough patch.A game against Afghanistan also entails dealing with wrist-spin. They have the wizard Rashid Khan and baby-faced chinaman Noor Ahmed in their ranks. Kohli needs to prepare for that and who better than Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav to provide necessary practice? While Chahal isn't India's No. 1 wrist-spin choice, Kuldeep is slightly unlucky that he is unable to find a place in the XI for now. The team management, however, has indicated that they want to keep him ready. The pitches in West Indies may just help the spinners and he could well be called on to play at some stage over the next fortnight.While things looked really good for Kohli during the course of his 45-minute batting session, there's another crucial player - Ravindra Jadeja - who is also looking for some batting form. And that's probably the reason Jadeja was one of the first to go into the batting nets with Kohli. He did scratch around a bit, but the team management knows the CSK man is a big-game player.At no stage will there be a discussion to drop him, and that's why captain Rohit Sharma wants his big weapon to be ready for the final leg. After a long stint at the nets, Jadeja and Hardik Pandya were back in the main square, trying some range hitting, another important thing that was sorely missed from their games in the US.The green expanse of the Kensington Oval also gave the Indian fielders chance to practice their drills, something they missed doing in the damp conditions in the US.",Virat Kohli looked hungry during India's practice session at the Kensington Oval.

Smriti Mandhana was also waiting for that opportunity to celebrate the magical three-figure mark in front of Indian fans. Eleven years after making her white-ball debut, it came true on Sunday against South Africa women in the first ODI at M Chinnaswamy Stadium .Smriti, who has played 83 ODIs, scored a match-winning 127-ball 117 in her 36th home ODI, also sixth ton in one-dayers. The opener has ten half-centuries at home in ODIs with her best being 86 against England in 2018. In T20Is, her best (at home) remains the 79 against Australia in Mumbai, 2022 while in Test matches, a 74 against the same team last year at Wankhede is her best score.Smriti was also happy that she scored a ton in a winning cause. “I was mad with myself in the last 4-5 years. Whenever I played at home, be it Tests or one-dayers, I ended up scoring 70-80 runs and throwing away my wicket. More than scoring in India, I could get the team through. But I am also pleased to know that it (century at home) has happened. I hope that it keeps coming and it stays,” Smriti said.The left-hander, who loves to take on the bowlers, had to play according to the situation after India were restricted to 99/5. Being a 50-over game, Smriti had the luxury to be patient and change her game plan to reconstruct the innings. She did just that during the sixth-wicket partnership (81) alongside Deepti Sharma and another stand of 58 runs with Pooja Vastrakar .“The format of one-day cricket is such where you play according to the ball and not think too much. Whenever I was thinking of taking the game on, we lost a wicket, and maybe that helped me stay on. Sometimes I (tend to) go after the bowler around the 80-90 mark, but I did not have that chance (this time). I had to cut down my shots in the middle, and I also played a few dot balls, still had to be calm about it.

NEW DELHI: Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja has indicated that spinners might play a crucial role, even during the death overs, when India begin its ICC T20 World Cup Super Eights campaign against Afghanistan in Barbados, starting June 20.The Indian team maintained an unbeaten record in the group stage, securing wins against Ireland, Pakistan, and the USA, with their final match against Canada on June 15 being washed out by rain.Afghanistan is also undefeated, achieving significant victories against Uganda, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea. They have a group-stage game against West Indies on Tuesday.Speaking to Star Sports, Jadeja mentioned that the pitches in the West Indies are slow and dry, which benefits spinners in the middle overs.""Whenever we play in the West Indies, the wicket remains a bit slow and dry. The match timing is also in the morning so spinners will have help. Even in India, there are many wickets where spinners get help.

You could see spinners being used in the death overs as well,"" said Jadeja.Kuldeep Yadav also echoed Jadeja's thoughts during an interview, highlighting the importance of bowlers' lengths in T20I cricket.""The spinners do get help in the West Indies and so I think four spinners are picked in the squad.

Even the other team has to play on the same pitch, and it is our job to change the way we play.

It was important to get used to conditions, weather, and the time zone here. But then when we moved from one region in the USA to another, the pitches were not the same. Even though in some countries pitches are more similar from place to place, that is not the case in the USA.""""We adjusted as well as we could, but we unfortunately got New York for the first match, and it did not go well for us. In the second match, we went to Dallas and did not adjust well to that pitch. As a team and as a captain we have to take the responsibility for that,"" he concluded.Sri Lanka, once dominant in ICC tournaments, struggled again this year.Since winning the T20 World Cup in 2014, they have not reached the knockout stages in ICC events, except for the 2015 50-over World Cup where they made it to the quarterfinals.In the match against the Netherlands, Sri Lanka was put to bat as the Netherlands won the toss and chose to bowl.Contributions from Kusal Mendis (46 in 29 balls), Charith Asalanka (46 in 21 balls), Dhananjaya de Silva (34 in 26 balls), and Angelo Matthews (30* in 15 balls) helped Sri Lanka set a target of 201/6 in their 20 overs.Logan van Beek was the standout bowler for the Netherlands with figures of 2/45.During their run chase of 202 runs, the Netherlands had a solid start with an opening partnership of 45 runs between Michael Levitt (31 in 23 balls) and Max O'Dowd (11 in 8 balls), but they soon began losing wickets regularly.

Belgium will face Romania next in Cologne on Saturday.Pre-match discussions about Belgium's new generation, shedding the ""Golden Generation"" label and brimming with young talent, were overshadowed by familiar issues.Tedesco's team controlled the majority of the game but lacked clinical finishing, and when they did find the net, they were thwarted by VAR and a resolute Slovakian defense.The absence of Belgium's preferred central defensive duo, Jan Vertonghen and Arthur Theate, coupled with the deployment of left winger Jeremy Doku on the right in the first half and Yannick Carrasco as a left wing-back, contributed to a lack of balance in the team.This uncertainty led to Slovakia's opener, as Doku's poor pass into his own box was not cleared by the defense, allowing Juraj Kucka's effort to be saved before Schranz pounced on the rebound, beating Belgium goalkeeper Koen Casteels from a tight angle just six minutes and five seconds into the match.Belgium had chances to equalize, with Lukaku denied from close range by Slovakia goalkeeper Martin Dubravka after a mesmerizing run from Doku.

NEW DELHI: Belgium and Slovakia will start their Euro 2024 journeys on Monday in Group E . The match is scheduled to take place in Frankfurt at 6 p.m. local time (1600 GMT). Romania and Ukraine are also part of this compelling group of fixtures.Both teams have strong ties to Italian football, adding an interesting layer to the match. Slovakia is coached by Francesco Calzona, a former interim coach at Napoli who worked under Mauricio Sarri. Belgium’s head coach, Domenico Tedesco, was born in Italy but grew up in Germany and holds German citizenship.This will be Slovakia’s third consecutive European Championship since the competition expanded to 24 teams. They reached the round of 16 in 2016 before losing 3-0 to Germany. Historically, Slovakia, when it was part of Czechoslovakia, won the European Championship in 1976.In 1980, Belgium reached the finals, narrowly losing to West Germany. The two teams have no competitive match history, with their last game being a friendly 11 years ago. Belgium won that match 2-1 in Brugge, featuring a young Kevin De Bruyne.Belgium will be without Thibaut Courtois, regarded by many as the world’s top goalkeeper, despite his crucial role in Real Madrid’s Champions League win. Courtois reportedly had a falling out with Tedesco after not being made captain for a game last year. Defensively, Belgium also faces challenges with injuries to Axel Witsel, Jan Vertonghen, and Arthur Theate.

NEW DELHI: Belgium , under the leadership of Kevin De Bruyne , is gearing up to start their European Championship journey against Slovakia in Group E. They share the group with Romania and Ukraine. The match will take place in Frankfurt at 6 p.m. local time on Monday.There’s a notable Italian influence on both teams.

On the other side, Belgium's coach, Domenico Tedesco, was born in Italy but is a German citizen.This is Slovakia's third straight appearance at the Euros as an independent nation, benefiting from the tournament’s expansion to 24 teams. In the 2016 Euros, Slovakia reached the round of 16 but was knocked out by Germany . During their time as part of Czechoslovakia, they won the championship in 1976.

The last time they faced each other was in a friendly 11 years ago, with Belgium winning. Belgium's choice to exclude goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has caused a stir; the decision is linked to a dispute with Tedesco over the captaincy.In FIFA rankings, Belgium holds the third spot and has remained in the top five for the past seven years. Slovakia is ranked 48th. Belgium’s star striker, Romelu Lukaku, has scored an impressive 85 goals for the national team at just 31 years old, exceeding the combined goals of Slovakia’s top three scorers since their independence.

Euro 2024: England hang on to beat Serbia 1-0 with Jude Bellingham header,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/uefa-euro-2024/euro-2024-england-hang-on-to-beat-serbia-1-0-with-jude-bellingham-header/articleshow/111047384.cms,"NEW DELHI: Jude Bellingham 's first-half header gave England a 1-0 victory over Serbia, kicking off their Euro 2024 campaign on a high note. The match began confidently for England but ended with them holding on for the win.Bellingham timed his run perfectly to meet Bukayo Saka's deflected cross, scoring from close range in the 13th minute. The goal came after Bellingham started the move himself, helping put England ahead early in the game.This win placed England at the top of Group C, following Denmark and Slovenia's 1-1 draw earlier in the day. Bellingham stayed involved throughout, driving England's attack and drawing loud cheers from fans at the Arena AufSchalke.Gareth Southgate 's team initially created opportunities down the right side, with Saka combining well with fullback Kyle Walker. Walker's runs were a consistent threat in the first half.However, Serbia gained momentum in the second half, posing more of a challenge. England struggled to replicate their early dominance after halftime.By the end of the match, there were only 11 total shots, with Serbia taking six and England five. This was the lowest shot tally in a European Championship match since at least 1980, according to Opta data.When asked if the loss of momentum indicated that England was still a work in progress, Bellingham took issue with the suggestion.""I don't agree with that,"" he said. ""I think the first half shows why we can score goals against any team and the second half shows why we can keep a clean sheet against any team.""At the start of the second half, Serbia improved their play after coach Dragan Stojkovic substituted Ivan Ilic for defensive midfielder Nemanja Gudelj. Striker Dusan Vlahovic soon sent a dangerous cross through England's box, energizing the Serbian fans.Stojkovic then intensified his offensive strategy by bringing on Dusan Tadic and Luka Jovic just past the hour mark.In response, England's coach, Gareth Southgate, introduced the energetic Conor Gallagher, replacing Trent Alexander-Arnold, who was playing in an unusual midfield position.Another substitute, Jarrod Bowen, set up a precise cross for captain Harry Kane . Kane's header was dramatically saved by goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic, hitting the bar in the 77th minute.Five minutes later, Jordan Pickford made a crucial save, tipping over a powerful shot from Vlahovic as Serbia maintained their pressure.Despite the onslaught, England's restructured defense, featuring the impressive Marc Guehi in his first major tournament and right-footed Kieran Trippier as a stand-in left back, managed to secure the win.Kane acknowledged the performance was not a classic by England. ""Overall a deserved win. It's just about getting through,"" said the England captain.""There was a spell in the second half where we got camped in our box and we found it hard to get out but it was an important win tonight.""England next play Denmark on Thursday after Serbia take on Slovenia.","Jude Bellingham's first-half header gave England a 1-0 victory over Serbia.

Christian Eriksen on target but Danes held 1-1 by Slovenia in Euro 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/uefa-euro-2024/christian-eriksen-on-target-but-danes-held-1-1-by-slovenia-in-euro-2024/articleshow/111042798.cms,"Christian Eriksen found the back of the net for Denmark in a 1-1 stalemate against Slovenia at Euro 2024 in Stuttgart on Sunday, nearly three years after his near-fatal incident during his team's first match at the previous tournament.The Manchester United midfielder put his team in front on 17 minutes in a stadium predominantly filled with Denmark fans, but Erik Janza 's late deflected shot secured a point for Slovenia in their first Euro match since 2000.Also See: UEFA EURO 2024 Schedule Denmark's next Group C encounter is against England in Frankfurt on Thursday, while Slovenia will face Serbia in Munich.According to AFP, Denmark's remarkable run to the semi-finals of Euro 2020, which was postponed due to the pandemic, was fueled by the emotional response to Eriksen's on-pitch collapse in Copenhagen, where he required resuscitation after suffering a cardiac arrest.Following the implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator, Eriksen eventually made his comeback, returning to international football nine months later and participating in the 2022 World Cup.In the lead-up to Denmark's Euro 2024 opener, Eriksen expressed that the traumatic event is no longer a constant thought, instead focusing on helping his nation make another deep run in the tournament.Slovenia midfielder Timi Max Elsnik acknowledged that there would be few surprises between the two sides, as they had finished just behind Denmark on head-to-head record in their qualifying group.Highly-rated Slovenia striker Benjamin Sesko nearly caught Kasper Schmeichel off guard with a powerful long-range effort, but moments later, Denmark struck first.A quick throw-in was flicked on by Jonas Wind into Eriksen's path, who fired a low shot into the far corner to give the Danes the lead.Despite Sesko being closely marked by the Danish defense, Andraz Sporar failed to capitalize on a gap in the backline, miscontrolling a bouncing ball when he appeared to be through on goal.Sesko nearly gifted Denmark a second goal when he inadvertently cleared the ball against his teammate, with Jan Oblak watching anxiously as the ball narrowly missed the target.Eriksen missed a chance to extend the lead just before half-time, while Slovenia defender Jaka Bijol nearly headed into his own net following a Denmark set-piece early in the second half.Oblak made a courageous stop to deny Rasmus Hojlund from doubling the advantage, blocking the United forward's close-range effort to keep his team in the game.As Slovenia pushed for an equalizer, Adam Gnezda Cerin glanced a cross wide, and Sporar stabbed wide while attempting to meet a free-kick.Sesko was incredibly unfortunate to see his powerful drive rebound off the post, but Slovenia soon found their equalizer.Denmark failed to properly clear a corner, and Janza's fierce half-volley from just outside the penalty area deflected off Morten Hjulmand, leaving Schmeichel helpless.Sporar had an opportunity to secure victory for Slovenia after outpacing Jannik Vestergaard, but he shot into the side-netting as Schmeichel appeared to get the slightest of touches.",Christian Eriksen scores for Denmark in 1-1 draw against Slovenia at Euro 2024 in Stuttgart.
