Poll Do you believe that celebrity relationships can remain low-key like Crosby and Leutner's? Yes, absolutely! Not really, it's hard to stay private

Sidney Crosby 15 years long relationship with girlfriend Kathy Leutner





NHL legend Sidney Crosby has not only guided the Pittsburgh Penguins to championship heights but has also established a quiet, solid, long-lasting relationship off the ice with long-time girlfriend American model Kathy Leutner. Though Sidney Crosby's on-ice accomplishments are well-documented, his love life has long been kept under wraps. Kathy Leutner has been his constant companion, regularly seen cheering him on at pivotal matches but never hankering for the limelight herself.The two began dating back in 2008 when they were introduced by common friends. Sidney Crosby was an NHL superstar by then, while Kathy Leutner was establishing a thriving modeling career for brands including Abercrombie & Fitch, Hollister, and Faviana. She was selected in 2011 to appear on Sports Illustrated's model search and was one of the very few women from her agency to receive an in-office interview with the editorial team. Kathy Leutner has been Sidney Crosby's rock since the start of his NHL career. They met when he was just 21 years old, in his third NHL season with the Pittsburgh Penguins.Born in 1986 in Chantilly, Virginia, Kathryn A. Leutner is the daughter of John and Judith Leutner.She graduated from Chantilly High School in 2004 and was offered a partial athletic scholarship from James Madison University, a testament to her prowess in the sport. Despite her strong ties to athletics, modeling quickly took over. She was discovered at a mall near her hometown, just a year after graduating from high school, while shopping with her mother.Kathy began her modeling career in 2005 and got her big break in 2011 when she appeared in Sports Illustrated magazine.Leutner once confessed in an initial interview that sports was her main focus, but the moment she entered the modeling world, she knew that this was what she was meant to do. Her dream came true when she started gracing the covers of Fitness Magazine and landing campaigns for big lifestyle brands.The couple is yet to make any announcements of marriage plans; their long-term relationship speaks of a connection much stronger than social media pronouncements or red carpet sightings. Despite their lack of public announcements about their future plans, fans wish for a potential engagement or wedding.Sidney Crosby and Kathy Leutner are arguably the sport's most low-key celebrity couple, but their almost two-decade relationship is telling. Where fame usually drowns out personal life, this couple shows us that true love doesn't require attention. While Crosby keeps working on building his NHL legacy, Leutner is his biggest fan, sitting quietly in the background while still playing an important role behind the scenes.Also Read: With Mike Sullivan gone and Dan Muse in, Sidney Crosby‚Äôs loyalty faces the ultimate test",Sidney Crosby and Kathy Leutner have been together for 15 years.

Magic Johnson calls out major Indiana Pacers mistake in NBA Finals: ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt beat the Oklahoma City Thunder playing that style‚Äù,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/magic-johnson-calls-out-major-indiana-pacers-mistake-in-nba-finals-they-cant-beat-the-oklahoma-city-thunder-playing-that-style/articleshow/121720358.cms,"Magic Johnson.

Magic Johnson sends a clear message to the Indiana Pacers, pointing out a major mistake







The Indiana Pacers missed a critical opportunity to seize control of the NBA Finals on Sunday night, falling to the Oklahoma City Thunder 123-107 in Game 2. Now tied at one game apiece, the Pacers face growing pressure as the series shifts to Indianapolis, especially after Lakers icon Magic Johnson pinpointed a glaring issue in Indiana‚Äôs offensive game plan.Following the Game 2 loss at Paycom Center, Magic Johnson delivered an unfiltered assessment of what‚Äôs holding the Indiana Pacers back against the surging Thunder. ‚ÄúIf the Indiana Pacers are going to win Game 3, Haliburton‚Äôs mindset needs to be score the basketball right from the tip and get the Pacers into their transition game. In Games 1 and 2, they played too much half court basketball and they can‚Äôt beat the Oklahoma City Thunder playing that style,‚Äù Johnson posted on X.Magic's statement hit at the core of Indiana‚Äôs approach. For the second game in a row, the Pacers stumbled out of the gate. Tyrese Haliburton, who has been the offensive catalyst all season, was once again a non-factor in the first half, registering just three points and three assists on 1-of-5 shooting.Haliburton admitted the Thunder‚Äôs aggressive defense forced him off rhythm. ‚ÄúThis is who they are defensively,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúThey got a lot of different guys who can guard the ball, fly around ... I just got to figure out how to be better earlier in games. Kudos to them, they're a great defensive team. But [I will] watch the film, see where I can get better.‚ÄùThe Thunder, led by a dominant 34-point performance from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, overwhelmed Indiana with ball pressure and rim protection. OKC also got major contributions from Alex Caruso (20 points), Jalen Williams (19), Aaron Wiggins (18), and Chet Holmgren (15), showcasing the depth Indiana is struggling to match.Haliburton, who exited the postgame press conference with a visible limp, pointed to strategic adjustments the Pacers need to make going forward. ‚ÄúOur offense is built from the inside out. We got to do a better job getting downhill. They collapse and then make plays there, but I thought we could improve a lot there.‚ÄùHe also recognized the importance of altering his playmaking dynamics. ‚ÄúWe had some success there, me playing off the pitch a little bit more, flying around rather than if I'm in that high ball screen... that gives them a chance to really load up, pack the paint,‚Äù the Pacers standout shared.He added, ‚ÄúThere are many different ways that you can choose to digest what's in front of you. We just focus on taking it a day at a time. You got the split. You feel good about that. But we definitely wanted to play better tonight.‚ÄùAlso Read: Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson sends praise for OKC Thunder following huge Game 2 win The Pacers now return to Gainbridge Fieldhouse for Game 3 on Wednesday, marking the city‚Äôs first NBA Finals game in 25 years. As the series balanced and the Thunder‚Äôs defensive blueprint worked to perfection, Indiana must act on Johnson‚Äôs advice quickly, or risk falling behind in a series that‚Äôs slipping fast. Regardless, the stakes are high with the series tied 1-1. Of course, Game 3 will not be the decider but it would bring the winner one step closer to the championship dream.","The Indiana Pacers lost 123-107 to the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 2 of the NBA Finals.

Bold prediction! Astrologer Greenstone Lobo picks winner of Australia vs South Africa WTC Final 2025

Australia XI for WTC Final





Australia captain Pat Cummins has named a bold and slightly reshuffled playing XI for the ICC World Test Championship Final at Lord‚Äôs, with Marnus Labuschagne set to open the innings and Josh Hazlewood edging out Scott Boland in the pace attack.Labuschagne, usually a steadfast No.3, will walk out with Usman Khawaja at the top, while teenager Sam Konstas misses out. It‚Äôs a role change Cummins believes suits the team‚Äôs needs and Labuschagne‚Äôs strengths.‚ÄúWith Marnus moving, we thought it‚Äôs one spot up really. It‚Äôs not too different to batting three,‚Äù Cummins explained. ‚ÄúHe has experience, he has done well here at Lord‚Äôs and in England in general.‚ÄùWhile acknowledging the challenges of opening with the Dukes ball in English conditions, Cummins highlighted the potential rewards: ‚ÄúOpening the batting can be tough, but it can also be sometimes the best time to bat, before the ball actually starts swinging. There‚Äôs an opportunity to score there.‚ÄùOn leaving out 19-year-old Konstas, who has impressed in his early outings, Cummins said: ‚ÄúRealistically, he's really young, he's got a long career ahead of him.So hopefully, even by not playing, we can show him there are learning opportunities.‚ÄùA tougher call came in the pace department. Despite Boland‚Äôs proven success in England, Hazlewood was preferred to join Cummins and Mitchell Starc in the pace trio.‚ÄúThere are some guys where you say you've done nothing wrong, don't change a thing ‚Äî and that‚Äôs Scott,‚Äù Cummins admitted. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just really unfortunate to miss out. The message to Scott is this isn‚Äôt the end. There‚Äôs a lot of Test cricket coming up, and age shouldn‚Äôt define selection. Hopefully by rotating our fast bowlers, we can prolong all of our careers.‚ÄùThe rest of the XI sees Cameron Green return for his first Test since back surgery, while Beau Webster retains his spot, providing seam and spin support in the all-rounder‚Äôs role.Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Cameron Green, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Beau Webster, Alex Carey (wk), Pat Cummins (c), Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Josh Hazlewood.",Australia face South Africa in the ICC World Test Championship Final at Lord's.

NEW DELHI: Already retired from T20Is following India‚Äôs T20 World Cup triumph, and having stepped away from Test cricket ahead of the five-match series in England, the two stalwarts ‚Äî Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma ‚Äî will be seen in action when India tour Australia for a three-match ODI series starting in October. Along with the ODIs, India will also play five T20Is during the tour.Cricket Australia CEO Todd Greenberg said Australia is gearing up for a massive summer of cricket, featuring both the Indian men's and women's teams.Greenberg also shared his excitement about the limited-overs series in October-November 2025, which could potentially be the last time Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma don the ODI jersey Down Under.""It's a massive summer of cricket, highlighted by both the Indian women's and men's teams. Also, the Ashes is here. And for the first time in nearly two decades, Australian cricket will be playing international matches in every single capital city and territory across the entire country ‚Äî which, you know, is amazing when you think about the logistical exercise that goes with that,"" Greenberg told reporters.""But to answer the question ‚Äî look, there's a lot of work going into bespoke marketing plans for every game in every city.Some of those will be nuanced to local markets ‚Äî whether we're playing, you know, in Far North Queensland when South Africa are here, or in our big cities when both India‚Äôs men's and women's teams are visiting. So, a lot of work is going into that.""""I think we saw real momentum last year on the back of the BGT series ‚Äî you know, some record-breaking ticket sales. And I anticipate that we‚Äôll see a number of sellouts across the summer, really starting in August and going through until March. This might be a summer like we‚Äôve never seen before, just in terms of the amount of content. And if you think about the quality of the players coming, particularly from India ‚Äî this might be the last time we get to see Virat Kohli or Rohit Sharma play in our country. If that‚Äôs the case ‚Äî who knows, it might not be ‚Äî but if it is, we want to make sure we give them a great send-off and acknowledge the incredible contribution they've made to international cricket,"" Greenberg added.Greenberg also addressed past racism incidents during India‚Äôs previous tours to Australia.During the Sydney Test in 2021, Indian pacer Mohammed Siraj faced racial abuse from sections of the crowd. Both Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah were targeted, prompting the Indian team management to lodge an official complaint with match referee David Boon.""Well, my message is a simple one: everyone should feel welcome and safe in any format of our game here in this country. If there are any instances of inappropriate behavior, we will have zero tolerance for it. People who behave poorly in those areas will be dealt with accordingly,"" Greenberg said.""As I‚Äôve said, I want our Indian fans ‚Äî in fact, all fans, whether they‚Äôre English fans coming for the Ashes or Indian fans arriving for the Border-Gavaskar series ‚Äî to feel welcome, to be able to support their teams, but never to be abused. Anyone engaging in abusive behavior will be removed from our stadiums. We‚Äôll also continue our efforts in educating fans and fostering a respectful environment.""We‚Äôre aware that, from time to time, people may do the wrong thing ‚Äî but we will not excuse that behavior. Those individuals will be removed because attending a match should be considered a privilege, not a right. If you don‚Äôt behave in the way we expect, you won‚Äôt be welcomed. We want to ensure that Indian players and fans ‚Äî and fans from all countries ‚Äî feel very welcome and safe at every one of our venues,"" he added.","India will tour Australia for a three-match ODI series starting in October.

Poll Do you think Vanessa Bryant handled the pregnancy rumors well? Yes, very cleverly No, she should have addressed them directly





After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn‚Äôt a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.‚ÄúMe protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,‚Äù Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant ‚Äôs, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip. No press release needed when you‚Äôve got Rihanna energy with a direct middle finger gesture.The rumors had emerged out of nowhere, with some users pointing to photos allegedly showing a ""baby bump,"" though no timestamps or context were attached to those images. Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there‚Äôs been zero confirmation from her side‚Äîuntil now.In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.‚ÄúThe only way to impress me, is by being a good person,‚Äù the quote read. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.‚ÄùAdding one final touch to her trilogy of clapbacks, she posted another Rihanna meme, this one stating, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not mean, I‚Äôm just not the one.‚ÄùWith the classic Rihanna memes, Vanessa showed that she is busy being a proud mom to her daughters while being the powerhouse of her business ventures. While she does not care about the rumor mill, her reaction explicitly showed that she is urging privacy.Vanessa Bryant, who shares four daughters with Kobe‚Äî Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and the late Gianna‚Äî has remained devoted to family and philanthropy. Most recently, she shared footage of a joyful family ski trip over the holidays, showing the tight-knit bond she maintains with her children.Vanessa and Kobe Bryant tied the knot in April 2001. Tragically, in January 2020, Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna lost their lives in a helicopter crash that also killed seven others. They were headed to Kobe‚Äôs Mamba Sports Academy for a youth basketball game when the accident occurred. Kobe was 41 at the time. The loss shook the sports world and left a lasting impact on fans, friends, and loved ones across the globe. Kobe has left a huge legacy to his name as well, he is considered one the of the elite NBA superstars of all time with astounding stats, records and intense playmaking abilities. His demise created a huge void in the NBA world as fans are still mourning his untimely passing.Since their passing, she‚Äôs kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work. Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Foundation in 2016, aiming to support young athletes. After his death, Vanessa renamed it the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in honor of both Kobe and Gianna. Today, the foundation helps underserved boys and girls in sports, pushing forward the mission they believed in. It's her way of carrying on their legacy with purpose and heart.Vanessa Bryant‚Äôs response was indeed witty and empowering as she hinted that she deserves privacy and reminded the world that while she may be a public figure, her peace and dignity aren‚Äôt up for debate, especially not over unfounded gossip. After the viral response via memes, Vanessa has seemingly closed the chapter as she did not extend the matter any further with any other comments about it afterwards.Also Read: Is Vanessa Bryant pregnant with her 5th child?

A blockbuster deal for Utah Jazz forwardA hypothetical trade scenario by NBA writer Greg Swartz of Bleacher Report outlines how the Lakers could land Markkanen. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:- F Lauri Markkanen- F Rui Hachimura- G/F Dalton Knecht- PG Gabe Vincent- F Maxi Kleber- 2031 first-round pick (unprotected)Swartz explains the rationale behind the move: ""The Lakers will always be on the hunt for stars, yet are limited in trade assets after acquiring Luka Donƒçiƒá at the deadline. Markkanen is probably the best level of player Los Angeles can reasonably acquire and would be a strong third option behind Donƒçiƒá and LeBron James.""Lauri Markkanen brings versatility to the Los Angeles Lakers ‚Äô lineup. Standing at 7 feet tall, he can play both forward positions and even fill in as a stretch center. His skill set addresses two major needs:- Scoring Boost: With a career average of 18.2 points per game, Markkanen provides reliable offense.- Frontcourt Depth: His ability to space the floor complements LeBron James and Luka Donƒçiƒá However, durability concerns linger. Markkanen hasn‚Äôt played more than 60 games in the past two seasons, which could be a risk for the Lakers.The trade costs Los Angeles four rotation players and a future first-round pick. Here‚Äôs what they lose:- Rui Hachimura: A solid two-way forward.- Dalton Knecht: A promising young wing.- Gabe Vincent: A reliable backup guard.- Maxi Kleber: A veteran big with playoff experience.- 2031 first-round pick: The only available pick after the rescinded Charlotte Hornets deal.While the price is steep, the Lakers gain financial flexibility to pursue additional moves in free agency.This trade positions the Los Angeles Lakers to compete immediately while keeping their long-term options open. Lauri Markkanen‚Äôs arrival would solidify their frontcourt, giving them a much-needed third star alongside Donƒçiƒá and James.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors might chase $36 million Chicago Bulls star to boster squad and improve Stephen Curry's title odds The offseason will reveal whether the front office pulls the trigger, but one thing is clear: the Lakers are hunting for upgrades, and Markkanen could be their best realistic target.","Lauri Markkanen brings versatility to the Los Angeles Lakers ‚Äô lineup.

Tua Tagovailoa becomes center of Dolphins minicamp gossip with sudden body transformation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tua-tagovailoa-becomes-center-of-dolphins-minicamp-gossip-with-sudden-body-transformation/articleshow/121761712.cms,"Tua Tagovailoa turns heads at Dolphins minicamp with a bold new look (Image via: Getty Images)

Tua ‚Äôs sudden body change sparks buzz across NFL







Tua Tagovailoa showed up to Dolphins minicamp looking like a different man and fans can‚Äôt stop talking. Just months after viral photos showed him looking bloated and out of shape, the quarterback now looks lean, locked-in, and lighter than ever. But behind the physical change, questions are swirling about what's really going on in Miami.When Tua Tagovailoa stepped onto the field at Dolphins minicamp this week, jaws dropped ‚Äî and not because of a perfectly placed spiral. The 27-year-old quarterback stunned onlookers with a completely new physique, shedding the bulky frame seen just three months ago in now-infamous boat party pictures. Gone is the puffiness; in its place is a noticeably slimmer, sharper Tua.While some fans are applauding the transformation as a sign of renewed commitment, others are digging deeper. Was this a genuine health overhaul ‚Äî or a response to the harsh online backlash that followed his offseason antics? Either way, Tagovailoa has once again become the center of NFL gossip, with social media dissecting every inch of his new look.Last season, Tagovailoa played just 11 games, finishing with 2,867 passing yards, 19 touchdowns, and 7 interceptions ‚Äî solid, but far from elite.His ongoing injury struggles, especially multiple concussions, have raised long-term concerns about his future in Miami. And with Zach Wilson arriving from Denver and rookie Quinn Ewers joining the QB room, the pressure has never been higher.Tua addressed the media with calm confidence, noting a ‚Äúculture shift‚Äù within the Dolphins. But it‚Äôs not the locker room culture fans are gossiping about. It‚Äôs the quarterback‚Äôs body. And in a league that scrutinizes its stars relentlessly, such a drastic shift in appearance was bound to raise eyebrows.Also Read: Myles Garrett sends chilling warning to Aaron Rodgers: ‚ÄúPut him in the graveyard‚Äù Transformation stories are nothing new in the NFL. But when they happen this fast and under this kind of pressure people start asking whether it‚Äôs sustainable or simply for show.

NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh has backed Australia to retain the World Test Championship (WTC) title in the upcoming final against South Africa at Lord‚Äôs, citing their superior familiarity with English conditions as a key factor.Led by Pat Cummins , Australia are aiming to become the first team to win the WTC title twice, having secured the mace in 2023 by defeating India at The Oval in the tournament‚Äôs second edition.In contrast, South Africa, captained by Temba Bavuma, are set to play their maiden WTC final.

They‚Äôve played a lot of cricket in England - Ashes, the last WTC Final - and that experience will count. They understand these conditions better than South Africa. Plus, they‚Äôre a champion side.

Schottenheimer said, ‚ÄúWe try to get four or five or six guys together and just go talk about life. Football rarely comes up. We do football all day long. What I want to know is what Javonte(Williams) named his dog. And where does this story come from, and all those things.‚ÄùThe head coach talked about how camaraderie outside of the gridiron helps each one of the players build camaraderie on the gridiron. Schottenheimer said,‚ÄúFor them to share their stories with their teammates allows them - when they‚Äôre out there on the field, and they‚Äôre having a tough day, and it‚Äôs hot, and they‚Äôre pushing through a padded practice in Oxnard, they‚Äôre able to truly pull together and work together.I think that‚Äôs going to help us finish games - finish practices.When you have a tough moment, you have a tough stretch in the season. You work through those problems because they believe in one another, and more importantly, they love each other.‚ÄùSomeone who values a player outside of the gridiron is trying to turn that person into a great human being first. Once he‚Äôs a great human being, he‚Äôll become a great NFL player on the gridiron! What a well-founded strategy the 51-year-old former offensive coordinator for the Dallas Cowboys has found for the team!The America‚Äôs Team players were tap-dancing to Greek music. They looked happy, contended, and as if they were enjoying their time tap-dancing. At the end of the tap dancing, Joe Milton took center stage, where he performed contemporary dance. But the others around him? They threw glass plates at him! Probably another strategy implied by their head coach? How not to leave your concentration on what you‚Äôre doing (freestyle dancing) when you‚Äôre surrounded by troubles(glass plates thrown and broken all around)? A fan looked worried and wrote, ""Lets not injure Joe Milton WTF BRO. ""On watching the whole of the Dallas Cowboys team make a circle and dance to beautiful, rhythmic Greek music, one fan commented, ‚ÄúThis is smart. It brings camaraderie and makes the qb‚Äôs work to improve their foot work.‚Äù Another fan said, ‚ÄúThis is what building a team looks like.‚Äù A third fan wrote, ""Careful with the hamstring please.""Everybody must be wondering what paintball trips and footwork dance classes have to do with playing or practicing football in the offseason. Some comments over X scream that in particular: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really trying figure out how all this shit he doing translate to winning‚Äù, ‚ÄúAm i the only one who gets a feeling this is gonna end in a disaster‚Äù, ‚ÄúThis is so cringes. Like the Tech companies brought ‚Äúculture‚Äù into the workplace. And a ping pong table‚Äù, ‚Äú5-12 season upcoming‚Äù and ‚Äú6-11 loading as we speak.‚ÄùBrian Schottenheimer is trying his level best to build camaraderie, team spirit, and going-beyond-the-jerseys chemistry, but it just doesn‚Äôt seem to sit well with many, many fans. S ome of them looked angry in the comments section, ‚ÄúWin some games holy sh*t‚Äù, ‚ÄúSh*t like this iz why cowboys wont win sh*t for another30 yrs‚Äù, and ‚ÄúEither this is gunna be very corny and not work for this team or shotty is really up to something for the culture for this team and winning,‚Äù ""If they s*ck this year the memes are going to be f**king brutal,"" and ""And this is how the Dallas Cowboys will win the Superbowl this year . . this is what they need the secret weapon.""One fan says, ""It‚Äôs not a place to judge. If these guys like hanging out with each other, this is what they wanna do who cares."" While another challenges the players, ""I'm not falling for SH*T until I see a DAMN game being played you IDIOTS.""","Dallas Cowboys' new head coach, Brian Schottenheimer, is prioritizing team camaraderie through unconventional methods. He organized a footwork dance class for players and their families, emphasizing personal connections over constant football talk. Schottenheimers believes these activities will foster stronger bonds, leading to improved performance and resilience.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121731767,imgsize-473048,width-400,resizemode-4/121731767.jpg"

How a missed assist turned into a decades-long campaign for John Garrett

A fitting tribute to a humble player and a cherished moment in NHL history







After 45 years, former NHL goaltender and longtime Vancouver Canucks broadcaster John Garrett has finally received official recognition for his role in the final goal of Gordie Howe‚Äôs legendary NHL career. During the second intermission of Game 2 of the 2025 Stanley Cup Final, John Garrett was caught completely off guard. In true Canadian fashion, he had switched the channel to check on a Toronto Blue Jays game, only to be bombarded by congratulatory messages moments later.The play came on April 9, 1980, during a playoff game between the Hartford Whalers and the Montreal Canadiens. Garrett was then the Whalers' goaltender, who played the puck from behind the net to defenseman Mark Howe. Mark sent it up to his father, Gordie Howe, who scored his 801st‚Äîand final‚ÄîNHL goal at the age of 52.""It was a surprise to me, too,"" said the 73-year-old Garrett. ""I'm quite happy that I'm finally getting the assist on Gordie Howe's last NHL goal. There was no trapezoid [rule] back then and I was never a very good puck handler so I had to switch hands on my stick. The puck was in the corner and I went out and threw it around to Mark.And Mark, the great player that he was, made a nice play to Gordie, and Gordie kind of got a fluky goal. But it was still a pretty obvious second assist.""The push to give Garrett the credit he deserved was led by Greg Shannon, a longtime Sportsnet producer and Garrett‚Äôs colleague. Shannon launched the #GiveItToCheech campaign on social media in 2013 and persistently lobbied the NHL to review the historic assist.Initially, the league declined, citing concerns over opening a floodgate of retroactive stat changes. However, persistence paid off. Garrett credits NHL executive vice-president Colin Campbell ‚Äî a fellow alum of the Peterborough Petes ‚Äî for helping to finally push it through.Also read: Toronto Maple Leafs fan Cal finds heartwarming support from NHL community after injury John Garrett‚Äôs connection to Gordie Howe wasn‚Äôt just a single assist ‚Äî it was a bond formed late in Howe‚Äôs career, during the Whalers' years. ‚ÄúIt was great to have Gordie as a friend and teammate. One of the best players on the ice and one of the best human beings off the ice,‚Äù said Garrett. The long-awaited acknowledgment doesn‚Äôt just rewrite a stat line, it cements Garrett‚Äôs place in NHL history.","Gordie Howe scored his 801st NHL goal on April 9, 1980, during a playoff game between the Hartford Whalers and the Montreal Canadiens.

Corey Perry goes full chaos with slash and glove drop in Game 3 meltdown



Mikkola just pointed and laughed, stealing the moment without throwing a punch



Perry‚Äôs rep as a veteran agitator takes a hit and Panthers keep winning the mind games







You know it‚Äôs a wild night in the Stanley Cup Final when the biggest hit isn‚Äôt a goal, it‚Äôs Corey Perry‚Äôs pride. In the final moments of Game 3 between the Panthers and Oilers, Perry, frustrated and fiery, went full enforcer mode. He chopped Niko Mikkola with a brutal two-hander, dropped the gloves, and squared up for a fight. But Mikkola? He just laughed. Literally pointed at Perry and laughed in his face. The move instantly went viral and NHL fans are calling it one of the most savage no-fight moments they‚Äôve ever seen.With Florida cruising to a dominant 6‚Äì1 win and the Oilers visibly unraveling, emotions boiled over. Corey Perry, the 39-year-old veteran known for pushing buttons, delivered a nasty two-handed slash to Mikkola‚Äôs leg, then followed it up with a cross-check to the body. Gloves came flying off as Perry tried to goad him into a fight.This wasn‚Äôt just a minor tussle. Game 3 turned into an all-out penalty fest, with 85 total penalty minutes racked up, the third-highest in Stanley Cup Final history. But even with all that chaos, it was Perry‚Äôs attempted fight that ended up being the most talked-about moment.Instead of throwing hands, Niko Mikkola made a much louder statement with his body language.He looked at Perry, pointed directly at him, and just laughed before skating away untouched. No punches, no reaction, just straight-up mockery.It wasn‚Äôt just a power move. It was the kind of reaction that leaves your opponent embarrassed and everyone else howling. In a game filled with heavy hits and tempers flaring, Mikkola‚Äôs laugh was the most savage clapback of the night.Corey Perry has made a career out of pestering opponents into chaos. He‚Äôs the guy you love on your team and hate when he‚Äôs not. But this time, the trick didn‚Äôt work. Instead of drawing Mikkola into a fight or getting a reaction, he got meme‚Äôd.And for the Panthers? It was another mental win. They‚Äôve not only outscored the Oilers this series, they‚Äôre out-cooling them. Mikkola‚Äôs refusal to take the bait and his cheeky response was just another sign that Florida is playing chess while Edmonton‚Äôs trying to start a bar fight.As the Panthers take a 2‚Äì1 series lead into Game 4, one thing‚Äôs for sure: they‚Äôve got the scoreboard, the confidence, and the social media clout. And Corey Perry? He might want to think twice before throwing hands with someone who throws memes back harder.Also read - Panthers fan spills drink on Kasperi Kapanen after brutal Game 3 loss: NHL fans call it ‚Äúclassless‚Äù","Corey Perry went full enforcer on Niko Mikkola in the final moments of Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final.

How Otto Kemp's versatility strengthens Philadelphia Phillies' roster depth





Otto Kemp‚Äôs impressive major league debut highlights that undrafted players can make a difference when needed, since the 25-year-old rookie‚Äôs three-hit contest helped the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Chicago Cubs 4-3 in extra time at Citizens Bank Park. A Point Loma Nazarene University graduate who had not been drafted and became a free agent last year played very well in his home debut, collecting three hits and making a key bunt single that helped Brandon Marsh win the game with his walk-off. The win ended a five-game losing streak and demonstrated how well the team‚Äôs farm system is working.Otto Kemp‚Äôs first game with the Philadelphia Phillies showed that the team was ready to give a chance to less-noticed players. Rob Thomson, the manager, had already noticed Kemp‚Äôs good batting average and strong approach to the game when he was playing for Triple-A Lehigh Valley.Jacob Smith‚Äôs first major league hit came off Cubs starter Matthew Boyd in the fifth inning, and he aims to remember the moment by framing the ball. Otto Kemp made his way to third base on Boyd‚Äôs missing throw, and then scored after Weston Wilson got an RBI single, making it 2-1 for the Philadelphia team.Otto Kemp stood out mainly because he could perform effectively in stressful situations. In the 2021 St. Cloud Rox summer baseball game, Kemp made his last attempt at a bunt, and now, in the 11th inning, he used a bunt to set up the rally that won the game.Otto Kemp‚Äôs ability to play in multiple spots will greatly benefit the Philadelphia Phillies in the future. While playing in Triple-A, he was the starting third baseman in 33 games, appeared in 17 games at both first and second base, and in seven games in the outfield.Rob Thomson said Otto Kemp might play both first base and the outfield as he begins his major league career. Now that Bryce Harper is out with wrist problems, Kemp gets a chance to help the team right away. The Phillies believe Otto Kemp can handle various playing roles and still continue his offensive success. His 14 home runs and 55 RBI in 58 games in Triple-A showed that he can handle both power plays and key hitting situations.The significant emotions of Otto Kemp‚Äôs arrival were clear as everyone in the family went the extra mile to witness it. His wife brought their dog and drove up from North Carolina, while his parents took a red-eye flight from California also to attend their son‚Äôs first game at Citizens Bank Park.NBC Sports Philadelphia and MLB.TV will be showing the games, so fans can watch Otto Kemp as he follows up on his great debut.Also Read: Why MLB dropped ESPN and what it means for baseball fans in 2025 The Philadelphia Phillies' victory over the Chicago Cubs demonstrated that sometimes the most impactful stories come from unexpected sources.

Breaking down Canucks' 2025 NHL Draft prospect Eddie Genborg

NHL Combine | Eddie Genborg - 07.06.25





The Vancouver Canucks stand at a critical juncture for their future. As the 2025 NHL Entry Draft approaches, all eyes turn to their 47th overall pick and one controversial name: Eddie Genborg. This isn't just about drafting another prospect; it's about defining the team's very identity. Will this Swedish power forward be the missing piece, or another gamble that haunts the franchise?The Vancouver Canucks face a key decision at the 2025 NHL Entry Draft. Holding the 47th overall pick, they're weighing their usual choice: prioritizing skill or power. All attention is on Eddie Genborg, a 6'1"" Swedish winger, who brings both excitement and questions. He's more than a simple prospect; Genborg symbolizes the Canucks' ongoing quest to define their team's future.Genborg is a strong player, weighing 205 pounds. He showed his strength in junior hockey with Link√∂ping HC and played well in Sweden's top league (SHL). He even helped Sweden win silver at the U18 World Championship. While his past play looks good, Canucks fans remember other draft picks who didn't pan out. Hype doesn't always lead to NHL success.Why is Genborg interesting? He hits hard, plays tough, and makes it difficult for opponents. He wins puck battles, gets in front of the net, and causes trouble on the forecheck. Coaches like this kind of play, and fans wanting more grit will likely support it. But the NHL has changed. Today's game values speed and skill, and players who rely too much on size can struggle.Genborg's game isn't perfect. His puck handling is average, his offensive smarts are still raw, and his playmaking vision needs work. He can push through defenders, but he also misses passes or fumbles the puck entering the attack zone. The Canucks need more than just muscle; they need hockey IQ, creativity, and players who can score.

NEW DELHI: The Indian football team suffered a heartbreaking 0-1 defeat to hosts Hong Kong after conceding a stoppage-time penalty in a crucial 2027 AFC Asian Cup Qualifier on Tuesday. The decisive goal came from Stefan Pereira in the 94th minute after a costly foul by India goalkeeper Vishal Kaith.The referee pointed to the spot after Kaith charged off his line and collided with Michael Udebuluzor while attempting to punch the ball clear. Pereira made no mistake from the spot, calmly slotting the ball to Kaith‚Äôs right. The Indian custodian was also shown a yellow card for the late challenge.Earlier in the evening, head coach Manolo Marquez opted to keep veteran striker and talisman Sunil Chhetri out of the starting XI.Despite the raucous support for the home side at the newly built Kai Tak Stadium, India looked promising in the early exchanges and created a handful of chances in the first half, although Hong Kong dominated possession.However, as has often been the case of late, India‚Äôs lack of clinical finishing once again proved costly. Their best opportunity of the half came in the 35th minute when Ashique Kuruniyan, set up beautifully by Liston Colaco‚Äôs run and cross from the left, fired wide from close range.Colaco, who had earlier received treatment for an injury, also tried his luck with a powerful long-range effort, but it went straight into the hands of the Hong Kong goalkeeper.Hong Kong grew into the game as the first half progressed and nearly broke the deadlock through a set-piece, only to be denied by a goal-line clearance from Ashish Rai after Kaith was beaten.Both sides had their moments in a tightly contested opening 45 minutes, but neither could capitalize.Kuruniyan, effective down the flank throughout the match, had another opportunity early in the second half but again couldn‚Äôt convert.In an attempt to inject urgency into the Indian attack, Marquez introduced Sunil Chhetri and Naorem Singh in place of Kuruniyan and Brandon Fernandes.India continued to press for a goal and came close in the 81st minute when Lallianzuala Chhangte delivered a precise cutback to Chhetri inside the box, but the veteran striker failed to make solid contact.The result is a major blow to India‚Äôs qualification hopes, especially after their goalless draw against Bangladesh at home in March in their opening qualifier. With only a few matches remaining, the Blue Tigers will now need to regroup quickly to keep their Asian Cup dreams alive.","The Indian football team suffered a heartbreaking 0-1 defeat to hosts Hong Kong.

Bill Belichick and his girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, might have been together for a couple of years now, but their relationship has constantly attracted criticism due to their controversial age gap.

Growing up, this writer‚Äôs mother often lamented that if one spent as much time poring over textbooks as one did perusing the collective works of Frederick Forsyth, one might have amounted to something worth writing about‚Äîinstead of writing about worthless things. Tautologies, masquerading as jokes aside, Britain too has long mastered the art of making its hypocrisy sound like high wit.TakeThere‚Äôs a hilarious episode where Jim Hacker and Sir Humphrey Appleby team up to pressurise adirector into pulling an embarrassing interview. Theman initially refuses‚Äîuntil Sir Humphrey gently reminds him that failure to cooperate might result in budget cuts and, more scandalously, the loss of seats at Wimbledon and Royal Ascot. They all then solemnly agree that while themustn‚Äôt appear to give in to government pressure, they won‚Äôt air the interview due to ‚Äúsecurity implications.‚ÄùThe brilliance of the scene lies in how comfortable the British‚Äîfor all their lack of tastebuds‚Äîare with poking fun at the very institutions they hold dear. A taxpayer-funded broadcaster that can satirise both the government and itself without missing a beat.But‚Äîas brilliant as it is‚Äîis perhaps only thesecond greatest contribution to the literary arts.The top spot, without contest, belongs to a former Royal Air Force pilot with an eye for detail and a knack for turning geopolitical chaos into page-turning precision: Frederick Forsyth, who departed for Elysium on June 9.And here‚Äôs the kicker: Forsyth might never have become an author at all had it not been for the BBC.Fate‚Äîdisguised as institutional cowardice‚Äîhad to intervene so that he could stumble into his true dharma.The story goes that once his flying days were over, Forsyth joined, before moving on to the Beeb.However, disgusted bydenial of genocide ‚Äì a custom in which the Albion has shown a lot of promise ‚Äì during the Biafra War in Nigeria, Forsyth quit in disgust and started covering the war as a freelancer.However, freelancing, as every freelancer worth her salt will tell you, led to penury. Broke, and living on a friend‚Äôs sofa he wrote the first manuscript of the book that came to be known asostensibly within only 35 days.was initially rejected because it dealt with a rather sticky subject ‚Äì the attempted murder of a very much alive Charles De Gaulle ‚Äì not to mention that the cold, journalistic style of writing, lack of a traditional Herculean hero, overt detailing, and a plot whose ending was preordained.The rest as they say is history.sold over 10 million copies, become the inspiration for two movies, and a limited race-swapped limited series, but to reduce Forsyth‚Äôs legacy tois like calling Bob Dylan the poet who wrote Blowing in the Wind. It‚Äôs simply one arrow in a quiver full of masterpieces.Forsyth was a masterful storyteller, an author who brought a journalist‚Äôs eye-for-detail with a poet‚Äôs gift for storytelling without getting into the literary quagmire of a John Le Carre that could alienate those with more limited grasp of the King‚Äôs.In fact, today, it‚Äôs almost hard to explain to a generation that has grown up on C-Bag, Instagram reels or TikTok videos, the magic that Forsyth produced on his vintage Olympia typewriter (he used them till his death).His attention to detail was legendary and reading his novels wasn‚Äôt just a walk through a story but a tour through space-time, a history lesson more enthralling than anything in one‚Äôs textbook.Take one‚Äôs favouritewhere we move from The Battle of Britain to Vietnam to Milosevic‚Äôs Yugoslavia to an unnamed South American republic with dodgy leaders ending on the night of September 10, 2001 with a plot twist that would boggle your mind.In, we meet mercenaries with a plan that it‚Äôs almost a Cliff Notes on how to carry out aon an African nation. The fact that some mercenaries actually thought they were going to carry out an actual coup bears testimony to its hyperrealism.In, we see the future of Labour politics and Leftism in Britain which will ally with any force inimical to the Western order.In, Forsyth astutely predicts the rise of a Putin-like figure whose expansionist ways will become a threat to Europe if not stopped in time. Unfortunately, Forsyth‚Äôs protagonists only exist in the pages of novels whose effete real world versions pale in comparison. Today, as the world grapples with Putin trying to increase his sphere of influence, the book reads like a prophecy.Forsyth‚Äôs protagonists are a breed apart‚Äîneither the brooding intellectualism of Le Carr√©‚Äôs George Smiley nor the martini-drenched bravado of Ian Fleming‚Äôs James Bond. They are men of method, mission, and moral ambiguity‚Äîshaped more by bureaucracy and battlefield scars than by tuxedos or existential crises. Take Calvin Dexter, the tunnel rat turned avenger, who channels quiet rage into legal vigilantism, or Cat Shannon, a professional mercenary with a conscience honed in Africa‚Äôs cruel geopolitics. Jason Monk, ex-CIA and emotionally flayed by betrayal, stands at the cusp of East-West collapse in Icon.Then there‚Äôs Mike Martin, the SAS ghost who reappears across Forsyth‚Äôs work‚Äîfirst infiltrating Iraq in, then the Taliban inPaul Devereaux, the cold, calculating CIA man in, is the closest Forsyth comes to a Bond figure‚Äîminus the glamour, doubled on ruthlessness.Even the teenage hacker Luke Jennings inis a far cry from traditional spy fiction‚Äîa vulnerable savant weaponised by Adrian Weston, a spymaster who knows the game is rigged. They‚Äôre professionals in a bureaucratic wilderness, soldiers of shadow wars and moral compromise‚Äîproof that in Forsyth‚Äôs world, heroism is about precision, not panache.And inForsyth‚Äôs memoir is a debrief confirming the many things we already know and a few we didn‚Äôt like the fact that he did covert work for MI6, had a dalliance with an East Bloc spy and was part of back-channel talks to de-nuclearise post-Apartheid South Africa.Forsyth‚Äôs memoir is not a celebrity confessional‚Äîit‚Äôs a debrief. He writes of his time as a fighter pilot, his disillusionment with journalism during Biafra, and his covert work for MI6. He describes his writing method with the same precision as his fictional operatives.You finish the book understanding that Frederick Forsyth didn‚Äôt write thrillers. He lived them. Then redacted just enough to publish. And in that, Forsyth was a journalist through and through. And maybe reading his books was far more entertaining, if not useful, than reading one‚Äôs textbooks.","Forsyth was a masterful storyteller, an author who brought a journalist‚Äôs eye- for-detail with a poet's gift for storytelling without getting into the literary quagmire that could alienate those with more limited grasp of the King's Carre.

Combs's ex to face scrutiny on the stand from music mogul's defense,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/combss-ex-to-face-scrutiny-on-the-stand-from-music-moguls-defense/articleshow/121747749.cms,"Sean 'Diddy' Combs





Sean Combs's defense lawyers on Tuesday will question a woman who dated the music mogul up until his arrest, and who has testified in agonizing detail that he pressured her into drug-fueled sex with escorts.After three days on the stand the woman speaking under the pseudonym Jane will face intense scrutiny from defense lawyers who have insisted that what prosecutors deem sex trafficking was in fact consensual.Jane told jurors how the final year of her relationship with the artist known as ""Diddy"" exploded into violence in June 2024.At the time Combs was already under investigation by federal authorities; his homes had been raided, and the now-infamous security footage of him assaulting his ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura in a hotel was public.Throughout her testimony Jane, who began seeing Combs in early 2021, detailed how she had longed for a more traditional romantic relationship with him.But she said 90 percent of their time together resulted in sometimes days-long sex parties that saw Combs direct her to have sex with male escorts while he watched, even as she told him the encounters made her feel ""sleazy"" and ""disgusted.""The June 2024 date at home was meant to be a chill night in, she said, but she and Combs got into a fight over his relationship with another woman.The argument escalated when Jane said she pushed Combs's head onto a marble countertop and began hurling candles.""I was angry with him,"" Jane said. ""It was a built-up mix of everything... I just kept saying that I hated him.""Combs was livid: Jane told jurors he kicked down doors and ultimately put her in a chokehold.She managed to run out of the house barefoot but upon returning hours later he was still there. He kicked and punched her until she had a black eye and ""golf-ball"" sized welts, she said.Combs instructed her to ice the injuries and ""put an outfit on.""Jane told jurors that she put on the requisite heels and lingerie for a so-called ""hotel night"" with Combs and a man he had invited.Through tears Jane said Combs gave her ecstasy and demanded she have sex with the man, and when she protested he said ""you're not going to ruin my fucking night.""When she said again she didn't want to participate, he stood closely to her face as he asked in a ""forceful"" tone: ""Then is this coercion?""Jane ultimately complied, and gave the escort oral sex: ""I just felt like I wasn't even in my own body,"" she said.Jane told jurors Combs paid for her rent at the time and still does. He also continues to fund her legal costs.- 'Sexual trauma' -When Ventura -- who last month testified of physical and psychological abuse in similarily excruciating detail -- filed her 2023 civil lawsuit that opened the door for a federal investigation, Jane said she ""almost fainted.""""There was a whole other woman feeling the same thing,"" Jane said.""I feel like I'm reading my own sexual trauma. It makes me sick how three solid pages, word for word, is exactly my experiences and my anguish,"" she messaged Combs, in text records read in court.After weeks of back-and-forth, Jane said Combs called her a ""con artist,"" and threatened to show sexually explicit videos to the father of her child.She had previously testified at length that she felt ""obligated"" to participate in hotel nights for ""fear of losing the roof over my head"" that Combs was bankrolling.Jane said that following their physical fight in the summer of 2024, they saw each other twice more before his arrest last September.The 55-year-old faces life in prison if convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking.Jane's story was not in the original indictment against Combs, but she was added after receiving a subpoena requiring she testify in November 2024 before a grand jury.She began speaking to prosecutors in January of this year.Jane testified that she told Combs's defense team about the brawl last summer before she told prosecutors.She said she felt ""obligated"" to meet the defense team ""due to my relationship.""Jane has not filed any civil suit against Combs, and said in court Monday she has no plans to.""I just pray for his continued healing,"" she told jurors, ""and I pray for peace for him.""The Manhattan federal trial is expected to last several more weeks.","Defense lawyers will question woman who dated Combs up until his arrest. She has testified in agonizing detail that he pressured her into drug-fueled sex with escorts.

Chicago Sky forwardis on a record-making spree as she surpassesandto become theto scoreafter her last match against the New York Liberty. Even though the team got off on the wrong foot with their losing streak this season, the only two wins that the Sky could rack up were against the Dallas Wings and the Los Angeles Sparks.Despite the disappointing run until now, forward Angel Reese couldn‚Äôt be held back by the opponents in setting new records in the WNBA. She was also the fastest player to reach 20 double-doubles, adding to her previous record of scoring 10 consecutive double-doubles. The unstoppable force continues to rack up scores, reaching the threshold of 17 points with 11 rebounds and 3 assists in her last game against the New York Liberty. Reese achieved the record of fastest 30 double-doubles in just 42 games. Other players right behind her on the list are the Connecticut Sun centre Tina Charles, former Las Vegas Aces player Candace Parker, former Indiana Fever player Natalie Williams and former Los Angeles Sparks player Lisa Leslie.While Reese added another record to her list of achievements, it is also worth mentioning that she is the fastest player to score 20 double-doubles.
