NEW DELHI: India staged a remarkable recovery to thrash Australia by a colossal 295 runs in the opening Test in Perth. Jasprit Bumrah spearheaded India's dominance with a stellar bowling display, registering figures of 3-42 and 5-30. His outstanding performance earned him the Player of the Match accolade, as India wrapped up the match within four days to take a commanding 1-0 lead in the five-Test series.Former England pacer Steven Finn lauded Bumrah's match-winning exploits, highlighting his pivotal role in India's emphatic victory.“Jaiswal scored that brilliant 161. But the player that I loved watching and that I think is actually the best player in the world, bar none at the moment, is Jasprit Bumrah. He is just — he's a joke, honestly. You watch him bowl, and you just think, I'm glad that I don't have to strap my pads on,"" Finn said on TNT Sports during a discussion with former England captain Alastair Cook about India’s dominant display.“I was surprised that India have gone there (Australia) and hammered Australia in what normally is a very hard place to go and play cricket. Perth, I know it's not the WACA; I know it's the new stadium, but still, historically, Australia don't lose many games there. I thought India was so brave,"" Finn added.Bumrah made history by clinching his seventh five-wicket haul in SENA (South Africa, England, New Zealand, and Australia) countries, equaling Kapil Dev's record for most by an Indian bowler in these conditions.During the Perth Test, Bumrah delivered a stellar spell, bowling 18 overs and taking five wickets for 30 runs at an economy of 1.67. His scalps included Nathan McSweeney, Usman Khawaja, Steve Smith, Alex Carey, and Australian captain Pat Cummins.Bumrah now has 118 wickets in 27 Tests in SENA countries at an impressive average of 22.55, with a career-best of 6/33. He shares the record of seven five-wicket hauls with Kapil Dev, followed by BS Chandrashekhar and Zaheer Khan (six each), and Bishan Singh Bedi and Anil Kumble (five each).He also became the fifth Indian captain to claim a five-wicket haul in Tests, joining an elite list that includes Vinoo Mankad (one), Bishan Singh Bedi (eight), Kapil Dev (four), and Anil Kumble (two). The last Indian captain to achieve this feat was Kumble, with 5/84 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 2007.Bumrah's remarkable five-wicket hauls in venues such as Johannesburg, Melbourne, Nottingham, North Sound, Kingston, Cape Town, Bengaluru, Visakhapatnam, and now Perth, cement his reputation as a formidable all-condition bowler.",India thrash Australia by 295 runs to take 1-0 lead in five-Test series.

NBA Season 2024 ’s Week Six went out with a bang; a total of 20 teams were in action in what proved to be a busy Sunday for the league. Players like LeBron James , Donovan Mitchell, Anthony Davis, Luka Doncic, Victor Wembanyama , and James Harden showed out to bring Week Six to a tantalizing finish.Let’s take a look at how the action unfolded by looking back at the best players and top performers from each game from Sunday.The Cleveland Cavaliers continued their fine display of form against the Boston Celtics last night and inched through with a 115-111 scoreline. Following this win, the Cavs have now improved to 18-3 and are now comfortably leading the Eastern Conference. The Celtics aren’t too far behind though; their most recent loss brings them to 16-4, but they’re still holding on to the second seed.Here are the top performers from the Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Boston Celtics:The Rockets and Thunder fought each other over the first seed in the west today. It was a closely contested game that came down to the wire. With three minutes left in the fourth, both teams were tied, but Fred Vanvleet took over and started making clutch shot after clutch shot. He led the Rockets to victory by being their go-to man in the fourth.Following this win, the Rockets have now improved to 15-6 for the season. Another win will be enough to put them over the Thunder, who are the first seed in the West with a record of 15-5.Here are the best performers from their game tonight:Orlando Magic continued to surprise the NBA with their fine form this weekend and managed to beat the Brooklyn Nets. The Magic inched out with a scoreline of 100-92 in what was a difficult game for the Nets. If Brooklyn fails to find their momentum soon, their season could collapse as they are currently 9-12 and hold the ninth seed in the East.Here are the top performers from Orlando Magic vs. Brooklyn Nets:The Grizzlies extended their impressive five-game winning streak by hanging one over the Indiana Pacers this Sunday. Memphis have now managed to grab the third seed in the West and hold a record of 14-7. On the other hand, things are not looking too good for the Pacers, who have fallen to the eighth seed and have a record of 9-12. If things don’t turn around, the Pacers will find themselves in a difficult situation.Here are the top performers from the Indiana Pacers vs. Memphis Grizzlies:While this game did not have any standout performances, 13 players ended up scoring 10+ points.The Knicks blew out the Pelicans tonight and improved to 12-8 with a scoreline of 118-85. They are now the fourth seed in the East and have momentum on their side. A couple more wins, and the Knicks might even crack the top three by the end of next week. The Pelicans, on the other hand, need to head back to the drawing board as they are now the 15th seed in the west and have the worst record in the league after the Wizards.Here are the best performers from New York Knicks vs. New Orleans Pelicans:The Toronto Raptors secured a hard-fought 119-116 victory over the Miami Heat on Sunday night. Toronto’s well-balanced play improved their home record to 5-4. The Heat attempted a late push in the game, but the Raptors stood their ground on the court.Miami came into the game looking for their third straight win but fell short despite the hard push by several top performers, including Bam Adebayo’s 13 points and a season-high 20 rebounds.

"Reports indicate Deion Sanders is being considered for the head coaching position at the Dallas Cowboys, following Mike McCarthy's firing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/reports-indicate-deion-sanders-is-being-considered-for-the-head-coaching-position-at-the-dallas-cowboys-following-mike-mccarthys-firing/articleshow/115790904.cms,"Coach Mike McCarthy of the Cowboys has faced criticism and pressure to be replaced after a poor season start. Dallas owner Jerry Jones is considering a change, potentially hiring Deion Sanders, supported by former NFL quarterback Brett Favre. McCarthy's contract ends after the 2024 season, leaving his future uncertain despite his past successes.

Pressure is increasing for Jerry Jones to fire Mike McCarthy and hire Deion Sanders

Coach Mike McCarthy of Cowboys, had been criticized since the commencement of 2025. When Dallas lost terribly to Tampa Bay in its opener for its wild card round elimination, he looked like being given his pink slip coming out of the offseason for having one too many chances that might just not arrive the following year.In such circumstances, owner Jerry Jones had stuck with faith with his head coach in an uncertain situation. McCarthy appeared to be a guy who was on the way out after a humiliating playoff loss in the first round last season. But, owner Jerry Jones chose to keep the faith in McCarthy, despite uncertainty about his future.Reports indicate Deion Sanders is being targeted for the head coaching job with the Dallas Cowboys. A Hall of Fame quarterback is reportedly backing the move. With a 4-7 record this season and the slimmest of hopes to end their Super Bowl drought, the Cowboys will decide whether to move on from Mike McCarthy at the end of the season. With Jerry Jones believed to be bringing a fresh face to the table, some may believe that McCarthy will receive a new contract because his team lacks stars such as Dak Prescott.Brett Favre, a former NFL quarterback, has endorsed Deion Sanders for the Cowboys, citing his impressive resume from Colorado and Jackson State, as well as his connections to the America's Team. ""If he does go in the direction of firing Mike McCarthy,"" Favre said, ""which I have no idea which way he's leaning. I think he's definitely worthy of a shot.”Favre acknowledged his personal connection with Sanders and his ability to support his character. ""I think the world of him. I know him personally. So, I know what kind of character he has."" Sanders has not shown much interest in taking over the Cowboys, stating that he has a ""kickstand down"" in Boulder.Also Read: Will Demarcus Robinson play against the Saints this Sunday after arrest on DUI suspicion? Rams coach Sean McVay clears the air Dallas signed McCarthy to a five-year deal in 2020, but the 2024 season is his last season under his current contract. Like Dak Prescott, he did not have an extension worked out with the front office. If Dallas does have a turnaround, they might look for a new head coach this coming offseason. Before joining the Cowboys, McCarthy spent 13 seasons as the Packers' head coach. This is his 18th season as a head coach in the NFL. He has a career record of 171-109-2, having won the Super Bowl with the Packers in 2010.Deion Sanders retired as a player and became a sports analyst and coach. He coached the Jackson State Tigers football team to two consecutive Celebration Bowl appearances and the first undefeated regular season in school history. In 2022, he was named head football coach at Colorado.","Mike McCarthy's contract ends after the 2024 season, leaving his future uncertain.

NEW DELHI: With trusted lieutenant Virat Kohli once again headlining the Royal Challengers Bengaluru's (RCB) new 22-member squad, the team will launch another attempt next year to win the elusive Indian Premier League (IPL) title.The team's think-tank pieced together the new squad during the two-day IPL mega auction held in Jeddah on November 24-25.

They also spent big to acquire Indian wicketkeeper Jitesh Sharma.RCB shelled out a big amount to get the services of Australian fast bowler Josh Hazlewood as the leader of their pace attack alongside swing bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar.While the team will decide its new captain in due course, there are reports that Kohli might return to lead the side once again.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru will launch another 22-member team next year to win the elusive Indian Premier League next year.

NEW DELHI: The two-day Indian Premier League (IPL) auction concluded in the port city of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia on November 25, with Rishabh Pant emerging as the costliest buy, breaking the record of biggest price tag with a pay-cheque of a staggering Rs 27 crore from the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG).Batter Shreyas Iyer came a close second with a bid of Rs 26.75 crore, shelled out by the Punjab Kings.Rishabh Pant, who was not retained by Delhi Capitals (DC) and is currently playing the Test series in Australia, was bought by the LSG after an intense bidding war with Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Delhi -- taking his base-price of Rs 2 crore to a record rise. It will be the first time that Pant will move out of his hometown Delhi to play for another IPL side, and it required LSG to empty their pockets, breaking the record set by Australian pacer Mitchell Starc last year with his Rs 24.75 crore bid from Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). In all likelihood, Pant will lead the LSG side, especially because KL Rahul is no longer with the Lucknow team.Shreyas Iyer took home a whopping Rs 26.75 crore pay-cheque from Punjab. Released by KKR ahead of the auction, Iyer had led the franchise to their third IPL title in 2024, after missing the entire 2023 season due to a back injury. However, he was still not retained by Kolkata. The 29-year-old was originally bought by KKR for Rs 12.25 crore in 2022, taking on the role of captain following seven seasons with Delhi Capitals. Punjab, who were also looking for a marquee player to lead the side, might appoint him as their skipper for the 2025 season.Venkatesh Iyer turned out to be a surprise star at the IPL 2025 mega auction, with reigning champions KKR splashing a massive Rs 23.75 crore to bring him back into the fold. The left-handed Iyer was not retained by KKR ahead of the auction. Iyer entered the auction with a base price of Rs 2 crore, with KKR making the first move for the star performer of their title-winning run in the last edition and eventually winning the bid after an intense battle with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB).England white-ball captain Jos Buttler laughed his way to the bank as he raked in a jaw-dropping Rs 15.75 crore from 2022 champions Gujarat Titans (GT). After an intense three-way bidding war, GT secured the services of the England superstar for a whopping price. Buttler, who was not retained by Rajasthan Royals ahead of the auction, was part of the franchise for the last seven editions. Before joining Royals in 2018, Buttler had represented Mumbai Indians in 2016 and 2017 editions. Buttler also brings with him valuable experience and leadership qualities.KL Rahul was part of the marquee list at the auction and had a base price of Rs. 2 crore. He had entered the IPL auction after not being retained by LSG despite being their captain last season. Rahul has been a vital asset for multiple franchises over the years, including the Lucknow, Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings), Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Sunrisers Hyderabad. With Pant no longer with DC, Rahul is the most likely candidate to lead the Delhi team in the 2025 season.Rajasthan Royals (RR) snapped up England pacer Jofra Archer for Rs 12.50 crore. The Royals, known for their strategic picks, brought back Archer, adding a world-class bowler to their roster. Archer, who played his last IPL season in 2020, was added back to the shortlist three days before the auction. The right-arm pacer made his comeback this summer after a lengthy injury layoff, featuring in England's white-ball series against Pakistan, Australia and the West Indies, as well as the T20 World Cup.MI bagged veteran New Zealand pacer Trent Boult, known for his early strikes with the new ball, for Rs 12.50 crore. The move will reunite the Kiwi left-arm pacer, who took 16 wickets in last IPL season but was still released by Rajasthan, will reunite with India’s ace fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah at MI. The pair was instrumental in Mumbai's title-winning campaign in 2020. It was their fifth and last crown. Overall, Boult has represented as many as five teams: Sunrisers Hyderabad, Kolkata Knight Riders, Delhi Capitals, Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals in the cash-rich league.Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) has successfully re-acquired the Australian right-arm pacer Josh Hazlewood for Rs 12.5 crore. Having previously contributed to RCB's impressive 2021 season, Hazlewood is set to lead their pace attack once again. His proven skills in generating bounce and movement will significantly enhance RCB's fast-bowling department.Ishan Kishan will be turning up for a new franchise in the IPL as the youngster was sold to SRH for Rs 11.25 crore, which is 26% less than Rs 15.25 crore MI paid to buy him in the 2022 auction. Mumbai started the bidding for Kishan at his pace price of Rs 2 crore but didn't go beyond Rs 3.20 crore. Delhi Capitals, looking for a wicketkeeper-batter after Rishabh Pant wasn't retained, were in an intense bidding war with Punjab Kings before SRH joined the action late and got his services.Chennai Super Kings secured Afghanistan's young talent Noor Ahmad for Rs 10 crore after a fierce bidding contest ensued between Mumbai Indians and Chennai for the left-arm Afghanistan spinner's services. Initially acquired by CSK for Rs 5 crore, Ahmad's price doubled when GT's attempt to get him with the 'Right to Match' card was thwarted by CSK's elevated bid of Rs 10 crore. Chennai's acquisition of Ravichandran Ashwin, the retention of Ravindra Jadeja from IPL 2024 and the addition of Ahmad has established a formidable spin-bowling unit that appears well-suited to their home-ground conditions.","Indian Premier League (IPL) auction concluded in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia on November 25.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest wrestlers of all time, WWE legend, Ric Flair wasn’t always known to be the righteous man he portrayed to be in the ring. Recently, former WWE star, Stevie Richards shed light on how an interaction with Flair led him to punch a wall at the DoubleTree Hotel.Richards made it to the hotel along with TNA Icon AJ Styles. The two made their way to the bar, where they were met by Flair. Immediately, Flair asked Styles to “ditch that jobber,” as he referred to Richards, and then asked him to drink with the ‘big stars.’Here’s what Richards had to say about the incident on The Stevie Richards Show:“I've never felt so small and dressed down and offended and hurt and angry, and, dude, I punched a wall in the hallway at the DoubleTree, which I've never.""Richards further said, ""I didn't punch a hole in it. I'm not quite that strong, so I could have punched Ric and he could have laughed at me and beat my a** and wiped the floor with me, but I've never been disrespected.""Richards went on to reveal that he and Flair came face to face the very next day. During their second meeting, Flair was completely different and greeted Richards like a true gentleman. Richards explained that it was as if their first encounter had never occurred in the first place. To this day, he regrets not telling Flair “off,” after he pretended to forget about their earlier encounter.There is a possibility that Flair genuinely forgot about his behavior, but a certain wall in the DoubleTree and Stevie Richards’ fists will surely remember. Richards’ silver lining is that AJ Styles didn’t abandon him when Flair asked him to, and went on to play games with him somewhere in the hotel that night.Where do you think Stevie Richards’ career would be if he had punched Ric Flair instead of a random wall in the hotel? Let us know in the comments below.","Former WWE star, Stevie Richards shed light on how an interaction with Flair led him to punch a wall at the DoubleTree Hotel.

Rishabh Pant became the most expensive player at IPL 2025 Auction and in the history of the league after the flashy left-handed wicketkeeper-batter was acquired by Lucknow Super Giants for Rs 27 crore. Pant became LSG's obvious choice as team leader as they broke bank for his credentials.Shreyas Iyer had become the most expensive IPL player for a brief period when Punjab Kings spent Rs 26.75 crore on him. He had played his cricket for defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders last season and led them to the title.While Pant and Shreyas were expected to draw big bids after not being retained by their respective franchises, the third biggest bid of the IPL 2025 Auction came out of nowhere. KKR broke bank for one of their own in the form of Venkatesh Iyer, bringing him for Rs 23.75 crore.Another notable signing over the two-day IPL Auction was that of 13-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi. From a base price of Rs 30 lakh, the teenager went to Rajasthan Royals for Rs 1.10 crore in a deal that captured the attention of many.Out of the national team setup for over two years, Bhuvneshwar Kumar’s experience found high demand among IPL franchises, with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) securing his services for Rs 10.75 crore on Monday.The second day of the mega auction turned out to be lucrative for several Indian pacers, while some big names, including Shardul Thakur, Prithvi Shaw, Ajinkya Rahane, Kane Williamson, and Glenn Phillips, went unsold.Set to turn 35 before the start of the next IPL season, Bhuvneshwar boasts an impressive record of 300 wickets in 287 T20 matches with an economy rate under eight.Other notable deals included Deepak Chahar, who fetched Rs 9.25 crore from Mumbai Indians despite his injury history, and Mukesh Kumar, retained by Delhi Capitals for Rs 8 crore through the RTM card. Lucknow Super Giants also invested heavily, signing Test pacer Akash Deep for Rs 8 crore.Among the all-rounders, Krunal Pandya earned Rs 5.75 crore from RCB, who were in need of an experienced spin-bowling all-rounder. Rajasthan Royals made significant bids for Tushar Deshpande (Rs 6.50 crore) and Nitish Rana (Rs 4.20 crore), while Delhi Capitals secured former RCB skipper Faf du Plessis at a bargain base price of Rs 2 crore. Gujarat Titans acquired Washington Sundar for Rs 3.20 crore in another smart move.The scarcity of quality Indian seam-bowling all-rounders worked in favor of South Africa’s Marco Jansen, who secured a Rs 7 crore deal with Punjab Kings. Also making a major gain was veteran New Zealand pacer Trent Boult who was bought by Mumbai Indians for Rs 12.5 crore -- highlighting the demand for quality fast bowlers.Meanwhile, the auction reflected the high demand for Indian talent despite the limited options, ensuring lucrative deals for even fringe players.On Sunday, the first day of the auction, most of the high-profile names raked in the moolah as the franchises virtually emptied their pockets to bag the priority players in their respective shortlist.Led by Rs 27 crore Lucknow Super Giants spent to buy star wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant, the sum of money splurged by the franchises came to a whopping INR 467.95 crore.Pant edged past Shreyas Iyer, who fetched Rs 26.75 crore from Punjab Kings, as teams went all out for marquee Indian stars. Venkatesh Iyer took home a whopping Rs 23.75 crore from KKR.A total of 84 players from the roster of 577 were presented on the opening day at the Abadi Al Johar Arena. Out of these 68 got sold, while four were retained through the Right-to-Match card.Among other big buys, leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal attracted Rs 18 crore from Punjab Kings, who also used the Right-to-Match card to bring back paceman Arshdeep Singh for Rs 18 crore. KL Rahul was picked up by Delhi Capitals for Rs 14 crore.Meanwhile, the BCCI has taken a significant step by announcing the schedules for the IPL for the next three seasons. This is a departure from the usual practice of releasing schedules closer to the tournament.The 2025 IPL will commence on March 14 and conclude on May 25.The IPL Auction 2025 showcased a dramatic and competitive bidding war, with several franchises securing high-profile talent to strengthen their squads for the upcoming season. The second day saw Indian pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar topping the chart with a hefty price of INR 10.75 crore, reflecting the high demand for experienced fast bowlers despite his long absence from the national team. This influx of Indian talent demonstrates how IPL franchises value local players, often resulting in hefty bids even for those not part of the national setup.Franchises made smart moves by picking up key players based on specific team needs. Deepak Chahar, for example, fetched Rs 9.25 crore despite a history of injuries, highlighting the increasing reliance on proven seamers. Meanwhile, Mumbai Indians, who often make shrewd investments, secured both Mukesh Chahar and Deepak Chahar, bolstering their pace attack for IPL 2025. Lucknow Super Giants also impressed with strategic buys like Akash Deep, further reinforcing their depth in bowling.Notably, there was also a surge in the prices of all-rounders like Krunal Pandya (Rs 5.75 crore) and Washington Sundar (Rs 3.20 crore), whose versatility adds immense value to their respective teams. This indicates that franchises are looking for players who can contribute with both bat and ball, especially in the high-pressure, multifaceted environment of the IPL.The auction was also marked by some surprising omissions. Players like Shardul Thakur, Prithvi Shaw, Ajinkya Rahane, and Kane Williamson, who are usually regarded as top performers, went unsold, pointing to the shifting dynamics of IPL team strategies. While these players' exclusion may have shocked fans, it underlined the intense competition for spots and the changing nature of what franchises are looking for in their squads.Overall, the 2025 auction was a testament to the evolving nature of IPL strategies—teams focused on a mix of experience, youth, and flexibility. As the season nears, fans can look forward to an exciting and unpredictable tournament, with new combinations and fresh talent ready to light up the IPL stage.","Bhuvneshwar Kumar, out of India's national team for two years, fetched a hefty Rs 10.75 crore from RCB in the IPL 2025 auction. Deepak Chahar and Mukesh Kumar also secured lucrative deals. Rishabh Pant became the most expensive player on Day 1, going to LSG for Rs 27 crore.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115654073,imgsize-87934,width-400,resizemode-4/115654073.jpg"

Plenty of Test captaincy contenders when Rohit Sharma decides to call it a day

NEW DELHI: Indian cricketers draw huge crowds wherever they go and when it comes to superstars like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , fans do tend to go berserk for an autograph or a selfie.The stupendous victory in Perth in the first Test and the win against Prime Ministers XI in the two-day warm-up match in Canberra under their belt, the Indian team is a confident lot.As the Indians landed in Adelaide for the pink ball Test against Australia starting from Friday, the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) shared a video of Indian captain Rohit Sharma signing autographs after the victory in Canberra on Sunday.The video, shared with the caption, ""The wait of a decade finally ends.

Christian McCaffrey's Injury Threatens to Sideline Him for the Rest of 2024 Season



It was a more than game loss for the San Francisco 49ers in their match against the Buffalo Bills. 49ers' star running back Christian McCaffrey's injury woes have taken another devastating turn. The All-Pro suffered a PCL injury during Sunday's loss to the Buffalo Bills , casting a significant doubt over his availability for the remainder of the 2024 season.McCaffrey, known for his dynamic playmaking ability, was injured during the second quarter when he stepped awkwardly on a sweep to the left on a snow-covered field. The injury led to a 5-yard loss, and McCaffrey immediately went down, requiring medical attention on the sidelines. He was later ruled out for the remainder of the game after halftime.After the game, 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan revealed that McCaffrey had suffered a PCL injury, and there were growing concerns about his ability to return this season. As Shanahan expressed, it felt like a ""nightmare"" for the team, especially given McCaffrey’s recent strong performance in practice. ""It was frustrating,"" Shanahan shared. ""He had a great week of practice, and I could feel his urgency and stuff. Thought he came out great, looking real good. He looked like he just got his shoestring there, he was about to break a house call."" Shanahan also mentioned his concern for McCaffrey, saying, ""I'm guessing he got hurt on that play... hurt for him and tough for our team that that happened to him.""Following the injury, McCaffrey was seen walking very slowly using crutches, with a large brace on his right knee, according to Bills reporter Sal Capaccio. ESPN also reported that McCaffrey would undergo an MRI to assess the severity of the injury. The running back had already missed the first eight games of the season due to bilateral Achilles tendinitis, making his potential extended absence even more devastating for the 49ers.Also Read: Christian McCaffrey exits game against Bills after suffering apparent non-contact knee injury McCaffrey had signed a two-year, $38 million extension in June, securing his place with San Francisco through the 2027 season.

If PCB doesn't accept hybrid model, Champions Trophy could be played outside of PAK, without PAK

NEW DELHI: former Pakistan captain Babar Azam has been struggling with a significant dip in form across formats over the past year.In Test cricket, Babar has failed to score a fifty in his last ten innings, resulting in him slipping out of the ICC Top 5 Test batters rankings. His Test average for the year is under 20, a stark decline from his earlier performances.In ODIs, Babar's runs and average have also dropped, and Pakistan's disappointing showing in the ODI World Cup 2023 , where they failed to progress beyond the group stage, further amplified criticism.Babar's T20I numbers are relatively better but not enough to compensate for his struggles in longer formats.Now with the Champions Trophy scheduled to be held next year, Babar Azam's form is again under scrutiny.In a video that is doing the rounds on the internet, former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar , during a talk show, shares his opinion on what Babar Azam needs to do for Champions Trophy.Shoaib Akhtar says, ""He's a star, I back him, but the thing is with the new management, new mindset, he has to change his neurological wiring because the new management will not consider him in T20s, as a matter of fact, even for the one-dayers. Otherwise the Champions Trophy is the time and the place where Babar needs to be on the forefront for Pakistan. He should dominate the tournament and needs to score three match-winning hundreds in the Champions Trophy to prove himself in the format. Otherwise, the path will be very difficult.""Babar has historically performed well in ICC tournaments, including the 2017 Champions Trophy and other major events. His ability to anchor innings and deliver under pressure has been a hallmark of his career.Pakistan won the last edition of the Champions Trophy by defeating India in the final at The Oval on June 18, 2017.","Former Pakistan captain Babar Azam has been struggling with a significant dip in form across formats.

Damage CTRL vs. Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriguez was also highly action-packed. On top of that CM Punk delivered a promo which was expected by most fans. Here are the results of the latest edition of Monday Night Raw.CM Punk returned after Survivor Series: WarGames to a massive ovation on Raw. He reflected on his battles and laid out his vision for the future, potentially involving the Royal Rumble or Elimination Chamber. However, Seth Rollins interrupted and soon their their rivalry appeared to reignited with fiery words about unfinished business.Their war of words quickly turned physical which propelled Sami Zayn and Jey Uso to step in. Later, Rollins accused Zayn of poor judgment and rekindling old wounds tied to Roman Reigns and the Bloodline. The heated confrontation escalated into a challenge, setting up an explosive clash later in the night, “If that’s how you want it, fine by me” Rollins said before walking off.Damage CTRL’s Kairi Sane and IYO SKY had a massive brawl against The Judgment Day members Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriguez on the latest episode of the Red Brand. Rodriguez dominated early in the match and landed a big boot on Kairi Sane knocking IYO SKY off the apron.Rodriguez teamed up with Liv Morgan and set the tone as she powerbombed Morgan onto Sane for a near-fall. Sane and SKY momentarily came back and appeared stronger with a springboard dropkick and an InSane Elbow but Rodriguez's power proved too much. After a hard-fought exchange, Rodriguez nailed Sane with a decisive Tejana Bomb for the victory.Result: The Judgment Day defeated Damage CTRL.The first-ever match for the Women’s Intercontinental Championship Tournament began with an all-out brawl.

Big E vowed to manage the team until medically cleared, but his return was met with anger. Woods and Kingston accused him of abandoning them, choosing “me” over “we.” They have rejected Big E’s proposal and told him to leave. It appears that The New Day as we knew it is no more as they have turned heel leaving fans stunned as the stable fractured.The match began with Rey Mysterio showing quickness, but Gunther’s raw power dominated. After Mysterio slapped him, Gunther booted him to the floor. Rey countered a Powerbomb attempt into a hurricanrana, stunning Gunther into the ring post. Mysterio gained momentum with a tope suicida, but Gunther soon took control. Mysterio hit a 619 and a Frog Splash, but the moves were not enough to pin down Gunther as he kicked out. Mysterio couldn’t recover after Gunther delivered a brutal Powerbomb to secure the victory.Result: World Heavyweight Champion Gunther defeated Dominik Mysterio.The match started with the crowd loudly chanting “Butch.” R-Truth dodged a clothesline, but Dunne quickly leveled him and stomped away. Dunne dominated in the match targeting R-Truth’s face and head while taunting the crowd. However, he was distracted by the chants, and glaring at the commentary table, Dunne lost focus. R-Truth seized the moment, rolling him up for a surprise victory.Result: R-Truth with the win.Zayn asked for it and he got it. The match began with Rollins and Zayn locking up but Rollins was with the early control. Zayn countered as soon as he sent Rollins outside before teasing a dive.

India Playing XI for Adelaide Test: Big selection headaches for India

Batting legend and former India captain Sunil Gavaskar has ruffled a few Australian feathers by hinting that Josh Hazlewood might have been dropped, contrary to the official reason of 'side strain' given for his unavailability for the second Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy in Adelaide .In his latest column for 'mid-day', Gavaskar has hinted that Hazlewood might have paid the price for putting the blame on batters in his comments during the first Test in Perth , which Australia lost by 295 runs.""The panic in the Australian ranks is palpable, what with former players calling for heads to be chopped off and some even hinting at cracks in the Australian team after Josh Hazlewood's media interview at the end of the third day's play, where he suggested that it was up to the batters to now do something,"" Gavaskar wrote.Australia batters failed to take advantage after bowling India out for a mere 150 and the hosts' first-innings folded up for a mere 104 against an unplayable Jasprit Bumrah, who took five wickets. The Aussies were bowled out for 238 in their second innings.After the third day's play, Hazlewood's comments suggested a divide in the Australian camp.""You probably have to ask one of the batters that question,"" the pacer had said when asked about Australia failing to take advantage. ""I'm sort of relaxing and trying to get a bit of physio and a bit of treatment, and I'm probably looking mostly towards the next Test and what plans we can do.""A couple of days after the match, it was announced that Hazlewood has picked up a side strain and thus won't play the Adelaide Test.Gavaskar found the timeline of the development ""strange"".""Now, a few days later, Hazlewood is out of the second Test and possibly the series too with a supposed side strain. Strange, that, since nobody had noticed anything wrong with Hazlewood at that media conference. Mystery, mystery — the likes of which used to be common in Indian cricket in the past.

Who could replace Rohit Sharma as Team India's captain in Tests?

NEW DELHI: Legendary Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has lashed out at the Australian media, labelling them as 'scaremongers' following India’s impressive victory in the Perth Test .The cricketer-turned-expert accused the media of creating wild narratives of the WACA pitch ahead of the first Test to create unnecessary pressure among the Indian batters.The Perth Test saw India display remarkable resilience and skill, silencing critics with a commanding 295 runs win at the Optus Stadium. India currently lead the 5-match Test series for Border-Gavaskar Trophy 1-0, aiming for a third consecutive series win on Australian soil.Gavaskar’s comments underline his frustration with biased reporting and his defence of the team’s stellar performance on foreign soil, reinforcing the value of fair and objective cricket journalism.""All the boasts about how the pitch is going to be pacy and bouncy and scare the living daylights out of the Indian batters were exactly that - the boasts of a bully. Mind you, it wasn't the Aussie players but their support staff in the media, both electronic and print, who were trying to be scaremongers,"" Gavaskar wrote in his column for Sportstar on Monday.Gavaskar praised the Indian batters for outshining the hosts, securing a remarkable win despite being bowled out for 150 in the first innings. After the batting setback, the bowlers stepped up brilliantly, dismissing Australia for just 104. In challenging pacy and bouncy conditions, the Indian batters showcased immense resilience and skill, posting an impressive 487/6 declared in the second innings to seal the victory.""It was very similar to 2007/8 after the kerfuffle between Harbhajan Singh and Andrew Symonds in the Sydney Test match. The Australian selectors had added Shaun Tait to the Aussie squad for the next Test match in Perth, and the media were going nuts, suggesting he was going to blow the Indians away on the fast, bouncy WACA pitch in Perth,"" wrote Gavaskar.Gavaskar also believes there is evident panic within the Australian team environment, pointing to Josh Hazlewood ’s comments following their massive defeat to India in the opening Test.""The panic in the Australian ranks is palpable, what with former players calling for heads to be chopped off and some even hinting at cracks in the Australian team after Josh Hazlewood’s media interview at the end of the third day’s play, where he suggested that it was up to the batters to now do something.""Now, a few days later, Hazlewood is out of the second Test and possibly the series too with a supposed side strain.

Jordan Mason is on injured reserve due to an ankle injury

San Francisco 49ers running back Jordan Mason is on injured reserve due to an ankle injury sustained against the Buffalo Bills. Mason, the 49ers' primary running back, was sidelined due to Achilles tendinitis, while star Christian McCaffrey was dealing with both injuries. Both players have been in the IR since Week 13. The 49ers will turn to rookie Isaac Guerendo to take over the backfield responsibilities.San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey sustained a season-ending knee injury in a loss to the Buffalo Bills. He was put on injured reserve with a PCL sprain and is expected to miss at least six weeks of action. The same was said of Jordan Mason, the same being San Francisco's backup who also suffered an ankle injury. Mason, 25, was a breakout star for the 49ers early in the season. He replaced McCaffrey as the team's bell-cow back and ran for 147 yards and a touchdown in the team's season-opening win against the New York Jets.49ers coach Kyle Shanahan confirmed that third-year running back Mason sustained a high-ankle sprain during San Francisco's Week 13 loss to Buffalo and that he is currently on injured reserve due to the injury, which will cost Mason at least four games. There are only five games left in the 2024 NFL season, so Mason's earliest possible return would be Week 18. If the 49ers do not make the postseason, they may decide not to bring Mason back, so he can rest for the 2025 NFL season, as San Francisco is currently 5-7 and last in the NFC West.Mason signed with the San Francisco 49ers as an undrafted free agent in 2022. He entered the 49ers' opening 53-man roster coming out of training camp. On December 15, 2022, he iced the game over the Seattle Seahawks with a 56 yard run; it also sealed the outcome for the 49ers to win the NFC West. In Week 17, against the Las Vegas Raiders, he scored his first NFL touchdown. In the 2022 season, Mason had 43 carries with 258 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown in 16 games. In the 2023 season, he played in all 17 games. Mason rushed 40 times for 206 yards, with three touchdowns.Also Read: “He’s gotta grow up”: Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin had a blunt response for George Pickens after his bad penalties vs the Bengals McCaffrey and Mason are left out on IR after Elijah Mitchell was lost to a season-ending hamstring injury.

and Co's favour

What India need to do to qualify for World Test Championship final

Scenario 1: If India beat Australia 5-0, 4-1, 4-0 or 3-0

Scenario 2: India beat Australia 3-1

Scenario 3: India beat Australia 3-2

Scenario 4: India draw series 2-2 against Australia

Scenario 5: If India lose the BGT by a 2-3 margin

The comprehensive 295-run victory against Australia in the Perth Test gave India a major boost in their attempt to qualify for the 2025 World Test Championship Final. The result pushed Australia to the second spot on the points table, while India claimed the top position.A couple of days later, the equation changed again with South Africa's emphatic triumph over Sri Lanka at Kingsmead, Durban. The victory saw the Proteas overtake Australia and claim the No. 2 spot, pushing the Aussies to No. 3.Still, there are three months left before the WTC points table is finalised, and the situation is already looking quite fluid.Practically, India, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and Sri Lanka (the current top 5) are all in the running for the top two spots. While the victory at Perth has brightened India's hopes of going to Lord's which seemed unlikely after the 3-0 home drubbing to New Zealand, Rohit Sharma's men still have a long way to go before they can be assured of a spot in the WTC Final.TOI deconstructs the scenarios in front of India to reach the summit clash for the third successive time.A series win for India by such a comprehensive margin would see Rohit Sharma's men qualify for the final without having to depend on results of other series in the ongoing WTC cycle. Such a scoreline will all but rule out Australia, the current holders of the mace, from the race.If India secure a 3-1 victory versus Australia in the five-match series, they will be able to qualify for the final if South Africa do not beat Sri Lanka in the second Test of their ongoing series.However, a 3-1 series win for India coupled with Sri Lanka suffering a defeat to South Africa in the second Test, would see India drop out. Even a draw between South Africa and Sri Lanka would be enough for India to go through.Such a scoreline would make qualification quite tricky. This means India would need help from the Lankans, who will have to secure at least a draw against Australia in their two-match Test series in Sri Lanka starting January 29.What should serve as an encouragement to the Islanders is the fact that both the Tests are scheduled at Galle, a spin-friendly venue, where Sri Lanka are almost unbeatable. Galle to Sri Lanka is what the Gabba was to Australia before India breached the fortress in 2020-21 and West Indies did it earlier this year.If the Border-Gavaskar series ends 2-2 after five Tests, India's qualification chances reduce further. If that happens though, they would pray for South Africa to beat Sri Lanka 2-0 in the ongoing series and the Lankans beating Australia 1-0.Interestingly, even a 2-3 loss to Australia would still keep India in the hunt for a final berth. But for that, a lot of series results need to go in favour of Rohit Sharma & Co.The ongoing New Zealand-England series needs to finish 1-1, South Africa, the hosts, have to draw both the series vs Sri Lanka and the following series vs Pakistan 1-1 and finally, Sri Lanka vs Australia have to play out a 0-0 draw in the two Tests. At Galle, that seems highly improbable.","India beat Australia by 295 runs in the Perth Test. The result pushed Australia to the second spot on the points table, while India claimed the top position.

India Playing XI for Adelaide Test: Big selection headaches for India

Australia suffered a huge blow when Josh Hazlewood was ruled out of the pink-ball Test against India in Adelaide , which put the focus on right-arm pacer Scott Boland to replace him for the second Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy . But India got a good look at Boland with the pink ball in the warm-up fixture at Canberra, which many in Australia believe has put India at an advantage.Boland was named in the Australian Prime Minister's XI squad well before Hazlewood's side strain made him unavailable for the day-night Test in Adelaide. But cricket experts and the Aussie media believe that Cricket Australia could have withdrawn him and not let India warm-up against the 35-year-old seamer.Australian journalist Tom Morris questioned if the CA selectors have done the ""right thing"".Speaking on SEN radio, Morris said: ""Did the Australian selectors do the right thing playing Scott Boland against India? Would it have been better for him and Australia to go into this game with India not having seen him with a pink ball?""Boland has played 10 Tests in his career so far since his debut in the Boxing Day Test of the 2021 Ashes series. But he has been out of the side since the Leeds Test of the Ashes in July last year.""I probably expected to play at some stage last summer with seven Tests because of the New Zealand tour as well,"" Boland was quoted as saying by yahoo.com. ""Obviously with those guys (Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc) being so resilient, they don't miss too many and no one wants to give up their spot at any stage.""They were so dominant last summer, they weren't bowling a heap of overs. We were able to win most of those games, so I probably thought maybe the opportunity had passed.

#LIVE: India vs Australia, Pink-Ball Test: Rohit Sharma's batting position, the ideal attack & more

NEW DELHI: Former Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh believes skipper Rohit Sharma will feature in the top order during the second day-night Test against Australia, starting December 6 in Adelaide.Harbhajan expects Rohit to either open the innings or bat at number three, ruling out the possibility of the 37-year-old playing lower down the order in the pink-ball encounter.Rohit missed the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Perth, where KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal delivered a stunning 201-run opening partnership in the second innings. Their exceptional stand propelled India to a commanding 295-run victory.In the recently concluded warm-up game ahead of the day-night Test, Rohit came in at No.4 against Australia Prime Minister's XI that left everyone guessing about Rohit's batting slot for the second Test.""I don't see Rohit coming in at number five or six. Either Rohit will open with Yashasvi Jaiswal, with KL Rahul coming in at number three, or he will bat no later than number three,"" Harbhajan told PTI.""Number six for Rohit wouldn't be in best interest of the team. Your top four in batting order should be the four pillars and someone like Rohit at the top would only add greater fillip.""Harbhajan also commented on the selection of Washington Sundar over Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja in the first Test. He considered it a significant decision.""Washington had showed during the New Zealand series that he is ready to take over the mantle from Ashwin in coming days,"" the 'Turbanator' said.Addressing Ashwin's age as a potential factor, Harbhajan offered his perspective.""I don't think 38 is old. He is not a 58- year-old. But yes, after so many years, the shoulders do experience fatigue and wear and tear, so the zip can just be a bit less.""On the drama surrounding the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy, Harbhajan urged the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to accept the 'Hybrid Model' which proposes that India play its matches in Dubai.""Ask all players, they would say they are ready to play in Abu Dhabi or Dubai. In any case, we don't see too many Indo-Pak games as such, and Pakistan should keep their ego aside and agree to the 'Hybrid Model'.""There is a security concern (for India) and I have been saying this since 2022,"" he added.","Harbhajan Singh believes skipper Rohit Sharma will feature in the top order during the second day-night Test against Australia.

Is Ding Liren looking to stretch the world chess championship match to tie-breaks? Gukesh looks set to take risks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/is-ding-liren-looking-to-stretch-the-world-chess-championship-match-to-tie-breaks-gukesh-looks-set-to-take-risks/articleshow/115916113.cms,"D Gukesh

NAGPUR: Is Ding Liren trying to repeat the script of his 2023 world championship title by stretching his match against the challenger, D Gukesh , to the tie-breaks?In a battle of strategy and nerves at the World Chess Championship in Singapore, the reigning champion appears to be biding his time, relying on patience and calculated defense to stretch his match against the 18-year-old Gukesh into tie-breaks -- a format where Ding thrives.On his way to become the world champion last year, Ding defeated Ian Nepomniachtchi in the tie-breaks -- matches in faster time control. In the shorter format, Ding is world No. 2, and Gukesh has a lowly 46th rank as per FIDE rapid ratings. In the classical format, Gukesh is world No. 5, while Ding is at the 22nd rank.While Ding seems to prefer cautious play, the youngest-ever challenger to a world title has electrified the championship with his bold, risk-taking approach. The way the challenger refused to accept the draw by repetition and chose to gamble in the crucial sixth round shows that Gukesh aims to close the championship in the classical format.Gukesh’s approach impressed world No.1 Magnus Carlsen , who suggested on Take Take Take that he wants Gukesh to take more risks which will put pressure on Ding forcing him to make a mistake. “Had Gukesh played King G7 on the 37th turn (instead of moving his rook), he would have won the game,” he pointed out during the Game 6 recap.When Gukesh refused to accept a draw in the sixth game, most of the computer engines thought the game would turn Ding’s way but the Indian GM thought otherwise. On Monday, when Carlsen analysed the round-6, he explained how Gukesh with black pieces could have put pressure on Ding and had a chance of winning the game as the Indian GM had active pawns.Of six games played so far, the crucial sixth round was the longest where Gukesh stretched it to 46 moves and 4 hours, 35 minutes. Gukesh and Ding have won a game each and drawn four rounds to remain at par in the championship with three points each, both are 4.5 points away from winning the title.All the four games that ended in a draw by repetition, the 32-year-old Ding was the one who initiated the action to repeat the moves.The dramatic sixth round gave the impression that Gukesh will be the one who will end the deadlock of drawn games in the championship when he didn’t accept a draw through three-fold repetition on the 26th move and eventually split the points on the 46th turn.In the fifth round, which lasted for 40 moves, Ding, with the black pieces, initiated the repetition process from the 34th turn. The game was heading towards threefold repetition, and both players agreed to split the points on the 40th move.In the fourth round, Ding had the opening advantage with the white pieces, but the Chinese GM started repeating the moves from the 38th turn and drew the game on the 42nd move.Similarly, in the second round, Ding, with the white pieces, initiated the process from the 19th turn, and after threefold repetition, the game ended in a 23-move draw. While Ding defeated Gukesh in the opening round, the Indian challenger brought parity by winning the third game.Being the youngest challenger to any world champion, Gukesh is ambitiously making his moves on the board while Ding has not been at his aggressive best. After he tried to repeat his Game 6 opening of the last year’s world championship against Nepo which Gukesh didn’t allow on Sunday, Ding in the post-game conference said, “Last time too, in Game Six, I won a beautiful game in London, so this time I wanted to repeat that success.” The hint is clear that the Chinese will come up with more repetition in the remaining eight games with an intention to stretch the match to tie-breaks.With six games played and both players locked at three points each, the clash is shaping up as a duel of contrasting philosophies, with Gukesh pushing to settle the score in the classical format and Ding seemingly eyeing rapid play to retain his crown.","Ding Liren and D Gukesh are locked at three points each in the World Chess Championship.

South Africa 's former Test players Thami Tsolekile and Lonwabo Tsotsobe face legal proceedings following their arrest on corruption charges linked to match-fixing allegations, with potential imprisonment if found guilty.Ethy Mbhalati, a domestic player, was taken into custody last month and faces corruption allegations along with Tsolekile and Tsotsobe.Tsolekile and Tsotsobe had previously received extensive cricket bans alongside other players. The pair appeared before a specialised commercial crimes court in Pretoria on Friday, where they received five charges under the country's anti-corruption legislation.Under South African anti-corruption laws, offenders may receive up to 18-year prison terms in certain cases. However, two other players previously involved in the same scandal received suspended sentences after entering guilty pleas.Tsolekile and Tsotsobe were apprehended in March regarding a 2015 domestic tournament match-fixing case in South Africa. A special police unit had been investigating the two players since 2016.The 2015 Ram Slam T20 tournament investigation revealed that Gulam Bodi, a former South African international batsman, approached players to manipulate matches or specific aspects of games on behalf of Indian bookmakers. Subsequently, Bodi received a five-year prison sentence for his attempts to orchestrate match-fixing.The investigation team concluded that whilst players had discussions about potential match-fixing, no actual manipulation took place.Two other players were handed suspended prison sentences after pleading guilty following their arrest in 2021 and 2022.The 44-year-old Tsolekile, a right-handed batter, has played three Tests. In 2016, he received a 12-year cricket ban. Tsotsobe, 40, is a former fast bowler who represented South Africa across all formats between 2009 and 2014.

Selection dilemma for India ahead of Adelaide Test

#LIVE: India vs Australia, Pink-Ball Test: Rohit Sharma's batting position, the ideal attack & more

NEW DELHI: The recent omissions of seasoned players Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja from the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy have sparked widespread discussion.Former India selector Devang Gandhi has come forward to shed light on the reasoning behind these decisions, emphasising that the team management's focus is firmly on current strategies rather than past records considering the factor when one plays in Australia or England.""I do feel that the current form has been taken into consideration. The Indian team management wanted to go in with a team that had confidence and not exactly looking at the past records,"" said Gandhi while talking to news agency PTI.With 536 Test wickets to his name, Ashwin stands as a genuine cricket legend, yet his immediate prospects appear uncertain in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy. His inclusion in the playing squad might only materialise if any of the forthcoming four pitches necessitate deploying two spin bowlers.Should the pitches continue to favour pace and bounce, as witnessed in Perth, the 38-year-old spinner faces a significant challenge in securing his spot in the playing eleven. This situation could change only if the team's preferred choice, Washington Sundar , delivers poor performances.Even in such circumstances, Jadeja, who possesses better batting statistics in SENA (South Africa, England, New Zealand, Australia) nations, is likely to be preferred over the Chennai-based spinner.""Washy bowled well against New Zealand and is a reliable lower middle-order batter. So it does make sense,"" Gandhi, who was the selector from 2016-17 to 2020-21, said.The bowling lineup is expected to remain unchanged for the Pink Ball Test in Perth, following the established pattern.It's worth noting that Ashwin's finest bowling performance in Australia and SENA nations occurred during the December 2021 Day/Night Test at Adelaide, where he claimed impressive figures of 4/55 in the only Australian innings.However, Ashwin's recent performance in the home series against New Zealand, where he managed just nine wickets despite two matches being played on spin-friendly tracks, makes it challenging for him to secure a spot in the current playing eleven.""In Australian conditions, you want a restrictive option. This is not to say that Washy can't be attacking but India's bowling game plan will revolve around Jasprit Bumrah , Mohammed Siraj and Harshit Rana. If Mohammed Shami is included at later stages then he too. So a spinner's job will be to give respite to these speed merchants and bowl one line,"" Gandhi said.""Also you need to be a steady batter. He did well in Brisbane last series and also looked good in Perth during the second essay. He batted well in Canberra. He is going to be the first choice,"" Gandhi added.The primary challenge for Ashwin lies in his inability to secure even one five-wicket haul while playing in SENA nations.His statistics in SENA countries show 71 wickets across 43 completed innings. His finest bowling performance stands at 4 for 55, while requiring 83.7 balls on average (approximately 14 overs) to claim each wicket.In comparison, Jadeja has claimed 52 wickets in 35 completed innings, including one five-wicket haul (6/138) achieved in 2014. His bowling efficiency mirrors Ashwin's at 83.7 balls (14 overs per wicket).Jadeja's preference in team selection has largely stemmed from his superior batting performances in these nations, boasting five half-centuries and one century, maintaining an average close to 30. In contrast, Ashwin has registered only two half-centuries.Their joint inclusion appears likely only at Sydney, contingent upon Washington's fitness and the pitch conditions. However, should conditions favour two spinners, the team management might opt for Jadeja ahead of Ashwin.",Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja were left out of India's squad for the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

Yuvraj's worried teammates then gathered around him as he held on to his painful left ankle.
