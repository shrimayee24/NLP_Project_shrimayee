NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli has gone on record more than once that he will never play for any other team in the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) except Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ).RCB had bought Virat Kohli for a price of USD 30,000 for the 2008 IPL after he led India to victory in the 2008 U19 World Cup.In the 2008 IPL auction, Delhi Daredevils (now Capitals) had a chance to go for Kohli but they opted for Pradeep Sangwan, a left-arm pacer, to beef up their bowling unit and then RCB bought Kohli.In all these years, RCB have failed to win the IPL trophy since 2008 even though they have reached the final thrice - in 2009, 2011 and 2016, but Virat has stuck to his words and has remained loyal to the franchise.In 2008, RCB was co-owned by Vijay Mallya and ahead of the team reaching the playoffs after a remarkable turnaround, Mallya sent across his best wishes to the team and Virat.Mallya posted on X, ""When I bid for the RCB franchise and I bid for Virat, my inner instinct told me that I could not have made better choices. My inner instinct tells me that RCB have the best chance to go for the IPL Trophy. Onward and Upward. Best of luck.""After a poor start to IPL 2024, RCB won six consecutive games to qualify for the playoffs.RCB take on Rajasthan Royals in the Eliminator on Wednesday and if they win, they will play Sunrisers Hyderabad in Qualifier 2 for a spot in the final where they will meet Kolkata Knight Riders","RCB bought Virat Kohli for a price of USD 30,000 for the 2008 IPL.

NEW DELHI: Sanju Samson 's Rajasthan Royals face a tough challenge in the IPL Eliminator against an in-form Royal Challengers Bengaluru. RR , who were once in contention for a top-place finish, suffered a series of defeats and a washout in their last game, finishing third behind Sunrisers Hyderabad.In contrast, RCB staged a remarkable comeback after a poor start, winning six consecutive games to secure a playoffs berth.Led by Faf du Plessis , they recently eliminated defending champions Chennai Super Kings.Despite being favourites earlier, RR now find themselves as underdogs. Their batting and bowling weaknesses were exposed in the last few games, especially after the departure of Jos Buttler. They will rely heavily on Yashasvi Jaiswal, skipper Samson, and Riyan Parag to turn things around.RR's strong bowling line up could be crucial, considering the venue for the Eliminator is not known for high scores. RCB, on the other hand, boast the top run-scorer of the season, Virat Kohli , and a resurgent du Plessis. Rajat Patidar has also provided stability at the top.RCB have coped well with the absence of Will Jacks and have the experienced Dinesh Karthik in good form lower down the order. Kohli and du Plessis' partnership, along with their bowling options, make them a formidable opponent for the struggling Royals.In their head-to-head encounters, the Rajasthan Royals and the Royal Challengers Bengaluru have faced off 31 times, with RCB holding a slight advantage, having won 15 matches compared to RR's 13 wins.The pitch at the Narendra Modi Stadium has been balanced throughout the season, offering assistance to both batsmen and bowlers. However, as the season progresses, the pitch might become wearier, favoring the spinners more.In the eight matches played at the Narendra Modi Stadium in IPL 2024, teams batting second have won five times, indicating that chasing could be a preferred option. The average first innings score is 173, while the average second innings score is 170, suggesting that the pitch remains consistent.For fantasy cricket, spinners could be valuable picks due to the pitch assisting them in the middle overs. Additionally, top-order batsmen from both teams could be excellent choices, as the pitch is best for batting with a new ball.He has been a standout performer, scoring 504 runs in 13 innings with great temperament and maturity. He has been consistent and is a key player for RR.He has had a stellar season, scoring 708 runs in 14 matches. He is the highest run-scorer in the tournament and a must-pick for fantasy contests, currently holding the IPL 2024 Orange Cap He deserves credit for RCB's turnaround, scoring 361 runs in 12 innings. His form has provided solidity to RCB's batting line up.The Australian all-rounder, has contributed with both bat and ball, scoring 228 runs and taking 9 wickets in 12 matches. His quiet effectiveness makes him a valuable pick for fantasy teams.

NEW DELHI: England great James Anderson has admitted there are moments when he questions his upcoming retirement from Test cricket , although he is content with his decision ""90 percent"" of the time.The most successful fast bowler in Test history, with 700 wickets, Anderson announced earlier this month that the first Test against the West Indies at Lord's in July would mark his farewell to England duty.Anderson, who will turn 42 next month, acknowledged on Wednesday that he sometimes contemplates continuing his career, especially given that he has reached an age where most pace bowlers have long since retired.""In my head I feel like I could play for 10 years,"" Anderson told his BBC Tailenders podcast. ""Obviously I realise that is not realistic.""Some days I wake up and wish I was not retiring but then 90 percent of the time I'm happy with it.""Not many people in sport get the chance to retire from sport at over 40. I'm happy I've made it this far.""Only spinners Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralitharan have taken more Test wickets than James Anderson. The England spearhead needs nine more wickets in his final match to surpass the late Australia hero Warne's tally, with Muralitharan leading the chart with 800 Test wickets.Anderson's decision to retire from Tests followed discussions with captain Ben Stokes , head coach Brendon McCullum , and director of England men's cricket Rob Key, as the team seeks to refresh their attack ahead of the 2025/26 Ashes in Australia.Despite his retirement from Test cricket, Anderson could remain involved with England in a backroom capacity during the rest of the season. He has yet to decide whether he will continue to represent Lancashire , where the end at the county's Old Trafford headquarters in Manchester is named after him.In recent years, speculation about Anderson's future has been a recurring theme, with the swing specialist admitting that the constant talk has been a mental burden.""There's probably been two or three moments on the field, if the opposition are 500 for three, I'll be thinking, 'do I really want to still be doing this?'"" he said. ""They are fleeting thoughts -- nothing that has stuck with me for more than an over.""I don't know how much of that was me and how much it was the external noise that comes with ageing. For the last six years, or even longer, it's been, 'how long can you go on for?'""That in itself, certainly for the last couple of years, has been quite draining.""","James Anderson admits there are moments when he questions his retirement from Test cricket.

AHMEDABAD: Rajasthan Royals batter Riyan Parag (36 off 26 balls; 2x4, 2x6) added another chapter to his evolution as a cricketer on Wednesday. Even when he lost his captain Sanju Samson to a reckless stroke and Dhruv Jurel was involved in a contentious run-out, Parag maintained his composure.Shimron Hetmyer and Rovman Powell too came to the party to take RR, who were chasing a 173-run target, past RCB by four wickets here on Wednesday.RCB's six-match winning streak ended in the Eliminator while RR will now play Sunrisers Hyderabad in the second qualifier in Chennai on Friday.The over that changed the tide in RR's favour was the 16th by Cameron Green, in which Parag hit him for a six inside out over extra cover before deftly placing him past short third man for a four. Hetmyer's maximum meant the over yielded 17 runs. This was followed by a Yash Dayal over, in which 11 runs were scored.Despite Siraj dismissing Parag with a yorker and Hetmyer being brilliantly caught by Faf Du Plessis in the 18th over, Powell, who grabbed four catches in the first innings, took them over the line with an over to spare.Chasing 173 set by RCB, RR had a sedate two overs in which they scored only six runs. Yashasvi Jaiswal (45 off 30b, 8x4) then got going, hitting 16 off a Yash Dayal over. Tom Kohler-Cadmore (20 off 15b; 4x4) then hit two boundaries off a Mohammed Siraj over. The introduction of Lockie Ferguson paid dividends as he castled the English opener with a slower yorker. Jaiswal was caught behind off Green in the 9th over.Samson was stumped in the next over and this brought Jurel and Parag together. The duo added 26 before the former was run out by some athletic piece of fielding by Virat Kohli. Parag and Hetmyer then added 45 in 25 balls to tilt the match in RR's favour.Earlier, RR bowlers stepped up, and aided by good catching, restricted RCB to 172/8. Opting to field, the Powerplay was a contest of two halves. If it was Australian left-arm pacer Mitchell Starc who shone with his swing bowling on Tuesday, it was the turn of New Zealand pacer Trent Boult to deliver the goods today.Boult didn't uproot the stumps like Starc, but delivered a dream opening spell (3-0-6-1). Denied scoring opportunities by Boult, Kohli and Du Plessis attacked the other bowlers. Kohli began with a flick off Sandeep Sharma, who was then belted down the ground for a six by Du Plessis.In a bid to break the shackles against Boult, the RCB captain danced down the wicket and slammed a short ball towards deep midwicket only to be spectacularly caught by a diving Rovman Powell.Kohli (33 off 24b; 3x4, 1x6) looked to target Yuzvendra Chahal in his first over. An attempt to slog sweep the leg spinner ended in the hands of substitute fielder Donovan Ferreira at deep mid-wicket.Cameron Green (27 off 21b; 2x4, 1x6) then smashed Chahal for a maximum over the leg side boundary and followed it up with a four over long off. Ashwin then dismissed Green and Maxwell off consecutive balls to peg back RCB.Rajat Patidar (34 off 22b; 2x4, 2x6) and Mahipal Lomror smashed sixes off Chahal before the former hit another maximum off Khan. Khan, though, had the last laugh, having Patidar caught at mid-off by Riyan Parag.Dinesh Karthik (11 off 12b; 1x4) survived a close LBW call off his first ball after DRS overturned an on field decision. However, he failed to inject momentum into the innings and was caught by Jaiswal at cover off Khan. Despite Mahipal Lomror's cameo (32 off 17b; 2x4, 2x6) , RCB never got the push towards the death overs and ended with 172.",RCB's six-match winning streak ended in the Eliminator.

We didn't put par scores and we lost Buttler, and Hetmyer was injured. Today's win was important. We were a bit rusty chasing it, but this win will give us some confidence. In the first half, I felt my body wasn't moving too well for the first half of the season. I had an abdomen injury as well. I am aging as well. To come into the tournament from Test cricket was difficult, I needed some time to get that bowling rhythm. But once you have committed to your franchise, you want to go through with the season.""""I think we hit the right lengths, the way Boult was bowling, he got a bit of swing and seam movement. In the second innings, I don't think there was a lot of dew. I think there were some exceptional shots from our boys to get that chase. I think our greatest strength is the exuberance of youth and the experience we have got to support that.

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals managed to halt Royal Challengers Bengaluru 's juggernaut in the Indian Premier League , securing a hard-fought four-wicket victory in the Eliminator in Ahmedabad on Wednesday.The RR bowlers produced an all-round effort, stopping RCB to 172 for 8. However, the their batters encountered difficulties during the middle overs in chase, allowing RCB to claw back in the match, which remained evenly poised for a significant portion of the second half.Despite the challenges, the inaugural IPL champions ultimately reached the target with an over to spare, finishing at 174 for 6, thanks to Rovman Powell's composed unbeaten 16, which provided the necessary impetus in a tense conclusion.As he has done several times before this season, Riyan Parag (36 off 26) showcased deep resolve in an adverse situation to help Rajasthan stay alive in the tournament. It was Royals' first win after four losses and an abandoned game.2008 winners Royals face Sunrisers Hyderabad in Chennai on Friday for a place in the IPL final.The returning Shimron Hetmyer also played his part to perfection, scoring a crucial 26 off 14 balls.In a contest wherein fortunes swung from one side to another, RR remained ahead with impactful performances throughout even though Mohammed Siraj (2/33) raised late hopes for RCB with wickets of Parag and Hetmyer in the 18th over,With 13 needed off last two overs, Powell found two fours off Lockie Ferguson to seal the deal in favour of his side.Earlier, it was Yashasvi Jaiswal (45 off 30) who gave them the impetus at the top.Off to an unconvincing start with his initial runs coming off the outside edge, Jaiswal grew in confidence when Yash Dayal fed him a few deliveries to capitalise on and the RR opener cracked four fours in the third over to break the shackles.At the other end, Tom Kohler-Cadmore (20) also hit a couple of fours against Siraj and while getting a lifeline from Glenn Maxwell, who spilled a sitter at deep square leg off Dayal.With RR's acceleration rapidly shaving runs off the target, RCB needed a breakthrough and Lockie Ferguson provided the first success when he foxed Kohler-Cadmore with a slow yorker which crashed into the stumps.The gradual progression of Jaiswal's innings saw the batter finding his rhythm, but the extreme heat sapped him out completely having faced a mere 29 balls.In between the ninth and the 10th over, Jaiswal received on-field treatment and got back up only to play a loose shot — an attempted ramp off Cameron Green but only gloved it to the ‘keeper.Soon after, Karn Sharma dealt a body blow by having Sanju Samson (17) stumped.With their tails up, RCB continued making inroads with Dhruv Jurel (8) being run out after a brilliant effort from Virat Kohli and Cameron Green.

NEW DELHI: Having played both with and against Virat Kohli for years, South African great AB de Villiers has observed firsthand how the Indian star handles criticism.In the early part of the Indian Premier League (IPL), the legendary Sunil Gavaskar was among those who questioned Kohli's approach. In response, the champion batter delivered a series of high-scoring performances at an impressive strike rate, showcasing his ability to thrive under pressure and silence his critics.""Yeah, I enjoyed that,"" he said when asked about the constant debate over Kohli's strike rate over the course of the season.""I thought it was... really bad for someone like that for a hero and a role model of the country to get so much criticism around that. But the way I know him, I just knew and that's exactly what I mentioned on my show. I said, guys, you have no idea what happens to this guy when he catches criticism.""The many years I've played against him, I used to tell the players in the team room, you do not say one word to Virat on the pitch because he will come out and he will score a big 100 if you try and chirp him.""So maybe it was a blessing in disguise, getting a bit of criticism, because stuff like that motivates him so much. And maybe someone should come out just before this game tonight and say something bad to him. I'm praying for that,"" he said ahead of the Eliminator against Rajasthan Royals.Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) have made the IPL playoffs in remarkable fashion. After securing only one win out of their first eight games, they staged a stunning comeback with six consecutive victories to clinch a play-off spot.De Villiers highlighted Kohli's crucial role in this turnaround. ""When the team is down and out, a player like Kohli can play a huge role in lifting the spirits, and that's exactly what he did,"" he said.He noted that Kohli's intensity never wavered, even during the team's losing streak, demonstrating his unwavering commitment and leadership.""It just shows the kind of care that he has for the team and the desire to ultimately go and win a trophy. And when you're down and out like that with one out of eight wins, to still see that as a teammate, from a teammate's point of view, to see that in one of your senior players who's achieved everything in cricket. I mean, he's one of the greats of all time.""And you see someone like that and celebrating on the field after we've done just one out of eight. That's got to be incredibly motivational, inspirational to say the least.""And I think he played a huge role in lifting that team and getting them back on track purely by his attitude and by his fielding prowess and the way he threw himself around on the field, the run-outs he got, the celebrations, the tapping on the shoulders of some of the young players and celebrating other people's success. That ultimately is a selfless act,"" he added.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) have made the IPL playoffs in remarkable fashion.

This left the commentary box in splits.Raina announced his retirement from international cricket alongside MS Dhoni in 2020 and retired from IPL after the 2021 season when CSK won their fourth title.

This meeting also recalled a pivotal moment in Kohli's early career during the 2008 Emerging Players Tournament in Australia.Initially left out of the playing XI by coach Pravin Amre, Kohli was recommended by Raina after seeing his potential in the nets.Kohli recounted, ""Raina saw me playing in the nets and asked Amre sir why I wasn't playing. Raina insisted I should be played, so I got a chance to open against New Zealand and scored 120 not out. This probably convinced Dilip Vengsarkar sir, the selector.

The police reportedly recovered arms, suspicious videos and text messages after searching the hideout of the four accused.The development prompted a report in a Bengali daily that the RCB cancelled their practice session after a probable threat to Virat Kohli 's security, but the GCA claimed that RCB took this step due to prevailing heatwave in the city.""There was no terror threat. We had made provision for both the Rajasthan Royals and RCB to practice at the Gujarat College ground. RCB were supposed to practice from 2 to 5pm, before they changed it to 3-6pm, as the light is good till 6.30pm in the summer in Ahmedabad. However, the Rajasthan Royals practiced from 3.30 to 6.30pm at the Gujarat College ground with their full squad.RCB skipped their practice session due to the prevailing heat wave in the city.

""There was never a presser scheduled before this match, as there was already the first qualifier (between Kolkata Knight Riders and Hyderabad Sunrisers) being played yesterday at the Narendra Modi Stadium here. In any case, it's not unusual for teams to not have practice sessions at this late stage of the tournament, as they try and remain fresh for the match after a long campaign,"" he said.Scripting a comeback for the ages, RCB have won six matches on the bounce to storm into the playoffs.
