AZAMGARH: Phoolmati, 57, and her brother Laldhar, two years her elder, hugged for the first time in 49 years on Thursday. It was a poignant moment that had improbability written all over it since the day an eight-year-old girl in pigtails who still couldn't pronounce her father's name became a memory frozen in time - as much in her own mind as her family's.All that Phoolmati could recollect since her life took a fateful turn in 1975 were two names and a landmark - Chiutidand, her native village in UP; Ramchandar, her maternal uncle; and a well in the courtyard of her grandparents' house.A man dressed as a sadhu had convinced her to accompany him to a village fair, but took her to Moradabad instead, where she was ""sold"" to a much older groom. She became a mother to a son some years after the underage marriage, lost her husband not much later, and slipped into a life of struggle and drudgery that would have remained so but for an extraordinary twist that every lost-and-found story needs.As Phoolmati's journey climaxed in a family reunion in Vedpur village of UP's Azamgarh, she poured her gratitude on the school headmistress who kickstarted the search for her antecedents and the police team that made it possible.Phoolmati, who cooks midday meals in a primary school at Pajawa in Rampur's Bilaspur, confided in Dr Pooja Rani about her early life. When the teacher searched ""Chiutidand"" on the web, she learnt that the village in Mau was earlier part of Azamgarh. She contacted Azamgarh Police and passed on the other details.Police ferried Phoolmati and her son Sompal to Vedpur to reunite her with her youngest brother Ramhit, 85.","Phoolmati, 57, and her brother Laldhar, two years her elder, hugged for the first time in 49 years on Thursday.

NFL Breaks 97-Year Tradition as Chiefs Take the Field on Christmas Day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-breaks-97-year-tradition-as-chiefs-take-the-field-on-christmas-day/articleshow/116655499.cms,"Roger Goodell’s stance on Christmas game schedule (Image via-AP Photo/Adam Hunger)

""Thanksgiving has been our biggest day of football for years. … We go where the fans are.""

""Christmas Day is Christmas Day, and it doesn’t wait around for what day it’s on. We want to be there on Christmas Day.""

""We go where the fans are. I don’t ask permission for that. We’re going to find a way to satisfy that.""

The Kansas City Chiefs are breaking an NFL tradition this Christmas

Here’s a breakdown of the Chiefs' schedule by day:

Sunday: 10 games

Monday: 2 games

Wednesday: 1 game (Christmas Day vs. Steelers)

Thursday: 1 game

Friday: 1 game

Saturday: 1 game

Patrick Mahomes’ take on playing Christmas games

""I think with the short week … you don’t even realize how close you are to Christmas other than when you go home and there are presents under the tree. … We’re all hands on deck, super focused on Pittsburgh.""

""It is really cool playing the first Netflix game on Christmas Day in front of the whole nation. … It’s an honor.""

The NFL won’t let Christmas go untouched. For five years now, the league has slotted games on the holiday, and it’s not stopping. This year? Chiefs vs. Steelers at 1 p.m. ET and Ravens vs. Texans at 4:30 p.m. ET. Both games stream on Netflix, marking the platform’s NFL debut.It’s not about tradition; it’s about ratings. Commissioner Roger Goodell said it himself on The Pat McAfee Show:Jerry Jones doubled down:NFL fans don’t get a say, but their TV habits seem to justify the league’s decisions. Last year, Christmas games averaged 30 million viewers. Well, numbers do talk.And rightfully, not everyone’s thrilled. Christmas is sacred for many—family, food, and no work. Now, players and staff are working midweek to keep the NFL’s ratings game strong. Commissioner Roger Goodell didn’t mince words about the league’s priorities earlier this year:Translation: Holidays are business. Thanksgiving works, Black Friday even, so why not Christmas?When the Kansas City Chiefs take the field on Christmas, they will become the first team in 97 years to play games on six different days of the week in a single season. This scheduling quirk arose due to games on non-traditional days like Black Friday and, now, Christmas Wednesday.The last NFL team to achieve a similar feat was the 1927 New York Yankees, who played on every day except Monday.Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes shared his thoughts on the upcoming Christmas game during a press conference:Mahomes also commented on being part of Netflix's debut NFL broadcast:After the Chiefs’ win over the Steelers, Patrick Mahomes kept true to his promise, literally and figuratively. He laughed about the whirlwind of playing a Christmas game, and when it came to family priorities, he said: “I told Brittany I’d get her the No. 1 seed for Christmas” and guess who delivered? Well, Chiefs fans couldn’t have asked for a better gift.Also Read : GOOD NEWS!

Sam Konstas on Kohli altercation: 'I was doing my gloves, he accidentally bumped me'

Odell Beckham Jr Supports Ex Teammate Lamar Jackson As MVP Race Heats Up



Unc DOUBLES DOWN on Lamar Jackson for NFL MVP after Ravens crush Texans | Nightcap

Veteran wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr ., who parted ways with the Miami Dolphins last week, took to social media to express his appreciation for his former Ravens teammate Lamar Jackson. Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson broke former four-time Pro Bowl selection Michael Vick's record for the most rushing yards all-time by a quarterback. Lamar finished the Christmas Day game with 168 yards and three combined touchdowns, leading the Ravens to a 31-2 win. His performance seemed to make a case for his third NFL MVP Award.It’s an interesting development when the MVP odds are heavily in favour of Bills QB Josh Allen. Jackson’s decent outing led Beckham Jr. to tweet, “Words don’t do justice for seeing what Lamar Jackson does in person.”In response to OBJ’s tweet, Ravens fans flooded the comments section, requesting the free agent wide receiver to return to the Ravens next year and help Lamar. “We have unfinished business with you…let’s get our get back,” a fan page wrote on X.The Baltimore Ravens released Beckham Jr. only after one season in March 2024 mainly because of financial constraints. Beckham signed a one-year, $3m deal with the Dolphins in May but started out on the reserve list as he had an after offseason knee surgery. He has nine catches for 55 yards in nine games.Also Read: Buffalo Bills QB Josh Allen Speaks Out On Right Should X-Ray Post Sunday’s Big Game And reportedly, the Dolphins and Odell parted ways because the latter is looking for a team who can give him more opportunities. However, fans were impressed by his words of praise for his former teammate and one fan even posted a highlight reel from the Ravens vs. Chargers clash featuring a terrific OBJ catch.As the playoffs draw near, the MVP race is heating up and while Allen has come across as a clear favourite, Jackson’s wipeout performance against the Houston Texans has changed the scenario. Even veteran NFL athlete and podcaster Shannon Sharpe had to address the possibilities of Jackson getting the MVP Award.During the latest episode of his podcast ‘Nightcap’, Sharpe said that it could all come down to Allen’s last game of the season. “I think it’s close Ocho,” he told his co-host Chad Johnson. “If they win tomorrow, they clinch the second seed. So, does Josh Allen play the last game of the season? Lamar is going to play. Because right now they’re first place in the AFC North. If Pittsburgh wins next week and Baltimore loses Pittsburgh rejumps them and then they’re on the road rather than at home.”Also Read : Behind the reason: Why Patrick Mahomes said ‘No’ to Netflix cake after big win","Odell Beckham Jr took to social media to express his appreciation for his former Ravens teammate Lamar Jackson.

Sam Konstas on Kohli altercation: 'I was doing my gloves, he accidentally bumped me'

Abhishek Nayar explains reason for dropping Shubman Gill, Rohit Sharma's place

NEW DELHI: Star Indian batter Virat Kohli on Thursday avoided a ban following his physical on-field altercation with Australian debutant Sam Konstas during the opening day of the fourth Test in Melbourne.The incident took place at the end of the 10th over when Kohli bumped shoulder with Konstas at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). The collision quickly escalated into a heated exchange between the two players. Australian opener Usman Khawaja and umpire Michael Gough intervened, stepping in to mediate and diffuse the situation.The International Cricket Council (ICC), subsequently, fined Kohli 20 percent of his match fee and awarded one demerit point for breaching Level 1 of the ICC Code of Conduct .""The Article 2.12 of the ICC Code of Conduct relates to inappropriate physical contact with a player, player support personnel, umpire, match referee or any other person (including a spectator during an international match,"" the ICC said in a statement.""No formal hearing was needed as Kohli accepted the sanctions proposed by match referee Andy Pycroft ,"" it added.Despite Kohli escaping a ban, the ICC’s decision has sparked widespread debate, particularly among former Australian cricketers and fans. Many have voiced their displeasure, arguing that the physical altercation warranted stricter action to maintain discipline on the field.The growing clamour suggests that a significant section of the cricketing community believes Kohli’s actions crossed a line, with calls for consistency in enforcing the ICC’s Code of Conduct.The incident has reignited discussions about the treatment of high-profile players and the need for impartiality in disciplinary verdicts.To understand why Kohli was not suspended following his altercation with Konstas, it is essential to examine Article 2.12 of the ICC Code of Conduct. This provision deals with “inappropriate physical contact with a player,” categorising such offences as Level 1 or Level 2 breaches depending on the intent and severity.A breach of Article 2.12, can be differentiated into four levels of offence and the following factors are taken into account when assessing the seriousness of the breach: ""(i) the context of the particular situation, including, without limitation, whether the contact was deliberate (i.e. intentional), reckless, negligent, and/or avoidable; (ii) the force of the contact; (iii) any resulting injury to the person with whom contact was made; and (iv) the person with whom contact was made.""According to ICC Code of Conduct, when a player reaches four or more demerit points within a 24-month period, they are converted into suspension points and a player is banned but in case of Kohli this is the first demerit point that he has logged since 2019.Had Kohli made physical contact with an umpire or match referee, it would have been classified as a Level 3 or 4 offence under the ICC Code of Conduct, warranting much harsher penalties, including a possible ban.However, since the altercation involved Australian debutant Konstas and lacked any indication of deliberate aggression, Kohli’s actions were considered a Level 1 or 2 offence and that is why he escaped a stricter punishment. Hence, he received just one demerit point.Konstas, who enjoyed a stellar Test debut with a flamboyant knock of 60 off 65 balls, including six fours and two sixes, addressed the incident during the post-day press conference. The 19-year-old downplayed its significance, saying, ""I was just doing my gloves, and I think he accidentally bumped me.""""I think that is just cricket, just the tension. For me, it's about having that freedom, backing myself, and trying to bring out the best version of me. I was lucky enough to get a few runs today,"" he added.",Virat Kohli fined 20 percent of his match fee and awarded one demerit point.

“Absolutely ridiculous”: Keanu Reeves provided a humorous response to the rumor that the Ravens offered him a chance at quarterback,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/absolutely-ridiculous-keanu-reeves-provided-a-humorous-response-to-the-rumor-that-the-ravens-offered-him-a-chance-at-quarterback/articleshow/116522105.cms,"Keanu Reeves's portrayal of quarterback Shane Falco in ""The Replacements"" sparked a rumor about a Baltimore Ravens tryout. Reeves denied the rumor in an interview, though acknowledged the fun speculation. The film, loosely inspired by the 1987 NFL strike, achieved moderate box office success.

Keanu Reeves was once approached to try out for quarterback by the Baltimore Ravens

Keanu Reeves & Idris Elba Talk Shane Falco, Michael Jordan Movie & Auto Racing

A popular rumor suggests that Keanu Reeves became so good as a quarterback during the movie ""The Replacements"" that he got invited to try out for the Baltimore Ravens. It is indeed well-known that the internet can mix truth and gossip or fiction with claims like this. Most blended with this idea of Reeves trying out for an NFL team fit well with his reputation for hard work and intense preparation for his film roles.The Replacements is a 2000 sports comedy film directed by Howard Deutch and starring Keanu Reeves, Gene Hackman, Orlando Jones, Brooke Langton, Rhys Ifans, Jon Favreau, and Jack Warden in his last film appearance before his death in 2006. Reeves played Shane Falco #16 (QB) — A left-handed former All-America quarterback for Ohio State who fell off the grid after choking in the 1996 Sugar Bowl and washing out of the pros after one season, giving him a derogatory nickname of ""Footsteps"", because of his impulse to scramble prematurely when he thinks a sack is coming.Keanu Reeves' role in The Replacements, playing Shane Falco in 2000, was among the most defining moments of his illustrious career as an actor. In the film, Reeves was the quarterback for the Washington Sentinels, signed after a strike, as Falco is the quarterback needed by coach Jimmy McGinty, which played by Gene Hackman.In an interview with Sports Illustrated, Reeves together with Idris Elba discussed their upcoming movie, Sonic the Hedgehog 3, and talked about the rumors of an NFL try-out with the Baltimore Ravens after playing Falco in The Replacements. ""That's absolutely ridiculous,"" Reeves said with a huge smile. ""I got OK, but that is ridiculous. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yeah, I was out there, 'Blue 87!' [throwing] 50-yard outs no problem,"" he added laughing.The Baltimore Ravens, led by Brian Billick at that time, won Super Bowl XXXV less than six months after ""The Replacements"" premiered. While some sources suggest Billick might have expressed interest in Reeves, no official records or statements confirm that the Ravens extended a tryout invitation. Reeves' reputation for intense preparation in film roles and his portrayal of Shane Falco as a comeback-story quarterback make the rumor of him trying out for an NFL team plausible.Also Read: Will Taylor Swift attend the Chiefs-Texans game to cheer for Travis Kelce? Fans wonder if it's her final regular season appearance The Replacements was inspired very loosely by the 1987 NFL strike; in its story, one team-the won-out Washington Redskins-won three replacement games while all of its regular players were lost and then went on to win Super Bowl XXII after that. The story may center on replacement players, but the Falco–Martel quarterback controversy is reminiscent of the post-strike Washington controversy involving Doug Williams and Jay Schroeder.Squeezed in as the third position on the box office chart, the movie made $11,039,214 within its opening weekend in North American box office standings, following Space Cowboys and Hollow Man - which both made their way to this spot for the second consecutive week. By the end, it grossed about $44.7 million in domestic figures and about $5.3 million internationally, at more than $50 million worldwide.Although there is no official record, there are indications that Keanu Reeves was indeed offered the chance to play on the Ravens. However, Shane Falco was praised by Brian Billick, who at that time was the quarterback of the Baltimore Ravens. The team won Super Bowl XXXV six months after the movie had been released.Besides acting, Reeves is a member of the musical band Dogstar, and their albums include Somewhere Between the Power Lines and Palm Trees (2023). Reeves is the creator of the BRZRKR franchise that started as a comic book and later expanded to the spin-offs like The Book of Elsewhere. Reeves is also co-founder of the custom manufacturer ARCH Motorcycle and the production company Company Films and an avid motorcyclist.","Keanu Reeves' portrayal of quarterback Shane Falco in ""The Replacements"" sparked a rumor about a Baltimore Ravens tryout.

Brittany’s four words said it all

Chiefs kingdom gets their win, and so does Brittany

Patrick Mahomes did way more than just clinch the #1 seed for the Kansas City Chiefs—he kept a promise. A promise not to his fans, teammates, or coaches, but to Brittany Mahomes , his pregnant wife, who’s expecting their third child any day now. This wasn’t just another win for the Chiefs; it was personal.“I told my pregnant wife I was gonna get her that No. 1 seed so we can go have that baby,” Mahomes said after securing a dominant 29-10 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. His performance? Peak Mahomes—320 yards, three touchdowns, and zero excuses. The Chiefs locked the AFC’s top spot and earned the playoff bye. That means rest, recovery, and maybe—just maybe—Patrick will be home for the birth of baby #3.After the game, Brittany took to Instagram to celebrate. She shared a story of Patrick and teammate Travis Kelce enjoying a Christmas cake post-win, captioned with just four words: “What a Great Christmas!!!” Emojis included, of course.Brittany’s excitement wasn’t just about the win. It was about a promise kept. In a repost of Patrick’s post-game comments, she wrote: “Always keeping his promises” with a white heart emoji. For the Mahomes family, football is life, but family?

Raymond's Return on the Horizon



Reeves-Maybin Hopes For Possible Return To Action



Anzalone Near Return, Still Unlikely to Play This Week



The Road to Recovery and Playoff Success



The Detroit Lions are waiting for the return of key players as they prepare for a crucial Monday Night Football showdown against the San Francisco 49ers. Coach Dan Campbell addressed the media on Thursday saying ""It's too early to say (who will return from injury this week),"" Campbell said. ""We're going to start Kalif's clock, I guess you guys saw that. So, he'll start practicing, and we'll see where he's at.The Lions are really bringing it with wide receiver Kalif Raymond, who can make dynamic plays on offense and does a great job as a return specialist. He hasn't played since Week 12 due to a foot injury, but the team has officially put him on injured reserve/designated to return, so he is one step closer to playing again.While probably unlikely that Raymond will be ready to play this week against the 49ers, his return to practice is a big point in his recovery. When healthy, Raymond was always a key contributor to Lions' offensive success, big play after big play making a difference in their return game. His explosiveness in returning punts-an attribute that he displayed even prior to his injury, since he averaged 14.4 yards per return-a trait that will add plenty of excitement to the Lions' special teams unit, too.Defensive specialist Jalen Reeves-Maybin is another critical player missing in action, as a neck injury has kept him out. However, the Lions designated him to return from injured reserve, so there's hope that he might be available for this game against the 49ers.Reeves-Maybin would be just in time back to the Lions, who have been extensively derailed by a myriad of injuries on their linebacking corps. A return from him would contribute immensely as an important plus for boosting the Lions defensive line, and it helps solidify their running-stopping skills and the possible blowing up of opposing offense.""I don't feel as confident with (Raymond) as I do (Reeves-Maybin), but it's be good to have him back out practicing. It will be good to get him back out there running around.""Another key player who is nearing a return to the field is linebacker Alex Anzalone, out with a broken forearm. He is progressing in recovery but seems unlikely to return for this week's game.Anzalone's return would strengthen the linebacker corps for the Lions further and give depth and experience to the defensive unit. His contribution both in run defense and pass coverage will greatly enhance the overall performance of the team's defense.The Lions have experienced numerous setbacks throughout the season, with many key players injured. However, the team has shown incredible strength and a will to push through adversity.The potential returns of Raymond, Reeves-Maybin, and Anzalone are big steps in the right direction for recovery by the team. This is because they bring an immense amount of experience, talent, and leadership into the field, and their presence will be important as far as the Lions try to meet their playoff goals.With these key players returning for the Lions as they gear up for the critical stretch run of the season, their confidence will surely go up, and they are bound to make a much deeper run in the playoffs.Also read - Rachel Bush, Jordan Poyer's wife, reveals Poyer family’s first Christmas in Florida","The Detroit Lions are waiting for the return of key players as they prepare for a crucial Monday Night Football showdown against the San Francisco 49ers.

Sam Konstas on Kohli altercation: 'I was doing my gloves, he accidentally bumped me'

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistani cricketer Basit Ali has opened up on the fresh debate, the recent altercation between Virat Kohli and Australian debutant Sam Konstas during the fourth Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on Thursday.The incident occurred when Kohli, seemingly frustrated, collided shoulders with Konstas after the latter’s fiery start with the bat.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Basit expressed his disappointment, saying, “It’s really disheartening to see this controversy. I’ve engaged in sledging as well, but only verbally and in a mannered way. However, what Virat Kohli did today is hard to believe. If someone asks me for my opinion, I’d say a thousand times over that Virat Kohli is guilty.""""Take Sachin Tendulkar as an example—we sledged against him so much, but he never responded like this; he always answered with his bat. It’s not even been a year since Virat’s son was born. Imagine when his son is 12 or 13 years old, walking somewhere, and someone pushes him in the same way—how would Virat Kohli feel? Virat intentionally collided today, and it was not accidental,” he added.The altercation has led to widespread debates about discipline in cricket, with the International Cricket Council (ICC) penalising Kohli with a 20% match fee fine and awarding him a single demerit point under Article 2.12 of theICC Code of Conduct , which pertains to inappropriate physical contact. Kohli accepted the sanction without protest, avoiding a formal hearing and potential suspension.Several Australian cricket experts have expressed dissatisfaction with the ICC’s decision, calling it too lenient given the physical nature of the altercation.Some argue that high-profile players receive undue leniency, reigniting conversations about consistency in enforcing rules.For Kohli, this is his first demerit point since 2019, sparing him a suspension. However, with stricter enforcement, future incidents could attract harsher penalties.",Former Pakistani cricketer Basit Ali has opened up on the recent altercation between Virat Kohli and Australian debutant Sam Konstas.

NEW DELHI: Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting has expressed disappointment over the 20 percent match fee fine imposed on Indian batting star Virat Kohli for his altercation with debutant Sam Konstas , arguing that the punishment handed down by the ICC ""is not harsh enough.""Konstas’ debut was a memorable affair, as the 19-year-old not only impressed with a fearless 60-run knock, including 34 runs off Indian pace ace Jasprit Bumrah, but also found himself at the center of controversy involving Kohli.During a tense moment, Kohli shoulder-bumped Konstas in a direct physical contact, for which the ICC fined him 20 percent of his match fee and added one demerit point to his disciplinary record.Speaking on 7 Cricket ahead of day two of the match, Ponting said: ""Personally, I do not think it [the punishment] was harsh enough. I know there are precedents [where similar infringements have incurred similar-sized penalties] - they have generally been between a 15 and 25 per cent fine but let us have a think about the enormity of yesterday.""Ponting also emphasised the broader implications of such incidents.""It is probably the most-watched day of cricket all year all around the world. Imagine if that happens in a grade game on the weekend now, what is going to happen there? I think people are going to think that that is almost acceptable now.""He further highlighted the responsibilities of senior players like Kohli and said: ""And unfortunately for someone like Virat, as we got told as players and as senior players, sometimes it is [the scale of punishment] just different for some people. He is a role model, he is somebody the cricketing world looks up to, so I personally do not think that the fine was harsh enough.""","Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting has expressed disappointment over the 20 percent match fee fine imposed on Indian batting star Virat Kohli.

Sam Konstas on Kohli altercation: 'I was doing my gloves, he accidentally bumped me'

NEW DELHI: Australia's star batter Steve Smith created history on Friday, becoming the most successful century-maker against India in Test cricket . Smith achieved the milestone with his 11th century against India during the second day of the fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).Smith surpassed England's Joe Root, who has 10 centuries against India, for the record. Smith's 11 tons have come in just 43 innings, while Root required 55 innings to reach his tally.The Australian batter scored a magnificent 140 off 197 balls, an innings studded with three sixes and 13 fours, propelling the hosts beyond the 450-run mark. It marked Smith's second century of the series, following a gritty 101 in the third Test in Brisbane, which was his first ton in 25 innings since June 2023.Smith's overall Test record now boasts 34 centuries, the second-highest for an Australian behind Ricky Ponting 's 41. He has joined an elite group of players, including Sunil Gavaskar , Brian Lara, Younis Khan , and Mahela Jayawardene, all of whom also have 34 Test centuries. Smith is now tied for seventh place on the all-time list of century-makers, which is led by India's Sachin Tendulkar with 51 hundreds.Smith reached his milestone at the MCG with a boundary offNitish Reddy during the morning session. He was eventually dismissed by Akash Deep for 140, falling to an inside edge that dragged onto his stumps.In his 113-Test career, Smith has amassed 9,949 runs at an exceptional average of 56.85, complemented by 34 centuries and 41 half-centuries. As he edges closer to the 10,000-run mark, Smith continues to solidify his status as one of the greatest Test cricketers of his generation.","Steve Smith becomes most successful century-maker against India in Test cricket.

Kohli-Konstas episode

NEW DELHI: When 19-year-old Sam Konstas took strike against Jasprit Bumrah on the opening day of the fourth Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground , the debutant was caught on camera muttering words to himself as the bowler steamed in. This habit persisted against every bowler, be it Bumrah or Mohammed Siraj, drawing curiosity from fans and commentators alike.In a video posted by Channel 7, Konstas explained his unique self-talk during an interview at the end of the day’s play.Australia’s decision to field Konstas for the final two matches of the Border-Gavaskar series proved to be a tactical masterstroke. The fearless teenager overcame a few early jitters to play a scintillating knock of 60 off 65 balls on debut.Konstas didn’t shy away from taking on India’s star bowler, Jasprit Bumrah, unleashing a mix of innovative scoops, daring pulls, and unpolished slogs. His counterattacking approach rattled the Indian bowling attack, setting the stage for Australia’s strong start.Although his innings ended when Ravindra Jadeja trapped him lbw after the second drinks break, Konstas walked off to a standing ovation. His 52-ball half-century became the third fastest by an Australian debutant.The opening session wasn’t without controversy. During a break in play, Virat Kohli shoulder-bumped Konstas as the youngster walked to confer with Usman Khawaja. The incident, which drew boos from the Melbourne crowd, forced umpire Michael Gough to step in and mediate.Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting , commentating for Seven Network, called Kohli the instigator. The International Cricket Council has yet to confirm whether disciplinary action will follow, but physical contact during a match can carry severe penalties.Konstas’ eventful debut, highlighted by his explosive batting and the on-field clash with Kohli, left an indelible mark on day one.

Sam Konstas on Kohli altercation: 'I was doing my gloves, he accidentally bumped me'

'INDIA RATTLED'

'KOHLI WILL REGRET IT'

NEW DELHI: The dramatic scenes on Boxing Day at the Melbourne Cricket Ground were like watching a Bollywood thriller bringing viewers to the edge of their seats in anticipation of another electrifying moment. Sam Konstas 's fiery debut put Bumrah through the unfamiliar -- being hit for six with the red ball, before the show-stealing 'action sequence' involving Virat Kohli and the Australian teenager.The 19-year old opening batter Konstas, brought into the side by Australia on the back of his century against the visitors in a warm-up game and following the failure of Nathan McSweeney, got under the skin of the Indian team with an attacking knock.It rattled India and led to unwarranted scenes of Kohli shoulder-barging Konstas, which match referee Andy Pycroft viewed as a breach of the ICC Code of Conduct for ""inappropriate physical contact"". As a result, Kohli was fined and handed one demerit point for a Level 1 offence.Analysing the incident, former England spinner Monty Panesar feels that suspending Kohli for a first such offence would have been harsh, but if the Indian legend misbehaves again, he should be suspended.""The fact is that this youngster rattled India,"" said Panesar talking to Timesofindia.com from London. ""It's as simple as that. He threw punches at them, played a few shots, and they didn't like it.""""He played his reverse scoop shots and hit Jasprit Bumrah for a six over third-man, which, I think, hurt India's ego. Then Kohli doing that, he obviously instigated it.""Kohli is known to not take a backward step when it comes to expressing himself on the field and giving it back to the opposition. But Monty feels the batting icon took it a little bit too far on Thursday against a player who is 17 years younger to him.""He's a 19-year-old kid! It was unnecessary for him (Kohli) to do it. A lot of people obviously know the answer to that, but then I suppose that's the nature he plays his cricket. He is aggressive, he's intense. If he doesn't like how the other team approaches, when they throw a punch back, that's his way to react,"" said Panesar, who played 50 Tests for England and took 167 wickets.""But he (Konstas) didn't care less. He thought 'I am going to keep going with it'...If you go after the top bowlers, they don't like it, and it was good to see the youngster choosing to stand up against a player of the stature of Virat Kohli.""Konstas scored 60 off 65 balls before being dismissed lbw by Ravindra Jadeja. He added 89 runs with Usman Khawaja (57), which is Australia's best opening stand of this Border Gavaskar Trophy. The five-Test series currently stands at 1-1.Monty feels Kohli will regret his actions looking back at the day's play, but if he repeats such unwarranted behaviour again, he should be handed a suspension.""He'll probably regret it now, looking back at it when he's a little bit cooler, looking back and thinking 'well, he's a guy who is 19 and I am one of the biggest superstars in cricket, and I am shoulder-barging him. Why did I have to do that?'"" Monty said.""I suppose for him to be suspended for behaviour like that is probably a little bit harsh. He obviously deliberately shoulder-barged Konstas, and he didn't need to do it,"" the 42-year-old former left-arm spinner said. ""If he does it again, and he misbehaves in the second innings, they (India) go after him (Konstas), then yeah, obviously give him a suspension because first time is a warning, second time suspension.""...You won't see Cristiano Ronaldo do anything like that; you won't see some of the other big superstars, when there's a youngster making his debut, do that. But good on him (Konstas), good to stand up because they were trying to intimidate him, trying to bully him by Virat Kohli barging him (so that) he goes into his shell or gets out. But he didn't. He took them on. Hit them out of the ground, hit them everywhere. That's what you want to do,"" Monty added.Panesar, who had Sachin Tendulkar as his first Test wicket, concluded by saying that Konstas took the right approach in his first international knock by fighting fire with fire, which is the way to tackle the ""aggressive"" Indian team.""You've got to respond like that to this Indian team because they are very intense, very aggressive; and if they come hard at you, you've got to come back harder as well. You can't sit down, and it's good to see that the 19-year-old stood up,"" said the Indian-origin player, who has roots in Punjab.India ended the first day of the Melbourne Test on a better note after Australia's top four scored a half-century each following the home team's decision to bat first.From 240 for 3, Australia stuttered their way to 311 for 6 at close of play, with Steven Smith batting on 68 and skipper Pat Cummins on 8.Bumrah was once again the pick of the Indian bowlers with his figures of 3 for 75.

ROHIT'S POOR RUN

INDIA, ROHIT RATTLED

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma is undoubtedly going through a tough twilight period of his cricket career both as a captain as well as a batter. He will look to resurrect it by possibly returning to his customary position as an opener in the ongoing Melbourne Test in hope of runs that help him regain confidence and poise as a leader.With India's No. 3 Shubman Gill dropped from the eleven for an extra spin-bowling all-rounder in the form of Washington Sundar, KL Rahul will in all probability play the role of one-down batter, allowing Rohit to open again in Melbourne, and in the last Test at Sydney. Those four possible innings, believes former England spinner Monty Panesar , will be make-or-break knocks for the Indian captain's Test career.""I think that (to open batting again) is the only option for Rohit,"" said Panesar, talking to Timesofindia.com from London. ""To be honest, he's got four innings to save his Test career. If he doesn't perform that well, I think he will probably retire as well.""If that happens, it will be the second high-profile retirement of the series, with off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin hanging his boots after the third Test in Brisbane, quitting international cricket with immediate effect.If India fail to qualify for the World Test Championship final, their next Test assignment will be the five-Test tour of England in June-July 2025. For Rohit to play that, if he wants to, Panesar believes he will have to fire in Melbourne and Sydney.""...With the five Test matches in England, I think Rohit should probably take the ownership and say 'right, you know, (in) overseas Test matches I have got to perform like I do...be aggressive, take it on',"" said Panesar.""If he does that, I think he will probably carry on as captain. But if he fails, I think he will be the first one to stand up and say, 'guys, I think I am done, and you have got to move on with the new team'. Especially with five Test matches in England, you have got to build a new side.""The five-Test Border Gavaskar Trophy stands at 1-1 after three Tests, which means a win in Melbourne will ensure that India won't lose the series and thus remain the title-holders. But Australia have done well to reach 311 for 6 at stumps on day one.If India can take the last four wickets quickly to wrap up the Australian first innings for under 350 and then the visitors' top order bats well, it will be game on.""It's a big, big innings for him (Rohit) in Melbourne...I think especially that first innings is a big one for him. He's got to show good intent and start well because Australia are going to come out not holding back now,"" said the 42-year-old former left-arm spinner, who played 50 Tests for England.After a dramatic first day, where Virat Kohli shoulder-barging 19-year-old debutant opener Sam Konstas grabbed the headlines, Panesar believes Indian batters will have to deal with a hostile Australian team now.Kohli has been fined by the match referee for ""inappropriate physical contact"" and also handed one demerit point for the Level 1 offence in the ICC Code of Conduct.""They (Australian bowlers) are going to come out at Virat, going to make him very uncomfortable, probably the top six as well, (saying) 'how do you just shoulder-barge a 19-year-old like that?'... I think it's going to be hostile when they come out to bat,"" said Panesar, who is of Indian origin, with his family's roots in Punjab.He added that it will make Rohit's challenge a stiff one against the charged-up Aussie pacers Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Scott Boland.""You have got to be ready for it, and ready for counter-punching and playing aggressive cricket, which I am sure Rohit Sharma can do. But if it was in India, he would have been more confident. He is just not sure if he has the same impact in away Test matches,"" Panesar reckoned.Rohit, who missed the first Test in Perth while on paternity leave after the birth of his child, has been going through a rough phase in red-ball cricket. His bat has been silent for three consecutive series now, starting with two Tests against Bangladesh and three against New Zealand at home.He aggregated 42 runs in four innings against Bangladesh and 91 in six innings against the Kiwis. It had an impact on his captaincy as well, with India suffering an embarrassing 0-3 whitewash against New Zealand. Batting at No. 6 in three innings of this BGT so far, Rohit's knocks read 3, 6 and 10.Getting runs under his belt, thus, is imperative for the Indian skipper, according to Panesar.""If he (Rohit) comes round the corner and does well, scores a hundred, I think he answers all his critics; and I am sure he will carry on. But if it doesn't go too well for him...if he knows he is past his best, he will just say 'guys, last Test match in Sydney I am retiring, and that will be it.""Rohit, too, was part of a confrontational incident on the first day of play in Melbourne where he was seen having a word with Marnus Labuschagne, after he saw the Australian batter repeatedly running down the middle of the track.Panesar believes such incidents were largely because India got rattled by the aggressive approach debutant Konstas took in scoring 60 off 65, especially when he played audacious ramp shots against the best bowler of the series, Bumrah.""I think India have been rattled, let's be honest. They thought Konstas probably would have got out and it would have been a much better day for them, and (they) would have bowled Australia out for 300,"" said Panesar.""If they were on top, they would have probably not bothered (about things like Labuschagne running on the pitch). I think it's just more the fact...that a young 19-year-old, who has played 11 Sheffield Shield games, is reverse-sweeping (ramp shot) Bumrah over third-man for six. That is showing complete disrespect to Bumrah and this Indian team.""Panesar believes that it was the audacity of a teenager more than anything else that put India off, which also rattled batting legend Kohli to the point that he shoulder-barged a teenage debutant 17 years younger to him.""Virat is left thinking 'he doesn't feel intimidated by me.' This 19-year-old doesn't feel intimidated by this Indian team. That is what's hurting the ego of this Indian team right now,"" he added.""The real hurt is that a 19-year-old whacks Bumrah over third-man for six. That was pinching them.""",Rohit Sharma could open for India in Melbourne Test against Australia. Former England spinner Monty Panesar says Sharma has four innings to save his Test career.

The plethora of T20 stars that the International League T20 ( ILT20 ) attracts ensures cricket is of a high standard. With the league offering the biggest payday outside of the Indian Premier League (IPL), it is an attractive proposition for players over the world.Here, we take a look back at the inaugural edition in 2023, with three players in particular focus because their performances might have not got the credit they deserve.Their bare numbers look good. But when seen in context, they are even better.Sri Lankan spinner Wanindu Hasaranga played nine games in the ILT20 2023 for Desert Vipers . He batted only five times, and took 15 wickets in his team’s run to the final, bowling his full quota of overs in most games. While batting, he scored 115 runs at a good strike rate of 145.57. His economy rate while bowling was 7.2, which potrays fairly handy figures, but perhaps not immediately eye-grabbing.Once you dive deeper though, Hasaranga’s value becomes apparent. For instance, of the 15 wickets he took, 14 were of batters in the top seven. The only one outside the top seven was when he snared Sunil Narine who was at No.8 – hardly a cheap wicket. Hasaranga’s strikes gave the Vipers decisive control when they were bowling, because he stopped good batters in their tracks. The difference between getting batters before they tee off versus getting them in the death overs is large.Hasaranga’s batting wasn’t as impactful throughout the tournament, but he saved his best for the final, smashing 55 from 27 balls to lift a floundering score to 146 for 8. The Vipers eventually didn’t have enough to stop Gulf Giants from winning, but Hasaranga took 1 for 28 in his full quota of overs too, making the Giants really sweat for their win. Hasaranga’s team may have lost, but there was no player who came close to matching him for all-round impact, and he was the clear Man of the Tournament.Among batters, Kieron Pollard was third on the run charts with 394 runs, but those came at a blistering strike rate of 192.2. Alex Hales (469) and James Vince (439) got more runs than Pollard, but they opened the batting and had more time to build bigger innings while Pollard batted almost exclusively at No.5. Plus, they did it at much lower speeds.Pollard batted nine times, and thestrike rate he had was 134.8. In seven of the nine innings, he was striking at over 160. He wasn’t dismissed in single digits at all. That was the kind of scorching form he was in. He truly led MI Emirates from the front and was perhaps the most important reason they qualified for the playoffs, eventually finishing third.Even in the second qualifier that they lost to eventual champions Gulf Giants, Pollard smashed 57 not out from 35 balls, lifting a struggling innings to a competitive score of 167 for 5.The bowler who made an impact that might not register immediately was Adam Zampa . This was largely due to the fact that Zampa played only four games for Dubai Capitals .But in those four games, he bagged nine wickets and his economy rate was an astounding 4.75. He bowled his entire quota of four overs in each game, and although the Capitals lost two of those games and won two, Zampa did everything expected of a star recruit and more.Every single one of his wickets was of a batter in the top six, and the most runs he conceded was 24. He went at less than a run-a-ball in each of his other outings. The fact that he was not available when the Capitals faced off against MI Emirates in the Eliminator doubtless played a part in their eventual defeat.","The International League T20 ( ILT20 ) attracts a plethora of T20 stars.

Former Australian batter and coach Justin Langer discussed a conversation with KL Rahul regarding Sam Konstas 's aggressive batting against India on the first day of the Boxing Day Test .Konstas replaced Nathan McSweeney in the Australian squad for the fourth Test due to McSweeney's poor run of form.Australian selectors chose Konstas to debut at the MCG against India's bowling attack.Konstas's selection followed a strong performance in the unofficial Test against India A, where he displayed a range of unconventional shots.Langer recounted his pre-match conversation with Rahul about Konstas. Rahul had doubted Konstas's ability to replicate his aggressive style in the Test match.""He's only played 11 first-class games, but I did speak to KL Rahul before the game. I asked him, 'Have you seen this kid, Sam Konstas?' And he said, 'Oh, we only saw him in the Prime Minister's XI game (50 overs). He was playing these ramp shots and all this sort of stuff.' Rahul said, 'But he won't do that today.' I said, 'Yeah, sure, he won't do that today.' And straight away, Sam Konstas was doing that,"" Langer said on Star Sports.Konstas quickly proved Rahul wrong, hitting a ramp shot off Jasprit Bumrah for four. His confident and aggressive batting propelled Australia to a strong position.Konstas's innings of 60 off 65 balls helped Australia reach 311/6 at the end of the day's play, impressing spectators and former cricketers alike.""He's been given a licence to go and attack Bumrah, but that's not easy--that is so hard to do. Even in T20 cricket, I think Bumrah's economy rate is as good as anyone's. So it's not easy to do that. But the kid was bold, talking a good game, and then he came and put it into action. That's what great players do. Anyone can talk a good game. He came and put it into action, and it was exciting to watch,"" he added.","Former Australian batter and coach Justin Langer discussed a conversation with KL Rahul regarding Sam Konstas's aggressive batting against India on the first day of the Boxing Day Test.

Tottenham Hotspur manager, Ange Postecoglou , anticipates squad reinforcements during the upcoming January transfer window. The team has recently faced challenges with injuries and suspensions, impacting their performance in the Premier League Despite these setbacks, Postecoglou remains committed to his attacking style of play. This approach has contributed to both thrilling victories and disappointing losses in recent matches.Last week's League Cup quarter-final win against Manchester United , ending 4-3, highlighted the team's attacking prowess. However, this was followed by a heavy 6-3 defeat against Liverpool in the league.Postecoglou confirmed his intention to strengthen the squad in January, ahead of the Boxing Day fixture against Nottingham Forest.""Like I said a while ago, we've been planning,"" he told a pre-match press conference.""A lot of it was going to be around where we're at around this time. Fair to say we're still a little bit short in a couple of areas and we need to reinforce.""Tottenham's continued involvement in multiple competitions necessitates squad depth. Postecoglou pointed out the demands of the Carabao Cup, European competition, and the FA Cup.""I think the fact that, obviously, we're still in the Carabao (League) Cup semi-final, still got Europe, FA Cup, we're in all the competitions, it's not like our schedule's going to ease up at any stage.""""So, I think it makes sense. We will try and reinforce.

He acknowledged the effort required to implement his demanding playing style.""I can't be critical of this group of players at the moment in any sense,"" he said.""I think it would be unfair for anyone to because what they're doing is they're giving absolute maximum effort.""That's backed up by the physical parameters you put against what they're doing.

They've lost only twice in their last 12 matches after a difficult start to the season.Manchester City, accustomed to success, has experienced a dip in form. The four-time consecutive Premier League winners have lost nine of their last 12 games leading into the Boxing Day match against Everton.""They (City) have enjoyed so much success under Pep (Guardiola) over the years that everybody seems to be under this impression that it's when, not if, it turns back,"" said Dyche.Dyche acknowledges City's dominance under Pep Guardiola and the expectation of their eventual return to form. He also recognizes the rarity of such a challenging period for a manager like Guardiola.""I don't know all of Pep's history, but I think it's unlikely he's had too many spells like this.""Dyche acknowledges Guardiola’s exceptional track record, labelling him ""arguably one of the best ever."" The Everton manager views City's current struggles as a testament to the Premier League's competitiveness.""You'd think at some point it happens, even to the best, and he is arguably one of the best ever, but for him to have a testing period actually shows how tough the game is even for the top sides.""Dyche points out that even the best teams are susceptible to difficulties if they don't maintain attention to detail. He emphasizes that Everton are also working on improving their performance.""The details, even for the top teams, if you don't get them right, then things don't work out for you. They'll be trying to correct that.""Everton, while improving, still aims to increase their win count and goal tally. Dyche stresses the importance of a strong performance against City. He dismisses the notion of an easy win simply due to City's current form.""We're in the process of correcting somewhat what we were doing. We still need to win more games, obviously, and score more goals.""Dyche emphasizes the need for a determined and robust performance from his side. He acknowledges the quality of City’s players and manager despite their recent struggles.""It's not like you go there and think, 'We're going to win just because'. We've got to go and deliver a performance. We've got to play hard, we've got to play strong.""Dyche dismisses the idea that City’s players have suddenly become less skilled or that Guardiola's managerial abilities have diminished.""They haven't all become terrible players overnight.
