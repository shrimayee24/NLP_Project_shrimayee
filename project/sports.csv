Newly crowned chess world champion D Gukesh responded to critiques regarding the quality of his World Chess Championship match against Ding Liren .He emphasised that victory in high-stakes matches isn't solely determined by gameplay. He believes willpower and character are equally crucial, qualities he feels he amply demonstrated.At 18, Gukesh defeated Liren in the 14-game world championship match, scoring 7.5-6.5. This victory makes him the youngest world champion in chess history.Former world champions Magnus Carlsen and Vladimir Kramnik expressed their disappointment with the quality of play displayed during the championship match, which concluded on Thursday.Carlsen remarked that the match resembled ""a second round or third round match of an open tournament.""Kramnik's assessment was even more critical, stating that the match represented the ""end of chess as we know it.""Asked if he was hurt by Carlsen's comments, Gukesh told BBC World, ""Not really"".Gukesh acknowledged the validity of some of the criticisms regarding the quality of play. However, he underscored the importance of non-chess factors in determining the outcome of a world championship match.""I get that maybe in some of the games, the quality was not high but I think the world championship matches are decided not purely by chess but by who has the better character and who has the better willpower. And I think those qualities, I did show quite well.""While acknowledging the pressure of the world championship, Gukesh admitted he aspired to a higher level of play. He recognised the unique demands of such a high-profile competition.""And the pure chess part, it was not at a very high level as I would have liked it to be because it's a new experience for me. So the workload was different, the pressure was different.""It's understandable that I was a bit off but I managed to strike at the critical moments, which I am happy about,"" said Gukesh.Ding Liren's critical error, which ultimately cost him the championship title, also drew criticism.FIDE president Arkady Dvorkovich offered a different perspective on the error. He suggested that such mistakes add to the excitement of the sport.Indian chess legend Viswanathan Anand offered his congratulations to Gukesh. He advised the young champion to disregard the criticism.""I feel very happy. I was literally watching history being made yesterday. It (criticism) comes with every match. To be honest, I think it just comes with the territory. You ignore it and that's all,"" said Anand.",D Gukesh is the youngest chess world champion in history. The 18-year-old defeated Ding Liren in the 14-game world championship match. Former world champions Magnus Carlsen and Vladimir Kramnik expressed their disappointment with the quality of play displayed during the match.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116295294,imgsize-204360,width-400,resizemode-4/116295294.jpg"

NFL Playoffs: A Complete Guide to the Road to the Super Bowl



How Do Teams Earn a Spot in the Playoffs?

A Breakdown of the

NFL Playoff Format

Who Plays In The Super Bowl?

The Countdown to Super Bowl 59

Now with beyond halfway through the NFL season, fans are anticipating the possibilities their teams might have to secure a coveted Super Bowl berth. Being the highest-regarded American sporting event, the Super Bowl garners an incredible number of viewers from around the world, so its importance is easy to imagine. Adding to the scuffle, the 2020 revision of the NFL postseason structure has only continued to shape the playoff race. Here's everything you need to know about the NFL postseason format:The NFL playoffs signify end-inducing times for joyful fans and energetic teams as they battle for the prestigious Vince Lombardi trophy. In this thrilling atmosphere, 14 of 32 teams have definite chances to contend within the playoffs. The road to the big Super Bowl is cautiously put together for best teams to be in prize-fighting intense games against them.Fourteen teams are qualifying for the postseason event; seven of those come from the American Football Conference and seven more come from the National Football Conference. Before 2020, there were only 12 teams in this playoff match; a decision by the owners of the teams in March 2020 enlarged it to 14 playoff contests, hence bringing more excitement to the established postseason form.There are two ways through which a team can qualify. The top four seeds in each conference go to the division champions, which are judged mainly on their win-loss records from the North, South, East, and West divisions. The other six slots-three from each conference-go to the wild-card teams with the best records among non-division winners. Seeding is important, as it sets match-up and home-field advantages throughout the playoffs.The postseason of the NFL features three rounds of elimination bouts that culminate in the Super Bowl. The three segments include Super Wildcard Weekend, Divisional Round, and Conference Championships.In either conference, the last needy seeds in the playoffs advance directly into the Divisional Round after a first-round bye for being the top two seeds. Additionally, these top seeds enjoy home-field advantage over the lowest remaining seed, giving them a strategic edge.Playoff seedings depend on performance during the regular season. Each division winner ranks from 1 to 4 according to its win percentage and wild cards slots number 5-7 with the next best records. In the event of ties, as usual, there are various tiebreakers provided by the NFL, moving as far as a coin toss if required.The remaining two teams from each conference's two divisional-round games play each other in their conference championship games. The higher seed will host the game. The winning teams from the AFC and NFC Conference Championship games compete and earn a spot in the Super Bowl. The Super Bowl takes place at a predetermined site.Also Read: Forbes' Most Valuable Sports Franchises 2024: Jerry Jones' Cowboys tops the list yet again, despite on-field struggle The 59th Super Bowl will be held on February 9, 2025, at 6:30 p.m. ET. The much-awaited musical extravaganza in the United States would be a part of the Super Bowl halftime program, which typically lasts 12-15 minutes and features Grammy-winning hip-hop artist Kendrick Lamar. Lamar's 37 years of life have been spent in Compton, which is the heart of the Los Angeles rap scene. Lamar holds 17 Grammys for his work and performed in the Super Bowl halftime show in 2022 with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, and Mary J. Blige. In the past, the Super Bowl halftime shows have featured the likes of The Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson, Prince, Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCartney, and Beyonce. The last season's performance was given by the Grammy-winning artist Usher.","The NFL playoffs signify end-inducing times for joyful fans and energetic teams as they battle for the prestigious Vince Lombardi trophy.

LeBron James was sidelined due to injury

Joel Embiid faces new setback with injury woes



NBA fans have witnessed the actions of several players from different teams this week. While several headlines sparked discussion among fans, not all of them are good news. LeBron James has recently got a devastating update while Joel Embiid got caught up with a health concern. With that note, we have looked back to this week's biggest news handpicking the important updates for you to wrap up this week’s news roundup.Embiid had a hero's reinstatement in his lineup with the 76ers when he steered the team to beat the Chicago Bulls with a final scoreline of 108-100. Although it was a little shaky at first, missing his first seven attempts and being careful with a knee brace, Embiid exploded in the second quarter, where he netted 19 points and finished the game with 31 points and 12 rebounds. That was his fifth game this season after being out with a knee injury and personal reasons.The 76ers made it 19 points before closing out their fourth win in five matches. Coach Nick Nurse commended Embiid's efforts by saying, ""He certainly caught fire there with a little bit of variety."" It gave the team a lot of confidence coming back after getting used to his absence over the last seven games.Luka Doncic was named the NBA Player of the Week in the Western Conference after he took the team to a perfect 3-0 record and the Dallas Mavericks back to the NBA from December 2-8, 2023. The 25-year-old came back after his recovery from a wrist injury and recorded averages of 29.3 points, 11.7 rebounds, and 8.3 assists demonstrating his versatility. Here, Doncic recorded stellar performances over wins with Memphis, Washington, and Toronto by netting 14 of 32 three-point attempts this week. With the latest Player of the Week accolade, Doncic claimed the award for the fourteenth time in his career.That makes Tyler Hero of the Miami Heat the Player of the Week in the Eastern Conference.The Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr was furious by a controversial foul call in the Warriors' 91-90 loss to the Houston Rockets, which occurred with just 3.5 seconds remaining. The call, involving Jonathan Kuminga, was deemed crucial in determining the outcome of the NBA Cup quarterfinal. After reviewing the incident, the NBA supported the referee's decision, sparking further debate. Kerr criticized the call, stating, ""A loose ball situation, 80 feet from the basket, with the game on the line...I don't even understand what just happened."" He added, “I don’t think an elementary school referee would have made that call.”The Lakers legend LeBron James has missed his second game in a row due to a sore left foot. The Los Angeles Lakers confirmed that he wouldn't play in Friday’s game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Earlier this week, he had already taken some leave for personal purposes. He was set to be ""probable"" but ruled out just before Sunday because, for the second time this season, the foot injury kept James out. At this point, there has been no indication of when he will return.The 76ers star player Joel Embiid has been wrapped up with another sad news as he is expected to be sidelined at least for a few games. Embiid has suffered a nasal sinus fracture during a recent loss to the Pacers. After an accidental smack in the face, Embiid had to leave the game for the second quarter, at which point he had put up 12 points, five assists and four rebounds over just 17 minutes. Unfortunately, this latest setback adds to an already injury-dominated season for the Sixers star, as Embiid has managed to play in only six out of 23 games played this season.Also Read: LeBron James to miss second consecutive game due to left foot soreness This injury occurred when Pacers guard Bennedict Mathurin inadvertently hit Embiid while trying to grab an offensive rebound.

BRISBANE: The Indian cricket team has decided to release travelling reserves Yash Dayal , Mukesh Kumar and Navdeep Saini , and the trio are likely to feature in the Vijay Hazare Trophy starting from December 21.The three seamers have been with India squad right from the start of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy but the team management felt it would be ideal for them to get some game time under their belt now that only two Tests are left after the Brisbane fixture. India next play in Melbourne and Sydney before returning home after a long summer Down Under.While Saini and Mukesh were originally named as reserves by the Ajit Agarkar-led men's senior selection committee, Dayal was flown in as a replacement for Khaleel Ahmed, part of the original trio, who wasn't 100% during the team's nets in Perth.For Mukesh, it has been a very long trip as he travelled with the India A squad for the two fixtures which preceded the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. It is understood that he is set to feature in the Vijay Hazare Trophy for Bengal which starts in a week's time.As far as Saini is concerned, he only played one India A fixture and has been on net duties since then. The seamer was in Brisbane on the opening day where he saw the little action from the stands but is now all set to take the flight home.It is further understood that Yash Dayal has already reached home and will be gearing up for the white-ball tournament for his state Uttar Pradesh.","Yash Dayal, Mukesh Kumar and Navdeep Saini released by India cricket team.

NEW DELHI: India's pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah 's frustration was evident as he took the new ball on a rain-hit opening day of the third Test at the Gabba in Brisbane. The overcast conditions seemed ideal for swing bowling, but the lack of movement left Bumrah visibly disappointed. His dissatisfaction was even audible on the stump mic during Day 1, as he lamented the unresponsive conditions.Only 13.2 overs were bowled in the first session due to rain, and despite adjusting his lengths in the fifth over, Bumrah found no success.His frustration boiled over as he remarked on the stump mic, “Nahi ho raha swing, kahin bhi kar (There is no swing no matter where you bowl),” while walking back to his bowling mark.However, Day 2 told a different story.Bumrah returned with renewed energy, delivering a spell of Test cricket brilliance that kept fans on the edge of their seats.Australia resumed at 28 for no loss, but Bumrah quickly made inroads.In the fourth over of the day, he dismissed Usman Khawaja (21 off 54) with a delivery that straightened just enough to take a faint edge through to the wicketkeeper, marking the third time he had removed the left-handed opener in the series.Bumrah struck again in his very next over, dismissing Nathan McSweeney (9 off 49) for the fourth time in three Tests.A delivery angled across the right-hander induced a thick outside edge, which flew swiftly to Virat Kohli at second slip, underlining Bumrah's masterclass with the red ball.","Jasprit Bumrah takes three wickets on opening day of third Test at Gabba.

NEW DELHI: The ILT20 Gulf Cricket Championship 2024 witnessed two captivating matches at ICC Academy, Dubai, on Saturday, December 14, as Oman delivered a comprehensive victory over Qatar, and Bahrain clinched a thrilling win against Kuwait.Both matches showcased remarkable individual performances and intense competition, keeping cricket fans thoroughly entertained.In the fourth match of the tournament, Oman outclassed Qatar with a commanding 35-run victory, thanks to a stellar performance from Jatinder Singh Batting first after being put in, Oman posted a formidable total of 204 for five in their allotted 20 overs.Captain Jatinder Singh led from the front with a brilliant knock of 69 off 50 balls, anchoring the innings with skill and grace. His innings featured six 4s and two sixes and laid the foundation for a massive total.While Jatinder was the steadying force, the explosive finishes by Wasim Ali, who smashed 34 off 19 balls, and Vinayak Shukla, whose unbeaten 40 off just 18 balls included seven fours and a six, ensured Oman crossed the 200-run mark.Qatar's bowlers struggled to contain the onslaught, with Ikramullah Khan proving the most expensive, conceding 53 runs in his four overs.Qatar put up a spirited fight, led by the explosive Muhammad Asim, who smashed 63 off 28 balls, including six 4s and three sixes. Despite his valiant effort, Qatar fell short, finishing at 169 for eight in their 20 overs.Oman’s bowling attack proved too strong, with Aamir Kaleem spearheading the effort with three wickets for just 19 runs. Wasim Ali chipped in with two crucial wickets, while Jay Odedra provided a vital breakthrough.Qatar’s innings faltered as wickets fell at regular intervals, with the final nail coming when Muhammad Asim departed in the final over. Oman's disciplined bowling and energetic fielding sealed the win, earning Jatinder Singh the Player of the Match award for his standout contribution with the bat.Earlier in the day, the third match of the tournament saw Bahrain secure a nail-biting four-run victory over Kuwait in a low-scoring encounter. Batting first after losing the toss, Bahrain struggled to build momentum and were restricted to 125 for eight in their 20 overs.Ahmer Bin Nasir stood out for Bahrain with a gritty 42 off 38 balls, holding the innings together amid regular losses at the other end.Sai Sarthak added a useful 26 off 23 balls, while Kuwait’s bowlers, led by Mohammed Aslam , Mohamed Shafeeq, Mirza Ahmed, and Sayed Monib with two wickets each, kept the Bahrain batters in check. Despite these efforts, Bahrain’s late push allowed them to set a challenging target.Kuwait’s chase started poorly as they lost wickets early, with their top order crumbling under pressure. Ravija Sandaruwan, their opener, could only muster five runs before falling to Imran Anwar, who had a memorable outing with the ball.While Meet Bhavsar’s 27 off 32 and Muhammad Umar’s 21 off 15 provided some resistance, Bahrain’s disciplined bowling attack consistently pegged back Kuwait.Imran Anwar, with figures of three for 27, dismantled the middle order, while Rizwan Butt delivered an outstanding spell, taking two wickets for just 10 runs in his four overs.The late fireworks by Sayed Monib, who smashed 12 runs off just three deliveries, gave Kuwait a glimmer of hope, but their innings ultimately folded at 121 in 19.3 overs, leaving them agonizingly short of the target. Imran Anwar was deservingly named Player of the Match for his crucial wickets that tilted the match Bahrain’s way.","The ILT20 Gulf Cricket Championship 2024 witnessed two captivating matches at ICC Academy, Dubai, on Saturday.

GOOD DRAW

PERSISTENT FOREST

Premier League leaders Liverpool salvaged a 2-2 draw at home to Fulham despite trailing twice and having Andy Robertson sent off after 17 minutes on Saturday as chasing Arsenal were left to rue being held to 0-0 stalemate at home to Everton.On what turned out to be a good day for second-placed Chelsea, who face Brentford on Sunday, Liverpool would have been far happier with their draw than title rivals Arsenal.Diogo Jota scored an 86th minute equaliser at Anfield as Arne Slot's side avoided a second league defeat of the season.They have 36 points from 15 games, five more than Chelsea, while Arsenal's failure to score at home for the first time this season left them still six points off the pace having played one game more than the two sides above them.Nottingham Forest moved above champions Manchester City into fourth place as late goals by Nikola Milenkovic and Anthony Elanga saw them hit back to beat visiting Aston Villa 2-1.Newcastle United returned to form in emphatic style as they thrashed Leicester City 4-0 with Jacob Murphy scoring twice.At the bottom, the pressure increased on Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Gary O'Neil as his side lost 2-1 at home to fellow strugglers Ipswich Town.Jack Taylor scored a last-gasp winner for 18th-placed Ipswich who are now only one point from the safety zone. Wolves, in 19th, have now lost four league games in succession.There are good draws and bad draws and Liverpool's will definitely feel like the former as they emerged from a difficult afternoon with minimal damage at Anfield.""A great comeback is very positive. It's disappointing having 10 men but we showed fight, kept trying to create chances. Could have been more but we take the point and move on,"" Liverpool skipper Virgil van Dijk said.""Stay calm. It's easier to say than do it. It was always going to be tough against them.""Liverpool got off to the worst possible start as Fulham took the lead in 11th minute through Andreas Pereira's stretching volley and then left back Robertson was dismissed, after a long VAR check, for denying Harry Wilson a goalscoring opportunity.Cody Gakpo's diving header from a Mohamed Salah cross brought Liverpool level straight after halftime and they were chasing the win when Rodrigo Muniz stunned the hosts to put Fulham back in front after 76 minutes.However, Jota came off the bench in the 79th minute for his first appearance since October because of injury and slotted past goalkeeper Bernd Leno in the 86th to salvage a point.ARSENAL FRUSTRATEDArsenal failed to score at home for the first time since April as they could not find a way through a blue Everton barricade at The Emirates.Despite overwhelming pressure they lacked attacking spark and even when they did get a sight of goal England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford proved unflappable, making great saves from Bukayo Sako, Martin Odegaard and Gabriel Martinelli.Everton barely ventured forward but celebrated a gritty point which left them in 15th place with 15 points.""Very disappointing not to win the game. We fully deserved to win the game,"" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said.""We conceded no shots. We dominated play. When we generated big chances we didn't score a goal.""Forest have now won six of their last nine league games after showing great persistence to overturn a deficit against Villa at a raucous City Ground.Jhon Duran's header had looked like sending Villa fourth, especially when Forest's in-form striker Chris Wood had a late leveller wiped out for offside after a long VAR check.But Milenkovic headed in a cross by Morgan Gibbs-White in the 87th minute before substitute Elanga slotted home his first goal of the season to claim all three points.Ipswich secured only their second win of the season as substitute Taylor struck in the 94th minute at Molineux.An unfortunate own goal by Matt Doherty gave Ipswich an early lead but Wolves were rewarded for a positive response when Brazilian forward Matheus Cunha, assisted by Goncalo Guedes, finished past keeper Arijanet Muric.Newcastle's first win in five league games lifted them to 11th with 23 points, only four points behind fourth-placed Manchester City who host Manchester United on Sunday.",Premier League leaders Liverpool salvaged a 2-2 draw at home to Fulham despite trailing twice and having Andy Robertson sent off.

Teams look to fill gaps in

WPL mini auction

BENGALURU: After 134 matches spread across 12 venues in a span of 21 days, it all boils down to two teams in the final of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy on Sunday. If red-hot Mumbai have their eyes on their second domestic T20 title, Madhya Pradesh are keen to taste their maiden success at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium here.Such prestigious finals always bring an element of additional pressure. It is at this juncture the experienced and in-form players need to rise to the occasion.With the venue having shorter boundaries and known for batting-friendly conditions, the batters will be in focus. Two in-form players -Ajinkya Rahane (432 runs @ strike rate of 169.41, Mumbai) and Rajat Patidar (347, 182.63, Madhya Pradesh), who both have different roles to play, will be keen to carry their superb form on the big day.Rahane, who is the highest run scorer in the competition, only started to open the innings midway. He looked good in the middle order too, but his impact at the top of the order has stood out. The former India captain, who has scores of 98 (56b), 84 (45) and 93 (53), in the last three matches, has provided flying starts. He has helped set the tone for the likes of Shreyas Iyer (329 runs), Shivam Dube and others to capitalise.With Rahane being the big fish, his battle with MP speedster Avesh Khan , who has scalped ten wickets, will be intriguing early on while spinner Kumar Karthikeya (16) wickets has delivered too.Despite a small purse of Rs 15 crore and a meagre 19 slots to fill, the Women's Premier League (WPL) mini auction in Bengaluru on Sunday assumes importance as teams vie to fill the gaps in their lineup reports Manuja Veerappa. The five franchises will have a pool of 120 players to pick from. The focus will be on Gujarat Giants, who have the biggest purse of Rs 4.4 crore to fill the four slots available in their roster.Highlights: Slots available:19; Indian players: 91; Internationals: 29. Key players: Tejal Hasabnis, Sneh Rana (both India), Deandra Dottin (West Indies), Heather Knight (England), Orla Prendergast (Ireland), Lauren Bell (England), Kim Garth (Australia), and Danielle Gibson (England).",Mumbai face Madhya Pradesh in the final of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.

This mistake provided Gukesh with the winning opportunity.The viewing rooms near the playing arena erupted in cheers. Jubilant fans, comprising many Indians who had travelled to witness the match and local Singaporeans of Indian descent, celebrated Gukesh's victory.Gukesh's win surpasses the previous record held by Russia's Garry Kasparov, who claimed the title at 22. Gukesh has achieved this feat at the age of 18.He has become the second Indian to hold the World Chess Championship title, following in the footsteps of five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand Gukesh's victory in game 14 resulted in a final score of 7.5 against Ding's 6.5. This cemented his exceptional rise to chess stardom. He had already become the youngest-ever challenger for the world championship.Each classical game victory in the $2.5 million World Chess Championship 2024 was worth $200,000 (approximately Rs 1.69 crore).

Liren, by winning two games, won $400,000 (approx Rs 3.38 crore).The remaining $1.5 million in prize money will be split equally between the two opponents.That would take Gukesh's prize money to $1.35 million (approx Rs 11.45 crore) and $1.15 million (approx Rs 9.75 crore) for Liren.","Gukesh's win surpasses the previous record held by Russia's Garry Kasparov, who claimed the title at 22.

Meet Matthew Hayden's daughter Grace | Loves dal curry and roti, is a big fan of Rishabh Pant

Live from Brisbane: Crazy rain stops play | Forecast not good for third India-Australia Test

Shubman Gill: 'We will treat it as a three-match Test series'

It was a frustrating morning of waiting in Brisbane as heavy downpour allowed very little cricket on the opening day of the third India-Australia Test in Brisbane. Only 13.2 overs were bowled and the fans got their umbrellas out, put the raincoats on but held on to their beer and enjoyed their Saturday morning, even if it was without any cricket.With the players rushing indoors, the gentleman on the live grill was aggressively dishing out the sausages to the thousands who had come for a big fat party!Amid all this, former Australia cricketer Matthew Hayden 's daughter was casually strolling in the corridor with very little cricket a dampener for her too. The 22-year-old, however, was still up for a chat on cricket and touched upon her love for India, the food and the spices.""I love India. I always heard a lot about India growing up from my dad, he still brings spices home. So I'd always be trying Indian food. I love a dal curry and a roti. Love your roti. Dad would always bring India home to us. So people would always say to me, you know, 'did you struggle at first with Indian food?' And I said, 'No, I love it',"" said Grace in a candid chat with TimesofIndia.com.Having watched a lot of cricket herself on the television, and even from the ground, she follows the circuit very closely and is a big fan of India wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant . It took her half a second to name Pant has her favourite cricketer from this Indian team and it was the youngster's return from the horrific car crash which continues to be an inspiration.""I think his comeback story has been sensational. We saw him go as the most expensive player in IPL history just recently. And yeah, we all saw the vision of the accident, and for him to come back and still start and even make this incredible team is just credit to him. The hard work, determination, mentally that would have been really tough to come back from. Obviously I'm Australian, but I'm proud of him, and he obviously has great strength as a player, as a person. He's always been exceptionally lovely. He's definitely an inspiring player,"" says Grace.Pant is definitely a crowd favourite in this part of the world but the same can't be said about Mohammed Siraj. The seamer was constantly booed when he stood on top of his run-up today and even while the series has been a bit low-key on the onfield drama, the Travis Head-Siraj episode definitely injected some fire. Has the IPL, like the rain today, dampened the intensity between these two sides as compared to the years gone by?""I think because the IPL is around, these players are playing together more often. They're intertwining all the time. But I think when you are stepping onto the field playing for your country, none of that matters, and it always has been the case you want to win for your country,"" said Grace and added that her father himself was a fierce competitor on the field but completely different off it.""My dad is a big teddy bear giant.

NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan cricketers never fall short of taking digs at each other. And the feisty character that Harbhajan Singh is, the former off-spinner is always up for a contest.While commentating in the third Test between India and Australia at The Gabba in Brisbane in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy , Harbhajan lauded India pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah for dismissing Usman Khawaja and also took a sly dig at former Pakistan spinner Saeed Ajmal Khawaja, who has been struggling for runs at the top of the order, had a torrid time playing and missing against Bumrah.He added just two to his overnight 19 before Bumrah finally drew the faintest of edges through to wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant Harbhajan says in a clip shared by the official broadcaster, ""Because Bumrah is science man. I was watching an interview of Saeed Ajmal with Usman Khawaja and in that he had said 'What is science, man, science is man.' So Bumrah is science, he is a very big scientist, his work starts where science fails because he knows where to pitch the ball. And that's an art, Bumrah knows how to make a batsman play and Khawaja doesn't know how to play Bumrah. He is special, he is different from others, his art is different and his stats show what a great bowler he is.""And as fate would have it, Bumrah dismissed Australia opener Nathan McSweeney on the very next ball having him caught by Virat Kohli and that prompts Harbhajan to say in excitement, ""He is special, Bumrah, this is science.""This was the fourth time that Bumrah dismissed McSweeney in this series.The Indian bowlers, who were wasteful in their brief outing on Day 1, were much tighter and troubled all the Australian batsmen.",India and Pakistan cricketers never fall short of taking digs at each other.

"World Chess Championship: Fair Play Officer found job easier due to D Gukesh, Ding Liren’s impeccable behaviour",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/world-chess-championship-fair-play-officer-found-job-easier-due-to-d-gukesh-ding-lirens-impeccable-behaviour/articleshow/116329998.cms,"D Gukesh vs Ding Liren (PTI Photo)

In the high-pressure crucible of the World Chess Championship , it wasn’t just the brilliance of D Gukesh ’s moves that left an indelible mark – it was his unwavering poise under tense situations that etched an unforgettable impression. The 18-year-old prodigy played not only with his mind but also with his heart, fighting every battle as though the board was a stage and he, the lead actor in a drama of unyielding resolve.Yet, it was his demeanour, as much as his daring, that caught the attention of those who observed him up close. Aleksandar Colovik , the Fair Play Officer of the blue-ribbon event tasked with ensuring the tournament’s integrity, noted that his job was made easier because of how well-behaved both Gukesh and former champion Ding Liren were.“They are very similar in many ways – both cultured and well-mannered. They both shook their legs when nervous, but in different ways. They were also very cooperative and kind. True gentlemen,” Aleksandar told TOI.In a world where chess geniuses often arrive wrapped in eccentricity, the Chennai teen has stood apart. Even in moments of extreme pressure, Gukesh maintained an aura of focus. Aleksandar, who observed every move with the precision of a hawk, quickly identified the quality that set Gukesh apart.“Actually, I was really impressed by Gukesh’s constant desire to put up a fight. I think Garry Kasparov or someone had said, ‘In a match between two players, the fighter always wins.’ Gukesh was the better fighter in this tournament. If you look at the games, when Ding was playing with the white pieces, he often avoided a fight. He wanted to be safe – wanted a draw.""But Gukesh wasn’t doing that. He took it to the extreme, avoiding a draw even in positions where he was objectively worse. This characteristic of being a true fighter, not shying away from a challenge, was the main difference that decided the champion,” said Aleksandar, a seasoned Fair Play Officer with extensive experience in events like the Grand Prix and the Candidates Tournament.After the victory, Gukesh praised his 32-year-old opponent, calling him a “true champion” and expressing his admiration. “I would also love to thank my opponent, Ding Liren. He is, in my eyes, a true champion, and we saw that despite a lot of pressure on him, he was able to put up a huge fight. I really admire you,” Gukesh said during the closing ceremony. This graciousness, especially at just 18, added to the impression of a young champion defined not only by his moves but also by his character.Meanwhile, Russian Chess Federation president Andrei Filatov has questioned the way Ding lost to Gukesh, calling for an investigation by FIDE . In response, Aleksandar remarked, “That blunder didn’t come out of nowhere. I mean, this was a long, gruelling game where Gukesh was pressing and pushing, while Ding just wanted the game to end. He was a few moves away, thinking nothing could go wrong, but then he messed up. After almost a month of constant pressure, people crack. That’s normal.”The officer’s role in the tournament was both challenging and rewarding, especially in an era where technology has blurred the lines of fair play. “Players were scanned before entering the play area, passing through different types of scanners to ensure they didn’t have any devices on them or their body. I also ensured no signals entered the glass cube. I really enjoyed it. I knew that maybe I’m becoming part of history here,” Aleksandar explained.",D Gukesh beat Ding Liren to win the World Chess Championship.

Former Aussie gloveman and explosive bat,

talks to TOI about what makes India's wicketkeeper so special with bat in hand, how he would have played Bumrah and why most big players struggle to say goodbye...

BRISBANE: The media and broadcast enclosures here at the Gabba are tightly packed units, buzzing with activity, trailing loops of wires and heavy equipment. Connecting them is a narrow, winding, claustrophobic corridor with barely room for two to walk alongside. It's like being inside a space shuttle.This is the engine room of the Gabba, and it is here that Adam Gilchrist, Australia's iconic cricketer who redefined the role of a wicketkeeper-batter, has agreed to talk cricket. He seeks out a quiet corner. There is none. As he talks, people jostle past him. None of that matters because Gilchrist is talking about his favourite person, Shane Warne , the leg spinner with the gift who isn't with us anymore.""I miss Warney so much,"" he tells TOI, then repeats for emphasis, ""A great deal. Him and Andrew Symonds and Rod Marsh . We like to talk about them because it means we keep their legacy and spirit alive. You know, keeping wickets to Shane Warne was the highlight of my cricketing career.""The highlight? This is Adam Gilchrist, one of the world's most-loved cricketers, now or in his playing days. The marauder with bat in hand who made the best of bowlers look pedestrian. The white-ball belter who marched alongside Matthew Hayden to open, then proceeded to carve games open as Australia won three World Cups.The explosive No. 7 in Tests who scored at a strike rate of 81.95 and scored 17 hundreds. The trailblazer who waited long to be picked for the longer format, then announced his intentions early, in just his second Test, with an unforgettable, unbeaten second-innings 149 in Hobart against Pakistan to fashion a chase of 369 runs.Then there was Gilchrist the safe wicketkeeper, the one who eased into Ian Healy's big shoes and then reshaped the role. There was the stand-in captain too, the one who conquered the final frontier by fashioning a series win in India. Listing all of Gilchrist's achievements could take all day, but that's not what's on his mind.It was the best thing I did in cricket, keeping wickets to Warney,"" he continues, matter-of-factly. ""He was okay for me to pick him out of the hand. I could read him from the hand, but that didn't mean they were easy takes for me. With the same action and delivery, he spun some big, he spun some small. It was great fun. I had the best seat in the house when he bowled.""So, was Warne the greatest modern era spinner? Gilchrist gives the impression he doesn't like such comparisons. ""I can only speak from my experience. I played against Murali. I played against Anil (Kumble). Harbhajan was hard for me, I had challenging times against Harbhajan. But I think Warnie was the greatest all-round cricketer that I've played with. His bowling, even his batting, his catching, his cricket mind, he was right up there, clearly one of the best spinners. He was such a great character.""Talking about characters, Gilchrist's current favourite is Rishabh Pant , and we move on quickly to the ongoing series as rain pelts the Gabba on Day One of the third Test. Maybe he sees a bit of himself in Pant , an explosive wicketkeeper-batter who can keep the Gilchrist flame burning?Gilly's eyes light up. ""He's a miracle, isn't he? I watched on like the rest of the world, how nasty the accident was. The initial outlook didn't look fantastic, but he's worked some magic. Clearly a lot of dedication and hard work has gone into his recovery. Now to see him back on the field is wonderful,"" he says, then declares unequivocally: ""Pant is the most entertaining cricketer in the world right now.""What is it about Pant that makes him so special? Gilchrist thinks for a few seconds, smiles and shakes his head as if impressed. ""Well, we saw glimpses of that in Adelaide, didn't we? You're not sure what you're going to get from him. What you do know is that he entertains. What I admire is his ability to go from defence to offence so quickly. He can look really calm and composed and then all of a sudden, almost stealth-like, he'll attack the bowler, catch him off-guard. That's a great quality. I've never played that falling scoop even in my backyard! I never even thought about it!""Gilchrist isn't too concerned that Pant has been inconsistent of late. ""It's not that big (of a problem). He hasn't played a huge amount of cricket. I asked him about his leg, 'keeping-wise, and he didn't seem to think it was too much trouble. It was just about the recovery, making sure he puts ice on his knee every day. I used to do that too, and I never had the accident. For him to have his knee rebuilt, it must be challenging, but I think he's really making a good fist of it. We've got to give him time.""Also, his playing style is such that there'll be patches when he won't be consistent. I was a bit similar. I was an attacking player. That (inconsistency) comes with the territory, like Travis Head . There'll be times when it won't work, and people will say he's being too attacking, but I think Pant should play his natural way. That's the way he'll get the best results. Be patient with him and trust that he'll deliver more than he doesn't deliver.""Pant isn't the only Indian cricketer to have charmed Australia's cricket-loving masses on this tour, and this seems a good time to sneak the Jasprit Bumrah question in. How would 'Gilly' in his prime take down Bumrah? Could he even?""I'm not too sure,"" Gilchrist says, wide-eyed, and his mind goes back to his problems against Andrew Flintoff bowling around the wicket. ""I faced Flintoff in his prime in 2005. As a left-hander it was very similar angles (to Bumrah), and that was really challenging.""Somehow, you've got to try and find a way. You don't have to be ultra-aggressive, just tick over the scoreboard a little bit, don't get caught at the crease for too many of Bumrah's deliveries in a row. Bumrah, if he can bowl two or three overs to the same batter, he can get accurate enough to try and create a chance. Just keep getting off strike!"" Would the squash ball in his glove help? ""Who knows,"" he chortles.Gilchrist closed his chapter in a hurry at 96 Tests, walking away the moment he felt things weren't quite the same and late-career struggles started overwhelming the mind. Does he think most ageing batting stalwarts stick around longer even as their powers wane, in vain hope of a final hurrah or a few more years at the top? How did 'Gilly' himself feel about things at the end?""Well, I retired,"" he says, bluntly. ""I just got out of there. I knew as soon as I dropped VVS Laxman it was time for me to go (in Adelaide, Jan 2008, Gilchrist's last Test). A lot of these players, when they hit that age, it just starts to drop off a bit. I went into my last Test having no idea I was going to retire. And then I dropped a catch off that bloke's bowling!""Gilchrist points to pace legend Brett Lee, who is smiling quietly in the corner. Lee has been listening in for a while now, and chimes in, ""He's only ever dropped one in his life!""With that, it's time to go, just like Gilchrist did all those years ago, but he still wants the last word on the issue. ""Mother Nature plays its part. I can't comment for anyone else apart from myself."" And on that note, Adam Gilchrist, once-destroyer of worlds, disappears into the labyrinths of the Gabba.",Former Aussie gloveman and explosive bat Adam Gilchrist talks to TOI about what makes India's wicketkeeper so special with bat in hand.

BRISBANE: Judging from the little play that was possible on Day One of the third Test, India would have hoped for a better effort from their pacers. The big surprise, though, came at the toss as Rohit Sharma called right again and opted to field first.No doubt, the batting unit wears a fragile look and that might have played a big part in the decision. First-innings top-order collapses have been a regular feature for India on this tour. The batting concerns also showed in the inclusion of Ravindra Jadeja in place of Ravichandran Ashwin in the XI.On the face of it, the decision seems a cautious one. The overcast conditions and threat of impending rain no doubt would have influenced the team management, but fielding first brings with it its own set of concerns. First off, it puts the new-ball bowlers under immediate pressure. It showed in Mohammed Siraj 's unimpressive first spell as the Australian crowd continued its booing whenever he came on.This was the first time since 2014 that India have bowled first in an away Test. The last time India fielded first after winning the toss in Australia also came at the Gabba, back in 2003 under Sourav Ganguly 's captaincy.India would have been disappointed with what they discovered once proceedings began. There wasn't much swing on offer and the spongy bounce ensured Australia's openers were content to sit back. It is only when the sun shines that the pitch is expected to get faster. The pacers were also guilty of not bowling a bit fuller, near the 5m mark, to induce the batters forward.When the first rain delay came 5.3 overs in, Australia were 19/0, with both Khawaja and McSweeney content to bide their time. In that period, 58% of India's deliveries were short. Once play resumed, India seemed to have got the hang of it.Akash Deep, who as expected replaced Harshit Rana, looked penetrative, bowling fuller and getting a hint of away swing. Bumrah got Khawaja to square up a few times. The signs were promising when the second, and final, rain break came, with Australia 28/0 in 13.2 overs.The forecast isn't all that optimistic for Sunday either, but if the openers can negotiate the morning session safely on Day Two, Australia can start thinking big. It is important for India to make the most of the new ball from here on.",Rohit Sharma opts to field first after winning the toss at the Gabba.

Afghanistan secured a thrilling three-wicket victory over Zimbabwe in the third T20I at Harare Sports Club on Saturday. Veteran all-rounder Mohammad Nabi played a crucial role, smashing seven runs off three balls in the final over to clinch the series 2-1.Nabi's heroics included a four, a two, and a single in the last over, adding to the excitement following Afghanistan's 50-run win the previous day.Nabi remained unbeaten on 24, the second-highest score for Afghanistan. Fellow all-rounder Azmatullah Omarzai top-scored with 34 and also claimed two wickets.Zimbabwe set a target of 128 after being bowled out for 127 in 19.5 overs. Afghanistan reached the target with three balls to spare, marking their sixth consecutive T20I series win against Zimbabwe.""In the middle of our innings we lost some wickets cheaply which put pressure on us,"" Nabi told reporters.""But I managed to control my nerves and that gave me the confidence to go on and score the series-winning runs.""Next up is the one-day international series and this wicket is not easy to judge. The pitch for the first two games was better -- today it was up and down.""Afghan captain Rashid Khan continued his streak of winning the toss, opting to field first in this decisive match. This was a change in tactics compared to the earlier matches where Afghanistan had chosen to bat first.Rashid showcased his bowling prowess, taking 4-27, while Zimbabwean opener Brian Bennett led his team's batting with 31 runs, which included four boundaries.Afghanistan faced a challenging chase, stumbling to 44-4. A crucial 48-run partnership between Omarzai and Gulbadin Naib (22) revived their hopes.The tourists appeared to be in control until Omarzai was dismissed by Sikandar Raza with 13 balls left. This briefly gave Zimbabwe a glimmer of hope.However, Naib's quickfire 18-ball innings, featuring three fours, extinguished Zimbabwe's chances and secured the victory for Afghanistan.The two teams will now face each other in a three-match ODI series in Harare, starting on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Harbhajan Singh minces no words in slamming Australian players as the former India off-spinner has now accused legendary Australian wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist for his involvement in cheating against India in the 2007-08 tour.Harbhajan criticised Gilchrist, stating that he was not a ""gentleman cricketer"" and had been involved in cheating. He urged fans to stop idolising the former Australian wicketkeeper-batter as a saint.The infamous Sydney Test in 2008 between India and Australia was marred by controversies especially regarding umpiring decisions.During the match, Rahul Dravid was controversially dismissed after missing a straight ball from Andrew Symonds. Gilchrist immediately claimed the wicket, and Dravid was given out. The batter was stunned, and replays confirmed there was no edge, indicating the umpire made an error in judgment. This decision led to a heated debate over the fairness of the call.""He is often praised for walking off after nicking the ball. For me, he was not a saint, and we should stop praising him. He was also involved in cheating against India in that Sydney Test. He knew that Dravid didn't nick the ball but still claimed the catch. It was because of him the umpire declared the batter out. If he was so good, why did he appeal on that day?,"" Harbhajan said on Star Sports""On one hand he used to walk off to show the world that he was a good person, but on the other hand, he was involved in cheating. India were not playing against 11 players on that but against 13 ( two umpires). We could have easily drawn the game but ended up losing because of what happened on the field,"" he added.",Harbhajan Singh criticises Australian wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist.

NEW DELHI: West Indies skipper Hayley Matthews has observed that women's T20 cricket is becoming increasingly competitive, with lower-ranked teams showing improvement.She expressed her team's commitment to deliver their best performance in the T20Is against India, scheduled to begin in Navi Mumbai on Sunday.Despite India's disappointing group stage exit from the October T20 World Cup, West Indies, ranked sixth globally, advanced to the semifinal before losing to eventual runners-up New Zealand.""They're the top four for a reason because they probably are a better team and have better records. But at the same time I feel like every team is really starting to compete now,"" Matthews commented regarding the perceived gap between higher and lower-ranked teams.She further noted at Saturday's post-training media session, ""When you look at a World Cup like just now the one that we played, you had no idea who would have beaten who in every single match.""""I'm pretty sure no one had it to be a final four of West Indies, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. Probably, no one had a final of New Zealand and South Africa settled as well. It just shows that the women's game is getting more and more competitive. I feel like the teams towards the bottom are starting to climb up,"" she added.Matthews acknowledged that whilst West Indies, who clinched the 2016 T20 World Cup, experienced an extended transition period, they have now established themselves as a cohesive unit.Addressing their eight-match losing streak against India, Matthews stated, ""We were going through some type of transitioning period within the team and our record against anyone probably wasn't the best throughout that period.""""We've been working really hard and been really focused on our game and what we can improve. Coming up against a team like India, we know it is going to be a tough assignment. But we have been playing some really positive cricket over the last year and back ourselves to hopefully go out there and be able to change things around a bit.""With nine victories in 13 T20Is this year, West Indies have shown strong form. Matthews indicated that whilst the Women's Premier League mini auction coincides with their match on Sunday, the team's priority remains the T20 fixture.""I don't feel like too many of us are watching it too hard. We obviously know that it is coming up tomorrow but we also have a pretty important T20 match tomorrow as well. That's definitely (our) No 1 priority,"" she remarked.""If it is (the case) that a few of the girls (do) get picked up, that'll be great. The more players we can have playing in these kinds of competitions, it'll be better for the team.""""Especially coming off of a World Cup like the one we've just had, it certainly has opened a lot of eyes to the West Indian girls and what they can do.
