Sam Konstas on Kohli altercation: 'I was doing my gloves, he accidentally bumped me'

NEW DELHI: India placed their hopes on Rishabh Pant on Day 3 of the fourth Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, expecting the star wicketkeeper-batter to steer the team out of a challenging situation. While Pant initially looked in great touch, he soon gifted his wicket to Australia in a moment of poor judgment.The turning point came in fast bowler Scott Boland 's over.Pant attempted a pick-up lap over fine leg but missed, with the ball striking him on the stomach, causing visible discomfort.On the very next delivery, instead of taking time to recover, Pant walked across the off-stump and premeditated another lap shot. This time, the ball skewed high toward deep third man, where Nathan Lyon completed a well-judged catch.Pant’s dismissal drew sharp criticism for his reckless approach.“What a crap shot by Rishabh Pant. Ego pe baat aa gayi thi and ego kha gya. Terrible way to get out, and Pant is flop in this series so far,” a user commented on social media.“Rishabh Pant playing that pre-meditated ramp shot to a ball pitched outside offstump to get out.

FOLLOW-ON RULE

This rule is governed by Law 14 of the

MCC Laws of Cricket

:

NEW DELHI: India found themselves in a challenging position, trailing by 230 runs with only three wickets in hand (244 for 7) at lunch on Day 3 against Australia (474) in the Boxing Day Test .India still need 111 more to avoid the follow-on — a scenario that seemed unlikely on such a placid batting track.The unbeaten pair of Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja face the critical task of negotiating the morning session. Their survival at the crease is vital to prevent India from falling into a difficult situation.As per article 14.1.1 of MCC's laws of cricket, in a two-innings match of 5 days or more, the side which bats first and leads by at least 200 runs shall have the option of requiring the other side to follow their innings.Australia amassed an impressive total of 474 runs in their first innings. Should India be dismissed for a score of 274 or below, the home side could potentially enforce the follow-on. However, if India reach 275 runs, Australia will lose the right to enforce the follow-on and will have to bat in the second innings.The follow-on rule is basically used to enforce a batting team's second innings immediately after their first innings in Test cricket if they fail to score a minimum threshold in comparison to the opponent's first innings total.14.1 Lead on first innings14.1.1 In a two-innings match of 5 days or more, the side which bats first and leads by at least 200 runs shall have the option of requiring the other side to follow their innings.14.1.2 The same option shall be available in two-innings matches of shorter duration with the minimum leads as follows:- 150 runs in a match of 3 or 4 days- 100 runs in a 2-day match- 75 runs in a 1-day match14.2 NotificationA captain shall notify the opposing captain and the umpires of his/her intention to take up this option. Once notified, the decision cannot be changed.By enforcing the follow-on, Team A makes Team B bat their second innings immediately, skipping Team A's second innings. This strategy is often employed when time is limited or when the pitch is deteriorating, giving Team A a better chance of winning.The decision to enforce the follow-on rests solely with the fielding captain, making it a strategic choice based on match conditions.","Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja face the critical task of negotiating the morning session.

Caleb Williams Faces Fan Backlash After Bears' 6-3 Loss to Seahawks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/caleb-williams-faces-fan-backlash-after-bears-6-3-loss-to-seahawks/articleshow/116720859.cms,"Caleb Williams' Postgame Comments Have Bears Fans Seeing Red (Daniel Bartel-Imagn Images)

A night to, well...forget

Fans are so over it

What’s next for Chicago?

The Chicago Bears ’ season is practically a script for how not to do it. A 6-3 loss to the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday sealed their 10th straight defeat, and rookie quarterback Caleb Williams didn’t exactly help his case. While he admitted to mistakes during his postgame comments, his overall tone came off as detached. Fans? They weren’t having it.Williams told reporters, “Their frustrations go way longer back than I’ve been here. My job is to go out there and win games.” Fair, but it feels like sidestepping accountability when the offense is this bad. He threw for 122 yards with an interception, got sacked seven times, and posted a passer rating of 53.0. This isn’t just about legacy frustrations. It’s about now.Williams had another brutal outing. He threw for just 122 yards, no touchdowns, and one interception while being sacked seven times. That late-game sack before the two-minute warning? Costly. It erased any hope of setting up a field goal to tie things up. This wasn’t just a bad game—it was his fifth this season with fewer than 150 passing yards. For a supposed franchise QB, those numbers aren’t cutting it.To his credit, Williams did take some accountability: “I didn’t play well enough. I didn’t help put the team in a good position to win.” Sure, that’s what you say, but accountability only means something when it’s paired with improvement. And right now, there’s little evidence of that.The fanbase is spiraling, and honestly, who can blame them? Social media lit up with criticisms of Williams and the Bears organization. One fan tweeted, “This guy’s got talent, but leadership isn’t there. You can’t build around someone like that.” Another called his postgame comments “a masterclass in deflecting blame without actually taking responsibility.”It’s not all on Williams—this franchise has been a mess for years. The offensive line is a sieve, and the coaching staff seems allergic to adjustments. But when you’re the No. 1 overall pick, fair or not, the spotlight burns hotter.The season closes against the Packers next week, and the question isn’t just whether the Bears can win—it’s whether Caleb Williams can show something. Anything. Because right now, fans aren’t buying the excuses. And frankly, neither should he.The Bears face the Packers next, but it’s less about this season and more about what they’ll do to fix this mess. Williams has talent; no one doubts that. But the front office needs to surround him with better coaching and a functional roster if they expect him to succeed.Until then, the blame game between players, fans, and management will keep spinning. As for Williams, this season might not define his career, but it’s certainly not the start he—or the Bears—hoped for.Also Read : Mariah Carey’s ‘All I Want For Christmas’ at NFL Christmas Day games leaves fans nostalgic, but some disappointed","Caleb Williams threw for 122 yards with an interception, got sacked seven times, and posted a passer rating of 53.0.

But the thing was, he looked at the fielder. When you look at the fielder, when you turn, you've lost that vital second. And so naturally, you then think, 'No, I want to be able to make it.' Your balance is completely off. And it would have been a tight run. I think at that stage, why do you need to take a run that carries an element of risk? You're batting well, runs are coming,"" Gavaskar remarked.""At that stage, the risk was not really necessary. But it could have been completed only because Kohli is such a fantastic runner between the wickets.""Before the run-out, Jaiswal had been anchoring the Indian innings brilliantly, amassing 82 runs off 118 balls with 11 fours and one six.The talented opener seemed poised for a major milestone as he neared a well-deserved century.However, disaster struck late in the day as a mix-up with Kohli led to his dismissal.The incident unfolded when Jaiswal drove a full delivery from Scott Boland to mid-on and set off for a quick single.Kohli, however, held back, momentarily ball-watching. Pat Cummins pounced on the opportunity with a direct throw attempt that missed, but 'keeper Alex Carey capitalised on the chaos, collecting the ball and completing the run-out.The dismissal proved costly, triggering a mini-collapse in the Indian batting lineup.

Robert Griffin Thinks The Chicago Bears’ Fans Deserve Better



Caleb Williams Addresses The Media As The Chicago Bears Suffers Another Loss



The Chicago Bears are in a pretty sensitive situation at the moment. They lost their last matches to the Seattle Seahawks and had their tenth loss this season. While they have had a disastrous season in the 2024 NFL season, quarterback Caleb Williams has been held responsible by fans and experts for the loss. But now experts and fans have spoken about requiring a change in the Chicago Bears management and ownership. Ex NFL player Robert Griffin III has posted on X how the Chicago Bears’ fans deserve a better team than this.Ex NFL player Robert Griffin III wrote on X, “The Chicago Bears are the worst run franchise in the NFL. Their fans deserve better.” Many fans resonated with Robert’s opinion as a fan commended under Robert Griffin III’s post and wrote, “They are great fans and I miss the days when there was a real rivalry with the Packers. Frankly, though, they are impossible to watch for enjoyment.”Another fan seemed to point out that more than the players of the Chicago Bears, it is th ownership of the Chicago who is the “real problem”. The fan wrote “Like I said when they fired their coach earlier in the season. He wasn’t the real problem! The real issue is the ownership. Looks to the commanders to show what a change in ownership can do to a team…”As the Chicago Bears suffered a disastrous loss against the Seattle Seahawks last night at the Thursday Football match, as per reports, the Chicago Bears’ fans were heavily disappointed in the team and booed the Chicago Bears team and the players. As the match wrapped up, quarterback Caleb Williams spoke to the media after the match and made things clear about what the players of the Chicago Bears are thinking about at the moment.Caleb highlighted that the players are too focused on the games to react to any external facts even if it means that the fans are highly disappointed in the team. Caleb also cleared the air about people blaming him for the loss as he said this is only his first year in the team and fans have been frustrated with the team for a long time now. Caleb added,“This is my first year. Their frustration [fans] go way longer back than, you know, i’ve been here. My job is to go out there and win games. We don’t focus on outside noise.

Taylor Swift Was Not Spotted At Today’s Match Between The Kansas City Chiefs And The Pittsburgh Steelers



Taylor Swift’s Appearance At The Last Match Of The Kansas City Chiefs

As the Kansas City Chiefs geared up to face the Pittsburgh Steelers today, there was a lot of anticipation whether Taylor Swift , girlfriend of the Chiefs’ tough end Travis Kelce , will be attending the match. Unfortunately, Swift has not been spotted at the stadium yet and it seems like she has skipped this game. This has broken many hearts of her fans as they expected to spot her cheering Travis on. But there is a reason why she has skipped today’s match.As per reports by Page Six, Swift is extremely concerned about her safety. Swift only attends the home games of the Kansas City Chiefs which are held at the the Kansas City Chiefs home stadium, the Arrowhead Stadium. The reason for this is, that Swift’s security team has already done a thorough review of the Arrowhead Stadium and has deemed it safe for Taylor. The source said, “She’s not going anywhere unless she knows the venue intimately, and it has been thoroughly scouted and secured in advance.”This has been a pattern followed by Taylor Swift. She has not attended a single away game this season and is only spotted cheering and supporting Travis, with their family members, only when a certain match of the Kansas City Chiefs is held at its home stadium, the Arrowhead Stadium.Taylor has had a few security concerns this year which has probably made her more careful about being seen in public. Back in June, she was supposed to have an Eras Tour concert in Vienna. However, unfortunately, Taylor had to cancel that show at the last minute as authorities informed Taylor that there was a terror attack being planned at her Eras Tour concert.Two months ago, Taylor’s boyfriend, the tight end of the Kansas City Chiefs, Travis Kelce’s house in Kansas City was burglarised by an international gang of criminals who monitored his social media activity and match schedules to understand when he would be at home and when will his home be empty. It seems like these security concerns have made Taylor a bit scared about her appearances in public.Taylor wrapped up her legendary Eras Tour on 8th December in Vancouver, Canada. After that, she made a public appearance at the last match of the Kansas City Chiefs where they played against the Houston Texans at the Kansas City Chiefs’ home stadium, the Arrowhead Stadium. Taylor arrived at the stadium with her mother and was joined by Kelce’s mother, Donna Kelce. Taylor was spotted cheering on Travis as the Kansas City Chiefs finally won the game by defeating the Houston Texans. Taylor was spotted doing a group hug with her and Kelce’s mother. Travis and Taylor have been dating for more than a year and the love and respect that they have for each other shows in their interactions. They have also been very supportive of each other's career as Taylor has been spotted many times attending and cheering on Travis as he plays for the Kansas City Chiefs.Also Read: Travis Kelce reveals his obsession with Taylor Swift through a joke about number 13 that fans can’t stop talking about","Taylor Swift was not spotted at the Kansas City Chiefs match against the Pittsburgh Steelers today.

is going to continue his comeback as he's listed “probable” for the December 27 matchup against the Cleveland Cavaliers , following his successful return from a right ankle sprain.Murray showed promising signs in his recent return against the Phoenix Suns, contributing 13 points, six rebounds, and six assists in 29 minutes while shooting 4-10 from the field and 1-2 from beyond the arc.The Denver Nuggets will need Murray's presence on the court as they face multiple roster challenges. Aaron Gordon (calf strain), DaRon Holmes II (Achilles tendon repair), and Vlatko Cancar (knee surgery rehab) are all confirmed out for the upcoming game.

Former NBA player Kendrick Perkins recently proposed a controversial trade scenario, suggesting the Nuggets should consider swapping Murray for Sacramento Kings' De'Aaron Fox.The trade discussion comes amid Murray's inconsistent 2024-25 campaign, where he's averaging 18.8 points, 4.2 rebounds, and 6.1 assists per game - his lowest scoring output since the 2018-19 season.Despite these rumors and statistical dips, Murray's integral role in Denver's 2023 championship run makes any potential trade unlikely.

Jalen Hurts Unlikely To Return For Game Against Cowboys; Kenny Pickett Could Be Filling In

The Eagles are set to face the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday afternoon but without quarterback Jalen Hurts . Hurts has been in concussion protocol since his head hit the turf during Sunday's loss to the Washington Commanders. During his Friday press conference, head coach Nick Sirianni kept things vague when asked about Hurts' availability, stating that it was hard for the quarterback to return for the next game.Jalen Hurts was not a part of Thursday's practice with the Philadelphia Eagles , which cast doubts on his availability for their Week 17 game against the Cowboys. Sirianni's comments on Friday have led to speculation that backup Kenny Pickett may be getting the call. “It’s going to be tough for him to make it this week,"" Sirianni said.Pickett, who came in for Hurts for the rest of the Commanders game, was a part of Thursday’s practice after dealing with a rib injury.Sunday's game is a key one for the Eagles as they could snag the NFC East ranking with a win or a tie. “It’s a big opportunity. Been working hard to stay ready. Felt like I was in a good position last game with my preparation. Now having a week to practice. I’ll feel even better going into the stadium. I’m excited. Just want to get the win,” said Pickett.Running back Saquon Barkley who is the first player in NFL history with four rushing touchdowns of 65+ yards in a single season shared his hopes for a win with Pickett.""You just never know — that’s the nature of the game,"" said Barkley. ""When your opportunity comes, you have to be ready for it. If that is this week, he has a great opportunity and 10 guys around him who believe in him and know he can help win this football game.”Although Pickett was picked by Pittsburgh in 2022, he grew up as an Eagles fan so the game against the Cowboys is a big moment for him and he will also have his family cheering for him in the stands as the Eagles try to secure the No.2 seed from the NFC, “I’ve got a lot of family coming. It’s a surreal feeling having this opportunity. I’m doing everything I can to be prepared and get ready for it.

Travis Kelce's ex, Kayla Nicole, may have spent a rather mindful Christmas as the television presenter took to social media multiple times this past week to share emotional words. Kayla, who dated Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce for five years before their 2022 split, shared a message for her sister and shortly after shared another cryptic post that hints at the challenges she faced this past year.With Her Deep, Emotional Message, Is Kayla Talking About Her Ex Travis Kelce?With a message on her Instagram Stories, Kayla shared a special moment for her and her family, as it shows the moment when her sister received her Christmas gift. Kayla titled the video with the phrase: ""My sister is all grown up"".But it was no ordinary gift which Kelce’s ex bestowed on her sister. It was a white Ford wrapped with a small red ribbon on top and it became evident. While her ex spent Christmas Day winning a big match against Pittsburgh Steelers and cementing his team’s Super Bowl ambitions, Kayla got some much-needed time with her family.Kayla shared other images of the Christmas celebration, including a clip in which her family shared a game to make the evening more fun. ""Nobody wins when the family fights,"" she captioned the picture. However, it’s possible that the the TV presenter is experiencing some post-festive blues as she heads into the new year because a day after Christmas she took to Instagram Stories to share a rather cryptic message which hints at the difficult year she has had.“If most people really knew your story and the things you’ve been through, they’d probably wonder why you’re still smiling. So, if you don’t hear it from anyone else, I’m proud of you,” her caption read. It’s possible that she’s hinting at the difficult breakup between her and Kelce, who started dating Taylor Swift a few weeks after his split with Kayla.Kayla has even mentioned her breakup on TV as she’s a part of “Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test,”“Going through a public breakup, it’s been overwhelming,” Nicole admitted in a voiceover and when her fellow recruits asked her to identify who her ex was, she mentioned Kelce’s name.It’s not totally clear if Taylor had a role to play in Travis and Kayla’s breakup which happened in 2022. Travis and Taylor were first seen together in the beginning of 2023 and Travis was spotted at one of Taylor’s concerts in the summer of 2023. Even if there was no infidelity involved, it’s possible that the publicity around Kelce’s new romance took a toll on his ex.Also Read : Amazon vs. Netflix NFL Showdown: Ryan Fitzpatrick’s Ice Bath Challenge Sparks Streaming Wars, Charissa Thompson Fires Shots at Netflix",Kayla Nicole and Travis Kelce broke up in 2022 after a five-year relationship.

Chiefs vs Steelers: Time and where to watch

Chiefs vs Steelers: Key players

The Kansas City Chiefs take on the Pittsburgh Steelers on Wednesday at 1 p.m. ET. The Chiefs have been scoring 11th this season but have fared much better on defense, ranking third in the league with 18.5 points allowed per game. The Steelers rank 12th on offense and 19.9 points per game on defense. More information on how to view the game on TV can be found here.The Kansas City Chiefs and Pittsburgh Steelers are set to play their third game in 11 days, an event which has only occurred once since 1933 when the Jacksonville Jaguars played their first game in December 2011. The Chiefs seek to have the best record in the AFC, while the Steelers are targeting the North Conference title.""You never want to play so many games in such a short time,"" said Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes. ""It's just not good for your body. But at the end of the day, it's your job, your profession. You have to come to work and do it.”Four teams, including the New York Jets, Seattle Seahawks, New Orleans Saints, and Dallas Cowboys, have accomplished three games in 11 days between 2019 and 2023. But this season's task is different as the players face games that might determine the AFC playoff scenario after playing 14 consecutive games.Steelers coach Mike Tomlin evaluates his players' thriving and survival in the final month of the regular season. The team is set to face the toughest stretch of games, as they play three opponents with winning records: Philadelphia Eagles, Baltimore Ravens, and Chiefs. Road losses to these teams have affected their position in the AFC North.The game will be played at the home of the Steelers, Acrisure Stadium. The match will start at 1:00 p.m. ET, 10:00 a.m. PT. It is going to be available for the first time on Netflix to live stream. Kansas City and Pittsburgh have had playoff berths this year, but both have yet to play for more in the game.Kansas City can get a one seed and a first-round bye with a win, out of reach for the Bills. The Steelers look for a division lead by sporting a conference tiebreaker into Baltimore but are unsure on keeping that. In the past five meetings, Kansas City holds a 3-2 record against Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh has scored 44 fewer points than Kansas City in their past five games.Patrick Mahomes threw for 4,183 yards in 16 games last year, with 27 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. He had a 67.2% completion percentage. Isiah Pacheco scored seven touchdowns and 935 yards, while DeAndre Hopkins had 75 catches for 1,057 yards and seven touchdowns in 17 games last season.Najee Harris has a high running rate (62.2 yards per game) and five touchdowns in 15 games. Russell Wilson has a high passing rate (22.6 yards per game) with 15 touchdowns and four interceptions, while Justin Fields has a high passing rate (110.6 yards per game) with five touchdowns and one interception.This Christmas, NFL football will be streamed on Netflix instead of national channels like NBC or FOX, and mobile subscribers can catch it with an NFL+ subscription.

Jets Coaches Reluctant to Elevate Malachi Corley Despite Promising Future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jets-coaches-reluctant-to-elevate-malachi-corley-despite-promising-future/articleshow/116730241.cms,"The Jets coaching staff has said their focus right now is on winning, which could mean that Corley’s development is not a priority right now. (Image Source: Getty)

Jets See ‘Bright Future' For WR Malachi Corley Despite His Underwhelming Year



The Jets’ third-round rookie Malachi Corley is facing a challenging time within the team, eventhough the coaches do see promise in him. Corley appeared in just three of the Jets' first seven games and in Week 9 the wide receiver dropped the ball on the goal line in a game against the Houston Texans, turning a potential touchdown into a fumble. Though the Jets coaching staff want Corley to learn from his more experienced teammates, they have also reiterated that the team’s priority right now is winning.Prior to Thursday’s practice, pass-game coordinator Todd Downing said Corley “certainly has gone through the season wanting more opportunities.” In eight games, Corley has registered three catches for 16 yards and two rushes for 26 yards. As per Downing, Corley’s not playing is more circumstantial than a skill issue.“Our priority is winning games, not evaluation,” Downing said. “And so we’re going to do what we feel puts us in the best position to compete and win games.“Malachi has got a bright future in this league and he’s got a skill set that will eventually help teams win football games. Right now, he’s fighting to get the scraps from Davante and G and Allen and so on. So I think he’s learning to be a pro.”As per insiders, the Jets coaching staff think Corley has not developed as a route-runner. Overall, Corely has been inactive for five games; since there are just two games left and the Jets are prioritising “winning games,” chances are that the team will give bigger roles to players who give the offense the best shot at success.Corley however is focusing on showing up for his team, despite the uncertainty. “Really having to hone in on your work every day, coming to work as if you are the starter, as if you are the guy. Because at any flip of the moment, you can go from playing no snaps to playing 50 plays in a single game,” Corley said.“So just staying prepared and mentally just being present every single day, taking the mental reps, being mindful of what I’m doing, and not just coming to work like woe me, woe is me, whatever, just really attacking the day as if I’m really the guy and that this is my chance to really show people who I am,” he added.On being asked whether he knows what he would need to do for the next season, he said, “I’m not really sure.”“Hopefully, they see me in a bigger role next year,” he said.Also Read : Ex-Dolphins QB claps back at Tom Brady over alleged disrespect","Jets' third-round rookie Malachi Corley is facing a challenging time within the team, eventhough the coaches do see promise in him.

""You have to understand the situation as well. You cannot say that's your natural game. I am sorry. That is not your natural game. That is a stupid shot; that is letting your team down badly.""When Gavaskar's co-commentator Harsha Bhogle added that there won't be too much of a conversation in the Indian dressing room, an infuriated Gavaskar said: ""He should not be going in that dressing room; he should be going in the other dressing room.""India were 244 for 7 at lunch on Day 3, still 240 runs behind Australia's first-innings total.The five-Test series is level at 1-1.",Sunil Gavaskar slams Rishabh Pant for his irresponsible shot-selection.

Devante Adams suggested that he could catch Aaron Rodgers 500th career touchdown pass

Wide receiver Davante Adams of the New York Jets is looking forward to catching Aaron Rodgers ' 500th career touchdown pass. Rodgers needs one more touchdown pass to reach the milestone, while Adams spent eight years with the Green Bay Packers , becoming a star on teams that made deep playoff runs but ultimately fell short of a Super Bowl victory.The 32-year-old, who began 2024 with the Las Vegas Raiders, was acquired by the Jets in a trade on October 15. He didn't turn New York's season around, but on an individual level, Adams improved with the Jets, averaging 79.9 receiving yards per game compared to 69.7 yards with the Raiders.In two weeks, the New York Jets will conclude their woeful 2024 season of 4-11 with their final two contests. Despite having Aaron Rodgers in good health and getting reinforcements for the offense coming over in a mid-season trade for Davante Adams, the Jets have often lost games. At season's end, many people will wonder if Davante Adams and Aaron Rodgers have futures in New York City.Speaking with reporters, Adams suggested that he could catch Rodgers 500th career touchdown pass, as he currently stands at 499. “Obviously I would love that. I got 200, I got 400, so it would be dope to get 500 as well,” Adams said. “I think 200 was my first [touchdown]. We’ve had some special connections in the past.” ""We've had some special connections in the past, so it'd be great,"" Adams said, via Cimini. ""And, obviously, it would be a big, big thing for him. Not that he needs more accolades and more milestones, but you might as well keep racking them up while you can.”On October 15, 2024, the Raiders traded quarterback Aaron Adams to the New York Jets for a 2025 conditional draft selection. The Jets were eliminated from playoff contention after a loss to the Dolphins in overtime, making the latter condition unfulfilled. Adams was reunited with Aaron Rodgers, whom he played with from 2014 to 2021 with the Green Bay Packers.Adams debuted with the Jets on October 20 in a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, catching three passes for 30 yards during the first half but his team lost 37-15.

Washington Sundar on Virat Kohli-Yashasvi Jaiswal run-out

MELBOURNE: In just 28 deliveries, India lost the advantage they had built for most of the afternoon at the Melbourne Cricket Ground ( MCG ). From a solid 153/2, the visitors collapsed to 159/5 in what was a mad period of 30 minutes on Day 2 of the ongoing Boxing Day Test between India and Australia. Yashasvi Jaiswal called for a run which was always going to be tight, Virat Kohli nicked one outside off after showing a lot of character during his 86-ball 36 and Rishabh Pant showed zero game awareness when he exposed nightwatchman Akash Deep in front of Scott Boland .It could have been a different story and a much better ending to the day for the visitors but that period of chaos has now put Australia in the driving seat as they still have a 310-run lead, and are just one wicket away from exposing India's lower-order.The momentum switched sides at a rapid pace, largely due to India's own mistakes, as they handed over the day to Australia on a platter. Jaiswal and Kohli had done all the hard work with their 102-run stand but the adrenaline rush got the better of the left-hander who went for a needless single off the last delivery of the 41st over.Jaiswal was batting beautifully and switched gears after completing his half-century as the runs came at a brisk pace after reaching the milestone. Before the mix-up, he had two boundaries and a six, and was in no mood to play for the clock. Just 18 short of what could have been his second hundred of the series, Jaiswal wanted the strike back to possibly have a crack at three-figures before stumps but mix-up not only cost him the wicket but also triggered a collapse.After just 12 deliveries, Kohli poked at a Boland delivery outside the off-stump and night watchman Akash Deep lasted only 13 balls before India lost their third in quick succession.Prior to that, it was India all the way as both Jaiswal and Kohli saw off the challenging period and were looking to cash in as the ball got softer. Kohli, in particular, looked very solid and was comfortably shouldering arms to deliveries he had been otherwise chased in the series. Every time Australia bowlers tempted him for one, Kohli let it go to the wicket-keeper and smiled back.The plan was not a top secret anymore but Kohli had trained his mind better for the fourth Test. He kept leaving, drove deliveries which were under his eye and made the bowlers bowl more towards his body.In the post-day press conference, Steve Smith lavished praise on the India batter and felt he was looking good for the big one today. Not just Kohli, Jaiswal was looking in an ominous mood after seeing off the testing period with the new ball but that mix-up came at the worst possible time for India.There is still some batting left but India need to bat out of their skins to make a contest out of this fixture now. They had it in control for most of the afternoon session but small lapses in concentration reduced them to 164/5 at stumps. Those small lapses are expected to have a big impact on the outcome of the game.",India lose three wickets in just 28 deliveries on Day 2 of Boxing Day Test. Australia still have 310-run lead and are just one wicket away from exposing India's lower-order.

ROURKELA: The last time Graham Reid was in Rourkela , he was the head coach of the Indian men’s hockey team and they had just been knocked out of the 2023 FIH World Cup. It wasn’t a happy ending for a man who led India to their first Olympic medal after 41 years at the Tokyo Olympics. However, he is back in India once more and this time as the coach of the Delhi SG Piper team in the newly-revamped Hockey India League ( HIL )Delhi will play the tournament opener against Team Gonasika at the Birsa Munda Stadium on Saturday evening.Reid is more than happy to be back in the country which is like ‘home’ to him, and he can’t wait for the tournament to start. But he understands a tough competition awaits in the league which will see eight teams fight it out for the ultimate prize.“Every coach will have the same challenge and that is making the group come together, making sure that all aspects of the game are covered. And that’s difficult because we haven’t had very much time together,” said Reid on the eve of their tournament opener against Manpreet Singh & Co.“The team that will win is the team that manages to keep on improving. So, you know, teams may not start as well, but it’s how we improve during the tournament that will matter.”Shamsher Singh, one of the co-captains of the Delhi side, meanwhile, pointed out that being fit will be another key aspect of the game. “Since each team will be playing 10 matches it’s important to stay injury free and concentrate on recovery. Then it’s all about giving our best when it matters the most.”While that will be the primary focus for every team, what’s most important is how much the junior India players can learn from it and improve in the coming days.The young stars made good use of the experience at the last HIL and won the Junior World Cup in 2016 in Lucknow and it’s something that the strategy director of Kalinga Lancers David John is hoping to see once again.“It’s exciting for Indian hockey. It’s necessary for Indian hockey that these young junior players receive this exposure to playing at a high level with good quality international and Indian players. It’s good for their development and good for the future of Indian hockey,” said John, who has been working in India for quite some time now.Harmanpreet Singh, captain of the Soorma Hockey Club and the India team, further added, “The Indian team’s success in the Olympics is due to the exposure the league provided us, at a young age. Rubbing shoulders with players you look up to and competing with and against them daily improved us more than we could imagine.”Thus, the league will aim to change the Indian hockey landscape for the better once again but with the tournament happening mostly in one city, besides a couple of matches in Ranchi, it remains to be seen how the players will stay fresh and motivated for more than a month.",Graham Reid is back in India as the coach of the Delhi SG Piper team in the Hockey India League.

MELBOURNE: In just a few seconds, hope gave way to despair here at the 'G'.India appeared to be scripting a great escape when everything unravelled dramatically with stumps in sight. Yashasvi Jaiswal , man of the hour, batting in supreme touch, had been looking fidgety since reaching the half-century mark. Having moved into the eighties, he whipped Scott Boland to mid-on and immediately set off for the run.It was Jaiswal's call, but it was still a tight run. At the other end, Virat Kohli , who had been displaying the kind of discipline which has deserted him in recent times, hopped out as if in response, then immediately turned his back and started ball watching.Faced with having to make that split-second choice, Jaiswal opted for the brain freeze and kept running towards disaster.Having put on 102 fluent runs in pursuit of Australia's steep 474 and rotated strike well till that point, the partnership was blossoming. It even seemed Australia's relentless pace attack had a fight on their hands.By the time Pat Cummins threw the ball in, both batters were stranded at the non-striker's end. The Aussie fielders swooped in like pall bearers of gloom. Cummins missed the stumps but wicketkeeper Alex Carey collected the ball, ran in and whipped off the bails at the striker's end. The fight went out of India.Jaiswal, the man with the penchant for the daddy hundreds, stormed off after gesticulating at Kohli, who expressed helplessness. In walked Akash Deep as nightwatchman, another strange decision by India. Kohli, by now, was distraught, his focus shot to pieces. Boland's next over, first ball, he committed the cardinal sin that has dogged him for a while now: fishing at the fifth-stump line.All afternoon, he had left the ball with supreme anticipation and rare self-control, so much so that Australia had to change their plans for him. Boland cleverly revived the idea. Kohli lunged with the bat, the ball found the edge and Carey was back in action.The dismissal made for the unlikely sight of Kohli trudging off to loud boos from a record Day Two crowd of 85,147 spectators, There was to be more unsavoury drama in store. Kohli, having just copped a fine for shoulder-barging Sam Konstas on Day One, has replaced Mohammed Siraj as the Australian media's enemy No. 1, with some tabloids putting headlines like 'Clown Kohli' on the cover and photo-shopping a ball on to his nose.He had come out looking like the guilty party in the run-out too, and the boos followed him as he entered the dressing room. Kohli walked back out, incensed, and seemed interested in a confrontation when security guards stepped in to defuse the situation.Thirteen balls after the Kohli dismissal, Akash Deep, having had a torrid time against Starc, fended awkwardly at a short one from Boland. The ball careened from the inside edge of his bat to the thigh pad to leg gully's hands. India had lost three wickets for six runs and eventually ended Day Two of the fourth Test at 164/5, still trailing by 310 runs, with Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja left to pick up the pieces on the third morning.Before that run-out, Jaiswal was batting like a dream in favourable conditions. Answering India's call, the man with the penchant for the daddy hundreds appeared to be coasting along against the quicks. With edges not carrying, he unfurled some bold strokes, a couple of good-looking drives and pulls and some excitable ramp shots over the slip cordon.Jaiswal had walked out to bat with Rohit Sharma , who returned to open but found the runs had still chosen not to follow. Demoted to No. 3, KL Rahul unleashed some exquisite drives until a peach of a leg-cutter from Cummins sneaked through, bringing the resolute Kohli to the middle.It isn't an easy time to be Kohli right now, unlike the batting great on the other side, Steve Smith , who rediscovered form with his second consecutive hundred, his 34th Test ton and the 11th against India. After fighting it out in Brisbane and finding some luck along the way, Smith eventually rediscovered his touch and fluency here at the MCG.Having ended Day Two batting on 68, he knocked off the 32 required with minimum fuss on the second morning. Not that it was much of a challenge, with India having begun the day on a bad note as well. Their bowling looked pedestrian apart from Bumrah, who for a while troubled Smith. The fielding was listless and the captaincy uninspiring at times.Smith added 112 brisk runs with Cummins, adding 31 runs in the first seven overs and 60 off the first 14. He hooked Bumrah for six to get into the nineties before a cracking cover drive off Nitish Kumar Reddy got Smith to three figures.Only the bizarre manner of his dismissal, charging down to Akash Deep and dragging one on, would have rankled the perfectionist.It was Smith and Australia's day, and India now find themselves staring at the abyss in this Test. Unless, of course, Rishabh Pant decides it's a good time for another miracle.","Yashasvi Jaiswal and Virat Kohli had put on 102 fluent runs in pursuit of Australia's steep 474. The fight went out of India as they lost three wickets for six runs. India ended Day Two of the fourth Test at 164/5, still trailing by 310 runs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116729176,imgsize-82858,width-400,resizemode-4/116729176.jpg"

(Photo by Martin Keep/AFP via Getty Images)

MELBOURNE: Captain Rohit Sharma may still be calling the shots on the field but as a Test batsman, he finds himself in a very lonely place right now. After Friday's failed attempt to recover from a prolonged slump by reclaiming his regular opening slot, the talk over his immediate future in the format is likely to get louder.On the second day of the fourth Test against Australia, Rohit walked out to bat with Yashasvi Jaiswal for the first time in the series. He only managed three runs off five balls, adding to a growing list of single-digit scores over his past few Tests, both at home and away.The manner of his dismissal, too, was bizarre - a leading edge off a tentative half-pull suggesting he was caught in two minds whether to go for the shot or leave the delivery from counterpart Pat Cummins alone.Perhaps Rohit is unable to trust his muscle memory, a common feature in batters who suffer prolonged run droughts, because he is one of the best exponents of the pull shot otherwise. Perhaps the mind is muddled. Perhaps he could do with a break?In his past 14 Test innings, Rohit averages 11.07 with one half-century. His scores read 6 and 5 in Chennai, 23 and 8 in Kanpur (both against Bangladesh), 2 and 52 in Bengaluru, 0 and 8 in Pune and 18 and 11 in Mumbai (all against New Zealand). On this Australia trip, after missing the first game in Perth, Rohit has batted at No. 6 in Adelaide and Brisbane, scoring 3, 6, and 10 across three innings before Friday's return to the opening slot.Where is Rohit Sharma the Test batsman of 2021, whose memorably constructed second-innings 127 fashioned victory for India at the Oval against England?India need Rohit back at his exhilarating best to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , but for the moment the issues are about his presence affecting the balance of the XI. India won the first Test of the series in Perth under Jasprit Bumrah 's captaincy when Rohit was on paternity leave, with KL Rahul opening instead and playing a significant role in that win.Not wanting to disturb a combo which has just won India an away Test, Rohit, when he returned as captain, agreed to take Rahul's usual middle-lower spot at No. 6 for the next two games. It seems he has not been unable to adjust to the role. Many experts and former captains have also been clamouring for him to return to the top and face the new ball.Perhaps all the chatter just got to Rohit. For the ongoing fourth Test, the in-form Rahul, who looked in good touch on Friday, was pushed down to No. 3 so Rohit could open. The regular No. 3, Shubman Gill , was dropped and a spin-bowling allrounder, Washington Sundar , was instead drafted in.India have failed to pick pacers to support Jasprit Bumrah and instead packed the side with allrounders to provide more batting depth in tough Australian conditions. With the runs not consistently flowing from Virat Kohli's blade either, the pressure has been on the lower middle order to pull off rescue acts.On Friday, after Rohit's dismissal, former India captain Sunil Gavaskar said on air here, ""(These are) tough times for him. There will be a second innings (here) and two more in Sydney. Questions will be asked if he doesn't score in those three innings.""Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting, who has always been an advocate for Rohit opening, expressed concern at the manner of his dismissal. ""That's just a lazy, not switched on, not up for the moment type of shot,"" Ponting said. ""He's been known as one of the best hookers and pullers of the ball since he made his debut but that's just not there. It's nothing. It's not committed, not really looking to be aggressive. He's just looking to tap it on the head.""Then there's the Ashwin factor. The famed off-spinner, one of India's greatest ever match-winners, retired in a huff after the Brisbane Test, ostensibly because he was not picked over Washington Sundar in Perth and not guaranteed a place in the XI for the Melbourne and Sydney Tests. Ashwin refused to be a passenger and left the squad immediately. If a player of his stature could be given the nudge, can the captain be above reproach?At 37, Rohit is at the backend of a glorious career and there are fears he could be in terminal decline as a batsman. In Australia, he'll be hoping a few more innings at the top will help him recover some semblance of his old prolific self. Else, chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar and head coach Gautam Gambhir may need to have a serious conversation with India's captain. Failure in the second innings of the Boxing Day Test will raise speculation to fever pitch.","Rohit Sharma has failed to recover from a prolonged slump as a Test batsman. The 37-year-old has scored just 11 runs in his past 14 Test innings. The manner of his dismissal, too, was bizarre - a leading edge off a tentative half-pull.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116729291,imgsize-39860,width-400,resizemode-4/116729291.jpg"

Sam Konstas on Kohli altercation: 'I was doing my gloves, he accidentally bumped me'

NEW DELHI: Sam Konstas ' dazzling Test debut on Day 1 of the Boxing Day Test threw India off guard at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Thursday.With the Border-Gavaskar Trophy still up for grabs with the series locked at 1-1, the Boxing Day Test may well decide which the series will go.The teenager scored a stunning fifty on debut before Ravindra Jadeja trapped him leg before wicket.More than his runs, it was Konstas ' audacity to take on the world class Jasprit Bumrah with the new ball that had the experts singing his eulogy.Talking to Channel Seven, India pace spearhead Bumrah told how he felt like bowling to Konstas.Bumrah says in the video shared by 7Cricket, ""I have experienced heaps of it. I have played T20 cricket a lot. More than 12 years of T20 cricket. Interesting batsman as well, and I always felt I was in the game, I never felt that I am far away from a wicket. Initially I felt I could get him out 6-7 times in the first two overs, but that's how cricket goes, some days it pays off, it looks good, some days it doesn't, then you guys might be criticizing the same person. So that's how cricket is, I love different challenges and always looking forward to a new challenge.""Konstas hit Bumrah for two sixes during his knock. This was the first time in three years that Bumrah was hit for a six in Test cricket.On how playing in Australia brings the best out of him, Bumrah said, ""Yes it always brings out the best in me. I played here in my first Test tour in 2018, I made my ODI debut in 2016 here as well. It brings out a lot of challenges as well because the wickets are very flat, the Kookaburra ball does a little bit with the new ball but then doesn't do anything, so your accuracy is tested, the weather can sometimes test your fitness, you patience everything is tested. So once you come out on top, after that, it really leaves you in a very good space and you can become a better cricketer."" Steve Smith , who struck 140 in Australia's opening innings, was also hailed by Bumrah as a difficult batsman to bowl to.""He (Smith) is always been a challenge. He is unorthodox, bit like me. He is not a conventional batter, someday he is shuffling someday not, so it brings out a new challenge. He scores in different area of the ground and so you have to be consistent and bowl good balls ball after ball.""I always had good battles with him in all formats I played against him. Obviously, one of the greats of the game and in this format he is always difficult to bowl,"" he said.",Sam Konstas hit Jasprit Bumrah for two sixes during his knock.

MELBOURNE: After scoring back-to-back centuries in this series, Steve Smith is the envy of all declining batting greats right now.At 35, the batting giant has engineered the sort of late-career revival at his favourite No. 4 spot that few could have anticipated, cranking up that old run-machine everyone thought had stopped functioning.Since the 110 against England at Lord's in June 2023, Smith went into a prolonged ton drought, the longest of his career, until the hard-earned century in the Gabba Test , followed by Friday's 140 here at the MCG.So prolonged had the slump been that even with the twin tons, his average this year rises only to 36.86 from 18 innings, compared to the career 56.52. A temporary switch to the opening slot had complicated matters.On Friday, he looked at ease with himself, getting into position early, negotiating Bumrah safely, ""finding his hands,"" as he likes to say, all while retaining the extravagant back-and-across trigger movement with which he is comfortable.Throughout the past few weeks, Smith has been at it in the nets, facing throwdowns and putting more thought into the process. Smith has always been a bit obsessed with his own method, sometimes even risking going down the rabbit hole of tampering endlessly with technique, but on the first two days of the fourth Test he seemed to have found a sweet spot he would like to carry with him into next year.For a while over the past year or so, it had seemed that of this generation's Fab Four - Virat Kohli , Smith, Joe Root and Kane Williamson - Smith and Kohli would fade away the fastest. Smith has turned it around. Can Kohli too, who scored a century in Perth but has fallen off since?""You've got to have the faith,"" Smith said, ""Have a bit of trust in what you do. I've played the game for long enough now to know that you can have your ups and downs. When I wasn't scoring runs, I actually felt like I was batting pretty well. There's a difference between being out of form and out of runs. On these wickets, you need a lot of luck as well. I had my fair share (at the Gabba).""Smith also said Kohli was unlucky to get out as he did on Friday, losing his wicket at the first instance of fishing on the fifth-stump line. ""He's a class player, he played really well in Perth for that hundred,"" Smith said, ""He looked really good today. I thought he's in for a good one here. He was disciplined, leaving nicely, making the bowlers come to him a bit more, scoring well through the leg side and when we bowled short.""","Steve Smith scores back-to-back centuries in this series against India. 35-year- old has engineered a late-career revival at his favourite No. 4 spot.

NEW DELHI: The ongoing Boxing Day Test between Australia and India at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) witnessed a remarkable debut innings from 19-year-old Sam Konstas, drawing comparisons to the iconic Andrew Symonds from former Australian opener Matthew Hayden.On the 18th anniversary of Symonds' maiden Test century at the MCG against England in 2006, Hayden took to social media to reflect on the parallels between Konstas' fearless batting and Symonds' career-defining knock of 156 runs.Hayden reminisced about batting alongside his ""best mate"" Symonds during that memorable innings, which marked a turning point in the latter's Test career.“18 years ago today, I batted at the MCG with my best mate wearing our baggy green caps for Australia. He made his first Test 100! Watching @samkonstas5 yesterday was exciting, just like I felt standing and watching Simmo batting,” Hayden posted on Instagram.Konstas's debut innings of 60 off 65 balls, laced with audacious shots like reverse scoops against Jasprit Bumrah, drew comparisons to Symonds's raw power and determination.The youngster's contribution helped Australia post an imposing total of 474 in their first innings, becoming the youngest Australian in over 70 years to score a fifty-plus score on debut against India.In response, India's innings got off to a shaky start, with captain Rohit Sharma dismissed cheaply for 3, continuing his poor form in the series. KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal steadied the ship with a patient partnership, but a mix-up between Jaiswal and Virat Kohli resulted in Jaiswal's run-out for 82, triggering a collapse.Kohli, visibly unsettled, fell soon after for 32, while nightwatchman Akash Deep was also dismissed, leaving India reeling at 156/5 by stumps on Day 2.The visitors now face an uphill task, trailing by 310 runs, with Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja unbeaten overnight and tasked with leading India's fightback on Day 3.","Sam Konstas' debut innings drew comparisons to Andrew Symonds' career-defining knock of 156 runs against England in 2006.

NEW DELHI: Corbin Bosch made an impressive unbeaten 81 while Marco Jansen secured two crucial wickets, putting South Africa in a commanding position during the second day of the first Test against Pakistan at SuperSport Park in Centurion on Friday.Batting at number nine, Bosch helped South Africa establish a 90-run first innings advantage. The bowlers capitalised on this lead by claiming three Pakistani wickets before the deficit could be erased.Pakistan concluded the day at 88 for three, trailing by two runs. A South African victory in either match of this two-Test series would secure their maiden World Test Championship final appearance next year.The match was balanced when Aiden Markram departed for 89, leaving South Africa at 213 for eight, marginally ahead of Pakistan's 211. Naseem Shah 's intense bowling spell yielded three wickets as South Africa lost four wickets for 35 runs around lunch.Bosch, maintaining a first-class batting average exceeding 40, played freely whilst partnering with Kagiso Rabada (13) and Dane Paterson (12), transforming a slim advantage into a significant lead. His 93-ball innings included 15 boundaries.The 30-year-old's outstanding debut continued, following his first-innings figures of four for 63, where he recorded the match's fastest delivery at 147kmh.Bosch, whose Test cricketer father Tertius passed away when he was five, initially wasn't considered a primary fast-bowling option this season.However, injuries to senior players and his recent performances earned him selection.Although Bosch shared the new ball with Rabada, he remained wicketless in his three-over spell before leaving the field.The Pakistani opening pair of Saim Ayub and Shan Masood each scored 28, establishing a 49-run partnership before Rabada bowled Ayub.

NEW DELHI: Fresh off an extraordinary domestic season in England, David Payne , the left-arm swing and seam sensation, is poised to make his mark with the Desert Vipers in the upcoming ILT20 .For Payne, the tournament isn’t just about team success; it’s a critical platform to reignite his international career.Speaking on the Vipers Voices podcast, Payne shared his ambitions: “The ILT20 is the perfect stage for me to keep pushing my case (to play for England). The standard of this competition is such that if I can perform well, it will be my way of knocking on the door for England and saying, ‘I am still here.’ It is the perfect showcase to try and get my name back in the fold.”Payne’s impressive run in the 2024 T20 Blast led Gloucestershire to a remarkable title win.His haul of 33 wickets in 17 matches was instrumental in their success. Reflecting on this milestone, he said, “It was a pretty special summer for myself and the team and I put a large part of it down to it being the first summer that I was purely just a white-ball player. Previous to that I played all formats and it takes a lot out of you. Normally going into the Blast season I would have played six or seven red-ball games, bowled hundreds of overs and been pretty fatigued already from the first couple of months of the season.“Being able to go into the Blast campaign feeling really fresh and motivated really did, I think, play a huge part in the success that I had. My body and my mind were a lot fresher. I think it was the first time I entered a Blast campaign being able to give it absolutely 100 per cent of my ability. I was in a great mindset and physical space and everything clicked.”His performances in the Blast catapulted him to third on the all-time wicket-takers list for the tournament, with 193 scalps.“That stat kind of crept up on me last season,” he admitted. “It is something I am very proud of. My focus has always been on evolving as a bowler because staying ahead in the cat-and-mouse game with batters is crucial.”Having honed his skills in the Abu Dhabi T10, Payne is confident in adapting to UAE pitches. “The T10 was a great warm-up, a great introduction to the ILT20 for me,” he noted. “To see the conditions in Abu Dhabi was incredibly useful. The pitches were good, pretty batter-friendly, and it has given me a lot of learnings to take into January.”Payne is optimistic about the Desert Vipers’ prospects. ""(With the Desert Vipers) I would be amazed if we were not up there and challenging for the title this season. I love the bowling group we have got together and I love the fact we have gone left-arm heavy as I think that is going to be such a point of difference. It is attacking and something batters will not have faced too much of,"" he added.“I also think we have such a strong breadth of batting in terms of covering all bases with power and with touch. I just think it is a well-rounded squad that in my eyes should really be competing for the title.""The Vipers kick off their campaign against the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders on day two (January 12) of the tournament, and Payne is ready to spearhead their charge—and potentially his England comeback.",David Payne is poised to make his mark with the Desert Vipers in the upcoming ILT20.
