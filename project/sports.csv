As the entire WWE Universe is currently reeling with the sudden demise of WWE legend and Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan, amidst the sadness, a WWE legend has reportedly blamed Hogan’s close friends for covering his health issues. WWE icon Hulk Hogan passed away on July 24, 2025, due to cardiac arrest at his Clearwater residence in Florida. Despite immediate medical attention, Hogan could not be revived.Hulk Hogan’s unfortunate death has left everyone in shock. Amidst this tough time, one of his closest allies has accused Hogan’s close friends of allegedly keeping fans in the dark. Bubba the Love Sponge, who was a longtime friend of Hogan, says people in Hogan’s circle knew for a while that things were going downhill for him, but still they chose to remain silent.American radio personality and Hulk Hogan ’s closest ally, Bubba the Love Sponge , has reportedly blamed Hulk Hogan’s friends for covering up and not disclosing his health issues. Bubba has spoken about it recently in a podcast.Speaking on hist, Bubba revealed how frustrated he was that the truth wasn’t shared with the public before Hogan’s passing. During the podcast, he said, “I think the Hogan people really made a mistake if they just would have told the truth.It would have completely debunked me. I mean, it takes all my bullets away with regards to having a scoop on something that I know they’re lying about.”He even went on to explain that even a simple public statement about Hogan’s post-surgery struggles could have changed the conversation, but instead, fans were misled. Bubba further added,If they would have said, ‘Yeah, you know what? Hogan’s not doing so good right now. He’s having complications from a neck and back surgery. We’re very concerned. Please pray for Hulk.’ None of that. It was always, you know, ‘He’s doing good. He’s doing strong. Day by day, we’re good.’ I mean, Jimmy Hart alluded to the fact that they were at karaoke on Monday.”Bubba also mentioned a moment where Hogan’s declining health was visible to anyone paying attention, pointing to a TV appearance that made things clear about his deteriorating health.He added, “That and along with Seth—remember when we watched Bischoff this past week and he was re-promoting on Fox and Friends that they had just signed a deal with Fox Nation? And remember when I said, just look how tired and sad he looks? Yes. They knew. They’ve known for a long time that he wasn’t going to make it. And unfortunately, that turned out to be the case.”Following the sudden demise of Hulk Hogan, several wrestling figures have poured their heartfelt tribute to the wrestling legend, including WWE Chief Content Officer, Triple H . The WWE chief took to his social media and posted a heartfelt tribute to Hogan and prayed for the departed soul.Taking to his X/Twitter account, he wrote, “WWE would not be where it is today without the larger-than-life characters that compete in the ring … and few, if any, loomed larger than Terry “Hulk Hogan” Bollea.”Sharing his in-ring memories with Hulk Hogan, Triple H further shared, “He was the archetype of what it meant to be a 'Superstar' - a global sensation that inspired millions to work hard at whatever it was they wanted to accomplish and a look that made him recognizable to fans around the world.”He further stated, “Hulk Hogan, clad in red and yellow or nWo black and white, was simply put, iconic. As a Real American or the leader of one of the industry’s biggest factions, he transcended and elevated the entire business to heights never before seen - in every country and on every continent.”There was no one like The Hulkster, and there very well may never be another. My family sends their condolences to his family, friends, and fans, he added. Further, WWE paid a tribute to the legend last Friday on SmackDown’s 25th July, 2025 edition.","American radio personality and Hulk Hogan ’s closest ally, Bubba the Love Sponge, has reportedly blamed Hogan’s friends for covering up and not disclosing his health issues.

President Donald Trump accused of cheating while golfing with NFL legends during Scotland visit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/president-donald-trump-accused-of-cheating-while-golfing-with-nfl-legends-during-scotland-visit/articleshow/122956942.cms,"President Trump accused of cheating in golf match (Reuters)

Trump’s golf game with NFL legends turns controversial over fresh cheating allegations



The “Commander in Cheat” nickname resurfaces



FAQs:



1. Why is Donald Trump being accused of cheating at golf again?

2. What did Mike Tirico say about Trump cheating in golf?

3. Has Trump faced golf cheating allegations before?

A viral video has reignited controversy around U.S. President Donald Trump - this time, not for politics, but for golf. Over the weekend in Scotland, Trump was captured playing at his iconic Trump Turnberry course, but what caught social media's attention wasn’t his swing. It was a suspicious moment involving his caddie that stirred familiar accusations: is Trump once again bending the rules of the game?Trump’s time on the links has often made headlines, and not just for his signature red cap or presidential swagger. This weekend’s footage, which appears to show his caddie discreetly placing a ball on the fairway, has fueled fresh claims of dishonesty during play. While it’s possible the caddie was simply replacing a lost ball, online viewers aren’t buying it. The internet, it seems, never forgets.These recent visuals echo a now-famous incident recounted by NBC sportscaster Mike Tirico, who once played a round with Trump, Jon Gruden, and Ron Jaworski. Tirico recalled hitting a “blind shot into the green”—a 3-wood that he described as the “best 3-wood of his life.” The ball appeared destined for the pin. But what followed raised eyebrows.“Lousy break,” Trump said as Tirico searched for the ball, which mysteriously ended up in a greenside bunker some 50 yards from its likely landing spot.Tirico took two attempts to escape the trap and carded a 7.Only later did the truth emerge. Tirico shared, “Afterwards, Trump’s caddy came up to me and said, ‘You know that shot you hit on the par 5? It was about 10 feet from the hole. Trump threw it into the bunker. I watched him do it.’”What did Tirico do? True to the casual camaraderie of the day, he “laughed, shook his head, went inside, and paid Trump his money.” But it left a lasting impression.Trump’s love for golf is no secret—nor are the persistent allegations that he plays fast and loose with its rules. Veteran journalist Rick Reilly even coined the nickname “Commander in Cheat” to describe Trump’s history of questionable golf etiquette.With this weekend’s viral footage, the label once again feels relevant. Whether it’s competitive instinct, playful mischief, or something else entirely, Trump’s golfing antics continue to blur the lines between gamesmanship and gamesmanship gone too far. For critics, it's more fuel for the fire. For fans, perhaps just another chapter in a larger-than-life personality. Either way, the clip serves as a vivid reminder: when Trump hits the course, controversy isn't far behind.A viral video from Scotland appears to show Trump's caddie discreetly improving his lie during a round.Mike Tirico claimed Trump once threw his ball into a bunker during a round with NFL legends, calling it a “lousy break.”Yes, Trump has long been accused of bending the rules on the course, earning him the nickname “Commander in Cheat.”Also Read: Taylor Swift’s classy clapback to Matty Healy’s mom earns praise as she leans on Travis Kelce for support","A viral video has reignited controversy around U.S. President Donald Trump.

After a whirlwind summer filled with international travel and celebrity encounters, Tom Brady is back home in sunny Miami—and already turning the spotlight to someone else: his kids. The seven-time Super Bowl champion, now settled post-retirement, took to social media recently to boast about his 15-year-old son Benjamin’s impressive dunking skills. In true Brady fashion, the post wasn’t just a proud dad moment—it was a nudge to his alma mater. “He got game 100 [percent],” Brady wrote on his Instagram story. “Future Wolverine @umichbball.”It’s no secret that Tom Brady takes immense pride in his kids. While Benjamin might have inherited his dad’s height and athletic build, his interests stretch far beyond the field. Though he’s shown flashes of talent in football and basketball, he’s also a budding musician and artist. Brady once candidly recalled a moment with his then-wife Gisele Bündchen that shaped his parenting approach: “I was like, 'C'mon, let's do this. ' And he was like, 'Nope.' And I was like, 'What? No, do this!'. And Gisele kept saying to me, 'Would you effing understand that your son is different?’”The legendary quarterback admitted that this conversation was a turning point in learning to embrace his children’s unique paths.Still, Benjamin did surprise his father last year by saying he wanted to give football a shot. “My son is gonna play football this year, Benny,” Brady shared on a SiriusXM show. “He’s an amazing kid and he’s got a lot of talents. He’s a really talented musician and artist. And then he told me this year, ‘Dad, I’m playing football. ’” His dream? To be a tight end like Rob Gronkowski. “He was like, ‘Tight end. I wanna be like Gronk!’” Brady said, adding that he even passed the message to his longtime teammate: “‘My boy wants to be like you!’ And he loved it.”Brady’s oldest son Jack, 17, whom he shares with actress Bridget Moynahan, is another rising star in his own right. Whether it’s playing football or shooting hoops, Jack’s bond with his father has been endearing to fans. From viral golfing moments—“Love this boy, not sure about this game”—to courtside selfies captioned “Luckiest Dad in the world,” their connection feels authentic and deep.In a 2022 podcast with Larry Fitzgerald and Jim Gray, Brady glowed while speaking of Jack’s football journey. “I think one of the great highlights of my life is watching him play and him grow and develop... He’s way smarter. He’s got a great work ethic. He’s just a great kid. But I can definitely help him at quarterback.”As for whether either of his sons will ever follow his NFL path or blaze a trail in basketball, only time will tell. But one thing is clear—Tom Brady will be there on the sidelines, cheering the loudest.Tom Brady has three children—Jack, Benjamin, and Vivian—with two different women.Bridget Moynahan is the mother of his son Jack, while Gisele Bündchen is the mother of Benjamin and Vivian.Yes, both Jack and Benjamin have shown interest in sports, with Jack playing football and Benjamin dabbling in basketball and football.Also Read: Ciara stuns in jean shorts and Giants gear, effortlessly outshining Russell Wilson at training camp","Tom Brady has three children—Jack, Benjamin, and Vivian—with two different women.

Josh Allen’s MVP shine fades as fantasy football experts and Hailee Steinfeld question his real value,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/josh-allens-mvp-shine-fades-as-fantasy-football-experts-and-hailee-steinfeld-question-his-real-value/articleshow/122952837.cms,"Despite Josh Allen's MVP season and 40 total touchdowns, fantasy football analysts are questioning his early draft value (Imagn Images)

Hailee Steinfeld stirs the pot as fantasy concerns grow around Josh Allen’s draft value

Quarterbacks face declining fantasy worth as scoring systems evolve



FAQs

1. Why is Josh Allen’s fantasy football value being questioned?

2. What did Hailee Steinfeld say about Josh Allen and fantasy football?



3. Is Josh Allen still a good pick in fantasy football?



Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen may be the reigning NFL MVP, but his fantasy football stock isn’t exactly matching the hype. While fans in Buffalo still celebrate his electric 2024 season—which featured 40 total touchdowns—some fantasy analysts believe selecting Allen early in fantasy drafts could be a costly mistake, especially when considering other positional values.Interestingly, even Allen’s off-field life is catching attention. Pop star Hailee Steinfeld, Allen’s high-profile wife, has reportedly teased him over his fantasy value. While her comments remain lighthearted, they echo what many in the fantasy community are seriously debating—whether Allen is worth an early-round pick anymore.Fantasy analyst Gary Davenport of Bleacher Report added weight to this conversation by stating: “For starters, although Allen played very well last year, three quarterbacks scored more fantasy points. Also, even if the first quarterback drafted in fantasy actually finishes in that spot (which almost never happens), the edge gained by fantasy managers isn't worth the hole that taking a signal-caller this early creates at running back or wide receiver. ”The fantasy football landscape has changed in recent years. Quarterbacks no longer receive six points for passing touchdowns in most leagues, which levels the playing field and increases the risk of picking them too early.Running backs and wide receivers, due to positional scarcity and depth concerns, now offer more weekly upside—especially in PPR formats.Davenport explained this dynamic clearly: “The gap between the No. 1 quarterback (Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens) and the No. 12 quarterback in fantasy points per game (Bo Nix of the Denver Broncos) last year was 6.8 points—a smaller gap than between the 'best' and 'worst' weekly starters in the backfield and at wideout.""While Allen remains a fan-favorite and a dynamic leader for the Bills, fantasy football players may want to reconsider drafting him too early. Flashy stats and MVP trophies aside, success in fantasy leagues often comes down to smart value—not star power.Also Read: Matty Healy's mother thrashed Taylor Swift for her lyrics as Travis Kelce hard launches their relationship on Instagram Despite his MVP season, analysts say other quarterbacks outscored him and his early draft cost outweighs his fantasy return.Hailee Steinfeld reportedly joked about Allen’s fantasy value, adding fuel to ongoing concerns about drafting him too early.He’s a strong quarterback, but experts warn that drafting him early may hurt overall roster depth compared to RBs and WRs.","Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen may be the reigning NFL MVP, but his fantasy football stock isn’t exactly matching the hype.

J.J. McCarthy went around Vikings' facility to sign jerseys and talk to fans

A lot is riding on J.J. McCarthy this season. The first-round pick of the 2024 NFL Draft can be pegged as the face of the season, especially after Sam Darnold’s exit. And McCarthy is starting the season on the right foot by making his fans happy! The QB went around the Vikings' facility on a sweltering day just to make fans happy.The Minnesota Vikings' camp is being held in Eagan, Minnesota, and McCarthy spent hours going around the facility to talk to fans and listen to their requests. In a video shared on social media, McCarthy can be seen wearing a red jersey right outside the facility, interacting with fans who were standing on the overhead bridge and taking jerseys and gear from them to sign. Fans on X praised his commitment to his fans, especially since it was a humid day and McCarthy spent quite a long time outside in the heat just for his fans.Although fans and top brass have shown their trust in McCarthy, he is yet to win over all his teammates, it might seem. Recently, Vikings’ wide receiver, Justin Jefferson was asked about McCarthy and he was actually slammed by fans for his underwhelming response.“He’s pretty much a rookie,” he said. “Last year pretty much doesn’t count for him. He’s still new to the scheme… You have to have that patience. You’re not really expecting him to have the same mindset as a veteran.You can’t really have that expectation from him.”It goes without saying that the Vikings have an interesting year ahead after their roster change. They did not sign Aaron Rodgers, let Sam Darnold walk away, and also split with Nick Mullens and Daniel Jones. It has become evident that Vikings consider McCarthy a long-time asset.McCarthy was unable to play in his rookie season because of a torn meniscus in his right knee. But he did show enough development to make it to 2025 training camp as the Vikings' expected starting quarterback.A few days ago, Minnesota Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell talked about a meeting he had with McCarthy to discuss future strategies. As per reports, they spent an hour meeting one-on-one in O'Connell's office.""The one thing I learned about him in those meetings is that he had great questions, and that validated that he was receiving and getting something out of that time. And as I've told him, it doesn't really guarantee you anything, but once you're fighting the fight on a daily basis of growing within the system, he would be able to rely on some of what we did together,” O’Connell said.",J.J.

Why Edgecombe Stands Out

Theturned heads at the 2025 NBA Draft by selectingwith the No. 3 overall pick, and the buzz surrounding the rookie intensified when All-Star Paul George showered the young guard with praise. As the Sixers look to reshape their roster, Edgecombe is quickly emerging as a potential cornerstone of the franchise’s future.Before landing in Philadelphia, VJ Edgecombe made waves at Baylor University, where he earned Big 12 Freshman of the Year honors in the 2024-25 season. He averaged 15 points, 5.6 rebounds, 3.2 assists, and 2.1 steals per game, setting a new freshman record for steals at the school. His blend of scoring, defense, and athleticism positioned him as one of the most complete prospects in the draft.Scouts lauded his high motor and defensive tenacity, while executives took note of his maturity and professionalism - qualities that made him a perfect fit for a Sixers team hungry for young talent with immediate impact. Paul George didn’t hold back his admiration for VJ Edgecombe during a recent episode of his podcast. “We know who we’re taking. VJ’s our guy. Great kid, works hard. You got the resume. The footage backs up everything,” George said, underlining the team’s confidence in their selection.Following Edgecombe’s electrifying summer league debut—28 points, 10 rebounds, 4 assists, 2 blocks, and a steal - Paul George compared his game to a young Jimmy Butler. “He has that competitive edge. Watching him felt like observing a young Jimmy… that same mid-range aggressiveness,” he said. The comparison to Butler - a former Sixer and two-way star—highlighted the expectations surrounding Edgecombe’s development.VJ Edgecombe admitted he was caught off guard by the Sixers ’ pick, recalling, “I didn’t know till like 15 seconds before they called my name… I’m really going to Philly now.” Now, he looks forward to growing under the guidance of veterans like Paul George, Joel Embiid, and Tyrese Maxey, soaking up knowledge and embracing the challenge ahead.Edgecombe joins a promising young core in Philadelphia, alongside Tyrese Maxey and fellow rookie Jared McCain. With the team navigating injury concerns around stars like Embiid and George, the emergence of young, dynamic players could define the next phase of Sixers basketball.George’s presence adds value not just on the court but as a mentor. His vocal support for Edgecombe speaks volumes about the rookie’s potential, and his comparisons to high-character, high-impact players signal the franchise’s long-term vision.VJ Edgecombe’s selection wasn’t just about his stats - it was about his mindset. The Sixers front office praised his competitiveness, especially his refusal to let opponents score easily. That intensity, paired with his physical tools, could solve some of the team’s defensive struggles from last season.Draft analysts gave Philadelphia a respectable “B” grade for their draft class, citing Edgecombe as a great match for the team’s current needs with All-Star potential down the road.With the season fast approaching, Sixers fans are buzzing with optimism. Paul George’s high praise isn’t just lip service - it’s a sign that Edgecombe has already earned the respect of one of the league’s most respected veterans.

DeAndre Ayton left his companion stranded on an island

DeAndre Ayton recently joined Los Angeles Lakers from Portland Trail Blazers

What could have been a chill summer outing turned horrendous when an Instagram model was left stranded on an island. Or at least that's what the rumors say. Los Angeles Lakers center, DeAndre Ayton, allegedly went on a trip to Turks & Caicos with said model, and then allegedly had his security kick her out when she refused his advances to have s*x with him. Ayton has not responded to any of the allegations yet, but if this is true, his upcoming journey with the Lakers could get into some hot water.DeAndre Ayton and an Instagram model with the handle caribbeancurlss allegedly went on a trip to Turks & Caicos this summer, before the league starts back up in October. Whether they went there together or met up at the island has not been revealed, but according to the model, after she refused Ayton's advances to have s*x with him, he had his security kick her out and left her stranded all by herself.She wasn't going to just let him get away with it and revealed all about her experience with the newest Los Angeles Lakers star on her socials. She posted a story on her Instagram on Sunday, writing, “@deandreayton security Left me outside in the middle of nowhere in Turks of Caicos bc I won’t have have sex with him.”Whether she was able to get back home or is still staying on the islands is unknown. And given Ayton has been keeping mum on the situation only makes it seem like he was in the wrong, and she is telling the truth.Fans are also pointing out that the reason he flew her to the islands was because he was promised something in return, but things turned sour, and he left her. Whatever the reason, stranding someone was probably not the way to go.After a mediocre season with the Portland Trail Blazers, DeAndre Ayton has made his way to the Los Angeles Lakers, where he will be taking the center position for the upcoming season. Playing with the likes of Luka Doncic and LeBron James will, of course, be a highlight for any player, and Ayton is no different, who was the No. 1 pick of the 2018 draft by the Phoenix Suns.But after his recent situation, fans are using a looking glass to get a better view of him. Ayton reached a buyout after the 2024-25 season with the Portland Trail Blazers ahead of free agency and signed a two-year deal with the Lakers for $16 million. But rumor has it that the Trail Blazers' decided to buy out his contract after the team grew tired of his conduct. Now with the recent accusations, things are not looking too good for the Bahamian player.Also Read: DeAndre Ayton's $16.2M deal with Los Angeles Lakers praised as one of the top offseason signings of 2025","DeAndre Ayton and an Instagram model allegedly went on a trip to Turks & Caicos this summer, before the league starts back up in October.

From Undrafted to Signed: Dixon’s Unusual Path

What’s Next for Dixon?

In a move to strengthen their depth ahead of the 2025-26 NBA season, thehave officially signed 6-foot-8 forward- Villanova’s all-time leading scorer. The team also welcomed three other notable players: RJ Davis, Arthur Kaluma, and Augustas Marčiulionis. The signings come as the Lakers prepare for training camp and continue shaping a roster that aims to support stars like LeBron James and newly-acquired Luka Doncic The Los Angeles Lakers confirmed the signings via a press release on Saturday, stating: “The Los Angeles Lakers have signed guard RJ Davis, forward Eric Dixon, forward Arthur Kaluma, and guard Augustas Marčiulionis.”Among the four additions, Eric Dixon stands out for his prolific college scoring career at Villanova University. Despite not being selected in the 2025 NBA Draft, Dixon agreed to terms with the Los Angeles Lakers in late June. Until recently, his status remained uncertain due to a foot injury.Dixon’s senior season stats are a testament to his scoring prowess:• Points per game: 23.3 (led the NCAA)• Field goal percentage: 45.1%• Three-point percentage: 40.7%• Rebounds: 5.1 per game• Assists: 1.9 per gameThese numbers helped him earn All-Big East First Team honors in 2024-25. His consistent performance over five seasons also earned him two All-Big East Second Team selections in earlier years.He played a program-record 162 career games, starting 141 of them, and averaged:• 14.3 points• 5.6 rebounds• 1.4 assistsover 27.5 minutes per game.Dixon’s scoring total of 2,314 points makes him the highest scorer in Villanova history - a remarkable feat for any college player.Though Dixon agreed to a deal in late June, his official signing was delayed, raising questions among fans. Trevor Lane of Lakers Nation cleared the air by saying: “There are tweets and stuff with Shams Charania saying he agreed to a contract with the Lakers, but that’s different than actually signing with the Los Angeles Lakers.”Despite missing Summer League action due to his foot injury, Dixon ultimately secured his spot with the team shortly after Lane’s remarks were published. His ability to thrive as a pick-and-pop specialist and execute strong downhill drives gives the Los Angeles Lakers a versatile offensive option with room to grow.While Dixon is expected to start his professional journey in the NBA G-League, his offensive versatility and scoring pedigree make him a player to watch. His transition from college star to pro prospect might take time, but he brings a valuable toolkit to a Lakers team focused on development and depth.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers Bring in Four Undrafted Rookies on Exhibit 10 Deals Ahead of 2025-26 Season The Los Angeles Lakers’ latest signings reflect a commitment to balancing experience with youthful upside.

Ryne Sandberg, aka Ryno , passes away at 65



Ryne Sandberg was a fighter on and off the court



FAQs

What was Ryne Sandberg’s cause of death?

How many years did Sandberg play in the MLB?

When was Sandberg inducted into the Hall of Fame?

Ryne Sandberg, one of baseball’s most respected second basemen and a beloved Chicago Cubs icon, passed away on July 28 at the age of 65 after a valiant fight with metastatic prostate cancer. He was revered for both his stellar career and quiet leadership. Sandberg leaves behind an indelible legacy not just in Chicago but across the entire baseball world.Known affectionately as “Ryno,” Sandberg became the heart and soul of the Cubs for over a decade and a half. Originally drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in 1978, he arrived in Chicago through a now-legendary trade in 1982, and it changed the franchise’s fortunes.In his rookie season, Sandberg flashed his potential by hitting .271 with 32 stolen bases. But it was the 1984 campaign that truly launched him into stardom. He batted .314, led the National League in runs and triples, and captured the NL MVP award. That same year, he authored one of the most iconic games in Cubs history — the ""Sandberg Game"" — where he blasted two game-tying homers against Hall of Famer Bruce Sutter in a dramatic 12-11 win over the Cardinals.""Ryne Sandberg was a hero to a generation of Chicago Cubs fans,"" said Cubs executive chairman Tom Ricketts. ""His dedication to and respect for the game, along with his unrelenting integrity, grit, hustle, and competitive fire were hallmarks of his career.""Sandberg's career accolades are as impressive as his work ethic: 10 All-Star selections, nine Gold Gloves, seven Silver Sluggers, 282 home runs, 2,386 hits, and a .285 lifetime average. He also held the record for most home runs by a second baseman at the time of his retirement in 1997.In 2005, Sandberg was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. His induction speech was a masterclass in humility and sportsmanship:“I was taught you never, ever disrespect your opponent or your teammates or your organization or your manager — and never, ever your uniform,” he said. “Because the name on the front is a lot more important than the name on the back.”Off the diamond, Sandberg remained close to the game. He coached in the Cubs and Phillies systems, managed the Phillies from 2013–2015, and later served as a Cubs ambassador.In January 2024, he revealed his cancer diagnosis. By August, he was declared cancer-free, only to face a heartbreaking relapse later that year. Yet, Sandberg continued to inspire. In February 2025, he made an emotional appearance at Cubs Spring Training, where Manager Craig Counsell said,""People like Ryno... make an impact like when they step in the room — and that’s what Ryno has done for us already.""His statue outside Wrigley, unveiled on the 40th anniversary of his signature game, now stands as a reminder to the man who played the game the right way and lived the same way, even in the face of his toughest battle.He died from complications related to metastatic prostate cancer.Sandberg played 16 MLB seasons, primarily with the Chicago Cubs.He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2005.Also Read: Hall of Fame boxer ‘Camden Buzzsaw’ Dwight Muhammad Qawi dies at age 72","Ryne Sandberg, aka Ryno, passed away on July 28 at the age of 65.

Dale Steyn on X (Screengrab)

Poll Do you agree with Dale Steyn's view that an early handshake should have been offered? Yes, it's the gentlemanly thing to do. No, it's not necessary in this context.

The fourth Test between India and England at Old Trafford ended in a gripping draw, but not without drama in the final hour. As the match moved beyond any realistic result, England captain Ben Stokes and Harry Brook offered to end the game early on mutual agreement. However, Indian batters Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar chose to continue batting in pursuit of their centuries.Following the game, rumours circulated suggesting that Stokes refused to shake hands with Jadeja after the match ended. While that claim has been debunked, the moment has sparked contrasting opinions from former cricketers.Among those adding their voice to the debate is former South Africa pacer Dale Steyn . In a detailed post on X, Steyn acknowledged the complexity of the situation, writing, ""This onion has many layers to it, and each one will make someone cry.""He continued, ""The only issue I see here is the one thing people aren’t realizing, the batters weren’t playing for 100s, they were batting for a DRAW. That was the goal. Draw the game.""Steyn explained that once the draw was assured and a result was out of the question, accepting a handshake would have been the sportsmanlike thing to do. ""Once that was accomplished, and a result was out of the question, a handshake was offered. That’s the gentlemanly thing to do right?""He added, ""It’s not then the time to realize they safe and now say no we’d prefer some free milestones… although within the rules, just seems a little, well, odd.""Despite this, Steyn did credit the Indian batters for their performance. ""That said, they did bat well, and maybe with the last hour approaching they should have been more aggressive in reaching those milestones. At least then, we could all agree, no team tried to outdo the other in this weird situation.""The final Test at The Oval now promises to be a charged decider, with both teams and fanbases fired up. India will look to pull off a win in the final Test while the hosts will look to seal the series in fashion with a win on the Test starting July 31.","England and India drew the fourth Test at Old Trafford on Monday.

Her companion through it all was a banana.

The board as Divya Deshmukh became the first Indian to win the Women's Chess World Cup.

NEW DELHI: In Batumi, Georgia, the final handshake left nineteen-year-old Divya Deshmukh full of raw emotions and tears — not just for the game she had just won, but for what it meant: India, for the first time ever, had a Women’s World Cup chess champion — her closest companion in that moment were not her parents, coach or a fan, but a humble banana.Yes, a banana, untouched through the tension and triumph, now turned into the most unassuming witness to one of Indian chess’s most glorious days.In chess, White pieces traditionally hold the advantage by virtue of the first move.But Divya had the black pieces, going into the decider of Monday’s rapid tie-break against thirty-eight-year-old legendary Grandmaster (GM) Koneru Humpy, after all three previous classical and rapid games had ended in draws.The game teetered delicately, move after move, until Humpy cracked under the time pressure on move 40.Her sequence, 40.e4 followed by 41.d5, forced Divya to play 42...cxd5, and the veteran survived the first time. But it was not the last.The game stayed on a knife’s edge from there, with both players trading blunders and brilliance, led more by instinct than calculation as the clock ticked menacingly.When Humpy played 69.h7, the evaluation bar dropped again but never climbed back in her favour.Six moves later, the two-time World Rapid champion resigned. And with it came the coronation of a champion, a new queen of 64 squares, India's 88th GM.It felt like a dream that the 15th-seed teenager, with no Grandmaster norms coming into the tournament, had just become only the fourth female in India after Humpy, D Harika, and R Vaishali to achieve the distinction. But unlike the other three, she did it in one swing, without amassing the three GM norms.The playing hall rose in applause. But there, quietly soaking up all the drama, sat the banana, an omnipresent figure in Divya's games these days.It had followed the Indian prodigy through round after round, a prop that puzzled many and amused more.Let’s rewind to Sunday evening, after the draw in the second classical game of the final, Divya was eventually asked about it. “I mean, what else am I going to do with the banana? I'm going to eat it,” she answered. “I don't know what you're wondering about. I'm going to eat it, obviously.”Except, she never did.“My opponents are never letting me eat it,” she smiled, when pressed further. “If I start eating a banana, then you should know that I’m pretty relaxed in my body.”But since there was no room for relaxation, the banana became her constant in the chaos.When asked if it was proving lucky, she laughed it off with a quick “No!” But then again, we’ve all seen Rafael Nadal fuss over his water bottles and MS Dhoni with his glove rituals.Nevertheless, the banana sat just centimetres away, enjoyed the best view as Divya took down a player twice her age, earning the admiration of legends and the love of a 150-crore-strong nation.And now, while Divya may not have bitten into that, she has something far sweeter to sink her teeth into: a gold medal.Divya Deshmukh survived Batumi. So did the banana.","Divya Deshmukh beat Koneru Humpy to become the FIDE Women's Chess World Cup in Georgia. Her companion through it all was a banana.

Legendary England cricket Geoffrey Boycott has slammed Ben Stokes and his team for showing the poor sportsmanship on the final day of the Manchester Test.Drama erupted at the start of the final hour of the match on Sunday when home skipper Ben Stokes offered to shake hands with Indian batters, realising that an outright result was not possible.Jadeja and Washington batting on 89 and 80 respectively refused the offer, leaving the England captain frustrated. Stokes later said that he made the offer since he didn't want to risk injury to his fatigued frontline bowlers.""There is no way I would have let anyone drag me off on 89 after I had worked hard all day to save the game for my team,"" Geoffrey Boycott wrote in his column for The Telegraph.""Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar deserved their hundreds. They left the ball well, played with the full face of the bat and defended their wickets at all costs. Well done.""I’m not sure what it is with modern players. You hear a lot of them mouthing off. It never really happened when I was playing. It will carry on at the Oval and India will go there thinking they got a win at Old Trafford.""You learn more from failure than you do from success.

Sunil Gavaskar

The Stokes-Jadeja controversy towards the end of the fourth Test at Manchester has led to a fierce online debate. But far worse happened in the 1983 Bangalore Test against Pakistan when skipper Zaheer Abbas had arbitrarily left the field with his team on the last day leaving opener Sunil Gavaskar stranded on 86.The TOI reported that play was interrupted for 27 minutes while Sandeep Patil wrote in his autobiography, 'Sandy Storm', that “half an hour” was wasted. Gavaskar, who was suffering from “bronchial infection” for the previous two days, his opening partner Anshuman Gaekwad and the two umpires, Madhav Gothoskar and Swaroop Kishen, stayed on the ground during this period.In his book, 'Runs ’n Ruins', Gavaskar vividly recreated the scene at the stadium. “The crowd was getting restive and impatient and had begun to boo and shout a little angrily now. The officials of the Karnataka State Cricket Association rushed to confer with both the umpires as well as the manager of the Pakistan team, Intikhab Alam.”The Times of India report detailed what had led to the Pakistan team’s exit. “Zaheer’s contention was that Pakistan had completed their quota of 77 overs for the day…. There was a great deal of wrangling over the rules before wiser counsels prevailed on Zaheer and manager Intikhab Alam…He (Zaheer) relented when the umpires pointed out that that the stipulation of 14 overs per hour in the playing condition did not apply for the last day when the mandatory overs had to be gone through,” the report said.Interestingly, the report also said that the umpires had clearly explained the law to Zaheer, fondly called Zed, in the morning. “He perhaps saw the light when it was made clear to him that the match would be awarded to India if his team did not return to the field, England captain (Ray) Illingworth had acted similarly on the tour of Australia and had to bring his team back,” TOI said. The newspaper added, ""a potentially explosive situation was thus defused. ""Despite the loss of considerable time, the light was good enough for the game to resume. “After this kind of drama one gets disturbed, especially a batsman. But Sunil, without any problem, completed his hundred,” wrote Patil. Gavaskar's description went, “When play finally did start, I managed to get to my century in the 20th (mandatory) over. As the ball streaked to the boundary, I glanced at Zaheer and he was already walking towards the pavilion along with his players and we followed. ” It was Sunny's 28th Test ton, leaving him one short of Don Bradman’s record 29 centuries. Gavaskar ended with 34 Test centuries.All-rounder Madan Lal, who was awarded MoM in that game, told TOI over phone that it was the right decision and within the rules to call the Pakistan team back. “A batsman works hard to reach a century. Why shouldn’t he be allowed to complete it?,” he asked.Not everyone in the Pakistan team condoned Zaheer’s action. “The walk-off by Zaheer had left a bad taste in the mouth and later in the evening on the flight to Delhi some of his players were critical of his actions, which they felt was unnecessary and unsporting,” Gavaskar said.For the record, the Test ended in a tame draw.","Sunil Gavaskar was stranded on 86 in the 1983 Bangalore Test against Pakistan.

India stay alive, England frustrated after draw; handshake drama at Old Trafford and more

NEW DELHI: Ravindra Jadeja has etched his name into cricketing folklore by equalling an iconic record held by the legendary Sir Garfield Sobers. On Day 5 of the fourth Test at Old Trafford, the Indian all-rounder brought up his fifth 50-plus score of the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy 2025, matching Sobers' 1966 record for the most 50+ scores at No.6 or lower in a Test series in England.Both Jadeja and Sobers achieved the feat in eight innings, underlining the consistency and impact of the Indian all-rounder in the lower-middle order. Jadeja’s performance has now firmly placed him alongside the West Indian great in multiple elite lists.Jadeja also became the joint-most prolific visiting batter in England with nine fifty-plus scores at No.6 or lower — a record he now shares with Sobers. Furthermore, he is one of only two visiting cricketers to score over 1000 runs at that position in England, the other being Sobers again.Adding to his all-round dominance, Jadeja has now taken 34 wickets in England, making him only the third visiting player to score 1000+ runs and take 30+ wickets in a country, after Sobers and England great Wilfred Rhodes (in Australia).In the fourth Test, Jadeja’s unbeaten 107 was part of a heroic rearguard that saw India claw back from 0/2 to finish at 425/4, securing a hard-fought draw against England's massive 669-run first innings.Jadeja’s five fifty-plus scores in the current series is the most by any Indian batting at No.6 or lower in a single Test series, equalling VVS Laxman ’s record from 2002 in the West Indies.With 12 fifty-plus scores in SENA countries while batting lower down the order, Jadeja is now second only to MS Dhoni (13), and he’s done it in just 47 innings — an astonishing strike rate for someone long considered a bowling all-rounder.Jadeja’s current series scores — 89, 69*, 72, 61*, 20, and 107* — highlight not just consistency, but the ability to shape match outcomes under pressure. He remains central to India’s hopes ahead of the final Test at The Oval, with England leading the series 2-1.","Ravindra Jadeja equals Sir Garfield Sobers' record for most 50-plus scores at No.6 or lower in a Test series in England.

Cordarelle Patterson released by the Pittsburgh Steelers in shock decision.

The Pittsburgh Steelers have released veteran running back and kick returner Cordarrelle Patterson. Patterson took to social media on Monday to announce, rather sarcastically, that he has been released by the Pittsburgh Steelers. In his post, he referred to himself as the ‘washed up cordarrelle patterson’ and seemed to be making a jibe at the Steelers for letting him go on his day off.“Breaking news❗️❗️❗️Pittsburgh Steelers release old washed up cordarrelle patterson on his day off!!!” Patterson wrote.As per reports, the 34-year-old running back had one year left on a two-year, $6 million contract, which he had signed last year. By sacking him, the Steelers have saved themselves $2.8 million in salary cap space.Patterson is a 12-year NFL veteran who rushed 32 times for 135 yards and had 12 catches for 80 yards and one touchdown.Many experts believe that Cordarrelle Patterson is one of the greatest kickoff return specialists in the NFL and is perhaps best known for his 109-yard touchdown. Patterson also holds the NFL record for most kickoff return touchdowns, four more than legendary returner Devin Hester. It’s not clear if Patterson was expecting to be fired or if he has made any plans for moving on.","The 34-year-old running back had one year left on a two-year, $6 million contract, which he had signed last year.

FAQs

What happened to Christian Gonzalez at Patriots training camp?

Is Christian Gonzalez’s injury serious?

How important is Christian Gonzalez to the Patriots' 2025 season?

What’s next for Christian Gonzalez and the Patriots



The New England Patriots' training camp took a worrying turn on Monday. Star cornerback Christian Gonzalez, arguably the most important piece of the Patriots’ defense, was seen limping off the field after covering wide receiver Stefon Diggs in a drill. For a fanbase hungry for a turnaround in 2025, it was the last thing anyone wanted to see.According to ESPN’s Mike Reiss, the injury occurred during early 11-on-11 work when Gonzalez was covering Diggs on a crossing route. He made his way to the athletic training shed under his own power, which is a positive sign, but the fact that he left practice at all has raised concerns. While the Patriots have yet to release an official statement, early signs suggest it may be a leg-related issue.For New England, Gonzalez isn’t just another starter—he’s a franchise cornerstone. Drafted in the first round in 2023, he quickly developed into one of the league’s top young defensive backs. His elite coverage skills, athleticism, and football IQ made him a standout in a defense that already prides itself on discipline and structure.The Patriots are entering a transitional phase, especially on offense, with new players and a new quarterback under center.That means the defense will likely be leaned on heavily, and Gonzalez is expected to lead the secondary against high-powered AFC East offenses led by the likes of Josh Allen and Aaron Rodgers.A setback, however minor, could ripple through the defense. Depth at cornerback is still unproven, and without Gonzalez, the Patriots may struggle to contain top-tier receivers. His presence alone shifts game plans, and his absence would force New England to get creative, possibly even rethinking its coverage schemes.Christian Gonzalez appeared to suffer a leg-related injury during an 11-on-11 drill while covering Stefon Diggs. He limped off the field and headed to the athletic training shed under his own power, raising concerns among Patriots fans.As of now, the New England Patriots have not released an official injury update. However, since Gonzalez was able to walk off the field without assistance, there is cautious optimism that the injury is not severe.Christian Gonzalez is a key player in the Patriots' secondary and one of the top young cornerbacks in the NFL. His health is critical for the team's defensive success in 2025, especially with tough AFC East matchups on the schedule.There’s hope this is nothing serious. Gonzalez walking off the field is encouraging, and precautionary exits are common during training camp. Still, with just weeks until preseason games begin, fans and coaches alike will be watching closely for any updates.Also Read: Brotherhood born in bathroom: Aaron Rodgers and DK Metcalf’s hilarious bond is more than just QB-WR duo at Steelers training camp The Patriots need their top cornerback healthy and ready.

Four Tests later, the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy continues to find new ingredients to keep the pot boiling. This series has showcased two of the finest all-rounders of this generation, Ben Stokes and Ravindra Jadeja , at their very best. One of the most talked-about moments came at Lord’s, where a photo of Stokes hugging Jadeja went viral. It was a show of respect after Jadeja’s valiant effort with the bat, even though India fell short and England took a 2-1 lead in the five match series.But the story took a new turn at Old Trafford. With the match hanging in the balance, Stokes offered Jadeja the hand to call it a draw. Jadeja refused. Instead, he stood tall and produced a brilliant Test hundred, guiding India to safety from a near-impossible situation. This time, it was Jadeja - and India - who came out on top.That handshake, or refusal to take one, sparked a furore. It was a sign of how much the contest meant to both players, and how their rivalry is built not just on mutual respect, but on fierce competitiveness.Ben Stokes and Ravindra Jadeja are two of the finest all-rounders in modern cricket, but their strengths lie in very different areas.One is a consistent performer who offers value in every match. The other is a player made for the biggest moments, the one who stands up when backs are against the wall.Stokes has played more cricket overall. He has featured in 115 Tests, compared to Jadeja’s 84. He has batted in 206 innings, while Jadeja has had 126. Naturally, Stokes has more runs with 7,032, while Jadeja has 3,824. Stokes also leads in centuries with 14 and has 35 fifties. His highest score of 258 shows the kind of innings he can produce when he gets in.However, Jadeja averages more with the bat. His Test batting average is 37.86, compared to Stokes’ 35.7. Jadeja also brings far greater value with the ball. He has taken 330 wickets at an average of 25.07. Stokes has 230 wickets at 31.65. Jadeja has picked up 15 five-wicket hauls and 3 ten-wicket hauls. Stokes has five and zero, respectively, in those departments.In recent years, Stokes has not bowled regularly because of recurring injury concerns. But in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy against India, he has been the top pick among the England bowlers. Despite the fitness issues, he is the leading wicket-taker with 17 wickets. At Lord’s, he bowled a marathon 10-over spell that set the tone with control and aggression. At Old Trafford, he bowled through visible pain with one shoulder and pinned a well set KL Rahul, breaking a 188-run third wicket stand.Yet, even in a series where Stokes has produced some of his best work with the ball, Jadeja has outperformed him with the bat. Jadeja has scored 454 runs in this series compared to Stokes’ 304. While Stokes holds the edge in wickets, Jadeja’s overall contribution across both departments remains significant.What makes Stokes such a unique competitor in world cricket is not just his numbers. It is his influence in high-pressure moments. Whether it was the 2019 World Cup final at Lord’s, the Headingley Ashes miracle that same year, or the 2022 T20 World Cup final, Stokes has been England’s clutch player on the grandest stages.He may not be the most consistent batter or the most reliable bowler every time he takes the field, but in the defining moments of major contests, Stokes has stepped up. No wonder Virat Kohli once posted, ""I wasn’t joking about calling Ben Stokes the most competitive bloke I’ve played against."" Not because of his averages, but because of his impact when it matters the most.Meanwhile, Jadeja is a cricketer you can count on day in, day out. He is consistent across formats, offers control with the ball, and has become a dependable batter in tough situations. But despite his excellence, Jadeja often goes under the radar. He does not always receive the same attention or praise as others in world cricket, even though his numbers stand up to the best.R Ashwin recently pointed out that the media often fails to appreciate Jadeja's consistent performances. According to Ashwin, Jadeja only becomes a talking point when the team is not performing well, even though he quietly delivers in all departments time and again.Legendary all-rounder Kapil Dev also weighed in, stating that Jadeja is better than Stokes in terms of all-round value. Coming from someone who redefined the role, it speaks volumes.Both are great in their own rights. If Stokes fuels inspiration with his bravado and delivers the knockout punches in crucial junctures, Jadeja is a swordsman, whose steel is getting sharper with age.","Ben Stokes and Ravindra Jadeja are two of the finest all-rounders in modern cricket, but their strengths lie in very different areas.

What NBA team does Stephen Curry play for?

What playing style does DeRozan promote for young athletes?

Stephen Curry’s groundbreaking influence on basketball has transformed the sport for an entire generation. His unique talent for hitting three-pointers has encouraged numerous young players to mimic his approach. Nevertheless, DeMar DeRozan, a long-time NBA star and six-time All-Star, has a word of caution for aspiring players: pursuing the 'Steph Curry model' might lead them in the wrong direction.In the 7 PM in Brooklyn podcast, DeRozan had a chat with young players and their parents, encouraging them not to feel the need to copy Curry. “I never want young guys that’s coming up to feel discouraged, like they’ve got to go out there and be Steph Curry,” DeRozan said. “Everybody’s just not going to be Steph Curry. It’s one Steph Curry.” His remarks underscore the fact that Curry's skill set stands out, even among NBA legends. DeRozan made this comment while addressing how young players tend to neglect various facets of the game in their quest for Curry-like shooting ability.DeRozan went further, emphasizing the uniqueness of Curry’s abilities: “What he’s able to do is incredible.I think we would never see nobody else like that.” This announcement points out how rare Curry's combination of shooting accuracy, basketball IQ, and stamina is. Being a four-time NBA champion and an 11-time All-Star, Curry's game encompasses more than just three-point shooting. His ongoing movement, ability to interpret defenses, and talent for making space distinguish him as a truly unique athlete.He was not trying to demotivate the young athletes, what he meant was Stephen Curry has his own way of playing the game but if you are good at something then you can still be ""successful"".This is not the only time when it was suggested not to imitate Stephen Curry. During Draymond Green's podcast, the head coach of Los Angeles Clipper Ty Lue said, ""Step is the hardest guy a gameplan for because of like everything he creates. He creates everything off his movement and people always want to try to duplicate. ""DeRozan being wary is seen in the challenges that the young players encounter whenever they attempt to copy the style of Curry. Most people only focus on his shooting of three pointers, yet most of the time they overlook those details that make him unique. The off-ball movement by Curry is one of the best in NBA history and this has assisted him in making open shots even in the tight defense. His fitness enables him to maintain a strong standard of play in the whole game and it is not something that everybody can achieve. Moreover, shooting mechanics that Curry has practiced throughout the years of his life are hard to replicate.Numerous young athletes who look up to Curry often find it hard to thrive in the NBA. DeRozan notes that players such as Trae Young, the star of the Atlanta Hawks and a great three-point shooter, have their own unique way of playing, even if they share a few traits with Curry.Also Read: Ja Morant’s viral dunk in China reignites debate over his NBA Dunk Contest absence despite fan pressure “It’s one Steph Curry,” he remarked, a straightforward but deep recognition of Curry’s unique talent.

What kind of contract is Kuznetsov likely to get?



With the 2025-26 NHL season on the horizon, former Washington Capitals star Evgeny Kuznetsov is making headlines once again; the 33-year-old center, who spent last season dominating in the KHL with SKA St. Petersburg (12 goals, 37 points in 39 games). He is looking to return to the NHL; despite a down year in 2023-24 split between the Capitals and the Carolina Hurricanes. Kuznetsov’s proven playoff pedigree and playmaking instincts. This make him one of the more intriguing free agents still available.The Boston Bruins have reshaped their roster this offseason, bringing in Viktor Arvidsson, Tanner Jeannot, and center Sean Kuraly. But even with Elias Lindholm and Pavel Zacha holding down top-six center roles, Boston lacks a true offensive pivot who can boost their power play and complement David Pastrnak’s elite scoring.After trading J.T. Miller and losing Pius Suter in free agency, the Vancouver Canucks need help at center. Filip Chytil, acquired in the Miller deal, is coming off an injury-affected season, and the team is still figuring out how to best develop young Aatu Raty.The Colorado Avalanche are always in win-now mode. With Charlie Coyle traded and Jack Drury unproven as a full-time third-line center, Colorado could benefit from Kuznetsov’s offensive upside. He may not be a defensive stalwart, but the Avs need creativity behind Brock Nelson and Nathan MacKinnon.Yes, as of late July 2025, Kuznetsov remains unsigned and is exploring his options for a return to the NHL.He is currently 33 years old.Most likely a short-term, low-cost deal or a professional tryout (PTO) given his recent NHL decline and teams’ tight cap situations.If Kuznetsov wants redemption in the National Hockey League, this season might be his best shot.

Mario Ferraro trade rumors grow as San Jose Sharks reshape defensive core ahead of final contract year

“teams that reached out during the season will poke around this offseason,”

Playoff contenders circling as San Jose Sharks’ Mario Ferraro remains without NHL postseason experience

FAQs:

1. When did Mario Ferraro make his NHL debut?

2. What is Mario Ferraro’s nationality?

Trade rumors surrounding San Jose Sharks defenseman Mario Ferraro are gaining steam as he enters the final year of his four-year, $13 million contract. With the 2025–26 NHL season looming and free agency on the horizon, multiple reports indicate that both Ferraro and the Sharks could be open to a move. Several contending teams have already shown interest in acquiring the reliable blue-liner.According to The Fourth Period, Mario Ferraro hasn’t formally requested a trade, but he is open to a fresh start elsewhere. With the Sharks in full rebuild mode and having added three new defensemen this offseason, Ferraro’s role and future in San Jose appear uncertain. The Sharks are reportedly willing to explore trade options for the 27-year-old alternate captain before he hits unrestricted free agency in 2026.TFP notes thatsignaling a real chance that Ferraro could be moved in the coming months. Ranked No. 9 on TFP’s Summer Trade List, he is viewed as a valuable depth addition for playoff-contending teams. Ferraro brings grit, leadership, and durability to the table, qualities that could prove essential during a long postseason run.Despite playing six seasons with the Sharks, Ferraro has yet to appear in an NHL playoff game.Still, his consistent effort and leadership have earned him recognition, including the Sharks’ Media Good Guy Award for two consecutive seasons. He played 78 games in 2024–25, recording five goals and 12 assists while continuing to rank among the league leaders in blocked shots.His playing style, physical, shot-blocking, and team-first makes him a natural fit as a No. 4 or No. 5 defenseman on a deeper roster. Teams like the Colorado Avalanche, Winnipeg Jets, Tampa Bay Lightning, and Calgary Flames have all been linked to Ferraro in recent reports.As the Sharks prepare for another rebuilding season, Mario Ferraro’s time in San Jose may be nearing its end. While nothing is finalized, both sides appear open to a move that could benefit Ferraro’s career and the team’s long-term plans.

It's all to play for on Thursday at The Oval and with the series still on the line, multiple changes - some forced, some tactical - are set to take place in India's playing XI for the fifth and final Test of the Anderson-Tendulkar trophy. Jasprit Bumrah 's status will become clearer in the next 24 hours and while he continues to be in the mix, final call will be taken keeping his workload in mind. He has already bowled 119.4 overs in the series - including 33 in Manchester - but just one outing in the fourth Test meant there was extra time to cool the heels in the change room.It is understood that a ""wildcard"" approach could be followed as far as Bumrah is concerned, and the team management is likely to shore up wicket-taking options for the fixture. Kuldeep Yadav has been warming the bench during the four Tests and his wait may well end. There is some prediction of rain in the week ahead but weather has had very little bearing on the surfaces, which have continued to be dry throughout the series.India must field an attack which is capable of picking 20 wickets in the Test as they have momentum on their side after the Manchester escape and have a bright chance of levelling the series.Coach Gautam Gambhir confirmed on Sunday, all fast bowlers have regained fitness and available for selection but it will be interesting to see which combination India go for.Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep are set to feature and the third bowler could be either Bumrah or one of Arshdeep or Prasidh Krishna as Anshul Kamboj is highly unlikely to hold on to his spot after an underwhelming debut. This leaves the thinktank with the same question again - Shardul Thakur's ""depth"" or Kuldeep's wickets?This time, however, there could well be an all-in call as the series is alive and kicking and Thakur's underutilisation clearly suggests there is very little trust in his abilities with the ball. There has been so much chatter around Kuldeep since the start of the series and the long wait could finally end in the all-important fixture.If Bumrah gets, and gives, an all clear, India will have not one but two X-factors in the playing XI and it will be a very strong statement to an opposition which appeared rattle at Old Trafford.Dhruv Jurel will be the only new face in the batting order as he replaces injured Rishabh Pant and the rest are set to retain their spots.Apart from Jurel, the bowling combination will witness multiple changes and as of now, Akash Deep, Kuldeep are emerging as strong candidates to be in the XI, with discussions still underway on Bumrah. The possibility of drafting Arshdeep Singh, who was always being prepared for the last two games, in the XI will not come as a surprise if Bumrah decides against playing at The Oval.","Jasprit Bumrah's fitness and workload will be assessed to ascertain if he plays the fifth Test against England at The Oval.

India stay alive, England frustrated after draw; handshake drama at Old Trafford and more

Poll Do you agree with Nasser Hussain's assessment of Stokes' leadership style? Strongly agree Disagree Strongly disagree

England captain Ben Stokes has been at the heart of his side’s spirited showing in the ongoing five-Test series against India, both with his performance and leadership. As the series heads towards a dramatic finale, Stokes’ handling of key players like Jofra Archer has drawn praise, especially from former skipper Nasser Hussain.Speaking on Sky Sports Cricket after the fourth Test ended in a gripping draw at Old Trafford, Hussain pointed out the trust and chemistry between Stokes and Archer, who made his Test comeback in the third match at Lord’s.“I like the fact that Ben knows what makes Jofra Archer tick. There’s a huge amount of respect between the two,” Hussain said.He recalled a moment from the third Test where Stokes was seen having a sharp word with Archer before lightening the mood with a smile and embrace. This was a clear reflection of the skipper’s balanced leadership.“At Lord’s, exactly the same happened. Stokes has that mentality - I’m your friend and I’ll look after you, but I’m not your best friend. If you don’t quite get it right, I will have a word with you,” Hussain explained.“He’ll know what makes Archer tick and I think Archer is actually a better bowler when he is a bit fired up and his legs start pumping a little bit,” he added.Archer, who returned to the playing XI midway through the series, has picked up key wickets, with figures of 2/52 and 3/55 at Lord’s, followed by 3/73 and 1/78 in the drawn fourth Test.The Manchester Test saw both sides go toe-to-toe, with India batting out the final day and Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar scoring centuries after declining England’s offer to end the game early.With the series finely poised at 2-1 in England’s favour, Stokes’ leadership, and particularly his handling of players like Archer could prove decisive as the teams gear up for the final Test at The Oval.","England captain Ben Stokes has been at the heart of his side’s spirited showing in the ongoing five-Test series against India.

"Al-Hilal withdraws from 2025 Saudi Super Cup citing fatigue, sparks debate on player welfare",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/al-hilal-withdraws-from-2025-saudi-super-cup-citing-fatigue-sparks-debate-on-player-welfare/articleshow/122932099.cms,"Al‑Hilal will not participate in the 2025 Saudi Super Cup in Hong Kong/Image: Instagram

TL;DR:

Al‑Hilal will not participate in the 2025 Saudi Super Cup in Hong Kong due to severe player fatigue and leave shortfall.

Flight delays and Club World Cup travel reduced annual leave to 21‑24 days, breaching SAFF ’s minimum 28‑day requirement. Medical reviews confirmed “extreme fatigue” after more than a year of back-to-back competition.

SAFF may impose fines up to SAR 500,000 and appoint Al‑Ahli as replacement.

The move underscores prioritizing player health and contract compliance over participation in exhibition tournaments.

Club vs. Federation Tensions?









Saudi football powerhouse Al-Hilal has officially pulled out of the 2025 Saudi Super Cup, citing player exhaustion following a tightly packed season and insufficient rest time after their Club World Cup appearance in the United States. The club notified the Saudi Arabian Football Federation (SAFF) that participation would breach player leave entitlements and health protocols, making them unfit for additional competition.In a formal communication to SAFF, Al-Hilal laid out a detailed explanation for its decision. The club argued that its players had just concluded a strenuous international campaign at the FIFA Club World Cup, and were entitled to a minimum of 28 days of annual leave, as mandated under SAFF’s Professionalism and Player Status Regulations. However, due to scheduling and travel complications, the players would only receive 21 days of rest if they went ahead with the Super Cup.The club's medical staff also issued warnings over widespread physical fatigue among key players, following nearly 12 months of uninterrupted domestic and international competition. Citing player safety and long-term performance, Al-Hilal decided that withdrawing was in the best interest of both its players and Saudi football.The tipping point came with overlapping schedules. The Super Cup draw took place on June 19, just a day after Al-Hilal began its Club World Cup campaign. Following their elimination on July 4, players were delayed an extra three days in the US due to limited flights. This narrowed the rest period significantly.Further complicating matters, the final Super Cup venue, Hong Kong, was confirmed only on June 13, which gave clubs minimal preparation time and forced logistical adjustments mid-season.Al-Hilal SFC, based in Riyadh, is not just any football club. With a history spanning over six decades, it is one of the most decorated clubs in Asia:Known for its deep fanbase and star-studded squad, Al-Hilal is the Gulf’s flagship football brand, having recently signed global icons and competed against teams like Real Madrid and Manchester City on the world stage.SAFF acknowledged Al-Hilal’s official withdrawal and stated that it would address the matter under the existing disciplinary framework. According to Article 8 of the Saudi Super Cup Regulations, any team pulling out after the tournament draw may face fines up to SAR 500,000 and exclusion from the next edition.The federation is now exploring alternatives, with reports suggesting that Al-Ahli could step in to replace Al-Hilal, provided they meet readiness requirements.This move marks a rare but growing trend among top-tier clubs: putting player health above short-term trophies. With global football becoming more congested, Al-Hilal’s stance could influence scheduling reforms in the region.Al-Hilal’s exit removes one of the biggest draws from the Saudi Super Cup, potentially affecting ticket sales, broadcast value, and the event's international appeal.The Saudi national team has World Cup qualifiers lined up later this year. Many of Al-Hilal’s players are central to coach Roberto Mancini’s plans, and this break gives them time to recover before crucial matches.The decision also hints at ongoing friction between clubs and organizers regarding player welfare, calendar planning, and communication transparency.Al-Hilal’s withdrawal from the Saudi Super Cup is more than a scheduling clash, it’s a bold statement on how Gulf football is evolving. With elite clubs now balancing commercial obligations against player burnout, this episode may prompt serious introspection within SAFF and beyond. The coming weeks will reveal whether this sparks meaningful change, or if the weight of tradition and tournament prestige overrides concerns of fatigue and fairness.","Saudi football powerhouse Al-Hilal has officially pulled out of the 2025 Saudi Super Cup.

"Kate Middleton's trusted aide quits, then unfollows Meghan Markle online, stirring new talk of a royal rift",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/kate-middletons-trusted-aide-quits-then-unfollows-meghan-markle-online-stirring-new-talk-of-a-royal-rift/articleshow/122744163.cms,"Biggest Royal Flop Yet? Netflix Quietly Regrets Meghan Markle’s $100M Deal





Natasha Archer has been by the Princess of Wales’s side since 2010. She selected outfits for overseas tours, was even on hand at the hospital for royal baby photo calls, ready with spare outfits and supplies and was promoted to Senior Private Executive Assistant in 2022. Last week Kensington Palace confirmed Archer, now 37, is leaving to start a private “luxury consultancy.”Soon after the news broke, Archer switched her long-private Instagram profile to public. Royal watchers noticed two quick moves. She stopped following Meghan Markle , the Duchess’s lifestyle label As Ever, and several friends in Meghan’s circle, including makeup artist Daniel Martin and polo player Delfina Blaquier.The timing set off fresh speculation because the royal family is quietly trying to ease tensions with the Sussexes. Palace sources say aides for King Charles and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex held an informal meeting in London this month to explore next steps toward better relations. Prince William’s team did not attend, leaving doubts about how far any thaw can go.Commentators see Archer’s “unfollow” spree as a public hint that fences remain unmended. The Blast, citing insider chatter, called the move a “controversial stunt” that risks undercutting reconciliation plans said to be backed by Princess Kate herself.People who have worked with Archer stress her loyalty to the Wales household. She received the Royal Victorian Order in 2019 for personal service and is married to royal photographer Chris Jackson. Friends say her new consultancy will advise private clients on travel logistics and event styling, skills honed during fifteen years on royal duty.Neither Kensington Palace nor the Sussex office has commented on the social-media changes. Online, opinions split quickly. Some see the unfollows as a harmless reset before Archer’s career move. Others view them as a subtle show of support for Kate during a sensitive phase in family diplomacy.What happens next will likely unfold off camera. Kate is said to be focused on her children’s summer break and on a fuller return to public engagements later in the year. Meghan remains in California, preparing for new launches under her As Ever brand. Behind the scenes, advisers on both sides are expected to keep talking, while Archer steps into private life with new clients and fewer royal handles in her feed.For royal watchers, the small click of an unfollow button has added one more twist to a story that shows no sign of fading from the spotlight.","Natasha Archer has been by the Princess of Wales’s side since 2010.
