"Indian Coast Guard Gujarat Drug Seized: 300 kg Narcotics Worth ₹1,800 Crore Intercepted in Joint Operation​",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarat-ats-indian-coast-guard-seize-300kg-drugs-worth-rs-1800-crore/articleshow/120268647.cms,"Representative image (ANI)

In an overnight operation on 12-13 April 25, Indian Coast Guard undertook an intelligence based anti-narcotics operation at sea jointly with the Gujarat ATS. More than 300kg of narcotics worth approx Rs 1,800 crore has been seized.The operation was a perfect example of inter-agency coordination wherein based on a corroborated input from Gujarat ATS, an ICG ship from the Coast Guard Region (West), which was on multi-mission deployment off North Maharashtra/ South Gujarat area, diverted and intercepted an attempted transshipment in proximity of the notional International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) prior it could be undertaken, thus leading to the successful operation.Based on the credible intel of ATS, the ICG ship identified a suspect boat despite pitch dark night. On realising the approaching ICG ship, the suspect boat dumped its narcotics consignment in sea before it started fleeing towards the IMBL.The alert ICG ship deployed its sea boat immediately for recovery of the jettisoned consignment whilst commencing a hot chase of the suspect boat. The proximity of IMBL and the initial separation between the ICG ship and the boat at the time of its detection helped the perpetrator to evade interception before it crossed over the IMBL within a short time.The cross over resulted in termination of the hot chase and precluded the ICG ship to apprehend the suspect boat. Meanwhile, the ICG team in sea-boat, after thorough search in the tough night conditions, recovered the sizeable amount narcotics that was dumped into sea.The seized narcotics has been brought to Porbandar by the ICG ship for further investigations. The jointness of ICG and ATS, which has led to 13 such successful law enforcement operations in recent years reaffirms the synergy for national objective.","Indian Coast Guard undertook an intelligence based anti-narcotics operation at sea jointly with the Gujarat ATS.

NEW DELHI: ""DC ke saarein khatam ho gaye hain, sahab (Sir, the DC ones are all sold out),"" sighed an agitated jersey seller outside the Arun Jaitley Stadium .He wasn’t alone.On a crowded Jawaharlal Nehru Marg, vendors echoed the same tone as Delhi Capitals jerseys had vanished from the shelves -- a mere representation of the team’s unbeaten run in the 18th season of the Indian Premier League (IPL).With DC jerseys in short supply, neutrals, who had just arrived to enjoy a game of IPL on Sunday evening, opted for what hadn't run out of stock yet: a Mumbai Indians jersey with “Rohit” embedded on the back.Inside the stadium, when Jasprit Bumrah was teaching the iconic helicopter shot to Will Jacks, Rohit kept his warm-up light.The ex-Mumbai captain was also seen chatting with DC physio Patrick Farhart, a familiar face from his Team India days.The crowd cheered the loudest when the announcer confirmed Rohit's presence in the MI XI after Delhi won the toss and chose to field first.Opening the innings, Rohit took strike against Mitchell Starc, who operated from the Gautam Gambhir Stand end.For the first couple of overs, the 37-year-old focused on playing it with soft hands and rotating strike, facing just two balls for two runs.But it was Ryan Rickelton's explosive hitting that seemed to spark something in Rohit.In Starc’s second over, Rohit joined the party, smacking 14 runs off the 19-run over -- flashes of his vintage T20 World Cup Super 8s innings against Australia came to being.However, the fire fizzled quickly.While Mukesh Kumar’s pace troubled him in the following over, 20-year-old leggie Vipraj Nigam brought his innings to an end with a sharp delivery that caught the former skipper off guard.An LBW shout and a subsequent review drew the first blood at 47. Keeping his head down, Rohit walked off with 18 off 12.It was yet another short stay this season: 0, 8, 13, 17, and now 18.There’s a slow upward trend, and Rohit will be hoping to break free from this streak in the games ahead.A day before the match, he, however, had kept the lights on at the Arun Jaitley nets longer than anyone else.Mumbai Indians arrived first for training at around 5:30 PM, and while DC wound up early, Rohit had only just begun his session.Earlier in the evening, he was mostly observing, quietly going through fitness routines. With his knee strapped, many assumed he wouldn’t bat.But he eventually geared up, put on the pads. After some solo knocking on one side of the ground, he headed to the nets.Interestingly, Rohit, however, didn't face any bowlers: only a 30-minute round of throwdown. Thus, the training session, which was supposed to end at 8:30 PM, concluded thirty minutes later.Even then, the trademark big hits were missing. None of his big hits cleared the boundary and reached the stands. The signs of struggle were clear.Backed by strong batting displays from Rickelton (41), Suryakumar Yadav (40), Tilak Varma (59), and Naman Dhir (38 not out), MI reached 205/5. Rohit Sharma showed glimpses of agility before making way for impact sub Karn Sharma, who turned the tide with a match-defining 3/36, dismissing the dangerous Karun Nair (89) and swinging momentum MI’s way.An edge-of-the-seat finish saw three successive run-outs as Delhi were bowled out for 193 in 19 overs.What followed was the blue wave of celebration as it secured Mumbai’s second win in six games. Now, whether this sparks a turnaround in their IPL season remains to be seen.",Mumbai Indians beat Delhi Capitals by six wickets in IPL. Rohit Sharma top scored for MI with 18 runs from 12 overs.

NEW DELHI: Desperate to arrest their slide, the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) will be hoping for a change in fortunes when they face the in-form Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in Match 30 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium today (April 14).CSK find themselves under mounting pressure, having suffered five consecutive defeats — a rare slump for the five-time champions. Their woes have been compounded by a lack of firepower in the middle-order and over-reliance on the top-order batters. Adding to their misery, CSK have lost three home games in a row at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, marking a first in the franchise’s storied IPL history.The return of M.S. Dhoni as captain, following Ruturaj Gaikwad’s injury, failed to inspire a turnaround in their last outing against the Kolkata Knight Riders. As they head into this crucial fixture, CSK will be desperate for a complete performance with both bat and ball to snap their losing streak.In contrast, LSG are riding a wave of confidence after a commanding six-wicket win over Gujarat Titans. With four victories in six games, they sit comfortably at third in the points table. CSK, meanwhile, are languishing at the bottom, managing just one win from six matches.The two sides have faced off five times in IPL history, with LSG holding a slight edge—winning three encounters, while one ended without a result. As both teams gear up for this pivotal clash, CSK will be eyeing redemption, while LSG look to keep their winning momentum going.The surface at the Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow is expected to be a balanced one, offering assistance to both pacers and spinners.

One of the most talked-about fights of the entire card at UFC 314 finally had its winner whensubmittedin the second round. Silva dominated the entire bout from the beginning and successfully managed to secure a win against Thug Nasty . Since then, the internet has blown off with interesting memes and posts trolling Mitchell for his past controversial comments. One of the posts highlighted a screenshot of the bout recording where Silva is seenin a swastika position.A couple of months before the fight, Bryce Mitchell was entangled in a controversy when he sided with Hitler in a podcast. He believed that the German dictator was essentially a good guy, and the fighter would have loved to go fishing with him. Fans were outraged by the comment, and even during the kickoff press conference event of UFC 314, the audience silenced him, not letting him speak.On the night of the most anticipated fight, the crowd went crazy over Jean Silva’s win before nearly breaking Mitchell’s neck. The Octagon was filled with Silva’s barking imitation while Mitchell lay there gasping for air for a while. Thug Nasty later on took to his social media platform, Instagram, where he posted a video admitting his loss.“I fought as hard as I possibly could. I couldn’t have fought any harder. I could have fought smarter.”Meanwhile, netizens have started finding out ways of trolling the fighter while relating his previous comments to the UFC 314 defeat. One such troll that went viral was a picture that showcased Silva choking the fighter in a swastika position. It was a direct callback to his pro-Hitler comment that did not sit well with anybody across the internet.ACD MMA wrote, “still can’t believe Jean Silva made Bryce Mitchell tap out in a swastika position last night”Fans immediately started sharing and reacting to the post. One of the users wrote, “The good old reverse Hitler sub”Another one wrote, “Woulda been so funny if they announced ‘Jean Silva winner by way of reverse hitler choke ’”A fan even edited the viral screenshot and drew a pattern to make the swastika symbol even more prominent.“In Brazil we have this saying: ‘Beating a Nazi until the swastika turns into a pinwheel.’”Also read: “Overcoming the adversity” - UFC featherweight champion Alexander Volkanovski recalls a promise made to his daughters It is quite evident that Mitchell’s defeat was actually a celebratory moment for a majority of UFC fans, as they despised the fighter for his absurd comments.

NEW DELHI: Karun Nair announced his IPL comeback in spectacular style with a blistering 22-ball half-century, his first in seven years, powering Delhi Capitals to a flying start against Mumbai Indians at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday.The highlight of his knock was a stunning assault on Jasprit Bumrah in the final over of the powerplay that brought the crowd to its feet and left even MI skipper Hardik Pandya applauding.Chasing 206, DC were jolted early as Jake Fraser-McGurk was dismissed off the first ball by Deepak Chahar . But Nair, playing his first IPL match since 2022, joined Abishek Porel and turned the tide with fearless intent. The pair raced to a fifty-run partnership within five overs, with Nair taking charge.78 (24) - Jake Fraser McGurk vs MI, 202450 (20) - Jake Fraser McGurk vs RR, 202450 (22) - Karun Nair vs MI, 2025*Nair was on 32 when Bumrah returned for his second over in the sixth. He smashed the first ball for a six over backward square leg, followed it with a boundary, and then hammered another six over long-off. A couple off the final ball of the over brought up his milestone — a 22-ball fifty — becoming only the second DC batter after Fraser-McGurk to reach a half-century inside the powerplay.Nair was eventually dismissed by Mitchell Santner in the 12th over for 89. He smashed five sixes and 12 fours in his 40-ball whirlwind knock. He added 119 runs for the opening wicket with Porel (33 off 25 balls) to set the foundation of the run chase.Earlier, Tilak Varma’s 59 off 33, dominated by his signature mid-wicket strokes, helped MI post 205/5. Naman Dhir supported well with 38 not out.

A goal for the ages: Alex Ovechkin breaks Wayne Gretzky's 26-year record



FULL Alex Ovechkin Celebration Ceremony After Record-Breaking Goal No. 895

A legacy passed down: Anastasia Shubskaya receives diamond tribute from Janet Gretzky



After Alex Ovechkin netted his 895th career goal and broke legendary Wayne Gretzky 's record, Janet Gretzky showed respect to a time-honored hockey tradition by gifting Anastasia Shubskaya , wife of Alex Ovechkin, an eight-carat diamond ring that had been estimated at $280,000. The Capitals may have lost to the New York Islanders by a score of 4-1, but the outcome was an afterthought to a night all about legacy, love, and a new chapter in hockey's history.The moment of history arrived at 7:26 of the second period. Alex Ovechkin let go of a blazing shot through fellow Russian Ilya Sorokin, making himself the NHL's all-time leading goal scorer. Fans inside UBS Arena lost their minds, and Alex Ovechkin commemorated the occasion by executing a belly flop onto the ice—celebrating his big achievement.Alex Ovechkin celebrated this achievement in a pregame ceremony against the Carolina Hurricanes on April 10, 2025. He was given a six-foot sculptural painting by TYP depicting his skates and game-used sticks, with his image on it, with “Most Goals All Time” written on the top and “895 Alex Ovechkin 895” on the bottom.While Alex Ovechkin was absorbing the enormity of his achievement, Anastasia Shubskaya was gifted a symbolic token of the historic night. Continuing a tradition started in 1994, when Colleen Howe (wife of Gordie Howe) gave Janet Gretzky a diamond ring after her husband, Wayne Gretzky, broke Colleen Howe’s husband’s record, Janet Gretzky ensured history repeated itself—this time from one hockey family to another.In an interview with the media, Wayne Gretzky said, “A month ago, my wife said, ‘You know, Colleen Howe started a tradition. I’m not sure if anyone is going to break Alex’s record, but I want to give her (Ovechkin’s wife, Anastasia Shubskaya) something really unique.’ So, we went out and she picked out an eight-diamond ring for Alex’s wife. Not only do hockey guys pass down traditions. So do the families and wives.”The act not only spanned generations of greatness but also underlined the strong relationship between hockey families across generations.Anastasia Shubskaya, who tied the knot with Alex Ovechkin in 2016, is a Russian model who has appeared in numerous Russian magazines during her career and has built a strong social media presence. They are proud parents of two sons- Sergei and Ilya.Shubskaya had posted a cute moment on her Instagram stories when her son intently watched the game while his father was playing, captioning it: ""Tuning in for the game"" with a smiley face.Also read: “Now the real stuff is coming”: Alex Ovechkin skips The Tonight Show appearance to stay playoff-ready Even though the Capitals fell on the evening, the larger context is one of hope. The team had already secured a playoff berth and now has the emotional tailwind of reaching a once-a-generation milestone. With the NHL playoffs coming, Alex Ovechkin and the Washington Capitals aim to ride the wave of history toward what would be a fairy tale conclusion to the 2025 campaign.","Alex Ovechkin scored his 895th career goal against the Carolina Hurricanes on April 10, 2025.

He now sits second on the all-time list of most T20 half-centuries, behind only Australia’s David Warner , who has 108 fifties and 8 centuries from 400 games.Kohli brought up his landmark in style, launching Wanindu Hasaranga over the ropes in the 15th over of the run chase.Chasing 174, Kohli led from the front, stitching a blistering 92-run opening partnership with Phil Salt , who smashed 65 off just 33 balls. He then shared an unbeaten 83-run stand with Devdutt Padikkal (40 off 28), guiding RCB to a thumping nine-wicket win with 15 balls remaining.Earlier, Rajasthan Royals posted a competitive 173/4, built on Yashasvi Jaiswal ’s fluent 75 off 47 deliveries. However, their total proved insufficient against a relentless RCB top order.With this milestone, Kohli not only reaffirmed his status as a modern-day legend but also demonstrated his enduring class in the format. Pakistan’s Babar Azam (90 fifties), Chris Gayle (88), and Jos Buttler (86) follow Kohli on the elite T20 fifty-makers list.",Virat Kohli becomes first Indian to score 100 half-centuries in T20 cricket.

'I was under pressure': SRH's Abhishek Sharma after a record 141 against Punjab Kings

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings head coach Stephen Fleming admitted that turning around their woeful IPL 2025 campaign would be a ""big challenge,"" emphasising that MS Dhoni’s return as captain, following Ruturaj Gaikwad’s injury, is not a magical solution.""His [Dhoni's] influence will always be prominent, but he's not a soothsayer, he hasn't got a magic wand,"" Fleming told reporters ahead of CSK’s clash with Lucknow Super Giants on Monday. ""He can't just rub it over the side otherwise he would have brought it out earlier. It's a case of us working very hard along with MS to turn it around and certainly in both of our cricketing careers, we've been in situations that require a lot of energy and we've got to make sure that the energy is put in the right place.""With five consecutive defeats leaving CSK anchored at the bottom of the table, including a crushing loss to KKR where they posted their lowest-ever total at Chepauk (103/9), Fleming said the squad is hurting and undergoing deep introspection.""The disappointing aspect in particular the last game was the lack of competition we put up and that hurt a lot,"" he said. ""There’s certainly been a lot of internal soul-searching… but it’s not about words, it’s about players grabbing the moment, finding form, and shaking off apprehension.""Fleming also reflected on the broader nature of T20 cricket: ""I know there’s a fascination with power and six-hitting, but there’s still room for craft… I’d be very sad if it just became a baseball competition.""Looking ahead to Monday’s game against a high-flying LSG, Fleming confirmed Shivam Dube is likely to be fit and stressed the importance of containing Nicholas Pooran.

Why was Hetmyer's bat size checked by the umpire?

ACCORDING TO THE RULES:

The blade dimensions are restricted to:

PAST INCIDENT:

NEW DELHI: An unusual incident occurred when the umpire inspected Simron Hetmyer's bat dimensions upon his arrival at the crease during the Indian Premier League (IPL) match between Rajasthan Royals and Royal Challengers Bengaluru at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur.Following Yashasvi Jaiswal's dismissal on the final delivery of the 16th over, Hetmyer entered at the fifth position for the Royals, joining Dhruv Jurel at the crease whilst the home team sought to accelerate their scoring rate.The game experienced a momentary pause as the official utilised a bat gauge to verify whether Hetmyer's bat conformed to regulation specifications.Subsequently, the umpire conducted an identical inspection for RCB's opening batsman Phil Salt before their batting innings commenced.During an IPL match, the on-field umpire decided to inspect Shimron Hetmyer ’s bat to ensure it complied with the league’s regulations. This routine check was conducted to verify that the West Indies star's bat met the specifications outlined under Law 5.7 of the IPL playing conditions, which govern bat dimensions.Hetmyer's bat successfully passed the inspection.The IPL regulations do not specify any point penalties for such violations, and it appears that if Hetmyer's bat had failed to comply with the standards, he would have simply been instructed to use a different bat.The overall length of the bat, including the handle, must not exceed 38 inches (96.52 cm).Width: 4.25 inches (10.8 cm)Depth: 2.64 inches (6.7 cm)Edges: 1.56 inches (4.0 cm)The bat must also be able to pass through a bat gauge, as specified.The handle must not be more than 52% of the total length of the bat.Any covering material on the blade must not exceed 0.04 inches (0.1 cm) in thickness.The protective material on the toe of the bat must not be thicker than 0.12 inches (0.3 cm).In the previous season, a significant incident occurred in the English County Championship when Essex received a 12-point deduction after their batsman Feroze Khushi's bat failed to meet size regulations during a match with Nottinghamshire.The incident took place when Khushi was on 21 runs from 27 deliveries, requiring him to switch his bat.This sanction ultimately affected Essex's championship aspirations against Surrey. Without the point deduction, Essex would have secured third position instead of their eventual fourth-place finish.",Shimron Hetmyer's bat was inspected by the umpire during the Indian Premier League match between Rajasthan Royals and Royal Challengers Bengaluru.

What happened to Yankees’ Marcus Stroman?

Yankees’ manager Aaron Boone hopes for a quick return

“Hoping it’s not long, the MRI was good, but he had some swelling in there somewhere. Trying to eliminate that, hopefully get him ramped up pretty quick and hopefully it’s something that really helps him moving forward.”

“I think that was due to the knee.”

It has been a difficult time for the New York Yankees, after their pitcher Marcus Stroman injured his left knee, and was sent to the 15-day injured list. Stroman received a cortisone shot that worked on helping in reducing the swelling, however, the tests show no serious damage. Meanwhile, Yankees’ manager Aaron Boone is hoping for Stroman to recover quickly.During his last game, Marcus Stroman might have been left injured, following which, he gave up five runs and struggled to finish his pitches properly. It was likely because of the knee issue.Well, so far in the game, Stroman has given up at least 12 runs in just over 9 innings. Stroman’s injury could hurt his chance to earn an $18 million option next year, which depends on how many innings he pitches.Media reports claimed that Clarke Schmidt will be taking Stroman’s spot. Schmidt will be coming back from the injured list. He will be making his season debut on Wednesday against the Kansas City Royals at Yankee Stadium.Due to his injuries, Schmidt faced issues with his back and shoulder, but he managed to secure 61 pitches and claims he’s doing well.The New York Yankees’ team manager, Aaron Boone shared an update with the media. He said that while Marcus Stroman has been sent to 15-day injured list due to left knee inflammation, the MRI exam has revealed swelling, but nothing beyond that.Further, Boone reacted and said he hopes that Stroman’s injury is not too bad and he’s able to recover from it quickly. Boone said:When Boone watched video back from that start, he said he could notice Stroman’s injuries as he was not finishing his delivery properly on his front (left) leg.

Alcaraz wins

Monte Carlo Masters

Carlos Alcaraz had an outstanding start to his clay-court season last week, clinching the Monte Carlo title on Sunday for the first time in his career.After missing this Masters 1000 event last year, he earned the full 1,000 ranking points when he beat Lorenzo Musetti in the final, elevating his total from 6,720 to 7,720 points.As a result, Alcaraz moves one place in the latest ATP rankings (April1 4), moving up from No. 3 to No. 2, surpassing Alexander Zverev, who lost his first match in Monte Carlo this year. Zverev’s ranking points drop from 7,645 to 7,595, causing him to fall one place.This marks Alcaraz's first return to the Top 2 since October 28 last year, when he was also ranked No. 2; he had spent 23 consecutive weeks at No. 3 since then. Overall, this is his 89th week in the Top 2, with 36 weeks at No. 1 and 53 weeks at No. 2.Alcaraz also narrows the gap between him and current No. 1 Jannik Sinner, who is suspended presently, from 3,610 points (10,330 to 6,720) to 2,210 points (9,930 to 7,720).Sinner missed Monte Carlo while defending semi-final points as he serves a three-month suspension for two failed dope tests last year. Although Alcaraz can’t overtake him before Sinner returns on the tour in Rome, winning both Barcelona and Madrid in the coming weeks could reduce that gap to just 720 points, putting the No. 1 ranking within reach in Italy.In addition to Alcaraz and Zverev's place swap, there was movement elsewhere in the ATP Top 10: Alex de Minaur made the biggest jump, climbing from No. 10 to No. 7 — just one spot shy of his career-high of No. 6 — after reaching the semifinals of his second Masters 1000 event.Andrey Rublev also rose from No. 9 back to No. 8, while Daniil Medvedev returned to the Top 10 after being outside for two weeks, moving from No. 11 to No. 9. This marked the 2021 US Open champion's first absence from the elite group in over two years, dating back to February 2023.Meanwhile, Musetti closed in on a Top 10 debut, climbing from No. 16 to No. 11 — surpassing his previous career - high of No. 15 — after reaching the finals of his first Masters 1000 event. He’s now just 15 points behind the No. 10-ranked Ruud, with scores of 3,215 to 3,200.""I'm just really happy to have won Monte Carlo for the first time,"" Alcaraz said. ""It's been a really difficult week with a lot of difficult situations. I'm really proud of myself, how I've dealt with everything. It's been a really difficult month for me on the court and outside. Coming here and seeing how the whole hard work has paid off, I'm really happy.""This victory represents Alcaraz's first clay court success since his French Open triumph last season, with his only other clay court appearance resulting in a silver medal at the Paris Olympics.Musetti, appearing in his first Masters 1000 final after defeating top 10 players Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alex de Minaur, started strongly but faced physical challenges as the match progressed.The Italian received medical treatment for his right leg when trailing 0-3 in the final set, though he continued to play despite the injury.""It is not the way I would have wanted to win a match,"" Alcaraz said. ""Lorenzo's been through a really tough week, long and intense matches. I feel sorry for him, one of the best results he has done. To end like this is not easy. Hopefully it's not serious and he's 100 percent soon.""""It was probably one of my best tournaments so far,"" Musetti said, who won bronze at last year's Olympics behind Alcaraz and gold medalist Novak Djokovic. ""I'm disappointed I couldn't finish the match in the best way, for the crowd. You deserve it so I will keep going and try and come back for revenge.""The match began with Musetti dropping his opening service game but immediately breaking back and taking the first set, capitalising on Alcaraz's six unforced errors.Alcaraz's game improved significantly in the second set, which he won convincingly before completing the victory with a dominant final set.Both players will continue their clay court preparations at the Barcelona Open next week as they build toward the French Open at the end of May.","Carlos Alcaraz won the Monte Carlo Masters for the first time in his career.

Los Angeles Clippers injury report for tonight’s game against the Golden State Warriors (April 13, 2025)

When and where to watch the Golden State Warriors play tonight against the Los Angeles Clippers (April 13, 2025)?

Theface a high-stakes regular-season finale against the Los Angeles Clippers, but their chances took a hit withinjury status in question. The star guard suffered a thumb injury during Friday’s game against the Portland Trail Blazers, leaving his availability uncertain for Sunday’s critical matchup.Tonight’s game carries a ""Game 7"" intensity, with both teams fighting to avoid the Play-In Tournament. The Warriors (48-33) and Clippers are battling for the sixth seed in the Western Conference, and a win would secure Golden State’s direct playoff berth.Key implications for the Warriors:- A win clinches the sixth seed.- A loss forces them to rely on other results:- Utah Jazz must beat the Minnesota Timberwolves (both teams tied at 48-33).- If Jazz lose, the Houston Rockets must defeat the Denver Nuggets (49-32). Stephen Curry is listed as questionable for today’s crucial match against the Clippers. Curry’s absence would be a major blow for the Warriors. The 37-year-old has been instrumental in their second-half surge, averaging:Since acquiring Jimmy Butler at the trade deadline, Golden State has gone 23-8, but Stephen Curry’s leadership and scoring remain irreplaceable.While the Warriors sweat over Curry’s status, the Clippers are expected to have most of their rotation available. This puts Golden State at a significant disadvantage if their star guard sits.The Warriors vs Clippers tips off at 3:30 p.m. ET, capping off a full slate of NBA games on the final day of the regular season. The outcome will shape the playoff picture, making this a must-watch for basketball fans.Stephen Curry’s status will be updated closer to game time, but one thing is certain, and that is if he’s out, the Warriors face an uphill battle to secure their playoff spot.Also read: Stephen Curry demands ""Game 7 mentality"" as the Golden State Warriors face do-or-die clash with the Los Angeles Clippers: ""I don't want to be too dramatic!""

How did Kyren die? The fall of LSU football player Kyren Lacy

World Reacts To Kyren Lacy's Death

The Fallout: LSU player dead amid public scrutiny



The painful reality of Kyren Lacy’s death



Kyren Lacy , a promising LSU wide receiver with dreams of an NFL career, is dead at 24. The news has rocked the sports world, leaving fans and players alike questioning: How did Kyren die? Lacy’s tragic passing follows a series of legal battles that tainted his once-spotless reputation, including charges of negligent homicide stemming from a fatal crash. As details emerge about the LSU football player’s struggles, his death serves as a painful reminder of the harsh realities facing young athletes under immense pressure.How did Kyren die? The answer traces back to a devastating chain of events that began months earlier. Kyren Lacy was no ordinary LSU football player—his explosive talent made him one of the most talked-about prospects ahead of the 2025 NFL Draft. But in December 2024, everything changed. Lacy was involved in a fatal car crash on LA Highway 20 while driving a 2023 Dodge Charger. Authorities say he was speeding and illegally passing vehicles when he collided with 78-year-old Army veteran Herman Hall, who tragically lost his life. Lacy faced multiple serious charges, including negligent homicide, felony hit-and-run, and reckless operation of a vehicle.The aftermath of the crash was nothing short of a nightmare for Lacy. As the LSU football player faced mounting legal troubles, he became the target of media scrutiny. His arrest and the circulation of his mugshot painted a grim picture, and the young athlete was quickly judged in the court of public opinion.Despite the chaos surrounding him, Lacy kept fighting to maintain his NFL dreams. He participated in LSU’s Pro Day in March 2025, showcasing his skills to NFL scouts. But with the weight of the charges looming over him, it seemed as if Lacy’s future in football was slipping away. Then came the devastating news: Kyren Lacy passed away in Houston, with sources suggesting suicide as the likely cause. The LSU football community was left in shock, with questions swirling about how the immense pressure of the legal battle, combined with public judgment, could have led to such a heartbreaking outcome.Lacy’s lawyer has publicly criticized the media and the NFL for their handling of his case, blaming the negative coverage and the lack of support for contributing to his tragic end. In a statement, the lawyer called attention to how the public narrative around Lacy had been shaped before he was even given a chance to defend himself. The statement suggested that the relentless media frenzy played a crucial role in the mental toll that may have led to the LSU player’s death.Also Read: Justin Fields and the Jets: Why the search for long-term quarterback isn’t over Kyren Lacy’s death is more than just the loss of an LSU football player, it’s a stark reminder of the immense pressure facing young athletes, especially when their every move is scrutinized by the media. While we may never fully understand what led to Lacy’s decision, Kyren Lacy’s story is a tragic tale of a rising star, a legal battle, and the unbearable weight of public opinion. The LSU football community will never forget the young player whose life was taken far too soon.","Kyren Lacy, a promising LSU wide receiver with dreams of an NFL career, is dead at 24.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

NEW DELHI: In a jaw-dropping finish at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday, Delhi Capitals imploded with three successive run-outs to hand Mumbai Indians a thrilling 12-run win in a high-octane IPL 2025 clash.Chasing 206, Delhi were well placed at 183/7 with 23 runs needed off the final 12 balls. But chaos unfolded when Ashutosh Sharma, who had reignited hope with two crisp boundaries off Jasprit Bumrah , was run out going for a risky second.Off the very next ball, confusion led to Kuldeep Yadav's dismissal at the non-striker’s end, and the final delivery of the 19th over saw Mohit Sharma run out for a duck — ending Delhi’s chase in unbelievable fashion.It marked Delhi’s first defeat of the season after four consecutive wins, while Mumbai Indians celebrated only their second win in six matches.Earlier, comeback man Karun Nair dazzled with a 40-ball 89 in his first IPL appearance since 2022, stitching a 119-run stand with Abishek Porel (33) that had put Delhi firmly in control. But leg-spinner Karn Sharma (3-36) turned the tide by dismissing Porel, Tristan Stubbs and KL Rahul in quick succession.Mumbai’s 205/5 was set up by Tilak Varma’s 59 and Suryakumar Yadav’s fluent 40. Ryan Rickelton (41) and Naman Dhir (38*) provided crucial support. Rohit Sharma’s struggles continued, managing just 18 and extending his poor run to 56 runs in five games.In the end, it was the mayhem of three run-outs that sealed Delhi’s fate in one of the most dramatic climaxes of IPL 2025.","Delhi Capitals imploded with three successive run-outs to hand Mumbai Indians a thrilling 12-run win in a high-octane IPL 2025 clash.

MS Dhoni returns as CSK Captain, confirms coach Stephen Fleming

Poll Should CSK consider more young talents like Mhatre in the future? Only if they perform well in trials. No, experience is more important. Absolutely, youth brings energy.

'Things can turn around quickly': Hussey after CSK's fifth straight defeat

Ayush Mhatre is likely to join the Chennai Super Kings camp for the remainder of the Indian Premier League (IPL). It has been reliably learnt by TimesofIndia.com that the 17-year-old opener will link up with the squad ahead of CSK 's fixture against Mumbai Indians on April 20. As reported by TOI on April 3, Mhatre had been called up by the franchise for mid-season trials in Chepauk . He had gone unsold during the mega auction in Jeddah last year.But with Ruturaj Gaikwad ruled out for the remainder of the season, Mhatre has thrown his candidature in the ring for the five-time champions.Gaikwad was ruled out of the rest of the IPL season with an elbow injury with MS Dhoni taking over the captaincy duties. CSK have had a disastrous season with one win from six matches and are sitting bottom of the points table.The injury to Gaikwad was confirmed by CSK head coach Stephen Fleming on the eve of their eventual loss to Kolkata Knight Riders. The 28-year-old picked up the injury during CSK's match against Rajasthan Royals in Guwahati on March 30. He was struck on his elbow when charging to a Tushar Deshpande delivery, but continued batting and scored 63 in that game.Gaikwad played two more matches after that, scoring 5 and 1 against Delhi Capitals and Punjab Kings, respectively.With the regular CSK captain out of contention, the Chennai management have seemingly shifted focus towards Mhatre as an injury replacement.Mhatre had earlier joined the CSK camp in Chennai from Rajkot, where he was part of BCCI's National Cricket Academy's zonal camp for Under-19 cricketers.“Yes, we’ve called him for trials. He has impressed our talent scouts,” CSK MD & CEO Kasi Viswanathan had told TOI.The youngster had a fine debut season for Mumbai in 2024-25, scoring 458 runs in seven matches @ 65.42, with two hundreds and one fifty in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, and 471 runs in eight matches @ 33.64 with two centuries and one fifty, with top score of 176 against Maharashtra in the Ranji Trophy.",Ayush Mhatre is likely to join the Chennai Super Kings camp for the remainder of the Indian Premier League (IPL) The 17-year-old opener will link up with the squad ahead of CSK's fixture against Mumbai Indians on April 20.

Rory McIlroy secured his first Masters victory and completed golf's career Grand Slam on Sunday at Augusta National , defeating Justin Rose in a sudden-death playoff with a four-foot birdie putt. The world number two from Northern Ireland overcame multiple setbacks during the final round, including squandering the solo lead three times, to join the elite group of players who have won all four major championships.McIlroy's historic triumph came after 17 attempts at the Masters, making him the sixth golfer alongside Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Gary Player, Gene Sarazen, and Ben Hogan to achieve the career Grand Slam.""It feels incredible. This is my 17th time here. I was wondering if it would ever be my time. I'm thrilled and so proud to be able to call myself a Masters champion,"" McIlroy said.The victory earned McIlroy a record $4.2 million prize from the tournament's $21 million purse, along with the coveted green jacket .""The last 10 years coming here with the burden of the Grand Slam on my shoulders and trying to achieve that, I'm sort of wondering what we're all going to talk about going into next year's Masters,"" McIlroy reflected.The dramatic finale unfolded when McIlroy needed a par on the 72nd hole to win but hit his approach into a greenside bunker and missed a five-foot par putt, forcing a playoff with Rose at 11-under 277.""My battle today was with myself. How I responded to setbacks, that's what I'll take from this week,"" McIlroy stated.In the playoff, Rose's approach landed 15 feet from the hole, while McIlroy placed his shot within four feet. After Rose missed his birdie attempt, McIlroy made his putt to clinch the victory.""I've dreamed about that moment for as long as I can remember,"" McIlroy said.The emotional win triggered an outpouring of feelings as McIlroy dropped to his knees on the 18th green, crying and later embracing his caddie Harry Diamond, wife, and daughter while fans chanted his name.""There was a lot of pent up emotion that came out on that 18th green. A moment like that makes all the years and all the close calls worth it,"" McIlroy shared.The 35-year-old's journey to victory included overcoming a double-bogey start that erased his initial two-shot lead, briefly falling behind Bryson DeChambeau before reclaiming the lead through two-shot swings on consecutive holes.""I would say it was 14 years in the making, from going out with a four-shot lead in 2011 and feeling I could have done something there,"" McIlroy recalled, referencing his previous Masters disappointment.McIlroy's final round of 73 included a double-bogey at the par-five 13th and a bogey at 14, but he responded with crucial birdies at the 15th and 17th holes.""It's the best day of my golfing life. I'm very proud of myself for never giving up and always fighting back,"" McIlroy declared.Rose mounted a strong challenge with a closing round of 66, including birdies on six of the last eight holes, but ultimately fell short in the playoff.The victory marked McIlroy's third title of the year, following wins at The Players Championship and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, bringing his career US PGA Tour victories to 29.",Rory McIlroy won the Masters golf tournament for the first time on Sunday.

The Hardik Pandya-led Mumbai Indians have already arrived in the capital and are currently training in the city.However, their preparations were affected as Delhi and surrounding NCR regions experienced a sudden dip in temperature on Friday, accompanied by dusty storms for the second consecutive day. The weather disrupted flight operations at the Delhi airport, leading to multiple delays and diversions — and even impacted Mumbai Indians’ practice session.In a video shared by the Mumbai Indians on their social media platforms, star batter Rohit Sharma is seen reacting humorously to the incoming storm. As strong winds hit the stadium, Rohit can be heard shouting “comeback” to his teammates. He then playfully tells the cameraman to focus on the storm instead of him.(Hey, why are you filming me? Shoot the storm instead),"" Rohit says in the clip.Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for Delhi on April 11, with temperatures expected to range between 23°C and 38°C.While the storms caused disruption, the overcast skies and cooler winds brought a brief respite from the heatwave that had gripped the region over the past week.Delhi Capitals remain the only unbeaten side in the tournament so far with four wins from four matches.Mumbai Indians, on the other hand, are struggling at the bottom half of the table — placed eighth with just one win and four defeats in five games.","Delhi Capitals host Mumbai Indians in their IPL 2025 clash on Sunday.

So yeah, he will be a big miss,"" Dhoni said during the toss.""(On the importance of winning this game) It is important now, every game is important. We have lost too many matches and now it is important to do the basics right - have dot balls, take our catches. A couple of games we lost by big margins, but otherwise it was about the small things - about one over going for 20 runs. Our batters are more authentic as batters, they won't slog everything.

NEW DELHI: Spinner Karn Sharma starred with the ball, returning figures of 3 for 36, as Mumbai Indians pulled off a thrilling 12-run win over Delhi Capitals at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday, ending Delhi’s unbeaten run in the ongoing IPL 2025 season.Chasing a steep 206-run target, Delhi were cruising at 135 for 2 with Karun Nair anchoring the chase. But the game turned on its head after Nair’s dismissal for a sensational 89, triggering a late collapse that saw Delhi bowled out for 193. Mumbai, who had only one win from five games before this, secured a much-needed second win of the season.Needing 23 off the final 12 balls, Delhi found a glimmer of hope when Ashutosh Sharma cracked two boundaries off Jasprit Bumrah. However, the last three balls of the 19th over brought chaos as three run-outs derailed Delhi’s hopes and brought Mumbai roaring back into the contest.Nair, playing his first IPL match in three years, was a standout for Delhi. The 33-year-old came in as an impact substitute after Jake Fraser-McGurk fell to the first ball and lit up the Kotla with a 40-ball 89, including a 22-ball fifty – his first IPL half-century in seven years. His 119-run partnership with Abishek Porel (33) laid a strong foundation before Karn Sharma’s introduction changed the course of the match.Karn, also an impact substitute, broke the crucial stand by removing Porel and then dismissed Tristan Stubbs and KL Rahul in quick succession to tilt the momentum in Mumbai’s favour. Mitchell Santner also chipped in, bowling Nair to deliver a massive blow to Delhi’s chase.Earlier, Mumbai posted an imposing 205 for 5, thanks to a fluent 59 from Tilak Varma and a vital unbeaten 38 from Naman Dhir. The innings was built on a brisk start provided by Ryan Rickelton (41) and Rohit Sharma (18), though the latter once again failed to convert, falling lbw to Vipraj Nigam. Rohit now has just 56 runs from five matches.Suryakumar Yadav added a quick 40 off 28 and stitched a 60-run stand with Varma before Kuldeep Yadav struck twice, removing Rickelton and Suryakumar. Nigam then removed Hardik Pandya cheaply, but the Varma-Dhir stand ensured Mumbai crossed the 200-run mark.The win lifts Mumbai’s morale and keeps their playoff hopes alive, while Delhi remain second in the table with their first defeat of the season.","Mumbai Indians beat Delhi Capitals by 12 runs in IPL 2025.

After that, Kohli bossed the proceedings with his unbeaten 62 off 45 balls, including 4 fours and 2 sixes, and an 83-run unbroken stand with Devdutt Padikkal (40* of 28 balls).The half-century is Kohli's 100th in T20s, making him the only Asian player to achieve the feat.The victory kept RCB unbeaten in away matches so far this season and pushed them up to No. 3 on the points table with eight points from four wins, while RR stayed at the seventh spot with four points from six matches.RCB's bowling-first strategy proved effective on a pitch with inconsistent bounce and low carry, despite Yashasvi Jaiswal's impressive 75 runs from 47 deliveries, contributing to Rajasthan's final score of 173/4.The batting conditions were challenging with a sluggish surface, yet Salt's aggressive response caught the home team off guard.Salt demonstrated his aggressive intentions immediately, scoring a six off Jofra Archer's first over via a top edge, while also surviving a close leg before wicket appeal.His strategic movement across the stumps to target the leg side helped him achieve his second half-century of the tournament in 28 deliveries, reducing the target to under 100 runs by the eighth over.He had some lucky moments during his innings. At 23 runs, his powerful shot narrowly escaped Sandeep Sharma's stretched hands during a difficult caught and bowled attempt.Subsequently, when he reached 40, Jaiswal failed to hold onto a difficult catch at cover, which also presented a run-out opportunity that wasn't capitalised upon. These missed chances proved costly for the Royals.Kohli adopted a supporting role initially, starting with a measured approach of seven runs from his first six deliveries.He too had a fortunate moment early on when Riyan Parag failed to hold onto a straightforward catch at mid-off from Sandeep's slower delivery. However, RCB's star batter quickly regained his composure.Together, they scored 65 runs during the powerplay phase.Following Salt's departure, RCB required 82 runs from 68 deliveries. Subsequently, Kohli took control, crafting his innings with 25 singles while selecting his boundary opportunities with precision.He achieved his remarkable 100th T20 half-century in spectacular fashion, advancing down the pitch to dispatch Wanindu Hasaranga for a six straight over the bowler's head. That particular over, the 15th of the innings, produced 14 runs, reducing the target to a manageable 28 runs from 30 balls, effectively securing the outcome.Earlier, the young Jaiswal, aged 23, demonstrated excellent technique on a challenging surface, striking 10 fours and 2 sixes while his teammates found scoring difficult.He completed his second half-century of the tournament in 35 deliveries and put together a brisk 56-run partnership with Riyan Parag (30 off 18).Parag showed promise with one six and three fours but failed to capitalise after being dropped by Dayal at point when on 13.His innings concluded when he mistimed Dayal's well-concealed slower delivery, offering a catch to Kohli positioned at short cover.Sanju Samson struggled during his brief innings of 13 from 16 deliveries, facing difficulty against accurate bowling. Although he escaped an early run-out opportunity, his innings ended when Krunal Pandya had him stumped.Jaiswal maintained momentum with creative shot selection, successfully executing lap shots and reverse sweeps.His aggressive intent was evident when he scooped Hazlewood for a six over fine leg, but the same bowler dismissed him shortly after when he attempted a sweep shot and was adjudged leg before wicket.During the death overs, Dhruv Jurel remained unbeaten on 35 from 23 balls, providing the final flourish.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) beat Rajasthan Royals (RR) by nine wickets in Indian Premier League (IPL) match at Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur on Sunday.
