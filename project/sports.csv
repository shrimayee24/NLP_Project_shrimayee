ICC Women's T20 World Cup: India's semi-final chances stay afloat after narrow win against Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-womens-t20-world-cup/icc-womens-t20-world-cup-indias-semi-final-chances-stay-afloat-after-narrow-win-against-pakistan/articleshow/113988559.cms,"BCCI Photo

NEW DELHI: Indian skipper Harmanpreet Kaur 's experience helped secure a six-wicket victory for India against Pakistan in the Women's T20 World Cup, keeping their semi-final hopes alive on Sunday. Chasing a modest target of 106 runs, India struggled but managed to clinch the win thanks to Harmanpreet's 24-ball 29-run innings. She retired hurt with two runs needed to win, and Sajana Sajeevan, on her debut, sealed the victory with a boundary.Opener Shafali Verma (32 off 35 balls) and No.3 Jemimah Rodrigues (23 off 28 balls) adopted a cautious approach, affecting India's Net Run Rate (NRR) negatively.India's current NRR stands at -1.217, below Pakistan's -0.555. To keep semi-final hopes alive, India must win against Australia and Sri Lanka by significant margins.The Indian innings included only five boundaries, and the top three batters struggled to accelerate. With Smriti Mandhana out early, Shafali and Jemimah focused on singles.The heat impacted the running between the wickets, with easy doubles and triples left unattempted. Shafali's fitness issues and Jemimah's reliance on timing over power added pressure on the batting unit.Harmanpreet took charge after the dismissal of Jemimah and Richa Ghosh off consecutive deliveries by Fatima.Earlier, Indian bowlers contained Pakistan to 105 for 8. Renuka Singh Thakur (1/23) and Arundhati Reddy (3/19) maintained discipline in their line and length. Off-spinners Deepti Sharma (1/24) and Shreyanka Patil (2/12) focused on varying their pace.Leg-spinner Asha Sobhana (1/24) took the wicket of Pakistan skipper Fatima, thanks to a sharp catch by Richa Ghosh.India restricted Pakistan to 29 for 2 in the powerplay. Nida Dar's 28 runs provided some resistance but were insufficient to post a challenging total. Indian bowlers delivered 58 dot balls, reflecting their control over the game.India now needs to capitalize on this win and maintain momentum in their upcoming matches to advance to the semi-finals.","India beat Pakistan by six wickets to keep semi-final hopes alive.

The behind-the-scenes stories from India's T20 World Cup title win earlier this year continue to roll out and entertain the fans, and the one shared by all-rounder Axar Patel on a TV show left the fans in splits.India defeated South Africa by seven runs in a thrilling final in June to become the T20 champions for the second time, after winning the trophy first in the tournament's inaugural edition in 2007.The victory followed emotional scenes on the field, with the players sharing their feelings. While the Indian team was understandably over the moon, the South Africans were left gutted to let the win slip out of their hands while being well on course.But fast bowler Mohammed Siraj and Axar were facing a problem while everyone was celebrating, and the latter revealed that during an episode of the comedy series 'The Great Indian Kapil Show'.Siraj hilariously told his teammates what made him and Axar nervous even after India had won the title.""Siraj told everyone, 'Arre DK bhai ne mera English mei interview le liya.

Rishabh Pant's Masterclass: How India conquered the fortress Gabba,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/rishabh-pants-masterclass-how-india-conquered-the-fortress-gabba/articleshow/113985204.cms,"(Photo by Bradley Kanaris/Getty Images)

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant 's unbeaten 89* at the Gabba in 2021 is a story of courage, resilience, and the unflinching spirit of Indian cricket. It was January 19, 2021, the final day of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , and the stakes couldn't have been higher.India were in a series decider against Australia at the Gabba, a fortress for the Aussies where they hadn't lost a Test in 32 years.Adding to the challenge, India were ravaged by injuries and had fielded a team without several of their key players, including captain Virat Kohli The situation seemed daunting. India needed to chase down a massive target of 328 on a pitch showing signs of wear and tear. Australia's bowling attack - featuring Pat Cummins , Josh Hazlewood, and Mitchell Starc - was among the best in the world. The odds were stacked against India, and for many, even a draw would have been a moral victory.But Pant, a 23-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman known for his audacious stroke play, had other plans. Having already shown glimpses of his potential in Sydney a few days earlier, where his attacking 97 helped India salvage a memorable draw, Pant walked into the middle with a sense of purpose.The chase didn't start smoothly for India, with key wickets falling at regular intervals. At one point, India looked vulnerable at 167 for 3. However, Pant's arrival at the crease alongside Cheteshwar Pujara signaled a turning point. While Pujara blunted the Australian attack with his dogged resistance, Pant took the more aggressive route, counter-attacking the bowlers in his characteristic style.As the final session approached, the tension was palpable. Every run was fiercely contested, every ball felt like a battle. Pant, however, was unfazed by the pressure. He played with remarkable composure, mixing caution with aggression. He found the gaps, took calculated risks, and kept India's hopes alive. The Australian bowlers, who had dominated throughout the series, were suddenly on the back foot.With the target within sight and the game inching towards its climax, Pant unleashed a flurry of boundaries, taking India closer to an improbable victory. The defining moment came when Pant drove Josh Hazlewood through long-off for a boundary, sealing a historic win for India. His unbeaten 89* was not just a match-winning knock; it was the embodiment of India's fighting spirit throughout the series.As Pant roared in celebration, the entire cricketing world acknowledged the significance of his innings. India had pulled off a miraculous victory at the Gabba, winning the series 2-1 and retaining the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. The unbeaten 89* became the stuff of legend, a story that would be told for generations to come - a symbol of India's resilience and Pant's fearless brand of cricket.","Rishabh Pant's unbeaten 89* at the Gabba in 2021 is a story of courage, resilience, and the unflinching spirit of Indian cricket.

India got the much-needed win over Pakistan in the women's T20 World Cup on Sunday, but remained below their archrivals in Group A at the fifth position, separated by net run rate (NRR), which left former India batsman Sanjay Manjrekar ""a little disappointed"".Chasing Pakistan's below-par 105 for 8, India took 18.5 overs to complete the six-wicket win and ended up with an NRR of -1.217.Pakistan, who also have three points from a win and a loss in their two matches, are at number three with an NRR of +0.555.Manjrekar felt India must be realising now that they could have been a little more aggressive in their run-chase.""A bittersweet win for India,"" said Manjrekar while analysing the game on a post-match show on Star Sports.He said that it's table-topper New Zealand that India will have to catch.""Winning is very important, but I am a little disappointed because if you see New Zealand's run-rate, it's +2.900, and that's the team India need to catch up with. It will be difficult to catch Australia,"" he said, kind of predicting that Australia will end up topping the group.The Aussies, with two points and an NRR +1.908 after their win in the opener, are currently at number two. Sri Lanka at fifth spot with two consecutive defeats complete the Group A table.Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur was the only Indian batter who could score at a strike-rate of above 100.00. She made 29 off 24 balls before walking off retired hurt with a neck injury.Opener Shafali Verma top-scored with 32 off 35 balls, while Jemimah Rodrigues contributed 23 off 28 balls.""India did win, but inside Harmanpreet will be feeling that they should have scored a little more briskly and won in a quicker time. It would have benefitted in the long run,"" Manjrekar analysed.Speaking at the post-match presentation, opener Smriti Mandhana admitted that India's start with the bat could have been better.""We could have done with a better start with the bat,"" said Mandhana, who scored only 7 in the match played at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.""But we will take this. We were thinking about it (NRR) but Shafali and I weren't able to time it (the shots) well. So we didn't want to get to a place where we were chasing the game, but NRR is surely in our heads. This game will give us some momentum and hopefully we can keep going in this tournament,"" the opening batter added.About the nature of Harmanpreet's injury, Mandhana said: ""Too soon to say anything, the medics are looking at it. Hopefully she is alright.""","India beat Pakistan by six wickets in the women's T20 World Cup on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Harmanpreet Kaur-led India are gearing up to face New Zealand in their opening Group A match of the Women's T20 World Cup at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Friday. This marks the ninth edition of the tournament, with India still chasing their maiden T20 World Cup title. Their closest opportunity came in 2020 when they reached the final but were defeated by a dominant Australian side at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.Determined to put past disappointments behind them, India will look for a strong start to their campaign as they set their sights on erasing the memories of previous near-misses.Ahead of India's opening clash against New Zealand in Dubai, TimesofIndia.com spoke with Harmanpreet during an event hosted by Puma India. The Indian captain shared her thoughts on the team's title prospects, potential combinations, and more. Edited excerpts:You are putting pressure on us by saying this (laughs). We are really excited and want to give our best. The team has done really well and prepared a lot for this big tournament. We will not leave a single stone unturned. We are positive, and I am confident we will come through with flying colors.Yes, hopefully. That's our aim. As I said, we are prepared, we are positive, and we just want to go out and give our best. We always talk in the dressing room about how this is a great opportunity for us. I tell my team one thing: go and enjoy your game. That's it.If you ask me as a captain, all players are equally important to me. They have different roles to play on the field, and I know what they can bring to the table. For me, every single player is important. Whoever is in the middle must take responsibility and win the game for us.Earlier, the tournament was going to be played in Bangladesh, and now it will be held in the UAE. The conditions will be tough, and I will adjust the combinations accordingly.That's quite natural. It's not something exaggerated or out of the box. The aggression in me is natural. It drives me forward, and that’s how I've always been. Whenever I'm on the field, I just want to see my team win. This is the mindset I’ve played with throughout.Yes. She is the heart of the team. She’s always cheerful and ensures the dressing room environment remains lively. She keeps a big smile on every single player's face. It's really good to have her on the side. It's always great to have such players who bring energy to the team and the dressing room.It’s helping us a lot, just like the IPL helps men’s cricket. We've been waiting for this league for so many years. It's a massive platform for all women's cricketers. The WPL is a great stage and has brought a lot of talent to Indian cricket.

Varun makes strong comeback, Mayank, Nitish shine on debut

GWALIOR: Dominating from start to finish on Sunday night, a new-look Team India, which fielded two debutants in express pacer Mayank Yadav and allrounder Nitish Kumar Reddy, thrashed Bangladesh by seven wickets, with 49 balls to spare, thus taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match T20I series.After folding up the visitors for 127 in 19.5 overs, India cantered to the target in the 12th over, as Hardik Pandya (39 off 16 balls), skipper Suryakumar Yadav (29, 18b, 2x4, 3x6), and opener Sanju Samson (29, 19b, 6x4) all looked in a hurry to return to the team hotel.The electric atmosphere at the packed Shrimant Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Stadium, which was making its international debut, deserved a better contest. Still, watching an international match after 14 years in this city offered much delight to the 30,000 fans at the venue.Earlier, Arshdeep Singh (3-14 in 3.5 overs) delivered another stellar spell. Playing his first game for India in three years, spinner Varun Chakravarthy (3-31 in four overs) made a successful comeback, while Yadav (1-21 in four overs) made an impressive debut. India, hardly putting a step wrong after choosing to field first, shot out a disappointing Bangladesh for a paltry total.Dropped after failing to take a wicket in three games in the T20 World Cup in the UAE in October-November 2021, Chakravarthy, battling the perception of being a poor fielder, has continued to impress in the IPL for the Kolkata Knight Riders and made a case for a recall. A solid performance in IPL 2024-he was the top wicket-taker for KKR (21 wickets @19.14)- finally helped the 33-year-old earn a much-deserved second chance in this format.Chakravarthy could have had a wicket with just his second ball, but Reddy, who along with Yadav made his India debut in this match, dropped a sitter at deep midwicket after sprinting in, unable to sight the ball properly, allowing Towhid Hridoy (12) a reprieve in the fifth over.However, the tweaker had his man in the next over, as Hridoy pulled him straight to Pandya at long on. Buoyed by his first strike, Chakravarthy unleashed a terrific googly that went through the 'gate' of a bamboozled Jaker Ali (8). He then rounded off his night with the scalp of Rishad Hossain (11).The other heartening sight for this new look Indian team was the successful initiation of Yadav into international cricket after the tearaway pacer had been out of the game since April due to a side strain injury. Asked to bowl one change, the 22-year-old Delhi lad started off with a maiden over in the powerplay-the fifth over of the innings.While he didn't clock 150-plus pace, Yadav did rev it up to 149 kmph. Most importantly, he was as accurate as he showed himself to be in the IPL and employed clever changes of pace. Veteran batsman Mahmudullah (1) tried to attack him but ended up spooning a catch to Washington Sundar at deep point in the eighth over.Having begun in his usual fashion with two strikes in his first two overs, Arshdeep, who now leads India's T20 attack in Jasprit Bumrah 's absence, terminated Bangladesh's innings, uprooting Mustafizur Rahman's (1) stumps with a yorker. Since January 2022, this left-arm pacer has taken 86 T20I wickets for India-the most by any Indian bowler in this period.Coming off a two-and-a-half-day thrashing in the Kanpur Test just days ago, Bangladesh continued their poor form, slumping to 75 for six in 12 overs when they lost their captain Najmul Shanto (27, 25b, 1x6, 1x4). They looked in danger of being skittled out for under 100. Coming in at No 7, which is too low for a batsman of his ability, allrounder Mehidy Hasan Miraz (35 not out, 32b, 3x4), making a T20I comeback, rescued the woeful visitors, helping them reach some respectability.","Varun makes strong comeback, Mayank, Nitish shine on debut for India. Hardik Pandya (39 off 16 balls), Suryakumar Yadav (29, 18b, 2x4, 3x6) and opener Sanju Samson all looked in a hurry to return to the team hotel.

NEW DELHI: India captain Suryakumar Yadav voiced his satisfaction with the team's performance after they flawlessly executed their plans in a comfortable seven-wicket victory over Bangladesh in the first T20I in Gwalior on Sunday.With this victory, India went 1-0 up in the three-match series with second and third matches being played on October 9 in Delhi and October 12 in Hyderabad.""We just tried to back our skills and what we decided in the team meeting, we just walked the talk. The way the guys showed their character on the field, first time playing on a new ground, and the way we batted, showed our character,"" Surya said during the post match presentation.Batter Nitish Kumar Reddy and fast bowler Mayank Yadav delivered decent performances on their debut, and skipper Suryakumar expressed his eagerness to see them in action in the upcoming matches.He also highlighted areas where the team would focus on making improvements before the next game.""Very excited and looking forward to seeing them in the next games. It's a good headache to have when you are on the field when you have extra bowling options. You always learn something new playing every game. There will be a few areas to improve, we'll sit down and talk about it before the next game,"" he added.India's Arshdeep Singh and the returning Varun Chakravarthy dismantled Bangladesh's batting lineup, paving the way for a commanding victory for the hosts.The left-arm pacer Arshdeep and spinner Chakravarthy each claimed three wickets, restricting Bangladesh to a modest 127.

If you take brave calls, then only you will win,"" said Basit.The 53-year-old Basit threw in the names of a few more Indian icons while stressing on the point that the Pakistan captain will have to turn the players he has at his disposal into winners.""You don't have a Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant, (Ravindra Jadeja) or 'Boom Boom' Bumrah.

GWALIOR: For the last three years-1066 days to be precise- since he was dropped from the Indian team after failing to take a wicket in three matches of India's disastrous 2021 T20 World Cup campaign in Dubai, 'mystery spinner' Varun Chakravarthy would look up for his name whenever the national selectors announced a squad for a T20I series.Having performed well in the IPL for the Kolkata Knight Riders consistently in this phase, Varun was naturally optimistic about his chances of an India recall in this format where his assortment of carrom balls, leg breaks, googlies, off-breaks and the one that goes straight through make him an ace in the pack, which few opponents have a clue about.Each time, the selection snub would leave him dejected, but fuelled him to try harder in domestic cricket. Slowly but surely, the fire burning inside and the grind in domestic cricket helped him find his mojo back.On Sunday night, playing his first India game in three years, Varun bowled beautifully, taking three for 31 in four overs -his career-best figures-to star in the hosts' seven-wicket romp over Bangladesh at the Shrimant Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Stadium. The 33-year-old took the wickets of Towhid Hridoy (pulled a flat delivery to Hardik Pandya at long on), Jaker Ali (bowled by a mesmerizing googly) and Rishad Hossain (top-edged to Pandya at deep-midwicket).Naturally, with emotions briming inside him, Varun told former India left-arm spinner Murali Kartik on the official broadcast after the game that playing for India again after a long gap felt like a ""rebirth."" ""After three long years and… it was definitely emotional for me, and it feels nice to be back in the Blues, it feels like a rebirth,"" Varun said.Varun first came into the limelight when he picked up 17 wickets, including a devastating spell of 5-20 against the Delhi Capitals in IPL-2020. In IPL-2021, appearing even more unplayable, he took 18 wickets in 17 games@24.88, at an economy rate of 6.58. His magnificent spin partnership with Sunil Narine was a major reason why the Kolkata Knight Riders reached the IPL-2021 final.However, after he took just two wickets in six T20Is, Varun was excluded. The perception that he is a liability on the field didn't help. Despite having performed well in the IPL for KKR, the tweaker played only his seventh T20I, and his first in India, on Sunday night. ""It has been a long three years and whenever there was a squad announced for a series, I used to feel like 'why is my name not there?' and I used to keep thinking about that. So that kind of brought the motivation within me that I should not leave this. I should go all out, and I should try to make a comeback. I started playing a lot of domestic games and I started giving importance to it. That kind of helped me,"" Varun said at the post-match press conference.Explaining how a technical adjustment helped him find his rhythm back, Varun said, ""I used to be a side-spin bowler but right now, I have completely shifted to an over-spin bowler which is a minute technical aspect of spin bowling. From side spin to over spin, it took me more than two years. In these three years, the major chunk of work which I put in was in my technical aspect.""Being a spinner from Tamil Nadu, Varun was bound to be influenced by India's off-spin ace in Test cricket, Ravichandran Ashwin . Revelling while playing under Ashwin in the recently-concluded Tamil Nadu Premier League, Varun helped the Ashwin-captained Dindigul Dragons win the trophy, taking 12 wickets (joint-highest for his team along with pacer Sandeep Warrier) at an impressive economy of 6.61, including two for 26 in the final. ""It's (TNPL) is a very good tournament and of a high standard as well. That's a place where I work a lot, with Ash (Ashwin) bhai also, we won the championship there so that gave me confidence here. I just played it a few months ago. It was good preparation for this series,"" he told the broadcasters.2024, of course, has been kind to Varun. His fabulous performances in the IPL and the TNPL haven't gone unnoticed, and he has finally earned an India recall. Varun had played a massive role in making India coach Gautam Gambhir 's last assignment, as the KKR mentor, successful, taking 21 wickets in 14 matches, the second-highest tally of the season, to help the Shah Rukh Khan-owned franchise emerge as champions in IPL-2024 trophy. Clearly, Gambhir and India's assistant coach Abhishek Nayar, who too was earlier with KKR in the same capacity, have a fair idea of the value that Varun brings to the table. The spinner said he hasn't interacted much with Gambhir so far.""He is a man of few words, so we didn't talk much during our time in KKR. We only used to talk about the game. However, this is my first match with him. So, I am waiting to spend more time with him,"" he said.On the spilled chance at deep square leg by debutant Nitish Kumar Reddy off his bowling in his first over, Varun said it's part of the game. ""I am very happy to contribute towards the team. Yes, in the first over the catch could have gone my way but that's how T20s are played. I felt the reverse-sweep six was a good ball but it still went for a six, so it's all mixed emotions.""","Varun Chakravarthy was dropped from India's T20 team after failing to take a wicket in three matches of the 2021 T20 World Cup. The 33-year-old bowled beautifully, taking three for 31 in four overs -his career-best figures- to star in the hosts' seven-wicket romp over Bangladesh at the Shrimant Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Stadium.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113998437,imgsize-43616,width-400,resizemode-4/113998437.jpg"

GWALIOR: Mayank Yadav bowled with rattling pace in a promising debut while mystery spinner Varun Chakaravarthy made an impressive comeback to set up India's dominating seven-wicket win over Bangladesh in the series-opening T20 here on Sunday.India, oozing with fresh talent, bundled out Bangladesh for a below par 127 before the batters played an array of audacious strokes to gun down the target in 11.5 overs.The starts with the ball was rookie Mayank and Varun while sizzling cameos from Sanju Samson (29 off 19), skipper Suryakumar Yadav (29 off 14) and Hardik Pandya (39 not out off 16 ) ensured a breezy chase for the hosts.A full house at the newly built Shrimant Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Stadium witnessed high quality bowling from India and largely ordinary batting from their opponents.All eyes were on Mayank (1/21) ever since he marked his run up before toss and the 22-year-old from Delhi did not disappoint in his first competitive game in more than five months.Having attracted global eyeballs for consistently bowling in the 150kmph range during the IPL, Mayank was able to generate serious pace in his opening spell of 2-1-3-1. His first over was a maiden.Having suffered a side strain shortly after a sensational IPL debut, there were question marks over his fitness in the long term but he dispelled some of those doubts on Sunday.Mayank was able to hit 145.7 kmph only in his second ball of the evening before hitting 148.7 kmph with the first ball of his second over.Veteran batter Mahmudullah was among the batters who were wary of his extra pace and ended up becoming the pacer's first international wicket. The 38-year-old tried to improvise by charging down the wicket but ended up slicing a regulation catch to Washington Sundar at deep point.Varun (3/31), brought back into the team after nearly three years, troubled the Bangladesh batters who failed to read him. Among them was middle-order batter Jaker Ali who had stumps his castled with a ball that turned back in.Like Mayank, Varun too was brought inside the powerplay. The mystery spinner bounced back after conceding 15 runs in his opening over by dismissing Towhid Hridoy (12).At 64 for five in 10 overs, Bangladesh's innings was going nowhere and India were able to press on the advantage thereafter.Mayank returned to bowl the 13th which went for 15 as Bangladesh batters used his extra pace to collect a six and four in the third man region. He ended his quota by bowling the 19th over which included a couple of yorkers.Left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh (3/14) had played his part his in the powerplay by removing openers Litton Das and Parvez Hossain Emon before picking his third wicket to end Bangladesh's innings. Mehidy Hasan Miraz was the top-scorer for the visitors with 35 not out off 32 balls.India came out to bat with uber aggressive intent with Abhishek Sharma (16 off 7) and Samson going hard from the get go. Promoted to the top of the order, Samson played a few delightful shots before falling to off-spinner Mehidy Hasan Miraz.Pick up shots off pacer Taskin Ahmed in the fifth over was the highlight of Suryakumar's innings. The result was a foregone conclusion when India raced to 71 for two in the powerplay. Debutant Nitish Reddy (16 not out off 15) and Hardik got the team home in a canter. Hardik went ballistic in the 12th over bowled by Taskin Ahmed to finish the game in style.A sell out crowd was in attendance as international cricket returned to Gwalior after 14 years. The stadium built in the outskirts of the city made its international debut.",Mayank Yadav bowled with rattling pace in a promising debut. Mystery spinner Varun Chakaravarthy made an impressive comeback. Mehidy Hasan Miraz was the top- scorer for the visitors with 35 not out off 32 balls.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113991340,imgsize-76702,width-400,resizemode-4/113991340.jpg"

This notable event took place during the Los Angeles Lakers ' preseason game against Phoenix at Acrisure Arena in the Coachella Valley.LeBron and Bronny are the first father and son to play in an NBA game simultaneously. This historic moment coincided with Bronny’s 20th birthday.Bronny entered the game as a substitute at the start of the second quarter, joining his father on the court.The crowd cheered upon hearing Bronny's name.LeBron is entering his 22nd NBA season. Bronny, drafted in the second round by the Lakers this summer, played one season at Southern California before joining the team. He recovered from cardiac arrest over a year ago.Their initial time on the court together saw some challenges. Bronny committed two turnovers and LeBron made another. LeBron then hit a 3-pointer and set up a screen for Bronny, who missed his 3-point attempt. Bronny was substituted 4:09 into the second quarter, and LeBron followed 25 seconds later.LeBron, who will turn 40 in December, is still performing at a high level. He has long spoken about his dream of playing in the NBA with one of his sons. The Lakers made this possible by drafting Bronny with the 55th pick.Bronny, at 6-foot-2, is expected to improve his skills with the South Bay Lakers of the G League but is likely to play alongside his 6-foot-9 father in the regular season. Lakers head coach JJ Redick stated, “We have discussed the logistics of the next historic moment.”LeBron rested during the Lakers’ preseason opener against Minnesota last Friday. Bronny scored two points and blocked three shots in 16 minutes in that game.The Lakers have four more preseason games before the regular season begins at home against Minnesota on Oct. 22.LeBron and his wife, Savannah Brinson, became parents to Bronny in 2004. They have two other children, Bryce and Zhuri.LeBron and Bronny have been preparing to play together by scrimmaging during Lakers’ training sessions. They have practiced as both teammates and opponents. Coach Redick mentioned that they “even run pick-and-rolls together in preparation.”In North American professional sports, few father-son duos have played together. Examples include Ken Griffey Sr. and Ken Griffey Jr. in MLB and Gordie Howe with his sons Marty and Mark in hockey.","LeBron and Bronny are the first father and son to play in an NBA game simultaneously.

Ricky Ponting reveals his pick for the 'most talented player' he has ever seen,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ricky-ponting-reveals-his-pick-for-the-most-talented-player-he-has-ever-seen/articleshow/113986001.cms,"(Photo by Robert Cianflone/Getty Images)

NEW DELHI: Former Australian great Ricky Ponting expressed his admiration for Jacques Kallis , a former South African all-rounder. During a conversation on Sky Sports Cricket on Saturday, Ponting declared Kallis as the ""most talented player"" he has ever witnessed.Ponting's high praise for Kallis stems from South African's exceptional all-round abilities and impressive statistics throughout his career.Despite his remarkable achievements, Ponting believes that Kallis is ""one of the most underrated players ever"" in the world of cricket.""I will say Jacques Kallis is the most talented player that I have ever seen because of his all-round game. I'm not just talking about a talented batsman; I am talking about a talented cricketer. Jacques Kallis made 44, 45 Test hundreds, probably 300 wickets, maybe more than that, and he would have an unbelievable catching record as well in Test cricket,"" said Ponting.The Australian legend noted that not many players consider him an all-time great.""I think he is one of the most underrated players ever that is played the game. I mean, I know he is rated; obviously, he should be, but not many people talk about him as being one of the all-time greats, and in my eyes, he certainly is,"" Ponting added.Kallis, in his illustrious career from 1995 to 2013, played 166 Test matches, amassing 13,289 runs at an impressive average of 55.37, with 45 centuries and 58 fifties across 280 innings. His highest score of 224 solidified his place as South Africa's highest Test run-scorer, ranking third globally behind Ricky Ponting of Australia (13,378 runs in 168 Tests) and India's Sachin Tendulkar (15,921 runs in 200 Tests).Kallis was also a valuable bowler, taking 292 wickets at an average of 32.65, with best figures of 6/54. He claimed five five-wicket hauls in Tests, making him South Africa's seventh-highest wicket-taker, with Dale Steyn leading at 439 wickets in 93 Tests.In One-Day Internationals (ODIs), from 1996 to 2014, Kallis scored 11,579 runs in 328 matches at an average of 44.36, with 17 centuries and 86 fifties, and a top score of 139. He was South Africa's leading run-scorer in ODIs, ranking eighth globally, with Tendulkar leading with 18,426 runs in 463 matches.With the ball, Kallis took 273 wickets in ODIs at an average of 31.79, including five-wicket hauls, with his best figures being 5/30. He stands as South Africa’s second-highest wicket-taker in ODIs, behind Shaun Pollock (387 wickets in 294 matches).In 25 T20 Internationals, Kallis scored 666 runs at an average of 35.05 and a strike rate of 119.35, with five half-centuries. He also took 12 wickets, with best bowling figures of 4/15.Overall, Kallis scored 25,534 runs in 519 international matches, with 62 centuries and 149 fifties, making him the sixth-highest run-scorer in international cricket. His 577 wickets across all formats also place him among South Africa’s top bowlers. Sachin Tendulkar remains the top run-getter with 34,357 runs in 664 matches.","Ricky Ponting says Jacques Kallis is the ""most talented player"" he has ever seen.

Aj Kay Din Indian Women's Kay Bad IPL XI Nay Bhi Bulldozed Kar Diya | Dream Deut By M Yadav

Impressed with India's dominating T20I win on Sunday, former Pakistan batsman Basit Ali also wondered what happened to the Bangladesh team that registered a historic Test series win in Pakistan before travelling to India.""Is this the same Bangladesh team that whitewashed Pakistan (2-0)? You saw in the Test matches (against India). They lost the first one and then were defeated in virtually two days, even the rain could not save them,"" said the 53-year-old Basit.India hammered Bangladesh by 280 runs in the Chennai Test and then won in Kanpur by seven wickets, despite two days getting washed out by rain, to sweep the series 2-0.Basit was particularly in awe of India's back-up strength, saying the team of young Indian Premier League (IPL) stars led by Suryakumar Yadav made Bangladesh look like an ""appetizer"".""India have changed cricket (with their dominance). Bangladesh is just an appetizer (for them),"" said Basit.The T20I retirement of Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja has thrown open spots in the playing XI.""Yeh IPL eleven hai, India ki team nahi hai,"" said Basit, before pointing at the notable absentees from India's playing eleven in the match atGwalior . ""There was no (Yashasvi) Jaiswal, no (Shubman) Gill, no Axar Patel, no Rishabh Pant, no (Shreyas) Iyer; (Ravi) Bishnoi did not play. And still they hammered them in just 11-something overs, finishing with a six from (Hardik) Pandya.""India awarded two debut caps for the match, with fast bowler Mayank Yadav and all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy making their first international appearance.After bowling out Bangladesh for 127, India raced home in 11.5 overs for a seven-wicket win to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. Arshdeep Singh (3 for 14) and Varun Chakravarthy (3 for 31) took three wickets each, while Hardik top-scored for the hosts with his stroke-filled 39 off 16 balls, including 5 fours and 2 sixes.""Why did Suryakumar Yadav opt to bowl after winning the toss?"" Basit wondered. ""They should have batted on that 200-run flat track. I don't think they will make that mistake in the second match.""Basit was happy to see Mayank sending the speed gun into an overdrive and hoped he remains fit for India's tour of Australia. The speedster began his stint in the international arena with a maiden over while bowling at top speed.""There were two debuts, but it was a dream debut for Mayank Yadav. The first over was a maiden, including a 149.8 kmph delivery. He could not bowl in the high 150kmph only because he has just recovered from an injury,"" said Basit""Darr baithaya usne aaj (he sent down a scare). Batsmen were always on the back foot. I pray that this kid remains fit and goes on the Australia tour.""Mayank, (Mohammed) Shami, (Jasprit) Bumrah, (Mohammed) Siraj -- four pacers. Banaye Australia bouncy wicket, phir pata chalega (let them prepare bouncy pitches and find out).After the T20I series against Bangladesh, India will welcome New Zealand for a three-Test series before flying to Australia for the Border Gavaskar Trophy that will be contested over a series of five Test matches.","Former Pakistan batsman Basit Ali impressed with India's dominating T20I win.

Women's T20 World Cup: What happened to Harmanpreet Kaur against Pakistan?

What happened to Harmanpreet Kaur vs Pakistan?

Will Harmanpreet Kaur miss the match against Sri Lanka?

The Indian Women’s cricket team's victory over Pakistan in the Women's T20 World Cup 2024 was a thrilling encounter at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. Despite the triumph, the overshadowing concern of captain Harmanpreet Kaur's injury raises a critical question as the team looks ahead to their match against Sri Lanka.After winning the toss, Pakistan chose to bat but faced a robust Indian bowling lineup. Arundhati Reddy was the standout bowler , picking three wickets while conceding only 19 runs, effectively dismantling the Pakistani batting order.Renuka Singh and Shreyanka Patil played essential roles as well, contributing with timely wickets. Nida Dar's 28 runs were the highest for Pakistan, but overall, they managed just 105 runs.India’s chase began with a hiccup, losing opener Smriti Mandhana early. However, Shafali Verma and Harmanpreet Kaur steadied the innings, with Verma making 32 runs and Kaur adding 29 runs before an unfortunate injury forced her to retire hurt right before crossing the winning margin.Kaur's departure due to her neck injury sparked unease among fans and teammates alike. Her absence would considerably impact the team's strategy and stability, especially given her invaluable experience and leadership qualities.Mandhana, who spoke on the field after the win, reported that the medical team is evaluating Kaur, though specifics of the injury remain unclear.“It’s too soon to say anything. The medical team is looking at it,” she said.With India set to face Sri Lanka on 9 October , they are confronted by the dual challenge of bridging a negative net run rate while coping with Kaur's potential absence.Mandhana highlighted the threat posed by Sri Lanka, recognising their strong performance in the tournament so far.“They have been playing good cricket, but this game will give us the momentum,” she noted optimistically.","India Women's cricket team beat Pakistan in the Women's T20 World Cup 2024.

LUCKNOW: Like thousands who come to Mumbai in search of a livelihood, economic hardships forced Juned Khan to make the journey from Uttar Pradesh in 2014.Once in the city of dreams, his only aim was to make a living. Never in his wildest dreams did he imagine playing cricket, let alone representing Mumbai. But in a city that rewards hard work, Juned found his way and was handed his debut in the Irani Cup , which Mumbai lifted for the 15th time on Saturday.The icing on the cake was his debut at Lucknow's Ekana Stadium, just 145 km from his hometown of Kannauj. Many from Kannauj - including his brothers and friends -travelled daily to watch him in action. For the uninitiated, Kannauj is known as the perfume capital of India. ""Never thought I could play cricket at this level. I came to Mumbai to earn,"" said an ecstatic Juned as he clicked pictures with the Irani Cup trophy, celebrated with his teammates, and obliged those asking for a selfie.When Juned, now 25, first arrived in Mumbai, he initially worked as a helper at a local jeans factory in Andheri. Later, with the help of his friends, he started driving an auto rickshaw and lived in a chawl just outside Bandra station. The early years were tough but his will to fight through was stronger.The first time he began playing proper cricket was in 2019. His journey started at Sanjeevani Cricket Academy in Kherwadi, Bandra, which was close to where he stayed with his auto driver friends from UP. From there, he never looked back.""I had the urge to play cricket. I was always fond of bowling since childhood, so I started bowling in their nets. I didn't have enough money to buy spikes, so I played with rubber spikes for a couple of months. But when I was about to register at theMCA , the lockdown started, and I had to wait a couple of years to get it done,"" said Juned, who comes from a humble background.Once normalcy resumed, he soon found himself playing on Mumbai's famous maidaans. His fortunes took a turn for the better when he impressed India's assistant coach Abhishek Nayar during a Police Shield match at PJ Hindu Gymkhana .""He was impressed with my bowling and spoke to me about my issues after the match. He helped me a lot. He told me to stop driving the auto and focus on cricket. At that time, he told me, 'Tu khel, tera bowling accha hai, tu Ranji bhi khel sakta hai (you focus on cricket. Your bowling is good, and you can play Ranji). He is like a godfather to me,"" said Juned.""Soon, I started practicing with him at his academy. I was a net bowler for KKR in the last IPL. Slowly, I started performing in local tournaments in Mumbai, which got me selected to the probables list this season. I did well in the Buchi Babu tournament and then in the KSCA event, which led to my selection for the Irani Cup,"" he added.In local tournaments, he represents PJ Hindu Gymkhana. He still lives in the same locality in Bandra East, sharing space with five friends three of whom do deliveries for a food delivery app, while a couple of them drive autos.Juned, who idolizes Mohammed Shami , said: ""The day I came to know I'd be playing, I couldn't sleep for two days."" Mumbai will hope he channels the inner Shami in him to bring laurels to his adopted city.",Juned Khan made his debut for Mumbai in the Irani Cup on Saturday.

Arundhati, Kaur star as Pak put up strong fight in defence of 106

Hope flickers for the Women in Blue in the T20 World Cup, but only just. The Indian girls picked themselves up from the disappointment of a heavy defeat against New Zealand and beat Pakistan on Sunday at the Dubai International Stadium. But it was far from convincing, and more importantly, there was no significant improvement in India's Net Run Rate .India notched up the victory target of 106 with six wickets to spare, but in the process they took 18.5 overs. It left their NRR at - 1.21 and they are fourth on the Group A table. With only two to qualify from a group of five, India will have to win their next two games against Sri Lanka and Australia handsomely and hope that New Zealand falter too.Having said that, on Sunday it was a must-win game against Pakistan - a team that hasn't exactly matched India in women's cricket. The bowlers had laid the foundation for the win, with medium-pacer Arundhati Reddy leading the charge, picking up career best figures of 3-19. The other bowlers too kept it tight and the 58 dot balls stifled Pakistan.However, India's response with the bat wasn't without hiccups. Opener Smriti Mandhana fell cheaply, and a sluggish powerplay left India at 25-1. But young opening batterShafali Verma (32, 35b; 3x4) switched gears soon after, which helped India stay ahead in the asking rate.The No. 3 spot in the Indian team has been an issue of discussion with Harmanpreet Kaur taking over the duties in the first game. On Sunday, it was Jemimah Rodrigues, who was promoted to the spot, and she found her rhythm quickly. Shafali and Jemimah added 43 runs (off 44 balls) for the second wicket, which got India on track. Just when it appeared that India were cruising, Pakistan captain Fatima Sana struck twice in two balls, briefly rattling India.But, Harmanpreet (29, 24b 1x4), walking in at No. 4, stepped up and held the innings together, ensuring there were no further slip-ups. The Indian captain batted through the tense moments, but there was a late scare when she went down injured, with just two runs needed. S Sajana came in to complete the chase, guiding India to a nervy victory.While the batters just about did their job, it's the bowlers who deserve credit for this win. Seamer Arundhati was impeccable with his line and length, ensuring Pakistan never settled. ""I have worked a lot on my T20 bowling. I just wanted to hit the stumps more, use my variations and slower ones. That worked for me,"" 27-year-old Arundhati said after the win.It began with pacer Renuka Singh, who struck in the very first over, sending back Gull Feroza with a sharp inswinger. And then Sidra Amin, one of the more experienced batters, was deceived by Deepti Sharma 's tossed-up offspinner, that spun back in, as Pakistan lost two crucial wickets in the powerplay.Omaima Sohail and Muneeba Ali tried to rebuild the innings, but the pressure of dot balls mounted, and wickets continued to fall. At this point, Arundhati's clever bowling accounted for Omaima, putting India firmly in control.Rising talent Shreyanka Patil (2-12), claimed her maiden World Cup wicket with a well-directed delivery that surprised Muneeba with extra bounce.As Pakistan's wickets tumbled, it was left to former skipper Nida Dar (28, 34b; 1x4) to anchor the innings. She held firm, but with little support from the other end, even her efforts couldn't rescue the innings. Skipper Sana showed a brief glimpse of aggression with two consecutive boundaries, but her stay was cut short by a moment of brilliance from India's wicketkeeper Richa Ghosh, who plucked a one-handed stunner off Asha Sobhana's bowling to remove her. By the time Syeda Aroob Shah and Nashra Sandhu added some useful runs towards the end, the damage had already been done.",Arundhati Reddy takes career best 3-19 as India beat Pakistan by six wickets.

DUBAI: Seam-bowling all-rounder Arundhati Reddy ’s first stint in the Indian team saw her play 26 T20Is from 2018 to 2021, and took 18 wickets, before going down the pecking order. But Arundhati forced a return to the Indian team this year and the comeback hit its crescendo when she took career-best figures of 3-19 and played a major hand in the side’s six-wicket win over Pakistan in the Women's T20 World Cup at Dubai International Stadium on Sunday.Now with the Player of the Match medallion, Arundhati talked of the efforts she put in her time away from the Indian team to be a more complete T20 bowler . “Honestly, the last couple of years I've tried to really work on my bowling as a complete T20 bowler. Again, there's a lot of work that's gone behind it, because I wanted to be a bowler who can bowl in all phases.”“I look forward to being that bowler who can bowl in all phases. So, the preparation has been accordingly as per it and it's something that I've been working on for two years. So, I know I'm a lot prepared as of now. I know I'm confident enough to that I can deliver for the team as and when it's required. So that's about it,” she said in the post-match press conference.Apart from two seasons of being with Delhi Capitals in the Women’s Premier League (WPL), where she became a mainstay with the ball, Arundhati also made a daring move to switch from Railways to Kerala in domestic cricket, something which benefitted her immensely.With guidance from former India women’s fielding coach Biju George, who holds same role in the DC setup, and Arjun Dev, the coach at NICE Academy in Bengaluru whose protege is Shreyanka Patil (and took 2-12 against Pakistan), Arundhati found the performances which got her back into the Indian team via the all-format series against South Africa in June.“Honestly it was more that I wanted to play for India again. Like, three and a half years I was off and not a great patch for me personally. But again you think of what needs to be done what I need to be improving on.”“So for me the main focus and mindset was to be the best all-rounder in the world and make a comeback. I just prepared a certain way that I know when I come in, and that I need to win games for India and I will be confident enough to do it and that was the mindset when I was not part of the team,” she added.At Dubai, with Pakistan not being able to get going on a slow and low pitch, Arundhati pegged them back by dismissing Omaima Sohail with the slower ball, trapping Aliya Riaz lbw and then disturbing Nida Dar’s off-stump to ensure the side never got their apt finishing touches as they made 105/8. The tight bowling performance from India were crucial, especially after giving away 160 to New Zealand in a net run rate denting defeat.“Obviously, it was a little disappointing for us that we lost the game. But again, we sat as a group, discussed on how or what we need to be doing in this ground and in this wicket. And you could see it today. I think we bowled really well today. So that's what we're trying to focus on, trying to keep improving every game.”“See, whoever is playing right now has been playing for a few years. Everybody knows what they need to be doing. So, it is just about we sitting together again, trying to discuss our plans, what we need to do. And obviously, that has helped us today,” stated Arundhati.There were a few fielding lapses – like Asha Sobhana putting down two sitters – followed by the batters being circumspect in their approach to chasing. But Arundhati answered all of those queries calmly, though her send-off to Nida in the final over was a fiery one made in the ‘heat of the moment’.“The pitch was little on the slower side, so we knew that we couldn't start as freely as we could because it was a little on the slower side. The plan was to for the openers to see it off and see how the wicket is playing and then you know finish accordingly.”“Honestly as a team we have been working very hard on our fielding. I knew there were a few lapses but as long as we are happy that as long as the team wins. Obviously, it's a work in progress, and I'm sure we'll get there soon.”Since her comeback to the Indian team, Arundhati has made most of her chances and one wouldn’t be surprised if she becomes the main challenger in India’s quests to upstage Sri Lanka and defending champions Australia in its remaining Group A games for an entry into the semi-finals.“It's been a long time, four years, but honestly with me right now the focus is to do well for the team. I know I'm much prepared now than what I was back in 2020, but again I've come into this set up with a lot of confidence and I know I can deliver for the team as and when it's required. So I'm just looking forward to keep doing that, and keep continuing to win games for India.”","Arundhati Reddy takes 3-19 as India beat Pakistan in Women's T20 World Cup.

Kervens Belfort had a good opportunity to score in the fourth minute when he received the ball inside the box, but his shot went over the crossbar. Calicut's efforts paid off in the 12th minute when Muhammed Riyas headed the ball into the net. Khangenbam Thoi Singh received the ball inside the box from a long pass and cut it back from the right edge to find an unmarked Riyas. The striker made no mistake, heading the ball precisely to give Calicut the lead.The hosts' lack of marking of Calicut players inside the box resulted in the visitors doubling their lead in the 20th minute through a set piece. After winning a corner kick, Calicut skipper Abdul Hakku ran unnoticed into the Kombans box. With the ball perfectly positioned for a header, Hakku was in the right place to head it past Thiruvananthapuram goalkeeper Pawan Kumar to double Calicut's lead. Gani Muhammed nearly scored Calicut's third goal in the 28th minute, but his direct free kick hit the crossbar.Thiruvananthapuram coach Sergio Alexandre switched the positions of wingers Ganesan and Muhammed Ashar, hoping Ashar's speed would pressure Hakku and create space for other forwards in the Calicut box.

This probably sums up the plight of the hapless Bhubaneswar side.Starting their debut AFC campaign with such a huge beating, OFC Women will find it extremely difficult to swallow the bitter pill before playing their next game on Wednesday against home side Ho Chi Minh City, who beat Taiwan's Taichung Blue Whale 3-1 in the other game of the day.For head coach Crispin Chhetri it will be quite a task to help his wards regroup ahead of the crucial second game and start afresh.",Odisha FC Women lost 0-17 to Urawa Red Diamonds Ladies in AFC Women's Champions League.

Torino goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic could only parry a header from Lautaro Martinez and Thuram managed to bundle home the rebound despite being off balance.Thuram was given a standing ovation when he was substituted off eight minutes later.However, there was a nervy finale for Inter after Nikola Vlasic netted a penalty for Torino with three minutes remaining following a foul from Hakan Calhanoglu on Adam Masina.Retegui didn't celebrate his three goals in respect for Genoa.Genoa was the first Italian team Retegui played for after joining from Argentine outfit Boca Juniors in 2023.The Argentina-born Italy forward spent a season at Genoa before moving to Atalanta in the offseason.After each of his goals against his former club, Retegui just held up his hand almost in apology before he was embraced by his Atalanta teammates.Retegui opened the scoring in the 24th and doubled his tally early in the second half when he fired home a rebound after Genoa goalkeeper Pierluigi Gollini - who is on loan from Atalanta - parried Ederson's effort.Ederson got on the scoresheet 10 minutes later, and Retugui completed his hat trick by converting a penalty following an Alessandro Vogliacco handball.Marten de Roon netted a stunning volley before Jeff Ekhator scored a consolation for Genoa.Jordan Zemura set Udinese on the way to a 1-0 win over Lecce with a magnificent free kick.Udinese had already hit the woodwork twice in an entertaining match before Zemura curled into the top right corner from 25 meters out in the 25th minute.Udinese moved into third while Lecce remained fourth from bottom after its third straight defeat without scoring.",Marcus Thuram scores hat trick as Inter Milan beat Torino 3-2.

Three-star Mohun Bagan too powerful for newbies Mohammedan SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/three-star-mohun-bagan-too-powerful-for-newbies-mohammedan-sc/articleshow/113978643.cms,"Mohun Bagan X Photo

KOLKATA: Jose Molina insisted on Friday that his Mohun Bagan SG project is new and would take time to take shape. If the team's abject 0-3 surrender at Bengaluru FC last week raised a crisis call, their response to it was almost immaculate, now brushing aside Mohammedan Sporting 3-0 at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday.Mohun Bagan killed the game as a contest in the first half itself.Jamie Maclaren made his first start of the season memorable, opening the floodgates with an eighth-minute header. Subhasish Bose won another aerial challenge to make it 2-0 in the 31st minute and a sumptuous strike from Greg Stewart five minutes later completed the job for the reigning Shield winners in the first 45 minutes itself.For Andrey Chernyshov's young Mohammedan Sporting, it was a chastening experience, a reality check. They never looked in sync with the challenge on their hands. They tried to put up some fight, but it's more of a misguided variety. They looked beaten right from the beginning.Bagan now have 7 points from 4 matches while Mohammedan Sporting have 4 points. It's also the kind of statement Molina would have loved his players to make ahead of another derby in two week's time --- this time against a winless and pointless East Bengal FC on Oct 19.For the first time this season Bagan entered the field with neither Dimitri Petratos nor Jason Cummings making the starting XI. However, with Maclaren exhibiting a sense of eagerness in leading the line and Manvir Singh and Liston Colaco finding their recognizable rhythm down the flanks, Molina's strategy paid off handsomely. This match could also be a template for Molina as one may be tempted to wonder now if starting with Maclaren could bring the necessary balance and vibrancy as far as his starting line-up was concerned.The first goal seemed to have come from the page of a training drill when Stewart flicked on Colaco's corner and Maclaren showed what made him the Australian league's all-time leading scorer, heading the ball in at the other end with a perfect poacher's instinct.That early goal galvanized Bagan and plunged Mohammedan SC into self-doubt. Just after the half-an-hour mark, Mohammedan SC's Ghanaian defender Joseph Adjei earned a needless booking felling Subhasish with a lunging tackle. Mohun Bagan's full-back stood up and headed home the resultant free-kick taken by Stewart.After providing two assists, Stewart soon joined the goal-scoring party. This time, Subhasish released him through the left channel with a delectable through-ball and the Scottish attacker beat Mohammedan SC goalkeeper Padam Chhetri with a brilliant strike from the edge of the box.Mohammedan SC came into the match with a surprise win over Chennaiyin FC. But what came in their way of transporting that belief to that match? If the first goal disturbed their rhythm early on, their midfield never looked to be a match for Stewart and Co.That Mohammedan SC lacked the kind of industry and organization required to keep an attacking-minded team at bay could also be gauged from the way Stewart bamboozled past four defenders across the field before blazing his shot over the bar.With the contest won in the first half, Molina had time to give Ashique Kuruniyan his long-awaited return to action after a year.For the 40000-odd people in the stands, there was perhaps another battle Bagan wanted to win: not conceding a goal. Well, they were successful on this front as well, leaving the field with a clean sheet for the first time in 4 matches.",Mohun Bagan beat Mohammedan Sporting 3-0 at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. Jamie Maclaren opened the floodgates with an eighth-minute header. Subhasish Bose won another aerial challenge to make it 2-0 in the 31st minute.

Having already created history by qualifying for AFC Women's Champions League a month ago by ensuring a top-of-the-group finish in preliminary stage, Odisha FC Women will hope for a head start to their group-stage campaign when they take on Japan's Urawa Red Diamonds Ladies at Thong Nhat Stadium in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, on Sunday afternoon.The Japanese club comes into the encounter on the back of three wins from last five outings in their national women's league (WE League), boasting a potent attacking lineup led by the likes of Mei Shimada, Satoko Fujisaki, Yuzuho Shiokoshi, Fuka Tsunoda, and Seike.The Red Diamonds Ladies are also the defending champions of WE League and they will pose a formidable challenge.However, Odisha FC Women, the present Indian Women's League (ISL) champions representing India on the prestigious continental stage, are confident about their chances against the formidable all-Japanese side which has many national team players in the squad. Having secured a spot in the group stage with a 4-1 victory over Singapore's Lion City Sailors and a 2-1 win against Jordan's Etihad Club in the preliminary stage of the continental competition, Odisha surely are no pushovers in this contest.Despite an injury setback in the second match, Lynda Kom's consecutive goals were the highlights along with Shreya Hooda's stellar performance under the crosspiece. However, midfielder Grace Hauhnar will miss the action on Sunday as she is serving a five-match ban due to the red card received during the match against Etihad Club.Admiring the Japanese champions, Odisha head coach Crispin Chettri said during the pre-match interaction on Saturday, ""The opponent team is very strong, they are champions. We come into this tournament with an open mind, ready to learn and grow - as individuals, as a team, and for Indian football as a whole. We are glad to be here and take away valuable knowledge from this experience.""Goalkeeper Hooda echoed her excitement ahead of the game, saying, ""I'm very happy to be part of this tournament, especially as the first Indian women's team to participate. We feel proud to be here, and we are well-prepared. Our focus is on taking it one game at a time. It feels good to face such a high-calibre team like Urawa. We are all set for the game.""",Odisha FC Women will take on Japan's Urawa Red Diamonds Ladies in Ho Chi Minh City.

LIVERPOOL: Anthony Gordon missed a penalty against his former side to spark an almighty roar from the home fans as Newcastle United were held to a 0-0 draw by Everton in a feisty Premier League clash at Goodison Park on Saturday.Newcastle were correctly awarded a spot-kick in the first half when James Tarkowski hauled down Sandro Tonali in the box, but Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford saved Gordon's poor penalty with his legs.The visitors had several other chances to win the game and were the better side, but Everton might have taken all three points themselves as they had an Abdoulaye Doucoure header ruled out for offside and Idrissa Gueye missed an open goal.The point leaves Newcastle in sixth place in the standings with 12 points from their seven matches, while Everton are in 16th place with five points.Gordon was the villain of the piece for both sets of fans following his acrimonious exit from Goodison Park last year.He also had a chance late on when faced with just Pickford to beat from a narrow angle but fired over the crossbar.""We will always back Gordan to score them, he has been an amazing player for us since he signed,"" Newcastle defender Dan Burn said. ""It is one of those things. We wanted to pull a result out for him because he is hurting a bit.""It was a better performance away from home. We battled well but I am disappointed not to get the three points.""Newcastle came close when Bruno Guimaraes' shot at the back post beat Pickford but not Iliman Ndiaye on the goal line.Doucoure had the ball in the net from a sumptuous James Garner cross but was a yard offside, before Tarkowski's moment of madness gifted Newcastle the opportunity for the opener.The foul was not spotted immediately, but a VAR review saw the penalty awarded, only for Gordon to go low and just off centre to his right, allowing Pickford to make what was a comfortable save in the end.It was a joyous moment for Everton fans as a chorus of ""England's number one"" went around the ground.""I watched the game last week and he reversed it against (Manchester City's) Ederson and I fancied him going keeper's left,"" Pickford said. ""I think he will be disappointed but I am there to make the save and that's what I did.""Guimaraes scooped the ball over the bar from 15 yards before Everton had a penalty shout of their own when Dominic Calvert-Lewin looked to be impeded by Burn as he went to shoot.The officials thought otherwise and from the follow-up Gueye missed a sitter when he blazed over from eight yards.""We weren't at our best but we were resilient and we had to dig in,"" Pickford said. ""We wanted three points but to not lose the game is great and it is our first clean sheet.""",Newcastle held to 0-0 draw by Everton at Goodison Park.

Carvajal hurt

Fede Valverde and Vinicius Junior strikes helped Real Madrid bounce back from their first defeat since January with a 2-0 win over Villarreal on Saturday in La Liga .Los Blancos lost in the Champions League at Lille but are still unbeaten in the Spanish top flight and moved level with leaders Barcelona, before the Catalans visit Alaves on Sunday.Valverde's deflected effort and a rocket from Vinicius allowed Madrid to put a four-point gap between them and their third-placed opponents, who battled well but came up fractionally short in the capital.Madrid's victory was marred by a late injury to defender Dani Carvajal, who had to be taken off on a stretcher.""It seems a serious knee injury, it will be looked at in the coming hours,"" Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti told reporters.""The players are sad, worried, because something happened that happens a lot, because of the (busy) calendar, and it happened to a very, very important player for us.""Ancelotti said Vinicius would also have medical tests after being taken off late on with discomfort in his shoulder and neck.The Italian coach started Kylian Mbappe after the French striker had recovered from a thigh problem.The former Paris Saint-Germain striker could only appear from the bench in Madrid's disappointing midweek display.Mbappe, who France have not selected for upcoming Nations League fixtures, was quiet at the Santiago Bernabeu as his team ground out victory with a determined, rather than inspiring, performance.Madrid are still missing German midfielder Toni Kroos, although on this occasion he was watching on from a box.Mbappe sent an early volley off-target from Luka Modric's corner but it was midfield powerhouse Valverde who broke the deadlock after 14 minutes.The Uruguayan's drive from distance deflected off Villarreal playmaker Alex Baena and arced beyond the reach of goalkeeper Diego Conde.The visitors, enjoying a strong start to the season under coach Marcelino Garcia Toral, came close when Nicolas Pepe's header clipped the top of the crossbar.Mbappe had one further chance, bursting into the area with his electric pace, but goalkeeper Conde managed to dispossess him with an outstretched leg.Villarreal appealed for a penalty early in the second half when Aurelien Tchouameni, playing at centre-back, pulled down Barry, but the French striker was offside.Baena hit the side-netting of Andriy Lunin's goal with a free-kick, nearly catching out the Ukrainian goalkeeper standing in for the injured Thibaut Courtois.Vinicius flashed a shot narrowly wide, before his strike partner Mbappe was replaced with 20 minutes to go by Rodrygo Goes.Brazil striker Vinicius, who is hoping to win a first Ballon d'Or later in October, netted the second with a superb effort from outside the area, which ripped into the top corner.In stoppage time, Spanish right-back Carvajal suffered an injury while attempting to clear the ball under pressure from Yeremi Pino.""In the end, the result's a less important thing -- Dani's health is what matters,"" Valverde told Real Madrid TV.""The game was fine, it was neither very good or bad, it was what we had to do to win, two goals was enough.""Villarreal defender Raul Albiol was also concerned about Carvajal.""It looked bad... let's hope it's the least (damage) possible, because we all know how important he is for Real Madrid and Spanish football ,"" he said.The centre-back said Madrid were efficient with their finishing and that made the difference.""They have a lot of attacking punch and more or less with three chances they had two goals,"" he said.Earlier, nine-man Celta Vigo earned a 1-0 win at bottom-of-the-table Las Palmas.The Canary Islanders were unable to record their first win of the season even after Ilaix Moriba and Iago Aspas' red cards for Celta, who climbed to ninth thanks to Borja Iglesias' goal.Osasuna moved into fifth with a 1-1 draw at Getafe, while Espanyol beat Mallorca 2-1 and Rayo Vallecano won at Valladolid by the same score.",Real Madrid beat Villarreal 2-0 in La Liga.

Starting their league campaign with a hat-trick of losses, East Bengal travelled to Jamshedpur over the weekend hoping to finally reverse their fortunes in the Indian Super League under their interim coach Bino George.But it was not to be as Jamshedpur FC beat the visitors 2-0 to grab their third win of the season at JRD Tata Sports Complex on Saturday and go third on the table with nine points from four matches.First, Rei Tachikawa, a bit out of touch in their previous outings, scored a screamer from outside the box in the 21st minute to put the hosts in lead.Mohammed Sanan was trying to create a move down the left flank but his shot was blocked and it fell to Tachikawa. The Japanese player then made space for himself and took the shot with his right foot towards the near post. Debjit Majumder made a full-length dive to his right but was unable to get his hands to it.While it was indeed a brilliant strike, the East Bengal defence should have done better to make sure Tachikawa didn’t get a clear shot.Later, in the 70th minute, Jamshedpur doubled their lead after Lalchungnunga scored an own goal when he tried to block Imran Khan’s cross from right, intended for Jordan Murray at far post.The Mizoram defender looked distraught after conceding the goal and it kind of summed up the night for the red and golds. Not only did they make defensive errors but also missed numerous chances including a penalty by Saul Crespo in the 64th minute.The Spaniard took a few steps, stuttered and then delivered a weak shot towards the left post which JFC goalkeeper Albino Gomes had no trouble in collecting. The red and gold fans, who had turned up in numbers, looked shell shocked.It got even worse for them when JFC doubled their lead few minutes later.However, East Bengal still had a couple of chances as the match progressed but it was just not their day. Two minutes after JFC took the lead, Hector Yuste’s header hit the crossbar. Then in the 81st minute, Gomes made a superb save to deny Madih Talal from scoring from distance.Talal was clearly the best player for East Bengal and on any other day he might have scored more than one but Jamshedpur’s wall wasn’t to be breached on Saturday.And for that a lot of credit should go to Gomes, who had a brilliant game under the bar. The defenders also put their bodies on the lines as the Men of Steel earned their first clean sheet of the season.Imran once again was impressive on the right and his long balls were spot on. From one of his crosses Murray had a great chance to score but his header went straight to Majumder.Despite all the good news, there is a small injury concern that coach Khalid Jamil will be worried about. Tachikawa was forced to leave the filed in the 33rd minute holding his right back. It looked painful but with the international break coming up JFC will be relieved that they won’t have to take the field till Oct 21.",Jamshedpur FC beat East Bengal 2-0 in the Indian Super League on Saturday. Rei Tachikawa and Lalchungnunga scored the goals for the hosts. It was the Men of Steel's third win of the season.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113971230,imgsize-43574,width-400,resizemode-4/113971230.jpg"

Vijay Amritraj wasn't looking at a map or eying a landmark. The tennis legend was merely marking the steps to oblivion. Amritraj was trying to wrap his head around the fact that India only had one player in the top-250 of the ATP and WTA rankings - Sumit Nagal at No. 83. This has been the case for over 12 months for the men.The 70-year-old pressed, ""How come this isn't spoken about enough?"" India has 10 doubles p layers in the top-150 of the individual doubles ranking, despite shrinking draw sizes.""No kid picks up a tennis racket to play doubles, you play for singles,"" Amritraj said.Amritraj, who was president of the ATP Player Council from 1989 through to 1992 and again in 1994, cautioned that this isn't singles versus doubles, a fight India can ill afford.Still, questions must be asked. Where are India's singles players? What are the programmes we have supporting them?The All India Tennis Association (AITA) claimed to have 'conducted' 829 tournaments in 2023 but the AITA had little to show by way of numbers, like players coming out of this ostensibly robust system.AITA's tournament calendar - across age-groups - is conducted by the 28 member state associations, some clubs and even by parents desperate for their children to get match practice. The tournament structure clearly doesn't come together as a platform to launch Indians on international Tours -juniors or pros. Just a bunch of well-meaning people trying to shore up the game. Rohan Bopanna 's 'Doubles Dream of India', a programme that supports doubles specialists, has kept Indian tennis on the world map. Hardly surprising, then, that India's non-playing Davis Cup captain Rohit Rajpal played an unranked doubles player in a live singles rubber in a World Group 1 tie in Stockholm last month. The visitors, without Nagal, who was injured, failed to win a set.Somdev Devvarman who topped at No. 62 in the rankings in 2011, and Purav Raja, a doubles specialist, weren't amused. The same could be said of a lot of players, but these two decided to take the bull by the horns, taking the AITA to court for violation of the Sports Code.The players, however, haven't always been united. Nobody knows this better than AITA, who have made good use of the situation in the past - Krishnans and Amritrajs; Paes and Bhupathi. Divide and rule. It will be interesting to see what the nomenclature would read like this time as another set of players have been in talks with AITA, educating themselves on opportunity in administration.",India only has one player in the top-250 of the ATP and WTA rankings.

She (Maaya) had nothing to lose,” said Vaidehi, referring to her success in the tournament in 2022.She had also been runner-up to Shrivalli Rashmikaa last year, making it “three finals in a row”.Tamil Nadu’s 17-year-old Rethin Pranav claimed the men’s singles title, overcoming Nitin Kumar Sinha of Railways 6-4, 2-6, 6-2 for his maiden championship.Maharashtra’s Prisha Shinde clinched the Under-18 girls’ trophy, fighting back from 2-5 in the second set to beat Tamil Nadu’s Diya Ramesh 1-6, 7-6 (4), 6-2 in a two-hour long final.Aradhya Kshitij of Karnataka lifted the boys’ title with a 5-7, 7-5, 6-4 win over Manipur’s second seed Shanker Heisnam.The women’s final lasted an hour and 35 minutes, but it could have been even shorter. Vaidehi was up 5-0 in the second set when Maaya fought back to make it 3-5 before the Indian Billie Jean King Cup player nipped the late challenge from her rival.“I started cramping at 5-0. I was sick, was having cold and fever the last three days,” revealed Vaidehi.The title caps a fine run in the past few months for Vaidehi, starting with the $25,000 title in Chinese Taipei in June and followed by a semifinal in Kazakhstan and another final and a semifinal in Thailand.Despite the progress on court, it has been a struggle for Vaidehi to improve her tennis finances.“I was travelling alone in Taipei, and it was really hot out there. I played really well, I beat two players ranked higher than me. I was down 0-6, 0-3 in the second round, but came back strongly. In the final, I was again first set down. It’s the biggest title of my career so far,” she said.“The challenge for me is, being a woman, I cannot travel alone to some places (tournament venues) because they are not safe. If I take sponsorship, then I can have someone to travel with me,” said Vaidehi, who has her own travelling expenses covered by the Gujarat State sports authority.Yet, now that her goal for the year of winning a $25K title is achieved, Vaidehi is looking ahead with positivity.“I have slowly taken one step at a time. Now I am just more confident,” said Vaidehi, who will be travelling to Australia after a 10-day break.“There are a series of five big tournaments.

Unruffled Sinner

Zverev in, Rublev out

SHANGHAI: Novak Djokovic said it took time to ""get the rust off"" as he fought through two tiebreaks to make his way into the third round of the Shanghai Masters on Saturday.The Serbian beat American Alex Michelsen in a thrilling two-set match that finished 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (11/9).Meanwhile Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz showed why they were top in the world as they raced through to the next stage with confident straight-set wins.Sinner dispatched Japan's Taro Daniel 6-1, 6-4, while Alcaraz made short work of China's Shang Juncheng, winning 6-2, 6-2.Four-time Shanghai champion Djokovic did not have it quite so easy against 43rd ranked Michelsen.Introduced as the ""Greatest Of All Time"" as he walked onto the court, he received a rapturous welcome from the packed stadium.But Michelsen started the first set strongly, breaking Djokovic early and going 1-4 up -- to the displeasure of the crowd, fully behind the 37-year-old former world number one.To their delight, the Serbian levelled, and then hit his stride in the tiebreak, winning it 7-3.The reverse happened in the second set when it was 20-year-old Michelsen's turn to catch up to take it to the tiebreak.Djokovic admitted to being ""surprised"" by Michelsen.""It took me a little bit of time to get the rust off and to start feeling better on the court,"" he said.""I was very glad to keep calm when it mattered in both tiebreaks.""The crowd, already in a frenzy after Djokovic spoke Mandarin at the end of the match, went wild as he showed off a new trick -- attempting a sentence in the Shanghainese vernacular.World number one Sinner has said he is not in a ""comfortable"" situation thanks to a World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) appeal against a decision by tennis authorities to clear him of wrongdoing after he twice tested positive for a steroid in March.His recent blistering winning streak was broken by Alcaraz in the China Open final on Wednesday.But there was no tiredness on display from either player on Saturday, with 23-year-old Sinner looking completely unruffled in the first set against the 93rd-ranked Daniel.Daniel fell behind again in the second set and despite rallying halfway through to gently test Sinner, the Italian kept his cool, ending the set 6-4.Sinner will face Argentina's Tomas Martin Etcheverry on Sunday.""It will be a tough one tomorrow, very physical, because me and Tomas know each other quite well now,"" he said.Earlier, arch-rival Alcaraz also looked comfortable throughout, breaking in the first game, with teenager Shang unable to make much headway against the world number two.Despite their enthusiasm for Shang, the crowd could not resist Alcaraz's charm.At the Spaniard's encouragement, they broke into loud cheers when he won a particularly exciting rally in which he hit a tricky backwards shot to keep the point alive.""I just had one practice then was straight into this match, so to be able to show this level in the first match, I'm just really proud,"" 21-year-old Alcaraz said after the match.He will next face another Chinese player, wildcard Wu Yibing.There were no surprises either for the tournament's second seed Alexander Zverev , who won 6-4, 6-2 against Italy's Mattia Bellucci.""Everything is ok when you win... I was very uncertain of my level before this tournament started,"" the German said, referencing recent health problems that saw him miss the China Open.The tournament lost its second top-ten player on Saturday, as Andrey Rublev fell to 19-year-old Czech Jakub Mensik .The Russian, a finalist at last year's Shanghai Masters, roared in jubilation after winning a tiebreaker to take the first set.But 65th-ranked Mensik broke Rublev in the first game of the second set, and again in the fifth to draw even.The Czech then came from behind in the third to beat the world number six for the second time this year, with a final score of 6-7 (7/9), 6-4, 6-3.",Novak Djokovic into third round of Shanghai Masters.
