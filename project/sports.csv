'That to me is the real game...': Virat Kohli on overcoming tough times in life - Watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/that-to-me-is-the-real-game-virat-kohli-on-overcoming-tough-times-in-life-watch/articleshow/112554355.cms,"NEW DELHI: One of the most prominent and successful cricketers in the world, Virat Kohli is known for his aggressive batting style, leadership qualities, and consistency across all formats of the game with an indelible mark on cricket.Virat's passion for the game and relentless pursuit of excellence have made him one of the most respected figures in cricket.Kohli served as the captain of the Indian cricket team in all formats from 2013 to 2022. Under his leadership, India reached the finals of several major tournaments and became a dominant force in Test cricket.Kohli is among the top run-scorers in international cricket, with over 70 centuries across formats. He has broken numerous records, including being the fastest to 8,000, 9,000, 10,000, and 11,000 ODI runs.Despite being one of the most prolific cricketers, Kohli has faced periods of poor form throughout his career, as is common with many top athletes. One of the most notable slumps in his career occurred between 2020 and 2022.Now a video is going viral on the internet where Kohli is talking about overcoming tough times in life.Kohli says in the video which is filmed during a podcast, ""How you react to the times when you are not feeling great and how you ride that wave and accept things the way they are. It's a very delicate thing to do when you know you're not doing well and you feel like you don't want to work, you don't want to go to practice, you don't want to work hard in the gym. But you feel like as an individual, you're respecting all phases of life, and even in your worst times, you are committed to do the hard work, and it's not based on success. That, to me, is the real game here, because that is eventually God's test. This is how I look at it and if you're not up to the test then you are basically not being grateful and not being loyal to the opportunity that's been given to you.""Between November 2019 and September 2022, Kohli went through a century drought in international cricket, which was highly unusual for a player of his caliber. This period was marked by frequent starts but few conversions into big scores.The pressures of captaincy during this phase were significant, and Kohli eventually stepped down from captaincy in all formats for India by the end of 2021, and later from RCB 's captaincy. The added responsibilities were believed by some to have affected his batting performance.India broke their 11-year drought for a global title by clinching the T20 World Cup against South Africa in a thrilling final on June 29.The match culminated in a nail-biting seven-run victory for India, propelled by Virat Kohli's commanding 76 runs, who had failed to fire throughout the tournament but saved his best for the last and then announced his retirement from T20I cricket.","Virat Kohli is known for his aggressive batting style, leadership qualities, and consistency.

2nd Test: Bowlers shine as West Indies and South Africa share honours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/2nd-test-bowlers-shine-as-west-indies-and-south-africa-share-honours/articleshow/112554041.cms,"NEW DELHI: Shamar Joseph took five wickets in his maiden Test match played at home, but South Africa responded with 17 wickets lost on Thursday's thrilling first day of the second and final Test at Providence, Guyana.The Proteas elected to bat first, and fast bowler Joseph's five for thirty-three spearheaded the destruction of the opposition for 160, as per AFP.However, the Caribbean side faltered to 97 for seven in reply at the end, and seamer Wiaan Mulder reacted in kind with the superb figures of four for 18.Joseph, who was left out of the rain-affected, drawn first Test in Trinidad a week earlier, regained his form and intensity from his January debut series in Australia.On the last day of the second Test in Brisbane, he bowled the West Indies to their first Test victory Down Under in 27 years with an incredible seven-wicket haul.Following two lackluster Tests in England last month, where he appeared short of work and match fitness, the Guyanese pacer immediately made up for it when he entered the game as the first change bowler on a sweltering morning at the South American site.With fellow pacer Jayden Seales(3 for 45) providing good support, he removed opener Adrian Markram almost immediately. His constant pace and full length proved to be more than a handful for the South Africans in conditions that were pleasantly favorable to the fast bowlers.""It's a great feeling to have done this at home,"" said 24-year-old Joseph in reflecting on his third five-wicket Test innings haul.""I haven't really played much here at Providence but I always go in with a clear plan to do what the team needed, and I am glad I was able to deliver today.""To get the visitors over the hundred-run threshold, Dane Piedt (38 not out) and Nandre Burger (23) had to put together a last-wicket partnership of 63.Strangely enough, bowling was the main reason both players were chosen for this particular match-fast bowler Lungi Ngidi and batter Ryan Rickelton were left out of the first Test squad.The South African bowlers destroyed the West Indies top-order batting, spurred on by their last-ditch resistance.The South Africans made a comeback when Mulder replaced the unfortunate Kagiso Rabada , but Burger was the first to strike when he scattered Mikyle Louis' stumps.The medium-pacer, following Joseph's lead earlier in the day, provided the perfect blend of movement through the air and off the seam to have the hosts reeling at 56 for six. This knocked out his previous best of three for one, which he had also achieved against the West Indies in St Lucia three years prior.""I didn't bowl at my best but I had a lot going for me today,"" Mulder admitted in reflecting on his career-best Test bowling performance.""I just tried to replicate what Shamar did earlier in the day by bowling a length which made it difficult for the batters to score. He's obviously quicker than I am but the pitch also helped by style of bowling so I was able to capitalise.""Gudakesh Motie (33 not out) and Jason Holder (33 not out) prevented a total collapse, but Motie's dismissal in the final over of the day against Keshav Maharaj puts even more pressure on former captain Holder to do whatever he can with the tail on the second morning to reduce the first innings deficit.",Shamar Joseph takes five wickets in his maiden Test match played at home.

Sources indicate that Abdullah Shafiq's position as opener remains secure, while captain Shan Masood will take on the crucial number three role. This new batting order aims to solidify the top order and provide stability to the middle order with Azam's presence.Azam's experimentation with the number four position in Test cricket is not entirely unprecedented. During Pakistan's tour of Sri Lanka in 2022, he was tried at number three, a position he retained for the second Test against England later that year. However, his move to number four for the upcoming Bangladesh series suggests a more permanent shift in the team's long-term strategy.The series against Bangladesh also presents an opportunity for new talent to emerge. Sources have revealed that batsman Muhammad Huraira is a strong contender for a debut appearance, signalling the team management's intent to introduce fresh faces into the Test arena.On the bowling front, Pakistan are expected to capitalize on the anticipated bowler-friendly conditions at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium. A three-pronged pace attack comprisingShaheen Afridi , Naseem Shah, and Mir Hamza is likely to be deployed, with one spinner completing the bowling lineup.The two-match Test series, commencing on August 21st in Rawalpindi, holds added significance as it marks the first assignment for newly appointed Test coach, Jason Gillespie . Gillespie's arrival signals a new chapter for Pakistan's Test cricket, and his guidance will be crucial in shaping the team's approach against Bangladesh and beyond.The second Test, scheduled from August 30th to September 3rd in Karachi, will unfortunately be played without spectators due to ongoing renovations at the National Stadium. While the absence of a home crowd might be a slight setback, the team remains focused on delivering a strong performance and securing a series victory against Bangladesh.","Babar Azam will bat at number four in Pakistan's Test series against Bangladesh.

Spencer Johnson , the Australian fast bowler, has been sidelined from the forthcoming T20I matches against Scotland and England in the UK due to a side injury sustained while representing The Oval Invincibles in 'The Hundred' tournament.As a replacement for the injured Johnson, Cricket Australia has called up Sean Abbott to join the squad. Abbott was originally chosen to be part of the five-match ODI series against England.During his recent stint in 'The Hundred', Johnson managed to secure only two wickets in six appearances.However, he delivered an impressive spell of 1/10 in his 20 deliveries against Northern Superchargers.Since making his debut against South Africa last year, Johnson has represented Australia in five T20Is and one ODI. The young pacer, who quickly gained recognition in the BBL with Brisbane Heat, is regarded as a strong contender to replace Mitchell Starc in the T20I squad.While Starc has been given a break from the T20Is against Scotland and England, he will be available for the ODIs. Pat Cummins, on the other hand, will not be participating in the entire tour. Josh Hazlewood has been included in both the T20I and ODI squads.Sean Abbott, who has played 15 T20Is for Australia, has been somewhat unfortunate not to have represented his country more often in the format.Abbott's impressive record in the Big Bash League is unmatched, with a staggering 165 wickets to his name, making him the leading wicket-taker in the tournament's history. Additionally, he has showcased his skills in 'The Hundred', claiming nine wickets in seven appearances for Birmingham Phoenix.The T20I squad also includes promising young seamer Xavier Bartlett, who made a significant impact in international cricket last season, and the talented Nathan Ellis. The team's fast-bowling department is further bolstered by the presence of allrounders Cameron Green, Aaron Hardie and Marcus Stoinis.While the selectors are looking ahead to the next T20 World Cup, which is scheduled to take place in 18 months, they have not completely ruled out the possibility of Starc or Cummins participating in the format.Johnson's primary focus is on regaining full fitness in time for the commencement of the Australian domestic season, where he represents South Australia.Following the UK tour, Australia's next T20I assignment is a three-match series against Pakistan in mid-November. This series could provide Johnson with another opportunity to showcase his skills, as the Test players will be unavailable due to their commitments in the upcoming first Test in Perth.After the Pakistan series, Australia's T20I schedule is expected to resume in July of the following year, with a tour to the West Indies.Mitchell Marsh (c), Sean Abbott, Xavier Bartlett, Cooper Connolly, Tim David, Nathan Ellis, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Cameron Green, Aaron Hardie, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis (wk), Marcus Stoinis, Adam Zampa.",Spencer Johnson has been ruled out of the T20I series against Scotland and England.

His ability to just be with the youngster and encourage him, no matter what the situation of the game is, no matter what the performance of a player is, he just tries to make sure that there is enough composure around that player, the player doesn't feel insecure, and that I think is a very very important thing when the player just comes into the team. And even for a player who has played a lot of games, for him also, he might go through a bad patch, you need someone to just come around you and just pat your back and say 'hey nothing to worry about, you've got all the ability, talent and everything, just need to go out there and enjoy.'

""If you take last season as a whole, it could be anything again this time.""The visit from City, who are starting their quest for an unprecedented fifth successive English title, will certainly keep the focus sharp at Stamford Bridge.City has been quiet in the transfer window, maintaining a relatively small but experienced first-team squad of 27 players, expected once again to set a high benchmark.The corresponding fixture last season ended in a dramatic 4-4 draw in November, but Chelsea's subsequent 4-1 loss at Newcastle United demonstrated their inconsistency.While City waits until Sunday for their opener, Manchester United kicks off the season on Friday when they host Fulham.United's unexpected FA Cup final victory over City helped keep Erik Ten Hag in his job. However, the Dutchman knows he needs a strong start to the season to avoid the persistent speculation about his future that troubled him last season.While aiming for the top four, Arsenal is expected to be City's main challenger again, after coming close in the 2022-23 season and even closer last season.Arsenal begins at home against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday, with main summer signing Ricardo Calafiori likely making his first defensive start. In addition to Maresca, several other managers will be making their competitive debut on the opening weekend.Liverpool's Arne Slot takes on the challenge of leading the club into the post-Juergen Klopp era, starting away at promoted Ipswich Town. Brighton & Hove Albion's Fabian Huerzeler kicks off his tenure against Everton, while all eyes will be on West Ham United's new manager Julen Lopetegui as his side hosts Aston Villa, who finished fourth last season.Tottenham Hotspur, who ended fifth last season, will begin their second season under Ange Postecoglou on Monday, playing away at promoted Leicester City.",Premier League season kicks off on Sunday with Manchester City taking on Chelsea.

UEFA Super Cup: Kylian Mbappe strikes on debut as Madrid beat Atalanta,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/uefa-super-cup-kylian-mbappe-strikes-on-debut-as-madrid-beat-atalanta/articleshow/112538762.cms,"Mbappe movement

NEW DELHI: Kylian Mbappe scored on his Real Madrid debut to help his new team defeat Atalanta 2-0 and win the UEFA Super Cup for the record sixth time on Wednesday in Warsaw.After years of waiting to play for his ideal team, the French forward sensation finally joined Los Blancos this summer upon his departure from Paris Saint-Germain , and he celebrated his debut with a goal, as per AFP.After the Italian Europa League winners held their own in the first half, Fede Valverde broke the tie for the holders of the Champions League in the 59th minute with a close-range shot.Madrid started to build momentum, and in the 68th minute, Mbappe scored a spectacular goal to secure the win after Jude Bellingham had spotted his run into space in the box.""It was a great night, I've been waiting for this moment for a long time,"" Mbappe told Movistar, speaking in fluent Spanish.""To play with this shirt, with this badge, for these fans, it's a gift for me.""We won a trophy too, that's very important, we know that here we always have to win and I am very happy.""With Madrid's victory, head coach Carlo Ancelotti tied previous Los Blancos coach Miguel Munoz for the most titles won as a club manager with 14.This season, the Italian's first priority is creating a system that would maximize the performance of his wide range of attacking players.Initially, Mbappe started in the middle of Madrid's front line, with Vinicius Junior on the left and Rodrygo Goes on the right, giving an indication of how Ancelotti may use him this season.Consequently, Bellingham, an England international, did not play in the forward position he started last season with such devastating goal scoring effect; instead, he was a member of the midfield trio.""(Mbappe) has the quality to score a lot of goals,"" Ancelotti told Movistar.""What we have to look for is balance in the team -- today we didn't have that balance.""In a close first half, Mbappe's best opportunity came in the fifteenth minute, but Isak Hien expertly blocked his attempt from the middle of the box.After shocking Bayer Leverkusen in the Europa League final the previous season, Gian Piero Gasperini's Atalanta made their Super Cup debut. Eder Militao nearly gave them the lead by heading Marten de Roon's cross over his own bar.Bellingham took a hard touch to control a deft pass from Vinicius and was booked for a late push on Atalanta goalkeeper Juan Musso during a raid forward from midfield.Vinicius set Rodrygo up, and he clipped the top of Atalanta's crossbar right before halftime.At the beginning of the second half, Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who was injured for the majority of the previous season, made an incredible one-handed save to deflect a header by Mario Pasalic.At the beginning of the second half, Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who was injured for the majority of the previous season, made an incredible one-handed save to deflect a header by Mario Pasalic.Before the hour, Valverde of Real Madrid broke the tie with a close-range tap-in as Atalanta's defense fretted over Mbappe's increased freedom of movement.Vinicius, who was becoming more and more important, feed Bellingham, who then sliced the ball across the goal for the Uruguayan midfielder to score.When Vinicius was let through on goal, Musso knocked over his attempt, which would have doubled Madrid's lead.As Madrid attempted a second, Swedish defender Hien stopped Bellingham, and Musso then stopped the former Borussia Dortmund player.Eventually, Mbappe finished it with a deadly flourish after Bellingham stalled an attempt and saw the Frenchman's deft move.The Madrid supporters applauded the striker as Ancelotti took him off the field in the 83rd minute, probably the first of many that to come.Mbappe stated that he anticipated getting better in the upcoming weeks. Real Mallorca will be Madrid's first La Liga opponent on Saturday.""I am sure we will get better and me first of all -- but today is a positive step,"" added the striker.",Kylian Mbappe scored on his Real Madrid debut to help his new team defeat Atalanta 2-0 and win the UEFA Super Cup for the record sixth time.

'Underdogs' East Bengal look to defy odds against Turkmenistan challengers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/underdogs-east-bengal-look-to-defy-odds-against-turkmenistan-challengers/articleshow/112511817.cms,"KOLKATA: Carles Cuadrat the realist is saying that East Bengal FC will not start favourites against Turkmenistan 's Altyn Asyr FC in the AFC Champions League preliminary play-off.Cuadrat the believer, however, is ready to embrace this challenge as a new beginning for his team.The match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday will mark East Bengal's return to Asian football since their AFC Cup group stage exit in 2015.A win in this one-off fixture will fetch them a place in the first-ever ACL 2 edition while a defeat will take them to the Challenge Cup, the lowest in the AFC club tournament system.Aware of the stakes, Cuadrat described it as a ""difficult test"" for his players. ""We'll play against a team that is showing why they deserve to be in an AFC competition year after year as they've qualified for top 9AFC) competitions every season. It'll be a good test for us to prove that we are also at that kind of level and can represent the country in a top competition like the ACL-2,"" the Spanish coach told reporters on Tuesday.""We are not favourites for this game. We are playing in Asia after 9 years and have a lot of inexperienced players. It will be the first game (in an Asian tournament) for some of our players. But one thing is clear is that East Bengal will play with a never-say-die attitude and we'll hope to take advantage of our home crowd,"" he added.Cuadrat has had the experience of facing the Turkmenistan rivals. During his stint with Bengaluru FC back in 2018, Sunil Chhetri & Co. lost the two-legged AFC Cup inter-zonal semifinals 5-2 on aggregate.Never a man fond of beating the drum for revenge, Cuadrat, however, will take on Altyn Asyr at a challenging time. The senior team's pre-season is just two competitive match-old with the all-important derby against Mohun Bagan SG coming up in four days time with the Durand Cup quarterfinal spot at stake. Players like Hector Yuste are yet to join the side while a few others are nursing injuries.Yet, amid the euphoria of India defender Anwar Ali's unveiling during the club's Sports Day ceremony later in the day, Cuadrat knows that his team can announce the arrival of its new-found ambitions with a win over Altyn Asyr.""We want to raise the standards. We reached two finals last season and were not so good in the ISL. We want to be the protagonist in all the competitions we want to play this season,"" the East Bengal coach remarked.For a team founded only in 2008, winning Turkmenistan's top domestic league (Yokary Liga) 8 times and being a regular in Asian football speaks volumes of Altyn Asyr's emergence as a force to reckon with.The visitors from Turkmenistan have the form and history on their side. But the red-and-gold's history is replete with many odds-defying tales. It remains to be seen if Nandhakumar Sekar & Co., starting as underdogs, can rise to the occasion and alter the script.","East Bengal face Turkmenistan's Altyn Asyr FC in AFC Champions League preliminary play-off.
