A new era for FOX Sports - Olsen’s fall and Brady’s rise



Greg Olsen Opens Up about Getting Demoted for Brady - Barstool Rundown - January 30th, 2025

Is Greg Olsen holding any grudges against Tom Brady? Absolutely not



Greg Olsen’s sudden fall from FOX Sports ’ top analyst role has raised eyebrows. After FOX signed Tom Brady to a massive $375 million deal, Olsen was bumped down to a secondary role. While it makes sense to make room for the GOAT, Olsen had already established himself as one of the sport’s leading voices, making his demotion all the more painful.Greg Olsen’s surprising fall from the top analyst spot at FOX Sports to a secondary role is stirring up tension in the broadcast booth.Shocking? Not quite. After FOX handed Tom Brady a jaw-dropping $375 million contract to become their lead analyst, Olsen was sidelined. Sure, making room for the GOAT seems fair, but here’s the twist: Greg Olsen had already solidified himself as one of the top voices in the game.You can see why this would sting. After all the hard work, proving his worth, Olsen suddenly finds himself outshined by a seven-time Super Bowl champ stepping in to take his spot. Understandably, Olsen wasn't thrilled about the shakeup.Meanwhile, Brady is playing it cool, classic TB12. Instead of engaging in drama, he subtly let his Instagram do the talking. Sharing a quote that said, “Maybe you don’t notice your progress because you’re always raising your bar,” he added a simple “Love this” caption. In other words, “I’m here, I’m working, and I don’t care about the noise.”But here's the kicker: during Brady's debut as an analyst in Week 1, fans weren’t exactly impressed. Many criticized his commentary as “amateurish” and his delivery as “colorless.” Meanwhile, Olsen, who had been a fan favorite and a ratings magnet, found himself on the sidelines.Olsen, however, hasn’t been shy about his future goals. “I’m going to call big-time games again; I’m going to call Super Bowl games again,” he told The Athletic. He’s confident, and with good reason.The real question: Is there tension between Olsen and Brady? The heat is on, but does Brady want the job long-term? He knows football, but can he deliver captivating commentary? If he falters, will FOX reconsider? With Brady’s role as a minority owner of the Raiders, this is more than just competition, it’s a subplot that has everyone watching.Greg Olsen has every reason to be frustrated. After working hard to earn his spot, he watched it snatched away by none other than Tom Brady. It’s the harsh reality of the business.In 2023, Olsen was named Outstanding Emerging On-Air Talent, covered Super Bowl LVII, and won an Outstanding Event Analyst award at the 2024 Sports Emmys. His transition from player to analyst was seamless, fans loved his insightful, natural delivery with Kevin Burkhardt. But when Brady arrived, Olsen was relegated to the No. 2 team by FOX.He’s not exactly angry, but it’s clear the situation stings. “I don’t think resentment [towards Tom Brady] is probably accurate, but I also think it’s not too far off if I’m being honest,” he admitted. While still close with Burkhardt and Erin Andrews, watching someone else take his Super Bowl spot hurts.FOX’s recent Super Bowl LIX announcement only added salt to the wound, Brady, Burkhardt, and Andrews in New Orleans, and Olsen left out. But Olsen and Brady aren’t enemies. The two have had several personal conversations, with Olsen offering support: “I told him, ‘Dude, I’m here to help in whatever way I can… I understand the transition you’re making because it’s the same transition I did.’” (via: EssentiallySports)The difference? Olsen nailed his transition. Brady? The verdict’s still out. Olsen is confident he'll call Super Bowl games again. The only question is where. FOX? Another network? That part remains to be seen.",Greg Olsen was demoted from the top analyst spot at FOX Sports to a secondary role. Tom Brady was signed to a $375 million contract by the network.

The Golden State Warriors clinch a win against the Utah Jazz



The Green family is not just passionate about basketball, but the Golden State Warrior star Draymond Green is also an avid fan of the footy sport. Green attends NFL games pretty regularly, and his wife is often seen tagging along. And it looks like her clique has a couple of WAGs from the NFL sect as well, as Hazel Renee was recently seen interacting with the Philadelphia Eagles defensive end, Brandon Graham’s wife, Carlyne Graham, on social media.Brandon Graham plays as a defensive end for the Philadelphia Eagles. But after a torn triceps injury, the star player was out of action since the season's Week 12. But a return to the field is becoming a possibility with each passing day. And the latest Instagram post by his wife, Carlyne Graham, has fans (including Hazel Renee) quite excited.After the Eagles won the NFC Championship, the team and their friends and family were seen celebrating the title. The team will be playing the Super Bowl 2025 against the Kansas City Chiefs, and chances are Graham could be making a return on February 10. Carlyne Graham posted a series of pictures of the team celebrating the NFC win, writing: “NOLA here we come!”And it's not only the Grahams who are excited about this possible return of Brandon Graham. Draymond Green's wife Hazel Renee is too. She took to her social media account to comment on Carlyne's post, writing: “LETS GOOOOOO🔥🔥🔥”The NFL Super Bowl between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs will be held at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. Rap genius Kendrick Lamar will be headlining the Halftime show, alongside guest artist SZA.On January 28, 2025, the Golden State Warriors went up against the Utah Jazz and managed to score a win. With a 114-103 score, the Warriors ended the game with a win, even though the Jazz had an early lead. Amid multiple injuries, the Warriors haven't had the best of time on the court off late, so this win is a definite improvement and will be great to boost their morale.Star players Draymond Green as well as Stephen Curry had to sit this one out because of injury-related issues. Green has missed quite a few games, thanks to a left calf strain. And Curry missed the last one against the Utah Jazz because of a bilateral knee injury management. Hopefully, he will be back for the game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, but Green, despite being back to training, will miss a couple more games before he is considered fully fit.Also Read: NBA Trade Rumor: Golden State Warriors in pursuit of $40 million Pacers' star, Jonathan Kuminga on the table as trade asset","Brandon Graham's possible Super Bowl return excites Hazel Renee.

Meanwhile, Cody Martin (core) and Mark Williams (foot) are listed as day-to-day.Ball has been one of Charlotte's key contributors when healthy, averaging 15.7 points, 3.3 rebounds, and 5.1 assists over his last 20 games. However, his continued struggles with injuries have hindered the team’s ability to build momentum in a difficult season.Charlotte has struggled offensively, ranking 28th in the NBA in scoring at just 106.9 points per game. With LaMelo Ball out, the scoring burden will fall primarily on Miles Bridges, who leads the team with 20.4 points per game. The Hornets will also need other key players like Mark Williams and Josh Green to step up in his absence.The team does have a slight edge in rebounding, ranking fifth in the league with 45.8 boards per game. However, the Hornets' inability to put up consistent points continues to be a major issue, and losing Ball only compounds their struggles.The Nuggets (29-19), led by reigning MVP Nikola Jokić, enter the matchup as strong favorites. Jokić is averaging 23.9 points, 11.2 rebounds, and 9.6 assists over his last 20 games, making him a significant challenge for the Hornets’ defense.

NBA legend Michael Jordan is arguably the greatest athlete in the history of the league alongside his close competitor LeBron James. Certainly, Jordan has kept most of the details of his private life hidden from the public but actor and comedianhas recently made a big revelation about the NBA Hall of Famer. Wayans Jr. shared that Jordan used to visit his house for snacks.There are some things that $3 billion rich (per Forbes) Michael Jordan can’t buy and one of those things is the snacks found in Damon Wayans Jr’s house.While speaking of his dream-come-true childhood, Wayans Jr proudly shared the moments he spent with the NBA legend. In a recent interview, he shared astonishing details of Jordan’s influence in his life. ""We were so incredibly privileged,” he said of his childhood. For context, Wayans Jr’s father Damon Wayans is also a successful comedian and actor with several movies and television shows to his credit.“We always had activities, and always had friends over. Snacks! So many snacks, it was great. The snack game was off the chain. Michael Jordan used to come over and eat all our snacks. That's how good our snacks were. Jordan is in there, munching on your food? He came over too much. Shoutout to Jordan though,"" the Let's Be Cops actor said of Jordan’s love for the food in their house.Wayans Sr who was also in the interview, shared how his friends were rushing to his house to see Jordan. ""It was amazing to have him,” he said of hosting the five-time NBA MVP.“All my friends would want to come over, not to see me, but hope to see him, just to get a glimpse of Michael Jordan. One thing I really put my foot down on was 'Don't bother him'. He moved in for the whole summer. I only went over to the house once because he invited me in. Did the fan in me want to be in there every day? Yes, because I could see him from my window,"" he added.Damon Wayans Sr . starred in the hit sitcom My Wife and Kids, where he played Michael Richard Kyle, a confident yet often outmatched father. In one memorable episode, his character challenged Michael Jordan to a game of one-on-one. Kyle used his ploy of talking trash but as expected the game did not go his way. He only managed to score once before Jordan completely shut him down. He begged for a rematch, but Jordan refused, leaving him humbled and frustrated.

WrestleMania is definitely the grandest stage of them all and giving Cena his 17th win at the event would be a spectacle that everyone will remember for days to come.Cena is one of the most prominent wrestlers in the Stamford-based organization, and has tirelessly carried the company on his back. So, seeing him pick up the win won’t be a surprise, but its something that he deserves. Super Cena being the last man standing in the Royal Rumble ring isn’t a sight that hasn’t been seen before, but it definitely should be like that for one last time.If he does pick up the victory, then facing off against Cody Rhodes and then picking up the title from him is a match that everyone would want to watch, especially on Cena’s retirement tour. Considering that he’s going to be at WrestleMania, not putting him in an important match is something that doesn’t feel correct at this point.There are however, other worthy contenders in the match, including Damian Priest, Roman Reigns, CM Punk and Seth Rollins. So with so many stalwarts in the ring, it’ll be lovely to see Cena trump over them all. Furthermore, this is a new year, and the WWE has moved to even greater heights with their streaming deals and the intensity of their shows, so giving John Cena a win here will be extremely important for the company.While he can still go onto challenge for the title at SummerSlam, not giving him a win here at the WWE 2025 Royal Rumble could turn out to be a costly misstep that WWE Creative should avoid.","John Cena has entered his name into the WWE Royal Rumble.

Shilo Sanders Embraces Criticism, Compares Himself to Donald Trump Amid NFL Draft Scrutiny



Colorado safety Shilo Sanders has never been one to shy away from controversy, and his recent response to criticism proves just that. Following the East-West Shrine Bowl , where clips of his struggles in practice surfaced online, Sanders took a unique approach to defending himself—by drawing a comparison to former President Donald Trump.In an interview addressing viral footage that highlighted his coverage missteps, Sanders pushed back against the negativity, suggesting that the criticism he faces is part of a broader pattern seen in public figures.“If you just hate me or want to hate me ... paint me in a bad picture; they do that to our President,"" Sanders said. ""They do that to everybody. So I’m not going to be safe from it. But it does get aggravating whenever you put in that work, and you’re working on your craft, and there’s people just steadily destroying you.”Despite the viral clips painting a less-than-ideal picture of his performance, Sanders remained steadfast in his confidence, attributing the negativity to selective editing. “According to Shilo, the negative plays were merely ‘cherry-picked’ in an attempt to discredit his ability.” He emphasized that his focus remains on the evaluations of NFL scouts, his family, and his father, Deion Sanders.His resilience isn’t surprising, given that his father, Deion, has also drawn bold comparisons in the past. Following a loss to Nebraska last season, the elder Sanders made headlines when he likened his experience to that of Jesus Christ. “When you lose, you're going to be ridiculed, you're going to be prosecuted and persecuted and I'm good,” Deion said. “I've been on the cross for a long time and I'm still hanging.”Shilo, much like his father, seems to embrace the idea that scrutiny comes with the spotlight. His response to criticism, however, is not just about defiance—it also underscores his belief that he has put in the work to succeed.Shilo Sanders’ journey to the NFL has been anything but conventional. After starting his college career at South Carolina, he transferred to Jackson State to play under his father before ultimately following him to Colorado. Over his collegiate career, he started 25 games, recording 99 tackles, six passes defended, and one interception.His performance in the actual Shrine Bowl game was solid, with six tackles and a pass defended, even as his team suffered a 25-0 loss. However, his draft stock remains uncertain, as he continues to train for the NFL Combine with hopes of running a 4.40-second 40-yard dash. While his younger brother, Shedeur Sanders , is expected to be a top pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, Shilo is projected as a late-round selection.Also Read: Travis Kelce received a $11,255 fine from the NFL for taunting during the AFC championship game Despite the skepticism surrounding his draft stock, Shilo remains focused on his goals. He understands that his name alone won’t secure him a spot in the league, but his determination and work ethic may yet prove his critics wrong.","Colorado safety Shilo Sanders responded to criticism of his performance at the East-West Shrine Bowl.

Theare set to face the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on Saturday, February 1, but the status of LeBron James remains a key concern. James, listed as ""probable"" due to a foot injury, is among seven Lakers on the injury report ahead of the primetime matchup. LeBron James , who has been one of the main players behind the Los Angeles Lakers’ offense, has been managing a foot issue but is still expected to play against the Knicks.Despite being on the injury report, his probable designation suggests he will take the court barring any last-minute setbacks. The 39-year-old continues to perform at an elite level, averaging 23.9 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 8.5 assists over the last 20 games.In addition to James, the Lakers are dealing with injuries to multiple key players, including Anthony Davis (foot – out), Christian Wood (knee – out), and Gabe Vincent (knee – questionable). Forward Rui Hachimura is also listed as probable with a calf issue, while Dorian Finney-Smith (shoulder) and Jalen Hood-Schifino (hamstring) remain question marks.The Lakers enter the game with a 27-19 record, ranking 17th in the NBA in scoring (111.8 PPG) and struggling on the boards with just 41.5 rebounds per game (27th in the league). With Davis sidelined, Los Angeles will have to rely heavily on LeBron James and Austin Reaves to carry the scoring load.James’ presence is vital for the Los Angeles Lakers , not only for his scoring ability but also as the team’s primary playmaker. His 8.5 assists per game highlight his importance in orchestrating the offense. If he does play, he will be expected to battle a tough Knicks defense that ranks eighth in the NBA, allowing just 110.8 PPG.The Knicks, sitting at 32-16, have three players on the injury report, including Mitchell Robinson (ankle – out) and Josh Hart (knee – questionable). New York’s Jalen Brunson (25.8 PPG) and Karl-Anthony Towns (21.1 PPG, 11.4 RPG) lead the way in scoring, while Mikal Bridges provides additional firepower from beyond the arc.Also read:The Lakers will try to win a crucial road game against one of the best teams in the Eastern Conference now that LeBron James is probably going to suit up.

Almost missing the first-ever Super Bowl... plot twist, he made it

he said.

Super Bowl 59 isn't just any game—Chiefs are gunning for history

Andy Reid might be the key to this whole thing, coaching both sides of history

both

Most fans dream of going to one Super Bowl. Don Crisman has been toof them. No exaggeration—this man from Portland, Maine, is about to attend his 59th straight Super Bowl. He’s one of three people alive who can say that. At 88 years old. Yeah, you read that right.Crisman isn’t ready to stop either. Chiefs vs. Eagles. February 9. New Orleans. He’ll be there.he said. You almost want to ask: is there anything that can actually stop him?Crisman’s streak could’ve ended before it even began. Picture this: 1967. He’s flying to Miami for the very first Super Bowl. Then, disaster strikes. His plane ices up and gets grounded in South Carolina. That should’ve been game over, but not for Crisman. He hustled his way onto a train.""Friday night, I booked a train in Columbia... I got to Miami two hours before kick-off,""Imagine almost missing Super Bowl history because of bad weather. Insane.That’s been Crisman’s whole vibe—find a way, no matter what. And it’s not just him. He’s kept this tradition alive with his two friends, Tom Henschel and Gregory Eaton. The three of them are practically Super Bowl legends at this point.Let’s talk stakes. The Kansas City Chiefs want to do something no other team has done in modern NFL history: win three Super Bowls in a row. Patrick Mahomes is leading the charge, fresh off a season where he hit a career-high 67.5% pass completion rate. Andy Reid, their head coach, is like a wizard with this team, and let’s be real—no one’s surprised they’re back in the spotlight.This season, Mahomes threw for nearly 4,000 yards, while Travis Kelce remained his go-to guy with 823 receiving yards. The Chiefs crushed the competition with a 15-2 record. They’re not here to mess around.Now, Philly’s not just going to hand over the trophy. The Eagles have a chip on their shoulder, and it’s personal. Kansas City already beat them in Super Bowl 57. That’s still fresh. This time, they’re looking for revenge.Jalen Hurts is in the form of his life, combining for 32 total touchdowns (18 passing, 14 rushing). Oh, and Saquon Barkley? Absolute beast this season—2,005 rushing yards. Philly’s defense is stacked too, with Zack Baun racking up 151 tackles. The Eagles aren’t scared of anyone.Second Super Bowl showdown in three seasons. Buckle up.Andy Reid is probably the most awkward but perfect X-factor in this matchup. He’s the greatest head coachteams have ever had. His history with Philly is deep—he led them for 14 seasons before moving to Kansas City. And now? He’s led the Chiefs to seven playoff appearances and four Super Bowl games. Talk about awkward reunions.Reid’s success is undeniable. In Kansas City, he’s 143-53, and with Mahomes, that’s a near-perfect duo. Philly knows this.

We have bat and ball and is there is no solid grip over that you start losing grip over bat and ball, kind of slowly start losing grip over your career also,"" Tendulkar said.""I should not be giving you advice and saying, stay focused, whatever. But there'll be distractions. Don't let them disrupt your career. Value everything that we have. And look after your game. It is about we all have managed when we did not have anything.

The NFL just banned the Eagles from wearing their iconic Kelly Green in Super Bowl LIX—here’s why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/the-nfl-just-banned-the-eagles-from-wearing-their-iconic-kelly-green-in-super-bowl-lixheres-why/articleshow/117848940.cms,"Why Eagles can't wear their iconic Kelly Green uniforms in Super Bowl LIX against the Chiefs (Image via Getty)

The NFL’s policy makes throwbacks a no-go, even for the Super Bowl

“Postseason uniform designation must include Primary Jersey color (team color or white) and Primary Pant color choices.”

Kelly Green dominated for decades but got benched

the

Statistically, teams wearing white win Super Bowls

So, no, Kelly Green won’t happen, but the Eagles are still in good shape

The Eagles had their shot at bringing back Kelly Green for the Super Bowl. As the home team, they chose their uniform color first, and fans were desperate for those throwbacks. But thanks to NFL postseason rules , that’s not happening. No alternate jerseys are allowed. Period. Midnight Green will be on full display when they face the Chiefs.Yes, the Eagles had their pick.Yes, Kelly Green would’ve been epic. But NFL rules don’t care about aesthetics or nostalgia. The league's playoff policy only allows primary home or away uniforms. The rule reads:This means no alternate sets—no Color Rush, no throwbacks, and definitely no Kelly Green helmets.It’s a buzzkill, sure. But the rule isn’t new, and the Eagles knew what they were signing up for. So, when Jalen Hurts and the squad step onto that field, it’s Midnight Green or nothing.And don’t expect the NFL to make exceptions unless you’re the Rams circa 2019. They got a pass to wear throwbacks because the league was already approving those colors for their future uniforms. The Eagles? Not in the same boat.If you know Philly football, you know Kelly Green waslook for over 60 years. The Eagles wore it from their earliest seasons until 1995. In 1996, they swapped it for Midnight Green. Why? Who knows—maybe someone in management thought it looked ""modern.""Fans never got over the change. There was one nostalgic moment in 2010 when the Eagles brought back Kelly Green for the 50th anniversary of their 1960 NFL Championship. It was glorious. And then the color vanished again.Fast forward to 2022. The NFL ditched its one-helmet rule, opening the door for alternate jerseys. Philly seized the opportunity. They rocked Kelly Green twice in 2023 and again in 2024, winning all four games. Fans wanted more, especially on the biggest stage. But nope—the NFL’s rigid policy blocked it.Now, here’s the kicker. Recent Super Bowl history suggests the Eagles might have a better chance if they ditched their home Midnight Green and wore white. In the last 20 Super Bowls, teams wearing white jerseys have gone 16-4. That’s not just a fluke. The Buccaneers were the most recent team to take advantage of the trend. They wore white in Super Bowl LV and absolutely manhandled the Chiefs, winning 31-9.This will be the Eagles' fifth Super Bowl. Every time they’ve had the chance to choose their color, they lost. Their only win came in Super Bowl LII when the Patriots wore white, forcing the Eagles to go with Midnight Green. We all remember how that turned out—Nick Foles’ legendary “Philly Special” and a 41-33 upset victory.Still, Philly’s sticking with Midnight Green this time. Let’s hope the “jersey curse” doesn’t come for them again.Sure, fans are disappointed. Kelly Green is iconic—it’s Philly’s soul in jersey form. But nostalgia doesn’t win championships. The Eagles are locked in with their Midnight Green gear, and honestly, they’ve done just fine in it before.What matters now is performance. Super Bowls aren’t won with fashion statements. They're won with plays that live forever in highlight reels. All eyes will be on Jalen Hurts, and whether it’s Kelly Green or not, the Eagles are ready to make history again.Also Read: Jets' fate up in the air: Aaron Rodgers' future in limbo after major leadership shifts","The Eagles can't wear their iconic Kelly Green uniforms in Super Bowl LIX against the Chiefs.

Patrick Mahomes key turnovers propel the Chiefs to Super Bowl LVII win over Eagles

The Philadelphia Eagles are entering Super Bowl LIX with a sense of redemption on their minds, seeking revenge against Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs after a tough loss in Super Bowl LVII, two years ago. In that game, despite a strong showing on offense, the Eagles' defense struggled to contain Mahomes and the Chiefs’ high-powered offense, which led to a disappointing defeat.In Super Bowl LVII, Mahomes was on fire, throwing for over 300 yards and leading the Chiefs to a 38-35 victory.The Eagles' defense couldn't find a way to stop Mahomes, particularly in the second half, when he threw multiple touchdowns under pressure, including a crucial one to tight end Travis Kelce One of the game’s defining moments was a fumble that was returned for a touchdown by the Chiefs, shifting momentum in Kansas City’s favor. Additionally, a big punt return provided another spark for the Chiefs, allowing them to gain an edge in field position and adding to the Eagles' woes on defense.However, two years later, the Eagles’ defense has undergone a transformation. There are practically no holdovers from that Super Bowl squad. A key change has been the addition of new, elite players, particularly in the defensive line and secondary, that make this defense much stronger and more formidable.The Eagles’ defense now boasts a much-improved pass rush, led by veterans like Brandon Graham, Fletcher Cox, and Javon Hargrave, with newcomers like Haason Reddick also making an impact. Reddick, who had an outstanding season, has been one of the most effective pass rushers in the league, and he will be crucial in trying to disrupt Mahomes' rhythm.The Eagles’ secondary has also received an upgrade, with the addition of cornerbacks Darius Slay and James Bradberry, both of whom have been standout players in the defensive backfield. Slay is particularly known for his ability to shut down top receivers, which could play a huge role in limiting the Chiefs' receiving weapons like JuJu Smith-Schuster and Marquez Valdes-Scantling.The Eagles have also strengthened their linebacker corps, with players like T.J. Edwards and Nakobe Dean provide solid run defense and coverage ability. With this revamped defense, the Eagles' strategy will focus on pressuring Mahomes, keeping him from escaping the pocket and making plays with his legs, and playing more disciplined coverage to avoid giving up big plays, something they struggled with in the previous Super Bowl.This year’s Eagles defense is also better equipped to stop the Chiefs’ run game, something that was exploited to an extent in LVII, and they have proven themselves capable of handling any offense with their top-ranked defensive stats this season. The Eagles will need to play at an elite level to stop Mahomes and his supporting cast and finally avenge their previous Super Bowl defeat.Also Read: ""They're the bully”: Peyton Manning deems Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs as the ultimate bully in the NFL With a revamped roster and an experienced coaching staff led by defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon, the Eagles’ defense will be looking to show just how much they've improved and make a statement against the Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX.","The Philadelphia Eagles lost to the Kansas City Chiefs 38-35 in Super Bowl LVII.

However, instead of being solely celebrated for their dominance, they are facing a growing wave of criticism and conspiracy theories that claim the league is actively favoring them. While skepticism around officiating is nothing new in the NFL, recent controversies have reignited debates over whether the Chiefs receive preferential treatment from referees.The AFC Championship Game saw officiating take center stage once again, with a couple of questionable fourth-down calls going in favor of Kansas City.These decisions have only fueled claims that the league wants the Chiefs in the Super Bowl for the sake of ratings and revenue.Popular YouTuber and former football player ""Deestroying"" didn't hold back his frustration, directly calling out the officials on his podcast.“I got some words for these refs this weekend bro. Refs were on some shit. Sometimes I squint my eyes a little bit, I could see like red stripes on their jersey instead of black and white.”His comment reflect a broader sentiment in the NFL community that the Chiefs often seem to be on the receiving end of beneficial calls. Deestroying also pushed for increased accountability, arguing that referees should be required to answer media questions after games—just like players and coaches.Buffalo Bills running back James Cook, who appeared on the same podcast, took a different stance. Rather than blaming the officials, he stressed the importance of being prepared and playing through adversity.“I’m going to give you an answer. The most realest answer I can give you. At the end of the day, like as man you got to be come in and ready to go. F*ck the ref shit. You got to come to the pitch ready to go, ready to play. Don’t give no ref nothing to call. That’s my answer.”Despite differing opinions, the ongoing officiating debates refuse to die down, with many believing that Kansas City's path to the Super Bowl has been smoothed by questionable decisions.The AFC Championship Game wasn't the first time this postseason that officiating decisions raised concerns. In their divisional-round matchup against the Houston Texans, the Chiefs benefited from a contentious unnecessary roughness penalty after Patrick Mahomes was hit during a slide. Critics argue that such calls have been a recurring theme, reinforcing the perception of inconsistency in officiating when it comes to Kansas City’s games.With the Chiefs now set to face the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl 2025, the league may be forced to confront these concerns. Reports suggest that the NFL is considering expanding its replay assist system to include quarterback slides, an attempt to reduce errors in crucial moments.Also Read: ""Absolutely absurd"": Matthew Stafford’s wife calls out NFL over ‘insane’ Super Bowl suite prices reaching $2.5 million Coach Andy Reid remains focused on preparation, while Patrick Mahomes has dismissed allegations of favoritism, insisting that officiating remains impartial.

What does Shubman Gill's horoscope say about his captaincy future

GURUGRAM: Making the cut. That was the mystery in the misty afternoon as many golfers hung around to discover whether they were above par or under. The top-64 and ties saw the business end, including a certain Englishman Paul Casey - he of the five Ryder Cups fame with 15 European Tour and three PGA Tour wins - as the line dropped to 8-over.With wife Pollyanna on the bag this week, the 47-year-old turned back the clock with two eagles and two birdies in 12 holes of the third round at the International Series India presented by DLF before darkness halted play.His six-shot swing took him up 45 places to T-19. Just one of the sub-plots of the drama that is being played at DLF G&CC’s Gary Player course.Another closer to home was the story of 15-year-old Kartik Singh . The 5-ft-8-in and growing teen was given a slot in a tournament full of hardened pros, courtesy his ranking of 129th in the WAGR, which made him the host country's top amateur. And the fact that he was playing on his home course played to his advantage as he became the youngest player from the subcontinent to make the cut on the Asian Tour . ""The goal was to make the cut, especially because I was playing at home and it's just a very good experience overall,"" he said.When Kartik found himself hitting balls next to the tournament's star attraction Bryson DeChambeau , he was awed by the Major winner's striking presence. ""I'm not used to seeing the ball fly that far... His just keeps flying. So definitely it was motivating,"" he said in wide-mouthed wonder. The young one himself was thrust in the limelight on Friday when he was 4-under after 13 holes in his delayed second round, eventually dropping shots for a one-under to take his total to 4-over at T-30th place. ""Pars are good on this course,"" the product of the DLF academy shared the vibe.With a shotgun start for rounds 3 and 4 in order for the tournament to reach completion on Sunday, the Gurugram boy found himself on the course again after a short break. After 9 holes, he was 8-over for the 3rd round but only to step forward with more lessons learned.Up ahead, Joaquin Niemann was progressing steadily. With a total of 7-under, the calm Chilean was a stroke ahead of Japan’s Kazuki Higa and three clear of American Ollie Schniederjans.The highlight of the day, perhaps forgotten amidst the flurry of activities, was first-round leader Eugenio Chacarra 's albatross on the par-5 8th. He holed his second shot with a 5-iron from 220 yards in his second round in the morning. Unfortunately, no cameras were present to capture this moment of brilliance. For the record, this was the 29th albatross overall on the Asian Tour; last year, there was one.The Spaniard, choosing bright orange to liven up a dull Feb afternoon, found himself in the most-followed group with Bryson and home favourite Anirban Lahiri, the duo in identical blue Crushers GC tees. Starting from the showcase 18th, Lahiri was struggling at 4-over with a cold putter, DeChambeau hanging on at par while Chacarra seemed to be winning the race at oneunder with 10 holes to go in the unfinished 3rd round.","Kartik Singh, 15, is the youngest player from the subcontinent to make the cut on the Asian Tour.

White jerseys rule the Super Bowl—except for a few rebels

How does the NFL decide Super Bowl uniforms? It’s more complicated than it looks

Chiefs vs. Eagles jersey records—one of them has never worn white

The Kansas City Chiefs are sticking to what worked. They beat the Eagles in Super Bowl LVII wearing white. Now, with the same opponent in Super Bowl LIX, they’ll be in white again. Coincidence? Maybe. But here’s the wild part—16 of the last 20 Super Bowl winners also wore white.The Eagles, as the ""home"" team this year, chose their iconic green jerseys. This left Kansas City with white, and, if history holds up, that could be all they need to walk away with another Lombardi Trophy.Teams wearing white have a 64% win rate, taking 37 of 58 Super Bowls.And recently? It's been even more dominant. Since 2005, 16 out of 20 champions wore white. That’s why many teams don’t leave it to chance anymore. They opt for white when the stakes are sky-high.But then there are the outliers. The 2011 Packers, 2018 Eagles, and the 2020 and 2024 Chiefs all bucked the trend. Kansas City, in fact, did it twice while wearing red—beating the 49ers and then taking an overtime thriller against them again in Super Bowl LVIII. The Eagles pulled off their own upset in 2018, rocking their midnight green against Tom Brady’s Patriots.For Super Bowl LIX, the Eagles chose their signature green, forcing the Chiefs into white once again. Will the white jerseys reign supreme, or can the Eagles break football's biggest superstition?The Super Bowl may be on neutral ground, but there’s always a designated home and away team. The NFL alternates this honor every year. Even-numbered years? NFC teams are home. Odd-numbered years? AFC takes it.The home team picks their jersey color, and the opposing team has to contrast. In 2023, the Eagles chose green for Super Bowl LVII, which made the Chiefs wear white. Now it’s déjà vu. The Eagles picked green again for Super Bowl LIX, so Kansas City will wear white—again.Some teams lean into this jersey superstition hard. Remember when the Buccaneers hosted Super Bowl LV at their own stadium? They still picked white jerseys. The Rams did the opposite in 2022, rocking white at their home Super Bowl because they were officially the ""away"" team.The Eagles have been to five Super Bowls and never worn white. Their record in those games? Not great. They’re 1-3 in green jerseys. That one win came against the Patriots in 2018 when they broke the white jersey winning streak.Kansas City, on the other hand, knows both colors. They've worn white in two Super Bowls and split the results (1-1). When they wear red, though, they’re nearly unstoppable with a 3-1 record.This matchup is a rematch of their 2023 showdown, where the Chiefs edged out the Eagles 38-35 in a nail-biter. Now, the Eagles are hungry for revenge, but Kansas City could become the first team in NFL history to win three consecutive Super Bowls.Also Read : ""I dislike them both"": Michael Strahan explains his “mixed” emotions about the Super Bowl match between the Chiefs and Eagles",The Chiefs beat the Eagles in Super Bowl LVII wearing white. 16 out of the last 20 Super Bowl winners also wore white.

When fans are there, when fans are chanting, it gives me the added motivation. At the same time, I really want to do well for them,"" Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya told the BCCI in a video after playing a stellar role in India's 15-run win against England in Pune on Friday.The fans will be packed in at the Wankhede too on Sunday.Yes, the same Wankhede that had given Pandya such a hard time during the IPL as he came in to Mumbai Indians as skipper from the Gujarat Titans and replaced five-time trophy-winning captain Rohit Sharma.The same crowd cheered him on as chants of ""Hardik, Hardik"" rung the warm air around Churchgate's 'D' Road when the team participated in a victory parade on Marine Drive and drove into a throbbing Wankhede after India's victory in the T20 World Cup in which he took 11 wickets and scored 144 runs.Hardik may not be in the leadership group of the white-ball set up anymore for curious reasons, but he is an undesignated leader and an asset as few players play the situation better than the 31-year-old.That is also the reason why India move him up and down the order. No.5 in Kolkata when the contest was done, No.6 in Chennai when they needed someone to move the game along a bit with Tilak, but it did not work. No.5 in Rajkot's 35-ball 40, which seemed like a blockathon by T20I standards and was rightfully criticised. In Pune, India held him back till No.7 as they wanted to take the attacking option of Shivam Dube against Adil Rashid.How beautifully the move worked. Till the time Dube had his fill against Rashid, Hardik worked the ball around. It was only after the pacers returned that he took most of the strike and let his wonderful bat speed and timing do the work for him. Also, the swag. Like he displayed during that no-look six off Jamie Overton, or the lofted off-drive against the pacy Jofra Archer.All his eight boundaries (four fours, four sixes) during his 30-ball 53 were struck against the pacers exhibiting a combination of timing and strength.""Batting has always been my number one love or close to my heart. That's a very satisfying day on Friday,"" the allrounder said in a video posted by BCCI on 'X'.Hardik's outgoing nature and the love for bling and the good life makes him a misunderstood cricketer, often making him an easy target for trolls. But after giving up on red-ball cricket due to fitness issues, he has prioritised white-ball cricket and has tried to be in top shape for key events.""For me, I love this sport way too much; it's been my life, it's been my priority, it's been my first love. The sport does not wait much, your first love always gives you the kiss back,"" he said in quintessential Hardik style.The most experienced member of the current T20 set up with 113 caps, Hardik now feels the need to give back to the sport through special performances. ""The sport has given me so much love that I always feel like I have to turn up and be very honest and loyal to the sport,"" he said.And the fans?""I love to entertain the crowd and make sure every penny what they've spent is worth it,"" he stressed.Wankhede awaits another Hardik special.",India all-rounder Hardik Pandya says he has always played for the fans.

Dejected fans leave the stadium after Virat Kohli's early dismissal

NEW DELHI: The controversy over Harshit Rana coming in as a concussion substitute for Shivam Dube during the fourth T20I between India and England in Pune has continued to spread, with former players questioning the decision. Even England captain Jos Buttler openly stated that Rana was not a ""like-for-like"" replacement for Dube.Rana made history by becoming the first player to make his T20I debut mid-match as a concussion substitute among full-member teams.He replaced all-rounder Dube, who was struck on the back of the head by a Jamie Overton delivery in the final over of India’s innings. While the move played a key role in India's 15-run victory, it also sparked intense debate over its fairness.Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin strongly criticised the on-field officials and the match referee for allowing the substitution, calling it a case of ""pure cricketing miscalculation.""""The game is done. India captured yet another series at home. T20I has been a real juggernaut of a win. What was this game? It was like a replica of the IPL. Supersub was there, and the game was played with an impact player,"" Ashwin said on his YouTube channel 'Ash Ki Baat'.""The entire discussion is about how Harshit Rana came in as a concussion substitute for Shivam Dube. Did we forget that it was an international match and play an IPL match? I can understand. It has happened in the past. Ravindra Jadeja got concussed in Canberra, and Yuzvendra Chahal came in as a substitute. I don't understand this. At least previously, Chahal came in for Jadeja, a spinner for a spinner.""Ashwin further argued that Ramandeep Singh should have been the ideal concussion substitute instead of Rana, urging lawmakers to review and refine the concussion rules.""Here, Harshit came in for Shivam Dube. There is no role of the Indian or England team. If there is no one in the squad, then you can say that Harshit Rana can bat a bit and Shivam Dube can bowl a bit, that's why we brought him in. Like-for-like replacement Ramandeep Singh was sitting outside. I don't understand,"" he said.""This is a case of pure cricketing miscalculation, either on the part of the umpires or the part of the match referee. Ramandeep Singh was there, like-for-like for Shivam Dube. But not him. Harshit Rana was chosen as the concussion substitute. I think people in charge should look into this.""Ashwin's concerns echoed those of former India pacer Zaheer Khan , who also questioned the decision. While acknowledging that teams have the right to nominate a player, Zaheer insisted that the match referee should have ensured the replacement met the criteria.""Maybe Ramandeep [Singh] would have been the ideal choice,"" Zaheer said. ""The match referee’s role was to say, ‘Okay, you have nominated this player, but he doesn’t suit the criteria exactly, so suggest another player who is actually a batter who can bowl, rather than a bowler who can bat.’""With questions mounting, cricketing authorities may now face calls for a review of concussion substitution protocols to prevent further controversy in international matches.","Harshit Rana made history by becoming the first player to make his T20I debut mid-match as a concussion substitute among full-member teams.

Career and personal life

Bonnie Blue , a 25-year-old OnlyFans creator from Derbyshire , claims to have set a world record by having sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours, reports Daily Mail.The event took place in London, allegedly surpassing the previous record of 919 men in 24 hours set by adult actress Lisa Sparks in 2004, with Bonnie claiming she ""bedded 1,057 in 12 hours.""In a video shared on TikTok, Bonnie thanked those who participated, saying, “Thank you to all the barely legal, barely breathing and the husbands.”She added that her skin looked better after the event and described the experience: “The room was absolutely full. We did groups of five, like one after the other. It was a rotating circle.”Her PR team confirmed the tally, stating, “She slept with 1,057 people. As she hit 1,000, there were still 57 left in the queue who Bonnie wanted to pleasure before ending the 12-hour day.” Calculations suggest she averaged 41 seconds per partner.The stunt sparked outrage online, with comments such as “How embarrassing” and “Sad that men would want to do that too—all for fame and money.” Bonnie is no stranger to controversy, having previously defended her claims of sleeping with “barely legal” 18-year-olds and encouraging men to cheat on their wives.Bonnie's real name is Tia Billinger , who says she earns up to £750,000 a month from her OnlyFans content. Despite criticism, she insists her work is educational. “I can’t think of one situation where an 18-year-old has had sex where they’ve had to bring a passport, sign consent forms, and do a breathalyser,” she said on ITV’s This Morning.She also addressed criticism for sleeping with married men, arguing, “If wives aren’t going to pleasure husbands, let them go elsewhere. It’s just an act; the husbands mean nothing to me.”Bonnie transitioned to sex work after moving to Australia in 2022 with her now ex-husband, Oliver Davidson. Formerly a recruitment professional, she launched her career as a cam girl and later joined OnlyFans.She claims her family now supports her career, with her mother even assisting her business by booking appointments and handing out condoms for marketing. “It’s changed their life completely for the better,” she said.Bonnie defended her actions, stating, “These 18-year-olds can go to the army, they can drive, they can drink… If they want to use their own bodies to come and sleep with me, that is their decision.”","Bonnie Blue, 25, claims to have had sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours.

What does Shubman Gill's horoscope say about his captaincy future

Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has criticised the squad selected for the upcoming Champions Trophy 2025 by the hosts, calling it “a political selection” and blaming the national selection committee for making controversial decisions.In the squad announced on Friday, all-rounder Faheem Ashraf made a surprise return after almost two years on the sidelines, a decision Latif finds questionable.""It seems a political selection,"" Latif told Telecomeasia.net. ""Faheem has no recent performance to warrant a selection, and his record isn't impressive.""Ashraf’s ODI record includes 26 wickets in 34 ODIs at an average of 46.30, while his batting figures in 24 innings stand at a mere 10.66 average with a highest score of 28.Latif pointed out that Pakistan had successfully experimented with new players during their recent tours of Australia, Zimbabwe, and South Africa but opted against retaining them. ""This squad includes players like Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman , and Saud Shakeel, who were not part of the system on the last three tours. Now, it is up to captain Mohammad Rizwan to select the best XI, just as Imran Khan did in 1992 and Younis Khan in 2009,"" he said.Latif also backed Babar Azam’s move to open the innings but raised concerns about Pakistan’s bowling attack. ""I think Babar will be useful as an opener, but the main issue is who will take wickets in the 11-20 and 31-40 over phases. That has been Pakistan’s weakness, as we suffered in the 2023 World Cup in those areas.""Former Pakistan fast bowler Tanvir Ahmed went even further, calling the squad ""a joke.""""We have selected a squad that is a joke in our conditions,"" Tanvir told Telecomeasia.net. ""Look at India, they have four quality spinners in Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, and Axar Patel. And we? Just one spinner in Abrar Ahmed .""Tanvir accused the selectors of favoritism, saying, ""This is a squad picked on perchi (recommendations), and for that, the selection committee must take responsibility.

Gulf Giants returned to winning ways with a commanding seven-wicket victory over the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders in the ILT20 at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium on Saturday. The win propelled the Giants to third place in the standings, strengthening their playoff chances, while ensuring MI Emirates joined Desert Vipers in the playoffs.Desperate for a win to stay in contention, the Giants produced a clinical bowling display, restricting the Knight Riders to a modest 123 for 7.Their chase was anchored by a crucial 70-run stand between Gerhard Erasmus and Tom Curran , with a finishing flourish from Shimron Hetmyer The Giants made a steady start before David Willey turned the game momentarily, dismissing James Vince and Jordan Cox in consecutive deliveries. With the scoreboard reading 27/2 after the powerplay, the pressure was on the Giants as Willey and Sunil Narine kept things tight. By the 10-over mark, they had crawled to 50/2.Momentum shifted in the 11th over as Curran went after Andre Russell, smashing a four, a six, and another four to collect 17 runs. This gave the Giants the push they needed, as they plundered 12 more off Terrance Hinds’ next over. Sitting comfortably at 82/2 with seven overs left, the chase was well under control.Erasmus fell to Jason Holder in the 15th over, but Hetmyer’s arrival ensured no late hiccups. A boundary off his first few balls, coupled with extras from Narine, eased the chase. Hetmyer then launched a massive six off Irbar Ahmad and struck the winning runs to seal a dominant victory.Earlier, Abu Dhabi Knight Riders had a nightmare start, losing both Kyle Mayers and Andries Gous inside the first three overs. They struggled to 3/2 before Roston Chase’s brief resistance took them to 24/2 at the end of the powerplay. Chase fell for 15, bringing Willey to the crease, who formed a 29-run stand with Joe Clarke.However, scoring remained tough, and the Knight Riders were stuck at 55/3 after 12 overs when Clarke fell to Chris Jordan. Russell’s arrival sparked a brief revival, with Willey smashing two sixes and Russell adding a couple of boundaries. But Curran removed Russell for 9, leaving the Knight Riders at 80/5 with five overs left.Willey tried to push the total with a six off Mark Adair but was dismissed the next ball after a valuable 41 off 29 deliveries. Local talent Alishan Sharafu attempted a late surge but found little support as the Knight Riders managed just three boundaries in the last four overs, finishing at 123/7.Abu Dhabi Knight Riders captain Sunil Narine acknowledged the tough conditions: “I think they bowled brilliantly and used the conditions to their advantage. We tried to take as many wickets as possible in the powerplay. We couldn't take many in the middle overs, and it became easier for them.”Player of the match Dan Worrall praised his team’s bowling unit: “Opening the bowling with Mark, we had to get us off to a good start. Our bowling group prides itself on diversity - left-arm, right-arm, tall and short, we have a bit of everything. We’re glad that we’ve at least given ourselves a fighting chance.”With the win, the Gulf Giants remain in the playoff hunt, while the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders face an uphill battle to stay in contention.","Gulf Giants returned to winning ways with a commanding seven-wicket victory over the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders in the ILT20 at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium on Saturday.

'I'm really enjoying the cricket': Brevis after MI Cape Town dominate high-scoring SA20 clash

Durban's Super Giants ended their Season 3 campaign on a high note with an exciting 11-run DLS victory over Joburg Super Kings at the Wanderers on Saturday.

Later, Wiaan Mulder played a key role with a steady 30 not out, adding an unbroken 70-run stand with Klaasen to push DSG to a competitive 173/4.JSK's Lutho Sipamla was the pick of the bowlers, delivering an impressive four-over spell, conceding just 24 runs and dismissing Australian allrounder Marcus Stoinis.However, Joburg's chase faced an unexpected hurdle when rain interrupted play, with the home team at 31/1 after 3.1 overs. Following a lengthy delay, play resumed with a revised target of 147 from 16 overs.After the restart, JSK struggled to find momentum, with DSG's young leg-spinner Noor Ahmad producing a match-defining spell of 3/25. DSG also handed rookie CJ King his SA20 debut, and the youngster made an instant impact by dismissing England's white-ball champion Moeen Ali.Despite these setbacks, Donovan Ferreira launched a fierce counterattack, smashing the fastest half-century of the season off just 21 balls. His explosive innings of 51 off 22 deliveries, including two fours and five sixes, brought JSK within striking distance, reducing the equation to 17 runs off the final four balls.However, DSG's Dwaine Pretorius held his nerve under immense pressure, dismissing Ferreira and Sipamla off successive deliveries to seal the win.The victory marked a strong finish to DSG's campaign, while JSK now turn their attention to a must-win Eliminator battle against Sunrisers Eastern Cape.","DSG beat Joburg Super Kings by 11 runs at the Wanderers on Saturday.

Buttler's 'We're going to play 12 as well' jibe sets the stage for fifth T20I showdown

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

MUMBAI: A justified sense of England feeling robbed offers context to a dead rubber as the resentful visitors take on hosts India in the fifth and final T20I at the Wankhede today.India have already taken an unassailable 3-1 lead in the series, thanks to their controversial 15-run win in the fourth game in Pune on Friday.That was after match referee and former Indian pacer Javagal Srinath curiously allowed the home team to field pacer Harshit Rana as a concussion substitute for all-rounder Shivam Dube , whose bowling is his weaker wing.England skipper Jos Buttler 's smile did a terrible job of masking his anger at the post-match media duties. ""It is not a like-for-like replacement. We don't agree with that,"" Buttler said after India completed a 15-run win.""Either Shivam Dube has put on about 25mph with the ball or Harshit has really improved his batting. We should have gone on to win the match, but we disagree with the decision,"" he added.While admitting that it was not the only factor in England losing, Buttler chose to twist the dagger further into the Indian team's conscience, by joking, ""Maybe at the toss next game, I'll say we're going to play 12 as well.""This fascinating subplot aside, India, despite having the series in their bag, would want to address some key issues. Like the form and returns of opener and wicketkeeper Sanju Samson and skipper Surya Kumar Yadav (SKY).Samson, who has scored just 35 runs in four games and has been out pulling the short ball on each occasion, thanks to his trigger movement of shuffling outside leg stump and back, will like to play an impactful innings. His glovework was also patchy in Pune and repeated failures won't cut ice with the selectors as India are blessed with many options for both the opening position as well as the wicket-keeping slot.SKY too needs to deliver. Captaining India for the first time on his home turf may just be the spur that he needs. He has led in the IPL once here when he captained Mumbai Indians to victory against Kolkata Knight Riders in April 2023.SKY's last significant knock was against Bangladesh in Hyderabad in Oct 2024 when he made 75. His returns in the last eight games read an embarrassing 21, 4, 1, DNB, 0, 12, 14, 0.The Wankhede, with its truer bounce and inviting short boundaries, could offer a welcome ticket to form for the skipper.The venue is also one of Buttler's happy hunting grounds especially in the IPL where he has scored 700 runs in 21 games with a ton and three half-centuries at an average of 36.84 and a strike-rate of 146.75. What he will appreciate more is the fact that in white-ball cricket, spin is not a factor, especially under lights because of heavy dew. His batters have been woeful against spin.This may trigger a change in tactics from India too. They know now that the accidental injection of pace in the form of Harshit in the last game enabled them to break their pattern of relying excessively on spin. He also offered the reliable Arshdeep Singh some support.With the series done, will India choose to rest Arshdeep and pick Mohammed Shami to enable the team and support staff to pump in more miles in the legs of the veteran seamer before the ODI series and the Champions Trophy?Champion sides find ways to win by increasing the difficulty quotient. Defending a target in dewy conditions should be the goal for the hosts, keeping the 2026 T20 WC in mind.","India have already taken an unassailable 3-1 lead in the series, thanks to their controversial 15-run win in the fourth game in Pune on Friday.

NEW DELHI: The penultimate round of the 87th Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025 on Saturday witnessed a series of impressive results for the Indian contingent in Wijk aan Zee.In a commanding performance, R Praggnanandhaa secured his sixth win of the tournament, defeating Serbia’s Alexey Sarana with the white pieces.Playing an Indian Game with an all-pawn opening, Pragg transitioned into a Queen’s Gambit Declined.Sarana, showing early aggression, captured a couple of Pragg’s pieces.However, having the advantage of the first move, Pragg dictated the pace of the game. When Sarana miscalculated with Nb5 on his 21st move, the Indian grandmaster capitalised with a crucial Nxa6+ on move 22, seizing control.From that point, Sarana could only make desperate attempts to salvage the position. Pragg delivered the final blow on move 29 (Qb7+), forcing Sarana into resignation before the game reached 30 moves.Round 12 also brought an unexpected twist, as Arjun Erigaisi, who had struggled with both health and form throughout the tournament, secured his first win of the Tata Steel Masters 2025. Incredibly, his victim was Nodirbek Abdusattorov , the Uzbek grandmaster who had remained unbeaten until this encounter.The game, featuring the Nimzo-Indian Defence, saw multiple exchanges across the board. Playing with composure rather than aggression, Arjun capitalised on Abdusattorov’s Qg5 blunder on the 24th move. With Arjun’s g4 pawn attacking the Uzbek’s queen, Abdusattorov was forced into retreat.Although a misstep from Arjun on move 32 (Rxc6) momentarily gave Abdusattorov the upper hand, the Indian quickly recovered with precise queen and bishop manoeuvres. When Arjun captured Abdusattorov’s rook with Qxb8, the Uzbek resigned.Before this defeat, Abdusattorov had been a serious contender for the Masters title, keeping pace with Gukesh and Praggnanandhaa at the top of the leaderboard. The loss now leaves him behind the two Indians with a score of 7.5/12.In the longest game of Round 12 Masters, Gukesh Dommaraju let a winning position slip, settling for a draw against 2021 Tata Steel Masters champion Jorden van Foreest.Defending with Black, Gukesh played against a Queen’s Gambit Declined setup. A few misplaced knight and bishop moves put him in early trouble, but he recovered momentum through sharp queen play—only to blunder it away with 47. Rf7. With the game reaching a deadlock, Gukesh agreed on a draw.Elsewhere, Indian GM Leon Luke Mendonca held top seed Fabiano Caruana to a hard-fought draw, while Pentala Harikrishna also split points with Germany’s Vincent Keymer. Notably, both Harikrishna and Keymer were part of Gukesh’s preparation team for the World Chess Championship match against Ding Liren of China.Meanwhile, Dutch No. 1 Anish Giri extended his unbeaten streak to 11 matches, drawing against defending Masters champion Wei Yi of China. Vladimir Fedoseev, who had lost to Mendonca in Round 11, bounced back with a win over Dutch GM Max Warmerdam.ALSO SEE: Tata Steel Chess 2025 Schedule In the Challengers section, 11-year-old Argentinian prodigy Faustino Oro defeated 14-year-old Lu Miaoyi of China in a thrilling battle of young talents.

NEW DELHI: India’s chess prodigy and youngest-ever World Chess Champion Gukesh Dommaraju has ascended to World No. 3 after a solid draw against Wei Yi of China at the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025 in Wijk aan Zee.Meanwhile, Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa pocketed a sensational victory over top seed Fabiano Caruana, making it a phenomenal Friday for Indian chess on Dutch soil.Fresh from a rest day, Gukesh faced a tough test against the defending champion of the Masters. Playing with the white pieces, the Indian youngster opened with a King’s Pawn, leading to a classic Italian Game. The early exchanges were sharp, with both players castling by move five.A major turning point came when Gukesh sacrificed Wei’s queen with Qxd8, forcing an immediate response (Rfxd8) from the Chinese grandmaster.As the game approached the endgame phase, both players had a rook each — Gukesh relied on his bishop, while Wei Yi looked to create complications with his knight.However, neither could break through, leading to a handshake and a draw.With this result, Gukesh maintained his position at the top of the Masters standings as the sole leader with 8/11 points.The biggest shock of the round came when Praggnanandhaa outplayed top-seed Caruana in a masterful display. Playing with the black pieces, Pragg responded to Caruana’s English Opening with the Agincourt Defense, gradually seizing control of the board.The battle remained evenly poised until Caruana’s misstep on move 32 (Qe3), which allowed Praggnanandhaa to unleash a devastating knight manoeuvre.Within just five more moves, Pragg had sealed a stunning 37-move victory, handing Caruana another shocking defeat in what has been a topsy-turvey tournament so far for the American.With the aforementioned results on Friday, Gukesh overtook Caruana in the live ratings, securing the World No. 3 spot with 2793.2 Elo points, while Caruana slipped to 2792.4.One of the day’s most intriguing results saw Leon Luke Mendonca secure his first win of the tournament by toppling Vladimir Fedoseev of Slovenia.Fedoseev, having gained popularity as the ""giant killer"" after beating Arjun Erigaisi, Caruana, Vincent Keymer, and Pentala Harikrishna, found himself on the receiving end this time. Mendonca, playing with black, staged a remarkable fightback to claim victory.Meanwhile, Pentala Harikrishna notched up his third win of the tournament, defeating Alexey Sarana in 40 moves. Arjun Erigaisi, who has had a challenging tournament so far, held former one-time champion of Wijk aan Zee, Jorden van Foreest, to a draw. The longest match of the round saw Vincent Keymer and Nodirbek Abdusattorov battle for 77 moves before agreeing to a draw. Dutch No. 1 Anish Giri continued his 10-game unbeaten streak with a win, defeating compatriot Max Warmerdam on Friday.ALSO SEE: Tata Steel Chess 2025 Schedule In the Challengers section, Divya Deshmukh claimed her second win of the tournament by defeating Irina Bulmaga of Romania, while Vaishali Rameshbabu suffered a tough loss against Aydin Suleymanli of Azerbaijan.

Replacing a big-hitting batting all-rounder, who has bowled one over in the [2024] IPL, with a bowler who can't bat and bowls heavy seam, makes no sense to me whatsoever.""England still really should have won the game. They probably would have rather faced a pace bowler than a spinner, to be honest, but I still don't understand it.""India have Washington Sundar on the bench, who Dube replaced. but instead they bring in a heavy bowler, who bowls 140-odd [kmph].

PUNE: Pacer Harshit Rana, leggie Ravi Bishnoi and allrounders Shivam Dube and Hardik Pandya played starring roles as India won the fourth match of the T20I series against England on Friday, and with it the series.The home team now has a 3-1 lead following Friday's 15-run win at the Gahunje stadium, making the fifth and last match now inconsequential.Batting first, India made a competitive 181/9 after losing the toss and recovering from 12/3 after two overs. Then they restricted England to 166 for their 17th successive series win.The left-handed Dube, who came in for Washington Sundar, rode on his luck to score 53 (34b; 7x4, 2x6). He was dropped by Jos Buttler at slip off Adil Rashid before he had scored a run. Dube forged a vital partnership with Hardik Pandya (53 off 30b; 4x4, 4x6). After Dube was hit on the helmet, India managed to squeeze in a concussion substitute in paceman Rana.Harshit ended with figures of 3/33 to play a pivotal role in the game, but England should also blame themselves for some careless batting. They were 62-0 before losing three wickets for five runs.From 129-4 in the 15th over, England slipped to 146-8 after 17. The first blip was caused by Ben Duckett (39 off 19b; 7x4, 1x6), who was dealing in boundaries until he hit straight to Suryakumar Yadav at extra cover. The second came with Harry Brook's brain fade and resultant scoop off Varun Chakravarthy that ended in the hands of short fine-leg.Bishnoi (3/28) got Duckett in the Powerplay and left-armer Axar Patel removed Phil Salt the next over. Varun too did his bit with 2-28. Earlier, Hardik (53, 30b, 4x4s, 4x6s) and Dubey (53, 34b, 7x4s, 2x6s) went berserk from the 16th to the 18th over, the duo eventually putting on 87 runs off 44 balls for the sixth wicket.Hardik treated speedster Jofra Archer with disdain, clearing the ground cleanly. He also hit a breathtaking four between the tiny gap of straightened long off and deep widish long-off. He hit waist high full toss no-ball off Jamie Overton for four in the 18th over.Dube slogged, hoicked and punched boundaries and then came up with a Natraj pose four off Overton. Together, they scored 53 off 17 balls starting from the 16th over, with four fours and four sixes. The preceding 17 balls had given India just 27 runs. India's top order was not willing to gauge the pace and bounce of the wicket or the strategy of England bowlers, and they paid the price.Earlier, pacer Saqib Mahmood , who came in for Mark Wood, had a three wicket maiden in the innings' second over. Leg-spinner Adil Rashid, introduced in the eighth over, came up with another masterly exhibition of variations in speed, line and length.Dube, meanwhile, slogged, hoicked and punched boundaries and then came up with an excellent four off Overton.",India beat England by 15 runs to take a 3-1 lead in the T20 series.

I think we are moving in the right direction.""But in the last over, Dube was hit on the helmet and removed, making space for Harshit Rana's surprising but ideal T20I debut.""I knew we could control the game after the powerplay. We picked a few wickets. Post drinks, Harshit Rana came in as the third seamer and delivered,"" Suryakumar said.With an incredible three-wicket haul, Rana took advantage of the situation.""It is still a dream debut for me. When Dube came back, after two overs I was informed I will be the concussion substitute ,"" Rana said.The young pacer disclosed that he had been training for this chance for a long time prior to the series.""I have been preparing for a while, not just for this series. I have been waiting for this moment [his debut] to prove myself. When I got the chance, I did not think of the circumstances and just thought about delivering. I have experience of bowling at the death [for KKR in the IPL] and relied on that,"" Rana said.England captain Jos Buttler acknowledged that his team squandered the opportunity after a solid start and said they were unable to build on the early breakthroughs.""We started brilliantly, taking wickets in the powerplay and we were in a great position at the end of the batting powerplay. We should have gone onto win the game.He pointed out England's major mistakes, such as a costly missed catch.""...We dropped Dube first ball and he went to play a really good innings. With the bat, we were in a fantastic position and lost a couple of key wickets.""",India defeated England by 15 runs in the 4th T20I in Pune. Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube led the innings to 181/9.
