Tom Brady admitted to one Lamar Jackson record that he could never complete

Lamar Jackson 's MVP performance in the Baltimore Ravens ' 41-38 overtime win over the Cincinnati Bengals was a standout. The two-time and reigning league MVP completed 26 of 42 pass attempts for 348 yards and four touchdowns, while rushing for 55 yards on 12 carries. His team erased a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter, securing their third straight win and a spot on Fox Sports analyst Tom Brady 's '3 Stars of the Week' list.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes Shared a Heartwarming Moment With His Daughter Before their Upcoming Game Against the New Orleans Saints Tom Brady acknowledged that there is one Lamar Jackson record, he would have no chance to complete. He placed Lamar second on the list, behind Kirk Cousins on the'3 Stars of the Week list. Brady praised the Bengals vs. Ravens game as an ""incredible game,"" where the Ravens overcame a 10-point deficit in the last six minutes. He complimented Lamar's statistical analysis of the Ravens QB's performance. “Lamar’s been unbelievable this season. This is one record that I would have no chance to ever complete. He’s the first player in history to have 300 pass yards, 50 rush yards, and 4 touchdowns in multiple games"", Brady said.Brady has a career record of 132 games with at least 300 passing yards and 41 with four or more touchdowns. However, he never had a game with 50 rushing yards. Jackson, on the other hand, is one of the greatest dual-threat quarterbacks in NFL history, having only gone past the 30-yard mark once in his career.Lamar Jackson became the first NFL quarterback to finish a game with 300+ passing yards, 50+ rushing yards, and 4+ passing touchdowns in Week 5 of the 2021 season. He completed the game with 442 passing yards, four touchdown passes, and 62 rushing yards on 14 carries. Only eight other players have achieved this feat, including Josh Allen, Mitchell Trubisky, Alex Smith, Deshaun Watson, Michael Vick, Bobby Hoying, and Steve Young. Jackson's historic performance helped the Ravens extend their winning streak to three.Brady praised Lamar but missed mentioning Bengals QB Joe Burrow, who had a career-high five touchdowns and 392 yards rushing. Burrow was left out of the list of top three players of the week. Kirk Cousins was praised for orchestrating the Falcons' comeback win over the Buccaneers.Also Read: Could the Pittsburgh Steelers Prefer Russell Wilson Over Justin Fields as Their Next Quarterback?","Lamar Jackson became the first NFL quarterback to finish a game with 300+ passing yards, 50+ rushing yards, and 4+ passing touchdowns in Week 5 of the 2021 season.

The Squad:

KOLKATA: On an expected line, wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan made a return to his Jharkhand state team as captain for the first two games of 2024-25 Ranji Trophy season.It was on Wednesday that Jharkhand State Cricket Association ( JSCA ) announced a 16-member squad for their first two games of the domestic red-ball tournament which will kick off across the country on Oct 11.While Jharkhand will start their campaign with an away game against Assam on Friday, they will next play Railways in Ahmedabad from Oct 18-21.As captain, Ishan is all set to lead a young squad after long-serving domestic stalwarts like Shahbaz Nadeem, Saurabh Tiwary and Varun Aaron all retired at the end of the last season. Last season’s designated captain, Virat Singh has been named Kishan's deputy while Kumar Kushagra is expected to don the wicketkeeper's gloves.Last season, Jharkhand finished third from the bottom in Group A. They won and lost two each and drew three of their seven Ranji Trophy matches.Earlier this year, Ishan was excluded from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) central contract for his reluctance to play domestic cricket last season during the international break.During his time away from India matches, the southpaw was conspicuous by his absence from any official BCCI games, too, citing personal reasons. Taking note of this the board had emphasised on taking domestic cricket seriously by the India regulars, when they are not on national duty.The 26-year-old Mumbai Indians player then resurfaced in February this year, playing in DY Patil T20 Cup – a private tournament – in Navi Mumbai, as part of his preparations for the 2024 Indian Premier League (IPL). This added fuel to the fire of the debate of franchise versus state cricket.However, the explosive batter is gradually working his way back into the board's reckoning with notable performances in domestic cricket, including a century for India C on his return in Duleep Trophy last month. Kishan then represented Rest of India (RoI) in Irani Cup, scoring 38 in his only innings as Mumbai secured their 15th crown.Ishan Kishan (c), Virat Singh (vc), Kumar Kushagra (wk), Nazim Siddique, Aryaman Sen, Sharandeep Singh, Kumar Suraj, Anukul Roy, Utkarsh Singh, Supriyo Chakraborty, Saurabh Shekhar, Vikas Kumar, Vivekanand Tiwary, Manishi, Ravi Kumar Yadav and Raunak Kumar.",Wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan made a return to his Jharkhand state team as captain for the first two games of 2024-25 Ranji Trophy season.

With their backs to the wall, Harmanpreet Kaur & Co had only one choice – to turn around and fight. Fight they did and how! On the brink of an early exit from the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup, India sizzled in the Dubai heat on Wednesday. They registered a resounding 82-run victory – the highest margin of victory by India in a T20 World Cup tie – over Sri Lanka to pull themselves back into contention.It wasn’t just the margin of victory, but the team’s show of strength and character that stood out. India ticked all the boxes to jump to the second place in Group A with six points and a run rate of 0.576.After a five-match lull, Harmanpreet fired up her cold bat when it was most needed. Harmanpreet’s unbeaten 27-ball 52 (8x4; 1x6), along with a fine 98-run opening stand between Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana , ensured India posted a competitive 172/3, the highest team total in the tournament so far.In reply, Sri Lanka crumbled like a pack of cards as Arundhati Reddy (3/19) and Asha Sobhana (3/19) led the attack to bowl Lanka out for 90 in 19.5 overs.The form of the troika came as a welcome sign for India, who have struggled to come together as a team in the tournament thus far. Indian batter’s strike rate has been worrying and Harmanpreet, who scored at a strike rate which was a shade over 192, eased some nerves.To stay in contention for a last-four berth, a high score was a necessity for India and hence it was hardly surprising that they chose to bat first.Shafali and Smriti, who have struggled against spin, were welcomed by spin duo Inoshi Priyadharshani and Sugandika Kumari. They tested the waters for a couple of overs, before the 20-year-old Shafali found the first boundary, dispatching a Udeshika Prabodhani delivery through extra cover.Shafali continued to do the heavy lifting with occasional boundaries, while Smriti struggled to find gaps. At the end of powerplay, India was 41 for no loss. The duo built on the momentum, with Smriti hammering Inoka for a maximum - India’s first maximum in three matches - in the first over after the powerplay. At the halfway stage, India was cruising at 78 for no loss.",India beat Sri Lanka by 82 runs to move into second place in Group A. Harmanpreet Kaur scored an unbeaten 52 as India posted 172/3. Sri Lanka were bowled out for 90 in 19.5 overs by Arundhati Reddy and Asha Sobhana.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114101944,imgsize-64504,width-400,resizemode-4/114101944.jpg"

MUMBAI: New Zealand’s left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel is leaving no stone unturned to make a mark in the three-Test series against India, beginning from Oct 16 in Bengaluru. Patel, who was born in Mumbai (his parents migrated to New Zealand many years back) and still has relatives here, trained at the MIG Cricket Club on Tuesday.On Thursday, the 35-year-old will fly to Bengaluru where he will hook up with the rest of the Kiwi squad.The spinner, who has taken 70 wickets in 18 Tests@30.42, has a special connection with Mumbai, having become only the third bowler in Test history after Jim Laker and Anil Kumble to log a ‘perfect 10’ when he took 10 for 119 in India’s first innings at the Wankhede Stadium in the second Test in December 2021.In September, Ajaz had requested Mumbai’s Datta Mithbavkar, who was the local manager of the Afghanistan team during the one-off Test between New Zealand and Afghanistan at Greater Noida (the match was entirely washed out due to rain) to arrange for a training facility in Mumbai ahead of New Zealand’s tour of India.“Ajaz had requested me at that time if he could get a facility to practise in Mumbai, since he would arrive a bit earlier to meet his relatives in the city (his wife is also from Jogeshwari). He wanted an outdoor facility, and wanted to practise on a spin-friendly wicket. After that, he was in touch with me. It was Nilesh Bhosle ( Mumbai Cricket Association Apex Council member), who organised a practice session for Ajaz at the MIG Club. He trained for almost 90 minutes and bowled 10-12 overs. He bowled to former India U-19 allrounder Vaibhav Ankolekar, and was impressed with his batting. He gave him tips on bowling left-arm spin too. I had also asked a few young local players, including a couple of left-arm spinners from my academy, to be present and he shared bowling tips with them too,” Datta told TOI on Wednesday","Ajaz Patel trained at the MIG Cricket Club on Tuesday.

Scenarios for India's progression

If India win their match against Australia, they will finish with six points. However, if New Zealand also win their remaining matches against Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and Australia beat Pakistan, all three teams - India, New Zealand, and Australia - will have six points each. In this scenario, net run rate (NRR) will determine which two teams advance to the semifinals from Group A.

India's win over Sri Lanka dropped Pakistan to third place, but with two matches left in the group, Pakistan still have a chance. If Pakistan defeat both Australia and New Zealand in their remaining games, and India also beat Australia, the defending champions will be knocked out, allowing India and Pakistan to advance to the semifinals from Group A.

If Australia win all their remaining matches, another scenario could emerge where India, Pakistan and New Zealand (assuming one win & one loss in remaining two matches for Pak & NZ) all finish with four points each. In this case, net run rate (NRR) will again come into play to determine which team secures the second spot in the group and advances to the semifinals.

NEW DELHI: India gave a new lease of life to their scratchy campaign in the Women's T20 World Cup with a big 82-run win over Sri Lanka in their penultimate Group A match on Wednesday.This win significantly boosted their chances of qualifying for the semifinals, propelling them to the second spot in the points table.With this emphatic win, India now have four points from three matches, with one game remaining, where they will face defending champions Australia on Sunday.To secure a top-two spot in their group, India will need to replicate their strong performance against Australia and maintain a superior net run rate (NRR) over Pakistan and New Zealand if the standings come down to that.India have had a mixed campaign so far but the recent result over Sri Lanka, which saw them bat with a lot of intent will do their confidence a world of good. Harmanpreet Kaur led from the front with an attacking half-century and the bowlers did a fine job to keep Sri Lanka under check.The first two games saw an underwhelming effort in the field but a much improved show was on display in the do-or-die clash on Wednesday. India would hope for a similar show against Australia on Sunday.","India beat Sri Lanka by 82 runs in their penultimate Group A match on Wednesday.

Steve Smith currently partners Khawaja, but given his inconsistent performance and the strength of India’s bowling lineup, it is being felt that it would be more beneficial for Australia to move him back to No.4, where he has established himself as one of the game’s premier stroke makers.Middle-order player Travis Head has been considered as a potential opener, with first-class cricket officials mentioning this possibility six weeks ago.Specialist openers like Marcus Harris, Cameron Bancroft, and Matt Renshaw are in contention, while all-rounder Cameron Green is now an unlikely option due to concerns over a back injury that could sideline him for the series.With these many moving pieces, Test great Ian Healy says Australian selectors should consider an unorthodox move - play Mitchell Marsh as the opener and keep Head in the middle order.Despite Marsh not having opened the batting in Tests, former Test wicketkeeper Healy has suggested his inclusion.""Travis seems hesitant to move up the order, which I understand. He poses a greater threat when the ball isn't swinging as much,"" Healy commented to SportsBoom.“I think there is a reluctance from Travis to go up, which I would agree with. He is a much more scary proposition when the ball isn’t doing as much,” Healy said on“He should be able to enjoy middle-order freedom. I feel Cameron Green or Mitch Marsh might have been good options, and we know Marnus [Labuschagne] can do that job, but he is also valuable at No.3. I also like Smith opening the batting, maybe more than he does.”Australia's struggles at the top contributed significantly to their failures during their last two Test tours of India. Healy noted, “Now Green has a back injury, the pressure might be off, and Marsh might go out and open, and Smith drops down to four, with Marnus and Head on either side. I am not sure who would bat No.6,” Healy said.Marsh is technically proficient and has opened in multiple ODIs over the past two years, but his Test average stands at a modest 30.45, with three centuries across 42 matches.His numbers drop to 18.33 in five Tests against India, with his last outing against them being in 2018 at the MCG. He has expressed a preference for batting in the middle order within Test cricket.In contrast, Smith holds a career average of 61.5 at No. 4, but has only averaged 28.5 in eight innings since stepping in for the retired David Warner at the top of the order last summer. Legendary Aussie opener Matthew Hayden has remarked it would be ""crazy"" to keep Smith in that position.Additionally, Head recently batted in the middle order for South Australia against NSW in Sydney, under the observation of Australia’s selection chairman George Bailey.",Usman Khawaja and Steve Smith have been Australia's designated openers since David Warner retired. The Border-Gavaskar Trophy gets underway in Perth on 22 November. Ian Healy says Australia should play Mitchell Marsh as the opener and keep Travis Head in the middle order.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114102978,imgsize-62130,width-400,resizemode-4/114102978.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Nitish Kumar Reddy announced himself on the international stage with a flamboyant 74 as a youthful Indian side delivered yet another commanding performance to thrash Bangladesh by 86 runs in the second T20I here on Wednesday. With the win, the hosts took an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.The 21-year-old Reddy (74 off 34 balls) played the most attractive innings of his nascent career while also taking a couple of wickets (2/23) with his seam bowling.Reddy combined with Rinku Singh (53 off 29), who too sizzled with a blistering fifty, to help India post 221/9 after being asked to bat.Aside from an early wobble with the bat, the Indians appeared firmly in control, dominating Bangladesh throughout the match.Their bowlers were on target, and the hosts executed some stunning catches to restrict Bangladesh to 135/9.Reddy and Rinku put up a crucial 108-run stand for the fourth wicket and pulled India out of a precarious situation (41/3).Reddy looked in sublime touch as he effortlessly blasted the Bangladesh attack to hit seven maximums and four boundaries in only 34 balls.Playing only his second T20I, he brought up his maiden fifty in 27 balls by knocking the ball towards long-on.At the other end Rinku, who hit five boundaries and three maximums, also showcased his big-hitting prowess as he smashed the first six of the match off leg-spinner Rishad Hossain in the eighth over.Reddy, too, took a liking for Rishad, pummelling three maximums in the 10th over to take India past 100. The Bangladesh spinner looked clueless against him.He first clobbered one across long on. Rishad erred in his length once again and was met with similar treatment as Reddy slogged it over wide long on. The third six came behind mid wicket.He was eventually sent back by Mustafizur Rehman, who bowled a slower ball, but not before receiving a standing ovation.Chasing the 220 plus total, opener Parvez Hossain Emon came out with an aggressive intent as he pumped the ball to the boundary three time but Arshdeep Singh had the last laugh as the left-arm seamer claimed the Bangladeshi's wicket in his next over.Once the Indians spinners started operating, Bangladesh lost wickets at regular intervals. Captain Najmul Hossain Shanto was next to go as he became Washington Sundar's first victim.Opener Litton Das' woeful run continued as mystery spinner Varun Chakaravarthy struck off his very first ball, continuing from where he left off.The Bangladesh batter found the going tough and seemed happy to deal in singles with the required run rate skyrocketing. Veteran batter Mahmudullah (41 off 39), who is playing his penultimate T20I, was the lone warrior for Bangladesh.Earlier put into bat, the Indian top-order was outfoxed by the pace trio of Tanzim Hasan (2/26), Mustafizur Rehman (2/36) and Taskin Ahmed (2/16). They varied their pace to get the desired results.Bangladesh started the innings with some spin in the form of Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Sanju Samson (10) punished the off-spinner with back-to-back boundaries to plunder 15 runs from the first over.But Samson bungled up his start, getting out to Taskin in the next over. After only two runs in the second over, Abhishek Sharma (15) slammed back-to-back boundaries and looked to slog Tanzim Hasan but the 147kmph delivery induced an inside edge, which resulted in his off-stump going for a walk.Shanto introduced Mustafizur into the attack in the sixth over and the experienced campaigner started off with slower deliveries, with the third one paying dividends as Suryakumar Yadav chipped a cutter straight into the hands off Shanto as India lost their third wicket in the powerplay.",India thrash Bangladesh by 86 runs in second T20I. Hosts take unassailable 2-0 lead in three-match series. Nitish Kumar Reddy scores 74 off 34 balls. Rinku Singh (53 off 29) also hits blistering fifty.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114093769,imgsize-94508,width-400,resizemode-4/114093769.jpg"

India's path to the semifinals complicated by Australia's win

Scenarios for India's progression

If India secure two convincing wins, they will accumulate six points. However, if New Zealand also win their remaining matches — against Pakistan and Sri Lanka — and Australia defeat Pakistan, all three teams (India, New Zealand, and Australia) will end up with six points each. In this scenario, NRR will decide which two teams advance to the semifinals from Group A.

Pakistan also remain in the race for a semifinal spot. They currently hold second place and need to beat both Australia and New Zealand to finish on six points. If Pakistan win both matches and India also beat Australia and Sri Lanka, then India and Pakistan will qualify for the semifinals.

If Australia win all their remaining matches, there could be another scenario of India, Pakistan and New Zealand finishing on four points each. Then NRR will decide the second spot in the group. With India already behind the other two contenders in terms of NRR, they will need a huge victory over Sri Lanka on Tuesday to be ready for such a scenario ahead.

NEW DELHI: Defending champions Australia delivered a commanding performance, defeating New Zealand by 60 runs to climb to the top of Group A in the ICC Women's T20 World Cup , held in the UAE. On Tuesday, Australia set a challenging target of 149 runs, before dismissing New Zealand for just 88 in 19.2 overs.With this comprehensive victory, Australia now have four points from two matches and lead the group with an impressive net run rate (NRR) of +2.524.The loss dropped New Zealand from the top spot to third place in the standings.India's qualification to the semifinals has become more challenging after the Australia vs New Zealand match. But the heavy defeat substantially decreased New Zealand's NRR, giving India an opportunity to catch up with a one-sided victory in their next match.Currently, India sit in fourth place in Group A with two points from two games, the same as Pakistan (now second) and New Zealand, but trail behind due to an inferior NRR. India's NRR of -1.217 is significantly lower than Pakistan's +0.555 and New Zealand's -0.050.To advance to the semifinals, India must win both of their remaining matches — against Sri Lanka on Wednesday and Australia on Sunday — by substantial margins. Improving their NRR is crucial to surpass their rivals and finish in the top two.So, India's chances hinge on not just winning their matches but doing so decisively to boost their NRR above their competitors, starting from today's match against their Asian rivals Sri Lanka.",India's path to the semifinals complicated by Australia's win.

Lucky escape! Harry Brook survives as ball hits wicket but bails remain intact,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/lucky-escape-harry-brook-survives-as-ball-hits-wicket-but-bails-remains-intact/articleshow/114079351.cms,"Harry Brook survives (Screengrabs)

NEW DELHI: Star batter Harry Brook had a stroke of incredible luck during England’s first Test against Pakistan in Multan on Wednesday.In a moment that has left the spectators in awe, Pakistan's Aamer Jamal bowled a delivery at Brook during the 75th over, only for the ball to roll back onto his stumps without dislodging the bails.Jamal's back-of-a-length delivery outside off stump nipped back in as Brook attempted a late stab at it.The ball, deflecting off his body, trickled back toward the stumps, but despite hitting them, the bails remained stubbornly in place.Brook had escaped what could have been a game-changing dismissal.Watch:This moment of fortune for Brook came in stark contrast to the stellar performance of his teammate Joe Root , who stole the show with a majestic hundred.On a historic day, Root broke Alastair Cook ’s record to become England’s highest run-scorer in Test cricket .His masterclass innings of 119 not out helped steer England to 351/3 at tea on day three.Root’s day was filled with milestones. Early in his innings, a straight drive off Jamal saw him surpass Cook’s total of 12,472 runs, a record that had stood since Cook’s retirement in 2018.Root was imperious throughout, reverse-sweeping his way to a 35th Test century, placing him among the top six century-makers in the game.While Brook survived by a whisker, he also played his part in England’s dominance.Unfazed by the near miss, he went on to register a gritty half-century, ending the session unbeaten on 64. Together with Root, the pair put on a 102-run stand, frustrating the Pakistani camp on a flat Multan surface that offered little assistance to the bowlers.","England batsman Harry Brook survives a lucky escape against Pakistan.

Can Joe Root break Sachin Tendulkar's Test records?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/can-joe-root-break-sachin-tendulkars-test-records/articleshow/114074847.cms,"Joe Root jumped places in the list of all-time scorers in Test cricket during the first Pakistan vs England match in Multan. Sachin Tendulkar leads the all-time highest scorers list.

Can Root go past Sachin?

Vaughan backs Root to go past Tendulkar

Most runs in Test cricket:

On the third day of England's opening Test in Pakistan, Joe Root surpassed Alastair Cook on the all-time Test run-scorers list, now only trailing three players in total. The question remains: how high will he climb before retiring?Root's achievement on Wednesday (9 October) not only elevated him past Cook but also established him as England's leading Test run-scorer in history.After Pakistan declared with a hefty score of 556, England faced a significant challenge to reclaim control of the match.Root's crucial partnerships with Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett were instrumental in helping England potentially avoid the follow-on. He broke Cook's record (12,472 runs) when he scored his 71st run of the innings, a four that brought his total to 12,473 runs.Next in Root's sights is Rahul Dravid , who has accumulated 13,288 runs, just one run shy of Jacques Kallis 's 13,289. If Root can close the approximately 800-run gap to Dravid, he will simultaneously surpass Kallis, placing him third on the all-time list.With two Tests in Pakistan, three in New Zealand, and a five-Test home series against India, plus a one-off Test against Zimbabwe, Root could leapfrog two positions by the end of the 2025 home summer, assuming his current scoring pace continues.If he falls short, he is expected to overcome both Dravid and Kallis during the 2025/26 Ashes series.Following Kallis on the list is Ricky Ponting , who is 89 runs adrift (13,378 runs). Root should have the opportunity to surpass Ponting during the 2025/26 Ashes, as he has 16 Tests scheduled between now and the end of that series to close the nearly 900-run gap.Root's career average sits at around 50 runs, but he has performed notably better than that over the last two years. If he continues to score at his current rate, he should pass Ponting by the end of the Ashes unless injuries or there's a significant decline in form. Sachin Tendulkar 's all-time record (15,921 runs) sits a daunting 2,543 runs above Ponting. Closing this gap will be a formidable challenge, especially since Root will turn 35 during the Ashes next year.After the remaining 16 Tests, the ICC Future Tours Programme has England set for three Tests in Sri Lanka, followed by a 2026 home summer featuring three Tests against both New Zealand and Pakistan. England will also play three away Tests in South Africa in 2026, resulting in nine additional Tests after the Ashes by the end of that year.Based on his average of approximately 90 runs per Test over the past four years, Root would need to participate in roughly 40 more matches to surpass Tendulkar's record. With England likely to play over 12 Tests a year, Root would have around 28 matches scheduled between now and the end of 2026.This trajectory suggests he would need to continue playing until at least the end of 2027, when he would be 37, to have a shot at Tendulkar's record.It is worth noting that in the modern era, it is quite rare for English batters to compete in Test cricket beyond their 36th birthday.In fact, this century, only Alec Stewart has played more than a few Tests for England after turning 36. While the demanding nature of England's international cricket schedule contributes to this rarity, as evidenced by James Anderson’s successful career extending to age 41, it shows that with careful planning, continuing at the top level is indeed possible.Former England captain Michael Vaughan said Root can break Tendulkar's record provided he maintains form and longevity.“Joe’s love of the game means he will not be like Alastair Cook, who he overtakes into top spot. Cook retired six years ago, at almost exactly the same age – 33 – that Joe is now. But I see Joe going into his forties, like Anderson has. There is still plenty for him to tick off, including that missing hundred in Australia. But I watch him bat in Australia and do not see a major technical problem, he just has not cracked three figures yet,” Vaughan wrote.“Root is already cricketing royalty and there is no doubt in my eyes that he has become England’s greatest batsman already. No one has played the different forms of the game better than him, and he has got the runs to show for it. If he plays as long as I am sure he will, he will overtake Sachin Tendulkar and be the leading Test run-scorer. More than just being a great player, he does it all with a smile on his face, and is simply the greatest example for young kids to follow,” stated Vaughan further.After the day's play, Root said there are “many more runs still to get”.“I’m obviously proud, but still feel there’s plenty more left to do,” said Root.“I’m sure I’ll look back at it when I’m finished and be very proud of it, but I think more than anything just the way we played today as a team is what stands out,” said Root.“We’ve still got an opportunity to win the game, which is really exciting. Hopefully we can kick on tomorrow.”Sachin Tendulkar - 15,921 runsRicky Ponting - 13,378 runsJacques Kallis - 13,289 runsRahul Dravid - 13,288 runs Joe Root - 12,578* runs (at stumps)","Joe Root surpassed Alastair Cook on the all-time Test run-scorers list.

NEW DELHI: Former England captain Joe Root broke Indian batting legend Sunil Gavaskar 's record of 34 Test hundreds on the third day of the first Test match against Pakistan in Multan on Wednesday.Root achieved the milestone in the second session of the day with a single off Abrar Ahmed. Root had smashed Alastair Cook 's record of 12,472 runs in the first session of the day.Known for his technique against fast bowling, particularly against the fearsome West Indies pace attack in the 1970s and 1980s, Gavaskar was the first batsman to score 10,000 Test runs and 34 Test centuries and was regarded as one of the greatest openers in the history of cricket.Gavaskar's record of 34 Test centuries stood for nearly two decades until Sachin Tendulkar surpassed it.Gavaskar's 34th and final Test century - a score of 176 - came in the first Test against Sri Lanka at Kanpur in December 1986.Root has been excellent against both spin and pace, adaptable in all conditions, and a prolific scorer in modern cricket and has also been among the ""Fab Four"" (alongside Virat Kohli Kane Williamson , and Steve Smith ), and England's all-time leading Test run-scorer.By scoring his 35th Test hundred, Root also surpassed Mahela Jayawardene, Brian Lara and Younis Khan , all of whom had scored 34 Test hundreds.","Former England captain Joe Root breaks Indian batting legend Sunil Gavaskar's record of 34 Test hundreds on the third day of the first Test match against Pakistan.

""I don't think that kind of match happened again."" These were the words of Dhanraj Pillay when a chat in 2020 around the India-Pakistan rivalry took him back to Amstelveen in 2003. Maybe, if allowed to pick from among India's most famous wins since the turn of the century against any nation, the former captain will now surely go with the bronze medal win at Tokyo Olympics instead of that Champions trophy match 21 summers ago.Down 2-4 in the good old 70-minute match against a team that had Rehan Butt flying down the flanks and Sohail Abbas shooting rockets off his flicks, India staged a comeback for the ages in 23 minutes of magic.The backstory for Pillay personally had a narrative of revenge from a year ago, when the Pakistan players celebrated in India captain's face following their 4-3 win in the third-place match in the previous edition of the Champions Trophy.To see his team scoring five goals in 23 minutes a year later to come back from the dead and win made the revenge for Pillay a lot sweeter.The heroes of the day for India were Jugarj Singh, Gagan Ajit Singh and Deepak Thakur , who scored two goals each. But it was Pakistan who took a 2-0 lead in the first 20 minutes with Butt and Muhammad Nadeem scoring. Jugraj scored India's first goal through a penalty corner four minutes later, but Mudassar Ali restored the two-goal cushion for Pakistan by making it 3-1.(Screen Grab: FIH)India got another penalty corner just before half-time, and Jugraj once again cut Pakistan's lead to one goal with his second strike.The teams went in at half-time with Pakistan leading 3-2.Drag-flick legend Sohail Abbas got on the scoresheet in the 42nd minute by finding the net on a penalty corner to make it 4-2.With 28 minutes left on the clock, India needed a goal to stay in the match and put pressure back on Pakistan. They found not just one but five goals.Indian forwards, Gagan in the centre, Thakur on the left and Prabhjot on the right, attacked the Pakistan goal like birds swooping on its prey.In a passage of four minutes between the 50th and the 54th, Thakur and Prabhjot scored to make it 4-4. The comeback stunned Pakistan who had no answer to India's full-press.Six minutes later, between the 60th and 65th, the trio of Indian strikers took life out of Pakistan defence that had no answer to their speed and Pillay's brilliant feeding from the centre.The legend let the young Indian stars take centrestage, and they didn't disappoint.Gagan scored two goals in the 60th and 62nd minute to make it 6-4 and Thakur sealed it at 7-4 in the 65th, as all Pakistan efforts of a comeback in the last five minutes were thwarted by India.The match stands as one of the most epic comebacks ever scripted in India vs Pakistan hockey history.","India staged a comeback for the ages in 23 minutes of magic.

NEW DELHI: In a matter of six months, Nitish Reddy has become India’s next big seambowling allrounder. On Wednesday night at Arun Jaitley Stadium , his clean, big hitting set up a big 86-run win against Bangladesh as India sealed the T20I series 2-0 with another game to go.For India, this series was about checking out the T20 reserve pool. Reddy’s 34-ball 74 would settle a lot of nerves for the selectors and the team management.He was even sent up the order ahead of Hardik Pandya and Riyan Parag as India posted 221/9.Pandya, who opened the bowling in the previous game, was not given the ball to test Reddy’s bowling skills. He didn’t disappoint, returning figures of 2/23 in four overs as Bangladesh limped to 135/9 in 20 overs.The pitch here may have gained a reputation of yielding big scores over the past year, but it wasn’t an easy task for Reddy and Rinku Singh to steady the innings after India had lost three wickets for 41 inside the Powerplay.Rinku, himself deprived of batting time of late, got into rebuilding mode with Reddy and reminded everyone of his finishing skills with a 29-ball 53. India’s younger crop of players are fearless.For them, taking a backward step is always the last option. After a couple of rather quiet overs, Reddy and Rinku went hammer and tongs to put on a 108-run partnership off 48 balls.While Rinku started the onslaught with a six, Reddy picked up the pace and went on a six-hitting spree. Reddy brought up his 50 off 27 balls, Rinku reached his half-century off 26 deliveries. They may be the new kids on the block but they dominated Bangladesh like a couple of alpha males. Since his maiden IPL season this year, Reddy has been touted as a backup for Pandya. For much of his innings, which had seven clean sixes in it, one couldn’t be faulted for mistaking him for Pandya. The lean physique, the poise at the crease and the powerful swats down the ground looked like something that came straight out of Pandya’s playbook.The boundary from longoff to mid-wicket was thoroughly peppered by Reddy. There were no cheeky ramps or smart reverse-sweeps. It was all about maintaining balance, presenting the full face of the bat and driving powerfully down the ground.Reddy definitely ticked most boxes. Once Reddy and Rinku drove India to the big total, it was always going to be an uphill task for the Bangladesh batters against a bowling attack which had varied options.Skipper Suryakumar Yadav tried out seven bowlers. None of them disappointed as the Bangladesh chase never really took off. Going by the first two T20Is, the Indian team management has nearly checked all the skills of the new lot of players. As India build their pool for the next T20 World Cup , their best bets seem to be shaping up well.",India beat Bangladesh by 86 runs to win the T20 series 2-0. Nitish Reddy top scored with 74 while Rinku Singh made 53. India posted 221-9 in their 20 overs. Bangladesh were bowled out for 135 in 20. overs.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114102828,imgsize-56260,width-400,resizemode-4/114102828.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India secured a series win against Bangladesh in the second T20I on Wednesday, thanks to a standout performance by all-rounder Nitish Reddy , who was playing only his second T20I match.The 21-year-old from Andhra Pradesh scored a quick 74 off 34 balls, helping India reach a challenging total of 221/9. He also contributed with the ball, taking 2 wickets for 23 runs as Bangladesh managed only 135/9.After the match, Reddy expressed his gratitude to his team.""It feels great to represent India, I feel so proud about this moment. Grateful for everything. I should give credit to the captain and coach. They gave me the licence to play fearless cricket,"" he said.Reddy's innings began slowly but picked up pace after benefitting from a no-ball error by Bangladesh's Mahmudullah , which he hit for a six off the free hit. ""I took my time initially, but after that no-ball everything went in my favor. It feels great to play for the Indian team. I want to continue in this same way. Want to keep repeating such good performances,"" he added.India faced early challenges, losing three wickets for 41 runs in the powerplay, but a partnership of 108 runs between Reddy and Rinku Singh (53) stabilized the innings. Captain Suryakumar Yadav highlighted the importance of such situations for testing the middle-order batsmen.""I wanted that situation, wanted my batters (5, 6, 7) in that situation. Happy for both (Rinku and Nitish) of them,"" Yadav commented.He also emphasized the message to the team was to perform with the freedom they are accustomed to in practice and franchise games.""They batted exactly the way I wanted. You got to go out there and express. The message has been loud and clear—do what you do in the nets, and franchises. Just the jersey changes, rest remains the same,"" Yadav added.Yadav also used the match to test the bowling lineup in different scenarios. ""I wanted to see what different bowlers can do in different situations. Can they give me the difficult overs? Sometimes Hardik won't bowl, sometimes Washington Sundar won't bowl. I wanted to see what the other guys had in store, really happy with it. It was his (Nitish's) day, I thought let him enjoy it and make it large.""",All-rounder Nitish Reddy scores 74 off 34 balls in India's second T20I win.

On Wednesday two teams boosted their chances of qualification at the Women's T20 World Cup and two others were sent packing. South Africa and India earned big net run rate (NRR) gains following their wins over Scotland and Sri Lanka respectively.As the group stage inches towards conclusion, the scenarios become clearer and at the same time, the bids to progress to the semi-finals get tougher.Australia, six-time winners and three-time defending champions, are once again favourites to win the tournament and have shown just why with a demolition of New Zealand in their second match.The Alyssa Healy-led Aussies are two from two and could effectively seal their place into the semi-finals with victory over Pakistan next. India’s crushing win over Sri Lanka has given their NRR a massive boost and lifted their semi-final qualification chances even after their disappointing opening loss to New Zealand and laboured win versus Pakistan.The huge NRR boost that Harmanpreet Kaur ’s side gained in their win vs Sri Lanka means that they may not need to beat Australia in their final group fixture, depending on the results elsewhere.But even if they do enter the contest in must-win territory, it is now highly unlikely they would need to do so with a significant margin.Pakistan’s victory on the opening day against Sri Lanka had opened up the competition for qualification, despite a disappointing setback against India in their second match.Led by Fatima Sana, the team will need to secure another win, with their upcoming clash against New Zealand likely to determine their fate.New Zealand have had a rollercoaster start, beginning strong with an impressive win over India, only to face a disappointing defeat against Australia.The 60-run loss reversed their NRR advantage, but they still maintain a chance to qualify for the knockout stage, with crucial matches against Sri Lanka and Pakistan on the horizon.Entering the tournament with momentum from recent victories against higher-ranked teams, Sri Lanka's lack of competitiveness in Group A has been frustrating for captain Chamari Athapaththu and her squad.Their third consecutive loss, to India, ended their chances of advancing, and they will finish their campaign against New Zealand on Saturday.Australia v Pakistan – Friday 11 October (18:00 local time), Dubai International Cricket StadiumNew Zealand v Sri Lanka – Saturday 12 October (14:00 local time), Sharjah Cricket StadiumIndia v Australia – Sunday 13 October (18:00 local time), Sharjah Cricket StadiumPakistan v New Zealand – Monday 14 October (18:00 local time), Dubai International Cricket StadiumWith a commanding win over Scotland, South Africa have taken a significant step toward semi-final qualification, boasting the best NRR in the group despite a loss to England. A win against Bangladesh in their final group match could secure their progress.England are firmly in control of Group B with two victories, including a crucial win over South Africa in a rematch from the previous year's semi-final.With another win likely ensuring qualification, Heather Knight’s team look strong.On paper, West Indies and South Africa are the contenders to join England in the semi-finals. Although Windies lost their opener to South Africa, their decisive victory over Scotland has given them a solid NRR boost. They’ll likely need to defeat Bangladesh for a shot at qualification, with a potentially pivotal match against England to conclude the group stage.Bangladesh celebrated a long-awaited victory against Scotland, marking their first win at an ICC Women’s T20 World Cup in a decade. They showcased their skills even in defeat to England, but their hopes for progression will rely heavily on their performances against the West Indies and South Africa in the remaining group matches.Making their maiden appearance at the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup, Scotland have shown glimpses of talent in three losses. However, with no points and only one game left, they are guaranteed to exit at the group stage, even if they manage to upset England in their final match.Bangladesh v West Indies – Thursday 10 October (18:00 local time), Sharjah Cricket StadiumBangladesh v South Africa – Saturday 12 October (18:00 local time), Dubai International Cricket StadiumEngland v Scotland – Sunday 13 October (14:00 local time), Sharjah Cricket StadiumEngland v West Indies – Tuesday 15 October (18:00 local time), Dubai International Cricket Stadium","South Africa and India earned big net run rate (NRR) gains following their wins over Scotland and Sri Lanka respectively.

NEW DELHI: India's women's cricket team created history on Wednesday by registering their biggest margin of victory ever in a Women's T20 World Cup , defeating Sri Lanka by 82 runs in Dubai.This record-breaking win surpassed their previous best margin of 79 runs, showcasing the team's dominance in the tournament.India set a challenging 173-run target for Sri Lanka, driven by standout performances from their top-order batters Smriti Mandhana (50), Shafali Verma (43) and a record-breaking unbeaten fifty by skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (52* off 27 balls).The bowlers followed it up with a clinical display, dismantling Sri Lanka's batting lineup with precision.

The bowlers capitalized on the pressure built by the batters to seal the comprehensive win.In 2018, India faced Ireland in Guyana, where they secured a 52-run victory.

NEW DELHI: Barcelona legend Andrés Iniesta officially announced his retirement from professional football on October 7, 2024, marking the end of a truly remarkable career that spanned over two decades.The 40-year-old midfielder leaves behind a legacy filled with iconic moments, both at the club and international levels, cementing his status as one of the greatest footballers of all time.From leading Barcelona to domestic and European glory to inspiring Spain’s ""golden generation"", Iniesta’s career was defined by his elegance, creativity, and unshakable composure on the field.Here are the top five moments that define his extraordinary career:Iniesta’s crowning moment came on July 11, 2010, when he scored the winning goal in the FIFA World Cup final against the Netherlands. In the 116th minute of extra time, Iniesta latched onto a pass from Cesc Fàbregas, kept his calm, and fired the ball past Dutch goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg.This goal secured Spain’s first-ever World Cup trophy, etching Iniesta’s name in football history. His iconic celebration, removing his shirt to reveal a tribute to his late friend Dani Jarque, added an emotional depth to the unforgettable moment.Barcelona’s path to the 2009 UEFA Champions League final seemed all but over in the dying moments of the semi-final against Chelsea. Trailing 1-0 on the night, and with a mountain to climb, Iniesta delivered a stunning last-minute equalizer from outside the box, sending Barcelona through on away goals.That goal, a perfect example of his big-game mentality, paved the way for Barcelona’s treble-winning season and their eventual Champions League triumph against Manchester United Iniesta’s partnership with Lionel Messi was one of the most prolific and celebrated in football history, and their chemistry was on full display in the 2015 Champions League final.Iniesta orchestrated Barcelona's attack from midfield and delivered a pinpoint assist for Ivan Rakitić’s opening goal just minutes into the game against Juventus.Barcelona went on to win 3-1, securing their fifth Champions League title and Iniesta’s fourth.Iniesta was often at his best in the most intense matches, and none come bigger than El Clásico. In November 2015, Barcelona demolished Real Madrid 4-0 at the Santiago Bernabéu, and Iniesta was the heart of it all.He scored a thunderous goal and provided a masterclass in midfield control, with even Madrid fans giving him a standing ovation. His performance that night remains one of the finest displays ever seen in football's fiercest rivalry.In May 2018, Iniesta bid an emotional farewell to Barcelona after 22 years with the club. His final appearance at Camp Nou, a 1-0 victory over Real Sociedad, was a tearful moment for both the player and the fans.As he left the pitch, the entire stadium rose to applaud the departing legend, and his teammates formed a guard of honour. The image of Iniesta sitting alone on the field after the game, soaking in the atmosphere, is etched into the memories of Barcelona fans worldwide.Lionel Messi, one of Iniesta’s closest friends and long-time teammates, paid a heartfelt tribute to the retiring legend.Messi said, “One of the team-mates with the most magic and of the one's I enjoyed playing together the most. Andres Iniesta, the ball will miss you and so will we! I wish you the best, always. You are a phenomenon.”","Andrés Iniesta announced his retirement from professional football on October 7, 2024.

Kolkata, The legendary Leander Paes on Wednesday lamented the decline of Indian tennis , describing it as part of the ""circle of life"" while emphasising the need for patience.

Between Sania, Mahesh, Bopanna and me, we have collectively won close to 40 Grand Slam titles, along with Olympic medals and several Asian Games medals. Tennis saw a great period over about 40 years.""A little bit of patience is needed; the circle of life is playing out. We will experience a slump, but we will rise again.""The circle of life is evident in everything -- business or otherwise. The greatest key to success is patience. I have no doubt that tennis will rise again to the top in India,"" he added.","Leander Paes says decline of Indian tennis is part of the ""circle of life"" Former world No. 1 says tennis will rise again to the top in India.

Sinner-Shelton rematch

SHANGHAI: Second seed Alexander Zverev scraped through to the last 16 of the Shanghai Masters on Tuesday, winning two tiebreaks against the Netherlands' Tallon Griekspoor in an ill-tempered match that ended 7-6 (8/6), 2-6, 7-6 (7/5). Novak Djokovic meanwhile powered through the third round, steamrolling Italian Flavio Cobolli 6-1, 6-2 in just over an hour.Zverev's first set against 40th-ranked Griekspoor was overshadowed by the German's prolonged, expletive-laden exchange with the umpire when he disagreed with a call.""I cannot be bothered to go to China in October, for you to screw up this... I cannot, this is not possible,"" Zverev ranted before tossing his racket across the court.The world number three claimed the first set, but proceeded to fall apart in the second, with the Dutchman breaking him in the first, third and fifth game.Zverev squandered an early lead in the third set tiebreak but an unforced error on Griekspoor's part saw him crowned winner.""Every time I play him it's the most difficult match,"" said Zverev, saying there had been ""not much difference"" between them.In contrast, Djokovic, a four-time Shanghai champion, completely dominated 30th-ranked Cobolli, breaking him in the second and sixth games of the first set.""I can't complain about anything in the game, I was able to play aggressively,"" Djokovic said.""I'm glad to be progressing through a tournament that has meant a lot to me in my career.""Fans waved Serbian flags and screamed in delight when the former world number one wrote part of his Chinese character name on a camera lens at the end of the match.Djokovic will next play Russian Roman Safiullin , who upset Frances Tiafoe in three tight sets.The end of that match also saw the American swear repeatedly at the umpire.The last 16 has finally fallen into place after days of schedule disruption due to rain.Ben Shelton dispatched Spain's Roberto Carballes Baena 6-3, 6-4 to set up a Shanghai rematch with world number one Jannik Sinner of Italy.The American knocked Sinner out of the tournament at the same stage last year.""(I have) great memories from that match last year, I probably watched the tape of that a couple times so far this year... I'm really looking forward to it, that will be fun,"" Shelton said.Sinner's chief rival Carlos Alcaraz , who beat him in the China Open final last week, will face veteran Gael Monfils.The 38-year-old Frenchman defeated his younger and higher-ranked compatriot Ugo Humbert 7-6 (9/7), 2-6, 6-1.Stefanos Tsitsipas recovered from a lapse in concentration in the second set to beat France's Alexandre Muller 6-3, 7-5.The 26-year-old will meet world number five Daniil Medvedev in the next round.""(Medvedev) likes courts like this.
