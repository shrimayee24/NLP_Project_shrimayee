Auston Matthews Got Involved In A Criminal Investigation In 2019 When A Woman Filed A Charge Against Him



Auston Matthews, the star player of the Toronto Maple Leafs, is one of the most talented and popular players in the National Hockey League. After spending a number of years with the Toronto Maple Leafs, he became the captain of the team in 2024. While his skill cant be compared to anyone else, a few years ago he found himself involved in a controversy that potentially threatened his career.Back in 2019, Auston Matthews had already shown the skill and expertise to become the captain of the team. But just when he was about to become a captain, a woman filed a charge against the star player for “disorderly conduct and disruptive behaviour”.The woman was a security guard going by the name of Fayola Dozithee. In 2019 Fayola Dozithee reported that she was sitting inside her locked car late at night in the month of May trying to complete some paperwork. At that time, she heard some noise and realised that a group of men were trying to open her locked car.This group of men also included the now captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs, Auston Matthews. This happened in Scottsdale, Arizona, outside Auston Matthews’ condo.As per CBC Sports, body cam footage of the police had revealed that the woman filed a complaint when Auston Matthews family did not take her complaint seriously. At that point due to the criminal investigation against the star player, he was not announced the captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs.Auston Matthews did get charged but the charges against him were dropped soon after. At that point, Auston Matthews did open up about his relationship with Kyle Dubas, the then general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs and said, ""I think we're in good shape. Obviously I made a mistake. I'm taking ownership of it, but everybody makes mistakes.""Auston Matthews did not let his performance get affected due to this and went on to prove his skill. In 2024, he was announced as the captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs and is one of the most skilled players on ice today.Also Read: Pittsburgh Penguins get brutally trolled by fans but it’s not for their performance on the ice or recent losses","Auston Matthews, the star player of the Toronto Maple Leafs, is one of the most talented and popular players in the National Hockey League.

Taylor Swift’s dinner conversation with Brittany Mahomes fuels baby rumors: Is motherhood on the horizon?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/taylor-swifts-dinner-conversation-with-brittany-mahomes-fuels-baby-rumors-is-motherhood-on-the-horizon/articleshow/118569640.cms,"Image via GC

Are Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce planning for a baby?

As Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce were getting ready for the Super Bowl last month, their pre-game convo allegedly was about something other than football. The night prior to the big game, the couple was dining at Lilette, an upscale French restaurant in New Orleans.They were not alone, along with them were Travis Kelce's Kansas City Chiefs team player Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany Mahomes. Although the Super Bowl was certainly on their minds, sources indicate that the night's chatter turned to more intimate issues, creating a memorable evening prior to the championship battle.Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce had dinner prior to the Super Bowl at French restaurant Lilette in New Orleans with Patrick and Brittany Mahomes. As the crowd enjoyed their supper, sources hinted that the discourse turned to one personal issue -children, particularly because the couple Mahomes welcomed their second little one.“There was lots of baby talk,” the insider revealed, mentioning that Brittany was sharing pictures while the group enthusiastically discussed parenthood. This insight comes as speculation grows about Swift’s future, especially now that her record-breaking Eras Tour has officially concluded.Taylor Swift, known for her work ethic and creative projects, may be taking a ""gap year"" to focus on her personal life, particularly her relationship with Kelce, according to close sources. “For the first time in years, Taylor has no definitive plan,” an insider shared. “She is taking a year off. That means no tours or shows. She and Travis are in it for the long haul, and they both want the same things: a forever romance and a family.”Swift is open to marriage and children, according to close friends. “Taylor's friends believe now is the perfect time in her life to marry and have children,” a source said. “They’ve expressed this to her, and she is not against it at all. Taylor has never felt love like this. It’s unconditional.”Swift and Kelce's romance began in 2023 when Swift attended Kelce's game against the Chicago Bears. Since then, the couple has made headlines with high-profile outings, including Kelce's surprise onstage appearance at Swift's London ""Eras Tour"" and Swift playfully tweaking her lyrics to acknowledge her NFL star boyfriend in the crowd.The timing is perfect, especially considering the rumors surrounding Travis Kelce's retirement. “I know everybody wants to know whether or not I’m playing next year,” he admitted, speaking to Jason, who retired from football in March 2024. “Right now, I’m just kicking everything down the road. I’m not making any crazy decisions, but right now, the biggest thing is just being there for my teammates and being there for my coaches, understanding that there’s a lot goes into this thing.”Kelce's football career is winding down, and Swift is at a natural crossroads following her record-breaking tour, suggesting the couple may be at the perfect moment to turn their love story into something bigger. “Travis and Taylor have both achieved everything they ever wanted, massive success and enough money for ten lifetimes,” one insider said. “The only thing they don’t have yet is a family of their own.”Also Read: “Such a likable guy”: Hollywood producer is all praises for Travis Kelce, reveals the Chiefs TE is destined for Hollywood success","Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce had dinner prior to the Super Bowl at French restaurant Lilette in New Orleans with Patrick and Brittany Mahomes.

Giant González – The tallest WWE superstar ever at 8ft, but it was a disaster

Read More:

WWE has always been a place where size matters. The biggest men in wrestling have used their sheer presence to dominate, intimidate, and, in some cases, struggle under their own massive frames. Some became legends. Others were just freakish anomalies. But one thing’s certain—when these giants stepped into the ring, you couldn't look away.Omos is a walking skyscraper. At 7ft 3"" and over 400 lbs, he makes even the biggest WWE stars look average. His presence alone is enough to sell a match.He debuted in 2019 and was quickly paired with AJ Styles, acting as his unstoppable enforcer. It didn’t take long for WWE to capitalize on his size. At WrestleMania 38, he faced Bobby Lashley in a match that made Lashley—one of WWE’s most jacked superstars—look small. That’s how big Omos is. Even outside the ring, his height is shocking. Pictures of him standing ringside next to AJ Styles, who was inside the ring, make Styles look like a cruiserweight.WWE clearly sees something in him. His matches may not be five-star classics, but his sheer size guarantees he’ll always have a place in the company.Before Big Show, before Omos, before any of them, Andre the Giant wasspectacle. At 7ft 4"" and over 500 lbs, he wasn’t just a wrestler—he was an event. WWE made him the centerpiece of their early days, using his size to sell out arenas worldwide.The moment that cemented his legacy came at WrestleMania III, when Hulk Hogan did the impossible and slammed him in front of 93,000 people. That body slam became one of the most iconic moments in wrestling history. But Andre was more than just a giant. He could actually wrestle. He moved better than most men half his size and had the credibility to carry WWE’s top title.Andre set the standard for what it meant to be a WWE giant. Every big man who came after him was measured against him. Some came close. None surpassed him.Giant González wasn’t just tall—he was absurdly tall. At 8ft, he is the biggest man to ever step into a WWE ring. He towered over every giant that came before or after him. But there was one major problem: he couldn’t wrestle.WWE booked him against The Undertaker at WrestleMania, hoping his insane size would be enough to create a spectacle. It wasn’t. The match was an awkward mess, and González never found his footing in WWE. He was too tall, too slow, and too stiff. Even a giant needs some level of movement, and he had none.Despite his size, he’s mostly remembered as a failed experiment. He made history as WWE’s tallest superstar, but that’s about it. His career never took off, and he disappeared from wrestling not long after.","Omos is the biggest active WWE superstar at 7ft 3"" and over 400 lbs.

LeBron James Addresses Lakers' Tribute, But Does It Reveal Davis Trade Disappointment?



It was great to see him get that recognition

It was a night of mixed emotions at Crypto.com Arena. While Luka Doncic dazzled, the spotlight also shone on a bittersweet reunion between LeBron James and Anthony Davis . The occasion? A touching tribute by the Los Angeles Lakers to AD, their former teammate, recently traded to the Dallas Mavericks in a blockbuster deal that shook the NBA landscape. James, never one to shy away from the spotlight, openly shared his feelings, leaving fans and pundits alike wondering about the subtext.Davis's five-and-a-half-year stint with the Lakers, marked by a championship in 2020 and the inaugural NBA Cup victory in 2023, came to an abrupt end when the Mavericks dangled Doncic. While the move was undoubtedly a win for Dallas, it clearly left a mark on James. The Lakers' video tribute, played during a first-quarter timeout, showcased AD’s highlights in purple and gold, drawing cheers from the LA faithful. James, visibly emotional, watched the entire tribute, acknowledging his close bond with Davis . ""One of my best friends,"" he later commented, emphasizing the personal connection beyond the court.James stated, ""I watched it from start to finish. I mean, we know what AD was for this franchise or what he did for this franchise from the moment we got him. Obviously, our friendship goes without saying one of my best friends and it was great to see him get that recognition.""The NBA even tweeted a video of James's reaction, captioned ""LeBron touches on AD's moment in LA tonight,"" further amplifying the moment's significance.But was there more to James's emotion than just nostalgia? Was James simply acknowledging a teammate's contributions, or was there a hint of disappointment, perhaps even resentment, about how things unfolded? After all, the Lakers’ front office traded away his championship-winning teammate, and it wasn’t just any teammate, but one of his closest friends in the league. "","" James said, but the phrasing itself could be interpreted in multiple ways. Was it a genuine expression of joy for his friend, or a veiled critique of the Lakers for letting him go?ALSO READ: Luka Doncic Gets Real After Triple-Double Against Dallas Mavericks: What Did the Los Angeles Lakers Star Reveal? James is a master of reading between the lines. His words are rarely accidental, and his emotions are often strategically displayed. It's possible that he was sending a message to the Lakers' management, subtly expressing his displeasure with the trade. Or perhaps he was simply acknowledging the reality of the business, celebrating Davis's past achievements while wishing him well in his new chapter. Whatever the true meaning behind his words, one thing is certain: the Lakers' tribute to Anthony Davis, and LeBron James's reaction, added another layer of intrigue to an already captivating NBA season.","Anthony Davis was traded by the Los Angeles Lakers to the Dallas Mavericks.

Theface an uphill battle as they prepare to take on the New York Knicks on Wednesday, still reeling from an eight-game losing streak. With their playoff hopes hanging by a thread, the Sixers are 2.5 games behind the Chicago Bulls for the final play-in spot in the Eastern Conference. However, their chances of turning things around will be hampered by a growing list of injuries, most notably the continued absence of star center Joel Embiid. Joel Embiid , who is managing a left knee injury, will remain sidelined for the upcoming game. The Sixers are carefully evaluating his recovery process as they plan for the 2024-25 season. Embiid’s absence has been a significant blow to the team, leaving a gaping hole in both their offense and defense. The team has yet to provide a clear timeline for his return, emphasizing a cautious approach to his rehabilitation.The injury woes don’t stop with Embiid. Kyle Lowry (right hip injury management), Eric Gordon (right wrist sprain), and Jared McCain (left knee meniscus surgery) are also ruled out for Wednesday’s game. Additionally, Guerschon Yabusele (right eye abrasion) will miss the matchup after sustaining a bad hit during the second half of Monday’s loss to the Bulls. His recovery timeline remains uncertain.On a slightly positive note, Justin Edwards (left ankle sprain) and Quentin Grimes (right knee soreness) are listed as probable, offering some hope for the Sixers’ rotation. Paul George (left finger splint) is also available, providing a much-needed boost for the team’s perimeter play.The Sixers and Knicks will tip off at 7 p.m. EST on Wednesday at Madison Square Garden. With their playoff aspirations on the line, Philadelphia will need to dig deep to overcome their injury challenges and snap their losing streak. However, without Embiid anchoring the team, the road ahead remains daunting.

From Center to Right: Mike Trout Swings into New Territory Without Missing a Beat!



""I talked to talk to a few guys, and I'll talk to Torii when he gets here because he did it,"" Trout said. ""There's a lot of guys that move to right field that I'm gonna talk to. Just see the difference and just go out there and get comfortable in spring.""

Mike Trout POSITION CHANGE?! 👀 + Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s extension deadline | SportsCenter

A Strategic Move for the Angels for Future Endeavors



“It was a combination of a bunch of things,” Trout said. “It was like a move I was doing that over time I created this bad habit. Looking at the last few years, I used to never chase and used to walk a lot. I think getting back to that and getting into that position at the plate where I can just be myself instead of just being up there defensive, I think that's the mentality.”

In a dramatic turn of events, Los Angeles Angels star Mike Trout has decided to make a move to right field , a position he last played in back 13 years ago. This unforeseen decision raised eyebrows all across Major League Baseball in what now seems to be a new phase of Trout's illustrious career as well as a strategic turning point for the Angels.Thirteen seasons in Major League Baseball, and Mike Trout has practically established himself as the game's premier center fielder. With remarkable speed, instinctive defensive skills, and the unmatched ability to patrol the outfield, he has earned a place in center field along with countless Gold Glove awards and accolades. Yet, with the Angels looking to change their line-up and fill holes, Trout is now undertaking the shift to the right field.Though it seems quite a bit unusual, the change is indeed a mark of Trout being open to change and adaptation. This change of position is, however, not solely for Trout's relocation but changing the approach by which the Angels can resource their field to the best possible success. This move will allow the team to flow some fresh ideas on lineups and defensive formations, which could ultimately be beneficial to the balance of the club.The other broader part of the Angels' contention with Trout is moving Trout to right field. This has created yet another possible opening for a young player to spark a career in center field, while also working toward quality defense throughout the infield. The anisotropic rearrangement of Trout leaves the coaching staff free to move pieces in position and still keeps the best player in the game where it counts.Truly an admirable commission for leadership, flexibility, and commitment to the long-term betterment of the Angels! It may take some time for Mike to internalize his new position, but the image of Trout leading the charge remains, literally and figuratively, twenty steps ahead for the other Angels.","Los Angeles Angels star Mike Trout has decided to make a move to right field, a position he last played in back 13 years ago.

Saquon Barkley silences doubters with historic season



Eagles GM: Saquon Barkley had best non-QB season in NFL history | Pro Football Talk | NFL on NBC

Roseman claims Barkley’s Season stands alone in NFL history



The Eagles took a gamble, and it paid off in historic fashion. When Philadelphia signed Saquon Barkley, doubts swirled about whether investing heavily in a running back was the right move. The position had been devalued in the modern NFL, and many questioned if Barkley was worth the price tag. But as the season unfolded, he didn’t just prove his value, he delivered one of the most dominant performances in league history, silencing critics and leading the Eagles to glory.When Eagles General Manager Howie Roseman made the bold move to sign Saquon Barkley 11 months ago, plenty of skeptics raised their eyebrows. In today’s NFL, where running backs have seen their value diminish, many questioned whether committing a significant portion of the team’s salary cap to a free-agent rusher was a wise decision. Critics argued that the league had shifted toward pass-heavy offenses, making high-priced running backs a risky investment.Fast forward to the present, and that skepticism has completely disappeared. Barkley didn’t just prove his worth; he delivered a season for the ages. With a jaw-dropping 2,504 rushing yards between the regular season and playoffs, he silenced every critic and established himself as one of the most dominant forces the position has ever seen. His electrifying performances and game-changing plays redefined what an elite running back can accomplish, making him an indispensable piece of the Eagles’ championship puzzle.Also Read: Steelers GM addresses Russell Wilson’s future, confirms exit meeting with George Pickens Roseman isn’t just calling Barkley’s season great, he believes it’s the best ever by a skill position player. During an appearance on PFT Live at the Scouting Combine, Roseman didn’t hold back in his praise.“The best season of a skill position player in NFL history,” Roseman declared. ""Seven rushes of 60+ yards, which is the most in NFL history by any skill position player. The next-closest running back was four, the next-closest receiver was Jerry Rice, six. The most rushing yards in a season, and he won a championship. So in my opinion, the best season for any skill position player in NFL history."" (via: Yahoo Sports)Numbers don’t lie, and Barkley’s explosive plays and consistent dominance cemented his place in history. More importantly, his presence was instrumental in the Eagles’ championship run, proving that Roseman’s gamble was worth every penny.When the dust settled, it wasn’t just Barkley’s stats that spoke volumes, it was the Lombardi Trophy in Philadelphia’s hands.","Eagles GM Howie Roseman believes Saquon Barkley's season is the best by a skill position player in NFL history.

The Neverending Dallas Mavericks and Luka Doncic Drama - Latest Reports Suggest New Reasons Behind the Trade That Shook the NBA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/the-neverending-dallas-mavericks-and-luka-doncic-drama-latest-reports-suggest-new-reasons-behind-the-trade-that-shook-the-nba/articleshow/118586867.cms,"Los Angeles Lakers guard Luka Doncic laughs as he takes the court against the Denver Nuggets in the first half of an NBA basketball game Saturday, Feb. 22, 2025, in Denver. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)

New reports blame Luka Doncic's lifestyle behind his sudden departure from the Dallas Mavericks

“The people who witnessed Dončić’s last days in Dallas do not paint a flattering portrait of the 25-year-old’s professionalism. They call him lazy. They talk about the weight issues that were such a frequent frustration within their walls. They mention the social habits that The Athletic has reported on — such as a taste for beer and hookah — which have been a point of concern for NBA types since he was a 19-year-old star for Real Madrid who was entering the NBA Draft.""

""They predict his basketball demise, highlighting a health history that, as some see it, will likely lead to catastrophe in the next five years or so.”

The world of the NBA came to a standstill the day Luka Doncic got traded by the Dallas Mavericks to the Los Angeles Lakers . A couple weeks into this, things are finally starting to settle down. The two teams even came face to face against each other for the first time since the trade, at the Crypto.com Arena recently, where the Lakers took the win against their opponents. But now new reports have resurfaced, gnawing at old wounds once again - Why did the Mavs decide to trade Doncic off so suddenly?The Dallas Mavericks shocked everyone when they announced that Luka Doncic , their star player, had been traded to the Lakers for Anthony David. The worst part was no one even knew this trade was taking place, not even Doncic himself. So when the deal was struck, and the news became public, he was just as surprised as the rest of the world. But back then, no one disclosed why the cornerstone player of a team would be shaken off so abruptly, that too without any prior notice.There were rumors about what could be the case. And now, a recent report by The Athletic has pointed out something similar, revealing what could have led to this trade.It is indeed not a flattering picture for a player like Doncic, who has repeatedly spoken of how shocking it was for him to learn about the trade, as he considered Dallas to be his home. The article further added an even more grim scenario, writing:Catastrophe or not, the slowly emerging reasons behind offloading a star player like Luka Doncic do pose a concern for the Lakers, who are investing as well as reinventing themselves, keeping Doncic in the front and center. While LeBron James is still the man of the team, his days on the court are numbered, having already hit 40.

Theare gearing up for a crucial matchup against the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday, February 26, at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, but all eyes are on star guard’s injury status.

If he’s sidelined, the burden will fall on Pascal Siakam, who leads the team with 21.8 points and 7.3 rebounds per game. However, Indiana’s defense, which allows 115.6 points per game (20th in the league), will need to step up to compensate for any offensive shortcomings.As the clock ticks down to tip-off, Pacers fans are holding their breath.

Cody Bellinger opens up about dealing with loneliness

""It’s very lonely. You feel like you’re the only one going through it, and in reality, everyone at some point goes through adversity in some sort of way, and mine came right when I got hurt and I was dealing with injuries. That was when I had to deal with adversity a lot, so coming out on top of that, it’s a great feeling, there’s nothing better.""

""I have a bunch of great people in my circle, my family, my wife, my friends who all support me. A lot of it was mental. … I mean, a lot of it was physical at one point as well because my body was just moving differently.""

""It’s a process to get it back. It’s a hard game when you’re 100 percent healthy, it’s full of failure, so when you’re banged up, it kind of stacks on. After a few years figuring out what made me good and just keep fighting like hell to get back to where I am,""

What's next for Aaron Jones? The Vikings have indicated that they will reduce the running back's playing time if he returns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/whats-next-for-aaron-jones-the-vikings-have-indicated-that-they-will-reduce-the-running-backs-playing-time-if-he-returns/articleshow/118506808.cms,"Image via Imagn Images

Vikings plan to reduce Aaron Jones’ playing time if he returns

The Minnesota Vikings are considering limiting the heavy use of veteran Aaron Jones , who set career highs in touches, carries, and offensive snaps in his first season. Despite injuries, Jones managed to play all 18 games and had the most rushing yards and second-most yards from scrimmage in his career. As he approaches free agency at 30, the Vikings plan to reduce his playing time if he returns.Aaron Jones signed a one-year contract with the Minnesota Vikings on March 12, 2024. In Week 12, he had 22 carries for 106 yards and a touchdown against the Chicago Bears. In 2024, he had 255 carries, 1,138 rushing yards, five rushing touchdowns, and 51 receptions for 408 yards and two touchdowns.""The big thing for me is we loved having Aaron Jones, the impact he had,"" coach Kevin O'Connell told SiriusXM earlier this month. ""For the better part of his career, he had kind of been a part of backfield committees, but for the most part, Aaron Jones was the feature back [in 2024]. ... So I would love to have Aaron back. And then we just continue to grow in that room, whether it's infusing a young player in the draft or maybe another player in free agency alongside Aaron Jones, hopefully.""O'Connell's vision for the 2024 season was evident in a Week 1 victory over the New York Giants, where quarterback Ryan Jones played 52% of snaps and carried the ball 14 times for 94 yards and a touchdown. However, the Vikings lost faith in Chandler and Jones became more of an every-down player, playing 63% of offensive snaps and taking 67% of carries by running backs.Aaron Jones expressed his desire to return to Minnesota in 2025, following the Vikings' wild-card loss to the Los Angeles Rams. ""We'll see how it plays out,"" he added, ""but this is where I want to be."" Jones, despite being best suited for rotational roles, is a top option in a presumptive free agent class alongside Najee Harris, J.K. Dobbins, Rico Dowdle, Javonte Williams, and Akers. His $7 million contract ranked 14th among running backs in average per year, and he could attract multiple suitors.Also read: Former New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers has shared two key qualities he is seeking in his next team ESPN's Field Yates ranks Boise State's Ashton Jeanty, Iowa's Kaleb Johnson, North Carolina's Omarion Hampton, Ohio State's TreVeyon Henderson, and Georgia's Trevor Etienne as the top five available running backs in the draft, with the Vikings having the lowest total draft capital in the NFL.","Vikings plan to reduce Aaron Jones’ playing time if he returns to Minnesota.

Matthew Tkachuk fires up fans with late-night spotlight



Matthew Tkachuk on Representing Team USA in 4 Nations Face-Off, His Stanley Cup Win and the Olympics

Tkachuk Brothers dominate as Four Nations face off breaks records



Matthew Tkachuk has never been one to shy away from the spotlight, and even an injury hasn’t kept him out of the headlines. The Florida Panthers star recently turned heads with an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, sparking both praise and criticism. While some fans appreciated his efforts to bring hockey into mainstream entertainment, others questioned his priorities. But NHL analyst Eric Engels had a clear message for the skeptics, Tkachuk is exactly what the sport needs right now.Love him or hate him, Matthew Tkachuk is always in the spotlight. The Florida Panthers star recently made waves with an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon despite being sidelined with an injury. While many fans were eager to hear from the NHL superstar, others wasted no time criticizing him. But if you ask Sportsnet’s Eric Engels, those critics need to “shut up.”The NHL analyst didn’t hold back, calling out the backlash against Tkachuk. “Perhaps the worst takes on this website full of awful takes are from the people going after Matthew Tkachuk for doing the @FallonTonight. This kid and his brother are doing wonders for elevating hockey right now—a sport that has desperately needed this buzz for decades,” Engels fired back. (via: EssentiallySports)So, what’s the controversy all about? Tkachuk, still recovering from a lower-body injury sustained during the 4 Nations Face-Off , has yet to return to NHL action. But his late-night TV appearance had some fans questioning why he was out promoting the sport instead of focusing on his recovery. Addressing the injury on The Tonight Show, he simply said, “Yeah, I’m feeling better. Just recovering right now.” However, skeptics believe his absence from the ice is a calculated move to ensure he’s at full strength for the playoffs.For Tkachuk, though, his priorities remain clear. Reflecting on his international competition, he said,“Last two weeks I was representing my country. Was something that I’ll never forget,” carefully steering away from the injury talk. He also expressed his excitement for the 2026 Winter Olympics, where he hopes to help Team USA end its gold medal drought.But beyond the buzz of Tkachuk’s late-night appearance, what exactly did Engels mean when he praised Matthew and his brother Brady for transforming the game of hockey?The 4 Nations Face-Off exceeded all expectations, delivering a spectacle that no one saw coming. While political tensions between the USA and Canada fueled the intensity, it was the Tkachuk brothers, Matthew and Brady, who stole the show. Their explosive showdown against Canada in the round-robin clash was more than just a game. It was a must-watch event that captivated an average of 10 million viewers across North America, surpassing the viewership of any non-Stanley Cup Final game since 2014.But the real frenzy erupted when the Bash Brothers took center stage, bringing relentless aggression and fueling a media storm. By the time the highly anticipated finals arrived, the hype had reached its peak, drawing in an astonishing 16 million viewers. That number made it the second most-watched hockey game in the past decade, trailing only Game 7 of the 2024 Stanley Cup Finals, which reached 16.3 million viewers. And the common link between both? Matthew Tkachuk. No surprises there.This proves Engels was right. The energy, the spectacle, and the sheer passion the Tkachuk brothers ignited among American fans were undeniable. As for Matthew Tkachuk’s injury and his return, questions still linger. Only time will tell what comes next.","Matthew Tkachuk recently made an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon despite being sidelined with an injury.

“I need to get back to game” : Max Scherzer shines in Spring Training debut with Blue Jays,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/i-need-to-get-back-to-game-max-scherzer-shines-in-spring-training-debut-with-blue-jays/articleshow/118583601.cms,"Image via: Julio Aguilar / Getty Images Sport / Getty

Max Scherzer had been dampening the excitement until finally made his debut for the Toronto Blue Jays . Tuesday saw Max Scherzer making quite a stir with his teammates and fans on the strength of a brilliant performance in a 3-2 triumph over the St. Louis Cardinals. As he starts his 18th season in Major League Baseball , this future Hall of Famer seemed to pace himself through the early spring motions, but today pitchers showed the greatness of performance that underlines his elite serving even when he turns 40.Four strikeouts would be Scherzer's total through an inning and two-thirds. A first-inning triple that allowed a run to score was brushed aside without missing a beat, however, while maintaining trademark precision during the outing, finishing strong with a strikeout pitch that topped 94.2 mph in a call to Lars Nootbaar.""I’m just trying to get sped up to game speed,"" Scherzer said after the game. ""You can throw as many bullpens as you want in the world, but that’s not real. You need to get out there and face hitters. There’s a game speed. I need to get back to game speed with mechanics, how everything works, where you want to deliver the ball and where you want to get the ball to — at actual game speed. That’s the ramp-up process of Spring Training .""Although this was Scherzer's first step with the Blue Jays in spring training, it was an early glimpse of what those in Toronto hope to see from him this season. The Blue Jays are looking for some reliable, healthy innings - they aren't looking for the Cy Young-winning form of Scherzer. Because, if Scherzer is healthy, it would add experienced, veteran leadership on the mound to a Blue Jays team with extremely high aspirations.""I’m not riding this roller coaster,"" Scherzer said, smiling. ""I’m not saying this is good, bad, this or that. No. This is about coming out, checking a box, executing, being healthy, and getting out of here.""Scherzer's health and his ability to keep hitters quiet will be extremely critical for the Blue Jays especially after the season he had where his fastball velocity has somewhat dissipated. However, his electric slider and consistent control shown during his debut will bring hopes for improvement as Spring Training progresses. Scherzer, having the right mindset, could be a main cog in the Blue Jays' rotation this season.It proved that even though there are natural losses in velocity over the course of years, Scherzer is still dangerous because he adapts to throw more accurately. He, then, is expected to not merely provide experience and leadership for a young, talented roster but to stretch healthy innings across their season.Critical in Scherzer's preparation is fine-tuning his mechanics and returning to game speed as he continues through Spring Training. For the Blue Jays, who have aspirations to go to postseason play, the difference between having a good season and a great season might lie in having Scherzer full go at all times.","Max Scherzer made his debut for the Toronto Blue Jays in a 3-2 win over the St. Louis Cardinals.

Bruce Boudreau has identified the Kings as the trade destination for Brad Marchand

Boston Bruins captain Brad Marchand, a lifelong Bruin, has expressed his desire to stay with the organization. Despite rising through the ranks, Marchand has expressed his loyalty to the Bruins, stating that the idea of playing for another contender doesn't interest him. However, it's time for the Bruins to move on from their captain.

With the Bruins currently in a playoff spot, rumors suggest Marchand could be dealt before the trade deadline. Boudreau believes Marchand, in his final year of his $49 million contract, would fit well on a line with Anze Kopitar, similar to Kopitar's long-time center Patrice Bergeron in Boston.""Well, he's a winner. I mean, I could see him going to LA and playing on a line with Kopitar and thinking a little bit of Bergeron stuff there and then, like, LA is going to be looking for a guy that can score,” Boudreau said via 'NHL Tonight'.“Brad's not a 50 goal scorer, but he's a 30 goal scorer. And I mean, he would fit in really well there. ...I got to tell you, I think any contending team would want Brad Marchand,"" he added.The Bruins, who invested millions in their roster to give their stars another Stanley Cup run, have failed to differentiate themselves in a packed Eastern Conference, appearing as a middle-of-the-road squad destined for a first-round exit if they make the postseason.Marchand may not be interested in joining another team, but the Bruins should consider reacquiring assets for their captain. They have a chance to claim a final Wild Card spot if they improve their play in the final 24 games, but this is unlikely given their initial 58 points.Also Read: Alex Ovechkin reaches 30-Goal milestone for a record-extending 19th time in his 20-year NHL career The Boston Bruins are facing a difficult situation with aging winger Marchand in the final year of his contract.

NFL legend turned NCAA coach Deion Sanders , best known as Coach Prime or Prime Time, played in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 years. He also played nine seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). But looks like the NFL and MLB are not the only arenas he is interested in, as recently, he expressed his prowess in fishing as well. He got into a heated discussion with NBA legend Chris Webber , famous for being part of the Fab Five, about who is better at fishing. Let's find out!Coach Prime has won two Super Bowl titles and made one World Series appearance, making him the only athlete to play in a Super Bowl as well as the World Series. After his playing career, Sanders became a coach, turning his attention towards college football. But all that does not mean he is ever leaving his fishing days behind.In his podcast, ""We Got Time Today,"" a recent episode saw Fab Five member Chris Webber making an appearance. And apparently, things got a little heated between the two, all because they could not decide on who was better at fishing among them. Webber took to his socials to share a video of Coach Prime talking smack about Webber and his fishing, all in good fun, writing at the end:Fishing might help him clear his mind, but looks like if someone poses a challenge to his fishing caliber, all bets are off.In the video posted by Webber in collaboration with Prime Time, which seems to have been recorded by Webber's wife, the latter is in full roast mode. He can be heard saying:Coach Prime enjoys his fishing as much as the next person. But do not come to him and say you're better at it than him; he has a problem with it.

Jack Della Maddalena vs. Belal Muhammad: The Fight for a New Welterweight King?



The world of MMA is up for yet another treat asgears up for the biggest fight of his career againstfor the UFC welterweight championship at UFC 315 on May 10 at the Bell Centre in Montreal. With an impressive seven-fight UFC win streak, the Australian contender believes he has the skills to end Muhammad’s 12-fight winning streak and claim the belt.“I think I’m going to steamroll him,” Della Maddalena said in a recent interview. “I can get the finish. That would be the icing on the cake—start my championship reign with a stoppage.”Della Maddalena was initially booked to face former champion Leon Edwards in March, which didn’t materialize owing to certain other circumstances. At the same time, Muhammad was also booked to defend his belt against Shavkat Rakhmonov, but Rakhmonov had to pull out owing to an injury. This unexpected turn of events gave Della Maddalena an earlier-than-expected opportunity to fight for the title.While the switch in opponents may seem drastic, the 27-year-old fighter remains unfazed. While he acknowledges the difference in fighting approach between Edwards and Muhammad, however, he claims to be well prepared for the champion’s pressure-heavy grappling approach.“I think Leon is a good striker who’s happy to sit on his back foot, while Belal comes forward and focuses on grappling,” Della Maddalena said. “It’s a big change, but I’ve fought guys like that my whole career, so it doesn’t matter to me.”Indifferent to Della Maddalena’s confidence, Muhammad still remains one of the most durable and battle-tested welterweights in UFC history. He hasn’t lost in nearly six years and his career highlight is a 12-fight unbeaten streak. More impressively, Muhammad hasn’t been finished in nearly a decade. This stands as a testament to his resilience and elite skill set.Despite this, Della Maddalena believes he offers a unique challenge combined with his crisp boxing, sharp finishing ability, and calm demeanour inside the Octagon. He is eager to face Muhammad’s toughness and break his legendary streak.“I have 10 weeks to sharpen all my tools,” he said. “I’m looking forward to this.”Also Read : Rafael Fiziev steps in to replace injured Dan Hooker against Justin Gaethje, Set for a High-Stakes Rematch at the UFC 313 As UFC 315 draws closer, fight fans are eagerly anticipating whether Muhammad will continue his reign or if Della Maddalena will make good on his bold prediction and come out of the ring as the new welterweight king.",Jack Della Maddalena faces Belal Muhammad for the UFC welterweight championship at UFC 315 on May 10 in Montreal.

ICC Champions Trophy 2025: India rest & reset ahead of New Zealand clash

Champions Trophy: Morne Morkel back as Team India practices at ICC Academy in Dubai

Afghanistan have sent jitters into the Australian and South African camps in the Champions Trophy by putting England out of the tournament and announcing themselves as contenders for the two semifinal spots in Group B .The virtual knockout game in Lahore on Wednesday turned out to be a humdinger, producing 642 runs in total; but it was England who saw their campaign crashing with an eight-run defeat while chasing Afghanistan's 325 for 7.'Man of the Match' Ibrahim Zadran laid the foundation of Afghanistan's win by scoring more than half of the runs in his team's final total. The opener's 177 off 146 balls deflated England's bowling.Joe Root then stood between Afghanistan and victory with his sublime and equally adventurous at times 120 off 111 balls, but Azmatullah Omarzai removed that threat and ended up with a five-wicket haul (5 for 58) to lead the bowling attack.It was England's sixth consecutive defeat in ODIs.Afghanistan's win has put Group B leaders South Africa and Australia on notice by clinching the two points and being just a point adrift of the top two teams.The Afghans are now in a position to upset the Australian party when they meet the ODI world champions on February 28 at the same venue, the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore.England, meanwhile, would want to leave the Champions Trophy with a consolation win over South Africa, which can put them out of the tournament as well.If Afghanistan beat Australia and South Africa lose to England, then the net run-rate will decide whether the Aussies or the Proteas join Afghanistan as the two semifinalists from Group B.If either of Australia or South Africa were to take the flight back home before the semis, they would curse the Rawalpindi weather that washed out their face-off.Group A, on the other hand, has already given the tournament its two semifinalists in the form of India and New Zealand, while hosts Pakistan and Bangladesh have bowed out and will meet in an inconsequential match on Thursday to round off their campaigns.",Afghanistan beat England by eight runs in Champions Trophy.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.
