What happened on the field and why Tampa Bay made the call

Antonio Brown ’s reaction and the wider fallout



What this means for Shilo and the Sanders legacy

Antonio Brown’s social-media swipe at the Sanders family arrived hours after the Tampa Bay Buccaneers moved on from rookie safety Shilo Sanders, escalating an already tense offseason storyline that blends on-field discipline, family legacy and off-field baggage.Shilo Sanders was ejected late in Tampa Bay’s preseason finale following a punch thrown at tight end Zach Davidson — an act Buccaneers coach Todd Bowles publicly condemned. “You can’t throw punches in this league, that’s inexcusable,” Bowles said.“They're going to get you every time. You've got to grow from that.” Sanders had earlier drawn a pass-interference penalty in the same game, and with NFL rosters headed toward the 53-man deadline, the Bucs chose to cut ties rather than carry a disciplinary risk at a position where reliability matters.On X, Brown wrote bluntly: “Whole Sanders fam gonna end up getting cut out the league…” — a short, incendiary message that reopens questions about Deion Sanders’ sons and their NFL readiness.Brown has previously circulated footage and commentary that suggested the younger Sanders received advantages due to their father’s prominence, and his latest post doubles down on that narrative. Deion Sanders did not answer in kind; instead he publicly wished Brown well, choosing de-escalation over a media feud.Shilo’s path to pro stability was never straightforward: undrafted in April, he arrived with a solid college résumé (Jackson State, Colorado), a recent broken forearm and off-field financial complications, including a large civil judgment that has lingered in public filings.Cutting him now shifts the immediate question to other teams or practice squads willing to bet on his athletic upside despite maturity concerns. For Deion’s broader legacy, repeated public incidents involving his sons risk overshadowing his coaching renaissance — and fuel critics who claim influence alone won’t protect players from the league’s accountability standards.Also Read: Shedeur Sanders finally explains his reaction after being subbed out late against Rams in preseason finale Teams value talent — but in today’s NFL, availability and discipline are equally precious.

Clare initially turned down Tommy Fleetwood before love story started

Clare Fleetwood ’s support during heartbreaking near-misses

Tommy Fleetwood is one of the top-paid golfers in the world as of August 2025. On the PGA Tour itself, he has won more than $31 million in prize money. This statistic makes him one of the biggest-money winners in the history of the DP World Tour, with a career earnings total of around $35 million.Other sources of income have also bolstered Fleetwood, but still has yet to nab a win on the PGA Tour. In addition, he has taken home sponsorship deals with Nike, TaylorMade, and TAG Heuer, benefitting from a significant amount of millions as a result of golf's former Player Impact Program.Fleetwood met his wife, Clare, in 2015, which further blended his personal and professional lives. Clare was then a sports management executive when she became Tommy's client. Their work was the beginning of what would soon become a deeper relationship, despite their 23-year age difference.Clare explained how she initially turned down Tommy when he first asked her out because the age gap made her feel cautious. But after further thought, she succumbed, and the couple entered a relationship that shocked the golf world.The pair had concerns about whether mixing business with romance would work, but agreed to give it six months to see how it went.So when they did, they were surprised to find that the two arrangements reinforced each other, professionally and personally. Clare, who maintains a cool and calm approach, has regularly been acknowledged as a reason Tommy stays composed and relaxed in stressful situations on the course.Apart from materialistic dividends, there have been some massive emotional ups and downs in Fleetwood’s professional career. Clare has remained his rock through his lowest lows, which include several painful near misses on the PGA Tour.None was more heartbreaking than the one he endured at the Travelers Championship as Tommy once again finished in second place, this time the victim of a late charge by Keegan Bradley to come up one stroke short of the winner. Enticing words like these have shaped his career narrative to date, so near, but not close enough to cement that first PGA Tour title.Going into the last 18 holes of the Tour Championship, Fleetwood was quoted as a favourite, and Clare was back to have his back as always. Friends of the couple say Clare has been a great support to Tommy in dealing with the pressure, and his two losses have only made him more determined.Also Read: Who is golfer Tommy Fleetwood’s wife Clare?

Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and the godchildren who inspired Taylor Swift’s songs

Pop icon Taylor Swift may dominate the music charts and headlines for her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce , but there’s another side to her that doesn’t often make the spotlight: her role as a godmother. Beyond the stadium appearances and sold-out tours, Swift plays a personal role in the lives of several celebrity children, showcasing the depth of her friendships and her influence beyond music.Swift’s first widely known godchild is Leo Thames King, son of actress Jaime King. Born in 2015, Leo quickly became a part of Swift’s inner circle, with the singer even penning emotional words inspired by the moment.When she first met him, Swift posted a touching photo with the caption, “Meeting my boy.” Jaime King, once a core member of Swift’s famous “squad,” has often spoken highly of her friend, calling her a “beautiful human being.” For King, naming Swift as godmother was “a really sacred thing,” signaling not just a celebrity connection but a genuine trust in the singer’s character.The most notable godparent role Swift holds is with the children of Hollywood power couple Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds. She is godmother to James, Inez, Betty, and Olin — a fact Swift humorously acknowledged while promoting Deadpool & Wolverine, writing, “Shout out to Wade Wilson, aka my godkids’ sperm donor.”Ryan Reynolds later clarified, “Swift is the godparent to my daughters.”Interestingly, the names James, Inez, and Betty are immortalized in Swift’s Folklore album, making her godmother role not just private but also creatively celebrated.Also Read: “She doesn’t include Blake”: Taylor Swift leans on Travis Kelce’s support and no longer values Blake Lively’s advice With five godchildren, Swift’s personal influence in Hollywood runs as deep as her professional success.

Shedeur Sanders and the ‘disaster’ label from Skip Bayless



Why Shedeur Sanders may need to leave Cleveland



The Cleveland Browns’ final preseason game against the Los Angeles Rams told a story few expected. For young quarterback Shedeur Sanders, who once flashed undeniable promise, the night unraveled into one of frustration and missed chances. Just weeks ago, he had impressed with sharp throws and composure against the Carolina Panthers. But this time, the rookie looked like a shadow of that quarterback—hesitant, disconnected, and left searching for answers.Sanders’ stat line against the Rams was forgettable: three completions on six attempts, totaling only 16 yards. For a player drafted in the fifth round after a dramatic slide, the performance raised immediate concerns. Skip Bayless didn’t sugarcoat it, branding the outing as a complete “disaster.” Yet, the analyst struck a careful balance—criticizing the moment while praising Sanders’ potential.“This young man can play quarterback at the highest level in this league,” Bayless said. “He is capable of being a franchise quarterback and taking a team to the promised land. But he's got the whole package. He's got enough size; he's not huge, but his arm is Brady-esque.It's at least as strong as Brady's. He can run... But the main things he has are poise and command, and leadership.”Bayless’ conviction underlines what scouts and fans noticed before the draft—Sanders isn’t short on talent. What he lacks, however, is the right environment to refine his game. Against Los Angeles, that truth became hard to ignore.The Browns took a gamble by selecting Sanders 144th overall, but their handling of him suggests hesitation more than investment. Instead of building on his momentum, Cleveland appears ready to relegate him to the practice squad. Making matters worse, Tyler Huntley showcased more polish in closing out the Rams game, further pushing Sanders down the depth chart.Bayless sees no upside in keeping the young quarterback trapped in Cleveland’s crowded roster.""Shedeur has to go elsewhere. The only way to get free of this situation is to free Shedeur from Cleveland. Free him. It's either for them to cut him, or them to practice squad him and some other team, somebody out there. They go sign him off of the practice squad.""That possibility looms large. Around the league, quarterback-needy teams continue to search for players with raw tools and long-term upside. Sanders, with his composure and leadership, fits that mold. If Cleveland fails to recognize it, another franchise just might.Although his final preseason outing didn’t unfold as he had hoped, Sanders still conveyed his gratitude in a Sunday Instagram post.""Thanks everyone for the [love] and support,"" Sanders wrote. ""There's a lot to learn from this preseason, but I'm really thankful for the opportunity to be out there. Day by day, rep by rep, I'll keep learning and getting better.""For now, Sanders’ NFL journey hangs in the balance. One poor performance does not define a career, but staying in the wrong situation can. His next move could determine whether he fades into obscurity—or rises to fulfill the promise so many still see in him.Also Read: Antonio Brown reignites feud with Deion Sanders, claims Shilo’s cut proves his sons can’t survive in NFL","Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders struggled in final preseason game.

Why Aaron Rodgers is a big-name addition, but not the single solution the Steelers need

What’s More Likely: Rich Eisen Talks Rams, Browns, Steelers, Vikings, Seahawks, Bucs, Falcons & More

Skylar Thompson ’s preseason spark and the message from Mike Tomlin



The arrival of Aaron Rodgers to Pittsburgh grabbed headlines, but the Steelers ’ culture of consistency suggests the team won’t hinge its season on one superstar. With 21 consecutive non-losing seasons and a roster built for physicality and depth, Pittsburgh still looks like a complete roster-first franchise rather than a one-man show.Aaron Rodgers brings experience, name recognition and the potential to lift passer play in key moments, yet the Steelers’ success has long been the product of complementary pieces. From veterans like DK Metcalf, Jonnu Smith and Jalen Ramsey to younger contributors such as Derrick Harmon and Jack Sawyer, Pittsburgh’s roster construction emphasizes balance.Last season’s 10–7 finish and a clutch record in one-possession games underscore a team mentality focused on situational toughness rather than star-dependent fireworks. As Rich Eisen put it on The Rich Eisen Show: “You know, I think it’s just the roster as a whole.”And while Eisen later added his vote for Rodgers — “Oh, I’ll go Aaron Rodgers. Come on now. What a disrespectful question that is.” — that doesn’t erase the reality that winning in Pittsburgh has historically been multi-dimensional.Preseason performances have shifted attention to the depth behind Rodgers. Skylar Thompson’s 11-of-13 passing, 152 yards and a touchdown in the preseason win over Carolina didn’t just look tidy — it raised questions about opportunity.Mike Tomlin didn’t downplay that impact: “He’s got playing experience. This guy started games in Miami. I think that experience shows — and we’re talking regular-season games.” That endorsement signals Pittsburgh’s willingness to trust proven depth rather than lean solely on a single veteran.Also Read: Shedeur Sanders finally explains his reaction after being subbed out late against Rams in preseason finale Realistically, the Steelers’ fortunes will be decided by coaching, health and the supporting cast as much as Rodgers’ arm. With an over/under win total around 8.5 and a tough schedule ahead, Pittsburgh’s identity — gritty, deep, and team-first — remains the most reliable predictor of whether this season ends with another playoff push.","Aaron Rodgers brings experience, name recognition and the potential to lift passer play in key moments.

Tommy Fleetwood finally delivers after years of heartbreak



Tommy Fleetwood’s long pursuit of a PGA Tour victory finally ended in Atlanta, and the sports world took notice. The 34-year-old English golfer captured his first Tour title at East Lake Golf Club, winning the Tour Championship and FedEx Cup on Sunday with a three-stroke cushion over Patrick Cantlay and Russell Henley. For a player who had endured 163 winless starts, countless near misses, and 30 top-five finishes, this breakthrough was both historic and emotional.

Sports rock,” once the win was sealed.NBA icon LeBron James also applauds Fleetwood’s perseverance and the significance of that first victory. “Congrats and 🫡 @TommyFleetwood1!!! That first one feeling is something else! Especially after dealing with adversity and shortcomings. Too 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🏆,” James wrote.Fleetwood has been one of golf’s most likable and hardworking players.His win was historic and very crucial for his career.Fleetwood closed with a 2-under 68 on Sunday to finish at 18 under overall, lifting the FedEx Cup trophy along with a $10 million winner’s prize, the richest handed out on the PGA Tour this season. The achievement erased one of the sport’s longest-standing storylines as the most consistent player never to win on Tour.“I think I’m proud of what I’ve done before,” Fleetwood said after his victory. “Whether I’ve won or not, I’ve still been proud of my career so far, knowing that I still have a long way to go and lots of learning. This doesn’t change that, really. This is hopefully just one win, the first of many to come. You cannot win plenty if you don’t win the first one.”Fleetwood had been runner-up six times and logged 44 top-10 finishes without a win, numbers that underscored both his skill and his frustration.Also Read: LeBron James honors late NBA legend Kobe Bryant on his 47th birthday with a heartfelt tribute and memories Additionally, Tiger Woods, Justin Rose, and European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald were among those who praised his victory.","Tommy Fleetwood won the Tour Championship and FedEx Cup on Sunday.

Pedro Da Silva Conceição’s knockout stunned Jake Paul and the crowd



MVP spotlight shifts toward Gervonta Davis vs Jake Paul



Fight nights hosted by Jake Paul usually promise spectacle, but this one went above and beyond. At MVP Prospects 14 in Orlando, Florida, the YouTuber-turned-boxer watched in shock as an undercard bout produced one of the most violent knockouts of the year. Brazilian prospect Pedro Da Silva Conceição floored Cuba’s Renny Viamonte Mastrapa with a single thunderous right hand that left the crowd gasping and Paul visibly stunned at ringside.In round two, when Pedro Da Silva Conceição unleashed a perfectly timed overhand right, sending Viamonte face-first to the canvas, where he remained motionless for several tense minutes as medics rushed in. Fans erupted, commentators lost their composure, and the cameras quickly cut to Paul, who leapt to his feet with his mouth wide open.Paul later posted the clip to his social media with the caption: “KO of the year?” Also, Paul’s promotional company, Most Valuable Promotions, declared the finish the most devastating knockout fans have seen this season.The brutal stoppage not only silenced the venue but also highlighted Conceição as one to watch. The 24-year-old Brazilian, now 5-0 as a professional, delivered the kind of finish that elevates a fighter’s career overnight.“I trained my whole life for this moment. I didn’t see my family for two years. I worked very hard for this,” Conceição said after the fight. “I feel amazing, it's a gift for me.”The weekend card stretched over two nights, with Saturday featuring Paul’s protégé Lucas Bahdi outpointing Roger Gutierrez in a WBA lightweight final eliminator. That win positions Bahdi for a future shot at the WBA’s 135-pound title, a belt currently tied to Paul’s next opponent, Gervonta Davis.Davis, however, faces complications with the sanctioning body after opting to fight Paul in an exhibition on November 14 instead of rematching Lamont Roach, as ordered. The weight disparity between the fighters is massive. Paul is a natural cruiserweight who last tipped the scales at 227 pounds in his heavyweight clash with Mike Tyson, while Davis has never fought above super lightweight and usually walks around at 150 pounds.Also Read: FIG apologizes for scoring mistake as Darja Varfolomeev wins gold at World Championships in Rio The unusual matchup is unlikely to be sanctioned as a professional contest, but the intrigue around it continues to grow. Paul has suggested he will cut to 195 pounds for the bout, leaving Davis to bulk up as close as possible. In the meantime, MVP Prospects 14 showed how much chaos and excitement Paul’s cards can generate, and how an unexpected knockout can overshadow even the biggest main-event storylines.","Pedro Da Silva Conceição’s knockout stunned Jake Paul and the crowd at MVP Prospects 14.

Shilo Sanders faces the weight of Deion’s legacy

Todd Bowles slams rookie’s ejection, demands discipline

Prime time’s shadow sparks scrutiny on Shilo’s NFL future

Rookie redemption: Can Shilo Sanders rewrite his Buccaneers destiny?

In what should have been a defining moment for rookie safety Shilo Sanders, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ preseason finale turned into a viral controversy. The undrafted free agent, son of NFL legend Deion Sanders, was ejected after throwing a punch at Buffalo Bills tight end Zach Davidson, placing both his roster hopes and family legacy under intense scrutiny. As final cuts loom, the incident has put Shilo—and the Sanders name—squarely in the national spotlight.The clash erupted when Davidson held onto Sanders during a play, triggering a frustrated reaction from the rookie. Sanders swung at Davidson’s helmet, prompting officials to immediately eject him. What was meant to be a showcase of his abilities became the headline, sparking widespread debate over his temperament and readiness for the NFL.Carrying the Sanders surname brings both attention and expectation. Deion Sanders, nicknamed “Prime Time,” is a Hall of Famer whose charisma and dominance made him an NFL icon. Shilo’s actions have now intensified scrutiny, with fans questioning whether the pressure of a legendary father magnifies every misstep. One X user commented, “Deion has set a bar so high, it’s crushing his kids before they even get a chance.” In this case, Shilo’s ejection became a symbolic moment of legacy versus individuality.Buccaneers head coach Todd Bowles publicly condemned the swing, labeling it “inexcusable” and stressing the importance of discipline. As a player fighting for a roster spot, Sanders’ conduct not only jeopardized his position but also sent ripples through a team evaluating talent and composure. Analysts noted that while Shilo has shown flashes of promise, consistency—and now restraint—will be key if he hopes to remain with the Buccaneers.Beyond the incident itself, the story reflects the challenges of living in Deion’s shadow. Shilo’s brother, Shedeur, is also under public scrutiny, and both sons face heightened expectations due to their father’s fame. While Deion has supported his children’s careers, the punch incident illustrates how quickly attention can pivot from talent to controversy. Fans and critics alike are debating whether Shilo’s on-field potential can ever escape the gravitational pull of his father’s legendary name.Also read: Travis Kelce’s locker room stunned and electrified as Taylor Swift turns up for Kansas City Chiefs’ Week 3 clash against Chicago Bears With roster cuts imminent, Sanders’ future in Tampa Bay is uncertain.

In the NFL, the spotlight can elevate or expose, and for Shilo Sanders, the coming days will define which side of that spectrum he lands on.","Shilo Sanders was ejected after throwing a punch at Buffalo Bills tight end Zach Davidson.

The violent incident and its fallout

Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson has spoken out for the first time after his son became embroiled in an incredible incident at a Knokx Pro Wrestling event at the LA Throwdown on August 23, 2025. The attack occurred in front of hundreds of viewers watching live on Kick during the professional wrestling match between Raja, a 25-year-old MMA fighter, and independent wrestler Stuart ‘Syko Stu’ Smith. Updates discussed include Syko Stu on the road to recovery, and Rampage recognised the incident as a 'work gone wrong'.To set the record straight, Rampage Jackson put out a message on X and set the record straight in a heartfelt post. He also contradicted speculation that Syko would suffer worse fates by announcing that Syko Stu is “conscious and stable"". He explained that the segment was to be entertainment, a ""work,"" but it did not quite turn out that way.Rampage attributed the event to poor judgment and a misunderstanding, emphasizing that his son was trained for MMA, not pro wrestling, and doesn't belong in one of those shows. Just days prior, he said Raja had received a concussion while MMA sparring and shouldn't have been competing.Rampage criticized Raja's actions in a statement and said he fears for the safety of his son and Syko Stu, who has been hospitalized with serious injuries, and apologized to both the injured wrestler and the Kick streaming platform.Also Read: From doubt to glory: Tapasya Gahlawat becomes U20 world wrestling champion The incident took place at a live Knokx Pro show, when Raja, who was not even scheduled to wrestle that night, entered the ring during Syko Stu‘s match.

Eventually, other performers stepped in to put a stop to the attack.As per the people in attendance, Raja was part of whatever was planned for the segment, but the stiff shots were not pre-planned. It said that the incident was the result of a backstage brawl in which Raja claimed Syko Stu threw a can of drink at him. Then he was pushed to take “revenge” in the ring, which he took as part of the show but much too far.Syko Stu, who is a U.S. Army veteran as well as a respected name in the independent wrestling scene, was hospitalized in serious condition but has since been reported to be stable.

She shared a short video filled with fan edits and iconic cheerleading moments. In her caption, Union wrote,“25 years later and the spirit lives on! Back then, I never imagined the blessings that came with stepping into that Clover uniform. It truly is the gift that keeps giving.”Union also spoke in the video, saying, “I cannot believe… 25 years. That's a quarter of a century since Bring It On came out,"" she said, remembering shooting in San Diego in 1999. The cast believed they were simply producing a lighthearted film about cheerleaders. Rather, the movie grew to be a teenage classic that also brought up issues of race, animosity, and identity.She added, “Fans have shown up since day one and continue to inspire new generations of Bring It On-ers. All the Clovers and the Toros, you have been bringing it with your spirit fingers!”Union also honored her late co-star Natina Reed, who played Jenelope, saying, “Much love always, and to our forever Clover, Natina Reed.”The 25th anniversary brought reflection too.

That was my failure.”Her honesty struck fans, showing that even with a beloved role, she still questions her choices years later.What makes this anniversary sweeter is how Bring It On quietly tied into Gabrielle Union’s personal life. During an old episode of TODAY with Jenna & Friends, Union and Dwyane Wade revealed how they first met. It was at the NBA All-Star Weekend in 2002.

Wade later laughed, saying he immediately recognized her as “Gabrielle Union from Bring It On. ”The pair met again years later at a Super Bowl party they co-hosted. That second meeting sparked the romance that eventually turned into marriage in 2014.Even today, Bring It On is part of their marriage jokes. Back in 2020, NBA star Rex Chapman posted a clip of Union as Isis leading her squad. Wade jumped into the comments, teasing, “That’s her ‘I mean business’ walk… every time I leave the toothpaste cap off.” Union replied with laughter, keeping their inside joke alive.Over the years, Wade has often poked fun at Union’s fierce on-screen walk, while she uses it to playfully remind him of little habits at home.For Union, the film still holds deep meaning. In a past interview with Vogue, she said, “I didn’t want the Clovers to be saved by anyone else.

Shilo Sanders’ NFL dream with Buccaneers ends abruptly as team waives rookie after preseason drama

What’s next for Shilo Sanders in the NFL?



The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have officially parted ways with rookie safety Shilo Sanders after a turbulent preseason. Sanders, the elder son of Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, saw his NFL journey hit a setback following an ejection in Saturday night’s matchup against the Buffalo Bills. The decision, though not surprising, underscores the fine margins undrafted rookies face when fighting for a spot in the league.Shilo Sanders’ chance to solidify his role ended abruptly when he got into a heated on-field altercation with Buffalo tight end Zach Davidson. The rookie was tossed from the game, drawing swift criticism from head coach Todd Bowles. “You can’t throw punches in this league. That’s inexcusable,” Bowles said firmly. “They’re going to get you every time. You’ve got to grow from that.”The ejection wasn’t the sole reason for the Buccaneers’ decision, but it proved to be the tipping point. According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, “Buccaneers informed rookie safety Shilo Sanders today that he is being waived, per his agents Drew Rosenhaus and Robert Bailey.” For an undrafted free agent already facing an uphill battle, every snap mattered.Sanders struggled with pass coverage in limited preseason action, and the untimely incident further dented his chances.Meanwhile, some fans blamed the NFL for treating like this with Sanders family and brought the racism debate.At 25, Shilo Sanders carried both potential and pressure. Competing for a backup safety spot, he needed flawless execution and composure to earn trust from the coaching staff. Unfortunately, with Tampa Bay trimming its roster from 90 to 53 players, his margin for error was non-existent.Being waived doesn’t mark the end of Sanders’ career. By rule, he now enters waivers, where the other 31 NFL teams have a chance to claim him. If unclaimed, he’ll become a free agent, eligible to sign with any franchise. His most realistic path could be through a practice squad role. Teams often keep developmental players there, providing opportunities to grow and step up if injuries or trades create roster openings.For Shilo, this setback may serve as a crucial learning moment. The NFL is an unforgiving environment, particularly for undrafted rookies trying to prove their worth. Emotional maturity and discipline matter as much as athleticism. If Sanders can channel this experience into growth, his story in professional football may be far from over.Also Read: Why was Shilo Sanders ejected during Buccaneers’ preseason game against the Buffalo Bills","The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have officially parted ways with rookie safety Shilo Sanders.

Potential destinations and Evgeni Malkin’s control over his future

The Pittsburgh Penguins are entering what could be a defining season for veteran star Evgeni Malkin. Reports suggest this may be Malkin’s final campaign with the team, as Pittsburgh navigates a major roster transition under President Kyle Dubas. While no official confirmation has come, insiders and media analysts alike are bracing for potential moves that could reshape the Penguins’ core.The team’s front office is actively trying to get faster and younger while maintaining some veteran presence. The attempted trade of Erik Karlsson, which has yet to materialize despite talks with the Carolina Hurricanes and Toronto Maple Leafs, highlights the complexity of Pittsburgh’s summer. Meanwhile, Malkin, entering the final season of his contract, is unlikely to sign an extension at 39. He recorded 50 points in 68 games last season, but the signs of age-related decline are becoming noticeable.“Even though it's not official, this is Evgeni Malkin's farewell tour,” reported Josh Yohe on the Athletic Hockey Show. The Penguins’ fans may soon witness the end of an era as one of the franchise’s greatest talents nears the twilight of his career.Malkin’s no-movement clause gives him substantial control over his next steps. Among the teams most linked to the superstar are the Vegas Golden Knights, Florida Panthers, and New York Rangers. With $6.1 million owed against the salary cap this season, the Penguins must consider both financial flexibility and competitive strategy.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Vancouver Canucks push for middle-six center as trade market heats up Kyle Dubas praised Malkin’s career, calling him “the most underrated player maybe to ever play.” If Pittsburgh struggles early this season, trade speculation will intensify, and the Penguins may face difficult choices regarding their veteran core. Malkin’s next move could significantly impact the team’s direction and the broader NHL landscape, making this one of the most closely watched storylines of the 2025-26 season.","Evgeni Malkin is entering the final season of his contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins.

NHL Update From Europe | 32 Thoughts

Connor McDavid focused on winning Stanley Cups before committing long-term

Connor McDavid’s future with the Edmonton Oilers is moving closer to a resolution, with NHL insider Elliotte Friedman hinting that contract extension talks could begin sooner than many anticipated. With one year left on his eight-year, $100 million deal, McDavid remains the most important player for Edmonton as they aim to build a team capable of ending their Stanley Cup drought.Elliotte Friedman suggested on the 32 Thoughts podcast that discussions could start between Canada’s 2026 Olympic orientation camp and the Oilers’ training camp. “Well, just at the start of the camp, I could see it,” Friedman said. “Look, I just think everybody wants to get it done. So I would expect [between] the Olympic camp and training camp, they sit down, they say, 'How’s this all going to look?’”Oilers general manager Stan Bowman has confirmed McDavid is a top priority, calling him “the best player in the League” and emphasizing that the team is ready to meet whenever McDavid is prepared. “Certainly we’re eager to meet with him whenever he wants. Timing-wise, Connor is going to drive that process,” Bowman stated.Despite the looming extension, McDavid’s main focus remains on winning. After another 100-point season and a deep playoff run that ended in a second consecutive loss to the Florida Panthers in the Stanley Cup Final, McDavid reiterated that team success is his priority. “Winning would be at the top of the list,” he said.“Winning is the most important thing. If I feel there’s a good window to win here over and over again, then signing is no problem. ”Also Read: Connor McDavid’s future in Edmonton questioned as Oilers alumni debate short-term contract strategy The Oilers’ roster will face new challenges this season following the departures of Evander Kane and Corey Perry.

Matthew Knies set for invaluable experience with Team USA’s best



Matthew Knies embracing higher expectations with Leafs and beyond



For Maple Leafs forward Matthew Knies, this summer has become about more than just preparation for the upcoming NHL season. Though he wasn’t chosen for Team USA’s roster at the 4-Nations Face-Off, Knies has another opportunity to showcase his talent. Later this month, he will skate alongside some of hockey’s biggest American stars at Team USA’s Olympic Selection Camp in Plymouth, aiming to earn a place at the 2026 Winter Olympics.Matthew Knies will join Auston Matthews, Patrick Kane, Jack Eichel, and Brady Tkachuk at the two-day event on August 26 and 27. For the 22-year-old winger, it represents more than just drills and scrimmages—it’s a chance to absorb wisdom from some of the league’s elite.“That is going to be a cool experience, just to meet a lot of those (Americans) to see what they do on and off the ice,” Knies shared. “Pick each other’s brains. Hopefully, I get a strong start to the season and make that team.”Already admired for his unique mix of size and skill—a combination that earned him the “unicorn” label—Knies has hinted at sharpening the more physical aspects of his game. His willingness to embrace the role of an agitator stems from influences like Tom Wilson, and spending time with Tkachuk could help him expand that edge.While the camp is a key milestone, Knies enters this season carrying significant expectations in Toronto. Fresh off a 29-goal, 58-point campaign, he begins the first year of a six-year contract extension signed in June. That deal places him firmly in the Maple Leafs’ long-term vision, but it also raises the bar for what he must deliver.Balancing the demands of the NHL and the opportunity to represent his country won’t be easy, yet Knies appears ready for the challenge. The next few weeks could shape both his Olympic aspirations and his role as a cornerstone for the Leafs moving forward.Also Read: Former Penguins star Jared McCann reportedly on radar of two Eastern Conference rivals in potential blockbuster trade",Matthew Knies will join some of hockey's biggest stars at Team USA's Olympic Selection Camp in Plymouth.

Darja Varfolomeev takes title in Rio as Sofia Raffaeli and Stiliana Nikolova win medals

FIG admits computer glitch and recalls past judging errors



Germany’s Darja Varfolomeev kept her crown in the individual all-around at the 2025 Rhythmic Gymnastics World Championships in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, but the event ended with an apology from the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG). On August 24, 2025, FIG admitted there had been a computer error during the Group All-Around qualifications, which forced the competition to stop for almost 50 minutes while judges fixed the scores. The governing body later said, “We deeply regret the incident that occurred this afternoon during the group qualifications and extend our sincere apologies.”The championships in Rio de Janeiro were historic, marking the 41st edition and the first time ever in South America. On the final day, Darja Varfolomeev defended her title with gold in the individual all-around. Stiliana Nikolova of Bulgaria won silver, and Sofia Raffaeli of Italy took bronze.For the United States, the team of Rin Keys, Megan Chu, and the Senior Group scored a total of 253.600 points, finishing 12th in the team standings. In the Group All-Around, the U.S. Senior Group placed 31st with 32.700 points, while Japan claimed the gold medal with a score of 55.550.But the Group All-Around also saw the error that led to the FIG’s apology. Judges noticed that deductions for artistry were not showing up correctly in the overall scores. This was later confirmed as a computer glitch in the scoring system.Also Read: Ryan Garcia Blasts Raja Jackson After Brutal Attack Leaves Syko Stu Unconscious In California Ring The FIG explained the issue in a letter sent to all national federations competing in Rio. The body said, “Thanks to the entry logs, we were able to re-enter all the data initially recorded by each judge on their tablets and recalculate the scores. For this reason, your scores have been slightly adjusted. However, we can confirm that they are now correct and accurately reflect what took place during the performance of your Group. ”This was not the first time scoring mistakes have troubled gymnastics. At the 2025 U.S. Classic, Myli Lew received a score of 14.050 on uneven bars, which raised questions because of repeated skills and composition errors.In May 2024, at the Rhythmic Gymnastics World Cup in Athens, Greece, FIG also admitted a serious scoring error after judges’ scores were reversed in the clubs and ribbon qualifications. That mistake changed the rankings and forced FIG to cut ties with the scoring provider Best Solutions International (Bulgaria).In Athens, Darja Varfolomeev also dominated, winning all-around, clubs, and ball, while Sofia Raffaeli won ribbon and Wang Zilu of China took hoop. In the group events, Italy won 5 hoops, and China took the combination routine.","International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) apologizes for scoring mistake.

Leasha Larkpor of Thunder Team Realty, an agent in Oklahoma City , listed the house. However, she later clarified the reason. In July, she sent an email to the New York Post and revealed that it was just a marketing gimmick. She further stated:""The owner felt like a basketball enthusiast or Kevin Durant fan would be interested in owning a piece of history… The owner is expecting to have offers around $1 million.""The agent's website no longer has the listing. The Paycom Centre, where the OKC Thunders play their home games, is only a short drive from the gorgeous townhouse. It has three levels.According to Realtor.com, the NBA icon purchased the two three-story brownstones and then combined them into a single residence.

Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift: A partnership of mutual support



Taylor Swift’s presence in the NFL world has once again made headlines, this time by lending her support to ESPN’s newly released docuseries on the Kansas City Chiefs, The Kingdom. The six-part series not only highlights the reigning Super Bowl champions’ 2024 season but also dives into the history of the franchise. According to director Kristen Lappas, Swift “approved all of her image and likeness” and was “very supportive” of the project.Although Swift wasn’t interviewed for the series, her involvement is felt throughout. Chiefs CMO Lara Krug explained, “Now you see her in the way that I think is how she wanted to be seen, which is as a fan of the community.” Her image appears naturally within the narrative of the team rather than as a central storyline, keeping the focus on Travis Kelce, Patrick Mahomes, Chris Jones, Andy Reid, and the Chiefs dynasty.Swift’s support comes as no surprise. Since her relationship with Kelce began in 2023, she has been a visible figure at stadiums across the country, cheering from the stands at regular-season games and Super Bowls alike.Kelce himself admitted to GQ that she has transformed into a passionate fan: “She is the most engulfed fan now. She knows what the injury reports look like… third and short, all these things, because she just naturally loves to hear about my job. ”Her own words reflect this journey. On the “New Heights” podcast, she confessed, “I didn’t know what a first down was. I didn’t know what a tight end was,” but with Kelce’s guidance, she became “obsessed” with football. Her enthusiasm reached a point where she joked about celebrating draft picks at home like a lifelong fan.The connection isn’t one-sided. Kelce gushed about being at her concerts, saying, “I get to go and be that fan. Because I am a fan.” Their mutual admiration has spilled over into sports and entertainment, making them one of the most talked-about celebrity couples.Even Chiefs executives acknowledge Swift’s impact. CEO Clark Hunt estimated that her presence spurred “a 30 percent growth in our fan base.” For fans tuning into The Kingdom, it’s clear that Swift’s role goes far beyond the stands—she has become a part of the Chiefs’ evolving story.Even Ed Kelce said recently while attending the premiere of The Kingdom in Kansas City on Sunday, Aug. 24 that Travis Kelce finds joy and happiness in Taylor Swift. When asked about the reason behind Travis’ happiness, Ed responded without hesitation, “Taylor. There’s absolutely no doubt about it.”For Ed, pride in his son stretches far beyond football accolades. While Travis has built a reputation as a record-breaking athlete, his father sees just as much value in the roles he plays as a son, friend, and partner.“I think his continued work ethic is something that really makes you happy. That, combined with the efforts that he puts forth for those less fortunate, for the underserved communities. I think it's a combination of those things,” he shared with PEOPLE. “He has really dedicated himself this season, too. I mean, he's in the best shape I think he's been in a long time.”Fans looking for a deeper glimpse into Travis’ journey can watch The Kingdom, a multi-part series documenting the Kansas City Chiefs’ 2024 campaign and highlighting the franchise’s rich place in NFL history, now streaming on ESPN+.Also Read: ""The league is conspiring against that family"": Fans bring racism debate as Buccaneers waive Shilo Sanders after preseason ejection shocker","Taylor Swift has lent her support to ESPN’s newly released docuseries on the Kansas City Chiefs, The Kingdom.

Bill Gates reveals his winning answer to ‘why should we hire you’ to crack any interview,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-reveals-his-winning-answer-to-why-should-we-hire-you-to-crack-any-interview/articleshow/123405257.cms,"

Bill Gates answers why should we hire you?

What are your strengths and weaknesses?





Where do you see yourself in five years?



What are your salary expectations?





Bill Gates’ final advice

When it comes to cracking a job interview, even the brightest candidates often stumble on the most common questions. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates , who has not only given interviews in his youth but also conducted countless ones as an employer, recently shared how to approach some of the trickiest questions that appear in almost every interview. Gates believes that while technical skills matter, the way candidates express their motivation, adaptability, and problem-solving abilities makes a lasting impression. His advice offers a mix of honesty, preparation, and strategic thinking that can help job seekers stand out in today’s highly competitive hiring environment.Gates emphasizes that this question isn’t about boasting but about clearly communicating your value in a way that resonates with the employer. He explains that hiring managers are not just looking for a list of accomplishments – they want to see how your skills and mindset directly align with the company’s mission and challenges. Instead of giving vague responses like “I work hard” or “I’m a team player,” Gates suggests tailoring your answer to highlight the exact strengths the employer is seeking. For example, if the role demands innovation, a candidate could describe a time when they creatively solved a difficult problem and how that approach could benefit the company.As an example, Gates himself often pointed to his coding achievements, deep passion for software, teamwork skills, and ambition when answering this question during his early career. By showcasing not only what he had already accomplished but also his enthusiasm and hunger to grow, he left interviewers convinced of his long-term potential. He advises modern candidates to take a similar approach: connect your unique skills directly to the company’s needs, show you are motivated to grow with the role, and position yourself as someone who can contribute to both short-term impact and long-term vision.According to Gates, this question is an opportunity for self-awareness rather than self-promotion. He recommends that candidates choose strengths that are relevant to the job while explaining how those qualities have produced real results in the past. On weaknesses, Gates suggests honesty balanced with growth – admitting areas of improvement while showing the steps you are taking to overcome them. This demonstrates maturity and a willingness to learn, qualities employers value highly.Bill Gates’ own answer: Gates admitted that he was not particularly skilled in marketing or sales, but he excelled in product creation and defining features. By acknowledging weaknesses without trying to disguise them, while doubling down on his true strengths, Gates showed the kind of critical self-awareness employers value.Gates points out that this question is less about predicting the future and more about revealing ambition. Employers want to see that candidates have direction and drive. He suggests aligning your career goals with the company’s growth, showing that you want to grow alongside the organization. Even if the long-term vision evolves, demonstrating that you think ahead and are motivated to build a future leaves a strong impression.On this tricky question, Gates advises candidates to strike a balance between confidence and flexibility. Being too rigid about salary can make you seem difficult to work with, while undervaluing yourself may raise doubts about your worth. Gates recommends doing prior research on industry standards and giving a reasonable range instead of a fixed number. He also stresses framing salary discussions in terms of value – how your skills and contributions justify the compensation – while showing openness to negotiation. This demonstrates professionalism and practicality, traits employers respect. In today’s fast-changing job market, Gates’ timeless advice highlights that authenticity, preparation, and adaptability are key. For candidates, mastering these principles can mean the difference between just attending an interview and truly acing it. Ultimately, Gates believes that interviews are less about perfection and more about authenticity. By staying true to your skills while demonstrating curiosity and growth, you can turn any interview into a lasting opportunity.For Gates, interviews are not just about answering questions but about telling a story – one that highlights your passion, your potential, and your fit with the company’s culture. He encourages candidates to prepare, practice, and remain authentic, reminding them that the goal is not perfection but connection. By framing common questions as opportunities to reveal character and ambition, Gates believes any candidate can turn a stressful interview into a powerful career breakthrough. According to a 2024 LinkedIn Workplace Learning Report, communication, adaptability, and problem-solving rank among the top three skills employers look for in interviews worldwide. Gates reminds candidates that confidence paired with curiosity often leaves a stronger impression than rehearsed answers. Embracing challenges and demonstrating adaptability can set you apart in any competitive interview. Gates believes that the candidates who succeed are those who combine skills with purpose, showing not just what they can do but why they want to do it.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates shares his advice on how to ace a job interview.

A lighthearted clip, posted by FIDE (the governing body for chess) across their social media platforms, has gone viral after India’s Divya Deshmukh, the 2025 Women’s World Cup champion, was asked which chess rule she would like to change.With a cheeky smile, she replied: “No jeans!” before bursting into laughter, a playful nod to one of the most memorable controversies in recent chess history.Watch:Her answer immediately evoked memories of world No. 1 Magnus Carlsen ’s infamous jeans incident at the 2024 World Rapid Championship in New York.Carlsen had been told by arbiters to swap his size-32 Corneliani jeans for more formal attire in line with the tournament’s dress code.Instead, he refused, accepted a $200 fine, and ultimately forfeited his final round of the day.The bold stance sparked a storm of debate over how much freedom players should have in expressing themselves during competition.Far from fading, the jeans episode has only grown in legend.Earlier this year, the very same pair was auctioned in collaboration with Chess.com, drawing enormous global attention. Initially stuck at $14,100, the bidding exploded in the final 30 minutes, with 29 rapid-fire bids pushing the price up to an astonishing $36,100, all of which Carlsen pledged to donate to charity.The winning bidder, who remains anonymous, also paid $74 in shipping for what is now one of the most famous garments in the chess world.From a rule dispute to a charitable milestone, Carlsen’s jeans have become a quirky yet powerful symbol in chess, and Divya Deshmukh’s playful “no jeans” answer shows the story still resonates in the sport’s culture.","Divya Deshmukh, the 2025 Women’s World Cup champion, was asked which chess rule she would like to change.

Cooper Connolly, a 22-year-old Australian spinner, made history on Sunday, August 24, 2025, by becoming the first spinner from Australia to claim a five-wicket haul in an ODI match against South Africa at Great Barrier Reef Arena in Mackay. Bowling six overs for the Mitchell Marsh-led side, Connolly recorded figures of 5/22, marking the best-ever bowling performance by an Australian spinner on home soil.The young spinner's remarkable performance began when he dismissed Tony de Zorzi for 33 runs, caught by Alex Carey on the third ball of the 14th over during South Africa's run chase. His second wicket came in the form of Dewald Brevis, who was caught by Cameron Green after an aggressive innings of 49 runs off 28 balls, including two fours and five sixes.Connolly continued his impressive spell by claiming his third wicket when Wiaan Mulder, scoring 5 runs, was caught by Marnus Labuschagne in the 20th over. The fourth wicket followed shortly after when Corbin Bosch, who made 17 runs from 15 balls, was also caught by Labuschagne in Connolly's next over.The historic fifth wicket was secured on the fifth ball of the 24th over when wicketkeeper Josh Inglis stumped Keshav Maharaj, completing Connolly's maiden five-wicket haul in ODI cricket.Connolly's figures of 5/22 rank among the most impressive bowling performances in Australian ODI history against South Africa, joining the elite company of fast bowlers Andy Bichel (5/19), Brett Lee (5/22), Josh Hazlewood (5/31), and Nathan Bracken (5/67).The performance stands as the 10th-best bowling figures by an Australian bowler in Australia, placing Connolly alongside cricket legends like Mitchell Starc, Greg Chappell, and Carl Rackemann in the record books.In the context of spin bowling performances in Australia, Connolly's figures surpass previous benchmarks set by established spinners Brad Hogg (5/32), Shane Warne (5/33), and Adam Zampa (5/35), marking the best figures by an Australian spinner in home conditions.The achievement also places Connolly among the most successful spinners to have bowled in Australia, joining an illustrious list that includes international spinners like Yuzvendra Chahal , Ryan Burl, and Ravi Shastri, who have all recorded five-wicket hauls on Australian soil.This performance represents a significant milestone in Australian cricket history, particularly in the context of spin bowling, as it demonstrates the evolving role and effectiveness of spin bowlers in Australian conditions, traditionally known to favor pace bowling.The match, which featured a substantial target of 432 runs for South Africa to chase, saw Connolly's spell play a crucial role in the Australian team's bowling effort, with his economical figures of 5/22 from six overs significantly impacting the opposition's batting lineup.","Cooper Connolly, a 22-year-old Australian spinner, made history on Sunday, August 24, 2025, by becoming the first spinner from Australia to claim a five- wicket haul in an ODI match.

Significance of Rabi Al Awwal and its timing









Rabi Al Awwal will begin on Monday in the UAE, a day later than several other Arab nations, setting different start dates across countries for the Islamic month that holds the Prophet Muhammad’s (PBUH) birthdayThe UAE's astronomy centre has confirmed that the crescent moon marking the start of Rabi Al Awwal was not sighted on Saturday, August 23. As a result, the current Islamic month of Safar will complete 30 days, and Rabi Al Awwal will officially begin on Monday, August 25, 1447 AH in the Hijri calendar.Efforts to observe the moon were conducted using a range of tools — including telescopes and ultra-high-resolution astronomical imaging — but the crescent remained invisible from all regions within the Arab world on Saturday.This celestial observation also sets the date for the 12th day of Rabi Al Awwal — a significant date marking the birth of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). In the UAE, this will fall on Friday, September 5. Though no formal announcement has been made yet, this timing may potentially lead to a three-day public holiday for residents, aligning with the weekend.In an uncommon development, the UAE will not be aligning with Saudi Arabia and several other nations in beginning Rabi Al Awwal on the same day.In these countries, the crescent moon was visible on Sunday — in some regions easily with the naked eye, and in northern parts of Asia, with more difficulty.This divergence in moon sighting dates, though not unprecedented, reflects the geographical and atmospheric variations affecting lunar visibility.Two days before the official confirmation, on Friday, August 22, astronomers at Al-Khatim Astronomical Observatory managed to photograph the crescent marking the end of Safar 1447 AH. Despite dusty skies and partial cloud cover, the team captured the crescent — though visibility remained limited, and the precise start of Rabi Al Awwal could not be determined conclusively at that time.The UAE follows a systematic process for confirming the start of each Islamic month. On the 29th day of every Hijri month, the national moon sighting committee convenes to observe and verify the appearance of the new crescent. The Islamic (Hijri) calendar is based entirely on lunar cycles, and the beginning of each month is dependent on the first visible sighting of the crescent moon.Rabi Al Awwal, the third month in the Islamic calendar, holds special significance in the Muslim world as it marks the birth of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). The 12th day of this month is commemorated in many countries with prayers, community gatherings, and — in some cases — public holidays.As the Hijri calendar is approximately 11 days shorter than the Gregorian year, Islamic dates shift earlier each year. This dynamic nature adds complexity to planning and alignment of religious observances, particularly in countries that rely on precise astronomical data rather than pre-calculated calendars.","Rabi Al Awwal, the third month in the Islamic calendar, holds special significance in the Muslim world as it marks the birth of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) The UAE will not be aligning with Saudi Arabia and several other nations in beginning Rabi Al awwal on the same day.

Will Shedeur Sanders play against the Rams today?



How to watch Browns vs Rams pre-season game?



Shedeur Sanders’ NFL journey has already taken some quick turns. The rookie quarterback opened eyes with an efficient debut in the Cleveland Browns’ preseason win over the Carolina Panthers but was sidelined in Week 2 with an oblique injury. Now, all attention shifts to whether the Colorado product can make a strong return in the Browns’ preseason finale against the Los Angeles Rams.Yes, Shedeur Sanders will take part in today's pre-season game against Rams. Cleveland has already named veteran Joe Flacco as its Week 1 starter, yet the franchise remains invested in developing its younger passers. That’s why Sanders’ snaps on Saturday carry weight. Head coach Kevin Stefanski confirmed that Sanders will indeed play, outlining the order: “Joe Flacco will start, with Dillon Gabriel relieving him and Sanders rounding out the rotation. ”The fifth-round pick has not seen live action since his sharp showing against Carolina. While fellow rookie Gabriel received extended reps in Week 2, Sanders was held out after suffering his oblique issue in practice. Stefanski explained the team’s cautious approach: “If it's a right guard, you can play through that. When it's a quarterback, you kind of need that muscle to throw. So unfortunately we're going to put him down for a little bit here.Saturday’s matchup won’t just be another preseason game—it’s a measuring stick for Sanders’ readiness and a chance to solidify his place on Cleveland’s 53-man roster. The Browns don’t need to rush him, but getting another look at his decision-making and poise will help shape the team’s depth chart.As Stefanski put it, “He’s feeling better and better, so barring any setback … he would play on Saturday.” For Sanders, it’s a crucial opportunity to remind Cleveland why he belongs in their long-term plans.The Los Angeles Rams and Cleveland Browns are set to face off in an exciting preseason clash on Saturday, Aug. 23, with kickoff scheduled for 1 p.m. ET. While preseason games don’t carry the weight of the regular season, they give fans a chance to witness new talent, evaluate rosters, and get an early feel for how teams are shaping up ahead of the NFL grind.

Poll Who do you think had the best performance at the Inter-State meet? Rohit Yadav (Javelin) Sreeshankar Murali (Long Jump) Ankita Dhyani (3000m Steeplechase) All of them performed well!

The final day of qualification for the Tokyo World Athletics Championships put the spotlight on the men’s javelin and long jump events at the Inter-State meet. In men’s javelin on Sunday, Rohit Yadav recorded a personal-best of 83.65m to win gold but it was not enough for the direct qualifying mark.The Uttar Pradesh athlete opened with 77.31m and improved steadily — his third throw proved to be the best, securing him the top spot. While he aimed to surpass the automatic qualification mark of 85.50m, it remained out of his reach. Despite that, Rohit’s performance is expected to place him within the top-36 in the ‘Road to Tokyo’ rankings, keeping his hopes alive for qualification for the Worlds.Sreeshankar Murali (8.06m) from Kerala took the top spot in men’s long jump but his qualification to the Worlds looks unlikely as he could finish just outside the top-36 in the ‘Road to Tokyo’ chart.“I just wanted this season to be a kickstarter for next year, with the Commonwealth and Asian Games coming up. I am not sure if I can qualify (for Tokyo), but I think the season is pretty much over for me. Whatever has happened this season, I will just embrace it because on this day last year, I was not even sure if I would be jumping again,” Sreeshankar said.The 26-year-old Sreeshankar returned from an injury break in July and has since competed in five competitions.“I was chasing something (Worlds qualification) that was meant to be achieved over the course of a year. I felt like I could reach the automatic qualifying mark here, but it is fine. Coming into this meet, it was more about physical preparation for me, as I had been away from jumping for the past one and a half years and have been competing continuously since. My body is not used to such heavy volumes, but I was giving it a try.”In women’s 3000m steeplechase, Ankita Dhyani (9:44.83) of Uttarakhand finished first but did not see much improvement in the rankings for Tokyo.
