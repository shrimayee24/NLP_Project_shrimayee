BHUBANESWAR: Not smoke. Not mirrors. Just steel that wasn’t there. Three decades after magician PC Sorcar Jr stunned a live crowd by making a passenger train “vanish” at Bardhaman in Bengal, rail travellers in western Odisha faced a far less theatrical disappearance — a reserved coach that never showed up.Passengers holding confirmed tickets for a 3AC coach on Sambalpur–Nanded Nagavali Superfast Exp discovered Sunday morning that their coach was missing when train 20809 rolled into Sambalpur, 320km west of Bhubaneswar.Sorcar’s act relied on lighting, timing and crowd control. This one needed none of that — just confirmed tickets, an absent coach and a reminder that on Indian Railways , reality can outdo illusion.The train departed Sambalpur without coach BE2. Confusion followed on the platform. Ticket examiners fielded protests as travellers were unsure whether to board. Others climbed into any coach they could find. Over 30 passengers with confirmed berths scattered across the train.East Coast Railway blamed a technical snag that prevented attachment of the coach. The issue was resolved when train reached Visakhapatnam Jn, where an AC coach was added.","Passengers holding confirmed tickets for a 3AC coach on Sambalpur–Nanded Nagavali Superfast Exp discovered Sunday morning that their coach was missing.

Lindsey Vonn reflects on Erich Sailer as knee injury clouds Milan Cortina Olympic plans

Lindsey Vonn is hurting, unsure, and waiting for medical answers just days before the Winter Games. On Friday, Jan. 30, she crashed during a World Cup downhill race in Crans-Montana and injured her left knee. The fall came in poor visibility, and the race was later stopped for safety. Vonn was taken by helicopter to a local hospital. Since then, she has not said if she will race at the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics.As she waits, Vonn turned to someone who shaped her life in the sport. On Monday, Feb. 2, she visited the grave of her late coach, Erich Sailer, and shared the moment online. Her message was short, honest, and full of feeling. “I know exactly what he would say… Just wish he was here to say it,” Lindsey Vonn wrote on her Instagram Stories, posting a photo of Sailer’s gravesite. The timing says everything, the Olympics are close, her knee is hurt and her future for this month is still unknown. In that space between hope and doubt, Vonn chose to remember the person who always guided her.Sailer was not just another coach in Vonn’s life. He was there from the very start.According to The Athletic, he coached Vonn’s father, Alan Kildow, and was even at the hospital on the day Vonn was born. When she was seven years old, Sailer began coaching her too. Their bond lasted decades. Sailer died in August 2025 at the age of 99.Vonn’s injury happened fast and hard. After losing control during the downhill run, she slammed into the safety nets and grabbed her left knee. Medical staff rushed to help her on the slope. Later that day, she explained the situation herself.“I crashed today in the Downhill race in Switzerland and injured my left knee,” Vonn wrote in a statement shared on Instagram. “I am discussing the situation with my doctors and team and will continue to undergo further exams.”She did not hide how heavy the moment feels. “This is a very difficult outcome one week before the Olympics… but if there’s one thing I know how to do, it’s a comeback. My Olympic dream is not over,” she wrote. “Thank you for all of the love and support. I will give more information when I have it. Thank you to all the medical staff who helped me today. I am grateful for all the incredible help I received.”The next day, Vonn skipped the Super-G race and cheered for her teammates instead. “Thank you for all of the love and support I have received,” she posted. “Means the world to me. Doing my best right now…. 🙏🏻🤞🏻.”At 41, Lindsey Vonn is trying to return to the Olympics after years away and many injuries. If she does race, she could become the oldest woman to compete in Olympic alpine skiing. For now, nothing is decided. What is clear is this: when things feel uncertain, Vonn goes back to her roots, to the coach who taught her how to believe.","American ski racer Lindsey Vonn crashed during a World Cup downhill race in Crans-Montana and injured her left knee.

Toni Nadal explains his view on Carlos Alcaraz, Novak Djokovic, and the modern rivalry

Carlos Alcaraz stood at the center of Rod Laver Arena on Sunday night with history in his hands. At just 22 years old, the Spaniard won the Australian Open and completed his Career Grand Slam. But even as the crowd celebrated, a different conversation started back in Spain. Rafael Nadal ’s father, Toni Nadal, said Alcaraz was “lucky” because the players he faced were not as strong as the ones from his own era.Carlos Alcaraz earned the title the hard way on paper. He lost the first set, then came back to beat Novak Djokovic 2-6, 6-2, 6-3, 7-5 in the final. The win stopped Djokovic from lifting his 11th Australian Open trophy. It also marked the first time Novak Djokovic lost an Australian Open final. That alone made the night historic. But Toni Nadal’s comments shifted the focus. While praising Alcaraz’s talent and fitness, he suggested today’s field does not test players the way it once did. The remarks quickly sparked debate across the tennis world.Speaking on Spanish radio station Onda Cero, Toni Nadal made it clear he admires Carlos Alcaraz. He spoke highly of his speed, strength, and skill. Still, he added one sharp point.According to Toni, Alcaraz benefits from facing rivals who are not as dangerous as past stars.Toni compared today’s tour to matches against Juan Martín del Potro, Andy Murray, and Stan Wawrinka. He said that in those days, even a great player knew trouble was coming. A strong day from any of them could change everything.Carlos Alcaraz’s path in Melbourne included wins over Adam Walton, Yannick Hanfmann, Corentin Moutet, Tommy Paul, Alex de Minaur, and Alexander Zverev. The final test came against Novak Djokovic, who had never lost an Australian Open final before this match.The conversation also touched on Alcaraz’s growing rivalry with Jannik Sinner. Toni said he personally prefers Alcaraz, noting that their matches depend more on what Alcaraz chooses to do. However, he added that Sinner looks steadier over time.After losing to Novak Djokovic in the semifinals, Sinner is set to drop 1,200 ATP points. The gap at the top has widened, with Alcaraz now holding a clear lead in the rankings.Carlos Alcaraz, meanwhile, stayed focused on his moment. After the final, he said, “It means the world to me. It is a dream come true. Nobody knows how hard I’ve been working to get this trophy. I just chased this moment so much.”With this win, Carlos Alcaraz became only the ninth man to win all four majors. He is also the youngest to reach seven Grand Slam titles. While comparisons will continue, his story is still being written.","Carlos Alcaraz beat Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open final on Sunday.

NHL Trade Rumors: Artemi Panarin ready to waive clause and join Oilers as rental if contract extension talks stall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-artemi-panarin-ready-to-waive-clause-and-join-oilers-as-rental-if-contract-extension-talks-stall/articleshow/127873684.cms,"Artemi Panarin trade rumors (Getty Images)

Artemi Panarin could join Oilers as a rental if extension talks collapse



Panarin + Oilers = Stanley Cup? Breaking Down the Deadline Move

Artemi Panarin’s name is once again sparking trade chatter, and the Edmonton Oilers have emerged as a front-runner in the speculation. According to insider Dave Pagnotta, Panarin could waive his no-move clause to join the Oilers as a short-term rental if contract extension talks fall through. This revelation puts Edmonton in a prime position to land one of the NHL’s most dynamic offensive talents without committing to a long-term deal.The 32-year-old winger has built a reputation as an elite playmaker capable of transforming any top-six lineup. Pagnotta noted on Oilersnation that Panarin would also consider the Colorado Avalanche or Dallas Stars in a similar rental scenario, but the Oilers’ championship window makes them an especially appealing option. The potential move could dramatically alter Edmonton’s playoff outlook while giving Panarin a chance to chase a Stanley Cup in the immediate term.Panarin’s willingness to join Edmonton comes with a key caveat: this is about pursuing a championship, not reshaping a franchise. Pagnotta emphasized that this would be a “veteran superstar’s desire to play for a Cup,” rather than a long-term, sign-and-trade arrangement.For the Oilers, pairing Panarin with Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl would create a virtually unstoppable top line and put enormous pressure on opposing defenses.The Oilers have consistently demonstrated they are willing to make bold moves when their championship window is open. With McDavid in his prime and Draisaitl’s scoring touch intact, Edmonton could amplify its attack immediately with Panarin’s playmaking skills. This strategic alignment makes the Oilers one of the most logical fits among potential suitors.Pagnotta also provided insights on the type of return the New York Rangers might expect. Notably, prospect Ike Howard would not be included, suggesting the Rangers are looking for a high-end rental return similar to Brock Nelson’s trade to Colorado. Such a framework allows Edmonton to make a competitive offer without sacrificing core young talent.Edmonton offers more than just offensive firepower. The team boasts an elite power play, strong centers, and a playoff-ready locker room. For a player like Panarin, this environment emphasizes immediate impact over carrying a franchise, giving him the chance to chase a Cup without long-term pressure.Colorado and Dallas present comparable opportunities, but the Oilers’ combination of skill, structure, and timing could make them Panarin’s preferred destination if he chooses to waive his clause.",Artemi Panarin could waive his no-move clause to join the Oilers as a short-term rental if contract extension talks fall through.

Who benefits more?

Short term:

Long term:

Thetrading Roki Sasaki to theforis not tied to any confirmed talks, but the idea has gained attention this offseason. The scenario reflects two teams with different priorities. Los Angeles is built to compete for titles now, while Detroit is still shaping a roster for the future.If a deal like this were completed, both pitching staffs would change immediately. The Dodgers would add one of the league’s most reliable starters, and the Tigers would receive a younger pitcher who could anchor their rotation for years. It is a classic exchange of present value for long-term control.Most projections follow a similar structure.• LHP Tarik Skubal (29, entering his final pre-free-agency season in 2026).• RHP Roki Sasaki (24, signed in 2025 with multiple years of team control).• One or two high-level prospects, likely close to the majors.Since Skubal is approaching free agency and Detroit is not yet a clear contender, the Tigers would likely demand players who can contribute soon. Sasaki fits that requirement because he is already progressing toward a full major-league role.The Los Angeles Dodgers project strong depth with Blake Snell, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Sasaki, and additional options such as Bobby Miller, Gavin Stone, and Michael Grove. Adding Skubal, a two-time Cy Young winner with a sub-2.00 ERA across recent seasons, would further stabilize the group.A rotation led by Skubal, Snell, and Yamamoto would give Los Angeles several postseason-caliber starters even after trading Sasaki.Tarik Skubal is projected to earn around $32 million through arbitration before becoming a free agent after the 2026 season. For the Los Angeles Dodgers, that is a manageable one-year commitment if it improves their chances of winning.Tarik Skubal enters his age-29 season and could command a contract exceeding $300 million if his performance continues. For a team still building toward contention, that level of commitment carries risk.• A 29-year-old Cy Young winner nearing free agencyfor• A 24-year-old starter with several years of control.Roki Sasaki’s minor-league results and brief MLB appearances point to strong strikeout ability and upper-90s velocity, though he has yet to prove himself across a full season.Detroit Tigers’ reported asking price suggests the club wants multiple premium assets. A package centered on Sasaki would help rebuild organizational depth, remove a possible $30 million-plus arbitration salary, and align the roster with a later competitive window.• Add a proven frontline starter.• Avoid a long-term contract commitment.• Maintain rotation depth.• Lose a young pitcher with long-term upside.• Take on a large arbitration salary.• Risk losing Skubal after one season.• Gain a younger starter with team control.• Avoid a costly arbitration year and future contract.• Add additional prospects.• Trade one of the league’s top pitchers.• Depend on Sasaki’s development and health.• Possibly extend the rebuild timeline.The age gap explains the logic behind the proposal. Detroit would prioritize long-term value, while Los Angeles would focus on immediate results.The Dodgers would likely benefit first. A rotation featuring Skubal, Snell, and Yamamoto would raise their chances of another title.Detroit could come out ahead if Sasaki develops into a frontline starter while remaining cost-controlled through his prime.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Yankees potentially land $5 million Arizona Diamondbacks in a blockbuster deal to support Trent Grisham ahead of deadline Overall: The result would depend on performance and health. A championship would justify the Dodgers’ decision, while Sasaki reaching ace level would make the trade a key step in Detroit’s rebuild. Both teams could meet their goals, but on different timelines.",The Los Angeles Dodgers and Detroit Tigers could make a deal for Roki Sasaki. Skubal is a two-time Cy Young winner with a sub-2-2.00 ERA across recent seasons. Sasaki is a high-upside young arm with strong minor-league K-rates.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127850236,imgsize-71110,width-400,resizemode-4/colorado-rockies-at-los-angeles-dodgers.jpg"

Mark Aguirre recently got one of the biggest honors in his legendary basketball career. The Dallas Mavericks retired Aguirre’s No. 24 jersey to celebrate his astonishing legacy and contribution to the franchise. Just after the celebration, his long-time friend and league peer Magic Johnson sent a heartfelt note for the Mavericks legend.Los Angeles Lakers icon Johnson joined the tributes with a heartfelt post on X, revisiting their shared NBA journey. He revisited the memories of their basketball career with Aguirre as he made his name as one of the best forwards of all time.Following the announcement of Aguirre’s jersey retirement, Magic Johnson took to X to honor Mark Aguirre.“I want to congratulate Mark Aguirre on his #24 jersey retirement with the Dallas Mavericks. I met Mark and Isiah Thomas 45 years ago after they were drafted to the NBA - we formed a friendship and started training in my hometown Lansing, MI and their hometown Chicago, IL that summer. Mark was a triple threat on the basketball court and virtually unstoppable,” Johnson wrote on X.“Look at how good God is, all three of us now have our jerseys retired by the teams we played for - myself with the Lakers, Isiah with the Pistons, and now Mark with the Mavericks!,” he added.Aguirre’s jersey now hangs in the rafters of the Mavericks home ground, American Airlines Center. It has placed him alongside Dirk Nowitzki, Rolando Blackman, Derek Harper, and Brad Davis. He was the No. 1 overall pick in 1981.During the halftime ceremony, Aguirre addressed the crowd with emotion and gratitude. “Dallas, I want to thank you for letting us represent you in the great NBA. Dallas is an incredible city, and you gave us the pleasure of putting on that uniform and representing you,” he said.Aguirre spent eight seasons in Dallas. During his tenure, he earned three All-Star selections and scored 13,930 points with the franchise. He later won two NBA championships with the Detroit Pistons in 1989 and 1990, finishing a 13-year career as one of the league’s most reliable scorers of his era.","The Dallas Mavericks retired Mark Aguirre’s No. 24 jersey to celebrate his astonishing legacy and contribution to the franchise.

NEW DELHI: Some will call it ruckus. Some will call it a mess. Others will simply call it chaos. The words may change, but the situation remains the same. Cricket, once again, finds itself caught between politics, security fears and unfinished business.On Sunday, the Pakistan government confirmed that its national cricket team will take part in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026. But there was a major catch. Pakistan will not play its group match against arch-rivals India, scheduled for February 15. The announcement came through the government’s official X handle.It said, “The government ... grants approval to the Pakistan cricket team to participate in the ICC World T20 2026, however, the Pakistan Cricket Team shall not take the field in the match scheduled on 15th February 2026 against India.”The reason is not new. Pakistan has maintained a policy of not touring India due to geopolitical tensions.Because of this, Pakistan’s Group A matches have been scheduled in Sri Lanka.But refusing to play a single match in a global tournament has raised serious questions about the spirit of competition.The International Cricket Council (ICC) reacted firmly.In a statement, it said, “The ICC notes the statement that the government of Pakistan has made regarding the decision to instruct its national team to selectively participate in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026.”The governing body made its discomfort clear, adding, “This position of selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule.”While it is rare for Pakistan to be the side raising questions, history shows it has more often been the team affected by others refusing to tour. Over the years, several international sides have cancelled or declined tours to Pakistan, mostly due to security concerns.One of the earliest major setbacks came in 2008, when New Zealand cancelled a scheduled tour to Pakistan. Political instability and safety concerns made the visitors uncomfortable.That cancellation was an early sign that touring Pakistan was becoming increasingly difficult.Australia followed the same path in 2008. The Australians decided not to tour Pakistan, citing serious security concerns. Instead, parts of the series were moved to neutral venues.For Pakistan cricket, this was another blow. Hosting matches at home was becoming impossible, and fans were being denied the chance to see top teams play on their soil.After the their 2008 tour, India stopped travelling to Pakistan for bilateral cricket due to worsening political relations and security concerns, especially following the Mumbai terror attacks later that year.Since then, India and Pakistan have only faced each other in ICC tournaments or Asia Cups, mostly at neutral venues, with bilateral series remaining suspended.The situation worsened dramatically in 2009. The Sri Lankan team was attacked in Lahore while travelling to a Test match.Several people were injured, and lives were lost.That incident changed everything. After the attack, international teams stayed away from Pakistan for years.Home series were shifted to the UAE. Pakistan became a team without a home.Bangladesh also refused to tour Pakistan in 2012. Once again, security fears were the reason.While Bangladesh later returned for limited tours, the refusal added to Pakistan’s growing list of cancelled series.Even when things seemed to improve, trouble returned. In 2021, New Zealand abandoned its tour to Pakistan just minutes before the first match.The decision came after what was described as “security advice”. The sudden withdrawal shocked players, fans and officials. Stadiums were ready. Crowds were waiting. But cricket never happened.England followed soon after. In 2021, both the men’s and women’s England teams cancelled their tours of Pakistan.Player safety was cited as the main reason.For Pakistan, it was a painful reminder that trust takes years to build and seconds to lose.These incidents show a clear pattern, with major international teams declining or cancelling tours to Pakistan.Most of these decisions were linked to security concerns.The long absence of international cricket forced Pakistan to rebuild its image slowly.Over time, teams like Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, New Zealand, South Africa, and also Australia returned, helping Pakistan inch back into the global cricket map.But the situation has changed now.Pakistan once pleaded for teams to tour its country. Now, it is choosing not to play its most high-profile match in a global event. The context is different.Whether this standoff ends in compromise or conflict remains to be seen. For now, the ruckus continues. And once again, cricket waits on the sidelines.","Pakistan will not play its group match against arch-rivals India, scheduled for February 15.

Former captain Rashid Latif on Pakistan boycotting India T20 World Cup match

NEW DELHI: Former Australia batter Usman Khawaja has publicly come out in support of Pakistan spinner Usman Tariq after controversy erupted during the second T20I between Australia and Pakistan last week.The issue began when Australian all-rounder Cameron Green , after getting out to Tariq, was seen making a gesture on live television that many viewers interpreted as suggesting “chucking”.The clip quickly went viral and sparked heated debate on social media.Usman Tariq, 28, has faced scrutiny over his bowling action in the past. His action was reported twice during the Pakistan Super League , but on both occasions he was cleared after undergoing official testing. Despite this, Green’s gesture reopened the discussion, with opinions sharply divided online.Khawaja, who retired from international cricket after the fifth Ashes Test in January 2026, stepped in to defend the Pakistani spinner.Taking to Instagram Stories, he urged fans to show restraint and empathy. “There aren’t many things worse than being called a chucker in cricket. The stigma is real. The man is just doing his best and has been cleared twice.Let’s have some perspective and understanding and stop jumping to conclusions,” he wrote.Tariq himself has earlier explained the reason behind his action. He said a biological condition in his elbow makes it difficult to fully straighten his arm, which can sometimes look misleading to spectators.“There are two corners on my elbow which make it hard for me to straighten. That causes confusion for the spectators. I have given two tests at labs in Pakistan. My action was cleared,” Tariq said. He added, “I was confident about my action because I know that I am not throwing.”On the field, Tariq has delivered solid performances. In his lone T20I appearance against Australia, he picked up figures of 2/16. He is part of Pakistan’s T20 World Cup squad and is expected to play a key role when the tournament begins on February 7 against the Netherlands.Pakistan recently swept a depleted Australian side 3-0 in the T20I series, after which both teams travelled to Sri Lanka for the World Cup, leaving the controversy behind but the debate still alive.",Former Australia batter Usman Khawaja has publicly come out in support of Pakistan spinner Usman Tariq. The issue began when Australian all-rounder Cameron Green was seen making a gesture on live television that many viewers interpreted as suggesting “chucking” The clip quickly went viral and sparked heated debate on social media.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127868360,imgsize-43634,width-400,resizemode-4/cameron-greens-angry-reaction-to-usman-tariq-screengrabs.jpg"

'Cricket Or Cowardice?' Opposition MPs Lash BCCI After Pakistan Boycott India Clash In T20 World Cup

Former captain Rashid Latif on Pakistan boycotting India T20 World Cup match

Poll Do you think the ICC should impose sanctions on the PCB for the boycott of the T20 match against India? Yes, absolutely No, it's their right to boycott Maybe, depends on the circumstances

NEW DELHI: While speculation is rife about the sanctions the International Cricket Council (ICC) could potentially levy on the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) following the Pakistan government’s decision to boycott the T20 World Cup group match against India on February 15, no concrete steps have yet been taken by the global body to address the issue.According to a report by ESPNcricinfo, any discussion on sanctions would ordinarily take place at an ICC Board meeting, which comprises representatives from the 12 Full Member boards, three Associate Member representatives and the ICC chair. However, the ICC has not so far alerted its Board about any emergency meeting to deliberate on the matter. The report added that the PCB has also indicated it is unlikely to formally respond in writing to the ICC regarding the boycott or the reasons behind the government’s stance.As things stand, the status quo continues around Pakistan’s threat to skip the high-profile February 15 match in Colombo. Despite strong statements from the ICC that it will not tolerate selective participation, there is no indication yet of an imminent Board-level discussion.A Cricbuzz report also echoed similar sentiments, stating that there are 16 members on the ICC Board and, according to multiple directors spoken to by the publication, there is no information about any Board meeting being scheduled.Crucially, the report noted that the PCB has not formally written to the ICC about forfeiting the India game. At present, the only written indication of the boycott is an X post from the Government of Pakistan, which does not constitute official communication.Cricbuzz further reported that there is a growing impression that the PCB may eventually fall in line. It cited last year’s Asia Cup , when Pakistan confirmed participation in a match barely half an hour before the start after threatening to pull out through the day.The ICC, meanwhile, has reiterated its position, stating that selective participation “is difficult to reconcile” with the principles of sporting integrity, competitiveness and fairness that underpin ICC events, warning that such actions undermine the spirit and sanctity of global tournaments.",Pakistan government to boycott T20 World Cup group match against India on February 15.

NHL Trade Rumors: Artemi Panarin trade talk and Nashville Predators GM Barry Trotz step- down shake up deadline buzz,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-artemi-panarin-trade-talk-and-nashville-predators-gm-barry-trotz-step-down-shake-up-deadline-buzz/articleshow/127869832.cms,"Artemi Panarin trade talk and Nashville Predators GM Barry Trotz step- down shake up deadline buzz (Image Via Twitter)

Why are the New York Rangers exploring trade options for Artemi Panarin?

Elliotte Friedman joins NHL Now to talk Artemi Panarin latest, Maple Leafs rumors, and more

How will Nashville Predators trades be affected after Barry Trotz announces GM exits?

The NHL trade market has begun its active period because the trade deadline on March 6 approaches, while multiple prominent athletes return to the trade rumor stream. League executives watch multiple team situations because contenders need to adjust their lineups and struggling teams make their future decisions.The New York Rangers and the Nashville Predators have become the center of attention for two competing teams. The Rangers deal with a difficult situation because of their star winger, Artemi Panarin, while the Predators face a time of doubt because their front-office staff members are changing. The upcoming weeks will experience league-wide effects that result from both situations.The New York Rangers have kept Artemi Panarin out of their games because they are currently investigating trade options, according to Sportsnet's Elliotte Friedman, who spoke on the 32 Thoughts podcast. The 34-year-old winger will complete his contract, which ends on July 1, when he becomes an unrestricted free agent.Friedman disclosed that Panarin demands a contract extension before he will consider a trade. Panarin possesses complete control over his career because he holds a full no-movement clause, and he seeks what Friedman described as a “contract home run,” which has an estimated value of about $50 million.Friedman reported that the following teams showed interest in Panarin: the Washington Capitals, Los Angeles Kings, Detroit Red Wings, Florida Panthers, and San Jose Sharks. The ability to use cap space and salary retention will decide which team can complete a trade deal.Friedman announced from Nashville that Barry Trotz will leave his position as general manager but will continue to work until his successor is appointed. Trotz maintains his trade possibilities since he wants the Predators to compete for the Western Conference wild-card spot.TSN reported Trotz is open to trade talks about veteran center Ryan O'Reilly, yet no team has made a sufficient offer to start serious negotiations about the player. Friedman reported that Nashville has shown interest in trading Michael Bunting and Michael McCarron together with defenseman Nick Perbix, who will become an unrestricted free agent.The Rangers and Predators reach essential decision points when the trade deadline approaches. The contract demands from Panarin create obstacles that New York must find ways to overcome, while Nashville plans to change its front office staff, which will impact its ability to conduct player trades. The two situations will develop their outcomes within a short time frame.","The New York Rangers and the Nashville Predators have become the center of attention for two competing teams.

Travis Kelce future and free agency pressure push Kansas City Chiefs into hard roster calls

The warning signs around the Kansas City Chiefs are hard to miss right now. This is not about panic or headlines. It is about reality setting in. Injuries over the past season, mixed with tight finances, have exposed weak spots the team cannot ignore anymore. When a franchise known for control and consistency starts facing tough calls, fans naturally pay attention.At the center of everything is Patrick Mahomes . His injury scare last year reminded everyone how quickly things can change, even for elite teams. At the same time, Kansas City is staring at a long list of contracts coming to an end. With limited cap space and free agency approaching, every decision feels heavier. This offseason is less about adding stars and more about deciding who stays and who walks as 2026 gets closer.The biggest question starts with Travis Kelce. At 36, he is still producing at a high level, finishing last season with more than 800 receiving yards and five touchdowns.Still, retirement is a real option. Chiefs owner Clark Hunt has said the team is giving Kelce time and space to make his decision.“As an organization, we certainly hope that he will come back,” Hunt said. “He had another great year. He is still a key leader for us, and we believe he can still play at a high level.”Kelce has hinted that returning is something he wants, especially with Eric Bieniemy back in a familiar role. But emotion does not decide contracts.Kelce’s salary has a direct effect on how the Chiefs manage the rest of the roster. One move here changes several moves elsewhere.Beyond Kelce, uncertainty spreads quickly. Veterans like Kareem Hunt and Tyquan Thornton could test the open market. On defense, younger players such as Bryan Cook and Leo Chenal are drawing strong interest around the league.Their rising value makes keeping them harder, even though they are important to the team’s future. The Chiefs do have draft picks and some cap flexibility, but not enough to keep everyone.That means restructures, tough conversations, and possibly letting familiar faces leave. The goal remains clear.Protect Patrick Mahomes, keep the core competitive, and make sure Kansas City does not lose ground in a league that moves fast and waits for no one.","Travis Kelce, Kareem Hunt and Tyquan Thornton could test the open market.

Why Marvel may be sitting this one out

There are several reasons analysts point to for Marvel’s decision to skip Super Bowl ads in 2026:

A 30-second Super Bowl spot this year reportedly commands upwards of ~$10 million.

Both Brand New Day (July 31 release) and Avengers: Doomsday (December 18) are many months away. Marvel might prefer to unveil trailers closer to their actual release windows rather than so far in advance.

Detroit Pistons break the franchise record with the biggest win margin

Brooklyn Nets' struggles do not seem to stop



DauneThe Detroit Pistons made franchise history on February 1, 2026, after delivering a 130–77 brutal victory over the Brooklyn Nets at the Little Caesars Arena. The 53-point margin win officially stands as the franchise’s most dominant one-sided match in its history. This surpassed the organization's 52-point record set against the Boston Celtics in January 2003 where the win registered a 118–66 win.Pistons are currently leading the Eastern Conference with a 36–12 record, and are on a two game winning streak.The Pistons hosted the Nets on Sunday Night and handed the latter their second worst loss of this season after their 66-120 loss against the Knicks in late January. But for Detroit this victory was bejewelled by the newly minted All-Star pair, Jalen Duren and Cade Cunningham. Duren received news of his first-ever All-Star selection as an Eastern Conference reserve just before tip-off, and seems to have celebrated the milestone with 21 points, 10 rebounds and 3 assets against Nets while shooting 8-13 from the field and 5-6 from the free throw line.Cunningham after being 2025 selected as a reserve last season is finally making his debut as a starter this All-Star season. He ended the night with 18 points, 12 assists, 4 rebounds and 4 steals, while going 7-11 from the field and 1-4 from the three point line.Under Cunningham’s leadership, the Pistons raced to a 67–44 lead by half time fueled by Ausar Thompson half-court buzzer-beater. Detroit’s efficiency as a team was on full display as they shot 56.5% (48-of-85) from the field while committing only eight turnovers. Whereas the Nets had 23 turnovers. The Nets couldn't overcome Pistory’s defense and were restricted to a combined total of 33 points in the 3 and 4th quarter whereas the Pistons dropped 63.The Brooklyn Nets are currently at the last 3rd place in the Eastern conference with a 13–35 record. After a 7-game losing streak they finally registered a 109-99 win over the Jazz in their last meet up and hoped to finally change the momentum but Pistons didn’t agree with this idea.The Nets only managed to attempt 73 shots from the field while converting only 24 of those (32.9%) while they went 7-of-31 from the arc. Cam Thomas and rookie Drake Powell led the night as Nets highest scorer with 12 points each. For their next match up the Nets will host the West’s Lakers (29-19), whereas the Detroit Pistons also prepare to host the Denver Nuggets (33-17) on Tuesday.",Detroit Pistons beat Brooklyn Nets 130-77 at the Little Caesars Arena.

Winning at Olympics meant something very special for Joe Sakic as part of Team Canada

There are moments from Salt Lake City 2002 that remain frozen in Joe Sakic's memory. The roar of the crowd. The teammates were screaming in celebration. The breakaway goal that sealed Olympic gold and ended Canada's 50-year drought in men's hockey.The Avalanche legend scored twice and added four points total in the gold medal game victory over Team USA before being named the tournament MVP. But when asked recently about what made the Olympics special, Sakic immediately went somewhere else entirely.By the time the 2002 Winter Olympics rolled in, Sakic was already a two-time Stanley Cup champion with the Avs, having won his second championship just months before in 2001. His trophy case was already filled to the brim, including the 1996 Conn Smythe and 2001 Hart Memorial trophies.In fact, that Olympic gold wasn’t even his first international title, as in 1994 he led the national side to the 1994 IIHF World Championships, in the process ending Team Canada’s 33-year gold medal drought. But that tournament in Utah remains deeply personal to him.""Playing in an Olympic Games, you represent your country,"" Sakic told The Athletic.""You get to experience it, be part of the Olympic village, the whole Olympic atmosphere. You go check out other events on off days. You're training with the other athletes. It was just an amazing experience to be part of that.""Now serving as president of hockey operations for the Avalanche, Sakic will watch his twin superstars experience what he once did. Nathan MacKinnon and Cale Makar , along with defensive partner Devon Toews, will wear the Olympic Maple Leaf when the NHL returns to the Olympics after a 12-year absence.The timing could not be better for MacKinnon, who is having a Hart Trophy-caliber season and is the first player in the NHL to reach 40 goals. He was named MVP at the 4 Nations Face-Off last February and enters Milan riding elite form.""Everybody knows how great Nate is, what a great competitor he is,"" Sakic said. ""He's a winner. The Olympics are the showcase for the world, and the rest of the world will see how great a hockey player he is. Same for Cale.""The opportunity extends beyond individual glory. Sakic understands the importance of exposing NHL talent to a global audience that has missed Olympic hockey for more than a decade. ""The NHL hasn't been there in 12 years,"" he said.""There will be a whole new generation of kids around the world that get to see how good these players are."" The Avalanche sit atop the Central Division with a 36-8-9 record as the Olympic break approaches. Competition begins February 11 in Milan.",Joe Sakic was part of Team Canada's gold-medal winning team at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Sakic is now president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche.

Marie-Philip Poulin keeps her head up ahead of Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics 2026

One-on-one with Marie-Philip Poulin ahead of her fifth Olympic Winter Games | #CBCSports

Marie-Philip Poulin is on her way to a fifth Olympic Games, but this time the build-up feels very different. After scoring in Montreal Victoire’s 3-0 win over the Toronto Sceptres on Wednesday night, the Canadian captain is flying to Italy the very next day. In past Olympic cycles, that timing would have been unthinkable. Now, it reflects how women’s hockey has changed.The launch of the Professional Women’s Hockey League has transformed Olympic preparation for Canada and the United States. Instead of a long six-month training block, players are shifting quickly from league games to international competition. The rhythm now feels closer to the NHL model. Poulin says the routine is new, but she believes it can still be a strong way to prepare for the biggest stage.Marie-Philip Poulin’s journey is defined by clutch moments and leadership. Rising from Beauceville to Olympic glory, she became Canada’s trusted captain, scoring historic gold-medal winners and shaping the growth of women’s hockey, from national dominance to helping build the professional league era.Marie-Philip Poulin explained that in previous years, the team would never play a game the night before traveling.Still, she believes playing and training with top players every day has real value. She feels the change is different, but not negative. For her, constant high-level competition helps sharpen focus before the Olympics.Canada head coach Troy Ryan is adjusting to the change as well. In earlier Olympic cycles, he worked closely with the team over several months. This time, he will have only a few days with the full roster before Canada opens against Finland on February 5.The PWHL is also helping players from other countries close the gap. Montreal forward Natalie Mlynkova, who will represent Czechia, said training daily against elite players is a major advantage. She believes her national team has grown a lot over the past four years and wants to challenge the top nations.After Wednesday’s game, Olympic-bound players from both teams were honored on the ice. As reported by Canadian Press , Poulin said it was special to see athletes heading to represent different countries together. She noted that growing the game is a shared goal, even if players wear different jerseys at the Olympics.","Marie-Philip Poulin is on her way to a fifth Olympic Games, but this time the build-up feels very different.

On Friday, the University of Texas at Tyler announced its Athletics Hall of Fame class for 2026, and Brittany’s name stood out among the inductees.Mahomes, known during her college years as Brittany Matthews, played women’s soccer for the UT Tyler Patriots from 2013 to 2016. She finished her career second all-time in total points with 78 and goals with 31. Her senior season remains one of the best the program has seen, as she recorded 40 points and 18 goals, numbers that still stand as a benchmark.UT Tyler also announced former Director of Athletics Dr. Howard Patterson and the 2016 softball national championship team as part of the same Hall of Fame class. Brittany’s induction highlights the growing legacy of UT Tyler athletics and the athletes who helped elevate it on a national level.In a statement shared through the university, Brittany reflected on the impact of her college experience. She stated, “I’m honored to be inducted into the UT Tyler Athletics Hall of Fame. My time at UT Tyler played a huge role in shaping my life, career, and the person I am today.” She also made a point to credit longtime women’s soccer head coach Stefani Webb for her guidanceShe added, “I’m especially grateful to Coach Webb—her belief in me, leadership, and constant support had an incredible impact on my journey both on and off the field.UT Tyler will always hold a special place in my heart. I’m so thankful for the experiences and the people who were part of making my time in Tyler one I will never forget.”The celebration extended beyond Brittany herself as her mother-in-law, Randi Mahomes, shared her excitement on Instagram Stories, reposting the university’s announcement and writing, “GO @BRITTANYLYNNE!!!” with a heart emoji. Brittany is scheduled to be formally inducted into the UT Tyler Athletics Hall of Fame on March 28.",Brittany Mahomes played women’s soccer for the UT Tyler Patriots from 2013 to 2016.

"""I tried to talk him out of it"": Ex-Ravens head coach John Harbaugh admits he tried to stop Todd Monken from joining the Browns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/i-tried-to-talk-him-out-of-it-ex-ravens-head-coach-john-harbaugh-admits-he-tried-to-stop-todd-monken-from-joining-the-browns/articleshow/127858399.cms,"John Harbaugh reveals late effort to keep Todd Monken away from Browns.Image via: Getty

John Harbaugh nearly pulled Todd Monken away



The Cleveland Browns finally closed their head coaching search, but it did not come without a few nervous moments. After weeks of interviews and speculation, the team hired Todd Monken, a decision that brings optimism on offense but also reminds fans how close Cleveland came to missing out altogether. For Browns fans, the hire feels like both a relief and a gamble. Monken was never viewed as the clear favorite, and there was a real sense that his strong ties elsewhere could pull him away late in the process. Cleveland stayed aggressive, and that persistence ended up making the difference.The biggest threat to Cleveland’s plans came from John Harbaugh, who openly admitted he tried to keep Monken from leaving. Speaking to NJ Advanced Media, Harbaugh shared just how hard he pushed. ""I tried to talk him out of it... that's my job, right?""Harbaugh made it clear the situation was far from settled until the very end. ""I really thought he was coming with us, but Cleveland was in there all along,"" Harbaugh shared. ""He'd been there before in 2019 as the offensive coordinator, so they knew him and he wanted this opportunity. He got it, and I'm happy for him. I'm really proud of him, but we've got to go to work.""Those comments help explain why the Browns’ coaching search felt so uneasy from the outside. Many fans believed Monken would stay in Harbaugh’s orbit or possibly join the New York Giants.Instead, Cleveland leaned on familiarity, trusting their previous experience with Monken and selling him on the chance to run his own program. While some fans questioned the hire, Harbaugh’s words offer reassurance. Monken was a major driver behind Baltimore’s offensive success in recent seasons. In 2024, the Ravens led the league in total yards and rushing yards while ranking near the top in scoring. Even when injuries slowed the unit in 2025, the offense remained productive and competitive.That track record is why Cleveland believes Monken can bring stability to an offense that has lacked identity. His arrival also puts the spotlight on the quarterback position, especially with Shedeur Sanders now viewed as a key piece of the franchise’s future.Monken’s ability to build around Sanders and bring consistency will likely define how this hire is judged. For now, the Browns avoided a late collapse in their coaching search and landed a respected offensive mind. The uncertainty is gone. The pressure, however, is just getting started.",Cleveland Browns have hired offensive coordinator Todd Monken. John Harbaugh admitted he tried to keep Monken away from the Browns.

Anime-themed games on Roblox are everywhere right now. Some fade fast. Others stick around because they keep players coming back. Anime Paradox seems to fall into the second category. At first glance, it looks like another tower defence title with familiar anime faces and flashy attacks. But spend a little time with it, and the grind becomes obvious. Progress slows quickly, upgrades demand patience, and free rewards feel essential rather than optional for anyone hoping to stay competitive. Anime Paradox February codes let you redeem gems, stat chips, trait rerolls, and more.For players trying to build a decent team without sinking hours into farming, they matter.Below is the list of all working Anime Paradox codes in February 2026.Anime Paradox is a Roblox tower defence game where players summon and command powerful anime-style units to fend off waves of enemies and bosses as they defend a base. It blends classic tower defence mechanics with strategic placement and AI-controlled unit combat, so battles play out automatically once your units are deployed.Anime Paradox is built around summoning and upgrading units.That’s the loop. And like most Roblox games built this way, Gems sit at the centre of everything. It sounds simple, but the cost adds up quickly. Progress slows if you rely only on gameplay rewards.

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B

What Andrej Karpathy said in his post on X

I'm being accused of overhyping the [site everyone heard too much about today already]. People's reactions varied very widely, from ""how is this interesting at all"" all the way to ""it's so over"".

To add a few words beyond just memes in jest - obviously when you take a look at the activity, it's a lot of garbage - spams, scams, slop, the crypto people, highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks wild west, and a lot of it is explicitly prompted and fake posts/comments designed to convert attention into ad revenue sharing.

And this is clearly not the first the LLMs were put in a loop to talk to each other.

So yes it's a dumpster fire and I also definitely do not recommend that people run this stuff on their computers (I ran mine in an isolated computing environment and even then I was scared), it's way too much of a wild west and you are putting your computer and private data at a high risk.

That said - we have never seen this many

LLM agents

(150,000 atm!) wired up via a global, persistent, agent-first scratchpad. Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.

This brings me again to a tweet from a few days ago

""The majority of the ruff ruff is people who look at the current point and people who look at the current slope."", which imo again gets to the heart of the variance. Yes clearly it's a dumpster fire right now. But it's also true that we are well into uncharted territory with bleeding edge automations that we barely even understand individually, let alone a network there of reaching in numbers possibly into ~millions. With increasing capability and increasing proliferation, the second order effects of agent networks that share scratchpads are very difficult to anticipate. I don't really know that we are getting a coordinated ""skynet"" (thought it clearly type checks as early stages of a lot of AI takeoff scifi, the toddler version), but certainly what we are getting is a complete mess of a computer security nightmare at scale. We may also see all kinds of weird activity, e.g. viruses of text that spread across agents, a lot more gain of function on jailbreaks, weird attractor states, highly correlated botnet-like activity, delusions/ psychosis both agent and human, etc. It's very hard to tell, the experiment is running live.

TLDR sure maybe I am ""overhyping"" what you see today, but I am not overhyping large networks of autonomous LLM agents in principle, that I'm pretty sure.","Andrej Karpathy: ""We have never seen this many LLM agents wired up via a global, persistent, agent-first scratchpad"" ""I don't really know that we are getting a coordinated ""skynet"" (thought it clearly type checks as early stages of a lot of AI takeoff scifi)""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127834303,imgsize-23196,width-400,resizemode-4/openai-cofounder-andrej-karpathy.jpg"

AJMER: The Rajasthan police's Criminal Investigation Department (CID) Monday served a 'leave India' notice to two British tourists after they were found to have posted stickers advocating for Palestine and opposing Israel in public areas of Pushkar. The stickers displayed messages such as ""Free Palestine, Boycott Israel.""The incident came to light on Jan 21, when local authorities reported the presence of the stickers in various public spaces. Following this, a CID team was mobilised to investigate the matter. They concluded that placing such stickers not only violated local sensitivities but also contravened the tourists' visa regulations.According to Additional Superintendent of Police (CID) Rajesh Meena, the two individuals identified as Lewis Gabriel Dee (36) and Anueshi Emma Christine (36) arrived in India on tourist visas. ""Engaging in activities that disrespect other nations while on Indian soil is a clear violation of visa rules,"" Meena said, adding that under the Immigration and Foreigners Act of 2025, the CID issued the notice, mandating their immediate departure from India.Pushkar is known for its significant influx of Israeli tourists, with around 10,000 to 11,000 visiting annually. Currently, the town hosts nearly 2,000 Israeli visitors, many of whom frequent establishments connected to the Chabad community, making it a popular destination for this demographic.Despite the controversy, no complaints have so far been lodged by Israeli tourists regarding the stickers. Following the intervention of the CID, all offending stickers have been removed from public places, and additional checks were conducted in areas where Israeli tourists typically congregate.","Rajasthan police's Criminal Investigation Department (CID) Monday served a 'leave India' notice to two British tourists.

PlaqueBoyMax shuts down backlash with calm response





PlaqueBoyMax walked into Grammy night carrying history on his shoulders and walked out with perspective intact. The Twitch star turned recording artist did not leave with a trophy, but he left with something harder to manufacture in internet culture: composure. As online chatter brewed moments after the award was announced, he addressed the result head-on, cutting through speculation before it could spiral.The moment mattered beyond one category. His nomination alone marked a cultural shift, proving that music born on livestreams can stand beside industry veterans. For PlaqueBoyMax, the loss did not signal an ending. It reinforced how far his journey has already traveled, from chat rooms to music’s most exclusive stage.At the 68th Annual Grammy Awards on February 1, 2026, PlaqueBoyMax earned a nomination for Best Dance and Electronic Recording for “Victory Lap,” a track created with Fred again.. and Skepta. The award ultimately went to Tame Impala for “End of Summer.” Still, the nomination carried weight. “Victory Lap” was produced live on Twitch, built in real time while thousands watched every creative decision unfold.Rather than deflect or complain, PlaqueBoyMax spoke directly to his audience once the result was announced.“We lost. No rigged comment. They won fair and square,” he said on stream, setting a tone that contrasted sharply with typical post-award discourse.He continued streaming through the night, heading toward the red carpet and reframing the moment as motivation rather than defeat. “Don’t miss your next blessing cause you’re worried about the last loss. Don’t turn one L into seven.” The message resonated with fans who saw the night as proof of growth, not failure.The Grammy was inaccessible, but fame came in other places. PlaqueBoyMax was awarded the Billboard Disruptor Award at Grammy Week and it was given to him due to his contribution to the revolution in the creation and sharing of music. It was a lesson that not all goals are scored by trophies.In the case of PlaqueBoyMax, the loss marked the end of one era and the beginning of the new one.

Former captain Rashid Latif on Pakistan boycotting India T20 World Cup match

NEW DELHI: The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) on Monday said it fully agrees with the International Cricket Council’s stance on sportsmanship following Pakistan’s decision to boycott its T20 World Cup 2026 group-stage match against India, scheduled for February 15. BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla said the Indian board would refrain from making further comments until it holds formal discussions with the ICC.“ICC has issued a big statement, they have spoken about sportsmanship. We completely agree with the ICC. BCCI won’t make any comments on it until we speak with the ICC,” Shukla said, underlining India’s alignment with the global governing body’s position on the issue.Shukla’s remarks came a day after the Pakistan government announced that while it had cleared the national team’s participation in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026, it would not allow the side to take the field against India. In a post on X, the Government of Pakistan said the team “shall not take the field” for the February 15 fixture, without offering any specific reason for the decision. Pakistan will, however, play the rest of the tournament, which begins on February 7.The ICC responded firmly to the development, stating that “selective participation” runs counter to the fundamental premise of a global sporting event. In its release, the ICC said it had noted the Pakistan government’s statement and was awaiting official communication from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), but stressed that all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms as per the published schedule.The global body added that ICC tournaments are built on sporting integrity, competitiveness, consistency and fairness, and warned that selective participation undermines the spirit and sanctity of such competitions. While respecting the role of governments in national policy, the ICC said the decision was not in the interest of the global game or fans worldwide, including millions in Pakistan, and urged the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution that protects all stakeholders.India, meanwhile, head into the tournament in strong form after winning a five-match T20I series against New Zealand 4-1. The defending champions are placed in Group A alongside Pakistan, Namibia, the Netherlands and the USA, and will open their campaign on February 7.","The Board of Control for Cricket in India says it agrees with the International Cricket Council’s stance on sportsmanship.

NEW DELHI: Babar Azam etched his name into T20I history on Sunday, surpassing Virat Kohli to become the batter with the most half-centuries in the format, as Pakistan completed a dominant 3–0 series sweep of Australia in Lahore. Babar’s unbeaten 50 not only anchored a commanding batting display but also took his tally of T20I fifties to 39, moving him past Kohli’s 38 and underlining his consistency at the top level.The milestone came in a one-sided third T20I where Pakistan piled up 207 for 6 before bowling Australia out for just 96, sealing a crushing 111-run victory. It was Pakistan’s third T20I series whitewash of Australia, following similar triumphs in 2010 and 2018, and provided a timely boost ahead of the T20 World Cup, which begins on February 7 in India and Sri Lanka.Reflecting on his knock and the team’s form, Babar said the total was “more than competitive”, especially given the challenging batting conditions. “One of the key things we always talk about is reading the conditions early and then shaping the game plan accordingly,” he said. “For me, the batting position doesn’t matter as much as executing the team’s plan.” Babar also praised Saim Ayub’s intent at the top and thanked the Lahore crowd for its unwavering support.Ayub set the tone with a fluent 56 off 37 balls, while Babar played the role of stabiliser after early wickets, adding 69 runs for the third wicket. Shadab Khan’s late assault — 46 off just 19 balls — powered Pakistan through the final overs, with 70 runs coming in the last five to push the total beyond Australia’s reach.Australia’s chase never took off. Shaheen Shah Afridi struck early, removing Mitchell Marsh for one, and Mohammad Nawaz then ran through the middle order with career-best figures of 5 for 18. The visitors collapsed rapidly, managing only 96 as Pakistan’s bowlers and fielders dominated across all departments.Captain Salman Agha hailed a near-perfect series, while Marsh admitted Australia had been comprehensively outplayed.","Babar Azam surpasses Virat Kohli to become the batter with the most half- centuries in the format.

Boycott drama! 'Pakistan always make u-turns': Gavaskar takes dig amid India match row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/boycott-drama-pakistan-always-make-u-turns-gavaskar-takes-dig-amid-india-match-row/articleshow/127854991.cms,"Getty Images

Former captain Rashid Latif on Pakistan boycotting India T20 World Cup match

NEW DELHI: Sunil Gavaskar believes Pakistan’s decision to skip their high-profile ICC T20 World Cup clash against India may not be final, drawing parallels with the country’s long history of players reversing retirement calls after public pressure.Pakistan ended days of uncertainty over their participation in the tournament by confirming they would compete in the T20 World Cup starting February 7, but simultaneously triggered fresh controversy by announcing they would forfeit their group-stage match against India on February 15. The announcement came via social media from the Pakistani government, without citing any specific reason.""The government of Pakistan grants approval to the Pakistan cricket team to participate in the Twenty20 World Cup, however, the Pakistan team shall not take the field in the match scheduled on 15th February against India,"" a Pakistan government release said.The marquee event, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, runs from February 7 to March 8 and features 20 teams. The ICC has already taken note of Pakistan’s stance and warned the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) about potential long-term consequences if the decision is not revisited.Reacting to the development, Gavaskar suggested that public reaction could yet force a rethink.“Their decision could change once the world starts reacting (to their boycott decision),"" Gavaskar said on Aaj Tak.He pointed to a familiar pattern in Pakistan cricket.“There’s nothing new to this issue. Pakistani cricketers are known to make retirement U-turns, claiming their fans want them to continue.""Gavaskar feels a similar scenario could unfold in this case as well.“(Likewise) It’s possible that Pakistani fans may question their government about their decision. So, I don’t see any problem here. Pakistani cricketers have set the example – they make a U-turn 8-10 days after retiring. Something similar could happen before (February) 15,"" he added.Despite Pakistan’s current stance, India are expected to proceed as scheduled and travel to Sri Lanka for the fixture in line with tournament protocols. For a walkover to be officially awarded, the opposing team must be present for the toss.Accordingly, India T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav is set to walk out for the coin toss at Colombo’s R. Premadasa Stadium on February 15. If Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha fails to appear, the match referee will declare a walkover, handing India two points.Meanwhile, uncertainty remains over whether the PCB supports the government’s call. PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi is expected to clarify the board’s position.“What will be interesting to see is what reason the PCB gives for the government denying them permission to play India on February 15 and whether it was a unilateral government decision or the PCB was on board as well,"" a source was quoted by news agency PTI as saying.India and Pakistan have not played bilateral cricket since 2012 and only meet in multi-nation tournaments. Pakistan begin their campaign against the Netherlands in Colombo on February 7 in Group A, which also includes India, the United States and Namibia.","Sunil Gavaskar believes Pakistan’s decision to skip their high-profile ICC T20 World Cup clash against India may not be final.

Kangaroo ink and a Grand Slam dream: Carlos Alcaraz plans lasting Australian Open tribute,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/kangaroo-ink-and-a-grand-slam-dream-carlos-alcaraz-plans-lasting-australian-open-tribute/articleshow/127855502.cms,"Carlos Alcaraz poses with the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup in Melbourne.

Carlos Alcaraz is still coming to terms with what he achieved in Melbourne — and he already knows how he wants to remember it forever. Somewhere on one of his calves, a small kangaroo may soon find a permanent home.Fresh from defeating Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open final to become the youngest man at 22 to complete a career Grand Slam, Alcaraz revealed that a tattoo is on his mind. “I already know it’s going to be a kangaroo. I just don’t know the place,” he said with a smile. “I’m just thinking about the leg but I don’t know which calf, whether it will be the right or left one.”The idea feels fitting for a moment that has altered his place in tennis history.On Monday, Alcaraz posed casually with the Australian Open trophy at Melbourne’s Royal Exhibition Building, dressed in black loafers and no socks, looking far removed from the tension of Sunday night’s epic. According to local reports, celebrations were understated — pizza, beer and champagne with family back at his hotel.“I still can’t believe that I just made it,” Alcaraz wrote on social media. “A dream come true for me, a career Grand Slam.I’m enjoying this amazing moment.”That disbelief lingered even during the final moments of his four-set win over Djokovic. “Before the last point… a lot of things came to my mind,” he admitted. “I was really nervous, I was shaking almost. So once I saw the ball go out, I was like, ‘alright, I made it.’”By lifting the trophy, Alcaraz joined an exclusive club of just nine men to win all four majors, doing so younger than Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer or Djokovic. Yet he knows the sport rarely allows time to pause. “The bad part of tennis is we have tournaments week after week,” he reflected. “Sometimes you don’t realise what you’ve been doing.”",Carlos Alcaraz is the youngest man to complete a career Grand Slam.

Penta secured the victory.Stephanie Vaquer survived a brutal Philly Street Fight to retain the Women’s World Championship. Raquel Rodriguez used power to control long stretches. Vaquer found key openings at critical moments. Outside interference failed to do any harm, and Rodriguez’s power moves fell short late.

Former captain Rashid Latif on Pakistan boycotting India T20 World Cup match

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan batter Mohammad Yousuf has strongly reacted to the Pakistan government’s decision to boycott the T20 World Cup league match against India.He called the move a matter of principle and blamed politics for hurting cricket.Sharing his views on X, Yousuf wrote, ""Pakistan vs India is one of the greatest sporting events in the world, yet it continues to suffer from political interference that damages the spirit and pride of the game. In such an unfair environment, choosing not to play becomes an act of principle — an eye-for-an-eye response to protect the integrity of the Sports.""The controversy began after the Pakistan government announced on Sunday that the national team will not play India in their group match in Colombo on February 15.No official reason was given for the decision. Earlier, PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi had warned of strong action after Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland in the tournament lineup.The International Cricket Council reacted quickly. The ICC expressed concern over the long-term impact of such a decision on Pakistan cricket.In a statement, the ICC said, “ICC hopes PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of.”Another ICC statement added that selective participation goes against the spirit of global events.It said, “This position of selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule.”Sources have suggested that the ICC could take strict action if Pakistan stick to its stand.This may include removal from the World Cup or future ICC events.The Pakistan government also confirmed the decision in an official post, saying, “The Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan grants approval to the Pakistan cricket team to participate in the ICC World T20 2026, however, the Pakistan Cricket Team shall not take the field in the match scheduled on 15th February 2026 against India.”If the match is forfeited, Pakistan will lose two points and suffer a net run-rate loss.",Former Pakistan batter Mohammad Yousuf has strongly reacted to the Pakistan government’s decision to boycott the T20 World Cup league match against India.
