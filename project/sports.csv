India women's cricketers get a grand welcome in their respective hometowns

Bengal's first World Cup-winning cricketer Richa Ghosh received multiple honors at Eden Gardens on Saturday. The ceremony brought together cricket legends Sourav Ganguly, Jhulan Goswami , and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.The 22-year-old wicketkeeper-batter from Siliguri received the Banga Bhushan award and was appointed Deputy Superintendent of Police. The West Bengal government also presented her with a gold chain.The Cricket Association of Bengal awarded her Rs 34 lakh, calculated at Rs 1 lakh for each run she scored in the final match.""The World Cup triumph is a special, special win and only Richa can tell us what that feels like. Your career has just begun. Women's cricket will grow massively in the next four to six years, and there will be more opportunities,"" Ganguly said.""I hope you make the most of them and one day, like Jhulan, we'll stand here and say: 'Richa -- India captain'. You're just 22... You've got time. All blessings and heartiest congratulations.""Richa's contribution to India's victory was significant. Batting at number 7, she scored 34 runs off 24 balls, including three fours and two sixes in the final against South Africa.India posted 298 for 7, while South Africa managed only 246 runs.""The role she plays batting lower down the order is very difficult. You get fewer balls but you have to score the most runs. People may remember Jemimah's 127 not out or Harmanpreet's 89 in the semifinals, but Richa's strike rate of 130-plus made the difference. What she's done so simply is equal in value to Smriti or Harman.""Jhulan Goswami, India's highest ODI wicket-taker, discovered Richa during Bengal's 2013 district trials in Siliguri.""In 2013, we were struggling so I suggested for trials in districts. During the under-15 trials in Siliguri, I spotted Richa. I requested the officials to support her. She was so talented at that age, I'd never seen that before. I wanted her to be in the senior team, and the rest is history. Finally, tor haath diye amader World Cup ta aslo — onek onek dhonnobad.""Richa expressed her gratitude and amazement at the reception she received.""It feels like a dream -- the way I was received in Siliguri and now here. It's like living a dream.""She shared insights about her training methods.""When I bat at open nets, I set a target — how many runs I can score in a specific time. That helps me in big matches. They always praise my sixes, so I try for more big hits. It's about choosing the right ball.""Richa discussed her approach to handling pressure.""I like to take pressure, but I keep myself calm by watching movies and staying away from home. Barite sob theke samne thakbe.""The Banga Bhushan and Banga Bibhushan awards are West Bengal's highest civilian honors.

'Your Future Is Being Stolen': Rahul Gandhi's Bold Message to India's Gen Z For Democratic Change

NEW DELHI: Jan Suraaj chief Prashant Kishor on Sunday dismissed the ""notion"" that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi holds any meaningful sway over Gen Z voters in Bihar.He further criticised Gandhi's limited engagement and understanding of the state.In an exclusive interview with news agency ANI, Kishor said, “How much knowledge does Rahul Gandhi have here? Rahul Gandhi comes here, roams around, does a couple of show bites and then he is gone.”He questioned the idea that Bihar’s youth would rally behind Gandhi’s calls on issues like “vote theft” or protecting democracy.“When the people of Bihar are not listening to him (Rahul Gandhi), then why would Gen Z listen to him? Gen Z is not a homogeneous group in Bihar who acts on someone’s call or on the basis of their assessment,” he said.Referring to recent protests in Nepal that led to the fall of the former PM KP Sharma Oli's government, Kishor said some people were “getting excited” after the Gen Z movement there but stressed that Bihar’s political landscape is different.“Bihar is a very political place. It is not like Bangalore. People won’t have clothes, food, jobs, but there is a lot of political optimism among the people here. And the result of this is that people are leaving their work and doing politics day and night.But I don’t think there is going to be a revolution by someone’s call here,” he said.Kishor underlined that youth play an important role in Bihar’s politics, primarily because of unemployment and migration.“The youth between 20 and 30 years, who are facing a bit of unemployment. Not a bit, I mean he is facing a lot of difficulties due to unemployment. They are forced to go out, enduring the tough life there. That is definitely a big factor in Bihar. You can call him Gen Z, you can call him a youth, you can call him a millennial. This is the terminology,” he said.Commenting on the Congress party’s role in the upcoming elections, Jan Suraaj founder said it remains marginal.“I had also said at that time that Congress is a follower of RJD in Bihar. They are a big party of the country. They are the leaders of the opposition in the country. They belong to the Gandhi family. So it is natural that the media will cover them,” he said.“But from the point of view of Bihar, there is no presence of Congress. Congress is not a factor. There is no discussion of Congress. What is Congress doing? Congress has little effect. Politically, you can see it in Seemanchal. In Seemanchal, I think that even today, the Muslims are more tilted towards Congress than RJD,” he added.Hours before the first phase of polling, Gandhi had appealed to young voters, particularly Gen Z to come forward and “save democracy through truth and non-violence.”In a video message posted on X, Congress leader addressed “Gen Z brothers and sisters” from Bihar, urging them to turn out in large numbers and vote responsibly.“My young friends from Bihar, my Gen-Z brothers and sisters — tomorrow is not just a day for voting, but a day to decide the direction of Bihar’s future,” he said.Referring to his repeated “vote theft” allegations, Gandhi added, “You’ve seen how in Haryana, a nefarious game of vote theft was played. In Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh — everywhere, these people have tried to suppress the people’s voice. Now their eyes are on Bihar, on your votes, on your future.”He urged voters to “stay vigilant against every conspiracy” and to “walk the path of truth and non-violence” while supporting Mahagathbandhan candidates in their constituencies.The first phase of the Bihar assembly elections concluded peacefully on Thursday with a record voter turnout, while the remaining 122 constituencies will vote in the second phase on November 11. Counting will take place on November 14.","Jan Suraaj chief Prashant Kishor questions Rahul Gandhi's understanding of Bihar.

Burned but not broken: Acid attack survivors share stories of courage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/burned-but-not-broken-acid-attack-survivors-share-stories-of-courage/articleshow/125211622.cms,"Shaheen’s (left) foundation organised ‘From Scars to Strength’ on Sunday

Acid test: Free surgery should be a right, not a fight

NEW DELHI: Weekends at Chhatarpur are usually all about wedding shopping and the accompanying glitter. On Sunday though, in a quiet hall away from the chaos and the crowd, the air felt gentler. Women in soft lehengas and pastel anarkalis sat together, dressed not for a wedding, but for themselves.From afar, it looked like any friendly gathering or a rehearsal for a fashion show. Then the scars came into view. The laughter didn't stop. The shoulders didn't drop.Among them stood Reshma Ansari and Suniti Karmakar, smiling as they posed for a photo. ""We stopped going to weddings,"" said Reshma, who survived an acid attack in 1997. ""People stare before they even say hello."" Suniti, attacked in 2010, nodded. ""You start feeling like the room isn't yours.""A few steps away stood Haseena, still wearing a mask. She was attacked a year and a half ago and had come to Delhi for surgery.Her 13-year-old daughter, also a survivor, played nearby. Reshma walked up to her and reassured her: ""You don't have to hide here."" Haseena's eyes filled as she slowly lifted her mask.For the first time in months, she wasn't hiding.That quiet courage was what From Scars to Strength, a symposium by Brave Souls Foundation led by Shaheen Malik, was all about - a day for acid attack survivors to meet, celebrate and remind the world that scars aren't shame; they are stories of survival.Some had lost an eye, some an ear, others bore quiet scars on their hands - but every story in that room had a heartbeat.For instance, Meena, who was attacked in 2023 and is recovering from 14 surgeries, let her song speak for her. ""Zindagi ke safar mein guzar jaate hain jo makam..."" Her voice trembled at first, then steadied, each lyric carrying what words could not - the pain, the nostalgia, the stubborn hope. When she reached the words ""woh pal bhi kya pal the..."", the hall fell silent, a shared quiet among those who understood loss too well.Male survivors, too often invisible, sat among them. Shahnawaz, attacked in 1997, had travelled from Meerut. ""The pain is the same for men - the shame, the struggle, the silence,"" he said. Neeraj, attacked in 2010, nodded, saying, ""Even finding a job becomes a fight. People look away."" Their stories were quieter, but no less powerful - reminders that acid doesn't discriminate, but empathy often does.And then, there was a story that didn't need words - of Reshma Khatun and Ashok. Their presence alone said it all: love has no bias, no boundaries, and no fear of scars. In 2014, acid changed Reshma's life. It took away her vision; today, she can see only faint shadows with one eye. But it couldn't take away her will. Years later, a Facebook message from Ashok changed everything again. What began as shy hellos turned into long chats, shared laughter, and quiet understanding.When they finally met on a video call, he didn't flinch. He just smiled and promised to stay. ""He saw me, not my face,"" Reshma said softly.In 2019, they married, an interfaith union that now includes their little son. Wherever she goes, whether for events or small errands, Ashok is always beside her, his hand steady on hers, guiding her steps. ""It was never about looks,"" he said simply. ""It's the heart that matters.""Between songs, hugs, and stories, the event also turned the spotlight on what still needs fixing. Actor Sharmila Tagore, the chief guest, spoke softly but firmly: ""When I met Shaheen, she was still behind her pardah. Even now, her pain lingers. Quick redressal is essential - and the sale of acid must stop completely.""A panel, which included Justice Dharmesh Sharma (Retd), AAP's Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh and retired public prosecutor Neelam Narang, discussed key issues facing survivors - from faster compensation and free surgeries to greater accountability. ""Free surgery in every hospital should be a right, not a fight,"" said Singh, vowing to raise the matter in Parliament.Under the Delhi Victim Compensation Scheme, payouts have swung wildly - from Rs 7.6 lakh for six victims in 2014 to Rs 79.5 lakh for 27 survivors in 2024. Till July 2025, Rs 40 lakh was disbursed among 14 survivors. For most, that doesn't even cover the first few surgeries.Shaheen, who leads Brave Souls Foundation, said, ""The average recovery cost easily crosses Rs 20 lakh,"" she said. ""And survivors still get money in instalments - after pleading for every rupee.""Real rehabilitation, she added, is not about one cheque. It's about long-term medical care, therapy, free medicines, disability certificates without red tape, and mental health support. ""These aren't luxuries,"" she said firmly. ""They are basic rights - for people whose lives were burned but not broken.""As the hall began to empty, the survivors gathered again - arms around each other, smiles lighting up scarred faces. In that glow, there was no trace of pity, only power. They weren't hiding their scars anymore. They were owning them - like badges of survival, like light.","From Scars to Strength was a symposium by Brave Souls Foundation led by Shaheen Malik.

NEW DELHI: A light-hearted moment from the Bihar poll campaign has captured attention online, as a video of leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi chatting with a little boy went viral. The child asked the 55-year-old Congress leader the question many have wondered about: “When are you getting married?”As the video had no audio, the boy informed that Gandhi replied that he’d tie the knot “once he’s done with his job.”“I asked Rahul Gandhi when he would get married, and he replied that he will marry once his work is done,” the boy said.Gandhi keeps getting questions regarding his marriage with the last one being during a Diwali stop at the Ghantewala sweet shop in Old Delhi when he tried his hand at making traditional sweets. The shop owner Sushant Jain had playfully wished to see Gandhi married soon, and to bag the order for the wedding sweets too.""All of India is talking about him being the most eligible bachelor. I said, 'Rahul ji, please get married soon -- we're waiting, so that we can get the order for your wedding sweets too,'"" he had said.Meanwhile, Bihar set a new record in the first phase of its legislative elections, registering a highest-ever voter turnout of 64.7 percent across 121 assembly constituencies in 18 districts — slightly surpassing the previous peak of 64.6 percent recorded during the 1998 Lok Sabha polls.",A video of opposition leader Rahul Gandhi chatting with a little boy has gone viral.

Tom Brady reacts publicly to Drew Brees replacing Mark Sanchez at FOX Sports

Drew Brees steps into Mark Sanchez’s former role as Brady highlights the accuracy conversation





Tom Brady reacted to Drew Brees taking over Mark Sanchez’s spot at FOX Sports, and the response instantly pulled attention across the NFL . The move puts two of the most accurate quarterbacks in league history under the same network roof, and Brady made sure the focus keyword, Tom Brady, was in the first line as he set the tone with his usual dry-fire humor.Brees’ hiring comes as FOX Sports officially parted ways with Sanchez following his ongoing felony case. The network announced Brees’ arrival with a highlight reel, and Brady immediately jumped in with a punchy, public welcome. The two quarterbacks now headline a reshaped analyst lineup built on production, accuracy and career-long credibility.Tom Brady did not hold back when FOX Sports confirmed Drew Brees as the new analyst replacing Mark Sanchez. Brady shared FOX Sports’ announcement clip and attached a line that instantly made waves across social media. His message read:“And just like that I become the 3rd most accurate QB at @FOXSports (Terry still has both of us beat) Welcome to the family @drewbrees!!!”The accuracy comment was rooted in fact. Drew Brees retired with a 67.7% completion rate, which places him third all time behind Joe Burrow and Tua Tagovailoa. Brady’s reaction added a layer of self-awareness and competition that people rarely hear from him, and it worked because the numbers back all of it.Brees is stepping into a major role. FOX Sports expects him to call games with Adam Amin starting next week and remain on the team through at least 2026. He already has experience across NBC Sports, ESPN’s “First Take” and Netflix’s international game coverage. FOX Sports is betting on a quarterback who built his legacy on precision, control and film-room mastery.Mark Sanchez’s exit shifts the balance of FOX’s broadcast team. According to multiple outlets, FOX Sports cut ties as Sanchez faces a felony battery case in Indiana. He pleaded not guilty, and the legal process is ongoing. FOX Sports confirmed to The Athletic that he is no longer part of the broadcast crew. The decision opened the lane for Brees, and Brady’s reaction shows that the quarterback fraternity is already treating the move as a major shakeup.Brady and Brees owned their era, stacking numbers that still look unreal. Tom Brady started 333 games, threw for 89,214 yards, 649 touchdowns, and finished with a 251-82 record, putting him first all time in passing yards, passing touchdowns, completions, attempts, and starts. Drew Brees wasn’t far behind, going 172-114 with 80,358 yards and 571 touchdowns while completing nearly 68% of his throws. He ranks second in league history in completions, attempts, yards, and touchdowns, sitting right behind Brady in every major category.Drew Brees enters FOX Sports at a moment when the network needs stability, professionalism and credibility in the booth. He retired with 80,358 passing yards, 571 touchdowns and one of the most efficient careers the league has ever seen. The numbers place him behind Tom Brady in yardage and touchdowns but ahead of almost everyone in accuracy and consistency.Brees shared his own statement following the announcement. He said:“I appreciate the opportunity FOX has given me in the booth and with their team. I hope my passion for this game is reflected in the knowledge and insight I provide to fans each Sunday.”His arrival is rooted in a reputation built across two decades with the New Orleans Saints and the San Diego Chargers. Former teammate Darren Sproles described Brees’ leadership on “Up & Adams,” saying:“For him, to mention me out of all the weapons that he had. That is very special. With Drew, you didn’t have to think like that on the field. Drew always put you in the right place at the right time.”These details matter because FOX Sports is replacing a quarterback known for chaotic storylines with one known for structure and precision. Mark Sanchez’s legal issues removed him from the booth as he deals with felony battery and multiple misdemeanor charges after an incident in Indianapolis earlier this year. He had already been sidelined after being stabbed and arrested on the same night. He pleaded not guilty and awaits further proceedings.Drew Brees offers none of the uncertainty, and that is part of the reason FOX Sports moved quickly. He already worked on NBC’s Notre Dame broadcasts, contributed to Football Night in America, and appeared on “First Take” before signing with FOX Sports. His presence turns the broadcast team into a high-accuracy, high-football-IQ group, which pairs naturally with the tone Tom Brady wants to bring to television.Brady himself is walking into his own broadcast era. He will be in the booth this Sunday covering the Detroit Lions and Washington Commanders, while the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers face each other in one of the biggest matchups of the weekend. Brady refused to pick a side in the game, saying:“Just... don’t ask me to pick any sides here.”","Tom Brady welcomed Drew Brees to FOX Sports after Mark Sanchez’s exit.

Klay Thompson apologizes to Megan Thee Stallion after airport mishap





Megan Thee Stallion on her relationship with Klay Thompson





Klay Thompson might be known for his calm demeanor on the court, but off it, the Dallas Mavericks star recently showed his softer side. After arriving late to pick up his girlfriend, rapper Megan Thee Stallion , from the airport, Thompson went viral for his heartfelt apology and his remorse. The clip, shared by Megan on social media, captured the NBA star trying to make amends with flowers in hand and genuine regret on his face.The moment quickly became a talking point among fans, who couldn’t get enough of the couple’s chemistry and Thompson’s down-to-earth approach. It also comes at a time when both are thriving in their respective careers, with Thompson beginning his new season in Dallas and Megan releasing new music inspired by their relationship.In the video posted online, Klay Thompson can be seen handing Megan a bouquet while apologizing repeatedly for showing up late. “Roses for my boo,” he said while driving her home. “I’m sorry I was late, babe. Damn it. I’m sorry. I thought I timed it well. Ah, just sorry. There’s no excuse.”Fans immediately flooded social media with amused and affectionate reactions, praising Thompson’s gesture as “adorably human.” The incident added another viral moment to their growing list of public appearances since confirming their romance earlier this year.Over the summer, the couple enjoyed a fishing trip that gave fans a glimpse into their playful dynamic. “So today, Klay is taking me on another adventure and we’re going fishing,” Megan said at the time. Thompson responded lovingly: “I got my queen on board, of course I feel cool. I’m the coolest guy in this harbor!”For Megan, whose real name is Megan Jovon Ruth Pete, the relationship marks a new chapter. “This is my first relationship where I’ve ever been with somebody who’s genuinely a nice person, and he makes me genuinely happy,” she told Page Six.“I just never dated somebody like him before and I’m just grateful that he’s here by my side and he feels the same way about me.”Despite occasional public skepticism — even from personalities like Shaquille O’Neal, who jokingly doubted their relationship on The Big Podcast — fans have embraced the pair’s authenticity. O’Neal later called Megan “athletic, so beautiful, and so gorgeous,” insisting his remarks were lighthearted.For now, Thompson and Megan seem unfazed by outside opinions. Their recent viral moment only serves to extend a genuine connection between two stars from different worlds. The duo has been very active on social media to share their personal moments of joy and love. Megan has over 32.7 million followers on Instagram, while Thomson has 16.8 million fans on the platform.Stallion is fully embracing her lover girl era — and fans are loving it.

Brittany Mahomes’ new advisory board appointment adds a cultural shift moment to a growing NWSL era





More coverage on NFL:

The Kansas City Chiefs are in the middle of a painful reset week and not just because Patrick Mahomes is coming off a rare touchdown-less performance. Kansas City’s QB1 is regrouping, refocusing, and trying to recalibrate an offense that suddenly looks uneven.But while conversations around the Chiefs have been dominated by red-zone issues, missed opportunities, and Mahomes admitting “I got to be better,” there’s another Mahomes headline hitting at the exact same time, one that has nothing to do with football mechanics. Brittany Mahomes isn’t just the loudest supporter inside the CPKC suites anymore. She’s officially stepping into the boardroom of women’s sports and Patrick had no words. Just a silent repost..The Kansas City Current’s rise has already been one of the most impressive business stories in American women’s sports. Now, Brittany Mahomes is moving from co-owner to shaper of direction. The NWSL confirmed she has joined a star-loaded advisory board of “athletes, investors, and cultural icons who will focus on marketing, branding, fan engagement, and player initiatives starting in 2026.”Jessica Berman said the group “will serve as mentors and cultural connectors while helping expand the league’s reach through partnerships and appearances. ”Names like Magic Johnson, Sue Bird, Ken Griffey Jr., Eli Manning, Aly Raisman, Chris Paul and more are in the same room. That is not just optics, that is a statement. Patrick posted the announcement to his Instagram stories with zero caption, letting the moment speak for itself.Kansas City is now a two-sport dynasty incubator, one on the field, one in expansion mode. CPKC Stadium changed the landscape. A $52 million facilities expansion is in motion. The Current already own a league-leading revenue mark.Mahomes said it himself about the Chiefs: “You got to kind of learn from it fast.” Brittany is applying that philosophy, system-wide.","Brittany Mahomes has joined a star-studded advisory board for the NWSL, focusing on marketing, branding, and player initiatives starting in 2026.

"Gisele Bündchen implied that prioritizing Tom Brady for years took a personal toll: “When you love someone, you don’t put them in jail”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/gisele-bndchen-implied-that-prioritizing-tom-brady-for-years-took-a-personal-toll-when-you-love-someone-you-dont-put-them-in-jail/articleshow/125033119.cms,"Supermodel Gisele Bündchen, in a candid interview, shared insights into her marriage with Tom Brady, describing their split as a 'death and rebirth.' She detailed her journey of shifting from supporting her partner's career to rediscovering her own dreams and defining personal success. Bündchen emphasizes her graciousness towards Brady, highlighting her focus on authenticity and fulfillment in her new chapter.

The shifting balance between support, career and self-fulfillment

Moving from high-stakes partnership to reinventing life on her own terms





In her March 2023 interview with Vanity Fair, supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, how their lives evolved, and what she discovered in the space that followed. While details of their split had played out in headlines, Bündchen offered fresh context and a more nuanced perspective.Gisele Bündchen admitted that “It’s like a death and a rebirth,” and described her own shift from supporting a partner’s career to rediscovering her personal dreams. Her reflections reveal not just a high-profile breakup, but a woman reclaiming her voice and defining success on her own terms.When Gisele Bündchen met Tom Brady at age 26, she said she was “so ready” for family and partnership. Traditionally one of the world’s highest-earning models, she gradually scaled back her runway work after 2015 to support the family life they were building..Gisele Bündchen describes relocating to Tampa without ever having lived there before: “When we moved to Tampa, I actually had never been there before. I just arrived and that was my life.” Yet despite her enormous success, much of the public narrative painted her as “against football” or overshadowed by Brady’s career, a portrayal she calls “very hurtful” and “the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”Bündchen underscores that marriage didn’t unravel overnight. “That takes years to happen.” As she puts it: “Sometimes you grow together; sometimes you grow apart … When you love someone, you don’t put them in a jail and say, ‘You have to live this life.’ You set them free to be who they are.”Gisele Bündchen's message: supporting someone doesn’t mean losing yourself, and that truth became clearer to her as her kids grew and her dreams quietly changed.Today, Gisele Bündchen speaks of her next act in Costa Rica, building a home, raising her children, and exploring wellness and nature far from red carpets. She asserts, “I have my own dreams.”While Tom Brady continued his historic career, Bündchen’s focus shifted inward. She embraced spiritual practices, daily rituals, and the idea that success is not just professional acclaim but authenticity and fulfillment. She says the breakup felt like both a loss and a liberation, “I believed in fairy tales when I was a kid. I think it’s beautiful to believe in that.”Bündchen's reflection on Brady is remarkably gracious. “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever … If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him.”In doing so, Bündchen rejects reductive headlines and stereotypes, choosing instead to present a fuller picture of love, change and self-discovery. As she said, “What’s been said is one piece of a much bigger puzzle. It’s not so black and white.”In the end, this isn’t a story solely of one of fashion’s biggest icons stepping aside. It’s the story of a woman stepping forward, redefining what a chapter ends and a new one begins.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s post divorce evolution raises question: did Tom Brady underestimate what letting her go would cost him?",Supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady.

How Michael Irvin discovered his wife’s early-onset Alzheimer’s

“We recognized some things were going wrong with her about ten years ago… We thought it was menopause… We buried my mom. She had Alzheimer’s. My mother-in-law was living with us because she had Alzheimer’s. And now we thought my wife was going through menopause at 49 because she’s coming at 50.”

“It’s quite hard to take care of someone 24 hours a day… I have to keep a 24-hour nurse with her all the time.”

“If anyone has earned the right to stay in her house, MY WIFE HAS!!! … That I shall honour. No matter what it takes.”

His emotional revelation gives fans a glimpse of the human side of a public figure often celebrated for his athletic prowess.Talking candidly, Irvin shared:This initial uncertainty highlights how subtle the early signs ofcan be especially in someone so young.

Stephen Curry’s Injury Report vs Indiana Pacers (November 9, 2025)

Golden State Warriors’ Struggles Without Curry

Other Key Injuries and Warriors vs Pacers Game Details (November 9, 2025)

Why This Game Matters for Both Teams

fans are holding their breath ahead of tonight’s matchup against the Indiana Pacers, as franchise cornerstonedue to illness. The two-time MVP has missed the last two contests, both of which ended in losses for the Warriors. With the team now sitting at an even 5-5 record, his return could be a crucial turning point early in the 2025-26 NBA season.The Golden State Warriors’ recent struggles without Curry have been evident. Their offensive rhythm has faltered, defensive consistency has waned, and morale has dipped. As the team prepares for a tough stretch of games, a healthy Curry back in the lineup could provide the spark they desperately need. Head coach Steve Kerr has remained cautiously optimistic, hinting that the final decision on Curry’s participation will be made closer to tip-off.Stephen Curry’s illness appeared suddenly, forcing him to sit out consecutive games against the Sacramento Kings and Denver Nuggets. Reports suggest his symptoms worsened before those matchups, leading the Warriors’ medical staff to prioritize his full recovery over a rushed return.Although specific details about the illness haven’t been disclosed, it was severe enough to affect his conditioning and overall readiness.Coach Kerr has reiterated that the team will not take unnecessary risks with their superstar’s health. Should Curry return tonight, his playing time is expected to be limited as part of a gradual reintegration plan. The Golden State Warriors aim to ensure that their leader is fully recovered before ramping up his minutes, especially with a challenging road trip looming.Without their star point guard, Golden State’s offense has lacked fluidity. The team has committed more turnovers, suffered from poor spacing, and failed to capitalize on open looks. These offensive woes, combined with defensive lapses, have resulted in back-to-back defeats that turned a strong 4-1 start into a .500 record.Veteran forward Draymond Green has publicly addressed the team’s struggles, citing both defensive breakdowns and lack of composure during key moments. Jimmy Butler, now serving as the Warriors’ secondary scorer, has shouldered a heavier offensive load but has struggled to compensate for Curry’s elite shooting and playmaking.Stephen Curry isn’t the only concern for the Golden State Warriors heading into the Pacers matchup. Veteran center Al Horford is also questionable with a left foot strain. Horford missed the previous game and has been inconsistent since joining the team this offseason, shooting below 30 percent from the field while battling recurring foot discomfort.Tonight’s game against the Indiana Pacers tips off at 8:30 PM Eastern (5:30 PM Pacific) at the Chase Center in San Francisco. Fans can watch the live broadcast on Amazon Prime Video, NBA League Pass, and Fubo TV.This contest holds added significance beyond Curry’s potential return. The Golden State Warriors lost to Indiana earlier in the season and are eager for redemption on home court. A win tonight could not only help stabilize their record but also restore confidence across the roster. With both Curry and Horford’s availability still uncertain, all eyes will be on the pregame updates to see if the Warriors’ leader finally makes his long-awaited return.Also read: Golden State Warriors vs Indiana Pacers regular season game: Full Injury report, who’s out, and more (November 9, 2025) If Stephen Curry suits up, even in limited minutes, his presence alone could rejuvenate a struggling Warriors squad desperate to regain its championship rhythm.","Stephen Curry remains listed as questionable for tonight's game against the Indiana Pacers.

Swifties decode Joe Alwyn’s clover dish photo — claiming it was a quiet nod to Taylor Swift as she prepares for her wedding with Travis Kelce,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/swifties-decode-joe-alwyns-clover-dish-photo-claiming-it-was-a-quiet-nod-to-taylor-swift-as-she-prepares-for-her-wedding-with-travis-kelce/articleshow/125158940.cms,"Swifties believe Joe Alwyn’s Instagram photo featuring a heart-shaped dish with a four-leaf clover was a subtle show of support for Taylor Swift’s $360 million masters buyback deal. Fans linked the clover to Shamrock Capital, interpreting the image as a quiet nod to Swift’s victory, even though Alwyn never addressed it publicly.

Taylor Swift fans once believed Joe’s clover photo was an indirect nod to the buyback and Shamrock Capital

More coverage on NFL:

Back in early 2025, before Taylor Swift’s $360 million masters buyback became one of the most celebrated business wins in modern pop music history, fans were already looking for clues, at times in places even the artist’s closest circle never acknowledged. One of those viral rabbit holes traced back to Joe Alwyn.Months before Taylor Swift’s ownership announcement shook the industry, Alwyn shared an Instagram carousel that most people swiped right through, until Swifties saw the fifth slide. A heart-shaped porcelain dish stamped with a four-leaf clover became suddenly more than décor. In hindsight, Swift fans believed it was a quiet thumbs-up and now that speculation has resurfaced again.The original theory sparked because the clover, to Swift’s online detectives, aligned too easily with the Shamrock Capital narrative, the firm Swift bought her music back from. In fan logic, it wasn’t just springtime imagery or St. Patrick’s Day aesthetics. It was support. It was a symbol. And it was emotional closure for a relationship that ran parallel to Swift’s fight for control over her catalogue.Joe Alwyn didn’t say a word publicly about Swift’s historic business win.He didn’t post a caption about empowerment, ownership, or old battles finally ending. But Page Six amplified the fan narrative anyway, noting that Swifties genuinely believed “He’s happy for her.”Now, months later, this theory is trending again, not because anything new has happened, but because Swift’s masters deal is being revisited as a major turning point in celebrity-led IP ownership. And when pop culture cycles back, so do the symbols fans once obsessed over.It’s proof of how deeply Swift fans archive and how long they hold onto meaning. Even when the moment has passed. Old theories eventually become nostalgia. And in this case, the clover moment is now less about Joe and more about how Swift fans refuse to forget their favorite breadcrumbs.","Taylor Swift fans once believed Joe Alwyn’s clover photo was an indirect nod to the buyback and Shamrock Capital.

Lenny Wilkens’ brilliance defined eras of NBA greatness



Lenny Wilkens’ legacy beyond wins and titles



The basketball world is mourning the loss of Lenny Wilkens, a trailblazing figure who shaped generations of the sport both on and off the court. The Hall of Famer, remembered for his graceful playmaking and calm authority as a coach, passed away Sunday at the age of 88. Wilkens, a nine-time NBA All-Star and one of the few individuals enshrined in the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame as both player and coach, leaves behind a career that spanned over four decades of influence.A Brooklyn native who rose from humble beginnings, Wilkens’ journey from Providence College standout to NBA champion coach remains one of basketball’s most inspiring success stories. His 1,332 career wins rank third all-time, trailing only Gregg Popovich and Don Nelson, while his 2,487 games coached remain an NBA record. From the court to the sideline, Wilkens carried himself with quiet confidence, earning respect for his intelligence, poise, and unwavering integrity.Lenny Wilkens’ basketball career was remarkable in both scope and substance. Drafted sixth overall by the St. Louis Hawks in 1960, he quickly proved himself a cerebral point guard, leading the league in assists twice and earning nine All-Star nods during his 15-year career.Standing just over six feet tall, Wilkens never relied on athletic flash — instead, his mastery of timing, positioning, and teamwork made him one of the smartest floor generals of his time.His playing days transitioned seamlessly into coaching. Wilkens became a rare player-coach with the Seattle SuperSonics and later the Portland Trail Blazers, before fully committing to coaching. He famously guided the SuperSonics to their first and only NBA championship in 1979. It was a triumph that immortalized him in Seattle sports history. “I know what young players are going through,” Wilkens once said. “I understand their backgrounds. I didn’t come from anything either, so I’ve been there.”While Wilkens’ basketball résumé is unmatched, his influence extended well beyond the game. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver called him “one of the game’s most respected ambassadors,” noting that “Lenny Wilkens represented the very best of the NBA — as a Hall of Fame player, Hall of Fame coach, and one of the game's most respected ambassadors.”He was not only a two-time Olympic gold medalist — as an assistant on the 1992 Dream Team and head coach of the 1996 U.S. men’s squad — but also a pillar of his community. His Lenny Wilkens Foundation raised millions for youth programs and health initiatives in Seattle, the city where a statue now stands in his honor.Wilkens’ passing marks the end of an era, but his spirit endures in the countless players, coaches, and fans he inspired. As Steve Kerr, who played under him in Cleveland, recalled, “What I remember most is just the dignity. He was such a dignified human being and a great leader through quiet confidence.” Lenny Wilkens elevated everyone around him.Also Read: Late NBA legend Kobe Bryant's wife Vanessa Bryant shares heartfelt two-word message honoring daughter Natalia Bryant","Lenny Wilkens was a nine-time NBA All-Star and a two-time Olympic gold medalist.

Sidney Crosby’s frustration grows as Penguins’ offense sputters



More NHL coverage

The Pittsburgh Penguins fell 2-1 in a shootout to the New Jersey Devils in a tense divisional battle on Saturday night, and captain Sidney Crosby’s emotions afterward said it all. Despite a strong outing in net by Arturs Silovs, the Penguins’ offense couldn’t capitalize on their opportunities, leaving Crosby visibly frustrated by the team’s inability to find the back of the net. It wasn’t a lack of effort—it was about execution, and the Penguins captain made that clear.“We can’t accept just getting one [goal], but sometimes the game’s going to dictate that. Sometimes it’s not going to go your way, [but] we’ve just got to continue to play the right way. I thought we did that,” Crosby said following the defeat. “We didn’t try to cheat for offense. We had some good looks, [but] unfortunately they didn’t go in.”The Penguins dictated much of the game’s tempo, especially through the first two periods, outshooting and out-chancing the Devils. Arturs Silovs was solid in goal, making 23 saves and keeping the Penguins within striking distance. Ryan Graves provided the lone tally for Pittsburgh, but the lack of finish around the net proved costly against a sharp Jake Allen, who turned away several high-quality chances.Saturday’s result was more than just another loss—it was a missed opportunity. With first place in the Metropolitan Division on the line, the Penguins now sit just one point behind the Devils. The performance was strong, but the inability to convert when it mattered most highlighted an ongoing concern for a team looking to establish consistency.The frustration is understandable, especially for Crosby, who continues to lead by example in his 19th NHL season. Earlier in the year, he was at the center of trade rumors linking him to the Montreal Canadiens, but his focus remains fixed on one goal—winning another Stanley Cup with Pittsburgh. Under new head coach Dan Muse, who took over after Mike Sullivan’s departure, the Penguins have found renewed energy and structure.Whether they can maintain that edge deep into the season remains to be seen. For now, the message from Crosby is simple: effort alone isn’t enough. The Penguins must turn strong play into tangible results if they want to stay on top of one of hockey’s toughest divisions.","Pittsburgh Penguins lost 2-1 in a shootout to the New Jersey Devils on Saturday night.

Understanding Joel Embiid’s Knee Management Strategy

Sixers Face Tough Challenge Against Red-Hot Pistons

will not play tonight against the Detroit Pistons as theopt to rest their star center for the second leg of a back-to-back. The decision aligns with the team’s load management strategy, ensuring Embiid’s knee remains healthy throughout the long NBA season. After delivering a season-high 29 points and six rebounds in just 26 minutes during Saturday’s win over the Toronto Raptors, the reigning MVP will take a night off to recover.The 76ers have made Embiid’s health a top priority, particularly given his history of knee injuries. The team continues to monitor his workload closely, avoiding back-to-back appearances as a precautionary measure. This approach reflects a commitment to long-term success over short-term results as Philadelphia looks to remain competitive deep into the season.The official injury report for November 9, 2025, confirms that Joel Embiid is OUT against Detroit. Philadelphia will also be without Paul George, who is still recovering from knee surgery, and Dominick Barlow, sidelined with an elbow injury. Rookie Johni Broome remains out with an ankle sprain, leaving the Sixers short-handed once again. On a positive note, Jared McCain is available after missing Saturday’s game and is expected to play a larger role tonight.The team’s depth will be put to the test, as the Pistons come into the matchup leading the Eastern Conference standings. Philadelphia will look to Tyrese Maxey to lead the offense and fill the void left by Embiid’s absence. Maxey’s scoring ability and leadership will be crucial as the Sixers attempt to contain Detroit’s dynamic backcourt and high-paced offense.Joel Embiid’s absence is not the result of a setback but rather a calculated move to preserve his long-term fitness. The Sixers have implemented a strict policy preventing Embiid from playing on consecutive nights, especially early in the 2025-26 season. His history of knee issues has prompted the team’s medical staff to emphasize rest and recovery, ensuring he stays dominant throughout the campaign and into the playoffs.Despite his limited minutes, Embiid remains a cornerstone for Philadelphia, showcasing elite performances whenever he’s on the floor. His 29-point showing against Toronto reaffirmed his impact, proving that the load management strategy is paying off.The Detroit Pistons, led by Cade Cunningham, have emerged as one of the top teams in the East with a 7-2 record. Philadelphia’s 130-120 win over the Raptors on Saturday showcased their resilience, but tonight’s matchup will test their depth without their star big man. The Sixers’ ability to adapt without Embiid could determine their success against one of the league’s hottest squads.Also read: Is Chet Holmgren playing tonight vs the Memphis Grizzlies?

Josh Allen's wife Hailee Steinfeld has finally shared the story behind her long-running nickname, Beau, giving fans an intimate glimpse into her childhood and family life. In the Nov. 7 edition of her newsletter Beau Society, the 28-year-old singer and actress explained the origins of the name in response to a reader’s question. The story, it turns out, goes all the way back to before she was born. “Before I was born, my parents couldn’t decide whether to name me Hailee or Bailee,” Steinfeld wrote. “Obviously, they landed on Hailee, but still liked the sound of Bailee, so they started calling me ‘Hailee Beau Bailee’, which we shortened to Beau.” She added, “It’s a childhood nickname that I never dropped.”Steinfeld’s family has long played a central role in her life and career. Her father Peter is a personal trainer, while her mother Cheri, who once worked in interior design, now manages Hailee’s career. Married in 1992, they also have an older son, Griffin, 31, who Hailee told PEOPLE in 2023 she is “especially close with.” Reflecting on her upbringing, she said, “I would not be who I am or where I am if it weren't for my mother and my father and my brother. They have kept me in check every step of the way.”When Steinfeld launched Beau Society in August 2024, she revealed that the newsletter had been in development since 2023 during the Screen Actors Guild strike, while she was living in Buffalo with her now-husband, NFL quarterback Josh Allen of the Buffalo Bills. “No one in my family actually calls me Hailee; they call me Beau! And since I started creating this thing, I’ve already riffed on the name: Beau Society naturally morphed into its initials, BS,” she wrote. “Which evolved into This is BS – my mom coined that expression during a fitting and it stuck immediately.”Steinfeld also shared how she structures her newsletter around her busy life. “I wake up on a Monday, which is my brainstorming day. Tuesday, I’m writing it,” she said in a recent Bustle interview. “Wednesday, sending it off to my designer. And then Thursday, we’re doing revisions, and then we send it off.”Through Beau Society, Steinfeld offers fans a personal window into her world — bringing together family stories, humor, and a peek into life alongside an NFL star — all while honoring the nickname that has followed her from childhood into adulthood.More NFL coverage:","Josh Allen's wife Hailee Steinfeld has finally shared the story behind her long- running nickname, Beau.

Chicago Bulls Injury Report vs the Milwaukee Bucks (November 7, 2025)

A Battle of Momentum at Fiserv Forum

Thereceived a huge boost ahead of their NBA Cup matchup against the Chicago Bulls on November 7, 2025, as superstar. This update comes as a relief for Bucks fans who were concerned after the Greek Freak dealt with left knee soreness in recent days. With his name officially removed from the injury list, Giannis is set to lead Milwaukee in a must-win clash against a red-hot Bulls team that currently sits atop the Eastern Conference with a 6-1 record.This game is shaping up to be one of the standout fixtures of the NBA Cup group stage, featuring two franchises with contrasting trajectories. The Bucks are looking to regain momentum after a recent loss to the Toronto Raptors, while the Bulls have been one of the league’s early-season surprises, combining solid defense with balanced scoring. Having Giannis back on the floor gives Milwaukee the competitive edge they need to keep pace with their conference rivals.Giannis Antetokounmpo has been nothing short of dominant this season, averaging 32.3 points, 12.6 rebounds, and 6.3 assists per game. His performance continues to solidify his reputation as one of the most impactful players in the NBA. The Milwaukee Bucks will rely heavily on his leadership and all-around game, especially considering their current injury situation.Despite the good news surrounding Giannis, the Bucks will be missing other key contributors. Kevin Porter Jr. is out after undergoing surgery on his right knee, and Taurean Prince remains sidelined with a neck strain. These absences could shorten Milwaukee’s rotation, making Giannis Antetokounmpo’s presence even more vital to the team’s success.The Chicago Bulls enter the matchup in excellent form but are also dealing with health setbacks. Star guard Coby White has been ruled out, while Ayo Dosunmu’s availability remains uncertain. Even so, the Bulls’ depth has shined this season, with standout performances from Josh Giddey and Nikola Vucevic helping Chicago maintain its strong early record. The Bulls’ combination of youth and experience has created a winning formula, but missing White could test their offensive rhythm against a resilient Bucks squad.Tonight’s showdown promises intensity, as both teams aim to solidify their positions in the NBA Cup standings. The Milwaukee Bucks, led by a determined Giannis Antetokounmpo, will look to bounce back on their home court at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Sam Reinhart’s heartwarming journey from lockdown romance to wedding bells

How Jessica Reinhart built her own path outside the NHL spotlight

Sam Reinhart’s net worth

When you catch a glimpse of Sam Reinhart taking his ice skating to perfection, cool even when facing the hardest situations and getting the most important goals, you can easily forget that there is a completely different side of him—a side that has been formed through love, patience, and slowly but surely winning struggles off the rink. The Florida Panthers’ hero during the Stanley Cup may be the one who will always be in the news of the NHL for his performances, but at home, he is just Jessica’s husband—and they have created together a life that is as harmonious as his gaming style.Hockey is the sport that makes Sam Reinhart famous on ice, but his story away from the rink is about family ties, silent strength, and everlasting love. From being a child in a hockey dynasty to becoming the man who brought Florida its first-ever Stanley Cup, Reinhart’s journey is characterized by both elegance and toughness. His calmness and unyielding drive resemble the life he is living off the rink—firmly rooted, unpretentious, and motivated by a clear sense of direction.Every athlete has such a base, and for Sam, it is his wife Jessica Reinhart. Their love story began in January 2020 when the world was in lockdown (COVID-19 ). The short visit for two weeks turned into eight months of living together. Jessica even joked in an interview that “I ended up moving in with Sam’s family for two weeks, which turned into eight months!”The time spent together was not expected at all, and it was what made their love stronger.On December 25, 2021, Sam popped the question on a Christmas Eve— this was a moment right out of a Hallmark movie. Two years later, on July 7, 2023, they got married at the beautiful Hummingbird Nest Ranch in Santa Susana, California. The wedding was timeless, elegant, and very personal, with 150 guests, Jessica in a flowing Ines Di Santo gown, and soft white florals, much like the couple themselves.Even though the majority of the NHL wives go for the glitzy and glamorous path, Jessica’s life is quite the opposite— healthcare. She is a medical assistant in Vancouver, Canada, and also has a degree in Human Ecology from Western University— she has established her own professional image far from the spotlight. Her work experience, which includes medical clinics and brand development, has been nothing but the same focus and determination that have been the hallmark of her husband’s success on ice.In the year 2025, Sam Reinhart’s value is estimated at $69 million, which is the result of several astute contract negotiations and a stunning performance with the Florida Panthers. His recent eight-year contract, worth $69 million, which comes along with a large signing bonus, places him among the top-paid forwards in the NHL. However, despite the figures, Reinhart's lifestyle is still very simple — he divides his time between South Florida and West Vancouver, where he enjoys the offseason with Jessica and family.Sam and Jessica Reinhart’s life is not solely defined by luxury or fame; rather, it revolves around balance, thankfulness, and partnership. Whether he’s scoring the game-winning goal or she’s taking care of patients at the hospital, both are subtly demonstrating that success is sweetest when shared.More coverage on NHL","Sam Reinhart is the Florida Panthers’ hero during the Stanley Cup.

Is Cam Thomas playing tonight Vs Detroit Pistons?

Cam Thomas’ sudden setback forced the Brooklyn Nets to rethink its strategies in a early-season twist

Due to an injury to the same problematic left hamstring that destroyed the previous season, Cam Thomas, the Brooklyn Nets ' top scorer was forced to miss Wednesday night's 112-103 victory over the Indiana Pacers. With 6:46 remaining in the first quarter against the Pacers, Thomas missed a 15-foot stepback jumper, seemingly hurting himself on the landing.Cam Thomas was later classified as OUT by the team prior to tonight's game against the Detroit Pistons. He was sidelined indefinitely as a result of the setback, in addition to being out for the rest of the match. The great shooting guard may face future difficulties after re-injuring the same hamstring that prevented him from playing in 59 games the previous season.Cam Thomas, who recently sustained a hamstring injury, will be missing from Brooklyn. Even though he will be missed, this might be the ideal chance for the rookies. Thomas had a great start to the season prior to the injury , averaging 21.4 points on 40.2% field goal and 35.6% three-point shooting.However, in his eight starts, he has only contributed 2.6 assists per game, which is indicative of his ongoing scoring-first role.Even so, Thomas has been making every effort to enjoy playing basketball some more.Thomas may miss Friday's game against the Detroit Pistons , and the team will reevaluate him on Thursday, according to head coach Jordi Fernandez. Although it's regrettable that Brooklyn's 23-year-old star might not be playing, this presents a chance that the team should take advantage of right away.His absence comes at the worst possible moment for the Nets. With Drake Powell and Ben Saraf out for tonight's game, the squad has already suffered several blows to its depth. Brooklyn still lacks a starting point guard who can reliably move the ball within the offence without Thomas.The Brooklyn Nets now have a number in the victory column that is greater than zero. On Wednesday night, the Nets defeated the Indiana Pacers 112-103 to secure their first victory of the season away from home.For a team that had its worst start in ten years, it was a breath of relief. Brooklyn is rebuilding, so dropping games makes sense. Now, they are ready for their upcoming matches, with or without Thomas.Also read: Is Cam Thomas playing?

How Connor McDavid's wife Lauren Kyle’s bold interior design identity is redefining what an NHL power couple looks like,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/how-connor-mcdavids-wife-lauren-kyles-bold-interior-design-identity-is-redefining-what-an-nhl-power-couple-looks-like/articleshow/125149911.cms,"Lauren Kyle, fiancée of NHL star Connor McDavid, is redefining the role of athletes' partners. She's built a powerful personal brand centered on sophisticated home design, proving WAGs can be influential entrepreneurs. Kyle's approach challenges traditional NHL masculinity, pushing the league towards a more modern, visually driven era and establishing herself as a significant market voice.

Lauren Kyle’s brand narrative reflects the shift toward design-led, CEO-style WAGs rather than just “player wives”





More coverage on NHL:

There was a time when the partners of pro athletes were barely seen, rarely quoted, and almost never included in the marketing conversation, especially in the NHL, which historically hosts one of the most “closed doors, keep it all quiet” cultures in North American sports. But Lauren Kyle, the fiancée of Edmonton Oilers superstar Connor McDavid , doesn’t exist in that old template.She’s not an accessory. She is the architect of a personal brand that leans into design, refinement, and highly curated home aesthetics. The conversations around her work have been loud, polarizing, and surprisingly influential. And now, she’s becoming a case study in how WAG entrepreneurship can shape cultural direction, not just add gloss to a player’s fame.Lauren Kyle’s rise isn’t simply about the “white and metallic house” moment that went viral. It’s the fact that she doubled down, she didn’t run from the discourse. She recast the reaction as proof that her vision evokes emotion. And in a luxury economy, emotion sells.Modern NHL fans tend to assume hockey culture = traditional masculinity + limited visual references. But Kyle is pushing an entirely different energy, magazine spreads, reflective surfaces, lifestyle-forward execution, and design-first storytelling.And that is exactly why her entrepreneurial trajectory matters. She isn’t evolving alongside the NHL brand, she’s dragging parts of the league into a more visually modern era with her.And it also reframes McDavid’s public image: not just athlete, but cultural architecture subject. Today, when people say things like “Lauren Kyle has an aesthetic,” that’s not gossip, that’s branding evidence. It means she has moved from a partner role to a market voice.Her message isn’t subtle: hockey wives aren’t background props anymore. Lauren Kyle is shaping the stage itself and the NHL has never seen a design-forward power couple quite like this.","Lauren Kyle, fiancée of NHL star Connor McDavid, is redefining the role of athletes' partners.

Trigger warning:

Dak Prescott lost his older brother Jace to suicide and now his defensive end Marshawn Kneeland to apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound

More news on Dallas Cowboys:

This story contains references to suicide.Three days ago, Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott ’s teammate Marshawn Kneeland, the 24-year-old defensive end scored his first career touchdown of the 2025 season. Now, the world is reeling from the devastating news of Kneeland’s death, reportedly from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after a police chase. Frisco police said they were called to locate a vehicle that had evaded officers during a pursuit. They found the car crashed on the southbound Dallas Parkway near Warren Parkway. Officers said Kneeland had fled the scene. As police were searching for him, they were informed that he had “expressed suicidal ideations.” At 1:31 AM, they found him “deceased with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.” The Collin County Medical Examiner’s Office will determine the official cause of death.Heartfelt tributes poured in after his tragic passing. Among them was the quarterback who had lost his defensive end. He spoke about Kneeland with CBS Sports Texas at his alma mater, Haughton High School, during a special field dedication ceremony.“It’s been a very tough day,” Dak Prescott said. “As you said, it started early this morning, finding out the news—tragic loss. I hurt. Heavy, heavy heart today. I hurt for Marshawn. I hurt for his family. I’m hurt for his girlfriend. I hurt for every single one of my teammates. This is a pain that you don’t wish upon anybody. You wish none of us had to go through this. You wish Marshawn didn’t have to go through what he had went through. And just thankful for each moment we have in this life. And don’t take it for granted, and hug and love those that you do. It’s okay to feel however you’re feeling. And I’ll tell you, first and foremost, I don’t always have the answers and today is not a day that I felt like I had answers.”“Triggering day for many reasons,” Prescott said. “On top of just knowing that I had today, and hard to balance my emotions today and not have a day that I have words other than I love you for friends and families, and people who may be struggling. Yeah, I love them. Obviously, we had a Zoom call, and a few people who spoke did an amazing job, but as I said, it’s to tell that person how I feel about them when I see them. Tough moments for this team. As I said, I feel hurt for everybody that’s involved in this and Marshawn’s family and loved ones.”The Dallas Cowboys are on their bye week now, and this tragic news has shaken them, especially the quarterback, who lost his brother to suicide. Jace Prescott died by suicide in April 2020 at 31 years old. In September 2020, the star signal-caller spoke about his older brother, Jace, to Pat Doney of NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth. Prescott appeared as a guest on “In Depth with Graham Bensinger.”“Honestly, a couple of days before my brother passed, I started experiencing depression,” Prescott said. “I didn’t know what I was going through, to say the least, and hadn’t been sleeping well at all. But for one night, I sleep the best I’ve slept, missing ten-plus calls from (my brother) and giving my dad enough time to come in my bedroom and tell me what had happened. So, I woke up after the best night of sleep I’ve had in 2020 from the worst news, some of the worst news I’ll ever get. ”He recalled receiving the news from his father. “I mean, obviously, there were tears and tears and tears,” he told Besinger. “I sat there and tried to process what had happened and wanted to ask why for so many reasons...and as much as you want to ask why, I know my brother, and he had a lot of burdens on him.”The burdens he mentioned were linked to their mother’s colon cancer treatment, with Jace as her primary caregiver. They lost their mother, Peggy Prescott, in November 2013. After his brother’s passing, Prescott and his other brother, Tad, promised to be more open with each other.","Dak Prescott lost his older brother Jace to suicide and now his defensive end Marshawn Kneeland to apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. “It’s been a very tough day,” Dak Prescott said.

Buffalo Sabres stunned as Rasmus Dahlin takes personal leave,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/buffalo-sabres-stunned-as-rasmus-dahlin-takes-personal-leave/articleshow/125171976.cms,"Rasmus Dahlin (Image Via Twitter)

How the Buffalo Sabres will adjust Without their Captain on the Ice



The Buffalo Sabres are getting ready to go without their captain and mainstay on defense, Rasmus Dahlin, who has left the team for an unspecified period for personal reasons. The team made the announcement on Friday that Dahlin will be away while he returns home to Sweden to be with his fiancée, Carolina Matovac. The 25-year-old defenseman has been a consistent contributor to Buffalo's defense this season, with nine points in 14 games, but now the focus understandably shifts from hockey to family.Dahlin's choice coincides with a very personal and emotional story in his life. Matovac, suffering from sudden heart failure in summer, needed emergency CPR, life support, and finally a heart transplant. She has been recuperating in Sweden while Dahlin has been in North America to start the NHL season. The Athletic's Matthew Fairburn reports that Sabres coach Lindy Ruff has revealed that Matovac's condition is stable and the whole team is behind Dahlin's move. Ruff added, ""I don’t think you can describe it. I don’t think you can feel what he’s feeling. I’m very passionate about the fact that no one would want to walk in his shoes and have dealt with what he dealt with. He has the support of everybody on this.""With Dahlin gone, Buffalo will have to make adjustments both in terms of playing style and atmosphere in the locker room. His absence as captain and one of the best defensemen in the NHL creates a huge gap in both leadership and playmaking.It is anticipated that defensemen Owen Power and Mattias Samuelsson will take the extra defensive workload during Dahlin's leave of absence, as the Sabres will try to remain competitive. Ruff might also depend to a greater extent on inexperienced defensemen in the areas of keeping the puck and changing the play, which will be a challenge that can uncover maturity and depth in Buffalo’s young core that is already going through an emotional period.The Sabres are now looking at the picture beyond just victories and defeats. The number one thing on their list is to continue taking care of Dahlin and his family till the latter is able to come back — something that even in top-level sports, there are instances that are more than just the match.More coverage on NHL","Rasmus Dahlin will be away while he returns home to Sweden to be with his fiancée, Carolina Matovac.

What happened to Christian McCaffrey?

This was not due to injury but rather strong defensive strategies. Opposing teams are focusing on stopping McCaffrey first. This highlights his crucial role as the offensive engine for the San Francisco Forty-Niners. His struggles indicate the team's other offensive players are facing challenges.

Christian McCaffrey’s slow start in Week 10 raises questions, but this dip says more about defenses than it does his health

More coverage on NFL:

Christian McCaffrey entered Week 10 as one of the few bright spots in a San Francisco 49ers season that has been battered by injuries everywhere else. The expectation for him wasn’t just high, it was almost unfair. With no Jauan Jennings, no Ricky Pearsall, limited doses of George Kittle, and even stretches without Brock Purdy, McCaffrey became the singular engine that kept the Niners relevant in tough stretches.Yet when the team took on the Rams in this divisional test, viewers immediately began to ask if something was wrong. The stat sheet looked foreign to the standard he’s set. Was he hurt? Was something off? Or was the dip simply football reality?McCaffrey has already exploded this season as a premium pass-catching lifeline. He has totaled 626 receiving yards and four touchdowns on 61 receptions and added 596 rushing yards and four touchdowns on 168 carries. Yet the yards-per-carry number, 3.5 — is the one that’s been the most jarring. That’s not scheme regression. That’s not physical decline. That's a defensive obsession.Against Los Angeles, the trend became impossible to ignore. As San Francisco trailed 21-7, McCaffrey had only 14 rushing yards on seven carries and 12 receiving yards on three catches, a line that looked ordinary in a year when he has felt anything but ordinary.It’s important to note: nothing visible suggests new injury flare-ups. Last year’s trip to Germany to see specialists feels like a lifetime ago considering his 2025 availability. This looks like a classic case of a superstar being game-planned out.Defenses aren’t just reacting to McCaffrey, they’re calling entire drives based on stopping him first. When everyone else in the Niners’ offense is either injured, inexperienced, or inconsistent, that muzzling becomes even easier.So no, this Week 10 slow stretch shouldn’t be viewed as a panic signal. If anything, this is the clearest proof yet that McCaffrey is the gravitational force in the offense. When he looks human, it’s usually because everyone else is hurt, not because he is.","Christian McCaffrey entered Week 10 as one of the few bright spots in a San Francisco 49ers season that has been battered by injuries everywhere else.

Why Gafford Makes Sense for the Lakers

Potential Benefits of a Gafford Trade:

Mavericks’ Perspective

Themay be on the verge of making another major move to bolster their roster around superstar. After an explosive start to the 2025-26 NBA season, Doncic has proven why he’s one of the league’s most dominant players, putting up video game-like numbers and keeping the Lakers firmly in playoff contention. Now, reports indicate that Los Angeles could look to reunite Doncic with one of his former Dallas Mavericks teammates - a player who once thrived alongside him as a reliable rim-running big man.According to ClutchPoints’ Brett Siegel, the Lakers have expressed renewed interest in 6-foot-10 center Daniel Gafford, who currently plays for the Mavericks and was instrumental in helping Dallas reach the NBA Finals during the 2023-24 season. The move would not only strengthen the Lakers’ frontcourt but also give Doncic a familiar pick-and-roll partner with whom he already shares strong chemistry. With the trade deadline months away, the possibility of reuniting Doncic and Gafford in Los Angeles has quickly become one of the most intriguing storylines of the season.Despite missing a few early games due to injury, Luka Doncic has been nothing short of spectacular in his first season with the Lakers.The five-time All-Star is averaging an astounding 40.0 points, 11.0 rebounds, and 9.2 assists per game, powering a Lakers squad that currently sits five games above .500.Doncic’s chemistry with his teammates continues to evolve, but a reunion with a familiar face like Daniel Gafford could take Los Angeles to another level.According to ClutchPoints’ Brett Siegel, the Los Angeles Lakers have shown strong interest in trading for Daniel Gafford - a player they’ve been monitoring since last season. “Coincidentally enough, one of the teams with strong interest in Gafford dating back to last season is the Los Angeles Lakers, sources said. Could we see a reunion between Luka Doncic and Gafford in Los Angeles in February?” Siegel wrote. (H/t: Sporting News)Siegel also noted that while Dallas isn’t rushing into trade mode, the franchise is being closely watched. “It is no secret that Harrison and the Mavericks’ front office will explore what return exists for Klay Thompson before the trade deadline, and several teams are monitoring Daniel Gafford’s status,” Siegel reported.Gafford recently inked a three-year, $60 million contract extension this offseason but remains eligible for trade during the 2025-26 campaign.Since arriving in Dallas midway through the 2023-24 NBA season, Gafford has been a key contributor. His presence helped the Mavericks reach the NBA Finals, where his defense and finishing around the rim complemented Doncic’s playmaking perfectly.This season, Gafford has maintained solid production despite playing behind Dallas’ rising young center, Derek Lively.Gafford’s 2025-26 Averages (current season):Reuniting Gafford with Doncic could give the Lakers a reliable rim protector and a consistent lob threat - something the team has lacked in its current rotation. Gafford’s athleticism and defensive instincts would also ease the workload on Anthony Davis, allowing the Lakers to stabilize their interior defense while strengthening their offensive pick-and-roll game.• Enhances chemistry with Luka Doncic• Adds elite rim protection and rebounding• Boosts interior scoring efficiency• Provides depth and durability at the center positionFrom Dallas’ side, the decision to trade Gafford won’t come easily. As Siegel noted, the Mavericks are “not operating in a panic mode” and remain cautious about parting ways with valuable assets. However, if the right offer arrives - especially one that helps balance their roster - the front office could consider moving Gafford before the trade deadline.While no formal talks have been reported yet, the Lakers’ interest in Daniel Gafford underscores their commitment to surrounding Luka Doncic with talent he’s familiar with. Gafford’s combination of efficiency, athleticism, and defensive presence could make him the ideal midseason acquisition for a Lakers team looking to make a deep playoff push.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Golden State Warriors could potentially re-sign $50 million Dallas Mavericks guard to support Stephen Curry and improve title odds If Los Angeles can strike a deal, fans might soon see Doncic and Gafford reconnecting in purple and gold - reigniting one of Dallas’ most effective duos from their Finals run just a year ago.","The Los Angeles Lakers have expressed renewed interest in 6-foot-10 center Daniel Gafford.

Smriti Mandhana was in no mood to give a byte after celebrations ended in New Delhi

Poll Should more established players like Sachin Tendulkar mentor the current generation of female cricketers? Yes, definitely Maybe, in certain cases No, they should find their own way

NEW DELHI: When the phone rang on the eve of the ICC Women's World Cup final, Harmanpreet Kaur didn't expect to hear the voice of India's cricketing god. But it was Sachin Tendulkar himself — calling to share words of wisdom that would help her and her team stay grounded before the biggest match of their lives.“The night before the match, Sachin sir called,” Harmanpreet revealed in The ICC Review. “He shared his experience and asked us to keep our balance. When the game is going fast, just slow it down a little. Try and control it because when you go too fast, chances are you can stumble. That's what we need to avoid.”The rest, as they say, is history. Five days on from India's historic triumph over South Africa in Navi Mumbai, Harmanpreet is still coming to terms with the magnitude of what her side achieved.“Whenever we are seeing each other, we are just saying, ‘world champion'. It's a very different feeling,” she smiled. “My mother and father were there. It was a very special moment to lift the World Cup trophy with them. Since my childhood, they have heard me say that I want to wear India's jersey, play for the country, lead the team and win the World Cup.”Harmanpreet now stands alongside Kapil Dev (1983) and MS Dhoni (2011) as the only Indian captains to lift a senior ODI World Cup — and the first woman to do so.Yet, the skipper admits the reality still hasn't sunk in.“To be honest, I can't process this right now,” she said. “Maybe after a few months I'll realise what we've given our country. It still feels like we've just won a bilateral series and are heading home.”Reflecting on her team's success, Harmanpreet was quick to credit Smriti Mandhana , Deepti Sharma , and Shafali Verma as the key architects of the win.“Shafali was familiar with the pressure and the stage. When that partnership was building, we gave her an over — and she got us two back-to-back wickets,” she recalled.On Mandhana, she added, “Her contribution will always be remembered. Whenever she bats, we all pray she gets a century — because when she gets runs, everything else just falls into place.”And of Deepti Sharma, the tournament's standout performer, Harmanpreet said, “All she needed was a push. Somewhere we all felt she was holding herself back. Now she believes — and that belief has changed everything.”","Sachin Tendulkar called Harmanpreet Kaur on the eve of the ICC Women's World Cup final.

Also read:

After placing centre David Kampf on suspension without pay, the Toronto Maple Leafs have again come up with another update amid a goaltending shuffle. The Maple Leafs have officially placed goaltender Cayden Primeau on waivers, as per reports citing NHL insider Chris Johnston.According to early reports, Primeau was acquired via waivers earlier this season, as the Maple Leafs looked to bolster their goal depth, while veteran goaltender Joseph Woll continued to be unavailable. At the time of the waiver placement, Primeau had appeared in three games for Toronto, posting a 2-1-0 record but struggling with a 4.30 goals-against average and an .838 save percentage. However, upon goalie Joseph Woll’s return to the organization after taking a leave of absence for personal reasons, the team has to make this call. The Toronto Maple Leafs have placed goaltender Cayden Primeau on waivers. The move was first reported byChris Johnston on Thursday, and it comes as the team’s goalie depth chart continues to evolve with the return of Joseph Woll and the steady play of newcomer Anthony Stolarz.The decision to put Primeau on waivers appears driven by two key factors. The first being, with Joseph Woll now cleared to rejoin the team following his personal leave, his presence reduces the urgency for Primeau as the backup netminder.While Primeau showed promise, his recent outing, six goals allowed on 24 shots in a start, has raised questions about his readiness for a sustained NHL role.Reports suggest that Toronto general manager Brad Treliving had little choice but to expose him to waivers if the organization hoped to send him to the AHL’s Toronto Marlies.As for his performance, the 6-foot-3 Primeau appeared in net three times for the Maple Leafs, going 2-1-0 with a 4.30 goals-against average and an .838 save percentage. He was drafted 199th overall by the Montreal Canadiens and has a career 15-25-7 record with a 3.73 GAA and an .882 save percentage split between the Canadiens and Maple Leafs.Meanwhile, Toronto is placed in fourth place in the Atlantic Division with an 8-5-1 record and has back-to-back games over the weekend, where they will face the Boston Bruins on Saturday and the Carolina Hurricanes on Sunday.","The Toronto Maple Leafs have placed goaltender Cayden Primeau on waivers.

No off days as captain Shubman Gill, coach Gautam Gambhir arrive in Kolkata for Test series

NEW DELHI: The tour of England three months ago allayed fears about the future of India’s Test batting lineup after the retirements of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. Shubman Gill ’s emerged as a powerhouse at No. 4. Rishabh Pant’s stature at No. 5 kept growing. KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal combined successfully as openers and Ravindra Jadeja at No.6 kept raising the bar.Yet, when they get down to picking their XI against South Africa for the first Test in Kolkata on Nov 14, head coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Gill will spend a fair bit of time to zero in on their No. 3. The selectors and the team management are willing to invest heavily in Sai Sudharsan at that spot after moving on from Karun Nair. But the rapid evolution of Dhruv Jurel may force the team management to create a spot for him.Jurel scored his maiden Test century against West Indies last month in the absence of an injured Pant before hitting back-to-back unbeaten and commanding tons in the second unofficial Test against South Africa ‘A’ in Bengaluru in the past seven days. Sudharsan’s indifferent returns at No. 3 since his debut at Leeds in June will test the team management’s resolve.TOI understands that the team management isn’t willing to do away with Sudharsan just yet. But there is a case for Jurel to get a run with the Test team. This team management has often been accused of being impatient with middle-order batters—dropping Sarfaraz Khan from its plans just being a case in point. Sources close to the team management told TOI that Jurel’s place is under consideration, but it would be unfair if it happens at Sudharsan’s expense.That puts Nitish Kumar Reddy’s place in the XI under the scanner. Gill’s reluctance to use Reddy with the ball in the Test series against West Indies last month challenges the team management’s desire to groom a proper seam-bowling allrounder.Devdutt Padikkal too is a viable option at no.3. “Padikkal has been part of the Test plans since the home series against England in Feb-March 2024. He got a half-century on debut and looked composed at Perth vs Australia last Nov even though he didn’t get many runs. He deserves to get a chance to fail, at least,” said a source close to the team management.“At this moment, Jurel looks to have the best technique to bat at No. 3. But the team management has to be clear with its vision because No. 3 will be a big call. If Jurel is only seen as a wicketkeeping backup for Pant, then it will be a problem in the long run. It’s tough for a wicketkeeper to consistently keep wickets and bat at No. 3 in Tests. Or else, he can come in for Reddy at No. 7, even though it’s very low for a proper batter to come in,” former India wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta, who has been following this Indian team closely as a broadcaster, told TOI.India has seen smooth transitions at No. 4 from Sachin Tendulkar to Kohli to Gill. The search for a stable No. 3 has been comparatively longer after the selectors moved on from Cheteshwar Pujara. Interestingly, Gill was the first choice for that position before he found his calling at No. 4.Former India selector Devang Gandhi reckoned the selectors must get down to strengthening the pool of Test batters. “As of now, they should give Sudharsan a longer run because he is young. But all the selectors need to spread out and cover as many domestic games as possible. It’s clear that there is a dry pool of backup batters in the Test format. Sudharsan hasn’t cemented his place. Padikkal isn’t getting runs even for India ‘A’. Jurel has made a strong case, but there doesn’t seem to be a definite plan regarding his role. And there is no backup opener with Abhimanyu Easwaran inspiring little confidence. This domestic season and the one next year will be hard work for the selectors,” Gandhi told TOI.",Dhruv Jurel scored his maiden Test century against West Indies last month. India will pick their XI against South Africa for the first Test in Kolkata on Nov 14. The selectors and the team management are willing to invest heavily in Sai Sudharsan at that spot.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125214542,imgsize-33682,width-400,resizemode-4/dhruv-jurel-1011-pti.jpg"
'From suspension to swap?' - Why Ravindra Jadeja made a shock exit from Rajasthan Royals in 2010,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/from-suspension-to-swap-the-untold-story-behind-ravindra-jadejas-shock-exit-from-rajasthan-royals/articleshow/125214449.cms,"Ravindra Jadeja (X)

The trade market has been buzzing ahead of the IPL 2025 retention deadline on November 15, with discussions between Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Rajasthan Royals (RR) centring around a potential Ravindra Jadeja–Sanju Samson swap. As reported by TimesofIndia.com earlier, RR had initially reached out to CSK for a possible deal involving Jadeja, but talks stalled as the Royals were simultaneously negotiating a separate trade with Delhi Capitals involving Samson and Tristan Stubbs.When the Delhi deal fell through — primarily due to disagreements over RR’s demand for uncapped player Sameer Rizvi — the Royals reopened discussions with CSK. Sources suggest that the conversation is not limited to a direct Jadeja–Samson exchange, as RR have also shown interest in an additional CSK player, possibly Matheesha Pathirana or Sam Curran But amid all the trade chatter, one question stands out — why was Ravindra Jadeja released by Rajasthan Royals in the first place?The story goes back to 2010, when Jadeja, after two successful seasons with RR including winning the title in 2008, was banned for one year by the IPL governing council for trying to negotiate a move to Mumbai Indians without informing his franchise. Then IPL chief Lalit Modi had said, “The IPL governing council has arrived at this decision after due deliberations done after taking into account Ravindra Jadeja’s representation to the president of the BCCI and a further representation by the Rajasthan Royals.The player guidelines laid out by the governing council of the IPL are sacrosanct and all players will need to strictly adhere to the same. ”Jadeja served the suspension in 2010 before returning to the league with Kochi Tuskers Kerala in 2011. A year later, Chennai Super Kings picked him up — and the rest, as they say, is history.Now, with RR once again showing strong intent to bring him back in a potential blockbuster trade, Jadeja’s IPL story may be on the verge of another unexpected twist.","The trade market has been buzzing ahead of the IPL 2025 retention deadline on November 15.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan etched their name in the record books once again, becoming the most successful team in Hong Kong Sixes history with a commanding 43-run victory over Kuwait in the 2025 final on Sunday. The triumph at Mission Road Ground, Mong Kok, marked Pakistan’s sixth title, surpassing England and South Africa, who had five each.The celebrations were jubilant as Pakistan’s players took a lap of honour, waving to the cheering crowd and soaking in the applause after reclaiming their dominance 14 years after their last title in 2011. Their previous triumphs came in 1992, 1997, 2001, 2002, and 2011 — and this one added another glorious chapter to their rich legacy.However, what made headlines beyond the victory was Pakistan captain Muhammad Shahzad’s cheeky dig at India’s skipper Dinesh Karthik after the final.Earlier in the tournament, India had beaten Pakistan by two runs (DLS method) in their opening game, prompting Karthik to post on social media: “Fun start to Hong Kong Sixes. Winning against Pak.”But India’s campaign nosedived soon after. They lost their remaining matches to Kuwait, UAE, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, crashing out of the competition with just one win.Pakistan, meanwhile, bounced back strongly from that narrow defeat to dominate the rest of the tournament.When Shahzad lifted the trophy after the final, he couldn’t resist a playful jab at Karthik. Posting photos of himself with the trophy, he replied to Karthik’s earlier post with the caption: “Fun end to the Hong Kong Sixes. Business as usual.” The post went viral instantly, sparking laughter and banter across cricket circles. Fans hailed Shahzad’s witty comeback, celebrating it as a perfect retort both on and off the field.In the final, Pakistan were at their ruthless best. Batting first, they piled up 135/3 with explosive hitting across the order. Kuwait, who had stunned several big teams including Afghanistan, India, and England to reach the final, began their chase in blazing fashion — hammering 32 runs off the opening over. But Pakistan’s bowlers regrouped swiftly. Shahzad, Maaz Sadaqat, and Abbas Afridi bowled tight lines, triggering a dramatic collapse. Kuwait went from dream start to total despair, eventually folding well short of the target.Pakistan’s victory not only sealed their sixth Hong Kong Sixes title but also restored their reputation as the undisputed kings of the format — and thanks to Shahzad’s timely troll, the win carried an extra layer of spice.","Pakistan beat Kuwait by 43 runs in the 2025 Hong Kong Sixes final.
