Poll Who do you think had the upper hand in the rivalry between Irfan Pathan and Shahid Afridi? Irfan Pathan Shahid Afridi It was evenly matched Not sure

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria has stirred fresh controversy by backing Irfan Pathan ’s explosive revelations about his long-standing rivalry with Shahid Afridi , calling out the former Pakistan captain for resorting to personal attacks.Pathan, who enjoyed considerable success against Pakistan — with 67 wickets and 807 runs in Indo-Pak clashes — dismissed Afridi 11 times across formats, including a golden duck in the 2007 T20 World Cup final. Speaking to Lallantop, the former India all-rounder recalled how the rivalry turned bitter after Afridi mocked his identity in an interview.“Afridi had said, ‘I am the real Pathan, he is a fake Pathan’. Badtameez aadmi hai. Mujhe laga ki aap sirf mere baare mein nahi bol rahe ho, mere walid ke baare mein bhi baat kar rahe,” Pathan revealed. “So whenever I had the ball in hand, I made sure I dismissed him. I have shown him 11 times who the real Pathan is — in big moments, in series deciders, and in the World Cup final.”Kaneria, Afridi’s former teammate, echoed Pathan’s claims in a scathing social media post. “Irfan @IrfanPathan bhai, you’re absolutely right.He always resorts to personal attacks — be it on someone’s family or their religion. Class and decency clearly aren’t his strengths,” Kaneria wrote while sharing the interview clip.Pathan also recalled off-field flashpoints, including a fiery mid-air spat during India’s 2006 tour of Pakistan. “Afridi came and placed his hand on my head, messing up my hair. He asked me, ‘How are you kid?’ I said, ‘Since when have you become my father?’… Later, I told him, ‘He has eaten dog meat, he has been barking for a long time.’ After that, he couldn’t reply.”For Pathan, Afridi’s taunts only served as fuel. “On the field, my performances were the perfect answer. I showed him who the real Pathan is.”Kaneria’s intervention has reignited an already fiery debate, bringing back to spotlight one of cricket’s most infamous rivalries.","Former Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria has backed Irfan Pathan's claims about his rivalry with Shahid Afridi.

Arjun Tendulkar, son of cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar, is all set to begin a new chapter in his personal life. The 25-year-old has reportedly got engaged to Sanniya Chandhok, 26, on August 13, 2025.The age gap between the couple, a little over a year, has already drawn attention because it mirrors Sachin Tendulkar’s own marriage.The Master Blaster tied the knot with Anjali in 1995, despite her being five years older.Sachin was born on April 24, 1973, while Anjali was born on November 10, 1967. Their relationship, and enduring bond, was once seen as unconventional but soon became one of Indian cricket’s most admired partnerships.Arjun, born on September 24, 1999, has been steadily carving out his career in cricket.A left-arm pacer and lower-order batter, he made his IPL debut for Mumbai Indians in 2023. While his career is still in its early stages, his personal life has already taken a decisive turn with his engagement.Sanniya Chandhok, born on June 23, 1998, is a year older than Arjun.Reports suggest the couple celebrated their engagement in a private ceremony attended by close friends and family.Interestingly, Arjun himself is younger than his sister Sara Tendulkar, who is two years older, making the age dynamic within the family a familiar one.Much like his father, Arjun seems unfazed by societal expectations around age gaps in relationships.The Tendulkar family, long admired for its grounded approach to fame, appears set to welcome a new member with warmth and celebration.As Arjun balances the demands of cricket and prepares for a new phase off the field, the parallel with Sachin’s own life journey is hard to miss.Once again, a Tendulkar son seems ready to walk in his father’s footsteps, this time, in love.","The 25-year-old has reportedly got engaged to Sanniya Chandhok, 26, on August 13, 2025.

Poll Which player from the Class of 2023 do you think will be missed the most in the 2025 squad? Rohit Sharma Virat Kohli Ravindra Jadeja

NEW DELHI: With the Indian selectors expected to unveil the squad for the Asia Cup 2025 on Tuesday, August 19, speculation is mounting over who will make the cut for the continental T20I event. India, placed in Group A alongside Pakistan, UAE, and Oman, will feature in the tournament scheduled in the UAE from September 9–28.This edition will be played in the T20I format, aligning with the T20 World Cup cycle next year. The last edition in 2023, however, was an ODI competition jointly hosted by Pakistan and Sri Lanka. That squad, led by Rohit Sharma, lifted the trophy, but much has changed in the two years since.From the Class of 2023, three stalwarts — Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Ravindra Jadeja — have retired from T20Is, drawing curtains on their illustrious careers in the shortest format. Their absence has created both a leadership vacuum and opportunities for the next generation.Several others who featured two years ago have drifted away from India's T20 set-up. Ishan Kishan, Prasidh Krishna, Mohammed Shami, and Shardul Thakur have not been part of the scheme in recent times, either due to form, fitness, or selection dynamics.That leaves a solid core of players still very much in contention for the Class of 2025. Suryakumar Yadav , now India's T20I captain, heads the list, with Hardik Pandya , Jasprit Bumrah, and Shubman Gill expected to play central roles. Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul, Mohammed Siraj, Washington Sundar, Tilak Varma, and Kuldeep Yadav also remain in the selectors' consideration.The key talking point, however, is how many of these 2023 squad members will survive the transition. The rise of youngsters like Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rinku Singh, and Jitesh Sharma has made competition stiffer, while experienced hands such as Pandya and Bumrah provide balance.As the BCCI gears up for the announcement, the focus will be on continuity versus fresh blood. For now, the question lingers: who from the Class of 2023 will carry forward India's challenge in the Class of 2025?","India are set to unveil their squad for the Asia Cup 2025 on Tuesday, August 19.

Poll Do you think Vanessa Bryant handled the pregnancy rumors well? Yes, very cleverly No, she should have addressed them directly

Met Gala Surprise: Rihanna Stuns With Baby Bump Reveal, A$AP Rocky Confirms It’s Baby No 3

After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant ’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip. No press release needed when you’ve got Rihanna energy with a direct middle finger gesture.The rumors had emerged out of nowhere, with some users pointing to photos allegedly showing a ""baby bump,"" though no timestamps or context were attached to those images. Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there’s been zero confirmation from her side—until now.In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.“The only way to impress me, is by being a good person,” the quote read. “I don’t care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.”Adding one final touch to her trilogy of clapbacks, she posted another Rihanna meme, this one stating, “I’m not mean, I’m just not the one.”With the classic Rihanna memes, Vanessa showed that she is busy being a proud mom to her daughters while being the powerhouse of her business ventures. While she does not care about the rumor mill, her reaction explicitly showed that she is urging privacy.Vanessa Bryant, who shares four daughters with Kobe— Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and the late Gianna— has remained devoted to family and philanthropy. Most recently, she shared footage of a joyful family ski trip over the holidays, showing the tight-knit bond she maintains with her children.Natalia Bryant stepped into the fashion world just like her mother, officially joining IMG Models in 2021 at the age of 18. “Ever since I can remember, I wanted to model,” she shared in a statement posted by IMG on Instagram. “There is a lot to learn, but I feel this is a great opportunity for me to learn and express myself creatively.”Vanessa and Kobe Bryant tied the knot in April 2001. Tragically, in January 2020, Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna lost their lives in a helicopter crash that also killed seven others. They were headed to Kobe’s Mamba Sports Academy for a youth basketball game when the accident occurred. Kobe was 41 at the time. The loss shook the sports world and left a lasting impact on fans, friends, and loved ones across the globe. Kobe has left a huge legacy to his name as well, he is considered one the of the elite NBA superstars of all time with astounding stats, records and intense playmaking abilities. His demise created a huge void in the NBA world as fans are still mourning his untimely passing.Since their passing, she’s kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work. Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Foundation in 2016, aiming to support young athletes. After his death, Vanessa renamed it the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in honor of both Kobe and Gianna. Today, the foundation helps underserved boys and girls in sports, pushing forward the mission they believed in. It's her way of carrying on their legacy with purpose and heart.Vanessa Bryant’s response was indeed witty and empowering as she hinted that she deserves privacy and reminded the world that while she may be a public figure, her peace and dignity aren’t up for debate, especially not over unfounded gossip. After the viral response via memes, Vanessa has seemingly closed the chapter as she did not extend the matter any further with any other comments about it afterwards.Days after shutting down the pregnancy rumor, Vanessa Bryant made a glowing courtside appearance with her daughters at the New York Liberty vs. Chicago Sky game. The WNBA shared a sweet clip showing Vanessa alongside Natalia, 22, Bianka, 8, and Capri, 5, all smiling and waving for the camera.Later, Vanessa uploaded an image of her in a restaurant, candidly posing as she waited for the food to be arrive. Considering the dress, it appears that the photograph was shot after her recent attendance in the game.Their family moment quickly caught fans’ attention online, adding a warm highlight to the evening. It was a rare and heartwarming public outing for the Bryant family, showing their strong support for women’s basketball. It was Vanessa's first public outing since she debunked the horrendous pregnancy rumors.Recently, Vanessa honored her husband Kobe's memory with a heartfelt Instagram post on Instagram, sharing a throwback photograph of the family with the NBA legend, ""Happy Fathers Day @kobebryant 💕 You are so missed. We love you so much. #GirlDad 💕💕""Earlier this July, Vanessa Bryant added another heartfelt moment to her social media with a birthday post for her sister, Sophie. The sweet throwback photo featured Vanessa, her late husband Kobe Bryant, and Sophie together, smiling during happier times. It comes after several touching family updates, including daughter Natalia’s recent USC graduation and emotional tribute to her dad.As for her fortune, Vanessa's net worth has seen major growth over the years. While Kobe Bryant’s NBA success helped build their fortune, Vanessa carved her own path, too. She’s earned recognition as a model, businesswoman, and philanthropist, adding to her wealth through years of steady work.As of 2025, her estimated net worth is $600 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. A large portion of that came from Kobe’s estate, after his tragic passing in 2020. At the time, Forbes valued the Lakers legend’s net worth at $600 million.Vanessa Bryant just shared a sweet throwback-inspired moment that melted hearts online. Her youngest daughter, Capri, recreated one of Kobe Bryant’s most iconic photos from 1999—wearing a cast and pajamas just like her dad did after a wrist injury. Vanessa captioned the photo, “Like father, like daughter. 💜 Capri Kobe Bryant 💜 #BabyMamba #KokoBean 💜💛🐍,” reminding fans how Kobe’s spirit lives on through their kids. From raising her children to keeping Kobe's memory alive, Vanessa has been an example of love and a remarkable parent. Also, there is no report of her seeing anyone as she remains loyal to her beloved husband Kobe, cherishing his legacy with their kids.Vanessa Bryant’s newest tribute arrives just months after she shared memories from a snowy holiday getaway with her daughters. Last December, she posted sweet moments on Instagram— showing the girls toasting marshmallows and skiing through the snow. Little Capri even shared a carousel ride with Vanessa, making the winter trip extra special.Additionally, Vanessa Bryant also grabs headlines for her friendship with several celebrities including Ciara, she often comments and likes the posts of her friends on social media.

Maple Leafs fans on edge as Auston Matthews’ health questions emerge before opener without Mitch Marner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/maple-leafs-fans-on-edge-as-auston-matthews-health-questions-emerge-before-opener-without-mitch-marner/articleshow/123327949.cms,"Auston Matthews’ injury concerns create uncertainty for Maple Leafs entering season opener minus Mitch Marner (Getty Images)

Auston Matthews’ health in spotlight ahead of season opener



Why Auston Matthews’ form is crucial to the Leafs’ ambitions



With October 8 approaching, the Toronto Maple Leafs face a cloud of uncertainty surrounding their captain, Auston Matthews. The team’s offensive heartbeat is still under scrutiny as whispers about his health grow louder. A season opener against the Montreal Canadiens is no small stage, and Matthews’ readiness could very well determine whether Toronto begins with a statement or a stumble.Auston Matthews, who battled injuries and saw a noticeable dip in his goal-scoring last season, enters this year with more questions than answers. TSN’s Overdrive didn’t mince words when discussing the situation: “We don’t know what his health situation is. The idea he is going to be fully healthy is a big question mark. He’ll say it when he arrives but I’ll believe it when I see it.”Adding to the challenge is the absence of Mitch Marner, his long-time partner in offensive crime. Marner’s fingerprints were on half of Matthews’ regular-season goals and 60% of his playoff tallies last season — a partnership that has been instrumental in making Toronto’s top line one of the most feared in the NHL.Without Marner, the pressure on Matthews to generate his own scoring chances intensifies.If Matthews isn’t at full strength, Toronto may need to reshuffle quickly. Max Domi is the likely candidate to fill Marner’s spot on the wing, but banking on Domi as a top-line fixture through an entire season — and deep into the playoffs — is far from a sure bet. This uncertainty could push general manager Brad Treliving to explore the market for another top-six forward capable of providing both creativity and finishing touch.Last season told a mixed story. Auston Matthews suited up for 67 games, producing 78 points (33 goals, 45 assists). While impressive by most standards, it was a significant step back from his jaw-dropping 69-goal campaign the year prior. That drop-off, combined with lingering injury concerns, has fueled speculation about whether he can return to peak dominance.For Toronto, the stakes couldn’t be clearer: an in-form Auston Matthews is non-negotiable if the team hopes to contend. His health directly impacts the offense’s rhythm, the power play’s potency, and the confidence of the locker room. Meanwhile, Matthews carries a $13.25 million cap hit and holds a full no-movement clause (NMC), giving him complete control over any potential trade.Amidst all these health update, Sens captain Brady Tkachuk said some things good about Auston Matthews. “I’ve known Auston since I think I was 14 or 15,” Tkachuk said. “And he’s always been so good, and he’s just so funny and such a great guy to be around.” “It was pretty awesome for me to be able to learn from him as a captain, and what makes him himself,” Tkachuk added. “And of course, one of the best players in the NHL.""The countdown to October 8 is ticking fast. For the Maple Leafs, the question isn’t just whether Auston Matthews will be in the lineup — it’s whether he’ll be ready to lead from the first puck drop.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Connor McDavid-style contract tension reportedly brewing for Winnipeg Jets",Auston Matthews' health in spotlight ahead of season opener on October 8.

Craig Berube doesn’t trust Nick Robertson; Maple Leafs $1.82M settlement sparks NHL trade rumors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/craig-berube-doesnt-trust-nick-robertson-maple-leafs-1-82m-settlement-sparks-nhl-trade-rumors/articleshow/123364642.cms,"Nick Robertson’s role with Leafs remains in doubt (Image via: Getty Images)

Why Nick Robertson struggles to fit in Craig Berube’s Maple Leafs system



Maple Leafs re-sign Nick Robertson to a one-year, $1.825M deal! | Instant Analysis

Why Nick Robertson’s goal-scoring doesn’t guarantee him a role with Maple Leafs



The Toronto Maple Leafs have settled with Nick Robertson on a one-year, $1.82 million deal for the 2025-26 season, avoiding arbitration. But the contract has done little to silence speculation about his future. With Toronto reshaping its roster under new head coach Craig Berube, Robertson looks more like a trade chip than a long-term fit.Toronto’s message has been consistent since Berube’s arrival: the Leafs want to change their “DNA.” After nine straight years of postseason exits before the Conference Finals, the organization has embraced a tougher, more physical style of play. Additions like Mattias Macelli and Nicolas Roy are expected to replace Mitch Marner’s offensive production, while Scott Laughton and Dakota Joshua bring grit to the fourth line. Depth forwards David Kampf and Henry Thrun remain options, and prospect Easton Cowan is pushing for a full-time role.In this new structure, Robertson’s profile doesn’t stand out. The 23-year-old winger offers pace and scoring ability but lacks size and physicality, qualities Berube values highly. As analyst Michael Amato noted in his Sportsnet column, it’s “hard to imagine Robertson working his way into head coach Craig Berube’s list of trusted players.”That lack of trust was evident last postseason, where Robertson played just three of Toronto’s 13 playoff games and was often a healthy scratch.Robertson’s numbers suggest untapped potential. He scored 15 goals last season, though 11 came against non-playoff teams, raising questions about his consistency against tougher opponents. Still, his back-to-back campaigns scoring at a 20-goal pace make him an attractive option for clubs seeking middle-six scoring. For a team struggling offensively, Robertson’s speed and shooting could be a bargain at $1.82 million.Elliotte Friedman’s 32 Thoughts podcast pointed to a possible move, while Sports Illustrated’s Jacob Punturi named the Chicago Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings, and Pittsburgh Penguins as logical suitors. Chicago could use him alongside Connor Bedard, Detroit continues to add skill under Steve Yzerman, and Pittsburgh needs affordable scoring to support Sidney Crosby’s final years.Also Read: Connor McDavid and Lauren Kyle’s Muskoka weekend: Inside their Ontario lakeside getaway For Toronto, Robertson may be the casualty of a culture shift.

Jason Brown calls Caleb Williams “gay” as fans pile on with roast reactions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jason-brown-calls-caleb-williams-gay-as-fans-pile-on-with-roast-reactions/articleshow/123365818.cms,"(Image via Getty Images: Caleb Williams)

Jason Brown calls Caleb Williams “gay” over silver nail polish

“Gay.”

Fans react with pure trolling energy



The NFL preseason gave us a little unexpected drama off the field, and it had nothing to do with a touchdown. Bears rookie QB Caleb Williams showed up rocking silver nail polish before the game. The reporter tweeted about it, noting that fans believed the color was symbolic, silver nails for the silver Lombardi Trophy. But instead of joining in on the hype, Jason Brown jumped into the conversation with a one-word reply that sent the internet spiraling.According to fans, the silver was a symbolic nod to his ultimate goal — the Lombardi Trophy. But instead of celebrating the gesture, Jason Brown jumped into the conversation with a one-word reaction that immediately set the internet on fire:That’s it. One word, but enough to hijack the whole conversation.For context, Jason Brown isn’t new to stirring the pot. He has a reputation for blunt takes and online shock value, which makes his remark unsurprising but it doesn’t mean fans let it slide. Instead of piling on Caleb Williams, the replies quickly flipped against Brown himself.Most of the reactions weren’t serious debates, they were straight-up roast sessions.Fans turned Brown’s comment back on him, mocking how he always finds a way to stay relevant.Instead of anyone questioning Caleb’s style choice, the overwhelming majority of fans just laughed at Brown.Caleb Williams didn’t address the post and probably won’t. For him, silver polish is just another extension of the same personal style he showed at USC. What started as a symbolic gesture from Caleb Williams ended up becoming another Jason Brown controversy. But unlike his coaching days, this time the coach didn’t control the play.Beyond the viral exchange, this moment feeds into a bigger shift in the NFL. Younger stars like Caleb Williams are embracing individuality whether it’s nail polish, jewelry, or bold fashion fits before games. While some “old-school” voices like Jason Brown clearly don’t approve, the new era of athletes sees self-expression as part of their brand and confidence.Also read - “No skips”: Zoë Kravitz raves about Taylor Swift’s 'The Life of a Showgirl' album revealed on Travis Kelce’s New Heights podcast","Bears rookie QB Caleb Williams showed up rocking silver nail polish before the game.

Tyler Shough vs. Spencer Rattler: More than a battle

Why the city feels his fight

Spencer Rattler’s journey has never followed a straight line. Once crowned the future of college football, then benched and forgotten, the quarterback now finds himself at the heart of the New Orleans Saints’ most dramatic storyline. His preseason performances—flawed yet fearless—have reignited a debate about whether the former high school prodigy can finally turn his career into the redemption saga he has been chasing for years.Rattler entered Oklahoma with superstar billing, the kind of recruit who graced magazine covers before throwing an NFL pass. But college football’s spotlight is unforgiving. After a promising start, his stumbles cost him the Sooners’ starting job and his reputation as a sure-fire first-rounder.Transferring to South Carolina gave him a second chance. There, he stitched together gritty performances, silencing doubters with a late-season surge that proved he wasn’t done. The Saints noticed enough to draft him in the fifth round of 2024, a quiet nod that his story wasn’t over yet.When Derek Carr’s injury pushed Rattler into the spotlight last fall, the rookie did not flinch. In seven appearances—six of them starts—he logged 1,317 passing yards, four touchdowns, and five interceptions.The numbers carried blemishes, but he set a franchise rookie record for passing yards, an achievement that carried weight inside the locker room.Head coach Dennis Allen later reflected, “He got thrown into the fire, and he didn’t shrink. That matters in this league.” Those moments, however, were just the opening notes of a longer symphony Rattler is still learning to conduct.The 2025 preseason has transformed Rattler from placeholder to headline. Against Jacksonville, he entered late, fired a 20-yard touchdown to Dante Pettis, then bulldozed into the end zone himself for a two-point conversion that secured a 17–17 tie. He closed with 199 passing yards, one touchdown, and one interception—stats that hinted at chaos but also courage.“Spence doesn’t play safe, he plays bold,” Pettis said after the game. “That’s the kind of quarterback guys rally around.” In a city that thrives on resilience, Rattler’s brand of daring has begun to resonate with fans who crave fight as much as finesse.The Saints’ quarterback competition has become more than a depth chart dispute. Tyler Shough, a rookie with polish and pedigree, has shown consistency in his early preseason snaps. Yet Rattler’s story drips with something less tangible but equally powerful—edge. He embodies the athlete who has been knocked down and refuses to stay there.Analysts note that both quarterbacks bring different flavors: Shough’s structure versus Rattler’s improvisation. For New Orleans, the decision could shape not only the offense but the team’s identity moving forward.New Orleans has always embraced fighters, from storm survivors to street musicians improvising against the odds. In Rattler, fans see a mirror of that spirit—someone who was written off but refuses to fade. Whether he wins the starting job or not, he has already reminded the league that his story is far from finished.The preseason may be a proving ground, but for Spencer Rattler, it feels like destiny calling again—louder, sharper, and impossible to ignore.Also read: Joe Milton’s inaccuracy is silently wrecking Dallas Cowboys receivers’ roster chances","Spencer Rattler entered Oklahoma with superstar billing, the kind of recruit who graced magazine covers before throwing an NFL pass.

Cam Heyward holds in during training camp as veteran Steelers players seek new deals

Chris Boswell, the Pittsburgh Steelers’ veteran kicker, has ended his hold-in and returned to the field during the team’s preseason game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Saturday, August 16, 2025. This move comes after weeks of speculation regarding his contract status. With 41 field goals made in 2024, leading the NFL , Boswell is starting his 11th season with the Steelers under contract until 2026. Boswell's contract, signed in 2022, puts him outside the top ten highest-paid kickers in the league, even if he had an amazing performance last season.Chris Boswell started the game and also after a touchdown by teammate Brandon Johnson in the preseason game against the Buccaneers. His presence on the field shows his preparedness for the coming season, even though he didn't try a field goal in this game.Clearly indicating his desire for a contract correction, Chris Boswell's hold-in approach, where a player attends team events but abstains from games or practice, was a clear sign.His performance in 2024, converting 41 of 44 field goals and all 35 extra points, earned him his second Pro Bowl selection and first-team All-Pro honors.Also Read: “Just don’t be Travis Hunter”: Dennis Rodman slams NFL star’s controversial relationship with wife Leanna Lenee One Steelers veteran, Chris Boswell, is negotiating his contract.

Should his contract circumstances not be resolved, he has indicated he will miss regular-season games.The circumstances of both Boswell and Heyward show the difficulties seasoned players confront when their performance exceeds their remuneration.

As one lifelong fan outside AT&T Stadium remarked, ""I just want a quarterback who doesn’t make me nervous in August. ""Eagles fans continue to exemplify unwavering loyalty. A recent NFL Fan Loyalty Report revealed that Philadelphia fans top the league in road game attendance, comprising 47% of the crowd at away games. Their passion is palpable, with every game scrutinized and every play analyzed. As one season-ticket holder quipped, ""We don't do quiet support."" This intensity is not born out of hostility but from a deep-seated love for the team.In Kansas City, the preseason is a celebration. Chiefs Kingdom fills Arrowhead Stadium with red, turning each game into a festive occasion. Fans' enthusiasm extends beyond the field, with viral moments featuring Patrick Mahomes' family dancing in the stands. The focus is less on evaluating backups and more on extending the dynasty's joy, making each preseason game a cherished event.New York Jets fans approach the preseason with cautious optimism. The return of Aaron Rodgers has reignited dreams of success, yet every incomplete pass at practice sparks nervous commentary. As one diehard fan admitted, ""It's hard not to brace for disappointment."" This blend of hope and apprehension encapsulates the emotional tightrope that defines the Jets' fanbase.Raiders fans have redefined loyalty. A recent study highlighted that Las Vegas Raiders fans travel the farthest, averaging 575 miles per game during the 2025 season. Their commitment is unwavering, with many viewing the preseason not as a mere warm-up but as an integral part of their identity. As one fan proudly stated, ""We show up, no matter the record.""The 2025 NFL preseason has underscored a profound truth: the game's most powerful force isn't always on the field; it's in the stands. From Chicago's hope to Dallas's panic, from Philadelphia's passion to Kansas City's joy, the emotions of fans have taken center stage, reminding us that the NFL is not just a sport; it's America's most emotional theater.Also read: Joe Milton’s inaccuracy is silently wrecking Dallas Cowboys receivers’ roster chances","The 2025 NFL preseason has evolved into a theater of raw emotion where every snap, touchdown, and misstep is felt deeply by fans.

Cody Rhodes Will Reportedly Play Guile in Street Fighter Movie

A Hairstyle That’s Basically a Character

The Cast of Street Fighter Movie Is Stacked

Andrew Schulz bringing Dan’s chaos energy

Fighting Game Movies Are Having a Glow-Up

The Hype Is Real

The Street Fighter movie is shaping up to be pure fan-service gold, and the latest update has fans buzzing. Cody Rhodes , WWE’s “American Nightmare,” is stepping into the role of Guile, complete with the character’s legendary flat-top haircut. Yes, that high-and-mighty military cut is officially headed to the big screen, and it’s already stealing the spotlight.Casting Cody Rhodes as Guile is kind of genius. He’s got the physique, the intensity, and that all-American soldier vibe. But Street Fighter fans weren’t going to be sold unless one detail made the cut (literally): Guile’s hair.And guess what? It’s happening. Rhodes’ silhouette on set revealed the unmistakable flat-top, and fans instantly knew that this was Guile.Guile’s haircut isn’t just a style; it’s a personality. The flat-top has been part of his identity since Street Fighter II dropped back in the ’90s. It screams discipline, attitude, and “Sonic Boom” energy.For Rhodes to pull this off, he doesn’t just have to act like Guile; he has to wear Guile. And judging by early sneak peeks, the look is locked in.The movie isn’t just banking on one good haircut. The lineup is stacked:Add Cody Rhodes as Guile to that mix, and this feels less like a video game movie and more like a WrestleMania crossover event.Rumors even have Andrew Koji and Noah Centineo playing Ryu and Ken, which would lock down the core of the franchise.Video game movies have been hit-or-miss for decades, but the tide is turning. Mortal Kombat is revving up with Karl Urban as Johnny Cage, and now Street Fighter is leaning hard into faithful fan service.Getting Guile’s hair right may seem small, but it’s the kind of detail that shows the creators get it. They’re not cutting corners; they’re giving fans the real deal.We still don’t have the full trailer or official stills, but one shadowy reveal of Rhodes’ flat-top was enough to spark memes, fan edits, and a wave of “take my money” tweets.If the rest of the movie delivers on this level of detail, Street Fighter could finally break the “curse” of video game adaptations and give fans the over-the-top action they’ve been waiting for.Cody Rhodes stepping into Guile’s boots and haircut is more than just casting news. It’s a signal. Street Fighter isn’t just reimagining its characters for Hollywood, it’s bringing them to life as faithfully as possible. And if Rhodes can nail the attitude to match that flat-top? Consider this movie a critical hit.","WWE’s “American Nightmare,” is stepping into the role of Guile. Rhodes’ silhouette on set revealed the unmistakable flat-top haircut.

Battlefield 6 open beta has just ended yesterday, but it ended with absolute bang. This whole beta phase was able to notch up a mammoth player count of over half-a-million players, which is absolutely astounding for a beta version.It’s quite true that the past two weekends have been totally devoted to Battlefield 6, and it will be hard for many to move on from that as this game will only be playable again on and after October 10, 2025, when the game gets fully released. However, there are really some pretty great FPS games for you to play until Battlefield 6 gets released to quench your thirst. Here are the five of them:Valorant is a completely different game from Battlefield 6, with only the “FPS” tag common in both. The gunplay mechanism is also way contrasting between these two titles, but there is a reason Valorant is in this list.With over 25 distinct agents and unique abilities of each one, scattered in four different categories, this tactical 5v5 shooter is undoubtedly one of the most played games right now. Just like CS2, two teams collide each other on taking control of map sites, one restricting another one from destroying the sites by detonating a bomb called Spike.Another exciting FPS title but breaking the military-style barrier, Apex Legends is one of most popular games in the world right now. The game features a huge array of characters with each having different abilities.Not only that, Apex Legends is based on a futuristic setting, that means everything around you - maps, buildings, weapons, vehicles - are going to be ultra modern and exciting to access.Delta Force is the reincarnation of the classic title which came over two decades ago. The game is already available on PCs and is releasing on consoles on August 19, 2025. This is a free-to-play FPS title with extraction-based 3v3v3 game modes.Those who really like realistic military simulators, are definitely going to fall in love with this game as well because Delta Force holds a heavy and serious gameplay vibe, which is the core concept of the Battlefield franchise since day one.Its inclusion might surprise many fans keeping in mind Battlefield 2042 might be the worst installment of this iconic franchise. However, as Battlefield 6 open beta just ended, DICE has incorporated some great new content in Battlefield 2042 to hook the players with this game.BF2042 has recently received a sudden update which brought so many fan favorite aspects like the Lynx Sniper Rifle, the SU-25TM Frogfoot and many more. Not only that, the premium Battle Pass in BF2042 is absolutely free now.There is no doubt that Call of Duty Black Ops 6 and Warzone is at the no 1 spot in the list. It’s has been a long-standing battle between Call of Duty and Battlefield 6 over the debate of which one is better.As the release date of Black Ops 7 is also seemingly falling just after Battlefield 6, we are really up for another mouth-watering battle. Then, why not try out Black Ops 6 before the release of BF6, as it features everything - a great Campaign, thrilling Multiplayer modes and breath-taking Zombies.","Battlefield 6 open beta has just ended yesterday, but it ended with absolute bang.

NFL underdog Tyson Bagent shocks Chicago as the Bears suddenly boast the league's best quarterback duo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-underdog-tyson-bagent-shocks-chicago-as-the-bears-suddenly-boast-the-leagues-best-quarterback-duo/articleshow/123365228.cms,"Tyson Bagent turns preseason into statement night (Image credits: IG/X)

From small-school shepherd roots to stealing the show in Chicago

How Tyson Bagent made Ben Johnson’s new offense look effortless

From internet cult hero to Chicago’s most unexpected quarterback threat

What Tyson Bagent’s rise really means for the Bears’ future and the NFL

The Chicago Bears’ 38–0 preseason demolition of the Buffalo Bills was expected to be Caleb Williams’ coronation at Soldier Field. Instead, Tyson Bagent—the undrafted quarterback from Shepherd University—delivered 205 yards and a touchdown, turning a routine exhibition into a reminder that Chicago may have the NFL’s most intriguing quarterback depth.Two years ago, Bagent was an unknown rookie fighting for a roster spot. On Saturday, he ran Chicago’s offense with precision, extending drives and punishing Buffalo’s defense. His performance wasn’t just impressive—it was proof that small-school pedigree doesn’t limit NFL potential. In a sport obsessed with draft status, Bagent continues to rewrite the script.What separated Bagent was how comfortably he worked inside Ben Johnson’s new system. Quick reads, crisp timing, and fearless throws downfield kept the offense flowing. “He’s confident, he’s decisive, and he makes the offense click,” Johnson said. The trust from a first-year head coach signals that Bagent is more than an understudy—he’s a reliable driver of this scheme.Bagent’s value extends beyond preseason box scores. In a league where losing a starter can sink an entire season, the Bears have security others envy.“With Tyson, we know we’re in good hands if his number gets called,” receiver Olamide Zaccheaus said. That kind of assurance makes him one of the most valuable No. 2 quarterbacks in football.Last season, “Bagent Mania” felt like a quirky fan movement celebrating an underdog. Against Buffalo, it transformed into something more serious. His composure and accuracy suggest staying power, and that could spark debates about how central he might become to Chicago’s long-term plans. He is no longer just a novelty act; he is a problem defenses must prepare for.Preseason often gets dismissed as a tune-up, but for Bagent it feels like a turning point. His poise and production have made him one of the most intriguing storylines of August. For the Bears, it’s a luxury dilemma: Williams may be the franchise face, but Bagent has shown the spotlight in Chicago can’t belong to just one quarterback.Also read: Joe Milton’s inaccuracy is silently wrecking Dallas Cowboys receivers’ roster chances","Tyson Bagent, an undrafted quarterback from Shepherd University, has been one of the most intriguing storylines of August.

Pop sensation Madison Beer has once again found herself at the center of attention, this time for reasons beyond music. The 26-year-old, discovered after Justin Bieber shared one of her early YouTube covers, has grown into a global star with Grammy nominations and millions of fans worldwide. Recently, she was photographed alongside Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert on the set of her upcoming music video, fueling a fresh wave of speculation.With over 40 million Instagram followers and chart-topping tracks like Reckless and Make You Mine, her influence extends far beyond the stage. Now preparing to release her third studio album, she continues to redefine her space in pop culture. The sight of Herbert, a 6-foot-6 NFL star, at her video shoot only added more intrigue, leaving fans to wonder what lies ahead.While nothing has been confirmed, this isn’t the first time Beer’s relationships have made headlines. With her career reaching new heights, interest in who Madison Beer is dating continues to be a trending topic.Madison Beer has been in the public eye since her teenage years, and along with her rise as a singer, her love life has remained a topic of fascination. From early romances that ended in heartbreak to her current relationship built on safety and trust, here’s a look back at the men she has been linked to over the years.Madison’s first high-profile relationship was with Vine star-turned-musician Jack Gilinsky. They met through mutual friends and dated for about two years. Their breakup in 2017 turned difficult after an audio clip surfaced, leading Madison to warn fans, “Don’t make the same mistakes I did—your safety is never worth it. No matter what, no one deserves to be treated that way.” It was a painful chapter, but one that helped her step into a stronger sense of self.In 2017, Madison was briefly linked to Brooklyn Beckham after the two were seen together in Los Angeles. She later clarified that they were never official, explaining she couldn’t manage a long-distance relationship once Brooklyn moved to New York. Their short-lived fling was more of a youthful spark than a lasting romance.Madison’s on-and-off relationship with club promoter Zack Bia lasted for about a year. The breakup appeared messy, with Madison tweeting, “Oof I rlly owe myself the biggest apology for puttin’ up w sht I never deserved.”* However, out of the heartbreak came art—her widely loved track “Selfish” is rumored to have been inspired by this chapter in her life.Rumors swirled in 2020 that Madison was more than friends with YouTuber David Dobrik, thanks to her frequent appearances in his content. Both insisted they were never romantically involved, though their playful banter left fans curious. On his podcast, when Madison asked, “So, have you ever rejected me?” David cheekily denied it, putting the rumors to rest.Madison’s most enduring relationship began with TikTok star Nick Austin in 2020. They went public in 2021 when Nick posted a heartfelt birthday message calling her “the love of my life, my best friend, my dream girl, my soulmate.”Unlike her earlier romances, this one has been built on stability. Madison told InStyle in 2023, “I’m super happy within my relationship, and I feel really safe, and I feel like I’m with someone I consider my best friend.”As her career edges toward a new milestone with an upcoming 2025 album, Madison admits she and Nick are “going to figure this all out, hopefully together.” In her own words, she’s a “lover girl”- someone who loves deeply, holds on tightly, and values relationships as anchors in her extraordinary life.Also Read: NFL insider Adam Schefter makes bold prediction on Cleveland Browns quarterback situation amid crowded roster battle","Madison Beer has been linked to a number of men over the years.

Adam Schefter’s bold Browns QB room prediction



Kevin Stefanski weighs Browns' QB room battle ahead of Week 1



The Cleveland Browns may have named Joe Flacco as their starting quarterback, but the situation under center is far from settled. With Kenny Pickett, Dillon Gabriel, and Shedeur Sanders also in the mix, ESPN insider Adam Schefter dropped a surprising take that could reshape how the team approaches the regular season. His bold prediction adds another layer of intrigue to what is already one of the NFL’s most complex quarterback battles.Adam Schefter suggested on Monday that Cleveland may break from tradition and carry four quarterbacks into the season. While rare in today’s NFL, his reasoning was clear: “Quarterbacks are currency.” In other words, the Browns might keep all four in-house, creating flexibility if trade opportunities arise down the line.This possibility became more realistic after Cleveland’s offseason of aggressive quarterback moves. The team traded for Kenny Pickett in March, sending a 2025 fifth-round pick and Dorian Thompson-Robinson to Philadelphia, where Pickett had spent the previous year backing up Jalen Hurts during the Eagles’ Super Bowl run. Soon after, the Browns secured Flacco’s services, adding veteran experience to the roster.Then came the draft, when Cleveland selected Dillon Gabriel in the third round and Shedeur Sanders in the fifth. That aggressive strategy has left the team with one of the deepest quarterback rooms in the league—though depth can also spark uncertainty. With Flacco entrenched as the starter for now, the Browns face difficult choices about how to handle the rest of their signal-callers.Head coach Kevin Stefanski has emphasized that a decision on the starter will not drag much longer. “We will name a starter. It’s going to come this week,” Stefanski confirmed via the team website. He added that every quarterback is expected to prepare like a starter, underscoring the competitive tone inside the locker room.While Flacco, at 40 years old, has been taking the bulk of first-team reps, injuries have clouded the picture for his competitors. Shedeur Sanders impressed in the preseason opener against Carolina before suffering an oblique injury. Dillon Gabriel returned from a hamstring issue to start against Philadelphia, while Pickett has also been nursing a hamstring strain, limiting his practice work.Tyler Huntley was added to ease the burden, and Deshaun Watson remains sidelined with a devastating Achilles injury. The final preseason test against the Los Angeles Rams on Aug. 23 could determine who sticks.Whether Cleveland actually keeps all four quarterbacks, as Schefter predicts, or trims the roster to a more conventional number, one thing is certain: the Browns’ QB room is set to be one of the NFL’s most fascinating storylines heading into Week 1 against the Cincinnati Bengals.Also Read: Are Travis Hunter and Leanna Lenee really divorcing?

This new phase of his life garnered reactions from his fellow NBA players as well as his fans. LeBron James has taken up a new sport. On the golf course, he has been spotted sharing footage of himself swinging a club and jokingly acknowledging how much he loves the game. It all started on July 4, when he stated on social media that it was only his second day ""of officially trying this.""That day, the NBA pro reportedly displayed a stiff, arm-heavy swing that instantly drew criticism. Given that he was new to the sport, his drives weren't too bad. A video of his most recent swing was also shared, and he described golf as ""a mind f**k to say the least.""In his Instagram post, he also mentioned that it was only Day 2 and implied that it would require patience and humility to learn to play golf. This caused a lot of his fellow NBA players to react. Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry was one of them.His humorous and playful mimicry of LeBron James’ swing during this year's Lake Tahoe tournament immediately gained attention. He later said:“Unbelievable impersonation of my guy Bron’s follow-through in the golf swing. But we all want to welcome LeBron James to the world of golf because the game needs you, big fella.”His initial reaction, however, was heartfelt and cordial. He left a message on Instagram following LeBron James' initial golfing days in the first week of July and wrote:“Welcome. We’ve been waiting for you.”The long-standing rivalry between the two future Hall of Famers took on a funny twist because of the light-hearted exchange.Also read: Is LeBron James switching to golf?

Former Penguins star reportedly linked to blockbuster trade discussions with Canadian team amid rising NHL buzz,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/former-penguins-star-reportedly-linked-to-blockbuster-trade-discussions-with-canadian-team-amid-rising-nhl-buzz/articleshow/123374719.cms,"Former Penguin Jared McCann linked to Canadiens in potential trade talks (Jay LaPrete/AP)

Why Former Penguin Jared McCann makes sense for Montreal



Contract value and long-term impact



The Montreal Canadiens are once again stirring the NHL rumor mill, with reports suggesting they have set their sights on Former Penguin Jared McCann. According to Michael DeRosa of The Hockey News, the Seattle Kraken forward has surfaced in high-stakes trade discussions as Montreal continues its hunt for a reliable second-line centre. With McCann’s versatility and proven scoring ability, the Canadiens see him as an intriguing option who could balance out their developing roster.At 29, McCann offers the perfect mix of experience and production. His 40-goal season with the Kraken proved that he can be a lethal offensive weapon, even when used primarily as a winger. Earlier in his career with the Florida Panthers and Pittsburgh Penguins, he showed his comfort down the middle, giving Montreal a chance to deploy him either as a centerman or on the wing depending on their needs.The Canadiens’ depth has long been a concern, and McCann could serve as a quick fix behind captain Nick Suzuki. A line featuring McCann alongside rising star Ivan Demidov could inject both creativity and finishing power into the offense. Add Patrik Laine—if healthy—or promising forward Zach Bolduc to the mix, and Montreal suddenly looks far more dangerous in the attacking zone.Even on special teams, McCann could be a difference-maker.Slotting into a second power-play unit with players like Noah Dobson, Cole Caufield, or Laine would give the Canadiens an extra scoring punch. His ability to shift seamlessly between playmaker and finisher makes him a versatile asset few teams can ignore.Beyond his skill set, McCann’s contract adds to his appeal. With two years remaining at $5 million per season, he comes at a fair price for a player who can slide into multiple roles. Should prospect Michael Hage eventually claim the second-line center spot, McCann could easily shift back to the wing without losing value.While a touch older than Montreal’s core, McCann fits neatly within their competitive window. His arrival would not only provide veteran steadiness but also help accelerate the Canadiens’ push toward legitimate contention in the Eastern Conference. For a team seeking balance and firepower, McCann could be the missing piece.Also Read: Missing Gavin McKenna could actually reward Penguins with a historic draft consolation prize that shakes the NHL landscape",Former Penguin Jared McCann linked to Canadiens in potential trade talks.

Taylor Swift sparks frenzy with Super Bowl halftime show rumors: Fans call it the most anticipated ever,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/taylor-swift-sparks-frenzy-with-super-bowl-halftime-show-rumors-fans-call-it-the-most-anticipated-ever/articleshow/123372268.cms,"Taylor Swift at the Super Bowl? Rumors ignite over possible 2026 halftime show performance in San Francisco.

Rumors about Taylor Swift performing at the Super Bowl halftime show heat up



Fans call it the “most anticipated halftime show ever”



Fans believe Taylor Swift is next in line to headline

Travis Kelce’s NFL connection makes the rumors even juicier



When Taylor Swift sneezes, the internet breaks. So when whispers started floating around that the pop superstar could headline the upcoming Super Bowl halftime show in San Francisco, fans didn’t just get excited, they lost their collective minds. Swift is already the biggest touring artist in the world, fresh off her record-smashing Eras Tour. Add the NFL’s biggest stage into the mix? That’s a cultural earthquake waiting to happen.Speculation picked up after fans began connecting dots between Swift’s ongoing global schedule and the timing of the San Francisco Super Bowl. With her being one of the most in-demand performers on the planet, many argue the NFL couldn’t dream of a bigger halftime booking. While no official confirmation has come from Swift’s camp or the league, the internet has already decided it’s happening and they’re acting accordingly.It’s no secret the NFL and Swift have had a lot of crossover moments lately, thanks to her high-profile relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Last season, Swift became a regular sight in luxury suites on NFL broadcasts. Now, fans think the league may finally cash in on the “Swiftie effect” in the biggest way possible.Twitter (X) and TikTok instantly blew up with reactions once the rumor spread. Some Swifties were already mapping out potential setlists—“Style,” “Shake It Off,” and “Anti-Hero” are topping the wish lists. NFL fans, on the other hand, were quick to admit this might break viewership records.Many compared the hype to past iconic halftime moments like Beyoncé in 2013, Shakira and J.Lo in 2020, and Rihanna’s unforgettable pregnancy reveal in 2023.Adding fuel to the fire is the fact that Swift’s boyfriend, Travis Kelce, is one of the NFL’s biggest stars. If she takes the halftime stage, the crossover of football fans and Swifties would be complete. Imagine the camera cutting to Kelce mid-performance, it would be meme history in the making.For the league, this wouldn’t just be a performance. It would be a business goldmine, with Swifties tuning in worldwide, some for the very first time in Super Bowl history.For now, this is still just speculation. Neither Taylor Swift nor the NFL has announced anything officially. But judging from the way fans are reacting, even the mere possibility has created a storm of anticipation.Also read - “No skips”: Zoë Kravitz raves about Taylor Swift’s 'The Life of a Showgirl' album revealed on Travis Kelce’s New Heights podcast","Rumors about Taylor Swift performing at the Super Bowl halftime show heat up the internet.

Poll Who do you think will have a bigger impact in the ODI series? Kwena Maphaka Dewald Brevis Temba Bavuma Keshav Maharaj

South Africa's spearhead Kagiso Rabada has been ruled out of the three-match One-Day International series against Australia, starting Tuesday, due to inflammation of his right ankle, Cricket South Africa (CSA) said in a statement.""The 30-year-old underwent a scan on Monday, which confirmed the extent of the injury. He will remain in Australia and undergo rehabilitation under the supervision of the Proteas medical staff,"" CSA said.Rabada has been replaced by 19-year-old Kwena Maphaka, who was sensational in the recently concluded T20I series.Maphaka picked up nine wickets in three games.The left-arm pacer already has two ODI caps and could be in the starting eleven as South Africa seek to put up a strong challenge against Australia.Brevis, meanwhile, is almost certain to make his ODI debut after a stellar T20I series saw him smash a rollicking 41-ball century in Darwin and follow it up with a blazing half-century in Cairns to finish with 180 runs, making him the top run-scorer across both teams.South Africa’s ODI skipper Temba Bavuma said he had been impressed by Brevis’ form. ""It's always exciting when you see the young faces. Obviously, the big talk has been on Brevis, (he's been) putting up his hand and showing what he is capable of.(I'm) excited to see what he can also bring within the one-day stuff,"" said Bavuma to reporters on Monday.The ODI series also marks Bavuma’s return to competitive cricket after leading South Africa to their maiden ICC World Test Championship crown at Lord’s in June.

Bayley sends a playful reaction to Naomi’s pregnancy announcement with Jimmy Uso



Naomi’s WWE exit opens major opportunity for women’s roster to capture the vacant Women’s World Championship



WWE fans got a mix of joy and shock on Monday night when Naomi revealed she is expecting her first child with Jimmy Uso . The announcement meant her 35-day reign as WWE Women’s World Champion came to an abrupt end, but the moment turned into a celebration across the locker room and beyond. In her attempt to add a twist to the news, Bayley couldn’t resist poking fun at Jimmy with a cheeky Instagram post.Bayley has recently sent a playful jab aimed at Jimmy Uso. “EVERYBODY SAY THANK YOU BIG JIIIIMMMMMMMMMMMM HAHAHAHAHAHA ⚠️🍼” Bayley wrote, attaching a monochrome picture with Jimmy Uso. Her post on Instagram came right after the couple’s public announcement of their special news. Bayley’s post appears to warn Jimmy playfully about his wife and the baby as she added “proceed with caution” emoji alongside a baby feeding bottle. The big laughter also appears to be a nod to Naomi’s iconic laughter.The reveal first appeared in a preview of Stephanie McMahon’s What’s Your Story? podcast, featuring Naomi and Jimmy. Once the live crowd saw the clip, Naomi leaned straight into her heel persona, booting Raw GM Adam Pearce out of the ring to soak up the chants of “Baby Uso.”“I’m pregnant and I’m having a baby,” Naomi said in the podcast segment. She didn’t stop there, adding: “All of y’all in the locker room should be thanking one person.They should be thanking Big Jim. Without him, they know they wouldn’t have had a chance taking this title off of me.”Fans roared in approval, while the champ promised she would reclaim her spot when she returns. Her warning was blunt: “Whoever has that title when I do, I strongly advise you to proceed with caution.”Naomi’s reign may have been short, but it was significant. She won Money in the Bank in June, cashed in at Evolution to steal the spotlight from Rhea Ripley and IYO SKY, and defended her belt in a hard-hitting SummerSlam triple threat. By the time Raw rolled around this week, her run was over, but her influence was undeniable.Now, the question is, who fills the void?

NEW DELHI: Not even heavy Mumbai rains can keep Rohit Sharma indoors. The Indian cricket star was recently spotted driving his sleek black Range Rover through the city, enjoying the monsoon showers in style.The Range Rover is one of Rohit’s trusted rides, but it’s far from the only head-turner in his enviable garage.Just a couple of days ago, the 37-year-old added a fiery red Lamborghini Urus SE to his growing luxury car collection and wasted no time taking it out for a drive. Fans quickly gathered on the streets of Mumbai as Rohit, behind the wheel of the brand-new SUV, cruised through the city.What caught everyone’s attention, apart from the stunning machine itself, was the personalised number plate — 3015. The digits carry deep personal meaning, combining his daughter Samaira’s birthday (December 30) and son Ahaan’s birthday (November 15).Together, the numbers add up to 45, Rohit’s iconic jersey number. His previous car carried the number 264, a nod to his world-record ODI score against Sri Lanka in 2014.The Urus SE itself is a beast on wheels, packing 800hp and 950Nm of torque, capable of hitting 0–100 km/h in just 3.4 seconds.Priced at around Rs 4.57 crore (ex-showroom), it is the latest jewel in a collection that also includes a BMW M5 (Rs 1.99 crore), Mercedes-Benz GLS 400d (Rs 1.58 crore), Mercedes-Benz S-Class (Rs 1.98 crore), and a Range Rover HSE LWB (Rs 3.68 crore).While his garage continues to expand, Rohit’s cricketing journey is entering a decisive phase. Having last turned out for the Mumbai Indians in IPL 2025, he is gearing up for what could be his final international series. With the Bangladesh ODIs in August cancelled, India’s next assignment will be a three-match ODI series in Australia from October 19–25, where Rohit is expected to make a return.For now, the former India captain seems to be striking the perfect balance — working hard on his cricket while enjoying life off the field, whether it’s in the nets or behind the wheel of his favourite cars.",Rohit Sharma was recently spotted driving his Range Rover through Mumbai.
