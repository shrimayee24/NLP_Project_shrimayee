He who fails to guard against calamities beforehand will repent, too late,

When disaster strikes

The wordcan be traced back to the Spanish ‘, an uproar. Yet, what it leaves behind is never noise; but silence, of those who lose their kin in the crush of humanity.History has recorded such incidents too often. In AD 80, Josephus wrote of Passover pilgrims in Jerusalem. A soldier’s taunt, a moment’s panic, and thousands were trampled into death. Since then, the list has grown: Mecca Tunnel, Mina, Baghdad Bridge, Kumbh Mela, New Delhi Railway Station, Bangalore’s RCB rally, Pushpa II’s premiere in Hyderabad—and now, Karur, where more than 40 lives were snuffed out, some of them children. What began as a gathering of hope became that of despair. The patterns are cruelly familiar: crowds underestimated or dismissed, brittle barricades, packed paths, first responders unable to reach the fallen.Unanswered questions linger. Why was a narrow venue chosen for a rally that all locals knew could not hold such a crowd? Why did the leader arrive late? Were miscreants planted to unleash chaos? None of these questions find easy answers. But each whispers of carelessness that borders on disrespect for life itself.German physicist Dirk Helbing once coined the term. When there are more than six bodies in every square meter, even the slightest motion unleashes a shock wave. At that moment, people are pushed, pulled, and crushed like twigs. To survive, experts advise: move with the crowd, place your arms around your chest to avoid breaking of your ribcage by pressure, avoid walls and do not scream as you have to conserve oxygen, stay upright as much as possible. But what of the children of Karur? Could they shield their tiny chests? Could they ‘flow’ with the sea of bodies? No instruction manual can answer their shrill cries, now frozen in our memories.And the cycle repeats. Each time, organizers and authorities play their parts in the tragedy; grief is turned into blame, inquiries, and eventual forgetting.But the families who watched their children disappear in the chaos will never forget. Their silence will remain an open wound.In the corporate world, there is a practice called a. Before any launch, be it product, marketing or event, a group brainstorms on all that could go wrong, lists down what would be the worst that can happen and then mitigation is planned. What if our leaders, event organizers, and police, practiced this? What if duty meant not afterthoughts but foresight?Thiruvalluvar, with timeless clarity, had already given us the warning in—Do not neglect your duties:The verse is not just a counsel; it is a mirror. Every stampede reflects our failure to heed it. Karur is not merely an accident—it is an indictment of negligence, of blindness to the obvious.The cries beneath the crowd may be hushed, but they will not vanish. They ask us, relentlessly: will we continue to learn nothing, or will we at least listen to wisdom that has echoed for centuries?","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124292845,imgsize-87400,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/124292845.jpg"

How Arthur Jones’ net worth translates in 2025

Breaking down Arthur Jones’ NFL contracts and career earnings

Arthur Jones’ net worth is once again being discussed following his untimely death at 39 on October 3, 2025. The former Baltimore Ravens defensive tackle, remembered as a Super Bowl champion and older brother to UFC legend Jon Jones and Pro Bowler Chandler Jones, built a successful NFL career that brought in millions. But as with many professional athletes, the reality of his take-home wealth is more complicated than the headlines.As financial experts often note, headline contract numbers don’t equate to net worth. Federal and state taxes, agent fees, and union dues typically cut nearly half of a player’s paycheck. After these deductions, plus living expenses and the uncertainties of retirement, Jones’ wealth would have settled into a more modest figure.Factoring in his career contracts, time missed, and standard post-career costs, a conservative estimate places Arthur Jones’ net worth in 2025 at roughly $4 million to $8 million. This range reflects the large Colts contract, offset by injuries and early release, along with the assumption of prudent — but not flawless — investing.Jones entered the league in 2010 as a fifth-round draft pick of the Baltimore Ravens. His breakout came during the 2012 season when he played a pivotal role in the team’s Super Bowl XLVII victory over the San Francisco 49ers. That success helped set the stage for his biggest payday.In March 2014, Jones signed a five-year contract with the Indianapolis Colts worth around $33 million, averaging nearly $6 million per season. While the deal was lucrative, his time in Indianapolis was impacted by injuries and a suspension, which reduced the total payout he received compared to the full contract value. The Colts released him in 2017, after which he signed briefly with Washington before retiring.Taking into account his Ravens salary, the Colts deal, and his final season in Washington, Jones’ career earnings likely exceeded $20 million in gross NFL cash.Also Read: “Arthur wouldn’t hesitate to…”: Jon Jones’ touching remarks gain new meaning after tragic passing of Super Bowl champion Arthur Jones While financial curiosity surrounds his career, Arthur Jones is ultimately remembered for his impact on the field and in the locker room.

For fans, teammates, and family alike, Jones’ legacy is less about spreadsheets and more about his role as a champion, a mentor, and a brother.","Arthur Jones' net worth is once again being discussed following his untimely death at 39 on October 3, 2025.

Kristi Noem promises visible ICE presence at Levi’s Stadium to protect fans and uphold the law

Bad Bunny’s U.S. tour boycott sparks debate and draws sharp criticism from Homeland Security

Noem frames Super Bowl LX security as a matter of national pride and law-abiding behavior

NFL faces the challenge of balancing global star power with scrutiny from federal authorities

As Super Bowl LX nears at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has pledged a strong law enforcement presence to ensure the stadium remains safe and orderly. Her remarks follow the growing controversy over Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny , who has chosen to skip U.S. shows over concerns about potential ICE raids. Noem’s criticism of the NFL for featuring the reggaeton star has escalated tensions, highlighting the intersection of law enforcement, entertainment, and politics at one of the nation’s most-watched sporting events.Speaking to Benny Johnson on “The Benny Show,” Noem emphasized that immigration authorities would be stationed throughout the stadium during the big game. “I have the responsibility to make sure everybody who goes to the Super Bowl has the opportunity to enjoy it and to leave safely. That’s what America’s about,” she said. She stressed that the focus would remain on law-abiding fans who come to celebrate football while staying safe.Puerto Rican music sensation Bad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, announced last month that he would avoid performing in the United States due to concerns over ICE enforcement at his shows. Noem did not hold back when asked about the NFL’s decision to feature him in the halftime show. “They suck, and we'll win,” she said. “They’re so weak. We’ll fix it.” The controversy has fueled a wider discussion about how sports, entertainment, and politics collide, with fans and critics weighing in across social media.Beyond criticizing the NFL, Noem described her approach to Super Bowl LX safety as a reflection of American values. “We’ll be all over that place,” she told Johnson, signaling a hands-on enforcement presence. She underscored that attendees should respect the law and enjoy the event responsibly, positioning safety and patriotism as central to the festivities.Noem’s comments place the NFL in a difficult spot, forcing the league to navigate the tension between star-studded halftime shows and federal oversight. While the NFL thrives on entertainment and spectacle, this controversy underscores how high-profile events can quickly become entangled in political and cultural debates, forcing leagues to balance popularity with public and governmental expectations.As excitement builds for Super Bowl LX, the combination of heightened security, ICE presence, and Bad Bunny’s absence adds an unexpected layer to the event. What was meant to be a celebration of football now carries political undertones, cultural debates, and public scrutiny. With federal authorities monitoring the stadium and discussions over performer choices dominating headlines, this Super Bowl LX promises to be remembered for more than just touchdowns and halftime performances.Also read: Fans can't get enough of Peter, Kirk Herbstreit’s adorable golden retriever, who stole smiles and hearts at Rams vs. 49ers","Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has pledged a strong law enforcement presence at Super Bowl LX.

Israeli talents set to make NBA debut amidst war in Gazi

“Yeah, I mean, that’s all it’s about. It’s keeping the main thing, the main thing.

I only can control what I can control, and I don’t have any say or thought as to really what’s going to happen outside of the game. And I’ll leave that to be, and I’ll just focus on the game as best I can.”

“We do expect some. We’re approaching the game like any other preseason event, but are prepared for any disruptions.”

The NBA world might loom in the shadow of Israel's ongoing war in Gazi at the expense of two new rookies for the Brooklyn Nets from the country, Danny Wolf and Ben Saraf. While it may attract negative criticism and potential protests from certain angry people in the country, the two talented players are solely focused on their upcoming debut in the basketball world.This Saturday, the Brooklyn Nets' preseason opener will feature them squaring off against Hapoel Jerusalem B.C. at the Barclays Center.

They said,Ben Saraf was born in South Africa but grew up in Israel, while Danny Wolf currently holds both Israeli and United States passports. They have no military backgrounds and have solely focused on making it big in the NBA. The duo has already managed to impress the basketball world, as they are set to debut at a very young age of 19 (Saraf) and 21 (Wolf).Moreover, it will be the second time that the city of Brooklyn, New York, has hosted a team from Israel in the last three years. While it will surely be a big night for the Israeli stars, it remains to be seen if this decision could be a huge headliner for the Nets or a major mistake on their end.Also read: NBA Abu Dhabi Games 2025: Philadelphia 76ers and New York Knicks take on Arabian Gulf

Bucky Irving, running back for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, is likely to miss the Week 5 game against the Seattle Seahawks because of a foot injury. According to ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler, Bucky Irving is “expected to miss Sunday’s game” and might also sit out the next game versus the San Francisco 49ers.

The Bucs need clarity soon.Bucky Irving picked up the foot injury during Tampa Bay’s Week 4 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. He was seen using crutches and wearing a walking boot in practice midweek.He also missed all sessions this week. Head coach Todd Bowles confirmed Bucky Irving underwent an MRI, and the team hopes to know more by Friday. If Irving cannot get out of the boot by then, he likely won’t play Sunday.Jeremy Fowler’s report also warns that Bucky Irvingmeaning Week 6 could also be uncertain.

Luka Doncic's Injury Update for Preseason Game 1

Los Angeles Lakers’ Strategy Without Luka Doncic

What Fans Can Expect from the Lakers

, will not play in tonight’s preseason opener against the Phoenix Suns. He has also been ruled out of the October 5, 2025 matchup against the Golden State Warriors. The decision was reached jointly by Doncic and the Lakers organization, with a focus on pacing his return after a demanding offseason and prioritizing long-term readiness. Luka Doncic ’s summer was highlighted by his participation in the 2025 EuroBasket tournament, where he put on dazzling performances. Among his standout moments was a 39-point game in the quarterfinals against Germany. While his efforts carried Slovenia deep into the competition, the heavy workload prompted the Los Angeles Lakers to manage his preseason minutes carefully to avoid fatigue and possible setbacks.The 26-year-old guard shed weight in the offseason and has been gradually adjusting during Lakers training camp. Head coach JJ Redick has emphasized a new focus on conditioning and injury prevention following the team’s disappointing first-round playoff exit last season. The approach is designed to have Doncic at peak strength when the regular season begins, rather than pushing him into early preseason contests.While not dealing with any serious issues, Doncic did sustain a minor right knee contusion during EuroBasket. He noted needing therapy after a knock in one of the games but reassured fans that he was fine. This minor injury further supports the Lakers’ cautious stance, especially given that this will be Doncic’s first full season with Los Angeles after being acquired in a blockbuster trade from Dallas earlier in the year.With Luka Doncic sitting out, the Los Angeles Lakers will use the preseason opener against the Suns to experiment with rotations and build chemistry among the roster. The focus will be on evaluating supporting players and testing lineups, ensuring the team develops balance while waiting for their new franchise centerpiece to take the court.Although Doncic won’t play in the first two preseason games, fans can expect him back later in the exhibition schedule or by the regular season opener. The team’s long-term strategy is to keep him healthy and fully prepared for the grueling 82-game campaign.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers vs Phoenix Suns Preseason Game 1 Key Injury Report (October 3, 2025): Who’s Playing, Who’s Out, and More Luka Doncic’s absence from the first two preseason games is not the result of a serious injury, but rather a strategic move by the Los Angeles Lakers.

Despite McDavid's potential for a record-setting salary, the Oilers face significant cap challenges due to existing high-value contracts. McDavid prioritizes winning a Stanley Cup, suggesting he might accept less to ensure a competitive team, forcing Edmonton to find creative financial solutions.

Frank Seravalli weighs in on Connor McDavid’s future after Kirill Kaprizov’s $136M deal

Connor McDavid’s goal: The best team around him with a genuine chance to win

Level of concern with McDavid potentially leaving?

Connor McDavid’s dilemma is to win now or cap later

Connor McDavid’s future with the Edmonton Oilers has once again taken center stage in NHL contract discussions. After Minnesota Wild forward Kirill Kaprizov secured an eight-year, $136 million extension this week, the attention immediately shifted to what Edmonton’s superstar captain might demand when his next deal comes up. The Oilers are already weighed down by big-money contracts that could limit how far they can go for McDavid.While McDavid is expected to set the market whenever he signs, Edmonton’s financial structure complicates the picture. The Oilers are currently locked into expensive long-term commitments. Leon Draisaitl’s $14 million salary, Evan Bouchard’s double-digit deal, and Darnell Nurse’s $9.25 million contract already consume a large portion of the cap. On top of that, goaltender Stuart Skinner is due for a significant raise in the near future.NHL insider Frank Seravalli highlighted this challenge, stating, ""They can't, I don't think the Edmonton Oilers can afford to go more. In fact, I don't think on their cap that they can really even afford to go 17 million, um, because of all the other deals that they've got."" Edmonton's potential with McDavid is limited due to cap pressure.That kind of financial squeeze makes it difficult for the Oilers to entertain numbers north of $17 million annually — a figure that insiders believe McDavid could command. Even with the NHL’s salary cap set to climb in the coming seasons, Edmonton’s roster construction leaves little margin to maneuver.Oilers GM Stan Bowman addressed Connor McDavid’s contract situation on Wednesday, admitting there is still no clarity on whether the superstar captain will have a new deal before the regular season begins. Bowman revealed via TSN that ongoing talks with McDavid’s agent Judd Moldaver remain frequent but offered no firm timeline, stressing, “I don’t like to make predictions, we’ll see where it goes.”Beyond the financial puzzle, McDavid’s decision may come down to competitiveness. The Oilers have enjoyed success over the past two years, but McDavid understands that aging players, a thin prospect pipeline, and limited draft picks can quickly derail momentum.For McDavid, the question is not simply “how much” but “how far can this team go?” He has made it clear throughout his career that chasing a Stanley Cup defines his priorities. That means Edmonton must strike a balance — paying its franchise player while still building the depth required to compete against the league’s best.Kaprizov’s blockbuster contract raised expectations league-wide, but McDavid’s case is different. He may ultimately accept less than his maximum value if it ensures the Oilers remain contenders. At the same time, Edmonton must find creative ways to manage the salary cap or risk losing the most dominant player in the game.McDavid’s decision will shape not just the Oilers’ future, but also the landscape of the NHL. His contract situation is now one of the defining storylines of the league.Also Read: Leon Draisaitl’s wife Celeste Desjardins just can’t stop reliving her dream wedding; Labels it “Happiest day of our lives”","Connor McDavid's contract future with the Edmonton Oilers is under intense scrutiny following Kirill Kaprizov's massive deal.

McIlroy’s Calm Amid Chaos



A Front-Row View From Zola



Fan THROWS beer at Rory McIlroy’s wife at Ryder Cup

Italian football icon Gianfranco Zola has praised McIlroy for his calmness and dignity throughout the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black when this Northern Irish golfer was subjected to waves of hostility from sections of the American crowd. McIlroy stood tall throughout withstanding relentless pressure and putting in one of his best Ryder Cup showings that sealed the 15-13 win for the Europeans.Ryder Cup has always had the glare of being a heated edition, yet this one crossed so many boundaries. European players were singled out for heckling, booing, and demeaning chants, more so McIlroy. At one point, McIlroy's wife, Erica Stoll, was taunted harshly, and an American gentleman tossed a cup of beer in her direction, leaving her sobbing.The abuse went a notch higher when the host of the Ryder Cup Heather McMahan led a rude chant against McIlroy, an event which ultimately led to her resignation; and on another occasion, McIlroy was called a homophobic name as he got ready to play. It aroused massive conversation about fan behavior and the limits of sportsmanship in golfing.Sarcastically and ironically, McIlroy had blown kisses at the hecklers during the first day.However, by the fifteenth tee time on day two, patience had gone beyond McIlroy, refusing to putt until the fans cooled off. Even then, his demeanor was extremely calm.Making an eye-catching 4-1-0 record in his matches, the best ever in a Ryder Cup, McIlroy was able to focus his fury and hence play a huge role in Europe's victory.Being a guest at the tournament who, at times, was even allowed to drive a buggy thanks to his affiliation with vice-captain Francesco Molinari, Zola experienced the onslaught of abuse firsthand. In an interview with La Gazzetta dello Sport, the Chelsea legend expressed his dissatisfaction at the concerted efforts to create such a bad atmosphere.""Obviously the fans went too far,"" said Zola. “Some people came to Bethpage too hyped up and then found the wrong way to vent their frustrations with insults and aggression directed mainly at McIlroy, the strongest player. They were afraid.""Praising McIlroy’s response, Zola added: ""Because he's the greatest of them all, he was fantastic, he responded like a gentleman and a champion, as did Shane Lowry, who was playing with him.Not being caught up by hostility, McIlroy's resilience earned points for Team Europe, setting the example to rise above the negativity. According to Zola, the Northern Irishman showed true champions win with talent and character, creating a legacy sometimes far greater than the actual winning.","Gianfranco Zola has praised Rory McIlroy for his calmness and dignity during the Ryder Cup.

The Buffalo Bills have a rich history filled with talented players who earned big salaries for their great work on the field. These stars helped the team win games and set new standards in football play. Many fans want to know the money details behind their heroes, so here are the top five players with the most career earnings while with the Bills.Josh Allen shines as the quarterback who turned the Bills into a strong team with his strong throws and fast runs on the ground. He has passed for more than 167 touchdowns and keeps guiding the group at just 28 years old, with lots more wins ahead.His big money comes from a 2021 deal and a new six-year one in 2025 for $330 million total. So far, Allen has pocketed $232,610,993 from the Bills, topping all others in team records. Plus, his yearly pay now sits high among all league players.Stefon Diggs added exciting catches to the Bills, with 445 grabs for 5,372 yards and 37 scores in only 65 games played. He left after the 2023 season for another squad, but his four years boosted the attack side greatly.Money flowed from changed contracts full of extra bonuses and goals met, adding up to $77,450,882 earned with the Bills.On top of that, Diggs often topped team lists in big numbers, showing his steady top play every time.Jerry Hughes gave solid help on defense for the Bills across nine full years, collecting 350 stops, 117 hits on quarterbacks, and 53 sacks in 144 matches. He started in 2013 after a team switch and grew into a main backup known for lasting long and pushing rivals hard.Deals had many add-ons and bonuses over time, pushing his total take to $71,365,000 from the group. What is more, Hughes built respect as an older guide for the front-line defenders.Tre'Davious White climbed fast to the top cornerback level in the NFL , winning Pro Bowl spots and All-Pro nods in his first six seasons with the Bills. He came back in 2025 after a short time away and has shone since day one as a rookie in 2017.Also Read: NFL to launch pro men's and women's Flag Football Leagues ahead of 2028 Olympics in LA, confirms Commissioner Roger Goodell Contracts packed big payments and extra rewards, leading to $69,062,023 made with the team up to now.

His numbers dropped a bit later on, yet he stayed a scary rusher for passes during those four seasons.A huge six-year pact for $100 million fueled his cash flow to $67,400,000 with the squad. Still, that early-loaded agreement pointed out the ups and downs of spending big on free players.","The Buffalo Bills have a rich history filled with talented players who earned big salaries for their great work on the field.

Maple Leafs roster moves after Scott Laughton injury

Scott Laughton’s career achievements and comeback outlook

News of Scott Laughton's injury left Maple Leafs fans concerned, as he is due to miss a couple of weeks. The Maple Leafs confirmed that Laughton, who showed promise in the preseason games, had suffered a lower-body injury during the Thursday night game against the Detroit Red Wings. This roadblock comes at a very crucial time, with Laughton eager to make his mark in the full season with Toronto following a trade that moved his young career on a new trajectory with the team.On the morning of Friday, the Maple Leafs announced that Laughton would be week-to-week with a lower-body injury. The 27-year-old forward was acquired last season at the trade deadline for Nikita Grebenkin and a first-round pick. Laughton was struggling at the start of his 20 regular-season games, yet he began to show glimpses in the postseason of the player Toronto hopes to be relying on this season.Laughton has been pretty straightforward about how a mid-season trade affected his performances, but the whole summer spent in Toronto allowed him to settle. In good momentum going into the season with 20-year-old Easton Cowan and fan favorite Steven Lorentz on the fourth line, Laughton would undergo another unexpected injury that brought more uncertainty and forced the Leafs to reconsider their final roster choices for Kampf, Jarnkrok, and Robertson, all in line for first-team action.Entering the contract's back end, Scott Laughton was set from the get-go to make an immediate impact and earn an extension. A Toronto product, he has embraced the city and the team as a whole, building chemistry with the younger guys like Cowan while also serving as a veteran presence. The fans have embraced him for the energy, effort, and heart he puts on the ice, and the feeling of his absence is huge in that respect.Hopefully, he can get well soon, and that will allow him to get back on the ice, strengthening the Leafs. His presence on the ice is going to be vital to Toronto's hopes this season in terms of scoring depth and leadership on the lower lines.A temporary Laughton injury spells trouble for Toronto. Fans and teammates alike are wishing for his speedy recovery and return to the lineup to continue helping on and off the ice.Also Read: Why Jack Roslovic turned down Edmonton: Inside the NHL free agent decision",Scott Laughton suffered a lower-body injury during the Thursday night game against the Detroit Red Wings.

Kayvon Thibodeaux could be traded as Giants assess defensive line depth

San Francisco 49ers face urgent need for a top pass rusher after Nick Bosa injury

Kayvon Thibodeaux, the New York Giants’ defensive end, is reportedly attracting interest from the San Francisco 49ers. Since being chosen fifth overall in 2022, Thibodeaux, 24, has demonstrated bursts of dominance. After star pass rusher Nick Bosa sustained a season-ending knee injury in Week 3, the 49ers, though, find themselves in serious difficulty. To keep their pass rush current, the 49ers need a great defensive end. According to sources, San Francisco could make a trade offer if the Giants decide to make Thibodeaux available.The New York Giants have several talented defenders, including Brian Burns and rookie Abdul Carter. While Thibodeaux has been productive, some experts believe the Giants could consider trading him if the right offer comes in.Reports indicate they may seek a draft pick or a player able to instantly help the team (Yahoo Sports). Through the first four games of the 2025 season, Thibodeaux has eight quarterback hits and 2.5 sacks. Having several choices on their defensive line, the Giants might use a trade to round off their team and cover other important areas.San Francisco’s defense has been strong, but losing Nick Bosa leaves a big gap. Bryce Huff and other players have stepped up, but the team still needs an elite edge presence.

Los Angeles Lakers vs Phoenix Suns Preseason Game 1: Betting Recommendations and Prop Plays

What to Expect from the Los Angeles Lakers vs Phoenix Suns Matchup

The NBA preseason tips off in style with thegame this Friday at the Acrisure Arena. More than just a warm-up, this matchup sets the stage for the 2025-26 season with two historic Western Conference rivals testing new lineups, strategies, and depth. Both teams enter with different trajectories from last year, but the intensity of their rivalry ensures an exciting start to the basketball calendar.Early predictions give the Los Angeles Lakers a slight advantage, largely due to their past success against the Suns and their consistency in recent meetings. Playing at home further boosts their chances. Still, Los Angeles is dealing with key absences - most notably LeBron James - which could disrupt their rhythm. That gives Phoenix, with Devin Booker leading the charge and new head coach Jordan Ott implementing his system, a real shot at an upset or at least covering the slim +1.5 spread.Oddsmakers currently list the Lakers as the betting favorite with moneyline odds near -159, while the Phoenix Suns sit as underdogs at around +135. The spread hovers between -1.5 and -2.5 in favor of Los Angeles, signaling how close this contest could be. The projected total points range from 219 to 229, which makes sense for a preseason opener that will likely feature faster tempos, experimental rotations, and less focus on defensive structure.For bettors, Phoenix covering the spread or a moneyline play on the Suns could be a smart value given the Lakers’ shorthanded roster.The Lakers wrapped up the 2024-25 season with a 50-32 record, capturing the Pacific Division title and finishing third in the West. Their playoff run ended earlier than hoped, but they remain a top-tier squad. Statistically, they sit in the middle of the pack across most categories but excel at free-throw shooting and three-point efficiency. Even without LeBron or Luka Doncic logging heavy preseason minutes, their depth and the growth of role players should keep them competitive.The Suns finished last season at 36-46, missing the playoffs after ranking 27th in defensive rating. Their offense, however, was respectable with an offensive rating of 114.7, largely powered by Booker. The offseason brought major change, with Jordan Ott stepping in as head coach and fresh roster pieces intended to fix their defensive flaws. Expectations are on building cohesion and discipline while maintaining offensive firepower.Historically, the Lakers have held a slight upper hand, particularly on home court. Their last preseason clash ended in a dramatic overtime tie at 113-113, showing just how tightly contested these games can be. A notable trend is Los Angeles’ inability to pull away comfortably, as 11 of their last 14 games were decided by three points or fewer. Meanwhile, Phoenix battled through an eight-game road losing streak last season, underlining both their struggles and their potential to bounce back with the right adjustments.• Back the Suns to cover the +1.5 spread for better safety.• While the Lakers’ moneyline is reasonable, bettors should monitor final lineup confirmations.• The total points over 219.5 looks appealing given the likelihood of open, free-flowing play.• Player props: Devin Booker’s scoring over is worth attention, while Austin Reaves’ assist or points totals could present value.• Keep an eye on rookies and bench players - preseason often gives them the chance to shine past expectations.Preseason basketball isn’t about wins and losses as much as it is about experimentation and rhythm. For the Suns, Ott may stress defensive schemes while evaluating how new players fit his system. For the Lakers, the absence of superstars means testing depth and refining rotations will be a priority. Fans can expect stretches of high-scoring runs, loose defensive setups, and flashes of brilliance from rising talents eager to prove themselves.The Suns vs. Lakers preseason opener promises more than just warm-up basketball. With new coaching philosophies, roster shake-ups, and the backdrop of a classic rivalry, this matchup provides both fans and bettors a first taste of what the 2025-26 season could bring. Expect a tight, fast-paced contest full of intrigue, strategy, and fresh storylines.","The NBA preseason tips off in style with the Los Angeles Lakers vs Phoenix Suns match-up this Friday at the Acrisure Arena.

NHL insider Elliotte Friedman explains why Jack Eichel could eclipse Mitch Marner’s $96M deal

Kirill Kaprizov Secures the Bag | 32 Thoughts

Jack Eichel’s career, impact, and Golden Knights’ future

The Jack Eichel contract rumors are setting the NHL aflame with a Golden Knights offseason ahead. Eichel enters the final year of his eight-year, $80 million deal, and there was an insider telling me his next might be above the $96 million that Marner's got. Fans and analysts on both sides of the river are abuzz on what it might mean for Vegas and the league in terms of salary, tax advantages, and top-notch Eichel performance as the Knights' No. 1 center.NHL insider Elliotte Friedman spoke on the 32 Thoughts podcast to give some inside insight, stating that the Golden Knights view Jack Eichel as a franchise cornerstone and a future Stanley Cup winner. ""I heard that in the summer, when they signed Marner, they knew that Eichel was going to go past him...They recognized Eichel, the number one center, a Stanley Cup team, and a hugely valuable player for them.""According to Friedman, some teams were expecting Vegas to target $13 million amounts for Eichel, but sources say the Knights might actually be looking at something in the range of $25 million combined with Marner's salary. In and of itself, this huge extension is justified in terms of Eichel's value last season, which also included a career-high 94 points in 77 games.Further, Nevada's no-state-tax implication would make even higher salaries conceivable than if they had to pay taxes like in a high-tax state like Minnesota, where Kaprizov signed his huge deal. Friedman stated, ""I think Eichel knows he's not going to get to 17, but where's the sweet spot? You know, one of the things that Vegas is a no-tax state, Minnesota is a high-tax state.""Jack Eichel, with his goal-scoring, playmaking, and leadership abilities, has rapidly emerged as the heart of the Golden Knights' offense. Going into the last year of his current contract, he is very much focused on the season and holds that the contract negotiations tend to take care of themselves if one keeps their focus on the right things. GM Kelly McCrimmon has also stressed that re-signing Eichel is a priority, thus making the upcoming negotiations critical to the long-term success of the team. Given Eichel's record-breaking stats and leadership qualities, as well as Vegas's own strategic advantages, this deal could be a landmark contract in the NHL.If Jack Eichel’s next contract ends up in excess of Mitch Marner's $96 million contract, then it will set a new standard for great centers in the NHL. With the insiders' input, Eichel's career-high season, and the Golden Knights' commitment, the fans definitely have something to look forward to as the league looks on as this huge negotiation unfolds.Also Read: Why Jack Roslovic turned down Edmonton: Inside the NHL free agent decision","NHL insider Elliotte Friedman spoke on the 32 Thoughts podcast to give some inside insight, stating that the Golden Knights view Jack Eichel as a franchise cornerstone.

Philadelphia 76ers are being cautious with Joel Embiid's health

Joel Embiid is major instrument in Philadelphia 76ers success during upcoming season

Joel Embiid of the Philadelphia 76ers, has been sidelined due to a left knee injury since March of 2025. Right before the regular season was to end for the 2024-25 season, the injury changed the course of the game for Embiid as well as the Sixers. While the player did give a positive update during his NBA Media Day appearance, and has also traveled to Abu Dhabi with the team for their preseason game against the New York Knicks, the team is taking a cautious approach with their star center.The Philadelphia 76ers are prioritizing Joel Embiid's long-term health, making sure that he's fully recovered from the arthroscopic surgery performed in April, before he comes back to play for the team full on. Embiid's injury history has led the team to adopt a very meticulous recovery strategy, focusing more on his rehabilitation rather than forcing him to participate in the preseason games against the New York Knicks.Embiid did travel to Abu Dhabi for the NBA Abu Dhabi Games 2025, one of the seven overseas showcases by the league this season, but he did not play the first game, and is not likely to make an appearance in the second one either.Although he did appear healthy during the NBA Media Day, and looked to be in good spirits, the Sixers are not rushing to get him playing just yet.The upcoming season for the Philadelphia 76ers is very important. Their last season ended without the team qualifying for the Playoffs, so it will be important for the Sixers to try and make better play in the upcoming season. And for that, they will need their star players in perfect form, without an injury threatening their playtime.Joel Embiid will be at the centre of their strategy to get to the top. So even if he does not play during the preseason, the Sixers main aim would be to have him perfectly healthy before regular season begins later this month. The Sixers unfortunately lost their first game in Abu Dhabi against the New York Knicks, and will be facing them again tomorrow, on October 4. After that, their first game in the regular season will be against the Boston Celtics on October 22.Also Read: NBA Abu Dhabi Games 2025: Philadelphia 76ers and New York Knicks take on Arabian Gulf","Philadelphia 76ers are being cautious with Joel Embiid's health.

The French full-back has scored twice already and continues to create attacking overlaps, giving the champions another weapon on the flanks. His arrival from AC Milan looks like a perfect fit.At Al Nassr, Joao Felix has quickly developed a strong connection with Cristiano Ronaldo . The Portuguese forward has scored five goals in four matches, placing him among the league’s leading scorers. His quick adjustment has added another threat to the Al Nassr attack. This already had plenty of firepower.Meanwhile, Mateo Retegui has offered Al Qadsiah the scoring edge they needed.Along with three goals, including a debut brace, and the Italian striker has been among the most effective forwards. And his high shot count reflects a player keen to test defenses and make his presence felt.Joshua King has been another pleasant surprise, and joining Al Khaleej with little fanfare, the Norwegian international has four goals already. His sharp finishing has been vital in giving the team a strong start to the season.Enzo Millot has strengthened Al Ahli’s midfield. The French playmaker made an instant impression by assisting Ivan Toney on his debut.

The former Arsenal striker has three goals and an assist. This shows his experience and leadership. His presence has helped the new club settle quickly, securing three straight wins before the break.Late arrivals have also played their part.

Jon Jones once believed Arthur Jones could succeed in the UFC

Remembering a champion and mentor beyond football

The Baltimore Ravens community and NFL fans are mourning the loss of former defensive lineman Arthur Jones , a Super Bowl champion and beloved teammate, who died at the age of 39. The Ravens announced his passing on Friday, while his alma mater Syracuse University also confirmed the news. Neither organization provided details on the cause of death.Arthur Jones was not only remembered for his powerful presence on the field but also for the bond he shared with his brothers—former UFC heavyweight champion Jon Jones and four-time Pro Bowl defensive end Chandler Jones. In the wake of his death, an old interview featuring Jon Jones resurfaced, shedding light on the deep respect and admiration he carried for Arthur.Back in 2012, Jon Jones reflected on Arthur’s mindset and dedication, suggesting his brother had the potential to transition from the NFL to mixed martial arts. Speaking to Sports Illustrated’s Jeff Wagenheim, Jon said: “Arthur wouldn’t hesitate to pursue mixed martial arts. The dedication that it would take for him to get down to the 265 heavyweight limit. I think it would transform him mentally into the warrior he needs to be to compete at a high level.And he would be faster than ever and mentally a stronger person. I think he would make a great contender, if not champion, in the UFC.”The heartfelt remarks now resurface as a poignant reminder of the strength, discipline, and larger-than-life personality that defined Arthur.Arthur Jones carved out a memorable career in the NFL, highlighted by his performance in Super Bowl XLVII when the Ravens defeated the San Francisco 49ers.

Jay-Z ’s partnership with the NFL and why his choices matter

Bad Bunny takes center stage after months of speculation



The Taylor Swift buzz that almost took over



For decades, the Super Bowl halftime show has grown into a cultural juggernaut, rivaling the game itself in global attention. The spectacle isn’t just about music—it’s about legacy, representation, and cultural impact. But the question fans often ask is: who actually decides which superstar gets the call?Since 2019, when Jay-Z and his company Roc Nation entered into a groundbreaking partnership with the NFL, he has been the creative force behind the halftime lineup. Producer Jesse Collins recently explained the setup bluntly: “It’s a decision that Jay makes. Since we’ve been onboard with that show, he’s made it every year, and it’s been amazing. He’s always picked right.”This collaboration was born out of a dual purpose—elevating entertainment and driving social justice initiatives within the league. From Shakira and Jennifer Lopez in 2020 to Kendrick Lamar’s record-breaking performance in 2025, Jay-Z’s selections have consistently delivered cultural relevance and blockbuster performances.During the Week 4 clash between the Cowboys and Packers, the NFL and Apple Music dropped the news fans had been waiting for: Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny will headline the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans.The artist, known for global hits and for championing Latino culture, embraced the moment with a powerful statement: “What I’m feeling goes beyond myself. It’s for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown … this is for my people, my culture and our history. Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL.”His selection continues a proud tradition of Latino stars shaping the halftime stage, from Gloria Estefan and Enrique Iglesias to Shakira and J Balvin.While Bad Bunny’s announcement thrilled millions, many fans had been betting on Taylor Swift to finally headline—especially after her engagement to Travis Kelce stole NFL headlines. Even commissioner Roger Goodell leaned into the speculation, saying, “We would always love to have Taylor play. She is a special, special talent. And obviously she would be welcome at any time.”Also Read: Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski vows ICE crackdown at 2026 Super Bowl after NFL picks Bad Bunny for halftime show For now, though, the stage belongs to Bad Bunny.

Kris Knoblauch rewarded for stabilizing the Oilers and reaching back-to-back finals

Why this extension means more than just keeping a coach

The Edmonton Oilers have made a bold move to solidify their leadership, officially handing head coach Kris Knoblauch a multi-year contract extension that runs through the 2028-29 season. While fans continue to speculate about Connor McDavid ’s long-term future in Edmonton, the team has made it clear that Knoblauch is the man they trust to steer them toward a Stanley Cup.When Knoblauch replaced Jay Woodcroft during the 2023-24 season, the Oilers were in disarray. Few expected the then-unproven coach to guide the team back to relevance, let alone to consecutive Stanley Cup Final appearances. But with a 94-47-10 record under his leadership, he has turned skeptics into believers.Despite falling short of lifting the Cup, the Oilers’ consistency under Knoblauch has given the organization confidence in his system and approach. By extending him long-term, the front office has signaled stability during a period of uncertainty that has been overshadowed by questions surrounding McDavid’s future.Extending Knoblauch is more than a contract decision—it’s a message to the locker room and the fan base.Edmonton is betting that continuity behind the bench can push an already talented roster over the hump. The extension also protects the Oilers from instability if McDavid’s contract situation lingers, ensuring the team has a steady guiding hand regardless of roster changes.“Ultimately, the team took a chance on a very unproven coach when they announced him as the replacement for Woodcroft, but he's proven to be a very capable coach and the one that this team sorely needed,” reads part of the organization’s statement of support.Also Read: “McDavid wants to win so bad”: Oilers left sweating as Connor McDavid uses contract talks to demand culture shift For Oilers fans, this deal may not ease the uncertainty around their superstar captain, but it does provide reassurance that the franchise is committed to building a foundation capable of winning hockey’s ultimate prize.",The Edmonton Oilers have extended head coach Kris Knoblauch through the 2028-29 season.

Cathy Engelbert addresses Napheesa Collier’s criticism and Caitlin Clark comments



CBA talks, officiating review, and Cathy Engelbert’s future



WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert faced pointed questions Friday after Minnesota Lynx star Napheesa Collier accused her of failing league players. Speaking before Game 1 of the WNBA Finals, Engelbert acknowledged tensions but rejected calls for her resignation, insisting she remains committed to guiding the league through its most important labor fight in decades.Earlier this week, Napheesa Collier blasted Cathy Engelbert as presiding over “the worst leadership in the world,” accusing her of ignoring player voices and accountability. Collier also claimed Engelbert made dismissive comments about Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark’s off-court earnings during a private conversation.Engelbert flatly denied the claim. “Obviously, I did not make those comments,” she said. “Caitlin has been a transformational player in this league. She’s been a great representative of the game. She’s brought in tens of millions of new fans to the game.”Still, Engelbert admitted the friction cannot be ignored. “I was disheartened to hear that some players feel the league and that I personally do not care about them or listen to them,” she said. “If the players in the ‘W’ don’t feel appreciated and valued from the league, we have to do better and I have to do better.”The commissioner confirmed she has been in touch with Collier and that the two will meet next week. With the current collective bargaining agreement set to expire at the end of October, Engelbert acknowledged that emotions are running high across the league.Engelbert reiterated that her focus is on reaching a new CBA that addresses salaries, benefits, and player safety. “We continue to meet and have important conversations with the players’ association,” she said. “We want to significantly increase their salary and benefits, while also supporting the long-term growth and viability of the WNBA.”She added that if a deal cannot be reached by October 31, an extension is possible to avoid disrupting the 2026 season. The WNBA has never experienced a lockout in its history, though players have warned that option is on the table.Officiating, another major flashpoint, will also be reviewed this offseason by a new “state of the game” committee involving players, coaches, and executives. “It’s pretty clear that we’re misaligned currently on what our stakeholders want from officiating,” Engelbert admitted.Despite the mounting criticism, Engelbert dismissed speculation about stepping down. “I’ve never been a quitter,” she said. “I’ve never shied away from tough situations.”Engelbert said she intends to remain at the helm while acknowledging the urgent need to rebuild trust with the athletes driving the WNBA’s growth.Also Read: ""Be a great leader, and she's not in any sense""- Sophie Cunningham slams WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert for her remarks on Caitlin Clark",Cathy Engelbert says she is committed to guiding the WNBA through its most important labor fight in decades.

Tyreek Hill’s visit becomes a rallying moment as Dolphins gear up for Week 5 clash

Facing adversity head on McDaniel emphasizes team unity over individual loss

Locker room energized by Hill’s presence and renewed focus on team goals

Just four days after undergoing major surgery that ended his season, star wide receiver Tyreek Hill surprised his teammates with an emotional visit to the Dolphins’ facility. Head coach Mike McDaniel revealed during his pre–Week 5 press conference that Hill’s brief presence injected an instant boost of morale. For a team grappling with the loss of one of the NFL ’s most explosive playmakers, Hill’s visit was more than symbolic — it was a reminder that leadership and spirit extend far beyond the playing field.McDaniel described Hill walking into the team meeting unexpectedly, catching everyone off guard. “Tyreek was in the building today,” McDaniel shared. “He came into the meeting and made sure the guys were staying motivated — reminding them to play complementary football, with 11 players moving as one in all three phases.” The visit reportedly sparked applause and smiles across the locker room, proving that even a short appearance from their captain could uplift the team’s energy and focus heading into a critical matchup.While acknowledging the impact of Hill’s injury, McDaniel stressed that the Dolphins’ success relies on collective execution. “When you lose players of that magnitude, it’s never about replacing one person,” he said.“It’s about the execution of the overall group at every position that makes up the difference. And I have a bunch of motivated football players.” He added, “Where there’s adversity, there’s opportunity — and that’s kind of our speed. ” His words reinforced the culture of resilience that the Dolphins are striving to maintain despite a key absence.Hill’s brief but meaningful visit left a lasting impression on his teammates, fueling determination and camaraderie. His message was clear: even though he won’t be on the field, he remains fully invested in the team’s journey. As Miami prepares for their Week 5 matchup, the Dolphins aim to channel the energy from Hill’s visit into execution, connection, and a renewed sense of purpose. For a squad built on speed, cohesion, and belief, Hill’s leadership off the field continues to set the tone.Also read: Fans can't get enough of Peter, Kirk Herbstreit’s adorable golden retriever, who stole smiles and hearts at Rams vs. 49ers","Tyreek Hill surprised his teammates with an emotional visit to the Dolphins’ facility.
