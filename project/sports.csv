600 runs in a day in Tests? England star says...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/600-runs-in-a-day-in-tests-england-star-says-/articleshow/111968972.cms,"NEW DELHI: England vice-captain Ollie Pope has expressed optimism about England's cricket team potentially achieving a score of 600 runs in a single day of Test cricket under favourable conditions.This confidence stems from England's recent performance, including a victory in the second Test against the West Indies at Trent Bridge, where England won by 241 runs.In this match, Pope, along with Harry Brook and Joe Root, scored centuries, marking a historic achievement for England by surpassing 400 runs in both innings for the first time in Test cricket's 147-year history.Pope's belief in England's scoring capabilities is further bolstered by a previous match against Pakistan at Rawalpindi in December 2022, where England scored 506-4 on the first day, facing only 75 overs.According to Pope, the team, under the guidance of coach Brendon McCullum and captain Ben Stokes , has transitioned from a phase of building confidence to aiming for ruthlessness in their gameplay.""I think when Baz (England coach Brendon McCullum) and Stokesy took over, we were a batting unit with, not a lack of experience, but a lack of confidence at the time. At the time it was about building confidence, now it's about hopefully becoming more and more ruthless. Sometimes we might score 280-300 in a day but that's OK and probably because we're reading situations,"" said Pope, as quoted by AFP.The recent series victory against the West Indies, which is England's first since 2022, and the drawn series against New Zealand and Australia in 2023, alongside a 4-1 loss in India, indicate a period of transition and revamp for the England team.""We saw at Trent Bridge, when the lights were on and it started swinging more that was the time just to manage the game a little bit and that's something we want to keep getting better and better at. But there might be a day where we go and get 500 or 600 at some point in the future as well. That's a cool thing to have,"" he added.Key players such as James Anderson, Jonny Bairstow, Ben Foakes, and Jack Leach have been replaced by emerging talents like Gus Atkinson, Shoaib Bashir, and Jamie Smith, who have all made significant contributions to the team's recent successes.""I think there were some big calls and some tough calls to make on guys, but it feels at the minute that we've got a really nice balanced attack and batting line-up as well. We want to give guys confidence and that we're building the team around them, but at the same time, in international cricket there's always going to be pressure for spots. It's been shown in the last few weeks that the guys who have come in have done beautifully and we can keep building from here,"" Pope added, emphasising the balance and confidence within the team.","England vice-captain Ollie Pope has expressed optimism about England's cricket team potentially achieving a score of 600 runs in a single day of Test cricket under favourable conditions.

BENGALURU:was Hardik Singh's emotional appeal to his then skipper Manpreet Singh as the Indian flag went up in Tokyo during the medal ceremony in 2021. He meant they had to convert the bronze medal to gold in Paris. Manpreet has gone from skipper to a senior statesman as India will take the field under the leadership of Harmanpreet Singh .But Hardik's words still echo in the midfield stalwart's ears. That, along with his soon-to-be three-year-old daughter Jasmine Kaur , fuelled the 32-year-old's desire to give the Olympics one last shot.Manpreet along with star custodian PR Sreejesh will make his fourth Olympics appearance. From the low of finishing last at the London Games in 2012, to leading India to the podium in Tokyo, the Jalandhar-born seasoned campaigner has seen it all. Although the captain's armband has switched hands, Manpreet reiterates, ""that hasn't changed the commitment or responsibilities I shoulder"".Speaking to TOI about the senior team's journey that began in 2011, Manpreet said, ""It has been a rollercoaster ride. My first Olympics in London was a nightmare. After that we progressed to winning, making the quarterfinals and eventually the podium finish in Tokyo.""Manpreet has realistic targets, and the 2028 Los Angeles Games are not really on the radar.""This is probably my last Olympics. I want to give my best as I don't want to leave with any regrets,"" he remarked. In Paris, Manpreet, a blend of speed and skill, will play a key role as a playmaker. Superior game awareness, effective communication and the ability to switch roles in quick time are Manpreet's qualities which will hold India in good stead.Also, under coach Criag Fulton, Manpreet has evolved. His ability to effect accurate passes is being put to good use and he has also been stepping back to allow youngsters Vivek Sagar and Hardik Singh to move deeper into the opposition's half. ""This is almost the same team that has been playing together since the Asian Games . The youngsters have got enough game-time to blend in. We have been able to understand each other well,"" said Manpreet.Off the field, Manpreet is among the seniors in the team preparing the five debutants for the sporting extravaganza.""Some of us have been sharing our experiences and the challenges from the previous Olympics. At the Games Village, there are thousands of athletes, meeting some of them is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but the message to the youngsters is clear. '(don't get lost in the carnival). This is the most important 15 days of our life.""Among those in the stands in Paris will be Manpreet's wife Illi Saddique and Jasmine. The veteran wants to pull all stops to ensure his daughter remembers him as a hero on the field.""The medal in Tokyo was the beginning of a bigger dream and we have all worked towards it. My daughter will be at the Olympics. I want her to cheer for the country and watch us win a medal. I want her to be proud of me. I sacrificed a lot to be here and serve my country.

The duo provided a stellar start, amassing 122 runs in the first 14 overs, setting a strong foundation for India's innings.Opting to bat first after winning the toss, India capitalized on the opportunity with Hemalatha contributing a valuable 47 runs. The partnership's aggressive approach was instrumental in India reaching a competitive total of 178 for three. Jemimah Rodrigues further bolstered the innings with an unbeaten 28 off 15 balls, enhancing the score with three boundaries in the concluding over.Facing a challenging target, Nepal's pursuit was hindered by India's proficient bowling attack, limiting them to 96 for nine in their allotted 20 overs. The requirement for Nepal to surpass Pakistan's net run rate and secure a semifinal berth necessitated achieving the target within 10 overs, a feat they were unable to accomplish.Deepti Sharma emerged as the standout bowler for India, claiming three wickets for 13 runs. She was well-supported by Radha Yadav and Arundhati Reddy, who took two wickets each, contributing to a formidable bowling performance that stifled Nepal's chase.Nepal's innings was characterized by regular wicket losses, with their top order struggling against India's seam and spin attack. Arundhati Reddy's early dismissal of Nepal's openers set the tone, while Deepti Sharma's all-round performance, including a direct hit, showcased India's dominance in the field.Shafali Verma's innings was a highlight, featuring an array of shots that put the Nepalese bowlers under pressure. Her aggressive batting, marked by 12 fours and a six, was particularly punishing against medium pacer Kabita Joshi and off-spinner Sabnam Rai. Hemalatha, despite a slower start, managed to support the innings effectively, contributing with both boundaries and a six.The match also witnessed moments of resilience from Nepal, including a missed catch opportunity that could have broken the opening partnership earlier. However, India's batting prowess and disciplined bowling ultimately proved too strong for Nepal, confirming India's place in the semifinals alongside Pakistan from Group A.",India beat Nepal by 82 runs to reach semifinals of the Women's Asia Cup T20 tournament. Shafali Verma scored a career-best 81 off 48 balls.

I saw him hug the cup and cry. Rahul Dravid screamed and cried. I saw him enjoy it. I felt that a lot.""Dravid, a batting legend, had never won an ICC title during his playing career.In the days following the T20 World Cup triumph, it was announced that former India opening batsman and double World Cup-winner Gautam Gambhir would succeed Dravid as the new head coach.Gambhir is set to commence his tenure with the upcoming white-ball tour of Sri Lanka, which is scheduled to begin on July 27.Ashwin acknowledged Dravid's accomplishments, even in the face of adversity and disapproval throughout his playing and coaching career, such as the early elimination from the 2007 50-over World Cup.""I want to talk about a person who is sacred. 2007, 50-over World Cup. India gets knocked out. Rahul Dravid, the captain at that point in time. He does not captain the one-day side after that. He has been with the Indian team. If something does not go well, if the Indian team goes out, if they lose a match, immediately, they ask what Dravid is doing,"" said Ashwin.""I know what he has been doing with this team for the past two-three years.

Even when he is just sitting at home, he has been planning how to do this and that,"" he concluded.In the thrilling conclusion of the T20 World Cup 2024, India's batting duo of Virat Kohli and Axar Patel played crucial roles in setting a competitive target. Kohli's impressive knock of 76 runs, combined with Patel's quick-fire 47, helped India reach a total of 176 for 7, bringing them closer to realizing their dream of lifting the trophy.The Indian bowlers faced a challenging task in defending the total, but they held their nerves in a tense finish. The pace trio of Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya and Arshdeep Singh proved instrumental in securing the victory. Bumrah's miserly spell of 2/18, Pandya's crucial 3/20, Arshdeep's euqally critical 2/20 in the death overs suffocated the opposition's chase, ultimately leading to a narrow seven-run win for the 'Men in Blue,' as they clinched their second T20 World Cup title.",Ravichandran Ashwin says he was deeply moved when Rahul Dravid embraced the ICC T20 World Cup trophy and shed tears after guiding the team to their first ICC title in 11 years.

Basically, he's been told (by other boards) that after the Champions Trophy, we (Pakistan) should play a bilateral series against India.

If India are not willing to play in our country, then we shouldn't agree to play the series in another country either,"" he added.The reaction comes amid reports that the Indian cricket team is unlikely to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy in 2025.The BCCI plans to request the International Cricket Council (ICC) to adopt a hybrid model, potentially relocating India's matches to Sri Lanka or Dubai.The ICC Champions Trophy is scheduled for February to March 2025 in Pakistan.Due to tense political relationships, Team India has not played in Pakistan since the Asia Cup in 2008. The last bilateral series between the two nations occurred in 2012-13, with India hosting Pakistan for two T20Is and three ODIs. Since then, their encounters have been limited to ICC tournaments and the Asia Cup.A similar situation arose during last year's Asia Cup, initially planned for Pakistan.

Gautam Gambhir 's plain-speak and Ajit Agarkar 's lucidity are going to make for a heady combo.They clarified certain difficult decisions, but in other cases, they were vague enough to leave room for interpretations.Although neither Gambhir nor Agarkar are particularly large on the outside, anyone in the Indian cricket community will attest to the fact that these are two well-observed, intelligent people whose opinions don't easily shift.They appeared to be prepared to back up their words as they presented a united front at their first joint press appearance.Although Agarkar is officially starting his second year as chairman, this is actually a fresh start for both of them, much like it is for Gambhir, where they can work together to develop a plan for the 2027 ODI World Cup What did one learn most from the joint news conference between Gambhir and Agarkar prior to their Sri Lankan tour?The largest one appears to be workload management.Indian cricket's thorny word will once more control the air, but this time, it's obvious that the rules for bowlers and hitters will differ.""I've said it before, workload management for someone like (Jasprit) Bumrah is important. If you are a batter who is in good form, might as well play all the games,"" Gambhir was as straight as ramrod in his reply when asked about his take on the issue, according to PTI.Although it was widely anticipated that ODI and Test captain Rohit Sharma and top batsman Virat Kohli would miss the three matches in Sri Lanka, their attendance ultimately suggests that both seniors will likely play as many series as feasible.""Now that Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli will play only two formats, I expect them to be available for most games,"" Gambhir addressed the issue with a lot of clarity just like chairman Agarkar was up and ready to explain what went against Hardik Pandya , who was considered to be a natural successor to Rohit, at least in the T20 format.""You (would) want a captain that's going to be more likely to play all the games,"" one couldn't get a more crystal clear answer to a pointed question.What was even more encouraging was that, in contrast to previous selection committee chairs, Agarkar considered the view of the changing room in addition to his instincts on leadership abilities.""""Why Surya was made captain? Because he is one of the deserving candidates. The one we know has been around the dressing room over the last one year, you get feedback from the dressing room a lot.""He has got a good cricketing brain and he is still one of the best T20 batters in the world,"" Agarkar elaborated.One point was made repeatedly during the 27-minute press conference. Stars can't just pick and choose anymore.Pandya's skill set is rare, and Agarkar acknowledged that, but he also made it clear that the selection committee is not to be taken for granted.""Fitness, obviously, has been a challenge for him over the last few years and then it becomes a little bit more difficult for him and even as selectors,"" he said.With same elegance, Agarkar addressed the difficult question about KL Rahul being passed up for captaincy.""I wasn't there when KL was superseded; I wasn't the selector firstly.""Subsequently, the Duleep Trophy came up, and Agarkar made it quite evident that the majority of Indian Test squad candidates, if not all of them, will participate in at least one match of the competition prior to the start of India's unprecedented 10-Test season on September 19.Regarding Ravindra Jadeja , Agarkar clarified that the veteran all-around player was not removed from the ODI squad; nevertheless, his justification did suggest that two players with very similar skill sets might not be included in an ODI lineup.""It would have been really pointless to take both him and Akshar for this short series...So, no, not at all dropped,"" he said on Jadeja.After that, Gambhir had to face the unspoken but significant topic of speculation regarding his connection with Kohli, which the straight shooter dismissed as ""good for TRP.""Although Gambhir may come across as a ""My Way or High Way"" kind of guy, his message was that he wanted to be the one who made sure everyone in the dressing room was pleased.And what qualifies as a happy dressing room?""A winning dressing room,"" as Gambhir put it.",Gautam Gambhir and Ajit Agarkar hold joint press conference ahead of Sri Lanka tour. Both appear to be in sync on key issues such as workload management and captaincy. Both believe Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma will play as many series as possible.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111928328,imgsize-65968,width-400,resizemode-4/111928328.jpg"

The duo laid a solid foundation with a 122-run partnership in 14 overs.Subsequently, S Sajana (10) and Jemmimah Rodrigues (28) contributed to India's total of 178/3, which proved sufficient as Nepal could only manage 96/9 in their 20 overs, resulting in an 82-run defeat.Mandhana acknowledged the importance of providing game time to the middle-order batters, who had limited opportunities in previous matches and the recent South Africa series.""As an opener, you don't get a lot of games where you don't bat. Much needed game time for all the other batters. The middle order hasn't batted in the previous games. The conditions were different and it is always good to have game time under your belt. The middle order didn't get time in the South Africa series as well, so good they could spend some time in the middle,"" Mandhana said during the post-match presentation.Despite India's comprehensive victory over Bangladesh in a recent away series, Mandhana cautioned against complacency, emphasizing the need to approach each opponent with equal focus and preparation.""Not only this tournament, but also in the last five or six months, the preparations started post WPL, there are a lot of fine tuning to be done and we have to keep improving, cannot go into a World Cup under prepared. You don't take any team (semifinal opponents) lightly, we have two days to rest and practice before we go out and apply ourselves,"" she added.Shafali Verma, adjudged the player of the match for her blistering 48-ball 81, attributed her consistent performance to backing her strengths and executing her plans effectively.""Double hundred is big for any batter and I got plenty of confidence from that innings, I wasn't in good form before that but the innings helped me get back my confidence,"" Shafali stated.Nepal's captain, Indu Barma , expressed pride in her team's efforts and acknowledged the valuable lessons learned from their matches against India and Pakistan.""I am proud of my team. The effort we put in, we realised our weakness and will come back stronger. It was a great exposure to play against India. I am happy with my team, after 10 overs the bowlers got good momentum and restricted them to below 200. We got good experience from this tournament by playing against India and Pakistan. We made some good memories,"" she said.Barma praised her team's efforts in restricting India to below 200 runs after the 10-over mark and expressed gratitude for the opportunity to create memorable experiences by competing against formidable opponents like India and Pakistan.","Smriti Mandhana pleased with middle-order batters' performance against Nepal.

Football with its roots tracing back to ancient civilizations, it evolved into a modern game in the 19th century in England. The sport is characterised by its simplicity and universal appeal, requiring minimal equipment—a ball and a playing field. Played between two teams of eleven players each, the objective is to score goals by getting the ball into the opposing team's net.Football's global reach is unparalleled, with millions of fans and players spanning every continent. Football's rich history is marked by incredible goal-scoring feats, and the game's all-time highest goal scorers have left an indelible mark on its legacy. Cristiano Ronaldo leads with an astounding 859 goals, celebrated for his longevity and relentless scoring ability. Lionel Messi, renowned for his vision and technique, follows with 821 goals. Here are the all time highest goal scorers in football 2024.Cristiano Ronaldo holds the record for the most goals scored for Real Madrid and for Portugal, surpassing any other male player at the international level. With a total of 873 goals throughout his illustrious career, Ronaldo's achievements include three Premier League titles, five Champions League titles, and the Euro 2016 championship. Despite turning 38 in February, the former Juventus and Manchester United star remains a prolific scorer, having netted 52 goals in 2023 for Portugal and Al-Nassr. His remarkable goal-scoring record, stemming from his evolution from a quick-footed winger to a dominant striker, sets him apart as the greatest marksman in sporting history.Often hailed as the greatest player in football history, Lionel Messi excels in both scoring and playmaking. The Argentine has amassed over 800 goals in just over 1,000 professional matches. His career highlights include scoring 672 goals for Barcelona, winning seven Ballon d'Or awards, and setting the record for most goals in a calendar year with 91. Messi also holds the record for the most hat-tricks in La Liga, with 36.Josef Bican, a star of Austrian football in the 1930s, amassed 805 goals during his career, which spanned from 1931 to 1955. Bican's prolific scoring came during his time with Slavia Prague and other clubs. Despite various accounts of his goal tally, FIFA’s 2020 commemoration confirmed his impressive total. Bican's career included notable achievements in both Austrian and Czechoslovakian football.Romário, a Brazilian legend known for his clinical finishing, scored 775 goals throughout his career. Starting with Vasco da Gama, Romário went on to shine at PSV Eindhoven and Barcelona, where he was a key player in Johan Cruyff’s “Dream Team” that won the La Liga title in the 1993-1994 season.Pelé, often regarded as the greatest player of all time, scored 762 goals over his illustrious career. The three-time World Cup champion remains an iconic figure in football history, celebrated for his remarkable achievements and prolific goal-scoring abilities.Known as ‘The Galloping Major’, Ferenc Puskás was a crucial part of Hungary’s ‘Magnificent Magyars’ and Real Madrid’s 1960 European Cup-winning team. Despite his unassuming physique, Puskás scored the majority of his 729 goals with his powerful left foot from 1943 to 1966.Jimmy Jones, the highest goal-scorer in Irish League football history, scored 647 goals throughout his career. His prolific period with Glenavon, where he netted 517 goals, solidified his reputation as an unstoppable striker.FIFA’s top player in 2020 and 2021, Robert Lewandowski began his career at Dortmund and gained prominence at Bayern Munich with multiple Bundesliga records. Now playing for Barcelona, Lewandowski is Poland’s all-time top scorer and ranks as the third-highest men’s international goal-scorer in Europe.Gerd Müller, renowned for his exceptional poaching skills, scored 634 goals during his career. The Bayern Munich legend, known as ‘Der Bomber’, averaged over a goal per game at the international level, including scoring the winning goal for West Germany in the 1974 World Cup final.Eusébio, known as O Rei in Portugal, was a prolific goal-scorer of the 1960s and 1970s. Leading Benfica to domestic and European success, Eusébio scored 619 goals in 639 games, leaving a lasting legacy in Lisbon and the football world.","Cristiano Ronaldo holds the record for the most goals scored for Real Madrid and for Portugal, surpassing any other male player at the international level.

KOLKATA: With reinforcements in key positions and Pep Guardiola ’s blessings, East Bengal FC are looking to fight for more trophies and strive to scale new heights this season.The team, backed by investor Emami Group , has roped in Greek striker and Golden Boot winner of last ISL season Dimitrios Diamantakos as well as French playmaker Madih Talal, who had the most assists (10) in the league.India midfielder Jeakson Singh has also joined Cuadrat’s team on a four-year contract.“In my 7 years in Indian football, this is certainly one of the best squads. Of course, we’ll be under pressure (of rising to expectations), but football is about being under such pressure and accepting the challenges,” coach Carles Cuadrat said during the unveiling of his players at the investor’s office in the city on Monday.The Spanish coach also believed that his team would be more proactive and attacking this season.“Last season, the depth of the squad was not enough to be competitive. So, it was kind of a surprise when we reached the Durand final and won the Super Cup. But it won’t be a surprise if we make the final of a competition this time around. Last season, it was more about protecting a goal and winning points. But now we have options and we are going to be more offensive and aggressive this season,” Cuadrat pointed out.Last month East Bengal’s assistant coachDimas Delgado met Pep Guardiola on the occasion of a reunion that was held on the occasion of the current Manchester City manager’s 16th year anniversary of his first title. Delgado was part of the Barcelona B team in 2007-2008 which was managed by Guardiola before he took charge of the senior team.“Since he’s from City, Mumbai City had come up for discussion as the Premier League club has a tie-up with the ISL team, But we also talked about our project at East Bengal and he wished us luck for the new season,” Delgado said.Speaking on the occasion, Emami director Aditya Agarwal also hoped to see a different East Bengal. “Keeping the long season in mind, we have tried to forge a squad that can challenge for multiple titles,” he said.Cuadrat’s brigade will launch their season with the Durand Cup clash against IAF team on July 29.Mohun Bagan SG on Monday announced the signing of Australian striker Jamie MacLaren.

I am delighted to have gotten the opportunities. That is what we work hard for. For a long time, I did not get to officiate a final. I am very happy that I was part of three of the most important matches of the season,” said Venkatesh, adding that officiating big matches involving the Kolkata giants were a “huge challenge”.While Mohun Bagan Super Giant played in both the ISL Shield-deciding game and ISL final, East Bengal FC fought for the top prize in the Super Cup title clash.“When the Kolkata clubs play, it is always difficult. There are a number of factors, including the quality of teams and enormous size of the fan bases. As officials, we have to understand the feeling around such matches.

After trading forehand errors, Vukic ultimately netted a forehand volley, sealing Eubanks' hard-fought victory.Vukic's sole appearance in an ATP final came in Atlanta last July, where he was defeated by Taylor Fritz of the United States.In the other semi-final match on Saturday, Reilly Opelka, a US wild card entrant playing in his first tournament since competing in Washington in 2022, will face off against his 19-year-old compatriot, Alex Michelsen, who finished as the runner-up in Newport last year.Despite his current world ranking of 1,188, which is the lowest for a player reaching an ATP semi-final in the Open Era, Opelka has managed to secure a spot in the final four. His significant drop in the rankings can be attributed to his prolonged absence from the tour, during which he underwent surgeries on his hip and wrist.","Chris Eubanks beat Aleksandar Vukic 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (7/3) in the ATP Hall of Fame Open quarter-finals on Friday.

Maharashtra government

to make amends & announce reward to boost shuttler's morale before Paris Games

MUMBAI: Badminton player Chirag Shetty 's comments regarding Maharashtra government ignoring his achievements while rewarding cricketers from the state for winning the T20 World Cup have stirred up a hornet's nest.Chirag along with Satwiksairaj Rankireddy - the No.3 ranked men's doubles team in the world - played a crucial role in India winning their maiden Thomas Cup in 2022. Chirag, though, wasn't recognised for his effort. After seeing the cricketers being feted, the aggrieved shuttler told TOI on Sunday that ""if the state government can honour World Cup-winning stars, they should also honour him and treat other sports equally"".Besides the Thomas Cup success, Chirag has also won doubles gold at Asian Games , Commonwealth Games and bronze at World Championships. The 27-year-old Malad resident has now found support from prominent sportspersons of the city, who urged the state government to resurrect the situation by rewarding Chirag. Uday Pawar , coach and mentor of Chirag, felt that his ward's achievement is on par with that of cricketers and he should have been rewarded for it.Former India hockey captain MM Somaya said that he had sympathy for Chirag as ""winning the Thomas Cup is a truly historic achievement"". He went on to add that the state government can make amends by announcing a reward for him just before the Paris Olympics begin which will be good ""for his morale as well"".Pawar, a former Asian Games medallist and a prominent badminton coach in the city, said: ""I am not comparing sports but like the cricketers who have brought honour to Maharashtra, so has Chirag. I feel his achievement is on par (with the cricketers). A person who has brought honour to the state shouldn't be demanding but the state should recognise his efforts on its own.""He added that players shouldn't ask for recognition and instead the state government should have a mechanism in place where once they have achieved something of national significance, they should be rewarded.""I think the state's sports ministry should be more active. They should do their own homework and should be aware of who the top players from Maharashtra are. If they don't know about his/her achievement, then the ministry is not functioning properly. They should have people who will keep in touch with the respective associations from state and take updates on how their players are performing,"" said Pawar.Somaya said: ""I would fully agree with Chirag and I would quite understand his position. Since he was the only player from Maharashtra, he deserves the recognition. Need not be such a huge amount that they have given to cricketers but in some manner, he should be rewarded. He is seeking recognition from the state government which I think is only natural and I think it will be fair even if the state govt does it now. He is one of the key players from Maharashtra to participate in the Olympics and has a good chance of winning a medal with Satwik.""He also urged the state government to have a ""consistent policy"" to reward the performers from other sports as well. ""They should reward the players as soon as they know that someone from the state has achieved something big. It should be a standard process. A person shouldn't be applying for it. You should make a person feel a sense of pride when a state government recognises a player on their own,"" felt Somaya.","Badminton player Chirag Shetty's comments regarding Maharashtra government ignoring his achievements have stirred up a hornet's nest.
