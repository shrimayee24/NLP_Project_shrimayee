BJP fields Samrat Choudhary, Vijay Sinha in first list for Bihar polls

NEW DELHI: ‘I will not contest Bihar assembly polls,’ Prashant Kishor has declared, ahead of the high-octane elections in the state. The Jan Suraaj founder said the decision was taken by his fledgling political startup for the “greater good.”The poll strategist-turned-politician confirmed this in an exclusive interview with PTI.Speculation had been rife that Kishor would contest elections, and possibly take on RJD scion Tejashwi Yadav in his stronghold of Raghopur. With the release of Jan Suraaj’s second list of 65 candidates on Monday, it was clear that Kishor’s name was absent. Instead, the party has fielded political activist Chanchal Singh against Tejashwi.Meanwhile, Tejashwi is all set to file his nomination papers from Raghopur on Wednesday, even as seat-sharing issues within the INDIA bloc remain unresolved.“The party has decided that I should not contest the assembly polls. And therefore, the party has announced another candidate from Raghopur, against Tejashwi Yadav. It was a decision we took in the larger interest of the party. If I were to contest, it would have distracted me from the necessary organisational work,” Kishor said.Despite sitting out, Kishor remains bullish about his party’s prospects. “I can say with certainty that we will be either win handsomely or receive a drubbing. I have been stating on record that I expect a tally of either fewer than 10 seats or more than 150 seats. There is no possibility of anything in between,” he said.He also set a benchmark for success: “A tally less than 150, even if it is 120 or 130, shall be a defeat for me. If we do well, we will have the mandate to transform Bihar and make it count among the 10 most advanced states of the country. If we do not do well enough, it would mean the people have not shown enough confidence in us, and we must continue to carry on with our politics of the street and society (samaj aur sadak ki rajneeti). ”Kishor, who recently predicted that JD(U) would struggle to win even “25 seats” in the 243-member assembly, said the outlook for chief minister Nitish Kumar ’s party has only worsened.“The NDA is definitely on its way out and Nitish Kumar will not return as chief minister,” asserted Kishor, who has closely worked with the JD(U) supremo, both as a poll analyst and, briefly, as a party colleague.“You do not need to be a psephologist to fathom what is in store for the JD(U). In the last assembly polls, Chirag Paswan staged a revolt just a few days ahead of the announcement of elections and fielded candidates, many of whom were inconsequential, against nominees of Kumar's party, causing its tally to crash to 43,” Kishor recalled.He added that there is “complete chaos” in the NDA, with uncertainty over which seats the BJP will contest and where the JD(U) plans to field its candidates.Kishor added, “If Jan Suraaj Party wins the Bihar polls, it will have a nationwide impact. The compass of national politics will point in a different direction.”The Bihar assembly elections will be held in two phases, on November 6 and 11, with counting scheduled for November 14.","Prashant Kishor says he will not contest Bihar assembly polls.

Fare Play

When 30 Becomes 15

Collective Survival Strategy

It was 2014. End-October. I was in Delhi — where I work — but needed to go back home to Bihar for the Chhath Puja. I called up a cousin, who teaches at Delhi University, hoping he could help get my waitlisted railway ticket confirmed. I still remember what he told me laughingly: “Every Bihari wants to get the hell out of the state, and now everyone’s trying to go back!” Broad generalities dispensed with, his tone turned sombre. “It’s difficult to reach Bihar, and even if you do, it will be a one-way ticket. How will you return?” My cousin, I realised, could never become a motivational speaker.Word about my unconfirmed ticket had spread in our office. I must have told someone, and then he or she must have told someone else, and so on. I think everybody feels a little better when someone else is down. Schadenfreude, pure and simple.After a miserable day at work, I headed to the Press Club. Alcohol might do you harm, but very few things come close when you are trying to drown your sorrows. You are probably thinking what a stupid thing I did, but you are wrong.I couldn’t have made a better decision. I was at the right place at the right time. A senior colleague, by now much mellowed by the effects of alcohol and having ascended a moral plane where schadenfreude had no place, spotted me and took me over to another senior journalist who could get any railway ticket confirmed. Long live the special quota.Bihar, I said, here I come.I did get on the train. I had a confirmed berth. But… Hello, what was this? A human ocean? I had seen crowds, but this was something else. Sardines, packed inside cans, probably have more space for themselves.I somehow survived, and when morning dawned, and the train chugged into Bihar, I felt... happy, maybe? After all, I was home. I had made the journey I wanted to make. But I also knew that I would never make this journey ever again.My cousin, the Delhi prof, had been partly right. There were no available tickets on the regular trains. But being an eternal pessimist, he had not budgeted for the number of special trains the Railways runs during Chhath and other festivals.I managed to get a confirmed ticket on one such train. It would leave from Patna at 8.30pm. I was in Muzaffarpur, my hometown. Strangely, on the day I was to leave, my parents insisted I leave home at 11am. “But Patna is barely 70km from here!” I argued, uncertain if my parents were showing early signs of senility or if they were truly fed up with my company.But it turned out they were approaching the 70km journey from a rooted Bihari perspective. A distance that one could reasonably expect to cover in no more than one and a half hours could often take much, much longer in Bihar. “We are speaking from experience,” my mother said.Banished with tiffin and a lecture, I set out. Within an hour I was marooned near Hajipur, facing the Mahatma Gandhi Setu — the bridge over the river Ganges that connects Hajipur in the north to Patna in the south. You hear of monster traffic jams in Delhi and Gurgaon, but this was a whole new level.I did catch the train, which — surprise, surprise — was on time, but it involved a sprint in the end, and a timely leap into the compartment as the train was gently pulling out of Patna Junction. So, net net: about 70km in nine and a half hours. Now do the maths.Once seated — unlike the train to Bihar, this had a limited number of humans on board — I dialled my mother. “You were lucky,” my mother said. “Your father’s uncle’s son-in-law once got stuck on that bridge in peak summer, AC gone, ended up admitted to a Patna hospital. His ailing father-in-law had to leave home to visit him there.”Good lord! I had been lucky indeed.Next time, I thought, I’d book a plane. Unfortunately, so did every other Bihari with a credit card, and the fares during Chhath shot up like Diwali rockets. On one visit, I landed in Patna, where an uncle picked me up from the airport and dropped me at a bus stand. I wasn’t expecting a bus like this. A gleaming, low-floor, air-conditioned govt bus to Muzaffarpur. Wow! It felt like a hallucination crafted by a particularly optimistic urban planner. I took the last seat.Seated next to me were a couple from Delhi. The conductor arrived. “Muzaffarpur,” I said. He quoted something like Rs 200. And then he winked. “For you, I will make it Rs 150.” Sure! Maybe some discount scheme. I didn’t think too much about it, just handed over Rs 150. But there was no ticket forthcoming. And then the penny dropped.The Delhi couple beside me were giving me the dagger look. And then the man took out Rs 400, and, pointedly, told the conductor: “Give us tickets, we’ll pay Rs 200 each.” The conductor looked personally betrayed. “Look at this man,” he told the bus, “insisting on paying extra.”A murmur rose — passengers, it turned out, are fiercely united against the principle of receipts. The wife asked me: “Would you do this on a DTC bus in Delhi?” The husband added, “This is why nothing works — the passengers and the staff.” Backed into a corner, the conductor printed their tickets. I felt like I needed a place to hide, something like a dark, mossy cave where no light ever entered.After half an hour, still feeling raw inside, I finally plucked up courage, and whispered to the couple: “You did the right thing, Sirji. I feel terrible.” They smiled, magnanimous in victory.On another trip, last year, I bypassed the bridge altogether and flew into Darbhanga. Outside the airport, I got on a bus to Muzaffarpur and sat beside the driver. On board were the driver, conductor, and cleaner, plus about 30 passengers. We soon pulled into a petrol pump, where a man climbed aboard to count heads. “Thirty,” he declared. The conductor laughed. “Fifteen, boss. Try again.” The man looked unconvinced until a small parcel of persuasion slid into his pocket. He cleared his throat: “Fifteen.”I, the suburban moralist, couldn’t help myself. “Won’t the owner find out?” The conductor shrugged. “He owns 200 buses. He’s not an idiot.” Pause. “This is expected. Our salaries haven’t changed in years. I’m not thinking only of me — the driver and the cleaner have families too.” He said it without malice or secrecy, someone merely stating undisputable facts like how the sun rises in the east. Strangely enough, I managed to see things from his point of view.Back in Muzaffarpur, a journalist friend offered the tidy thesis. “Bihar runs differently,” he said. “For generations, the state never really showed up. Colonial hangovers, feudal leftovers, thin institutions. People learned to get by without the system, so now the system gets by without the people. Autopilot.”I’ve replayed those trips while planning every subsequent Chhath. There’s the train that turned into a human aquarium, the endless bridge, the AC bus that looked like a mirage, the conductor’s discount that wasn’t a kindness so much as a custom, the auditor whose arithmetic improved with a little encouragement, and the conductor’s calm defence of cheating. None of this is heroic, but it also doesn’t feel villainous. It feels like a collective survival strategy.And each year I find myself plotting the same pilgrimage — rail versus road versus sky — telling myself I’ll do it better this time, knowing fully well that I most likely won’t.","Every Chhath Puja, returning home to Bihar turns into an adventure. trains bursting with passengers, traffic jams that defy physics, and conductors who redefine honesty.

"Small is strong in Bihar, as spoilsport or as kingmaker",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/small-is-strong-in-bihar-as-spoilsport-or-as-kingmaker/articleshow/124564721.cms,"New Delhi: Humbling memories of the last assembly elections serve as a cautionary tale for major parties in the two rival alliances in Bihar as they seek to accommodate demands of their smaller allies in a state with a polarised electoral battlefield where they can either play a spoilsport or multiply gains of their big brothers.BJP and JDU senior netas were huddled in Patna Tuesday to decide on which of their partners will contest on some of the seats after Chirag Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) made its claim over a few constituencies seen by the CM Nitish Kumar-led party as its backyard.LJP had drilled home the point about its disproportionately disruptive influence when it walked out of NDA to contest on its own in 2020 after its seat-share demand was snubbed by its bigger partners, especially JDU. Paswan’s party contested on 135 seats and could win only one but ensured the defeat of JDU, its primary target, in over two dozen seats, taking a heavy toll on Nitish’s political weight.For more than a decade, it was Nitish who held the balance, ensuring NDA’s electoral dominance in back to back assembly polls in 2005 and 2010, and then romping home along with RJD in 2015 before LJP struck a serious blow to its standing five years later.With both alliances enjoying a strong and committed vote bank populated by voters mostly along caste lines, a party like LJP with solid backing of over 5% Paswans can break the numerical stalemate involving big players.Newbies like Union minister Jitan Ram Manjhi-led HAM can do the same in the region of his influence over votes of Mushhars, less than 3% and the poorest among SCs, and Mukesh Sahani-led Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) hopes to wield a similar influence by appealing to a group of castes, traditionally boatmen and fishermen.Unhappy with RJD, VIP had jumped to NDA’s side in 2020, when less than 15,000 votes separated the two alliances. NDA won 125 seats against opposition’s 110 but had a merely .03% higher vote share. Hurt in 2020, JDU and BJP are now treading cautiously as LJP drives a hard bargain. Things are, if anything, more complicated in ‘Mahagathbandhan’ — RJD-Congress-Left-VIP bloc.While NDA has managed a division of the number of seats among its constituents, a consensus has so far eluded the rival alliance, with the Congress driving a hard bargain on not only the number of seats it will contest but also choice of its seats.Several RJD members are unhappy with Congress for not endorsing its de facto head and former deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav as the CM face of the alliance but electoral compulsions have ensured that their party cannot brush aside the claims of Congress after playing a second fiddle to its functionary Rahul Gandhi during his ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ in Aug-Sept. Congress coupled with the Left, especially CPI-ML, and VIP can bring incremental votes to RJD, which has long enjoyed the solid support of the state’s two biggest voting blocs in Muslims and Yadavs but failed to draw enough support from other communities to ride a winning combination.As Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj Party emerges as another potential disruptor in the polls scheduled for Nov 6 and 11, lead partners in both alliances try hard to protect their flanks even if it costs them a few extra seats.",BJP and JDU senior netas huddled in Patna Tuesday to decide on which of their partners will contest on some of the seats.

Who Wins the Deal?

Theare once again linked to a potential reunion with Kyle Schwarber, one of the most powerful hitters in baseball and a former Fenway Park favorite. With the Philadelphia Phillies exiting the NLDS and Schwarber heading into free agency, the timing seems right for both sides to explore a comeback. Yet, the move comes with important considerations surrounding roster balance, defense, and the team’s long-term payroll structure.At 32 years old, Kyle Schwarber delivered one of the best seasons of his career, leading the National League in both home runs and RBIs while earning his second All-Star nod. His offensive numbers reaffirmed his reputation as one of baseball’s premier power bats.Technically, the Boston Red Sox wouldn’t need to trade for Schwarber - he’s now a free agent after completing his four-year, $79 million contract with Philadelphia. However, a sign-and-trade scenario could emerge if the Phillies seek to gain value rather than let him walk for nothing.A hypothetical trade could look like this:• Boston Red Sox receive: Kyle Schwarber (DH)• Philadelphia Phillies receive: Jarren Duran (OF) and a mid-tier pitching prospect such as Wikelman GonzalezThis framework would allow Boston to move an excess outfielder while gaining the middle-order slugger the lineup has lacked since Rafael Devers’ departure.For Philadelphia, Duran’s athleticism and defensive range would fill a major need in their outfield, offering youth and control through 2028.1. Elite Power Addition: The Boston Red Sox finished 18th in MLB in home runs (176), well below playoff-caliber teams. Schwarber’s 50-plus homer potential would immediately fix that deficiency.2. Clubhouse and Fan Familiarity: During his 2021 stint with Boston, Schwarber quickly became a fan favorite. His leadership and postseason experience could stabilize a young roster headlined by Roman Anthony and Ceddanne Rafaela.3. Perfect Fenway Fit: Schwarber’s pull-heavy swing from the left side matches perfectly with Fenway Park’s short right-field porch, reminiscent of how David Ortiz thrived in the designated hitter role.1. Luxury Tax Flexibility: Schwarber’s next deal is expected to command between $25 and $35 million per year. The Phillies already have major financial commitments to Bryce Harper, Trea Turner, and Zack Wheeler, so shedding that salary would bring relief.2. Improved Defensive Balance: Duran brings elite speed and defensive versatility - qualities the Phillies currently lack outside of Brandon Marsh.3. Future-Proofing the Roster: Acquiring controllable players would help Philadelphia stay competitive while avoiding the payroll crunch looming in future seasons.In 2025, Boston ranked 23rd in slugging percentage (.398), while Philadelphia finished top five (.448). Adding Schwarber’s production would likely boost Boston’s team OPS by around 20 points - enough to elevate the offense closer to league leaders.From an immediate standpoint, Boston clearly benefits more by acquiring one of baseball’s most dangerous power hitters. Kyle Schwarber’s bat alone could add several wins to the Boston Red Sox offense, potentially improving their team WAR by approximately +4.0 in 2026 projections.For the Phillies, the benefits lie in long-term strategy - saving roughly $30 million annually while replenishing their roster with younger, cost-controlled assets. Although losing Schwarber’s production would sting, the move would give them financial breathing room and lineup balance.If the deal materializes, the Boston Red Sox emerge as short-term winners, gaining the kind of middle-order thunder that has been missing in their lineup. Kyle Schwarber’s familiarity with Fenway Park and connection with fans make the move both sentimental and strategically sound.For the Phillies, it’s a calculated decision - trading short-term firepower for financial stability and roster flexibility.Also read: MLB Trade Rumors: Boston Red Sox Predicted to Land $10.15 Million Detroit Tigers Star to Bolster Squad Around Garrett Crochet Ultimately, this could turn out to be one of the most impactful reunions of the 2025–26 MLB offseason, especially if Boston leverages Kyle Schwarber’s power to reignite their postseason ambitions.","The Boston Red Sox are once again linked to a potential reunion with Kyle Schwarber.

Jack Roslovic’s missed opportunity with the Oilers





A new start and a second chance





When Jack Roslovic signed a one-year deal with the Edmonton Oilers during their season opener against the Calgary Flames, it caught many by surprise. The skilled forward had spent the entire summer as a free agent, waiting for the right opportunity. But what shocked fans even more was the revelation that Roslovic had reportedly turned down a much larger offer from the same team months earlier—one that could have secured his financial future.According to NHL insider David Pagnotta on Hello Hockey, Jack Roslovic had a three-year offer worth around $3 million annually from the Oilers earlier in the off-season. “He had I think a 3-year offer on the table in the summer… from the Oilers, worth considerably more; I think it was in the $3m range; he thought he was getting a better deal somewhere else,” Pagnotta revealed.That decision, as it turns out, didn’t go as planned. Roslovic bet on himself, hoping for a more lucrative deal from another franchise. Instead, he found himself unsigned deep into the off-season, watching the market dry up. By the time the Oilers circled back, the terms were no longer the same. What could have been a $9 million contract turned into a one-year prove-it deal.Roslovic, a former first-round pick with over 500 NHL games under his belt, eventually changed agents to Justin Duberman and reopened talks with Edmonton.This time, the Oilers needed depth and even-strength production—needs identified by GM Stan Bowman, who saw Roslovic as a low-risk, high-reward addition.“It’s the fourth signing for the busy Bowman this week,” reports noted, following extensions for Connor McDavid , Jake Walman, and Mattias Ekholm. Roslovic’s deal, however, feels different—it’s a test drive, not a commitment.For the 27-year-old forward, this season will be about redemption. If he can rediscover his scoring touch alongside Edmonton’s elite core, he could still cash in big next summer. But for now, it’s hard to view this off-season as anything other than a missed opportunity—a reminder of how quickly fortunes can shift in the NHL.Also Read: Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch delivers brutally honest take on Stuart Skinner after shocking Game 1 overtime loss","Jack Roslovic signed a one-year deal with the Edmonton Oilers during their season opener against the Calgary Flames.

The Kansas City Chiefs secured a 30-17 win over the Detroit Lions at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday, but the victory was overshadowed by a frightening moment involving star tight end Travis Kelce. During the game, Kelce took a brutal fall after a tackle by Lions cornerback Rock Ya-Sin, landing directly on his head and causing immediate concern for his safety. The incident sparked widespread alarm from fans and analysts alike, with many questioning why Kelce wasn’t assessed for a concussion or head injury.The pivotal moment came when Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes connected with Kelce on a beautiful pass, allowing the tight end to charge toward the end zone. As he was pursued by Ya-Sin, the Lions defender brought him down with a hard hit. Kelce flipped upside down in the air and crashed awkwardly on his head, a fall that left many fans holding their breath.Despite the severity of the landing, there was no immediate evaluation of Kelce’s condition on the field, which raised eyebrows on social media. Fans took to X (formerly Twitter) to express their concerns, with one user commenting, “Not sure a player can bounce on his head and not get checked.Perception is that they didn't want to take Kelce off the field in that spot. Is that fair? Probably not, but it is the perception. .” Another tweeted, “Travis Kelce had a great game tonight but sweet Jesus this play had my heart in my throat, this was scary! Hope they investigate Travis Kelce landing on top of his head with his entire body weight and wasn't evaluated at all.” A third comment read, ""Travis Kelce landed on his head and Andy Reid had to tap his helmet to see if he was good. The league might test him in my opinion.""Despite the scary moment, Kelce played through the rest of the game and did not mention the fall in his postgame interview. Instead, he focused on the team’s performance against a tough Lions squad. Kelce expressed pride in how the Chiefs handled the game, stating, “This Lions team is tough, but we were fired up to experience this challenge.” He continued, “I can’t tell you how proud I am of these guys for finding a way to get it done,” and emphasized that when the Chiefs play with “feel and fire,” they are “a tough team to beat. ”While the Chiefs demonstrated their offensive strength throughout the game, Kelce’s well-being remains a key topic of conversation. Given the nature of his fall, questions linger over why he wasn’t more closely monitored by the medical staff, especially considering the increasing focus on player safety in the NFL.","The Kansas City Chiefs secured a 30-17 win over the Detroit Lions on Sunday.

Game Context and Impact of Injuries

The preseason clash between theon October 14, 2025, will be heavily influenced by the injury situations of both teams. Player availability become a defining factor, shaping the matchups, strategies, and fan expectations leading up to tip-off.The Oklahoma City Thunder enter this preseason contest with a long list of injuries that significantly impacted their depth and rhythm. Key contributors Nikola Topic, Kenrich Williams, and Thomas Sorber are ruled out entirely, forcing the coaching staff to rely on younger and less experienced players.Adding to the challenge, several of Oklahoma City’s most important stars are listed as day-to-day. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jalen Williams, and Chet Holmgren - core pieces of the Thunder’s lineup - has been limited in recent practices due to lingering injuries, making their status uncertain until game day. Other rotational players, including Jaylin Williams and Isaiah Joe, are also facing short-term injury designations that further complicate lineup decisions.Among the most concerning updates is Jalen Williams’ ongoing recovery from a wrist injury, specifically a torn scapholunate ligament. He had played through the pain late last season before opting for offseason surgery. His rehabilitation had been gradual, with limited contact drills as he worked toward full strength ahead of the regular season.If cleared to play, the expected Thunder starting five will feature Gilgeous-Alexander , Lu Dort, Jalen Williams, Chet Holmgren, and Isaiah Hartenstein. However, with multiple players nursing injuries, there is substantial uncertainty about whether this lineup will materialize. The question marks surrounding Oklahoma City’s health loom large, affecting both their preparation and confidence before facing Milwaukee.In contrast, the Milwaukee Bucks enter the game in considerably better health. Their only reported injury is to veteran guard Gary Harris, who is listed as day-to-day. His absence is considered minor and unlikely to disrupt the team’s overall chemistry or rotation.This leaves the Milwaukee Bucks with a major advantage in depth and lineup stability. Their predicted starters - Kevin Porter Jr., Gary Trent, Kyle Kuzma, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Myles Turner - represent a balanced and potent unit. With most of their roster available, Milwaukee look to maintain its strong preseason form and head into the regular season with momentum.Heading into this matchup, the Bucks carry an undefeated 3-0 record in the preseason, having defeated the Miami Heat, Detroit Pistons, and Chicago Bulls. Their cohesion and depth have been key factors in those victories. Meanwhile, the Oklahoma City Thunder experience a mixed preseason at 2-2, struggling to find rhythm amid frequent lineup changes and limited minutes for their star players.Milwaukee’s overall health gives them a clear edge, both on paper and in preparation. The Thunder’s reliance on backup and developing players due to injuries disrupted their chemistry, forcing adjustments that weakened their offensive and defensive structure. As a result, the game narrative centers around whether Oklahoma City’s young roster can overcome adversity against a full-strength Bucks squad.For fans and analysts, this game serves as more than just a preseason tune-up - it is also a test of resilience and roster depth. The Bucks, led by Antetokounmpo and Kuzma, seek to close out their preseason with an unblemished record, while the Thunder aim to compete despite their injury setbacks.Ultimately, the injuries dictate much of the pregame buzz. Milwaukee’s minimal health issues give them a decisive advantage in both experience and energy, while Oklahoma City face the uphill task of fielding a competitive lineup amid uncertainty.Also read: Chet Holmgren Playing Tonight Against the Milwaukee Bucks?

Brittany Mahomes gets the final word after Terrion Arnold’s pregame troll

Patrick Mahomes weighs in on the post-game chaos

Brittany Mahomes, the outspoken wife of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, had the perfect response to Detroit Lions cornerback Terrion Arnold after his pregame jab backfired spectacularly. Following the Chiefs’ dominant 30–17 win at Arrowhead Stadium on October 12, Brittany took to Instagram to make sure Arnold knew who got the last laugh.Before the highly anticipated matchup, Terrion Arnold, 22, shared a WWE meme featuring The Undertaker sneaking up behind AJ Styles, edited with the faces of Patrick Mahomes and Lions coach Dan Campbell. The post implied that Detroit would “sneak up” and defeat Kansas City on their home turf. But when the Lions fell 30–17 in front of a roaring Arrowhead crowd, the meme’s message didn’t age well.Brittany, 30, quickly reposted Arnold’s own meme on her Instagram Story, letting the scoreline do the talking. It wasn’t just a playful jab, it was a reminder that the Mahomes family knows how to handle criticism with a winning smile. This isn’t the first time Brittany has defended her husband online, but this one felt especially satisfying after a week of trash talk and tension leading up to the game.The drama didn’t end at the final whistle. A brief brawl erupted after Lions safety Brian Branch refused to shake Mahomes’ hand and instead took a swing at Chiefs receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster. “I mean, we play the game in between the whistles. They can do all the extracurricular stuff they want to do.

Study links officiating bias to “financial pressure” in NFL





Cam Newton says the solution is simple: make refs full-time





Why do NFL Refs make $250K But STILL have full-time jobs?

You know that feeling when a big play gets called back for no reason, and you’re ready to throw the remote at your TV? For NFL fans, that’s part of the experience — but in Louisiana, Saints fans have lived that nightmare more than most. Now, a surprising new study from the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) suggests fans might not be imagining things after all. Turns out, the refs might really be giving some teams a softer whistle.The UTEP researchers analyzed data from twenty full NFL seasons, focusing on judgment-based penalties like offensive holding — the ones that can shift an entire game’s outcome. What they discovered raised eyebrows: the Kansas City Chiefs, especially during playoff games, were flagged for holding far less than expected.The study didn’t stop there. It proposed that “financial pressure” could subtly influence officiating. In other words, when a high-profile team like the Chiefs — one that drives massive TV ratings, ticket sales, and merchandise — is playing, the subconscious desire to “protect the product” might alter what referees see or choose not to call.That theory hit home after the recent Chiefs–Lions game, where viewers erupted over the seemingly one-sided officiating.The Lions had a touchdown erased by a questionable penalty, while the Chiefs escaped the entire night without a single flag. Referee Craig Wrolstad later explained one of the controversial calls, but to many fans, it felt like déjà vu from countless other Chiefs matchups.While fans rage on social media, former NFL MVP Cam Newton believes the problem isn’t just bad calls — it’s the system itself. Speaking on his 4th & 1 podcast, Newton argued, “Any referee that you see on Sunday is a part-time worker, a contractor. These people have real jobs and real lives outside of refereeing… If you want to change this, have it where the NFL referees are governed by a committee. They have their own union and make their job a full-time job. ”Currently, NFL referees earn about $250,000 a year and work part-time, often juggling other professions. Newton insists that’s not enough accountability for a league worth over $20 billion annually. He believes referees should be evaluated weekly, watch game film, and face real performance reviews — just like players and coaches.He even suggested a fresh idea: let retired NFL players become referees. “After you get done playing, go be a referee… You’ll have plenty of potential referees that take this job extremely seriously,” he said.Newton’s proposal would make officiating a year-round profession, complete with film study, ongoing training, and internal checks — something that could restore fan trust in a league where faith in the officials is fading fast.Because, as Newton bluntly put it, “They got real jobs.” And maybe, that’s exactly the problem with NFL referees today.Also Read: Who is Kirk Cousins' wife?

FOX doubles down on its A-list broadcast team despite ongoing criticism

Erin Andrews opens up about unfair scrutiny from fans

As FOX prepares for one of its biggest NFL broadcasts of the season, “America’s Game of the Week” is already stirring controversy and not just on the field. Tom Brady and Erin Andrews are once again in the spotlight, as the pair’s on-air return for the Cowboys vs. Commanders matchup in Week 7 has sparked renewed debate among fans and critics alike.FOX Sports confirmed that Brady will reunite with Kevin Burkhardt, Erin Andrews, and Tom Rinaldi for the divisional clash at Arrowhead on October 19. Burkhardt will handle play-by-play duties, Brady will serve as lead analyst, and Andrews and Rinaldi will provide sideline coverage. It’s a high-profile reunion for the same team that launched Brady’s analyst career during the Cowboys’ 2024 season opener against the Browns.However, the excitement surrounding this reunion is mixed with skepticism. Brady’s dual role as a FOX analyst and part-owner of the Las Vegas Raiders has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. Critics argue that his access to insider knowledge might compromise his neutrality. Brady responded in his newsletter The 199, writing, “I love football. At its core, it is a game of principles… the point where my roles in it intersect is not actually a point of conflict, despite what the paranoid and distrustful might believe.Andrews, one of the most recognizable sideline reporters in the league, hasn’t been immune to criticism either. Fans have often mocked her voice and reporting style, questioning her role despite years of experience. “Everyone at home will say, ‘Oh, her voice sucks. That report was stupid.’ How could you know?” Andrews told US Weekly. “I’ll repeat exactly what a head coach tells me at halftime.

Could the Eagles bring C.J. Gardner-Johnson back?



C.J. Gardner-Johnson’s impact on the field



C.J. Gardner-Johnson’s NFL journey has hit another crossroads. Just a week after joining the Baltimore Ravens’ practice squad, the veteran safety has been released. According to his agent, Kevin Conner, the decision was “an amicable mutual decision. ” Gardner-Johnson, 27, now enters free agency once again, leaving teams to consider whether his dynamic playmaking can bolster struggling defenses this season.Philadelphia fans may already be hoping for a reunion. After Gardner-Johnson left the Eagles in 2022, the team’s defense struggled to maintain its previous intensity. “The Eagles defense lost its swagger once CJGJ walked out the door,” said one observer. With injuries plaguing the secondary and younger players like Andrew Mukuba stepping in, Gardner-Johnson’s return could provide both talent and energy.“CJ Gardner-Johnson is hungry, and that’s exactly what the Eagles need,” analysts suggest. Even if only for a short-term boost, his presence can spark a defense that has looked flat in recent games. Beyond statistics, his leadership and game-changing ability make him a tempting target for any team looking to stabilize a faltering secondary.Gardner-Johnson has a track record that speaks for itself. Across seven NFL seasons, he has recorded 18 interceptions and 51 passes defended. Last season alone, he snagged six interceptions while helping the Philadelphia Eagles march to a Super Bowl appearance. Despite occasional questions about off-field issues or team fit, his ability to change the momentum of a game is undeniable.For the Ravens, the timing didn’t align. Gardner-Johnson joined the practice squad on October 7, but Baltimore quickly acquired safety Alohi Gilman from the Los Angeles Chargers. Gilman started in the Ravens’ loss to the Rams, making seven tackles, while Gardner-Johnson remained on the practice squad. This marks the second release this season for the safety, who was let go by the Houston Texans after just three games.As Gardner-Johnson explores his next opportunity, one thing is clear: teams in need of a proven, playmaking safety should be paying close attention.

His ability to create separation, make contested catches, and generate explosive plays has made him one of the most efficient young receivers in the league. Golden’s growing presence in the offense signals that the Packers are beginning to trust him in high-pressure situations, giving quarterback Jordan Love another dependable target in crucial moments.Following his standout showing, the Packers asked fans on X (formerly Twitter) to vote for Golden as Week 6 Rookie of the Week. He faces six strong contenders, including New York Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart and running back Cam Skattebo, Las Vegas Raiders running back Ashton Jeanty, Carolina Panthers wide receiver Tetairoa McMillan, and Indianapolis Colts tight end Tyler Warren.Fans are already weighing in online, with mixed reactions about his role: “I don’t want to,” one fan said, while another added, “No, not until y’all use him correctly,” and a third commented, “He ain’t that good.”Despite the skepticism, Golden’s big-play ability and efficiency give him a strong edge in the rookie rankings.Golden’s performances over the past three weeks show a trend of steady improvement rather than one-off flashes. His increasing targets and ability to produce under pressure signal that the Packers coaching staff is beginning to rely on him in critical situations. With Jordan Love developing chemistry with the young wideout corps, Golden provides the team with a dynamic threat who can stretch defenses and open up scoring opportunities. If he continues at this pace, Golden is poised to cement himself as a breakout star and a key piece of Green Bay’s offensive plans.As the season continues, the buzz around Golden is growing. His efficiency, big-play potential, and growing rapport with Love suggest he could become one of the most exciting rookies to watch this year. While some fans remain cautious, many are beginning to recognize his impact. If he keeps producing at this level, Golden not only has a strong chance at Rookie of the Week honors but could also secure a lasting role as a cornerstone of the Packers’ passing attack.Also read: Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt gives fans a look at her weekend with boyfriend Derek Green after Chiefs’ win over Lions","Green Bay Packers rookie wide receiver Matthew Golden is quickly establishing himself as a reliable weapon in the team’s offense.

Why did C.J. Gardner-Johnson leave the Ravens? Inside what really went down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-did-c-j-gardner-johnson-leave-the-ravens-inside-what-really-went-down/articleshow/124559436.cms,"(Brett Coomer/Houston Chronicle)

Ravens and C.J. Gardner-Johnson part ways after just one week together

It’s been a rollercoaster 2025 season for Gardner-Johnson

Well, that didn’t last long. Just a week after joining the Baltimore Ravens, safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson is already back on the free-agent market. According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, the Ravens and Gardner-Johnson have mutually agreed to part ways, ending what turned out to be one of the shortest tenures of the season. This marks CJGJ’s second release in 2025, following his earlier stint with the Houston Texans, leaving fans wondering what’s next for the fiery defensive back.When Gardner-Johnson joined Baltimore’s practice squad earlier this month, many fans expected him to eventually earn a spot on the active roster. But things didn’t pan out that way. As reported by Schefter, the Ravens and the veteran safety agreed it was best to go separate ways after just one week.The 26-year-old never appeared in a game for Baltimore, and according to multiple reports, the decision was “mutual and amicable.” With the Ravens’ secondary already stacked and healthy, there just wasn’t much room for CJGJ to make an impact. Sometimes, the fit just isn’t right and this was one of those times.This season has been all over the place for Gardner-Johnson. He started off with the Houston Texans, where he played a few games before being released earlier in the year.Then came his brief stop in Baltimore, which ended almost as quickly as it began.Despite the constant moves, Gardner-Johnson’s reputation as a hard-hitting, high-energy safety still follows him. He’s known for his swagger, trash talk, and leadership on the field, traits that helped him shine during his time with the Eagles and Lions in previous seasons. But 2025 just hasn’t given him the right opportunity to showcase that spark.With two releases in a single season, Gardner-Johnson is once again a free agent, waiting for the next team to call. The league has seen how dynamic he can be when locked in especially during his standout 2022 run in Philadelphia so it’s not crazy to think someone could take a midseason chance on him.Still, given how quickly things have unraveled in both Houston and Baltimore, teams might be cautious before making a move. It’s been a rough ride for CJGJ this season, but his fire and talent haven’t gone anywhere. If the right team needs secondary depth and a little attitude, he could find himself back on the field soon.Also read - What happened to DJ Moore and why he was hospitalized after Monday night: Latest update on his health","C.J.

Abhishek Sharma trolls Shaheen Afridi, smashes Pakistan bowlers and dominates

Poll Is Yashasvi Jaiswal a key player for India's future in cricket? Absolutely Not Really

AHMEDABAD: As Yashasvi Jaiswal rushed in to embrace Brian Lara following an extraordinary 175 in the second Test against West Indies, Lara jokingly said, ""Don’t beat our bowlers that bad."" The humorous remark was a glowing endorsement of the lofty standards that the 23-year-old batter has set.""Keep getting the hundreds. Daddy hundreds,” reacted Sunil Gavaskar Jaiswal's 175 is his fifth 150+ score in Tests before turning 24, which only Don Bradman managed to surpass. The 23-year-old's conversion of 50+ scores after 49 innings in Tests stands at nearly 39.6%, which is better than Sachin Tendulkar (36.2%), Ricky Ponting (35.9%), Brian Lara (35.3%) and even Virat Kohli 's (29%) tally at a similar stage.Jaiswal has scored seven tons in Tests, which is the joint-most by an opener before turning 24 alongside Graeme Smith. Only Bradman (12), Tendulkar (11) and Garry Sobers (9) surpassed the 23-year-old's tally in Tests before that time period. While Jaiswal's success is certainly impressive, there is a lot of hard work, intensity and mental strength which goes behind delivering performances of this magnitude.""Mumbai's famous 'khadoos mentality' is reflected in his gameplay. Jaiswal's struggle and character motivate him to make every little opportunity count.The environment obviously played a role, considering the Mumbai cricket system is super tough with high competition. None of us have been in his shoes, living in a tent. Sacrifices have been made but the game-changer is Jaiswal's work ethic,"" cricketer's mentor Zubin Bharucha told TimesofIndia.com.The 23-year-old batter had to initially make certain adjustments in his strokeplay and develop his onside game along with the reserve sweep. However, Jaiswal swiftly enhanced his craftsmanship due to a strong desire to be the best in the world.""The preparation is where the magic starts. Jaiswal wanted to be perfect at whatever shot he couldn't play. He wouldn't leave the ground till he achieved excellence in, for example, playing the reverse sweep, practising the stroke 300 times a day. I remember a practice session in Guwahati where he came to bat in the middle of the afternoon, eventually finishing at 2 AM. There's a different mindset involved in such practice sessions which is rare. It's almost spiritual. You can imagine the blood, sweat and tears involved. Being brilliant, brave and creative is what eventually leads to top performances,"" added Bharucha.""I remember a training session two or three years back where Jaiswal was preparing to face Jofra Archer. We found a sidearm pacer who was assigned the role of bowling bouncers at 150 kph. There was a chance of injury. Very few people would agree to such practice drills. However, Jaiswal was more than willing to take up the challenge,"" he stated.Sri Lanka batting coach Julian Wood likened the 23-year-old's capabilities to Abhishek Sharma, hailing his clarity of thought.""He has the discipline to get the job done with an ability to tear attacks apart astutely. Jaiswal can manipulate the field beautifully like Abhishek Sharma, absorbing the pressure well. His body positioning, ruthlessness and swing are excellent, enabling him to score those mammoth runs. Along with that, Jaiswal completely trusts his fundamentals and has a clear idea of his capabilities, just like Abhishek,"" said Wood.""He makes the margin of error for bowlers very small. If you bowl too straight, Jaiswal will flick you. Batters often get tied up with technique but the key aspect in his gameplay is the complete clarity,"" he added.Former Indian cricketers Pravin Amre and Wasim Jaffer have backed the 23-year-old batter to achieve even more success. Amre highlighted Jaiswal being a left-hander as a big advantage to the Indian team, terming his consistency ""amazing"" and resilience praiseworthy.""Jaiswal understands the importance of converting starts into big scores. I am confident that he could have scored a triple century if not for that unfortunate dismissal on 175. The ability to bounce back is evident — when Jaiswal's back is to the wall, he always finds a way to score runs. There’s still a lot of time for him to achieve even greater things,"" said Jaffer.While Jaiswal maintains optimum focus on his preparation, another aspect which holds him in great stead is being a good listener.""Whenever he feels a little down due to things not going as per plan, I tell him, 'It has been so tough reaching this stage. Surely, we are not going to let our place go to somebody else'. We have long conversations even at 2 AM. Jaiswal once told me that he feels he's late on the ball, which is when I corrected him and told him that he's actually early. He knows when he is doing something wrong. We were very clear that an adjustment is necessary with regard to facing left-arm spinners like Mitchell Santner. Jaiswal applies all the suggestions instantly,"" stated Bharucha.""He comes and asks questions about the kind of preparation necessary when travelling to Australia and England as well as the aspects that can be done differently. Jaiswal is always thinking and tinkering. I watch every ball faced by him following a knock and pinpoint even the tiniest of errors, "" he added.Jaiswal idolises Sachin Tendulkar and has attempted to emulate the legendary batter's discipline from an early age, as evident from an anecdote shared by former Mumbai U-19 cricket team coach Satish Samant.""Jaiswal was promoted to the under-19 Mumbai team from the under-16 level back in 2017-18. I saw him bat in the nets and was impressed. A selector asked me whether Jaiswal is fit to play at the U-19 level. I said, 'He deserves to play Ranji Trophy'. There was an under-19 match against a strong Madhya Pradesh side where I told Jaiswal to play any shot barring the slog sweep as he had been dismissed playing that shot on certain occasions. He didn't play it at all during the opening day,"" shared Samant.","Jaiswal has scored seven tons in Tests, which is the joint-most by an opener before turning 24 alongside Graeme Smith. The 23-year-old's conversion of 50+ scores after 49 innings in Tests stands at nearly 39.6%.

'Practically impossible to have three captains': Ajit Agarkar explains why Shubman Gill succeeded Rohit Sharma as ODI skipper

Poll Should domestic cricket selectors be chosen only from recently retired players? Yes, they understand modern cricket better No, experience from all eras matters

Former India cricket captain Ajinkya Rahane has called for significant changes to the selection system in domestic cricket, suggesting that only recently-retired players should be appointed as selectors. During a discussion with Cheteshwar Pujara on his YouTube channel, Rahane emphasized the importance of having selectors who understand modern cricket's evolving nature and can help players perform without fear.Rahane's proposal aims to modernize the selection process in Indian cricket , particularly at the domestic level. He believes that selectors who have retired within the last five to eight years would be better equipped to understand contemporary cricket's demands.Current regulations by the Board of Control for Cricket ( BCCI ) allow retired cricketers with over 10 first-class matches experience to become state association selectors after a five-year cooling-off period. The national selection committee has stricter requirements, including a mandatory cooling-off period.""Players should not be scared of selectors,"" Rahane stated during the discussion. ""We should have selectors who have retired recently from playing top-flight cricket, those who have retired five-six years, seven-eight years ago. Because the way cricket is evolving, I think it's very important that the mentality and mindset of the selectors match that and keep pace with the change.The game is evolving.""Rahane further elaborated on his vision for cricket selection in India. ""We don't want to make decisions based on how cricket was played 20-30 years ago. With formats like T20 and the IPL, it's important to understand the style of modern cricket players. I believe selectors should, wherever possible, be individuals from all states, and players should be on the ground playing with freedom, playing fearless cricket,"" he said.Cheteshwar Pujara, who retired in August, offered a more balanced perspective on the matter. Under current rules, Pujara would need to wait until 2030 to be eligible for a selector position.""In big states, this can be implemented because they have so many options. So, wherever possible, I do agree that it can be implemented, but that does mean that any past cricketer, who has got a great record and wants to be a selector now, should be deprived of the chance because he retired long back,"" Pujara commented.",Former India cricket captain Ajinkya Rahane has called for significant changes to the selection system in domestic cricket.

ILT20 CEO David White Exclusive Interview: 'R Ashwin set for ILT20 stint'

Former Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has advocated for the establishment of standard Test centres for home matches in India, supporting earlier calls made by Virat Kohli in 2019. Speaking on his YouTube channel ""Ash ki Baat,"" the 39-year-old off-spinner emphasized the importance of considering player familiarity and pitch conditions, alongside crowd attendance, when selecting Test match venues across the country. Ashwin highlighted that playing conditions vary significantly across different regions in India, which can impact the quality of Test matches. He specifically pointed out the challenges with pitches in certain parts of the country, particularly noting the lack of bounce in eastern regions.The 106-Test veteran stressed that the selection of Test venues should prioritize locations with superior pitch conditions, where the Indian team has experience playing. This familiarity, according to Ashwin, constitutes a legitimate home advantage.""Test centres is not about crowds alone. It is also about familiarity of conditions. If we are playing a Test in Guwahati or Ranchi, I am not against these venues as a possibility. But the problem in India is every surface has a different identity. There is literally no bounce in the Eastern part of the country. It becomes a very ordinary Test match pitch then.""Ashwin expressed concern about hosting matches in venues where even Indian players lack first-class cricket experience. He referenced the recent Test match in Guwahati against South Africa to illustrate his point about unfamiliar venues.""Make sure whichever Test centre you decide has the best pitches. Some venues are better than others only because the pitches are better and the team is used to conditions. That is home advantage. Otherwise the only point is you are playing within that Indian map as home, but is not home.""The discussion aligns with Virat Kohli 's previous recommendation from 2019, where he proposed limiting Test matches to five permanent centres in India. Ashwin acknowledged the historical reasons for multiple Test centres but questioned their current relevance.""Eden Gardens, Guwahati - playing against South Africa there, should there be standard Test centres? Virat said years ago they must be fixed. I personally think it's about time, why did we make Test centres? So more cricketers could emerge, and their associations would get more funding. But Guwahati as a Test match is not a home game for either team, and I don't think anyone in the Indian team has played a first-class game in Guwahati. ""Kohli's original proposal from 2019 suggested maintaining venue rotation for limited-overs formats while establishing fixed Test centres. His vision aimed to provide visiting teams with clearer expectations regarding playing conditions and crowd atmosphere.""We've been discussing this for a long time now, and in my opinion we should have five Test centres, period. I mean, I agree [with] state associations and rotation and giving games and all that, that is fine for T20 and one-day cricket, but Test cricket, teams coming to India should know, 'we're going to play at these five centres, these are the pitches we're going to expect, these are the kind of people that will come to watch, crowds'. ""The debate around standardizing Test venues in India continues to highlight the balance between maintaining traditional rotation policies and establishing consistent playing conditions for the longest format of the game.","Former Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has advocated for the establishment of standard Test centres for home matches in India.

Mohammed Siraj Press Conference: India pacer reflects on four-fer vs West Indies

NEW DELHI: Veteran Indian fast bowler Mohammed Shami joined Bengal's practice session at Eden Gardens on Tuesday ahead of their Ranji Trophy opener against Uttarakhand, addressing his exclusion from India’s upcoming white-ball series in Australia.

Easton Cowan earns praise for strong NHL debut with Toronto Maple Leafs

Easton Cowan | Post Game vs Detroit Red Wings | October 13, 2025

Craig Berube impressed by Easton Cowan’s performance in Maple Leafs debut



The Toronto Maple Leafs may have dropped their second straight game to the Detroit Red Wings, but one bright storyline emerged from the defeat — the impressive NHL debut of top prospect Easton Cowan. Skating on a line with Auston Matthews and Matthew Knies, Cowan showed composure, hustle, and the kind of on-ice maturity that hints at a bright future in Toronto.Making his NHL debut on home ice is a dream moment for any young player, and Cowan didn’t look out of place. The 20-year-old forward logged nearly 15 minutes of ice time, delivered three hits, and registered one shot on goal. While he didn’t tally a point, Cowan played smart, responsible hockey, doing the little things that coaches notice immediately.“There’s a lot of good guys on this team, a lot of good leaders,” Cowan said postgame. “They’re helping you out a lot. I just went out there, played free, and felt like I created a lot tonight.”Cowan’s strong two-way play didn’t go unnoticed by his teammates. Knies, who scored his first goal of the season, praised Cowan’s vision and passing ability, particularly noting a slick setup that nearly resulted in a Matthews breakaway goal. Goaltender Anthony Stolarz also credited Cowan’s poise under pressure, highlighting his willingness to battle physically against veteran opponents.The most significant endorsement of Cowan’s debut came from head coach Craig Berube. Late in the game, Berube showed his trust in the rookie by putting him on the ice during a crucial 6-on-5 situation — a clear indication of confidence in Cowan’s poise and hockey sense. After the game, Berube praised the young forward’s composure and maturity, saying, “Huge congratulations to him, it’s obviously a big moment. Hopefully he starts getting his feet under him, get a little more confidence. We all know the potential is there, but I thought he looked pretty good tonight.”While the Leafs’ 3-2 loss was a setback, Cowan’s debut gave fans something to be optimistic about. His energy, work ethic, and attention to detail suggest he could become a long-term asset in Toronto’s lineup. Whether he draws in for the next game against the Nashville Predators remains uncertain, but Easton Cowan proved he belongs at the NHL level.Also Read: “Honestly not too nervous”: Easton Cowan to make NHL debut, slotted on top line with Auston Matthews and Matthew Knies","The Toronto Maple Leafs lost 3-2 to the Detroit Red Wings.

"'Why play him?': R Ashwin slams India’s selection, questions this cricketer’s place in XI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-west-indies/why-play-him-r-ashwin-slams-indias-selection-questions-this-cricketers-place-in-xi/articleshow/124567077.cms,"India's captain Shubman Gill celebrates with teammates Ravindra Jadeja and Nitish Kumar. (PTI Photo/Shashank Parade)

ILT20 CEO David White Exclusive Interview: 'R Ashwin set for ILT20 stint'

Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has questioned the rationale behind including Nitish Kumar Reddy in India’s playing XI during the recently concluded second Test against the West Indies. Although India won the series convincingly, whitewashing the West Indies 2-0, Reddy’s involvement in the matches was minimal. He bowled just four overs in the first Test and did not bowl a single over in the second, despite West Indies posting 390 in their second innings. Captain Shubman Gill chose not to hand him the ball at any stage.Speaking on his YouTube channel, ""Ash ki Baat,"" Ashwin expressed his concerns, suggesting that the team could have opted for either a specialist batter or a proven all-rounder like Axar Patel instead.“If this is Nitish Reddy’s role, I feel you can play a specialist batter or a bowler. You could play Axar Patel. What less has he done? He has been a match-winner,” Ashwin said.He further questioned the logic of selecting an all-rounder who contributes so little with the ball. “When does Nitish Reddy come into play? I am not saying you need an extra bowler; if not, then play a specialist batter only. Axar has done much better than Nitish in this role,” he added.Ashwin also highlighted Axar’s strengths, especially against spin.“Axar Patel has the best defence against spin. So, if you’re not using him, especially when you have Siraj, Bumrah, and a second seamer, then Nitish can play for batting depth. Otherwise, I don’t see the point. Nitish is a fine batter, but there could be a bit more clarity on his role,” he noted.Looking at the numbers, Axar has played 14 Tests for India, scoring 646 runs at an average of 35.88, including four fifties, and has taken 55 wickets at an average of 19.34. Nitish, on the other hand, has featured in nine Tests, scoring 386 runs at 29.69 with one century, and has claimed eight wickets at 39.62.","Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin questioned the rationale behind including Nitish Kumar Reddy in India’s playing XI during the recently concluded second Test against the West Indies.

South Africa, Ivory Coast and Senegal all won convincingly on Tuesday to fill the last three automatic places reserved for Africa at the 2026 World Cup.Senegal were the most impressive winners, hammering Mauritania 4-0, while Ivory Coast beat Kenya 3-0 and South Africa were also 3-0 winners, against Rwanda.The trio will join Algeria, Cape Verde , Egypt, Morocco, Senegal and Tunisia at the global showpiece in the United States, Canada and Mexico.Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon and Nigeria kept alive hopes of swelling the African representation to 10 nations by finishing as the four best-ranked runners-up.They will meet in two single-match semi-finals and a final in Morocco during November and the winners advance to inter-continental play-offs in March with two World Cup places up for grabs.Former Liverpool star Sadio Mane scored just before and after half-time for Group B table-toppers Senegal, with Iliman Ndiaye and Habib Diallo also netting for the Teranga Lions.Senegal finished with 24 points, two more than DR Congo, who edged Sudan 1-0 in Kinshasa through a Theo Bongonda goal.Manchester United winger Amad Diallo completed the scoring for the Ivory Coast, who led from the seventh minute in a convincing triumph over Kenya in Abidjan.Franck Kessie put the reigning African champions ahead and Yan Diomande added the second goal soon after half-time.Ivory Coast topped Group F with 26 points, one more than Gabon. Gambia overwhelmed the Seychelles 7-0 to come third.Thalente Mbatha and Oswin Appollis scored for South Africa in the first half and Evidence Makgopa sealed victory with a goal midway through the second period in Mbombela.South Africa topped Group C with 18 points, one more than Nigeria, who hammered third-placed Benin 4-0 in Uyo with Victor Osimhen claiming a hat-trick.It will be the fourth appearance by South Africa at the global showpiece. They qualified for the 1998 and 2002 tournaments and were automatic participants in 2010 as the host nation.Belgium-born South Africa coach Hugo Broos was thrilled as he represented his country as a player at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico and wanted to coach a team at the tournament before retiring.""We all knew that we could do it, we believed in ourselves. We are going to the World Cup and it is fantastic,"" said the 73-year-old.""In the last three years we changed players and every time it was the right choice.

There are no words to express how I feel.""Winger Appollis was voted player of the match after scoring and creating the other goals as South Africa regained their scoring touch after failing to find the net in a draw with Zimbabwe last Friday.""What an amazing feeling for the group going to the World Cup. I am so happy for the boys,"" he told reporters.""I know we had a draw in our last game, but I knew that we would come here to Mbombela tonight and win.""Qualification was a huge relief for South Africa, who saw a five-point lead with four rounds remaining turn into a two-point deficit behind Benin entering the final round.South Africa dropped points in home draws with Nigeria and Zimbabwe and forfeited three points for fielding the ineligible Teboho Mokoena in a victory over Lesotho.South Africa needed to beat Rwanda and hope Nigeria defeated Benin, and that is what transpired with the home teams making dream starts.Nigeria were ahead within three minutes through Osimhen while Mbatha scored the first South African goal with just five minutes gone.A snap shot from Appollis midway through the opening half put South Africa in control and Rwanda spent most of the match on the back foot.Makgopa, a late call-up in place of the injured Iqraam Rayners, headed into the net off a corner on 72 minutes to complete the scoring.Osimhen netted a second time before half-time and completed his hat-trick six minutes into the second half. An added-time goal from Frank Onyeka completed the rout.Qatar and Saudi Arabia became the latest teams to book their spots at the 2026 World Cup, with each finishing top of their respective groups on Tuesday in the fourth round of Asian qualifying.In Group A, Qatar saw off the United Arab Emirates 2-1 in their must-win clash in Doha, where second-half goals from captain Boualem Khoukhi and Pedro Miguel sealed the 2022 hosts's place at next summer's finals in the United States, Canada and Mexico.Then, later in Jeddah, the Saudis came through a goalless draw at home to Iraq to book a berth at the 2026 showpiece.In qualifying on merit for a first World Cup, Qatar went some way to atoning for three years ago, when they entered the history books as the first hosts to lose all three group games.Against the UAE on Tuesday, the winners of the past two Asian Cups took the lead four minutes into the second half at the Jassim Bin Hamad Stadium where Khoukhi headed home Akram Afif's in-swinging free-kick.On 74 minutes, the hosts doubled their lead, this time Pedro Miguel making the most of a mistake by UAE goalkeeper Khalid Essa to nod into the empty net.Coached by former Spain, Real Madrid and West Ham boss Julen Lopetegui, Qatar had to survive Tarek Salman's sending-off late on for a studs-up tackle, while the UAE were provided a lifeline from substitute Sultan Adil's volley eight minutes into injury-time.To their credit, though, Qatar held on to take their place at a first World Cup on foreign soil.In Group B, Saudi Arabia made it through to a third successive finals by avoiding defeat to Iraq at their King Abdullah Sports City.The 2034 hosts, who recorded a stunning victory against eventual winners Argentina at the 2022 World Cup, needed only a draw to seal a berth at a seventh showpiece event.Herve Renard's side could have had taken the lead two minutes into the second half, but Lens full-back Saud Abdulhamid sent his effort over the Iraq crossbar with the goal at his mercy.Moments later, Al Ahli midfielder Saleh Abu Al Shamat forced a fine save from range from Jalal Hassan, while the Iraq goalkeeper soon thwarted both Saudi captain Salem Al Dawsari and namesake Nasser Al Dawsari.It took a save from goalkeeper Nawaf Al Aqidi deep into injury-time to ignite celebrations among the 60,000-plus crowd in Jeddah, but Saudi had done it.Iraq, last participants in 1986, remain in the hunt for the World Cup: next month, they contest a two-legged tie against the UAE, with the winner then going into an intercontinental playoff.","South Africa, Ivory Coast and Senegal all won convincingly on Tuesday to fill the last three automatic places reserved for Africa at the 2026 World Cup.

No clear favorites as injuries shake up Super Bowl odds



Injuries and upcoming matchups add to league unpredictability



The 2025 NFL season is proving to be one of the most unpredictable in recent memory. Six weeks in, no team has emerged as dominant, and unbeaten streaks are nonexistent. Only the Buccaneers and Colts have reached five wins, while early-season leaders like the Bills and Eagles have already stumbled with back-to-back losses. The Chiefs have evened their record, the Packers look shaky, and teams like the Steelers quietly sit near the top. With so many teams in contention, the question of who will win the Super Bowl feels almost impossible to answer.In a rare scenario, around 15 teams still have a realistic chance to claim the Lombardi Trophy. Entering the season, the Eagles (+650), Ravens (+700), Bills (+750), Chiefs (+750), and Lions (+850) were considered early favorites according to BetMGM Sportsbook. Now, four of these remain among the top five: Bills (+600), Chiefs (+650), Lions (+750), Packers (+800), and Eagles (+1000).Injuries have played a huge role in reshaping expectations. The Ravens, plagued by missing star quarterback Lamar Jackson for two games and other key players, have dropped to 12th in odds following a 1-5 start. Meanwhile, the Colts (5-1) and Buccaneers (5-1) are flying under the radar, sitting behind the Rams (+1400) and tied with the Chargers and Broncos (+1800) in BetMGM’s list.Oddsmakers still undervalue the Steelers (+3000), even with a 2 1/2-game lead in the AFC North over Baltimore (+2500).Recent results show the volatility of the league. The Eagles were dominated 34-17 by the Giants, the Bills fell 24-14 to the Falcons, and the Lions were handled 30-17 by the Chiefs, making it clear that past form is no guarantee of future success.Injuries continue to redefine team fortunes. The 49ers, for example, won their first three games despite losing Brock Purdy, George Kittle, Nick Bosa, and much of their starting lineup. Coach Kyle Shanahan emphasized resilience: “The reality is we lost another really good player. But, what are we going to do about it? ... We’ve got to put pressure on some veterans to play the best that they can. And these rookies who I believe are coming along need to put the pressure on themselves to clean up the mistakes. ”This week, several intriguing matchups feature two winning teams. The Rams face the Jaguars in London, the Eagles visit the Vikings, the Colts take on the Chargers, and the Falcons play the 49ers. With injuries, uneven performances, and a deep pool of contenders, the NFL’s open landscape promises thrilling games and endless debates about who can ultimately hoist the Lombardi Trophy.Also Read: Eagles fans could see CJ Gardner-Johnson back as he becomes free agent following Ravens release","Six weeks in, no team has emerged as dominant and unbeaten streaks are nonexistent.

India failed to qualify for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup after going down 1-2 to Singapore who rallied to humble the hosts with a brace from Korea-born attacking mid-fielder Song Ui-young in the third round qualification match here on Tuesday.Lallianzuala Chhangte's 14th minute strike was cancelled out by Song's equalizer in the 44th minute, and then he struck what proved to be the winner, in the 58th minute as India were left to rue many missed chances.The two teams were locked 1-1 at the half-time break at the Jawahar Lal Nehru Stadium, having played a 1-1 stalemate in the first leg in Singapore on October 9.In the day's other Group C match, Hong Kong and Bangladesh shared the spoils after a 1-1 draw in Hong Kong, a result that did not help India's cause who entered the game with two points from three matches.India were the dominant team in the first half and enjoyed long spells of possession, and it was appropriate that the Blue Tigers scored the opening goal in front of a lively home crowd.Chhangte received the ball some distance away from the edge of the box and unleashed a screamer with his left foot that beat the Singapore goalkeeper on its way to the back of the net.However, Song had other ideas as he struck twice in ether side of the break to dash Indian hopes.Just before the interval, Singapore struck back against the run of play courtesy Song, who found space inside the Indian box and kept his composure to level the score at 1-1, the equaliser leaving the Indian players distraught for they were the ones dictating play for most parts of the first half.On resumption, the visitors looked much sharper and more confident thanks to that equaliser, and they were rewarded when Song capitalised on India's defensive lapse to slot the ball home from close range and put his side ahead 2-1.Desperate for an equaliser, India head coach Khalid Jamil made plenty of substitutions hoping to inject some pace and urgency, bringing Rahim Ali and Udanta Singh in place of Liston Colaco and Sunil Chhetri. But all these changes did not work as India ended on the wrong side of the result.Brandon Fernandes missed out on a great chance to restore parity for India on the 90th minute after excellent work from Udanta Singh and Rahul Bheke. He hit the ball wide with his weaker foot with the goal at his mercy.Only the group winner will qualify for the Asian Cup and Hong Kong and Singapore currently lead the table with eight points each.Coming into the game with just two points from three matches, India needed nothing less than a win to stay in contention for the top spot in the group.India also missed couple of chances in the first half, during a period of play when they were dominating the contest.Jamil attributed the defeat, and rightly so, to ""lack of concentration"" on part of the India players, who have endured another disappointing campaign.","Singapore beat India 1-2 in their Asian Cup qualifier in Fatorda, Goa.

As an opponent, you can try to key on one line as opposed to two.""He further added, “I'm sure their coaching staff is always weighing that decision, just like the rest of us do with our lineup.Do you load the top six, or do you balance your team out? I don't know if there's any right or wrong answer.
