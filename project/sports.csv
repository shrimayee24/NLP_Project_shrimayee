The Kansas City Chiefs Recently Signed TE Robert Tonyan. What Does This Mean For Travis Kelce?



In a surprise move the Kansas City Chiefs has signed veteran tight end Robert Tonyan to their practice squad ahead of their Christmas day game against the Pittsburgh Steelers . This can no doubt affect tight end Travis Kelce ’s role in the team, especially since he has put career-low numbers this season.Though he has never been among the NFL ’s most remarkable tight ends, Tonyan has picked 17 receiving touchdowns in his career, 11 of which were scored in 2020. Although he has been assigned to the practice squad, fans may not see him in action on Wednesday’s game; it’s possible Tonyan will join the active roster in the coming weeks if a player on the depth at the tight end position is injured.Kelce’s versatility has been quite key for the team especially for the O-Line challenges this season as it has led Kelce to contribute more as a blocker. While it’s true that his receiving stats dipped, his overall performance has been impactful. Steelers coach Mike Tomlin called Kelce “unbelievably unselfish,” as he pointed out his abilities to create winning opportunities for his teammates. Kansas City head coachAndy Reid also weighed in on Tomlin’s assessment.“I’m not telling you he doesn’t like to play and catch and do all that stuff. He’ll sacrifice for the cause… He’s willing to help out everywhere,” Reid said.Tonyan played collegiately at Indiana State and stepped into the NFL as a free agent in 2017. During his eight years in the league, Tonyan has signed contracts with every team in the NFC North, from the Packers and Bears to Lions and Vikings.It’s yet to be seen how Tonyan’s addition can affect Kelce’s role since the former is a reliable red-zone target. The Chiefs will travel to Pittsburgh for the Christmas Day match, which is a move that has been criticised by Patrick Mahomes who has said that playing three games in 11 days can affect the fitness of the team. ""It’s not a good feeling,"" he said. “You never want to play this amount of games in this short of time. It’s not great for your body. But, at the end of the day, it’s your job, your profession. You have to come to work and do it.”“All you can do is focus on the game. The practice you have that day. I try to prepare my body all year long for this stretch. That’s tailoring my workouts, tailoring how you practice and prepare. And the coaches do a great job of taking care of us on the practice field. We practice as hard as anybody, but they know how to dial it back when needed,” Mahomes added.Also Read : Taylor Swift Shares Group Hug With Travis Kelce’s Mum Donna Post Chiefs Win","The Kansas City Chiefs have signed Robert Tonyan to their practice squad.

The Los Angeles Lakers will be heading to the Chase Center to take on the Golden State Warriors as part of the NBA Christmas Games 2024.

The Warriors were able to win that match with a score of 134-120. Klay Thompson put up a team-high 27 points that night and the Lakers still struggled to cope with Golden State as a unit. It is also worth noting that the Warriors have won their last three games against the Lakers.- Moneyline: Lakers (+155) vs Warriors (-190)- Spread: Lakers (+4.5) vs Warriors (-4.5)- Total (O/U): Lakers -110 (O 227.5) vs Warriors -110 (U 227.5)(Note: Odds are correct at the time of writing and likely to change.)The Warriors will be playing at home on Christmas night which should prove to be a big factor in tonight’s game. However, we have to take into account that Stephen Curry has been in poor form as of late recording two and 10 points in two of his last three games. With him being so inconsistent it is hard to see the Warriors beating a team consisting of Anthony Davis and LeBron James.

“Absolutely ridiculous”: Keanu Reeves provided a humorous response to the rumor that the Ravens offered him a chance at quarterback,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/absolutely-ridiculous-keanu-reeves-provided-a-humorous-response-to-the-rumor-that-the-ravens-offered-him-a-chance-at-quarterback/articleshow/116522105.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Keanu Reeves was once approached to try out for quarterback by the Baltimore Ravens

Keanu Reeves & Idris Elba Talk Shane Falco, Michael Jordan Movie & Auto Racing

One popular rumor suggests that Keanu Reeves became so good as a quarterback during the movie ""The Replacements"" that he got invited to try out for the Baltimore Ravens. It is indeed well-known that the internet can mix truth and gossip or fiction with claims like this. Most blended with this idea of Reeves trying out for an NFL team fit well with his reputation for hard work and intense preparation for his film roles.The Replacements is a 2000 sports comedy film directed by Howard Deutch and starring Keanu Reeves, Gene Hackman, Orlando Jones, Brooke Langton, Rhys Ifans, Jon Favreau, and Jack Warden in his last film appearance before his death in 2006. Reeves played Shane Falco #16 (QB) — A left-handed former All-America quarterback for Ohio State who fell off the grid after choking in the 1996 Sugar Bowl and washing out of the pros after one season, giving him a derogatory nickname of ""Footsteps"", because of his impulse to scramble prematurely when he thinks a sack is coming.Keanu Reeves's role in The Replacements, playing Shane Falco in 2000, was among the most defining moments of his illustrious career as an actor. In the film, Reeves was the quarterback for the Washington Sentinels, signed after a strike, as Falco is the quarterback needed by coach Jimmy McGinty, played by Gene Hackman.In an interview on Sports Illustrated, Reeves together with Idris Elba discussed their upcoming movie, Sonic the Hedgehog 3, and rumors of an NFL try-out with the Baltimore Ravens after playing Falco in The Replacements. ""That's absolutely ridiculous,"" Reeves said with a huge smile. ""I got OK, but that is ridiculous. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yeah, I was out there, 'Blue 87!' [throwing] 50-yard outs no problem,"" he added laughing.The Baltimore Ravens, led by Brian Billick at that time, won Super Bowl XXXV less than six months after ""The Replacements"" premiered. While some sources suggest Billick might have expressed interest in Reeves, no official records or statements confirm that the Ravens extended a tryout invitation. Reeves' reputation for intense preparation in film roles and his portrayal of Shane Falco as a comeback-story quarterback make the rumor of him trying out for an NFL team plausible.Also Read: Will Taylor Swift attend the Chiefs-Texans game to cheer for Travis Kelce? Fans wonder if it's her final regular season appearance The Replacements was inspired very loosely by the 1987 NFL strike; in its story, one team-the won-out Washington Redskins-won three replacement games while all of its regular players were lost and then went on to win Super Bowl XXII after that. The story may center on replacement players, but the Falco–Martel quarterback controversy is reminiscent of the post-strike Washington controversy involving Doug Williams and Jay Schroeder.Squeezed in as the third position on the box office chart, the movie made $11,039,214 within its opening weekend in North American box office standings, following Space Cowboys and Hollow Man - which both made their way to this spot for the second consecutive week. By the end, it grossed about $44.7 million in domestic figures and about $5.3 million internationally, at more than $50 million worldwide.Although there is no official record, there are indications that Keanu Reeves was indeed offered the chance to play on the Ravens. However, Shane Falco was praised by Brian Billick, who at that time was the quarterback of the Baltimore Ravens. The team won Super Bowl XXXV six months after the movie had been released.","The Replacements is a 2000 sports comedy film directed by Howard Deutch.

The Dallas Mavericks will be taking on the Minnesota Timberwolves at the American Airlines Center as part of the NBA Christmas games tomorrow. The Mavericks have easily been a top-five team in the league this season, with an offense that is nigh impossible to stop. However, the Timberwolves have been winning games thanks to their solid defense so this could end up being an entertaining affair.Continue reading to learn more about the matchup, including injury reports, start time, where to watch, betting tips, game prediction, and more.(Note: Projected starters are subject to change.)- Luka Doncic- Kyrie Irving- Anthony Edwards- Julius RandleThe Mavericks won their last game against the Timberwolves with a margin of six points. Kyrie Irving was huge for Dallas during that game and scored 35 points, while Anthony Edwards scored 37 for Minnesota. The Mavs won that game even though Luka Doncic struggled to cross 25+ points, which is extremely rare for him. The Mavs and Wolves have only played one game this season and that too was pretty close.

How to watch Boston Celtics vs Philadelphia 76ers: Streaming details and more

The Boston Celtics will be hosting the Philadelphia 76ers at the TD Garden for the NBA Christmas games on December 25, 2024. The Celtics have been dominant for most of the season but are beginning to slow down and are 6-4 in their last 10 games. This isn’t alarming, but is subpar for their standards. However, the Sixers have it worse and are currently the 12th seed in the East. But, Philadelphia is on its way up and has won seven out of their last 10.Continue reading to learn more about the matchup, including injury reports, start time, where to watch, betting tips, game prediction, and more.(Note: Projected starters are subject to change.)- Jaylen Brown- Derrick White- Tyrese Maxey- Devin VassellThe Celtics were very comfortable during their last game against the 76ers and won with an 18-point margin. Jaylen Brown was the top scorer for the Celtics that night and recorded 31 points. On the other hand, Tyrese Maxey put up a game-high 32 points, but the rest of his team let him down with only a few players being in double digits. Moreover, the Celtics have their last three games against Philadelphia so momentum is on their side.- Moneyline: 76ers (+340) vs Celtics (-450)- Spread: 76ers (+9.5) vs Celtics (-9.5)- Total (O/U): 76ers -110 (O 221.5) vs Celtics -110 (U 221.5)(Note: Odds are correct at the time of writing and likely to change.)While the Celtics look like the better team on paper, we have to take into account that they’ll be heading into their upcoming game without their best player, Jayson Tatum. Tatum leads the team in points, rebounds, and assists. So, with him sitting out, this could be quite a tough game for the Cs. If Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey have a good night, the Celtics will surely lose this one.Our Prediction: The 76ers will winALSO READ: Los Angeles Lakers vs Golden State Warriors (12/25): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, Game Prediction, Betting Tips, How to Watch, and More The NBA Christmas game fixture between the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers takes place at the TD Garden on Wednesday, December 25, 2024.

NFL Insider Reveals What Vikings Plans To Do About QB Sam Darnold Next Year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-insider-reveals-what-vikings-plans-to-do-about-qb-sam-darnold-next-year/articleshow/116637680.cms,"Darnold is less likely to become a free agent next year, as per reports (Image Source: Getty)

Sam Darnold Is Likely To Stick With Vikings Next Year, As Per Insiders

The Minnesota Vikings just had a massive 27-24 road win over the Seattle Seahawks in Week 16 which keeps them on par with Detroit Lions for the NFC North crown and the No. 1 overall seed. The highlight of the match is no doubt quarterback Sam Darnold ’s 39-yard scoring pass to wide receiver Justin Jefferson in the fourth quarter which fetched the winning points. And NFL broadcaster Colin Cowherd thinks the Vikings should bring him back next year and not let him become a free agent.The Vikings signed Sam Darnold to a one-year, $10 million contract last offseason. He was expected to serve as a bridge quarterback to a rookie Minnesota was looking to add in the 2024 NFL Draft. As per a Sports Illustrated report Coach Kevin O’Connell wants to stick with Darnold. However, the team has already drafted J.J. McCarthy this year. The Vikings have not ruled out offering Darnold a contract for next season and it would be rather curious if the job was handed over to McCarthy, who has spent his rookie season recovering from a torn meniscus in his right knee.”How in the world do you let Sam Darnold walk? I mean, is there I talked to an executive yesterday that said they’re too smart to let him go,” shared Colin Cowherd, who has rooted for Darnold for quite a while.Minnesota made J.J. McCarthy the No. 11 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft and Cowherd thinks the Vikings should adjust their plans because of how well Darnold has played.“Sometimes it takes a while to be right. This is no longer just a good story. This is an excellent team and he is an excellent quarterback… quarterbacks are either trucks – where they’re pulling the team – or they’re trailers, where they’re being pulled. Sam [Darnold’s] a truck. He’s pulling this team,” Cowherd said on his show ‘The Herd’.“To me, you’ve gotta franchise tag him at minimum. Can’t let him go. What if he ends up somewhere along the way and comes back to beat you? Maybe this is the best Sam can ever be… I’m not going to deny that… but outline your life in pencil. Plans change. Opportunities arise,” he added.As per projections, the 2025 quarterback franchise tag is worth $40 million. The Vikings reportedly have $78 million in cap space and could easily fit Darnold on their roster next season if they wanted. Experts have also pointed out that they could spend some money to supplement McCarthy with a better-supporting cast.But it’s clear that if Darnold leads the Vikings deep into the playoffs it would be hard for the team to let him leave. Head Coach Kevin O’Connell seems to have thrown his hat in the ring for Darnold as QB. Since the start of the season, O’Connell has praised Darnold’s performance and has kind of been a mentor to him.“Kevin almost seemed a little indignant about the idea that the other shoe is about to drop,” said sports journalist Albert Breer. He is indicating that the Vikings’ head coach is wary of fans saying things may go wrong with Darnold since he wants the team to commit to Darnold in the QB position.It’s quite clear that the Vikings have been great on offense in the 2024 NFL season and O’Connell himself pointed that out. “I want those guys to have some freedom in those moments, especially we do a lot of things with Justin [Jefferson] and Sam [Darnold], seeing the coverage, and then with some route opportunities to get to at the line of scrimmage,” O’Connell said about Darnold and wide receiver Justin Jefferson after the game.“I think those guys have just gotten so comfortable with that stuff that they are able to execute it like they did which was maybe the play, absolutely the play of the game, maybe even considering just a moment and the circumstances of the season as well,” O’Connell added.Also Read : Shannon Sharpe Slams Aaron Rodgers For Skipping Minicamp For Egypt Trip","Sam Darnold is less likely to become a free agent next year, as per reports.

Chiefs vs Steelers: major points to watch

Ravens vs Texans: major points to watch

Two AFC match-ups have been settled in the NFL this week for Christmas, with four playoff-bound teams. For the first time, Netflix will be streaming games on Wednesday during a doubleheader that will also feature the Chiefs' pursuit of the No. 1 seed working for a playoff bye. This preview is also for Super Wild Card Weekend in Houston, featuring the Texas-based Texans and Ravens. Halftime entertainment has been planned for Houston with Beyoncé. Plan accordingly for your holiday celebrations to allow yourself to enjoy a merry mid-week day of football.Patrick Mahomes' ankle is expected to be tested for a second game on short rest, four days after a win over the Texans. Mahomes, who suffered a mild high ankle sprain on Dec. 15, has not been limited this weekend, passing for 260 yards and one touchdown with zero interceptions. He even added a 15-yard TD run in the first half, the longest scoring scamper in his career. Kansas City will succeed against the Steelers only if they can repeat their quick passing game success against the Texans.Pittsburgh's passing attack has really suffered with the loss of wide receiver George Pickens. He missed three games because of a hamstring injury. Quarterback Russell Wilson, averaging 271 yards per game and 8.7 yards per attempt in his first six starts with Pickens, has dropped to 167.7 yards per game and 6.2 yards per attempt without Pickens.The Ravens and Texans are scheduled to clash in the next NFL game. The last time the teams had a meeting, Baltimore was unstoppable with 229 rushing yards in a 34-10 victory. Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry have been a potent combination in the backfield, as Henry ran for 162 yards on 24 carries against the Steelers.Henry has now recorded his fourth game with 150 or more rushing yards and seventh with 100 or more. The Texans ranked 11th in the league in yards allowed, but preparing to stop the Ravens' run game has been a more challenging strategy. Jackson has been better this season than last season's MVP campaign, racking up a franchise record in passing touchdowns in a season for 37.Also Read: Will Taylor Swift attend the Acrisure Stadium in Pittsburgh to support her beau Travis Kelce in the Chiefs vs Steelers game on Christmas day? Houston is guaranteed a home playoff game for a second consecutive season, but a win over the Ravens would instill confidence in a 3-4 team with a key offensive contributor injured. The Texans are 1-4 against teams with plus-.500 records, with the only win coming against the Bills in early October. Only Nico Collins remains after Dell suffered a knee injury.","Two AFC match-ups have been settled in the NFL this week for Christmas, with four playoff-bound teams.

Vanessa highlighted the holiday-themed tribute with a pointing finger sticker, celebrating her late husband's lasting impact.Even after the tragic loss of Kobe in the 2020 helicopter crash, the legacy of Kobe Bryant continues to shine brightly. His influence stretches far beyond the basketball court, making him a true ambassador of the sport. Kobe's presence still resonates deeply, especially through his legendary sneaker line with Nike.During his long two-decade career with the Los Angeles Lakers , Kobe Bryant wore a remarkable 11 different shoes, each representing a milestone in his legacy. With five NBA championships and one MVP award, his on-court dominance was matched only by the enduring popularity of his footwear. The Mamba’s signature line has become one of Nike's most iconic, loved by basketball superstars like DeMar DeRozan of the Sacramento Kings and Devin Booker of the Phoenix Suns.

Powell’s admiration for Bryant runs deep, reflected not only in his relentless work ethic but also in his unwavering choice of Kobe’s iconic sneakers.This season, Powell has showcased his loyalty to the Lakers legend by wearing Kobe sneakers in his first 20 games, as reported by kixstats. For Powell, Bryant’s legacy is more than just inspiration, it’s a daily motivation to push boundaries, strive for greatness, and embody the Mamba Mentality on and off the court.“Kobe always talked about multiple workouts during the day, getting up super early,"" Powell said in an interview with The Athletic. ""And that started early … During lunch in high school, I was not going to eat; I was getting shots up in the gym. ‘Cause that’s what it took. My favorite player said that. And I was like, this is what I’m going to do. Whatever he said was the road for success, I was going to follow it.” (via: Sportskeeda)He’s just telling me how you raise a killer, how you become a killer in the league. And just removing the emotional side of the game, and just thinking tactically (about) your approach. And that’s what stuck with me, that tip he told me on the side — just removing emotion and thinking tactically when you’re out there playing, and thinking the game through, rather than, ‘Oh, I missed a shot, now I’m up and down, I got a turnover, I got a bad call.’ Remove all that.”Powell has been stepping up for the Clippers, averaging an impressive 23.7 points per game in the absence of two-time NBA champion Kawhi Leonard.Also Read : Julia Bonilla, Rudy Gobert’s girlfriend, speaks out following viral outburst from defense lawyer in Pelicot mass rape trial","Vanessa Bryant shared a festive and creative tribute to her late husband, Kobe Bryant.

John Cena announces in-ring retirement in 2025, invites superstars to 'come get some' | WWE on ESPN

Although 2024 was a monumental year for WWE, it delivered some of the most heartbreaking moments that the fans least expected, especially the one involving 16-time WWE Champion John Cena . WWE is coming off one of the company's most successful years in its four-decade history. But it was not only major success that was the highlight of this year. 2024 saw multiple moments that made the fans sad and heartbroken at the same time.Rey Misterio was one of the biggest luchador stars in Mexico. He was one of the pioneers to redefine high-flying wrestling competing for multiple promotions. Most notably, Misterio Sr has trained his nephew, Rey Mysterio Jr, who went on to become one of the greatest WWE luchadors of all time and a Hall of Famer. However, the wrestling world was saddened this year as Misterio Sr passed away at the age of 66 which was a heartbreaking moment for his family and fans across the world.AJ Styles made his return to WWE in October following an extended hiatus. Also, Reports suggested that he was slated to start his Farewell Tour. However during his first match back against Carmelo Hayes, Styles injured his ankle. This was later revealed to be a legitimate injury and Styles has not been seen since, derailing his plans to embark on the last leg of his wrestling career.Drew McIntyre waited for nearly four years to have his moment of glory. He achieved it finally at WrestleMania XL by defeating Seth Rollins to win the World Heavyweight Championship in front of a live audience. However, his ego cost him his moment as CM Punk attacked him, which led to Damian Priest cashing in his Money in the Bank contract successfully and stealing the title and the glory from McIntyre in a heartbreaking moment for his loyal fan base.The WWE Universe was used to see the ‘Good Guy’ People’s Champion side of The Rock for years. However, after Cody Rhodes became his rival on the road to WrestleMania XL, The Rock joined forces with Roman Reigns and his Bloodline and brought out a new villainous side of his. This came to be known as “The Final Boss”, which was an amalgamation of his current persona and popular gimmick in the early 2000s, known as “Hollywood Rock.” This left many of his fans upset as their hero had turned on them in the most brutal way possible .The 10-year anniversary celebration of The New Day on RAW, which was supposed to be a joyous occasion, quickly turned sour. As Big E attempted to return to the side of Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods, the duo accused him of abandoning them and expressed some hurtful remarks. In the end, they dismissed Big E and turned on the fans in one of the most heartbreaking moments of 2024.One of the most heartbreaking moments in not only 2024 but also in the history of WWE came at the Money in the Bank Premium Live Event. John Cena made a surprise appearance in front of the Toronto audience, but he had shocking news to deliver to the entire world. The 16-time WWE Champion announced that 2025 would be his final year as an in-ring competitor, and his career would culminate at the end of the year with a Retirement Tour. This news left a huge fan base who grew up watching John Cena heartbroken, realising that “The Last Time” was indeed now.Also read: 4 WWE Superstars who are favorite to win the 2025 Royal Rumble",WWE is coming off one of the company's most successful years in its four-decade history.

India vs WI 2nd WODI: Harleen Deol's maiden hundred seals India's series win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/india-vs-wi-2nd-wodi-harleen-deols-maiden-hundred-seals-indias-series-win/articleshow/116646544.cms,"VADODARA: Harleen Deol slammed a coming-of-age maiden hundred (115, 103b, 16x4) as India staved off a fighting century (106, 109b, 13x4) by West Indies captain Hayley Matthews to score a convincing 115-run win in the second match at the Kotambi Stadium here and seal the Women's ODI series 2-0, with the third match, a day game on Friday, now a mere formality.The WODI series win, along with the 2-1 the preceding WT20Is against West Indies, is a massive confidence-booster for the Indian women's team, after they were walloped 3-0 by the Aussies earlier this month.While Deol led the charge to India's second consecutive 300-plus total in this series, fine knocks by young opener Pratika Rawal (76, 86b, 10x4, 1x6), who stroked her maiden half-century while playing just her second WODI, in-form vice-captain Smriti Mandhana (53, 47b, 7x4, 2x6) and Jemimah Rodrigues (52, 36b, 6x4, 1x6) helped India score an imposing 358 for five after they decided to bat first. In signature style, 'keeper-batter Richa Ghosh finished the innings with consecutive fours off Qiana Joseph as India equalled their highest-ever total in this format.Chasing the highest-ever total made against them, West Indies crumbled easily at the start, and were tottering at 69 for four in the 17th over, before Matthews added 112 off 102 balls for the fifth wicket with 'keeper-batter Shemaine Campbelle (38, 48, 5x4), but the partnership ended when the latter was caught superbly by Mandhana at cover in the 34th over off seamer Titas Sadhu. It was all over bar the shouting for the visitors when Rodrigues pulled off a stunner at deep mid-wicket, running and diving in front of her to grasp the ball to end Matthews' heroic knock.Emerging as India's find of this series, Rawal rounded off a fine outing by taking two wickets with her useful part-time spin and taking two catches, the second a superb effort at backward point. While leggie Priya Mishra (3-49 in 9.2 overs) was the most successful bowler for India, the hosts' bowling and fielding was top class on the night.Deol has been around in international cricket for more than five and a half years now. However, in 14 WODIs and 31 innings in international cricket, all the 26-year-old had to show was three fifties, with a highest score of 77. The Chandigarh batter now holds the honour of scoring the first century at the state-of-the-art Kotambi Stadium.Making the most of a reprieve while batting on 26 as a leaping Deandra Dottin as square leg spilled her chance off off-spinner Karishma Ramharack, Deol went berserk in the 45th over, peppering Dottin for three fours through fine leg, point and behind point to move into the 90s, and then reached her 98-ball century with a nicely-timed boundary between fine leg and deep backward square leg off pacer Shamilia Connell in the 47th over. She then celebrated her ton by hitting two more fours-upper cutting and smashing the ball over the bowler's head. Connell's 21-run over also saw her bowling five wides.To add to their woes, a profligate West Indies conceded 25 extras, and bowled as many as 17 wides.Earlier, Rawal and Mandhana provided just the third instance of an Indian opening pair putting on a 100-plus runs stand in back-to-back WODIs when they added 110 in 99 balls to give India the ideal platform for a massive score. In the form of her life in 2024, Mandhana cracked her six straight half-century across formats. Enjoying a purple, or perhaps golden patch, the stylish left-hander has scored 1655 runs in international cricket in 2024-the most by any batter ever. In the ODIs, the opener has scored 743 runs in 123 matches@61.91, with four centuries, in this calendar yearMandhana sacrificed her wicket for Rawal, who was nearing her first half-century, after she was run out while going for a risky second run. In what made for a poignant moment, the senior batter patted her partner's back, who too had tried to sacrifice her wicket for Mandhana, before trudging back to the pavilion.Clearly more confident after her impressive 69-ball 40-run outing on debut in the opening WODI, Rawal was far more aggressive this time, reaching her maiden international fifty off 58 balls.The youngster from Delhi added 62 in 75 balls with Deol. However, there was no respite for the West Indies as Rodrigues and Deol went ballistic in a 116-run stand for the fourth wicket in just 71 balls. Rodrigues, who scored a 34-ball half-century, pummeled James for four fours in the 46th over.",India beat West Indies by 115 runs in second ODI to win series 2-0.

(Photo by David Gray/AFP via Getty Images)

MELBOURNE: Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill , India's next rung of elite batters, have found support from their captain after a string of poor scores. While Jaiswal has fallen away after a fine century in Perth and got out to soft dismissals off Mitchell Starc and Scott Boland, there have been questions raised over Gill's technique following his inability to convert starts. Rohit Sharma , however, said it would be unwise to tinker with their mindset and technique at this stage of their careers.""Gill, Jaiswal, they're both in the same boat. You don't want to be telling Jaiswal too many things about his batting. He has come here for the first time and already shown what he's capable of. You don't want to tamper too much with his mindset. Let him be as free as possible and not overburdened with too many thoughts regarding his batting. He understands his batting more than any of us. It's about trying to figure out certain areas of his game."" Rohit said, adding, ""Every venue here has different challenges. It's about adapting. The bowlers are the same. They've got four seamers and one offspinner. It's about understanding what they usually do and what their plans are against certain batters.""Gill, meanwhile, has struggled overseas. Since the 91 against Australia in Brisbane in 2021, he has not crossed 40 in 16 innings in Tests played in New Zealand, England, Australia, West Indies and South Africa.""Both innings in Adelaide, I thought Gill looked pretty good. He just didn't convert that start into a big score. I'm not going to look too much into Brisbane, he got out early,"" Rohit said. ""These tours can be challenging. It's not that easy to put on those big runs every time you step out. Gill has quality. It's just about backing that quality. Like Jaiswal, we don't want to complicate too many things with him.""Rohit, who has hit a horror patch of form himself, seems fit to play after injuring his knee during training earlier. On Tuesday, he pleased crowds at the open nets but seemed displeased when asked if he would continue to bat in the middle order. ""Let's not worry about that. Who bats where is something we need to figure out among ourselves. It's not a thing I should be discussing at every press conference, where I'm batting.""","Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill are India's next rung of elite batters.

(AP)

Excerpts:

Why did you and Ebden decide not to pursue the partnership in 2025?

What was your thinking behind partnering Nicolás Barrientos?

You partnered Sriram Balaji for the Olympics, was he an option?

You’ve announced you’re playing with Barrientos for just two tournaments, Adelaide and then the Australian Open…

Is 2025 your farewell season?

What did your success in that 12-month stretch from mid-2023 to the summer of 2024 tell you about yourself?

How does the future of Indian tennis look at this stage?

IN NUMBERS

At the start of the year Rohan Bopanna gave himself the best pre-44th birthday gift when he claimed the World No.1 ranking and clinched his first men’s doubles Grand Slam title in a spectacular 2024 Australian Open fortnight, where he became the poster boy for longevity.The Indian rode that wave with Matthew Ebden into the summer after which their season lost some shine, bringing to an end a strong partnership. Bopanna, ranked 15, starts the 2025 season down under in starkly different circumstances – pairing with the 37-year-old Colombian Nicolás Barrientos – but is no less determined to keep going.To me and my coach Scott (Davidoff) it came as a surprise, I don't think either of us expected it. I mean he had some reasons, he wanted to change.Initially, during the US Open, he said he was going to play with Austin Krajicek, but I think that fell apart and then he came back saying he wants to play with me. Then during the Paris Masters the Belgians — Joran Vliegen and Sanders Gille — split, when he decided he wanted to play with Vliegen. I don't know what the real reason behind that was.He was the one available, Ebden said he wanted to play with Joran Vliegen literally five days before Turin (in November). It was so late in the season, everybody already had a partner. One of the reasons to pair with Barrientos (ranked 49) was because there's a good chance for us to be seeded, especially because we’re going into a Grand Slam.It was going to be a random pairing anyway no matter who I played with, so I thought I might as well play with somebody who I can be seeded with at least. Especially since I'm defending the title. Also, he’s very strong off the baseline, he's very quick and makes a lot of balls and that game style could work for me. I've played against him but not really hung out with him so much. Even when I played with Ebden it was similar right.He was also set with another partner, same with Yuki Bhambri.One of the reasons we said only two tournaments is because it depends where we both are ranked after the Australian Open. If I don’t defend points, my ranking drops, so then no way Barrientos and me are getting into Masters or 500 Series draws. I haven't fixed with anybody else after (Australia) because it all depends on where I am ranked and where Barrientos is ranked.Everybody has been asking me the same thing for the last two years. It is tough (to think about retirement) when for the last two years, I've qualified for the season-ending championships. When you're making the ATP Finals it means you have had a good enough season so there is no reason really to stop.As long as I'm feeling fit and physically ready to play the Masters and the Grand Slams, it (retiring) is not even a consideration.The biggest thing was how well I was feeling physically and that translated into how well I ended up playing. As a team Ebden and I were doing incredibly well, we complimented each other beautifully. What changed personally for me was that belief of being able to perform at a high level and not looking at it in terms of whether I was (doing it) at age 40, at the fag end of my career or not.First and foremost for the future of Indian tennis, we need the federation to be sorted out, all tournaments juniors or seniors are determined through a solid federation. We need to create a strong domestic circuit. More than everybody looking to play Futures, Challengers, yes we need that, but I think a strong domestic circuit (is what we need the most). Also, once a player crosses 18 they are kind of lost because there’s no platform for them to transition to the next level so players in that age-group are giving up the sport because it is too expensive to travel. In the domestic circuit, there is hardly any prize money so nobody really wants to travel. The domestic circuit needs to grow, something similar to golf maybe.Bopanna claimed the World No.1 ranking after winning his first major doubles title at the 2024 Australian Open becoming the oldest first-time No. 1 at the age of 43.Bopanna and Ebden won the 2024 Miami Masters. At the age of 44, Bopanna overtook his own record to become the oldest ATP Masters 1000 finalist and champion.",Rohan Bopanna will play with Nicolás Barrientos for just two tournaments in 2025. The World No.15 is determined to keep going after winning the Australian Open. Bopana says the future of Indian tennis is in the juniors.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116646135,imgsize-115188,width-400,resizemode-4/116646135.jpg"
Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Boxing Day Test: Are India ready to make changes to ensure spearhead Jasprit Bumrah gets reinforcement?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/boxing-day-test-are-india-ready-to-make-changes-to-ensure-spearhead-jasprit-bumrah-gets-reinforcement/articleshow/116645810.cms,"Jasprit Bumrah, Rohit Sharma and Gautam Gambhir at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

Rohit Sharma: 'Virat Kohli is a modern day great. He will figure it out'

MELBOURNE: What must India do to take 20 wickets at the MCG? As skipper Rohit Sharma , head coach Gautam Gambhir and chief selector Ajit Agarkar were having a long discussion at the team's training session on Tuesday, Prasidh Krishna was seen wheeling away in the pace sets, as he has all through the series, bowling sharp and often troubling the frontline batters.Meanwhile, Nitish Kumar Reddy, who has contributed important cameos lower down the order but been unimpressive as a fourth medium-pacer, went through a long batting stint.India have some serious thinking to do about their combination ahead of the pivotal fourth Test. With the pitch here expected to assist the faster bowlers, should India play an additional pacer at the expense of the batting allrounder Reddy? Prasidh, remember, had a good game against Australia A at the same venue in early November, taking 4/50 in the first innings and 2/37 in the second.Or, with Ravindra Jadeja seemingly a certainty after his heroics with the bat in Brisbane, should Washington Sundar come in as second spinner in a holding role to provide relief to pace regulars Jasprit Bumrah Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep?With some of their batting stalwarts in fading form and the new Kookaburra ball tending to dominate the bat in these conditions, taking a call on depleting the batting further - especially with Reddy in some form - could be a tricky call for the think-tank.Reddy's strike rate of 72.17 is the highest among Indian batters with 100-plus runs in this series. His seven sixes are the most on either side. He's taken the attack to the opposition even with his team in trouble, but bowled just 7 overs each in Perth and Adelaide across both innings and 13 overs in Brisbane.India are known to be cryptic about their lineup ahead of a game and Rohit spoke in riddles when asked about the combination. ""I had a look at the pitch and it has quite a bit of grass covering,"" he said. ""We're certainly considering the weather factor as well (a heat wave is predicted on Boxing Day). Whatever we have to do to make the best possible XI, we'll do that, whether it is playing an extra spinner or not. We'll see how much grass remains on the wicket, how much spinners will be used. This doesn't look like a dry wicket to me.""Should India go in unchanged instead? One pointer could be the recent past, and what the team has done in pace-friendly conditions in South Africa, England and Australia in recent times.India's win in the first Test of this series in Perth came when both Reddy and Sundar were played, but then a slot had opened up in Rohit's absence. The win against South Africa in Cape Town at the beginning of the year saw four frontline pacers in action in Bumrah, Siraj, Krishna and Mukesh Kumar, but that wasn't a tough call as conditions were conducive to extreme pace.Here, at the MCG, there could be long, attritional phases of the game when the seamers might tire out.India don't have an allrounder like Shardul Thakur, who was part of the bowling lineup in two memorable overseas wins in 2021, against South Africa in Centurion and England at the Oval, where he played a pivotal role with both bat and ball. The other big Test win that year, at Lord's, saw four frontline seamers in Bumrah, Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Shami and Siraj, apart from the lone spinner in Jadeja.India played both Jadeja and Ashwin in their last Test win at the MCG in 2020, turning the series around with an 8-wicket win after the 36-all-out debacle in the previous Test in Adelaide. That Jadeja and Ashwin could both bat were big plusses.Rohit was more forthright while addressing the unhealthy reliance on Bumrah, who has seemed in otherworldly form even as others like Siraj have not stepped up enough.""It's a challenge to handle not just the bowling but the entire team,"" he said. ""Nobody comes here not to perform. But when somebody is in form, we have to make the most of that. Bumrah is certainly making the most of it. Siraj and the others who are bowling around him know they need to step up. They're trying hard but have been a bit unlucky. Siraj has shown great attitude.""As for Bumrah, India's Atlas in this series, Rohit appeared as much in awe as the rest of the cricketing world. ""With him in this form, all that the other bowlers have to do is just maintain the pressure. He has crystal-clear ideas and keeps it simple. It makes it very easy for me as captain. It's nice to see that a lot of the opposition players talk about him. The impact he's had on the series is massive. Hopefully he'll continue to do that because these two games are very important for us.""It's in the cauldron of the MCG that the series may eventually be decided. One wrong move here and the campaign could stutter. Whether India go in unchanged, opt for another spinner or an extra pacer, it's Bumrah who will still work the magic. The think-tank merely has to make it easy for him with their choice of support cast.","India have some serious thinking to do about their combination ahead of the pivotal fourth Test. Prasidh Krishna was seen wheeling away in the pace sets, as he has all through the series.

Australia XI:

Australia's in-form batter and India's nemesis Travis Head passed a fitness test on Wednesday to retain his place in Australia's playing eleven, which the hosts announced on the eve of the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne .Announcing the eleven playing members for the match in Melbourne Cricket Ground beginning on Thursday, captain Pat Cummins confirmed the two expected changes.""Trav's good to go, he'll play,"" said the home team's captain . ""He just kicked off some final things today and yesterday. But no worries about injury with Trav. He'll go into the game fully fit.""Opener Sam Konstas will make his debut, replacing Nathan McSweeney, and pacer Scott Boland returned to the eleven for the injured Josh Hazlewood.Head suffered a quad strain during the third Test in Brisbane and his fitness was under a cloud, until he passed the fitness Test held on Thursday during the Christmas Day optional training session, which included various running drills.Cummins also revealed that Head, the leading run-scorer of this series so far, also had a short net session. However, the team might have to manage if he feels any discomfort while fielding during the match.""I don't think you'll see too much management of him throughout the game. He just kind of plays as is. Maybe around fielding, if he's a bit uncomfortable, we will (manage him), but he's fully fit,"" said Cummins.Head leads the batting charts by a mile, having scored 409 runs in his five innings so far at an average of 81.80, including two centuries. The second-placed batter in the list is India's KL Rahul with 235 runs in six innings.""It feels like the last 12 months, he's been in this unbelievable vein of form and he just keeps going on with it,"" said the Aussie pacer. ""He's hitting the ball really cleanly. You can see the pressure that he shifts back onto the opposition literally from the first ball that he walks out there.""I'm loving that he's in our team and I don't have to try to set a field and bowl to him. He's hitting the ball as well as I've ever seen anyone. So long may it continue.""With the Border Gavaskar Trophy and a place in the World Test Championship final at stake, the five-Test series is delicately placed at 1-1 after three matches. India won the first Test in Perth by 295 runs, and Australia came back to level things up with a 10-wicket victory in the pink-ball Test in Adelaide.The third Test at the Gabba in Brisbane ended in a draw.Usman Khawaja, Sam Konstas, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Mitch Marsh, Alex Carey (wk), Pat Cummins (c), Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Scott Boland","Travis Head passes fitness test to retain place in Australia's XI for Boxing Day Test.

Former India coach and all-rounder Ravi Shastri believes that while Joe Root and Kane Williamson have stood out this year in Test cricket, the other two members of the 'Fab Four' -- Virat Kohli and Steve Smith -- remain ""dangerous because they are hungry"" as they haven't scored big consistently of late.""I think they (Kohli and Smith) would have slipped down the ranks on current form because...you've got the likes of Root taking off, there's Williamson doing well, Harry Brook has come onto the scene...There are a lot of other young players pushing, but these are class players,"" Shastri said on the recent episode of The ICC Review.England's Root has had a fabulous 2024, scoring 1556 runs in 17 matches at an average of 55.77, including six centuries. Former New Zealand captain Williamson, too, has scored over a thousand runs this year, with his tally standing at 1013 runs at an average of 59.58, including four centuries.""In a situation like this, you know they (Kohli and Smith) will be dangerous because they'll be hungry,"" reckoned Shastri.Both Kohli and Smith have shown signs of returning to form in the ongoing Border Gavaskar Trophy, where they have hit a hundred each. But their overall Test numbers this year are nowhere near Root and Williamson's.Kohli has scored 376 runs so far in 9 matches, averaging 25.06. Smith has made 337 runs in 8 matches at an average of 28.08.""What’s needed you saw from Smith. It might have been a struggle early on (during his century knock in Brisbane) but he was prepared to play the waiting game and be disciplined,"" said Shastri.""I think the same with Virat. If Virat gets over that first 30-40 minutes with serious application and discipline, I don’t think he's (out of form), none of these guys are out of form.""Kohli began the tour of Australia with a century (100 not out) in the second innings of the opening Test in Perth, which played a key role in India's 295-run victory. However, his other four knocks read 5, 7, 11, 3.Kohli and Smith will take guard in one more Test before the end of the year, when India and Australia meet in the Boxing Date Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.","Ravi Shastri believes Virat Kohli and Steve Smith would have slipped down the ranks on current form.

Australia Playing XI:

Australia announced their playing eleven on Christmas day for the fourth Test against India, beginning in Melbourne on Thursday, with two changes from the team that played in Brisbane.There's a sigh of relief in the camp as the in-form batter Travis Head passed his fitness test on Wednesday to retain his place, as confirmed by captain Pat Cummins who also revealed the two changes.Teenager Sam Konstas 's international debut, replacing opener Nathan McSweeney, has been officially confirmed, while Scott Boland will take the place of injured pacer Josh Hazlewood.Konstas, aged 19, is set to become the youngest Australian to make his Test debut since Cummins played his debut match against South Africa at Johannesburg in November 2011 as an 18-year-old.Konstas threw his hat in the ring with a century (107 off 97 balls) against the Indian team during the pink-ball warm-up match at the Manuka Oval in Canberra.""I just remember being really excited and it's similar for Sammy this week,"" said Cummins. ""There's a level of naivety that you just want to go out and play, like you do when you were a kid in the backyard; you just want to take the game on and have fun and not overthink.""That's the message to Sam. That's definitely how I felt as an 18-year-old. I was just really excited, and once the game started, you go into game-mode and it's just like any other game.""Cummins also expressed his relief to see Head passing the fitness test to stay in the eleven. The left-handed batter leads the series' scoring charts with 409 runs in five innings at an average of 81.80, including two centuries.""It feels like the last 12 months, he's been in this unbelievable vein of form and he just keeps going on with it,"" said the skipper. ""He's hitting the ball really cleanly. You can see the pressure that he shifts back onto the opposition literally from the first ball that he walks out there.""I'm loving that he's in our team and I don't have to try to set a field and bowl to him. He's hitting the ball as well as I've ever seen anyone. So long may it continue.""Usman Khawaja, Sam Konstas, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Mitch Marsh, Alex Carey, Pat Cummins (capt), Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Scott Boland",Australia announce playing eleven for fourth Test against India.

Sam Konstas on facing Jasprit Bumrah and comparisons with Shane Watson

Nineteen-year-old Sam Konstas is set to debut in the Boxing Day Test, becoming the 468th Australian men's Test cricketer. This will make him the youngest Australian Test debutant since Pat Cummins in 2011.Konstas's inclusion was confirmed by coach Andrew McDonald on Tuesday, ahead of the fourth Test between Australia and India. He will be the youngest player to wear the Baggy Green since an 18-year-old Cummins debuted in 2011.Konstas struck 107 from 97 balls against India three weeks ago in a practice match. India's attack in Canberra that day included Akash Deep, Mohammed Siraj and Ravindra Jadeja.The last time Konstas played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, he made 73 not out for Australia A against India A.Konstas will become Australia’s youngest ever Test opener and fourth youngester debutant when he steps up to the MCG. But McDonald said he had the temperament to succeed.“He’s been very similar to what I’ve seen on the outside … he’s composed, relaxed,” McDonald said.“He’ll play Boxing Day, so I’ll get that one out of the way.“What he’s shown is an array of shots and an ability to put pressure back on his opponents.”However, Travis Head 's participation in the crucial Test against India is uncertain. He suffered a quad strain during the third Test at the Gabba.“He picked up a quad strain during the third Test at the Gabba.” said McDonald.McDonald expressed confidence in Head's recovery but acknowledged there were still fitness tests to be cleared. The coach remains hopeful Head will be fit to play.Head, who didn't train on Monday due to the issue, did get involved on Tuesday with a short stint in the nets when he received throw downs for about 20 minutes.Head had a lengthy chat with McDonald and team physio Nick Jones before returned to the dressing room.Other batters Steve Smith, Usman Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne, meanwhile, had extended periods in the nets facing the likes of Mitchell Starc.Scott Boland is near-certain to replace Josh Hazlewood in the playing XI. This despite McDonald's prediction that the extreme heat expected on day one will make the MCG pitch less bowler-friendly than usual. McDonald anticipates a flatter surface due to the high temperatures.",Sam Konstas is set to make his Test debut against India in the Boxing Day Test at the MCG.

Jacob Bethell: A 'generational talent' in the making?

Caribbean roots, cricketing dreams

The evolution of Jacob Bethell: From classy Test batter to explosive white-ball cricketer

Stadium Walkthrough series: Inside The Gabba

What can RCB expect from young Bethell?

NEW DELHI: The cricketing fixture between Rugby School and Marlborough College, two of Britain’s most historic independent schools, is a cherished tradition in the English sporting calendar. Dating back to the mid-1800s with the only recent interruption being the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted life as we knew it, this storied rivalry holds a special place in the hearts of cricket buffs across Wiltshire and Warwickshire.In 2021, during one such historic encounter, English cricket was on the brink of discovering what Indian spinner R Ashwin has recently described as a potential ""generational talent"". The player in question? None other than Royal Challengers Bengaluru 's newest Rs 2.6 crore recruit, Jacob Bethell .Representing the shades of Rugby School, where he honed his cricketing skills after moving to the UK, Jacob Bethell chose the first innings of the annual two-day fixture to demonstrate his overall mettle. With a stunning knock of 202, he caught the attention of many, including Michael Powell, Rugby School’s Director of Cricket and a former Warwickshire captain.""We had scored over 400 before tea on the first day, with Jacob contributing 200 of those runs. He was playing at a different level from everyone else that day. Then, he went on to take nine or ten wickets in the match as well. The way he went about his business was remarkable,"" recalled Michael during an exclusive interaction with TimesofIndia.com.Michael Powell, however, finds it hard to decide what is more remarkable — the dazzling innings from that fixture or the meteoric rise of young Jacob Bethell, now 21.Over the past few months, Bethell has achieved what few can claim: making his ODI, T20I, and Test debuts within the span of just three months. Even more striking, he became the first English batter since Mike Gatting in 1978 to earn a Test cap without a first-class century to his name, showcasing the high regard in which England Cricket holds him.Coach Michael is a firm believes that his protégé Jacob is destined for greatness. Hailing from a family deeply rooted in cricket — his father and grandfather both being former professional cricketers — Jacob has justified his decision to leave the Caribbean and test his legacy with the willow in the UK.""I took a call from a good friend of ours who was on a cricket tour in Barbados - a cricket tour that I had set up at my previous school in Scotland but had subsequently left. This friend, whose sons were in my boarding house because I was a housemaster there, said that there was a young boy, about 11 years old, who was smashing all their 17-and 18-year-old bowlers around Barbados at the moment. He used to work with the boy's father, Graham Bethell, and that was my first point of contact,"" shared Michael.""He put me in touch with Graham and Giselle Bethell, Jacob's parents, and we started a dialogue. Eventually, they brought Jacob to Rugby School. I then took him over to Edgbaston, to Warwickshire, and introduced him to the academic director, Paul Greetham. That’s how it all began. They explored quite a few schools in the UK because Jacob had trained with the Franklyn Stephenson Academy before. Eventually, they decided on Warwickshire and Rugby School.""Recalling his first meeting with Jacob around a decade ago, the former Warwickshire cricketer continued, ""Jacob was only 11 years old when he first came to visit. He met me, and we had a great afternoon looking around the school. I had already seen a few videos that had been sent to me, including one that has since become quite famous on Instagram — showing him pulling shots as a very young 10-year-old batsman [batter] in the West Indies.""Barbados-born-and-raised, Jacob is known for being deeply family-oriented. The 21-year-old manages to carve out time for his father Graham, mother Giselle, and sister Rebecca, who followed her brother's footsteps and joined Cheltenham College a year later, marking a shared commitment to education and opportunity in the UK.The siblings spent around 32 weeks annually in the UK, dedicating the rest of the year to cherished family moments back home in Barbados.The cricketing blood in Jacob’s veins runs deep, with his father Graham spending many years playing for Sheffield Collegiate in England, where he was teammates with Joe Root ’s father, Matthew Root. Meanwhile, his grandfather, Arthur, was the former captain of the Barbados cricket team in the West Indies.""When he was growing up as a youngster, he probably had a bat in his hand by the age of three. Just the way he operated as a young player at the time — in all aspects, batting, bowling, and fielding — was remarkable. He had a really natural bat swing, as if the bat had been in his hands since his earliest days.""Growing up in Barbados, cricket was in the family and in his genes. He lived an outdoor life in Barbados, blessed with good weather. At home, he had a lovely little setup with a rope and a ball at the end of it, and he would spend hours swinging and hitting the ball. His bat swing was incredibly natural,"" noted Michael.Understood to be a natural athlete, Jacob grew up immersed in a variety of sports — surfing on the beaches of Barbados, playing cricket in the sand, and enjoying golf, tennis, and squash. His innate sporting talent has likely been a key factor in his seamless transition from a graceful stroke-maker in Test cricket to a dynamic power-hitter in white-ball formats.""His early setup and approach to batting were very much Test-match-oriented. As a young player, he was very respectful in how he played and left the ball, yet positive in how he looked to score. However, when he was younger, he didn’t have the power he has now. That’s something he’s gained over the last four or five years,"" explained his childhood tutor.From a young age, Jacob was incredibly stylish, particularly excelling against short-pitched bowling, having grown up facing tall West Indian bowlers who frequently bowled bouncers, which helped him develop his ability to handle the short ball.""I remember the first time I saw him bat — a tall West Indian lad ran in, bowled a bouncer, and Jacob pulled it away. Not many 9-or 10-year-olds could do that. He had a real fluency and fluidity in his bat swing, with great energy and rhythm in how he picked up and swung the bat. He handled taller, faster young West Indian bowlers remarkably well,"" Michael said.""His game has since developed to adapt to the modern game, particularly the white-ball format. Now, as we’ve seen more recently, he can hit the ball out of the park. When I first met him, he struggled to hit the ball off the square or in front of the wicket. He was fantastic with the pull shot and a great sweeper of spin bowling but lacked the physical power to pierce gaps in front of the wicket,"" he added, ""Of course, that power develops with time as a young player grows, and now he’s a strong, athletic young man. He has the ability to hit 100-metre sixes just as easily as he can play the softer game: rotating and manipulating the ball with finesse.""With RCB stacking up their top-order with right-handers, Jacob Bethell, as a left-hander, could be the perfect solution. With Virat Kohli and Phil Salt likely to open the innings, Bethell could slot in at No. 3, with Rajat Patidar following at No. 4, creating a balanced lineup. This versatility, along with his handy slow left-arm orthodox bowling and wicket-keeping skills, has many RCB fans predicting that the English talent will be a regular fixture in the playing XI.""To me, he always looked like a top-order batsman. He thinks like a top-order batsman. The nature of T20 cricket, The Hundred, and white-ball cricket, in general, has pushed him to develop his skills further. Fundamentally, his technique is built for Test cricket, but he’s also developed into a very potent white-ball cricketer. You could class him as an all-rounder or a top-order batsman who bowls very effectively, keeps wicket and fields brilliantly,"" Michael told TimesofIndia.comIn terms of attitude, Michael thinks he is a natural leader. ""As a youngster, Jacob was in England's senior team very early on, and he’s always been a natural leader by example. He’s in a fantastic environment, surrounded by the likes of Joe Root, Ben Stokes, Brendon McCullum , and Marcus Trescothick , who have all performed at the highest level for extended periods. He has the benefit of learning from some of the best minds in the game,"" he added.""For him to be put into the IPL auction, to be chosen, and to have the opportunity to play cricket in that environment is incredible. The IPL is the biggest league in the world, and now he has the chance to be around players like Virat Kohli,"" the man, who has seen Jacob blossom in front of his eyes, concluded.""I know Jacob is made for this—he’s been working toward this his whole life. It’s an incredible opportunity for someone who has put in so much effort. I’m sure RCB fans will thoroughly enjoy watching him, as he’s looking forward to becoming part of the RCB family.""","Jacob Bethell is Royal Challengers Bengaluru's newest Rs 2.6 crore recruit.

Nepal's Kushal Malla replaces Bas de Leede at Desert Vipers for ILT20,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/nepals-kushal-malla-replaces-bas-de-leede-at-desert-vipers-for-ilt20/articleshow/116637348.cms,"Kushal Malla

NEW DELHI: Nepal batting all-rounder Kushal Malla has been recruited by the Desert Vipers for the third season of the ILT20 .Malla, who was one of the standout performers in the inaugural Nepal Premier League earlier this month, will replace Netherlands all-rounder Bas de Leede , who has been sidelined due to injury.At just 20 years old – turning 21 a month after the tournament ends – Malla boasts considerable experience in international cricket.The left-handed batter and left-arm spin bowler made his ODI debut at the age of 15 years and 340 days against the USA in February 2020, making him the eighth youngest male player to feature in that format.Malla is Nepal's fifth-highest run-scorer in T20Is, having accumulated 917 runs in 47 matches. His tally includes one century, four fifties, and a strike rate of 147.66, the highest among any Nepal batter with over 500 runs in the format.His century, an unbeaten 137 against Mongolia in the 2023 Asian Games, came off just 50 balls, featuring eight fours and 12 sixes. It is also the highest score by a men's number three batter in T20I history.Malla has scored 768 runs in 39 ODIs, including one century and four fifties, making him one of only four male players to score centuries in both international white-ball formats for Nepal.In addition to his batting, he has taken 43 wickets in ODIs and T20Is. Malla was also part of the Nepal team that competed in the ICC T20 World Cup in the USA and the Caribbean earlier this year.Commenting on the signing of Kushal Malla, Desert Vipers Director of Cricket Tom Moody said: ""We are delighted to welcome Kushal to the Desert Vipers.""He is a young player, but for someone so young he already has a significant amount of experience at a high level so we know he will not be phased by stepping into the Vipers' set-up.""It is also a huge positive that Kushal is coming to us off the back of the Nepal Premier League, playing with and against good players in a competitive environment.""As a batter, Kushal can slot in virtually anywhere, having batted from opener to number seven in Twenty20 Internationals, and his strike-rate in the format shows what a dangerous player he is.""And as a bowler, his left-arm spin offers us an option we were previously missing in our squad so that is a huge plus.""I often speak of players with high ceilings and high potential. That is certainly something that applies to Kushal.""We are obviously sorry to be without the services of Bas this season. He fitted in well to our squad last season and we wish him a speedy recovery from the injury that has sidelined him from this tournament.""In Kushal we feel like we have an outstanding replacement, a player who is hungry to achieve something significant on this type of stage, and we believe that being alongside the high-quality and experienced players we have at the Vipers will help him to realise his undoubted potential.""The ILT20 is the UAE's own Twenty20 cricket tournament. The Desert Vipers, runners-up in the inaugural season in 2023, will start their quest for the 2025 title with a match against the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders at the Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi on day two of the tournament, Sunday 12 January at 2pm.","Kushal Malla has been recruited by the Desert Vipers for the third season of the ILT20.

NEW DELHI: The two modern-day greats, Virat Kohli and Steve Smith , have faced a challenging year in 2024, struggling to make an impact with the bat. In contrast, their fellow ""Fab Four"" members, Kane Williamson and Joe Root , have enjoyed a stellar run, showcasing remarkable form throughout the year.Root and Williamson have been in scintillating form, smashing six and four Test hundreds respectively. In stark contrast, Kohli and Smith have managed just one century each, both scored during the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy .Former Indian cricketer and head coach Ravi Shastri reflected on the shifting fortunes of these players in Test cricket, highlighting the resilience and hunger that continue to make Kohli and Smith formidable opponents despite their recent challenges.""I think they (Kohli and Smith) will have slipped down the ranks on current form because you know you've got the likes of Root taking off, there's Williamson doing well, Harry Brook has come onto the scene, you know there are a lot of other young players pushing but these are class players,"" Shastri said.""In a situation like this, you know they'll be dangerous because they'll be hungry.""Shastri praised Smith's resilience, citing his gritty innings at the Gabba against India, where the Australian maestro notched up his 33rd Test century.""What's needed you saw from Smith. It might have been a struggle early on but he was prepared to play the waiting game and be disciplined,"" Shastri noted.Shastri expressed confidence in Kohli's ability to reclaim his peak form, emphasising that the issue isn't with his overall form but rather with navigating the crucial early phase of his innings.""I think the same with Virat,"" Shastri added. ""If Virat gets over that first 30, 40 minutes, with serious application and discipline, I don't think he's (out of form), none of these guys are out of form.""","Virat Kohli and Steve Smith have faced a challenging year in 2024.

There can be two spinners in Melbourne and Sydney. Australia is concerned about the possibility of missing out on the WTC final if they lose in Melbourne.

As a result, the ICC came up with the idea of organising a tournament, which would be known as the ICC Knockout Trophy.The tournament was held in 1998 in Bangladesh and it included the 9 full member nations of the ICC. South Africa were crowned champions of the inaugural edition by beating the West Indies in the final.The competition was once staged in 2000, this time in Kenya to popularise the sport there.All the 9 Test playing nations plus the top 2 associate nations at the time Bangladesh and hosts Kenya were the participants. New Zealand were the champions of the competition by defeating India in the final. The 1998 and the 2000 editions were in a direct knockout format.In 2002, the competition returned under a new name the ICC Champions Trophy . It was initially to be held in India, however, it was shifted to Sri Lanka as India refused to grant the exemption from tax. The ten Test-playing nations plus the associate nations Kenya and the Netherlands participated.This tournament had a round-robin stage with four pools of 3 teams each. Then the knockouts would follow with the first-placed team from each of the 4 pools playing in the semi-finals. Notably, the final which was held on the 29th of September 2002 was suspended due to rain and moved to the 30th of September.However, as per the ICC rules, 25 overs were not bowled to the side batting second due to rain, the trophy was shared and India and Sri Lanka became the joint-winners of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy Also See: Champions Trophy India matches Venue The 2004 ICC Champions Trophy was hosted by England with 12 participants.

The hosts England were beaten by the West Indies in the Final of the competition.10 full member nations were eligible to participate in the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy held in India. The top six teams according to the ICC ODI table rankings would qualify directly while the lower-placed four teams would play a pre-tournament round-robin qualifying round out of which two teams would qualify for the main tournament.In total 8 teams would play the group stages of the tournament in which there were two groups of 4 teams each. Then the top two teams from the two groups would play the semi-finals. Australia defeated the West Indies in the final in 2006.The next ICC Champions Trophy was to be hosted by Pakistan in 2008, however, due to security concerns, it was moved to South Africa in 2009.
