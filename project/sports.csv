'Biggest AI Summit': Ashwini Vaishnaw Says India AI Impact Summit Getting 'Phenomenal Response'

Artificial intelligence has an exciting role to play in fields like drug discovery, scientific progress and disease treatment. But given the pace at which it is evolving, there is a real prospect of AI becoming more powerful than its creator, warns Tim Berners-Lee, British computer scientist and inventor of the World Wide Web.Humanity will have to figure out to how deal with super intelligence, says Berners-Lee, striking a note of caution at a time when companies and govts seem to be in a race to develop AI without really thinking through the consequences.Speaking to Jaya Bhattacharji Rose, Berners-Lee described ChatGPT as a ""phase change"", which surprised him with its conversational power. He emphasised that the critical question is who an AI works for.He argued for assistants that serve the user's best interests - analogous to a doctor's duty - rather than corporate incentives. He connected this to his Solid project and his company's work on user-controlled data ""pods"", aiming to restore agency by letting individuals control and selectively share their personal data, including in child-safe configurations with parental oversight.Berners-Lee also contrasted the early web's democratic spirit with today's platform-dominated experience. In the beginning, individuals could publish their own websites and participate on equal footing with major institutions.","Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, spoke at India AI Impact Summit.

That iconic triumph laid the foundation for India’s dominance in T20 cricket.The second title, however, came after a long wait. Seventeen years later, India returned to the summit in 2024, with Rohit Sharma leading the side to a memorable title win.

Government confident it did better in battle of wits with opposition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-confident-it-did-better-in-battle-of-wits-with-opposition/articleshow/128180840.cms,"Opposition targets LS Speaker with no-confidence motion — rules, process & numbers – Explained

NEW DELHI: Any hope of normalcy returning to LS was apparently dashed when opposition stepped up their offensive and submitted a notice for the removal of the Speaker. In a twist, it turned out to be the end of a week-long impasse, laying bare faultlines within the opposition as pragmatic voices wanting to be heard on key issues in the House prevailed over those favouring uncompromising rigidity and confrontation.LS functioned normally even though the govt did not agree to the conditions set by Congress: allowing LoP Rahul Gandhi to speak, rectification of the Speaker’s “baseless” claim that he had to request PM not to speak during the debate on motion of thanks to the President for her address in view of plans of Congress’ MPs to do something unprecedented, and a probe into why BJP MP Nishikant Dubey’s mic was not switched off when he attacked Nehru-Gandhi family.The prevailing view within govt was that it had come out better in the battle of wits by not making any concession to the key Congress demand of allowing Rahul to speak first and revoking the suspension of eight MPs to defuse the crisis that had stalled proceedings.What helped the govt defuse the impasse was the keenness among some key regional BJP rivals for LS to function and allow discussion on regional concerns. Bengal and Tamil Nadu, where TMC and DMK are in office, are headed to polls, while political temperature is rising in UP, where Samajwadi Party is the main opposition party, with elections only a year away.While TMC made its differences clear by not signing the notice, MPs from different non-Congress oppn parties suggested many of them did not want the first half of the session to be consumed by the deadlock.Across the aisle, BJP’s allies stood firm with the govt, backing the Speaker and criticising the opposition for targeting a constitutional office.Taking high moral ground, Birla decided not to attend till the notice is disposed of, signalling the matter may be taken up later in the session.",LS functioned normally even though the govt did not agree to the conditions set by Congress.

While Bad Bunny headlined the official NFL show, the rival event blended politics, grief, and culture into a deeply emotional night.

Erika Kirk breaks silence after TPUSA’s halftime tribute divides Super Bowl audience

The night of Super Bowl LX was more than just football and a show. A competing halftime show away from the main broadcast stirred up feelings, controversy, and political symbolism. Turning Point USA pushed its All American Halftime Show as a patriotic alternative, drawing attention not only for its message but for the personal grief woven into the production.In the hours after the show aired, Erika Kirk broke her silence. Her words reframed the night as something deeper than a ratings fight or culture war moment. For supporters, it became a tribute. For critics, it raised fresh questions about politics, platform power, and how grief is carried into public space.The alternative show, organized by Turning Point USA, aired opposite Bad Bunny ’s NFL halftime performance during the championship game between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks. Headlined by Kid Rock, the event leaned heavily into honoring the late Charlie Kirk, who was killed in September.A montage played during the broadcast featured Kirk’s own words, including: “I want to honor God in all that I do. I want to be a great husband, a great father.I want to serve this country,” followed by: “I want to try to continue to lead this movement and to speak truth and to never lie, to stop thinking about yourself all of the time, and instead think about what you should do to help other people and defend this country above yourself.She further added, “I am so inspired by this army of freedom fighters. We’re going to be around for the next 100, 200 years because we know in the end our ideas will win.”Erika Kirk did not attend the event, but she later praised it publicly, calling the show “so incredible” and adding, “Charlie would’ve absolutely loved it. Thank you to the millions that tuned in.”She closed her message with a personal note that resonated across social media: “Ultimately, this is what it’s all about, making Heaven crowded.…I love you Charlie baby, this is all for you.”Despite being blocked from streaming on X, the broadcast claimed millions of viewers across platforms. Whether those numbers hold or not, the emotional weight of the tribute ensured the night would be remembered for more than just music or politics.","Erika Kirk spoke out after Turning Point USA aired its alternative Super Bowl LX halftime show honoring her late husband, Charlie Kirk.

Techie was living separately after frequent quarrels





BENGALURU: A US-returned techie, desperate to raise funds for a new venture, has been arrested on charges of murdering his parents at their villa in Vignan Nagar, near HAL township, in east Bengaluru Wednesday.Naveen Chandra Bhat, 60, a retired navy captain, and his dentist-wife Shyamala Bhat, 55, were residing in Adarsh Vista. The accused is their son Rohan Chandra Bhat, 33. Based on early investigations, police said he repeatedly stabbed his parents around 8am following heated arguments with them.Hearing the commotion, neighbours rushed to the villa and shifted the seriously injured couple to Manipal Hospitals, Old Airport Road. Doctors declared them brought dead. Dr Madhavi Nair, a neighbour and a doctor working with Manipal Hospitals, filed a complaintwith HAL police.According to a senior police officer, Rohan worked as a software engineer in the US and returned to Bengaluru three years ago. Details of his overseas employment and the reasons for his return are yet to be ascertained.A police officer said, “Rohan, a bachelor, was doing projects independently and wanted to scale.He reportedly had anxiety issues. When he found it difficult to raise capital for the projects conceived by him, he started pressuring parents to financially support his projects. The aged couple claimed helplessness stating they were not in a position to meet his demands.This led to frequent quarrels. Some time ago, Rohan shifted to a rented accommodation in Varthur.”Police said Rohan came to the villa Monday night and demanded money from his parents. “The fight escalated by Wednesday morning,” the officer said.Police took Rohan into custody and produced him before a court.“We are yet to question him. His sister, who lives in the US and has been informed of the tragedy, will arrive in Bengaluru by Thursday. The bodies were shifted to Bowring Hospital.

Age, experience, and roster balance

Current status

As of February 2026,has not signed with the Cleveland Guardians. There is no trade and no agreement in place. He is still a free agent. The connection between McCutchen and Cleveland comes from projections and offseason speculation, not from any official announcement.The idea has gained attention because it makes practical sense. Cleveland needs experienced hitting, and McCutchen has said he wants to keep playing. If both sides agree on a short contract and a defined role, a deal would be straightforward.Andrew McCutchen’s one-year, $5 million contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates ended after the 2025 season. Because of that, he can sign with any team without compensation.If Cleveland Guardians moves forward, the contract would likely be for one year in the $2–4 million range, possibly with incentives tied to plate appearances or health. He would project as the designated hitter and could make occasional starts in left or right field.Cleveland’s projected roster remains young.• Outfield: Steven Kwan, Nolan Jones, George Valera, with David Fry as depth.• First base/DH: Kyle Manzardo and C.J. Kayfus, with Kayfus expected to see DH at-bats.Signing McCutchen would likely push Kayfus into more of a platoon role and give manager Stephen Vogt a right-handed hitter to balance a lineup that leans left-handed.Andrew McCutchen hit .239/.333/.367 with 13 home runs and 57 RBIs in 2025. That production is modest but steady for a player entering his age-39 season. He has historically handled right-handed pitching well, which would complement Cleveland’s lineup.He would also add experience to a group built around Bo Naylor, Steven Kwan, Nolan Jones, George Valera, and C.J. Kayfus. The financial risk would be limited because the deal would almost certainly be short-term.McCutchen has said he wants to play in 2026 and has expressed frustration about limited communication from Pittsburgh Pirates’ front office. With Marcell Ozuna expected to fill the DH role there, opportunities appear limited.Cleveland could offer the same type of usage McCutchen has had in recent seasons - mostly DH with limited time in the field.Letting McCutchen walk would create roster space and payroll flexibility while keeping the focus on younger players. Team leadership has also indicated the organization is open to working with him again in some capacity after his playing career.• Adds a right-handed bat for DH and occasional outfield work• Brings experience to a young clubhouse• Requires only a short financial commitment• Age and injury risk, including recent Achilles issues• Could reduce opportunities for younger hitters• Power production is no longer at peak levels• Opportunity to extend his career• Chance to join a competitive rosterCons for McCutchen• Likely a reduced role• Performance decline could affect how his late career is viewedMcCutchen’s numbers are similar to Cleveland’s current DH options but provide more right-handed power.These splits help explain why he could fit as a platoon option against right-handed starters.Andrew McCutchen turns 39 in October 2026 and has played 17 MLB seasons, including 12 with Pittsburgh. He is a five-time All-Star and the 2013 National League MVP.Cleveland Guardians’ projected lineup is younger: Bo Naylor (25), George Valera (25), Kyle Manzardo (25), C.J. Kayfus (24), Nolan Jones (27), and Steven Kwan (28). Aside from Jose Ramirez (33) and reliever Shawn Armstrong (35), the roster has few older players. McCutchen would add experience without needing to play every day.Also read: MLB trade rumors: San Diego Padres consider 15 million San Francisco Giants star to address rotation depth before 2026 season McCutchen remains unsigned. Nothing has been finalized between him and Cleveland. The possibility is reasonable but unresolved, and any deal would depend on Cleveland’s willingness to spend modestly and McCutchen’s interest in leaving Pittsburgh for a new situation.","Andrew McCutchen’s one-year, $5 million contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates ended after the 2025 season.

Poll Will Abhishek Sharma be fit to play against Namibia? Yes, he will recover in time No, he will miss the game

NEW DELHI: India batter Tilak Varma has provided encouraging fitness updates on teammates Abhishek Sharma and Jasprit Bumrah ahead of the side’s ICC T20 World Cup encounter against Namibia at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, while adding that final decisions on their participation will be taken closer to match time.Abhishek had been hospitalised earlier this week after suffering a stomach infection and missed training on Tuesday evening.

Speaking at the pre-match press conference on Wednesday, Tilak revealed that the left-hander has now been discharged and is recovering well.“When we reached Delhi, he (Abhishek) went to the hospital for the examination. I think he was discharged today, and he is doing well. We have got one more day for the game. Hopefully, we will decide by tomorrow how he feels, and we will go with it,” Tilak said.If Abhishek fails to recover in time, Sanju Samson could partner Ishan Kishan at the top of the order.Tilak also addressed concerns around pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, who missed India’s campaign opener against the USA.The left-handed batter sounded optimistic about the star pacer’s return.“He (Bumrah) is absolutely fine now. He is doing better. As I said, we have got one more day. Hopefully, he will be back in the team. If he is doing better, the team will take a call. I think he will be back tomorrow for the second game,” he added.Beyond the Namibia clash, Tilak said the team is already gearing up for the high-voltage contest against Pakistan in Colombo on February 15. “We are very excited to play… We are watching how other teams are doing, and the preparation is on. Now we are in the match zone, and the planning will start soon,” he concluded.","Tilak Varma says Abhishek Sharma has been discharged from hospital.

Poll What do you think is Pakistan's biggest strength in cricket? Bowling Attack Batting Flexibility Unique Identity Team Spirit

NEW DELHI: Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha struck a confident and defiant tone after guiding his side to a convincing 32-run victory over the United States in their Group A clash at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, declaring that the team’s unique cricketing identity remains their biggest strength.Reflecting on the performance at the Sinhalese Sports Club, Agha summed up his team’s philosophy with a dramatic line that captured attention: “We are Pakistan, we do things differently to the world.”The Pakistan skipper, known for his calm demeanour, appeared relaxed during the post-match presentation as he praised a much-improved batting effort, particularly through the middle overs. “I always smile. When have you seen me not smile? (laughs). Clinical win. Last game we didn't bat well in the middle overs, but today we did. Once we scored 190, we knew we could defend that,” he said.Agha revealed that he would have preferred to bat first regardless of the toss, expressing full faith in Pakistan’s bowling attack to defend even modest totals. According to him, the team’s belief in setting targets reflects their fearless mindset and willingness to challenge conventional strategies.“With the kind of bowling we have, we know we can win even with 160-170,” he added.Despite that preference, the captain emphasised the adaptability within Pakistan’s batting order, highlighting a flexible approach that allows the side to respond to different match situations. “We’re comfortable with chasing as well. Our batting order is flexible. First three will probably go in the same order, but we’re flexible after that,” Agha explained, pointing to the presence of finishers who can be promoted if required or held back to close out games.While pleased with the result, Agha stressed that the team still has areas to refine, especially with the ball in the powerplay. “Always room for improvement. We like to bowl well in the powerplay. In patches we were good, but we can be more clinical,” he said.With momentum building and a high-profile clash with India on the horizon, Pakistan’s captain believes their unconventional mindset could be the difference-maker.",Pakistan beat the United States by 32 runs at the ICC Men's T20 World Cup.

Abhishek Sharma in hospital - latest on his recovery and India nets

The ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 continues on February 12 with three key group-stage fixtures: Sri Lanka vs Oman, Nepal vs Italy, and India vs Namibia.Sri Lanka will face Oman after registering a 20-run win over Ireland in their previous outing. Oman, meanwhile, will be playing their first match of the tournament. However, Sri Lanka have suffered a setback ahead of the clash, as Wanindu Hasaranga has been ruled out of the World Cup due to injury. Dushan Hemantha has been named as his replacement. The match will be played at the Pallekele Stadium in Sri Lanka, starting at 11 am IST.In the second game of the day, Nepal take on Italy at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai at 3 pm IST. Nepal enter the contest high on confidence after nearly pulling off a stunning upset against two-time T20 World Cup winners England. Nepal fell short by just four runs, which was also the second-lowest winning margin for a Full Member nation against an Associate team. Italy, on the other hand, come into the match after suffering a 73-run defeat to Scotland.The third fixture will see India face Namibia at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi at 7 pm IST. India are coming off a 29-run win over the USA, but there is a concern in the camp. Opener Abhishek Sharma is likely to miss the game due to a stomach infection, accompanied by high fever and severe weight loss. Sanju Samson , who was the designated first-choice wicketkeeper ahead of the World Cup, is likely to open the batting. Samson was dropped for Ishan Kishan because of a poor run of form in the New Zealand series. Namibia head into the match after a seven-wicket loss to the Netherlands.","ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 continues on February 12 with three key group-stage fixtures: Sri Lanka vs Oman, Nepal vs Italy, and India vs Namibia.

YesJulz makes it clear about entertaining any NFL player who is in a committed relationship



YesJulz has been rumored to be dating LeBron James previously



YesJulz, the popular social media influencer and entrepreneur, has constantly been rumored to be dating many athletes, including LeBron James While YesJulz has constantly denied any rumors of an alleged affair, the popular social media influencer has now made it clear to the NFL players about “sliding into her DMs”.A few hours ago, just after the Seattle Seahawks won Super Bowl LX by defeating the New England Patriots in an epic match, YesJulz took to her X to make a controversial post.The post read as, “If you slide in my DM's and I go to your page & see a post with you & you're wife, I'm screen shotting and sending to her immediately.”The popular entrepreneur and talent manager added, “And idgaf if you just won the Super Bowl. It's time people adopted some morals.”A few hours later, YesJulz made another controversial post that read as, “Honestly love that I tweeted that yesterday bc now all of my DM’s start with “I am not married and do not have a girlfriend…” 🤣”The former Kanye West’s talent manager added, “Like yes let’s get straight to the important details. Amazing.”This has also led to panic among fans as many applaud her for her strong stance on infidelity.A fan by the username @Kanph1t wrote, “Even winning the Super Bowl won’t save you from accountability…”, while another fan by the username @Joanna9424 posted, “The cheating men in the comments big mad 😂”A third fan by the username @Hesamonster615 wrote, “As a guy, trying to act like she’s doing something wrong is crazy.This happens all the time, just on a smaller scale. She just happens to be a famous nobody, and an NFL player slid in her DMs. No different than the guy down the street—they’re just not famous.”Another fan by the username @nanzhater joked, “My messy a*s wanna know who…”However, despite the chaos it sparked among fans, YesJulz stayed away from commenting on if she is referring to someone particular in her post.Over the last few years, YesJulz and NBA legend LeBron James faced major trolling as many believed that he cheated on his wife with her.While LeBron James and his wife have always stayed distant from the drama, YesJulz has always made it clear that there was never any alleged affair between them.","YesJulz has been rumored to be dating many athletes, including LeBron James.

How to confirm his status before the game

for theagainst the Orlando Magic on Wednesday,. He is not listed on the official injury report, which usually indicates that a player is fully available. Unless there is a late change before the game, Flagg should take on his usual role in the starting lineup.His availability comes at an important time for Dallas. The team has leaned on him heavily in recent weeks, and with injuries affecting other key players, Flagg remains central to their offensive structure.Cooper Flagg sprained his left ankle in mid-January during a game against the Denver Nuggets. He missed a few games afterward and was briefly given questionable and doubtful tags for matchups against Utah and Minnesota.Since returning, he has practiced without restriction, played extended minutes, and has stayed off injury reports. Coverage before the Mavericks’ February 10 game against the Phoenix Suns also noted that he was participating normally and considered available.There have been no new concerns reported ahead of the Orlando game. As of February 11, the Mavericks have not flagged the ankle or any other injury.Dallas Mavericks enters the contest with a 19-34 record and sits near the bottom of the Southwest Division.Flagg has been one of the team’s most consistent contributors, averaging about 19 points, six to seven rebounds, and five to six assists per game while adding defensive production through steals and blocks.His role becomes more important with Kyrie Irving still out because of a knee injury and Klay Thompson listed as day-to-day. Dallas needs Flagg’s ball-handling, scoring, and passing to maintain offensive balance against an Orlando team known for its size.Flagg is expected to start alongside Max Christie, Tyus Jones, and Klay Thompson if Thompson is cleared to play. Daniel Gafford or P.J. Washington is likely to fill the remaining frontcourt spot.He is projected to play around 32 to 36 minutes and should remain the primary option in the offense.Player designations can change after morning shootaround, so checking closer to tip-off is recommended. Fans can review the NBA’s official injury report or follow team accounts and local reporters for updates.For fantasy and betting decisions, Flagg should be considered expected to play, with only a small chance of a last-minute scratch.Also read: Milwaukee Bucks vs Orlando Magic injury report: Who's playing, injured and questionable players, head-to-head records, team stats, and more (February 11, 2026) As of February 11, 2026, Cooper Flagg is healthy and on track to play when the Mavericks face the Magic.

Theon Wednesday,, in a game that matters for both teams as they try to stay in the playoff race. Atlanta is 26-29 and third in the Southeast Division, while Charlotte is close behind at 25-29 in fourth place. With little separating them in the standings, this result could become important later in the season.The teams have already split their earlier meetings, and another tight game is expected. Player availability could shape the matchup, as Atlanta is tracking several injuries while Charlotte is missing depth in the backcourt.Atlanta Hawks may have to make game-time decisions on key players.• Jonathan Kuminga (bone bruise, left knee)• RayJ Dennis (out; G-League assignment status)• Caleb Houstan (G-League assignment)• Jalen Johnson (left knee inflammation; day-to-day)• Dyson Daniels (right ankle inflammation)• Zaccharie Risacher (left quadriceps contusion)Nickeil Alexander-Walker, CJ McCollum, Buddy Hield, Onyeka Okongwu, Christian Koloko, Mouhamed Gueye, Nikola Đurišić, Gabe Vincent, Keaton Wallace, Jock Landale, Asa Newell, and the rest of the active roster are expected to play unless there is a late update.Atlanta has lost its last two games, including a 138-116 defeat in Minnesota. Johnson’s availability is especially important because of his role in scoring and playmaking.Charlotte Hornets have fewer injuries but is still dealing with absences that affect guard depth behind LaMelo Ball.• Coby White (left calf strain; expected to miss time through the All-Star break)• Liam McNeeley (sprained left ankle)G-League / two-way assignments:• Tosan Evbuomwan• Antonio ReevesLaMelo Ball, Miles Bridges, Brandon Miller, Josh Green, Tre Mann, Collin Sexton, Pat Connaughton, Grant Williams, Tidjane Salaun, PJ Hall, Ryan Kalkbrenner, Mason Plumlee, Sion James, Kon Knueppel, KJ Simpson, and the rest of the active roster are expected to play.With White and McNeeley out, players such as Knueppel, James, and Simpson could see more minutes off the bench.Atlanta’s performance could depend on whether Johnson and Daniels are cleared before tip-off. If they do not play, the offense is likely to rely more on McCollum in half-court situations, with Hield providing perimeter shooting. Charlotte still has its main lineup of Ball, Miller, Bridges, and Sexton, but the bench could be tested.The season series has been competitive, with each team winning on the other’s home floor. Charlotte defeated Atlanta on February 7, ending a short losing streak and entering this game with some momentum.Atlanta holds a slight edge in the all-time regular-season series, but Charlotte has been more competitive since LaMelo Ball joined the team and following recent roster changes. With both teams near .500, this game carries added importance.Atlanta’s offense often runs through Johnson and McCollum, while Charlotte depends on Ball to create opportunities and on Miller for scoring. Neither team has been dominant defensively, which could lead to a higher-scoring game.Atlanta’s approach may change depending on injuries. If Johnson and Daniels play, the Hawks can push the pace more effectively. If not, the offense may slow down.Charlotte continues to adjust its rotation with White unavailable and is relying on its starting group for production. Matchups in the paint against Okongwu, Koloko, and Gueye could also matter.Both teams remain within reach of the sixth to eighth seeds in the Eastern Conference, so head-to-head results in February could affect the standings later.This game is likely to be shaped by player availability and execution. Atlanta’s chances improve if Johnson and Daniels are active, while Charlotte will look for steady play from Ball and consistent scoring from Miller.Monitor injury updates before the game, as they could influence how the matchup unfolds.","Atlanta Hawks face Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday (February 11, 2026) The teams have already split their earlier meetings, and another tight game is expected.

Panthers forward Matthew Tkachuk all set to display peak form for Olympic debut with Team USA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/panthers-forward-matthew-tkachuk-all-set-to-display-peak-form-for-olympic-debut-with-team-usa/articleshow/128223730.cms,"Matthew Tkachuk, a star forward for the Florida Panthers, feels he's in peak form for his Olympic debut with Team USA against Latvia. Recovered from a significant injury that sidelined him for much of the NHL season, Tkachuk is eager to showcase his skills, aiming to help the U.S. secure its first Olympic gold medal in decades.





Matthew Tkachuk is at his best as the Panthers forward plays with Team USA against Latvia

As Team USA is all set to lock horns against Team Latvia at Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena on Thursday, NHL forward Matthew Tkachuk has declared that he is at his best form heading into his Olympic debut with Team USA against Latvia. The Florida Panthers star seems very confident about his preparations as he timed his recovery perfectly from a major injury.It is to be noted that the forward suffered from a major injury where he sustained a torn adductor muscle and sports hernia while playing for the United States in the 4 Nations Face-Off last season. He missed the final 25 games of the regular season. However, he returned Jan. 19 when the Panthers were seventh in the Atlantic Division and 12th in the Eastern Conference. Fortunately, the star forward managed to play 10 games before the Olympics and had eight points (three goals, five assists). Florida Panthers star forward Matthew Tkachuk said he feels in top form as he prepares to make his Olympic debut for the United States men's hockey team at the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Milano Cortina, Italy.The player who underwent a tough surgery due to an injury that he sustained during the 4 Nations Face-Off, prompted the club to sideline him for much of the NHL season.Owing to this situation, he has struggled with uncertainty about his readiness early in the year. However, after returning to play for the Panthers and contributing in recent games, the 27-year-old admitted that he feels ""at my best"" and is ready to showcase his abilities against the world's top teams, as stated by NHL.com.""I'm at my best. I expect to be at my best, and there's no better time to show it off than now,"" Tkachuk stated very confidently about his game. As reported by the NHL, he was one of the first six players named to Team USA's Olympic roster. But the NHL player had to undergo a major surgery on August 22, for which he could not make it to the United States Men's Olympic Orientation Camp in Plymouth, Michigan.Head coach Mike Sullivan and Team USA officials see Tkachuk are seeing him as a key offensive and leadership presence. Sharing his concern for Tkachuk, Sullivan stated, ""I was very concerned, because he's a really important player for our team -- not only on the ice, but off the ice.""""In a lot of ways, he's one of the heart-and-soul guys that I think create the identity that we're trying to create with the group, and so he's such an important player for us on so many different levels. So, was I concerned throughout the course of the year? Of course,"" U.S. coach Mike Sullivan said.With Tkachuk's peak form, dedication, and self-confidence, Team USA is hoping for its first Olympic men’s hockey gold medal in decades, since its first Olympic men's hockey gold medal in 1980, and the first best-on-best title since the 1996 World Cup.","Matthew Tkachuk, a star forward for the Florida Panthers, feels he's in peak form for his Olympic debut with Team USA against Latvia.

T20 World Cup | Sahibzada Farhan on India vs Pakistan matches: 'Not one-sided'

CHENNAI: If the online troll army is getting worried about Pakistan’s mystery slinger spinner Usman Tariq ahead of India’s blockbuster clash against the neighbours, they have MS Dhoni to blame.Apparently, Tariq, once a sales-man working in the UAE, changed the course of his life when he decided to escape the humdrum and chase his dream when he watched ‘MS Dhoni, The Untold Story’.Inspired by the Indian legend’s moment of truth in the film, when he left his job in Kharagpur as ticket-collector to become a full-time cricketer, Tariq quit his Dubai job and returned to Paki-stan. He worked on his game, got his opportunities in franchise leagues across the world, and in captain Salman Ali Agha’s words, is now “Pakistan’s X-factor”.It’s Tariq’s stop-start run-up and the slinging delivery action that have caused irritation among teams, IPL’s new millionaire Cameron Green adding fuel to the fire after being unable to deal with Tariq in the recently-con-cluded ODI series.Suddenly, Tariq’s action has become the talking point and after the USA struggled against him on Tuesday, the decibels seem to have risen a bit. Tariq took 3-27, taking the steam out of the USA chase, and was the fulcrum of the spin quintet, which includes part-timer Saim Ayub too.It’s the traditionally slow Pre-madasa track, where Pakistan play India next, that’s leading to the cause for worry. Tariq, who stops before delivering, is very slow through the air and it sometimes seems that the ball wouldn’t reach the bat. The batter has to create all the momentum to hit him.While his slowness is par for the course because of the quirkiness of the action, the difficulty for the batter arises when one ball suddenly comes a little faster and turns. There are voices in the cricket world which insist that Tariq chucks that delivery and that he shouldn’t be allowed to play.But the mystery spinner has found an ally from an unusual quarter in the form of the master of the craft of off-spin, R Ashwin, who posted his support on X.Eminent batting coach and former India player WV Raman, too, believes Tariq isn’t chucking, but India shouldn’t find it difficult to play him. “With a round-arm ac-tion it is very difficult to chuck … It is the quirkiness of Tariq’s ac-tion that is creating the problem. Batters are used to a rhythm where everything keeps happening in one go. When suddenly there is a pause, you start thinking about what’s go-ing on,” Raman told TOI.“But Indian batters are good enough to deal with this. Kedar Jadhav and Riyan Parag bowl like that from time to time, so it’s not that they are not used to it,” he said. Over the next few days, the chat-ter will continue. The Indian play-ers are superb players of spin bowl-ing, somebody like Shivam Dube being a designated spin-hitter. Pakistan will have a few more spin-ners in their XI in the form of Mo-hammed Nawaz, Abrar Ahmed and Shadab Khan and India will need all their skill to deal with the threat, led by Tariq.","Usman Tariq's stop-start run-up and the slinging delivery action have caused irritation among teams.

Counter-terrorism police are leading the investigation into an “American-style” stabbing of two boys, aged 12 and 13, at Kingsbury High School in northwest London.Police were called at 12.40 pm local time on Tuesday to reports of a stabbing at the comprehensive secondary school in Kingsbury. Armed police were on the scene within 13 minutes of the call.“The suspect left the scene following the stabbing. After urgent enquiries our officers arrested him and also recovered a weapon which we believe to have been used in the stabbing. We are not currently looking for anyone else,” Detective Chief Superintendent Luke Williams said.A 13-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. He remains in custody where he is being questioned.Kingsbury is a multicultural area with a significant Indian ethnic population.According to local media, the arrested boy, a former pupil who had been expelled from the school for fighting, had climbed over the wall to enter the school and allegedly shouted “Allahu Akbar” as he stabbed two kids in a science lesson.He had come to target one of the boys “in revenge” and the other boy got stabbed because he set off the fire alarm. One boy was reportedly stabbed in the neck and the other in the stomach. Local media report the suspect had dressed in his old school uniform and sprayed the children and science teacher with pepper spray as he entered the classroom. Both injured boys remain in serious but stable condition in hospital. Their injuries are not life-threatening, police said. It has not been declared a terrorist incident.“At this very early stage, we are keeping an open mind as to any motivation behind this attack,” Williams added.The school went into lockdown and pupils were held in the playground. The attack has left parents and pupils petrified with some parents calling for metal detectors at the entrance.The academy school is for pupils aged 11 to 18. Its alumni include Wham’s George Michael and jazz musician Courtney Pine.","Two boys, aged 12 and 13, stabbed at Kingsbury High School in northwest London.

ICC Associate Member Director Mubashshir Usmani credits Jay Shah's leadership and CEO Sanjog Gupta's coordination for averting a major setback.

How PCB, ICC, BCB reached a resolution on India vs Pakistan T20 World Cup match

Q. What happened exactly in the resolution of the India vs Pakistan T20 World Cup deadlock?

Mubashshir Usmani:

Q. How important is an India vs Pakistan match for cricket’s eco-system?

Usmani:

Q.

How important was this game for the Associate countries?

Usmani:

Q. What is future of ICC with regards to Olympics etc?

Usmani:

The build-up to the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka was dominated not by on-field rivalries, but by a tense administrative standoff that threatened to derail the tournament’s biggest fixture — India vs Pakistan. For weeks, uncertainty loomed over whether cricket’s most commercially powerful contest would take place.In this TimesofIndia.com exclusive, ICC Associate Member Director Mubashshir Usmani offers a rare behind-the-scenes account of how the deadlock was broken and why the stakes extended far beyond a single match.He credits the leadership of Jay Shah and the coordination efforts of ICC CEO Sanjog Gupta in navigating complex negotiations involving multiple boards.It was definitely not an easy task. However, full credit must go to all stakeholders for remaining flexible and working towards a resolution. I must thank ICC Chair Mr. Jay Shah whose visionary leadership ensured that cricket world avoided a major setback. Behind the scenes, ICC CEO Sanjog Gupta worked closely with PCB (Pakistan Cricket Board) and BCB (Bangladesh Cricket Board) and I must say that Sanjog has been instrumental in stitching this resolution.Everyone knows the importance of an India vs Pakistan match especially in an ICC event. It is not only about the revenues it is also about fans and the overall profile of an event since the game is the biggest sporting spectacle in the world which keeps billions around the world on the edge of their seats. So, cricket would have been the ultimate loser had the India vs Pakistan match not taken place.Associate Members rely heavily on ICC funding which is generated through ICC events. For some Associates, ICC funding is nothing short of a lifeline. So, it was extremely important that the India vs Pakistan game took place or else a reduction in ICC revenues would have meant reduced funding for Associates and that would have been catastrophic for the sustenance and growth of the game.Again, I must appreciate and recognise the visionary leadership of Mr. Jay Shah who has been working day and night to take ICC to newer territories. Cricket in Olympics under his Chairmanship demonstrates the forward thinking of ICC. I see a very bright future for ICC under Mr. Jay Shah and wish him all the best in taking ICC to newer heights. I assure full cooperation of all Associate Members in the implementation of his vision.","A tense administrative standoff threatened the India vs Pakistan T20 World Cup fixture, but a resolution was brokered.

Former Jets’ Darron Lee charged with murder in girlfriend’s death as prosecutors seek death penalty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/former-jets-darron-lee-charged-with-murder-in-girlfriends-death-as-prosecutors-seek-death-penalty/articleshow/128223763.cms,"Image - x

Former Jets draft pick Darron Lee at center of murder case tied to girlfriend’s death





Lee is charged, not convicted.







His court case is ongoing, with future hearings to determine how the trial will proceed.







Additional details may become public as the investigation and prosecution continue.







Former NFL linebacker Darron Lee, who was a first-round draft pick by the New York Jets, is now at the center of a serious criminal case in Tennessee. Prosecutors have filed charges of first-degree murder and tampering with evidence against him in connection with the death of his girlfriend, and they are seeking the death penalty as the case moves forward.On February 5, police and first responders were called to a home in Ooltewah, Tennessee, after a report of someone needing CPR. Officials found a woman inside the home who later died. Investigators determined her death was a homicide and identified Lee as a suspect.Lee was arrested at the scene and charged with first-degree murder and tampering with evidence. He is currently being held without bond and was scheduled for a court hearing on February 11.According to affidavits and police reports, investigators saw signs of trauma and blood inside the residence, and forensic evidence suggested attempts to clean parts of the home. Lee reportedly told deputies he found the woman injured and thought she had fallen, but detectives say the scene did not match that account.Authorities have not released the victim’s identity pending family notification.In this case, prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Lee, which is one of the most serious legal steps possible in a criminal prosecution.That means if Lee is convicted of first-degree murder, the state could pursue a capital punishment sentence.Seeking the death penalty does not mean it is guaranteed, it must be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, and there would be a separate sentencing phase if Lee is found guilty. This is part of Tennessee’s legal process for the most serious offenses.At the time of writing, the legal process is still in its early stages:Cases like this are sensitive and evolving, so updates from official court filings and statements from law enforcement will shape how the story moves forward.Darron Lee is a 31-year-old former professional football player. He was drafted 20th overall by the New York Jets in the 2016 NFL Draft after a standout college career at Ohio State University. Lee went on to play in the NFL for teams including the Jets, Kansas City Chiefs, and Buffalo Bills before his career ended in 2020.His name is familiar to many sports fans because he was a highly-rated linebacker coming out of college and spent five seasons in the NFL. But he is now in the news for a serious criminal case, not his athletic career.","Former NFL linebacker Darron Lee is charged with first-degree murder and tampering with evidence in the death of his girlfriend.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have kept their wedding plans under wraps but the Kansas City Chiefs’ star player’s ex girlfriend, Kayla Nicole, continues to take digs at the high profile couple.Though Travis Kelce and Kayla Nicole broke up a year before he met Taylor Swift, the popular social media influencer continues to be trolled because of her controversial comments.A few months ago, in September 2025, Kayla Nicole opened up about finances in a relationship on her podcast, The Pre Game With Kayla Nicole.As Kayla Nicole discussed Heather Sanders saying the “greatest thing a man can give a woman is getting married”, she said, ""I respectfully disagree….”The popular social media influencer added, “The most player sh*t you could do is put an M in her bank account…”Kayla Nicole continued, “Give her a kid.

Abhishek Sharma in hospital - latest on his recovery and India nets

Afghanistan head coach Jonathan Trott described his side’s defeat to South Africa as “devastating”, admitting the narrow loss in a dramatic T20 World Cup contest would linger with his players. The Proteas edged Afghanistan after a gripping encounter that required two Super Overs, leaving South Africa relieved and Afghanistan heartbroken in one of the most remarkable matches since the tournament began in 2007.Addressing the media after the game on Wednesday, Trott reflected on the emotional toll of back-to-back defeats in a demanding group.""Just shows what we have as a side. So we've got some amazing players and it's just really devastating for the guys after a tough loss a few days ago against New Zealand and now against South Africa in a tough group as well,"" Trott said.The South African-born former England Test batter acknowledged that such losses can hurt deeply.""These guys are never shy of rising up against the challenges that they face throughout their lives on and off the field.""So today they should be very proud and obviously these types of losses sometimes they can hurt and sting for a while but I think it's important we look at those areas that we did really well in, but also areas that we could improve and things we could have done better.""I think South Africa fielded pretty well actually as well. The run out, a few catches on the boundary, on the ring, those sorts of things. I think they fielded really well. Maybe that was the difference today a little bit,"" the Afghanistan head coach said.Under Trott’s guidance, Afghanistan have made significant strides, reaching the semifinals in the previous edition of the T20 World Cup and the quarterfinals of the 2023 ODI World Cup. Though he is set to step down after this tournament, Trott declined to reflect on his tenure, insisting his focus remains on the remaining fixtures.Trott also reserved special praise for Rahmanullah Gurbaz , who smashed 84 off 42 balls in the chase of 187 and followed it with a blistering 18 off 4 balls in the second Super Over.""Those innings as we saw today, I think he should play more often if I'm honest, with the amount of talent that he has and the physique and the sporting ability and natural hand-eye coordination.""He wears his heart on his sleeve and he's quite an animated character. I think the years that I've been with him now, I'm just trying to get him to be a little bit more consistent in everything that he does.""","Afghanistan coach Jonathan Trott describes his side's defeat to South Africa as ""devastating"" Trott admits the narrow loss would linger with his players.

"4 men meet in Tihar jail, walk out and gang up for burglaries; held after theft spree in Ghaziabad",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/4-men-meet-in-tihar-jail-walk-out-and-gang-up-for-burglaries-held-in-ghaziabad/articleshow/128182697.cms,"4 meet in Tihar, walk out & gang up for burglaries





GHAZIABAD: Four men, recently released from Tihar jail, were arrested for a series of burglaries targeting homes and jewellery shops in the city.According to police, the suspects regrouped after they recently walked out of Tihar, where some had been lodged in connection with theft cases. Investigators said the gang carried out multiple burglaries between Feb 1 and 5, striking residential properties and attempting to break into jewellery showrooms.A senior police officer said the first incident was reported on the night of Feb 1, when a group broke into a bungalow in Raj Nagar while the owners were away. The burglars made off with a small locker containing documents and a passport. The homeowner, Ashwani Chaudhary, found the theft on returning the following day and lodged a complaint at Kavi Nagar police station.On Feb 5, police received another complaint after seven men attempted to break into two jewellery showrooms on Ambedkar Road. Officers said the group broke the lock of one showroom around 3am and was trying to cut chain locks on the rear door of an adjacent store when neighbours noticed the activity and alerted police. The suspects fled before stealing anything, but a robbery case was registered. Later the same night, police got information about a burglary at a locked flat in SPS Apartment Society in Sahibabad.The suspects allegedly stole gold, silver and cash before escaping in a white Ertiga.ADCP Piyush Kumar Singh said CCTV footage from multiple locations, along with eyewitness accounts describing seven men, helped investigators establish that the same gang was behind the series of thefts.On Tuesday, a crime branch team arrested four suspects near an underpass close to Sahibabad railway station. They were identified as Roshan Yadav (26), Nimish Aggarwal (34), Raghu Kumar (42), and Aman Saxena (28). During questioning, Aggarwal allegedly told police that he had previously worked as a sales manager at one of the jewellery stores targeted in the break-in, but was later dismissed. He then took up a job at a jewellery showroom in Delhi, from where he allegedly stole ornaments and was jailed. While serving his sentence in Tihar, he came into contact with Raghu Kumar and other associates, police officials said. After he was recently released on bail, he allegedly failed to find work. He regrouped with his fellow inmates and planned the burglaries, police added. Some gold jewellery has been recovered from the accused, and efforts are under way to trace and arrest other gang members.","Four men arrested for a series of burglaries targeting homes and jewellery shops in the city.

In a bizarre case, police in Pakistan’s Rawalpindi district registered a case on Sunday of abduction against a “jinn” (supernatural spirit) following the disappearance of an 11-year-old boy, news agency ANI reported, citing ARY News.The incident occurred in the garrison city when the boy went missing from his home on January 21. After ten days without any sign of the child, his father approached the Taxila Police Station and filed a First Information Report (FIR).In the FIR, the father alleged that supernatural entities, known locally as jinns, had forced his son to run away.The complainant said that this is not the first time such an incident has occurred. He added that the jinns had “abducted” his son several times before.He highlighted that while the boy had returned home after previous incidents, this time ten days had passed without his return, prompting him to formally accuse the supernatural spirits of kidnapping.According to ARY News, similar claims have been reported in Pakistan’s legal system before. In Lahore, a mother had lodged a case against jinns over the disappearance of her married daughter, a matter that eventually reached the courts.A report by Dawn in September stated that a special investigation team of Lahore police was formed under the directions of the city's high court Chief Justice Aalia Neelam to probe the six-year-old case of the missing woman, believed to have been abducted by a jinn.The team, headed by Lahore Investigation DIG Zeeshan Raza, was tasked with locating and recovering the woman.","11-year-old boy went missing from his home in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, on January 21.

Two French adventurers have completed an epic journey on foot from France to Shanghai, arriving on Saturday after nearly a year and a half and crossing 16 countries almost entirely on foot.Loic Voisot and Benjamin Humblot celebrated their arrival on the Bund promenade, with Shanghai’s skyline in the background.The pair began their journey from Annecy in September 2024.""We were thinking about this moment almost every day for more than a year now, so it's a really strong feeling,"" Humblot was quoted as saying by AFP after reaching the destination.""I think first and foremost we're proud, especially of having dared to do this... We weren't sure we'd make it, but we told ourselves we'd try it out,"" he added.The pair have known each other since the age of 10 and attended secondary school and university together.They said the idea for the journey emerged during a casual conversation after work, when they realised they both wanted a “great adventure.” They decided to travel to China without flying, citing environmental concerns, and planned to make the journey on foot.""When we talked about adventure, (China) came up quickly. Then we had this slightly crazy idea of going on foot,"" Humblot said.Apart from a short stretch in Russia completed by bus for safety reasons, they walked for 518 days, covering around 12,850 kilometres (7,980 miles) before reaching Shanghai.""We're both conscious of climate change, and the responsibility humans bear for it... there are some actions we can take individually,"" Voisot, a climate consultant said, as cited by AFP.Around 50 people gathered at the starting point for the final 10-kilometre stretch, including local residents who had followed their journey on social media. Their following grew along the route, with media, French residents in Shanghai and others joining them along the way.The French duo said they faced significant challenges during the journey, including harsh winters and a desert crossing in Uzbekistan. “There were very hard winters, we had to cross the desert in Uzbekistan,” Voisot said, adding that he was proud of “having had the willpower to always keep going.”Humblot said they generally ate well during the trip but noted that they both missed French cheese.Asked what he would do first after completing the journey, Voisot replied that he would, “sleep a lot!”","Loic Voisot and Benjamin Humblot began their journey from Annecy in September 2024.

HBO unveils first look of Dominic McLaughlin as Harry Potter in reboot





Draco Malfoy, the scheming schoolboy who served as Harry Potter's rival in J K Rowling's fantasy series has emerged as an unlikely mascot for China's Lunar New Year celebrations, according to Reuters.Images of Malfoy played by actor Tom Felton in the film adaptations, have begun appearing on red festive decorations and merchandise across China, from posters and door hangings to phone covers.The surge in popularity is linked to the Chinese translation of his surname, Ma-er-fu, which combines the characters for ""horse"" and ""fortune,"" making it an auspicious fit for the Year of the Horse.Social media platforms have been flooded with photos of fans pasting red Malfoy posters on their doors.On e-commerce platform Taobao, shoppers can buy a set of four Malfoy posters for 11 yuan ($1.60), Reuters reported.Social media posts showed a massive image of Malfoy in his Hogwarts uniform draped across several floors of a shopping mall in central China’s Henan province.The Harry Potter franchise continues to enjoy strong popularity in China, despite foreign films accounting for only a small share of box office revenues due to strict quotas and a growing focus on domestic productions.Warner Bros has agreed to develop a Harry Potter Studio Tour in Shanghai in partnership with Chinese conglomerate Jinjiang International, the group announced last year.Meanwhile, Beijing’s Universal Studios theme park features The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, a dedicated area with themed rides and attractions. Adding to the renewed interest, all eight Harry Potter films were re-released in Chinese cinemas in 2024.","Draco Malfoy, the scheming schoolboy who served as Harry Potter's rival, has emerged as an unlikely mascot for China's Lunar New Year celebrations.Images of Malfoy played by actor Tom Felton in the film adaptations, have begun appearing on red festive decorations and merchandise across China.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127916193,imgsize-45686,width-400,resizemode-4/127916193.jpg"

What really happened: A costly mistake by the Indian family in Dubai



From garbage to gold: How Dubai’s system worked



Dubai Waste Worker Returns Lost Gold Worth AED 50,000 to Indian Family in 3 Days

What it says about Dubai’s urban systems

Accidental Gold Dump in Dubai Turns Into Heart-Warming Recovery Story





An unusual yet uplifting incident out of Dubai has captured global attention this February 2026 as an Indian family lost gold worth AED 50,000 (about ₹12–13 lakh) by mistake, when it was tossed out with household garbage, only for it to be tracked down and returned to them within just three days. The story has resonated far beyond the Gulf, trending across social media as an extraordinary example of civic efficiency, honesty and urban systems that deliver unexpectedly positive outcomes.According to multiple reports, the incident began when Kamini Kannan, an Indian who had previously lived in Dubai for 23 years, was visiting the city for a family wedding. During her stay, she temporarily transferred a collection of gold, four 22-carat coins and a 50-gram 24-carat gold bar, from an old pouch to a temporary one that was later left on a dining table.Later that day, while the family was cleaning up, Kamini’s son Abhimanyu mistakenly assumed the pouch was trash and disposed of it with the household rubbish. By the next morning, the family realised the valuables were missing and a moment of panic seized them, given the gold’s high value and sentimental importance.Despite initial fears that the gold was irretrievably lost, the unexpected turnaround began when a waste-collection worker found the pouch while sorting rubbish.Instead of keeping it, he handed it over to authorities, a small act that set in motion a rapid recovery effort.Dubai Police, known for their efficient record systems and community cooperation, quickly traced the gold back to the family through building waste collection data and followed up with a call to Abhimanyu within three days. When the son arrived at the building reception, officers confirmed that the missing items had been found and would be returned.This seamless recovery, from garbage to reunion with owners, highlights both the city’s sophisticated waste tracking and police follow-up systems as well as the integrity shown by the worker who could easily have chosen to keep the find. Beyond the obvious human drama of years of savings nearly gone in minutes, the incident has drawn attention as a feel-good tale about civic trust and effective public service.Many social media users observed that such recoveries are not only about modern administrative systems but also reflect community values and ethical responsibility in everyday life. The story quickly went viral, spawning widespread coverage that underscored Dubai’s reputation for order and safety.Dubai’s efficient police and administrative coordination, often praised in other contexts for handling complex cases, proved capable of solving even this highly unlikely scenario in record time.This episode offers lessons in urban planning, data use and civic cooperation. Dubai’s municipal systems are structured to correlate waste output with addresses and buildings, a capability that helped link the lost gold to its source. Rather than dismissing an “impossible” loss, Dubai Police followed procedural leads and contacted the family directly, demonstrating responsiveness even in unusual cases.The garbage worker’s decision to hand in valuable gold illustrates the role of individual ethics in amplifying the effectiveness of city systems. As Dubai continues to position itself as a global hub for safety, innovation and quality of life, stories like this, blending modern administrative tools with human values, help shape international perceptions of the city’s societal fabric.For the Kannan family, the experience was both a shock and a blessing. Reports quoted them expressing amazement that such a costly mistake did not result in irrevocable loss, with many observers describing the outcome as “miraculous” or at least a testament to how well systems can work when individuals act with integrity. Online audiences around the world reacted with admiration for the worker who turned the find in and the police who made the connection, noting that in many places such a scenario ends in permanent loss or legal disputes.The incident has become something of a viral emblem of hope and proof that sometimes small acts of honesty and robust governance infrastructure can combine to achieve remarkable results. What started as a small household mistake nearly turning into a major financial loss instead became a widely-shared story of recovery, system efficiency and community integrity.The Indian family’s gold, almost forever gone, was traced and returned in just three days thanks to an upright waste worker and proactive policing in Dubai, illustrating how modern cities can harness technology and human values to protect residents even in the most unexpected circumstances.","An Indian family lost gold worth AED 50,000 when it was tossed out with household garbage.

‘I was really scared’: 13-year-old swims miles to save mom and siblings swept out to Sea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/didnt-think-i-was-a-hero-13-year-old-swims-miles-to-save-mom-and-siblings-swept-out-to-sea/articleshow/128225087.cms,"



A 13-year-old Australian boy who swam for hours to raise the alarm after his family was swept kilometres out to sea has downplayed his extraordinary act of courage.“I didn’t think I was a hero – I just did what I did” the boy told the BBC. Austin Appelbee was kayaking and paddleboarding with his mother Joanne, 47, brother Beau, 12, and sister Grace, 8, off Quindalup beach in Geographe Bay, Western Australia, on January 30 when strong winds pushed them far from shore. What began as a relaxed family outing quickly turned into a terrifying 10-hour ordeal.“The wind picked up and it went from there,” Joanne told the BBC. “We lost oars, and we drifted out further… It kind of all went wrong very, very quickly.”Realising they were being carried farther out to sea and unable to paddle back, Joanne made what she later described as one of the hardest decisions of her life, sending her eldest son back to shore for help. “Early on, we sent this young man back in to try and get help because it didn’t look like we were that far from the shoreline,” she said.Austin set off in the family’s kayak, unaware it had been badly damaged and was already taking on water.“It started flipping, and then I lost an oar and I knew I was in trouble,” he told the BBC.After struggling to keep the kayak afloat, he eventually abandoned it and began swimming.Battling fading light, rising waves and exhaustion, Austin swam roughly 4km (about two nautical miles), at one point discarding his lifejacket because it was hindering his movement.“It was getting dangerous now – I had been out for a couple of hours,” he recalled. He later admitted he was “really scared” but said thinking about his family, friends and even singing Christian songs in his head kept him going.When he finally reached land around 6 pm local time, a disoriented Austin made his way along the beach to find a phone and dial Australia’s emergency number, triple-zero.In the call, later released by Western Australia Police with his mother’s permission, he told the dispatcher: “We got swept out to sea, and we got lost out there… I’m really scared.”He added: “I haven’t seen them since. I think they’re kilometres out in sea, I think we need helicopters to go find them.” Fearing hypothermia and dizziness, he also requested an ambulance.Shortly after making the call, Austin collapsed and was taken to hospital. He still did not know if his family had survived.Meanwhile, Joanne and the two younger children had drifted nearly 14km (8.5 miles) offshore, clinging to two paddleboards. “I had assumed Austin hadn’t made it,” Joanne told the BBC. “As the day progressed, no vessels and nothing coming to save us.”A large multi-agency search was launched, and by 8:30 pm — nearly 10 hours after the family first entered the water — rescuers located Joanne, Beau and Grace. All three were wearing life jackets and were later treated at a local hospital before being released without serious injuries.Austin said the moment he learned they had been found was unforgettable. “It was a moment I will never forget,” he told the BBC, describing how doctors and police officers around him erupted in joy.Western Australia Police praised the teenager’s composure during the emergency call. Acting Sergeant Andrew McDonnell, who coordinated the rescue effort, said in a statement:“What Austin did was nothing short of extraordinary. His bravery and courage in those conditions were remarkable, and his actions were pivotal in bringing about a successful outcome.”While releasing emergency calls is not standard practice, police said they shared the recording with permission from Austin’s mother to educate the public about responding calmly in life-threatening situations.Despite being hailed as “superhuman” by rescuers, Austin insists he was simply doing what needed to be done — a sentiment that has only amplified admiration for the courageous teen across Australia.","Austin Appelbee was kayaking and paddleboarding with his mother Joanne, 47, brother Beau, 12, and sister Grace, 8, off Quindalup beach in Geographe Bay, Western Australia, on January 30.

How Kaindy Lake became home to a frozen forest under water



Nature preserved in ice at Kaindy Lake







The story of nature tucked away in Kazakhstan’s Tian Shan Mountains, Kaindy Lake, seems like something out of a dream. Tree trunks poke eerily out of the water, ghostly and silent. It’s strange. Almost unreal. Locals and travellers alike are drawn to it, though, curious to see a forest frozen in time. Over a century ago, an earthquake changed the landscape, creating the lake and preserving the trees beneath its cold, clear surface. Experts say the water never warms above six degrees, which keeps the spruce trees surprisingly intact. It seems like nature hit pause, leaving something both haunting and beautiful.As reported by IFLScience , the story goes back to 1911, when a massive earthquake of magnitude 8 reportedly shook the Tian Shan region. Landslides followed. Huge chunks of rock blocked a gorge. A natural dam was born. Slowly, the valley filled with rainwater and melting glaciers. The water submerged a forest. Spruce trees, some hundreds of years old, ended up underwater.The lake grew gradually. The twisted shapes of trees above the surface, and below, the forest remains almost intact.Experts say the cold water preserved the branches and needles. It seems impossible, but it’s real. The earthquake didn’t just shake the ground, which created a tiny underwater time capsule.The trunks look like skeletons. They rise out of the water like fingers reaching for the sky. Some call them “misplaced toothpicks.” Walking around the lake, it feels surreal. You expect the trees to crumble, but they don’t. They stand, frozen. Visitors reportedly go in for a swim, though the water is icy. It’s eerie. But beautiful. You can’t help staring. The green-blue water shimmers. Limestone carried by the landslide scatters sunlight, giving the lake a strange glow. It’s almost magical.Diving or peering underwater, the forest continues. Tree trunks stretch down into the icy depths below. The water is crystal-clear. It seems to trap the forest in time. Tiny fish swim around, unnoticed, while the branches remain stiff and brittle. Tourists often gasp when they see it for the first time. There’s something almost unreal about it. A century-old forest, untouched in its watery grave beneath the silent surface. It makes you wonder how fragile and enduring nature can be at once.Despite being near a city of over a million, the lake feels isolated. Quiet. Almost untouched by modern noise and development. Trails wind around the edges. Locals sometimes guide visitors, sharing stories of the 1911 quake and its sudden, violent aftermath.","Kaindy Lake in Kazakhstan's Tian Shan Mountains is home to a frozen forest preserved in ice.

"What really destroyed the Indus Valley? It wasn’t war, but a slow death by drought",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/what-really-destroyed-the-indus-valley-it-wasnt-war-but-a-slow-death-by-drought/articleshow/128191152.cms,"Source: Nature

How the Indus Valley built smart cities by the river



How long have droughts slowly broken the Indus Valley



Stone and mud tell the story of the droughts







The Indus Valley Civilisation probably didn’t disappear all at once. New research points to a long stretch of repeated droughts that may have slowly weakened one of the world’s earliest urban societies. Cities such as Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa, once built around reliable rivers, appear to have struggled as water became harder to find. As conditions worsened, people began to move away, settlements declined, and everyday life grew uncertain. It’s striking to realise how deeply something as ordinary as rainfall could shape the fate of an entire civilisation. Researchers believe the damage unfolded over many decades, with early changes so gradual they may have gone almost unnoticed at first.As cited in ScienceDaily study, titled, 'Scientists finally uncovered why the Indus Valley Civilization collapsed', the Indus Valley, also known as the Harappan civilisation, was highly advanced for its time. Cities weren’t just heaps of bricks; they had organised streets, complex drainage, and water-management systems. Experts say the society had trade links as far as Mesopotamia. They even developed a script, though we can’t read it today.But life was never entirely smooth. Even with all that clever engineering, the civilisation still depended heavily on the Indus River. When the river’s flow changed, the whole system started to wobble. Experts note that climate shifts, particularly rainfall patterns, might have slowly made the area harder to live in.Scientists studying this used computer climate simulations spanning thousands of years. These simulations reportedly show rainfall steadily declining between 5,000 and 3,000 years ago, suggesting a prolonged shift in regional climate patterns that reshaped entire ecosystems. Some droughts apparently lasted more than 85 years at a stretch. That’s a long time without reliable water.It seems that as the droughts dragged on, people moved closer to remaining water sources, abandoning farmlands and trade routes that once sustained thriving urban centres. Eventually, though, even those areas couldn’t sustain large populations. Cities began to empty. A particularly long drought around 3,500 years ago reportedly coincides with widespread abandonment of major sites. Archaeologists see this as the moment the civilisation really started to unravel.To check the models, researchers looked at stalagmites and stalactites in regional caves. When growth slows, it usually means less rainfall. They also checked lake sediments. Both seem to match the simulations pretty well. It’s like the environment was leaving a diary, in stone and mud, of exactly what was happening.Nick Scroxton, a climate scientist, reportedly said this work helps explain how changing rainfall influenced urban settlement and agriculture. Liviu Giosan, a geoscientist, called the study “a significant step” in understanding hydroclimate in ancient civilisations. Seems like the scientists were pleased with their cross-checking.","The Indus Valley, also known as the Harappan civilisation, was highly advanced for its time.

Mapping took longer than expected

Stone walls hint at older shorelines

Oxygen fades quickly below the surface layers





Blue holes are among the least understood features of the ocean floor. From the surface, they can appear ordinary, even calm, blending into the surrounding reef or open water. Below, however, they drop steeply and change quickly. The Sansha Yongle Blue Hole, also known as the Dragon Hole, sits in the South China Sea and has drawn scientific attention for more than a decade. Once confirmed as the deepest known blue hole at just over 301 metres, it has since lost that record to a deeper site in Mexico. Even so, its structure, chemistry and isolation continue to make it one of the most closely studied blue holes in the world. Researchers see it less as a record holder and more as a natural archive shaped by time, water and climate.One of the most striking findings is that the Dragon Hole is not a simple vertical shaft. Detailed surveys show that it bends and tilts as it goes down. The deepest point lies more than 100 metres sideways from the surface entrance. Near the top, the opening is wide. Deeper down, the space narrows sharply, then opens again in places. The uneven form reflects a long and complex history rather than a single collapse.Early attempts to measure the hole were limited by its shape.Turning walls and steep angles confused positioning systems. In 2017, scientists used a high grade underwater robot equipped with precise navigation tools. This made it possible to map the interior in three dimensions and confirm the depth accurately. Multiple instruments were used and cross checked, resulting in a final depth of 301.19 metres with very small uncertainty.For years, the interior resisted clean measurement. Instruments lost their bearings as walls tilted and passages curved. In 2017, researchers returned with a more capable underwater robot, fitted with precise navigation tools. Progress was slow but steady. The result was the first full three dimensional map of the hole, along with a confirmed depth of 301.19 metres. Several instruments were used, checked against one another, then checked again.Inside the hole, the rock tells its own story. Ledges appear at certain depths. Some resemble steps. These features line up with ancient sea levels, formed when the ocean stood lower during colder periods. Fossilised shells and tiny coral fragments are embedded in the walls, hinting at life that once thrived here. The hole seems to have grown in stages, opening and reshaping as water levels rose and fell. Reef limestone dominates the walls, marked by side cavities that appear without warning. Sunlight filters in occasionally, highlighting textures and revealing the subtle colours of ancient deposits.One of the sharpest changes is not in shape, but in chemistry. Below roughly 90 to 100 metres, oxygen nearly disappears. Above this level, some life persists. Below it, conditions turn still and harsh. The water does not mix easily with the surrounding sea. Oxygen is used up and not replaced. In deeper layers, hydrogen sulphide becomes detectable, adding another barrier to life.This lack of circulation gives the Dragon Hole an unusual quality. Water layers remain largely undisturbed, holding chemical signals that reflect past ocean conditions. For scientists, this isolation is valuable. It offers a way to read changes that unfolded slowly, without constant mixing or disruption.","The Sansha Yongle Blue Hole, also known as the Dragon Hole, sits in the South China Sea and has drawn scientific attention for more than a decade.
