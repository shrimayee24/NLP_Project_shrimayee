NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli 's introduction to international cricket was characterized not only by his extraordinary talent but also by his fiery demeanor on the field. His fierce competitiveness, boldness, and refusal to back down from any confrontation—whether with opponents or spectators—quickly became defining traits.One of the most infamous incidents highlighting Virat's temperament occurred during India's 2012 tour of Australia, widely known as ""Virat's middle finger incident .""During the second Test in Sydney, while fielding near the boundary, Virat was repeatedly targeted by verbal abuse from a section of Australian fans.Aggravated by the continuous taunting, Virat responded by raising his middle finger toward the crowd.The gesture immediately caused controversy, drawing heavy criticism and substantial media attention.""I agree cricketers don't have to retaliate. What when the crowd says the worst things about your mother and sister. The worst I've heard,"" he had posted.The International Cricket Council (ICC) subsequently fined Virat 50% of his match fee for breaching the Code of Conduct, citing unsportsmanlike behavior.In an interview with Wisden, Virat opened up on the controversy and recalled how he pleaded with the match referee Ranjan Madugalle to not ban him.""Yeah, the one thing I remember most is when I'd had enough of the Australian crowd at Sydney and I just decided to flick a finger at them. 'I'm so cool'. The match referee called me to his room the next day and I'm like, ‘What's wrong?'. He said, ‘What happened at the boundary yesterday?'. I said, ‘Nothing, it was a bit of banter',"" Virat had said.""Then he threw the newspaper in front of me and there was this big image of me flicking on the front page and I said, ‘I'm so sorry, please don't ban me!',"" he added.Madugalle reportedly asked Kohli to admit to his guilt which he accepted and got away with 50 per cent deduction of his match fee. ""I got away with that one. He was a nice guy, he understood I was young and these things happen,"" Virat said.",Virat Kohli has opened up about his controversial middle finger incident.

He's so tough to beat so I'm excited to be in the final.""Despite an impressive run in the tournament, where he had only been broken three times and hadn't dropped a set in five rounds, Draper found himself under pressure from Sinner.The Italian top seed capitalized on Draper's sixth double fault to secure a break in the 11th game before closing out the set with a love game.""In the final, it will be a very tough challenge whoever I play,"" added Sinner of being guaranteed to face an American opponent.""I'm happy to be in that position because if you are in the final on a Sunday it means you are doing an amazing job.""The second set took a dramatic turn when Draper vomited courtside, and Sinner subsequently fell while chasing a shot, injuring his left wrist in the process.Although Sinner won the point, Draper managed to hold serve for a 5-4 lead. Both players received medical attention, with Sinner requiring a full timeout.However, the Italian quickly recovered and dominated the tiebreak, establishing a two-set advantage.As the match progressed into the third set, Draper's physical exhaustion became evident, and he was reduced to a walking pace.Sinner capitalized on his opponent's diminished state, swiftly closing out the set and the match, securing his place in the US Open final.","Jannik Sinner becomes first Italian man to reach US Open final.

'Jokers running Pakistan Cricket': Former cricketer slams PCB in hard-hitting rant,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/jokers-running-pakistan-cricket-former-cricketer-slams-pcb-in-hard-hitting-rant/articleshow/113140937.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Pakistan cricket team endured a humiliating Test series defeat against Bangladesh, sparking widespread criticism from both fans and experts. The team’s performance in both matches was below par, with the bowlers receiving particularly harsh criticism.As a result of these losses, Pakistan's prospects of qualifying for the World Test Championship ( WTC ) final have been significantly reduced.Former fast bowler Yasir Arafat voiced his frustration with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), stating that the team should prioritize preparation for red-ball matches. Despite this, the PCB has opted to organize the Champions Cup, a tournament featuring one-day matches.Pakistan are scheduled to host England for a three-match Test series, with the first Test set to begin on October 7 in Multan. The second Test will be held in Karachi from October 15 to 19, while the third and final Test is scheduled for Rawalpindi starting on October 24.Arafat highlighted the importance of proper preparation ahead of this pivotal series against England.""Your grey areas have been highlighted. Fitness issues, technique issues, and pitches. Today I heard Jason Gillespie and the high-performance coach are going back to Australia. You are conducting an ODI tournament. These decisions I don't understand. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is a circus,"" Arafat said on YouTube.""There are jokers in that, and this is a joke. You have a Test series against England coming up, and you are bringing players for ODIs. Shan Masood is saying in a press conference that our players have not played first-class cricket for 1.5 years. You have a big series against England coming up, and you are playing ODIs. This looks like a circus to me. The people who are working are jokers, and their decisions are jokes,"" he added.Reports suggest that the PCB is considering alternative venues, such as Sri Lanka or the United Arab Emirates (UAE), for hosting the Test series against England.Following the defeat to Bangladesh, Pakistan captain Shan Masood pointed to the lack of experience among domestic cricketers in red-ball cricket as a key factor behind the team's struggles in Test cricket.Masood stressed that the limited exposure of domestic players to red-ball cricket had negatively impacted the team's performance.""Bangladesh have two players who have played 70-90 Tests (Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahman), and Litton [Das] and Mehidy [Hasan Miraz] have played close to 40. We need the same level of red-ball exposure. Test cricket is the ultimate format of the game. You need experience. We need more Test and red-ball cricket,"" Masood said.""Whatever format you play is the format for which you'll produce players. You can't play more T20 cricket and get Test players. You can't prepare for science and then sit for a maths exam. If you're being tested for maths, you study maths. To play red-ball cricket, you must play red-ball cricket,"" the Pakistan captain added.",Pakistan cricket team endured a humiliating Test series defeat against Bangladesh.

'Rarest no-ball!' Wicket-keeper's error results in an unusual cricket incident,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/rarest-no-ball-wicket-keepers-error-results-in-an-unusual-cricket-incident-watch/articleshow/113115948.cms,"NEW DELHI: In cricket, a no-ball is an illegal delivery by the bowler, giving the batsman a free hit in the limited-overs matches. Common reasons for a no-ball include the bowler overstepping the popping crease, delivering the ball above waist height in the batsman's normal stance, or an overextended bowling arm.No-balls can also be called due to illegal bowling actions or dangerous deliveries.Umpires enforce this rule to ensure fair play and safety. The batting side is awarded one run, and the next ball is a free hit, during which the batsman can't be dismissed in most ways.However, during the 2024 Vitality T20 Blast match between Somerset and Northamptonshire, fans witnessed a rare no-ball decision. While reviewing a stumping appeal, the third umpire discovered that the wicketkeeper's gloves were ahead of the stumps at the time of delivery, which, according to ICC rules, rendered the delivery illegal.This no-ball gave the batsman a free hit, and he capitalized by smashing a huge six.Somerset, led by Lewis Gregory, were put in to bat by Northamptonshire captain David Willey and posted a formidable 215/3 in their 20 overs. Tom Banton (75 off 43 balls) and Tom Kohler-Cadmore (63 off 43 balls) both scored half-centuries for Somerset.In response, Northamptonshire managed 198/5 in 20 overs, giving Somerset a 17-run victory in Northampton.

Rahul Dravid had evolved into ""The Wall,"" and Sachin Tendulkar 's batting had become more measured than it had ever been. VVS Laxman had arrived with his '281', Ganguly was flaying more but driving less through the offside, and Virender Sehwag had demonstrated his explosive opening skills.For all the years they have played together, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly scored hundreds in the same Test only once.Against England in 2002, India went down in the first Test at Lord's but the Dravid-Tendulkar-Ganguly combine saved them inNottingham .In fact, the second Test at Nottingham could have seen Dravid, Tendulkar and Ganguly scoring centuries in India second innings but after Dravid's 115, Tendulkar and Ganguly fell for 92 and 99 respectively.But what didn't happen at Nottingham, occurred in the third Test at Headingley , Leeds.India batted after winning the toss under overcast skies.

He provided an opportunity, a long run. If you look at it, Jaddu (Ravindra Jadeja) or Suresh Raina, he groomed Jaddu in the finisher's role very well and played him in the same role till the end.

BENGALURU: For eight hours and four minutes across a little over three sessions, Musheer Khan (181; 373b, 16x4; 5x6) blended potential with application and game awareness, rendering a knock that was game changing for India B against India A .Only in his third domestic season, the teenager displayed an array of strokes, complementing sweetly-timed drives with attractive cut shots.While the opening day of the fixture was all about Mumbaikar Musheer, Day Two also saw seasoned pacer Navdeep Saini (56 & 2/36) sharing the spotlight with his all-round performance at the M Chinnaswamy stadium on Friday. After eventually bowling out India B for 321, India A closed the day on a comfortable 134/2 in 35 overs.While openers Mayank Agarwal (36) and Shubman Gill (25) failed to convert starts, Riyan Parag (batting on 27) and KL Rahul (batting on 23) will look to wipe out the 187-run deficit on Day 3.Rahul, returning to red-ball cricket after eight months, appeared rusty and was offered a lifeline by Nitish Kumar Reddy, who put him down at second slip off Mukesh when he was on three. For much of his 80-ball stay thereafter, it was all about block, pad and leave.The new-ball pair of Mukesh Kumar and Yash Dayal tested the India A top order with good length deliveries but weren't incisive enough under helpful overcast conditions.Saini accounted for the openers, sending Gill back with a delivery that swung in. Gill read the line wrong, leaving the ball only for it to crash into his off stump. Agarwal, on the other hand, offered a faint edge to wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant.Earlier, the first session belonged to Musheer, who missed out on a well-deserved double century. The combination of Musheer and Saini frustrated the India A bowlers. Musheer, who began the day on 105, easily picked the bad balls while Saini was far less adventurous and ground it out as the duo put on 88 runs before lunch.During their 205-run association , they bettered the record for the eighth-wicket partnership in the competition, going past the 197 compiled by Abhishek Nayar and Ramesh Powar for West Zone in 2010.Kuldeep Yadav finally ended the partnership in the second over after lunch. Two deliveries after he went down on his knees to launch Kuldeep into the stands over mid-on, Musheer was lured by a tossed-up delivery which he top-edged to Parag at deep square-leg.Saini, who until then was happy to play second fiddle, survived a LBW call when he was on 42. He made the reprieve count by bringing up his second first-class half-century with a boundary off Kuldeep, but could not extend his stay. Akash Deep cleaned up the last two wickets to finish with a four-wicket haul.","Mumbaikar Musheer and Navdeep Saini put on record 8th-wicket stand for India B against India A.

It's the rarest of rare phenomenon. Jim Laker of England achieved it in 1956, India's Anil Kumble in 1999, and New Zealand left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel was the last one in 2021.Patel's feat came against India at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. His feat, however, couldn't stop India from winning the Test by a massive 372-run margin.Since the Mumbai Test , Patel has played just five Test matches for New Zealand - his last coming 9 months back against Bangladesh in Mirpur, Dhaka.Patel had match figures of 8/111 in the Test, and helped New Zealand win the match by 4 wickets. The Black Caps had lost the first of the two-Test series against Bangladesh, and the Mirpur win helped them draw the series 1-1.Despite his heroics, Patel has largely been a sub-continent centric personnel for New Zealand. In fact, he has played just three of his 16 Tests back home in New Zealand.Surely, there is frustration of not getting regular chances to represent his country, but Patel hasn't let it affect his spirit and hunger.""If you ask all New Zealand spinners, it is difficult. Obviously, you don't get as many opportunities at home because of our home conditions,"" Patel said at the venue (Shaheed Vijay Singh Pathak Cricket Stadium, Greater Noida) of New Zealand's one-off Test against Afghanistan.""But it breeds more hunger when you do come to conditions like this (in the sub-continent), and you know conditions that are spin friendly and you're quite hungry to get out there and play and put your best foot forward and perform. But it's really important that you do prepare accordingly and prepare well. So, it's just about going into these games and really enjoying the conditions and making the most of it.""For Patel, the 10-wicket haul is still fresh in his mind ""as if it has happened just yesterday"", but the 35-year-old yearns to keep growing in the Test arena. He has also ""somewhat remodelled"" his run-up in order to get more success.""We're in a professional environment and for us it's really important to just go out there and continue to work on our game and keep improving and keep growing. I guess after the 10 wickets, obviously, you're a little bit disappointed when you don't get as many opportunities.""Since my 10 wickets, I've somewhat remodelled my run-up and look to grow myself and get better. It's always about improving and making sure that you're ready whenever that next opportunity comes,"" Patel said.In the next two months, Patel has the chance to play six Test matches. Besides the one-off Test against Afghanistan, New Zealand fly to Sri Lanka for two Tests and then return to India for three more Tests. According to ICC's Future Tours Programme, New Zealand's next trip to Asia for Tests is in Feb 2027. Patel, therefore, wants to make full use of the upcoming six Tests.""It always depends on conditions, and it depends on form and you making sure that you play well,"" Patel said of the possibility of playing all 6 Tests in Asia. ""It's a great opportunity as a spinner. It's something that I'm looking forward to and pretty excited about.""Patel will also look to pick the brains of Sri Lanka's former ace left-arm spinner Rangana Herath , who has been roped in as New Zealand's spin-bowling coach for the one-off Test against Afghanistan and following two Tests versus Sri Lanka.""If you look at me and you look at Rangana, we're pretty similar in terms of our build and body types. While developing and growing my spin, I watched him with a lot of admiration. So really, really special to have him with us, and for me, it's a great opportunity to spend some time with him and really understand how he crafted his bowling,"" said Patel.",Only three bowlers in the history of cricket have taken 10 wickets in an innings of a Test match. Ajaz Patel's feat came against India at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. Patel has played just five Test matches for New Zealand since the Mumbai Test.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113141673,imgsize-28162,width-400,resizemode-4/113141673.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Ollie Pope , playing on his home turf at the Oval, rediscovered his batting touch and scored his first century as England's captain during the first day of the third Test against Sri Lanka on Friday.Prior to this match, Pope had struggled with the bat, accumulating only 30 runs in four innings since taking over the captaincy from the injured Ben Stokes at the beginning of the series, AFP reported.However, when poor light conditions forced an early end to the day's play, Pope remained unbeaten on 103 off just 103 balls, putting England in a strong position at 221-3.Despite winning the toss and opting to field first, Sri Lanka, who trail the three-match series 2-0, were unable to capitalize on the favorable bowling conditions, which included overcast skies and a pitch with a tinge of green.England opener Ben Duckett squandered an opportunity to reach his century on Friday, as he once again lost his wicket after scoring 86 runs.Despite England's dominant performance, Sri Lanka had a moment to celebrate when they dismissed Joe Root for 13 runs, just before the tea break. Root's dismissal came after his record-breaking feat at Lord's, where he scored two centuries and surpassed the previous England record with his 34th Test hundred.England, having already secured a 3-0 victory against the West Indies earlier in the season, are now aiming for their first clean sweep in a home Test campaign since 2004, when Michael Vaughan led the team to seven consecutive wins.Duckett wasted no time in making his presence felt, as he confidently struck consecutive fours off Milan Rathnayake's deliveries through the cover region.It was a different story for makeshift opener Dan Lawrence , typically a middle-order batsman. With Zak Crawley sidelined due to injury, Lawrence was thrust into the role of opener for this series.However, he struggled, managing just five runs before mistiming a short-pitched delivery from Lahiru Kumara, top-edging an easy catch to gully.At number three, Ollie Pope got off the mark in style, cutting a loose delivery from fast bowler Rathnayake for four, and later hooking a six off Lahiru Kumara. Meanwhile, the 29-year-old Ben Duckett raced to a brisk fifty, reaching the milestone in just 48 balls, including seven boundaries.Despite the floodlights being on, the umpires deemed conditions too unsafe to continue and halted play due to bad light, with England at 76-1 after 15 overs. Shortly after, rain began to fall, delaying the match further until it resumed at 1410 GMT.Duckett wasted no time, ramping Kumara for six over fine leg and then uppercutting him high over third man. Sri Lanka’s four-man pace attack struggled to maintain a consistent line and length throughout.However, Duckett, nearing his fourth century in 26 Tests, fell short when an ambitious scoop off Rathnayake was mistimed and caught by wicketkeeper Dinesh Chandimal. His dismissal ended a 95-run partnership with Pope in just 16 overs.Pope, 26, had a stroke of luck when a top-edged six off Kumara went his way, but Kumara struck back by dismissing Root, caught by Vishwa Fernando at fine leg despite Fernando slipping on the wet turf.Pope, 84 not out at tea, completed his seventh Test hundred - and his first at The Oval -when he elegantly square-drove Asitha Fernando for his 13th boundary, bringing up his century off 102 balls, including two sixes. But once again, bad light forced the players off the field at 1653 GMT, and no further play was possible on Friday.","Ollie Pope scores his first century as England's captain during the first day of the third Test against Sri Lanka.

Sometimes, obviously you don't get as many opportunities at home because of our home conditions,"" Patel told reporters here on Friday ahead of New Zealand's one-off Test against Afghanistan, which begins from September 9.""But it breeds more hunger when you do come to conditions like this and you know conditions that are spin-friendly and you're quite hungry to get out there and play and put your best foot forward and perform. But it's really important that you do prepare accordingly and prepare well,"" he added.The 35-year-old Mumbai-born left-arm spinner had made history by taking all 10 Indian wickets in the first innings of the Mumbai Test in 2021, becoming only the third bowler behind Jim Laker and Anil Kumble to achieve the feat.Despite this accomplishment, Patel has played just five Tests for New Zealand since then, with four of those matches taking place in the subcontinent.

NEW DELHI: Cristiano Ronaldo , the iconic Portuguese forward, recently etched his name deeper into the annals of football history by scoring his 900th career goal during Portugal's UEFA Nations League match against Croatia.The 39-year-old’s goal, a tap-in volley from Nuno Mendes' cross, sealed a 2-0 lead, and eventually, Portugal triumphed 2-1. Ronaldo’s emotional reaction on the field, as he hit this incredible milestone, speaks volumes about the dedication, hard work, and excellence that have driven his illustrious career.With 900 goals across club and international football, Ronaldo has set a bar that seems almost untouchable.His tally includes 450 goals for Real Madrid , 145 for Manchester United, 101 for Juventus, 68 for his current club Al Nassr, 5 for Sporting Lisbon, and a stunning 131 for Portugal.However, some footballers are still in the race, albeit at a distant pace. Below are the top three footballers who are chasing Cristiano Ronaldo’s 900-goal mark .Lionel Messi, Ronaldo’s eternal rival, is closest to his 900-goal mark with 859 career goals to date. The Argentine forward's career has been nothing short of legendary, with countless records for both club and country.Messi has amassed 672 goals for Barcelona , 32 for Paris Saint-Germain, and now plays for Inter Miami in Major League Soccer. His international career with Argentina has been equally spectacular, with 103 goals, including helping Argentina lift the 2022 FIFA World Cup.At 37 years old, Messi continues to score regularly, especially in MLS, and his pursuit of Ronaldo's milestone adds yet another layer to their age-old rivalry.Polish striker Robert Lewandowski has been one of Europe’s most consistent goal-scorers over the last decade.With 635 career goals to his name, he ranks among the top in football history. Having played most of his club career with Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich, Lewandowski is now at Barcelona, where he continues to add to his tally.Known for his technical prowess and finishing ability, Lewandowski has also scored 81 international goals for Poland.At 36, while catching Ronaldo seems far-fetched, Lewandowski's legacy as one of the most clinical strikers is firmly established.Luis Suárez, the Uruguayan forward, has been an integral part of football's elite strikers over the past two decades.With 578 goals in his career, Suárez has left an indelible mark on every club he’s played for. His exploits for Liverpool, Barcelona, Atlético Madrid, and now Gremio have made him one of the most feared forwards of his generation. Suárez’s 68 international goals for Uruguay further underscore his reputation as a top performer.Though nearing the twilight of his career at 37, Suárez’s hunger for goals remains undiminished, and he could well climb the all-time rankings before hanging up his boots.Cristiano Ronaldo’s 900-goal achievement has set a monumental benchmark in the world of football. While Lionel Messi remains the closest contender to challenge Ronaldo’s record, other greats like Robert Lewandowski and Luis Suárez are making their way into football’s all-time top scorer lists.However, Ronaldo’s legacy as the first male footballer to cross the 900-goal mark will remain an awe-inspiring achievement, setting an almost insurmountable challenge for the next generation of players.","Cristiano Ronaldo recently scored his 900th career goal against Croatia. The 39-year-old has scored 450 goals for Real Madrid, 145 for Manchester United, 101 for Juventus, 68 for his current club Al Nassr, 5 for Sporting Lisbon, and a stunning 131 for Portugal.

Can Haaland dethrone Shearer?

The Premier League has been home to some of the most prolific goal-scorers in football history , from legends like Alan Shearer and Thierry Henry to modern-day stars such as Mohamed Salah and Harry Kane . Yet, a young Norwegian striker, Erling Haaland , has stormed into the league with such ferocity that the conversation has shifted: can he become the greatest goal-scorer in Premier League history?Since joining Manchester City in 2022, Haaland’s impact has been nothing short of extraordinary.The 24-year-old striker wasted no time in etching his name into the record books, setting benchmarks that have stunned both fans and pundits alike.Haaland's goal-scoring prowess is evident in the records he has shattered in just a short span:Alan Shearer, with his 260 Premier League goals, holds the all-time record—a number that has seemed untouchable for nearly two decades. However, Haaland’s blistering start has led many to wonder if the Norwegian sensation could eventually eclipse this legendary figure.At just 24 years old, and already amassing 70 Premier League goals, Haaland has time on his side. If he maintains his current pace, it’s possible that he could break Shearer’s record within the next six or seven seasons. His ability to find the net in nearly every game, combined with his physical attributes, technical skills, and Manchester City's dominance under Pep Guardiola, positions him as a real contender to become the league's greatest scorer.If Haaland stays fit and continues to grow as a player, his potential seems limitless. The football world will be watching closely to see if the Norwegian phenom can indeed become the greatest goal-scorer the Premier League has ever seen.","In his debut campaign, Haaland became the first player to score a hat-trick in the Manchester City derby.

Ronaldo's 5 Ballon d'Or wins (2008, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017): Ronaldo's extraordinary athleticism, coupled with his unmatched ability to deliver in the biggest moments, saw him claim the Ballon d'Or five times, making him the second-most decorated player after Messi.

2018-2022: Cracks in the dominance

2024: The Turning of the Tide

For the first time since 2003, football's most illustrious prize, the Ballon d'Or, will not feature the names of Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo . The omission of these two football giants, who have defined a generation of football and shared an unparalleled rivalry, marks the end of an era and the beginning of a new chapter in the sport.From 2004 to 2023, Ronaldo and Messi dominated the Ballon d'Or narrative, not just as nominees but as record-breaking winners.Their two decade-long duel for the prestigious award transcended football, captivating fans and pundits alike. Now, as the 2024 edition of the Ballon d'Or rolls out its nominee list without either legend, we take a look back at their extraordinary impact on the award over the last 20 years.When Ronaldo earned his first Ballon d'Or nomination in 2004, few could have predicted the rivalry that was about to unfold. Messi followed with his first nomination in 2006. At this point, Ronaldinho, Kaka, and Fabio Cannavaro still ruled the roost. Kaka, in particular, was the last player outside Messi and Ronaldo to win the Ballon d'Or before the duo took full control of the award in the subsequent decade.The period from 2008 to 2017 belongs entirely to Messi and Ronaldo. Ronaldo won his first Ballon d'Or in 2008, while Messi claimed his first in 2009. From then on, the pair alternated between first and second places, occasionally disrupted by the odd third-place finish, but always miles ahead of their competition.The stranglehold of Messi and Ronaldo began to show signs of weakening in 2018. That year, Croatian midfielder Luka Modric broke the duo's ten-year dominance by winning the Ballon d'Or, thanks to his performances for Real Madrid and Croatia's run to the World Cup final.Messi bounced back with wins in 2019 and 2021, while Ronaldo continued to finish in the top three regularly. After Modric's 2018 win, Karim Benzema grabbed the coveted trophy in 2022, before Messi won his record-extending eighth last year in 2023.The 2024 Ballon d'Or nominee list is a watershed moment for football. For the first time since 2003, neither Messi nor Ronaldo features among the nominees. Both have entered the twilight of their careers, with Messi now plying his trade in the MLS with Inter Miami and Ronaldo playing in Saudi Arabia's Al-Nassr. Their omission signals a changing of the guard, with the new faces of football poised to take center stage.In total, Ronaldo and Messi accounted for 13 Ballon d'Or trophies between 2008 and 2023. Their rivalry wasn't just about personal glory; it pushed their respective teams, Barcelona , Real Madrid, Juventus, and Argentina and Portugal, to achieve unprecedented success.","Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo dominated the Ballon d'Or from 2004 to 2017. Ronaldo won the award five times, making him the second-most decorated player in history. Messi won a record eight times, the most of any player in the history of the award. Their dominance was finally broken in 2018, when Luka Modric won.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113118469,imgsize-80066,width-400,resizemode-4/113118469.jpg"

Argentina solidified their dominance in South America 's 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying tournament with a 3-0 victory over Chile on Thursday. Goals from Alexis Mac Allister, Julian Alvarez, and Paulo Dybala secured the win at the Estadio Monumental in Buenos Aires.This victory further strengthened Argentina's position at the top of South America's 10-team qualifying group, leading by five points after seven games.The top six teams from this group will automatically qualify for the World Cup in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, while the seventh-placed team will advance to a playoff.The match saw Liverpool midfielder Mac Allister scoring the opening goal three minutes after halftime. Alvarez, formerly of Manchester City, doubled Argentina's lead in the 84th minute with a powerful shot from outside the penalty area. Dybala, who came on as a substitute, sealed the victory with a goal in stoppage time.Although Argentina played without injured captain Lionel Messi and retired veteran Angel Di Maria, they showcased their depth and talent. Argentina fielded a strong attacking lineup, including Lautaro Martinez and Atletico Madrid's Alvarez, who created significant problems for Chile's defense.Argentina has been on a strong run of form, having already beaten Chile 1-0 en route to winning back-to-back Copa America titles earlier this year. The absence of key players like Messi and Di Maria did not hinder their performance.In a separate qualifier on Thursday, Bolivia reignited their campaign with a resounding 4-0 victory over Venezuela. The match took place in El Alto, at an altitude of more than 4,000 meters (13,100 feet) above sea level.Bolivia's goals came from Ramiro Vaca, Carmelo Algaranaz, Miguel Terceros, and Enzo Monteiro. This win marked Bolivia's second victory in the qualifying tournament, lifting them to seventh place in the standings.The decision to play in El Alto, rather than the usual venue in neighboring La Paz, which sits at 3,600 meters above sea level, paid off for Bolivia, according to AFP report. The high altitude left Venezuela's players struggling for energy, while Bolivia capitalized on their home advantage. Despite the loss, Venezuela's coach Fernando Batista declined to attribute their poor performance to the altitude.Despite Thursday's heavy defeat, Venezuela remain in a strong position to qualify for the World Cup. The Vinotinto, the only South American team never to have qualified for a World Cup, are currently fourth in the standings with nine points from seven games, trailing Argentina, Uruguay, and Colombia. Venezuela will face Uruguay in their eighth qualifying game next Tuesday.","Argentina beat Chile 3-0 in their 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying match.

The 24-year-old Madurai boy, who is pursuing an undergraduate degree at Wake Forest University , reached the semifinals in men's doubles and showed promise in the singles department.In his first match in the ATP circuit in singles, Dhakshineswar rocketed 15 aces and caught the eyes of many Indians.Although he could not progress deep in singles, he was later handed an opportunity (wildcard) in doubles. He partnered with Luca Pow and made the most out of the opportunity by reaching the final-four stages.""I had no pressure to win or lose as this was my first ATP tournament. The excitement level was high as I got the chance to play with top-level players. Although the result did not go my way (in singles), it was a good experience. I am happy to have used the opportunity given to me,"" Dhakshineswar told TOI from the USA.Dhakshineswar spoke on the support of the home fans and stressed the areas where he needs to improve. ""The home crowd backed us throughout the competition. My strengths are serving aces and playing the forehand. I am a tall payer and I used it (serve) to my advantage. While playing at the elite level, you need to narrow down on your mistakes which I couldn't as I committed several unforced errors. The opponents overpowered us at times which did not help our cause. I need to assess the match situation and see when I can get the better of them (opponents).""The Indian tennis fraternity had a torrid time during the Covid-19 pandemic as they could not compete in tournaments regularly. The rankings of several players dropped and they had to start from scratch again. Dhakshineswar was among the many who bear the brunt during the pandemic.On top of that, he suffered an injury and lost one year in recovery. Then in 2022, Dakshineshwar shifted to the USA to pursue his undergraduate degree and the decision is slowly reaping fruits. After completing my schooling, I tried to play professionally but due to the pandemic, I could not compete much. I thought of studying in the USA and playing simultaneously. I am now happy to be in college and play good tennis. Most of the players in my college compete in the Challenger series. I train alongside them and the level of tennis is high.""The coaches here have helped me a lot. More than the technique, the coaches help us with the tactical play. At this stage, everyone can serve, and play forehand and backhand shots. But the ones who play tactically well and are mentally strong emerge victorious. We focus more on these aspects in training.""Dhakshineswar will have to play in a lot of ITF tournaments to improve his rankings. He is currently ranked 985th in singles and 502nd in doubles. ""As I am currently in college, I have not planned where to play next. I am looking forward to competing in the ITF tournaments near my place but nothing has been confirmed yet. I will try to attain good results in the ITF tournaments and then when I reach the desired ranking, I will play in the Challenger series.""Before finishing my degree (in 2026), I want to get inside the top-200 as it will get easier for me to play in the Challengers regularly,"" Dakshineshwar added.",Dhakshineswar Suresh from Tamil Nadu gave a good account of himself in his maiden ATP Tour competition.

Navarro had to save more break points to prevent falling down 2-5.This gave her challenge fresh energy, and when her opponent served to tie the match, she broke Sabalenka, bringing the score to 5-5.In the tiebreak, she even had a little break before Sabalenka came storming back to win.",Jessica Pegula will face Aryna Sabalenka in the US Open women's singles final.

Draper, who has grappled with a series of injuries early in his career, started the year ranked No.61 and is presently at his career best ranking. The Sutton-born pro was asked about his friendship with Sinner when accusations of favouritism following the announcement of the positive tests were swirling around the Italian.Draper and Sinner first met across the net in doubles at an ITF junior event. The Briton directed most shots at Sinner, who was seen as the 'weak link' on court. ""From there to watching his progress - winning the Bergamo Challenger (2019) to getting to the top 20 when all of us were 300, 400 in the world,"" Draper said, adding that the friendship found footing around the locker room. ""It started with sending messages to each other when we're having bad moments or good moments,"" Draper said.""It was a real good thing that we played doubles in Montreal. I loved being on court with him. It was strange being on court with someone that good. We played great doubles, and hopefully I get to play with him again. As a person, he's incredibly kind, genuine, funny, and that's more important than being the great player he is."" Friendship seems to be the theme of the US Open men's semifinals with the 26-year-old Americans Taylor Fritz and Frances Tiafoe also facing off in the last four. They are teammates and long-time friends. Sinner, whose play reflects the steel of his mentality, has no recollection of the doubles match against Draper in the juniors. ""I do remember seeing him from outside. Obviously lefty, there are fewer lefties (on Tour). His ball striking was always very, very good,"" Sinner said. ""In Montreal we got to know each other even more. It's a great friendship.""Draper, who hasn't lost a set so far, got his leg strapped midway through the quarterfinal, but dismissed injury worries with his play in the second half of the match. ""I watched the quarterfinal, he's hitting very, very strong. He's all-round a very good player,"" Sinner said of Draper's form. ""Also, it's the semis of a Grand Slam, it is going to be a tough match."" Even when the two men on either side of the net are great friends.","Jannik Sinner and Jack Draper will meet in the US Open semifinals on Friday. The world No.1 and the 25th-ranked Briton first met in doubles at an ITF junior event. Sinner, the Australian Open champion, has now reached the semi-finals at all four Slams.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113111449,imgsize-37648,width-400,resizemode-4/113111449.jpg"

Rajasthan men shuttlers win maiden North Zone title to make history; U-19 boys finish runner-up losing to Delhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/badminton/rajasthan-men-shuttlers-win-maiden-north-zone-title-to-make-history-u-19-boys-finish-runner-up-losing-to-delhi/articleshow/113136217.cms,"Results (Finals)

JAIPUR: Rajasthan is not a force to reckon with in badminton. They have never won a North Zone Inter-State Badminton Championship before. On Friday, however, the state’s men’s team made history by emerging champions, defeating former winners Haryana 3-1 at the North Zone Championship final in Chandigarh and paving the way for competing, for the first time, at the Senior Nationals.After stunning defending champions Delhi with a same margin in the semi-final on Thursday, Rajasthan men maintained their giant-killing run to clinch their maiden crown.The five-day annual tournament, organised by the Badminton Association of India (BAI), saw the participation of Haryana, Delhi, Punjab, Chandigarh, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. BAI conducts zonal tournaments in seven zones and only winners of each zone, and the host state, get tickets to compete in the Senior Nationals.With Friday’s victory, North Zone champions Rajasthan have automatically qualified for the 86th Senior National Badminton Championship scheduled to be held in Bengaluru from December 18 to 24.This year’s zonal tournaments also assume importance as the zonal winners sealed their berths in the National Games slated to be held in Uttarakhand at the end of the year.The summit clash between Rajasthan and Haryana was dominated by the former team executing a clinical display. Current Junior India player Sanskar Saraswat along with Pranay Katta won their respective singles to provide Rajasthan a strong start. It would have been a clean sweep had Harsh Chaplot not wasted a match-point opportunity against Haryana’s Gautam Arora. At 20-19 in the third and deciding game, Harsh only had to finish the point with a smash. Instead, he played a soft shot, which Arora retrieved to make it 20-20. Thereafter, the Haryana player won two successive points to win the second singles by a wafer-thin margin 21-14, 11-21, 20-22(1-1).That was the only success Haryana had as Rajasthan doubles pair Denish Shrivastava-Shubham Patel regained the lead (2-1) before Saraswat delivered the knock-out punch in the third singles. The second doubles was not required as Rajasthan took an unassailable lead (3-1) in the best-of-five-match encounter.Rajasthan coach Tribhuvan Bisht gave the credit of the historic triumph to the entire squad.“It was a dream come true for all of us. All players delivered when it mattered the most. They knew what was expected of them and they did not disappoint at all. Beating formidable teams like Delhi and Haryana in back-to-back matches was certainly a creditable achievement. We were the underdogs, but I knew this team had potential to perform well,” said Bisht, himself a veteran national champion.Rajasthan Badminton Association (RBA) secretary and BAI joint secretary KK Sharma termed it as a historic day.“There is no doubt that this is a historic day for the Rajasthan badminton fraternity. Nobody bet on us to win the title, but we proved them wrong. Now we can play the Senior Nationals as well as National Games this year. When I started my regime as RBA secretary, we used to finish at the bottom of the table. Now we are on top as far as the zonal tournament is concerned,” said Sharma.Rajasthan Under-19 boys, however, had lesser luck. They went down to Delhi in the final. This is the second year in a row that the Rajasthan junior team has had to settle for a silver medal.

However, Sanskar Saraswat sealed Delhi's fate by ousting Vaibhav Jadhav in a thrilling three-gave encounter. Sanskar lost the opening game narrowly but bounced back gallantly to clinch the crucial 19-21, 21-11, 21-9 win.Junior India player Sanskar was also the chief architect of U-19 boys team triumph over Haryana. The Jodhpur teenager won both his singles and doubles (with partner Manish Phogat) matches to almost single-handedly guide Rajasthan to back-to-back finals.However, it was curtains for Rajasthan U-19 girls team as they squandered away a 1-0 lead to go down fighting against Haryana 1-2.Rajasthan coach Tribhuvan Bisht lauded the efforts of the entire team.
