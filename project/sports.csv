Mike Johnson on Auston Matthews‚Äô recent struggles

Mike Johnson , a former NHL player and analyst, expressed concern over Auston Matthews ' current form, noting a slight dip in his explosiveness on the ice. He highlighted that Matthews' game relies on quick bursts, not necessarily outright speed, but rather his ability to stop and start efficiently, win puck battles, protect the puck, and get his shot off effectively.Mike Johnson observed that Auston Matthews seems to be lacking that extra sharpness, which could be due to fatigue rather than an injury. However, he stressed that Matthews needs to regain this aspect of his game, especially with the playoffs approaching, as it plays a crucial role in his overall effectiveness on the ice.During an interview on First Up on Thursday, Mike Johnson remarked,""When he‚Äôs at his best, he has that fractionally more explosive burst in his game. Not necessarily blowing past guys, but stopping and starting, winning puck battles, protecting the puck, and getting his shot off. Right now, he doesn‚Äôt quite have that same explosiveness. That might be more fatigue-related than injury-related, but it‚Äôs something he needs to get back.""In addition to Matthews' form, Johnson also touched on Toronto's potential interest in acquiring veteran forward Brayden Schenn ahead of the trade deadline. While Schenn could bring valuable experience and physicality to the roster, Johnson questioned whether the cost of acquiring him‚Äîlikely in the form of draft picks or young assets‚Äîwould be too steep for the Leafs, given their current needs and salary cap situation.As the playoffs approach, the Maple Leafs will need their star players, especially Auston Matthews, to be at their best. While the team has performed well despite his dip in production, his ability to regain his explosiveness could be the key to a deep postseason run. Meanwhile, the front office faces crucial decisions, including whether acquiring a player like Brayden Schenn is worth the potential cost. With big games ahead, all eyes will be on Matthews and the Leafs as they push toward the playoffs.Also Read: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been worried‚Äù: Nick Robertson sent a blunt message clarifying his future with the Toronto Maple Leafs","Mike Johnson, a former NHL player and analyst, expressed concern over Auston Matthews'current form, noting a slight dip in his explosiveness on the ice.

David Pastr≈à√°k would happily exchange his individual streak for the Bruins

Joe Sacco and select players speak to the media following the Bruins 2-1 loss to the Islanders.

The Boston Bruins played short forward during their game against the New York Islanders on Thursday evening. David Pastr≈à√°k was the only scorer for the Bruins as they lost to the New York Islanders 2-1, taking his point streak in the NHL to 16 games.This equals the Czech record which was earlier established by Jaromir J√°gr and Robert Lang. The 28-year-old winger, who has recorded 14 goals and 17 assists in this span, reached a milestone with his 800th NHL point. Pastr≈à√°k scored in the 51st minute on a feed from Pavel Zacha, cutting the deficit to 2-1, but Boston could not take advantage, losing its fifth consecutive game.David Pastr≈à√°k stretched his point streak to 16 games, but it was overshadowed by the loss of the Boston Bruins 2-1 at home to the New York Islanders. Even while Pastr≈à√°k reached that benchmark, he complained about how nothing matters in his individual performance if the team itself is underperforming. With the Bruins suffering their fifth straight loss (0-3-2), he conceded he would happily exchange his individual streak for wins, pointing to the frustration of the team as they seek to end their slump.""Yeah, I mean, I said it ‚Äî I would give up the point streak for wins,‚Äù he said. ""I‚Äôm playing a team sport, so I just want to get it up and get back on a winning streak. I‚Äôm not focusing on anything else other than our team game right now, and obviously, trying to do my best to help the team.

The Bruins outshot the Islanders, but couldn't score enough goals. ‚Äú(I am) frustrated,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúBoth goalies played an amazing game, (it's a) tough break. Sorokin had a great night.

Champions Trophy: How good is Virat Kohli in football? | Rishabh Pant recovers from viral

DUBAI: At a time when Pakistan's cricket team has been panned left, right and centre by many of the country's former players - now experts on TV shows - and the disgruntled public, there is someone who is not willing to be as harsh on Mohammad Rizwan & Co. In an exclusive interview with TOI from London, where he currently lives, former Pakistan captain Asif Iqbal asserted that ""nothing is wrong with Pakistan cricket ,"" while pointing out that ""no one is talking about what's wrong with English cricket .""Like Pakistan, England too were knocked out of the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy , when they lost their first two matches in Group B to Australia and Afghanistan at Lahore.""Nothing is wrong with Pakistan cricket. The other teams are playing better cricket than Pakistan. Whether batting first or chasing, we lost because our opponents played better cricket than us. Why is no one talking about what‚Äôs wrong with English cricket? Batting first, they couldn‚Äôt defend 351, and batting second, they couldn‚Äôt chase down 326. I have a totally different view on this,"" Iqbal told TOI.Summing up Pakistan's six-wicket defeat to India at the Dubai International Stadium beautifully in one line, Iqbal, 82, who played 58 Tests and 10 ODIs for Pakistan between 1964 to 1980, said, ""We were outplayed in every department, except the toss!""""The reason for this hype is the expectation of the supporters of both teams that their team is better than their opponents and not realistic enough to accept that the present Indian team is on the top of rankings and we are at the bottom,"" Iqbal said.Explaining his point, Iqbal said, ""Look, I want to emphasise here that the expectations of the Indian and Pakistani fans makes an Indo-Pak contest look like the clash of the titans. The fact is that you call it a clash of the titans when, for example, in tennis, No 1 ranked player plays a No 3, or No 4 ranked player, it will be billed as the clash of the titans. However, if a superstar and all-time great like Novak Djokovic plays a 100th ranked player in the second round, he will be expected to win, and if he loses, it will be termed as a 'shock'. Likewise, if Pakistan beat India, or any other team, in an ICC event, that other team must have a very bad day. And I'm not belittling Pakistan here, but stating the reality. Pakistan has lost to a second-string South Africa and New Zealand at home recently. So, for me, it wasn't a surprise that they lost to India and New Zealand in the 2025 Champions Trophy. Ultimately, these are the players that we have. It's better to give them confidence. TV pe gaali-goj (criticising them) won't help.""While India aren‚Äôt playing a match at Sharjah, a place where Iqbal was instrumental in starting international cricket and once a famous venue for India-Pakistan matches, the Pakistan great was saddened by India refusing to travel to Pakistan to play their matches in the 2025 Champions Trophy. ""More importantly India is not playing in Pakistan in an ICC tournament. Really sad."" he said.Raving about Indian superstar Virat Kohli , who bounced back into form by scoring his 51st ODI hundred, against Pakistan at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday night, Iqbal said, ""Yet again, Virat has shown that form is temporary, but class is permanent. The beauty about Virat is that when the stakes are higher, his concentration levels go up, and his delivery rate goes higher. It's amazing how he manages to keep doing this,"" Iqbal gushed.Impressed by how the likes of Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer have added muscle to India's ODI batting line-up, he said, ""India are fortunate to have the best bench strength in the cricketing world. If someone is injured or unavailable, they immediately have someone to replace him. It means a lot for the future of their game. Not many teams have this luxury.‚ÄùPraising Afghanistan for their fine show in ICC tournaments, Iqbal said, ""Before the tournament began, I had said that I expected Afghanistan to beat at least one top ranked team in their group, and they've done that by beating England. They are building into a good side, one of the top teams in world cricket.""","Former Pakistan captain Asif Iqbal tells TOI that ""nothing is wrong with Pakistan cricket"" He also says that ""no one is talking about what's wrong with English cricket"" The 82-year-old played 58 Tests and 10 ODIs for Pakistan between 1964 to 1980.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118640467,imgsize-89318,width-400,resizemode-4/118640467.jpg"

Travis Kelce has three hard-and-fast rules in his relationship with Taylor Swift

Travis Kelce, the 35-year-old Kansas City Chiefs player, allegedly has three hard-and-fast rules in his relationship with Taylor Swift, also 35. The two, who started dating over the summer of 2023, are frequently spotted together and have both attained tremendous success in their careers‚ÄîSwift as one of the world's largest music icons and Kelce as a vital member of the Chiefs. Even with their great push, the Chiefs failed to reach the Super Bowl following a 40-22 defeat to the Philadelphia Eagles on February 9.The Kansas City Chiefs superstar Travis Kelce has three hard and fast rules when it comes to his relationship with singer Taylor Swift. Dating since summer 2023, the two are regularly spotted together and are a hot topic for fans and the media. Swift is among the world's leading musicians, and Kelce is an integral part of the Chiefs, who came up short of the Super Bowl after a 40-22 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on February 9.According to the Life and Style Magazine, through MSN, Taylor Swift apparently has some 'rules' about how Kelce can stay in contact with her and whom the football player can socialize with during his free time.‚ÄúThey‚Äôll be doing lots of texting and calling, too, but Taylor likes to see Travis in real time,‚Äù a source said. ‚ÄúShe likes to know where he is and who he‚Äôs with. It‚Äôs not that she doesn‚Äôt trust him; she just wants to feel connected. Taylor loves Travis‚Äô energy and spontaneity, but she doesn‚Äôt want him wasted at the bar with pals. He can celebrate his wins in style with her and their friends.‚ÄùBeing a high-level athlete, Travis Kelce probably does not have much of his free time spent in bars, considering the strenuous nature of his profession. Otherwise, when he is not training or on the field, he co-hosts the extremely popular New Heights podcast with his brother Jason Kelce, a retired NFL great. The podcast has attracted an enormous following and gives fans an inside look at football and the brothers' personal lives.The third rule in the relationship of Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift is one that is most argued about. The couple has reportedly agreed to not be seen with others of the opposite gender to avoid gossip and speculation. This ruling, though questionable, is probably a move to preserve their privacy and keep away from extra reinforcement from their respective professions.‚ÄúTaylor‚Äôs been in this biz long enough to know what comes with being in the spotlight,‚Äù they added.The Chiefs star recently disclosed his relationship during an appearance on the Stephen A. Smith Show. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm enjoying all aspects of life,"" said Kelce. ""Me and Taylor are happy and I couldn‚Äôt be happier to enjoy that confidence off the field and all the support I could ever ask for at the stadium.""He added, ‚ÄúI think personally, the beauty of being in a very strong relationship is that you get that support to be able to come in and focus on your craft, focus on being the best version of you. I think I‚Äôm as focused as I‚Äôve ever been on my job and being the best player that I could possibly be week in, week out for this team.""Also Read: ‚ÄúEnjoyed a quiet night‚Äù: Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift return to the spotlight following international getaway after Chiefs' Super Bowl loss","Travis Kelce, 35, and Taylor Swift, also 35, started dating over the summer of 2023.

In the Women‚Äôs Chamber match six participants joined the ring to determine who would challenge Women‚Äôs World Champion Rhea Ripley .Bianca Belair had a tough bout, but the women‚Äôs champion pinned Liv Morgan to clinch the Elimination Chamber title for the second time. As per reports, Rhea Ripley or Iyo Sky will face Belair at WrestleMania, potentially setting up a dream match.The seventh Women's Elimination Chamber kicked off rough for Bianca Belair as she was forced to see Jade Cargill make a shocking return. Belair was initially distraught as no one could help Naomi, as the other women were all locked in their respective pods.Bianca Belair shrieked in disbelief as her good friend was beaten down right and utterly destroyed Naomi, who was stretchered off later in front of her. However, she came up trumps, scoring the winning pin fall on Liv Morgan to punch her ticket to WrestleMania 41.After Liv Morgan attacked Alexa Bliss, she faced Belair who later attacked Morgan with a braid slap, whipping right across her waist. The impact was such that it left a cut, and the effects of that whip were visible. But, Bianca did not stop there, she followed it with a dive off the top of the pod on all three opponents ‚Äì Alexa Bliss, Liv Morgan, and Roxanne Perez.Later, she locked Morgan between her shoulders and tossed her into the pods and the chains surrounding the chamber repeatedly, before pinning down Morgan finally to win the title again.It is now expected that Bianca Belair will be challenging reigning Women's World Champion Rhea Ripley or Iyo Sky at the Show of Shows. This will be decided after the duo squares off in a title match on RAW on Monday , on March 4, 2025.The 35-year-old is a three-time Women's World Champion and won the WrestleMania 37 against Sasha Banks.

When and where to watch the Charlotte Hornets play tonight against the Washington Wizards (March 1, 2025)?

The Charlotte Hornets face another challenging game as they prepare to host the Washington Wizards on Saturday, March 1, at the Spectrum Center. However, all eyes are on star guard LaMelo Ball, who is listed as questionable due to an ankle injury. His potential absence could significantly impact the Hornets‚Äô already struggling season. LaMelo Ball might be absent from tonight‚Äôs game. There is a lot of uncertainty as he is listed as GTD on the team‚Äôs injury report. LaMelo Ball, who leads the team with an average of 26.3 points per game, has been a bright spot in an otherwise disappointing campaign for Charlotte. His ability to score and create opportunities for teammates has been crucial, but his lingering ankle issue has raised concerns. The Hornets are already without key players like Grant Williams (ACL), Brandon Miller (wrist), and Tre Mann (back), all ruled out for the season.The Hornets‚Äô injury report also includes Jusuf Nurkic (illness) and Tidjane Salaun (ankle), both listed as questionable. With so many players sidelined, the team has struggled to find consistency, currently sitting at 14-44. Their offensive output ranks 28th in the NBA, averaging just 105.2 points per game, while their defense allows 112.8 points, ranking 13th.Ball‚Äôs recent performances have been limited, averaging only 7.6 points, 2.0 rebounds, and 2.7 assists over the last 20 games. His absence or limited availability could further hinder the Hornets‚Äô chances against the Wizards, who are also dealing with their own injury woes. Washington Wizards ' injury report includes Alex Sarr (ankle) as questionable, while Jordan Poole (elbow), Malcolm Brogdon (ankle), and Saddiq Bey (knee) are out. Despite their 10-48 record, the Wizards have shown flashes of competitiveness, led by Bilal Coulibaly, who averages a team-high 12.5 points per game.The game tips off at 6 p.m. ET and will be broadcast on FDSSE and MNMT. Fans can also stream the matchup on Fubo, though regional restrictions may apply.As the Hornets navigate a season marred by injuries, Ball‚Äôs status remains a critical factor. His presence on the court could provide a much-needed spark, but his absence would leave the team even more vulnerable. With both teams battling injuries and poor records, Saturday‚Äôs game could come down to which squad can overcome adversity and capitalize on limited opportunities.For now, Hornets fans will anxiously await updates on Ball‚Äôs condition, hoping their star guard can suit up and help turn the tide in what has been a difficult year for Charlotte basketball.","The Charlotte Hornets host the Washington Wizards on Saturday, March 1, at the Spectrum Center.

""It'll be nice. I'm not gonna lie, but you know it's still a long way to go. I don't know how many pucks are behind them, but you know, before Gretzky, it's a great name out there.""

""You're probably never going to see me on the ice again.""

""Instant retirement.""

""I don't like the word 'if'. We live today, we play, we move on."" says Alex Ovechkin about retiring after breaking Wayne Gretzky's record

""Do you follow the KHL? Your long-time teammate Ilya Kovalchuk, who returned to hockey at the age of 40?""

""I check the score periodically. Ilya is great. We talked to him recently. Getting ready for playoffs. I think this man, with his health and approach to business, can play until he is 50 years old. The most important thing is that he himself wants it.""

""Can you reach 50?""

""No!""

""Will you finish out your current contract in NHL, and that's it?""

""I think, yes.""

""And, if you don't manage to break Gretzky's goal record, won't you re-sign for the season?""

""I don't like the word 'if'. We live today, we play, we move on.""



""I don't want to play just for that record,"" says Alex Ovechkin about breaking The Great One's career NHL goals record of 894

""Of course, it (breaking Wayne Gretzky's record) matters. But, like I said, I'm not going to score 300 goals in two years. It's going to take five or six years. I have to be healthy enough to do that. I don't want to play just for that record. I want to be healthy, I want to have fun, I want to enjoy the moment when I'm on the ice.""

""Work, and everything will be fine. The most important thing is not showing off. Because when anyone shows off, it can come back to bite you in a big way.""

The race to the Serie A title remains closely contested after Napoli held rivals Inter Milan to a 1-1 draw on Sunday, thanks to a late equaliser by Danish midfielder Philip Billing at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona.The result keeps the reigning champions just one point behind league leaders Inter.With just three minutes left on the clock, Billing slotted in his maiden strike for Napoli, shortly after replacing Billy Gilmour.On loan from Bournemouth, the 32-year-old capitalized on a driving run from Stanislav Lobotka, reacting quickest to slot home after his initial effort was saved by Inter goalkeeper Josep Martinez.Until Billing‚Äôs intervention, Federico Dimarco‚Äôs stunning 22nd-minute free-kick looked set to secure a crucial victory for Inter in their title defense.Simone Inzaghi‚Äôs side found themselves under intense pressure for much of the match and had to rely on desperate defending in a bid to claim all three points.Inzaghi's plans were disrupted when both Federico Dimarco and Hakan Calhanoglu were forced off with injuries shortly after halftime, while Marcus Thuram also had to be replaced by Joaquin Correa in his first game back from an ankle injury.Inter could hardly have faced Napoli at a more opportune moment, with Antonio Conte‚Äôs side stumbling through February, collecting just three points from four matches after previously appearing destined for a second title in three seasons.However, despite Inter‚Äôs resilient defensive effort‚Äîmarked by last-ditch tackles and desperate clearances‚Äîtheir resistance was finally broken by Billing, who rescued his new team in just his second appearance since signing in January.Billing‚Äôs late equalizer also offered a lifeline to Atalanta, who extended their winless run at home to five Serie A matches, but remain third, after a goalless draw against Venezia. They are three points behind Inter.Gian Piero Gasperini‚Äôs side are still in the title race but have struggled to deliver in front of their home fans, failing to win a domestic fixture in Bergamo since the start of the year. They missed a golden opportunity to draw level with Inter before the showdown in Naples.Davide Zappacosta came closest to scoring five minutes before halftime, striking the outside of the post after excellent work from Ademola Lookman.Lookman himself squandered a one-on-one chance against Venezia goalkeeper Ionut Radu earlier in the match and later blazed over from close range in the 82nd minute.",Philip Billing scores late equaliser as Napoli draw 1-1 with Inter Milan.

John Cena Wins the Elimination Chamber match



Following the brutal Unsanctioned match between Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn, the most anticipated showdown of the night took place‚Äîthe Men's Elimination Chamber match . Each competitor stepped into the unforgiving structure, entering their designated pods. The match kicked off with ""The Scottish Warrior"" Drew McIntyre and ""The Visionary"" Seth Rollins going head-to-head.The third entrant was Damian Priest, who wasted no time unleashing a flurry of strikes on both McIntyre and Rollins upon entering the ring. The three superstars engaged in a hard-hitting exchange, adding intensity to the contest. Former U.S. Champion Logan Paul then entered the match, immediately targeting Rollins, Priest, and McIntyre with his signature offense.Priest took the fight to Paul outside the ring, near the chamber pod, punishing him with relentless attacks. Moments later, John Cena made his entrance, instantly hitting his opponents with Attitude Adjustments and Five Knuckle Shuffles. However, in a shocking turn of events, McIntyre delivered a devastating Claymore Kick to Cena. Before McIntyre could capitalize, Priest seized the opportunity, quickly pinning and eliminating him‚Äîmaking McIntyre the first shocking elimination of the match.Frustrated by his exit, McIntyre retaliated with another Claymore, this time to Priest. Seizing the moment, Logan Paul launched himself off the top of the chamber pod with a Frog Splash, pinning Priest to eliminate him.The final entrant, CM Punk , made his way into the ring, immediately targeting Logan Paul. The atmosphere intensified as Cena and Punk locked eyes, creating a moment of nostalgia for the WWE Universe. Punk then took out Paul with a GTS, securing his elimination.With only three competitors remaining‚ÄîCena, Punk, and Rollins‚Äîan unexpected alliance formed between Punk and Cena as they joined forces against Rollins.

Brief scores: Delhi Capitals 151 for 1 (Shafali 80*, Jonassen 61*) beat RCB 147/5 (Perry 60*, Pandey 2-24, Charani 2-28) by nine wickets

BENGALURU: Delhi Capitals became the first team to qualify for the WPL playoffs this year after they hammered home team Royal Challengers Bengaluru by nine wickets here on Saturday.Chasing 148, opener Shafali Verma and Jess Jonassen put on 146 runs for the second-wicket partnership as DC romped home with 4.3 overs remaining. Shafali remained unbeaten on 80 off 43 balls while Jonassen hit an unbeaten 61 off 38.

But as Ellyse (60 n.o, 3x4, 3x6) walked in, the crowd welcomed her with a raucous roar.The in-form Ellyse and opener Danni Wyatt-Hodge (21, 2x4, 1x6) quickly put behind the early setback as the hosts cruised to 45/1 at the end of powerplay. While the English top-order batter found her first boundary of the evening with a four over midwicket off Marizanne Kapp, Ellyse effortlessly dispatched Shikha in the next over.The pair then took on Jess Jonassen, smashing a couple of sixes in the penultimate over of the powerplay. Ellyse‚Äôs lofted straight shot saw the Australian become the leading run-scorer in the tournament‚Äôs history. But a strategic timeout by DC at the end of the seventh over, broke the rhythm as Marizanne Kapp once again handed Capitals the breakthrough with the well-set Wyatt-Hodge nicking it to ‚Äòkeeper Sarah Bryce.Sree Charani picked up two quick wickets in the 17th over.

Road to WrestleMania Still Undecided: Bianca Belair Confronted by Rhea Ripley and IYO SKY After WWE Elimination Chamber Win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/road-to-wrestlemania-still-undecided-bianca-belair-confronted-by-rhea-ripley-and-iyo-sky-after-wwe-elimination-chamber-win/articleshow/118657794.cms,"Rhea Ripley, IYO SKY and Bianca Belair (Image via WWE)

WrestleMania 41 will see Bianca Belair go after the Women's World Championship



Monday Night RAW between Rhea Ripley and IYO SKY will be an exciting match



The 2025 WWE Elimination Chamber is ongoing, and Bianca Belair has managed to win the Women's Elimination Chamber match against her opponents, defeating Alexa Bliss, Bayley, Liv Morgan, Naomi, and Roxanne Perez. But it's not a fairytale ending for the winner of the Chamber, as a new fight is brewing. Rhea Ripley and IYO SKY have both come out to the stage after Belair's win, and fans think that a three way match is on the horizon.The current Women's World Championship , Rhea Ripley, was seen at the end of the Women's Elimination Chamber match, after Bianca Belair was declared the winner . And then IYO SKY came up, much to the excitement of fans, who cannot wait for this confrontation to happen inside the ring. Belair is definitely going to WrestleMania, but who will she be facing off against?Rhea Ripley is the current champion, but things could change as soon as on Monday, when she faces off against IYO SKY on RAW. If she retains her title as the Women's World Champion, then Mami is going to Las Vegas for sure. But otherwise, it would be IYO SKY that Belair faces off against in WrestleMania. But that's not the kicker, as many think this could very well turn into a three-way match between Belair, Ripley and SKY.Given Rhea Ripley's interference during her match with Liv Morgan is the reason IYO SKY could not be a part of the Elimination Chamber , we will now see the two of them have a go at each other on RAW on March 4th for the Women's World Championship title. Whoever wins will go up against Belair at WrestleMania, but will that really be it? Fans didn't seem too opposed to the idea of a three-way when Ripley and IYO SKY both confronted Belair after her win at the Elimination Chamber.A Triple Threat match between these three women could be a highlight of WrestleMania this year. We already have Charlotte Flair vs. Tiffany Stratton to look forward to, and now the possibility that these three could come together could elevate the night to another level.

Can India overcome New Zealand in the ICC Champions Trophy?

Champions Trophy: Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli sweat it out in training session

South Africa 's poor record in the knockout rounds of the International Cricket Council (ICC) tournaments will once again be at the back of their minds as they entered the semifinals of the Champions Trophy on Saturday.South Africa hammered England by seven wickets in Karachi to finish on top of Group B and now wait to know whether they face India or New Zealand, who meet on Sunday to decide number one and two in Group A, in the semis.Australia finished second with four points to book the other last-four spot from Group B.Pacer Marco Jansen played a key role with the ball for SA on Saturday, taking 3 for 39 besides pouching three catches as they bowled out England for just 179.Rassie van der Dussen's 72 and Heinrich Klaasen's 64 led South Africa's chase, which they completed in just 29.1 overs.Jansen was named 'Man of the Match' for his effort and believes that his team can maintain the focus and winning momentum in the semifinals despite its poor record in knockout games.""I wouldn't say the mindset changes; it's just the occasion that's probably a bit more hyped up I guess,"" said Jansen.""You try your processes. It's a fancy term, but for me it's just (that) you have your steps or your guides that you go into every match (with) and then basically in the semifinals you just try and do that extraordinarily well.""South Africa's only success in an ICC tournament came way back in 1998 when they won the ICC Knockout Tournament. Talking about their recent slip-ups in ICC events, they lost to Australia in the 2023 ODI World Cup semis and then lost to India in last year's T20 World Cup final.Despite this history, Jansen believes South Africa don‚Äôt need to make significant changes for the knockout stage.""For me, it's just depending on where you play, on what lengths to hit and then as the game develops, try and figure out what works and what doesn't work,"" Jansen said.Talking about the possibility of facing India, who play all their matches in Dubai as part of a hybrid arrangement, Jansen noted that India will have the advantage of familiarity with the conditions by playing the entire tournament at the same stadium.""If we play in Dubai and it's against India, obviously they've had training and that kind of stuff, so they will be more used to the conditions. But we've also played in Dubai, so it's not something new. We play spin really, really well. So I don't think it's that much or that too much of an advantage,"" the pace reckoned.""I just think it all comes down to, on the day who plays better.""",South Africa beat England by seven wickets to finish top of Group B. They will now face either India or New Zealand in the semifinals. Marco Jansen believes his team can maintain winning momentum.

Ignored by state two years ago, batter's ton gives Vidarbha 286-run lead

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

Brief scores: Vidarbha 379 & 249/4 (K Nair batting 132, D Malewar 73; A Sarvate 1-55) lead Kerala 342 by 286 runs.

NAGPUR: The Kerala camp will spend a sleepless Saturday night regretting over Karun Nair . Over dropping a catch of the batter on Day Four. Over not responding to his offer a couple of seasons ago. Nair, having hit a purple zone this season, made most of a reprieve to take Vidarbha to a dominating position in the Ranji Trophy final . If Nair has his way on the final day, Kerala will feel the agony on Sunday and much beyond.Having fallen out of Karnataka selectors' favour two seasons ago, Nair wanted to shift to Kerala. The southern state, though, did not respond to Nair's SOS. Eventually, sensing that time was running out, the batter shifted base to Vidarbha. On Saturday, Nair made Kerala pay for both the reprieve and the cold shoulder.Inside three overs on Saturday, Vidarbha were staring down the barrel at seven for two. Nair, along with first innings hero Danish Malewar , began steading the ship.His rescue act was all but derailed in the 19th over by Eden Apple Tom. The medium pacer induced an edge off Nair, batting on 31. Akshay Chandran, standing in the slip cordon, though, suffered a ‚Äòyou just dropped the cup, mate' moment. Chandran grassed a regulation catch, and Kerala suffered for most of the day.Enjoying the form of his life, Nair scripted a Vidarbha comeback with an unbeaten knock of 132 (280b;10x4;2x6). Guiding young Malewar (73;162b;5x4), like he has done throughout this season, Nair took Vidarbha to position of strength at 249 for four in 90 overs.The pair stitched together a 182-run third wicket partnership to put Vidarbha in driver's seat -- with an overall lead of 286, and six wickets in hand, Vidarbha would hope to bat Kerala out of the title clash on Sunday.The start of Day Four saw Vidarbha reeling from early double blows by offie Jalaj Saxena and pacer MD Nidheesh. Playing their first Ranji final, Kerala pushed Vidarbha into a corner but failed to deliver the knockout punch.The lack of big stage experience showed. Apart from the dropped catch, Kerala also shied from placing an attacking field after having the rivals down and almost out. With no one placed in the slip area, two edges induced by Saxena went abegging, and Nair and Malewar made most of Kerala's shortcomings.The Nair-Malewar pair has so far produced 700-plus runs together for Vidarbha.In the first innings, Nair had missed out on a century through a run out. He made amends on Saturday. ‚ÄúI was very disappointed to get run out in the first innings. I felt I had missed out. So, I was determined to make it count today but batting in second innings is never easy with the wicket deteriorating,‚Äù Nair said after posting his ninth century of this domestic season.",Karun Nair scores 132 as Vidarbha take 286-run lead in Ranji Trophy final. Nair missed out on a century in the first innings through a run out.

Can India overcome New Zealand in the ICC Champions Trophy?

DUBAI: It could be a coincidence, but something that cannot be overlooked. Could New Zealand actually be doing well in ICC tournaments because they have a smaller pool of players to choose from? Batter Glenn Phillips , for one, seems to think so.""We are fortunate in New Zealand, where we do have a lot fewer players than India has to choose from, which means we can afford to give guys slightly longer runs before moving to potentially the next group of players.""And that does, obviously, give a lot of confidence. The intense competition is slightly different from what maybe the competition in India is from a pure numbers perspective,"" Phillips said.Phillips explained that in New Zealand, players prioritize playing for the team rather than for individual places. ""We've got guys waiting in the wings that are definitely ready to be here and to perform. So for us, we try not to think about that because we're all in it together.""There's a wider squad that is all involved, we're all New Zealand cricket as a whole in this team environment. That culture allows us to go out there and play for each other, as opposed to playing for ourselves individually for other spots, which I do think gives us a little bit of an advantage, say, over India who, you know, if you don't perform one day, you very well may not play the next two or three years,"" Phillips said.Since the time they've landed here, the Black Caps have sought to play down the controversy surrounding India getting to play all their Champions Trophy matches in Dubai. Phillips asserted that the Kiwis have a ""no-excuse mindset."" ""For us, there's no focus on anything like that. Obviously, the tournament draw is what it is. We have a no-excuses mindset to be able to come out to a tournament. You've dealt the hand that you've dealt, and India has been dealt a hand. We're never going to complain about what we get,"" he said.Phillips gave the Champions Trophy one of its best moments when he flew to his left at backward point to pouch a blinder to dismiss Pakistan captain Mohammad Rizwan. Asked in jest if he was using a glue stick, Phillips said, ""I wish I could say I've got a special glue tag but unfortunately, that's not the case. It comes down to a lot of hard work and then luck plays a good part!""","New Zealand have a smaller pool of players to choose from than India, says Glenn Phillips.

'It‚Äôs a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee ‚Äî Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match ‚Äî before the Nagpur ODI ‚Äî more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‚ÄòHitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.
