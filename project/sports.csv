Just when one of them presented a bouquet of flowers to Kohli and the batting legend accepted it with a 'thank you', another official wanted to shake hands with the batting icon.But with a bag in one hand and the bouquet in the other, Kohli said: 'Sir, do hi haath hain (I have two hands only),"" and walked past them.Before arriving in Kanpur, India had defeated Bangladesh by a mammoth 280 runs in the first Test at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai inside four days, with local man and veteran allrounder Ravichandran Ashwin starring with a century in the first innings and a six-wicket spell on the final day of the match.Ashwin was named the 'Player of the Match' for his all-round show.Among the other star performers were Pant and Shubman Gill, as both hit centuries to swell India's lead past the 500-run mark.

Visible Support of Caleb Williams by Ex-Girlfriend Alina Thyregod



Williams' Rocky Start in the NFL



Observations from Emmanuel Acho



“I am not surprised that Caleb Williams is struggling,”

“I am surprised that Caleb Williams is struggling this much. So yes, rookies should be rookies, but if you were better than all them, then I need you to be better than all them. So, Caleb, if you was better than all of the dudes then, why'd he caught you?

Bears Struggle Early in Season



Future Prospects: Under the Spotlight to Continue



Caleb Williams , the Chicago Bears’ highly anticipated rookie quarterback, is navigating the ups and downs of his debut NFL season with a mixture of pressure, performance critique, and unwavering support from his girlfriend, Alina Thyregod . As Williams faces scrutiny from fans and analysts alike, Thyregod has taken to social media to document their shared experiences, providing a personal glimpse into the life of an NFL rookie.Also read - ""Rachel Bush's Italian Getaway: A Luxurious Escape Ahead of Jordan Poyer's NFL Showdown"" At least in the NFL, the young quarterback may have a future.However, Ex-Girlfriend Alina Thyregod supports this young quarterback every step of the way. Alina Thyregod has been sharing her take on the latest happenings surrounding Caleb Williams, especially in TikTok where she posts heartwarming updates and moments concerning Williams' early days with the Bears.In one of her recent videos, she chronicled her experience from the Bears' only home game so far this season, wearing a custom denim outfit adorned with Williams' name, his jersey number, and the Bears' logo. Her posts have drawn attention for their blend of fashion and fandom, highlighting the unique role she plays as a supportive partner in the high-stakes world of professional football.Whereas the online presence of Thyregod has given the limelight to the positive side of the whole relationship course, Williams has had it rather rockier on the field. He has had a greater amount of scrutiny as he enters his rookie season as a quarterback and has faced several hiccups along the way.The well-played game Williams had against the Indianapolis Colts led him to his first two NFL touchdowns, an exciting achievement for any rookie. His success came along with two costly interceptions and being sacked four times, showing the grim curve he is likely to grapple on such a significant transition from high school to professional football.Not everyone is willing to chalk up Williams’ struggles to the usual rookie growing pains. Former NFL linebacker and sports analyst Emmanuel Acho weighed in on Williams' performance, delivering a pointed critique of the young quarterback. Acho expressed disappointment in how Williams has performed so far, suggesting that his reputation coming into the league was not matching up with his early showings.Acho said.” said Acho. For Williams, whose awkward mistakes with interceptions and sacks nobody saw coming considering all the hype that surrounded this young quarterback coming into the draft, added weight to the pressure mounting on him as every inch of his movements on and off the field is put into scrutiny.The overall performance of the Bears from Chicago has been discouraging this season as they have only managed to win one of the initially scheduled games. It is yet another irony that the team managed to win that singular game in the home match Thyregod witnessed - one of the magnificent moments of fan support amidst a rubbish season otherwise.The Bears' struggles mirror the growing pains that are not only for Williams but also the team as a whole, as they adapt to the expectations mounted on them in the early goings of this NFL season. As for Williams, the media has left him headachy, with all analysts, fans, and other stakeholders weighing every performance he makes.While Caleb Williams puts in work to get into a rhythm in the NFL, he does this under the scrutiny of football insiders and with Alina Thyregod's watchful eye from behind the lens. Sure, detractors abound at a sport this trendy, but Williams always has such a stalwart ally in Thyregod, his biggest fan-in-life as much as in social media.The coming weeks are surely going to be very crucial for Williams as he will be walking all over to silence the critics and clinch success in his rookie season. It may be on the grass or even on the webpage, but such a journey is one filled with challenges yet full of hope toward future triumphs.Also read - Taylor Swift, Olivia Culpo & NFL Wives Rally Behind Fashion Maven Kristin Juszczyk","Caleb Williams, the Chicago Bears' highly anticipated rookie quarterback, is navigating the ups and downs of his debut NFL season.

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant 's performance in the Brisbane Test during India's 2020-21 tour of Australia stands out as one of the most memorable in recent Indian cricket history.This Test, part of the famous Border Gavaskar Trophy , took place at the Gabba in Brisbane, where Australia had remained unbeaten for 32 years.The series was tied 1-1, and this was the decider.India had already suffered multiple injuries, and many key players were unavailable for the final match.Chasing 328 for victory, on a deteriorating fifth-day pitch, Pant came in at No. 5 when India were in a challenging situation, with the game still hanging in the balance.Pant scored an unbeaten 89 off 138 balls and his aggressive, counter-attacking approach put the pressure back on Australia. Despite losing wickets at regular intervals, Pant remained calm and played a fearless brand of cricket, combining solid defense with calculated aggression.India chased down the target of 328, winning by 3 wickets. This was the highest successful run-chase at the Gabba and one of the highest in India's history.Australia hadn't lost at the Gabba since 1988, making India's win historic and Pant took the intimidating Australian attack on a challenging fifth-day track by the scruff of its neck to conjure up an unbeaten 89-run knock that powered India to a 2-1 Test series victory and retaining the Border Gavaskar Trophy.The three-wicket win at the Gabba on the final day meant that India won an unprecedented back-to-back Test series victory Down Under.India did not play Pant in either the preceding ODI or the T20 series. But the wicketkeeper-batsman made an impression in the Test series, playing a combative 97-run knock in the second innings in Sydney and the match-winning knock in Brisbane.This innings cemented Pant 's reputation as a game-changer in Test cricket , known for his fearless style and his effort in the Brisbane Test is remembered as one of the most iconic performances by an Indian player in an away series.","Rishabh Pant scored an unbeaten 89 off 138 balls in the Brisbane Test.

Kuldeep Yadav: India vs Bangladesh: Will Kanpur Test be the best chance to play Kuldeep Yadav?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cricket-schedule-2024/bangladesh-in-india-2-test-series-2024/india-vs-bangladesh-will-kanpur-test-be-the-best-chance-to-play-kuldeep-yadav/articleshow/113684101.cms,"Kuldeep Yadav (PTI Photo)

Forever the backup to Ashwin & Jadeja, the much-improved spinner will be expecting to get a go on the expected slow turner at Green Park, his home ground. Kanpur’s favourite cricketer, though, has learnt to embrace the constant uncertainty over his spot in the XI.

Kuldeep Yadav (ANI Photo)

KANPUR: On a hot and draining Wednesday afternoon, local boy Kuldeep Yadav was one of the last players to emerge from the Indian dressing room for practice.Even from a distance, one could sense he was feeling at home, two days ahead of the second Test against Bangladesh.The Green Park Stadium has been Kuldeep’s hunting ground from his formative years. He is one of the biggest cricketers to have emerged from Kanpur.It’s worth highlighting that Kuldeep made his Test debut seven and a half years ago. He has also succeeded in retaining the element of mystery in his left-arm wrist spin. Yet, he is just 12 Test matches old, which is a bigger mystery. A return of 53 wickets at an average of 21.05, including four five-wicket hauls and three four-wicket hauls in these 12 matches, are impressive returns which can give even the best a run for their money.Instead, Kuldeep has forever been India’s backup spinner. He has probably made peace with it. He has gone through more nets sessions than actual game time. Kuldeep’s initiation in Test cricket coincided with the growing legend of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja Despite a stellar England series at home earlier this year, the team management could not find a place for him in the XI in the first Test against Bangladesh in Chennai, where the pitch had more in it for the seam bowlers.During a freewheeling chat with the media at the team hotel in the middle of the IPL earlier this year, Kuldeep had said that a few years ago, he had become egoistic and rigid towards change, which resulted in him losing form.Now, a few months shy of turning 30 and immune from such insecurities, he believes he has learnt to embrace the fact that he will forever be in competition with other spinners in India. “There will always be competition among spinners in India, irrespective of the format. There will always be four spinners ready to take the field. Now, I focus on continuously bettering myself and being ready to pounce on the opportunity when it comes,” Kuldeep would say.“When I was struggling at Kolkata Knight Riders four-five years ago, I needed a lot of guidance. Now I feel I don’t need anyone to guide me all the time,” he had said.Bangladesh coach Chandrika Hathurusinghe was emphatic in mentioning that India weren’t offering turners since his team has three potent spinners. But the Test starting here on Friday could be different.With a history of being a low and slow-spinning surface, the black soil here could still offer a little more kick for the spinners. Never mind the groundsmen sprinkling water over the pitch, with captain Rohit Sharma and coach Gautam Gambhir hovering over the centre square.That the Indian team management had expressed major reservations to the BCCI against playing in Kanpur is a discussion for another day. India seamer Akash Deep reckoned that they needed to wait another day to see how much the pitch dries up before assuming how the surface would play during the Test.Will this be the best chance to play Kuldeep irrespective of the possibility of overcast conditions during the first three days of the Test? Kuldeep himself is now used to such uncertainty.In fact, he has aced the waiting game. And that led him to shed his ego, change his run-up and the load-up in his delivery stride, allowing him to impart more pace on the ball.“It was tough to change something that you have been doing for 15 years. There were doubts when I was coming back from injury and going through these changes a couple of years back. I was not sure how it would turn out. But I decided to give myself more time to perfect it and then come back,” Kuldeep had said.The patience started bearing fruit and soon he reclaimed his position as India’s lead white-ball spinner last year, before that magical England series happened on flat decks in India this year. As he intended to, he did pounce on the opportunity.That series also saw him a bit steadier with the bat down the order — a feature of his game which had made him fall behind fellow spinners Ashwin, Jadeja and even Axar Patel. That’s why one saw him go through a rather long intense batting session along with the other spinners on Wednesday afternoon, two days before the Test.Off the top of the head, it would be a struggle to recall when Kuldeep last turned up for a Test match and had no impact on the game. That’s why, for his adoring home crowd, this wait to know whether he will play could be agonizing.","Kuldeep Yadav will be expecting to get a go on the expected slow turner at Green Park, his home ground.

It's our responsibility to keep up the good work done by the bowlers before me,"" Akash Deep said on Wednesday.The grind of domestic cricket ensured that he came into the Indian team aware of his skills. ""Over the last two years, I have played a lot of cricket — even after Ranji, you play Duleep Trophy and Irani Trophy. As a player, you need to understand yourself and know your strength. The domestic format is so good that by the time you reach this stage, you already know what to do.""The idea is to put your learning into practice,"" he said before going on to add, ""When I came here, it was more about the mindset to perform and think on your feet. That's what I'm trying to pick up from the likes of Bumrah and Siraj. When I got to the ground, Rohit bhaiya made things so simple for me that I didn't know if I was playing domestic cricket or international cricket.""Akash Deep's stocks are on the rise. His ability to hit the deck and derive seam movement has impressed the team management. But he still doesn't want to think of making it to the tour of Australia in Nov. ""I have only played two Test matches. My job is to go out and just hit the right length immediately,"" he said. Mohammed Shami is on the verge of a comeback, but Akash Deep certainly wouldn't want to miss out on the tour Down Under.","Just two Tests old, the nippy seamer from Bengal is fast coming up the ranks. He fondly remembers his roots in Uttar Pradesh and proudly declares that he is in awe just being at the Green Park Stadium.

The Budapest Gambit: How India outplayed the world to win double gold at Chess Olympiad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/the-budapest-gambit-how-india-outplayed-the-world-to-win-double-gold-at-chess-olympiad/articleshow/113584552.cms,"Team India (FIDE Photo)

In a historic moment for Indian chess, the nation has achieved an unprecedented double gold at the 2024 Chess Olympiad in Budapest, Hungary. This remarkable feat, accomplished on Sunday, marks a watershed moment in the country's chess history and solidifies India's position as a global powerhouse in the sport.The Indian open team, led by the prodigious talents of Gukesh D , Praggnanandhaa R , and Arjun Erigaisi , dominated the tournament with an impressive 21 out of 22 match points.Their final round victory against Slovenia, with a convincing 3.5-0.5 score, was a testament to their unwavering focus and competitive spirit.The women's team, featuring seasoned players like Harika Dronavalli alongside rising stars such as Divya Deshmukh, secured their gold with a crucial win against Azerbaijan in the final round, amassing 19 match points.This double triumph is not merely a statistical achievement but a culmination of years of strategic investment in chess development in India. The legacy of Viswanathan Anand , India's first Grandmaster and former world champion, is evident in the success of the current generation. Three of the open team's top players - Gukesh, Praggnanandhaa, and Arjun - are products of the Westbridge Anand Chess Academy (WACA), an initiative spearheaded by Anand himself to nurture young talent.The rapid rise of these young players is particularly noteworthy. Gukesh, at just 18 years old, remained undefeated throughout the Olympiad and even scored a victory against Fabiano Caruana, a former world championship contender. Arjun Erigaisi's ascent to the world's top three players, behind only Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura, further underscores the depth of talent in the Indian team.This success story is even more impressive considering the challenges posed by the global pandemic in recent years. Despite the disruptions, these young prodigies have not only continued their development but have surpassed expectations, with some now boasting higher ratings than Anand himself.The women's team's performance was equally stellar, with 18-year-old Divya Deshmukh emerging as a standout player. Her unbeaten run and crucial victory in the final match earned her an individual gold medal on board three, highlighting the bright future of women's chess in India.The Olympiad itself was a monumental event, featuring a record-breaking 193 teams in the Open section and 181 in the Women's competition. This level of participation underscores the global appeal of chess and the prestige associated with the Olympiad.While India's triumph was the headline story, the battle for silver and bronze medals in both sections was fiercely contested. In the Open category, five teams tied for second place with 17 points, with the USA and Uzbekistan ultimately securing silver and bronze respectively after tiebreaks. The women's section saw Kazakhstan claim silver, while Team USA edged out Spain, Armenia, and Georgia for bronze in another tight contest.This double gold medal performance represents a significant improvement from India's bronze medals in both sections at the 2022 Olympiad held in Mamallapuram, Chennai. The progression from bronze to gold in just two years reflects the rapid development and growing confidence of Indian chess.Looking ahead, the chess community in India and beyond is now eagerly anticipating the World Chess Championship later this year, where Gukesh will have the opportunity to compete against China’s Ding Liren for the world title. A victory there would cap off an extraordinary year for Indian chess and potentially usher in a new era of dominance.The success of the Indian teams at the 2024 Chess Olympiad is not just a triumph of individual talent but a testament to the country's systematic approach to nurturing chess excellence. From grassroots development to high-performance training academies, India has created a robust ecosystem that is now bearing fruit on the global stage. As the chess world looks on, it's clear that India's ascendancy in the sport is no fleeting phenomenon but the dawn of a new chess superpower.(The writer is a Mumbai based tech entrepreneur and an avid chess enthusiast)","Team India has achieved an unprecedented double gold at the 2024 Chess Olympiad in Budapest, Hungary.

Bazball has unlocked talent of current players

Next generation of England players growing up with big T20 diet

NEW DELHI: Even if Joe Root is unable to surpass Sachin Tendulkar 's incredible record of 15,921 runs, he will be remembered as England 's greatest batsman in Test cricket , according to his former teammate Ian Bell Recently, Root surpassed the legendary Kumar Sangakkara of Sri Lanka to take sixth place on the list of the top run scorers in the longest format.""He's played incredibly well in the last 12 months.I don't think he's overthinking too much what's ahead. He's just sort of living in the moment as we are,"" Bell told PTI in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of Legends League Cricket in Jodhpur.""To think that he can even get close to someone like Sachin, a real great of the game, someone that we've all admired growing up, as a hero to not just people and fans in India, but around the world.""To think that Joe could get close is an amazing achievement on his behalf. He'll go down as England's greatest batsman. There's no doubt whether he does get to Sachin or not,"" said the 42-year-old who played as many as 118 Tests for England.The 33-year-old Root is 3,519 runs short of breaking Tendulkar's record with 12,402 runs.Bell believes that the much-discussed Bazball method in England has awakened the brilliance of the present players.""From a fan point of view, you have to look at the results. Since Brendon (McCullum) has come into this England side and (Ben) Stokes has took over, the results have been absolutely fantastic.""What they've managed to do with the talent that they have is to unlock some of that.... Zak Crawley 's, Ollie Pope, Harry Brook, they've managed to get the best out of them.""I don't think you could ask a Crawley or Pope to try and be an Alastair Cook or a Jonathan Trott who played in a different style, but were very successful. It's important to identify what they've got and they're adapting that as we go on now.""Bell stated that in the upcoming cycle, winning away will be just as crucial as winning at home, given that England was not a contender for the World Test Championship final in the first two editions.""I'm sure they've got one eye on the next 12 months, which has five Test matches (against) India at home, which will be a huge challenge,"" he said.""India are probably the best team in the world at the moment, and then, Australia away. Those 10 Test matches on the road will be hugely important for that group of players and something they're gearing themselves up for.""We were the last team to win in India, which was obviously (a) part of the journey to get to No 1 and we won in Australia. For this England side to get to No 1, there's no doubt, ability and talent-wise, they have that,"" he said.He also focused on consistency demonstrated by the Indian squad which has won 17 series in a row at home and its last two series in Australia.""That's what we've seen with India at the moment. They've managed to be able to win away from home as much as anyone and that's the reason why they are the No 1 team in the world at the moment.""Bell concurred, but one could counter that England's white-ball revolution has also resulted in players' Test batting averages falling, with the exception of Root.""You could definitely have that argument. The next generation of players are growing up with a big diet of T20 cricket in early age and have a look at cricket in England at the moment, there's a lot of short format cricket in the early age group,"" he said.Bell, who is renowned for his entertaining cover drives, believes that Virat Kohli outperforms his competitors in his favorite shot.""It's very hard to look past Virat Kohli, that is for sure. Not just his cover drive, but the way he plays, his desire for batting, his desire actually in competition and how he goes about his cricket.""When he plays his cover drive, whatever format of the game, it's a good one to watch. You know, my kids who love cricket, I certainly get them watching as much cricket from Virat Kohli as possible,"" he said.Bell stated that with James Anderson and Stuart Broad 's retirement, players like Gus Atkinson and Matthew Potts have enormous shoes to fill.""It's very difficult for any players to come in and emulate straight away what Broad-Anderson have done for England for such a long time,"" he said.""It's probably very similar to when (Shane) Warne and (Glenn) McGrath finished at the same time for Australia. It took a little bit of time for Australia to adapt and adjust.""It's unfair for anyone who's to follow in those shoes to be seen in the same way. Hopefully people don't get too hard on them too much,"" he added.","Ian Bell says Joe Root will be remembered as England's greatest batsman in Test cricket.

A Classy Root Hundred & Willey Fireworks! | Classic ODI | Eng v India 2018 | Lord's

NEW DELHI: Whenever India competes in any international match, there's always excitement and enthusiasm among players and fans. Cricketers put their bodies on the line to save every run or take an extra single. Whether it’s facing a yorker delivery above 140 km/h or pulling a short ball in front of their eyes, cricketers tend to give their best for their country when wearing their national colours.Since Virat Kohli took on the role of captaincy, he introduced a new culture in the Test team.The team no longer wanted to play for a draw; the focus was always on winning the match. This mindset was strongly supported by Ravi Shastri , the head coach at the time. However, in one particular match, this approach was not seen in a moment when MS Dhoni scored his 10,000th ODI run.It was the second ODI match of India tour of England in 2018. England batted first, Joe Root scored a century and led the team total to 322/7.At Lord's , one of the most iconic grounds and the home of English cricket, MS Dhoni reached this significant milestone. The moment was met with a muted response, even from his own team's dressing room, which seemed unusually sombre.When Dhoni arrived at the crease following Virat Kohli's wicket, India needed 183 runs from 23 overs, with the required run rate just shy of eight per over. However, during Dhoni's 20-over stay at the crease, which ended with his dismissal for 37 off 59 balls, India only managed to add 75 runs, resulting in the required rate nearly doubling.India struggled to score more than 10 runs in a single over during the last 15 overs, with overs 40 to 50 yielding a paltry 42 runs. Furthermore, it was the first time since the2011 World Cup semi-final that India failed to hit a six in an ODI match.Shortly after, Dhoni faced boos as India's run rate nearly ground to a halt in the final 10 overs, following the collapse of the chase for 323 runs.This incident left the head coach enraged, as it did not align with the team culture he aimed to cultivate.As per the autobiography of former fielding coach R Sridhar, titled 'Coaching Beyond: My Days with the Indian Cricket Team,' Shastri was furious with Dhoni's approach after his lackluster performance during the chase.The coach's frustration stemmed not so much from the defeat or the margin, but rather from his clear stance that Dhoni needed to accelerate the innings in response to the situation at hand.Sridhar wrote, “Uncharacteristically, he (Dhoni) shut shop, and even though our required rate in the last 10 was nearly 13 an over, we only managed some 20 runs in the next six overs. That was the innings when MS got to 10,000 ODI runs , a very significant milestone. We were all thrilled for him, but we also wanted to know why he hadn’t made even a token attempt at the target.”Ravi Shastri expressed his frustration during the team meeting ahead of the decisive final ODI. Though he did not name anyone, his words were directed at a senior batter as he maintained eye contact throughout and warned, “No matter who you may be, there should not be another occasion when we lose a match not trying to win it. It will not happen under my watch. And if anyone does it, that will be the last bloody game of cricket they will play under my watch. You can lose a cricket game, no shame in that, but you will not lose like this,” Shastri further added.In reply, Dhoni, doing justice to his reputation, remained calm and digested all. Sridhar explained in detail, “MS was sitting right there in the front, and while Ravi’s words were meant for the team, his eyes were trained on MS. To the former skipper’s great credit, he didn’t flinch, he never broke eye contact with Ravi. He didn’t look here and there or fidget because one of his many admirable qualities is his ability to take the knocks, especially when he knows in his heart of hearts that he deserves them.”","MS Dhoni faced boos as India's run rate nearly ground to a halt in the final 10 overs, following the collapse of the chase for 323 runs.

""Being a head, he (Naqvi) has to support, which is a good thing.""Par mai isse saazishi-tola bolunga (but I will call this a colluding group), be it the PCB establishment.""He also slammed the team for its embarrassing Test series whitewash at home against Bangladesh, who not only registered their first ever Test win over Pakistan but also went on to sweep the two-match series 2-0.""Mai to saaf bolta hu.

However, he will be fired after that. I am saying this now that it will be tata, bye bye for him...He has also become a part of the politics of Pakistani cricket.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli and James Anderson stand out as two prominent figures in modern cricket. Virat Kohli has faced some of the best bowlers, such as Lasith Malinga Mitchell Johnson , Brett Lee, and Muttiah Muralitharan. He has achieved significant milestones, including scoring 50 ODI centuries.James Anderson, a cricket veteran of two decades, has taken on batters like Sachin Tendulkar Ricky Ponting , and Shubman Gill . He has set a record as the first fast bowler to take over 700 wickets.Kohli and Anderson's achievements highlight their impact and skills in cricket spanning several years.Virat Kohli and James Anderson, two of cricket’s leading figures, have a rivalry that has captivated fans worldwide. Kohli, known for his consistent run-scoring ability, and Anderson, renowned for his wicket-taking skills, bring their best whenever they face off.Their first notable encounter took place during Kohli’s inaugural tour of England in 2012. Anderson managed to dismiss Kohli four times, leading to a challenging series for the Indian batsman. However, Kohli has since improved his performance and achieved an average of 43.57, scoring 305 runs in 36 innings against Anderson in Test matches.As Anderson's career, spanning nearly two decades, approached its conclusion, their rivalry matured into a respectful competition. Kohli commented on their relationship, stating there is ""no bad blood"".In an interview on Star Sports, Kohli shared an interesting encounter between the two. He said, ""We were playing a Test match in Southampton, and James Anderson was bowling.""Kohli explained that the rivalry was over, saying, ""He became a bit pleasant, and I became fine. Now it’s done. It’s a nice competition now, there is no bad blood (woh mutually hojata hai).""Kohli then told Anderson in the Southampton Test, ""When I was very young and when you made your debut, I used to be in my cricket academy practising, and I used to copy your bowling action.""Kohli was fascinated by Anderson's bowling action as a young player. Anderson laughed and asked Kohli 'if he was joking'.In an interesting turn of events in cricket, a young Virat Kohli, who once could imitate James Anderson’s fast bowling action during his time at a cricket academy, later faced Anderson in some of the sport's most intense batting and bowling competitions.Kohli's career highlights how passion and dedication can transform youthful admiration into competitive excellence in sports.James Anderson, who recently retired from cricket at the age of 41, is still passionate about the game. He is considering playing in franchise cricket.

JODHPUR: Bangladesh selector and former player Abdur Razzak on Wednesday said the selection committee will give veteran all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan enough time to decide when he wants to call time on his international career.The 37-year-old Shakib, considered one of the greatest all-rounders to come out of Bangladesh, has struggled for form and fitness of late and didn't make much of an impact during the opening Test against India in Chennai.""Someone is waiting to take his place. Definitely, there are some players, but I would say that it is Shakib's call,"" Razzak told PTI in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of the Legends League Cricket here.""Whenever he feels he (has played) enough, we will welcome him. (But there is) nothing much to say (right now), because a player like him, he was (in the) last 15 years (the) No. 1 all-rounder in the world, so I can't say that he is not good anymore so we don't want him,"" he said.""We always want him, but at the same time, you have to leave at some stage. So, we are waiting for Shakib's decision (and) I am sure he will take the right decision,"" Razzak added.Razzak, who played 13 Tests, 153 ODIs and 34 T20Is for Bangladesh from 2004 till 2014, said there cannot be instant solutions to the void, which will be created by the exit of Shakib and batting mainstay Mushfiqur Rahim ""Shakib (and) Mushfiq, you can't get players like them instantly. As soon as they leave cricket, you can't get them (replaced) because Shakib took 20 years to reach his place, Mushfiq took similar (number of years),"" he said.""It is very difficult to get similar player instantly, but there are some youngsters, they can do well... like Litton Das can do well, (Najmul Hossain) Shanto is there, and there are so many U-19 boys, they are knocking at the door.""We are also really excited to see them, there are some good and capable players, but it is very difficult to instantly replace the two,"" he said.""We need to give some young players a bit more time and hope they will cope up very soon,"" he added.The Bangladesh selector also warned about the threat posed by the proliferation of shorter format leagues, which have grabbed the attention of the younger generation in his country.""It is happening all over the world, I know it is not a good thing, because if you find some Test players, they need to be calm, but most of the young boys are really crazy about T20,"" he said.""Because whenever they turn on the TV, there is some T20 game (going on) and most of the games are so exciting and competitive.""It is very important (and) we need to work on that, we need to encourage some young players to play with the red ball, and if we can manage to make them play all three formats, that would be a great thing for us,"" he said.Razzak said Bangladesh would look to put behind the loss in the opening Test against India in Chennai and hoped for a better show in the second Test starting in Kanpur on September 27.""We didn't play that well against India. But you know, India, in my opinion, is the No 1 Test team at the moment. They have the bowling strength, batting strength and fielding as well,"" he said.Recalling his team's historic win against Pakistan recently, Razzak hoped that his side will be able to draw some inspiration from that series.""(If) we could play a bit more like that, what we have done... we are not looking back, that is past, that is gone, we are looking forward to the next Test match and I would say that (the) Pakistan win will change our cricket, definitely,"" he said.Razzak said the focus of the Bangladesh team is to do well in the next two ICC events - the Champions Trophy next year and the T20 World Cup in 2026.""Every team has that target to play well in ICC tournament. Bangladesh also has that plan. We are now focusing on the 2026 T20 World Cup and the Champions Trophy next year in February,"" he said.","Abdur Razzak says Bangladesh will give veteran all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan enough time to decide when he wants to call time on his international career.

This dismissal marked a recurring pattern for Kohli, as it was the 18th instance since 2021 where he fell victim to spin bowlers.Kohli faced challenges during Wednesday's practice session in Kanpur.While attempting to play inside-out shots against Ravindra Jadeja , he missed the ball three consecutive times, visibly frustrated with his performance, The Indian Express reported.However, the most striking moment occurred when Axar Patel managed to clean bowl the master batsman through the gate.Kohli has experienced a notable decline in his Test ranking, dropping five spots and falling out of the top 10.

Mohit Sharma opens up on his comeback, chilling with MSD, Hardik's Captaincy, 2023 Death Over & more

NEW DELHI: MS Dhoni , known for his ability to stay calm under pressure, rarely lets his emotions get the better of him. However, during the IPL 2019 season, fans witnessed a rare moment when Dhoni’s composed demeanour cracked.In a match between Chennai Super Kings CSK ) and Rajasthan Royals (RR), Dhoni lost his temper over a controversial no-ball call, leading to a breach of the IPL Code of Conduct .Former CSK teammate and current Gujarat Titans pacer Mohit Sharma recently opened up about this unusual incident on the ""2 Sloggers"" podcast.Recalling the event, Mohit shared how Dhoni, after getting out, was already furious and sitting in the dugout when the drama unfolded.In the final over of the match, Ben Stokes bowled a high full toss to Mitchell Santner, which appeared to be a no-ball. The umpire at square leg initially raised his arm to signal it, but quickly retracted the call, deciding it wasn’t a no-ball.This reversal of decision enraged Dhoni, who stormed onto the field to confront the umpires. ""We were in the dugout, shouting, 'Don't go, don't go.' But he didn’t even look back. The way he walked onto the field, (laga ki bhai sher ghus gaya hai) it felt like a lion had entered the arena,"" Mohit recalled.Despite his teammates' efforts to hold him back, Dhoni's frustration got the best of him as he fiercely contested the call.""He had just got out and was already furious. He wanted to be in there because generally, he doesn't leave it to others. He came, sat and all of a sudden, the incident happened. He asked, 'Did he (the umpire) give it a no-ball?'

JODHPUR: Former India opener Shikhar Dhawan on Wednesday revealed that he didn't have the ""inspiration"" left to take the domestic cricket route for a place in the national side and that was the reason why he chose to retire from the game last month. The 38-year-old Dhawan retired from international and domestic cricket late in August after having played 34 Tests, 167 ODIs and 68 T20Is for India between 2013 and 2022.""I didn't want to play domestic cricket, which I started playing at the age of 18 or 19 and I didn't have that inspiration from inside to play that (form of) cricket,"" Dhawan told PTI in an interview on the sidelines of the Legends League Cricket, an event for retired cricketers that he signed up for after calling it quits from the game internationally.Dhawan became India's 25th ODI skipper in an ODI against Sri Lanka in June 2021 when he stood in for Rohit Sharma and went on to lead the country in 12 matches, winning seven and losing three.However, before the ODI World Cup last year, Dhawan had to make way for a younger batter in Shubman Gill. His last international appearance for India was in December 2022.""If I look back, the last two years of my cricketing career, I wasn't playing much of international cricket and I was playing IPL to IPL, so I wasn't playing much of cricket (overall),"" said the big-hitting opener.He left the arena as a bonafide IPL legend, after appearing in 222 matches, that yielded 6769 runs, including two hundreds and 51 half centuries.His 768 fours in the tournament are the highest by any batter and he also holds the distinction of being the first to hit consecutive hundreds in the event.""I thought that, 'alright, I've played enough, and I need to give it a break because I'm not playing that much cricket, so you lose the touch as well,"" he said as he opened about his mindset before announcing the big decision.Dhawan, who captained Punjab Kings in a few games last year, said he also realised that practising two-three months for the IPL would not be enough for him to be in contention for a national call-up.""I thought that continuing IPL and just coming up with two, three months of hard work won't be enough for me to go and play,"" he said.Dhawan, who had a terrific average of 65.15 -- highest among all Indian batters ever in ICC limited-overs events -- reiterated that he was content with the way his journey ended.""So that was the reason for me to just call it off, and yeah, I was very happy and satisfied and content with whatever I achieved in my career, and very, very grateful for everything,"" he said.""Of course, we would have loved to win the World Cup,"" said Dhawan, who played in the 2015 and 2019 iterations of the ODI World Cup and was also a member of India's title-winning side in the 2013 Champions Trophy.The former India opener Dhawan stands eighth in the overall list of highest partnership runs in career for any wicket with India captain Rohit Sharma, having added 5,193 runs at 45.15 in 117 matches with 18 century and 15 half-centuries stands.Dhawan said he was pleased to see Rohit's career hitting further highs, the highlight being India's T20 World Cup win under his leadership.""He's a great captain, and so happy that he led the team and won the World Cup for our nation. We were waiting for that World Cup for a long time. We were very close in (winning) the ODI World Cup as well, and now we achieved that goal in T20Is,"" Dhawan said.""He's a very experienced captain, and I'm sure all the boys love him as a leader and he has done a phenomenal job for the Indian team,"" he added.","Former India opener Shikhar Dhawan says he didn't have the ""inspiration"" left to play domestic cricket.

'Even a mohalla team is better than them': Danish Kaneria blasts Pakistan after shocking Test series loss to Bangladesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/even-a-mohalla-team-is-better-than-them-danish-kaneria-blasts-pakistan-after-shocking-test-series-loss-to-bangladesh/articleshow/113670781.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria didn't hold back in his scathing criticism of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and the Pakistan team following their humiliating Test series loss to Bangladesh. It was Pakistan's first-ever Test series defeat to Bangladesh and Kaneria expressed his frustration, even going so far as to say that ""a mohalla team is better than them.""The two-match series saw Bangladesh dominate the first Test with a resounding 10-wicket victory.Bangladesh then chased down 185 runs in the second Test with six wickets in hand, marking the third-highest successful run chase by a visiting team on Pakistani soil. The loss has raised serious concerns about the direction of the team under Babar Azam 's leadership.In an interview with IANS, Kaneria didn't mince words while talking about the Pakistan team's recent performance against Bangladesh.""The level of the Pakistan cricket team is so low that even a mohalla team is better than them, and all this is because of the PCB. They are to be blamed for such a below-par show from the national side. The luxuries of the captain's 'kursi' (chair) and the chairmanship at the PCB spoil minds,"" he said, highlighting the disconnect between the leadership and the performance on the field.Kaneria, also pointed out what he sees as a flawed decision by the PCB in replacing former captain Sarfaraz Ahmed with Babar Azam. Sarfaraz, who led Pakistan to victory in the ICC Champions Trophy in 2017, had been performing well across formats, but Kaneria believes the current leadership cannot handle pressure situations.""I don't know why Babar Azam was given the leadership responsibility despite Sarfaraz Ahmed's good captaincy. Currently, there is no captain material in the Pakistan team. A captain is someone who takes the pressure on his shoulders and carries the team forward with his performance, which both Babar and Shan Masood have failed to do,"" Kaneria lamented. ""Can't they have scored one century against Bangladesh in their home conditions?""Kaneria also drew a comparison between Pakistan and their arch-rivals, India, emphasising that Indian players have consistently stepped up to the plate when required, creating a world-class team.""When you look at the current Indian team, everyone takes responsibility and performs when it is needed. Shubman (Gill), Rishabh (Pant), (Ravichandran) Ashwin — everyone contributes, and that is why they are a world-class team,"" he added.As someone who has closely observed the evolution of Indian cricket, Kaneria had high praise for Rishabh Pant , India's dynamic wicketkeeper-batter. Despite Pant's recent injury struggles, Kaneria suggested that he could be a future leader for India, especially in Test cricket.""Rishabh Pant can lead India in Tests in the future. He has that caliber. He is performing very well after his injury comeback, and being a wicketkeeper, he keeps himself engaged with the bowlers and fielders always. Indian cricket is going great guns,"" Kaneria said.","Former Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria criticises Pakistan Cricket Board.

Nkunku then added a second goal. Felix's free-kick hit the post and rebounded off Barrow’s goalkeeper Paul Farman for an own goal.

KOLKATA: “Sometimes, football is unfair,” were the very first words of NorthEast United FC head coach Juan Pedro Benali as he began addressing the media after their 3-2 loss to Mohun Bagan Super Giants in Kolkata on Monday.While there was no dearth of appreciation from the NorthEast United fans at the Salt Lake Stadium, or those following it from elsewhere, for the show put up by their players despite the defeat to their glorified opponents, it was the second goal by Mohun Bagan captain Subhasish Bose that dominated the chatter on social media.With the score reading 2-1 in the visitors’ favour, it was a fumble from NEUFC custodian Gurmeet Singh in collecting a header by Tom Aldred in the 61st minute that helped Bose in putting the ball into the net and giving the hosts the crucial equaliser.Replays showed the Bagan skipper’s shoes stamping on Gurmeet’s left arm to get the ball in even as the goalkeeper was still holding the ball, albeit unconvincingly, leading some critics and NEUFC coach to feel that the goal needed to be disallowed.“You only need to see the arm of the goalkeeper, Gurmeet, in blood. That’s enough!” Benali said at the press conference on Monday. “You can play against 11 players but not against the elements. And sometimes it’s the small details that are the game changers.”While Bose’s equaliser dominated most of the interaction, Benali was also quick to acknowledge his team’s efforts on the field that made the Shield winners work hard for their first win of the season.“But I am really happy and proud of my players because they showed that we are growing. We made silly mistakes, but we are growing. We went head-to-head against Mohun Bagan in this stadium and with a crowd like this,” said the Spaniard.Last season’s top scorer for the Highlanders, Mohammed Ali Bemammer and star of their Durand Cup final against the same opponents, Alaeddine Ajaraie, were both on the scoresheet on Monday as the likes of Jithin MS kept the expensive Bagan defence on their toes. And the Michel Zabaco-led NEUFC will be eager to get the full points and their second win of season when they play their season’s first home game against Kerala Blasters next week.For now, Benali, who believes ‘the fair result would be a 2-2 draw’, is ready to move on in quest for a memorable season.“Today, we feel our scratches from the previous game and tomorrow we’ll start thinking about Kerala,” said Benali while signing off by reiterating, “Football is unfair and today (Monday) it was unfair on the NorthEast.”",NorthEast United FC lost 3-2 to Mohun Bagan Super Giants in Kolkata on Monday.

CHENNAI: At an age when many players think of retiring from professional tennis, Vijay Sundar Prashanth has secured his biggest title at the ATP level. The 37-year-old Vijay Sundar and Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan , both from Tamil Nadu , won their maiden ATP Tour crown as a pair by overcoming Germany's Constantin Frantzen and Hendrik Jebens 4-6, 7-6(5), 10-7 in the Hangzhou Open summit clash on Tuesday.""I cannot explain in words how I am feeling. We did not expect to win the tournament as we headed into it after taking breaks. Jeevan got married a few days ago and I took a week's rest. We believed in ourselves and that showed on the court,"" Vijay Sundar told TOI from Hangzhou.After dropping the first set, the Indian duo rallied to win the encounter in super tiebreak. En route the title, the Indian duo registered two upset victories; defeating second seeds Lloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash in the quarterfinals and the third-seeded pairing of Robert Galloway and Ariel Behar in the last-four stage. The title victory in Hangzhou will take Jeevan into the top-90 in the world rankings, while Vijay Sundar will move closer to the top-100 mark.Vijay Sundar, who tasted success in the ATP Challenger-level events last year with Anirudh Chandrasekar, joined hands with the experienced Jeevan in May.""We (Jeevan and I) have known each other for the last 25 years and grew up playing the sport together.

Still, they kept believing in themselves and their work behind the scenes has done the trick.""When we joined hands, we knew that this was going to be a long partnership. Although we lost a few close matches early, it did not bother us much as we knew that wins were not far away. We did not put pressure on us and waited for the right moment.""The next goal for the Indian pair will be to carry forward the momentum and book a place at the Australian Open next year. Vijay made his Grand Slam debut in Australia earlier this year by partnering Anirudh, while Jeevan could not make it to any of the majors this year. ""We will relax till Sunday and then play in a Challenger competition next week. We will head to Europe after that as we have registered for three ATP 250 tournaments.
