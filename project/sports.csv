NEW DELHI: Team India is set to begin their Super Eights campaign in the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup against Afghanistan at the Kensington Oval on Thursday. This follows an undefeated run in the Group A matches in the USA, despite challenging batting conditions in New York.Team India showcased a strong performance in the Group A matches, overcoming the tough batting conditions encountered in New York. Their consistent play has earned them a pivotal position as they proceed to the Super Eights.The upcoming match against Afghanistan, known for causing upsets, will be held at the Kensington Oval in the Caribbean. This marks another critical step for Team India as they aim to continue their winning streak in the tournament.The change in venue will necessitate adjustments to India's team composition, particularly considering the inclusion of four spinners in their World Cup squad. The fast-bowling friendly conditions in New York limited opportunities for players like Kuldeep Yadav in the Group A games.With the tournament now moving to the West Indies, India may consider including an additional spinner, such as Kuldeep Yadav, who offers a different skill set and control compared to Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel. If this change is implemented, Mohammed Siraj could potentially make way, especially given the value of Arshdeep Singh's left-arm variety in challenging Afghanistan's batters alongside the in-form Jasprit Bumrah.Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli have the opportunity to bat freely during the power-play, and if the situation demands, they can adopt an ultra-attacking approach, provided left-arm fast-bowler Fazalhaq Farooqi, the tournament's leading wicket-taker, doesn't exploit the moving ball. Rishabh Pant, Suryakumar Yadav, Shivam Dube, and Hardik Pandya possess the hard-hitting ability to be match-winners when the situation calls for it.Meanwhile, Afghanistan is experiencing another remarkable run in a white-ball tournament, having defeated England, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and the Netherlands in last year's ODI World Cup. This year, they have demonstrated consistency and all-round performances, leveraging their experience from playing in the Caribbean Premier League.Thursday's match against India will be Afghanistan's first day fixture in the World Cup, presenting a new set of challenges for the Rashid Khan-led side. After dominating victories over New Zealand, Uganda, and Papua New Guinea, Afghanistan suffered a 104-run defeat against co-hosts West Indies.Farooqi, who has claimed 12 wickets in the tournament, will be relied upon by Afghanistan to take early wickets in the power-play alongside Naveen-ul-Haq. Rashid, Mohammed Nabi, and Noor Ahmad will be tasked with maintaining control in the middle overs through their spin bowling.In the batting department, in-form openers Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran are crucial, along with Gulbadin Naib, followed by Nabi and Rashid. They will be hoping for contributions from Azmatullah Omarzai and Karim Janat as well.Coincidentally, Afghanistan's first-ever T20 World Cup game was against India in the Caribbean on May 1, 2010. Fourteen years later, in the same setting, the two teams will meet again, this time in the Super Eights, with every result having significant implications for their semifinal chances, starting from Thursday.The highly anticipated third match of the Super Eights in the T20 World Cup 2024 will feature a clash between India (IND) and Afghanistan (AFG). Scheduled for June 20 at 8:00 PM IST, the game will take place at the renowned Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, West Indies.In their previous T20I meetings, India has had the upper hand, emerging victorious in seven out of eight encounters. One match between the two sides ended without a conclusive result.The pitch at Kensington Oval has been one of the better surfaces in the tournament, offering a balanced contest between bat and ball. Both batters and bowlers have found something to work with here. The Kensington Oval pitch is expected to provide a fair challenge for both teams, allowing batters to score runs while also giving bowlers a chance to make an impact.The pitch in this tournament has shown no clear advantage for teams batting first or second. Both sides have emerged victorious in two matches each, with one match ending in a super over and another yielding no result due to external factors. When batting first, teams have scored an average of 157 runs, whereas when chasing, the average score has been 139.The highest total recorded at this venue was Australia's impressive 201/7 against England. On the other end of the spectrum, Oman's 109/10 against Namibia remains the lowest score posted on this ground.Top-order batsmen and spinners are expected to be key performers on this pitch.Rohit Sharma from India, despite a slow start in the tournament, could be a game-changer, given his ability to score big.Arshdeep Singh, also from India, has been impressive with seven wickets in three matches, particularly effective with the new ball.Rahmanullah Gurbaz of Afghanistan has been in top form, with 167 runs in four matches, and will play a vital role in his team's batting lineup, making him a strong fantasy pick.Rohit Sharma (c), Hardik Pandya (vc), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant (wk), Sanju Samson (wk), Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj.Rashid Khan (c), Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Ibrahim Zadran, Azmatullah Omarzai, Najibullah Zadran, Naveen-ul-Haq, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Mohammad Nabi, Gulbadin Naib, Karim Janat, Mohammad Ishaq, Nangyal Kharoti, Hazratullah Zazai, Noor Ahmad, and Fareed Ahmad Malik.Wicketkeepers: Rishabh Pant, Rahmanullah GurbazBatters: Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar YadavAll-rounders: Ravindra Jadeja, Azmatullah OmarzaiBowlers: Jasprit Bumrah, Kuldeep Yadav, Rashid Khan, Arshdeep Singh, Noor Ahmad","Team India set to begin their Super Eights campaign in the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup against Afghanistan on Thursday.

Virat Kohli is itching to rediscover his batting touch as India refocus at the T20 World Cup with their first match of the ' Super 8s ' against Afghanistan in Barbados on Thursday.Opening the batting with skipper Rohit Sharma , Kohli hasn't had the kind of start his fans expected of him at the T20 World Cup, with his three innings totaling a mere 5 runs in 9 balls.Kohli's knocks of 1, 4 and 0 have also raised questions whether asking him to open is a correct move. However, playing in the same position for Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Kohli scored a tournament-highest 741 runs in the 2024 season of the Indian Premier League just before the T20 World Cup.Facing up to the tricky Afghanistan at the Kensington Oval on Thursday, Kohli and Rohit will be up against a challenge that former South Africa speedsterDale Steyn sees as a big danger for the Indian openers""Be careful Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma; he can knock your pegs up,"" said Steyn in a Star Sports video, talking about the in-form Afghan pacer Fazalhaq Farooqi.The left-arm fast bowler has invariably tore into opposition's top order in this tournament, and his wicket-taking consistency has put him on top of the bowling charts with 12 wickets in four matches, including a best of 5 for 9. Farooqui's economy rate of 5.58 is as impressive as his wickets tally.Among the Afghan batters, Steyn felt opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz can get stuck into the Indian pacers, which makes his duel with Jasprit Bumrah as the one to watch out for.Interestingly, while Steyn alerted Kohli and Rohit to the danger posed by Farooqi, the South African didn't pick either of the two openers as the Indian batsman to watch out for in the contest.""Starting with India, from a bowling point of view, Jasprit Bumrah. Absolutely phenomenal! He's great with all three disciplines - Tests, T20s, ODIs,"" said Steyn.Talking about Indian batting, Steyn said, ""SKY (Suryakumar Yadav) is gonna come good with the bat. Just watch out for him from India's point of view.""India and Afghanistan are placed in Group 1 of the 'Super 8s' stage alongside Australia and Bangladesh.",Virat Kohli has scored just 5 runs in three innings at the T20 World Cup. Former South Africa fast bowler Dale Steyn has warned the Indian openers to be careful of Afghan pacer Fazalhaq Farooqi. Steyn picked Jasprit Bumrah as the one to watch out for in the contest.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111130453,imgsize-194682,width-400,resizemode-4/111130453.jpg"

Are the Hardy Boyz returning to WWE for one last run?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/are-the-hardy-boyz-returning-to-wwe-for-one-last-run/articleshow/111147352.cms,"Here's everything you need to know about

Matt Hardy

's views on their comeback

The Hardy Boyz have consistently been at the pinnacle of WWE, reigning supreme during their prime. Alongside Edge , Christian , and The Dudley Boyz, they revolutionized the Tag Team division. Whether it was hardcore wrestling with extreme moments or intense championship matches, The Hardy Boyz always gave their all. Now, according to some sources, Matt and Jeff Hardy are planning a return to WWE for one final run. Read on to discover The Hardy Boyz's thoughts on their WWE comeback.Matt Hardy returned to TNA at the Rebellion pay-per-view after his AEW contract expired, and he has been featured on TNA television since. Similarly, Jeff Hardy made his return to TNA at Against All Odds. With both Hardys back in the company, Matt Hardy has now commented on the possibility of the duo having one last run in WWE.In an interview on Busted Open Radio, Matt Hardy shared his hopes for a successful stint in TNA Wrestling, followed by a brief return to WWE with Jeff Hardy before their eventual induction into the Hall of Fame. He said,""I would like to do TNA and have a hell of a run there, and then I almost feel like now, just the destiny has revealed itself in many ways, I almost feel Jeff and I, we end up returning to WWE, do something small and then go onto the Hall of Fame. That's a best-case scenario.""When asked what it would take for WWE to trust Jeff Hardy again, Matt Hardy emphasized Jeff's commitment to rebuilding trust by returning to TNA and demonstrating his growth and reliability. Matt also mentioned the collaboration between TNA and WWE, highlighting Jeff's aim to showcase his transformation through a successful tenure at TNA.Regarding Jeff Hardy, Matt Hardy said, ""That's a great question. I think Jeff really wanted to come back to TNA to continue to build equity, and he knows that TNA and WWE are working together. I have friends in WWE, I have spoken with people in WWE. So I think Jeff just wants to once again show people how he is a different human being. The way to put equity into that is to go to TNA, have a kickass run, and show people he's on his best behavior.""The return of The Hardy Boyz to WWE also makes sense given the ongoing relationship between WWE and TNA. This partnership could eventually lead to TNA superstars, including the Hardy Boyz, appearing in WWE. Recently, fans saw the first evidence of this relationship during WWE NXT. Joe Hendry made a surprise appearance in the number one contender battle royal match for the NXT Championship.However, Hendry was quickly eliminated by fellow TNA star Frankie Kazarian. The match also featured WWE main roster stars Dragon Lee, Angel, Berto, Apollo Crews, and Tyler Bate. Je'Von Evans emerged victorious in the battle royal, last eliminating Shawn Spears.

When will Drew McIntyre return to WWE?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/when-will-drew-mcintyre-return-to-wwe/articleshow/111146113.cms,"Here's everything you need to know about the return of The Scottish Warrior

The WWE Universe is stunned and expresses disappointment over Drew McIntyre 's departure. Fans are questioning his whereabouts and speculating on when he might return to WWE. For now, he will be absent from television for a while. During the latest episode of RAW, McIntyre announced his decision to quit and left the arena. Some fans think this is part of a storyline, while others believe it is due to his wife undergoing treatments, prompting the Scottish Warrior to take a temporary leave. But when will he return? Let's explore below.Since WrestleMania 40, Drew McIntyre has been on a losing streak. Although he defeated Seth ""Freakin"" Rollins at WrestleMania 40 and celebrated his victory, he took it too far by taunting CM Punk while standing on the announce table. This outraged CM Punk, who began assaulting Drew. Seizing the opportunity, Damian Priest arrived and cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase against Drew McIntyre for the World Title. Damian performed his finisher on Drew, becoming the new World Heavyweight Champion.Despite his loss, the Scottish Warrior managed to overcome numerous challenges, including a match against Judgment Day member Finn Bálor. He secured an assurance that Judgment Day members would be banned from ringside during his World Title match against Damian Priest at Clash at the Castle. In the main event of Clash at the Castle , Drew and Damian put on a spectacular match, with both competitors giving their all.As the match progressed, Drew was on the verge of victory after delivering a Claymore Kick. However, luck was not on his side. When the referee was incapacitated, CM Punk interfered, taking over as referee. Punk stopped counting at two, which enraged Drew. In his fury, Drew began choking CM Punk, who responded with a low blow. Damian took advantage of the situation, performed his finisher on Drew, and successfully retained the World Title at Clash at the Castle.As we approach Money in the Bank 2024, a match is set between Seth ""Freakin"" Rollins and Damian Priest for the World Title. Damian extended the challenge to Seth, who promptly accepted. There is a high probability that The Scottish Warrior, Drew McIntyre, could interfere in this match. Drew has been a prominent figure in the World Heavyweight Title scene for a long time, often losing the title due to outside interference. Now, it seems his moment has come to strike back and claim what he believes he deserves, potentially causing Damian to retain the title at Money in the Bank 2024.Additionally, Drew McIntyre might make his return before SummerSlam to challenge CM Punk. Fans have long awaited the intense promos and interferences between these two.SummerSlam could be the stage for an epic clash between CM Punk and Drew McIntyre. This may explain why Drew temporarily left WWE; CM Punk has played many mind games with him, and now it's Drew's turn. McIntyre's announced departure could have been a ruse to confuse CM Punk, setting up a surprise return for Drew to exact his revenge.","WWE Universe is stunned and expresses disappointment over Drew McIntyre's departure.

After 95, if someone takes five balls to get to his 100 and his intention changes after scoring 100, why can't he play the same shots he did at 95 or 92 runs? For me, the intent should always remain the same—to add the best possible value to your team's victory.""""So, I felt Virat took too many balls to get to his hundred, and he wasn't playing big shots. If you review his century again, maybe you'll understand what I was saying. Personal milestones should be secondary to the team's success.

His deliveries hit the deck in seaming conditions. He dismissed Babar (Azam) caught in the slips, clean bowled Rizwan (Mohammad) and in the last over dismissed Iftikhar (Ahmed) by a yorker. So there he was bowling different.""""And here (in Barbados) on a slow pitch where there's no help, he took wickets by changing the pace of deliveries.

Ambrose warns about burn-out

Test cricket creates legends

Fast-bowling legend Curtly Ambrose holds Jasprit Bumrah in high regard. Despite the Indian spearhead's history of stress fractures, Ambrose believes that Bumrah's unorthodox action should remain unchanged, mainitaining that all fast bowlers face the risk of injury when they step onto the field.""What I can tell you something about Jasprit Bumrah, I'm a big fan -- ever since I saw him for the first time,"" said Ambrose in an interview with PTI.""He's so unconventional but highly effective, and that's what I like about him. When you look at traditional fast bowlers, you wouldn't look at Bumrah, he's so unorthodox.""At 30 years old, Bumrah possesses the ability to take wickets at any stage of a limited-over match. In Test cricket, he is equally effective with both the new and old ball, particularly when the ball starts to reverse swing.Widely considered the best all-format pacer in the game currently, Bumrah has encountered his share of back issues and underwent surgery in March of the previous year. Following an extensive rehabilitation period, he made his comeback prior to the ODI World Cup in India in November and has been in top form since then.Ambrose emphasized that Bumrah should maintain his current approach and technique, making no alterations to his bowling style.""He has done a great job for India and still doing a great job in all formats. I met him a couple of years ago when India played in Antigua. He's someone I've always enjoyed watching because he's so different,"" said Ambrose, part of promotions for the T20 World Cup being jointly hosted by the US and the West Indies Bumrah's unique bowling action, with his chest open at the point of delivery, can potentially put extra strain on his back. However, Ambrose believes that every pace bowler has to cope with certain risks associated with their craft.""From my little experience, there are no two bowlers who are exactly alike. Bowlers may have similarities but they are never exactly alike and we all have our different styles everyone is different. In terms of his longevity, in terms of injuries, (for) every fast bowler, there is always risk of being injured. But at the same time you can't go out there thinking that wa,"" said the 60-year-old Ambrose.""You've got to go out there and do the job to the best of your ability and whatever happens, happens. The only way he should change is if he, may be, sustains a serious injury or has to re-model his action or something,"" said the legendary pacer, who featured in 98 Tests for the West Indies and took 405 wickets.Ambrose, a towering figure at 6 feet 7 inches, consistently challenged the world's elite batsmen with his ability to generate extra bounce. However, he doesn't attribute the strain on Bumrah's back solely to his bowling action.""I've never been through it (stress fracture). So it would be unfair for me to even try to say what to do. I will leave that for the medical expert. I don't think Bumrah's stress comes totally from his action.""You can look at Ian Bishop, he had a perfect action and he also had stress fracture,"" reasoned the cricketer from Antigua.The global cricket schedule is more packed than it has ever been, with numerous T20 leagues across the globe occupying a significant portion of the calendar. Ambrose recognized the substantial changes the sport has undergone and the detrimental effects of an overloaded itinerary.""The game has become a bit more commercialised. Too much cricket is being played as well. Players are leaving from one series to the next, there is franchise cricket as well. Guys could get burnt out,"" he said.""It's still exciting. There are wonderful players around but too much cricket is being played and that to me would be a bit of a concern.""Ambrose, who hails from Antigua, participated extensively in limited-overs cricket throughout his career. However, he firmly believes that Test cricket is the only format that produces legends.""I've always preferred Test match cricket over anything else. I've played ODIs, I've played four-day cricket, but for me it isn't international cricket. Test match cricket for me is a real cricket.""I believe at the end of a career, if you've been judged, if you want to become a legend, you have to play Test cricket. You would not become a legend playing ODIs or T20s. There is talk about Tests dying, I don't really think so.""...the powers that be, need to do something to make Test match cricket a little more attractive and we're going to be okay. But Test match cricket is not going anywhere,"" he asserted.Ambrose dominated the cricketing world during the 1990s, cherishing his duels with legendary batsmen such as Sachin Tendulkar. If he were playing in the current era, the formidable bowler would have eagerly embraced the challenge of bowling to the contemporary greats of the game like Virat Kohli.""When I played, I thrived on challenges. In every team, there were at least a handful of great batsmen. And you know, with a reputation as well. So for me, they tend to bring the best out of me when I play.""To dismiss them gives me more pleasure than dismissing numbers 9, 10, 11. You talk about these guys, they are great players (Kohli & Co). It would be nice to play against them but having said that, I've played against some greats in my time as well,"" he said.Highlighting the increasing competitiveness of the sport at the international level, Ambrose expressed happiness with the performance of teams like USA and Afghanistan.""Well, prior to the start of the World Cup, I predicted some upsets and so far we've seen a few. So, I am quite happy for that, it makes the tournament more interesting as opposed to all of the big teams just running away,"" he said.",West Indies legend Curtly Ambrose holds Jasprit Bumrah in high regard.

He pointed out what went wrong for the co-hosts in the game.""Can’t afford 51 dot balls on a good batting surface,"" Bishop wrote on X.England captain Jos Buttler 's decision to bowl first after winning the toss quickly proved to be a wise one.Despite a cautious start, Brandon King ignited the crowd with a massive 101-metre six and three boundaries. However, misfortune struck when King, on 23, suffered a side strain and had to retire hurt, leaving the West Indies in a vulnerable state.The responsibility of stabilising the innings fell on the shoulders of Nicholas Pooran and Johnson Charles. Charles began to play more aggressively, but England's bowlers maintained discipline and kept the scoring rate under control.When Charles was dismissed for a well-played 38, Rovman Powell elevated himself in the batting order and provided a much-needed boost with a scintillating cameo. Powell's 36 off just 17 deliveries, which included five massive sixes, three of them off Liam Livingstone, raised hopes of the West Indies reaching an imposing total.England's bowlers, however, mounted a comeback just as the hosts appeared poised to surpass the 200-run mark.Livingstone made amends by removing Powell in the same over, while Jofra Archer dismissed the struggling Pooran, who scored 36 off 32 balls. Adil Rashid then struck a vital blow, luring Andre Russell into a poorly executed shot that resulted in a catch.The West Indies ultimately posted a total of 180, despite a late flourish from Sherfane Rutherford, who contributed a quick-fire 28 from 15 balls.Salt spearheaded England's dominant performance with a blistering knock, amassing runs off just 47 deliveries. His innings featured seven boundaries and five maximums. Bairstow provided valuable support, remaining unbeaten on 48 off a mere 26 balls, including five fours and two sixes.However, the English bowling unit deserves equal praise for their disciplined effort. They collectively delivered an impressive 51 dot balls, with Jofra Archer and Adil Rashid being the standout performers.Archer conceded only 34 runs in his spell, while Rashid was even more economical, giving away just 21 runs. Together, they accounted for 22 of the total dot balls bowled.The convincing victory, achieved with 15 balls to spare, significantly boosted England's net run-rate to 1.343. This impressive performance propelled them to the top of the standings, surpassing South Africa, who had earlier secured a win against co-hosts USA on the same day.West Indies will next take on the United States on Saturday in Barbados, while England will face South Africa on Friday in St Lucia.","West Indies legend Ian Bishop criticises his team for conceding defeat too easily.

Pakistani Legend Wasim Akram on Rishabh Pant : The Greatest Comeback

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketer Wasim Akram commended India's wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant 's remarkable comeback following a severe accident, describing it as an inspiring tale for future generations. He referred to Pant as a 'miracle child,' acknowledging his extraordinary performance on comeback in the Indian Premier League and the T20 World Cup .Akram expressed relief upon seeing Pant's recovery and lauded his batting prowess. The former pace legend conveyed these sentiments in an interview with Sportskeeda, emphasizing the collective concern felt even in Pakistan over Pant's condition after the accident.""Pant ki performance dekh rahe hai. Miracle jo iss ladke ne kiya hai, dikhaya hai ki he is super human. Jis tragedy se woh wapas aaya hai. Jis tarah se uska accident, maine clips dekhe the, we were all worried in Pakistan [The kind of performance Pant is giving after that accident, he is proving he is a super human. We saw the clips and all were worried about him]. I was worried, actually maine tweet bhi kiya tha unke baare me. And he came back and he averaged 40 this year in IPL - 446 runs, strike rate of 155. Woh toh miracle bachcha hai,” Akram said.In the ongoing T20 World Cup, Pant maintains his exceptional form, leading as the top run-scorer for Team India after the group stages, having scored 96 runs in three innings with an average of 48.Akram also praised Pant's Test career achievements, pointing to significant innings against Australia and England.""Jis tarike se usne Test cricket me performance di. Jo Australia me jaake usne 100 kiya. Phir uske baad England ke khilaaf usne batting ki. Test cricket me reverse sweeps, [James] Anderson ko, [Pat] Cummins ko. He is special,"" Akram said.Reflecting on Pant’s resilience and mental strength post-accident, Akram deemed his story a powerful example for young people globally.""And especially what he has been through in that horrific accident. Uske baad comeback karna. Kitna mentally strong yeh ladka hoga. That's a story to be told for generations to generations in my opinion. To motivate young people of the world - ki comeback ho sakta hai, jaise Pant ne kiya,” he added.Akram echoed former India captain Sourav Ganguly 's perception of Pant as a natural and instinctive leader.""I will second Ganguly that Pant ek natural captain hai, instinctive captain he jo mauke par decision karta hai. Woh bada jaruri hai T20 format mai [Agree with Ganguly that Pant is a natural, instinctive captain and took decisions according to the situation, which is very important in T20 cricket],"" Akram said.""Aap T20 format me yeh nahi jaa sakte ki yaar ek raat pahle - do overs yeh karega, do overs yeh karega, do overs yeh karega, na. Aap jaate ho ki pehla over yeh karega and then situation kiya hai. Agar pahle over me ek wicket le liya hai toh usko me dusra bhi kara dunga. Agar nahi toh main kisi aur ko le aaunga. Yeh instinctive captaani hoti hai. Batting order bhi aap pehle se nahi plan kar sakte hai, situation ki mutabiq change karte ho aap. That's where I think Pant is good at,"" Akram elaborated.","Former Pakistan cricketer Wasim Akram commended India's wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant's remarkable comeback following a severe accident.

NEW DELHI: Defending champions England cruised to an eight-wicket win against hosts West Indies in their Super Eights clash of the T20 World Cup at Gros Islet in St Lucia on Thursday.Opener Philip Salt smashed an unbeaten 47-ball 87 as England chased down the 181-run target with 21 balls to spare.Salt was first involved in a 67-run stand with his captain Jos Buttler (25) and then in an unbeaten 97-run partnership with Jonny Bairstow (48*).Salt hit 5 sixes and 7 fours in his knock and a major factor for England cruising to victory was a brutal assault by the England opener in one over off West Indies' pacer Romario Shepherd .The assault came in the 16th over of the run chase when Shepherd came on to bowl his second over having conceded 11 runs in his first over.Salt smashed 4, 6, 4, 6, 6, 4 in the over to heap misery on the Windies and shut out any hopes they were harbouring of a victory.Salt hit the first ball over extra cover for a four to reach his fifty. The second ball was mistimed but such was the power behind the shot that it went all the way straight down the ground for a six.Salt hit the third delivery over the keeper for a four and smacked the fourth delivery over long-off for another six.The carnage continued as the fifth delivery, a slower ball, was dispatched over deep square leg with a pull for another six and the last ball, a juicy full toss was sent sailing over mid-off to complete the 30-run over.It was the West Indies' first loss of the tournament and their first defeat in eight Twenty20 internationals.The West Indies made 180/4 batting first on the same pitch on which they made 218/5 against Afghanistan in the final match of the group stage on Monday.",Philip Salt hits unbeaten 87 as England beat hosts West Indies by eight wickets.

""That's a good way to start the second stage of the tournament.""England, the reigning champions, have faced challenges in finding their rhythm despite advancing to the Super 8 stage. The team, led by Jos Buttler, has yet to showcase their true potential in the tournament.

NEW DELHI: England leads Group C at the European Championship after a 1-0 victory against Serbia, while Denmark and Slovenia ended their match in a 1-1 draw. The two group rivals, England and Denmark, are set to face off on Thursday at the Waldstadion in Frankfurt, with the match starting at 6 p.m. local time (16:00 GMT).Denmark is in dire need of a win, particularly considering their final Group C game against Serbia will be a tough challenge. This encounter brings back memories of their Euro 2020 semifinal, where England triumphed 2-1 in extra time after Harry Kane scored from a rebound off his saved penalty. Despite still being upset about the penalty decision, Denmark's coach Kasper Hjulmand is concentrating on the upcoming match.Both teams have players who are teammates at Manchester United, Crystal Palace, and Brentford, making the squads well-acquainted with each other. Gareth Southgate, England's coach, is in his fourth tournament and is less worried about the style of the win against Serbia, having previously navigated England through group stages with ease.Southgate is considering keeping Trent Alexander-Arnold in central midfield and must make decisions on options such as debutants Kobbie Mainoo and Adam Wharton. With left-back Luke Shaw still unavailable, Kieran Trippier may continue to play on the left side.Denmark has no reported injuries, and captain Simon Kjaer is ready to return to the line up. A draw might be enough for Denmark to stay in contention for a spot in the knockout stage, while another victory for England could see them finish at the top of the group and face a third-place team in the round of 16.It's worth noting that England has never won their first two games in a Euros tournament, and Denmark's Kjaer, who did not play against Slovenia, now has 132 caps, just one more than Christian Eriksen, who scored in the 1-1 draw.The UEFA European Championship 2024 Group C match between England vs Denmark is set for June 20, Thursday.The UEFA Euro 2024 match is scheduled to kick off at 9:30 PM IST on Thursday at Frankfurt in Germany .

For the quadrennial extravaganza, Balaji got the nod ahead of his closest challenger Yuki Bhambri after Rohan Bopanna suggested his name to the All India Tennis Association (AITA).While Balaji's next big assignment is Wimbledon, he has his plans sorted for the Olympics . Bopanna and Balaji will join hands after Wimbledon and compete in two clay-court tournaments in the lead-up to the Games, where tennis events will be played at Roland Garros. ""We will be playing in ATP 500 Hamburg (Germany) and ATP 250 Umag (Croatia). We will be getting together right after the completion of Wimbledon,"" Sriram told TOI from England, where he is turning out in the ATP Ilkley Challenger.""It is a dream-come-true moment and it is always special when you play for the country. I am happy that Rohan chose me as his partner, and I am looking forward to the Olympics.

Balaji and Miguel Angel ReyesVarela, entering the main draw as alternates, went toe-to-toe against Bopanna and Matthew Ebden before the second seeds won the tight three-set contest.""The French Open performance played its part, but I will not say that it was the only reason for my selection. After the match, Bopanna told me that he was going to pick me and send an email to the AITA. He would have had a lot of discussions with his coach Scott [Davidoff] and Balu sir (M Balachandran) for the ideal choice and I did not know anything about this.""",India's Sriram Balaji is set for his maiden appearance at the Olympic Games in Paris.

Andy Murray a Wimbledon doubt after injury forces him to retire at Queen's,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/andy-murray-a-wimbledon-doubt-after-injury-forces-him-to-retire-at-queens/articleshow/111120587.cms,"NEW DELHI: Andy Murray 's second-round match at Queen's came to a premature end on Wednesday when he was forced to retire after just five games due to injury, raising concerns about his potential farewell appearance at Wimbledon , AFP reported.The 37-year-old Murray's hip and right leg appeared to give way following his very first serve of the match against Australia's Jordan Thompson .Despite serving out the game virtually on one leg and holding for 1-2 after dropping the first two games, Murray's condition did not improve.During the changeover, Murray received vigorous treatment on his right hip, which he had replaced in 2019, and his right knee during a medical time-out.Although he returned to play the fourth game, Murray struggled to chase down anything out of reach and served first serves at speeds below 100 mph (160 kph).The official explanation for Murray's retirement at 4-1 down was a back injury . The Scot, who is a two-time Wimbledon champion and five-time Queen's winner, had already shown signs of discomfort during his first-round victory over Alexei Popyrin on Tuesday.As Murray enters what is expected to be his final year on tour, fitness issues continue to plague him, potentially jeopardizing his hopes of making a final appearance at Wimbledon, which is set to begin in less than two weeks.Reflecting on the brief encounter, the 30-year-old Thompson noted, ""I could see he had a problem in the warm-up and then his first serve.""""I thought, 'hit the ball in and make him run'. I actually learned that from him, when he was playing, and if a guy was hurt or cramping or something, he'd always use a drop shot or just try and take it up the line.""He added: ""I learned a lot of things watching him play, so it's an honour to share the court with him, but it's just sad that it ended like that.""","Andy Murray forced to retire after just five games due to injury.
