Supreme Court will talk to patient’s parents before deciding on passive euthanasia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-will-talk-to-patients-parents-before-deciding-on-passive-euthanasia/articleshow/126068799.cms,"Court asks two lawyers to meet & interact with Harish’s parents, siblings



NEW DELHI: Saying that time has come for it to decide on the passive euthanasia plea regarding 31-year-old Harish Rana, who has been in a vegetative state for the last 13 years, Supreme Court on Thursday decided to talk to his parents before it moves further in the matter.Significantly, the secondary report filed by AIIMS medical board, as was directed by SC, is similar to the primary medical board’s report, which had said that there is negligible chance of the man’s recovery.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan called AIIMS Delhi’s secondary medical report a “sad” one and said it wanted to talk to the parents in person before moving ahead.It requested them to come to court on Jan 13 when it would interact with them in the chamber. The court also directed its registry to furnish the AIIMS medical report to additional SG Aishwarya Bhati.The Supreme Court also directed its registry to furnish the AIIMS medical report additional SG and advocate Rashmi Nandakumar, who is appearing for Harish's father. “We have reached a stage wherein we will have to take a final call. So, your thorough assistance will be required. We will ask the registry to provide you with one copy of the report.Study the report. You will have to assist us. It's a very sad report, and it will be a big challenge for us also, but we can't keep the boy like this for all time to come,” it told both the lawyers.The bench also asked the two lawyers to meet and interact with Harish’s parents and his siblings to discuss the issue before the next date of hearing.“In pursuance of our last order dated Dec 11, a secondary medical board was constituted by AIIMS, New Delhi. The team of doctors medically examined the patient, and a report has been forwarded. The report consists of the medical history, general examination, neurological examination and other observations made and diagnostic criteria. We direct the registry to provide each copy to Ms Rashmi and Ms Aishwarya Bhati, learned ASG. We request them to look into the report and study the same and assist us in the report. We request them to jointly speak to the parents and other family members of Harish Rana and give us a report in that regard,” the bench said.As per the procedure framed by SC on passive euthanasia, a decision to withdraw artificial life support is to be made after the primary and secondary medical boards concur. In case of contradictory reports from the two, the matter is to be decided by court, which may constitute an independent committee to depute three doctors from the fields of general medicine, cardiology, neurology, nephrology, psychiatry or oncology, with experience in critical care and with overall standing in the medical profession of at least 20 years.Harish had fallen from the fourth floor on Aug 20, 2013. He was treated at various hospitals, but his condition did not improve. His father had first moved Delhi HC, which refused his plea to refer the case to a primary medical board.Last week, the court went through the report of the primary medical board set up by Noida District Hospital and said, “The bare reading of the letter would indicate Harish is in a pathetic condition.”","Court asks two lawyers to meet & interact with Harish’s parents, siblings.

Rahul Gandhi’s fading charm

NEW DELHI: The Congress 's internal churn burst into the open again recently after former Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim wrote to Sonia Gandhi, calling for ""open-heart surgery"" in the party and flagging a growing disconnect between the leadership and its workers.Similar concerns were raised in the run-up to the Bihar assembly elections this year in November, where the distance between the ""leadership"" and the workers was on display during seat distribution talks.Since its formation in 1885, the Congress has had problem of plenty. There were too many popular leaders, too many dedicated party workers and too many loyal supporters during the country’s freedom struggle.After Independence, the country rallied behind Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and the Congress, helping the party win almost every election. To its credit, the party served as a broad canopy under which different ideologies co-existed.Cut to the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha election: everything seemed to go against the grand old party. After a 10-year run at the Centre, the Congress found itself reeling under corruption charges, anti-incumbency and a sudden exodus of senior leaders just ahead of the polls. The final nail in the coffin was the ""Modi wave"", which helped the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) sweep away the general election.Since then, the stars have not aligned for the Congress. The party continues to face more or less the same problems it did a decade ago. It remains plagued by infighting, disillusioned workers and senior leaders jumping ship after flagging serious leadership issues.In his letter to Sonia Gandhi dated December 8, ex-Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim highlighted six consecutive election losses in Odisha and three in Lok Sabha while also questioning the selection of Mallikarjun Kharge as the party's leader, claiming that the 83-year-old veteran ""is unable to resonate with India's youth.""In his five-page letter, he also complained that he had not been granted an audience with Rahul Gandhi for almost three years. “This is not a personal grievance … but a reflection of a wider emotional disconnect felt by workers across India, who feel unseen and unheard,” he wrote.This is not the first time a party leader has complained about not getting an audience with the Congress scion. The list has only grown longer. Leaders such as Himanta Biswa Sarma, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Jitin Prasada have quit the Congress and joined rival parties after raising similar concerns.This raises a key question: why are so many leaders disgruntled with the grand old party, and why is it steadily losing its cadre across states?After suffering a debacle in the 2014 general election at the hands of the BJP, the Congress has lost more elections than it has won. Even after a promising performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, the party soon lost steam.The sharpest slide came in the Maharashtra Assembly elections, where the Congress was reduced to just 16 seats. In Bihar, its tally halved from 12 to six, while in Haryana - where it hoped to convert Lok Sabha momentum into victory - it slipped from 42 to 37. Even in Delhi, where the Congress was trying to claw back to relevance, the party drew a blank for the third consecutive time.The only two states where the Congress did marginally better - Jammu & Kashmir and Jharkhand - were ones where it fought as a junior partner in a coalition.In political alliances, chemistry between parties is paramount. Historically, however, many regional parties allied with the Congress were either born out of splits from it or emerged from anti-Congress sentiment.This unequal match often creates friction for the grand old party. For instance, the Congress’s alliance with the National Conference in Jammu and Kashmir appeared to be on the brink of collapse following sharp differences.Chief minister Omar Abdullah has, on several occasions, publicly expressed displeasure over the Congress’s decision to launch a campaign for the restoration of statehood without consulting its ally.Similarly, the Congress’s relationship with the Aam Aadmi Party has been turbulent within the INDIA bloc. After prolonged seat-sharing negotiations and resistance from the Congress’s Delhi unit, the two parties fought together in Delhi, Gujarat and Haryana in the Lok Sabha polls, but against each other in Punjab.Last year, they failed to reach a consensus on seat-sharing in the Haryana Assembly elections and contested separately. In the Delhi Assembly elections earlier this year as well, both parties fought a bitter battle, raising questions over how the two would function as allies within the INDIA bloc.In such situations, party workers on the ground - wired to defend their own party - often find themselves confused while coordinating with alliance partners who hold opposing ideological positions.The Congress 'high command' is also frequently accused of taking too long to act when power tussles erupt within state units.As an ongoing standoff between Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar forces the leadership into repeated deliberations, no decisive call has yet been taken.Similar leadership tussles played out in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, where factionalism among state leaders eventually contributed to the party losing power. The common thread across these states has been the Congress leadership’s reluctance to act decisively in battles between the old guard and younger turks.In Rajasthan, Sachin Pilot - who as state president had led the party to a decisive victory in 2018 - staked claim to the chief minister’s post. The party, however, backed veteran Ashok Gehlot, who had led the Congress to defeat in 2013. Pilot and his supporters were left disappointed. When he intensified his campaign for the top job, Gehlot used his influence to quell the rebellion. Though the Gandhi family persuaded Pilot to stay, the high command’s bet on Gehlot failed, with the party losing the state in 2024.Several Congress leaders, including Sanjay Nirupam, have alleged that the party suffers from multiple power centres, each backed by its own lobby.Expelled from the party in 2024, Nirupam claimed there was no future for the Congress and accused the leadership of “tremendous arrogance”.“Earlier there was one power centre in the Congress. Now there are five - Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Mallikarjun Kharge and general secretary KC Venugopal. All have their own lobbies, which keep clashing. In the middle of this, lakhs of workers like me are stuck,” Nirupam had said.In the Bihar assembly elections, Rahul Gandhi once again failed to make an impact. His Voter Adhikar Yatra, launched just days before polling, did not turn out to be the trump card the party was hoping it would. His repeated attacks on the Election Commission and allegations of “vote theft” also failed to resonate with voters.After the yatra, Rahul remained largely absent, returning to the campaign trail only in the last leg. His absence became a major issue amid unrest within party ranks, with leaders alleging discrepancies in ticket distribution.As the polls approached, cracks within the Congress’s Bihar unit resurfaced. Rebel leaders, including several MLAs, staged protests after being denied tickets and demanded the immediate replacement of the party’s Bihar in-charge, Krishna Allavaru, with a “political” appointee. As expected, the writing was on the wall and the party emerged as the weakest link in its alliance, recording the lowest strike rate among the major partners.The Congress seems to be mired in a cycle of post-mortems, exits, and letters for the time being, while its rival BJP is busy expanding its presence on the ground. As the five states/UT, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Kerala and Puducherry, gear up for the high-stakes elections next year, the real test no longer remains about winning for Congress, but whether the party can still reform itself in time.","Former Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim wrote to Sonia Gandhi, calling for ""open-heart surgery"" in the party.

Digital and determined: Uttarakhand's Gen-Z pradhans shatter stereotypes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/digital-and-determined-ukhands-gen-z-pradhans-shatter-stereotypes/articleshow/126067133.cms,"Real change starts at your doorstep, says a GenZ pradhan

DEHRADUN: In the hills of Uttarakhand, with outmigration that has long hollowed out many of its villages, a political shift is taking root with a new cadre of Gen Z pradhans - many of them women, and barely out of college. Armed with degrees and smartphones, they are stepping into local governance with a determination to rebuild the places they call home.When Uttarakhand's latest panchayat results came out at the end of July, many young women entered seats long held by older generations as first-timers. Few months in, they are now challenging two long-standing Himalayan realities: migration and patriarchy. And they are doing so while shattering the stereotype of the pradhan-pati (village head's husband) model that dominates grassroots politics. For these 20-year-somethings, entering the panchayat is not a ticket to fame or wealth, but a conscious choice to ""return home"". And the mandate they've taken on is ambitious: fixing schools, strengthening healthcare, improving roads, and above all, slowing the steady flow of young people who leave the state in search of opportunity.At 22, Sakshi Rawat could have been working in a lab in Dehradun. Instead, three months after completing her biotechnology degree, she chose to return to her village, Kui, in Pauri Garhwal.This, even as her friends chased private jobs in cities. ""Most youngsters leave their villages after studying,"" Sakshi said. ""I want them to stay, to build something of their own here."" The decision to contest was entirely her own. Inspired by young grassroots innovators like Pawan Bisht of nearby village Maroda, who returned to the hills to pursue advanced farming, Sakshi believes Uttarakhand's revival will be youth-led. ""Our biggest challenge isn't geography or funds but mindset. People still think success lies outside the village. Real change will come when results at home become visible,"" she said.In Chamoli's Sarkot village, 21-year-old Priyanka Negi once wanted to be a mathematician. But her father, himself a two-time village head, saw the spark early and began taking her to block meetings. ""I was always drawn to numbers,"" she said, ""but during my graduation, I realised governance is the real math...."" Her priorities are clear. ""Road connectivity... Fix the roads, and half the problems of rural, hill life resolve themselves. ""For 22-year-old Deeksha Mandoli, leadership came early, as did motherhood. Married at 20 and a mother by 21, she is now the pradhan of Gulari village, Chamoli. An English graduate, she believes addiction among youth is an emerging issue. Deeksha rejects the old ""pradhan-pati"" dynamic with calmness. ""People now talk to us directly..."" In Chari, a Chamoli village with 250 voters, Kiran Negi has taken the new pradhan charge. Kiran, the youngest pradhan from her block, said ""This village is tiny, but problems aren't. Roads, water... Everything needs work."" The absence of a male figure by her side, has made her decisions more visible, Kiran said, challenging the old idea that ambition lives only in cities.","In the hills of Uttarakhand, a political shift is taking root with a new cadre of Gen Z pradhans.

H-1B Showdown: Amazon, Google Microsoft Pour Billions Into India as 20 States Sue Trump

NEW DELHI: An H-1B visa holder expressed their frustration over a sudden visa rescheduling that moved their December interview to March 2026 and left them unable to return to the US.The user shared their experience in a post on the workplace forum Blind. He said the rescheduling appears linked to a new social media vetting policy. Officials are now reviewing applicants’ posts on platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn to check for content seen as negative toward the US.“So I am one of those unlucky souls who got hit by the mass rescheduling this week. I had my h1b interview scheduled for December and got an email saying its moved to March 2026. MARCH. That’s literally 3 months away,” the uservwrote.They said the lack of information from employers has made the situation worse. “The worst part is nobody knows what's happening. The immigration team at my company is clueless, HR is giving generic responses like ‘we understand your frustration’ which helps exactly zero percent,” they added.The visa holder said they are currently stuck in India after their I-94 expired and are on unpaid leave.They’ve been relying on personal savings while waiting for updates and said a request to work from his company’s India office had not been answered.The user also noted that starting January 1, visa applicants will be allowed only one free rescheduling. If they miss the March appointment or needs to change it again, a visa fee of about Rs 16,000 will have to be paid.“Thousands of us got hit at the same time. december was supposed to be peak season for h1b stamping and they just wiped out the entire month. people who took expensive flights, booked hotels, all of that just gone,” they wrote.They ended the post by asking if others were facing the same situation and whether they were trying to get emergency appointments or arranging to work from India.The disruptions follow a new US State Department rule announced on December 3 that requires social-media screening for all H-1B workers and their H-4 dependents starting December 15. The rule is slowing down interviews, especially at busy consulates in Hyderabad and Chennai, and has led to mass cancellations of appointments originally scheduled for mid-to-late December 2025. Many of these appointments have been pushed into next year, with some as far out as June 2026.The US Embassy in India has warned that arriving on an old appointment date could lead to denial of entry. Immigration lawyers are now advising H-1B holders in the US to avoid non-essential travel.Under the new directive, all H-1B and H-4 applicants must make their social media profiles public so consular officers can review their online activity.

Risks to Consider

For Seattle Mariners:

For Bo Bichette:

For Toronto Blue Jays:

Seattle Mariners have spent years building a pitching staff that can carry a playoff team. The offense has been good at times, but rarely dependable enough to match it. That gap is why Bo Bichette has emerged as a serious point of interest, whether through free agency or a sign-and-trade setup.Bo Bichette fits where the Mariners have fallen short. He brings contact, consistency, and lineup balance at a time when Seattle’s competitive window is wide open. If the goal is to move from playoff appearances to real title pressure, this is the type of move that changes the team’s profile.The Seattle Mariners win games by preventing runs. Their rotation and overall run suppression have ranked near the top of the league, but the offense has often relied too heavily on Julio Rodríguez. Bo Bichette directly addresses that issue.In 2025, he hit .311 with a .357 on-base percentage and a .483 slugging mark. He finished with 18 home runs, 94 RBI, 181 hits, and an .840 OPS. His production came from steady contact rather than streaky power, which matters in a park like T-Mobile.He hits line drives, uses the whole field, and avoids long dry spells. Placing that bat near Rodríguez would give Seattle Mariners a second dependable presence in the order, something the lineup has lacked in recent postseasons.Bo Bichette reached free agency at 27 after completing a three-year arbitration buyout with Toronto. He declined a qualifying offer in the mid-$20 million range, signaling he’s looking for a long-term deal.Seattle Mariners’ cleanest option is a straight signing:• 7-8 years• Estimated value between $180–220 million• Loss of a draft pick and international bonus pool money to TorontoThis places Bichette in the same contract tier as recent middle-infield stars and avoids trade complications.A more aggressive option would involve Toronto signing Bichette and immediately trading him:• Seattle receives Bichette on a pre-set long-term contract• Toronto receives prospects or young major-league talent instead of only draft compensationThis setup allows Toronto to recover more value while Seattle secures the player without a bidding war.Seattle Mariners already have J.P. Crawford at shortstop. That used to make Bichette a difficult fit.That changed when Bichette made it clear he is open to playing second base full-time.The alignment would be simple:• Crawford stays at short• Bichette plays secondSeattle would have a stable, productive middle infield with solid defense and strong contact at both spots. It also expands Bichette’s market and makes Seattle a practical landing spot.• A prime-age hitter who raises the lineup’s floor• Less offensive volatility in a park that punishes empty power• A clear signal that the team is pushing all-in during Rodríguez’s prime• A long-term deal at peak earning age• An everyday role without positional conflict• A roster built to contend behind elite pitching• Payroll flexibility instead of an eight-year commitment• Draft compensation if he leaves via free agency• The chance to add real talent back in a sign-and-trade scenarioToronto also avoids long-term risk after Bichette’s uneven 2024 season.The pattern is clear. When healthy, Bichette produces steady, high-end contact that holds up over a full season.Seattle has already improved offensively. Bichette would push that progress further.• Long contracts carry decline risk in the later years• Payroll flexibility tightens• Draft picks or prospects are lost• T-Mobile Park can suppress right-handed power• Expectations would be immediate• Reinvesting the savings doesn’t guarantee equal valueThese are normal tradeoffs for teams operating at the top of the market.In the short term, Seattle benefits the most. Adding a prime-age .300 hitter to a roster backed by elite pitching materially raises its chances over the next few seasons.Long term, the risk shifts. If Bichette declines in his early 30s, Toronto may look right for stepping away. Seattle would be paying for past production.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Yankees could be best landing spot for $33.6 million Toronto Blue Jays star; best Anthony Volpe replacement? That’s the cost of trying to win. Pairing Julio Rodríguez with Bo Bichette would raise the Mariners’ ceiling in a real way. Even if the contract hurts later, the move fits exactly what a serious contender is supposed to do now.","Bo Bichette reached free agency at 27 after completing a three-year arbitration buyout with Toronto.

Why Davante Adams is not playing vs Seahawks today? Rams WR's return timeline revealed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-davante-adams-is-not-playing-vs-seahawks-today-rams-wrs-return-timeline-revealed/articleshow/126067551.cms,"Davante Adams injury report (Getty Images)

Davante Adams week-to-week status and recovery outlook



Davante Adams is not playing for the Los Angeles Rams tonight against the Seattle Seahawks, as the star wide receiver remains sidelined with knee and hamstring injuries. The 32-year-old, who was initially listed as doubtful, has officially been declared inactive. This comes as a blow for Rams fans, as Adams has been the team’s most potent offensive weapon since joining in the 2025 offseason. Leading the NFL with 14 receiving touchdowns this season, his absence reshapes the Rams’ offensive plans for tonight’s clash.Adams’ injuries, sustained in Week 15 against the Detroit Lions, are being treated cautiously. He pulled up short while running a route in the fourth quarter, clutching his hamstring. NFL insider Ian Rapoport confirmed the situation remains week-to-week, noting that Adams is not dealing with a season-ending issue. While fans may hope for a quick return, the team is taking no chances. The Rams also listed other inactives tonight, including CB Ahkello Witherspoon, QB Stetson Bennett IV, RB Jarquez Hunter, OL Beaux Limmer, and OLB Nick Hampton, signaling a lineup that will look markedly different without Adams’ presence.The focus now shifts to when Adams might return. “So, don't expect him to play tonight, but the hope is, next game, if there's enough time to recover, we could see Davante out there,” Rapoport said, emphasizing cautious optimism. Earlier in the week, he also highlighted the possibility of Adams missing the remainder of the regular season, depending on recovery progress. “There are only a couple types of injuries this time of year: there's an injury where a guy is fine, there's an injury where he's back for the playoffs, and then he's done. The hope is that this is one of those he's back for the playoffs,” Rapoport added.The Rams’ schedule offers some relief. With a mini-bye ahead of Week 17 due to the Thursday night game, Adams will have 11 days to recover, giving medical staff a crucial window to evaluate his readiness. Encouragingly, he was able to participate in some pre-game warm-ups on Thursday night, indicating progress. Fans can expect a new update at the start of next week, or by Thursday at the latest when Los Angeles releases its first weekly injury report. While tonight’s game will see Adams on the sidelines, his eventual return remains a key factor in the Rams’ push toward a playoff run.Also Read: Puka Nacua injury update: Los Angeles Rams’ star WR’s availability for tonight’s Seahawks game sparks panic after Sunday night scare","Davante Adams is not playing for the Los Angeles Rams tonight against the Seattle Seahawks.

Puka Nacua gesture explained: Rams star breaks silence with apology after antisemitic controversy goes viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/puka-nacua-gesture-explained-rams-star-breaks-silence-with-apology-after-antisemitic-controversy-goes-viral/articleshow/126067070.cms,"Puka Nacua gesture apology (Getty Images)

Puka Nacua addresses the controversy with a public apology



Puka Nacua stepped into an uncomfortable spotlight this week, and the moment quickly grew larger than a single livestream clip. The Los Angeles Rams wide receiver, celebrated for his explosive play and steady rise in the NFL , found himself answering for a gesture made in a casual online setting that carried far more weight than he realized.The controversy traces back to a Tuesday night livestream appearance, where Puka Nacua was encouraged to rehearse a gesture pitched as a future touchdown celebration. Footage of the moment spread quickly, and criticism followed just as fast, with many pointing out the antisemitic meaning tied to the action. By Thursday, Nacua addressed the issue directly on Instagram, choosing clarity over excuses.“When I appeared the other day on a social media livestream, it was suggested to me to perform a specific movement as part of my next touchdown celebration,” he wrote. “At the time, I had no idea this act was antisemitic in nature and perpetuated harmful stereotypes against Jewish people.”His statement went further, underscoring accountability rather than defensiveness. “I deeply apologize to anyone who was offended by my actions as I do not stand for any form of racism, bigotry or hate of another group of people.”The NFL echoed that stance in a formal response, reinforcing its position against discrimination.The league said it “strongly condemns all forms of discrimination and derogatory behavior directed towards any group or individual.” It added, “The continuing rise of antisemitism must be addressed across the world, and the NFL will continue to stand with our partners in this fight. Hatred has no place in our sport or society. ”The Rams followed with their own statement, stressing shared values within the organization. “There is no place in this world for Antisemitism as well as other forms of prejudice or hostility towards the Jewish people and people of any religion, ethnicity, or race.”As the Rams prepare for a high profile matchup against the Seattle Seahawks, the incident serves as a reminder that athletes carry influence far beyond game day. For Nacua, now a Pro Bowl receiver on a team leading the NFC, the moment marks a lesson learned publicly. His response suggests an understanding that growth often begins with listening, acknowledging harm, and choosing to do better next time.Also Read: Puka Nacua injury update: Los Angeles Rams’ star WR’s availability for tonight’s Seahawks game sparks panic after Sunday night scare","Puka Nacua addresses the controversy with a public apology on Instagram.

How did Brittany Williams and Josh Allen meet?

What does Brittany Williams do for a living?

Why did the power couple break up?

Also Read:

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen’s personal life has often drawn attention alongside his on-field success. While Allen is now married to actress Hailee Steinfeld, interest around his former long-term partner, Brittany Williams, has resurfaced in recent months. The two shared a deep history that stretched back to childhood, making their eventual split in 2023 a notable moment for fans. Here’s a closer look at who Brittany Williams is and her journey beyond her relationship with the NFL star.Brittany Williams and Josh Allen’s story began long before the spotlight. The pair grew up in Fresno, California, and first met as children through family connections. Though they lost touch for years, they reconnected during their late teens and officially began dating in 2017.As Allen’s football career gained momentum: first at Wyoming and then in the NFL, Williams remained a constant presence. When Allen was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in 2018, she relocated to New York with him, becoming a familiar face to Bills fans during his rise as one of the league’s elite quarterbacks.Williams attended California State University, Fresno, where she was a cheerleader and a member of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority.Sports were already a part of her family background; her father, Chris Williams, played college football at Fresno State in the 1990s.That athletic upbringing helped Williams easily adapt to the football-centric lifestyle that came with dating a franchise quarterback.Away from football, Brittany Williams has carved out her own professional identity. She is a certified Pilates instructor and runs an online fitness platform called Pilates by Britt, where she shares workout programs and wellness content.In addition, Williams has built a following as a fashion and lifestyle influencer. She regularly collaborates with well-known brands such as Alo, Revolve and Talentless, and maintains an active presence on social media, where she posts fitness routines, travel snapshots and fashion partnerships.Williams and Allen quietly ended their relationship in 2023 after nearly six years together. While neither publicly detailed the reasons behind the breakup, Williams later acknowledged that re-entering the dating world after a decade-long relationship was challenging but ultimately empowering.Since the split, she has focused on her career, personal growth and life in New York, while Allen has moved on to a new chapter in his personal life.Though no longer together, Brittany Williams remains more than just “Josh Allen’s ex.” From fitness entrepreneurship to influencing, she continues to build her own path - one that stands independent of her past NFL connection.","Brittany Williams and Josh Allen split in 2023 after nearly six years together.

Pain In Peak Hrs; 2,768 Vehicles Turned Away

BS-VI: Some caught unawares, others fume

NEW DELHI: Barricades snapped shut, whistles pierced the air, and confusion spread quickly across Delhi's borders Thursday morning as a rule barring non-Delhi, non-BS 6 vehicles came into force under GRAP Stage IV. Routine entry points rapidly turned into impromptu checkposts, catching many commuters off guard during peak hours.Traffic slowed to a crawl as police stopped vehicles bumper to bumper and scanned registration certificates, calling out ""BS 6?"", and scribbling details into handwritten registers. Drivers waited inside idling cars, watching the line inch forward, unsure whether they would be allowed to proceed or forced to turn back.Across 13 main borders from Kapashera to Badarpur, till 4pm, 2,768 vehicles were checked for compliance with BS 6 norms, of which 460 were turned back. Most vehicles were turned back at Najafgarh (175), Sarita Vihar/Kalindi Kunj (93), and Badarpur (33). Fewer vehicles were sent back at Narela (9) and Kapashera (8).At the Noida-Kalindi Kunj border, around 30 cars were turned back between 9.30am and 10.30am, officials said.Each U-turn created fresh snarls metres away from the barricades, and compounding congestion on already clogged stretches.Many commuters said the ban, announced on Tuesday, was enforced without warning. Dipak and his wife set out early from Pari Chowk in Greater Noida, hoping for a smooth drive towards Khatu Shyam for darshan, confidently following the route suggested by Google Maps. The journey was uneventful, until they reached Kalindi Kunj.A traffic policeman asked them to pull over, checked the vehicle details, and informed them that their car was BS V and not registered in Delhi. ""We genuinely didn't know about the rule,"" Dipak said. ""Google Maps showed this route, so we came. Now we have to go back 27km to Pari Chowk and start all over again. It's very disappointing.""They were not alone. Just a few lanes away, Brigadier Chawla faced a similar setback while travelling with his daughter, who had arrived from the US, to their hometown in Haryana.The situation eased after peak hours as traffic volumes fell. Enforcement continued till late into the evening.Traffic cops said it was tough ""stopping vehicles, checking them, and controlling traffic simultaneously"". Some 37 Prakhar vans and more than 500 traffic police personnel were deployed across major border points and key internal stretches. ""We managed to stop and check vehicles to some extent, while also helping people understand the rules,"" a traffic cop said. One person taking his father to dialysis had to be turned back, said a cop.As the day passed, and frustration coursed through the serpentine crawl of vehicles, commuters questioned the way the order was communicated. ""There are people who don't follow the news regularly. How are they supposed to know?"" asked Anil Kumar, a real estate professional. ""Why couldn't the transport department send automated SMS or WhatsApp alerts? Anyway, it's not like every car can be checked-there are just too many. "" Others admitted they were unsure about emission categories and struggled to understand whether their vehicles were BS IVor BS VI.Similar scenes unfolded at the Mayur Vihar and Ghazipur borders too. When Poonam's car was stopped at Mayur Vihar's Chilla border, her driver quickly stepped out, fumbling with documents. ""Arey, it's a petrol car,"" she told the policeman, visibly puzzled. When infor-med it still wasn't BS VI compliant, she paused and asked, ""Sorry, what does that mean?"" Eventually, she took a U-turn, adding, ""Maybe it's a good move. We'll take another car next time.""Others were confident until checks proved otherwise, and far less accepting. Praveen Kumar discovered his Camry met BS IV norms, not BS IV. ""I was sure it was compliant,"" he said, shaking his head in disbelief as he turned back.Advocate Vijay Mittal, who was stopped while heading to court, said he was aware of the order but did not realise his diesel BS IVcar would be barred. Ghaziabad resident Dr Pushkar Verma, travelling from Jaipur to report for duty at GTB Hospital, was also turned back. ""My car is 10 years old. I didn't think this would be an issue. I'll now have to take the Metro,"" he said.While cops turned back even those with genuine needs, questions lingered about the practicality of the exercise. At Kalindi Kunj, around 11 traffic personnel were deployed, while vehicle volumes during the morning peak can touch nearly 200,000, sources said. At Mayur Vihar, 7-9 were on duty, again vastly outnumbered by the flow of vehicles. With barricades and mid-way U-turns in place, congestion mounted rapidly.Transport expert Anil Chhikara called the ban ""premature"", and said enforcement would inevitably be compromised, given the poor manpower. ""Turning vehicles back at borders only leads to idling and higher emissions. Pollution in the NCR is a regional problem and treating it as only a Delhi issue won't help,"" he said.","2,768 vehicles were checked for compliance with BS 6 norms, of which 460 were turned back.

Fans throw objects, vandalise stadium after Messi leaves early | Hyderabad next

Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has taken legal action against Uttam Saha, the president of the Argentina Fan Club of Kolkata, by filing a defamation case seeking Rs 50 crore in damages. The move follows allegations made by Saha linking Ganguly to the controversy surrounding the chaotic Yuva Bharati Stadium event during Lionel Messi ’s visit to Kolkata on Saturday, December 13.The complaint, lodged at Lalbazar, states that Saha’s public remarks were baseless and caused serious damage to Ganguly’s reputation. Ganguly has termed the accusations “false, malicious, offensive and defamatory”, alleging that they were made with full knowledge of the harm they could cause to his public image.Currently serving as the president of the Cricket Association of Bengal, Ganguly clarified in his complaint that he had no official role in organising or managing the Messi event. He maintained that his presence at the stadium was strictly as an invited guest and that he had no involvement in the planning or execution of the programme.The legal action adds a new dimension to the fallout from Messi’s much-hyped visit to Kolkata, which descended into disorder and sparked widespread criticism.Ganguly’s complaint specifically challenges claims made by Saha that he acted as a middleman in the management of the event, which was overseen by its main organiser, Satadru Dutta.“Serious allegations are being made publicly without any factual basis,” Ganguly stated in his filing. His legal representatives have since issued a notice to Saha, demanding a retraction of the statements and compensation for the alleged damage caused.Following the chaos at the venue, event organiser Satadru Dutta was detained for questioning by authorities. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee later issued a public apology on X, expressing regret over the mismanagement of the event and apologising to Lionel Messi as well as football fans in Kolkata who were unable to see the Argentine star properly.During the event at Yuva Bharati Stadium, Ganguly was present in a separate area of the venue. As the situation in the stands deteriorated, he was seen exiting the stadium, visibly disappointed by the turn of events.The Messi programme was widely criticised for poor planning and crowd control, leaving fans frustrated after paying hefty ticket prices in anticipation of a memorable experience. Instead, scenes of disorder dominated coverage, drawing national and international attention to shortcomings in the organisation of high-profile sporting events in India.The incident also revived debates around VIP culture at major sports functions. Reports and videos highlighted limited fan interaction with Messi, while officials and invited guests occupied the field area, further fuelling anger among supporters and adding to the backlash surrounding the event.",Sourav Ganguly has filed a defamation case against Uttam Saha.

Auston Matthews and the pressure point Toronto cannot ignore

The mood around the Maple Leafs has shifted from confidence to caution. Toronto entered the season expecting its captain to set the pace, yet nights now pass where the scoreboard stays silent for stretches that feel unfamiliar. Auston Matthews still generates chances, still competes hard in all three zones, but goals no longer arrive with the same inevitability. In a market that measures greatness shift by shift, that absence has grown louder than any cheer.What makes this moment heavier is timing. Toronto is not rebuilding or experimenting. This is a team built to win now. When production stalls at the center of that plan, anxiety spreads quickly. Conversations that once felt unthinkable are now whispered openly, not because Matthews has fallen off, but because expectations around him remain sky high.The tension spiked when Leafs reporter Howard Berger suggested the organization will not move forward until Matthews asks for a trade, possibly by this year’s trade deadline. That idea alone rattled the fanbase. Matthews has been the franchise constant for nearly a decade.Imagining Toronto without him feels like pulling a load-bearing wall from the house.On the ice, the frustration has roots. Matthews continues to win faceoffs, backcheck, and handle defensive responsibility. Yet Toronto pays him to swing games offensively. At five-on-five, his line has not consistently owned shifts. On the power play, the dominance that once felt automatic has faded into predictability. The looks are there, but the finish has gone missing.That gap between effort and outcome feeds scrutiny. In Toronto, leadership is judged through goals when the stakes rise. When scoring dries up, every shift becomes a test of authority and legacy. Nick Kypreos tried to strike a more hopeful tone in the Toronto Star, but optimism struggles to breathe when results lag behind reputation.The coaching staff has searched for answers. Different wingers, altered looks, and tactical tweaks have come and gone. The puck still moves well, but the instinctive scoring touch that defined Matthews has not returned with consistency. There is also quiet talk of tension with coach Craig Berube, another layer that complicates an already delicate situation.Trading a captain in his prime is not standard practice. Neither is standing still while doubt grows inside a contender. Toronto management now faces a narrow path where action and inaction both carry consequences. Whether Berger’s report proves prophetic or premature, it captures how fragile this stretch feels.Matthews remains elite. Yet in this market, elite alone no longer settles the noise. The next few months will decide more than standings. They will define how this era is remembered, and whether Auston Matthews and Toronto find clarity together or part under pressure.Also Read: Are Auston Matthews and Craig Berube drifting apart as Maple Leafs struggles spark tense locker-room speculation?","The mood around the Maple Leafs has shifted from confidence to caution.

Viral claim about Patrick Mahomes political speech falls apart under scrutiny

A controversial rumor involving Patrick Mahomes went viral on social media this week, pulling NFL fans into a political story that felt bigger than football. The claim suggested the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback had delivered a fiery speech attacking Us President Donald Trump at a charity fundraiser, just hours after the Chiefs were knocked out of the playoff race. Given Mahomes’ public image and his history of avoiding political statements, the post immediately raised eyebrows among fans.The post went viral on X, with its strong language and emotional quotes grabbing all the attention. Thousands shared it before stopping to ask whether it was actually true or not. Where was the video? Who witnessed the speech? And why hadn’t any credible outlet reported it?The claim originated from a single X post that framed the moment as breaking news. It alleged that Mahomes spoke at a charity fundraiser for Bondi Beach attack victims and publicly slammed Trump’s priorities. The post opened with this line: “BREAKING: Patrick Mahomes BLASTS Trump for Building a Gaudy Ballroom While Americans Go Hungry and Lose Healthcare — ‘If You Can’t See a Doctor, Don’t Worry, He will Save You a Dance in His Ballroom. ’”The thread went further, painting a picture of Mahomes at a microphone in an emotional setting.Several quotes were attributed to him, including: “While families are choosing between food and medicine, he’s busy choosing chandeliers,” and again, “If you can’t see a doctor, don’t worry — he will save you a dance in his ballroom.” It ended with a final alleged statement: “America doesn’t need another ballroom. We need a backbone. ”Despite how detailed the post looked, there is no proof any of it actually did happen. No video or audio has surfaced. There is no transcript. No eyewitness accounts exist. Event organizers have not confirmed such a fundraiser, and no major sports or political outlet has reported Mahomes making these remarks.That absence matters. Mahomes is one of the most visible athletes in the world. Any real political speech from him would almost certainly be recorded, shared, and covered widely within minutes. Instead, the entire story relies on a single social media account and dramatic quotes with no independent verification.There are also timeline problems. The post claims the speech happened shortly after the Chiefs’ playoff elimination, yet there is no record of Mahomes attending or speaking at any event during that window.With no evidence, no confirmation, and no credible reporting, the viral post is now being treated as false.",Viral claim about Patrick Mahomes political speech falls apart under scrutiny.

“You’d be foolish to keep fighting”- Joaquin Buckley suggests Islam Makhachev should retire after possible Kamaru Usman win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/youd-be-foolish-to-keep-fighting-joaquin-buckley-suggests-islam-makhachev-should-retire-after-possible-kamaru-usman-win/articleshow/126057005.cms,"Islam Makhachev and Joaquin Buckley (via Getty Images)

Joaquin Buckley explains why Islam Makhachev should walk away from UFC for good



Joaquin Buckley has shared a strong opinion about Islam Makhachev’s future in the UFC. Buckley believes Makhachev should retire if he beats Kamaru Usman in a potential welterweight title fight. Makhachev recently made history at UFC 322. He beat Jack Della Maddalena by an unanimous decision. With that win, he became the 11th two-division champion in UFC history.After the fight, the talk quickly shifted to what comes next. It is noteworthy that Kamaru Usman has been calling for a title shot for some time. A possible fight between Makhachev and Usman has lately gained momentum. Ali Abdelaziz, who manages both fighters, also supported the idea. Buckley believes that the fight should mark the end of Makhachev’s career if he wins.In an interview with Submission Radio, Joaquin Buckley explained his reasoning in detail. He believes both fighters would have little left to prove after the matchup.Buckley said, “Whoever wins that fight between Islam vs. Kamaru can get out of here, because if Usman wins, he’s one and done, because he said he’s moving to get that title against Khamzat for the rematch.If Islam wins, he said he’s gonna hold it down for a long time, but I don’t believe that. If Islam gets the fight that he wants, that means not only did you submit your name at lightweight over your brother Khabib, but then you also got the double champ status, and then you also beat a GOAT in Usman. So you just pulled the Jon Jones.”Buckley then questioned what more Makhachev could achieve.“What else is there to do? What else can he do? You’d be foolish to keep fighting, because to me, Islam is not a natural 170 [pound] fighter, and that will get exposed if he fights a person like myself, Ian Garry, or Michael Morales”, he added.Makhachev himself has also spoken about the possible fight. In an interview with Red Corner MMA, he explained why Usman would be his toughest challenge at welterweight.He said, “I said I wanted to fight Kamaru Usman next. Although the media doesn’t believe in this fight, as I can see. But in my opinion, Usman would steamroll through these up-and-comers like Morales, Prates, and the striker. Those guys haven’t been checked yet. I think Usman would be the hardest fight for me.”For now, the fight remains unconfirmed. But the debate around Makhachev’s future continues to grow in the UFC fraternity.Also Read: Islam Makhachev reveals why he almost stopped the fight for teammate Tagir Ulanbekov during UFC Qatar bout",Joaquin Buckley believes Islam Makhachev should retire if he beats Kamaru Usman in a potential welterweight title fight.

5 Biggest NBA moments of 2025: Luka Doncic trade and more,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/5-biggest-nba-moments-of-2025-luka-doncic-trade-and-more/articleshow/126057014.cms,"Luka Doncic (Image via Kevin Jairaj-Imagn Images)

1. The Luka Doncic blockbuster trade



2. Jimmy Butler joins the ""Last Dance"" Warriors



4. The bitter Chris Paul-Clippers breakup



5. Dallas Mavericks fire GM Nico Harrison



If you had told an NBA fan a year ago that Luka Doncic would be seen donning a yellow jersey on the hardwood or that Tom Thibodeau would be out of a job in New York, they would have called you crazy. Yet, as we close out 2025, that is the reality of a league that has officially entered its ""chaos era."" This year wasn't just about basketball, it was about the cold, hard business of winning, where legacy and loyalty were tossed aside for immediate resets.From the dismantling of the Mavericks' core to a heartbreaking divorce in Los Angeles, here are the five seismic shifts that defined the NBA in 2025.In a move that shattered the internet on February 2, the Dallas Mavericks sent Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Anthony Davis, Max Christie, and a 2029 first-round pick. Facilitated by the Utah Jazz, this wasn't just a trade, it was a surrender. The Mavericks reportedly moved on due to long-standing frustrations regarding Luka’s conditioning and defensive commitment. While the Lakers now pair Luka with a 40-year-old LeBron James, the deal is already being analysed as one of the most lopsided gambles in sports history.After a toxic standoff in Miami that included three separate team suspensions, Jimmy Butler finally got his wish.He was traded to the Golden State Warriors in early February, immediately signing a two-year, $121 million extension. The move gave Stephen Curry the elite secondary star he’s lacked since 2022. While critics called Butler ""overpaid"" as the Warriors struggled late in the year, his defensive grit has provided a much-needed pulse to an aging dynasty.3. The New York Knicks fire Tom ThibodeauPerhaps the most ""New York"" moment of the year came on June 3. Just days after leading the Knicks to their first Eastern Conference Finals in 25 years, Tom Thibodeau was fired. Despite a 48-win season, President Leon Rose decided that a six-game series loss to the Pacers proved ""Thibs"" couldn't get them to a championship level. The move left stars like Jalen Brunson visibly stunned and marked a brutal end to the man who made the Knicks relevant again.The ""Point God’s"" storybook return to the Clippers ended in a nightmare. In early December, Chris Paul was effectively exiled, with the team sending him home from a road trip in Atlanta. The 40-year-old veteran had reportedly stopped speaking to head coach Tyronn Lue as the team spiralled into an 18-loss rut. What was meant to be a nostalgic final season turned into a messy, public divorce that left one of the game's greats working out at a private gym while awaiting a buyout.Parting with Luka Doncic put GM Nico Harrison under a lot of fire, both from the organisation and fans. As the ultimate conclusion of a meeting between Nico Harrison and the team governor, Patrick Dumont, on November 11, Mavericks fired General Manager Harrison. After a dismal 3-8 start to the 2025-26 season and facing a fan base that spent every home game chanting ""Fire Nico,"" the franchise finally pulled the plug. It was a swift fall for a GM who had been in the Finals just 18 months prior, proving that in today’s NBA, one bad trade can end a career.2025 was a year of unthinkable clashes, chaos, and trades, and served as a testament that in the modern NBA, everything is replaceable. These surprising exits have left the fans and players wondering what the next decision will be that might shake up the league.Also read: Luka Doncic max contract details: Total earnings, salary, duration, and more","2025 was a year of unthinkable clashes, chaos, and trades in the NBA.

Why did the New York Knicks decline to raise the NBA Cup Banner?

Ja Morant misses the Memphis Grizzlies' game against the Minnesota Timberwolves

Houston Rockets head coach Ime Udoka fined for lashing out at officials

December 17, 2025, turned out to be a defining day for the league. Despite winning the NBA Cup, the New York Knicks declined to lift the banner. It created a lot of buzz within the league as well as among fans. Apart from this, the Memphis Grizzlies managed to rack up a win against the Minnesota Timberwolves without Ja Morant. The star player of the team remained sidelined due to another setback injury.Off the court, the league witnessed a few controversies and punishments. Houston Rockets head coach Ime Udoka was fined for making inappropriate comments on the officiating personnel of the game during a post-game interview. This is not the first time the coach faced punishment. Udoka was previously suspended by the Boston Celtics for violating team policies.In stunning news, the winners of the NBA Cup chose restraint over celebration. The New York Knicks defeated the San Antonio Spurs to win their first cup since 1973. However, the team decided not to lift the banner against the former winners commemorating the achievement. SNY insider Ian Begley was the first one to break the news to the fans.It was an organizational choice to do so. The team seemingly wants to focus on the championship run rather than highlighting an interim success. The Knicks have never publicly spoken against the in-season tournament. However, their recent act reflects how the regular season still is a more important goal than the NBA Cup Championship.It doesn’t look like an effective season for Ja Morant. The NBA star was sidelined due to an injury since mid-November. However, he made a comeback against the Utah Jazz on December 12. Despite the comeback, the player faced another injury in the game against the Los Angeles Clippers. He missed the fourth quarter of the game due to an ankle injury. Owing to that, the athlete missed out on the game against the Minnesota Timberwolves.Morant was initially listed as questionable to play but was later downgraded to doubtful. His status for the future games remains uncertain. Despite his absence, the team managed to rack up a win against the Timberwolves with a 6-point lead.Ime Udoka faces another major punishment due to his recent comments. During a post-game interview after the Houston Rockets’ overtime loss to the Denver Nuggets. He blamed the officials partially for the team’s loss. Udoka stated, “Just in general, I think, most poorly officiated game I've seen in a long time. [Officials Natalie Sago and Jamahl Ralls] have no business being out there, and [crew chief Zach Zarba] was acting starstruck. You're seeing all kinds of inconsistent calls, and I'm sure we should've gotten a few more techs.”Following his disrespectful comments, the coach was fined a staggering amount of $25,000. The announcement was made by James Jones, Executive Vice President, Head of Basketball Operations. In the announcement, it was clearly stated that the reason behind it was “public criticism of the officiating.” Udoka has been involved in such controversies before. One such case was when the coach was suspended by the Boston Celtics for violating team policies.These are some of the top news stories of the day. With the NBA now being several weeks into the season, keep following this segment for more updates on wins, injuries and more.","Houston Rockets head coach Ime Udoka was fined for making inappropriate comments on the officiating personnel of the game during a post-game interview.

Jack Roslovic injury details emerge for Edmonton Oilers



The Edmonton Oilers have remained tight-lipped for weeks regarding Jack Roslovic’s sudden disappearance from the lineup, fueling speculation among fans and analysts. The veteran forward was injured during a November 25 game against the Dallas Stars, when a blocked shot abruptly cut short one of his strongest stretches of the season.At the time, the Oilers classified the issue as a lower-body injury, offering few details while managing Roslovic’s recovery internally. As Edmonton navigated a demanding part of its schedule, questions persisted about the severity of the injury and why one of the team’s most reliable secondary scorers remained sidelined.Clarity finally arrived this week after details surfaced during a radio appearance, revealing that Jack Roslovic required surgery following the blocked shot against the Dallas Stars. The injury, described bluntly by insiders, involved a highly sensitive area and explained both the extended absence and the organization’s discretion.While the specifics were uncomfortable, the update confirmed that Roslovic has already undergone surgery and is progressing toward a return. Barring setbacks, the Edmonton Oilers are hopeful he could rejoin the lineup sometime before Christmas, a welcome boost as the standings tighten.Before the injury, Roslovic had been quietly effective for Edmonton, and in 23 games, he recorded 10 goals and 18 points. Thus, providing valuable depth scoring behind the Oilers’ elite stars.Injuries are an unavoidable part of the NHL. But this one stands out due to its sheer bad luck and rarity. The Oilers’ cautious handling now appears justified. Also, prioritizing long-term health over a rushed return.As Edmonton pushes through a competitive stretch of the season, the potential return of Jack Roslovic could stabilize the lineup and restore offensive balance. If he can quickly regain form, the Oilers will gladly welcome him back; fully aware of how difficult and unusual the road to recovery truly was.Also Read: Net worth of New York Islanders star Bo Horvat in 2025: Details on his earnings, salary, contract details and projections","Jack Roslovic was injured during a November 25 game against the Dallas Stars.

Tom Brady’s confidence remains sky high as NFL legend addresses comeback rumors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tom-bradys-confidence-remains-sky-high-as-nfl-legend-addresses-comeback-rumors/articleshow/126059382.cms,"Image via Getty

Tom Brady Reveals What It's Like Being The GOAT, If He Could Still Play + Shaq & Brady NFL Duo?

Why Tom Brady believes he could still play at the highest level

Teams reportedly reached out after retirement

Also Read:

Even in retirement, Tom Brady continues to dominate NFL conversations. The seven-time Super Bowl champion may be 48 and firmly removed from the weekly grind of professional football, but his belief in his own ability remains as strong as ever. Recent remarks from Brady have once again fueled speculation about whether the greatest quarterback of all time could still compete or even return in the modern NFL.Speaking on The Big Podcast with Shaquille O’Neal, Brady made headlines with a characteristically blunt assessment of his current form. “I’d whoop a - right now,” Brady said, adding that with a month of preparation, he believes he could still play at the highest level. The statement, while bold, felt entirely on-brand for a player who built a two-decade dynasty on relentless self-belief and preparation.Brady was quick to clarify that his confidence does not mean a comeback is imminent. In multiple interviews, including his work as FOX Sports’ lead NFL analyst, the former Patriots and Buccaneers star explained that physical ability is not what’s keeping him off the field. Instead, it’s the commitment required to endure a full NFL season.According to Brady, the weekly punishment, recovery demands, and mental toll of a 17-game schedule are no longer appealing. While he believes he could still step in and execute an offense effectively, especially given his reliance on timing, decision-making and football IQ rather than athleticism, the long-term grind no longer aligns with his priorities.Adding intrigue to the conversation, Brady confirmed that at least one NFL team contacted him after his second retirement in 2023 to gauge his interest in returning. He declined to name the franchise, describing the inquiry as “intriguing” but insisting he was already “done-done” at that stage.The revelation underscores Brady’s enduring value around the league. Even after 23 seasons, seven Super Bowl titles and multiple retirements, teams still view him as a potential solution, a testament to the standard he set throughout his career.Beyond personal choice, there is also a structural obstacle standing firmly in the way of any comeback. Brady is now a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, a role that would legally prevent him from returning as an active NFL player unless he divested his stake. Combined with his lucrative broadcasting contract and growing business ventures, the logistics alone make a return highly unlikely.While comeback rumors may continue: especially in an era where quarterbacks are playing longer than ever, Brady has little left to prove. His comments feel less like a tease and more like a reflection of an athlete who knows exactly who he is and what he achieved.","Tom Brady believes he could still play at the highest level in the modern NFL.

“Both grown, why are people sweating”: 22 YO Eagles star Cooper DeJean is reportedly dating 42 YO WWE star Nikki Bella

Nikki Bella’s rumored dating scenario with Cooper DeJean brings up her former flame and WWE superstar John Cena



MLFootball recently dropped two photos of Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Cooper DeJean and WWE wrestler Nikki Bella , along with a caption/timeline of their reported relationship. It began when DeJean attended a WWE RAW event in Philadelphia with staffer Dom “Big Dom” DiSandro in August to see Bella, as WWE star Grayson Waller revealed.Then came NFL training camp, when the 40-year-old wrestler wore classic, custom-made Eagles attire and posed with Cooper on the gridiron. Months later, Bella posed in DeJean’s locker room. But obvious, people are beyond curious: Are Cooper DeJean and Nikki Bella dating? Maybe. Supposedly. Reportedly. There has been no official confirmation from either Cooper or Bella. Now, how is the cyberspace dealing with this circumstance? Let’s read on.“Oh wow. These young rich guys love a cougar,” reacted an X user. Nikki Bella is 42, and Cooper DeJean is 22, a 20-year age difference. Another user defended them, saying, “If they’re both grown, why are people sweating. Suddenly everyone is the age gap police.” A third user added, “Age is just a number when two adults are confident, accomplished, and living their own paths without limits or labels.” Another wanted them to be left alone: “Two grown adults.If they're dating let them live. Let them live.”Someone said people shouldn’t read too much into a photo: “It is just a photo. and if he is, he is. Both are legal adults.” One person stated, “This is none of our business.” Another speculated, “Two adults. Cooper probably grew up watching her and has now made a potential childhood fantasy a reality.” Finally, a user wrote, “They’re both adults. Age gaps always sound wild when reduced to a number, but context matters a lot more than headlines. ”On MLFootball’s recent X post about Bella and DeJean, a user mentioned Bella’s ex-fiancé, John Cena: “John Cena will not forgive you😭😭😭😭.” Nikki dated the WWE superstar from 2012 to 2018. They were engaged but reportedly called it off because they disagreed about having children. Later, Cena told TMZ he wanted to have kids.“I would love to be a dad,” Cena said. “And by the way, that’s an about-face for me, and I realize very much that I have been steadfast in saying that I don’t want children. But I’m a little bit older, a little bit wiser. At age 18, we say things different than at age 25, 35. I would love it, only because I dedicated my life to my work, and now I’m realizing that there is life and life exists, and it is beautiful. And I think part of that is being a parent. ”Cena married Shay Shariatzadeh in October 2020, and they agreed to live a child-free lifestyle as of late 2025.Bella married Artem Chigvintsev in August 2022 but filed for divorce in September 2024 after Artem’s domestic violence arrest.

David Pastrnak faces unrealistic expectations for 2026 Winter Olympics

David Pastrnak's 43 goals from the 2024-25 season

Also Read:

David Pastrnak continues proving he's the driving force behind the Boston Bruins' success. The right winger has posted 13 goals, 25 assists, and 38 points through 29 games this season, helping Boston sit second in the Atlantic Division and exceed preseason expectations.However, as the 2026 Winter Olympics approach, questions have emerged about whether Pastrnak can translate that dominance to international competition and carry Team Czechia to a medal.Czechia has shown recent success at lower-level international tournaments. The nation has finished with at least bronze in each of the three most recent World Junior Championships. At the senior World Championship, Czechia claimed first- and third-place finishes in two of the past four years.However, the Olympics represent an entirely different challenge. Expecting Czechia to reach the podium remains unrealistic despite Pastrnak's individual brilliance. The 29-year-old has been a major contributor on the international stage throughout his career.He's posted 45 points in 43 games at the World Championship and the 2016 World Cup of Hockey combined. That track record demonstrates his ability to produce against elite competition.But asking him to power the Czechs past favored Americans, Canadians, and Swedes represents a tall task.Those three nations will enter the tournament with significantly deeper rosters and more high-end talent throughout their lineups. Czechia's roster features some bright spots beyond Pastrnak. Martin Necas and Tomas Hertl should provide secondary scoring up front.Filip Hronek and Radko Gudas will anchor the defense, while Lukas Dostal brings excitement in goal as the likely starter. However, the depth falls off quickly after those core pieces. The Czechs will also rely on players currently outside the NHL, unlike Canada, the United States, and likely Sweden and Finland.That talent gap makes a medal extremely difficult to achieve. One advantage Czechia possesses is the lack of external pressure. The immense spotlight will shine on the traditional powerhouses expected to dominate. Pastrnak and his teammates can play freely without those same burdensome expectations weighing them down.Still, even if Pastrnak transformed into the second coming of Wayne Gretzky, vaulting over deeper and more talented teams ahead of them in the Olympic pecking order would remain a Herculean task. He'll face some of the planet's best defensemen and goaltenders throughout the tournament.The preliminary round includes a matchup against Canada in Group A, providing an immediate test against elite competition. By the time the Olympics conclude, Pastrnak should continue producing at a point-per-game pace on the international scene even if the medal proves elusive.If anyone can steer the dark horse to an unlikely podium finish, it will be him. That experience would prove valuable when he returns to help the Bruins rebound from last year's playoff miss.","David Pastrnak has posted 13 goals, 25 assists, and 38 points in 29 games this season.

Why Natalia Bryant filed for a civil harassment restraining order

Natalia Bryant points to public event as proof of continued fixation

Natalia Bryant’s restraining order against an alleged stalker has been extended, keeping long-standing court protections firmly in place. The ruling comes after Bryant asked the court to reassess the situation as the original order approached its end. First granted in 2022, the order was designed to block all contact and maintain distance from her home, school, and daily activities.In her recent filing, Bryant pointed to new events that she says show the issue has not faded with time. The court’s decision to extend the order reflects continued concern over compliance and personal safety. Rather than closing the case, the extension underscores that the legal system still views the risk as unresolved.Natalia's‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ mess with Dwayne Kemp originated in December 2020 at a time when she was only 17 years old and a senior at the Sage Hill School in Newport Coast, California. The information available at the court reveals that Kemp, who was 32 years old and lived in Sun Valley, California at the time, started sending her a ridiculous number of unwanted messages via social media, behaving ""as if we had a romantic relationship,or as if he wanted to pursue one,"" Natalia said in her first ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌petition.Kemp was messaging Natalia over and over, wanting to meet face-to-face and visit her at school. There was even a time when he showed up uninvited at her high school during her senior year, and school officials had to step in and escort him away.Natalia's lawyers labeled his actions as harassment, mentioning that he kept trying to reach her even after she blocked him on social media.By November 2022, at the age of 19 and enrolled at the University of Southern California (USC), Natalia found herself in a really tough spot. She decided to file for a civil harassment restraining order in Los Angeles County Superior Court, aiming to ensure that Kemp stayed at least 200 yards away from her home, workplace, school, vehicle, sorority house, and the USC campus.In her declaration, Natalia recounted Kemp's ""unsettling"" actions from the previous months, which included two attempts to visit her at USC.Court documents from that filing revealed some troubling details about Kemp's past. Natalia claimed he was a ""gun enthusiast,"" sharing screenshots of his social media where he was seen with guns.Kemp's‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ behavior returned to the center of attention, highlighting his violations of the order in a bold, public way, just as the order was expiring. A court document states that on August 24, 2025, he wildly and publicly defied the court order by crashing an event of Natalia's, targeted at her employer believed to be the one glad her modeling career, for the sole purpose of getting to her with the goal of contacting ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌her. ""Kemp arrived with flowers he planned to give directly to Natalia. When he couldn't spot her at the event, he opted to search for her mom, Vanessa Bryant, hoping to pass the bouquet along with some instructions for it to reach Natalia.In her filing from November 2025 to extend the order, Natalia described this act as ""demonstrating his continued fixation and complete disregard"" for the restraining order.Security staff stepped in before Kemp could pull it off, and he then confessed that what he was doing would break the rules.But he argued that it was okay now because he ""believed (mistakenly) that the order had expired,"" according to the court records. This event, outlined in papers acquired by TMZ Sports, triggered Natalia's renewal request, which she submitted just a few weeks later in November 2025.The event not only broke the rules about space and contact but also brought to light Kemp's ongoing fantasy of a romantic relationship, a theme that's been there since his first interactions five years ago.Also Read: Surprised Caitlin Clark gave 5 word reaction to Stephen Curry’s insane pregame shot",Natalia Bryant's restraining order against alleged stalker Dwayne Kemp has been extended.

when the Milwaukee Bucks host the Toronto Raptors on December 18 at Fiserv Forum. The Bucks officially ruled him out with a right calf strain, leaving the team without its best player for another important home game.Milwaukee Bucks have struggled to stay steady without Giannis Antetokounmpo this season, and his absence again puts the pressure on a roster already dealing with several injuries. The Bucks are looking for consistency, while the Raptors arrive knowing this is a chance to take advantage of a weakened opponent.The injury happened earlier this month against the Detroit Pistons. Giannis went down just minutes into the game after a non-contact play while making a pass. He was quickly ruled out, and the Bucks have been cautious since.This calf issue is the latest in a series of lower-body problems. Earlier in the season, Giannis missed four games with a left adductor strain, and the current injury brings back memories of the calf trouble that limited him during last spring’s playoffs. When he has been available, he has played at his usual level, averaging 30.6 points, 10.7 rebounds, and 6.4 assists.Without him, the Bucks have gone 2–8, and those losses have piled up quickly.Milwaukee Bucks’ problems extend beyond Giannis, with several rotation players either out or uncertain for the game.With Giannis Antetokounmpo sidelined, the Milwaukee Bucks will rely more on role players to carry the workload. Ryan Rollins is expected to see extended minutes, and AJ Green could take on a larger role if he is cleared. Even so, the Bucks’ record without Giannis shows how difficult it has been to fill that gap.Toronto comes into the game missing RJ Barrett, who remains out with a right knee sprain and has now missed nine straight games. Jakob Poeltl is listed as probable while managing a back issue, which gives the Raptors some stability inside.Also read: Is LaMelo Ball playing tonight vs the Atlanta Hawks?

New York Knicks Injury Report vs the Indiana Pacers (December 18, 2025)

Brunson and Towns power the offense

Indiana Pacers Injury Report vs the New York Knicks (December 18, 2025)

Who slows down Brunson?

New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers Game Outlook (December 18, 2025)

The New York Knicks travel to Indianapolis on December 18, 2025, in good form and with a cleaner injury report than their opponent, though late changes are still possible. Indiana continues to deal with multiple long-term absences, while New York is monitoring a few rotation players. Health and availability could still shape the night.The New York Knicks are 18-7 and have won six straight games, building momentum after their NBA Cup title run. Indiana sits at 6-20 and has struggled to find consistency as injuries have forced constant lineup changes. New York is a small road favorite at around 3.5 points, a reflection of both recent performance and the difference in stability between the two teams.Even with the recent run, New York Knicks’ injury report is busy. Six players are listed, including Karl-Anthony Towns, OG Anunoby, and Josh Hart. Anunoby is questionable with a left knee contusion, while Hart is also questionable due to a rectus abdominal issue, two situations that matter for a team built around wing defense.The strain on depth is already showing. Miles McBride (ankle) and Landry Shamet (shoulder) have missed time, leading to heavier minutes for Jalen Brunson, Mikal Bridges, and Towns.Nothing is overwhelming on its own, but it does force the Knicks to manage minutes while trying to keep their flow.Even with the questions, New York Knicks still has clear scoring punch. Jalen Brunson is in a strong stretch, putting up about 37.5 points and six assists in recent games while hitting close to four threes a night. The offense continues to run through him, especially in the pick-and-roll.When Karl-Anthony Towns is available, he stretches the floor in ways Indiana struggles to handle, particularly with the Pacers already thin up front. Mikal Bridges ties things together, scoring within the flow, rebounding, moving the ball, and guarding the top perimeter threat. That role becomes even more important if OG Anunoby or Josh Hart can’t go at full strength.Indiana Pacers’ season changed the moment Tyrese Haliburton went down. He is out for the year after right Achilles surgery, leaving the Pacers without their primary ball handler and organizer. Since then, the offense has shifted to a shared approach built around Pascal Siakam and Bennedict Mathurin, with Andrew Nembhard taking on more creation than planned.The injuries don’t stop there. Obi Toppin is expected to miss at least three months with a right foot stress fracture. Aaron Nesmith is sidelined with a left MCL sprain, and Ben Sheppard is out with a left calf strain. The absences have taken away size, shooting, and defensive options, forcing Indiana to patch together lineups on most nights.With Haliburton sidelined and wing depth depleted, Indiana Pacers’ ability to contain Brunson is a major question. Nembhard has been dealing with left calf soreness and has carried questionable tags recently, often playing through discomfort. Behind him, Rick Carlisle is forced to juggle limited guard depth, leaning on patched-together lineups and hoping to generate enough on-ball resistance.Indiana Pacers’ injuries have changed how they play. What was once a fast, transition-heavy team is now more reliant on half-court sets built around Pascal Siakam. With several defenders out, opponents can pack the paint and dare Indiana’s secondary shooters to make shots. For New York, the possible absence of OG Anunoby and Josh Hart would soften perimeter defense and likely push the Knicks toward lineups that lean more on scoring.Overall, the matchup favors New York. Look for early actions involving Jalen Brunson and Karl-Anthony Towns, steady pressure at the rim, and kick-out threes to Mikal Bridges and others. Indiana’s chance rests on big games from Siakam and Bennedict Mathurin, Andrew Nembhard keeping the offense steady despite his limitations, and one extra player stepping up to keep the game close late.","The New York Knicks are 18-7 and have won six straight games.

Patrick Mahomes’ injury changes everything for Kansas City

Chris Jones injury adds to Chiefs’ growing list of concerns

Chiefs' George Karlaftis on Patrick Mahomes injury: 'You could hear a pin drop in Arrowhead'

Also Read:

The Kansas City Chiefs’ nightmare 2025 season has taken yet another troubling turn, with Patrick Mahomes’ season-ending injury now symbolising a wider collapse for a franchise long accustomed to dominance. Already eliminated from playoff contention for the first time in the Mahomes era, the Chiefs are now grappling with a growing injury list that has raised serious questions about how they navigate the final stretch of the season.Mahomes’ torn ACL, confirmed earlier this week, effectively ended Kansas City’s hopes of salvaging pride from what was expected to be another Super Bowl-contending campaign. The injury not only sidelined the league’s most influential quarterback but also exposed the fragile state of a roster that has been stretched thin on both sides of the ball.For the first time in years, the Chiefs are being forced to imagine life without Mahomes under center, a reality that has arrived suddenly and at the worst possible moment.Adding to the concerns, the Chiefs announced on Wednesday that defensive lineman Chris Jones was limited in practice due to a hamstring injury. Jones has been the backbone of Kansas City’s defence and a key locker-room leader, making his status particularly significant at a time when the team can ill afford further setbacks.The injury report painted a worrying picture. Alongside Jones, several core contributors failed to practice, including Leo Chenal, Trent McDuffie, Rashee Rice, Jaylon Moore, Jawaan Taylor and Tyquan Thornton. With injuries cutting across the secondary, offensive line and receiving corps, the Chiefs’ depth is being tested in ways rarely seen under head coach Andy Reid.Defensive end George Karlaftis admitted that the absence of Mahomes has changed the atmosphere within the team. Speaking after practice, he described the adjustment as “different,” noting that it was the first time he had arrived at the facility without seeing Mahomes’ presence.Still, Karlaftis struck a resilient tone, insisting that the “next man up” mentality would guide the team through the remaining games as younger players are asked to shoulder increased responsibility.With Mahomes sidelined, Gardner Minshew is set to take over at quarterback as Kansas City prepares for a Week 16 matchup against the Tennessee Titans, followed by divisional clashes against the Denver Broncos and Las Vegas Raiders.While the Chiefs are no longer in the playoff race, these games now carry significance for roster evaluation and future planning.",Patrick Mahomes’ season-ending injury now symbolises a wider collapse for a franchise long accustomed to dominance.

Golden State Warriors vs Phoenix Suns game outlook (December 18, 2025)

The Golden State Warriors visit the Phoenix Suns tonight at Footprint Center with both teams looking to stop short losing runs. Golden State sits at 13-14, while Phoenix is slightly ahead at 14-12. With the Western Conference tightly packed, neither side has much room to slip further before the schedule turns toward the end of December.This is the second meeting between the teams this season. The Warriors won the first matchup on November 4 by a score of 118-107, with Stephen Curry and Devin Booker combining for 66 points. That result still lingers, especially with both teams hovering around the playoff line and trying to build momentum.Golden State Warriors’ injury list is brief but affects rotation depth. Al Horford remains out with right sciatic nerve irritation, an issue that has kept him off the floor during the team’s recent struggles. Pat Spencer is also unavailable for personal reasons.The rest of the rotation is intact. Curry is fully cleared after dealing with a quad contusion earlier this month. Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green, and Brandin Podziemski are all available, leaving the Warriors heavily reliant on their main group rather than bench contributions.Phoenix Suns enter the night with more uncertainty. Grayson Allen is listed as questionable with right knee soreness. He has started every game he has played this season and averages 11.5 points and 5.5 assists, making his status important for the Suns’ spacing and ball movement.Isaiah Livers is also questionable due to a right hip strain. Jalen Green remains out with a right hamstring injury and has appeared in only five quarters all season, as the team continues to avoid another setback. Koby Brea is out, while Jordan Goodwin is expected to play despite a jaw sprain and will wear a protective mask.With limited depth on both sides, the game is likely to be driven by starters and late-game execution. Golden State Warriors will lean on Curry’s shooting and Butler’s all-around role, while Phoenix counters with Booker and Dillon Brooks, who is expected to spend much of the night defending Curry.Golden State enters as a narrow 1.5-point road favorite, with the total set at 230.5. Both teams are close to .500, and with the standings tightening, this game carries weight beyond a typical December matchup. A win offers breathing room. A loss adds pressure heading into the holiday stretch.","Golden State Warriors host Phoenix Suns at Footprint Center (December 18, 2025) Stephen Curry is fully cleared after dealing with a quad contusion earlier this month.

He finished the year with 67 receptions, 797 receiving yards, and five touchdowns.Those numbers led analysts to question how much longer he wants to continue playing at a high level.Former NFL wide receiver Chris Carter also weighed in recently, saying Kelce should consider stepping away before his performance drops further.","Travis Kelce has not officially announced retirement.

Shashi Tharoor vs Rajeev Shukla breaks out on India match in Lucknow

Poll Who do you think should replace Shubman Gill in the T20I lineup against New Zealand? Yashasvi Jaiswal Sanju Samson Rinku Singh Ruturaj Gaikwad

LUCKNOW: While Shubman Gill’s latest injury has disrupted India’s immediate plans, it has simultaneously created an opportunity for the team management to experiment within the T20I setup.The toe injury, while unfortunate for the stylish opener, has inadvertently cleared the deck for the think-tank to stress-test the bench strength not just for the T20I series finale against South Africa in Ahmedabad, but crucially for the five-match T20I series against New Zealand slated for January next year.Sources indicate that the selection committee, along with the team management, wants to leverage this enforced absence to firm up the batting combination.One selector, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the upcoming New Zealand T20Is demand a proactive approach, adding that every available game before Feb 2026 should effectively be treated as an extended trial.The primary beneficiary of Gill’s absence is likely to be Yashasvi Jaiswal . The southpaw has been waiting in the wings, his aggressive intent in the Powerplay viewed by many as the perfect template for modern T20 cricket.However, he isn’t the only name floating. Insiders reveal that there is a strong temptation to revive the option of Sanju Samson returning to the opening slot. Samson, whose career has often been a game of snakes and ladders, offers a destructive capacity in the Powerplay that the management values highly, especially on the batting-friendly Indian tracks.Samson and Abhishek Sharma formed a potent, aggressive T20I opening pair for India, scoring 267 runs in 12 innings at a high run-rate of 9.82 (averaging 22.25).The intrigue, however, isn’t limited to the opening slot. Perhaps the most significant development brewing in the corridors of the selection committee is the potential recalibration of KL Rahul’s role. Reports emerging suggest that Rahul is being seriously considered for a middle-order wicketkeeper-batter slot. The logic is sound: with the top heavy with explosive talent, the team requires a seasoned hand in the middle overs who can arrest a collapse or accelerate at will. Sources indicate that the management is eager to see if Rahul can replicate his ODI utility in the shortest format.Rinku Singh’s name, too, is doing the rounds after his omission from the South Africa T20Is. Dropped more due to combinations than form, Rinku remains highly rated internally for his composure under pressure and clarity in finishing roles.Furthermore, the swashbuckling century by Ruturaj Gaikwad in the recently concluded ODI series against South Africa has not gone unnoticed. While he is naturally an opener, his ability to adapt to game situations makes him a dark horse in these deliberations.In contrast, the bowling department appears largely settled, offering the team management a sense of continuity. The presence of seam-bowling allrounders Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube provides invaluable balance, effectively giving the captain the luxury of choosing between an extra pacer or spinner based on conditions. Their roles also cushion the impact of batting experiments, allowing India to field deeper line-ups without sacrificing bowling options.Axar Patel’s illness, however, has briefly unsettled that equilibrium. His absence has brought another left-arm spin-bowling allrounder Shahbaz Ahmed back into the picture after a prolonged period on the fringes. Shahbaz’s domestic performances have been gritty, but the hierarchy seems clear. It is Washington Sundar who is poised to get the first look-in. Washington’s Powerplay bowling prowess and his improved batting chops make him the like-for-like replacement for the balance the team seeks.",Shubman Gill's latest injury has created an opportunity for the team management to experiment within the T20I setup.
