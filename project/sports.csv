T20 World Cup: Can Hardik Pandya still be a game-changer?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/t20-world-cup-can-hardik-pandya-still-be-a-game-changer/articleshow/110608403.cms,"The mercurial allrounder, who suffered a torrid & controversial

as the new

captain, needs to put his recent travails behind him & rise to the occasion in the

T20 World Cup

...

In the World Cup, will Hardik Pandya find himself on the crest or in the trough of his rollercoaster career? The Pandya situation is no doubt being handled with utmost care in the Team India camp right now. Coach Rahul Dravid and captain Rohit Sharma will be eager to get the best out of one of India's most important T20 contributors and the only true seam-bowling allrounder in the ranks.Pandya is also vice-captain of the team, another appointment dogged by controversy and mired in innuendo, like everything else with the cricketer lately. It's not Pandya's credentials that are under the scanner. He has been retained in Grade A in the BCCI 's central contracts list in spite of recurring injuries since 2018. Having played only in the IPL following an ankle injury during the ODI World Cup late last year, the entire focus should have been on the cricketer's quest to regain peak fitness in time for the big one.Instead, his world seems to be unravelling around him.Both Pandya's private life and public persona have come under such intense scrutiny in recent times that often, from the outside, it has seemed things are at breaking point. It's a curious turn of events for one of the most colourful, exciting and emotional cricketers India has ever produced, one who possesses both rare skill and naked ambition.Since he burst on to the scene for Mumbai Indians in 2015, Pandya has not shied away from showcasing the kind of swagger that can attract the wrong kind of attention. People may scoff at his extravagant ways but having seen some real hard times growing up, Pandya is entitled to live it up if he wants to. He has chosen to be all flash and glitter. He has lived life on his terms.At times that has got him into trouble too, like when he was suspended for some ill-conceived comments on a TV talk show. This recent implosion in the Mumbai Indians camp and the hostility of spectators, however, has been particularly unsettling to watch. Fans across venues have raged against Pandya and rained slurs on him. They seemed incensed by Pandya's switch from Gujarat Titans and the dethroning of the more popular Rohit Sharma as Mumbai Indians captain.Then again, the trigger may well be Hardik's loud public persona.Either way you see it, this public castigation of Pandya across stadiums has showcased the worst of the IPL's oddball fan-loyalties at play.It could also be the management's choice to overlook the optics altogether. CSK, after all, underwent a similar transition and there wasn't a peep from the crowds. Cricketers routinely switch club loyalties in the auction process and there is no outcry. To the fans, the MI captaincy swap may have seemed like a midnight coup.The appointment as MI captain seemed plagued with trouble from the start. The likes of Suryakumar Yadav and Jasprit Bumrah - among four players from the MI setup in the World Cup squad - have seemingly, in cryptic social-media posts, expressed displeasure at being overlooked. It seemed even Rohit Sharma, having been named India's captain for the T20 World Cup in a surprise return to the old guard, had been caught unawares.Many ex-cricketers thought Pandya was faking and blustering his way through the doomed campaign, that his leadership style was muddled. Kevin Pietersen said Pandya was ""smiling too much"" and ""trying to act like he's happy"" when ""everything away from the game was affecting him so much"". Graeme Smith said MI have been a ""very confused team"".Pandya may have thought he was the most hated Indian cricketer ever. There may have been moments when he lost direction.After a loss to CSK, Pandya alluded to Dhoni's presence in the opposition and said, ""There's a man behind the stumps who tells them what's working."" This spurred Adam Gilchrist to say, ""That line about Dhoni is interesting. It tells that maybe Pandya is feeling a bit of a lone wolf.""AB de Villiers said he loved Pandya but ""his captaincy style is quite bravado. It's ego-driven, chest out"".Perhaps Pandya was too abrasive for Mumbai Indians, even though the style may have worked at Gujarat Titans. The public criticism of Tilak Varma for not taking on DC's Axar Patel and whispers of an alleged dressing room showdown did not help either. MI coach Mark Boucher admitted in the end that all the happenings may have ""clouded"" Pandya.All chief selector Ajit Agarkar would say about Pandya's selection is, ""The good part we have looked at is that he has got through all the games so far for MI.""That, however, doesn't answer the question - is Pandya in the best frame of mind to perform at his peak in a tournament like this? The relentless antagonism from spectators also spurred an ongoing social-media trial that puts him under immense pressure to perform in the World Cup.In one of his rare moments of candour, Pandya said, ""We've seen better days but seen worse days as well. I don't think these things surprise me anymore.""If there's one cricketer who swears by his resilience, it's Hardik Pandya. His first post after joining the India squad in the US contained the words: ""On national duty.""Remember, India have had alleged flare-ups between captain and vice-captain in a T20 World Cup before, back in 2009, when Dhoni paraded the whole team in front of the media to quell reports of a rift in the team.This time, the calming presence of both Rohit and Dravid may serve to erase any lingering bitterness. Team India needs Pandya to step up to win the World Cup. He was, after all, their best performer with the bat in that semifinal defeat to England in Adelaide in 2022.",Hardik Pandya's world seems to be unravelling around him. Fans across venues have raged against Pandya and rained slurs on him. Pandya has been retained in Grade A in the BCCI's central contracts list in spite of recurring injuries since 2018.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110608384,imgsize-46412,width-400,resizemode-4/110608384.jpg"

With the ninth edition of the Men's T20 World Cup less than 24 hours away, the match central to discussions in the final countdown before the start of the tournament is India vs Pakistan on June 9 in New York With USA welcoming and co-hosting a big-ticket cricket tournament for the first time on its soil that is dominated by baseball and basketball, there can't be a bigger advertisement of the game than witnessing the sport's traditional rivals India and Pakistan facing off.In its build-up to the start of the tournament, the event's official broadcaster Star Sports had World Cup winners Harbhajan Singh, Irfan Pathan and Misbah-ul-Haq sharing their two cents on the tournament as a whole and the mouth-watering India vs Pakistan clash at the Nasau Country International Cricket Stadium.When asked who could be the biggest threat for Pakistan, Misbah, who was the captain of the side that lost to India in the 2007 T20 World Cup final, didn't mince words in saying: ""Sabse badi rukawat tohVirat Kohli honge (Virat will be the biggest obstacle).""India take on Pakistan are clubbed in Group A along with co-hosts USA, Canada, and Ireland.

In that, sabse badi rukawat to Virat Kohli honge,"" Misbah further said on the show.""He (Kohli) is one player who has time and again in difficult situations, even if you talk about the last World Cup, snatched the game out of the opposition's hand. Such players are always dangerous. You have to think first about that. Paksitan will now that.""Misbah also named the bowler he think will leave the biggest imapct in this edition of the T20 World Cup.""Bowling mei ek naam aisa hai...jo ki ek experienced campaigner hai, mujhe boht pasand hai as a bowler, woh hai Jasprit Bumrah (In bowling, there is one name, an experienced campaigner who I like personally as a bowler, that is Bumrah),"" said the ex-Pakistan skipper.""In limited-overs formats, the way he bowls with the new ball and the old ball, he will definitely leave an impact. He can play a key role for India...initial punch toh wohi maar sakte hain Pakistan ko (Bumrah can deliver the opening punch).""","The ninth edition of the Men's T20 World Cup is less than 24 hours away.

Wicketkeeper Azam Khan got brutally roasted online after his flop show on Pakistan 's tour of England continued in the fourth T20I, which the visitors lost by seven wickets in London on Thursday, but the team, led by skipper Babar Azam , put its arm around the young player to motivate and comfort him.Khan scored a five-ball duck and then dropped a couple of catches, which led to him getting trolled on social media for his uninspiring performance with both bat and as a wicketkeeper.However, in a video posted on microblogging social media platform 'X', captain Babar could be seen walking up to Khan, who stood dejected close to the stumps, and motivated the 25-year-old with a pat on his back and a few encouraging words.After the match, the troll army went on to question Khan's selection in the national team and the fitness of the heavyset cricketer.In the fourth T20I, Pakistan were bowled out for 157 and England chased down the target comfortably to win the series with 27 balls to spare.The defeat meant Pakistan lost the four-match series 2-0 as the hosts won the first and the last match, while the games in Leeds and Cardiff were washed out.Both the teams will now fly out to the US for the T20 World Cup, where England will try to defend their title.","Wicketkeeper Azam Khan got brutally roasted online after his flop show on Pakistan's tour of England.

"'Selectors have trusted Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli but...': Sanjay Manjrekar says he 'would not have gone that way' this time",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/selectors-have-trusted-rohit-sharma-virat-kohli-but-sanjay-manjrekar-says-he-would-not-have-gone-that-way-this-time/articleshow/110600235.cms,"(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar suggests that opting for a younger Indian squad for the T20 World Cup might have been more advantageous, considering the previous lack of success with senior players.He advocates for injecting youthful talent like Yashaswi Jaiswal into the mix, rather than solely relying on experienced players.Despite the absence of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli from many T20 matches last year, selectors have chosen to reinstate them, presumably banking on their experience.Manjrekar notes that the default opening pair now appears to be Rohit and Kohli, whereas he would have preferred exploring alternatives, such as incorporating the promising Jaiswal.""Ideally, I would not have gone that way; I would have stuck with a slightly more younger kind of, core set of players but the selectors have committed themselves to the icons, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli,"" Manjrekar said on Star Sports' Press Room World Cup edition on Friday.""Now that they are in the squad, it's impossible to have Virat Kohli batting at No. 3 because then you don't get the full rally of Virat. Rohit Sharma has to open, so now, India in a way have forced themselves to have only one kind of combination - two right-handers,"" he said.Manjrekar doubts that Yashaswi Jaiswal would secure a spot in the Indian XI.""Unfortunately, Jaiswal will have to sit out. I would have gone completely with a new lot (and) then he would have had a lot more flair and it would be something different,"" he said.""(But) India have trusted the seniors a move that hasn't worked over the years let's hope it works this time,"" Manjrekar added.The former Indian batter also rejected the idea that Mohammed Amir and Shaheen Shah Afridi would present a significant threat to the Indian batters in the upcoming clash between the two arch-rivals on June 9th.""Mohammed Amir played his last international T20 seven years back. We have no idea what his form is like today. Shaheen Afridi is not the same bowler that he was two years ago.""India have handled him really well, if you remember the Asia Cup, even in the 50-overs World Cup we had a one-sided match. I do not see Pakistan as a major threat to India, plus the names (of) Mohammed Amir and Shaheen Shah Afridi. I do not think this is a problem for India,"" he added.Meanwhile, Irfan Pathan labeled left-arm spinner Imad Wasim as a potential threat.""As a left-arm spinner with the new ball, he is not bad. He is a smart, bowls stumps to stumps and if the ball grips then he could be a threat,"" he said.Manjrekar expressed confidence in Hardik Pandya 's ability to excel as a finisher.""My vote will always go to Hardik Pandya. I know he had a pretty quiet IPL, but go back to the last T20 World Cup that India played, the last match, semis against England at Adelaide.""Hardik Pandya got 60 off 30 balls at a strike rate of 190 after India had got 62 in their first 10 overs.""When it comes to T20 World Cup - marquee events - back those guys who actually excel on the big stage and for me it will always be Hardik Pandya and Rishabh Pant ahead of people like Shivam Dubey, until we see him on the big stage,"" he said.Pathan mentioned that both Pandya and Dube would fulfill distinct roles in the competition.""Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube will play different roles. Hardik will have a set role to finish the game and Shivam will play as a floater, as a reinforcer against the spinners,"" he said.Manjrekar highlighted India's cautious approach in the first round of the tournament, drawing parallels to their early exit in the 2007 50-overs World Cup in the Caribbean.""India will feel the pressure of the first round because (in) 2007 (in) the West Indies, funny things (had) happened. I see India up and running very quickly. (But) I'm just going to watch this Indian team in the matches that matter - semis and the finals,"" he said.""For India, World Cups are not anymore about getting into the final round. It's about what you do in the final rounds,"" he added.Manjrekar also asserted that Kohli tends to face extra pressure in knockout games because of his stature, a situation not mirrored by Rohit.""Virat does take it upon himself. You see that happening in all the big games to bat a little longer, perhaps feels obliged because of the kind of stature that he has in Indian cricket to bat longer rather than just come and bat freely,"" he said.""But Rohit Sharma will do that, no matter his stature. We saw that in the ODI World Cup. But I'm worried about Virat really when it comes to semis and the finals,"" he added.","Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar suggests that opting for a younger Indian squad for the T20 World Cup might have been more advantageous.

'I prefer Arshdeep over Siraj in the death because of...': RP Singh on India's fast-bowling combination in T20 World Cup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/i-prefer-arshdeep-over-siraj-in-the-death-because-of-rp-singh-on-indias-fast-bowling-combination-in-t20-world-cup/articleshow/110598340.cms,"(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Former India pacer Rudra Pratap Singh believes that Punjab Kings didn't utilise young Arshdeep Singh effectively during the recently concluded IPL. However, he thinks that the left-arm pacer can prove to be very effective during the death overs at the T20 World Cup , especially alongside Jasprit Bumrah .Arshdeep managed to secure 19 wickets from 14 games in IPL, but his economy rate of 10.03, largely due to facing 'impact player' onslaughts, left him somewhat disheartened. RP Singh , who was India's bowling hero in the 2007 T20 World Cup in South Africa, stated his preference for Arshdeep over Mohammed Siraj for the upcoming tournament.""If we assess Arshdeep on the basis of his IPL performance, I think he hasn't been utilised well,"" RP Singh made these comments in response to a PTI query during a promotional event where the Indian team's jersey was unveiled for the inaugural World Championship of Legends.""The utilisation of the bowlers also depends on their captain, in which conditions he uses them, in which situation he makes them bowl and how best that he thinks his bowler is.""RP Singh feels that the wicket at Nassau County will be on the slower side and suggests that Arshdeep, instead of bowling pacey length deliveries, should focus on using cutters effectively.""Talking about the length on the tracks in the USA during an early morning start, as per my understanding, there should be a bit of slowness in the wicket. So, the ideal length will be somewhere around just short of good length.""There will be not a lot of swing for the bowlers but the bowlers with variations, not only just yorkers but also slower ones, leg and off cutters. These deliveries will be utilised a bit more by Arshdeep, so the success rate will be automatically higher for him and that's what I understand about the wickets in the US.""RP also believes that Jasprit Bumrah should ideally bowl three overs in the back-10, as it would apply significant pressure on the opposition batting unit.""Death bowling is really important in T20 cricket. Bumrah may bowl three overs in the death overs. He is our mainstay there. My preference alongside Bumrah in the death is Arshdeep over Siraj because of the variations he has. I think Siraj can be impactful in a game when he is bowling with the new ball. Otherwise, it should be Bumrah and Arshdeep.""Arshdeep's left-arm action naturally creates challenging angles for right-handed batsmen, making him a crucial asset. Having another left-armer like Khaleel Ahmed in the World T20 reserves adds depth to the bowling unit.""Left arm pacers are always an advantage especially against right-handed batters. It is not like two or more left-arm seamers can't play together. Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra and I have played in multiple games together.""For achieving the perfect balance, it's crucial for Hardik Pandya to bowl his full quota of overs. This would provide the team with the flexibility to field three specialist spinners, potentially allowing Yuzvendra Chahal to join Kuldeep Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja in the playing eleven.""Hardik bowled in the IPL and bowled four overs so there's no injury scare. Hardik's bowling will be important and he will have to bowl all his quota of 4-overs. If Shivam Dube bowls too, then it will be an added advantage for India ahead.""Shivam may not play some matches initially but whenever he plays, he will perform well and score runs for India.""","Former India pacer Rudra Pratap Singh believes that Punjab Kings didn't utilise young Arshdeep Singh effectively during the recently concluded IPL.

'Team ka satyanash kar diya hai': Ramiz Raja pulls no punches after Pakistan's T20I series loss against England,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/team-ka-satyanash-kar-diya-hai-ramiz-raja-pulls-no-punches-after-pakistans-t20i-series-loss-against-england/articleshow/110599249.cms,"(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Ramiz Raja , the former chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ), criticized the team's management after their 2-0 loss in the T20I series against England, which took place right before the T20 World Cup.In the 4th T20I at Kennington Oval, England dominated Pakistan in every aspect of the game, successfully chasing down a target of 158 with more than four overs remaining.Pakistan's performance was hindered by a lack of power in their middle order and the absence of magic from their pace bowlers while defending their target.Ramiz expressed his worries about the experimentation within Pakistan's white-ball setup. He once again castigated the management for the repercussions that have resulted from their decision to experiment.""They should stop experimenting with the team. Go into a game with a proper combination. You need to get out of the phobia of strike rate because you don't have that kind of players. Aapne is team ka satyanash kar diya hai (You have completely made a cock-up of this team),"" Ramiz said on his YouTube channel.Ramiz has openly expressed his views regarding the decision to introduce Saim Ayub as an opening batsman. This change in the batting lineup disrupted the highly successful partnership betweenBabar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan , which was implemented during Mohammad Hafeez's brief tenure as the director of cricket for Pakistan.Since Ayub's inclusion at the top of the batting order, his performance has been underwhelming. Moreover, Pakistan's middle-order batsmen have also encountered difficulties in accumulating runs during crucial moments of the game, further compounding the team's batting woes.""You have ruined the team by breaking the opening pair (of Babar and Rizwan). The role of the middle order is not defined. You have put all-rounders in the middle and two wicket-keepers are playing. You are changing the fast bowlers. Your spinners don't spin the ball and don't have the confidence. You put Imad Wasim out of the playing XI. There is no sideways movement and you have completely dismantled the team just before the T20 World Cup,"" he added.In the recent T20I series against New Zealand, Ayub faced a tough time finding his form initially. However, he displayed promising improvement by delivering a brisk innings of 45 runs off 29 balls in the first match. Throughout the four matches against the Blackcaps, the 21-year-old managed to accumulate 52 runs at an average of 14.25, with his highest score being 32 in the series.Before Ayub's inclusion, Babar and Rizwan had been the mainstays as openers for the Pakistani team, forming one of the most formidable opening partnerships in T20Is. Their partnership reached new heights during the last Men's T20I World Cup in 2022, where they notably shared a record-breaking 105-run stand. This was their third century partnership in the tournament, highlighting their exceptional chemistry and batting prowess.Heading into the upcoming tournament, Pakistan finds itself placed in Group A, alongside notable competitors like arch-rival India, as well as Canada, USA, and Ireland. Their journey kicks off with a match against co-hosts USA at the Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas, scheduled for Thursday.","Ramiz Raja criticizes Pakistan's decision to introduce Saim Ayub as an opening batsman.

Narine regained his magical touch this season, scoring 488 runs and taking 17 wickets throughout the tournament.In a recent interaction with Sportskeeda, Gambhir spoke about his camaraderie with Narine and reminisced about the latter's early days in the KKR camp.Gambhir, who captained KKR to their IPL victories in 2012 and 2014, highlighted Narine’s crucial role in those triumphs.""Me and Narine are similar characters, and so are our emotions. I still remember that when Narine first came into the IPL in 2012, it was in Jaipur, and we were going for practice, and I told him to come join for lunch. He was so shy that he did not say a single word during lunch, and the first question that he eventually asked was, 'Can I bring my girlfriend to the IPL?',"" Gambhir recalled.Gambhir suggested that he and Narine share a special bond, describing the all-rounder as a brother.""He was so quiet that first season, but now, we can talk about anything. He is like a brother to me. I don't see him as a friend, I don't see him as a teammate, I see him as a brother. If I need him or he needs me, I think we are just one call away, that is the sort of relationship that we have built. We do not get excited much, we do not show too many emotions, we are not flamboyant, we just do the job and come back,"" he added.Gambhir also emphasized Narine’s consistent value to KKR, asserting that he has always been the team's 'MVP'.""What can I say about him? Even if he didn't win the 'most valuable player award' he would have still been the MVP. You are looking at his stats but he was KKR's MVP even before the season got underway. The world has seen his talent as an all-rounder and I'm sure that Narine still has plenty to give to KKR and world cricket,"" Gambhir explained.","Kolkata Knight Riders mentor Gautam Gambhir has heaped praise on star all- rounder Sunil Narine.

NEW DELHI: Star Indian batter Virat Kohli has expressed his views on the growing impact of cricket in the United States, as the country prepares to co-host the upcoming T20 World Cup with the West Indies.In recent years, cricket has seen a significant rise in popularity in the USA. Major League Cricket ( MLC ) has played a pivotal role in this growth.Recently, MLC became the second Associate Franchise Tournament, after the United Arab Emirates' International League T20, to gain List A status from the International Cricket Council ( ICC ).With the T20 World Cup on the horizon, cricket fever has taken hold in the USA, attracting a surge of interest in the sport. Speaking ahead of the tournament, Kohli shared his thoughts on cricket's expansion in the USA, admitting that he never expected to play any format of the game in the country.""Honestly, I never thought that we would be playing cricket in any form in the States. But now it's a reality. That tells you about the growing impact of the sport in the world. The United States is more than willing to accept the change and be probably the first one on a global scale to accept it in a way with the World Cup, which is I think it's a great start. It's the ideal way to begin. So I think it's going to have a huge impact,"" Kohli said in a video posted by the US Consulate Mumbai on X.MLC's debut season in 2023 revolutionized the landscape of American cricket, introducing world-class domestic T20 action to the United States for the first time. Most of the matches were played in front of sold-out crowds in Texas and North Carolina.Following the successful conclusion of MLC's inaugural season, the second season is set to feature top stars from cricket's powerhouse nations.Kohli discussed the influence of MLC and its potential to spark interest in cricket among fans.""In starting off a kind of a domino effect and I hope that it carries on for a long period of time. We have enough people as I said from our regions to keep the game up and alive in the States and make the others more aware about what it feels like to play cricket and watch cricket. I think it's got great potential with the MLC as well. There's already franchise cricket happening there. So I think it's moving in the right direction.""Washington Freedom will feature a strong Australian lineup in the upcoming season, with top players such as Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell , Travis Head, and coach Ricky Ponting joining the franchise.The San Francisco Unicorns will be strengthened by the inclusion of hard-hitting New Zealand opener Finn Allen.",Virat Kohli has expressed his views on the growing impact of cricket in the United States.

They played against Ireland and suffered a defeat. Things change during the World Cup. The match is always high-voltage so there is a lot of pressure on the players. Indians' performance in the World Cup has always been good. We just lost one match last time, and were dominant throughout,"" RP Singh told the media during the jersey launch of the World Championship of Legends team India Champions.The intensity of the players' stress and the fans' passionate involvement were palpable during their last World Cup match.Pakistan had a commanding lead over India in the 2022 game.

All of Australia's matches will take place in the Caribbean. The tournament presents a unique opportunity for Australia to achieve a remarkable feat in cricket.The 37-year-old Warner is among a select group of four players, including Pat Cummins , Mitchell Starc , and Travis Head , who have the chance to become the first team in history to simultaneously hold three International Cricket Council trophies, having already won the World Test Championship and ODI World Cup in the past year.""Being part of that potential history, you only sit back and reflect on those things when you're completely done and dusted,"" Warner, who is in Trinidad, said as quoted by The Sydney Morning Herald. ""I did an interview with the ICC recently asking me about it and all the tournaments I've been a part of, and I can't remember them all, but it's been great,"" he added.However, he continues to hint that it may not be the end, referencing the ICC's revived Champions Trophy, a mini-World Cup scheduled to be held in Pakistan next year.""They may not need me,"" he added with a laugh.Warner was forced to miss the remainder of the Indian Premier League (IPL) this season due to an injury to his left hand. Despite this setback, he showcased his readiness by scoring an impressive 54 runs off just 21 deliveries in a practice game against Namibia held in Trinidad last week.Warner, however, will not be participating in any matches until Australia's opening encounter against Oman, which is scheduled to take place in Barbados on Thursday.Warner's journey towards bidding farewell to the grand stage has been quite remarkable. In November, Australia emerged victorious against India in India to clinch the ODI World Cup title. Later, in January, he bid adieu to traditional cricket during the Sydney Test match. It is highly anticipated that he will make his final appearance in T20 internationals while playing in the Caribbean.Regardless of when the star batsman decides to hang up his boots, one thing is certain: Warner will undoubtedly give his all and go out with a bang, no matter which team he faces in his final moments on the cricket field.""We've always played fearless and I think that's why we've been so successful over the last few years. We don't care about our spot in a team, we just care about doing the best that we can, and making sure that whatever we're doing, we're trying to be that match winner,"" he said.""And the fortunate thing is that we've got so many of them. One might come off one day, the next day someone else will come off. So we just know that one person in that top six, if they can get anywhere between 60 to 80 runs at a good strike rate, we know we're always going to post a good total. It's the same with the new ball. If Starcy [Mitchell Starc] is swinging the ball, we'll get early wickets, and that brings the spinners into the game,"" he added.Warner is confident that Australia's resounding triumph against India in the World Cup late last year, coupled with their impressive showing versus South Africa in the semi-final, has provided them with a psychological advantage over their competitors.""If you look at the way that we performed with our backs up against the wall after the first couple of games [losing badly to India and South Africa], you just never count us out,"" he said.",Australian batsman David Warner has announced his retirement from international cricket. The 37-year-old has not completely ruled out the possibility of returning for the 2025 Champions Trophy if the Australian team requires an opening batsman.

After the stalemate in extra time, the fate of the match was decided by a penalty shootout.Although both teams missed their initial attempts, Ronaldo converted his penalty. However, Al-Hilal emerged victorious as Bounou saved crucial penalties from Ali Al-Hassan and Al-Nemer, securing their 11th King’s Cup title.For Ronaldo and his team, the wait for silverware continues into the next season.","Al-Nassr lost 5-4 on penalties to Al-Hilal in the King's Cup final in Jeddah.

NEW DELHI: India goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu emphasized the need for other players to step up and lead the national team forward following the retirement of iconic captain and striker Sunil Chhetri . As the team convened for training ahead of the crucial World Cup qualifier against Kuwait on June 6, which marks Chhetri's final international appearance, Sandhu expressed the responsibility lying on the players to fill the void left by the departing legend.During a media interaction at the National Centre of Excellence, Sandhu stated, ""The onus is on the players to take up the mantle. Eventually, this was going to happen, and we have to learn to cope without him (Chhetri). We have also experienced playing without Sunil Bhai in some matches in the past. It's not that we have done really badly; we need to manage things without him. New players need to show up and take the nation forward.""India notably secured a goal-less draw against formidable opponents Qatar, the two-time Asian Cup champions, in a 2022 World Cup qualifying round match in September 2019, when Chhetri was absent due to illness.Chhetri, with 94 goals from 150 matches spanning a remarkable 19-year career, currently ranks as the third leading active international goal scorer, behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi .Sandhu acknowledged the enormity of Chhetri's legacy, stating, ""In my personal opinion, it's impossible to replicate what Sunil Bhai has done in these years.

However, subsequent performances included a 0-3 defeat to Qatar and mixed results against Afghanistan.Currently placed second in Group A with four points, India aims to secure a spot in the next AFC Asian Cup and advance to the third round of World Cup qualifiers under the guidance of coach Igor Stimac . This achievement would mark a significant milestone for Indian football , promising further challenges and opportunities on the international stage.Gurpreet reiterated the importance of maintaining normalcy and consistent preparation, expressing hope that Chhetri's winning goal against Kuwait would serve as a fitting farewell.""Everything is pretty normal, and we are keeping it that way. Trying to do something out of the ordinary would only distract people.""I'm sure Sunil Bhai shares the same philosophy: keep it normal and prepare in the best manner possible. Hopefully, we will see him scoring the winning goal against Kuwait, that will be the most special moment for us,"" he said.He emphasized that Chhetri's final appearance in India colors should be celebrated by all, acknowledging his significant contribution to Indian football.""I've been fortunate enough to enjoy the majority of my career alongside him. Working behind him for matches has always been an honor.""Now, we're trying to focus on the game and the opposition to secure a result.
