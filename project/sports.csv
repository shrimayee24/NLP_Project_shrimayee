Tampa Bay Rays’ Wander Franco was involved in the trafficking of a 14 year old girl and was helped by the victim’s mother



The Tampa Bay Rays’ Wander Franco was once considered to be a pretty promising player in the team and his fans had huge hopes from the star player until it all came crashing down a year ago when he was accused of sexually assaulting a minor in the Dominican Republic. This news had sent shockwaves across the league and here is everything that happened.Wander Franco was 17 years old when he signed a deal with the Tampa Bay Rays for a whopping signing bonus of $3.85 million. He was also ranked as one of the top international prospects in the 2017 international class.All was going well for the Tampa Bay Rays’ Wander Franco and he even ended up tying the knot with his wife in 2021 after the two became parents to two boys in 2018 and 2022.While Wander Franco’s career in the MLB was just taking off, when on 9th July 2024, he was charged with allegations of human trafficking , sexual exploitation of a minor and sexual abuse in the Dominican Republic.The MLB had immediately suspended him and also reacted to the whole scandal. Last year, the league issued an official statement that read as, “We are aware of the charges against Mr. Franco. Our investigation remains open, and we will continue to closely monitor the case as it moves forward.”On 26th June 2025, the Tampa Bay Rays’ Wander Franco was found guilty in the Dominican Republic and the young player received a suspended sentence of two years in prison.As per reports, Wander Franco was accused of being in a sexual relationship with a 14 year old girl when he was 21 years old. The young victim’s mother, Martha Vanessa Chevalier Almonte, was also convicted and has been sentenced to 10 years in prison.Apparently, the prosecutors were able to prove that the victim’s mother had gained a considerable amount of money by trafficking her young daughter to Wander Franco.With this, Wander Franco’s visa issue remains complicated as he has not been able to play in the league since 2023.Also Read: MLB fan sparks outrage after being removed from stadium for interfering with the match in Diamondbacks vs. Giants game","Tampa Bay Rays’ Wander Franco was involved in the trafficking of a 14 year old girl.

Brock Boeser turned down bigger Maple Leafs offer to stay loyal to Canucks in $50.75M deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/brock-boeser-turned-down-bigger-maple-leafs-offer-to-stay-loyal-to-canucks-in-50-75m-deal/articleshow/122259529.cms,"Brock Boeser declined a potentially richer offer from the Toronto Maple Leafs (Getty Images)

Toronto’s short-term money couldn’t match Vancouver’s long-term commitment

Canucks’ top-line trust and legacy role likely influenced his decision

In a surprising twist to the NHL offseason, Vancouver Canucks forward Brock Boeser has reportedly turned down a more lucrative contract offer from the Toronto Maple Leafs to stay in Vancouver. The decision, revealed by NHL insider Nick Kypreos in the Toronto Star, reinforces Boeser’s deep-rooted loyalty to the team he has called home for nine seasons.As the Maple Leafs reshaped their roster after trading Mitch Marner to the Vegas Golden Knights, they aggressively pursued free agents. One of their targets was Brock Boeser, who had just completed a solid season with 25 goals and 50 points in 75 games.According to Nick Kypreos, “The word is that the Leafs may have offered a higher annual salary than the $7.25 million (U.S.) that he took to stay with the Vancouver Canucks, but on a much shorter-term deal than the seven years he agreed to.”Boeser instead signed a seven-year, $50.75 million contract with the Canucks, averaging $7.25 million annually—underscoring his desire for stability and commitment to a team that has stuck with him through ups and downs.Boeser’s chemistry with linemates Elias Pettersson and Jake DeBrusk remains a key component of Vancouver’s offense.Having reached a career-high 40 goals in the 2023-24 season, Boeser has clearly proven his worth as a top-line sniper, and the Canucks have rewarded that loyalty.NHL insider Daniele Franceschi commented on The FAN Morning Show that Toronto missed out on a golden opportunity: “They (Leafs) certainly had enough flexibility to make it all happen... I think it would have been an interesting fit, obviously not as complete a player as Mitch Marner, but if you talk about just the star power and certainly the goal-scoring upside.”Franceschi also noted that Boeser’s experience handling pressure in the Canadian market could have made him a valuable asset in Toronto—something Marner, he suggested, struggled with.Also Read: “It’s on the management”: Former NHL executive slams Maple Leafs management for letting Mitch Marner walk away after nine seasons As the Leafs continue to search for their next offensive star, Boeser’s decision sends a clear message: sometimes, stability, familiarity, and loyalty outweigh short-term financial gains.","Brock Boeser signed a seven-year, $50.75 million contract with the Vancouver Canucks.

Edmonton Oilers’ interest in Carter Hart sends disturbing message to sexual assault survivors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-rumors-edmonton-oilers-interest-in-carter-hart-sends-disturbing-message-to-sexual-assault-survivors/articleshow/122249838.cms,"Oilers are reportedly considering signing Carter Hart (Getty Images)

Legal cloud over Carter Hart 's future complicates Oilers' interest

The Edmonton Oilers’ goaltending situation has come under sharp scrutiny after back-to-back Stanley Cup Final appearances ended in disappointment. Now, in a bold and controversial twist, the Oilers are reportedly exploring the possibility of signing Carter Hart—pending major legal and league developments. NHL insider Kevin Weekes has hinted that there is “mutual interest” between Hart and the Oilers, despite the shadow of the 2018 Hockey Canada sexual assault investigation still looming over the young goalie’s future. While Hart hasn’t played in the NHL since stepping away in 2024, he remains a high-upside netminder with untapped potential—if cleared to return.Hart is one of five players currently facing accusations in connection with the 2018 Hockey Canada sexual assault case. His future in the NHL will depend entirely on the outcome of the trial and any disciplinary measures the league may impose. For the Oilers, who already faced backlash for hiring Stan Bowman—linked to the Chicago Blackhawks' Kyle Beach scandal—adding Hart would risk igniting another public relations firestorm. As one columnist put it: “It is nothing short of a PR nightmare if the Oilers consider signing him.”Still, the potential fit is undeniable from a hockey standpoint.Hart, an Edmonton native and longtime friend of current Oilers goalie Stuart Skinner, could theoretically help shore up the team’s goaltending woes. In his last NHL season, Hart posted a respectable 2.80 GAA and .906 save percentage in 25 starts for the Flyers. Over his career, he’s played 227 games with a .906 SV%—solid numbers for a 25-year-old with room to grow.President of hockey operations Stan Bowman has publicly identified goaltending and forward depth as key areas needing improvement. With the team aiming to get “faster and younger,” Hart checks both boxes—on paper. But given the gravity of the allegations surrounding him, even speculation of his signing is polarizing the fanbase.Also Read: Who is Carter Hart?

Sidney Crosby trade rumors heat up as NHL insider hints at move to rising Canadiens

Could the face of the Pittsburgh Penguins be skating toward a new home in 2026? NHL insider Nick Kypreos believes it's more than just a rumor. During a recent appearance on Sportsnet 590 The Fan, Kypreos floated a bombshell idea—Sidney Crosby, the long-time Penguins captain and one of the league’s all-time greats, could be heading to the Montreal Canadiens after the 2026 Winter Olympics.“Wait till they get Sid Crosby after the Olympics,” Kypreos teased, leaving hosts Justin Bourne and Sam McKee visibly stunned. When challenged to elaborate, Kypreos didn’t back down: “I'm liking the odds a little better than I did maybe a few weeks ago. Something's going on in Pitt. Things are going on. Things are going on…”Though Kypreos didn’t dive into specifics, he pointed to what many believe is an impending rebuild in Pittsburgh. The Penguins have missed the playoffs for two consecutive seasons, signaling the possible end of an era. With aging stars and no clear path to contention, speculation is growing that the team may be heading toward a teardown.“He's too good right now to just be a babysitter for the next three years,” Kypreos emphasized. “It will be such a disservice to the history of our game if we watch him stay in Pittsburgh the next three or four years.”The Montreal Canadiens, valued at over $3 billion, are an ideal landing spot for Crosby, should the Penguins part ways with their longtime leader. The Habs are a young team on the rise and could greatly benefit from Crosby’s experience and leadership. Analysts already envision Crosby anchoring the top line, with captain Nick Suzuki sliding into the second center spot, while Kirby Dach and Alex Newhook could shift down or to the wings.Also Read: NHL Predictions: 3-time All-Star Ryan Suter likely to retire as market interest fades in offseason Though it remains a hypothetical scenario, Kypreos’ comments have sparked serious intrigue across the hockey world.

Why the Golden State Warriors Might Pull the Trigger

LeBron’s Future: What’s Next?

Thecould be finalizing a massive seven-team trade that ships out Kevin Durant —but this may only be the beginning. This move signals a bold new direction for the franchise. And now, rumors are swirling that their next target could be the biggest name in basketball: LeBron James With Durant gone and the Warriors clearly in roster-flipping mode, all eyes are on whether they’ll make an audacious push to pair Stephen Curry with the Lakers’ four-time MVP. The financials mysteriously align, the trade frameworks exist, and the Warriors have the assets to pull it off. But is trading for a 39-year-old LeBron the right move for a team torn between contending now and planning for the future?The Golden State Warriors ’ involvement in the seven-team deal marks a significant shift in their roster strategy. Though the trade primarily sends Durant elsewhere, Golden State’s front office appears to be laying the groundwork for another major move.The Golden State Warriors were part of a massive seven-team trade that saw them send Kevin Durant elsewhere in exchange for young prospects Alex Toohey and Jamai Mahshack. This trade marks a significant roster shake-up for the Warriors, signaling a shift toward developing future talent while parting ways with one of the league’s most prolific scorers.While the immediate return seems modest, the Warriors’ flexibility and future assets could set the stage for a bigger acquisition.According to Golden State of Mind’s Brady Klopfer, the Warriors could pivot toward a trade for Lakers forward LeBron James . The financials align surprisingly well, making this more than just a pipe dream.Klopfer noted: “Any James trade would almost certainly be centered around a swap with Jimmy Butler III. In fact, LeBron and his son Bronny James have a combined salary that’s less than $500,000 off of what Butler’s salary is, so the finances work fairly seamlessly.” (H/t: Sporting News)Here’s how a potential trade could break down:- Warriors receive: LeBron James and Bronny James- Lakers receive: Jimmy Butler and two first-round picksThe inclusion of Bronny adds another layer, as teams have shown interest in drafting him to potentially lure LeBron.Golden State has several reasons to consider this move:1. Championship Window: With Stephen Curry still playing at an elite level, adding LeBron could extend their title contention.2. Olympic Chemistry: James and Curry thrived together in the 2024 Olympics, where LeBron nearly averaged a triple-double and Curry lit up France with eight three-pointers in the gold medal game.3. Veteran Leadership: Both players bring unmatched experience, with eight combined NBA championships.However, there are risks:- Butler has already proven to fit the Golden State Warriors’ system.- LeBron’s age (39) and long-term durability remain questions.LeBron James recently opted into his $52.6 million player option, but his agent, Rich Paul, hinted that the Lakers are open to moves that benefit LeBron’s career at this stage. This has fueled speculation about potential trades.Curry previously dismissed the idea of teaming up with LeBron James in the NBA, saying in 2022, “I’m good right now.” But after failing to win a title since 2022, the Warriors’ superstar may reconsider.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Milwaukee Bucks could send $186 million superstar to the San Antonio Spurs and form deadly duo with Victor Wembanyama The Warriors’ front office is clearly thinking big. Swapping Butler for LeBron would be a gamble, but the upside—a Curry-James duo in the West—could redefine the NBA landscape. As Klopfer pointed out, the financials work. Now, it’s about whether Golden State believes the reward outweighs the risk.","The Golden State Warriors were part of a massive seven-team trade that saw them send Kevin Durant elsewhere in exchange for young prospects Alex Toohey and Jamai Mahshack.

When George Kittle paid respect to every military worker on the field

George Kittle is known for many things; for being one of the most dynamic tight ends in the NFL, playing for the San Francisco 49ers, his acute athleticism, and his tough blocking. Kittle quickly rose to prominence after being drafted in the fifth round of the 2017 NFL Draft and his ability to both catch passes and block at an elite level makes him a rare dual-threat.He was also known for his philanthropic work, but one of the most standout moments in his career occurred a few years ago when he shook hands with each service member as he entered the field during a game. Though it seemed unusual at first, viewers were quick to applaud his gesture as it showed his deep sense of patriotism.The NFL ground has been no stranger to political statements and several players have taken the opportunity to express their political views via certain gestures which have at times invited backlash. George Kittle’s gesture on the other hand was unanimously well-received and his fans applauded him widely for his gesture.Interestingly, the military used to be a big draw at major sporting events in the US. Up until a few years ago, military personnel would be present at games. Many people may not know his In the past, the Department of Defense paid millions to NFL teams for patriotic displays, such as on-field enlistment ceremonies and military salutes.This was deemed slightly controversial as it was deemed to be ""paid patriotism"" and led to investigations in the mid-2010s. Since then, the NFL and military have reduced promotional partnerships to maintain transparency and avoid the appearance of exploiting patriotism for marketing.However, military appreciation still exists—many teams host “Salute to Service” games, honor veterans during halftime, or invite active-duty members to attend as guests. The difference is that these gestures are now more symbolic, subtle, and focused on genuine tribute rather than scripted promotions or recruitment-driven appearances.",George Kittle is a tight end for the San Francisco 49ers.

One photo was enough to spark wild speculation among NBA fans. On July 4, LeBron James was spotted at the Cleveland Cavaliers’ practice facility and the internet exploded with talk of a surprise reunion. With trade rumors already swirling around the Los Angeles Lakers star, the image sparked wild speculation. But LeBron James quickly addressed a viral photo of him and his response shut down the noise and settled the rumors, at least for now.On July 4, a fan account called Hoop Central posted a photo of LeBron James at the Cleveland Cavaliers’ practice facility, calling it a “surprise” appearance. The image showed him training alongside a Cavaliers summer league player. But within hours, LeBron jumped onto X, explaining:“And every summer since it was built. I live here still and train every summer. Got damn yall bored man! Go get a plate of food somewhere and enjoy the 4th of July!”In his post, he clearly said this visit was old news, not a secret push to rejoin Cleveland. He lives nearby and has trained there before. He urged fans to relax and celebrate instead.In late June, LeBron opted for his $ 52.6 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. The move came when the Lakers re-shaped their roster, including the arrival of Luka Doncic and the trading of Anthony Davis. As a result, doubts about the franchise's direction and the role of Lebron are increasing.Labron's agent, Rich Paul, told ESPN that James wants to win another championship.Despite training in Cleveland, LeBron did not show any indication that he’s seeking a trade. NBA insiders have said the Cavaliers are “not that interested” in pursuing a reunion.Inside the Lakers' locker room, the return of DeAndre Ayton and Jaxson Hayes suggests this summer that the team is aiming for stability, not big shifts. When LeBron goes into what may be his last season, he seems focused on finding success with the Lakers and not returning to his old team.In the relentless world of NBA speculation, context is everything. A shared photo had fans whispering trade rumors, champion reunions, and surprise moves. But LeBron’s quick explanation brought clarity: he was training, not touring potential trades.

Poll Which record of Jaiswal do you think is most significant? Fastest Indian to 2,000 Test runs. Second-youngest to reach the milestone. Consistency in his innings. His record against England.

NEW DELHI: In a stunning display of flair and fearlessness, Yashasvi Jaiswal etched his name in cricketing folklore on Friday by becoming the joint-fastest Indian to reach 2,000 Test runs, alongside legends Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag. The 23-year-old southpaw reached the milestone during India’s second innings on Day 3 of the gripping second Test against England at Edgbaston.Jaiswal accomplished the feat in just his 40th Test innings, drawing level with Dravid and Sehwag and surpassing greats such as Sachin Tendulkar, Sunil Gavaskar, and Vijay Hazare.In terms of matches played, Jaiswal now stands alone - the fastest Indian ever to 2,000 Test runs, achieving the landmark in his 21st Test, eclipsing Gavaskar’s long-standing record (23 Tests).He reached the milestone with typical swagger - a thick edge wide of gully that flew away to the boundary.At just 23 years and 188 days, he also became the second-youngest Indian to reach the mark, behind only the immortal Tendulkar, who did it at 20 years and 330 days.Jaiswal’s innings was short but explosive - a 22-ball 28-run blitz featuring six crisply struck boundaries. But his cameo ended in controversy. Struck in front by Josh Tongue while attempting a booming drive, Jaiswal reviewed the LBW decision, only for England captain Ben Stokes to furiously argue that the DRS timer had expired. After a heated exchange with umpire Sharfuddoula, the review was accepted - and the decision stood as three reds sealed his fate.Earlier in the match, Jaiswal missed a richly-deserved century by just 13 runs in the first innings, falling for 87 after being deceived by Stokes. Still, his consistency and confidence continue to redefine India’s batting template.","Yashasvi Jaiswal becomes joint-fastest Indian to reach 2,000 Test runs.

Outlook and Potential Impact of Jalen Bridges on the Boston Celtics

Thehave signed, a 6-foot-8 forward and former teammate of Kevin Durant on the Phoenix Suns, as a potential replacement for Jayson Tatum, who is expected to miss most, if not all, of the 2025-26 NBA season due to a ruptured Achilles tendon. This move comes after a tumultuous postseason for Boston, which saw them lose Tatum to injury during the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the New York Knicks.Jalen Bridges played alongside Kevin Durant during the 2024-25 NBA season with the Phoenix Suns , albeit in a limited role. He was on a two-way contract and appeared in just eight games, averaging 1.1 points per game on 28.6% shooting from the field and from three-point range.Despite his modest professional stats, Bridges was a notable perimeter shooter in college, finishing his career at West Virginia and Baylor with a 37% three-point percentage, including two seasons above 39%.At 24 years old, Jalen Bridges brings size, youth, and a reputation as a capable spot-up shooter, which could fit well in coach Joe Mazzulla’s offensive system.Jayson Tatum suffered a season-ending Achilles injury in May 2025 and underwent successful surgery, with an expected nine-month recovery timeline.This mirrors the recovery period Kevin Durant faced after a similar injury, which caused him to miss an entire season.The Boston Celtics , facing the challenge of replacing Tatum’s production, have opted for a low-risk, high-upside move by bringing Bridges onto their summer league roster, with a chance to earn a full roster spot in training camp.While Jalen Bridges is not expected to replicate Tatum’s all-around impact, his shooting ability and size could allow him to carve out a role, especially if he impresses during summer league and training camp.The Boston Celtics’ decision to sign Bridges reflects a pragmatic approach: seeking affordable, developmental options to help fill the void left by Tatum, rather than making a blockbuster trade or high-cost acquisition.Also read: Bronny James Pay Cut Rumor Debunked: Viral Hoax Fooled NBA Fans In summary, the Boston Celtics’ addition of Jalen Bridges—Kevin Durant’s former 6-foot-8 teammate—offers them a potential rotation piece as they navigate the uncertainty of Tatum’s recovery.

Paul Pierce’s Claim and Reasoning

Fan Backlash after Paul’s Statement: “He Needs to Slow Down”

Kevin Durant’s Reaction to Pierce’s Claim

Context and Legacy of Pierce’s Self Praise

recently ignited a firestorm among NBA fans by declaring himself the “best pure scorer in the history of the NBA,” placing himself above icons like Kevin Durant, Michael Jordan, and Kobe Bryant. The bold assertion came in response to LeBron James ’ recent praise of Durant as the league’s most “equipped” scorer ever on the ‘Mind the Game’ podcast.On Fox Sports’ “Speak,” Paul Pierce argued that while Durant’s height (6’11”) gives him a unique advantage—allowing him to shoot over any defender and “not really see defense”—Pierce himself should be included in the conversation for greatest pure scorer. He insisted he could do it all offensively: pull up from the elbow, knock down threes, and score in the post. Pierce did concede that his shooting efficiency was lower than Durant’s, admitting, “I shot more bad shots than Kevin,” but maintained that his overall scoring arsenal was unmatched.NBA fans were quick and merciless in their response. Social media erupted with disbelief and ridicule:- “He’s not even a top 50 scorer of all time 😂😂😂.”- “For a guy nicknamed The Truth, he sure does lie a lot.”- “I love the Truth, but he needs to slow down.”- “Never averaged more than 26 by the way!”Many pointed to the statistical gap between Pierce and Durant. Durant has averaged 26+ points per game in 13 of his 17 seasons, while Pierce only reached that mark twice and averaged 20+ points per game in eight seasons. Durant’s career shooting splits and scoring consistency far outpace Pierce’s, making the latter’s claim difficult for fans to accept.Interestingly, Kevin Durant responded with unexpected grace. Instead of firing back, he supported Paul Pierce’s confidence, saying, “I didn’t really see a weakness in Paul’s game. I understand where his confidence comes from”. This mutual respect between two generations was a rare moment of sportsmanship amid the heated debate.Paul Pierce’s confidence is not new; he has a history of outspoken takes, especially in his post-playing media career. While his scoring prowess—highlighted by his 2008 Finals MVP and ranking 18th on the NBA’s all-time scoring list—is undeniable, most analysts and fans agree he does not belong in the same tier as Durant when it comes to pure scoring ability.Durant, still performing at an All-Star level at age 36, continues to demonstrate why he’s widely regarded as one of the most unstoppable scorers in league history, combining size, skill, and efficiency at a level few have matched.Also read: Austin Reaves’ Agent Denies Rift With Luka Doncic as Lakers Reaffirm Commitment to Star Duo Paul Pierce’s self-comparison to Kevin Durant as the NBA’s greatest pure scorer was met with widespread skepticism and humor from fans, who pointed to both statistical evidence and the eye test.

Austin Reaves’ On-Court Chemistry and Performance

Amid ongoing rumors of discord within the Los Angeles Lakers ’ agent has publicly and unequivocally denied any rift between his client and superstar teammate Luka Doncic. The speculation arose after NBA insider John Gambadoro claimed on the ""Burns and Gambo"" show that both LeBron James and Austin Reaves were unhappy playing with Doncic, suggesting that this discomfort could impact the Lakers’ future roster decisions.The rumors gained traction following the Lakers’ acquisition of Luka Doncic ahead of the 2024-25 NBA season. Gambadoro stated, “LeBron does not like playing with Luka. Reaves does not like playing with Luka. Reaves does not like getting the ball with two seconds left on the shot clock. LeBron is not fond of playing with Luka. The Lakers are going to turn their attention to build around Luka, not LeBron”. These comments fueled speculation about locker room chemistry and the future direction of the Lakers’ roster. Austin Reaves ’ agent, Aaron Reilly, responded swiftly and decisively to these claims. In a statement released to multiple media outlets, Reilly asserted: “Austin has nothing but the utmost respect for Luka and truly enjoys playing alongside him. Any suggestion to the contrary is completely false. He’s excited to be on the court with Luka—both now and in the future”.Reilly’s statement was echoed across NBA media, with insiders and journalists noting that Reaves and Doncic have developed a strong professional relationship during their time together on the Lakers.The agent’s remarks were intended to “nip this report in the bud before it grew more legs,” reinforcing that Reaves is committed to the team’s vision and his partnership with Doncic.Despite the rumors, the Lakers’ front office has made it clear that they view Reaves and Doncic as core pieces for the franchise’s future. The team recently offered Reaves a four-year, $89.2 million max contract extension, which he declined, opting instead to play out the third season of his current deal and potentially enter free agency in 2026. This decision led to further speculation about his satisfaction with the team and his role alongside Doncic, but both the player and his agent have reiterated his desire to stay in Los Angeles and continue building with Doncic.Statistical analysis from the 2024-25 season indicates that Reaves’ performance actually improved when sharing the court with Doncic, with increased efficiency and offensive output. Both players averaged over 20 points and five assists per game, placing them among the league’s elite backcourt duos. While concerns remain about their collective defensive capabilities, there is no evidence to suggest personal animosity or reluctance to play together.Also read: Toronto Raptors Sign Jakob Poeltl to Four-Year, $104 Million Contract Extension The rumors of a rift between Austin Reaves and Luka Doncic have been categorically denied by Reaves’ agent, who emphasized his client’s respect and enthusiasm for playing alongside Doncic.

Former NFL star Michael Irvin’s darkest locker room moment resurfaces after decades,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/former-nfl-star-michael-irvins-darkest-locker-room-moment-resurfaces-after-decades/articleshow/122253442.cms,"NFL legend's darkest moment finally exposed (Image credits: Instagram/X)

Team allegedly covered up stabbing with private payout



Michael Irvin’s charisma, controversy, and a violent past collide

NFL Hall of Famer Michael Irvin, once the heartbeat of the Dallas Cowboys' 1990s dynasty, is facing renewed backlash after disturbing details about a violent locker room incident from 1998 resurfaced. During a heated altercation with teammate Everett McIver, Irvin allegedly stabbed him in the neck with a pair of barber scissors. Though the incident was severe enough to risk jail time, no legal action was taken. The team reportedly went to great lengths to keep the story out of public view.The explosive claim was made by journalist Jeff Pearlman on the Going Deep with Chad & JT podcast, where he described the scene during the Cowboys’ preseason camp in Wichita Falls, Texas. The franchise had brought in a barber to cater to Black players, and tensions rose when Irvin confronted McIver during a haircut. According to Pearlman, the confrontation escalated into violence in seconds.“Michael Irvin grabbed the barber's scissors and stabbed him in the neck, dragging them. And blood gushed everywhere,” Pearlman said.At the time, Irvin was already on probation, making any legal entanglement potentially career-ending.To avoid criminal proceedings, team owner Jerry Jones allegedly arranged a multi-million dollar settlement with McIver to ensure his silence. The matter was never officially reported, and the locker room incident faded into obscurity—until now.Despite his off-field issues, Irvin remained a central figure in one of the NFL’s most successful franchises. Known for his leadership and intensity, he delivered seven 1,000-yard seasons, earned three All-Pro selections, and helped lead the Cowboys to three Super Bowl titles. Yet this incident paints a darker picture behind his famed charisma.Pearlman also recalled a similar outburst during Irvin’s college days at the University of Miami, where head coach Jimmy Johnson once warned him after a cafeteria brawl. “Do you want to be a boxer or a football player?” Johnson asked, signaling a turning point in Irvin’s journey.Also read: Sean Payton’s sideline clash with Bo Nix sparks fresh buzz over Broncos’ offensive reboot Irvin officially announced his retirement during the 2000 offseason, after a severe neck injury, sustained during a game in 1999.

Bo Nix wins locker room, but Payton needs more than vibes



Engram, Lohner and the hunt for a Jimmy Graham 2.0



Sean Payton is entering a make-or-break season in Denver, and the pressure is mounting to fix an offense that has struggled since Peyton Manning’s exit. While rookie quarterback Bo Nix has generated locker room buzz, Payton knows leadership isn’t enough—production must follow. The Broncos’ offensive failures last year were glaring, from a nonexistent run game to tight ends barely factoring in. That’s why Payton has reshaped the unit, betting on fresh faces and untapped talent.Right tackle Mike McGlinchey recently admitted that Nix made an early impact, noting, “Bo captured this locker room by the way that he works, by the person that he is and the way that he progressed.” But Payton isn’t handing out praise just yet—he’s seen what happens when hype isn’t backed by execution. Nix, despite his poise, enters a system that ranked near the bottom in tight end and rushing production last season. No Denver running back crossed 550 yards, and no tight end topped 20 catches.Payton’s response was immediate: signing former Jaguars TE Evan Engram and drafting dynamic RB R.J. Harvey. He also brought in J.K. Dobbins, hoping to revive a ground attack that never got off the runway in 2023. NFL analyst John Breech recently questioned if the overhaul would be enough, saying, “My biggest question is on offense and is what are these new offensive skill players going to look like?” With Nix now the presumed starter, Payton’s vision faces a real-world test.In one fiery October clash with the Raiders, Nix missed a deep throw to Troy Franklin—and Payton lit into him on the sideline. Instead of folding, Nix barked back and then delivered two touchdown drives. That kind of fire is exactly what Payton has been searching for under center. “We’re in the business of passion,” Payton later said, contrasting Nix’s edge with Russell Wilson’s more passive demeanor.Denver’s revolving door at tight end may finally stop with Engram, who signed a two-year, $23 million deal and is drawing Jimmy Graham comparisons. Breech added, “I could see Evan Engram putting up some huge numbers this year… the Broncos offense is gonna be a lot different, but a lot more successful.” But Payton isn’t stopping at one name. He’s quietly developing rookie Caleb Lohner—a 6-foot-8 basketball convert with just 57 college snaps.“If it turns out like the last one did (Jimmy Graham), then we’d be real excited,” Payton said, referencing his past success with tight ends in New Orleans. Lohner’s raw athleticism makes him a long-term project, but the upside is high. Meanwhile, Engram is expected to start immediately, bringing explosiveness Denver has sorely missed. With layered depth at tight end, Payton is covering bases while nurturing breakout potential.Also read: Antonio Brown’s cryptic post sparks fresh firestorm over Tyler Lockett’s resurfaced virginity vow If the offense clicks and Nix settles into the role, Payton’s decisions might finally flip from “risky” to “genius.” And for Broncos Country, that turnaround can’t come soon enough.","Sean Payton is entering a make-or-break season in Denver.

You've had some legendary battles with riders like Jonas Vingegaard and Remco Evenepoel — what makes those rivalries push you to be better?

With cycling becoming increasingly team-oriented, how do you balance individual ambition with teamwork?

Tadej Pogacar enters the Tour de France - the oldest and most prestigious multi-stage bicycle race - as a clear favourite. Recent form of having won the Critérium du Dauphiné boosted his credentials. He is a three-time Tour de France winner and the defending champion of the 21 stage race that gets underway on July 5.Pogacar has 99 professional wins going into the race in France, so will almost certainly hit his century mark during the over 3,300km race.26-year-old Slovenian Pogacar won six stages in the last year's edition and ran away with the overall victory.There are considerable arguments to say the Team UAE rider is even stronger in 2025.""That's why the first week is perhaps the most important first week in years. It's an opportunity for Pogacar's rivals to put him on the back foot,"" race general director Christian Prudhomme said.Two of Pogcar's challengers are two-time Tour de France winner Jonas Vingegaard of Visma, considered to be the Slovenian's greatest rivals, and Remco Evenepoel who represents team Soudal.""We'd like someone to give him a run for his money, Jonas Vingegaard or Remco Evenepoel or anybody else in fact,"" said Prudhomme.""We are hoping for suspense and we'd be delighted with an all out scrap.""Pogacar labels himself a ""good boy from a good family taking no shortcuts in life"". He has both swagger and modesty to go with his new deal worth €50 million over the next six years.spoke to Tadej Pogacar on his early days, what makes TdF special and the technicalities of the sport that go unnoticed.I started cycling because my older brother rode, and I wanted to do what he was doing. I was just a kid riding around Slovenia, not thinking about the Tour de France. Over time, I fell in love with the sport. The freedom, the landscapes, the feeling of pushing your limits — that’s what drew me in. Winning is great, of course, but the love for riding has always been the core. Whether it’s a tough 5 hour training ride with my Team UAE Emirate teammates or an easy hour coffee ride with my fiancé Urska, I love every aspect of cycling.It’s very mental. The body has limits, but the mind often hits them before the legs do. I try to stay relaxed — I don’t overthink too much. The key is to have a good ambiance with your teammates, joke around, listen to music. If your head is in a good place, you suffer better. It is still hard though, there is no escaping that part!For a lot of people outside of cycling the Tour de France is the main race they know, but if you scratch the surface a bit you have some other races which are just as tough and as beautiful. The Giro and the Vuelta for example, or the one-day monument races.The Grand Tours though are extra special - it’s a mix of tradition, chaos, and beauty. You’re racing through history, through the Alps, past castles, fans who have been there camping and waiting for days all screaming with flags and horns. And it's not just one day — it’s three weeks of drama. Anything can happen. They are some of the most beautiful events you’ll see in sport.In the climbing stages, it’s more instinct. You’re listening to your legs, the gradient, the wind. Flat stages are more about staying safe and not getting caught out with splits. In both scenarios it’s important your teammates are there to work together and stay out of trouble.Time trials — they’re more precise and you are following a pacing strategy with certain watts etc. It’s a lot more controlled.In a stage race like the Tour de France nutrition and recovery is huge and is probably the biggest advance in cycling in the past five years I would say. In the past nutrition was not taken as seriously - you only ate when you were hungry, tried to save calories and just guessed a bit based on how you were feeling. Since I joined UAE they have hired two nutritionists and a team of chefs who are constantly monitoring the quantity and quality of food that we consume. It’s way more scientific than even 5 years ago. We burn a lot of calories so we eat a lot. Our nutrition sponsor Enervit also work hard to make easily digestible bars and gels so we can take on as much energy as we can on the bike.They’re both great rivals. For the fans I think this is a nice time for watching racing, there are many great champions and the racing is exciting to watch. Racing them pushes me because I know if I’m not at my best then they will make it very difficult. They bring the best out of me — and I hope I do the same for them. It’s what sport should be.You don’t win a Grand Tour alone, that’s for sure. Even if you cross the line first, it’s the team behind you — they control the race, they pull, they protect. I have ambition, of course, but my teammates are my friends, and I want us all to succeed. When they believe in me, I ride harder for them.","Tadej Pogacar is a three-time Tour de France winner and the defending champion of the 21 stage race that gets underway on July 5.

Major League Cricket 2025 Explained: Teams, Schedule & Where to Watch

The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has urged all independent directors of USA Cricket (USAC) to resign with immediate effect, paving the way for a wholesale leadership overhaul.In an email reviewed by TimesofIndia.com, David Patterson, senior governance adviser to the USOPC, told USAC chief executive Jonathan Atkeison that the committee wants every independent board member to step down so that “new independent members can be appointed to replace them.”According to people familiar with the talks, the International Cricket Council (ICC) supports the USOPC’s assessment. Members of the ICC’s normalisation committee attended the recent meetings in Los Angeles with USOPC officials, USAC chair Venu Pisike and Atkeison, where the need for a “clean slate” was underscored.In his correspondence, Patterson outlined seven next steps and stressed that the USOPC “will remain involved and engaged throughout this process and beyond.” Atkeison, responding to the email, warned the board that unless the USOPC’s conditions are met, the committee will not open the application window for recognising a national governing body for cricket — effectively barring USAC from overseeing Olympic cricket in the United States.Referring to previous discussions, Patterson added that partial fixes “just don’t work” and that a full leadership reset is “by far the best course of action.”Atkeison has circulated Patterson’s message to the entire USAC board, noting that the only new element is a willingness by USOPC and ICC officials to “jointly construct the initial slate of independent director candidates.”TimesofIndia.com sought comment from Pisike and board members Srini Salver and Anj Balusu, but none had responded at the time of publication. This story will be updated when they do.Sources say several directors are prepared to resign, while Pisike and Salver are resisting pressure to do so. In fact, despite the communication, one board members claims they have received no formal communication from the ICC, despite the governing body’s recent meetings with USOPC and USAC leadership.The USOPC’s intervention adds to mounting pressure on USA Cricket, which has faced repeated scrutiny over governance and financial management since its formation in 2018.","The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has urged all independent directors of USA Cricket to resign with immediate effect.

Neves and Jota also played together at Wolves in the Premier League before Jota's transfer to Liverpool in 2020.Al-Hilal's head coach Simone Inzaghi addressed the emotional impact of the situation on his players, stating: ""We all know it's a very sad day because of what happened to Diogo and André.These things should never happen. We're all aware of the tragedy. We have two Portugal players Rúben Neves and João Cancelo who were friends to them. Today has been a very difficult day for all of us.

EXCLUSIVE | David Gower on Shubman Gill, Jasprit Bumrah and India's England tour

On a day when bowlers dominated and the match hung in tense balance, Pat Cummins lit up the second Test between Australia and West Indies with one of the most breathtaking caught-and-bowled dismissals in recent memory.The Australian captain's stunning effort to remove Keacy Carty was described by commentators as ""an athletic effort of the highest class"" and will surely be replayed for years to come.It happened in a flash. Cummins bowled a good length delivery that jagged back into Carty, who prodded forward with bat away from pad. The ball took a thick inside edge and ballooned in the air, seemingly destined to land safely in the empty space near square mid-wicket. But Cummins wasn’t having it.Sprinting across to his right, the 32-year-old pacer flung himself forward, stretching out his right hand to pluck the ball just inches above the turf. It was a moment of pure athleticism and instinct. Third umpire Nitin Menon took a brief look before confirming the dismissal: Keacy Carty c and b Cummins 6 (12).""It's a brilliant catch. Absolutely terrific from the Australian captain,"" exclaimed one commentator.""It is an athletic effort of the highest class.""The catch capped a solid bowling effort that restricted West Indies to 253 in their first innings, with Nathan Lyon being the pick of the bowlers with 3/75. Brandon King led the West Indies resistance with a stroke-filled 75 off 108 balls.Australia ended the day on 12 for two, having lost both openers - Sam Konstas and Usman Khawaja - early to Jayden Seales. With a narrow lead of 45 and eight wickets in hand, Cummins’ magic moment might prove pivotal in a Test that remains delicately poised heading into Day 3.","Pat Cummins takes stunning catch to remove Keacy Carty.

Dominik and Rey Mysterio don't see eye-to-eye and that is a fact known to every wrestling fan. The father-son duo has been at odds for most of their on-screen life, and in the world of kayfabe, Dom might be happy to learn that Rey Mysterio's retirement is looking closer than ever before. Of course, in real life too, it will be a moment of celebration for the family as Mysterio Sr. is one of the most celebrated Mexican wrestlers in WWE, and his son is pretty proud of him. Rey Mysterio has been wrestling since he was a boy of 14 years old. That boy became a man, a father at that, and after more than 3 decades in the wrestling world, it is probably time that he starts thinking about hanging up the hood and taking off the mask for good. Recently, Mysterio Sr. sat for an interview with LA PLATICA, where he revealed his retirement plans, and fans are not ready for it.""Oh, it’s definitely really close… it’s really close. But at the same time, I’m so motivated.""Rey Mysterio was ""unmasked and unfiltered"" for the interview, and shared some future plans with the hosts as well as the fans. He spoke of his recovery after getting injured on SmackDown the night before WrestleMania 41, and said that he will possibly be back in the ring around August if all is well.While they seem to be going against one another at every turn, in real life, Rey and Dominik Mysterio share a very close bond. And when Junior decided to give wrestling a chance, it gave senior the push to continue with his career, something he has loved and worked for since he was a teenager. Speaking to the hosts of LA PLATICA, Rey Rey said:""A lot of people ask me, ‘What keeps you going?’ I think that once my son started to wrestle, that kind of pushed me to continue, ’cause I was really getting very close to calling it quits, but that just kind of gave me that second wind, and it pushed me to keep going. To be honest, I know I’m going to still enjoy it when I retire, but I’m going to have to tap out. I still love what I do and I always have.”While he is not yet ready to give up completely, at 50 years of age, and after such a fulfilling career, Rey Mysterio deserves to get some rest.

Poll Was India's bowling performance effective on Day 3? Yes, they had control early on No, they lost momentum quickly

NEW DELHI: India seemed on course to bowl England out cheaply after removing Joe Root and Ben Stokes early on Day 3 of the second Test of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy at Edgbaston on Friday. But Jamie Smith and Harry Brook had other plans, hammering centuries to stage a remarkable counterattack and tilt the momentum back in England’s favour.Mohammed Siraj kickstarted the drama by striking twice in the second over of the day. First, he got Joe Root to tickle one off his pads to Rishabh Pant. On the very next delivery, he bowled a sharp, rising delivery that caught Ben Stokes off guard. The England captain fended at it, only to glove it behind to Pant for a golden duck — his first in Test cricket — leaving England reeling.At 84/5, India looked firmly in control. But that changed quickly.Brook displayed elegance and authority, unfurling crisp drives and flicks off Siraj, while Smith countered with aggressive strokeplay — slamming the ball down the ground and later pulling and driving Akash Deep for boundaries. Brook brought up his second fifty of the series with a commanding drive off Siraj, and soon Smith began dismantling India's short-ball strategy.Brook continued the charge, swivelling on the back foot to smash Prasidh Krishna for three fours and a six on the leg-side, before driving him once more for a boundary. That over alone leaked 23 runs.Smith, meanwhile, reached his fifty off just 43 balls and kept going hard. He punished Prasidh’s short balls with a four and a six, then took three more boundaries off Washington Sundar. Against Ravindra Jadeja, he once again went aerial, launching a four and a six to continue the onslaught.Amid this brutal assault, Krishna's struggles in Test cricket grew more glaring. The pacer now holds the unfortunate record for the worst economy rate in Test history (minimum 500 deliveries).In the first Test, which India lost by five wickets, Krishna conceded 128 runs in the first innings while taking three wickets at an economy of 6.40. In the second innings, he gave away 92 runs for two wickets, with an economy of 6.13.His performance during Day 3 worsened the numbers further: 5-0-50-0 at an economy rate of 10.00 — the most expensive spell (five or more overs) by an Indian bowler since December 2006.Overall, Krishna has now conceded runs at over five per over in his brief Test career — a glaring concern for India’s pace department.",Jamie Smith and Harry Brook hit centuries on Day 3 of the second Test at Edgbaston.

10 CRAZY RASMUS RISTOLAINEN PLAYS

The Philadelphia Flyers are one step away from yet another rebuilding phase, having endured yet another disappointing season in 2024-25. While they did act ambitiously to try to change their fate, the attempted transition had an uninspiring end, necessitating evaluation again. With the more talented newcomer Trevor Zegras infusing some youth and excitement into the roster, the focus is now on eliminating the long-standing impediments faced by the franchise. Philadelphia has to finally bring itself to part ways with players who have failed in their assignments to step onto a playoff-caliber path.For all his brands of grittiness and toughness, this style is increasingly out of place in a speed-centric league. At 33 years of age, Hathaway scarcely registers on the score sheet while his hit of $2.4 million on the cap seems too much for a player who contributes meagerly on offense. With youth and faster play style taking precedence in Philadelphia, they would do better to give Hathaway's ice time to younger forwards who have that much more upside.The goaltending situation in Philadelphia, especially for Samuel Ersson, is one that invites scrutiny.The 25-year-old Swedish netminder was raised to prominence last season but was never able to genuinely assert himself as a dependable option in the long term. With Dan Vladar's trading-in and prospects Ivan Fedotov and Alexei Kolosov developing, Ersson is finding his seat squeezed out. Given that he showed sporadic glimmers of competence, the Flyers are in no position to endure another parameter of uncertainty between the pipes. It may be prudent to trade Ersson to extract whatever potential value remains.The toughest and most pressing decision is made by Rasmus Ristolainen. A divisive personality among Flyers supporters and a strong presence on the blue line for the past several years, his position has become entangled in inconsistency and internal discord. While there have been trade rumors, Philadelphia has not managed to get to the end of it. With a new regime coming in and shaking things up in the locker room, ending Ristolainen's tenure has become paramount. Letting him stay is the last thing the team needs, potentially tearing down the karma and focus that are so critical as they set about rebuilding morale and chemistry.Also Read: Zach Werenski and Odette Peters are soaking up sun-kissed luxury in Athens as part of their romantic European getaway The Philadelphia Flyers are at a critical juncture.

Steelers face crucial decision on TJ Watt ’s future

Steelers Insider Gerry Dulac Talks TJ Watt & Fitzpatrick-Ramsey Trade w/ Rich Eisen | Full Interview

The Pittsburgh Steelers are making waves this offseason, but not just with bold acquisitions. Amid reports of a “win-now” roster strategy, rumors suggest the team is preparing a record-breaking $200 million contract extension for star linebacker TJ Watt—despite ongoing trade speculation surrounding the All-Pro pass rusher.TJ Watt has long been the cornerstone of the Steelers’ defense. As a seven-time Pro Bowler and former Defensive Player of the Year, his impact on the field is undeniable. But as Pittsburgh builds a veteran-heavy roster including additions like Aaron Rodgers, DK Metcalf, and Jalen Ramsey, rumors of a potential Watt trade have emerged, creating tension around the team’s long-term direction.NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero recently criticized the trade speculation, calling it “unethical” and illogical. His point is if Pittsburgh is serious about contending for a Super Bowl in 2025, trading away its most dominant defensive player makes little sense. “A 2026 draft pick doesn’t help you,” Pelissero noted, emphasizing that Watt is too valuable to part with if the Steelers want to capitalize on this short window of opportunity.Insiders now believe Pittsburgh is more likely to extend Watt than move him.

This opened the floodgates of responses from fans (Image Via Twitter)

User GenXAB responded: ""Mike I agree with you whole heartedly. Tulsky doesn't get enough criticism for his analytically built small, soft rosters. I don't think he's solved any of the consistent playoff problems the Canes have had.”



A more measured comment came from Xerxsion: “You say this as though players that fit that category were available this summer. The trade market is dead with nobody wanting futures and due to Florida's success recently nobody wants to move out those grittier players. Not sure what people expect Carolina to do.”



Several others gave more overt support to Commodore. Jake The Snake said, “Agree with you, but that would have to come via trade (might be working on it).”

Responses from fans (Image Via Twitter)

Trav added: “Nikishin and Miller bout to bring the boom Mike! Agreed that we do need a feisty big forward to go along with them tho.”



Fan Whaler_Cane said: “Agree with what you are saying but we needed more talent up front. We only had 3 true top 6 forwards talent-wise imo. Power forwards who can score are hard to find, teams don't let them go. I would have no problem adding a big, angry asshole in the bottom 6 though.”



Fan the Wolfpack, baby! hinted at passing frustration because of the restrictions. “If they’re not “allowed” to play that way, which has been rumored…doesn’t much matter. Don’t forget Max Domi, not the same guy here.”

After the Hurricanes' announcement of signing the forward to a six-year contract worth $51 million, debates flowed throughout the NHL . While the team looks to add speed on offense and scoring punch, it is not a unanimously agreed-upon decision. Former Stanley Cup-winner Mike Commodore, once an instrumental piece of Carolina's 2006 crown, expressed his concern regarding the physical composition of the team. These critiques had fans responding in droves, some agreeing with his point and others countering.Shortly after the deal broke, Commodore took to X. He foisted praise upon Ehlers but questioned if the Hurricanes were losing their physical edge: “Ehlers is an excellent player…but end of day….are the Canes trying to get smaller?” He was concerned about the size and toughness of the team, hinting that Carolina's roster might currently lean too much toward finesse rather than force.The 6-foot, 172-pound winger, Ehlers, tallied 24 goals in 69 games last year, with an additional of five in the playoffs. His talent is never a question; however, it seems that Commodore's concern has something to do with the balance between skill and toughness. This opened the floodgates of responses from fans, many agreeing with his viewpoint, while others doubted and said scoring needed to come first.Also Read: Zach Werenski and Odette Peters embark on dreamy pre-wedding tour across 8 countries However, the conversation launched by Mike Commodore's comments makes for a greater question: Can a team today survive on speed and skill alone?

Bill Belichick ripped into him over a busted play and Gilmore’s pride took the hit



From almost crying to never getting picked again, Gilmore turned pain into fuel



“I ain’t never got picked again after that,”

Gilmore’s honesty reveals how greatness sometimes starts with discomfort

Stephon Gilmore was supposed to be one of the best in the league and he. But even he wasn’t safe when he first stepped into a New England Patriots team meeting. In an interview on, the former NFL Defensive Player of the Year dropped a raw, behind-the-scenes moment that made fans do a double take.Gilmore admitted that during one of his first meetings with the Patriots, Bill Belichick came at him so hard in front of the whole squad that he had to step away just to compose himself.Gilmore was fresh to the Patriots, trying to earn respect, and defending during a bunch route. He got picked. And Bill? He let the whole room know about it.“He killed me one day, bro. It was when I first got there. I was pressed down on the receiver. It was a bunch route, and I got picked. Bro, he killed me at the next meeting. I almost cried, how he did me. I ain’t going to lie to you. I went to the bathroom, like man, bro.”That’s the kind of coaching that either breaks you or builds you. And in Gilmore’s case? It was the latter.The wild part is, Gilmore said that moment was a turning point. After that brutal callout, he never let it happen again.he said with a little pride.You know what followed? A legendary run. He locked down receivers, made the Pro Bowl, won Defensive Player of the Year in 2019, and even helped Belichick grab another Super Bowl ring. So yeah, the coach went full savage but Gilmore turned the sting into success.Not every player is willing to admit they were pushed to the brink, especially when they're a superstar. But Gilmore opening up like this just shows the human side of what it takes to be elite.It’s not always trophies and headlines, it’s embarrassment, resilience, and learning from the moment you wanted to hide. And if you’re lucky, a coach like Belichick who’ll destroy your ego just enough to rebuild your game.Also read - Joe Burrow goes viral after fans spot him walking alone in Beverly Hills looking ‘extremely sad’","Stephon Gilmore says Bill Belichick made him cry in team meeting early in Patriots career.
