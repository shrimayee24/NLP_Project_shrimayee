Himachal Pradesh: Canadian paraglider dies; 2 foreign pilots rescued,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/himachal-pradesh-canadian-paraglider-dies-2-foreign-pilots-rescued/articleshow/124731172.cms,"Caught On Cam: Paraglider Hits Power Line, Crashes Into Red River In Fiery Scene

KULLU: A 27-year-old Canadian paraglider died after crash-landing into the Dhauladhar mountains in Himachal Pradesh last week, while two foreign pilots were rescued from the upper reaches of Kangra and Kullu districts on Monday. In keeping with her wishes, Megan Elizabeth from Canada was cremated in Bir as per Hindu rituals on Tuesday.All three paragliders had taken off from the 8000-ft Bir-Billing site near Dharamshala, which draws adventure-seekers from across the world. Elizabeth took off at 9.45am Saturday (Oct 18), but was forced to crash-land below a rocky cliff in the Dhauladhar mountains, around 40km away, at an altitude of 4,000m (13,120ft).A search and rescue operation was launched as soon as Kangra administration was informed of the accident. A team from Billing Paragliding Association (BPA) carried out helicopter sorties in the Dhauladhar mountains and dropped its leader, Rahul Singh, near the site where Elizabeth had crash-landed on Saturday evening, as there was no space for landing a chopper. Singh was to find Elizabeth and help her survive until a full rescue team arrived, but he couldn’t locate her and spent the night on a cliffside.On Sunday morning, four more BPA team members were air-dropped, and they managed to locate her body.“Elizabeth was forced to crash-land either due to a sudden weather change or because of a problem with her glider. She used the reserve glider while crash-landing, but I guess she was flying at a low altitude and hit the rocks while landing. She sustained serious head injuries,” said BPA founder-director Suresh Thakur.BPA members carried Elizabeth’s body down for over 1,000m (nearly 3,300ft) until a chopper could airlift it to Kangra, where an autopsy was conducted. The two paragliders rescued Monday were Russian Nikita Vasiltsov and Austrian Jakob Krammer. Nikita (38) had crash-landed near Patalsu peak in Pir Panjal range near Manali, around 70km from where he took off, at an altitude of around 4,000m.Hundreds of ‘free flyers’ (solo pilots) from around the world gather in Bir-Billing in Oct every year, which is considered the best time for cross-country flights. However, Bir-Billing has seen frequent paragliding accidents and fatalities.In the past decade, over a dozen solo paragliders — mostly foreign nationals — have died after taking off from Bir-Billing, six of them in the last three years.","Megan Elizabeth, 27, died after crash-landing into the Dhauladhar mountains in Himachal Pradesh last week.

Double delight as 2 comets captured over Indian skies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/double-delight-as-2-comets-captured-over-indian-skies/articleshow/124731183.cms,"In the season of the festival of lights, two rare comets are illuminating the skies over India (and the rest of the world). Both comets — C/2025 R2 (SWAN) and C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) — can currently be seen through binoculars from dark sky locations and are expected to be at their brightest this week.TOI captured both these icy outer-space visitors on camera on the trekking route to Dayara bugyal near Uttarkashi in Uttarakhand last week. These are among the first wide-angle visuals of the comets clicked from India. While both have a characteristic tail, its currently more prominent in comet Lemmon.SWAN isn’t expected to return to our solar system in 20,000 years while the next chance for observers on Earth to catch a glimpse of Lemmon will be in the year 3175. This is a double delight for stargazers as it’s rare for two large comets to appear in the sky at the same time. Both comets had their closest flyby of Earth over the past two days, SWAN on Monday and Lemmon on Tuesday.There’s uncertainty over whether these dusty snowballs will get bright enough to be seen with naked eyes. Some estimates suggest that Lemmon may brighten further.Lemmon is the brighter of the two with a current visibility of magnitude 4.5, as per SpaceWeather.com, which technically puts it in visual range.In the -1 to 10 apparent magnitude scale, any celestial object of a magnitude below 6.5 should be visible to the eye. However, as per most accounts, the comet can currently be only seen through a pair of binoculars or a telescope. However, both show up in long-exposure camera shots.The best time to view the comets this week is an hour after sunset, around 7pm. Lemmon appears in the northwest horizon in the Bootes constellation, close to the ‘handle’ of Big Dipper (Saptrishi). It sets around 7.45pm. SWAN is currently a little higher up in the sky, just above the teapot-shaped Sagittarius constellation in the southern horizon.The most recent comet visible to the naked eye was C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE) that made an appearance in mid-2020. If it gets any brighter, Lemmon may be the next truly visible comet.The next few days will tell.","Both comets had their closest flyby of Earth over the past two days, SWAN on Monday and Lemmon on Tuesday.

Lack of clarity over the official start of the opposition’s campaign has left candidates to fend for themselves and campaign at their own level.“We are preparing the campaign programme, it will be out very soon,” senior RJD politician Chitranjan Gagan said, but didn’t reveal when campaign would be launched.","Bihar CM Nitish Kumar launched the NDA’s poll campaign from Muzaffarpur.

Travis Kelce’s heartfelt moment wins the night at 1587 Prime



Inside 1587 Prime’s growing buzz and backlash



After crushing the Las Vegas Raiders 31-0, the Kansas City Chiefs proved once again why they remain one of the most feared teams in the NFL. But it wasn’t just their on-field dominance that caught attention — it was what happened afterward. Travis Kelce , along with his superstar fiancée Taylor Swift , decided to celebrate the big win at his new steakhouse, 1587 Prime, turning what could’ve been a routine dinner into a memory of a lifetime for one lucky family.Instead of dining in privacy, Kelce and Swift chose to sit among the restaurant’s patrons, soaking in the atmosphere like any other couple. For one family of five, the night turned unforgettable. Their dad, proudly sporting a Kelce jersey, caught the tight end’s attention. Moments later, Kelce walked over to greet them, thanked them for coming, and even joked about their dessert.Kelce admired their cookie order and quipped that he might have to try some himself before telling the dad, “Appreciate you rocking the 87.” The interaction was pure kindness, the kind of unscripted moment that reminds fans why they adore athletes like him.The touching video, later shared on the official Kelce Brothers Instagram page, showed the family — especially one of the young sons — overcome with emotion.The mother, Allison, shared the experience online, writing, “So a thing happened last night….which I can’t actually believe happened! Whilst in Kansas City we went for dinner and just happened to bump into Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce 🫶🏻❤️💛🤍 What a night! What an experience. My 3 boys and I feel incredibly lucky and truly blessed! All thanks to some friendship bracelets 🫶🏻🫶🏻”Whether it was the jersey or the bracelets that drew Kelce over, it didn’t matter. For that family, it was a night they’d never forget — and for Kelce, another example of his down-to-earth charm.Co-owned by Kelce, Patrick Mahomes , and the Noble 33 restaurant group, 1587 Prime has been both celebrated and criticized since opening. While some social media users have complained about steep prices — like the $345 wagyu tomahawk steak or $76 lobster tail — others say the experience is worth every penny.At the end of the day, it’s a steakhouse, and premium pricing comes with the territory. Still, the warmth Kelce showed that night may do more for the restaurant’s reputation than any five-star review could.A team sitting at 4-3 rarely inspires fear — but between the Chiefs’ dominance and their star player’s heart, Kansas City remains as intimidating off the field as on it.Also Read: George Kittle’s “backup wife hug” with Kristin Juszczyk becomes the funniest off-field moment of the 49ers game","The Kansas City Chiefs beat the Las Vegas Raiders 31-0 on Sunday.

Morgan Rielly sends candid message to Leafs fans after expressing envy for Blue Jays



Toronto’s Championship energy could fuel the Leafs’ comeback



Toronto is celebrating. The Blue Jays’ thrilling Game 7 win over the Seattle Mariners secured the city’s first World Series berth since 1993, sending fans into the streets in joyous celebration. Amid the excitement, Maple Leafs defenseman Morgan Rielly admitted he felt a twinge of jealousy watching another Toronto team reach the pinnacle of its sport. For a city still yearning for a Stanley Cup appearance since 1967, Rielly’s honesty captured the hopes and frustrations of Leafs fans everywhere.Rielly, a cornerstone of the Maple Leafs since 2013, has witnessed firsthand the heartbreaks that have defined Toronto hockey in recent decades. “There's a small part of you that you're envious of them. You're a bit jealous of what they're doing, just because of Toronto. You watch it firsthand, you're obviously happy for them, it's a great moment for the city, but we want to be able to do that and have a run like that. We felt that when the Raptors did it too. So, you look at the passion they're playing with, and that's contagious. And you want to be able to also bring that when your time comes,” Rielly said.Unlike the Blue Jays, who rode George Springer’s heroics to victory, the Leafs have struggled in decisive Game 7s, going 0-6 in recent attempts. Fans and players alike know the frustration of falling short, and Rielly’s words highlight the desire for a breakthrough moment. Teammates like Max Domi, William Nylander, and Easton Cowan celebrated the Jays’ success, but the envy is tempered with motivation.The Blue Jays’ surge should be a wake-up call for the Leafs. Seeing a city rally behind a championship run shows what’s possible when talent meets determination. Rielly’s comments reveal that the team hasn’t forgotten its past disappointments and is eager for a breakthrough.Toronto’s stars now have a real-life example of a hero like Springer, whose leadership and clutch performance galvanized an entire city. If the Maple Leafs can harness this momentum and find their own champion, the fans will rally behind them, and Toronto hockey could finally rewrite its postseason story.Morgan Rielly’s reflection is clear: Toronto deserves triumph, and with the right spark, the Maple Leafs could be next.Also Read: Panthers’ Brad Marchand breaks down in tears after heartfelt Bruins tribute during emotional Boston homecoming","Maple Leafs defenseman Morgan Rielly admits he's jealous of Blue Jays' World Series success.

Brad Marchand’s legacy with the Bruins



Brad Marchand, now skating for the Florida Panthers, received a heartfelt welcome from Boston fans during Tuesday night’s matchup at TD Garden. Despite wearing a different jersey, Marchand’s legacy with the Bruins remains undeniable. The veteran forward, who spent 17 unforgettable seasons in Boston, was honored with a moving video tribute that left him visibly emotional. Fans stood and cheered, reminding him that he will always hold a special place in Beantown.Brad Marchand’s trade to the Panthers last March stirred strong reactions among Bruins supporters. Many were upset that Boston allowed one of its all-time greats to leave without a contract extension, sending him to the defending Stanley Cup champions for a conditional 2027 second-round pick. Over seven months later, his return to Boston highlighted the deep connection between the player and the city. The standing ovation at TD Garden was a testament to the impact Marchand had on the franchise and its passionate fanbase.In a pregame interview with NHL Network’s Billy Jaffe, Marchand spoke warmly of his time in Boston. “It still feels like home,” he said. “I still love it here and everything—I'm just on a different journey now.It will always have a special place in my heart. I loved every second here. The great thing is I'm not moving off to a place I dislike or don't want to be in. I'm in another incredible place, another incredible organization.”Drafted in the third round in 2006, Marchand made his NHL debut in 2010 and quickly became a fan favorite for his relentless, hard-nosed style. Over 17 seasons, he etched his name into Bruins history, ranking fourth in games played, fourth in goals, sixth in assists, and fifth in total points. Beyond the numbers, Marchand’s tenacity, leadership, and memorable moments on the ice forged a lasting bond with fans that transcends a jersey change.Tuesday night’s return served as both a celebration of his achievements and a reminder of what he meant to Boston hockey. For fans, Marchand may now wear a Panthers uniform, but in the hearts of many, he will always be synonymous with the Bruins.Also Read: “Please, just…”: Brad Marchand’s wife Katrina urges Bruins fans to show love during his emotional return to Boston",Brad Marchand returned to Boston for the first time since his trade to the Panthers last March.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma ’s much-anticipated return to India colours didn’t go as planned in Perth, but a strong comeback in the second ODI against Australia at Adelaide on Thursday, October 23, could reignite excitement among fans.Adelaide Oval has historically been a fortress for Kohli.In ODIs at this venue, he has scored 244 runs in four matches at an impressive average of 61, including two centuries.His Test record at the ground is even more remarkable, with 537 runs in five matches at an average of 53.70, featuring three centuries.Combined across formats—including ODIs, Tests, and T20Is—Kohli has played 12 matches at Adelaide, scoring 975 runs at an average of 65, with five centuries and a highest score of 141, along with 10 catches.Rohit, on the other hand, has had a modest record at Adelaide.Across six ODIs, he has scored 131 runs at an average of 21.83, with a highest score of 43. Despite this, his experience and match-winning potential make him a key figure in India’s batting line-up.Returning to international cricket after seven months, both stalwarts struggled in the series opener at Perth.Rohit was dismissed for 8 runs, while Kohli lasted just eight balls before being sent back to the pavilion for a duck.India cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar believes the Perth flop should not be overemphasised.“They were playing on probably the bounciest pitch in Australia. It wasn’t going to be easy, especially for players who haven’t played international cricket for a couple of months. It was challenging for Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer, who usually play regularly,” Gavaskar said.He added, “India are still a very, very good team. They’ve won the Champions Trophy. Don’t be surprised if Rohit and Kohli score big in the next two games. The more they play, the more time they spend in the nets, the more throwdowns they get — maybe even from reserve bowlers bowling from 20 yards instead of 22 — the quicker they’ll find their rhythm. Once they’re back among the runs, India’s total will be 300, 300-plus.”","Adelaide Oval has historically been a fortress for Virat Kohli.

La Liga has canceled plans to host a historic Barcelona versus Villarreal match in Miami this December due to mounting uncertainty within Spain, marking the end of what would have been the first European league fixture played abroad.The match, originally scheduled for December 20 at the Hard Rock Stadium, will now take place at Villarreal's home ground, Estadio de la Ceramica.La Liga's promoter decided to cancel the event, with the organisation expressing deep regret that the project could not proceed, viewing it as a missed opportunity to showcase Spanish football internationally.Barcelona issued a statement accepting the decision, noting they had also accepted the initial decision to play in Miami.""Barcelona respect and accept the decision to cancel the match against Villarreal in Miami... just as we respected and accepted the decision to play when it was made at the time,"" the club stated.The Catalans also expressed disappointment about missing the chance to expand in a strategic market and that US fans would miss seeing the game in person.The timing of La Liga's announcement drew criticism from Villarreal coach Marcelino Garcia Toral, as it came during his team's Champions League match against Manchester City.""It seems to me an absolute lack of respect to put out a statement at half-time of a game about something that was planned but will not happen. It's a lack of respect to the directors of the club, the club itself, the professionals and the fans,"" Marcelino stated.The proposal faced significant opposition within Spain. The Spanish Footballers' Association organised protests, with players remaining stationary for 15 seconds at the start of each league match last weekend.Real Madrid opposed the plan institutionally, with their captain Dani Carvajal telling La Liga president Javier Tebas that playing games abroad would be ""a stain"" on the competition.Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois argued it would adulterate the competition.La Liga has attempted to organise overseas matches for several years. This attempt came closest to fruition after receiving permission from UEFA , European football's governing body.UEFA maintained its general opposition to overseas games but agreed to allow this match as an exception, along with an upcoming Serie A match between AC Milan and Como planned for Australia in February.The ticket presale, scheduled to begin on Tuesday, was initially delayed before the entire plan was abandoned.","La Liga cancels plans to host a historic Barcelona versus Villarreal match in Miami this December.

Why Kevin Durant ditched 35 and embraced No. 7 as the Houston Rockets star embarks on a new chapter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/why-kevin-durant-ditched-35-and-embraced-no-7-as-the-houston-rockets-star-embarks-on-a-new-chapter/articleshow/124729357.cms,"Kevin Durant.

Why did Kevin Durant choose no.7 over no.35 this season?

What could the change of jersey numbers mean for Kevin Durant and his fans?

Houston Rockets star Kevin Durant is all set to play in the 2025-26 season that starts on Tuesday with his jersey no.7. The 2x NBA champion and Finals MVP has given up no.35 and embraced no.7, and that could be a game-changer. For most of his career, no.35 was acknowledged as his signature number, and he played almost all the matches wearing this number. Why did Kevin Durant opt for this change just before the season started, and what could be the real reason behind this change of numbers? Here is a detailed look at why the Houston Rockets star wants the change:There are no clear and valid reasons as to why the Rockets' star, Kevin Durant, has chosen this number. Probably because his signature jersey was available during his trade to the Houston Rockets. Kevin Durant has played for the Seattle Supersonics, Oklahoma City Thunder, Golden State Warriors, and Phoenix Suns while wearing the no.35.Houston Rockets star Kevin Durant has worn the no.35 jersey almost his whole life. However, this season, the Slip Reaper has decided to wear the no.7 jersey, and he does look extra slim and sleek while wearing it.Fans and media might think that this would be Durant’s first time wearing no.7. However, things are quite the opposite. Previously, Durant has rocked with this number while playing for the Brooklyn Nets.There is a hint of nostalgia when it comes to wearing the jersey no.35, and his fans know it well. This number honors his first coach, Charles Craig, who was murdered at the age of 35. However, he is no longer wearing this current number, which might seem a bit outdated for his current team. Also, fans are used to seeing him wearing this number, and while they don’t want a change, they might have to adapt to this.Currently, Kevin Durant is wearing jersey no.7 for the upcoming season 2025-26, which is a fresh beginning and a new start for the Houston Rockets, as well as for Durant, who once rocked in this number. However, for fans, no.7 might be less significant as compared to no.35, which used to be his signature number.Also read: What are Kevin Durant’s off-court interests?

American chess Grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky took his last breath on Sunday, at the age of 29, his family confirmed on Monday.Naroditsky, known as “Danya” in the chess community, was among the world’s top-ranked blitz players and a well-known chess commentator, author, and content creator.Till now there has no news on the reason behind the death, however, former World Chess Champion Vladimir Kramnik has alleged a foul play, hinting at possible drug use and alleging that signs of distress were ignored by those close to Naroditsky.Vladimir Kramnik, who previously accused Naroditsky of cheating in 2024, shared screenshots on social media from a private message sent by a viewer who had watched Naroditsky’s final stream.The message expressed concern over Naroditsky’s condition and questioned whether he was under the influence of drugs.Sharing the screenshot, Kramnik tweeted, ""What exactly happened? Because I received this two days ago from a friend of mine, chess fan, and at least did what I could to warn people to do something urgently in my posts.

Naroditsky, ranked among the world's top 75 in Rapid and top 25 in Blitz, had to defend himself in the court of public opinion.He strongly denied the allegations, stating that his streaming setup had been misinterpreted by Kramnik.

Luka Doncic, acquired in a blockbuster trade from the Dallas Mavericks last February, is entering his first full season with the franchise. After a full offseason of recovery and training, the Slovenian superstar looks ready to carry the Lakers’ offense - and their championship hopes - on his shoulders.Doncic expressed fierce determination during pregame interviews, telling reporters, “I aim to win every match… we’re going all in.” That confidence echoes throughout the Lakers locker room, where belief in the team’s potential runs high despite the absence of their long-time leader. LeBron James ’ continued battle with sciatica has forced the Los Angeles Lakers to adjust early. The 40-year-old legend is expected to miss several weeks, leaving a significant void both on and off the court. Meanwhile, veteran forward Maxi Kleber remains sidelined with an abdominal strain and will be re-evaluated in a couple of weeks, according to Silver Screen and Roll.The silver lining? Doncic is fully healthy after last season’s calf injury, and Lakers fans are eager to see how he meshes with offseason additions Deandre Ayton and Marcus Smart.Of course, any Lakers-Warriors clash means one thing: Stephen Curry. The two-time MVP will lead Golden State into hostile territory, setting up a marquee duel between two of the game’s most creative offensive minds.Analysts expect fireworks. NBC Sports projects high-scoring potential given both teams’ revamped lineups and perimeter threats. While LeBron’s absence removes one superstar from the mix, Doncic’s presence more than compensates, ensuring fans still get the heavyweight spectacle they crave.For Luka Doncic , tonight isn’t just about stats - it’s about sending a message. After years of playoff frustration in Dallas, he now has a fresh start in one of the league’s most storied franchises. With a sold-out crowd, national television spotlight, and the Warriors on the other side, Doncic has every opportunity to make an early-season statement.If he delivers - and early signs suggest he will - the Los Angeles Lakers could quickly shift from uncertainty to legitimate title contenders.• Tip-off: 10:30 PM ET at Crypto.com Arena• Broadcast: ESPN & NBA League Pass• Key Absences: LeBron James (sciatica), Maxi Kleber (abdominal strain)• Watch For: Doncic–Curry duel, Ayton’s Lakers debut, JJ Redick’s offensive schemesAlso read: Los Angeles Lakers vs Golden State Warriors (October 21, 2025) prediction, odds, best NBA prop bets, moneyline, spread, and more Even without LeBron James, tonight’s Los Angeles Lakers vs Warriors opener feels electric.

The Buffalo Sabres are once again facing tough roster decisions to end their 14-year playoff drought. Amidst a slow start in the season, and losing their first three games, it is speculated that the Buffalo may hold a massive sell-off of talent to rebuild another. Their inconsistent performance has frustrated fans and analysts, which prompted this speculation that the team could soon enter sell-off mode if things don’t improve. However, it is still seen as a media conjecture, and nothing has been confirmed so far.Amidst a very slow start, the NHL team Buffalo Sabres , is currently facing trade speculation amidst their constant struggle to win. The team started the season with a slow start, although they managed to win two games in a row, which temporarily alleviated concerns about their poor start. However, those concerns returned after they lost 4–2 to the Montreal Canadiens on Monday.Their inconsistent performance has frustrated fans and NHL analysts alike, and rumors are circulating that the general manager, Kevyn Adams, may consider trading established players to create space for younger talent and future flexibility.Amidst the ongoing speculation, defenseman Rasmus Dahlin is viewed as the biggest name.However, his $11 million annual salary through the 2031–32 season, combined with a full no-movement clause, would greatly restrict the list of teams that he could be traded to. Meanwhile, fellow blueliners Bowen Byram and Owen Power, with more affordable contracts and fewer protections, are considered more realistic trade assets.With contract talks reportedly paused and unrestricted free agency on the horizon,reports that Alex Tuch's name has been quietly circulated in trade discussions. According to reports, Tuch is likely to be traded as a candidate. The 29-year-old right winger has recently paused his contract extension talks with the Sabres. His current cap hit is $4.75 million, and he also holds a modified no-trade clause, allowing him to block a trade to five specified teams.According to reports, the Boston Bruins and Edmonton Oilers have reportedly expressed interest in acquiring Buffalo Sabres forward Alex Tuch. Recently, in an appearance on the Daily Faceoff Rundown Inside Edition, Tuch’s agent, Brian Bartlett, announced that talks on his client's signing a contract extension with the Sabres have been paused.Owing to this situation, both the Bruins and Oilers are reportedly monitoring Tuch’s situation closely. The 28-year-old winger, known for his strong two-way play and physical presence, could bring valuable depth and versatility to either team’s top six.It is to be noted that Tuch is entering the final year of the seven-year, $33.2 million contract, with a $4.7 million annual cap hit. He originally signed with the Vegas Golden Knights, who selected him 18th overall in the 2014 NHL Draft.However, regarding the trade rumors, if results don’t improve soon, the team may need to reshape the roster and rebuild the team to get quality results for the benefit of the organization.","The Buffalo Sabres are once again facing tough roster decisions to end their 14-year playoff drought.

The Kansas City Chiefs have finally hit their stride. After a shaky start to the 2025 season, Patrick Mahomes Travis Kelce , and the rest of the squad have now put together back-to-back wins — and not just close ones. The Chiefs put up over 30 points in both games, including a dominant 31–0 shutout against the Las Vegas Raiders. With the return of wide receiver Rashee Rice from suspension and the offense looking more like itself, Travis Kelce isn’t hiding his excitement.After weeks of inconsistency, Kansas City has started to look like a team ready to make another run. First came a 30–17 win over the Detroit Lions. Then, they rolled over the Raiders with a blowout that wasn’t close from the opening quarter. Rashee Rice’s return gave Mahomes another option, and the passing game clicked early. Kelce made a statement in the first quarter, catching three passes from Mahomes, including a 44-yard touchdown that helped break the game open. After the win, Kelce shared some game photos on Instagram and let fans — and the rest of the league — know how he really feels about where the team is heading. He looked fired up in every shot, smiling, celebrating and clearly enjoying being back in rhythm with Mahomes.""We're really groovin' now!!"" he wrote, adding a disco ball emoji for good measure.Travis Kelce is 36 years old and in his 13th season with the Chiefs. After last season’s 40-22 Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, some wondered if he would consider hanging up his boots and retire. Instead, he decided to run it back — and right now, he’s clearly having his time in the sun. So far this season, Kelce has 31 catches for 375 yards and two touchdowns. After the Raiders win, he doubled down on his optimism for the rest of the year. ""I think it's just a glimpse of what you're going to see from here on out... sky's the limit for this group, baby.""Next up for Kansas City is a Monday Night Football showdown against the Washington Commanders on October 27.

Having spent 18 seasons with the Packers, this matchup carries significant emotional and historical weight for the four-time MVP. Achieving this feat would immortalize him among the game's greatest signal-callers.

Aaron Rodgers could join football’s most exclusive quarterback club

Only a handful of quarterbacks have come close



When Aaron Rodgers takes the field against the Green Bay Packers, it won’t just be another gam, it will be a full-circle moment in one of the NFL’s most storied careers. The 41-year-old quarterback, now with the Pittsburgh Steelers, has the rare chance to join an elite group of signal-callers who have defeated all 32 current NFL teams. For Rodgers, who spent 18 seasons in Green Bay and brought home four MVP awards and a Super Bowl title, this matchup carries layers of emotion and legacy.Only four quarterbacks in NFL history—Brett Favre, Peyton Manning, Drew Brees, and Tom Brady—have managed to notch a win against every team in the league. Now, Rodgers could become the fifth to achieve that feat. Each of his predecessors faced a poetic twist in their journeys: Favre and Manning both had to beat their former teams, while Brees struggled for years to overcome the Baltimore Ravens, and Brady needed just one game in Tampa Bay to topple his old New England Patriots.For Rodgers, the challenge is personal. Having led the Packers to countless wins, he now stands across from the same franchise that defined his prime years. His calm, surgical precision as a passer has earned him the reputation as “the best pure thrower of the football the league has ever seen.” But on this occasion, the stakes stretch beyond stats—they reach into history.While Rodgers is closest to completing the 32-team sweep, several others have fallen just short.Former stars like Kerry Collins, Alex Smith, and Ben Roethlisberger each managed wins against 31 opponents but never completed the full set. Among current players, Patrick Mahomes, Russell Wilson, and Matthew Stafford all sit one victory away from the same milestone—though each is missing a win against a team they once represented or have yet to face.If Rodgers can lead the Steelers past the Packers, it won’t just mark revenge or nostalgia—it will immortalize him among the game’s legends. For a quarterback defined by precision, poise, and pride, this could be the perfect punctuation mark on a Hall of Fame résumé.Also Read: Donna Kelce wins hearts with touching tribute to her “daughters-in-law,” Taylor Swift and Kylie Kelce","Aaron Rodgers has an opportunity to join an elite group of quarterbacks by defeating all 32 NFL teams.

The Florida Panthers have struggled on their current road trip, dropping all four games so far, and hope to finally find their footing on Tuesday in Boston. Their matchup against the Bruins at TD Garden carries extra attention, as longtime Bruins star Brad Marchand makes his first NHL appearance in Boston since being traded to Florida last March.Brad Marchand’s return to Boston is the focal point of Tuesday’s game. Of the 1,107 NHL games Marchand has played, all but 17 were with the Bruins, making this matchup particularly significant. He has also played 23 playoff games with Florida, giving him unique insight into both teams’ dynamics. Marchand expressed excitement ahead of the game: “It’ll be fun to compete against guys I’ve been playing with for a long time and be on the other side of it in here. It’ll be intense, and I’m looking forward to playing in front of the Bruins fans again.”Florida’s road trip has been challenging, with the Panthers outscored 15-4 over four games.

What’s Next for LeBron and the Los Angeles Lakers

Summary of LeBron James’s Status for Lakers vs Warriors

will not take the court tonight as theopen their 2025-26 NBA season against the Golden State Warriors. The 40-year-old superstar remains sidelined while recovering from a sciatica injury that has plagued him since training camp. Entering his remarkable 23rd NBA season, James continues to battle the nerve-related condition that causes pain, burning, and numbness radiating from his lower back down through his leg.The Los Angeles Lakers first announced on October 9, 2025, that LeBron James would miss the start of the season due to the issue, which was initially identified as mild nerve irritation during preseason activities. However, the condition later progressed into a full-blown case of sciatica, forcing the team to rule him out of action for several weeks.Medical staff remain hopeful that a combination of rest and targeted rehabilitation will help him recover, though his return timeline is still uncertain. Current projections suggest that the veteran forward could rejoin the lineup around mid-November, provided his rehab continues to show positive results.Without their iconic leader, the Los Angeles Lakers will rely heavily on Luka Doncic to spearhead the offense against a determined Warriors team led by Stephen Curry.Doncic, entering his first full season with the Lakers following his trade from Dallas, proved last year that he could shoulder the offensive load during LeBron’s absences.He will start tonight alongside Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura, Jarred Vanderbilt, and newly-acquired center Deandre Ayton. The starting five will have to find quick chemistry and maintain composure to match the Warriors’ fast-paced, veteran-driven play.LeBron’s condition, sciatica, typically results from pressure on the sciatic nerve - often caused by disc herniation or spinal strain. While it isn’t usually considered a long-term threat to a player’s career, recovery requires patience, rest, and physical therapy to relieve nerve pressure and inflammation. For an athlete of LeBron James’s age and experience, the medical team is taking extra caution to ensure a full and safe return.The timing of this setback couldn’t be more significant. The Lakers’ season opener against the Warriors at Crypto.com Arena was set to be one of the most anticipated matchups of the year, and LeBron’s absence changes the entire dynamic of the game. The franchise now faces an early test of depth and resilience - with young players and new additions needing to step up under the bright lights of Opening Night.Fans will now look toward mid-November with anticipation, hoping that LeBron can return healthy to resume his pursuit of another championship run. His comeback will undoubtedly be one of the season’s biggest storylines, as the Lakers navigate this challenging stretch without their leader on the floor.• LeBron James is out with a diagnosed sciatica injury as of October 21, 2025.• Expected return is projected for mid-November, depending on rehab progress.• He missed the Lakers’ season opener against the Golden State Warriors at Crypto.com Arena.• Luka Doncic, Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura, Jarred Vanderbilt, and Deandre Ayton lead the Lakers in his absence.• Sciatica involves nerve pain from the lower back down the leg and is treated with rest and physical therapy.Also read: Is Luka Doncic playimg tonight vs Golden State Warriors?

Marco Rubio faces backlash for omitting ‘Hindus’ in Diwali message,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/marco-rubio-faces-backlash-for-omitting-hindus-in-diwali-message/articleshow/124721092.cms,"

US State Secy Marco Rubio Faces Backlash For Omitting Hindus In Diwali Greetings

Symbolism and recognition matter







In a move that has stirred strong reactions online, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio ’s Diwali message has come under fire for not mentioning Hindus, the community at the festival's heart. The official greeting, shared on X (formerly Twitter ), extended “warm wishes to the many communities” celebrating Diwali but made no reference to Hindus. The omission, though subtle, has been viewed by many as a slight to the faith and its followers, especially given Diwali’s deep cultural and religious roots within Hinduism.Rubio’s message, released through the US State Department, followed the diplomatic tone of inclusivity — wishing “those celebrating Diwali” joy and peace. However, the absence of any mention of Hindus struck a nerve. Critics argue that describing Diwali as celebrated by “many communities” effectively dilutes its identity and overlooks its unmistakable Hindu origins. While Jains, Sikhs, and Buddhists observe Diwali in smaller cultural contexts, its essence — the triumph of light over darkness, of dharma over adharma — is fundamentally rooted in Hindu tradition.Social media users quickly highlighted this gap, many expressed that such a high-profile message, stripped of cultural specificity, felt dismissive of Hindu identity rather than inclusive.For millions of Hindus worldwide, Diwali is not merely a cultural festival — it is a sacred celebration honouring Lord Ram’s return to Ayodhya, the goddess Lakshmi’s blessings, and the victory of light over ignorance.Failing to acknowledge the community that gave the world this festival, many believe, reduces Diwali to a generic occasion. Critics see this as part of a broader trend where Western institutions attempt to universalise religious festivals, often erasing their spiritual and cultural origins in the process.From a diplomatic perspective, Rubio’s message may have aimed for neutrality. Yet, in doing so, it overlooked the symbolic weight such recognition carries. For a community long striving for cultural visibility in global discourse, the omission of “Hindus” from a Diwali greeting feels less like an oversight — and more like indifference dressed as inclusivity.","US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s Diwali message has come under fire for not mentioning Hindus, the community at the festival's heart.

The Detroit Lions kept their hot streak alive with a 24-9 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Monday night, but the final score wasn’t what had people fired up after the game. A second-quarter call from the officials — one that took a potential catch away from Tampa Bay — quickly turned the spotlight away from Detroit’s defense and onto the referees. What looked like a solid play for the Bucs turned into a momentum swing for the Lions, and fans didn’t hold back.The biggest moment of controversy came when Buccaneers tight end Cade Otton went up for a contested catch. He seemed to hang on long enough before Lions DB Arthur Maulet stripped the ball away. Most viewers thought it was a completed catch followed by a fumble. But the refs ruled it an interception — giving the ball to Detroit — and even after review, the call stood. The decision immediately blew up online. Former NFL punter and ESPN analyst Pat McAfee summed up how a lot of fans were feeling when he posted this on X: ""The NFL (is) looking out for Detroit. . LOVE TO SEE IT,"" he wrote.The refs got most of the attention, but the game itself was rough on both sides. Detroit started strong with a touchdown catch from Amon-Ra St. Brown, but after that, both teams struggled to do much. There were a lot of punts and messy drives in the first half.Rookie running back Jahmyr Gibbs gave the Lions a bit of a spark in the second quarter. He fought through a tough drive and scored, giving Detroit a bigger lead. The rest of the night wasn’t much better. There were missed chances, fumbles, and two straight interceptions. Sterling Shepard lost a fumble for the Lions, but Tampa couldn’t take advantage — they missed the field goal. Tampa Bay’s only first-half points came from a Chase McLaughlin field goal just before the break. It didn’t do much to change the game.The Lions now sit at 5-1 and are looking like one of the most well-rounded teams in the NFC. They’ve found success on both sides of the ball, even in games like this where the offense wasn’t clicking on every drive. But even with the win, it’s the officiating that everyone’s still talking about. That second-quarter interception call won’t be forgotten anytime soon, especially by Buccaneers fans who felt the game slipped away unfairly.Tampa Bay drops to 3-3 and leaves Detroit with more questions than answers — and one frustrating highlight they’ll probably be watching for the rest of the week.","The Detroit Lions beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 24-9 on Monday night.

The story behind the lawsuit

Jury verdict and what it means for Jack Nicklaus

In a major victory for golf legend Jack Nicklaus, a Florida jury ruled in favor of the golfer in a $50 million defamation lawsuit against his past holding firm. The golfer, who is currently 85 years old, had been suing ex-business partners for allegedly making false statements that defamed him. The decision is a significant victory for Nicklaus, whose standing in the golf and business worlds had been questioned during the dispute.The lawsuit arose from a lengthy feud involving Jack Nicklaus and the Nicklaus Companies, which oversees his golf design and copyright holdings. Nicklaus sold the rights to his name, image and golf design work in 2007 for about $145 million. In 2017 he resigned from an executive position, and when he did, a five-year non-compete began which temporarily blocked him from independent work.At the heart of the suit were alleged defamatory statements against Nicklaus from the company’s leadership. The most prominent allegation was the report that he had taken or considered a $750 million contract to join the Saudi-backed LIV Golf League. Those statements were ""entirely false"" and ""defamatory,"" Nicklaus said.His attorneys claimed these accusations were leaked to the press and created a public relations nightmare.Then there were also some about his mental conditioning, which Nicklaus was not going to abide by. His attorneys also told the court that a 2021 meeting with officials from Golf Saudi was strictly for golf-course design, not about signing up for LIV Golf. Nicklaus said he quickly turned down any talk of LIV because of his loyalty to the PGA Tour and his values.However, the jury in Florida ruled in favour of Jack Nicklaus finding that false statements had been made which damaged the sporting icon's reputation. He was ordered $50 million in damages, the verdict also stated. The jury imposed personal liability on the Nicklaus Companies but not on two individuals, including billionaire Howard Milstein.Also Read: Tiger Woods vs Jack Nicklaus vs Rory McIlroy: PGA Tour wins, majors, and stats compared Nicklaus's attorney acknowledged that it was a difficult case due to the high bar to show injury to a public figure's reputation. But there was enough merit to convince the jury that Nicklaus had been the victim of some foul play. The ruling closes the book on a lengthy and contentious saga between the golf icon and his erstwhile business partners, providing Nicklaus a solid legal and personal win as he continues to preserve his status in the game he basically created.","Jack Nicklaus wins $50 million defamation lawsuit against ex-business partners.

The family’s role in shaping Auston Matthews’ rise







Auston Matthews, the captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs, is one of the most dominant forces in the NHL today. Known for his incredible scoring touch and calm leadership, his rise to hockey stardom didn’t happen overnight. Behind his success stands a strong and supportive family, especially his parents, Brian and Ema Matthews, whose influence shaped his journey to becoming one of the NHL’s biggest stars.Auston’s mother, Ema Matthews, was born and raised in Mexico and later moved to California. She dreamed of becoming a pilot, but due to high training costs and gender limitations at the time, she pursued a career as a flight attendant instead. While working for Aero California, she often flew routes to Los Angeles — a decision that would change her life forever. In addition to her aviation career, Ema also worked for Starbucks, balancing her job with her ambitions and showing her strong work ethic from an early age.On one of those flights, she met Brian Matthews, who was working part-time for an airline while playing baseball at Loyola Marymount University.Their connection was instant, and that spark eventually led to the foundation of a close-knit and loving family. Ema has always been a major emotional anchor in Auston’s life. Her cultural roots and nurturing personality gave Auston a deep sense of discipline and humility that reflects in how he carries himself on and off the ice.Auston’s father, Brian Matthews, is a former baseball pitcher from Loyola Marymount University. A dedicated athlete himself, Brian originally hoped Auston would follow in his footsteps and play baseball. However, when he noticed his son’s growing fascination with hockey, he gave his full support. Brian was instrumental in helping Auston train, practice, and stay focused through his early years in Scottsdale, Arizona. His understanding of athletic discipline and competitive mindset became key influences on Auston’s development.Brian Matthews’ guidance helped Auston Matthews become one of the top NHL stars, showcasing the impact of parental support in shaping elite athletes. Growing up in Scottsdale, Arizona, Auston Matthews trained at local hockey programs that are now recognized as top youth hockey development centers, cementing his path to NHL stardom.When Auston was just two months old, the Matthews family moved to Scottsdale, Arizona — a place not exactly known for hockey. Yet, his parents made every effort to nurture his interest. From taking him to early morning practices to supporting his time with the USA Hockey National Team Development Program and later in Switzerland with ZSC Lions, Brian and Ema stood by every decision.Their constant encouragement and belief shaped Auston into the player he is today — a record-breaking Maple Leafs captain, a multiple Rocket Richard Trophy winner, and one of the most admired figures in the NHL.

Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson has been sidelined with a hamstring injury since Week 5, missing the past two games. While it was widely expected that Jackson would return after the team's Week 7 bye, his absence from Monday’s first practice back has cast doubt on his availability for Sunday’s important game against the Chicago Bears. With the Ravens sitting at 1-5, Jackson’s presence is critical as Baltimore looks to turn around a disappointing start to the 2025 NFL season.Jackson’s hamstring injury, sustained in the September 28 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, has kept him off the field since. The two-time NFL MVP did not participate in Monday’s practice — the Ravens’ first since their bye week — raising questions about whether he will be ready to start against the Bears in Week 8. While early-week practices are often light sessions focused on rest and recovery following a bye, Jackson’s absence is still notable given the urgency of the upcoming matchup.Jamison Hensley of ESPN reported, “QB Lamar Jackson remains sidelined with a hamstring injury. The 2-time NFL MVP did not participate in Monday’s practice, which was the Ravens’ first one since coming off the bye. Jackson hasn’t suited up since injuring his hamstring in Kansas City on Sept.28.”As the week progresses, the Ravens’ injury report on Wednesday will be crucial in determining Jackson’s playing status. Even a limited practice could signal that Jackson is on track to return after missing two games. Should he remain sidelined, backup quarterback Cooper Rush would be tasked with starting a third consecutive game, a scenario that could shift betting lines significantly.Baltimore’s 1-5 record has put the team in a must-win situation, especially with losses coming in Jackson’s absence. The Ravens fell to both the Houston Texans and Los Angeles Rams without their star quarterback, showing just how vital Jackson’s return would be for their playoff hopes. Despite the slow start to the season, Jackson showed strong play in the games he started, throwing for 869 yards, 10 touchdowns, and only one interception, while rushing for 166 yards and scoring once himself.If Jackson can return and play at his best, he could spark the Ravens’ season and potentially make a case for MVP consideration as Baltimore fights to reach the postseason.","Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson has been sidelined with a hamstring injury since Week 5.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has suggested that the types of jobs that are being eliminated or transformed by artificial intelligence (AI) may not be consideredin the long run. During an interview with Rowan Cheung at OpenAI ’s recent DevDay conference, Altman was asked about the possibility of AI destroying almost a billion knowledge-worker jobs before new ones are created. Altman used a thought experiment about a farmer from half a century ago to explain the situation. He said that a farmerAltman suggested that this perspective makes him feelabout the job losses.
