""It's a great question,"" the seven-time Super Bowl champion answered in a mailbag segment on the 'NFL on FOX' YouTube channel. ""It's kind of like your kids. It's hard to choose one favorite. But let me give you one.”He continued, ""I would say Buffalo—and for a number of reasons. [Number] one, It was a very close flight when I played for the Patriots to actually get there. So I loved going to Buffalo because it was a quick flight there and back. The second reason is they have incredible fans in Buffalo. Every time you would drive into the stadium, it was like the craziest environments from 9 a.m. on. Those fans know how to get it rocking. That stadium was always crazy.""He further added, ""And the third part was, we had a lot of success there. So there were a lot of big games, they were a tough division rival, it felt like football weather all the time. It was challenging, it was rainy, it was wet, it was windy, it was cold. The games always meant something, and we found a way to overcome it.”Also Read: The NFL may expand its rules to prevent conflicts of interest for Tom Brady following his interview with Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes Highmark Stadium is a stadium located in Orchard Park, New York, United States, within the Southtowns of the Buffalo metropolitan area.

Taylor Swift sent a heartfelt gift to Travis Kelce, a Chiefs teammate

Taylor Swift's relationship with the Kansas City Chiefs family has been the talk of town because of public appearances and heartwarming gestures.

During a game on November 10, Swift cuddled Cianna, Chariah Gordon and Hardman Jr.'s daughter. Chariah Gordon and Taylor Swift clicked right away. The two Kansas City Chiefs WAGs only know each other for a year, but it feels like they have been friends for life, claims Gordon.While in Europe for her Eras Tour, Swift sent a gift to Gordon’s daughter. “It’s so freaking cute and so thoughtful,” Gordon, 29, told Glamour in an interview published on Monday, November 18. “In between shows … was keeping my kids super near.” Gordon expressed her excitement about her relationship with Swift during a conversation with Glamour. “I actually got a chance to meet her at Trav’s house and she was just super, super sweet,” she said. “And since then we’ve been super cool. I call her my sis. That’s my sis.”Gordon noted that Swift doesn’t act like an A-list celebrity. “She’s just really a sweet, down-to-earth girl. I forgot that she was even Taylor Swift, that’s how she makes you feel,” Gordon said. “I wasn’t saying, ‘Oh my God, this is Taylor.’ I’m like, ‘Oh, this is one of my home girls from back home.’ That’s how I felt.

India's cricket team faces a challenging Border-Gavaskar Trophy series against Australia, starting on Friday. Memories of their 2021 victory in Brisbane remain fresh, but both teams enter the series struggling for form.India, still recovering from a disappointing home series loss to New Zealand, needs a strong showing. The team's hopes for a third consecutive World Test Championship final appearance have dwindled after their recent defeat. A 4-0 series win is crucial to secure their place in the final.Also See: Live Cricket Score Achieving a 4-0 victory in Australia is a daunting task. India's recent form suggests they are capable of a comeback, especially when facing low expectations.This series holds significant weight for key players like Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and Ravichandran Ashwin. Kohli's dominance in Australia, including his memorable four centuries in 2014, is etched in the minds of fans and opponents alike. Cheteshwar Pujara and Rishabh Pant's past performances against the Australian bowlers add to the intrigue.This series may hinge on the bowlers' performances. India's pace spearhead, Jasprit Bumrah, carries the responsibility of setting the tone against an Australian batting lineup that has shown vulnerability even on home soil.Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep are likely to join Bumrah in the pace attack. However, Prasidh Krishna and Harshit Rana are also vying for a spot with their impressive skills.There is a 25% chance of rain during the first part of the Test match. AccuWeather predicts clear skies afterwards, so there shouldn't be many weather-related delays during the match.The pitch at the Optus Stadium is anticipated to offer pace and bounce, favouring the faster bowlers. Batting conditions are expected to be ideal during the initial two days of the match.As the game progresses, spinners who can extract bounce from the pitch are likely to become more influential.Australia and India have played 107 Test matches against each other.Australia has won 45 matches, while India has won 32 matches.Both teams have tied 1 match and drawn 29 matches.Jasprit Bumrah (C), Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Devdutt Padikkal, Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant (wk), Dhruv Jurel, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep, Harshit Rana, Prasidh Krishna, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Washington Sundar.Pat Cummins (C), Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Nathan McSweeney, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc.Rishabh PantVirat Kohli, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Marnus LabuschagneRavichandran Ashwin, Nathan McSweeneyNathan Lyon, Pat Cummins, Jasprit Bumrah, Akash Deep","India's cricket team faces a challenging Border-Gavaskar Trophy series against Australia, starting on Friday.

NEW DELHI: Aaryavir, the son of former Indian cricket star Virender Sehwag , achieved a remarkable feat on Thursday by scoring a double hundred whilst representing Delhi against Meghalaya at the MCA Cricket Ground in Shillong in the Cooch Behar Trophy .After choosing to bat first in the match that commenced on Wednesday, Meghalaya managed to score 260 runs in their first innings.Delhi responded strongly on Day 2, establishing a commanding lead of 208 runs at stumps with only two wickets down, following an impressive 180-run partnership between Aaryavir and Arnav S Bugga for the opening wicket.Whilst Bugga notched up a century before departing, Aaryavir carried on to achieve a remarkable double hundred. He remained not out on 200 from 229 deliveries, his innings featuring 34 fours and two sixes, as Delhi reached 468 for two. At the other end, Dhanya Nakra was unbeaten on 98, scored from 91 balls.In October, Aaryavir made an impressive debut in the Vinoo Mankad Trophy, scoring 49 runs against Manipur to guide Delhi to a six-wicket victory.Sehwag revealed last year that his son was already aspiring to secure an IPL contract.""My son is 15 years old and is already working hard to get a chance to play in the IPL,"" he said on Star Sports.""The IPL has benefited young talent the most. Earlier, nobody got noticed from Ranji Trophy performances and hence couldn't make it to the Indian team. But now, if you perform well in the IPL and you showcase your talent, then immediately, you get an opportunity to play for the Indian team. Because of the IPL, so many children from smaller states of the country have started taking cricket seriously and try their best to participate in the IPL and strive hard for it,"" he added.","Aaryavir Sehwag scored a double hundred for Delhi against Meghalaya.

Proven Performances in Australia

Recent Form Against New Zealand

Effectiveness Against Left-Handers

NEW DELHI: Team India all-rounder Washington Sundar 's inclusion in India's playing XI for the first Test against Australia finds strong justification in his recent performances and strategic value, particularly in Australian conditions.Stand-in captain Jasprit Bumrah confirmed Sundar's role as the lone spinner, a decision grounded in both his past success and current form.""Washi is the lone spinner,"" Bumrah said after winning the toss, confirming his selection ahead of seasoned veterans like Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja Sundar has previously excelled in Australia, as evidenced by his contributions during the previous Border-Gavaskar Trophy . In just two matches, he has a batting average of 42, with the highest score of 62 in the cruel Australian conditions.With the ball, he has delivered economical spells, claiming four wickets, including best figures of 3/89. These numbers only showcase his ability to adapt to Australian pitches, both with bat and ball.Sundar's recent exploits in the home series against New Zealand, despite the 3-0 whitewash, further strengthen his case. With the ball, he produced awe-inspiring figures of 7/59 and 4/56 in Pune, followed by a commendable 4/81 in Wankhede.These performances reflect his ability to pick wickets consistently, including dismissals of top-order batters.Additionally, his contributions with the bat prove his versatility as a lower-order batsman, which adds depth to the Indian batting lineup.Australia’s batting lineup for this Test features five left-handed batters—Usman Khawaja, Travis Head, Alex Carey, Mitchell Starc, and Josh Hazlewood.Sundar’s off-spin naturally poses a threat to left-handers, as his ability to turn the ball away creates doubts in their minds.This tactical edge is invaluable, especially on pitches that might offer variable bounce or spin as the game progresses.Sundar’s inclusion also addresses India’s need for balance. His past record in Australia, recent standout performances, and tactical utility against Australia’s left-handed heavy lineup make him a deserving member of the playing XI.","Washington Sundar named in India's playing XI for first Test against Australia.

Jon Gruden still can't let go of the 2002 AFC’s tuck rule

Jon Gruden is a professional football coach born in the United States. He is an advisor to the Milano Seamen of the European League of Football. He served as a head coach for the Raiders franchise during their tenure in Oakland from 1998 to 2001; he won two consecutive division titles and appeared in an AFC Championship Game. In a video tour of his Fired Football Coaches Association (FFCA) office, Gruden proudly shows off a few framed jerseys before turning to his pièce de résistance: a massive photo of the famed Tom Brady 's "" tuck rule "" play situated right in front of his toilet.Jon Gruden, former Oakland Raiders coach and Barstool Sports personality, can't let go of the ""tuck rule,"" the momentum-swinging call in the 2002 playoff match between the Raiders and the Patriots. He probably sees it at least once daily. In an office video tour, Gruden displays his framed jerseys and a big-picture photo of the ""tuck rule"" play-set right in front of his toilet. ""Still makes me sick when I think of the Patriots,"" Gruden emphatically notes, panning away from the picture. ""I can't help but fall to my knees when I think of the tuck rule.""In a 2002 AFC divisional playoff game, Tom Brady was sacked by Raiders cornerback Charles Woodson and had the ball knocked from his grasp, and the Raiders recovered the fumble to win. But the referee invoked the ""tuck rule,"" ruling that Brady's arm was still in motion before he tucked it back into his body, the play, therefore, an incomplete pass. And New England won in overtime. Quarterback Josh Gruden was traded to Tampa Bay.Following a Patriots possession, Brady hit David Patten with a 13-yard pass to the Raiders' 29. Two incompletions and a Brady scramble later, Vinatieri came on to hit a game-tying 45-yard field goal through the snow with only 27 seconds remaining, a kick that is often considered one of the most difficult in NFL history,[16] or the most ""clutch-kick ever."" [17] The Raiders let the game go into overtime after the Patriots ran off most of the last few ticks of the clock following the kickoff.The Patriots won the toss and received. They marched 61 yards in 15 plays, with Brady completing all eight of his pass attempts, going 45 yards. On fourth down and 4 from the Raiders' 28, Brady hit Patten for a six-yard completion. Three plays later, Antowain Smith picked up eight yards for a first down at the Oakland 9 and the Patriots, now going against the wind, fought to set up the game-winning kick. After Brady dove to the 5 and centered the ball, Vinatieri kicked a 23-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 16–13 victory and advancing them to the AFC Championship Game. Brady completed 26 of 39 passes for 238 yards in the second half.Also Read: Louisville's Tayon Holloway has been suspended indefinitely following his arrest for charges of strangulation and domestic violence assault The ""tuck rule"" was eliminated by the NFL in 2013.

"""Hasn't been quite as good”: 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan acknowledged Brock Purdy’s lack of improvement in year three",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/hasnt-been-quite-as-good-49ers-head-coach-kyle-shanahan-acknowledged-brock-purdys-lack-of-improvement-in-year-three/articleshow/115514237.cms,"Image via LAPRESSE

Kyle Shanahan on Brock Purdy's progress

The San Francisco 49ers are headed into some uncertainty in the 2024 NFL season after a 20-17 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, dropping them to 5-5. Quarterback Brock Purdy , who was once a rising seventh-round pick, has been at the center of some discussions with a right shoulder injury.Purdy started his rookie NFL season after injuries to Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo. He won all five regular-season games and contributed to the 49ers' ten-game winning streak, securing a division title and an NFC Championship Game appearance. In 2023, he led the 49ers to a repeat division title, multiple passing categories, and an appearance in Super Bowl LVIII. Purdy also set the franchise's single-season passing yards record.The 49ers will face the Green Bay Packers in Week 12, and there is a question about Brock Purdy's health and performance. He started off on a shaky ground and has so far been the best option under center, but stats haven't reached his first-round performances.When asked about Purdy's development in his third NFL season, head coach Kyle Shanahan didn't sugarcoat his response.

""I think Brock's playing at the exact same level.""Shanahan's comments defended Purdy's consistency, but they resonated with fans who expected the young quarterback to improve, leading to disappointment and criticism on social media. ""To say Brock hasn't made ANY progress in year three is backstabbing on your QB,"" one fan posted, reflecting a sentiment shared by many.Shanahan suggested that Purdy's perceived stagnation may be influenced by the team's overall struggles in 2024. ""Our team hasn't been quite as good through this,"" Shanahan added. Shanahan's comments have significant implications for the 49ers, as Purdy's rookie contract is nearing its end.

Yashasvi Jaiswal vs left arm pace

Five innings

58 balls

29 runs

Four dismissals

NEW DELHI: India’s batting order faltered under a fierce Australian pace attack on the opening day of the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Perth on Friday.Stand-in captain Jasprit Bumrah’s decision to bat first on a lively pitch seemed to backfire as both Yashasvi Jaiswal and Devdutt Padikkal departed without scoring in their maiden Test innings in Australia.Mitchell Starc set the tone for Australia, starting with a fiery spell despite conceding a boundary from a leg-side bye on the opening delivery. In just the third over, Starc produced a gentle outswinger that lured Jaiswal into a drive, only for the in-form batter to edge it to debutant Nathan McSweeney at gully. Jaiswal’s innings ended abruptly on an eight-ball duck.At the other end, Josh Hazlewood unleashed his own venom, keeping KL Rahul under pressure while targeting Padikkal. In the 11th over, Hazlewood forced an edge off Padikkal’s bat, and Alex Carey completed a simple catch behind the stumps. Padikkal, like Jaiswal, departed for a duck after a 23-ball struggle.India’s top order collapse left them reeling at 18 for 2 in the first hour of play, with Australia firmly in control.

NEW DELHI: India's stand-in captain Jasprit Bumrah , leading the team in the absence of Rohit Sharma , has suggested that Mohammed Shami might join the Test squad during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. This depends on Shami's continued progress in his recovery.The absence of Shami has been a significant point of discussion leading up to the five-Test series against Australia.

However, he recently returned to action in the Ranji Trophy , representing Bengal. He delivered a powerful performance against Madhya Pradesh, taking 7 wickets for 156 runs in two innings, demonstrating his trademark pace and accuracy. This has led to calls for his inclusion in India's Test squad.Speaking to the media prior to the first Test, Bumrah recognised Shami's value to the Test team. He also mentioned the ongoing efforts to assess Shami's fitness and preparedness.""Shami bhai has started to play cricket, and obviously, he is an integral part of this team. I'm sure the management is also keeping a keen eye (on him). Hopefully, things fall in place. If everything goes well, you might see him here as well,"" Bumrah said.Bowling coach Morne Morkel , who witnessed Shami's intensity during the recent home Test series against New Zealand, confirmed the team's close attention to the pacer's progress.Reports suggest that Shami could join the team in Australia during the series.

NEW DELHI: As Indian cricket holds its breath over Mohammed Shami 's fitness, TOI has learnt that the Indian cricket board's ( BCCI ) medical team have a tentative timeline of another 10 days to infer if he is ready for international cricket.Shami made his comeback in competitive cricket after a year in Ranji Trophy match for Bengal last week. While he came out of the match claiming seven wickets in two innings, it is learnt that the BCCI's medical team has been travelling with him and is checking up on him after each spell.TOI understands that the medical team and the selectors want to see how his body holds up after a round of Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (SMAT) matches. BCCI's head of sports science Nitin Patel and National Cricket Academy (NCA) trainer Nishant Bordoloi have taken over Shami 's training and recovery routine even when he is with the Bengal team.One of the issues with Shami's recovery is that he needs to shed a decent amount of weight that he put on during his recovery from an ankle surgery and then developing swollen knees last month.""The Indian team management wanted him to ideally play a couple of first-class matches before taking a call on his participation in the five-Test series in Australia. Since the Ranji Trophy first leg is over, the first round of SMAT matches has been kept as a makeshift yardstick. The medical team feels he will start losing weight as he keeps playing matches that will help him build his endurance,"" a BCCI source told TOI.Patel and Bordoloi will be reaching Rajkot on Thursday where Shami will be with the Bengal for SMAT that begins on Nov 23. ""Shami too has been very careful. His bowling skills are never in doubt. He is clocking 135 kmph and above consistently. But one needs to be seen is that when he can let go of the dependency on BCCI's medical team which is treating him after every spell that he is bowling. They are checking if his knees are swelling up again,"" the source added.While there is speculation that Shami may be sent to Australia for the latter half of the tour, TOI understands that it won't be a straightforward call for the selectors.""Bowling two-over spells in T20 matches in SMAT isn't the ideal parameter. To maintain intensity in high-profile Test series is a different ball game. There is a chance he could be sent to train with the Indian team if he clears the SMAT challenge but to play him will be a good call. The selectors are also wary about the ICC Champions Trophy in Feb,"" the source said.","Medical team travelling with him monitors weight, timeline of another 10 days to judge fitness.

Steelers' TJ Watt refuses to take the bait as Myles Garrett Fishes for Apology



The NFL is known for its intense rivalries, and the latest chapter in the ongoing saga between Pittsburgh Steelers' TJ Watt and Cleveland Browns' Myles Garrett is no exception. The two star pass rushers have been locked in a fierce battle for the Defensive Player of the Year award in recent years, and their competitive spirit has often spilled over into public discourse.While Garrett's remarks stirred the pot, Watt's measured response highlighted his focus on team success rather than personal rivalries. The friction can be traced back to February, when Watt posted a cryptic tweet shortly before the Defensive Player of the Year winner was announced. The Steelers’ star, notably absent from the NFL Honors ceremony, tweeted, ""Nothing which I'm not used to.""While Watt moved on, Garrett waited nine months to address the incident publicly, using a press conference to demand an apology. “He’s got to apologize to me when I see him,” Garrett remarked, adding that he had never voiced complaints about missing out on accolades. Shifting the narrative, he emphasized the Browns’ game plan to “win the game and dominate on defense,” while framing the 2024 award race as an open competition.Watt, however, refrained from engaging in a war of words. When asked about Garrett's comments, the Steelers’ four-time team MVP expressed respect for his rival while underscoring his focus on team goals. “I have respect for everybody in the league. Obviously, he’s a guy who has been a top pass rusher in the league for a long time,” Watt said Wednesday, via video from Chris Adamski of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. “But I don’t compete directly against him. It’s our team versus their team, and at the end of the day, I just want the Pittsburgh Steelers to come out with a win.”Statistically, Watt had the upper hand in 2023, leading Garrett in key metrics such as sacks, tackles for loss, QB hits, and forced turnovers. Despite this edge, Watt chose to avoid media-driven drama, a testament to his maturity and team-first mentality.This Thursday's showdown is expected to be a battle of defenses, with both players undoubtedly at the forefront of their respective units. Yet, Watt’s ability to sidestep controversy and focus on his team’s objectives underscores his leadership. While Garrett’s comments may have reignited public discourse about their rivalry, Watt’s response has shown his unwavering commitment to winning, setting a tone for the Steelers as they face a crucial division clash.Also Read: Robert Kraft misses Hall of Fame selection again despite legacy with New England Patriots With Watt’s poise and Garrett’s competitive fire, the game promises to be a thrilling chapter in the ongoing saga of two of the NFL's finest defensive stars.","Pittsburgh Steelers' TJ Watt and Cleveland Browns' Myles Garrett have been locked in a fierce battle for the Defensive Player of the Year award in recent years.

NEW DELHI: The first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Perth witnessed a rare scenario: India are without both Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja in the playing XI.Since Jadeja's debut in 2012, the team has gone into only a handful of Tests without its trusted spin duo, making their absence notable.The last time India fielded a Test XI without either Ashwin or Jadeja was in January 2021, during the famous Brisbane Test at the Gabba.Injuries sidelined both players, forcing India to rely on other options in a match that culminated in a historic series-clinching victory.The match saw all-rounders and backup spinners stepping up in their absence, manifesting India's depth.Before that, India missed the duo in Perth during the 2018 series, another game where the focus shifted entirely to pace-friendly conditions.Similarly, in Johannesburg earlier in 2018, spin was sacrificed for an all-seam attack to exploit the lively South African pitch.This trend dates back to the Adelaide Test in 2014, where India opted for Karn Sharma over the duo.Fast forward to the ongoing Test in Perth (2024), India decided to proceed without their premier spinners, Ashwin and Jadeja.Conditions at the WACA, known for favouring pace and bounce, dictated this decision. Additionally, Washington Sundar 's all-around ability and effectiveness against left-handers provided a strategic alternative.The inclusion of Sundar showcases a bold move from the Team India management to balance attack and control, ensuring that the team’s plans align with the conditions at hand.","India without Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja in Tests since Jadeja's debut in 2012.

Reddy made his India debut in a T20I against Bangladesh on October 6, and before the month added, the 21-year-old had punched his ticket to Australia for the BGT.Shortly after that, India's stand-in captain Jasprit Bumrah won the toss at the Optus Stadium and opted to bat first. India's regular captain Rohit Sharma is unavailable for the first Test as he recently became a father again and has stayed back to be with his wife.What augurs well for the 21-year-old Reddy is that he was in Australia early with the India 'A' side for the four-day matches against the Australian 'A' team and is well acclimatized to the conditions. However, he didn't do much of note in the two unofficial Tests.Reddy has so far played 23 first-class matches since making his Ranji Trophy debut in 2020. Besides scoring 779 runs in 39 innings, including a hundred and two fifties, he has taken 56 wickets.The 22-year-old Rana, a right-arm fast bowler from Delhi, made his Indian Premier League (IPL) debut before playing his first first-class match for Delhi, which was in December 2022.Rana was one of the key performers for Kolkata Knight Riders in their IPL triumph earlier this year. Rana took 19 wickets in the tournament.In 10-first-class matches so far, Rana has taken 43 wickets at an average of 24.00 with his best effort in an innings being 7 for 45.

India XI:

India won the toss and decided to bat in the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia on Friday (November 22) at Perth. Both teams announced debuts in their ranks with Nitish Kumar Reddy and Harshit Rana getting the nod for India and Nathan McSweeney for hosts Australia.India enter the first Test of the five-match series with four seamers and a spinner in the form of Washington Sundar. R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja have both been benched after mediocre returns during the home series against New Zealand. Sundar, an off-spinner, did an exceptional job there as he took 16 wickets in two Tests, including a 10-wicket haul in Pune.As expected, KL Rahul will open the innings for India alongside Yashasvi Jaiswal after Rohit Sharma decided to stay home following the birth of his son. Devdutt Padikkal, who was introduced into the squad as a result of Rohit's absence, will make an appearance at No. 3 with Shubman Gill injured with a fractured thumb. Karanataka's Padikkal impressed many with 88 runs against Australia A in Mackay.Over in the hosts' camp, McSweeney was expected to make his Test debut and was handed the Baggy Green by former cricketer and coach Darren Lehmann.""We are going to bat first, looks like a good wicket. Very confident with our preparation. We played a Test match here in 2018 so we know what to expect. The wicket gets quicker. Nitish makes his debut. We have 4 quicks and Washi (Sundar) is the lone spinner,"" said stand-in skipper Jasprit Bumrah at the toss.Australia captain Pat Cummins said, ""We were 50-50, either way we are pretty happy.

Don't look at captaincy as a post but responsibility: Jasprit Bumrah

Nasty, abusive, fiery. The adjectives you presume are usually not pleasant when you type the words 'fast' and 'bowler' next to each other. Some even label them as 'dumb', or people with short fuses. When it comes to the captaincy, the tribe is always ignored, and a batter is usually favoured to do the job as they are perceived to be calmer, more intelligent.A more logical explanation about why fast bowlers are usually not made captains is, they already have so much on their plate physically. Adding the responsibility of field placements, rotation of bowlers, choice of roller, addressing the media before or after a win or loss etc, becomes a needless distraction. Jasprit Bumrah and Pat Cummins , Test captains of India and Australia respectively, have bucked that trend. They do not abuse or sledge batters while bowling. They also give the impression of being deeply cerebral and they look forward to challenges of leadership.""I love responsibility, I wanted to do the tough job since I was a child,"" Bumrah, who also led India in a Test at Edgbaston against England when skipper Rohit Sharma tested positive for Covid-19, said while addressing the media. ""You always want to be in the thick of things, you want to be thrown against tough scenarios, and this is another one that adds a new challenge to me.""Cummins took over from Tim Paine following a sexting scandal in the 2021-2022 Ashes series and is more experienced, having led Australia in 28 Tests.Reminded that it is only the third instance of two premier fast bowlers captaining their respective countries after Wasim Akram (Pakistan) and Courtney Walsh (West Indies) did it in 1997 and Cummins and Tim Southee (NZ) did it last summer, Cummins said, ""I don't think it really changes too much again, but it's one of those rare things. Looking forward to seeing, hopefully from the changeroom, how he (Bumrah) goes about his work out there. But as a fan of fast bowling, it's always good to see,"" he added and revealed that it took him about 10 Tests to find his footing in the dual role as pacer and captain.Bumrah reciprocated Cummins' sentiment. ""I obviously have been a fan of bowlers and fast bowling, which is why I chose to be a bowler,"" Bumrah said. ""I feel that physically it's a lot more draining to bowl, but tactically bowlers are quite smart as well. There're many examples in the past, in Australia and India. We had Kapil Dev . Pat has done a phenomenal job, and he's got a lot of success for Australia. Hopefully, it's the start of a new tradition and many more players will follow that,"" he stated.Bumrah carried the torch more forthrightly for his tribe and said bowlers as captains can be successful because they are more precise with their planning. ""Bowlers do a lot more research and are more data driven than batters.""When quizzed about his lack of experience in the job though, Bumrah fired back, ""Nobody is born with experience. If that self-belief is there, that's what matters.""Having played under successful skippers like MS Dhoni (whiteball cricket), Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, Bumrah feels there is no need to have a set template or follow his predecessors.""You must find your own way and you can't blindly copy anyone. Virat and Rohit have been successful and have got results, but my way is not to follow a copybook plan. Even when I'm bowling, I go with my instincts and that's how I have always played my cricket,"" Bumrah stressed.Allaying fears about overbowling himself as he is leading an inexperienced attack, Bumrah stated, ""I look at it differently. I can manage myself the best when I am captain. I know when I am fresh and I know when I need to push myself, and I know when I must take extra responsibility.""Cummins, who has a more senior leadership group around him, felt, ""The question is always just are you bowling too much or not enough? It's gut feel. Speak to some other people out there and come up with a decision.""",Jasprit Bumrah and Pat Cummins are Test captains of India and Australia respectively.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli 's latest post has created a stir on social media, with users and fans speculating over its meaning and intent.The message left many pondering about the nature of his post, leading to a flurry of reactions and debates online. With over seven thousand reposts, it quickly became a hot topic of discussion.However, Kohli 's post directed towards his decade-long partnership with his apparel brand, reflecting on the challenges he overcame to make it a success. The star India batter expressed his excitement about continuing to grow his brand for another ten years.""Looking back, we've always been a bit different. We never fitted into any box they tried putting us in. Two misfits, who just clicked. We've changed over the years, but always done things our way. Some called us crazy; others didn't get it,"" Kohli wrote.""But honestly? We didn't care. We were busy figuring out who we are. Ten years of ups and downs, and even the pandemic couldn't shake us. If anything, it reminded us-being different is our strength. So here's to ten years of doing it our way-the Wrogn way. Here's to being Wrogn. And here's to the next ten! Wrogn, for the right kind of man,"" he added.Kohli, who has been struggling with form, will be back in action for the first Test against Australia starting Friday in Perth.With an average of just 22.72 in his six Test matches this year, his performance has been well below his career average of 47.83 and his impressive 54.08 average in Tests played in Australia.However, having scored some of his landmark centuries in Australia and leading India to a historic 2-1 series win here in 2018/19, Kohli is expected to rise to the occasion and deliver his best.","Virat Kohli's latest post has created a stir on social media, with users and fans speculating over its meaning and intent. The message left many pondering about the nature of his post, leading to a flurry of reactions and debates online. With over seven thousand reposts, it quickly became a hot topic of discussion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115533011,imgsize-85718,width-400,resizemode-4/115533011.jpg"

PCB Aur Broadcaster Nay ICC Aur BCCI Ko Preshan Kar Diya | Basit Ali

As the impasse over the Champions Trophy hosting and scheduling continues, former Pakistan batsman Basit Ali has claimed that the tournament's official broadcaster has said 'no' to the hybrid model or to have India and Pakistan in different pools.After the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) refused to send the Indian team to Pakistan -- the designated hosts of the tournament, the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) has taken a tough stance with strong objection to a hybrid model, which will allow India to play their matches at a neutral venue, while the rest of tournament is hosted in Pakistan.In fact, the PCB chairman, Mohsin Naqvi, has gone on record to say that the hybrid model is not acceptable to Pakistan.With huge amounts of financial gains from an International Cricket Council ( ICC ) tournament dependent on the India vs Pakistan game and both the nations sticking to their decisions, the announcement of the schedule is understandably on hold as a tournament without either of the teams will take the sheen off it.""What did I tell you about the Champions Trophy...Broadcaster isn't agreeing to (hybrid model or India and Pakistan in different pools) and it won't,"" said Basit in a video on his YouTube channel. ""If there is no India-Pakistan match in a tournament, then it would be like a tasteless dish.""The former middle-order batsman added that Pakistan has made the right moves, which has put the ICC in a fix, where they have to not only satisfy both the BCCI and the PCB, but also the broadcaster, who won't be ready to bear any financial losses in the event of no India-Pakistan match.""PCB has played its cards very well, well done!...If you want to go ahead with the hybrid model, do it. But India and Pakistan won't be in the same pool, and Pakistan will play all their matches at home,"" said Basit.""Mohsin Naqvi is quietly sitting now. He has played his cards correctly.""Basit added ""ICC pareshan hai (is worried)"" while the world is watching the four-way game being played in the apex body's corridors.""BCCI sends a message to the ICC, and it is relayed to the PCB. Then the PCB sends a message to the ICC, and it is forwarded to the BCCI. Then the broadcaster jumped in and asked 'what's happening, this is not agreeable to us'.""Both broadcaster and the ICC are having sleepless nights.""The Champions Trophy, which is scheduled for February 19 to March 9 next year in Pakistan, is making a return to the ICC calendar after seven years.",Former Pakistan batsman Basit Ali claims that the tournament's official broadcaster has said 'no' to the hybrid model or to have India and Pakistan in different pools.

Don't look at captaincy as a post but responsibility: Jasprit Bumrah

Since 2014, serial global trophy winners Australia have laid their hands on two 50-over World Cups (2015, 2023), four Ashes (2017-2018, 2019, 2021-2022, 2023), one T20 World Cup (2021) and the mace that declared them the latest World Test Champions (2023).One piece of silverware, though, has proved curiously elusive — the Border Gavaskar Trophy. It’s the prize for winning the Test series between India and Australia, named after two legendary cricketers, Allan Border and Sunil Gavaskar, who were the second and first to cross the 10,000-run mark in Tests, respectively.Contested since 1996, Australia last touched it in 2014-2015, when they beat India 2-0 Down Under in the four-match series. The following four installments, all tightly contested, have been pocketed by India 2-1.Thanks to Rishabh Pant’s maverick genius at the Gabba in Jan 2021, TV stations and fans asked for more and what have you: A first five-Test series of the BGT. VVS Laxman’s heroics in Kolkata and the thrilling Test series of 2000-01 resulted in a three-Test series growing into a four-Test affair and it seems Pant’s pyrotechnics have had the same effect.Former Australia skipper Ricky Ponting, not known for hyperbole, equated the IndiaAustralia rivalry to the Ashes. Ditto for former Ashes-winning captain Michael Vaughan. It’s up to the visitors now though to justify this massive hype.With the bitter taste of a 0-3 home humbling against New Zealand still lingering, India, led by Jasprit Bumrah , will be up against it when they square off against Pat Cummins ’ Australia at the Optus Stadium in Perth on what is likely to be a fast and bouncy pitch for the first Test.The build up to the series has been far from ideal for the visitors. Regular skipper Rohit Sharma will be missing because he is on paternity leave. Mohammed Shami, probably India’s finest exponent of seam and swing, is injured. Their promising No. 3 bat Shubman Gill, who has the game to succeed on the pacy wickets of Australia and is extremely safe in the slips, is nursing a thumb injury. Virat Kohli, their batting heartbeat, is out of form.While India had contingency plans in place for Rohit’s absence, Gill’s injury is a setback as it has forced mass changes to the top six.KL Rahul, short of confidence and pathologically inconsistent, will be forced to open, as the team management isn’t confident about Abhimanyu Easwaran after the Bengal batter didn’t make the four innings he got to impress against Australia A in the two games. Patience as a commodity is in short supply when teams are losing.Karnataka left-hander Devdutt Padikkal, who was on the way back home after his exertions for India A, was asked to unpack and report to Perth and will probably take Gill’s place at the No. 3 spot. Wicketkeeperbatter Dhruv Jurel, who batted well for India A, scoring twin 50s at the MCG, is expected to bat at No. 6, a spot that would normally have gone to Sarfaraz Khan.There is talk of the visitors opting for the medium pace bowling allrounder Nitish Kumar Reddy to hold one end up and give a breather to pacers Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep.What that will also ensure is that the tail isn’t made up of four No. 11s. India are expected to go in with a 4-1 combination with offie R Ashwin likely to do the spin-bowling duties, keeping in mind the Aussie top seven, which features three left-handers. The hype in Australia has been unprecedented ever since it was announced in April 2022 that the BGT will be a five-Test series. Captain Cummins (269 wickets) spent most of his time answering questions on the India series even while playing the first two ODIs vs Pakistan.He forms one fourth of arguably the greatest bowling quartet Australia have ever produced with Mitchell Starc (358), Josh Hazlewood (273) and offspinner Nathan Lyon (530).All of them are adequately rested and have prepared well by playing the odd Sheffield Shield game to shake off red-ball rust.There are a few worries surrounding the dipping batting averages of Steve Smith, Marnus Labuschagne and Travis Head in the current WTC. But history suggests the sight of India has always sparked an uptick in their form and fortunes.Australia hold all the aces. Can cornered India do an encore of 2021?","The Border Gavaskar Trophy is the prize for winning the Test series between India and Australia.

Former Indian cricket team fielding coach, R Sridhar , believes that Jasprit Bumrah needs a bowling partner who provides control. Sridhar emphasised the importance of having a bowler who can maintain a tight economy rate, especially during crucial phases of the game.""I would be looking at a bowler who will give you control because there are going to be pockets in the game where you need to block and bowl at less that 2.5 runs an over."" said Sridhar, speaking on the TimesofIndia's daily evening show Beyond the Boundary programmeHe drew a parallel with the 2018-19 Border Gavaskar Trophy , highlighting Ishant Sharma 's significant contribution.Sridhar lauded Sharma's ability to bowl economically and control the flow of runs, which allowed Bumrah to attack from the other end.""If you see the first Border Gavaskar Trophy that we won in 2018-19, Ishant Sharma gave us tremendous control with the cherry. He came in and just ran in blocked one end. I wish he was there as a mentor on the tour, he should be part of the change room as a mentor and not just sitting as a mentor.""He emphasised the need for a bowler who can replicate Sharma's performance and provide stability to the bowling attack.""You need someone to do what Ishant Sharma did in 2018-19 tour when India won the trophy. Who has the skill set to block one end so that when Bumrah bowls fearlessly with aggressive field?""Sridhar firmly believes that Bumrah's role should be to take wickets, and he shouldn't be burdened with the responsibility of containing runs.“Bumrah should not be brought down to a position where he is going to come and bowl to keep the game tight, if Bumrah is doing that then Australia is winning the game. You need Bumrah to go for wickets for that whether Siraj plays or Akash plays, you need someone to be bowling you those four overs spells for ten runs.”","Former Indian cricket team fielding coach, R Sridhar, believes that Jasprit Bumrah needs a bowling partner who provides control.

India to wait on Shubman Gill until the morning of Perth Test: Morne Morkel

NEW DELHI: Devdutt Padikkal , the young Indian batter, might get a chance to play in the first Test match against Australia. Mayank Agarwal , his senior teammate from Karnataka, believes that if given the opportunity, Padikkal needs to be ready for the challenges ahead.Padikkal wasn't initially included in India's main 18-player squad for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy . However, after Shubman Gill injured his left hand, Padikkal was asked to stay back following the A team's unofficial Test matches in Australia.Also See: Live Cricket Score If Gill is unable to play, Padikkal might play in his second Test match, having debuted against England in March.Agarwal, who found himself in a similar situation during the 2018-19 tour when he was called up for the second Test in Melbourne, spoke about the Indian players' preparation.""They (Indian players) have had time to prepare. The good thing was (that) a lot of the guys went and played India A games,"" Agarawal, who was in a similar situation on the 2018-19 tour when he was called up for the second Test at Melbourne, told PTI on Thursday.He emphasized the importance of mindset, saying, ""They have had at least three weeks to prepare themselves for the conditions. But it then now boils down to the mindset - are you willing to get into the fight?""He believes Padikkal has the right attitude and skills to succeed.""Or are you willing to embrace that fight? If he can get into that mindset - which he has; he has got a lot of skill, a lot of flair (and he) works hard on his game.""The possibility of Padikkal playing in the first Test seemed even stronger when the BCCI's official social media accounts shared a video of him rejoining the national team.""It feels really surreal to be honest. The intensity of the practice sessions were quite high. You feel that challenge; you will feel that everyone is ready, raring to go for the big series ahead,"" Padikkal said.He acknowledged the high standards of training with the Indian team.""So, it is always pleasure to have training sessions with the Indian team because it feels as big as the match. Hopefully, it will translate to the game as well.""Padikkal, who scored a solid 88 runs in the first unofficial Test at Mackay, expressed his eagerness for the opportunity.""I am glad that I am getting this opportunity, and hopefully I can make it count.""Agarwal is confident that the Indian batsmen can overcome their recent struggles in Australia.""They have prepared in the best way they can or they should, according to them, which we must trust. They are going to face challenges, definitely. It's a place where cricket is played really hard,"" said Agarwal, part of India's 2-1 win on the 2018-19 tour.He stressed the need for a strong and determined mindset.""You want to put yourself out there with a mindset of saying, 'I want to be in that tough situation, or, I want to be in a situation where the chips are down and I can find a way and win the situation and win the game for the team',"" he said.Agarwal also expressed his support for his longtime teammate KL Rahul, who is expected to open the batting in Rohit Sharma 's absence in the first Test.He praised Rahul's adaptability in the batting order.""The real question here is that whenever you are going to play for India, when you are going to represent your national team, there is going to be pressure. The situations have been (different), where he has been asked to open and he has been asked to play different roles,"" he said.Agarwal believes that Rahul's experience and temperament will help him succeed.""I give him credit that he is somebody who is adapted to playing everywhere. We have seen that he has done really well overseas. He is very calm and he is very collected. He just needs to go about doing his routines, going about playing the way he plays and just stay calm,"" he said.","Devdutt Padikkal could get a chance to play in the first Test match against Australia.

R Sridhar , the former fielding coach of the Indian cricket team , believes that India's pursuit of a series victory in Australia will be challenging but not insurmountable. He expressed optimism about the team's ability to overcome obstacles, citing their history of resilience.""It’s not going to be easy for India, but the hope is for a hat-trick. That said, it’s not as if we haven’t crossed hurdles and overcome challenges before. So hopefully, we’re looking for an encore.""Sridhar, speaking on the TimesofIndia's daily evening show Beyond the Boundary programme, highlighted Virat Kohli ’s meticulous approach to preparing for major Test series in countries like Australia, England, and South Africa. He emphasised Kohli’s commitment to arriving well in advance of the first Test, typically 10 to 12 days prior, to dedicate ample time to practice.""Generally, when Virat Kohli goes for a big series inSENA countries , he likes to go all in with his preparation before the first Test. He’ll arrive 10–12 days early and get a lot of sessions under his belt. Each session consists of 200–250 balls, with plenty of time in the middle, including match simulations and practice matches. He usually takes on the most difficult pitches available, asking bowlers to bowl on them. He’s willing to look ugly in practice so that as the tour progresses, it becomes easier.""Sridhar elaborated on Kohli’s rigorous training regimen, noting the substantial volume of balls he faces during practice sessions, which often simulate match scenarios. Kohli’s preference, according to Sridhar, is to practise on the most challenging pitches available, pushing himself to refine his technique and adapt to demanding conditions.According to Sridhar, Kohli is entering a new phase in his career but remains in peak physical condition. His fitness levels are well-suited to the demands of an intensive 10-day training camp.""Virat is entering a different phase of his career, but make no mistake—his fitness is at its prime. He is well-tuned to endure the rigours of a solid 10-day training camp. He’ll work on his technique, focusing on knowing where his back foot is and ensuring his initial movements are precise. He likes to stay square with the back foot, keep his hips aligned, and target those fourth and fifth-stump deliveries. As we all know, anything on the stumps, he accesses the leg side fabulously. So it’s those fifth-stump deliveries that will challenge him."" he added.""He’ll be practising very hard to get into a position where he knows exactly where his off-stump is because bowlers like Starc and co. won’t give him anything on his body. They’ll aim to make him feel for the ball outside the fifth or sixth stump early in his innings. I’m sure he’ll be working hard to counter that. By the time he lands in Australia, he will likely have already faced 1,000–1,500 balls in practice."" he concluded.","Former fielding coach of the Indian cricket team believes that India's pursuit of a series victory in Australia will be challenging but not insurmountable.

How the Australian squad members fared during the Sheffield Shield ahead of Border Gavaskar Trophy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/how-the-australian-squad-members-fared-during-the-sheffield-shield-ahead-of-border-gavaskar-trophy/articleshow/115532336.cms,"Marnus Labuschagne and Travis Head (X Photo)

The much-awaited Border-Gavaskar Trophy is scheduled to begin on November 22 in Perth. India is gearing up to face Australia in what is expected to be an exciting start to the series. As the Border Gavaskar Trophy approaches, let's review the performances of Australian players in the recent Sheffield Shield matches.Travis Head 's recent performance in the Sheffield Shield seems to suggest he will continue to bat in the middle order for Australia, a position he has always held in red-ball cricket for South Australia. However, the explosive left-hander didn't have a great outing upon his return to first-class cricket, scoring 30 and 10 runs in the two innings. Interestingly, spin bowling proved to be his downfall on both occasions. He was dismissed by Tanveer Sangha in the first innings and then fell victim to a brilliant delivery by Nathan Lyon in the second innings.In the same match, Marnus Labuschagne continued his impressive run in red-ball cricket, scoring 77 and 35 not out against Western Australia. The right-hander was on course for a century in the first innings but was dismissed leg before wicket while attempting a sweep shot off the bowling of off-spinner Corey Rocchiccioli. Labuschagne's recent scores in first-class cricket are a testament to his form: 35-, 77, 19, 119, 93 & 64.Besides his batting exploits, Labuschagne also showcased his all-round abilities, captaining the side and picking up two wickets with his medium-pace bowling. His bowling figures in the match were 6.2-3-5-2. Mitchell Marsh had a forgettable start to the new season, having to walk in to bat after just three balls as Western Australia slumped to 0/2 after 0.2 overs. He was unable to rescue his team on the first day, departing for a paltry 13 runs. However, the powerful right-hander made amends in the second innings, scoring a well-crafted 94.Interestingly, Marsh did not bowl in either innings of the match. With Cameron Green sidelined due to injury, Marsh will likely have to shoulder a significant bowling workload against India. His bowling fitness will be crucial for Australia's chances in the series. Usman Khawaja 's performance resembled Labuschagne's, except that he capitalized in the second innings after a missed opportunity in the first. This match against Western Australia was Khawaja's first as an opener for Queensland since February 2022.Nathan Lyon lived up to his reputation as a world-class spinner, claiming eight wickets in the match against South Australia in Sydney. This was Lyon's first professional game since July. He dismissed the dangerous Alex Carey in the first innings and then bowled Travis Head with a brilliant delivery in the second. Lyon bowled a total of 63 overs in the match, highlighting his impressive workload capacity.",The Border-Gavaskar Trophy is scheduled to begin on November 22 in Perth.

NEW DELHI: Argentina superstar Lautaro Martinez etched his name in Argentine football history by scoring the solitary goal against Peru, equaling the legendary Diego Maradona 's tally of 32 goals for the national team.The 27-year-old striker is now just one goal shy of surpassing Maradona and securing the fifth spot in Argentina's all-time top scorers list, led by Lionel Messi with an impressive 112 goals.Martinez's second-half volley proved decisive as Argentina solidified their position at the top of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers with a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Peru on Wednesday.The striker acknowledged the team's exceptional year, emphasizing the need for continuous improvement and recognizing the challenges that come with being a prominent national side.""It was a spectacular year in terms of performance, goals, games played. We have to keep playing and improving day by day. Everyone wants to beat us. The Argentine national team is always the protagonist. There are things to improve but we have to continue on this path,"" said Lautaro.With his 11th international goal of the year, Martinez became only the third Argentine player to score more than 10 goals in a calendar year, joining the elite company of Gabriel Batistuta and Lionel Messi.Argentina's win extended their unbeaten streak against Peru in the South American Qualifiers to 18 games, the longest such run against a single opponent in the tournament's history.Additionally, the Albiceleste have kept clean sheets in 10 of their last 11 home qualifiers, highlighting their defensive solidity.Assistant coach Walter Samuel praised the team's hunger for success and their ability to bounce back from setbacks.""The boys are very hungry to continue winning and competing. Sometimes it goes like it did today, and sometimes it goes like it did against Bolivia (6-0 win).

Uttar Pradesh rode a brace from Mohammad Tauseef to defeat Jharkhand 2-1 in the day’s earlier match.Bengal came into the game with a scintillating form, blowing away Jharkhand (4-0) and UP (7-0) in their previous two matches and looked well-placed to top the group — a prerequisite for progressing to the next round. However, Sen was also aware of the challenge on hand given that Bihar could advance with a win by upstaging the hosts on a head-to-head count.Bengal started on the offensive but couldn’t breach Bihar’s well-planned defensive set-up. The hosts, however, came close to breaking the deadlock towards the end of the first half.As winger Amarnath Baskey entered the box from the left side, Bihar defender Arif Khan stopped him in his tracks with an illegal push, forcing Shyamson Singh Chongtham to point to the spot-kick.However, Robi Hansda — who scored six goals in the previous two games — saw his penalty-kick saved by Bihar goalkeeper Sunny Raj as the ball ricocheted off the crosspiece in the 40th minute.Bengal continued to dominate after the break and Manotos Maji, who came on as a second-half substitute, could have snatched the win at the death but he failed to find the target from close following a low cross from Baskey.Nine group winners will now join reigning champions Services, last year’s runners-up Goa and hosts Telangana in the final round where they will be further divided into two groups of six teams each. Four teams from each group will progress to the quarterfinals.","Bengal finish Group C with 7 points, three points ahead of Bihar while Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand return with a win each.
