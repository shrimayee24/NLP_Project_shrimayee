Wayne Gretzky’s son Ty Gretzky followed a different path while honoring his father’s legendary hockey legacy

While Wayne Gretzky is known around the world as the “Great One” of hockey, his eldest son Ty Gretzky has built a name for himself outside the NHL spotlight — all while preserving the legacy of his father through coaching, entrepreneurship, and family pride.Born on July 9, 1990, Ty Gretzky is the second child of Wayne and Janet Gretzky and the first of their sons. Although Ty didn’t pursue a professional hockey career like his iconic father, the sport still plays a significant role in his life. In fact, Ty co-founded The Gretzky Hockey School in 2014 with Wayne, a venture that gives young athletes across North America a chance to learn hockey fundamentals from the family that helped shape the sport.“He was my hockey guy. He loves hockey,” Wayne said about Ty during a 2021 episode of The Steam Room podcast. “We do hockey camps all over North America. He is one of my best friends and I love it.”Interestingly, Ty wasn’t named after a hockey legend — but rather a baseball icon. “I named Ty after Ty Cobb because I love baseball,” Wayne shared. It’s a nod to the family's appreciation for multiple sports, even as hockey remains central to their identity.Outside of hockey, Ty is a devoted husband and father. He married Sara Marie Cusick on February 29, 2020, in a glamorous Gatsby-style wedding in Brooklyn, New York. Together, they’ve welcomed two daughters, Sicily in 2021 and Vienna in 2023, adding another generation to the Gretzky legacy.Ty has also paid homage to his father through creative ventures like Gretzky’s Basement, a Toronto pop-up replicating Wayne’s famous memorabilia room filled with artifacts from his historic career. It’s an immersive tribute to both Wayne’s impact on hockey and the family's role in keeping that legacy alive.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky's son Ty Gretzky shows favouritism, backs Rick Tocchet's return as Flyers head coach with enthusiastic message Although Ty Gretzky may not have skated on NHL ice, he has built a legacy rooted in family, tradition, and the values passed down by one of hockey’s greatest — a quiet leader off the rink who continues to inspire the next generation.","Ty Gretzky was born on July 9, 1990.

Why was Brad Marchand suspended mid-game but no penalty given for Andrei Svechnikov’s hit on Sergei Bobrovsky?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/why-was-brad-marchand-suspended-mid-game-but-no-penalty-given-for-andrei-svechnikovs-hit-on-sergei-bobrovsky/articleshow/121316170.cms,"Brad Marchand faced mid-game ejection following a heated confrontation with Shayne Gostisbehere (Image via AP)

Panthers surge early, but Brad Marchand steals spotlight with fiery outburst

Paul Maurice’s cryptic reaction and Bobrovsky’s uncalled hit controversy

Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Final between the Florida Panthers and Carolina Hurricanes wasn’t short on fireworks—and we’re not just talking goals. While Florida dominated the scoreboard with a convincing 5-2 win, the real headline-stealer was Brad Marchand ’s mid-game ejection following a heated confrontation with Shayne Gostisbehere.Sergei Bobrovsky stood tall in goal, stopping 31 shots, while Carter Verhaeghe led the charge with a goal and an assist. The Panthers’ offensive depth was on full display as Rodrigues, Nosek, Bennett, and Luostarinen all contributed. However, despite the commanding performance, it was Marchand’s boiling point that became the talk of the night.Midway through the third period, with the Panthers cruising 4-1, tensions escalated fast. It started when Shayne Gostisbehere fired a puck directly at Marchand after dodging a heavy hit attempt earlier in the play. Marchand responded with fury—dropping his gloves and engaging in a full-blown scrap.According to Sportsnet, “Marchand was IRATE after he was given four minutes for roughing and a game misconduct for his tussle with Gostisbehere.” Gostisbehere, meanwhile, received only a minor, giving the Hurricanes a two-minute power play advantage.When asked about the confrontation post-game, head coach Paul Maurice was blunt yet evasive: “Yeah, I’ve got one. I’ll be keeping that to myself.” That response only added fuel to the debate, especially since another incident involving Andrei Svechnikov went uncalled. Svechnikov appeared to make contact with Bobrovsky’s head near the crease earlier in the game, but referees let it slide—prompting outrage online.One fan noted, “This looks like an intentional knee to Bobrovsky’s head by Svechnikov... should definitely be looked at.”Also Read: “Don’t think it’s justified”: Brad Marchand slams Leafs fans, says Toronto backlash is ‘crucifixion’ not criticism Despite the chaos, the Panthers now lead the series and have momentum on their side.

Why the Los Angeles Lakers Would Do It

Why the Warriors Would Consider It

Theandare under pressure to make big moves this offseason. After disappointing playoff exits, both teams face tough decisions—and a surprising trade involvingcould be on the table.According to Colin Keane of Sporting News , the Warriors, led by Stephen Curry , Draymond Green, and Jimmy Butler, fell short in the Conference Semifinals against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Their lack of depth and youth was exposed, signaling a need for fresh talent.The Lakers, built around LeBron James and Luka Doncic, also struggled defensively and were eliminated in the first round by the same Timberwolves squad. Their roster imbalance has forced front-office discussions about aggressive retooling.Here’s the potential deal that could shake up both franchises: Draymond Green (4-time All-Star, defensive anchor)- Dalton Knecht (young sharpshooting wing)- Rui Hachimura (expiring contract)- 2031 first-round draft pick LeBron James , now 40, is still elite, but the Los Angeles Lakers must maximize their championship window.Draymond Green’s defensive versatility and playmaking would immediately elevate their roster.- Defensive Upgrade: Green’s ability to guard multiple positions fixes a major Lakers weakness.- Leadership: His vocal presence and playoff experience would bolster the locker room.- Win-Now Move: Knecht’s potential doesn’t align with the Lakers’ urgency to contend.As writer Colin Keane noted: ""Green would be heartbroken to trade in his Warriors uniform and go somewhere else, but his positive relationship with LeBron has been well-documented.""According to Colin, trading Draymond Green would be emotional, but the Golden State Warriors must plan for life after Curry.- Future Assets: Knecht and the 2031 pick offer long-term upside.- Financial Flexibility: Hachimura’s expiring deal clears future cap space.- Youth Movement: Green’s departure accelerates a rebuild around younger talent.While this specific trade might not be enough, the Warriors should keep an open mind if better offers emerge.Both teams are at a crossroads. The Los Angeles Lakers get a proven winner in Draymond Green, while the Golden State Warriors secure assets for the future. Whether this deal happens or not, one thing is clear: major changes are coming for these franchises.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors could eye $70 million Boston Celtics point guard to boster squad after unfortunate playoff exit This trade scenario remains speculative, but it highlights the tough choices ahead for both teams.

Al-Nassr dominate as Cristiano Ronaldo scores late

Eyes on history as Cristiano Ronaldo nears 1,000-goal mark

On 21 May 2025, Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 935th career goal in Al-Nassr 's 2–0 win over Al-Khaleej in the Saudi Pro League to further extend his legendary status, a stoppage-time penalty from the icon helped Al-Nassr to the three points, bringing the Portuguese star even closer to his career milestone of 1,000 career strikes while simultaneously reinforcing his status as the greatest goalscorer in football history.For all their attacking threat, Al-Nassr were pushed hard by a stubborn Al-Khaleej outfit but were in control for much of the match. The first half ended without any goals, but it was Colombian forward Jhon Durán who broke the deadlock in the 75th minute, calmly finishing inside the area to give the home side a well-deserved lead.The visitors did everything they could to earn an equalizer, which allowed for space on the counter for Al-Nassr. Then, in the dying seconds of the game, Cristiano Ronaldo was badly tackled inside the box, winning a penalty. Stepping up, the 40-year-old slotted home obliquely in the 97th minute, securing his 935th career goal and sealing the outcome.Ronaldo's 98th goal in 110 appearances in the Saudi Pro League keeps him among the top scorers in the league. His role remains crucial for Al-Nassr as they push for a strong end to their domestic season.Cristiano Ronaldo's goal record rises to 935, and he is now just 65 goals from the elusive 1,000-goal club — a milestone no player in the modern era has ever achieved. With the sun setting on his career, Ronaldo nevertheless continues to be pivotal to the Al-Nassr frontline.The Saudi club's contract reportedly runs to the end of June 2025, with the possibility of a one-year extension or a final transfer — but nothing has yet been made official.

Two-time All-Star Jean Segura retires



After over a decade of consistency in MLB Jean Segura has officially announced his retirement, drawing the curtain on a memorable 12-year career that took him across six franchises and left a lasting impression on fans and teammates alike.The announcement was made through CAA Sports, Segura’s agency, via Instagram on Wednesday. The post honored the 35-year-old infielder’s accomplishments, stating, “Congratulations to Jean Segura on an incredible MLB career.” With that, the baseball world took a moment to reflect on one of the game’s most quietly impactful players.Segura’s journey began with the Los Angeles Angels, but he soon found his rhythm during stints with the Milwaukee Brewers and Arizona Diamondbacks. It was in 2016, while donning a Diamondbacks uniform, that Segura reached peak form—leading the National League with 203 hits and notching a career-best 6.6 WAR. His consistency at the plate and relentless energy on the field made him a fan favorite and a nightmare for opposing pitchers.One of his most memorable chapters came during his two-season run with the Seattle Mariners from 2017 to 2018. Acquired in a blockbuster trade that also brought Mitch Haniger to Seattle, Segura quickly lived up to his nickname in the Pacific Northwest—“Jean, Jean, the hitting machine.”He posted a .302 batting average, with 7.1 bWAR, and made the 2018 American League All-Star team. His three-run homer off Josh Hader in the All-Star Game that year remains one of the highlights of his Mariners tenure.Despite his individual brilliance, team success often eluded Segura. He reached the postseason only once, during the Philadelphia Phillies ’ 2022 World Series run. Though the Phillies ultimately fell short against the Houston Astros, that playoff appearance was a long-overdue reward for a player who had consistently delivered throughout his career.His final stint in the majors came in 2023 with the Miami Marlins, closing out a career stat line that includes a .281 batting average, 1,545 hits, 110 home runs, 513 RBIs, 211 stolen bases, and an OPS of .729.For fans who followed him from Milwaukee to Miami, Jean Segura’s career was never about flash. It was about reliability, heart, and a tireless work ethic. As he steps away from the game, the legacy he leaves behind is one of grit, grace, and a bat that never stopped swinging.Also Read: Why Juan Soto’s effort against the Red Sox is raising eyebrows among fans, teammates and pundits alike","Two-time All-Star Jean Segura retires after 12-year MLB career.

Jim Irsay’s Legacy: Remembering the visionary behind the Indianapolis Colts’ golden era



Jim Irsay’s cause of death



The NFL has lost one of its most passionate, charismatic, and influential figures. Jim Irsay , the longtime owner and CEO of the Indianapolis Colts , passed away peacefully in his sleep at the age of 65. The news was confirmed by the Colts, marking the end of a remarkable chapter in both the team’s history and the broader football world.“We are devastated to announce our beloved Owner & CEO, Jim Irsay, passed away peacefully in his sleep,” said Colts COO Pete Ward. “Jim’s dedication and passion for the Indianapolis Colts, in addition to his generosity, commitment to the community, and most importantly, his love for his family were unsurpassed.”Irsay’s impact on the Colts cannot be overstated. Taking full control of the franchise in 1997 after the passing of his father, Robert Irsay, he led the team into its most successful era. Under his leadership, the Colts drafted quarterback Peyton Manning in 1998, a decision that transformed the franchise into a perennial contender. Over the next decade, the Colts captured eight division titles and culminated their dominance with a Super Bowl XLI victory in 2006 against the Chicago Bears.But Irsay’s journey with the Colts began long before he assumed ownership. Raised in a football household, he joined the organization as a teenager, taking on roles that spanned from equipment manager to front-office executive.In 1984, at just 24 years old, he became the youngest general manager in NFL history—the same year the Colts relocated from Baltimore to Indianapolis. When his father suffered a stroke in 1995, Jim stepped up to oversee day-to-day operations, cementing his leadership role.Away from the field, Irsay was as distinctive as they come. He embraced life with a deep passion for music, curating an impressive collection of music memorabilia that he often showcased during public exhibitions and jam sessions with his band. His philanthropy was equally powerful, with generous contributions aimed at mental health, addiction recovery, and support for marginalized communities across Indiana and beyond.“Simply put, he wanted to make the world a better place and that philosophy never wavered,” Ward said. “Jim will be deeply missed by his family, the Colts organization, and fans everywhere.”Irsay leaves behind a legacy carried by his daughters—Carlie Irsay-Gordon, Casey Foyt, and Kalen Jackson—who are already actively involved in team operations. Though the franchise has yet to announce formal succession plans, the Irsay legacy appears set to continue through them.The official cause of Jim Irsay’s death was not revealed in the Indianapolis Colts’ statement, yet his declining health over the years paints a complex picture. In December 2023, police in Carmel, Indiana, found him unresponsive with agonal breathing and a weak pulse. Narcan was administered, and while he “responded slightly,” the event was labeled a suspected overdose. Still, Irsay later attributed the scare to a hematoma from a leg injury.Battling addiction for decades, Irsay once admitted to 15 rehab stints and surviving a previous overdose where he “went code blue.” His 2014 DUI arrest added to a troubled past. Yet, through it all, his love for the Colts and football remained, with the organization noting, “some of Jim’s fondest memories came from his youth working training camps in Baltimore.”Survived by his ex-wife, Meg Coyle, and ten grandchildren, Jim Irsay’s influence extended well beyond football. He shaped a generation of Colts fans and brought a spirit to the league that was uniquely his.Also Read: Taylor Swift cuts off Blake Lively over explosive legal scandal: Travis Kelce caught in the crossfire as explosive private texts and betrayal surface","Jim Irsay, the longtime owner and CEO of the Indianapolis Colts, passed away peacefully in his sleep at the age of 65.

Fans defend Kelce and call out double standards in online body shaming

Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs ' superstar tight end, found himself at the center of a heated social media debate this week—not over football, but over body hair.Photos of Kelce surfaced on Instagram via celebrity gossip account Deux Moi, capturing the three-time Super Bowl champion shirtless near his car in Miami after what appeared to be a workout. While such candid snaps of athletes are nothing new, it wasn’t his physique or fame drawing attention this time—it was the unusual pattern on his back hair.As fans zoomed in, they noticed patches of hair missing on his upper back. One Instagram user boldly speculated that it looked like “his girlfriend had tried to wax his back and failed halfway.” Another quipped, “A trigger warning would’ve been nice.”While some poked fun at the seemingly uneven patches, others were quick to slam the comments as body shaming. One user fired back, “These comments aren’t passing the vibe check,” while another added, “Some of you haven’t been with an adult man and it shows.”The backlash against the jokes was swift and passionate. Many fans noted the double standards in how male and female celebrities are treated in similar situations. “Ouch the body shaming,” one commenter lamented, while another urged, “Imagine if the photo was a woman, and the men were making comments about her body hair.”A particularly strong response came from a fan who celebrated Kelce’s natural look, writing, “I genuinely LOVE a man with body hair. It's HOT AF. And the fact he doesn't feel the need to overly groom something natural coz of society's expectations makes him even hotter.”Some users also pointed out a likely cause for the bald patches: years of wearing football pads causing friction and hair loss. “Travis is getting in shape for football season,” one fan reminded. “He’s not worried about his back hair.” Another chimed in, “Same thing happens to hockey players too!”Even Deux Moi stepped in to cool down the discourse, commenting, “I feel like you guys are being slightly dramatic.”Also Read: Did Travis Kelce just confirm he’s living with Taylor Swift?

What led to Alijah Arenas’ life-threatening accident? Father Gilbert Arenas claims reason behind the Tesla Cybertruck crash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/what-led-to-alijah-arenas-life-threatening-accident-father-gilbert-arenas-claims-reason-behind-the-cybertruck-crash/articleshow/121306231.cms,"Alijah Arenas and Gilbert Arenas.

Gilbert Arenas revealed the reason behind Alijah Arenas’ life-threatening accident

In late April, former NBA star Gilbert Arenas faced every parent’s worst nightmare. His son, Alijah Arenas , an 18-year-old basketball phenom committed to USC, was involved in a terrifying car crash while driving a Tesla Cybertruck. The vehicle struck a tree and a fire hydrant in Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley and burst into flames, leaving Alijah trapped inside. Now, Gilbert has shared new details answering the burning question of what led to the horrific crash.The crash happened around 5 a.m. on April 24. Alijah Arenas, who was behind the wheel, inhaled a large amount of smoke and had to be placed in a medically induced coma. Fortunately, he didn’t suffer any broken bones. He was released from the hospital six days later and is now recovering at home under close medical watch. But the story behind the crash has raised troubling questions about the Tesla Cybertruck’s safety.Appearing on the All The Smoke podcast, Gilbert Arenas explained what really happened. “The car malfunctioned on him. The steering wheel went limp and ran him right into a tree,” he said, rejecting speculation that his son had fallen asleep at the wheel.Arenas added that Alijah was on the phone with 911 for nearly 10 minutes while the vehicle burned around him. “He couldn’t break the window,” he said. “Physically, he said he was trying to kick the window in and couldn’t. If you’re a parent and your teen has this car, you might want to put a hammer in that joint.” The Tesla Cybertruck's shatter-resistant, bulletproof glass, marketed as a selling point, made it nearly impossible for Alijah to escape.According to a family statement shared by TMZ, the rescue effort came down to sheer determination and luck. One good Samaritan recounted hearing banging from inside the car: “I couldn’t see anything because the smoke was so thick.” Eventually, a slight crack in one of the windows allowed bystanders to pry it open and pull Alijah out. “The car was on fire. We just knew we had to get him out.”Gilbert revealed how emotional it was to see his son alive after the ordeal. “Once he got his personality back… our jokes came back and I’m like, ‘Damn boy, you almost went extra crispy on me man.’” He said he used the moment to remind Alijah of how rare second chances are. “You’re a lucky one to see this,” he told him. “Most people don’t get to see the flowers and how everyone reacts when something happens… You can’t take this sh-t for granted. ”Since the crash, Tesla has not issued a public statement about the alleged malfunction. Meanwhile, the Arenas family is focused on Alijah’s recovery.Also Read: Minnesota Timberwolves vs Oklahoma City Thunder (05/20): Box score, player stats, game summary and more Alijah’s basketball career is still on track, and with USC on the horizon.

On May 20, the NFL permitted NFL players to play flag football at the 2028 Olympics after 32 NFL owners voted with one accord. Roger Goodell , NFL Commissioner, said at the NFL’s spring meeting, “It’s an incredible honor for any athlete to represent their country in the Olympics, which is the pinnacle of global sport.I know first-hand that the inclusion of flag football in the Olympics had sparked a tremendous amount of excitement among NFL players interested in the chance to compete for their country on the world stage.We are thrilled that they will now have that chance.” Talking about this very chance, Minnesota Vikings star wide receiver Justin Jefferson went heart-to-heart in the same spring meeting, standing alongside Commissioner Roger Goodell.25-year-old Justin Jefferson shared at the NFL’s spring meeting, “I’m just at a loss for words. Just to think about the chances of playing in the Olympics and getting a gold medal is a dream. Just reverting back to being a kid and watching the track and field meets, watching basketball win the gold medal.That’s something that, as a kid, I always wanted to be a part of, but football wasn’t global. So now that we are expanding the game and we are going more global, it’s pretty cool. Just seeing all the different countries being involved.”Brooke Pryor, Reporter for NFL Nation at ESPN, reported that Justin Jefferson said in the meeting, “That’s the decision, I’ll definitely have to weigh in a little bit. It’s three years from now, it’s three whole seasons that I’m going to have to go through.Of course, getting older, body is going to be different, but that’s definitely always been a dream. It’s always been something I always wanted to do, compete for your country versus all of the other countries in the rest of the world.I definitely would look forward to it if it came down to it, but that’s definitely something to ask myself and see what’s right.”On May 21, Michael David Smith, Managing Editor, Pro Football Talk, reported that Justin Jefferson doesn't know if he'll be chosen three years from now. But he is among the many players expressing interest in being among the 10 chosen for Team USA in 2028 Olympics.",Minnesota Vikings star wide receiver Justin Jefferson says he's always wanted to compete for his country at the Olympics.

WWE superstar Zoey Stark suffers a painful knee injury during MITB qualifier

Zoey Stark’s injury overshadows Rhea Ripley’s MITB victory

WWE Superstar Zoey Stark made her comeback to the limelight in a tragic manner on the recent episode of Monday Night RAW. What was supposed to be a critical milestone in her career, Stark got severely injured in her knee in a triple-threat qualifying match for the 2025 Women's Money in the Bank (MITB) ladder match. The incident has not only sidelined her from one of WWE’s most prestigious events but may also signal a prolonged absence from in-ring competition.The accident occurred at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, South Carolina, during a MITB qualifier bout between Zoey Stark, Kairi Sane, and Rhea Ripley. At its climax, Stark tried her characteristic springboard dropkick—a sportslike move that requires agility and accuracy. In targeting Kairi Sane, Stark slipped in executing the springboard, resulting in her awkwardly landing on her right leg.The blow caused her knee to bend in a distinctly unnatural manner, quite visibly startling both supporters and commentators. The match instantly became secondary as paramedics rushed onto the field to treat the hurt athlete. After the botched maneuver, Stark fell to the floor, cradling her right knee and exhibiting obvious signs of pain and distress. The referee stopped the match for a moment and motioned for medical attention. WWE ringside physicians made their way into the ring and evaluated her condition.Despite the extent of the injury, Stark first tried to leave the ring independently. She tried to stand, only to fall again, as she could no longer bear the weight of herself. Eventually, she was assisted backstage by medical personnel, affirming the severity of the ordeal.Veteran WWE play-by-play commentator Michael Cole guessed on-air that Stark may have re-aggravated an old injury. Stark had extensive knee surgery in 2021 to repair a torn ACL, MCL, and meniscus—injuries requiring months of rehabilitation.With the visual similarity and reaction of Stark, there is an increasing fear that her current injury is a recurrence or exacerbation of the same condition of the knee. But to date, WWE has not issued a formal medical diagnosis or recovery timeline. The wrestling fraternity came in support of Stark after the injury. AEW wrestler Thunder Rosa showed her concern with a heartfelt post on social media:""Wrestling is a lovely and risky sport. We leave everything on the table every time we go to the ring, and we also put a lot on the line when we do what we are passionate about. Zoey Stark, I love you, sister, and I hope that you heal soon."" — Thunder Rosa through X (previously Twitter)Zoey Stark's RAW match was her first on television since January. She had last remained an active member of the dissolved faction Pure Fusion Collective, after Sonya Deville and Shayna Baszler left. Stark was competing mainly in non-televised WWE house shows and sporadic Main Event tapings before this return.As a result of her earlier knee damage incurred during her stint in NXT, Stark was drafted to the main roster as part of the 2023 WWE Draft—a testament to how much the WWE believed in her promising future. The MITB qualifier was set to be a career-launching experience, which made her untimely injury so much more heartbreaking.With Stark out, the match went on between the remaining participants. Rhea Ripley took advantage of the situation, overpowering Kairi Sane and finishing the match with her characteristic Riptide finisher. The pinfall win earned Ripley a spot in the upcoming ladder match for Women's Money in the Bank, which is to be held on June 7. Ripley’s victory, however, was overshadowed by the concern surrounding Stark’s health, as WWE fans and analysts alike shifted focus to the severity of the injury.The extent of Stark’s injury remains unconfirmed by WWE, leaving her return date unknown. Given her history of severe knee damage, fans and medical experts fear that she could face another lengthy recovery process. This injury not only removes her from one of WWE’s most career-defining matches but also risks stalling the momentum she had just begun to regain. For now, Zoey Stark’s fans—and the WWE Universe as a whole—await official word from WWE’s medical team.","WWE superstar Zoey Stark suffers a painful knee injury during MITB qualifier match.

Your thoughts on Neeraj’s breaching 90m barrier...



So, what changed for Neeraj thistime? Is it the Zelezny effect?

When you took over, what was the biggest challenge you faced in moulding Neeraj into a champion?

What was the rehabilitation process involved post his comeback from injury in 2019?

Two-time Olympic medallist Neeraj Chopra and renowned biomechanics expert Dr Klaus Bartonietz forged one of the most successful athlete-coach partnerships. Bartonietz joined Neeraj as a biomechanical expert in Feb 2019 and later took over as his coach after the exit of fellow German and javelin throw legend Uwe Hohn.During his time with Bartonietz, Neeraj won two Olympics and two World Championships medals and successfully defended his Asian Games crown in Hangzhou. However, the 27-year-old’s inability to breach the 90m-mark saw him forge a partnership with Czech legend Jan Zelezny early this year. Recently, Neeraj scaled the 90m peak with a throw of 90.23m at the Doha Diamond League . Bartonietz is in India, to train some young javelin throwers at the Inspire Institute of Sports’ (IIS) Hisar centre. He spoke to TOI on a wide range of issues.Neeraj has been training with an absolutely wonderful coach (Zelezny). Zelezny and I had shared notes and he told me that Neeraj has the ability to realise his dream.Even during the warm-ups, Neeraj trains like he is training for the finals. He was disappointed when he came second with his personal best 90m throw.I am quite sure he will now go for 92m, 93m or, maybe, 94m throws in future.He looks in the best shape of his life, having overcome the troubling groin injury.Neeraj and I had met Zelezny earlier and even trained together briefly in Potchefstroom (South Africa). So, we both knew his approach. Neeraj was keen to have him on board. Zelezny has a simple training philosophy. He focuses on smart training. That’s what I also did with Neeraj for the 5-6 years. I can’t see major changes to Neeraj’s approach. He was knocking on the 90m door. It was just about that day and time. With Zelezny around, it was all about finetuning some aspects of his run-up, throwing and landing.The biggest challenge was to find the right training balance which suits his style. I needed to understand whatNeeraj actually wanted. I worked on his strength, fitness and technique. It’s like a car. Not every car can go fast. Same was with Neeraj. He just can’t run fast and land the spear to whatever distance we wished. It was about bringing those changes from inside. My job was half done with him.It was a shame when Covid-19 struck. After this layoff, he was actually in the shape of his life. I can say the same looking at today’s Neeraj. That time, he went to South Africa and had only one competition where he threw 87m. He was so positive about his chances for the Tokyo Olympics. Then the Games got postponed. It was a big challenge to keep Neeraj motivated. I was a biomechanics expert but, with Neeraj, my role completely changed. I became his guide, well-wisher, his go-to-man.",Two-time Olympic medallist Neeraj Chopra and renowned biomechanics expert Dr Klaus Bartonietz forged one of the most successful athlete-coach partnerships. Chopra won two Olympics and two World Championships medals and successfully defended his Asian Games crown in Hangzhou.

India's probable Test squad for England Tour

MUMBAI: Arshdeep Singh 's fabulous performances in white-ball cricket have prompted calls for his inclusion in India's Test team as well. In IPL2025 so far, the left-arm pacer has topped the wicket-taking charts for Punjab Kings with 16 scalps in 12 matches at 21.93, playing a major role in the team making it to the IPL playoffs for the first time in 11 years.Punjab Kings bowling coach and former Australia allrounder James Hopes, for one, feels Arshdeep could be a handful in English conditions if he's picked for India's five-Test series against the hosts next month. “He's perfectly suited for English conditions. He can swing the ball both ways, he can bowl reverse swing if required. He can bowl around the wicket as a left-armer seamer and still take it away from the right-hander,” Hopes told TOI during an exclusive interaction here on Wednesday.Showering praise on the 24-year-old pacer — one of the leading white-ball bowlers right now with 99 wickets in 63 T20Is and 14 wickets in nine ODIs — Hopes said, “Arshdeep is highly skilled and very coachable. He's open to just trying subtle, new things. You find sometimes that guys with high skill, like he has, can be very happy in the spot they're in. But he's always wanting to expand and keeps asking, 'What if I hold the ball like this, is it a bit different?' And just trying to change subtle things, because he's been around a while now and people know what he's going to do.Hopes highlighted a couple of new things Arshdeep has bought onto the table in IPL2025. “The way he's swinging the ball this year is a little bit different, which has caught some players by surprise. He's still young. He's got so much cricket left. When we get to the end of his career, we'll talk about him as one of the most dominant bowlers of all time.” Hopes also said that along with Arshdeep, Punjab Kings skipper Shreyas Iyer should also be for the England tour.“Shreyas is ready to get back into the Test arena. He's worked hard on his game over the last 12 months. He uses his hands so beautifully, which can be a real asset when you're playing in England. Both Iyer and Arshdeep should be seriously considered for the India squad,” said Hopes, who played 84 ODIs and 12 T20Is from 2005-10.Crediting Iyer's captaincy for PBKS's successful run this season, Hopes said, “As a captain, everything he's touched has turned into gold. He's tactically very good and a world class short-form batter.”","Punjab Kings bowling coach James Hopes backs Arshdeep Singh to make cut for big Test tour of England.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday joked about his son Barron's height and compared it with the Florida Gators basketball team.Trump honored the 2025 NCAA basketball champion Florida Gators at the White House on Wednesday and jokingly said, “You know I have a son that’s 6’9...He always says, ‘Dad I’m not that tall compared to some of these guys’, and now I understand what he’s talking about. ”Barron Trump, the 18-year-old son of Donald Trump and Melania Trump, has found himself in the spotlight in recent months due to his father's return to the Oval Office after winning the 2024 US election.Barron Trump stands at 6 feet 9 inches, making him taller than his father, who is 6 feet 3 inches.At the White House, Trump stated that ""lesser teams would have crumbled"" during their thrilling championship match victory.""It was looking bad,"" Trump said, observing Houston's 12-point lead in a game that Florida ultimately won 65-63 in San Antonio in April. ""Did you think you were going to win?""Florida (36-4) achieved four comeback victories in six March Madness matches.

The president commended the Gators' 39-year-old coach, Todd Golden, as ""great"" and ""young"" whilst quipping, ""Boy, would I like to be his agent.""Previously, President Joe Biden hosted a combined ceremony honouring the 2024 NCAA men's and women's basketball champions, South Carolina and Connecticut.Since beginning his presidency in January, Trump has welcomed various championship teams, including Super Bowl victors Philadelphia Eagles.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

With domestic leagues across Europe drawing to a close, the Europa League final will be played on May 21. The final features two English clubs - Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur. San Mames, home to semifinalists Athletic Bilbao, is the venue for the title decider.With Spurs and United suffering greatly in the English Premier League, only triumph in the final can salvage either team's season. United and Spurs are 16th and 17th, respectively, in the league standings, and a Europa League triumph would mean automatic qualification to the Champions League next season.Ahead of the final, Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou has admitted that his future hangs in the balance regardless of whether he steers his side to the trophy or not. As for United, a worst-ever league run can only be salvaged somewhat with a win in the final. Moreover, the financial repercussions of not securing European football will be manifold, increasing the stakes at hand for both clubs.Spurs' route to the final saw them beat AZ Alkmaar, Eintracht Frankfurt and then Bodø/Glimt in the semi-final. United, on the other hand, had to go through Real Sociedad, Olympique Lyonnais and Athletic Bilbao, scoring a whopping 19 goals in just the knockout phase.A win for Spurs would see them claim silverware for the first time since the 2008 League Cup. As for Europe, trophies haven't come around since the 1984 UEFA Cup.United have enjoyed more success in that regard, and are one of the most successful teams in world football. The FA Cup in 2024 remains their most recent trophy, but 20 league titles, three Champions Leagues and several other domestic crowns find place in United's trophy cabinet.

Jason Kelce at center of controversy as NFL refuses to outlaw Eagles’ powerful play



Jason Kelce stole the spotlight at the NFL owners’ meeting not with words, but with his silence. As the league voted to keep the Eagles’ controversial “tush push” play legal, Kelce avoided the media and later addressed the growing speculation around his retirement on his podcast.At the recent NFL owners’ meeting, a push to ban the “tush push” was led by teams frustrated with the advantage it grants Philadelphia, especially since the Eagles have used it to convert critical downs consistently. But with a 22-10 vote against banning, the play remains a legal weapon, much to the dismay of rival teams and fans who want to see a level playing field.Jason Kelce, a central figure in executing this play during his career, was front and center at the meeting alongside Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie, lobbying hard to keep it in the rulebook. Yet, after the decision was made, Kelce’s quiet avoidance of the media spoke volumes. When approached, he simply said, “I’m not here to talk to the media,” signaling his desire to stay out of the spotlight amid the heated debate.On an episode of his New Heights podcast, Jason Kelce addressed rumors linking his retirement to the controversial ""tush push"" play. “Some of the owners and coaches hinted that the reason I stopped playing was because of the 'tush push,' and that I got hurt on the 'tush push' frequently.I'm just going to answer any questions people have about my partaking in this play.”“If anybody has any questions about the 'tush push,' or if I retired because of the 'tush push,' I'll tell you this right now, I'll come out of retirement today if you tell me all I have to do is run 80 'tush push' to play in the NFL. I'll do that gladly, it'll be the easiest job in the world.”What makes this saga fascinating is how it exposes the tension between innovation and tradition in football. The “tush push” isn’t just about brute force; it’s a symbol of how teams evolve to exploit every inch on the field. Critics claim it’s borderline unsportsmanlike, but supporters argue it’s just smart, hard-nosed football.Also read: “Marked safe from the Tush Push ban”: Eagles turn NFL rule drama into full-on roast after Tush Push survives ban As the Eagles gear up for the new season with the “tush push” still in their playbook, all eyes will be on whether this controversial tactic continues to shift the game or if the NFL will revisit the debate once again.

We have got strong ideas for next year: Stephen Fleming

NEW DELHI: CSK head coach Stephen Fleming sparked fresh excitement in Indian cricket circles by identifying young fast bowler Anshul Kamboj as a potential gamechanger for India’s upcoming Test tour of England Kamboj’s deceptive pace combined with his ability to hit a testing length makes him a nightmare for batsmen, especially in conditions where the ball moves off the seam.After CSK’s game against RR, Fleming described Kamboj as “an ideal bowler for English conditions” and said the Haryana pacer would be “an absolute handful” if picked for the red-ball assignment.“Kamboj is good. His speeds have been around 138-139 (kmph). He is deceptive and the ball always seems to hit the gloves harder. His big strength is his length, and he just gets the ball to wobble. You have seen it in this year’s IPL how he has performed on reasonably flat wickets. I believe he will do well on that tour (of England) if he gets conditions that seam a bit and a little bit of swing,” Fleming said. It’s not every day that a coach of Fleming’s stature singles out a relatively new face in Indian cricket and places him in the conversation for a challenging overseas Test series.“He will be an absolute handful (in English conditions).He has got some real potential with both white and red ball. We’re happy with his development and the opportunity he has taken this year,” said Fleming. “He’s shown great temperament under pressure. But what really excites me is how well he controls the ball when the conditions give him a little assistance. That’s a skill that’s hard to teach – it comes with instinct and he has it. ”Fleming’s assessment is echoed by CSK captain MS Dhoni who noted that while Kamboj doesn’t swing the ball prodigiously, the seam movement he extracts makes him a “valuable asset”.Kamboj’s progress has been rewarded with his recent selection for the India A squad touring England, where he will play two unofficial Tests against the England Lions just before the five-match Test series against England starts.In Nov 2024, he etched his name in Ranji history by becoming only the third bowler ever to claim all 10 wickets in a single innings.

Shubman Gill-led Gujarat Titans (GT) will take on Rishabh Pant's Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) at Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Thursday.With 18 points from 12 matches, table-toppers Titans have already booked their place in the playoffs. However, with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Punjab Kings (PBKS) close behind on 17 points, the race for a top-two spot is still very much alive.Everything's clicked for Gujarat this season. Their formidable top three – B Sai Sudharsan (617 runs), captain Shubman Gill (601), and Jos Buttler (500) – have been in stunning form, consistently providing the backbone for their victories. With 16 half-centuries and a century between them, they've clinically dismantled opposition bowling. The only caveat? Their middle order remains largely untested due to this top-heavy success.Gujarat's bowling is equally impressive. Spearheaded by their Indian pacers, Prasidh Krishna is the season's top wicket-taker with 21 scalps. He's been well-supported by Mohammed Siraj and the tall left-arm spinner R Sai Kishore, who have each bagged 15 wickets.The pitch at the Narendra Modi Stadium is generally known to favor batters.The ball comes onto the bat well, making it easy for batsmen to hit boundaries. The average first innings score at this venue is around 165-170, but it can be higher in recent seasons due to batting-friendly conditions. The toss-winning captain might prefer to bat first to put runs on the board, but dew can become a factor later in the evening, making chasing easier.It is going to be hot and humid day in Ahmedabad with a chance of scattered thunderstorms during the match.

Poll What do you think was the key factor in UAE's victory over Bangladesh? Strong bowling performance Consistent batting by Sharafu

Want to bring Mumbai's 'Khadoos' cricket mindset to the UAE team: Lalchand Rajput

The United Arab Emirates created history on Wednesday at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium , sealing their first-ever T20I bilateral series triumph over Bangladesh with a convincing seven-wicket win in the final match of the three-game series. The victory gave UAE a 2-1 series result, marking a significant milestone in the country’s cricketing journey.Alishan Sharafu struck the winning boundary through covers to cap off a dominant chase of 163 and sparked euphoric celebrations among his teammates. The win not only gave UAE their maiden series victory over a Full Member nation in T20Is but also dealt Bangladesh a heavy blow less than a year before the ICC T20 World Cup.After the win, Player of the Match Sharafu said, “The plan was simple, to play as many balls as possible. We had to rotate the strike and get the odd boundaries. Everyone was optimistic once that third game was announced. We believed we could win the series.”The series began with a 27-run defeat for UAE, but the hosts staged a remarkable comeback, chasing down 206 in the second T20I to level the series.In the decider, UAE’s bowlers laid the foundation with a clinical display after electing to field. Young left-arm spinner Haider Ali was the star with the ball, rattling Bangladesh’s top order and finishing with figures of 3 for 7.Despite cameos from Tanzid Hasan (40 off 18), Jaker Ali (41 off 34), and Hasan Mahmud (26* off 15), Bangladesh were restricted to 162/9, thanks to disciplined bowling and sharp fielding.In response, UAE lost skipper Muhammad Waseem early, and Muhammad Zohaib contributed 29 before falling. But Sharafu (68* off 51) stood tall, anchoring the innings with elegance and composure. He found a reliable ally in Asif Khan (41*), as the duo stitched an unbeaten 87-run partnership that dismantled Bangladesh’s hopes.Asif’s twin sixes in the penultimate over brought UAE to the brink, and Sharafu fittingly finished the job to etch UAE’s name into the record books.UAE captain and Player of the Series Waseem was emotional after the historic win and said: “Very happy with this victory... This series means a lot. The uncapped players did really well—Haider Ali was exceptional. To be honest, we didn't lose our hopes. First time I am receiving this trophy; I want to dedicate this award to my son.”“Definitely our performance wasn't up to the mark... UAE bowlers played really well. Their batters didn’t panic much, so credit goes to them,” Bangladesh captain Litton Das admitted his team fell short.","The United Arab Emirates created history on Wednesday at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium. They sealed their first-ever T20I bilateral series triumph over Bangladesh with a convincing seven-wicket win. The victory gave UAE a 2-1 series result, marking a significant milestone in the country’s cricketing journey.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121326677,imgsize-116864,width-400,resizemode-4/121326677.jpg"

'Shubman Gill used his brains a lot more than the other guys'

AHMEDABAD: On paper, the clash between Gujarat Titans and Lucknow Super Giants on Thursday appears to be an inconsequential one, with the hosts already through to the playoffs and the visitors out of the reckoning. But, the match holds significance as GT will aim for a top-two finish while LSG seek a dignified conclusion to their campaign.Table-toppers Titans are sitting pretty with 18 points from 12 matches but with Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Punjab Kings close behind on 17 points, the race for a top-two spot is still up for grabs.The Titans’ batting prowess has been evident through consistent performances from openers Shubman Gill , B Sai Sudharsan and Jos Buttler at No. 3. Although their middle order of Sherfane Rutherford, M Shahrukh Khan and Rahul Tewatia hasn’t faced extensive challenges, they’ve demonstrated reliability under pressure, as noted by assistant coach Mathew Wade.On the middle-order being untested, Wade said, “The positive thing is the middle order. Sherfane, Shahrukh and Tewatia have had good impact in the games when they’ve got the opportunity. They just haven’t got a lot of game time over the last few weeks.”Jos Buttler is set to leave GT for national duty after the conclusion of the league stage, and Wade said his absence will provide an opportunity for someone to take over his role. “We’re going to lose Jos after a few more games. So, there’s going to be another opportunity for someone to come in at No. 3.”.LSG’s performances have presented a different picture. Despite strong starts from openers Aiden Markram and Mitchell Marsh, their middle order — including Rishabh Pant, Ayush Badoni and David Miller — has struggled to deliver.",Gujarat Titans and Lucknow Super Giants play each other on Thursday. The match holds significance as GT aim for a top-two finish while LSG seek a dignified conclusion to their campaign.
