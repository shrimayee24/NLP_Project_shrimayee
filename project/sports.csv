NEW DELHI: India captain Rohit Sharma is not taken aback by Yashasvi Jaiswal 's exceptional performance in Test cricket . The young left-handed batsman's success is a direct result of his unquenchable thirst for knowledge and his determination to excel at the highest level of the sport.Since his debut in the middle of 2023, Jaiswal has accumulated an impressive 1217 runs in just 11 Test matches, including three centuries, maintaining an outstanding average of 64.05.Jaiswal's breakout performance came during the series against England earlier this year, where he amassed a staggering total of over 700 runs across the five Test matches played.His consistent and high-scoring performances have solidified his position as a rising star in the Indian cricket team, earning him well-deserved recognition and praise from his captain and teammates alike.""I am not surprised at all because the guy has got real talent. He has got the game to play in all sorts of conditions,"" Rohit said in the pre-match press meet in Bengaluru on Tuesday.""Obviously, very new to international cricket right now, so, very hard to judge. But he has got all the ingredients for success at this level,"" he added.But the early glimpses that Jaiswal showed have left skipper Rohit a pleased man.""He is somebody who wants to learn the game, learn about batsmanship. When a youngster comes into the team, his mindset is quite critical.""He always wants to improve, and is not happy with what he has achieved and which is obviously a great start to a young career. We found a great player. Hopefully, he can continue to do what he has done in the last year or so.""Throughout the history of Indian cricket, numerous exceptional players have lost their way and failed to reach their full potential. Rohit, recognising this pattern, also offered a word of caution to Jaiswal.""It is just about how he manages himself in the next couple of years. But what he has shown us in this brief period of time, you can bet on him to do wonders for the team.""He has come through the ranks. Hopefully, what he has been doing, I hope he continues to do that,"" he said.Rohit also mentioned that Jaiswal's presence in the team provides a unique advantage, considering he is a left-handed batsman.""He has played a lot of domestic cricket, under-19 cricket. He has succeeded as well, and that is why he is playing for India. It does obviously well for our team as well him being a left-hander, being an aggressive batter,"" he added.",Yashasvi Jaiswal has scored 1217 runs in just 11 Test matches for India. The left-handed batsman has scored three centuries in the process. Captain Rohit Sharma says he is not surprised by the young batsman's success.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114248909,imgsize-40658,width-400,resizemode-4/114248909.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India’s ace spinner Ravichandran Ashwin took to social media to praise Pakistan’s Kamran Ghulam , who marked his Test debut with a sensational century against England in the ongoing second Test at Multan.Ashwin, known for his thoughtful takes on cricket , acknowledged the pressure on Ghulam as he entered the spotlight, especially on the back of Babar Azam ’s omission from the rest of the England series.Ashwin wrote on X (formerly Twitter), “With all the talk about ‘Babar,’ spare a thought for Kamran Ghulam, who walks into a storm and makes a hundred,” lauding the debutant for his composed innings.Coming in as the replacement for Babar, the 29-year-old became the 13th player in Pakistan’s history to score a century on Test debut and the first to do so against England.Ghulam’s ton came at a crucial time for Pakistan, who found themselves in a spot of bother early on after losing Abdullah Shafique (7) and Shan Masood (3) cheaply.Pakistan opted to bat after winning the toss, but the English bowlers, especially Jack Leach and Matthew Potts, made early inroads to keep the hosts on the back foot.However, Ghulam displayed remarkable composure, anchoring the innings with a steady knock. He reached 102 in 192 balls, featuring nine boundaries and a six, showing his ability to both absorb pressure and play attacking strokes when needed.Ghulam’s century holds historical significance as well. He became the 11th player to score a debut ton on Pakistani soil and the second at Multan, following Taufiq Umar’s 104 against Bangladesh in 2001.Pakistan will be hoping Ghulam’s heroics set the foundation for a big first-innings total as they look to level the series after England’s victory in the first Test.",Ravichandran Ashwin takes to social media to praise Kamran Ghulam.

Mohammed Shami situation: Who exactly is not telling the truth? | Beyond The Boundary

As the Indian team gets ready for the Test series against New Zealand beginning in Bengaluru on Wednesday, four of the team's prominent names shared what playing the game's traditional format means to them.Coming into the series after a clean-sweep (2-0) against Bangladesh, India will take on the Kiwis in a three-Test series and hope to strengthen their position on top of the 2023-25 World Test Championship table.M Chinnaswamy Stadium will host the opening Test that faces a serious threat of rain on the majority of its five days, but the hosts remain focused on the job and looking forward to another chance of wearing the Test whites for the country.In build-up to the series opener, the BCCI's media team asked Mohammed Siraj Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin what Test cricket means to them as players and shared the video clip on social media.""If I were to describe Test cricket in one word, it would be 'respect',"" said Siraj, who has played 29 Tests so far and taken 78 wickets. ""To bowl with a new ball in a Test match is a different feeling, difficult to describe that.""Spinner Kuldeep Yadav, who has played 12 Tests and pocketed 53 wickets, reckoned the format is both a chance and an examination for a player. ""You need temperament and you should know how to maintain patience. I love the red ball because it allows you the chance to showcase your skills,"" he said.Yadav's senior teammate and fellow spinner Ravindra Jadeja, who will be playing his 75th Test, felt the format is the true test of a cricketer's skills and endurance over five days.""For five days, you have to come and maintain the same energy, same intensity. You have to put in the same effort on all days,"" said the 35-year-old veteran bowling all-rounder, who has taken 303 wickets and scored 3130 runs so far, including 4 hundreds and 21 fifties.The video concluded with off-spin legend Ravichandran Ashwin sharing his thoughts about the format and how it has helped him evolve as a cricketer.""The excitement still remains,"" said the 38-year-old legend, who plays the dual role of team's premier spinner and an all-rounder. ""When you start a Test, the excitement of the match starting, what the pitch is going to offer, what is this particular ground going to offer, what will the opposition be playing like -- all these things are constantly running in your head.""With 527 wickets in 102 Tests, Ashwin is the team's most experienced bowler at the moment. He has also decorated his Test career with 3423 runs, including six centuries and 14 fifties.""Aspiring to play this format enables you to keep improving on a day-to-day basis. The fact that you are looking forward to something and getting better as a cricketer is why Test cricket is amazing,"" he said, before adding a philosophical touch to the definition of Test cricket.""Test cricket is nothing but life. It's an extension of what your lifestyle is. If you have got a decent lifestyle, where it is disciplined and has a good routine, there is a better chance that you will be able to adapt and play Test cricket for a long time.""","India take on New Zealand in a three-Test series starting in Bengaluru on Wednesday.

Controversial Calls in the Third Quarter



Boxing HOFer Lou DiBella Weighs In



""This is a terrible, terrible call … the inconsistency and unpredictability of #NFL refereeing is reminiscent of #boxing judging. Where's the foul?!?! ""

Broader Criticism Times



“The #Bills-#Jets games was the worse played #NFL game I have ever seen. That was awful!! #MNF #ESPN #Football.”

“It seemed a little ridiculous. Some of them seemed really bad. Including the roughing the passer on me, that’s not roughing the passer.”

Similarities with Boxing Controversies



Fans Left Frustrated



Fans were left frustrated by a huge 22 penalties and an astonishing 204 yards surrendered in the Week 6 match between the Buffalo Bills and New York Jets . The game many fans were hoping would be a clash of the titans between the Bills' power offense and the Jets' scary defense instead was defeated by lots of referee whistles and controversy surrounding officiating.Not even Aaron Rodgers ' Hail Mary attempt could save the day with errors from the officials ruining the flow of the game.Also read - ""Will Adams Play in Week 7? Jets' Coach Teases WR's Status Ahead of Steelers Matchup"" The most controversial moment came during the third quarter when Bills linebacker AJ Epenesa sacked Rodgers with 9:32 left on the clock. The officials flagged the play as roughing the passer, claiming Epenesa put too much weight on the four-time MVP. This call ignited outrage online, as fans and analysts criticized the referees for what they saw as an excessive penalty in an already flag-heavy game.Legendary boxing promoter and International Boxing Hall of Famer Lou DiBella sounded off on social media, ranting against the refereeing:DiBella wrote in, comparing the inconsistency to that from which he usually sees at the box.DiBella was not alone in his outrage. Boxing powerbroker Rick Glaser echoed his sentiment as he called theGlaser's words only added to the continuing litany of whiners, including fans and sports insiders, who believed that officiating had derailed what should have been a competitive battle. Even Rodgers himself didn't even satisfy his taste, saying after the game:But NFL officials weren't alone. Critical remarks in the boxing world reached DiBella, who equated the controversy to another recent controversial sporting event-the Artur Beterbiev vs. Dmitry Bivol boxing match. That play was thrilling but confusing for fans when the wide and disputed scorecards left some calling it a robbery. Questionable officiating sparked cries for more accountability again, this time in the ring.For the fans, it was a blunder weekend by the officials both on the gridiron and in the ring. Aggravations from the sporting spectacle translated into frustration circles in boxing, as many now begin to question the standards of refereeing and judging in the large sporting games. Whether the NFL takes action on the criticism of the referees is yet to be seen, but one thing is certain-two sport fans are demanding much better.Also read - ""Trump to Join Steelers Game?

Kamran Nay Debut Main Century Bana Kar Babar Ko Happy Birthday Bol Diya | Basit Ali

A century on debut by Kamran Ghulam has substantiated the point that many former Pakistan players had been making in run-up to the Test series against England, and Basit Ali didn't miss the opportunity to get under the skin of Michael Vaughan who had termed dropping Babar Azam a ""stupid decision"".Coming in to bat at a shaky 19 for 2, Ghulam showcased his skills to tackle both pace and spin expertly while scoring 118 off 224 balls, including 11 fours and 1 six.Ghulam, who was awarded a debut for his consistent run in domestic cricket, added crucial 149 runs in partnership with opener Saim Ayub who scored 77.The 29-year-old Ghulam replaced Babar in the Pakistan Test squad after the former captain went through another poor outing. Along with Babar, fast bowlers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah, as well as wicketkeeper Sarfaraz Ahmad were also dropped by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).""PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi will be very happy today. He had given a statement that 'there is no replacement at the moment'. But (selectors) Aaqib Javed & Co introduced a new kid and he made a century on debut,"" said former Pakistan batsman Basit while analysing the first day's play in a video on his YouTube channel.""The best thing about the knock was that he (Ghulam) came out to bat when the score was 19 for 2,"" he added.Following the PCB's decision to drop Babar, former England captain Michael Vaughan had tweeted: ""So Pakistan haven’t won in a while .. Go 1 nil down in the series and decide to drop the best player in @babarazam258.. I guess Pakistan cricket is full of surprises but this tops the lot .. absolutely stupid decision .. unless he has asked for a break !!!""Ahead of the toss on Tuesday, in conversation with another former England captain Nasser Hussain, PCB's ex-chairman and Pakistan's World Cup winner Ramiz Raja also believed that it was probably not right to drop Babar because ""he sells cricket"" for Pakistan.But Basit disagreed, saying that the decision to drop Babar and Ghulam's century has ""opened the door for domestic performers"".""...match shuru hone se pehle baat kar rahe the ke ji 'usko rest gala kiya hai, sponsor nahi aayenge' (they were saying before the match that it was wrong to rest Babar, sponsors won't come),"" said Basit.

Mohammed Shami situation: Who exactly is not telling the truth? | Beyond The Boundary

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the first Test versus New Zealand in Bengaluru, India captain Rohit Sharma provided an update on Mohammed Shami and revealed that the seamer, who has been away from cricket since November 2023, has developed ""swelling in his knee"" and it has ""put him back a little bit in his recovery"".""To be honest, right now it is very difficult for us to make a call on him whether he will be fit for this series or Australia series.He recently had a setback. He had a swelling in his knee, which was quite unusual while he was in the process of getting fit, getting close to 100%. That put him back a little bit in his recovery,"" said Rohit at the pre-match press-conference.The Indian skipper further added that they don't want to take an ""undercooked"" Shami to Australia for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and divulged that the medical team has already put a road map in place for him.""So he had to start again fresh. Right now, he is at NCA ( National Cricket Academy ). He is working with the physios, the doctors at NCA. We are keeping our fingers crossed. We want him to be fit. We want him to be 100% fit. More than anything else, we don't want to bring an undercooked Shami to Australia. That is not going to be the right decision for us.""It is quite tough for a fast bowler having missed so much of cricket. Then suddenly to come out and be at his best, it is not ideal. We want to give him enough time to recover and be 100% fit. The physios, the trainers, the doctors have set a road map for him. He is supposed to play a couple of games before he plays international cricket. We will see where he is at after this New Zealand series. Then take a call at what stage of Australia he will be fit for us,"" added Rohit.The development was first reported by The Times of India on October 2 and it also mentioned the high chances of the 34-year-old taking another ""six-eight weeks"" to regain fitness. The report created a stir in cricketing circles and Shami took to social media platforms terming it as ""baseless rumours"".He went on to add: ""Why these type of baseless rumors? I'm working hard and trying my level best to recover. Neither the BCCI nor me have mentioned that I am out of the Border Gavaskar series. I request the public to stop paying attention to such news from unofficial sources. Please stop and don't spread such fake fake fake & fake news, especially without my statement.""Minutes after Shami's posts, TimesofIndia.com reached out to a senior member of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) who backed Shami's version and reiterated that the seamer's rehab is very much on track and he's likely to feature in the three Tests against New Zealand.Little over a week after all the drama, BCCI named the squad for the New Zealand Tests and Shami's name was missing. There was no official word from the Indian cricket board on the star's player's current situation as he continued to be away from competitive cricket since the 2023 World Cup final in November last year.A day after the squad announcement, the BCCI official insisted that Shami was very much on track for New Zealand series and it was only after some developments during his rehab that he wasn't included.""He was very much on track for New Zealand Tests as of that day. There were some developments during his rehab which tend to happen,"" added the official.Who exactly is not telling the truth?Shami said all is well, BCCI official said all is well but the Indian captain Rohit Sharma and TOI report on October 2 mention otherwise. It is further understood that Shami is not close to match fitness right now for the gruelling five Tests in Australia and the situation is very much 50-50.The seamer has been regularly posting rehab videos on social media but the bowling videos have now made way for a lot of gym work in the last few days.The first Test against Australia, scheduled to begin on November 22, is still over a month away but Shami is clearly in a race against time to regain match fitness before the high-profile series.","Mohammed Shami has been away from competitive cricket since November 2023.

Unlikely triumphs, wrenched out at Oval 1971, Port of Spain 1976, Kolkata 2001 , Brisbane 2021, and Kanpur 2024 too, for its audacity of imagination, are likely to figure in most lists.But for those of a certain vintage, India's nerve-jangling two-wicket win over Bobby Simpson 's Australia exactly 60 years ago-Oct 15, 1964 on Dussehra day-at Bombay's Brabourne Stadium ranks among the very best.""It was the most exciting Test seen in India since the 1948 (India vs West Indies in Bombay) one, some said the most exciting ever…Some Indians thought the Test compared with the tied Test (Australia vs West Indies in Brisbane, 1960),"" wrote Mihir Bose in his masterly chronicle, A History of Indian Cricket . The first line of The Times of India report summed up the national mood: ""Victory at last-And what a victory!""""It was a seesaw game,"" recalled Chandu Borde , regarded as the spine of India's middle-order in the 1960s. The pithy summary is precise. The Test, played on a freshly relaid pitch, wasn't about wildly fluctuating fortunes; it was a match of mini tremors and slow shifts. Nobody scored a century, nobody claimed a fiver in this Test won by collective enterprise and true grit.India had a bunch of notable performers. Captain MAK Pataudi entertained with 86 and 53. Vijay Manjrekar's 59 and 39 were vital. Leg-spinner BS Chandrashekhar, the other surviving member from the playing XI, scalped eight (4/50 and 4/73). And left-arm spinner Bapu Nadkarni's contributions with bat (34 & 0) and ball (2/65 and 4/33) were critical. But in the end, it was Borde and keeper KS Indrajitsinhji, who became heroes and were ""loaded with garlands"" and hoisted on shoulders by spectators.""The crowd rushed to the wicket, lifted and carried us to the pavilion,"" said Borde , now 90, on phone. He remained undefeated on 30 while forging a match-winning 32 run ninth-wicket stand with Indrajitsinhji. The keeper stonewalled the Aussie attack for 41 minutes contributing a priceless 3.In the post-match melee, someone filched Borde's brand new willow. ""One person took my bat and ran away. It was the bat I used to play in Lancashire (league). It was an English willow. That was stolen from me,"" Borde had told this reporter in 2020.The crowd's behaviour needs to be understood in the way the Test unfolded. Australia scored 320 batting first, India replying with 341. When the visitors were bowled out for 274 in their second knock, Pataudi's men-Dilip Sardesai, ML Jaisimha, Salim Durani , Hanumant Singh, among others-needed 254 to overhaul. India had never scored so many runs for a win in the fourth innings.All looked lost when six wickets fell for 122. Two of them were night watchmen, but even 50% of the target hadn't been reached yet. Then the improbable began to happen. Pataudi and Manjrekar put on 93 for the seventh wicket, before both fell within 10 runs of each other.Now it was left to Borde and Indrajitsinhji to take India home. ""There was a lot of tension on the ground. But I was okay on the pitch. And Indrajitsinhji gave me good support,"" said Borde.Every run was cheered. ""Though the faint-hearted could scarcely bear to look, Borde was playing his normal game. With seven runs wanted, offie (Tom) Veivers bowled an over-pitched ball which he off-drove for four, the next ball he drove wide of mid-on and India had won,"" wrote Edward Docker in ""History of Indian Cricket"".In 55 Tests, Borde scored 3,061 runs. He smashed five centuries, an unbeaten 177 against Pakistan in Madras being his highest. His leg-breaks fetched him 52 wickets. But it was the game changing cameo which earned him the adulation that every sportsperson dreams of.",Chandu Borde and KS Indrajitsinhji were hoisted on shoulders by spectators. India had never scored so many runs for a win in the fourth innings. Captain MAK Pataudi entertained with 86 and 53.

NEW DELHI: Former England skipper Nasser Hussain has launched a scathing critique of Pakistan cricket ’s management, arguing that the core issue lies not with players like Babar Azam Shaheen Afridi , or Naseem Shah, but with the instability and lack of forward planning within the system.Speaking on Sky Sports ahead of Pakistan’s second Test against England, Hussain underlined the constant changes in selectors, coaches, and captains as the root cause of the team’s struggles.“The issue is not Babar Azam, Shaheen Afridi, or Naseem Shah,” Hussain said. “The issue is behind the scenes in the way Pakistan cricket runs.”In his valiant attack on PCB 's structure, Hussain discussed how the lack of structure leads to reactionary decisions, such as Babar’s sudden exclusion after the first Test. “In the paper, I saw there were 26 different selectors; in another, it said 27. Nobody can keep count. How many have England had? Two or three, maybe. But if you keep changing selectors, coaches, captains—constantly shuffling leadership—it’s impossible to plan ahead. No successful business or sports team works that way. When you operate with short-term thinking, you show up unprepared, and by the time you lose the first Test, you’re already scrambling for solutions,” he further addedHe also pointed out that, while Pakistan face financial challenges compared to wealthier cricket boards, their internal issues compound the problem. “Their cricket and some of it, you give them a bit of leeway because of the way the finances of the world game have gone with the big three, and they're picking up the scraps like other nations are. So I really feel for Pakistan cricket and we mustn't be too harsh on them, but at times, they shoot themselves in the foot,” Hussain remarked.Reacting to Hussain’s remarks, former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram posted a cryptic message on X, saying, “I think finally boys are on to something here.”Pakistan are under pressure to bounce back in the second Test, which begins on Tuesday in Multan.The team has made four changes, including debuting batsman Kamran Ghulam and adding three spinners to take advantage of the re-used Multan pitch.Pakistan’s selection choices are seen as a desperate attempt to level the series after being humiliated by England in the first Test, where the visitors declared at a massive 823-7 and won by an innings and 47 runs.",Former England skipper Nasser Hussain criticizes Pakistan cricket's management.

""I think Fakhar should talk to chairman Mohsin Naqvi. Otherwise, these guys will create problems for him,"" he said.Following Babar's exclusion from the Test squad, Zaman related the situation to Virat Kohli's lean phase and that India didn't drop their star batsman despite him losing his high-scoring touch.""It's concerning to hear suggestions about dropping Babar Azam.

There is still time to avoid pressing the panic button; we should focus on safeguarding our key players rather than undermining them.""""Ladka toh boht bindaas hai, dil mein nahi rakhta baat, saaf bol deta hai (he is a brave guy, doesn't keep things inside, voices himself out clearly),"" said Basit about Zaman's comments.Zaman has been instructed to respond to the show cause notice by October 21, with his comments considered a breach of his player contract with the PCB.",Fakhar Zaman has been issued a show-cause notice by the Pakistan Cricket Board.

New Zealand

,

working hard to rediscover his game vs spin

BENGALURU: The noise surrounding Virat Kohli's struggle against spin has been mounting, only getting shriller as his ordinary numbers against tweakers has burgeoned. In the past 28 Test matches, Kohli has been dismissed by spinners on 21 occasions, with off-spinners doing the bulk of the damage.Like always, Kohli may have chosen to ignore the clatter, but given his penchant for detail and work ethic, he perhaps has been hard on himself. It showed on Monday at the M Chinnaswamy stadium when the former India skipper spent considerable time facing spinners in the nets. There were the odd deliveries where he second-guessed himself, but there were plenty of assured cuts and hoists over the infield, all of them executed with impeccable footwork.While making his mark in red-ball cricket as a youngster, Kohli found comfort at this venue. Back in 2012 against New Zealand, he clobbered a century (103) and an unconquered 51, runs that eventually proved crucial in India's five-wicket win.Staying with back stories, over the past eight years, Kohli has played against New Zealand in four home matches and, barring Trent Boult and Neil Wagner , none of the pacers managed to dismiss him. But he has faltered against the Kiwis' assembly line of spinners - Jeetan Patel, Ajaz Patel, Mitchell Santner and Rachin Ravindra .The recent series against Bangladesh again underscored Kohli's woes against spin. In four innings, he returned 99 runs and fell to off-spin twice. The tendency to play early or play against the spin has done him no favours.If ever Kohli needed a comfort zone, then this venue must offer that. This, after all, is his 'home' ground with Royal Challengers Bengaluru and the odds are that it could help him rediscover his mojo against spin.As Kohli looks to climb back among the runs, he's found a staunch supporter in head coach Gautam Gambhir . Speaking on his stuttering top-order bat, Gambhir said on Monday, ""You don't keep judging people after every game. It's not fair on them. It's a sport. People fail all the time. Everyone doesn't have the best days every day. My job is to back players and select the best playing 11.""Another subplot to the Kohli story is milestones. The 35-year-old is 53 runs shy of 9,000 runs, yet the 10,000 landmark is already being spoken about.While Gambhir didn't take the milestone bait, he outlined Kohli's hunger to excel.""He is a world-class cricketer,"" Gambhir said. ""He has performed for such a long period. And he is as hungry as when he made his debut. That is what makes him a world-class cricketer. I am sure that he will be hungry to get runs in this series, and probably moving forward to Australia as well. Once he starts scoring, he can be very consistent. I'm sure that he will be looking forward to these three Test matches and the series in Australia.""","Virat Kohli has been dismissed by spinners on 21 occasions in past 28 Test matches. In recent series against Bangladesh, he returned 99 runs and fell to off-spin twice. Royal Challengers Bengaluru head coach Gautam Gambhir has backed Kohli.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114232531,imgsize-80574,width-400,resizemode-4/114232531.jpg"

""(I am) very happy that they (teammates) are happy I did well. It can get frustrating knowing what you can do out there, and I have also felt I can do much better,” he admitted during the post-match presentation.The Kerala-born cricketer also acknowledged the challenges of inconsistent form but emphasized the importance of staying focused. ""Playing for your country, that pressure was there, but I wanted to perform and wanted to show. But I still kept it basic and wanted to take it by one ball (at a time),” Samson shared.Samson credited the team leadership for standing by him through ups and downs. “The leadership tells me they back me no matter what... not just in words but in actions also.

NEW DELHI: As Pakistan face England in the second Test in Multan that got underway in Multan on Tuesday, cricketer-turned-commentator Ramiz Raja shared his thoughts on the exclusion of former captain and batting mainstay Babar Azam from the Test side.In a clip shared by Sky Sports Cricket in which Ramiz Raja is talking at the sidelines after the toss, during the talk show that also has former England captain Nasser Hussain On being asked by the presenter as to what the selectors need to do with Babar Azam as his returns have been mediocre of late, Ramiz Raja responds, ""It should have been Babar's call, whether he wanted time out from the playing XI or not. I think it was a knee-jerk reaction, new selectors in, the general opinion was that he needed rest and he was taken out of the squad completely.""Ramiz Raja adds, ""Now we need to understand that he sells cricket for Pakistan and this debate that's happening right now in Pakistan whether it's going to be another failure for Babar Azam or whether he's going to make a comeback and that keeps things interesting. Right now I don't see any saleable commodity in this Pakistan team, because sponsors are a little wary as well because Pakistan has been on the losing sequence and there are no real superstars playing in this Test match now.""The decision to leave out the top quartet for the final two Test matches against England - batter Babar Azam, former captain Sarfaraz Ahmed, and elite pacers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah-was supported by the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) on Tuesday.After suffering a historic loss by an innings and 47 runs in the first game of the series, Pakistan declared on Sunday that it was replacing its established stars with younger players, a move that caught the cricket world off guard.According to the PCB, the decision to drop players from the team was made with Pakistan's cricket team's best interests in mind.According to a PCB spokesman, the players were ""spared from the team to give them rest so that they can come back afresh,"" supporting the board's decision.The PCB's announcement of the decision to reorganize the men's selection committee before the decision.

The Pakistan women's team collapsed like a house of cards on Monday while chasing a victory and a place in the T20 World Cup semifinals, getting bowled out for just 56 against New Zealand in the penultimate group match of the tournament.After restricting New Zealand to a manageable 110 for 6, Pakistan first slipped to 28 for 5 and then crashed from 52 for 6 to 56 all out in 11.4 overs in an effort to win quickly to improve their net run rate and secure a semifinal berth.However, it's Australia and New Zealand who reached the semis from Group A, while India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka were eliminated from the race.The win upset former Pakistan players and cricket experts, including ex-batsman Basit Ali .""It seemed like Pakistan were playing badminton, not cricket,"" said the 53-year-old Basit. ""Pakistan women's cricket chairperson is a badminton player.

BENGALURU: Captaincy is not unfamiliar territory for Tom Latham When New Zealand last played a Test in India - in 2021 in Mumbai - Latham stood in for an injured Kane Williamson . Since then he has stepped in for Tim Southee , who took over in 2022, on a few occasions. This series against India, coming on the back of New Zealand's 0-2 rout at the hands of Sri Lanka , will be Latham's first as full-time skipper.Given India's enviable record at home and the Black Caps' struggle in recent times, it will be a baptism by fire for the 32-year-old.""It's a huge, exciting privilege for me to be in this position,"" said Latham on the captaincy. ""I've been in this position before, have captained here in India, and have done it back home as well.""New Zealand are already out of the reckoning for a World Test Championship (WTC) final berth and the absence of Kane Williamson has added to the visitors' problems.""It's disappointing not to have Kane here. Fingers crossed, he'll be ready as soon as possible. It's disappointing when you miss a senior guy like Kane, but it gives opportunities for other guys to put their hand up,"" said Latham . Will Young will be the replacement, said Latham. ""Youngie will play and bat at No. 3. He's been in our squad for a long period. He's performed well in the past.""Southee, who relinquished captaincy after the debacle in Sri Lanka, has been struggling with form but could still find a place in the squad following a knee injury to Ben Sears .""Ben Sears has been ruled out, so if we do end up going with three seamers, then obviously Tim will come right into the equation.""As India start overwhelming favourites, Latham believes his team is not low on confidence. Notwithstanding the series loss to Sri Lanka, he said there were plenty of positives which he hopes will come handy in India.""I think that the first Test was a reasonably small margin in terms of defeat. But we did a lot of good stuff on the tour. From a batting point of view, you take away the first innings of the second Test. We changed our approach a little in terms of how we played and things unfolded. And we did that well,"" he added.",Tom Latham will captain New Zealand for the first time against India. The 32-year-old stood in for an injured Kane Williamson in the last Test in India.

says 'roadmap has been set' for injured pacer's return to full fitness

Mohammed Shami situation: Who exactly is not telling the truth? | Beyond The Boundary

BENGALURU: October 19, 2023 was a game changing day for Mohammed Shami . As India grappled with the injury to Hardik Pandya during the 50-over World Cup at home, the pacer, who was until then warming the bench, found himself on the field.The rest is history as the 34-year-old finished as the leading wicket taker of the World Cup, with 24 wickets from just seven matches.However, an Achilles tendon injury which needed surgery has kept Shami out since then. He wasn't available for the New Zealand series starting on Wednesday. The all-important five-Test away series in Australia is the next target but Shami is unlikely to make it Down Under.""Right now, it is pretty difficult for us to take a call on him, whether he will be fit for the Australia series ,"" skipper Rohit Sharma said here on Tuesday, adding: ""He recently had a setback. While he was in the process of getting close to 100% fit, he experienced swelling in his knee, which was quite unusual. That put him back a little bit in his recovery. So, he had to start afresh.""Shami, who hasn't featured in a Test match since the World Test Championship (WTC) final in June last year, is currently undergoing rehabilitation at theNational Cricket Academy (NCA). Rohit underlined that the team management will not rush Shami back.""We want him to be 100% fit. We don't want to take an undercooked Shami to Australia. He has not played cricket for a year, and it is quite tough for a fast bowler to come out and be at his best. It is not ideal. So, we want to give him enough time to recover,"" added Rohit.Shami will have to prove his match fitness in the Ranji Trophy before returning to international duty. ""A roadmap has been set. He is supposed to play a couple of games before (playing) international cricket. We will see where he is at after this New Zealand series, and then take a call, at what stage of Australia he will be fit for us,"" explained Rohit.","Mohammed Shami hasn't played a Test match since the World Test Championship (WTC) final in June last year. The 34-year-old finished as the leading wicket taker of the World Cup, with 24 wickets from just seven matches. He wasn't available for the New Zealand series starting on Wednesday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114267789,imgsize-40214,width-400,resizemode-4/114267789.jpg"

Mohammed Shami situation: Who exactly is not telling the truth? | Beyond The Boundary

'

HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN OUR LEADERSHIP GROUP'

BENGALURU: They are not called 'standbys' any more but 'travelling reserves' and their relevance and growth in Indian cricket is on the rise. This is especially true of the new breed of faster bowlers.Given the fact that India play eight Test matches from now until early Jan, there has been a lot of emphasis on workload management in Test cricket. With Mohammed Shami a doubtful starter and the five-Test Australia series being strenuous, India skipper Rohit Sharma on Tuesday stressed on bringing the pace resources together.For the home series against New Zealand, India have young pacers Harshit Rana (22-year-old), Mayank Yadav (22), Nitish Kumar Reddy (21) in the mix.Meanwhile, Karnataka's injury prone pacer Prasidh Krishna , the fourth travelling reserve, is learnt to have picked up an injury during the Ranji Trophy match against Madhya Pradesh, in which he bowled just eight overs.Barring Nitish, who has played 20 first-class matches, the other two are greenhorns in red-ball cricket and are unlikely to make the Test team soon.""In batting, there are a lot of options. We want to create the same with the bowlers. Hence, we try to keep them within the squad. If we feel they are ready to take that role, they should be ready for it. We just want to make sure that they are monitored well. Their workloads have been taken care of. Sometimes you have to fast-track someone and that is for the betterment of Indian cricket,"" reasoned Rohit.Rana and Mayank have impressed the leader. ""We want to create a pool where even if there are injuries, we have someone to step in quickly. Nitish and Harshit are talented individuals. In the future, they are going to provide a lot of stability to the team. Now, we want to see what they are capable of and what they have to offer.""Another pacer who may have to shoulder additional responsibility is Jasprit Bumrah , who has been named Rohit's deputy. With doubts about Rohit's availability for the early part of the Australia series, focus will be on Bumrah. The bowling spearhead, who led India in 2022 against England after Rohit tested positive for Covid-19, understands the team's requirements well, according to Rohit.""Bumrah and I have played a lot of cricket. He understands the game well and has got a good head on his shoulders. Tactically, I can't say much because he has not captained much.""When you are in a situation where you need a leader to step up, I think Bumrah will be one of them. He has always been in our leadership group,"" said Rohit.","India have young pacers Harshit Rana, Mayank Yadav and Nitish Kumar Reddy in the mix for the home series against New Zealand.

Rain may heavily impact first India-NZ Test starting today

Mohammed Shami situation: Who exactly is not telling the truth? | Beyond The Boundary

BENGALURU: The only people who braved the relentless rain and made it to the M Chinnaswamy stadium on Tuesday were the ground staff.Continuous rain left roads in the city waterlogged and the traffic in a mess, but at the stadium, all was quiet and peaceful on the eve of the first India-New Zealand Test.More rain has been forecast for the next two days, jeopardising the first of three Tests between India and New Zealand. But if the elements relent by Wednesday morning, a game would be on, thanks to the state-of-the-art SubAir drainage system at the venue.Weather permitting, there will be plenty to look forward to from Rohit Sharma and Co. They have momentum on their side and will be keen to get as much game time as possible ahead of the meatier five-Test away series in Australia next month.For over a decade, India have dominated at home, quite unlike any other Test-playing side, a fact that has been rarely acknowledged amid the euphoria surrounding the country's white ball success. An 18-series winning streak at home underlines their mastery of the format.The Indians have been fine ambassadors of the long format, putting those who believe Test cricket has a foot in the grave to shame with a fearless, exciting brand of cricket.They have consigned talk of surfaces and advantages to the bin, owning every pitch they have played on. They have conjured wins from near-impossible situations and their star cast has fired the imagination.Head coach Gautam Gambhir on Monday underlined the team's philosophy, which is to produce an environment where players employ their natural instincts without the fear of failure.The home series against England offered ample proof of the emerging talent. Five players - Sarfaraz Khan, Rajat Patidar, Dhruv Jurel, Akash Deep and Devdutt Padikkal - made their debut and were impressive.The team without Virat Kohli , KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant won the series 4-1. The think-tank's eye for detail and investment in the future is reflected in their pick of the travelling reserves.As skipper Rohit Sharma said, ""I understand that some of them have not played a lot of red ball cricket, but when you see talent, you want to try and groom it and bring it as close to the team (standard) as possible.""In a short period, they have shown they have some ability. We want to keep them with the team and see whether they will be ready for international cricket, especially Test cricket. We want to create a bench strength. We don't want to be worried or too heavily reliant on a few individuals.""Against the red-hot home side, the Black Caps will have their task cut out. Coming off a two-match thrashing in Sri Lanka, among the few positives they will take from the loss to the Islanders is acclimatisation to sub-continental conditions, especially since their one-off Test against Afghanistan was abandoned in Noida last month.Among the batters, barring Rachin Ravindra (153), Kane Williamson (138) and to some extent Glenn Philips (131), the others hardly got an eye in. To compound the visitors' woes, Williamson has been ruled out of at least the first Test with a groin strain.If there was a sunny side to the annihilation in Lanka, it would be the familiarity with conditions the bowlers experienced after toiling against a formidable home side.There is a cloud of uncertainty about Tim Southee making the cut but given the overcast conditions and the variety at his disposal, his place in the XI may just be safe.","Heavy rain in Bengaluru prevented both teams from training while keeping the groundsmen busy at the Chinnaswamy stadium.

""The selectors will breathe a sigh of relief"" 😅 | Nasser Hussain and Urooj Mumtaz review Day One

NEW DELHI: Former England captain Nasser Hussain was quick to heap praise on Pakistan’s Test debutant Kamran Ghulam , drawing comparisons to Australia’s Steve Smith for the 29-year-old’s balance of aggression and resilience at the crease.Ghulam made an unforgettable impact on Tuesday, guiding his team out of early trouble with a masterful century against England in the second Test at Multan.Nasser Hussain, speaking on Sky Sports, praised Ghulam’s adaptability in tricky conditions. “He had to wait his turn. He's been scoring prolific runs in the last three years. He got the right balance between attack and defence,” Hussain said.Hussain was particularly struck by Ghulam’s “swagger” at the crease, noting how the debutant seamlessly switched between attacking strokes and defensive solidity. He likened Ghulam’s footwork and defensive technique to that of Steve Smith, adding, “He's got a bit of Steve Smith about him when he defends the ball and charges. He's got a bit of swagger about him.”Ghulam was brought into the squad as a replacement for Pakistan’s star batter, Babar Azam , and he rose to the occasion in spectacular fashion.His innings of 118 off 224 balls was the backbone of Pakistan’s recovery after they found themselves reeling at 19 for 2.By stumps on Day 1, Pakistan had clawed their way to 259/5, thanks largely to Ghulam’s determined knock.Facing a probing England attack, Ghulam handled pressure with ease. Jack Leach , who had removed both Pakistani openers, was expertly neutralised by Ghulam. His 149-run stand with Saim Ayub (77) was critical in stabilising Pakistan’s innings.Ghulam’s century, which came off 192 balls, was a gritty display of mental toughness and technical skill.His innings included 11 boundaries and a six, with frequent strike rotation to keep England’s bowlers under pressure. It was a debut to remember—one that not only gave Pakistan hope but also hinted at a bright future for Ghulam at the international level.","Kamran Ghulam made an unforgettable impact on Tuesday, guiding his team out of early trouble with a masterful century against England in the second Test at Multan.

After hitting that blistering hundred against Bangladesh in the third T20 in Hyderabad three days ago, Sanju Samson broadened his horizons and revealed his burning ambition to play Test cricket for India.With the BCCI making it clear that all Indian team players must play domestic cricket when they are not on national duty, Samson will be playing Kerala’s second-round Ranji Trophy match against Karnataka at Alur, starting on Friday.“Before the Duleep Trophy, the leadership group sent me a message saying that they were looking at me as a red-ball option too and asked me to play Ranji Trophy. The Duleep Trophy performance (scoring a hundred) helped. I believe that I can play all three formats. I don’t want to be restricted to white-ball cricket. I have the desire to play Tests for India. I played well in the Ranji Trophy before and I want to do well in the coming days as well,” the 29-year-old said at a media interaction in Thiruvananthapuram.Samson also clarified that while discussions are ongoing regarding his batting slot, he is open to playing at any position. “I have trust in my ability and from No.1 to No.6, I have the skillset to bat anywhere.”Samson admitted that he felt pressure after failing in Sri Lanka. “When you fail in a match and when you walk out to bat for the next, there will be tension. Even the great players have said that. So I felt that pressure when I went out to bat after scoring two ducks. While there is pressure on one side, on the other side I know what I can do in this format (T20) and have the confidence to deliver.”He also praised the new captain-coach combo of Suryakumar Yadav and Gautam Gambhir for building confidence amongst the players.“Surya has great communication skills. He is straightforward and gives us role clarity. Every player in Team India is getting that clarity. He is supporting the players and backing them. Surya is doing a lot of things which a leader should do. Players enjoy that trust and they can perform well.”Samson feels that Gambhir has backed him right from the time he took charge of the team. “Gautam said, you will have my support. I know the kind of player you are, and I have been seeing you for many years. You try to enjoy your batting. We are all there for you. Getting that kind of confidence from a coach is crucial for a player,” revealed Samson.",Sanju Samson has revealed his burning ambition to play Test cricket for India.

At 25, the French football star has faced multiple issues off the field.Mbappe, who has been dealing with fitness problems, is involved in a financial dispute with PSG.He claims PSG owes him 55 million euros ($60 million) in unpaid wages and bonuses from the previous season.Additionally, Mbappe is reported to be a suspect in a rape investigation in Sweden. He has dismissed these allegations as ""fake news."" The Swedish prosecutor confirmed the investigation without naming him.Mbappe has taken the financial dispute with PSG to a French league committee. He suggests a link between the rape report and his ongoing legal battles with PSG, writing on X: ""It's becoming so predictable, on the eve of the hearing, as if by chance.""Mbappe rose to fame as a teenager at Monaco and later became PSG's all-time top scorer.In March 2023, he was appointed captain of the French national team by coach Didier Deschamps.

NEW DELHI: The Nigerian national football team found themselves in a distressing situation as they were reportedly stranded at an airport in Libya , devoid of food and water, mere 24 hours before their crucial match against the host nation.Libya, however, expressed their discontent, alleging that they were subjected to 'poor treatment' during their visit to Nigeria.As tensions escalate ahead of the return leg, Nigeria 's players have been left exasperated by their current predicament, with Leicester City midfielder Wilfred Ndidi going as far as to suggest that they were being held 'hostage' by their hosts.In the previous encounter between the two sides, which took place in Nigeria as part of the African Cup of Nations qualifiers, the Super Eagles emerged victorious with a narrow 1-0 margin, thanks to a late goal from Fissayo Dele-Bashiru.According to media reports, the Nigerian players and team officials were virtually held hostage for over 12 hours at Al Abraq International Airport , which was about three hours away by road to Benghazi , the venue of Tuesday's match against Libya.The plane, carrying both players and officials, was unexpectedly rerouted from its original destination of Benghazi to Al Abraq, a smaller airport primarily used for hajj operations, while in mid-flight.Upon landing at Al Abraq, the Nigerian team found themselves stranded without any support from the Libyan Football Federation . The host team neglected to make the necessary arrangements to transport the team to Benghazi, leaving them in a difficult position.The vehicle arranged for the trip by the officials of Super Eagles was also not allowed to access the airport further compounding the challenges faced by the Nigerian team.As a result, the Nigerian team withdrew from their Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Libya on Monday, according to captain William Troost-Ekong.","The Nigerian national football team were stranded at an airport in Libya.

Every kid watches cartoons, right? But I didn’t watch cartoons. I just used to watch sports, tennis specially.“So, my parents were like, ‘she likes it.We have to put her on to that’. So my uncle, he knows tennis coaches. But when I started at the age of 3, the coach was like ‘no, she’s small. She can’t play, she cannot understand anything'.“But I was happy to play tennis, and I was interested in playing tennis.”That was a decade ago, in Mendhasala in Odisha Now 14, not a grown-up yet, Aahan announced her arrival on the big stage by claiming a double crown, the Under-14 and Under-16 girls’ singles titles at the Fenesta Open National championships in New Delhi last week.It gets ever more incredible when you consider that she entered the Under-16 event as a qualifier and went all the way. Besides, she also played doubles in U-16, losing in the second round though.In the U-16 final, Aahan beat Aishwarya Jadhav , the eighth seeded Maharashra girl against whom she has a 1-1 head to head in the ITF juniors circuit. Aishwarya, two years older than the Odisha girl, had won her first juniors title in a Grade 5 tournament in Ahmedabad recently.“I’m happy, but it was very tough,” Aahan, who is currently coached by Santosh Malik, said.“Each and every round was tough. But I was just focused on each and every point. Like, I want to win this point, and next point, like that. So I was fully focused and my target was (to) win both the tournaments.So, I tried my best and the rest is the result (two titles).”Aahan’s first coach was Ajay Nishank, under whose tutelage she was until a year ago when she started working with Malik. She also has access to the Abhinav Bindra Targeting Performance (ABTP) centre in Bhubaneswar, where she is one of the athletes from various disciplines who get free fitness training under a programme by the Odisha state government ’s department of sports.She, along with Tavish Pahwa, was a part of the Asian junior team that was picked for an European exposure trip under the Grand Slam Player Development Programme of the ITF earlier this year.“In Europe, it was tough matches and I was a little bit nervous. But when I started winning matches, then I started to feel confident, like ‘yeah, I can beat them’,” she said.Aahan, while brimming with confidence and optimism, is also aware which areas of her game she has to improve.“I have to improve my serve and forehand. And a little bit in volleys,” she said.“I’m good in volleys. When I play doubles, I do good volleys. But in singles I have to do better because, you know, in singles that is tough. You have to cover the full court.“Like, if the opponent is giving you a lob, you have to cover that. You have to be confident, ‘yeah, I can do this. So I’ll go (up) front’.”For a youngster of her age, Aahan has remarkable clarity of what her long terms goals are and how to get there.“Yeah, in ITF, I want to be in top 100, so I can play the WTA (Tour events). In juniors, if I get in top 100, I’ll get a chance to play junior slams like the Australia open or US Open Junior slam.“Then, I can learn and work more on that thing, and then I’ll collect the points in ITF. Then I can play the Slams.”","Aahan won the Under-14 and Under-16 girls’ singles titles at the Fenesta Open National championships in New Delhi last week.
