The art of giving without glory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-art-of-giving-without-glory/articleshow/123585835.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. At a recent award ceremony featuring stars, YouTubers, and comedians, I saw a young woman seemingly out of place — quiet and shy — When her name was announced, the hall fell silent — Selva Brinda of Trichy, a young mother who donated more than 300 litres of breast milk over 22 months to premature and malnourished infants in government hospitals. Her act of silent generosity reminded me of a verse from the Thirukkural : Eaththuvakkum Inbam AriyaarKol Thaamudaimai Vaiththizhakkum Vanka Navar “Do the hard-hearted, who hoard their wealth only to lose it someday, Not know the joy of giving?” ( Kural 228) Thiruvalluvar does not preach here—he questions, almost with disbelief, why anyone would cling to what would eventually slip away. I was fortunate to learn the art of giving from my grandmother. She never went to school but taught us something no school could teach. When beggars came to our door, she would hand us small coins, and we would run joyfully to give them. When the poor asked for rice instead, she would give it herself. I once asked her why and said, “My palms are bigger than yours—they can hold more.” From this wonderful woman, I learned three lessons that shaped my understanding of giving. The first is that giving should be silent. My grandmother gave because she wanted to, not because anyone was watching. Today, I sometimes see social media reels of influencers distributing food or clothes to the poor—always with cameras turned on. The act of kindness is shared, but so is the humiliation of the receiver. The second lesson is that if you choose to give, give the best. I still remember the days after the tsunami, when we received ten large sacks of relief material filled with torn clothes, broken slippers, cracked vessels—discards rather than gifts of the heart. Giving is not about clearing cupboards. If your hands extend to another, let them carry the best you own—the blanket you would choose for your own child, the food you yourself would eat. The third lesson is that giving must be immediate. The more we wait, the more our minds bargain—why give so much, why give at all? The Mahabharata has a story of Karna that captures this. One day, while eating, he was approached by a poor man seeking alms. Without pausing, he scooped a handful from a heap of gold coins beside him, with his left hand, and gave it. The old man, surprised, gently reminded him that alms should not be offered with the left hand. Karna apologised and explained, “I was eating, yes, but I feared that if I delayed it even for a moment, I might give less than I intended.” Such was his urgency to give, as if the opportunity itself was sacred. When I see acts like Selva Brinda’s, I’m reminded of these three lessons again: a young mother who gave quietly, gave the best she had, and gave without delay. Science today tells us that generosity releases oxytocin, the ‘love hormone’, and floods the giver with joy. But long before science measured it, human hearts knew it. The bliss of giving is not just an emotion—it is the only wealth that grows by sharing. Why hoard what must one day be left behind? To give is to live twice—once for oneself, and once for the other.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123595335,imgsize-75890,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/123595335.jpg"

Anna Kournikova, 44, reveals pregnancy with Enrique Iglesias after health scare

Anna Kournikova and Enrique Iglesias’ family life in Miami

“It was just meant to be sweet in the moment. I honestly didn’t mean to confuse people.

I thought it’d be easier for the audience to understand than if I said ‘my girl.’”

“I’ve never really thought marriage would make a difference. Maybe it’s because I come from divorced parents, but I don’t think you love someone more because of a piece of paper.”

Former tennis star Anna Kournikova, 44, is pregnant with her fourth child with long-time partner, singer Enrique Iglesias, 50. The news was reported on Thursday by Spanish magazine Hola, which said that the Russian athlete is already halfway through her pregnancy and “everything is going well. ” This comes only months after she was spotted in a wheelchair in Miami, wearing a protective boot, sparking concern about her health.The couple, who have been together since 2001, already share three children- twins Lucy and Nicholas, both 7, and their younger daughter Mary, who is 5.Anna Kournikova was last photographed in early August in Miami, where she was seen taking her children to martial arts classes, a rare public outing that reassured fans after earlier health concerns.Anna Kournikova retired from professional tennis in 2003 at just 21 after repeated injuries to her back and feet. Her health history made the sight of her in a wheelchair in January this year especially worrying for fans. She was seen at Bal Harbour Mall in Miami, wearing an orthopedic boot, but later appeared to recover well.Anna Kournikova and Iglesias have built a private family life in Miami, where the Spanish singer has lived since the late 1990s. The couple first met in 2001 when Kournikova appeared in Enrique Iglesias’s music video for his hit single Escape. Although they have been together for over two decades, they have never confirmed if they are married. Iglesias once explained in 2012:He also shared his views on marriage, saying:The couple recently expanded their property portfolio in Miami by purchasing a five-bedroom home in Bay Point for $6.5 million, according to the Miami Herald.Also Read: “No Room For Emotions”: Novak Djokovic Reveals How Athlete Stereotypes Hurt His Relationship With Wife Jelena While Enrique Iglesias continues touring worldwide, Kournikova has kept a very low profile.

India cricketers eye Test berths with Duleep Trophy | All eyes on Mohammed Shami and other pacers

Auqib Nabi on Friday achieved a rare milestone, becoming the first in Duleep Trophy history and the fourth Indian in first-class cricket to take four wickets in four balls, claiming a five-wicket haul, including a hat-trick, as East Zone were dismissed for 230 on the second day of the Duleep Trophy quarterfinals against North Zone.North Zone extended their overnight score from 308/6 to 405 all out, with wicketkeeper Kanhaiya Wadhawan scoring 76 runs, giving North a substantial lead of 183 runs. Arshdeep Singh , who is set to play in the Asia Cup, and Harshit Rana displayed their bowling acumen throughout the day's three sessions. Arshdeep's performance was particularly noteworthy as this was his first first-class match since October 2024.He had recently recovered from a left thumb injury sustained during an intra-squad match in Beckenham, England, in July. The left-arm pacer bowled 17 overs with consistent intensity, utilising the overcast conditions and the two-paced pitch effectively.Rana, who last played first-class cricket against England Lions, claimed the wickets of Utkarsh Singh and Sridam Paul with his powerful deliveries. Utkarsh’s dismissal came from a controversial caught-behind decision off a leg-side delivery, while Paul was dismissed when the ball took his outside edge to Wadhawan.Arshdeep’s dismissal of Sharandeep Singh was notable, with the ball clipping the off-stump bails.East Zone’s position worsened despite Virat Singh’s 69 off 102 balls, as Nabi triggered a collapse. Nabi’s hat-trick came in the 53rd over by dismissing Manishi and Mukhtar Hussain, and he completed his five-wicket haul by removing Mohammed Shami in an exceptional spell of 3.1-0-5-5. East Zone lost five wickets for just eight runs, collapsing from 222/5 to 230 all out.“They have been giving their all for the country, and I learned to keep a positive mindset from them. When you get a chance, you have to do well,” said Nabi. Arshdeep added, “You saw his hard work in the Ranji Trophy . The discipline in which he bowled, he got 5 wickets in 2 overs. So, a lot of credit goes to him.”Earlier in the morning session, East Zone's Manishi claimed six wickets, all leg before wicket, quickly ending North’s first innings. Wadhawan, who faced tough deliveries from Shami resulting in blows to his gloves and head, partnered with Nabi to add 66 runs for the eighth wicket before Manishi dismissed Nabi.","Auqib Nabi takes four wickets in four balls, including a hat-trick, as East Zone are dismissed for 230 on the second day of the Duleep Trophy quarterfinals against North Zone.

MUMBAI: Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar 's annual party, postponed after being initially planned in May because of a war-like situation between India and neighbours Pakistan, finally happened at the Mumbai Cricket Association's Bandra-Kurla Complex Recreation Club on Sunday night. Incidentally, it turned out to be the same day when India's Test batting stalwart Cheteshwar Pujara announced his retirement from cricket.Just a day earlier (on August 23), Gavaskar and former ICC, BCCI , and MCA president Sharad Pawar had unveiled a statue of himself at the entrance of the MCA's Sharad Pawar Cricket Museum.Gavaskar's fierce patriotism came to the fore when the invitation card for the party itself mentioned that the event was being held to ""celebrate the success of Operation Sindoor and the performance of the Indian cricket team in England, which has won the hearts of all Indians."" Operation Sindoor was India's substantial response to Pakistan in the wake of the Pahalgam attacks on April 22. While led by a young, debutant captain in Shubman Gill, India, against all expectations, drew a hard-fought series against England 2-2 while playing some thoroughly entertaining and magnificent cricket.On the occasion, Gavaskar didn't forget to remember his old childhood friends who had departed and were a regular feature at his annual event.At the entrance of the hall, Gavaskar remembered all his childhood friends and former Mumbai teammates Milind Rege, Ehsan Hakim, Vijay Karkhanis, Padmakar Shivalkar, Abdul Ismail and his India teammate Dilip Doshi, with their names inscribed on miniature bats.Present on the occasion was former India captain Nari Contractor, who is 91 now. However, three other cricketers of yesteryear who are all in their 90s — ex-India allrounder Chandu Borde, ex-India ‘keeper Chandu Patankar, and former Rajasthan leg-spinner Chandu Joshi — couldn’t make it due to health reasons. Apparently, Joshi started off from Pune for the party, but had to return from Lonavala as he wasn’t feeling well.The guests at the do included Dilip Vengsarkar, India's 1983 World Cup heroes Sandeep Patil and Balwinder Singh Sandhu, former India wicketkeeper and ex-Kolkata Knight Riders and current Madhya Pradesh head coach Chandrakant Pandit, ex-India players Pravin Amre, Raju Kulkarni, Yajurvindra Singh Bilkha and Jatin Paranjape. Ex-India seamer-turned-commentator Irfan Pathan's presence attracted eyeballs too.In a video message, Gavaskar said, “What a wonderful last 10 days it has been! On August 15, which was our 78th Independence Day, it also happened to be my mother's 100th birth anniversary. Our family got together, it was such a fun evening. I'm pretty certain that my parents, my mother, looking from the heavens above, would have also had fun seeing practically the whole family get together to celebrate her 100th birthday. ”“And then a few days later, my statue was unveiled at the Wankhede Stadium, something which I had not even dreamt of when I started playing cricket in the Bhagirathi buildings. And the day after that, we got together to celebrate Operation Sindoor and the young Indian team's performance in England. It was the annual get-together that I generally have for all those whom I have played with right from school, college, club, and Ranji Trophy level, so it was also such a wonderful evening. I can't be thankful enough to God almighty to have the opportunity to have a get-together and celebrate all three occasions with all my family and friends. Normally, it is Milind and Anil Joshi (Gavaskar’s old friend) who organise everything, but this time I’m thankful to Anil for organising the party. We missed Milind Rege, Abdul bhai Ismail, my skipper ‘Papa’ Karkhanis, ‘Paddy’ Shivalkar, and Dilip Doshi. We also missed some others who couldn’t make it.”As usual, Gavaskar's party didn't have any speeches or loud music, just some precious anecdotes that went perfectly with the alcohol and some highly delicious food that was served right through the evening.",Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar held his annual party on Sunday night.

Clark Hunt stands firm to protect team's classic legacy

Fans across generations react to jersey redesign rejection

Supporters applaud consistency over constant jersey updates

Nike rivalries initiative meets Chiefs commitment to tradition

Jersey debate reflects tension between history and innovation

Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt has once again shut down Nike’s attempts to redesign the team’s iconic jersey, sparking a firestorm among younger NFL fans. While the franchise preserves its legendary red-and-gold look, social media is ablaze with debate—should tradition trump trend, or is it time for a bold makeover?“Almost every year, Nike presents to Clark Hunt a proposal for a redesigned Chiefs jersey or an alternate. Every time he tells them, ‘Nah, we’re good. This is why,’” tweeted Chiefs beat writer Matt Derrick on X Thursday. Hunt’s decision isn’t just about aesthetics—it’s a tribute to his father, Lamar Hunt, the team’s founding owner, whose preference for a classic look continues to define the franchise’s identity.The rejection has divided fans online. “Gen Z and Gen Alpha are weeping,” one fan wrote, perfectly capturing the younger audience’s desire for flashy, modern uniforms. Many crave change, seeing alternate jerseys as a chance to express individuality and keep the NFL’s visual culture fresh. For them, Hunt’s “Nah, we’re good” feels like a missed opportunity for creativity and fan engagement.Not everyone is upset. “I may be in the minority here, but I kind of like the changes every now and again. Although I do appreciate Clark honoring his father’s preference for a classic look for his team and understand that,” shared another fan online.The Chiefs’ consistent red-and-gold design evokes nostalgia and reinforces team identity, standing out in a league increasingly driven by marketing gimmicks and rapid-fire uniform updates.Nike’s “Rivalries” uniform program encourages NFL teams to experiment with throwbacks and alternate styles. Yet the Chiefs remain steadfast, choosing brand stability and global recognition over trend-chasing. This consistency has helped the team cultivate a massive international fanbase, with particularly strong engagement in Germany, the U.K., Brazil, and Australia—proof that legacy can coexist with worldwide appeal.The jersey debate is more than fabric and logos; it reflects the tension between honoring history and meeting evolving fan expectations. Hunt’s repeated “Nah, we’re good” has become a symbol of the franchise’s priorities: identity, legacy, and loyalty outweigh viral hype. As social media buzz grows, the discussion highlights how NFL teams balance heritage with the pressure to innovate in a digital, merchandise-driven era.For now, the Chiefs’ iconic red and gold remains untouchable, and fans will continue debating: should tradition rule, or is it finally time for a bold new look?Also read: Chicago Bears fifth-round rookie Zah Frazier will sit out 2025 season after personal issue emerges","Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt has once again shut down Nike's attempts to redesign the team's iconic jersey.

Giannis Antetokounmpo led a win for Greece against Italy

EuroBasket 2025 is in full swing, with European teams featuring major NBA stars. The likes of Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, and Giannis Antetokounmpo are representing their nations. Greece, led by Giannis, opened its campaign with a victory over Italy, observed by Milwaukee Bucks assistant coach Darvin Ham. During the game, Ham commented on the differences in Giannis Antetokounmpo’s role between the Greek national team and the Bucks He noted that in the NBA, Giannis has a significantly higher usage rate, constantly handling the ball and playing a central, high-energy role, likened to being “Superman.” In contrast, Greece’s style is more team-oriented, relying on structured plays and a slower pace compared to the fast-paced NBA. Ham also commended the two-time NBA MVP for his ability to involve teammates effectively in Greece’s system.Ham, who won the inaugural NBA In-Season Tournament as head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers and later saw the Bucks claim the NBA Cup last season, remains undefeated in the tournament. Ham joined Doc Rivers’ staff last season for his second stint with Milwaukee, and saw Giannis finish third in MVP voting. Despite his regular-season dominance, the Bucks fell short in the playoffs, suffering a disappointing first-round exit against Tyrese Haliburton and the Indiana Pacers.EuroBasket 2025 began on Thursday, with all teams starting their campaigns.

Lexie Hull's recent collision has left her with two black eyes

Will Lexie Hull miss out on Indiana Fever's next game against Los Angeles Sparks ?

On Tuesday, August 26, Indiana Fever shooting guard Lexie Hull and Seattle Storm's Gabby Williams were involved in an on-court collision. The whole thing looked pretty nasty to onlookers, and the Fever star definitely looked like she had suffered an injury. And it was revealed 2 days later, on August 28, when, after a fan asked about her well-being, that she is now sporting 2 very distinct black eyes. Not a good look on her for sure!On August 26, the WNBA teams, Indiana Fever and Seattle Storm, met for a pretty standard game of ball. The Fevers won 95 to 75, with Hull making 5 points, 9 rebounds, and 1 assist in the game, before an on-court collision with Seattle Storm's power forward, Gabby Williams, made her go back to the locker room. The whole thing looked pretty awful, and fans were obviously worried about Hull, and if she was okay.Answering a fan question on TikTok, Hull revealed her face in a video, where she was seen with two prominent black eyes.

Hopefully, the injury more superficial than anything else.The Indiana Fever are all set to face the Los Angeles Sparks on August 29 at the latter's home base. The Fever are the favorites to win the match, even with their star player, Caitlin Clark, missing out after suffering from a right groin injury back in mid-July. And now with Lexie Hull sporting two black eyes, things look even more dicey. But fans aren't confident that the second-to-last team in the WNBA Western Conference will be able to prevail against the Fever.As for Hull, she has not yet been listed on the injury report against the Sparks for their Fever's game on Friday. She even boarded the plane with the rest of her teammates, even if she was still wearing those big sunglasses. The match starts in a few hours, but fans are hoping that Hull will be well enough to be back on the court, even if it's for a little while.Also Read: Ex-NBA player explains what Giannis Antetokounmpo needs to bring in the FIBA EuroBasket","Indiana Fever shooting guard Lexie Hull and Seattle Storm's Gabby Williams were involved in an on-court collision on August 26.

xQc raises Mafiathon 3 stakes with a high-stakes proposal



“Just put in fireworks, like the last time,”

“Arkham City. Boom…”

Michael B. Jordan 's wild dare that was part of Mafiathon 3’s trailer

Mafiathon 3 - (Official Trailer)

Kai Cenat has a history of live-stream explosions



Kai Cenat’s Mafiathon 3 has been in the spotlight since the release of its trailer. While the event’s content cannot be predicted, the one thing that remains certain is that, with the stakes skyrocketing, it’s going to be much bigger than Mafiathon 2. Especially with some of the unexpected challenges and outrageous dares being received, it has made the 30-day event a must-watch.Here is all you need to know about it.In a recent clip circulating online, popular streamer xQc can be seen reacting to the Kai Cenats Mafiathon 3 trailer. Instead of criticism or appreciation, he seemed to have stepped up the game with chaotic advice.xQc did not hold back while he suggested Kai Cenat must commemorate hitting 1 million subscribers by literally blowing up his house.xQc said with a smile, while enthusiastically trying to mimic the sound of a massive explosion.Watching the trailer ahead, he even offered an alternative proposal of organizing a massive giveaway in the middle of the city. He further advised on turning New York City intoThe explosive suggestion coming from him just amplified all the anticipation that surrounds the final subscriber goals of the event.The wild idea coming from xQc is not random. It comes after he watched Michael B. Jordan in Mafiathon 3’s trailer daring Kai Cenat with an unexpected challenge, for going bigger than Mafiathon 2.In the trailer, the Hollywood star dared Cenat to cut his signature hairstyle on reaching 1 million subscribers during a 30-day stream. After some reluctance, Cenat agreed to it, putting his personal style right on the line to commemorate his success.The combination of personal change and property damage has perfectly set the stage for an unforgettable conclusion of the streaming trilogy. It also makes one question whether the dare or the challenge will be fulfilled.While the ideal coming from xQc seems surprising, it’s important to note that this isn’t the first time destruction has been part of the streaming narrative for Kai Cenat. It was just last year when the news spread like fire about how, on July 4, 2024, Cenat’s stream devolved into a fireworks war. The incident involved AMP Davis and, of course, left Cenat’s streaming room in complete ruins. While fans believe it was pre-planned, the memory of the explosive event makes the suggestion of xQc more terrifying and plausible.The precedent that was set by the chaotic celebrations previously confirms that the streamer isn’t a stranger to such explosive challenges and celebrations. It therefore leaves viewers wondering, How far will things go this time? With Mafiathon 3 called the final in the series, there’s already immense pressure on delivering a memorable finale. Only time can tell which advice Cenat accepts and what he ignores.Mafiathon 3 will begin on September 1, 2025.","Kai Cenat’s Mafiathon 3 has been in the spotlight since the release of its trailer.

Scott Morrow demonstrates a diverse set of offensive and defensive skills

NHL Prospects : Scott Morrow - 23-24 Highlights

Morrow has a big opportunity with the New York Rangers in 2025-26

Top 5 New York Rangers Prospects to Watch in 2025-26 | Perreault, Morrow & More!

It’s not just the signing of Vladislav Gavrikov that’s giving New York Rangers’ fans something to look forward to this summer; the stack of seasoned defensemen on the team’s roster is set to witness some major shake-up in the 2025–26 season. While Gavrikov’s acquisition closes the chapter on the big-ticket signings for the offseason, the quiet addition of Scott Morrow in the trade deal that sent K’Andre Miller to the Carolina Hurricanes promises to deliver a lot more in the coming year, and fans certainly have a good reason to celebrate.Now 22, Scott Morrow makes his way to New York with a blend of tussle and established finesse. He is a right-shot defenseman who possesses a solid amalgamation of offense and defense, having made a glance at the sort of impact he can have at the NHL level. His one goal with six points in fourteen games with the Hurricanes last season is the kind of contribution he can make week in, week out.Of course, his hockey IQ, physicality, and play-driving for the Chicago Wolves in the American Hockey League are all reinforced by his 39 points and 13 goals in 52 games. He is able to generate offense from the back end, move the puck, and handle heavy minutes with his excellent play, all of which have been missing among the Rangers' defensemen.With active injuries in the Rangers blueliner core, Morrow is a must-have.This year will most certainly define Morrow's NHL trajectory. New York is striving to create equilibrium in the blueline between experience and youth, so Morrow would have the chance to earn a steady position. His offensive output from the point, coupled with continued improvement on the defensive end, positions him as a player who can develop into a reliable top-four option.To Rangers enthusiasts, this trade can very well turn out to be one of the key summer moves. If Morrow adjusts well to his new surroundings, his development will provide New York with additional energy on the blue line.Also Read: Macklin Celebrini earns his place in Canada’s Olympic conversation While Scott Morrow’s name doesn’t have the same recognition as some others signed in the offseason, his potential and what he has shown on the ice imply that he is likely to turn into a long-term asset for the Rangers.","Scott Morrow is a right-shot defenseman who possesses a solid amalgamation of offense and defense.

The August 29 edition of WWE Friday Night SmackDown was the last regular show of the promotion before the upcoming PPV in France - Clash in Paris. The event was held at the LDLC Arena in Lyon, France, and featured quite a few exciting fights before the big show on August 31.From appearances by John Cena , Cody Rhodes, Tiffany Stratton, and Randy Orton, to high-stakes matches like the United States Title match between Solo Sikoa and Sami Zayn to Charlotte Flair & Alexa Bliss facing off the Secret Hervice (Piper Niven and Alba Fyre) for the WWE Women’s Tag Team titles, the night was filled with action. Let's take a look at everything that went down.The night started with a face-off between John Cena and Logan Paul , who have a match set for Clash in Paris. Paul begins by trying to hype himself up to the audience, who, of course, go about booing him from start to finish. He also talks smack about Cena, but before he can continue, Cena himself shows up to interrupt his tirade. The crowd, of course, is thrilled to have the Cenation Leader there, chanting his name and giving him standing ovations.Cena tells Paul that without the fans, he is nothing, and calls him a wannabe who understands nothing about the business. After a little more back and forth, John Cena leaves the ring while talking about respect. He then sees the boy he had called ""toxic"" during his heel run and apologizes to him with a sorry and a thank you before leaving.The first match of the night is the WWE Women’s Tag Team title match between Charlotte Flair & Alexa Bliss vs Secret Hervice. Bliss and Flair are blindsided by Alba Fyre while walking up to the ramp, who injures Flair before the match can even begin. Security takes her away, and the fans are told that the match has now been changed to a singles match between Alexa Bliss and Chelsea Green.The match started off with both women on equal footing, but soon Green took control. They both tried to use their finishers to end the match in their favour, but the other always seemed to kick out before the three-count. Even with Fyre interfering multiple times, in the end, Bliss managed to roll Green for the win.But after the match, it turned into a numbers game when Green and Fyre ganged up on Bliss to take her out. An injured Flair runs in to save her partner, and though it looked like she had things in control, the Secret Hervice had the two beat to stand tall in the end.Michin makes her entrance into the ring before Kiana James shows up, flanked by Giulia - the Women’s U.S. Champion. One of the shortest matches ever, it ended in less than 10 seconds. James tried to hit Michin with her purse, but Michin managed to sidestep and rolled her up for a pin and win.Giulia then attacked Michin after the match and drove the latter's face into the steps.Drew McIntyre makes his way to the ring to talk about the RKO from Randy Orton that took him out last week. He asked Michael Cole if there was any update on Cody Rhodes , who replied in the negative. He then called out Orton, who emerged to the fans singing his name.They have a little back and forth, before McIntyre drops a Glasgow Kiss headbutt on Orton. He tries to go for a Claymore Kick, but Orton dodges it and hits McIntyre with a Draping DDT, followed by a Viper's Pose. The officials soon run in to stop Orton from doing more damage and McIntyre is seen rolling out of the ring and walking away.Backstage, Bo Dallas interrupts Melo Don't Miz while the tag team partners are seen warming up for their upcoming match. The three have a little exchange before Dallas walks away, and Melo is seen doing a fist bump with Miz.We also have a short stint involving SmackDown General Manager Nick Aldis who admonished Orton for attacking the security guards. He gives Orton a bottle of Fireball whiskey, but he leaves without it. R-Truth then makes his entrance and asks Aldis if he is going to drink that, to which Aldis says that, after the day he's had, he just might.With both tag teams coming from a win, this match promised an exciting premise. The Street Profits beat MFT's JC Mateo and Tonga Loa with a little help from Sami Zayn and Jimmy Uso, while the Melo Don’t Miz duo beat Fraxiom. Now they face each other for the #1 Contenders match for the WWE Tag Titles, with TSP making their entrance alongside B-Fab, followed by Melo Don't Miz.It's a pretty evenly matched fight, with both tag teams having good and some not-so-good moments. Montez Ford hit The Miz with a top rope frog splash followed by Carmelo Hayes hitting Ford with a top rope splash. But things take a turn when The Wyatt Sicks make an entrance, distracting Miz. Angelo Dawkins runs over Miz and throws him off the apron, before the duo hit The Revelation on Hayes, leading to Dawkins getting the pin on Melo.The United States Championship title has been challenged once more, and Solo Sikoa came down to face Sami Zayn to retain his title belt. The final match of the night is here, with Zayn and Sikoa making their way into the ring. It's a numbers game from the beginning, and the MFTs try to interfere multiple times. Sikoa hits a Spinning Solo on Zayn for a near fall, but then Jimmy Uso shows up. The MFTs are there to stop him, but then Jacob Fatu comes in to take Talla Tonga.Zayn in the meantime, hit Sikoa with a Blue Thunder Bomb for a near fall, while the latter was distracted with all the chaos around him. The MFTs are busy fighting Uso and Fatu, and Zayn takes the chance to once again go after Sikoa, this time without any hindrance on his way. Though Sijoa sidesteps a Helluva Kick, he could not escape a Spinning Solo on the broadcast table. At the end, Zayn hit a couple of Helluva Kicks to take the win and become the new United States Champion.Also Read: “He’s an absolute maniac!”: Former WWE writer alleges Vince McMahon’s sexual misconduct with Ashley Massaro","The August 29 edition of WWE Friday Night SmackDown was the last regular show of the promotion before the upcoming PPV in France - Clash in Paris.

Kevin Owens reacts to Sami Zayn’s U.S. Title win against Solo Sikoa



When is Kevin Owens expected to return to WWE ?



Sami Zayn walked into SmackDown on August 29 with everything to gain and walked out as the new United States Champion. The Quebec native dethroned Solo Sikoa in a main event full of chaos and a raucous Lyon crowd. But while Triple H hailed Zayn as “one of the best,” longtime friend and rival Kevin Owens chimed in with a playful message.The new champion’s night was already unforgettable when Triple H shared a backstage photo with Zayn, posting: “An incredibly gutsy performance by one of the best. For the first time, @SamiZayn is your United States Champion.” Kevin Owens took to his X to react to his tag partner-turned-rival-turned-friend.“One of the best indeed… Top 1, in my opinion. I still hate him though. Or maybe not. I don’t know, it’s hard to remember. Depends on the day, I guess. We’ll see what happens. One thing I do know for sure is that he’s the best,” Owens wrote on X.Zayn’s win itself was earned the hard way. He cut a promo in fluent French to fire up the Lyon crowd before stepping into the ring with Sikoa. What followed was a brutal test of survival. The MFT attempted to tip the scales, but Jimmy Uso and Jacob Fatu stormed the scene to even the odds.With interference neutralized, Zayn endured two Spinning Solos, a splash from the top rope, and a relentless onslaught before countering a Samoan Spike into an exploder suplex. Two Helluva Kicks later, the pinfall was sealed.The victory ended Sikoa’s 62-day reign and gave Zayn his first run with the United States Title.Owens’ reaction has fueled speculation about when he might reunite, or clash again, with Zayn. The former Universal Champion has been sidelined since April following a neck injury that required fusion surgery. Speaking recently at the NASCAR Coke Zero Sugar 400 in Daytona, Owens offered an honest update.“I needed neck fusion. It was very stressful going into it, because we weren't really sure how severe the fusion was going to be,” Owens explained. “Thankfully, it ended up only being one level, which is the best-case scenario for something like this. But the surgery was successful. I had a great doctor.”The 41-year-old admitted the timeline remains uncertain. “The thing is, now, we have to see how the bones fuse, and there's no guarantee that it's gonna work. Some guys had success, some guys didn't. Fingers crossed, I get to come back to wrestling in the next year.”Also Read: Nick Hogan reveals Hulk Hogan will be honored in a video tribute at inaugural Real American Freestyle wrestling event Owens last wrestled in an unsanctioned match against Zayn at Elimination Chamber.

Antonio Brown questions silence from liberals after Trump shooting



“When Donald Trump was shot, not a single liberal called for banning guns. Weird,”

“You cooked with this one.”

“Facts spoken. How someone with CTE has more sense than half the country?”

Antonio Brown is back in the headlines, and this time it’s not about football or his wild off-field antics. The former NFL star has inserted himself into one of the biggest political conversations of the year, Donald Trump ’s shooting. Brown fired off a one-liner on X that instantly stirred the pot, calling out liberals for not pushing gun bans in the aftermath. The post has since gone viral, with fans and critics piling in to debate whether AB just made a bold point or simply tossed more fuel onto the culture war fire.AB’s post was short but sharp.he wrote.Normally, after mass shootings or public attacks, gun control becomes a front-and-center topic in political debates. But Brown argued that when Trump was the target, the conversation around banning guns was nowhere to be found.Like most things Brown posts, the reaction was messy. Supporters praised him for pointing out what they see as hypocrisy, agreeing that liberals pick and choose when to talk about gun violence.One user replied,Another said,Gun control has long been one of the most polarizing issues in American politics. Every time a mass shooting takes place, debates reignite over whether stricter laws should be passed.Brown’s post highlighted the unusual absence of that push after Trump’s shooting, a fact that struck some as telling and others as irrelevant.What makes AB’s voice stand out here is his ability to cut through the noise with just a few words. He’s no stranger to controversial statements, and he often seems to enjoy the firestorm that follows. This post wasn’t just about Trump or guns, it was AB once again proving he knows how to dominate timelines without even stepping on a field. At the end of the day, whether you see his comment as a sharp observation or just trolling, one thing’s clear, Antonio Brown knows exactly how to keep the internet talking.Also read - “Trapped you with a baby”: Fans react to Travis Hunter becoming a dad before rookie debut","Antonio Brown questions silence from liberals after Trump shooting.

Micah Parsons’ number choice expected to drive huge fan merchandise rush

Micah Parsons has already made headlines with his move to the Green Bay Packers, but the next talking point is more symbolic. The All-Pro linebacker, traded from the Dallas Cowboys in a blockbuster deal, now has to make a jersey number choice that has quickly become a hot topic among fans.Parsons’ association with No. 11 runs deep. He wore it at Penn State and carried it into the NFL with the Cowboys, becoming one of the league’s most feared defenders. But in Green Bay, that number is occupied by wide receiver Jayden Reed, forcing Parsons to explore new territory.On Friday, the 25-year-old hinted at his decision on Twitter, revealing that he has narrowed his choices down to No. 0 or No. 1. Both digits stand out and carry their own identity.The No. 0 projects dominance, a statement number for a defender who thrives on intimidating offensive lines. The No. 1, meanwhile, offers a sleeker look, echoing his traditional 11 in a stripped-down form while symbolizing confidence and leadership.For Packers fans, Parsons’ choice is more than cosmetic. Jersey sales are expected to soar regardless of the number, with Green Bay supporters eager to wear their new star’s kit.The commercial side of such decisions has grown significantly in recent years, and Parsons’ selection could easily become one of the top-selling jerseys this season.Just a few years ago, defenders were restricted from donning single-digit numbers.

“33-3 vs.

Why Tom Brady’s jab cut so deep for Bills fans



“Lmfao! That's goat shit right there. Haha.”

“Not funny”

“Tom left the Pats and retired because the BIlls got good”

Tom Brady might be retired, but his rivalry with the Buffalo Bills clearly isn’t. In a new viral video, the legendary quarterback put pen to paper on Josh Allen’s Rivalries jersey and then dropped a savage little reminder of his dominance over Buffalo. Tom Brady didn’t just sign the jersey, he added the stat line that haunted the Bills for nearly two decades. Fans instantly lit up social media, laughing at Brady’s petty humor while Bills Mafia fumed that he’s still trolling them years after leaving the AFC East.The clip comes from Fanatics’ new “Rivalries” collection, where current stars like Josh Allen get jerseys designed around their fiercest opponents. When Brady got his hands on Allen’s No. 17, he praised the icy chrome sleeve look, calling it “top tier.” But the real moment came when he autographed the jersey and cheekily scribbledThat number wasn’t random. It represents Brady’s career record against Buffalo, one of the most lopsided quarterback-team matchups in NFL history. For nearly 20 years, Bills fans dreaded every meeting with Brady and the Patriots, and he made sure nobody forgets it.For context, Brady went 32-3 in regular season games against Buffalo, plus another win in 2016 when he was suspended and Jimmy Garoppolo started hence the “33-3” flex.It’s a stat that perfectly sums up how one-sided the Patriots-Bills rivalry was during Brady’s era.Even though Josh Allen has since flipped the script and led the Bills to dominance over New England, Brady’s reminder hits where it hurts, history can’t be rewritten.The internet exploded once the video dropped. Patriots fans loved the flex, with one posting,Bills Mafia, on the other hand, didn’t take it lightly. One fan wrote,while another fired back,This playful jersey moment proves one thing, Tom Brady might be done playing, but his rivalry with the Bills isn’t going anywhere. He’s still finding ways to remind Buffalo fans that no matter how good Josh Allen gets, Brady’s shadow looms large.Also read - Donald Trump shooting sparks Antonio Brown’s viral dig at liberal gun control","Tom Brady signed Josh Allen’s Bills rivalry jersey with savage “33-3 vs. Bills!” flex.

Oh boy, Nebraska Football just learned the hard way that Swifties don’t play. After a big win over Cincinnati, the Huskers’ social media account tried to get playful and it totally backfired. They posted a photoshopped image of their mascot, Herbie Husker, about to kiss Taylor Swift , replacing none other than Travis Kelce . The internet immediately lost it, and Swifties were NOT having it. Within hours, the post was deleted amid serious backlash.The Huskers’ official X (formerly Twitter) account captioned the image simply,seemingly poking fun at Kelce. The timing? Right after Nebraska’s 20–17 victory at Arrowhead Stadium. The image replaced Kelce with Herbie Husker in their engagement photo with Taylor Swift.While the intent was probably lighthearted rivalry humor, fans quickly found it disrespectful and weird. One quick scroll through the comments section, and you could see the firestorm brewing.Swifties were NOT impressed. Across social media, fans called the post “disgusting,” “inconsiderate,” and downright “creepy.”Many demanded the social media manager responsible be fired.Hashtags and angry comments spread fast, turning a playful jab into a full-blown social media crisis. It was clear, Swifties protect their queen and no mascot drama was going to slide under the radar.By the next morning, the post had vanished. Nebraska athletics acknowledged the misstep, admitting that the post distracted from the team’s victory and confirming its removal. So far, there’s no word on any disciplinary action against the social media manager, but the lesson is clear, never mess with Taylor Swift fans online.Meanwhile, Kelce and Swift made their first public appearance since announcing their engagement. Swift rocked a crisp white outfit, while Kelce kept it casual with a red-and-white Cincinnati cap. The couple seemed happy and relaxed, celebrating their engagement without rushing into wedding plans. Fans were quick to compare the real-life sweetness to the viral “Herbie Husker” incident, clearly showing who came out on top in this saga.What started as a playful social media joke turned into a full-blown lesson in fan power. Nebraska Football may have deleted the post, but the story proves one thing, never underestimate the Swifties. When celebrity, sports, and social media collide, things can get messy and viral, fast.Also read - Tom Brady mocks Bills fans by signing Josh Allen jersey with brutal ‘33-3 vs. Bills’ flex","Nebraska Football posted a photoshopped image of their mascot, Herbie Husker, about to kiss Taylor Swift, replacing none other than Travis Kelce.

Poll Do you think KL Rahul should be included in the national T20I squad again? Yes No

Former India cricketer and IPL legend Suresh Raina has thrown his support behind KL Rahul , backing the Delhi Capitals captain to return to the national T20I fold despite his exclusion from the 2025 Asia Cup squad.Speaking on Shubhankar Mishra’s YouTube podcast, Raina praised Rahul ’s quality and temperament. “He scored the runs. See, KL Rahul has a temperament. People think T20 is a very fast game where you only need to hit shots, but the class, temperament, and game awareness he possesses don’t come overnight. He has worked a lot, so I think he will come back,” Raina said.Rahul enjoyed a strong IPL 2025 season, amassing 539 runs in 13 innings at a strike rate of 149.72, including one century and three fifties. During the campaign, he also crossed the landmark of 5,000 IPL runs, with his tally now standing at 5,222 runs from 145 matches.In T20 internationals, Rahul has scored 2,265 runs in 72 matches at a strike rate of 139.12, including two centuries and 22 half-centuries. However, his last appearance in the format came in the 2022 T20 World Cup semi-final against England.Raina also addressed ongoing speculation about the future of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli in ODI cricket. Reports have suggested the two senior batters could be phased out before the 2027 World Cup, but Raina firmly disagreed. “Rohit & Kohli should play the 2027 ODI World Cup because they have won the T20 WC and the Champions Trophy. Both Rohit and Virat have so much experience. I feel they will be there in the 2027 World Cup; they should be there,” he said.","Former India cricketer Suresh Raina has backed KL Rahul to return to the national T20I fold.

'I don’t understand Prince Harry’s anger': Butler challenges ‘evil stepmother’ Queen Camilla story — What really happened,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/i-dont-understand-prince-harrys-anger-butler-challenges-evil-stepmother-queen-camilla-story-what-really-happened/articleshow/123525991.cms,"Harry’s Private Note To Late Grandfather Prince Philip Sparks Backlash Online

The simmering tension between Prince Harry and Queen Camilla, long splashed across tabloids, has been reignited, but this time by someone unexpectedly in the middle of royal history. Former royal butler Grant Harrold, who served the monarchy for decades, is challenging the Duke of Sussex’s stark portrayal of his stepmother in his memoir Spare.In the explosive book, Harry branded Camilla “evil” and “wicked,” accusing her of tearing apart the family he cherished with Princess Diana. Yet Harrold’s recollections paint a different picture, one of warmth, laughter, and shared family moments.In his upcoming biography, The Royal Butler: My Remarkable Life of Royal Service, Harrold recounts the day Charles and Camilla wed in April 2005. “Charles and Camilla were catching a flight to head straight to Birkhall. We all went outside to wave them off and laughed as we saw William and Harry had decorated their car with ‘Just Married,’” he writes. He added that the brothers “raced after the car” as the couple drove off “through the arches to cheers,” a scene far removed from the cold animosity Harry described.Harrold insists he witnessed “no animosity” between Harry and Camilla. “The four of them, I promise you, got on so well. I saw them having dinners together, I saw them having drinks together, I saw them going to parties together,” he recalled.He also praised King Charles for his calm demeanor, noting, “He works hard and doesn’t suffer fools… he doesn’t once raise his voice.”A royal insider corroborated Harrold’s account, telling GB News that Harry seemed genuinely happy during the wedding celebrations and even took the lead in decorating his father’s Aston Martin. “I am sure there were mixed emotions over the years, but all I can tell you is how he seemed at the time,” the source said.Yet Harry’s memoir paints a more bitter picture. He claimed Camilla was “dangerous,” accused her of leaking details of his past drug use, and even compared her to the “wicked stepmothers in storybooks.” The stark contrast between Harry’s narrative and those who witnessed the events firsthand has sparked a debate over truth, perception, and memory within the royal family.As Harrold prepares to release his biography, royal watchers are left wondering: did Harry’s version of events obscure a more nuanced reality, or was it a reflection of long-held personal pain?","Former royal butler Grant Harrold is challenging Prince Harry's portrayal of his stepmother in his memoir Spare.

From feud to a possible reunion: Is a royal homecoming for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle with children on the cards? Royal experts spill the beans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/from-feud-to-a-possible-reunion-is-a-royal-homecoming-for-harry-and-meghan-with-children-on-the-cards-royal-experts-spill-the-beans/articleshow/123503589.cms,"Harry Reaches Out? Prince Invites King Charles Amid Hopes Of Reunion

For years, the rift between the royal family and the Sussexes has been the stuff of palace whispers, glossy magazine covers, and endless “sources close to” speculation. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have built a life on the other side of the Atlantic - swapping Buckingham Palace for Montecito mansions, royal duties for media deals, and the London fog for Californian sunshine. But is there a chance the family feud could finally ease? Some royal watchers say the door might just be creaking open.Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital that trust remains the sticking point. “I believe it to be totally correct that members of the royal family do not trust Meghan. And of course, she does not trust some members of the royal family in return,” he said.Still, Turner hinted that the narrative isn’t as black-and-white as it seems. “If every member of the royal family doesn’t trust Meghan, then why did King Charles instigate a meeting with his senior advisor and that of Harry and Meghan’s team? Is it all the royal family, or is it perhaps William?”Optimism, however, lingers. Turner hopes Harry, Meghan, and their children—Archie and Lilibet—will eventually be welcomed back “warmly” into the fold. Fellow commentator Ingrid Seward echoed the sentiment, telling Fox News Digital, “I feel that [this] won’t go on forever. I just feel that at some stage… they will begin to come together.”That said, Seward was quick to admit that Meghan remains deeply unpopular with hardcore royalists.The speculation is being fueled further by Harry’s scheduled trip to the UK in September. According to PEOPLE!, he’s set to appear at a charity event for WellChild, which supports children with life-limiting conditions.Whether this visit sparks a reunion with King Charles remains to be seen, but it has reignited questions about the Sussexes’ long-term ties to Britain.One factor pulling them back could be education.Former royal butler Grant Harrold told Style Caster that Harry may want Archie and Lilibet to experience the same schooling system he grew up with. “It’s very likely and it’s completely possible… But then it depends on how the relationship is with the rest of the family when the time comes.”But here’s the royal-sized hurdle: security. In ITV’s Tabloids on Trial, Harry admitted that safety concerns are the main reason Meghan avoids the UK. “They are genuine concerns for me… It's one of the reasons why I won’t bring my wife back to this country,” he said.A source close to him doubled down in Us Weekly: “He’ll always be fond of his home country, but the way he views it, his wife and kids are his priority.”","Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner says trust remains the sticking point.

Prince William & Kate Middleton's ‘Forever Home’ Dream Leaves Neighbours Homeless





Princess Anne turned 75 on August 15. To mark the day, the Prince and Princess of Wales posted a short birthday wish and shared her newly released portrait of the Princess Royal. Their message read, “Wishing Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal a very Happy 75th Birthday!”The image is part of a set released for the milestone. Shot at Gatcombe Park by John Swannell, the portrait keeps the tone formal and restrained—very Anne. Swannell has photographed her across multiple milestone birthdays, a continuity that suits the Princess Royal’s preference for understatement.There was also an earlier portrait released the week before: a two-shot of Anne with Sir Tim Laurence , taken at Windsor Castle by Chris Jackson ahead of July’s French state banquet. That image drew attention to a sleeker, pulled-back hairstyle, a look Anne also wore at the banquet with her longtime Festoon Tiara.The post from William and Kate landed during the family’s summer break, but the message stayed classic: a clear portrait, a brief line, and no long caption. It matches Anne’s public style and allows the picture to do the talking.As ever, the focus around her birthday was service. Anne is widely cited as one of the monarchy’s hardest-working royals, and official birthday coverage emphasized her decades of engagements and patronages.Family figured in the week’s imagery, too. The Windsor channels highlighted Anne and Sir Tim’s quiet partnership, as well as archival moments from her life—reminders of a career defined by duty, sport and charity more than spectacle.Why does a single post matter? It shows how the Wales household and the Princess Royal present milestones now: warm but minimal, with the visuals carrying the sentiment. For Anne, the emphasis stays on the work rather than the social-media flourish.As the summer break continues, the family is expected to spend time together in Scotland, with no indication of a large public event for the occasion. For the Princess Royal, a steady calendar and a modest celebration remain the norm—and the Waleses’ short message matched that mood.The takeaway: a milestone birthday, a clean portrait, and a brief wish from nephew and niece-in-law—small gestures that say plenty about how Princess Anne works, and how the royal family marks personal events today.","Princess Anne turned 75 on August 15.

Zara Tindall spent the weekend competing at the NAF Five Star International Hartpury Horse Trials in Gloucestershire. Beside the warm-up ring, her 11-year-old daughter Mia watched closely, smiled for photos, and reached up to stroke one of Zara’s horses. The small moments told their own story. Mia looks at home around the stables.Zara rode two familiar partners at Hartpury. She brought Showtime, known in the yard as “Cracker,” and Class Affair, nicknamed “Socks.” Between rounds, Mia stayed close, chatting with her mum and keeping an eye on the action. It was a simple family scene at a busy event.The outing fits a long family pattern. Zara is an Olympian who has spent most of her life around eventing. Her mother, Princess Anne, was the first royal to compete at the Olympics. Her late grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, was a lifelong horsewoman. Seeing Mia comfortable in that world feels natural, and it hints at a next chapter for the Tindalls’ eldest child.Crowd shots from Hartpury showed Mia following each phase and cheering from the ropes. She watched showjumping from close enough to see take-off strides and leaned forward during cross-country updates.Nothing about it felt forced. It looked like a child enjoying her mum’s sport.The event itself is a regular stop for Zara. It draws strong fields across levels and gives riders a good mid-season test. This year she balanced competition with being present for her daughter, and the cameras picked up that easy rhythm. A rider’s focus can be intense on show days. Zara still made space for quick smiles with Mia before heading back to the horsebox.There was also a small stable-side detail that fans loved. Mia reached up to pat Showtime and grinned as the horse flicked an ear toward her. Little gestures like that say more than any speech about where a child’s interests might lead. No one is mapping out her future, but comfort around horses often starts with moments like this.Zara has said before that all three of her children have been on a pony. That early exposure shows. Mia moved around the yard with confidence, giving the horses space when needed and stepping back when grooms asked. It is the kind of quiet horsemanship children pick up by being around good yards.Mother and daughter also offered a simple picture of support. When Zara finished a round, Mia was there. When the next phase approached, Mia made way so the team could work. For families who live the show circuit, that balance is familiar. It is how many young riders begin, watching first, riding later.The photos from Hartpury will add to Mia’s growing gallery of equestrian days out. For now, it is enough to see interest and joy. If she chooses to ride more in public, she will have a mother who understands the sport at the highest level and a family who know how to blend normal life with busy weekends on the road.Hartpury offered a gentle reminder of what this family values. Horses, routine, and time together. One weekend, two good horses, and a child who could not stop watching. That was the story from the rails, and it was easy to read.","Zara Tindall spent the weekend competing at the NAF Five Star International Hartpury Horse Trials in Gloucestershire.

Princess Anne is celebrating her 75th birthday with a fresh look and her signature sparkle. A new portrait released ahead of the milestone shows the Princess Royal standing alongside her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence. The photograph was taken before the French state banquet at Windsor Castle in July.The first thing people will notice is her hair. Anne has worn a similar bouffant style for about five decades. In this portrait she switches to a smooth chignon. It is elegant, neat, and suits the formal setting. The change is rare for her, which is why the photo drew quick attention.Tiara is the second talking point in this portrait. Anne chose the Festoon Tiara, a long-time favorite in her rotation. She received it as a gift in 1973 after christening a ship for the Worldwide Shipping Group. The design sits low and balanced, which works well with the new hair. Together they create a cleaner frame around her face.The portrait also doubles as a quiet nod to partnership. Sir Tim stands with her, as he often does at major state events. The two married in 1992 and keep a low profile. Their presence together in the birthday image sets a warm tone as family plans take shape for the coming weeks.There is context behind the timing. The palace shared the photo one week before her August 15 birthday to start the celebrations. It was shot by royal photographer Chris Jackson. He captured it at Windsor before the banquet held for the French state visit from July 8 to 10. The result is formal but relaxed, a look that fits Anne’s usual style.Fashion notes aside, the image also lands after a busy and challenging year. Anne remains one of the most active working royals by engagement count. Last year she briefly stepped back after a horse-related incident near her home. She returned to duties and later said the experience was a reminder that each day is a bonus. The new portrait, bright and composed, underlines that message without a single word.Reactions so far focus on two themes. Many like seeing a small style reset that still feels like Anne. Others appreciate the continuity of the Festoon Tiara, a piece linked to her early twenties and worn across decades. It is a simple mix of new and old. That balance is what people expect from her.As the birthday week begins, more pictures and appearances are likely. For now, one frame does the job. New hair. A classic tiara. Her husband at her side. It is a quiet portrait that still says a lot about how Anne works, dresses, and shows up for the role she has held for most of her life.","Princess Anne is celebrating her 75th birthday with a fresh look and her signature sparkle.

"Should Keir Starmer remove Prince Andrew's titles? New Book lifts lid on York family, rekindles debate over royal position",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/should-keir-starmer-remove-prince-andrews-titles-new-book-lifts-lid-on-york-family-rekindles-debate-over-royal-position/articleshow/123183535.cms,"



The question of whether Prince Andrew should be stripped of his titles has resurfaced ahead of the publication of Andrew Lownie's new biography.The book, entitled The Rise and Fall of the House of York, has been exclusively serialised by the Daily Mail following four years of research and hundreds of interviews. Lownie revealed a series of the York family's secrets, ranging from Prince Andrew's unusual sexual habits to Sarah Ferguson's association with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.""There is very little that the Royal Family can actually do when it comes to Prince Andrew,"" said Daily Mail's Editor-at-Large Richard Kay on the latest episode of ""Palace Confidential.""""He's been effectively sacked. He's the only royal prince who has been sacked from public life that I can think of. ""Short of sending him far, far away - and who would want him? - I think it's very insulting when I keep reading suggestions of sending him to the Falkland Islands. Do the people there particularly want Prince Andrew? I doubt it very much.""So it's difficult to know what to do with him. He's just going to be there. They have managed it fairly well. He doesn't have any kind of public role. ""What about stripping him of everything? Well, he was born a prince, and he was given a dukedom.""The one thing they could possibly do would be to remove the dukedom, but I think it would have to come through parliament, and I can't see any government of any shade wanting to get involved in anything like this. It would open up a real can of worms.""So far, just six per cent of readers have responded 'no' to the question. Richard stars on the hit YouTube panel show alongside Daily Mail's Diary Editor Richard Eden and Royal Editor Rebecca English.Rebecca, who has covered the royal beat for the Daily Mail since 2004, added: ""It's a hugely tricky one for them because he is there and he exists. They can't airbrush him out - he is a member of their family."" In an exclusive interview in the latest edition of the Daily Mail's royal newsletter, ""Palace Confidential"", Lownie stated he contacted over 3,000 former school contemporaries, staff, colleagues, and associates of the couple. ""Of whom 300 spoke to me,"" Lownie said.""Some on the record, but most off. ""They felt it was time to challenge the York family’s carefully curated narrative. It is difficult because there tends to be a code of silence about the royals (no one wants to be cast out of the privileged circle).""Additionally, their staff have to sign NDAs, royals are not fully subject to the Freedom of Information Act and there are strict limits on what questions MPs can ask about them in Parliament. ""I could also add the letters I received threatening to sue me, before a word of the manuscript had been seen. Charming people.""In the ""Palace Confidential"" episode, Richard Kay pointed out that within the Royal Family, there is an instinct to ""circle the wagons and protect one of their own"".He added: ""Their first response in all these cases is 'Oh, it's just the press, it's the media.' This is different. This is a graphic book written by a figure who has some substance in the writing he has done. ""You can't just brush this away."" Having covered the royal beat for more than 20 years, Richard Eden shared his views on whether Andrew should be stripped of his titles.He said: ""Certainly, what the King could do, and something that I have advocated for a long while, is strip him of his role as a Counsellor of State. ""He and Prince Harry still have the legal right to deputise for the King. That could easily be stripped from them, as well as his title of Duke of York or other things if they wanted to.""He is still in the line of succession. Yes, it would take an Act of Parliament, but that's no big deal. ""The King did it recently when he extended the list of Counsellors of State to include Princess Anne and Prince Edward. It could be done very easily indeed.""That's something which I would strongly suggest he does."" Elsewhere in the episode, the panel discussed the possibility of Prince William taking ""decisive action"" regarding aspects of the monarchy in the coming years.","Andrew Lownie's new biography, The Rise and Fall of the House of York, has been exclusively serialised by the Daily Mail.

Marching in the name of legacy: Sikh regiment debate rekindled in Britain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/marching-in-the-name-of-legacy-sikh-regiment-debate-rekindled-in-britain/articleshow/123097673.cms,"Marching in the name of legacy: Sikh regiment debate rekindled in Britain





The debate over whether there should be a Sikh Regiment in the British Armed Forces has resurfaced but the ministry of defence (MOD) insists there are no such plans.The debate was triggered after Lord Sahota asked defence minister Lord Coaker in the House of Lords on 7 July whether there was any progress of having a Sikh regiment in the British Army, given the loyalty of Sikh soldiers in both world wars. Coaker replied, “Let me consider that request from my noble friend. I am quite happy to meet him to see what more we can do to recognise the contribution of soldiers such as Sikhs.” This led to UK headlines such as ‘Minister open to British Army Sikh regiment proposal.’But MOD sources told TOI, “Over the years, there have been conversations about this, but it would breach Britain’s anti-discriminatory laws. There are no current plans for a Sikh regiment as it goes against the Equality Act. We want to do something to recognise Sikh contributions in some way, but not through a Sikh regiment.”Lord Sahota, whose grandfathers served in the British Indian army, including the 15Punjab Regiment, told TOI: “I don’t think it would go against the Equality Act.”He pointed out the British Army has had the Staffordshire regiment and currently has the Brigade of Gurkhas, the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, the Royal Welsh and Royal Regiment of Scotland and so on.“It doesn’t mean other faiths like Hindus, Muslims or Christians wouldn’t be able to serve in a Sikh Regiment. If you are in the Royal Regiment of Scotland, it doesn’t mean you have to be Scottish.”.“We are struggling to recruit ethnic minorities in this country,” he said, and so having a Sikh Regiment would give Sikhs a “reason to join.” “They would wear turbans and have beards and it would reflect Sikh heritage and values,” he said.“It would foster a better relationship with other countries such as India and South Asia as well,” he added.There are estimated to be only 200 Sikhs in the British Armed Forces currently.“People tend to go into the army if their grandfather was in it. Sikhs don’t have that role model here,” Sahota said. He said if there was a Punjab or Sikh Regiment, they would have that role model. “There are more than 700k Sikhs in the UK. I am sure quite a few would be prepared to follow in their great grandfather’s footsteps. King Charles even told a Sikh soldier he wanted to see more Sikhs in the British Army,” the Labour life peer added.India-born Sahota (74) said he plans to meet Lord Coaker after the summer recess and will take Sikhs in the British Army and MPs with him.Preet Kaur Gill MP, who has met the armed forces minister many times, to raise the issue, said: “The ministers are looking at doing something. No decision has been made. It is being looked at. There have been existing Sikh regiments in the army. It’s not anything new.”The modern Indian army has a Sikh Regiment, which continues to recruit from the Sikh community and a Punjab Regiment. The Sikh regiment is one of the most decorated regiments and traces its origins to the first Sikh battalion raised by the East India Company in 1846.But veteran army reservist Captain Jay Singh-Sohal OBE is against the idea.“Even if they did this they wouldn’t fill out a regiment with recruits - we struggle with getting young Sikhs into the military as it is. A Sikh regiment isn’t going to change this and would become massively understaffed. A single battalion regiment requires 700 plus. A Sikh regiment will fail as it won’t get 700 plus young Sikhs joining. And if the answer is to look beyond Sikhs then what’s the point of a race specific regiment?” he said.“These British Sikh politicians need to make the argument for the benefit of Sikh specific regiments in the context of the threats we face today,” Sohal added. “It’s not about harking to past glories but about practical ways in which Sikhs today can make an impact through military service. I believe Sikhs do make an impact as we serve alongside those who represent Great Britain as a whole,” Johal said.“The Sikh identity is already recognised as a strength in the British Army and protected by UK law. We don’t need special treatment. We already practice our faith in the army. A modern army is about bringing capabilities and insights from different walks of life and backgrounds to create a synergy into a whole team setting. Sikhs can contribute a lot to that. Having a Sikh specific regiment won’t motivate more youngsters to join. What would, is if they see value in soldiering or developing themselves as a leader through military experience. I challenge Preet Gill and Lord Sahota to find me 20 Sikhs willing to sign up to the British Army right now, regardless of whether we have a Sikh regiment or not. They won’t be able to do it.”Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi MP, chair of the defence committee, which scrutinises the work of the MOD, said: “Given the extraordinary history, martial traditions and sacrifices of Sikh soldiers, especially during both world wars, I have supported the establishment of a British Sikh Regiment for several years, including meetings with ministers and other activists.""""While the campaign has not achieved success thus far, we will certainly continue to make the case"", Dhesi added."," debate over whether there should be a Sikh Regiment in the British Armed Forces has resurfaced. Lord Sahota asked defence minister Lord Coaker in the House of Lords on 7 July whether there was any progress of having a Sikh regiment. MOD sources told TOI, “Over the years, there have been conversations about this, but it would breach Britain’s anti-discriminatory laws”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123097660,width-400,resizemode-4/123097660.jpg"
