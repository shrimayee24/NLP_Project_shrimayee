The number of hundreds he has scored in the second innings, chasing down scores is ridiculous.""Anderson pointed out that Virat's strong sense of self-belief contributes to his excellent chasing skills, as per ANI.""It is no surprise that when he gets in that situation, with his mentality, it is just like it is meant to be.

I was thinking more in terms of just chasing.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan cricket is facing severe backlash following their historic defeat against Bangladesh on Sunday, marking their first-ever Test loss to Bangladesh in 14 matches. The disappointment and frustration among fans and experts have shifted from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and team management to captain Shan Masood , whose leadership is now under scrutiny.Pakistan cricketer Ahmad Shehzad did not hold back in his criticism of Masood, openly questioning his captaincy skills during the Test match in Rawalpindi. Shehzad accused Masood of lacking a basic understanding of Test cricket and criticized his performance both as a captain and a batter.In a video shared on social media platform X, Shehzad expressed his dismay at how fans are now losing interest in watching Pakistan play cricket. ""Whenever Pakistan has a match, people turn off their TVs. And this is something I'm telling you from the public's perspective. If you go to the people, you will understand what they are saying. You can't control the fans anymore,"" Shehzad said.Shehzad went on to criticize Masood's tactical decisions during the game, including his selection of the playing XI and his inability to read the pitch correctly. ""You are the captain of the Pakistan team now, but there is no clarity about your vision. There’s no understanding of your playing XI. You couldn't even read the pitch. You didn't play a spinner. The excuses you gave in the press conference, about managing player workloads with a fourth fast bowler, were incorrect. The brand of cricket we want to play, you explained it wrong,"" Shehzad stated.Further questioning Masood's leadership qualities, Shehzad remarked, ""Aapki apni performance kuch nahi hai. Koi leadership skills aapne dikhayi nahi is pure match ke ander ke. Samajh aati hai aapki bowlers ne performance nahi kiya, unka caliber yahi hai.

You did not show any leadership skills throughout the match. I understand if your bowlers underperformed—that's their caliber. I understand if your batsmen played poorly on the fifth day—that’s their level. But as a leader, you did nothing].""Shehzad emphasized the importance of knowledge and strategic thinking in Test cricket. ""In Test cricket, there is enough time and so much to do, but for that, you need knowledge. You need to be smart. You need to understand these things to execute them through your players. If you don't have the knowledge yourself, how will you guide your players? When there are some minor successes, like a small partnership, you start making forced decisions, moving fielders around unnecessarily, trying to show you're doing something,"" he continued.In his closing remarks, Shehzad was blunt about Masood's shortcomings as a captain, saying, ""You're just trying to cover your face. The problem is that every decision has a method behind it, and you don't know the method. We know that you don't know. Yet, you are the captain of the Pakistan team.""The strong words from Shehzad reflect the growing frustration and disappointment within the cricketing community and among fans.

COIMBATORE: The recent T20I series in Sri Lanka marked the beginning of not only Gautam Gambhir 's India coaching stint but also Suryakumar Yadav 's tenure as the permanent captain in the shortest format.Both Gambhir and Suryakumar had a lot to smile about at the end of the assignment as they got off to the perfect start with a 3-0 drubbing of the Lankans.With Gambhir throwing his weight behind him, Suryakumar, one of the most destructive batters in T20s, hardly put a foot wrong as skipper. The 33-yearold did not shy away from thinking out of the box when required, a move which enabled India to pull off an improbable win in the third and final match.Gambhir's decision to give a ""free hand"" to the team members is helping players express themselves, according to Suryakumar. ""The way he (Gambhir) played his cricket for India, it was amazing. He understands each player's game. He knows what players like to do on the ground and during practice sessions,"" said Suryakumar, who is in Coimbatore to represent Mumbai in the Buchi Babu tournament Group C match against TNCAXI.""He has given a free hand to everyone.

His only appearance in the longest format came against Australia in Nagpur in Feb 2023.But Suryakumar is motivated to force his way back into the red-ball scheme of things. ""There are a lot of players who have worked hard to earn their place in the Test squad. Even I want to earn a place. After I made my debut for India in Tests, I got injured. The players who have got opportunities, they have done well. Those are the players who deserve the opportunity right now,"" he said.Suryakumar emphasised that playing red-ball cricket has been his top ""priority"" since the time he made his state-team debut. ""The love for red-ball cricket has always been there. Though I made my debut for India in the shorter formats first, I have always enjoyed playing this format. Red-ball cricket has always been the first priority. There is no question about it and that is why I am here ahead of the Duleep Trophy ,"" Suryakumar said.""This format is a little challenging, you have to be one step ahead. You cannot bat like in a T20 game. But at the same time, intent is very important. What body language you carry on the ground, that is very important. If you do well, stay humble.

S Sreesanth (2007 T20 World Cup and 2011 ODI World Cup) and Sanju Samson (2024 T20 World Cup) have been part of India’s World Cup-winning squads, while Sunil Valson, who has his roots in Kannur but represented Delhi in domestic cricket, was part of Kapil Dev’s World Cup-winning squad in 1983.Asha, who hails from Thiruvananthapuram, has played three T20Is and two ODIs in India colours and has claimed four wickets each in both formats. Wayanad girl Sajana has only played nine T20s for India and has scored 30 runs from four innings.The duo has been the biggest beneficiaries of the Women’s Premier League. Asha, who toiled in domestic cricket for more than a decade, burst into the limelight last season as she claimed 12 wickets to emerge as the second-highest wicket-taker in WPL.“The WPL experience would come in handy in a tournament as big as the World Cup. I bowled to most of the top batters in WPL and know where I should bowl to them. Variations are important for a leg-spinner, and I am working on some innovations. Hopefully, I will be able to bowl some of those in the World Cup and catch our rivals by surprise,” the 33-year-old told TOI.Sajana, on the other hand, grabbed eyeballs after smashing a last-ball six to help Mumbai Indians pull off an unlikely win against Delhi Capitals in the WPL opener last season. The 29-year-old from Chootakadavu near Mananthavady feels that adapting to pressure is the key to success at the international level.“I wouldn’t have been here if it was not for the WPL. Playing for India is a great responsibility, and I must admit I have felt pressure while batting in the middle. I am trying to get better at it and hope to capitalize on the opportunities I get,” Sajana said moments after arriving home from Australia, as she was part of the India ‘A’ squad that was touring Down Under.Sajana also added that having Asha as her teammate in the Indian team is a blessing. “Asha chechi (sister) was my captain when I made my debut for Kerala. She knows me very well and always encourages me to give my best. Since we speak the same language, it is easier to communicate and discuss our approach to the game,” said Sajana.While both Asha and Sajana are elated at their World Cup selection, another Kerala cricketer, Minnu Mani, should be feeling hard done by. Minnu was captain of the Indian ‘A’ team that toured Australia and had claimed a ten-wicket haul in the one-off unofficial Test against the hosts.","Two women cricketers from Kerala, Asha Shobana and Sajana Sajeevan, have been included in the Indian squad for the T20 World Cup to be played in the UAE in October.

US Open: Iga Swiatek embracing the spotlight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/us-open/us-open-iga-swiatek-embracing-the-spotlight/articleshow/112823244.cms,"World No. 1 Iga Swiatek

is admittedly shy, but with every passing season she gets a bit more comfortable under the arclights. After a hectic summer which included the

Paris

Olympic Games, she is now striving to go that extra mile heading into the

US Open

...

There was a moment early in Paris 2024 that resonated with a wholesome Olympic vibe. World No.1 Iga Swiatek, the pre-tournament favourite who finished with a bronze medal, gathered silver medalist Donna Vekic and gold medal winner Qinwen Zheng, the Pole's conqueror in the semifinals, following the presentation ceremony.The medallists arranged themselves for a podium selfie that became the feature of the Games. A keep-sake frame, a proactive call from Swiatek, who held up her medal in a victory statement. A bronze that was as good as gold. For the moment at least.Swiatek, 23, the top-seed at the US Open, who opens against the 104th-ranked Kamilla Rakhimova in the first round on Tuesday, is admittedly shy. But with every passing year, having logged more time in the sports' elite bracket, she's becoming increasingly comfortable in the spotlight.Swiatek, who could meet the fourth seed Kazakh Elena Rybakina in the last four in New York, is the owner of the most solid counter in the draw. In the off-season she added steel to her serve, and it has reflected in the stats.The Pole has won 83.6% of her service games this season, more than any other player in the top 10. She has also saved the most breakpoints in that elite bracket besides winning 64.9% of points on the second serve, the best figures in the top 10.Swiatek, the 2022 US Open champion, has lower expectations from the fortnight this year, given that it has been a hectic summer. ""It has been an intense season, and after the Olympics , it hasn't been easy,"" said Swiatek, who played just one tournament in the lead-up to the major. ""I feel the best when I'm focused on practicing and grinding on the court, focused on making my game better and not thinking about the results. I'm just going to try to keep that mindset,"" she said.What does comfort look like on a tennis court? Reaching wide for a ball on the backcourt, or punching an ace at breakpoint? ""It's a feeling, you're able to do things naturally,"" said Swiatek. ""You don't have to think extra, take care of technicalities or movements, because you can do it just with your intuition.""Swiatek's response to Danielle Collins at the end of their quarterfinal clash at the Olympics carried those very stripes. Organic. For the unversed, the world No. 11 was struggling physically in the clash against Swiatek and when trailing 1-4 in the decider she retired with an abdominal injury.Swiatek, who was walking up to Collins, was met by the American on her side of the court. Collins told Swiatek that she didn't want anyone 'faking' concern over her injury, and that she didn't care for 'insincere' talk.The Pole was visibly stunned. ""I haven't had the best experience, and I don't really feel like anybody needs to be insincere,"" Collins said in her post-match media interaction.Swiatek, who could meet Collins in the last-eight in New York, refused to get into a verbal exchange. ""I would rather not get into this because it is her last year on Tour,"" the world No.1 said. 'I haven't had a chance to tell her she had a great journey and that she has really played well.""That's Swiatek sending a heavily spun forehand into an open court. Organic.",World No.1 Iga Swiatek is the top-seed at the US Open. The 23-year-old is the 2022 US Open champion.

""Usually after huge success I will get a little bit too high, until reality slap me down again and I come back to the ground and trying to be humble and work hard.""At 21, Zheng emphasized the importance of maintaining her focus and avoiding any post-triumph let-downs. Anisimova, however, made it challenging. ""It was really difficult, the match today,"" she noted. ""She's hitting the ball very strong and the only things I feel like I can do today during the match is just to stay with her and find my moment.""Anisimova entered the US Open in good form, having climbed from a ranking of 373rd in the world at the start of the year to within the top 50. Her performance this month in Toronto, where she reached the final, earned her a wildcard invitation to the main draw at Flushing Meadows.""Every ball (from Anisimova) went inside in the beginning and I couldn't do anything,"" Zheng admitted. ""More as the match goes I started to find my rhythm on hard court. Little by little I started to get into the rhythm.""After the match, an on-court interviewer praised Zheng’s Olympic gold medal achievement, prompting her to redirect the focus to her current goals. Reflecting on her runner-up finish to Aryna Sabalenka at the Australian Open, Zheng expressed her desire not to let her form slip again.""This time when I get a success, I'm telling myself, I don't want to let this happen. I'm going to continue working hard, keep the stable mindset,"" she said.",Zheng Qinwen is the first Olympic singles champion from China.
