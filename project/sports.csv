Could Diddy’s legal troubles impact Odell Beckham Jr.'s NFL future? The former Super Bowl champion is among several defendants in the lawsuit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/could-diddys-legal-troubles-impact-odell-beckham-jr-s-nfl-future-the-former-super-bowl-champion-is-among-several-defendants-in-the-lawsuit/articleshow/118849838.cms,"Image via AP

Could Diddy’s legal troubles impact Odell Beckham Jr.'s NFL future?

While the legal fight concerning Sean ""Diddy"" Combs is developing, NFL superstar wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. has been named as a defendant in a recently filed case in the Northern District of California.The lawsuit also includes popular comedian and online personality Druski (Drew Desbordes), as well as R&B artist Jaguar Wright. But it is Beckham's purported involvement in the matter that has generated widespread public interest, bringing with it high levels of intense scrutiny and debate throughout social media and news circles.Odell Beckham Jr. last appeared in uniform with the Miami Dolphins in the 2024 NFL season, becoming his fourth club in four seasons. His season on the field was short, though, playing in only nine games and recording just nine receptions for 55 yards. Who was once considered one of the league's best wide receivers saw his career of late derailed by injury and diminishing output.In his first six seasons as a professional, Beckham was a force to be reckoned with. He surpassed 1,000 receiving yards in five of those seasons and scored 48 touchdowns, most of which came as a New York Giant.Chosen 12th overall of the 2014 NFL Draft from LSU, Beckham was a sensation right off the bat in the league. He won the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award and recorded three consecutive Pro Bowl selections as a household name due to highlight-reel plays.Following his stint with the Giants, Odell Beckham Jr. signed with the Cleveland Browns in 2019, the last year he recorded over 600 receiving yards. Unfortunately, injuries have since marred his career, keeping him from sustaining production.In 2023, he had a brief resurgence with the Baltimore Ravens, where he had 35 receptions for 565 yards and three touchdowns. Although there have been glimpses of his old playmaking skills, maintaining health and playing at an elite level have continued to be issues in recent years.Odell Beckham Jr.'s inclusion in the suit has tainted his NFL future. Even though he has not been charged, the litigation issues that face him may affect his chances of securing a new contract with a team. At age 31, with his on-field performance consistently in decline and his name now tied to controversy, his career as a professional football player seems to be at a juncture.Also Read: ""I am covered by God"": Odell Beckham Jr. responds to assault allegations after being named in Diddy’s legal case For many years, Beckham has had quite the résumé to brag about, reaching 575 catches for 7,987 yards and 59 touchdowns.

On Monday's installment of 32 Thoughts: The Podcast on Sportsnet, which they co-host, the two pundits discussed the subject, reviewing the Canadian winger's career and credentials.Bukauskas was especially vocal in his contention that Marchand was bound for a position among hockey's all-time greats, making a staunch claim that the veteran winger had developed a résumé deserving of the sport's highest individual award.“I know, like, there's other players out there that have played 1,000 games and have 1,000 points that aren't in the Hall of Fame,"" Bukauskas said. “I think you look at the way he impacted the league for all those years in that kind of way, there just wasn't a lot of other players like him.He further added, “There were agitators out there, no question; there were players that could score over his years, absolutely. But to have that complete package, he's one of the rare ones, and I think that has to be factored into the conversation too.”Elliotte Friedman, co-host of Bukauskas, raised the issue due to resistance he received regarding the inclusion of Marchand in the Hall of Fame. “Yes, I'm with you on all this. Like, to me, he is a Hall of Famer,” Friedman said.Brad Marchand spent 16 seasons in the NHL playing for the Boston Bruins after the team drafted him in the 2006 NHL Draft. Throughout his time playing with the club, he emerged as a star player, and in his very first season in the league during the 2010-11 campaign, he helped the Bruins win the Stanley Cup. For his leadership and services, he was appointed captain of the team in 2023.

On a fast break in the first quarter, teammate Quincy Olivari lobbed a pass from beyond the arc, and Bronny soared to complete a powerful two-handed slam. The highlight-reel dunk electrified the crowd as fans showered praise over the young basketball star.Bronny has been receiving the end of scrutiny over his NBA future. But his performances in the G-League have been acting as a weapon to silence the critics.His father, LeBron James, was dealing with off-court drama that involved his son. The 40-year-old Lakers superstar confronted ESPN analyst Stephen A. Smith after the Lakers' overtime win against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden. The confrontation stemmed from Smith’s repeated assertions that Bronny does not belong in the NBA and was only drafted by the Lakers due to LeBron’s influence.“That was LeBron James coming up to me, unexpectedly I might add, to confront me about making sure that I mind what I say about his son,” Smith said on First Take. “Can’t repeat the words because they ain’t suited for FCC airwaves. That’s what he was doing.”Smith had previously criticized LeBron for putting pressure on Bronny to succeed in his shadow, stating, “We all know that Bronny James is in the NBA because of his dad.” However, after their face-to-face exchange, Smith acknowledged LeBron’s love to his son. “That wasn’t a basketball player confronting me. That was a parent. That was a father.”Also Read: Ex-New York Knicks star claims big LeBron James' secret as he is not concerned about the King's latest injury: “He's one of the quickest healers” As for Bronny, he is letting his game do the talking. He has been in his A-game in the G-League, and his fans are hoping that he will soon deliver his standout moment in the main roster. Bronny and his father, James, created an NBA record as they became the first father-son duo to play together in a game in the league on October 22, 2024, during a regular season game against the Minnesota Timberwolves.","Bronny James delivered a standout performance in the South Bay Lakers' 121-103 victory over the Motor City Cruise on Saturday night. His 16-point, five- rebound, six-assist game was made special by a thunderous alley-oop dunk that had fans erupting in excitement. His latest achievement came at a time when his father, LeBron James, was embroiled in a heated confrontation with ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118848868,imgsize-17442,width-400,resizemode-4/118848868.jpg"

When Corey Perry’s Contract With The Chicago Blackhawks Was Terminated And There Were Rumors Of An Affair In 2023



Edmonton Oilers’ Corey Perry joined the Chicago Blackhawks in 2023 after being traded by the Tampa Bay Lightning. But Corey Perry’s tenure at the Chicago Blackhawks did not last too long as he got himself involved in a huge scandal that resulted in the Blackhawks cutting all ties with him. This also led to bizarre speculations about Corey Perry having an affair with Connor Bedard’s mother, which was ultimately strongly denied by both the NHL players.In November 2023, according to ESPN, the Chicago Blackhawks were travelling to Columbus to play against the Blue Jackets. Apparently, it was there that an “incident with a team employee” happened.What actually happened on that day remains a mystery and has not been made public yet. However, the Chicago Blackhawks were quick to pull Corey Perry from next day’s game against the Blue Jackets and an investigation began.A few days later, the Chicago Blackhawks terminated their contract with Corey Perry, after they put him on unconditional waivers, and he was left without a team.Later, the Chicago Blackhawks issued a statement to announce that their investigation had proved that Corey Perry violated the NHL Standard Player Contract “intended to promote professional and safe work environments.”Amidst all this, a certain rumour started floating online that Corey Perry’s “unacceptable conduct” included having an affair with Connor Bedard’s mother. However, this was quickly denied by Corey Perry and even by the Chicago Blackhawks GM Kyle Davidson.A few days later, on 1st December 2023, Corey Perry issued a statement where he apologised for his actions and also denied any rumour involving Connor Bedard’s mother.The statement read as,""I would like to sincerely apologize to the entire Chicago Blackhawks organization…I would also like to apologize to my fans, and my family. I am embarrassed and I have let you all down.”Corey Perry continued, “As a result of my actions, there has been speculation and rumors. I am sickened by the impact this has had on others, and I want to make it clear that in no way did this situation involve any of my teammates or their families…”Corey Perry then signed a deal with the Edmonton Oilers and continues to remain in the team.Also Read: “I'm not okay"": Pittsburgh Penguins' recent post about Sidney Crosby Marc-André Fleury and Shawn Thornton sends fans into a frenzy","Corey Perry joined the Chicago Blackhawks in 2023 after being traded by the Tampa Bay Lightning.

Joel Embiid knee injury: What are the options and possible outcomes for the Sixers' star?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/joel-embiid-knee-injury-what-are-the-options-and-possible-outcomes-for-the-sixers-star/articleshow/118858760.cms,"Fans are eager to find out what Joel Embiid's future looks like with the NBA. Source: X

What does Joel Embiid’s year look like in the light of his knee injury?



After participating in only 19 games during the 2024-25 season, Joel Embiid was sidelined for the remainder of the year at the end of February. Despite the pain management strategies and injections employed by the team, his surgically-repaired left knee continued to cause him issues. Now, Embiid is exploring alternative treatments, which may include surgery, as he eyes his return.Embiid underwent surgery to fix a torn meniscus in his left knee on February 2, 2024, a common operation that many NBA players recover from successfully. However, his knee continued to cause him distress more than a year later, which may indicate potential problems. Experts widely believe that if his articular cartilage is damaged, treatment might include less invasive options like orthobiologic injections, such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP), or more extensive procedures like osteochondral implants, where healthy cartilage is transplanted into the affected area.Another possible complication for Embiid is that his repaired meniscus may not be functioning correctly, which could necessitate a meniscal transplant. A good example is Lonzo Ball, the NBA player who successfully returned to play after such a procedure. For Embiid, the recovery might prove more challenging since Ball is physically bigger.A major surgery also takes a mental and emotional toll on an athlete. Embiid himself acknowledged the emotional hardship before the season in an interview. ""You’re on your way to accomplish a lot of good things, and then just like that someone falls on your knee. I don’t have any explanation for why it was so tough, but it just was ... Mentally depressing, physically your body not responding the way it should.""However, assuming no further setbacks, Embiid could potentially play for several more years. ESPN's Shams Charania reported Sunday that the Sixers and Embiid are “consulting doctors and considering alternative options on his injured knee.In the last two losses for the Sixers, Embiid has scored 29 points while shooting 7-for-22. During Saturday's game against Brooklyn, he did not play in the fourth quarter, with Guerschon Yabusele taking over the center position during the team's comeback effort.","Joel Embiid underwent surgery to fix a torn meniscus in his left knee on February 2, 2024, a common operation that many NBA players recover from successfully.

The Los Angeles Lakers are making strategic moves as they gear up for the playoffs, with reports indicating that Jordan Goodwin ’s two-way contract will soon be converted into a standard NBA deal. This decision comes as the team continues its impressive run, winning seven straight games and 18 of their last 21. To make room for Goodwin, the Lakers are likely to waive either Cam Reddish or Alex Len, with Reddish being the more probable candidate.Jordan Goodwin, a 26-year-old guard, has quickly become a valuable asset for the Los Angeles Lakers since joining the team in early February. Over eight games, he has averaged 6.1 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 1.0 assist in 16.9 minutes per game. Even though Goodwin's progress has been hindered by a recent injury to his right ankle, his accomplishments have not gone ignored. Head coach JJ Redick has been very complimentary to him and has called him an important rotation player.Jovan Buha of The Athletic reports that in order to optimize financial flexibility, the Los Angeles Lakers are anticipated to convert Goodwin's deal as late as feasible. ""I do expect him to be converted at the end of the season as late as possible, and then be on the playoff roster. ... He's kind of become the 9th man, and you could argue that depending on the night and depending on the matchup, he should be like the 8th man,"" Buha said on his podcast . He also hinted at a potential multi-year deal for Goodwin in the future, stating, ""I think he's going to get a multi-year contract, longer-term later in the season.""Jordan Goodwin’s journey to the Lakers began after they waived Armel Traore to open a roster spot. A four-year NBA veteran, he has previously played for Washington, Phoenix, and Memphis, holding career averages of 6.4 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 2.6 assists across 128 games. His versatility and defensive prowess have made him a reliable option off the bench.Also read: NBA Buyout Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could bag $33 million ex-Toronton Raptors star to bolster squad's defensive end As the Los Angeles Lakers continue their push for playoff success, the decision to convert Jordan Goodwin’s contract reflects their commitment to strengthening their roster.

Stephen Curry and Draymond Green lead Golden State Warriors to a gritty victory

Jimmy Butler’s ability to draw fouls and attack the defense

Golden State Warriors climb to sixth in Western Conference

NBA scouts use vivid language to describe Jimmy Butler 's current playing condition which demands everyone's attention. Since joining the team, Butler led the Golden State Warriors to a dominant 11-2 season record. This resurgence has the entire league on alert, with teams dreading the prospect of facing a revitalized Warriors squad come playoff time.In an exciting 115-110 win against the Detroit Pistons, Stephen Curry proved once again why he's a legend, dropping 32 points and hitting the impressive milestone of 25,000 career points. His three-pointer in the third quarter not only solidified his place in NBA history but also fired up his teammates and the crowd.Draymond Green, who’s usually recognized for his defense rather than his scoring, hit a key three-pointer with only 35 seconds left on the clock.Since Butler came on board with the Warriors on February 8, he’s really turned things around. In the game against the Pistons, he scored 26 points, pulled down nine rebounds, and handed out five assists, proving he can make a difference in so many areas. His arrival has added a new layer to the Warriors, helping to balance their offense and improve their defense.Because of Butler's expertise at drawing fouls and slipping past opponents, he has established quality scoring opportunities for his teammates. The offensive system of the Warriors became more varied and hard to predict because of this development.The Warriors have established a defensive lockdown that matches their historical best. The team leads the league in turning opponent turnovers into points through a tough defensive strategy and the impact of Butler. Their fierce defense strategy has provided the Warriors with a commanding position to shape game plays throughout their recent wins.The Warriors are on a roll and have now reached the sixth spot in the Western Conference standings. With a solid mix of veteran players and strategic newcomers like Butler, they’re shaping up to be a tough opponent in the playoffs..The scout's actual comment, “honeymoon-phase Jimmy is a motherf*cker. People way too quickly forgot what Jimmy Butler can do” really captures how a lot of people in the league feel: going up against the Warriors in the playoffs is pretty intimidating.The addition of Jimmy Butler has given the Golden State Warriors a fresh boost, reigniting their dreams of winning another title. With Curry's steady performance, Green's strong leadership, and Butler's all-around game, the team is definitely finding its stride again.Also Read : Barack Obama, Steve Ballmer, and James Harden Steal the Show at Intuit Dome","Golden State Warriors beat Detroit Pistons 115-110.

One user summed it up simply: “Wow, dinner with the GOAT.” Another added, “Hell yeah bro, good for him.

Davante Adams Joins Los Angeles Rams on a Lucrative 2-Year Deal After New York Jets Release





Follow the IND vs NZ Live Score for real-time updates, or check out the Live Cricket Score for all ongoing matches.



Six-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Davante Adams has officially found his next home in the NFL , and he's heading west to join the Los Angeles Rams . The team announced that Adams has agreed to a two-year deal worth $46 million, with $26 million guaranteed. His arrival in Los Angeles marks a significant shift for the Rams ' receiving corps, especially following the decision to move on from former Super Bowl MVP Cooper Kupp.By signing Davante Adams, the Rams are making a bold statement about their offensive ambitions. The 32-year-old receiver remains one of the most productive playmakers in the league, as evidenced by his 2024 season, where he recorded 1,063 yards and eight touchdowns despite a tumultuous year split between the Las Vegas Raiders and the New York Jets. His ability to perform at an elite level, even in challenging situations, proves why he was ranked as the No. 3 free agent overall and the second-best wide receiver available in 2025.His addition provides a major boost to Matthew Stafford 's arsenal, as Adams will now pair up with rising star Puka Nacua. This duo has the potential to create a formidable passing attack under head coach Sean McVay’s dynamic system. Rams head coach Sean McVay had been recruiting Adams ""hard,"" according to NFL Network's Mike Garafolo, implying just how highly the franchise valued the opportunity to bring him aboard.Selected in the second round of the 2014 NFL Draft by the Green Bay Packers, Adams has built a Hall of Fame-worthy career over 11 seasons. His résumé speaks for itself—957 career receptions, 11,844 receiving yards, and 103 touchdowns. Among active players, he ranks second in receiving touchdowns and fourth in both receptions and receiving yards. His impact has been undeniable, whether it was during his eight-year tenure with the Packers, his three-year stint with the Raiders, or his brief time with the Jets.Despite his impressive numbers, Adams’ 2024 season was marred by instability. He played only three games for the Raiders before requesting a trade, which sent him to the Jets in hopes of rekindling his chemistry with Aaron Rodgers. However, things did not go as planned, as the Jets struggled to a 5-12 record. With a regime change in New York that saw head coach Aaron Glenn and general manager Darren Mougey take over, the team decided to part ways with both Rodgers and Adams, freeing up nearly $30 million in cap space.Now, Adams sets his sights on making an immediate impact in Los Angeles. The Rams, who finished 10-7 last season before falling to the eventual Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Divisional Round, are looking to return to championship contention. With Adams' arrival, the team gains a veteran presence alongside Nacua and Demarcus Robinson, creating a well-rounded receiving group.Also Read: NFL Legend to a murderer: Revisiting the controversial life and career of O.J. Simpson For Adams, this move provides an opportunity to chase his first Super Bowl ring. With Stafford at the helm and McVay’s offensive genius guiding the way, the Rams are positioning themselves as legitimate contenders. Adams has long been considered one of the best wide receivers of his generation, and now, he has the chance to prove it on one of the NFL’s biggest stages.","Six-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Davante Adams has officially found his next home in the NFL.

Let’s look back at five of his best regular-season buckets that showcase why he’s one of the greatest players in basketball history.In a game against the New York Knicks, Curry delivered a career-defining performance, scoring 54 points and hitting 11 three-pointers. One of his most memorable shots was a deep three-pointer that silenced the crowd at Madison Square Garden. This game proved Curry’s ability to dominate under pressure.During the 2015-16 season, Curry made history with one of his greatest shots. Facing the Oklahoma City Thunder, he launched a 37-foot three-pointer in overtime to win the game. The shot was not just clutch but also a symbol of his limitless range and unshakable confidence.In a game against the Washington Wizards, Curry put on a scoring clinic, dropping 51 points in just three quarters.

His performance left fans and players in awe of his scoring efficiency.Curry’s deep three-pointer against the Los Angeles Clippers in 2021 reminded everyone why he is a shooting genius. This shot, made from nearly 30 feet out, was part of his 45-point performance that helped secure the win for the Warriors.Another unforgettable moment came against the Los Angeles Clippers when Curry executed a behind-the-back dribble to lose his defender, stepped back, and drained a three-pointer.

How to watch the Los Angeles Lakers play tonight (March 10, 2025)

The Los Angeles Lakers face uncertainty ahead of their Monday night matchup against the Brooklyn Nets , as star guard Luka Doncic is listed as questionable on the injury report due to a back issue. The game, scheduled for 7:30 p.m. ET at Barclays Center, could see the Lakers without one of their key players as they aim to maintain their strong position in the standings. Luka Doncic might miss tonight’s. He is listed as GTD and as a result, we will need to keep an eye on his latest status for tonight’s match. Doncic, who has been averaging 30 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 9.0 assists over the last 20 games, is a critical piece of the Lakers' offense. His potential absence would add to the team’s injury woes, as they are already without LeBron James (groin), Rui Hachimura (knee), Dorian Finney-Smith (ankle), and Maxi Kleber (foot). Jaxson Hayes is also questionable with a knee injury, leaving the Lakers’ rotation thin.The Lakers, currently 40-22, have relied heavily on their depth this season, with Austin Reaves stepping up as a consistent scorer, averaging 18.8 points per game. However, Doncic’s playmaking and scoring ability are irreplaceable, and his absence could shift the dynamics of the game.On the other side, the Nets are dealing with their own injury challenges. De'Anthony Melton is out for the season with an ACL tear, while Trendon Watford and Cameron Thomas are sidelined with hamstring injuries. Despite their struggles, the Nets have shown flashes of competitiveness, led by Cameron Johnson, who averages a team-high 19.0 points per game.The Los Angeles Lakers ’ +111 scoring differential highlights their balanced approach, ranking eighth in the league in points allowed (111.1 per game) while scoring 112.9 points per game. However, their rebounding has been a concern, averaging just 42.8 boards per game, 25th in the NBA. Luka Doncic’s 8.5 rebounds per game lead the team, underscoring his importance on both ends of the floor.Fans can catch the game on SportsNet LA and YES or stream it live on Fubo, though regional restrictions may apply. With Doncic’s status up in the air, the Lakers will need others to step up if they hope to secure a crucial road win.Also read: Will LeBron James play tonight against the Brooklyn Nets?

Kevin Durant Destroys Skip Bayless With Hilarious Clapback: Did He Just Call Himself ‘Washed’?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/kevin-durant-destroys-skip-bayless-with-hilarious-clapback-did-he-just-call-himself-washed/articleshow/118852791.cms,"Credits: NBA

Did Kevin Durant Just Admit He’s ‘Washed’? His Response to Skip Bayless Says It All

Skip Bayless, perched on his podcast throne, a digital echo chamber of hot takes and jersey-throwing theatrics. He’s conjuring up sports narratives like a wizard gone rogue, and this time, his target? The ever-elusive Kevin Durant . But instead of a puff of smoke, Bayless got a comedic atomic bomb dropped right on his digital doorstep. Our tale begins with Bayless, the man who seemingly exists to ignite fiery sports debates, declaring Durant, at the ripe old age of 36, “mentally semi-retired.” Yes, you read that right. Apparently, scoring buckets and dominating the court is now a sign of leisurely, mental retirement. Bayless, whose career trajectory has seen him migrate from ESPN’s grand stage to the more intimate setting of his podcast, The Skip Bayless Show, seems to believe he’s still dropping bombshells.Now, Durant, a master of the social media riposte, wasn’t about to let this slide. He hit back with a perfectly crafted tweet, a comedic masterpiece that sent ripples through the internet: “F**k it. We’re both washed, it was a great run, @RealSkipBayless.”The sheer brilliance of this response lies in its self-deprecating humor. Durant, a player still averaging a stellar 26.8 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 4.3 assists, essentially agreed with Bayless’s absurd claim, but with a twist. By including Bayless in his ""washed"" assessment, he effectively turned the tables, highlighting the ridiculousness of the original statement.It’s like a comedic judo move, using Bayless’s own momentum against him. The implication? If Durant, with his impressive stats, is “washed,” then what does that make Bayless, whose platform has shrunk, and whose takes are often more theatrical than insightful?ALSO READ: Portland Trail Blazers vs Golden State Warriors Game Preview (03/10): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and More Durant's response wasn't just a clapback, it was a masterclass in comedic timing and social media savvy. In a world where sports debates often descend into vitriol, Durant injected a dose of humor, reminding us that even the most serious sports figures can have a good laugh at the expense of those who take themselves a little too seriously. And, let’s be honest, watching Skip Bayless get roasted is a sport in itself.","Kevin Durant responded to Skip Bayless' claim that he's ""mentally semi-retired"" Durant's response was a masterclass in comedic timing and social media savvy.

Alright, picture this: Mardi Gras is over, the beads are swept up (mostly), and suddenly, the Smoothie King Center is buzzing with a different kind of excitement. It's not the sweet sound of Zion's dunks, but the low, rumbling whisper of a new titan in town. Forget the crawfish boil, the Pelicans just served up a surprise signing that's got everyone doing a double-take: Mo Bamba , the wandering 7-footer, is officially a Pelican, at least for the next ten days!Yes, you heard that right. The man who's bounced from Orlando to Hollywood and back again, like a basketball on a trampoline, is now bringing his talents to the Big Easy. Shams Charania, the NBA 's resident scoop-master, dropped the news like a hot beignet, confirming Bamba's 10-day deal.The Pelicans, clearly feeling a little light in the paint, are gambling on Bamba’s potential to add some much-needed muscle and height.Let’s be honest, Bamba’s NBA journey has been a bit of a rollercoaster. He’s shown flashes of brilliance, like those 21-point, 15-rebound G League explosions, but consistency has been his elusive ghost. Averaging 4.8 points and 4.3 rebounds with the Clippers this season, he’s been more of a whisper than a roar. But hey, maybe a change of scenery is just what the doctor ordered.Think about it: New Orleans, a city known for its vibrant energy and unpredictable twists, seems like the perfect place for a player looking for a fresh start. With Zion and Ingram drawing so much attention, Bamba could find himself with open looks and rebounding opportunities galore. He’s got the tools, the height, and the experience. Now, it's just a matter of putting it all together.ALSO READ: Kevin Durant Destroys Skip Bayless With Hilarious Clapback: Did He Just Call Himself ‘Washed’?

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Bleakest NFL Teams, QB Draft Drama, and Sunny Washington Times | The Bill Simmons Podcast

Brought me six Super Bowls, one of my favorite athletes of all time,"" Simmons said. ""This is a dangerous thing where you have him running a football team thinking he knows what’s best with quarterbacks because he was a great quarterback. Because all of the evidence with the great players we’ve had, name the sport, mostly they’re not good at this.”He added, ""They think they’re seeing things that other people don’t see, and it’s not actually rational.""
