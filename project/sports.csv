My wife wants me to be at home and take care of my boys: Rahul Dravid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/my-wife-wants-me-to-be-at-home-and-take-care-of-my-boys-rahul-dravid/articleshow/112724644.cms,"Top Picks For You Rahul Dravid jokes about playing himself in a biopic: 'If the money is good...'

MUMBAI: When Rahul Dravid is in a good mood, he can leave you in splits. At an event here on Wednesday night, he responded hilariously when quizzed about which actor he would pick to play himself in a biopic. “If the money is good enough, I will play it myself,” the cricket legend quipped. Having stepped down as Team India head coach after guiding Rohit Sharma & Co to their T20 World Cup triumph in the West Indies in June, Dravid humorously referred to himself as “jobless” multiple times and even urged the audience to “send him an email with suggestions on what job he can take up next”.“My wife (Vijeta) wants me to be at home and take care of my boys,” he added.Dravid acknowledged that winning tournaments requires not only skill but also a bit of luck, which can play a significant role in the outcome of big matches.To emphasise this point, Dravid recalled two finals during his nearly three-year tenure as Team India head coach—one in Ahmedabad and the other in Barbados. The first was the 2023 World Cup final on Nov 19, when Travis Head survived a probing spell from India’s newball pacers Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami before his 137-run knock broke a billion Indian hearts.“I’ve had time to reflect on it... You realize sometimes you have to do everything right, but luck plays its part,” Dravid said.“On November 19th… we beat Travis Head’s bat 15 times — he didn’t touch a single ball. Sometimes things go your way, but you have to stick to the process,” Dravid, who received the Lifetime Achievement honour at the Ceat Cricket Rating Awards, remarked.Dravid also pointed to India’s thrilling comeback against South Africa in the T20 World Cup final in Barbados on June 29. Despite South Africa needing just 30 runs off the last five overs, India (176/7) defended their total, withSuryakumar Yadav ’s stunning boundary catch turning the game in India’s favour.“Sometimes at the end of the day, you need a little bit of luck. (Against South Africa in T20WC final)… 30 balls to go, 30 runs to go. (It was about) incredible execution, incredible calmness by Rohit. We didn’t focus on what we needed to do, but we needed a guy who could keep his foot within one inch of a line. Sometimes (it is) the skill,” he said, recalling Suryakumar Yadav’s fabulous catch on the long-off boundary to pull off David Miller’s dismissal. It was a catch that tilted a tight game in India’s favour.Reflecting on his time as head coach, Dravid expressed pride in India’s journey to the 2023 World Cup final, where they won nine consecutive matches before losing to Australia in the title clash. “To travel across the country and witness the passion of the fans... just the experience as a coach was phenomenal,” he said.Though they fell short in the 2023 World Cup, Dravid credited the team’s T20 World Cup success to sticking with the same processes and energy. “We needed to create the same vibe, the same team atmosphere... and hope for a little bit of luck on the day,” the 51-year-old explained. Dravid waxed eloquent on India’s ability to churn out top-quality cricketers.“I left in 2011-2012. These (new) players have been able to carry the legacy forward. If you just look at the success that we’ve had over the last 12 years in all the three formats of the game, the time that after we left, it’s been absolutely phenomenal. Very easily, clearly in a lot of the rankings, we’re always (No.) 1 or 2… we’re always up there with anyone,” he said.“I have no doubt that this generation of players, led by people like Rohit and Surya and the (other) guys coming forward in all formats of the game is only going to continue to do that in the future,” he added.","Rahul Dravid jokes about playing himself in a biopic: 'If the money is good enough, I will play it myself' The cricket legend stepped down as Team India head coach after guiding Rohit Sharma & Co to their T20 World Cup triumph in the West Indies in June.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112724666,imgsize-50480,width-400,resizemode-4/112724666.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Jamie Smith 's unbeaten 72 helped England secure a slim first-innings lead against Sri Lanka in the opening Test at Old Trafford on Thursday, despite the second day being curtailed by poor light and rain. England reached 259-6, a lead of 23 runs, in response to Sri Lanka's 236.Smith, batting at No 6 due to the absence of injured skipper Ben Stokes, registered his third half-century in four Test appearances.The 24-year-old wicketkeeper showcased his ability to support established batsmen and maintain the scoring rate while batting with the tail.He shared partnerships of 62 with Harry Brook (56) and 52 with Chris Woakes (25) before both were dismissed by left-arm spinner Prabath Jayasuriya, who returned figures of 2-58 in 21 overs.England found themselves in trouble at 67-3 in the 15th over after the morning session was washed out, with paceman Asitha Fernando claiming 3-68 in 14 overs.Sri Lanka had experienced a similar collapse on Wednesday, losing their first three wickets for no runs in 10 balls before being bowled out for 236.Captain Dhananjaya de Silva top-scored with 74, while debutant Milan Rathnayake set a new record for the highest score by a No 9 batsman on debut with his 72.Dan Lawrence, recalled to open in place of the injured Zak Crawley , successfully reviewed an lbw decision against him off Asitha Fernando when on 10.However, two balls later, the paceman trapped Ben Duckett lbw for 18, with Sri Lanka overturning the original not out decision.Asitha Fernando's excellent bowling performance continued as he dismissed Ollie Pope, who was captaining England for the first time due to Stokes' torn hamstring, for just six runs with a ball that nipped back through the gap between bat and pad.Despite the setback, Lawrence appeared to be in good form until he edged a ball angled across him from left-arm seamer Vishwa Fernando to the diving wicketkeeper Dinesh Chandimal when he was on 30.Pope's dismissal brought Root to the crease, and the former England captain boasted an impressive record against Sri Lanka, having scored more than 1,000 runs in 11 previous Tests at an average of nearly 60, including four centuries.However, Asitha Fernando ended a promising partnership of 58 when Root, who had scored a typically elegant 42, inside-edged an intended drive, and Chandimal dived forward to take a fine low catch.Smith, the new batsman, confidently advanced down the pitch to drive Jayasuriya for six, and Brook completed a fifty off just 59 balls.On the same ground where Shane Warne bowled Mike Gatting with the 'Ball of the Century' in 1993, Jayasuriya made a bid for the modern-day equivalent by dismissing Brook in stunning fashion. The 25-year-old rising star had added just three runs to his tea score of 53 not out when he was turned inside out by a ball from left-armer Jayasuriya that dipped in on the line of middle and leg stumps before spinning sharply and bouncing to clip the top of off stump.Brook's dismissal left England at 187-5, and Woakes fell in a similar manner when he was clean bowled by a quicker Jayasuriya delivery that angled in and spun significantly away from the right-hander.","England reach 259-6, a lead of 23 runs, in response to Sri Lanka's 236.

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant 's exceptional performance during India's previous tour of Australia has left a lasting impression on batting legend Matthew Hayden . The former Australian opener believes that Pant's ""muscle memory and thirst for victory"" will make him a crucial player for the Indian team when they embark on their upcoming five-Test series in Australia later this year.The highly-anticipated Test series is set to commence on November 22 in Perth, and Pant's presence in the Indian lineup is expected to be a significant factor in their quest for success.""Guys like Rishabh Pant have got a muscle memory and the thirst for victory. He was such a key player last time he played there and the Australian public loved him as well, because of the nature of the way he played his game,"" Hayden told media, as quoted by PTI, on the sidelines of 'CEAT Cricket Rating Awards' in Mumbai on Wednesday.""It was exciting. It was innovative. It was just fresh and good. Then you have got your old stewards, likeVirat Kohli , (he) will want to make an impression again. From a batting point of view, I'm excited to see how India have that strategy to take on the Australian conditions,"" the Australian added.Pant has staged a remarkable comeback to the sport following a harrowing accident that threatened his life in 2022. His return to the national team has been nothing short of spectacular, as he aims to replicate his heroic performances from the historic 2020-21 tour of Australia.During that unforgettable series, Pant played a pivotal role in India's triumph, scoring a scintillating 97 and an unbeaten 89. His fearless approach and ability to take on the Australian bowlers in their own backyard were instrumental in India's success.Against all odds, a depleted Indian side, missing several key players, orchestrated one of the most incredible comebacks in the annals of Test cricket. They defied expectations and stunned a formidable Australian team on their home turf, securing a victory that will be etched in the memories of cricket enthusiasts for generations to come.The visitors rebounded from the humiliation of being bowled out for 36 in the opening Adelaide Test to secure a 2-1 victory in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, their second consecutive series win.After the Adelaide match, Kohli had to return home for personal reasons, while five other players, including key pacers Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami, were sidelined due to injuries and fitness concerns.""The great thing from an Indian perspective is that when you look at the last victory, there was no Virat Kohli. There was very much a second team bowling line-up that won at the Gabba,"" Hayden said.""That's the kind of confidence that you can expect this Indian unit to go to our shores (with) and go, 'guys, we've done this before, and we've done it in a way that's second to none, even without our key players',"" he said.Hayden remarked that scheduling a day-night Test often diminishes the advantage Australian teams have traditionally enjoyed. In the upcoming series, the two sides are set to play a Pink Ball Test in Adelaide.""Once you get those overhead conditions under that twilight zone, they can be really difficult,"" he said.""I would go as far as to say that the home advantage in Australia has been taken away quite a lot, simply on the basis that if you get (on) the wrong side of a certain session, be that you are four for 130 at twilight, you can (soon) be eight for 150.""There's no chance to actually really naturally dominate a game,"" he added.Hayden praised Pat Cummins, noting that he has united his team like no other Australian captain before, leading Australia to victories in both the World Test Championship and ODI World Cup last year.""He has a very special leadership style and ability. It's a very different style to the former captains of the Australian cricket team that were (about) very much a carrot and stick type approach,"" he said.""He's operating on a model that's bringing out the individuals and individual preparation in particular - something which our game struggles with being a team sport,"" he added.Hayden remarked that Australia, under Cummins' leadership, has become an exceptionally close-knit team, earning the respect of former players like himself, who were initially upset by the way former coach Justin Langer was dismissed.""I (have) followed this team very closely over the last two years and they're an extremely close team. Even the former players, when we were upset with the removal of Justin Langer, they closed ranks and doubled down on how it is that they wanted to go about their work,"" he said.","Rishabh Pant's exceptional performance during India's previous tour of Australia has left a lasting impression on batting legend Matthew Hayden.

It was something that we were really hoping for. When we won the World Cup, it was important for all of us to enjoy the moment which we did pretty well and thanks to our nation as well for celebrating with us,"" he said.""As much as it meant for us, it meant a whole lot to the entire nation as well.

I have seen a lot of guys who are pretty much into 'how many grains the bat has', 'what is the weight of the bat' and 'how does it look from outside', but I am not that kind of a person. I will pick up the bat and if I feel this is the right bat, I will go and play with that,"" he said.Despite leading the Mumbai Indians to five IPL titles as captain, Rohit's hunger to add more trophies to his collection remains insatiable.""There is a reason I won five IPL trophies. I'm not going to stop, because once you get the taste of winning games, winning Cups, you don't want to stop and we'll keep pushing as a team. We'll keep striving for better things in the future,"" he said.As an extension, he wanted more success with India too as their ODI and Test leader.""We've got a couple of solid tours coming up, very challenging ones as well.

The dismissal also served as a reminder of the crucial role spinners can play in Test cricket , particularly on surfaces that offer assistance.With England seemingly in control and Brook looking comfortable at the crease, the wicket provided Sri Lanka with a much-needed breakthrough.It remains to be seen whether this moment of brilliance will prove decisive in the context of the match, but it undoubtedly added another chapter to the rich history of spin bowling at Old Trafford.","Sri Lanka spinner Prabath Jayasuriya dismisses England's Harry Brook for 56.

Cricket fans are in for a real treat, and I hope they'll be out in force to support both Men's and Women's sides. India touring is always a big draw and a highlight of any cricket summer,"" he said.""The last Men's Test series here was a nail biter and I'm sure next year's clash will be just as exciting, while our women's series are always fiercely competitive. I'm delighted we'll also be welcoming both West Indies teams back again for white ball series, following this year's Men's Test series,"" he added.""To be welcoming Zimbabwe back for a Men's Test Match will be a historic moment, more than 20 years since their last visit. Test cricket is so beloved in this country, and we know that we have an important role to play in supporting developing test cricketing nations so that this format of the game thrives long into the future,"" he said.England's home international summer will conclude in early September, with the men's taking on South Africa in three ODIs and as many T20Is, before the team travels to Ireland for three ODIs from September 17-21.ECB also confirmed that India's women's team will return in 2026 for a one-off Test match at Lord's – the first-ever Women's Test to be staged at the Home of Cricket.

Reflecting on India's recent ICC campaigns, Dravid pointed to the team's defeat in the ODI World Cup final against Australia and their subsequent victory in the T20 World Cup final against South Africa as examples of how fortune can influence even the most well-prepared teams.India entered the ODI World Cup final with a perfect record, winning 10 consecutive matches. However, in the final against Australia, things didn't go as planned, and Australia emerged victorious, leaving Indian fans disappointed. Six months later, Dravid and captain Rohit Sharma had another opportunity for glory in the T20 World Cup final against a strong South African team. On this occasion, luck favored India.At the Ceat Cricket Rating Awards, where Dravid received the Lifetime Achievement Award, he spoke about the fine margins that often separate victory from defeat in high-stakes matches.""I've had time to reflect on it.

He credited the team's execution and Rohit's calmness under pressure but also highlighted a pivotal moment whenSuryakumar Yadav 's stunning catch at the boundary dismissed David Miller, changing the course of the game in India's favor.""Sometimes, it's the skill, but you also need someone who can keep their foot within one inch of a line,"" Dravid said, referring to Yadav's game-changing catch.In contrast, Dravid remembered how Australia's Travis Head rode his luck to score a match-winning century in the ODI World Cup final, despite India's bowlers frequently beating his bat.

You know, things can go your way sometimes,"" Dravid noted, underscoring the unpredictable nature of sports.As he steps down from his coaching role, Dravid expressed optimism about the future of Indian cricket.

NEW DELHI: Novak Djokovic , energized by his triumphant performance at the Olympic Games, aims to break new Grand Slam records at the US Open starting Monday. Meanwhile, his main rival, Jannik Sinner , arrives in New York facing scrutiny over two positive drug tests.If Djokovic secures a fifth title, he can become the oldest Open era champion at the tournament, sharing the record with Jimmy Connors, Pete Sampras, and Roger Federer.A victory would also elevate him to 25 Grand Slam triumphs, surpassing the 24 he currently shares with Margaret Court.This year has been challenging for Djokovic, as Sinner succeeded him as the Australian Open champion and took over his world number one ranking. Additionally, Carlos Alcaraz claimed Djokovic's French Open title and dominated him in a one-sided Wimbledon final.However, Djokovic made a remarkable comeback on the clay courts of Roland Garros, stunning Alcaraz in the Olympic final. His emotional victory in Paris allowed him to join an elite group of only five players to complete a career Golden Slam, winning all four majors and an Olympic gold medal.The victory silenced the growing number of skeptics who had dismissed the Serb as a fading force in a new era dominated by the 23-year-old Sinner and 21-year-old Alcaraz.Djokovic, who underwent knee surgery in June, described his Olympic victory as his ""biggest sporting success"" and the 99th title of his professional career.""At the age of 37 and facing a 21-year-old who is probably the best player in the world right now, winning Roland Garros and Wimbledon back-to-back, I can say that this is probably the biggest sporting success I have ever had,"" insisted Djokovic.Sinner, the rising Italian tennis star, enters the US Open, the final Grand Slam event of the year, fresh off his victory at the Cincinnati Masters. The young player's impressive performance on the court, however, was quickly overshadowed by recent revelations regarding his drug tests.Earlier in the season, Sinner tested positive on two separate occasions for clostebol, ""an anabolic agent prohibited at all times by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)."" The news raised concerns about the athlete's integrity and the fairness of his competitions.Despite the positive tests, Sinner managed to avoid a prolonged suspension from the sport. Officials ultimately accepted his explanation that the banned substance had inadvertently entered his system due to contamination from a member of his support team.This decision allowed him to continue competing, but the incident has cast a shadow over his recent successes on the court.""I will now put this challenging and deeply unfortunate period behind me,"" said Sinner.","Novak Djokovic aims to break new Grand Slam records at the US Open starting Monday.

Why tennis star Jannik Sinner tested positive for steroids twice but faces no suspension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/why-tennis-star-jannik-sinner-tested-positive-for-steroids-twice-but-faces-no-suspension/articleshow/112659493.cms,"NEW DELHI: Italian tennis star Jannik Sinner, currently ranked among the world's top players, faced a doping investigation after testing positive for a banned anabolic steroid in March 2023.While the positive tests resulted in the forfeiture of prize money and ranking points earned at the Indian Wells tournament, Sinner will not face suspension from professional tennis.The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) announced on August 22nd that an independent tribunal determined Sinner's violation was unintentional. This decision follows a hearing held on August 15th, where evidence and testimonies were presented.Sinner, who achieved a career-high ranking of world No. 1 in June 2023, provided an explanation for the positive tests.He claimed that a member of his support team unknowingly used an over-the-counter spray containing Clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid, to treat a minor wound on Sinner. The same team member subsequently administered massages to Sinner, inadvertently leading to the contamination.The ITIA, after reviewing the evidence and accepting Sinner's explanation, concluded that the violation lacked intent.This determination, supported by the independent tribunal's findings, resulted in a ""No Fault or Negligence"" ruling, effectively clearing Sinner of intentional doping charges.The incident occurred during the Indian Wells tournament, where Sinner initially tested positive for low levels of Clostebol metabolites.A second positive test from an out-of-competition sample collected eight days later led to a provisional suspension, which was later lifted following Sinner's successful appeal.Despite the investigation and its impact on his Indian Wells results, Sinner has continued to excel on the court. He recently clinched the Cincinnati Open title and is considered a strong contender for the upcoming US Open .","Italian tennis star Jannik Sinner tested positive for a banned anabolic steroid in March 2023.

This marks the first time either player has won the title at the prestigious tournament.In the women's final, Sabalenka triumphed over Jessica Pegula 6-3, 7-5, claiming her first title since her victory at the Australian Open earlier this year in January.Sinner, who celebrated his 23rd birthday on Friday, defeated American player Frances Tiafoe 7-6 (4), 6-2. With this win, Sinner becomes the youngest champion at the Cincinnati Open since Andy Murray's victory in 2008 at the age of 21.“I’m very happy to be in the position where I am,"" Sinner said, as quoted by AP. ""I'm just trying to keep going this way mentally. It's important to recover to be ready for New York. That's the most important thing.”The US Open is set to commence on August 26 in New York City.In Cincinnati, Sinner and Tiafoe both reached their maiden finals, surpassing their previous best performances of reaching the third round.Despite Tiafoe's efforts to force a tiebreak in the opening set, a series of three consecutive errors resulted in a 7-6 loss.Sinner established a commanding 5-1 lead in the second set, but Tiafoe managed to save three match points, narrowing the gap to 5-2. However, Sinner ultimately prevailed, successfully serving out the match to secure the victory.Tiafoe's journey to the final was marked by unusual circumstances. In the quarterfinals on Saturday, he claimed the first set before his opponent, Hubert Hurkacz, retired due to a calf injury. Subsequently, in the semifinals, Tiafoe showcased his resilience by saving two match points and defeating Holger Rune in a thrilling three-set encounter.An American male tennis player hasn't secured the championship in Cincinnati since 2006, when Andy Roddick achieved the feat.Sabalenka, who climbed to the No. 2 position in the rankings prior to the match, showcased her dominance by winning the tournament without dropping a single set. This victory marks her 15th WTA title.Despite her previous struggles in Cincinnati, where she had never advanced beyond the semifinals, losing three times at that stage, Sabalenka finally broke through to claim the trophy.At 26 years old, Sabalenka has established herself as a top contender for the upcoming U.S. Open. The Belarusian player was forced to miss Wimbledon due to a shoulder injury but made her return to the tour two weeks ago in Washington.“I would say that I'm really playing great tennis,” Sabalenka said. “Probably not the best tennis I can play but I'm definitely getting there. Hopefully at the US Open I can reach even higher levels.”Sabalenka quickly established a commanding 4-1 lead in the opening set against Pegula, taking just 17 minutes to assert her dominance. Despite Pegula's efforts to mount a comeback, including breaking Sabalenka's serve for the first time to level the second set at 5-5, her five double faults proved costly.Sabalenka, however, remained focused and determined, claiming the next two games to secure victory in a match that lasted 1 hour and 14 minutes.“She was playing at a high level and never really came down,” Pegula said. “When she’s serving really well, it’s tough, especially on these fast courts.”Pegula, the sixth-ranked player, faced a tough journey to reach the final. Following her successful title defense in Toronto, the American had to play two matches on Friday due to delays caused by weather conditions. Additionally, three of her matches extended to three sets.“I'm proving to myself that I can play a lot of matches and overcome a lot of challenges,” Pegula said. “I'm looking forward to not doing anything for a few days.""Sabalenka joined top-ranked Iga Swiatek as the only players with 10 or more WTA titles since 2020. She beat Swiatek in the Cincinnati semis.","Top-seeded Jannik Sinner defeated Frances Tiafoe 7-6 (4), 6-2 in the final of the Cincinnati Open.

Maharashtra government

to make amends & announce reward to boost shuttler's morale before Paris Games

MUMBAI: Badminton player Chirag Shetty 's comments regarding Maharashtra government ignoring his achievements while rewarding cricketers from the state for winning the T20 World Cup have stirred up a hornet's nest.Chirag along with Satwiksairaj Rankireddy - the No.3 ranked men's doubles team in the world - played a crucial role in India winning their maiden Thomas Cup in 2022. Chirag, though, wasn't recognised for his effort. After seeing the cricketers being feted, the aggrieved shuttler told TOI on Sunday that ""if the state government can honour World Cup-winning stars, they should also honour him and treat other sports equally"".Besides the Thomas Cup success, Chirag has also won doubles gold at Asian Games , Commonwealth Games and bronze at World Championships. The 27-year-old Malad resident has now found support from prominent sportspersons of the city, who urged the state government to resurrect the situation by rewarding Chirag. Uday Pawar , coach and mentor of Chirag, felt that his ward's achievement is on par with that of cricketers and he should have been rewarded for it.Former India hockey captain MM Somaya said that he had sympathy for Chirag as ""winning the Thomas Cup is a truly historic achievement"". He went on to add that the state government can make amends by announcing a reward for him just before the Paris Olympics begin which will be good ""for his morale as well"".Pawar, a former Asian Games medallist and a prominent badminton coach in the city, said: ""I am not comparing sports but like the cricketers who have brought honour to Maharashtra, so has Chirag. I feel his achievement is on par (with the cricketers). A person who has brought honour to the state shouldn't be demanding but the state should recognise his efforts on its own.""He added that players shouldn't ask for recognition and instead the state government should have a mechanism in place where once they have achieved something of national significance, they should be rewarded.""I think the state's sports ministry should be more active. They should do their own homework and should be aware of who the top players from Maharashtra are. If they don't know about his/her achievement, then the ministry is not functioning properly. They should have people who will keep in touch with the respective associations from state and take updates on how their players are performing,"" said Pawar.Somaya said: ""I would fully agree with Chirag and I would quite understand his position. Since he was the only player from Maharashtra, he deserves the recognition. Need not be such a huge amount that they have given to cricketers but in some manner, he should be rewarded. He is seeking recognition from the state government which I think is only natural and I think it will be fair even if the state govt does it now. He is one of the key players from Maharashtra to participate in the Olympics and has a good chance of winning a medal with Satwik.""He also urged the state government to have a ""consistent policy"" to reward the performers from other sports as well. ""They should reward the players as soon as they know that someone from the state has achieved something big. It should be a standard process. A person shouldn't be applying for it. You should make a person feel a sense of pride when a state government recognises a player on their own,"" felt Somaya.","Badminton player Chirag Shetty's comments regarding Maharashtra government ignoring his achievements have stirred up a hornet's nest.
