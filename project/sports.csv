NEW DELHI: Nathan McSweeney has been selected as Australia's new opening batsman for the first Test match of the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy against India. The five-Test series begins in Perth on November 22nd. Wicketkeeper-batsman Josh Inglis was a surprise addition to the 13-man squad, which was revealed on Sunday.Following David Warner 's retirement earlier this year, Australia have been actively searching for a suitable partner to open the batting alongside Usman Khawaja Although veteran Steve Smith temporarily filled the role, he will now return to his usual position at number four, following Marnus Labuschagne . Smith's recent performances as an opener have been less than satisfactory.The leading contender for the opening position was 25-year-old South Australian captain, Nathan McSweeney. McSweeney, who is yet to make his Test debut, has had a strong start to the domestic season and impressive performances in recent Australia A matches against India A.Despite competition from Marcus Harris, Cameron Bancroft, and rising star Sam Konstas, it was McSweeney's unbeaten 88 in Mackay during the first Australia A match that solidified his position.In the second match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, McSweeney was promoted to open the batting but only managed scores of 14 and 25. However, selectors were impressed with his overall form and potential.""Nathan has displayed the attributes we believe will equip him well for Test cricket, along with a strong recent record in domestic cricket,"" said Australia’s chief selector George Bailey. ""His performances for South Australia and Australia A support our view that he is ready for this opportunity at Test level.""Another unexpected inclusion was Josh Inglis, who is primarily known for his white-ball cricket. Despite being previously ruled out as an option to open the batting, Inglis was selected as a backup batsman following his exceptional form in the Sheffield Shield.Inglis has recently scored two centuries in Perth. Bailey confirmed that Inglis' selection was based on his recent form, not as a contender for the opening spot, but as an additional batting option.""Josh has been in great touch in the Sheffield Shield competition and deserves his place in his first Test squad,"" Bailey added.Australia's bowling attack will be spearheaded by the experienced trio of Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, and Mitchell Starc. Nathan Lyon is set to play his 130th Test match. Lyon, who has taken 530 Test wickets, remains Australia’s premier spin bowler. Scott Boland is named as the reserve fast bowler following Michael Neser's injury.Travis Head will bat at number five, while Mitchell Marsh will fill the all-rounder role. Cameron Green has been ruled out of the series due to spinal surgery.The Border-Gavaskar series commences in Perth before heading to Adelaide for a day-night Test. Following Adelaide, the teams will play matches in Brisbane, Melbourne, and Sydney.",Nathan McSweeney has been selected as Australia's new opening batsman for the first Test match of the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy against India.

NEW DELHI: Amid contrasting reports over Rohit Sharma 's availability for the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , former Australia captain Aaron Finch backed the star India opener for taking leave due to personal reasons.Rohit and wife Ritika Sajdeh are expecting their second child and the India captain is likely to miss the Perth Test.However, former India skipper Sunil Gavaskar recently remarked that if Rohit is not able to make it to the first Test, then the Indian team should appoint a new captain for the entire series.""We have been reading that Rohit Sharma will not play in the first Test, perhaps he will not play in the second as well. If this is the case, then I say that, right now, the Indian selection committee should say that 'if you have to rest, rest, if there are personal reasons then look at them. But if you are missing two-thirds of the matches then you should go for this tour only as a player. We will make the vice-captain the captain of this tour',"" Gavaskar had said.Disagreeing with Gavaskar, Finch backed Rohit, saying that birth of a child is special occasion and Rohit can take all the time he needs.""I disagree with Sunny on that totally. Rohit Sharma is the captain of the Indian cricket team. If you need to stay at home because your wife is having a baby... that's such a beautiful moment... and you take all the time that you need in that regard,"" Finch said.On Finch's comments, Ritika on Friday reacted with a salute emoji, that went viral on social media.After suffering an unprecedented home whitewash against New Zealand, the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia, starting on November 22 has become even more crucial for the Indian team.India now need to win 4 out of the five Tests in the upcoming series to qualify for the World Test Championship final without depending on other teams' results.",Rohit Sharma likely to miss first Test of Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia.

Result:

CHENNAI: The landmark 1000th Indian Super League match between Chennaiyin FC and Mumbai City FC on Saturday was a slow burner.After a cagey first-half that ended goalless and had only sprinkles of clear-cut chances, the game sprang to life around the hour-mark. Defenders Ryan Edwards (60th minute) and Nathan Rodrigues (63rd) displayed their attacking prowess for Chennaiyin and Mumbai respectively, before the teams shook hands for a 1-1 stalemate at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium .CFC's search for back-to-back wins continues and they now have 12 points from eight matches, while MCFC extended their unbeaten run to move to 10 points from seven games.In the first period, Vincy Barretto and Wilmar Jordan Gil came closest to opening the scoring for the hosts. Vincy went on a marauding run in a quick counter-attack and opted to shoot instead of finding one of three Chennaiyin attackers who were left unmarked in and around the box. Mumbai goalkeeper Phurba Lachenpa averted the danger with a save.The MCFC custodian then rose high to tip the ball over the bar after Gil's header was heading into the top-corner. Nikos Karelis, the striker at the other end, had a couple of half-chances but could not extend his scoring spree, just like Gil. Tiri's header went just a whisker away from the post, meaning no inroads were made in the first half.In the 60th minute, CFC captain Edwards made the 9,500-odd crowd erupt in jubilation by breaking the deadlock. Connor Shields, who has a penchant for crossing balls from the right flank, delivered a delicious free-kick into the 18-yard box. Centre-back Edwards got on the end of it and came up with a well-directed header that went in off the inside of the far post.Chennaiyin's lead dissipated even before the fans could fully celebrate Edwards' maiden goal of the ISL campaign. In the 63rd minute, Nathan, primarily a left-back, drew the visitors level with a headed goal of his own. Yoell van Nieff unleashed a near-perfect inswinging corner-kick, following which Nathan produced a looping header towards the far post. Having rippled the net in the 4-2 win over Kerala Blasters FC, Nathan made it two goals in as many matches.Both teams had an opportunity each to nick three points in the end. After being picked out in the area, CFC substitute Daniel Chima Chukwu opted for an audacious scissor-kick that went straight to Lachenpa. At the other end, Mumbai did not have a single attacker in the six-yard box when an inviting cross was put in from the left.Chennaiyin FC 1 (Ryan Edwards 60) drew with Mumbai City FC 1 (Nathan Rodrigues 63)",Chennaiyin FC and Mumbai City FC drew 1-1 in the 1000th Indian Super League match.

Mum and Dad were straight on the phone, they were super happy,"" McSweeney told reporters in Melbourne on Sunday.“Hopefully they were very proud, and I can’t wait for the week to come.“I’ve played a few Shield games at the WACA, a couple of T20s at (Perth Stadium) – no doubt the wicket bounces well, and I think it probably suits my game, growing up in Brisbane playing on wickets that are probably not too (dissimilar) to that.""Since David Warner 's retirement in January, there has been no firm contender to partner Khawaja at the top of the order in the blockbuster series starting on November 22. While Steve Smith initially stepped into the role, he failed to shine and will be reverting to his usual number four, behind Marnus Labuschagne.McSweeney scored 14 and 25 in his two innings as an opener in the 'A' match against India in Melbourne but managed to pip in-form Marcus Harris for the opener's slot.""It still probably hasn’t quite sunk in yet. I’m getting a lot of nice messages … a lot of the boys have been on WhatsApp,” he said.Aware of the fact that Khawaja is not a fan of facing first ball of the match, McSweeney said that he comfortable doing anything for the side.“I’ve heard that Uzzie is not the biggest fan of (the first ball) … I faced the first ball in both innings out here, so I’m comfortable with that too, and I’ve already been told that by a couple of the boys.“I just got a text from Travis Head saying, ‘I can give you my bat-pad pads’, so I’ll be straight under there as well I would’ve thought.”McSweeney also highlighted the role of Australia no.3 Labuschagne and the help he provided him at the beginning of his career.“That was a nice phone call to Marnus last night as well. He’s super chuffed for me, and I’m thankful for his knowledge and the way he’s helped me through the start of my career,” McSweeney said.“I can’t wait to be in the same team as him, and hopefully spend some time in the middle together.“He’s a great thinker, or a deep thinker, and (I’ve tried) to pick apart things that work for me and what doesn’t.“At times I probably look similar, and I like to think I’ve got my own way of playing, but definitely using Marnus as a resource, that’s been very helpful for me.”India have beaten Australia in their own backyard twice in the last two series and will be eyeing a hat-trick to secure a spot in the World Test Championship Final.",Nathan McSweeney pips rivals to open for Australia in first Test against India.

Chopra wrote, expressing utter shock.The incident occurred while Harris was on 48, facing a delivery from Kotian that drifted in and seemed to nick his bat before heading to the first slip, where the catch was cleanly taken.However, the on-field umpire, Mike Graham-Smith, dismissed the appeal, leaving India A players visibly frustrated.As Harris stood his ground, commentators observed that the ball had likely edged the bat, though Harris later suggested the sound might have come from his bat brushing his pad.Ultimately, Harris continued his innings, reaching a half-century before being caught behind by Prasidh Krishna on 74.This decision fueled discussions across social media, with Kotian later labelling it as a “horrible” decision.Despite replays, Harris maintained he couldn’t tell if there was an edge, telling cricket.com.au, “If they reviewed it and it showed I hit it and got caught, I would have gone, ‘Yep, fair enough.’”The incident added fuel to the already intense contest, with Australia A holding a 1-0 lead in the series after winning the first match.

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu needed to win by more than 40 goals in the senior nationals men’s hockey championship to qualify for the quarterfinals from Group C. Even they didn’t believe they could do it, but by the end of the day, they did beat Andaman and Nicobar Islands 43-0 at the Mayor Radhakrishnan Stadium on Thursday to make the last-eight stage.

Sanju's nets in Dubai

MUMBAI: At a time when India's batters are struggling both at home and overseas, two wicketkeeper-batsmen have stood out while representing the country in different formats in different parts of the world. Sanju Samson smoked a blazing 50-ball 107 to star in India's 61-run win in the opening T20I against South Africa. Dhruv Jurel slammed twin half-centuries - 80 and 68 - to mark the only bright spot in India's six-wicket defeat to Australia A in Melbourne.Apart from both being 'keeper-batters, there is another thing in common between Samson and Jurel - both play for Rajasthan Royals . Samson is the captain while Jurel has been retained for Rs 14 crore.Both Samson and Jurel train extensively before the IPL , and whenever they get an opportunity, at the Royals' training centre in Talegaon under RR's high-performance director Zubin Bharucha.""Jurel went straight from the Test series at home, where he didn't get a game, to Australia. In our preparation we try and cover high variability,"" Bharucha told TOI.There was a reason the generous green cover on the MCG pitch didn't give Jurel the jitters, even as the other India A batters came a cropper on it. ""Jurel told me that there was 8mm grass on the track at the MCG, but we have been using pitches with 12mm grass in our practice immediately post IPL when Riyan (Parag), Dhruv and Sanju were practicing for the Duleep Trophy (in Oct) at the High Performance Centre in Talegaon,"" Bharucha, said, before explaining RR's training pattern further.""Then as we get closer to IPL we push them onto flatter pitches with 4 to 6mm grass, and create a variety of wicket types to prepare for all opposition.""The Royals also had a hand in preparing Samson for the bouncy pitches in South Africa. ""We had a two-day session with Sanju in Dubai because the ICC Academy's pitches are a little more bouncy, just before he went to South Africa,"" Bharucha revealed, crediting the Royals for having taken the effort to send Samson, himself and a few bowlers to Dubai to enable Samson to tune-up for the SA tour.""RR's investment in these players -they are investing vast sums of money in their development -is phenomenal They flew the bowlers and me from India to Dubai for Samson's practice sessions. It says a lot about the franchise's commitment to the cause of the player,"" praised Bharucha.Explaining RR's philosophy behind investing in a player's preparation for a tour even beyond the IPL, Bharucha said, ""There is an inevitable phase that exists for every player between success and failure. What they do in that phase defines the individual and their career. Our goal as coaches is to transform that space from the fear of failure into a freedom of opportunity for all our players by providing an environment based around the philosophy of high variability and meticulous preparation.""",Sanju Samson and Dhruv Jurel both play for Rajasthan Royals.

BRIEF SCORES

NAGPUR: The Vidarbha team is on a roll this season. After a few tight matches to start with, the former champions are playing, well, like champions do by posting comprehensive victories. After the innings drubbing of Himachal on Saturday, Vidarbha is the only team across the Elite Groups to boast of four wins in as many matches of the season so far.On Saturday, Harsh Dubey played the catalyst as Vidarbha finished off Himachal early in the second session. Dubey, with five wickets in 18 overs he bowled on Day 4, finished the innings with figures of 6-36. With the returns of 11 for 107, his first 10-wicket match haul , Dubey played a key role in dismissing Himachal twice as Vidarbha posted a crushing victory by an innings and 88 runs.Starting the day on 51 for 2, the overnight pair of Ankit Kalsi and nightwatchman Mayank Dagar kept the Vidarbha bowlers at bay for 10 overs. A blow from a fast delivery finally shattered Dagar’s grit as he fell to Praful Hinge soon after.From there on Dubey took over the wicket-taking charge. The young left-arm spinner engineered the downfall of the next four wickets — Kalsi, Ekant Sen, Amit Kumar and skipper Rishi Dhawan — to send Himachal reeling at 114 for 7 at lunch.Post the lunch break, off spinner Akshay Wakhare ended Akash Vasisht’s (34;57b;5x4;1x6) vigil while Dubey trapped Vaibbhav Arora for his sixth wicket. Hinge, who impressed with his pace, put an end to Mukul Negi’s (40;42b;4x3;3x6) cameo and Himachal’s inning with Yash Rathod pouching a well-judged skier.Himachal’s second innings saw Dubey bowling 132 balls, with almost 80% of them, or 108 to be precise, being dots. Himachal batters managed just 4 boundaries in the 22 overs bowled by Dubey in the second innings. Dubey now leads the bowling chart of the season with 34 wickets from 8 innings with an average of 12.38 and strike rate of 32.52.The fourth win in as many matches saw Vidarbha consolidate its position at the top of Elite Group ‘B’. With 25 points in the kitty, the side has a foot in the knockouts. Akshay Wadkar, Vidarbha skipper, though, isn’t allowing the team to let the guard down.“We are taking every opponent seriously. One bad match can change the point table equations. If we top the table, we will get to play the quarterfinal in Nagpur and home advantage will be with us. We want to play good cricket in every game. Apart from winning matches, it also helps in boosting our confidence,” Wadkar said after the match.Batters putting up a big 575 total paved the way for Vidarbha’s win on Saturday. The captain, though, pointed out that every batter scoring runs in the same match is a rarity. “It’s not always possible for the batting unit to click in unison. It happens in a one off match. In most matches one of the batters plays well while others chip in around him,” Wadkar said.Himachal: 307 all out in 108 overs & (overnight 51 for 2 in 15 overs) 180 all in 61.1 overs (Mukul Negi 40, Akash Vasisht 34; Harsh Dubey 6-36; Praful Hinge 2-27, Akshay Wakhare 2-68) lost to Vidarbha: 575 all out by innings & 88 runs. Player of the match: Harsh Dubey.","Harsh Dubey takes 11 wickets for Vidarbha in innings drubbing of Himachal.

Already securing the first-innings lead on Day 3 itself, hosts Assam had to be content with three points from their Ranji Trophy Elite Group D game in Guwahati on Saturday as Tamil Nadu produced a good display of batting on the final day to leave out any possibility of a result other than a draw.Though it did not have any bearing on the outcome of the match, the highlight of the day was TN opener Narayan Jagadeesan notching up his 10th first-class century while Pradosh Ranjan Paul scored a half-century. Both remained unbeaten at the end of the day’s play with TN reaching 217/2 from 60 overs, when both sides mutually decided to shake hands, acknowledging the inevitability of a draw at Barsapara Cricket Stadium .Earlier, resuming their innings at 8/0, Tamil Nadu openers Narayan Jagadeesan and Suresh Lokeshwar strode out to the middle with a steely resolve. Lokeshwar’s stay was short-lived, as he fell prey to Mukhtar Hussain, departing for merely 3 runs. However, this early setback did not deter the resilient Jagadeesan, who anchored the innings with unwavering focus.Joining forces with the seasoned Vijay Shankar, Jagadeesan orchestrated a solid partnership, defying the Assam bowlers with his technique and temperament. Shankar’s breezy 23 off 36 balls provided valuable support before he fell to the Player of the Match, Swarupam Purkayastha, leaving Tamil Nadu at 73/2.Undeterred, Jagadeesan continued his innings, reaching his ton with a composed and elegant knock. The Chennai Super Kings player remained unbeaten on 118, crafted from 188 deliveries, adorned with nine boundaries and a six.Complementing Jagadeesan’s brilliance was the resolute Paul, who remained unbeaten on 68 off 112 balls, laced with five boundaries. The duo’s unbroken 144-run partnership for the fourth wicket showcased their steely resolve. However, the day belonged to Jagadeesan.Assam remained rooted in the last spot of Group D with four points while TN moved up a spot to third with 12 points after fourth round of games.

With this result, Rajasthan stay at the fourth spot with 13 points while Hyderabad slipped from the fifth position to the sixth with eight points.Hyderabad's head coach Vineet Saxena pointed out that the match slipped from their hands in the last session of the third day.

HAMBURG: An incredible long-range goal from Jamal Musiala took Bayern Munich six clear atop the Bundesliga table with a 1-0 win at St Pauli on Saturday, while Borussia Dortmund lost again.St Pauli, promoted in the summer, fought hard against their heavily favoured opponents and wanted to avoid a repeat of the 8-1 thrashing handed out last time Bayern visited.Musiala, who scored the only goal in Wednesday's 1-0 win over Benfica, won the ball near the sideline and dribbled centrally before blasting from just under 30 metres, his shot bouncing in off the crossbar.The 21-year-old now has scored five in his past four games since returning from a hip injury.Bayern are now six points clear at the top of the table on 26 points, but RB Leipzig can cut the gap to three with a win in their home match against Borussia Moenchengladbach later on Saturday.Injury-hit Dortmund suffered yet another setback, losing 3-1 at Mainz after Emre Can was sent off in the 27th minute for a studs-up tackle on Lee Jae-sung.Normally a midfielder, Dortmund's injury crisis had pushed Can into central defence.His replacement after the red card, another midfielder in Felix Nmecha, was at fault nine minutes later when an unmarked Lee headed in.Dortmund's Serhou Guirassy won and converted a penalty to level things up but Jonathan Burkardt put Mainz back in front just before half-time, slamming in a Danny da Costa pass from close range.Paul Nebel added a third early in the second period to put Mainz in the driver's seat for their first home win of the season.Champions League finalists last season, Dortmund are struggling this year, particularly away from home, having lost their past six games in all competitions.Bayer Leverkusen 's title defence continued to stutter with a 1-1 draw at last-placed Bochum, who equalised in the final minute.Leverkusen were ahead from the 18th minute onwards after Florian Wirtz slid a ball across the turf and into the path of Patrik Schick, who blasted home.The visitors seemed on track for victory until Bochum's Koji Miyoshi popped up to grab a loose ball after a mistake from Jonathan Tah and slide it in at the near post.Leverkusen are now nine points behind Bayern and have dropped 13 points this campaign, more than they did across all 34 games last season.The draw was just Bochum's second point this season after 10 games in their first match under veteran coach Dieter Hecking.Elsewhere, Werder Bremen won 2-1 at home against Holstein Kiel thanks to an 89th-minute goal from Oliver Burke after Phil Harres' second-half strike cancelled out Jens Stage's opener for the hosts just after the half-hour.","Bayern Munich beat St Pauli 1-0 to go six points clear at the top of the Bundesliga table. Jamal Musiala scored the only goal with a long-range strike from just under 30 metres. Borussia Dortmund lost 3-1 at home to Mainz after having Emre Can sent off. Bayer Leverkusen drew 1-1 with last-placed Bochum, who equalised in the final minute.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115121603,imgsize-65668,width-400,resizemode-4/115121603.jpg"
Odisha aim to get out of the rut against Bagan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/odisha-aim-to-get-out-of-the-rut-against-bagan/articleshow/115121015.cms,"Odisha FC have not had a good start to the 11th season of Indian Super League . After seven games, the team from Bhuabaneswar finds them on the ninth spot in the 13-team league table with just two wins and eight points. In their last game at NorthEast United, the Juggernauts suffered a 2-3 defeat thanks to missed chances and defensive errors.When the Juggernauts take on Mohun Bagan Super Giant in a home game at Kalinga Stadium on Sunday evening, it will be a challenging task for their porous defence to keep the Kolkata heavyweights under control. After playing six games, Mohun Bagan are presently on second spot with 13 points, behind leaders Bengaluru FC and come into the game on a hat-trick of wins.While both teams have scored 12 goals each, the difference lies in the goals conceded.The green and maroon brigade has let in only seven times – joint second least in the league – compared to Odisha’s 13, joint third most with FC Goa. And the Sergio Lobera-coached side has failed to keep a clean sheet so far.But Lobera is unperturbed by the fact. “The biggest target for me is not to get a clean sheet. The biggest target for me is to score one goal more than the opponent team. The problem is we are scoring goals, but we are conceding too – not only goals, but clear chances to the opponent,” Lobera said ahead of the game in Bhubaneswar on Saturday.“We need to improve about this. Also, we cannot concede two goals, three goals every game. Finally, we need to try to find a balance between attack and defence. We need to improve in defensive situations. We cannot concede a lot of chances for the opponent teams, and also goals.”However, the Spanish coach is banking on his boys to maximise the home conditions and turn the tables on their much-fancied opponents.“We know perfectly the opponent. They are a very strong team in this competition always. But we have our tools. We showed this last season in AFC Cup, finishing top of the table and unfortunately lost the semifinals in the last moment. We want to win our home game and we can do it, we need to trust ourselves. I have trust in my players. Kalinga always have something special. We lost only one game this season (the opener) and the last season (combined). I am hopeful we can go into the international break with three points to our name,” Lobera said.After serving a suspension in the last game Lobera will be back in the dugout with full squad at his disposal, but playmaker Greg Stewart’s freak injury will keep MBSG a bit worried.However, MBSG coach Jose Molina eyes nothing short of full points from the away game. “They might not be at their best, but Odisha are a really good team, really good players, really good coach. We can’t allow them (OFC) to play their best football . I expect us to have a good match and hopefully we can win it and bring the three points to Kolkata and go into the break in a happy mood,” Molina said ahead of the game.","Odisha FC have not had a good start to the 11th season of Indian Super League.

MADRID: Vinicius Junior scored a hat-trick to help Real Madrid bounce back from two consecutive home defeats with a 4-0 win over Osasuna in La Liga on Saturday.Hammered by Barcelona in a league Clasico and then outplayed by AC Milan in the Champions League, Carlo Ancelotti's side badly needed this confidence-boosting victory at the Santiago Bernabeu.The Spanish and European champions thrashed Osasuna thanks to Vinicius' treble, while Jude Bellingham scored his first goal of the season for Los Blancos.However, Madrid's superstar striker Kylian Mbappe failed to find the net again and has scored one goal in his last seven matches, while Brazilian duo Eder Militao and Rodrygo were taken off injured along with Lucas Vazquez.Second-placed Madrid reigned in Barcelona's lead at the top of La Liga to six points before the Catalans visit Real Sociedad on Sunday.""We won by a margin, we had a complete game in terms of work and effort, looking out for our team-mates, so I'm happy for the win that we needed,"" Madrid attacker Brahim Diaz told Real Madrid TV.""Madrid always have to win and we'd suffered two consecutive defeats...""The fans deserved a victory, we can still give more, we are an incredible team.""Ancelotti brought Rodrygo into the line-up after the Milan defeat, reverting to a 4-3-3 formation.The Brazilian winger drew a save from Sergio Herrera but was forced off with a knee problem during an intense start to the match.Militao was taken off on a stretcher before the half-hour mark holding the back of his right knee, after going to ground in Osasuna's area.The defender missed most of last season with a severe knee injury and with David Alaba, Aurelien Tchouameni and Dani Carvajal out hurt already, his departure was particularly bad news for Madrid.Ancelotti replaced Militao with 21-year-old defender Raul Asencio, making his debut after progressing through the youth academy.Despite the setbacks, Madrid took the lead in the 34th minute when Bellingham teed up Vinicus, who whipped home at the near post.England international Bellingham, whose goals were vital for Madrid last season, broke his duck this campaign with a fine lob after Asencio played a fine long ball to send him running through on goal.Vinicius netted his second after Real Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin, in for the injured Thibaut Courtois, found the forward with a long ball and he rounded the goalkeeper to finish.The Brazilian finished second in the Ballon d'Or voting despite being favourite to win the award at the end of October, losing out to Manchester City midfielder Rodri, but soon completed his second hat-trick in four games.Brahim Diaz won the ball back deep in Osasuna territory and teed up Vinicius for a simple finish to complete the rout.After Vinicius was replaced in the final stages Mbappe could play in his preferred position on the left flank but was unable to find the net as his personal travails continued, even as Madrid's abated.Los Blancos' clean sheet helped end a run of nine goals conceded in three consecutive home matches.Once Madrid had opened the scoring Osasuna, fifth, faded rapidly.""We lacked intensity, rhythm... it was a game to forget,"" admitted Osasuna's Jon Moncayola, speaking to DAZN.""(It was) 4-0 and they could even have scored more.""","Real Madrid beat Osasuna 4-0 in La Liga. Vinicius Junior scores a hat-trick. Jude Bellingham scores his first goal of the season. Eder Militao, Rodrygo and Lucas Vazquez injured.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115119935,imgsize-58072,width-400,resizemode-4/115119935.jpg"

Coyle urges organisers to introduce VAR

CHENNAI: The Chennaiyin FC-Mumbai City FC fixture at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here on Saturday will go down in Indian Super League (ISL) history as the competition unlocked the 1,000-match milestone. The ISL, launched in 2014 with eight clubs, is the country’s top-tier men’s league and is into its 11th season comprising 13 teams.The league has helped Indian players rub shoulders with quality foreigners – while ‘marquee’ signings, including World Cuppers, made their presence felt in the early editions, younger overseas recruits have set the stage on fire in recent seasons. With a continental spot on offer in the ISL, the clubs are ambitious and the level of professionalism is increasing.Chennaiyin left-back Mandar Rao Dessai , who can be considered as ‘Mr ISL’ having played every season, is delighted to be part of the journey. “I am very happy to be involved in the 1,000th game because I have been here from the start. It is great to be part of this competition for so many years,” Mandar said ahead of CFC’s clash against Mumbai.“I played with big names like Andre Santos, Robert Pires and Lucio (at his former club FC Goa) when they came to the ISL in the first two years. We had great coaches like Zico (also at Goa). I have learnt a lot of things from them on and off the pitch,” added the 32-year-old Mandar, an ISL Shield winner with both Goa and Mumbai.According to Mandar, the level of football in India has grown over the years but there is room for “a lot of improvement”. Chennaiyin FC head coach Owen Coyle, who has worked in five of the 11 ISL seasons, concurred, saying: “It is remarkable how far we have come, but it takes time to build things. The league is earning its way and getting better.”Many Indian players have shone in the ISL but have struggled to cope with the demands of international football after earning call-ups – the national team has disappointed in key tournaments, including the Asian Cup and the World Cup qualifiers.“One thing for me is the development of the Indian players. Growing and developing young Indian players is part of the ISL. We are taking huge steps in terms of organisation. I have been all over the world. The surfaces here… the stadiums are really good. The fans get behind their teams. There are a lot of good things happening in the ISL,” Coyle added.Coyle urged the organisers to introduce Video Assistant Referee (VAR), which will help minimise errors. “A big addition that we need is VAR for two reasons – to help the referees and get things right. We need to get the Key Match Incidents (KMI) right. I am all for VAR. It will take an extra minute to make a decision, but there will be a far higher percentage of correct decisions. What you do not want is playing well in a game but losing because of a decision (wrong one). That is one thing we can get better at,” said Coyle.","Chennaiyin FC-Mumbai City FC fixture will go down in Indian Super League (ISL) history as the competition unlocked the 1,000-match milestone.

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are set to further their emerging rivalry when the ATP Finals commence on Sunday, marking the first time in 23 years that the event will be held without any of the Big Three.Sinner, the top-ranked player, and No. 3 Alcaraz each claimed two Grand Slam titles this year, so a matchup between them in Turin would be fitting.In the draw on Thursday , Sinner and Alcaraz were placed in separate groups. Sinner will compete in the Ilie Nastase Group alongside Daniil Medvedev, Taylor Fritz, and Alex de Minaur, while Alcaraz will be in the John Newcombe Group with Alexander Zverev, Casper Ruud, and Andrey Rublev. The top two players from each group will advance to the semifinals following the round-robin stage.After withdrawing from last week's Paris Masters due to illness, Sinner arrived in Turin early to prepare. “For me, this is the main event of the end of the year,” he stated.Notably absent is defending champion Novak Djokovic, who withdrew on Tuesday due to an unspecified injury . This is the first year since 2001 that the finals will occur without at least one of Djokovic, Roger Federer, or Rafael Nadal. Additionally, this season also marks the first time since 2002 that no member of that trio has won a Grand Slam title.Djokovic holds the record for the most ATP Finals victories, having won seven times and defeating Sinner in the final last year. Federer, who retired in 2022, won the event six times, while Nadal, who will retire after the Davis Cup next week, was a finalist twice but never secured a title.“It’s strange not to see Novak here, given all his success,” Zverev remarked. “When I won in 2018, you needed to defeat at least two of the top three players. It feels different now. But with Jannik and Carlos emerging, the focus has shifted to new talent. You have to overcome them to win big tournaments. They've both won two Grand Slams this year and undoubtedly rank among the best players in the world.”As the sole Italian in the competition, Sinner will attract significant attention, particularly since this is his first home appearance following the announcement of positive drug tests earlier this year before his US Open title.The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) appealed a decision exonerating Sinner, and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) is expected to issue a ruling early next year. Sinner expressed uncertainty over updates, emphasising his positive outlook despite the challenging circumstance.Alcaraz has defeated Sinner in all three of their official meetings this year and currently leads their overall head-to-head 6-4.Sinner's year started with an Australian Open victory — the first Grand Slam title for an Italian man since Adriano Panatta's 1976 French Open win. Alcaraz subsequently secured the French Open and Wimbledon titles, bringing his career total to four Grand Slams. Sinner later triumphed at the US Open. Notably, Sinner defeated Alcaraz during the Six Kings Slam exhibition in Saudi Arabia last month.Zverev, who has previously won the finals in London in 2018 and in Turin in 2021, seeks to claim his third title. Medvedev, the only other player in the field with a finals win, lifted the trophy in 2020.Zverev arrives in promising form following a title victory at the Paris Masters , which propelled him past Alcaraz to No. 2 in the rankings.Fritz aims to build on his maiden Grand Slam final appearance in New York, Ruud was a finalist in 2022, De Minaur is making his debut in the tournament, and Rublev is competing for the fifth consecutive year.The ATP Finals, featuring the top eight singles players and doubles teams, begins on November 10 and runs until November 17.The ATP Finals will be contested in Turin, Italy for the fourth consecutive year. The event will take place at the Inalpi Arena.Ilie Nastase Group: Jannik Sinner (1), Daniil Medvedev (4), Taylor Fritz (5), Alex de Minaur (7)John Newcombe Group: Alexander Zverev (2), Carlos Alcaraz (3), Casper Ruud (6), Andrey Rublev (8)Bob Bryan Group: Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic (1), Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori (4), Rohan Bopanna and Matthew Ebden (6), Kevin Krawietz and Tim Puetz (8)zverevMike Bryan Group: Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos (2), Wesley Koolhof and Nikola Mektic (3), Max Purcell and Jordan Thompson (5), Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten (7)The champion of the ATP Finals will receive $4.8 million, the largest prize in men’s tennis history. This amount surpasses the earnings from Sinner and Alcaraz’s Grand Slam victories this year, with Sinner earning $3.6 million for the US Open and Alcaraz $3.45 million (or £2.7 million) for Wimbledon.The singles and doubles competitions will take place in a round-robin format. The players and teams will play each other(s) once and the top two in singles/doubles will advance to the semi-finals. The top player/team from each group will face the No. 2 placed player/team in the other group.The ATP Finals 2024 will be available on TV on Sony Sports Network in India.The tournament will be live streamed on SonyLiv app and website in India.","The ATP Finals will take place in Turin, Italy, for the fourth consecutive year.

Riyadh:

Defending WTA Finals champion Iga Swiatek was eliminated from the season-ending championship on Thursday after Barbora Krejcikova's 7-5 6-4 win over Coco Gauff meant the Polish world number two failed to advance to the last four.Gauff was already guaranteed to make the semis, but five-times Grand Slam champion Swiatek needed the American to beat eighth-seeded Czech Krejcikova who required a victory herself to progress.The 13th-ranked Krejcikova took a tight first set, which lasted 54 minutes, after saving four break points, wrapping it up with a powerful backhand that zipped down the line.Former US Open champion Gauff, who had not dropped a set in the tournament before the contest, was hurt by unforced errors — 23 alone in the opener.The second set was once again a close affair, but the Wimbledon champion held her nerve to secure the win in one hour and 42 minutes.""This is a big win for me and really happy with how I played and it was a really good match,"" the 27-year-old Krejcikova said. ""It's tough, it was up and down. The Wimbledon victory is the highest point in my career so far.""Being here and reaching the semi-final, it's something unimaginable.

Coco Gauff posted a rare victory over Iga Swiatek to punch her ticket to the semi-finals of the WTA Finals in Riyadh on Tuesday, ensuring Aryna Sabalenka will finish the year as the world number one Swiatek, the defending champion, was in a direct battle with Sabalenka for the top spot this week but needed a win over Gauff to keep her chances alive of leapfrogging her Belarusian rival.Gauff, 20, entered the contest having lost 11 of her 12 previous meetings with Swiatek, with the American's sole victory coming in Cincinnati last year.But she turned the tables on Swiatek on Tuesday, defeating the second seed 6-3, 6-4 to make it two straight-sets wins from two round-robin matches in Riyadh this week.""It feels great. I knew going into the match that despite our head-to-head I had a lot of confidence going in,"" said Gauff, who hit 11 double faults during the one-hour 48-minute showdown.With the exception of the opening game of the match, Gauff had break point opportunities in every Swiatek service game in the first set.The American third seed made her move in game seven, breaking for 4-3, and she closed out the set with a second break of serve, taking the lead in 49 minutes.Swiatek needed six break points in a marathon third game of the second set to finally take down the Gauff serve but she couldn't consolidate her advantage.They traded breaks again, as Gauff's double-fault tally went up to double digits and Swiatek racked up the errors.It was Gauff who eventually steadied the ship, and wrapped up the victory on Swiatek's 47th unforced error of the match.Swiatek, a five-time major champion, admits her two-month break between the US Open and the WTA Finals and the fact she is playing her first tournament with her new coach Wim Fissette have made things ""a bit more tricky and different than usual"".""But I'll force myself to work even better in the next match,"" the Pole added.Earlier in the day, Barbora Krejcikova ended Jessica Pegula's chances of qualifying for the semi-finals, defeating the sixth-seeded American 6-3, 6-3.A runner-up at the WTA Finals last year, Pegula suffered her second straight-sets defeat of the week and enters her final round-robin match against Swiatek on Thursday anchoring the Orange Group with zero sets won.Eighth-seeded Krejcikova bounced back from her opening loss to Swiatek to keep her hopes of making the final four alive.""I was fighting for every ball and I felt that I really have to play my best tennis and I was trying to be really solid and trying to put as many balls to the other side as I could,"" said Krejcikova, who picked up just her 20th match win of the season.""I'm definitely proud.

Aryna Sabalenka was assured of the year-end World No. 1 spot in the WTA rankings for the first time when Iga Swiatek lost at the WTA Finals on Tuesday.Sabalenka, 26, was assured of finishing the season atop the WTA rankings without swinging her racket, thanks to Coco Gauff's 6-3, 6-4 win against Swiatek at the season-ending tournament in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.A year ago, in September, Sabalenka briefly displaced Swiatek at the top of the standings for the first time, but relinquished the place when the Polish player won the WTA Finals in Cancun.This time, Sabalenka was already in pole position after Swiatek took a break from competition after the US Open.The Belarussian is 56-12 this season with four titles, including the Australian and US Opens to raise her major championship total to three. Her first came at the 2023 Australian Open.Sabalenka's game is laden with powerful — if once-erratic — serve and intimidating groundstrokes; her forehand speeds at the US Open this year were higher than every other woman and man in the tournament. But lately she has added elements of touch and variety to her game.“It’s really good to have these options in your pocket. Like sometimes, you don’t feel your best on the baseline, and you can just go for a slice or a drop shot or come to the net. I mean, I’ve been always working on this variation on the court,” Sabalenka said after defeating Jessica Pegula 7-5, 7-5 in the U.S. Open final in September. “I’m really glad that I’m brave enough to use these tools.”The WTA also announced that Katerina Siniakova will finish at No. 1 in the year-end doubles rankings. The Czech player topped the doubles rankings at the close of 2018, 2021 and 2022, too.","Aryna Sabalenka is assured of the year-end World No. 1 spot in the WTA rankings for the first time.
