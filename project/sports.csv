Could Bill Belichick Replace Nick Sirianni And Step Away From His UNC Contract?

Only a few days ago, details emerged about veteran NFL coach Bill Belichick ’s 5-year contract for North Carolina at $10 million per year. But NFL pundit Colin Cowherd who hosts a talk show on Fox Sports recently teased the idea that it would be quite easy for Belichick to get out of the UNC contract and return to the NFL if the league wanted him back.On Friday's edition of The Herd, Cowherd addressed the recent altercation that Philadelphia Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni had with Washington Commanders tight end Zach Ertz, during which the duo had to be physically separated by security. Following the Commanders' 36-33 win over the Eagles last week, Ertz and Sirianni got into a heated postgame exchange. The ex-Eagles tight end played for Sirianni in the latter’s first year in Philadelphia but was traded midseason to the Cardinals.Cowherd believes that Sirianni may not be the best fit for Philadelphia any more for a rather simple reason. “At some point, this is a proud organization, and remember, Philadelphia is a highly emotional city to begin with. So you know having a highly emotional coach is not great,” Cowherd said. Cowherd believes Sirianni may not be suitable to lead as a head coach in an emotionally charged city like Philadelphia which has a rather strong attachment to its home team.Sirianni has in the past been involved in similar incidents where he had to be contained and though fans have often tried to find humour in them, Cowherd thinks the management might soon step in. ""This is my hot take. If Philadelphia loses in the first round or the second round, Bill Belichick can get out of his contract in July,"" Cowherd said. ""That's my hot take... Belichick knows that there are two jobs that are fascinating: Philly and Buffalo. If Sean McDermott gets bounced early, that job will be looking for a coach. If Nick Sirianni gets bounced early...""Also Read: Bill Belichick’s career shift to UNC met with controversy, but his 24 year old girlfriend Belichick is famously stoic on the field and garnered a rather positive reputation for never letting success get to his head. Broadly speaking, a coach like Belichick would fit in perfectly with the Philadelphia Eagles. It’s rare for a head coach to get fired after leading a team to the playoffs. But if there was an exception, that would be now before a coaching figure like Belichick signs on the dotted line for the next 3-5 years.It’s no secret that Sirianni handed off play calling during the 2021 season to his offensive coordinator Shane Steichen and this makes the HC quite expendable. Sirianni’s prowess was scrutinised when Philadelphia did not appear prepared for its Week 4 matchup with Tampa Bay and some experts believe Sirianni may have overstayed his welcome with the Eagles.","NFL pundit Colin Cowherd believes that Nick Sirianni may not be the best fit for Philadelphia any more.

Will Broncos QB Bo Nix Be Playing In Saturday’s Game Against The Bengals?

Bo Nix Says He’s Good To Go Amid Challenging Weather Predictions For Broncos vs Bengals Game

It has been a while since the Denver Broncos have made the playoffs and they are set to face the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 17 on Saturday, December 28 at Paycor Stadium in Cincinnati. The game will be televised on NFL Network at 4:25 p.m. ET and fans can also catch it on DirecTV Stream. Broncos rookie quarterback Bo Nix had a limited presence in the Broncos' Thursday practice and fans have wondered if he is still reeling from his back injury. So, the big question is, will Nix play in the game this weekend?Yes, Bo Nix will most likely play in the game this weekend. Nix is not listed on the injury report this week, so unless there are any new setbacks, he is on track to play on Saturday. The quarterback was seen applying a heating pad to his back during the fourth quarter of Denver's face-off against the Las Vegas Raiders a few days ago. As per reports, Nix suffered the injury on his second touchdown pass of the game to Courtland Sutton.Nix has played in all 12 games this season. With the Cincinnati vs Bengals game likely to be played in the rain and wind, the pressure is riding high for Nix since he struggled under bad weather in one game last season, which also happened to be one of the most unfortunate seasons for the Broncos. But expectations are high when it comes to the former Oregon Duck who’s responsible for two of the five best fantasy QB performances against the Chargers this season.Nix himself does not seem to be concerned with the weather predictions. “If you’ve played football, you have play(ed) in the rain,” the QB said. “We’re excited. I thought we ran the ball well against the Jets that day. We’re going to have to carry that over [and] have an open mindset and do whatever’s working.” “We’ll be able to handle the rain. We’re professionals, and they have to play in it too. It’s going to be good. It’s going to be a good environment. It will be fun,” he added.Also Read: Ex-Super Bowler sure, 'Ain't nobody trying to watch Bo Nix,' backs Joe Burrow over the rookie QB Luckily the forecast has now changed with AccuWeather calling for “occasional rain” with 7-20 mph wind gusts and reports suggest that the heaviest rain will hold off until after the game. The game against the Bengals is a great opportunity for Nix since he can explore his chops against the Cincy offense.Last Thursday, during the game against the Chargers, Nix protected the ball well and he has also managed five interceptions in a two-game stretch. Another clean performance by Nix and things could look up for the Broncos.","Broncos rookie quarterback Bo Nix had a limited presence in the Broncos' Thursday practice and fans have wondered if he is still reeling from his back injury.

MAVERICKS at SUNS | FULL GAME HIGHLIGHTS | December 27, 2024

When and where to watch the Phoenix Suns vs Golden State Warriors game tonight (December 28, 2024)?

Phoenix Suns star, Devin Booker has once again been ruled out of his team’s upcoming game against the Golden State Warriors . Booker has missed the Suns’ last four games, out of which they have only managed to win one against the Denver Nuggets. Booker will again be on the sidelines as he is still struggling with a left groin strain that is expected to keep him out for a while more.Here’s what Mike Budenholzer had to say about Booker’s progress, “He's making good progress. We feel good about it. He's still got a little more to go, but he's progressing as expected.” When speaking about Grayson Allen, Budenholzer simply said that he is recovering well and will be evaluated in 24 hours.Missing two guards like Devin Booker and Grayson Allen doesn’t bode well for the Suns. Especially, since they heavily rely on play calls for a good part of their offense. Moreover, Booker is instrumental to the team’s offense as he averages 25.1 points, 3.7, and 6.4 assists for his team.However, Kevin Durant has picked up a big chunk of the attack in Booker’s absence. Over the last four games, KD has averaged 32 points a night. If it wasn’t for him, the Suns would’ve undoubtedly lost all four games they’ve played without Booker. However, the Slim Reaper is 36 years old and has lost a step over the past few years.Durant will not be able to lift the Suns alone, even though he scored 35 against the Mavericks, it wasn’t enough to pull off a victory. So Phoenix will be hoping that Booker returns to the lineup soon. Without him, the entire ship falls apart, and the longer he stays out, the worse their chances of making the playoffs this year.Apart from Durant and Booker, what is also important for the Suns is to sign a solid defender who can score 15+ points on a nightly basis. Hopefully, the Suns will be able to make some moves before the trade deadline. With another solid piece on the board, the Suns might end up surprising the league this season.ALSO READ: Golden State Warriors vs Phoenix Suns (12/28): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, Game Prediction, Betting Tips, How to Watch, and More The Phoenix Suns will be traveling to the Chase Center to take on the Golden State Warriors at 8:30 PM ET on Saturday, December 28, 2024.

How Nitish Kumar Reddy's father sacrificed for his son's cricket career,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/how-nitish-kumar-reddys-father-sacrificed-for-his-sons-cricket-career/articleshow/116736333.cms,"Nitish Kumar Reddy and his father (Photo: Agency/video grab)

Nitish Kumar Reddy's family reacts to his maiden Test century at MCG

Nitish Kumar Reddy , India's latest Test centurion, owes his place among India's cricket heroes to the sacrifices made by his father, Mutyala Reddy , who incidentally was present at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday and watched his son score a well-deserved maiden international and Test hundred.The climax of Nitish's century came amid high-drama on the closing stages of third day's play in the fourth Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy . And when he hit Scott Boland straight for a four to reach the three-figure mark, the father had his arms in the air and tears in his eyes, as those around an emotional Mutyala congratulated him.On the ground, Nitish got down on one knee, put his helmet on the bat handle, and looked skywards to thank the almighty. And as he walked back, at 105 not out, the entire Indian squad lined up at the boundary ropes -- led by their beaming skipper Rohit Sharma, applauding the 21-year-old all-rounder.But to reach this stage was not easy, at least not until Nitish realised the meaning of sacrifices his father continued to make while backing his son's dream to play for India.""To be honest, I was not serious when I was young,' Nitish said in a video on BCCI.tv. ""My father left his job for me and there has been a lot of sacrifice behind my story. One day, I saw him crying because of the financial problems we were facing, and I was like, 'this is not how you can be'. Then I got serious. I gave my first jersey to him and saw the happiness in his face.""At the age-group tournaments in Andhra Pradesh, the boy from Visakhapatnam caught the eye of former India wicketkeeper and selector MSK Prasad, before he started training at the Andhra Cricket Academy. He made a name for himself with his knock of 441 against Nagaland in the Vijay Merchant Trophy 2016-17, besides taking 26 wickets in the tournament, which introduced him as a batting all-rounder with a lot of potential.This was after Mutyala was told, following Nitish's inconsistent show during his first year in district-level cricket, that his son was not a good enough player and should focus on his academic career instead.But instead, Mutyala found ways to help his son improve by training at better-equipped facilities like the Municipal Stadium in Visakhapatnam and Pothinamallaya Palem.Three years after making his first-class debut for Andhra Pradesh, Nitish's all-round skills earned him an Indian Premier League (IPL) contract with the Sunrisers Hyderabad, which became his ticket to the Indian team. Bought for his base price of Rs 20 lakh in 2023, Reddy came into his own when given regular chances to play in the 2024 IPL season, and his crucial innings with the bat contributed in taking the Sunrisers to the playoffs.In October this year, he made his international debut against Bangladesh in a T20I and then was retained by SRH for a contract worth Rs 6 crore.In between he received his maiden Test call-up for the Border Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, which surprised a few; but he ended those doubts over his red-ball credentials with a consistent show, especially with the bat, in four Tests now.With 284 runs in six innings so far at an average of 71.00, Reddy is currently India's top scorer of this BGT.The vindication came on Saturday, when his maiden Test hundred not only confirmed him as the new find of Indian cricket but also bailed India out of trouble.But it wasn't without the 'nervous 90s' drama, which saw Nitish losing Washington Sundar first and then Jasprit Bumrah to leave him one run away and India at 350 for 9. But Mohammed Siraj played out three deliveries from Pat Cummins, which gave the strike back to Reddy, who didn't waste the chance and reached his century.""We are all very, very proud and happy,"" said Reddy's sister, who had arived from India, along with their mother and father, to Melbourne for this Test alone. ""We came for this match only, and it (the century) happened in this match. Of course, we were all tense, but we were sure he will make it.""The overwhelmed father was barely able to speak. ""First hundred, against Autralia, a very big team. So it's a special day.""","Nitish Kumar Reddy scores maiden Test century for India against Australia. The 21-year-old all-rounder is India's latest Test centurion. His father, Mutyala Reddy, was present at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Nitish's all-round skills earned him an IPL contract with Sunrisers Hyderabad.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116736428,imgsize-54238,width-400,resizemode-4/116736428.jpg"

against the LA Clippers on December 27, 2024, as the team continues to manage his bilateral knee issues. The Warriors are strategically resting their star player ahead of Saturday's crucial game against the Phoenix Suns.The knee problems have plagued Curry since November 18, coincidentally after a previous game against the Clippers. This marks his fifth absence this season, though the Warriors have shown remarkable resilience without their leading scorer, maintaining a 4-1 record in games he's missed.Just two days ago, Stephen Curry demonstrated his exceptional scoring ability with a 38-point performance in a Christmas Day matchup against the LA Lakers. The game showed his return to form as he drained eight three-pointers, including two clutch shots that tied the game in the final moments. However, the Warriors ultimately fell short when Austin Reaves secured the Lakers' victory with a game-winning layup.Prior to his Christmas Day resurgence, Curry had been experiencing a notable shooting slump. He averaged just 14.0 points across three games while shooting an uncharacteristic 29% from the field. His bounce-back performance against the Lakers signaled a welcome return to form for the Warriors' offensive catalyst.The timing of Stephen Curry's absence comes during a challenging stretch for Golden State, who have managed only three wins in their last 14 games. The team will rely heavily on Andrew Wiggins, Jonathan Kuminga, and Dennis Schroder to fill the offensive void against the Clippers.The Warriors' medical staff continues to take a cautious approach with their superstar's knee management, prioritizing his long-term availability over short-term gains. This strategy reflects the team's focus on maintaining Curry's health for crucial upcoming matchups and the remainder of the season.The Warriors-Clippers game will test Golden State's depth and adaptability, as they look to improve their position in a highly competitive Western Conference. While Curry's absence presents a significant challenge, the team's positive record without him suggests they've developed effective strategies to compete even when their primary scorer is unavailable.Also read: Golden State Warriors vs Los Angeles Clippers (12/27) game preview: Projected starters, prediction, best betting props, odds and betting lines, injury report, how to watch, and more This table includes the players' names, jersey numbers, positions, and their average points (PTS), rebounds (REB), and assists (AST).","Stephen Curry will miss the Golden State Warriors' matchup against the Los Angeles Clippers.

New York Jets WR Davante Adams is looking forward to catching Aaron Rodgers' 500th career touchdown pass,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/new-york-jets-wr-davante-adams-is-looking-forward-to-catching-aaron-rodgers-500th-career-touchdown-pass/articleshow/116729097.cms,"Image via Imagn Images

Devante Adams suggested that he could catch Aaron Rodgers 500th career touchdown pass

Wide receiver Davante Adams of the New York Jets is looking forward to catching Aaron Rodgers ' 500th career touchdown pass. Rodgers needs one more touchdown pass to reach the milestone, while Adams spent eight years with the Green Bay Packers , becoming a star on teams that made deep playoff runs but ultimately fell short of a Super Bowl victory.The 32-year-old, who began 2024 with the Las Vegas Raiders, was acquired by the Jets in a trade on October 15. He didn't turn New York's season around, but on an individual level, Adams improved with the Jets, averaging 79.9 receiving yards per game compared to 69.7 yards with the Raiders.In two weeks, the New York Jets will conclude their woeful 2024 season of 4-11 with their final two contests. Despite having Aaron Rodgers in good health and getting reinforcements for the offense coming over in a mid-season trade for Davante Adams, the Jets have often lost games. At season's end, many people will wonder if Davante Adams and Aaron Rodgers have futures in New York City.Speaking with reporters, Adams suggested that he could catch Rodgers 500th career touchdown pass, as he currently stands at 499. “Obviously I would love that. I got 200, I got 400, so it would be dope to get 500 as well,” Adams said. “I think 200 was my first [touchdown]. We’ve had some special connections in the past.” ""We've had some special connections in the past, so it'd be great,"" Adams said, via Cimini. ""And, obviously, it would be a big, big thing for him. Not that he needs more accolades and more milestones, but you might as well keep racking them up while you can.”On October 15, 2024, the Raiders traded quarterback Aaron Adams to the New York Jets for a 2025 conditional draft selection. The Jets were eliminated from playoff contention after a loss to the Dolphins in overtime, making the latter condition unfulfilled. Adams was reunited with Aaron Rodgers, whom he played with from 2014 to 2021 with the Green Bay Packers.Adams debuted with the Jets on October 20 in a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, catching three passes for 30 yards during the first half but his team lost 37-15. In Week 9, Adams left the game for head injury evaluation and later returned in the fourth quarter to catch a 37-yard touchdown pass, securing a 21-13 victory. In Week 15, Adams exploded for 198 yards and two touchdowns on nine receptions, including a career-long 71-yard score, as the Jets won 32-25, snapping a four-game losing streak. Meanwhile, he became the 12th receiver in NFL history to reach 100 career receiving touchdowns.Also Read: Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers handed out multiple expensive Christmas gifts to his offensive line, estimated at around $8,500 The Jets have not lived up to their expectations this season, yet they have had flashes of brilliance, such as against the Jaguars, where Adams had nine receptions, 198 yards, and two touchdowns. New York will conclude their 2024 campaign with a game against the Buffalo Bills and a home game against the Miami Dolphins, though the Jets' playoff hopes are done. However, Rodgers and Adams get an opportunity to work their magic before the end of the season.","New York Jets wide receiver Davante Adams is looking forward to catching Aaron Rodgers'500th career touchdown pass.

The Hit That Stopped the Game



L.A. Chargers Seize On Momentum



A promising rookie season was ruined by injuries.



The Good News: Maye Returns



Fans Are Going Gaga On X



Key Takeaways for the Patriots



It was a heart-stopping moment for Patriots fans during their game against the Chargers when rookie quarterback Drake Maye walked off the field after a brutal helmet-to-helmet collision. Here's how the incident unfolded and what it could mean for Maye and the Patriots.Drake Maye, agile as ever, scrambled to the sideline and stepped out of bounds before Chargers defensive back Cam Hart delivered a jarring helmet-to-helmet hit . Though contact was apparent, officials didn't throw a flag for what appeared to be an illegal hit, leaving fans and analysts speechless.The blow required Maye to be out of the game to go in for evaluation in the locker room. The Patriots found themselves in a tight corner since veteran backup Jacoby Brissett took over, playing under center.As if the hit wasn't bad enough for the Patriots, the Chargers quickly seized the moment. On the ensuing drive, wide receiver Derius Davis made a jaw-dropping touchdown catch, putting the Chargers up 7-0 early in the game.Brissett, the Patriots' QB1 through the first month of the season before Maye was thrust into the role of the primary guy, was game to steady the ship. Still, all eyes were on Maye's status as the Patriots worked to adjust their game plan.Drake Maye has been a revelation for the Patriots this season, filling in as the starting quarterback and infusing new life into the team. However, this is the second time this season that Maye has left a game with a head injury, which is concerning for the young QB and the Patriots' long-term plans.Head injuries are no laughing matter in the NFL, and fans feared the worst when Maye walked into the locker room. Was this the start of another concussion for the rookie?The Patriots received good news just a few hours after Maye's departure. He cleared concussion protocols and returned to the field, much to the relief of his teammates and fans. But though the scare may be over for now, it raises important questions about the team's ability to protect their young quarterback from further injuries.Here are some of the tweets that admirers have started making about the incident, referring to Drake Maye as a legend. Some have dubbed him exceptional, while others have labeled him the greatest person alive.Drake Maye’s resilience is commendable, but the Patriots must prioritize keeping their star rookie safe. With a promising career ahead, the team can’t afford to gamble on his health.As the season continues, the spotlight will remain on Maye—not just for his gameplay, but for how well the Patriots can safeguard their future franchise quarterback.Also read - Patriots vs. Chargers: Key Inactives and Offensive Shifts Ahead of Week 17 Clash, Cole Strange Takes on New Role as Patriots Face Chargers","Drake Maye left the game against the Chargers after a helmet-to-helmet hit.

Australian Test squad member Josh Inglis has sustained a minor calf strain, it was made clear on Sunday. The injury occurred while fielding during the fourth Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.This injury excludes Inglis from the final Test match of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Sydney. It also puts his participation in the Big Bash League (BBL) season in question.Inglis will undergo injury management in preparation for the upcoming Test tour of Sri Lanka. He was serving as the backup batter for the squad on day three. All-rounder Beau Webster's release to play in the BBL left Inglis as the sole reserve batter.Inglis shared substitute fielding duties with reserve bowler Sean Abbott before sustaining the injury. A statement from Cricket Australia confirmed the low-grade calf strain.Inglis has been formally released from the Test squad. He is officially ruled out of contention for the Sydney Test. His participation was already unlikely unless another player was injured.He is, however, anticipated to recover in time for the two-Test tour of Sri Lanka. There's a strong possibility he could make his Test debut there. His proficiency against spin bowling makes him a potential candidate for the specialist batter role in Galle.The injury presents a setback for the Perth Scorchers in the BBL. Inglis was available for two of the Scorchers' initial four matches, against the Hobart Hurricanes and Melbourne Renegades. These games were scheduled between the third and fourth Test matches.His recovery timeline is tight. He has just 22 days to recover before the Australian Test squad departs for a pre-tour camp in the UAE. The first Test in Galle is set to commence on January 29.Cricket Australia will announce a replacement batter for the fifth Test in Sydney. This situation could potentially open the door for Nathan McSweeney 's return to the squad. His versatility in batting across various positions could be valuable. He was previously dropped from the squad in favour of Sam Konstas before the Boxing Day Test.Beau Webster, despite featuring in the BBL on Saturday night, remains part of the Test squad and is available for selection if needed. Jhye Richardson and Sean Abbott also remain with the squad as backup fast bowlers.There were some concerns about Mitchell Starc on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: India's pace ace Jasprit Bumrah carved his place in cricketing history on Sunday, becoming the bowler with the best average among those with 200 or more Test wickets. Bumrah also emerged as the fastest Indian pacer to reach the 200-wicket milestone in Test cricket.The historic feat unfolded on the fourth day of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy 's fourth Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground , where Bumrah dismissed Australia's Travis Head to claim his landmark 200th wicket.No one in Test cricket history has reached the milestone with a better average than Bumrah, whose average stands at 19.56, going past former West Indies pacer Joel Garner, who got to the landmark with an average of 20.34.With this stunning bowling average, Bumrah surpassed the career average of legendary West Indian trio of Malcolm Marshall (376 wickets at 20.94), Garner (259 at 20.97), and Curtley Ambrose (405 at 20.99), making him the sole member of this exclusive group with a sub-20 average. His precision and unmatched consistency reaffirm his status as one of the finest fast bowlers in the annals of cricket.The 30-year-old pacer reached this milestone in just 8,484 deliveries, setting a record as the fastest Indian to achieve the landmark in terms of balls bowled. Globally, Bumrah ranks fourth in this category, following Waqar Younis, Dale Steyn, and Kagiso Rabada.In his 44th Test, Bumrah equaled Ravindra Jadeja 's achievement of reaching 200 wickets , second only to Ravichandran Ashwin , who achieved the feat in 38 matches for India.Bumrah’s exceptional series continued as he clean-bowled Alex Carey to claim his 202nd Test wicket and his 29th scalp of the ongoing series, making him the most successful Indian pacer in a Test series on Australian soil.This record-breaking performance cements Bumrah’s legacy as a trailblazer in Indian cricket and sets a benchmark of excellence for future generations of bowlers.","Jasprit Bumrah becomes fastest Indian bowler to reach 200 Test wickets.

"I really wanted Gukesh to win, says Lancers coach & former chess player Altenburg",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/i-really-wanted-gukesh-to-win-says-lancers-coach-former-chess-player-altenburg/articleshow/116758126.cms,"Rourkela: Valentin Altenburg , who is in India as the coach of Kalinga Lancers in the Hockey India League after having led the German women’s national team at the Paris Olympics, was on Saturday shocked to hear the news that Magus Carlsen had been disqualified from the FIDE World Rapid and Blitz Championship for breaching the dress code regulations.One of the best minds in world hockey at present, Altenberg after all has a lot of love for chess and used to play the game from age 10 to the end of his 20s. Although he stopped playing seriously after taking up hockey coaching , he still keenly follows the game and was rooting for D Gukesh during the world championship match against Ding Liren early this month.“I really wanted him to win. Although I didn’t know him, I had a feeling he’s the right winner,” said Altenberg during an exclusive interaction with TOI on Saturday. “In a tournament like the World Chess Championship, you need to be really within yourself and despite being so young he was able to do that. I think he made mistakes, but he kept his calm.”However, what made the German coach a big fan of the 18-year-old Chess World Champion was not only his chess skills but his overall nature which he believes sets him apart from the rest.“He’s likable, friendly and an approachable guy. When you watch him, you can connect with him. It’s difficult to connect with others because either they are very outspoken like Magnus, or they just do their stuff,” said the German before adding, “And I think Gukesh can be a very good role model for young kids, not only in chess but also in other sports or other areas. They can see that they can be the best in the world at a young age without being weird.”Altenburg, whose 5-year-old son has also grown an interest in the board game, more importantly, believes playing chess has helped him become a better coach.“I enjoy the thinking processes and the strategising. I learned a lot as a hockey coach from playing chess, and I believe that I also learned to play chess better by being a hockey coach because it’s also a bit of a mental game,” he remarked after overseeing his team’s practice match against Tamil Nadu Dragons here at Birsa Munda Hockey Stadium.“Like hockey, chess also needs a lot of preparation, and you have to know your stuff. But when you play, it’s always one against one. And it comes down to your mental strength. I believe that Magnus is very good mentally. He’s not always the best prepared but has the best reaction while the game is going on.”Meanwhile, his wards at Lancers will embark on a test of their mental strength at handling the rigours of a league when they take on UP Rudras in their first match on Monday.",Valentin Altenburg is in India as the coach of Kalinga Lancers in the Hockey India League.

ROURKELA : The Hockey India League is well and truly back and it was Delhi SG Pipers who beat Team Gonasika 4-2 via shoot-outs after the opening encounter finished 2-2 at regular time in front of a sizeable crowd at Birsa Munda Hockey Stadium here on Saturday evening.Despite Delhi’s victory, there was hardly much to differentiate between the two teams during the 60 minutes of regular time.Tomas Domene opened the scoring for Delhi following their first PC in the fifth minute but Gonasika, after consistently pressing hard during the second quarter, pulled one back in the 26th minute.Araijeet Singh Hundal played the ball from the top of the D and Nikkin Thimmaiah tried to deflect it in. However, the ball hit the upright and came back into play. But Struan Walker was at the right place at the right time and he made no mistake of putting the ball into the open net.Despite the equaliser, Gonasika didn’t slow down and took the lead in the 35th minute and this time it was Victor Charlet who scored from the penalty corner. The 6’5” Frenchman, who missed a PC in the second quarter, slammed the ball into the bottom right corner to make it 2-1. Delhi goalkeeper Pawan got his left foot to the ball but still couldn’t keep it out.Gonasika though couldn’t celebrate for too long as Delhi made it 2-2 four minutes later. Once again it was Argentine forward Domene who sounded the board and this time it was a field goal.Midway into the final quarter, Domene then had a chance to wrap up the game when Delhi grabbed their fifth PC of the match. But this time his shot hit the right post. Gonasika tried to take advantage but despite a brilliant run down the middle, couldn’t score from the counterattack and the game went into shoot-outs.While Delhi coach Graham Reid would be pleased with his team’s performance, Gonasika captain Manpreet Singh would be disappointed with how he played. Not only did he make a terrible miss in the first quarter but was also poor with his shot selection during the shoot-outs.Earlier, a laser show was held following which all the teams were introduced even as the opening ceremony was cut short as a mark of respect for late former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh. The Indian men’s and women’s team captains Harmanpreet Singh and Salima Tete along with other dignitaries were then brought on stage and the tournament was announced open amid fireworks.",Delhi SG Pipers beat Team Gonasika 4-2 via shoot-outs after the opening encounter finished 2-2 at regular time in front of a sizeable crowd at Birsa Munda Hockey Stadium here on Saturday evening.

A fired-up Mohammed Siraj knocked over Australia opener Usman Khawaja on Sunday and immediately gestured 'keep quiet' to the Australian fans in the crowd, who have been booing the Indian fast bowler ever since his ugly face-off with Travis Head in the second Test at Adelaide.After Jasprit Bumrah sent back debutant Sam Konstas (8) early in Australia's second innings, Siraj followed it up with the wicket of Khawaja who made 21 runs. Finding the gap between the left-handed batter's bat and pad, Siraj, who is employed as a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) in Hyderabad, pegged the off-stump back.Australia lost two wickets in the opening session on Sunday to be 53 for 2 at lunch, leading India by 158 runs.The hosts, who had made 474 in their first innings, dismissed India for 369 early on the fourth morning to secure a 105-run lead in the first innings.India had to thank all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy for his century and a crucial 127-run stand for the eighth wicket with Washington Sundar (50), which helped the visitors recover from 221 for 7.On Sunday, Australia swiftly claimed the final Indian wicket as Nitish fell to off-spinner Nathan Lyon after scoring 114, which featured 11 boundaries and one six.In his maiden Test series, Nitish has accumulated 293 runs across 6 innings so far, the highest amongst Indian batters.The five-Test Border Gavaskar Trophy series currently stands at 1-1, after India won the first Test in Perth by 295 uns and Australia came back to clinch victory in Adelaide by 10 wickets.The third Test in Brisbane ended in a draw.","Mohammed Siraj knocked over Australia opener Usman Khawaja.

Washington Sundar: 'Nitish Reddy is fire, not flower; he killed it today'

Melbourne : The Gautam Gambhir-Rohit Sharma combine has made some contentious selection choices on this tour, none more so than the decision to pack their side with batting allrounders lower down the order instead of providing an extra specialist pacer to support Jasprit Bumrah.The move may appear to have been justified as Nitish Kumar Reddy brought India back into the fourth Test with bat in hand in Washington Sundar ’s company, but there are now new questions theteam management has to face.Washington’s role as an offspinning allrounder is already settled but Reddy has shown he is not the sort of hit-and-miss, flashy batter a No.8 is expected to be. He started his career as an opener and it now seems a travesty he was picked as a bowling allrounder in Perth.No wonder, India have barely used him as a medium-pace option. His spells read 3-0-4-0 and 4-0-21-1 in Perth, 6-2-25-1 and 1-0-8-0 (with the match already out of India’s reach) in Adelaide, 13-1-65-1 in Brisbane and 7-0-21-0 here in Melbourne. His lack of pace ensures he can’t be the viable fast-bowling replacement the team needs to address Bumrah’s workload issues.Instead, by getting an opportunity to display his sound technique, solid defensive game and ability to deliver under pressure, Reddy has proved he should be played as a pure batter. That he would eventually do so was always on the cards given the way he has batted throughout the series. However, he may have taken everyone by surprise by doing it in such a monumental manner — scoring a Test century away from home, against one of the best attacks, with the team staring at an early defeat.The management will find it hard not to make him a regular feature of the Test XI from now on. The question now is, should Reddy be considered for a push up the order at No. 5 or even No. 6 for the next Test in Sydney?“An unbelievable hundred. This hundred will be talked about and remembered for a very, very long time. Boxing Day century, he’ll remember it forever,” Washington said of Reddy on Saturday. “He’s mentally very, very strong. I’ve known him for quite a few years. The way he went about his business today was amazing. He made sure he picked those phases in the game where he thought he could geta few boundaries. He was also aware of the times we needed to just see off a few balls when the situation got challenging. Whatever he does, he’s very thorough,” Washington said.For someone with a sketchy first-class record (batting average of 23.36 from 26 first-class games, and a solitary hundred), someone who was first picked based on IPL performance, Reddy has certainly justified the selectors’ call by revealing some hidden layers to his game.“One thing about Nitish is no matter what he’s doing, on the field or off the field, he’s going to give his 120%. That’s his approach to life, not just cricket. I saw him quite closely during the IPL, his work ethic. The things that he would do before every game was something very, very pleasing for all of us towatch and we knew something very special was around the corner,” Washington said.Reddy, clearly, is the find of this tour. How can Rohit and Gambhir best harness his batting prowess to improve India’s chances in this series, and free up space for an extra pacer to support Bumrah in the bargain?","Nitish Kumar Reddy scored maiden Test century against Australia at MCG.

“Should be fired”: The NFL world remained dissatisfied with Bengals head coach Zac Taylor's clock management during the game against Broncos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/should-be-fired-the-nfl-world-remained-dissatisfied-with-bengals-head-coach-zac-taylors-clock-management-during-the-game-against-broncos/articleshow/116756837.cms,"Image via Imagn Images

The clock management by Cincinnati Bengals head coach Zac Taylor was in question

The Bengals and the Broncos played an entertaining match during Week 17 with great moments and touchdowns. The Bengals won, however, as they outdid Denver 30-24 after an overtime Tee Higgins score. The match happened under the Cincinnati sky. After the win, Cincinnati stands at 8-8, still holding on to its hopes of making the postseason. Things looked hairy for Zac Taylor's team, however, especially after Denver made it to the end zone in the final moments of regulation.In the final seconds of the game, Bengals nearly lost their chance for the postseason with a 17-17 game; however, Cincinnati recovered the ball with a Bo Nix interception . Chase Brown tried to set up the game-winning Bengals field goal, but was injured, which stopped the clock. At this point, Cincinnati chose to go for a broken touchdown instead of a time-sapping strategy, giving the Bengals the game-winning field goal attempt.The clock management by Cincinnati Bengals head coach Zac Taylor was in question after overtime was enforced by the Broncos. On an interception by Broncos quarterback Bo Nix, the Bengals took the ball inside the five-yard line of the Broncos and utilized their last timeout. Bengals running back Chase Brown wisely slid to reach the end zone.The Bengals, despite Brown's injury, elected to take the ball and score a touchdown on second down, despite the Broncos having taken their final timeout of the game. They did so immediately, giving the Broncos the ball with more than a minute left to play. The Broncos drove down the field and got to 4th down. With the game tied, quarterback Nix made an incredible touchdown to Marvin Mims, sending it into overtime. If the extra timeout was not granted, perhaps Nix could not have made the magic at the end of regulation.The Bengals won overtime against the Broncos, but the NFL world remained dissatisfied with Taylor's clock management after the game. One fan wrote on Twitter, ""I have no idea how Zac Taylor has a head coaching job. Another guy who has no clock management and situational awareness."" Another wrote, ""Zac Taylor and the entire Bengals coaching staff should be fired before the overtime for that absolutely idiotic clock management."" A third wrote, ""zac taylor going for the TD and giving denver 90 seconds with one timeout for a game tying drive surely this won't backfire!”Taylor defended his decision after Brown's injury, stating that his mindset changed postgame. “The injury changed everything,"" Taylor said. ""We were going to be able to kick the walk-off field goal with about 10 seconds … we were telling Chase to slide at the one because we figured they were going to let us score there, which he did. Unfortunately, got his ankle so they charged us with the timeout, so then that changes everything.""He further added, 'Now you’re in a second and goal at the one. You can down it and make sure they use their timeout and then try to score a touchdown from there on third down and maybe kick it on fourth, but you saw our red zone against them.”Also Read: Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix's 51-yard cannon against the Cincinnati Bengals was the longest throw of 2024 Cincinnati's Higgins overcame the game and bailed out questionable time management by Taylor and a missed field goal by Cade York. The win would still not inspire confidence, though, in Bengals fans, as they prepare to enter Week 18 to take on the Steelers in what could be a vital matchup.","The clock management by Cincinnati Bengals head coach Zac Taylor was in question.

Washington Sundar: 'Nitish Reddy is fire, not flower; he killed it today'

NEW DELHI: Australia captain Pat Cummins was left perplexed after the third umpire overturned what appeared to be a legitimate dismissal on day four of the Boxing Day Test at the MCG.While attempting to wrap up India’s first innings, Cummins delivered a full-length delivery to Mohammed Siraj , which seemed to produce an edge caught by Steve Smith at second slip.The Australians celebrated, but on-field umpire Michael Gough referred the decision to third umpire Sharfuddoula Saikat to confirm whether it was a bump ball.Third umpire Sharfuddoula ruled Siraj not out, stating, ""I can see the ball after hitting the back, I am satisfied.""The decision left Cummins and his team visibly confused.Cummins approached on-field umpire Gough to request another review of the footage, but both Gough and fellow umpire Joel Wilson declined his appeal, allowing Siraj to continue batting.The decision also left former cricketers Adam Gilchirst and Ravi Shastri confused.""This is very interesting. I have never seen this before. He is saying, 'You, as umpires, took it upstairs on your own behalf, but I want to review the decision.' I do think it needs to be looked at very closely,"" Gilchrist said on air.""The umpire said I've seen the ball bounce after it hit the bat. That was a very quick call, a very quick call, just two replays,"" Shastri said.The controversial call ultimately had little impact, as Australian offspinner Nathan Lyon dismissed centurion Nitish Kumar Reddy shortly afterward for 114.India’s innings ended at 369 in 119.3 overs, trailing Australia’s first-innings total by 105 runs.",Australia captain Pat Cummins left perplexed after third umpire overturns what appeared to be legitimate dismissal.

NEW DELHI: Australia opener Sam Konstas may have declared that Virat Kohli is his favourite player in the world and given the Indian batting superstar the clean chit over his shoulder-bump, but things are different when it comes to on field action.The first day of the Boxing Day Test between India and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground was just not about Konstas' dazzling debut, but also his on-field confrontation with Kohli.Virat was fined 20 percent of his match fees and given a demerit point by the ICC for a Level One breach of the ICC code of conduct as a result of that incident.However, the 19-year-old home debutant downplayed the incident, claiming the Indian superstar had bumped into him by accident.In the Indian first innings, Virat batted patiently in his 86-ball stay at the crease accumulating 36 runs and looked totally focused to not to fall to the trap outside the off-stump.There were many instances when Virat left deliveries bowled by Mitchell Starc outside the off-stump and giving the Aussie pacer a smile.But Virat ran out of patience after his mix-up with Yashasvi Jaiswal that resulted in the Indian opener's run out for 82.The Aussies finally had the last laugh as Kohli edged a Scot Bland delivery for wicket-keeper Alex Carey to take a simple catch again losing the game of patience.And now a video is viral on the internet that shows how Konstas celebrated after the dismissal of the former Indian captain.In the video, Konstas is showing asking the MCG crowd to cheer on the dismissal, much like Virat does when he asks the crowd to cheer the Indian bowlers.The Kohli-Konstas on-field rivalry is emblematic of cricket's beauty-where established stars and young challengers push each other to new heights.

NEW DELHI: India placed their hopes on Rishabh Pant on Day 3 of the fourth Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, expecting the star wicketkeeper-batter to steer the team out of a challenging situation. While Pant initially looked in great touch, he soon gifted his wicket to Australia in a moment of poor judgment.The turning point came in fast bowler Scott Boland 's over.Pant attempted a pick-up lap over fine leg but missed, with the ball striking him on the stomach, causing visible discomfort.On the very next delivery, instead of taking time to recover, Pant walked across the off-stump and premeditated another lap shot. This time, the ball skewed high toward deep third man, where Nathan Lyon completed a well-judged catch.Pant’s dismissal drew sharp criticism for his reckless approach.“What a crap shot by Rishabh Pant.

MELBOURNE: In just a few seconds, hope gave way to despair here at the 'G'.India appeared to be scripting a great escape when everything unravelled dramatically with stumps in sight. Yashasvi Jaiswal , man of the hour, batting in supreme touch, had been looking fidgety since reaching the half-century mark. Having moved into the eighties, he whipped Scott Boland to mid-on and immediately set off for the run.It was Jaiswal's call, but it was still a tight run. At the other end, Virat Kohli , who had been displaying the kind of discipline which has deserted him in recent times, hopped out as if in response, then immediately turned his back and started ball watching.Faced with having to make that split-second choice, Jaiswal opted for the brain freeze and kept running towards disaster.Having put on 102 fluent runs in pursuit of Australia's steep 474 and rotated strike well till that point, the partnership was blossoming. It even seemed Australia's relentless pace attack had a fight on their hands.By the time Pat Cummins threw the ball in, both batters were stranded at the non-striker's end. The Aussie fielders swooped in like pall bearers of gloom. Cummins missed the stumps but wicketkeeper Alex Carey collected the ball, ran in and whipped off the bails at the striker's end. The fight went out of India.Jaiswal, the man with the penchant for the daddy hundreds, stormed off after gesticulating at Kohli, who expressed helplessness. In walked Akash Deep as nightwatchman, another strange decision by India. Kohli, by now, was distraught, his focus shot to pieces. Boland's next over, first ball, he committed the cardinal sin that has dogged him for a while now: fishing at the fifth-stump line.All afternoon, he had left the ball with supreme anticipation and rare self-control, so much so that Australia had to change their plans for him. Boland cleverly revived the idea. Kohli lunged with the bat, the ball found the edge and Carey was back in action.The dismissal made for the unlikely sight of Kohli trudging off to loud boos from a record Day Two crowd of 85,147 spectators, There was to be more unsavoury drama in store. Kohli, having just copped a fine for shoulder-barging Sam Konstas on Day One, has replaced Mohammed Siraj as the Australian media's enemy No. 1, with some tabloids putting headlines like 'Clown Kohli' on the cover and photo-shopping a ball on to his nose.He had come out looking like the guilty party in the run-out too, and the boos followed him as he entered the dressing room. Kohli walked back out, incensed, and seemed interested in a confrontation when security guards stepped in to defuse the situation.Thirteen balls after the Kohli dismissal, Akash Deep, having had a torrid time against Starc, fended awkwardly at a short one from Boland. The ball careened from the inside edge of his bat to the thigh pad to leg gully's hands. India had lost three wickets for six runs and eventually ended Day Two of the fourth Test at 164/5, still trailing by 310 runs, with Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja left to pick up the pieces on the third morning.Before that run-out, Jaiswal was batting like a dream in favourable conditions. Answering India's call, the man with the penchant for the daddy hundreds appeared to be coasting along against the quicks. With edges not carrying, he unfurled some bold strokes, a couple of good-looking drives and pulls and some excitable ramp shots over the slip cordon.Jaiswal had walked out to bat with Rohit Sharma , who returned to open but found the runs had still chosen not to follow. Demoted to No. 3, KL Rahul unleashed some exquisite drives until a peach of a leg-cutter from Cummins sneaked through, bringing the resolute Kohli to the middle.It isn't an easy time to be Kohli right now, unlike the batting great on the other side, Steve Smith , who rediscovered form with his second consecutive hundred, his 34th Test ton and the 11th against India. After fighting it out in Brisbane and finding some luck along the way, Smith eventually rediscovered his touch and fluency here at the MCG.Having ended Day Two batting on 68, he knocked off the 32 required with minimum fuss on the second morning. Not that it was much of a challenge, with India having begun the day on a bad note as well. Their bowling looked pedestrian apart from Bumrah, who for a while troubled Smith. The fielding was listless and the captaincy uninspiring at times.Smith added 112 brisk runs with Cummins, adding 31 runs in the first seven overs and 60 off the first 14. He hooked Bumrah for six to get into the nineties before a cracking cover drive off Nitish Kumar Reddy got Smith to three figures.Only the bizarre manner of his dismissal, charging down to Akash Deep and dragging one on, would have rankled the perfectionist.It was Smith and Australia's day, and India now find themselves staring at the abyss in this Test. Unless, of course, Rishabh Pant decides it's a good time for another miracle.","Yashasvi Jaiswal and Virat Kohli had put on 102 fluent runs in pursuit of Australia's steep 474.

FOLLOW-ON RULE

This rule is governed by Law 14 of the

MCC Laws of Cricket

:

NEW DELHI: India found themselves in a challenging position, trailing by 230 runs with only three wickets in hand (244 for 7) at lunch on Day 3 against Australia (474) in the Boxing Day Test .India still need 111 more to avoid the follow-on — a scenario that seemed unlikely on such a placid batting track.The unbeaten pair of Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja face the critical task of negotiating the morning session. Their survival at the crease is vital to prevent India from falling into a difficult situation.As per article 14.1.1 of MCC's laws of cricket, in a two-innings match of 5 days or more, the side which bats first and leads by at least 200 runs shall have the option of requiring the other side to follow their innings.Australia amassed an impressive total of 474 runs in their first innings. Should India be dismissed for a score of 274 or below, the home side could potentially enforce the follow-on. However, if India reach 275 runs, Australia will lose the right to enforce the follow-on and will have to bat in the second innings.The follow-on rule is basically used to enforce a batting team's second innings immediately after their first innings in Test cricket if they fail to score a minimum threshold in comparison to the opponent's first innings total.14.1 Lead on first innings14.1.1 In a two-innings match of 5 days or more, the side which bats first and leads by at least 200 runs shall have the option of requiring the other side to follow their innings.14.1.2 The same option shall be available in two-innings matches of shorter duration with the minimum leads as follows:- 150 runs in a match of 3 or 4 days- 100 runs in a 2-day match- 75 runs in a 1-day match14.2 NotificationA captain shall notify the opposing captain and the umpires of his/her intention to take up this option. Once notified, the decision cannot be changed.By enforcing the follow-on, Team A makes Team B bat their second innings immediately, skipping Team A's second innings. This strategy is often employed when time is limited or when the pitch is deteriorating, giving Team A a better chance of winning.The decision to enforce the follow-on rests solely with the fielding captain, making it a strategic choice based on match conditions.","Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja face the critical task of negotiating the morning session.

(Photo by Martin Keep/AFP via Getty Images)

MELBOURNE: Captain Rohit Sharma may still be calling the shots on the field but as a Test batsman, he finds himself in a very lonely place right now. After Friday's failed attempt to recover from a prolonged slump by reclaiming his regular opening slot, the talk over his immediate future in the format is likely to get louder.On the second day of the fourth Test against Australia, Rohit walked out to bat with Yashasvi Jaiswal for the first time in the series. He only managed three runs off five balls, adding to a growing list of single-digit scores over his past few Tests, both at home and away.The manner of his dismissal, too, was bizarre - a leading edge off a tentative half-pull suggesting he was caught in two minds whether to go for the shot or leave the delivery from counterpart Pat Cummins alone.Perhaps Rohit is unable to trust his muscle memory, a common feature in batters who suffer prolonged run droughts, because he is one of the best exponents of the pull shot otherwise. Perhaps the mind is muddled. Perhaps he could do with a break?In his past 14 Test innings, Rohit averages 11.07 with one half-century. His scores read 6 and 5 in Chennai, 23 and 8 in Kanpur (both against Bangladesh), 2 and 52 in Bengaluru, 0 and 8 in Pune and 18 and 11 in Mumbai (all against New Zealand). On this Australia trip, after missing the first game in Perth, Rohit has batted at No. 6 in Adelaide and Brisbane, scoring 3, 6, and 10 across three innings before Friday's return to the opening slot.Where is Rohit Sharma the Test batsman of 2021, whose memorably constructed second-innings 127 fashioned victory for India at the Oval against England?India need Rohit back at his exhilarating best to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , but for the moment the issues are about his presence affecting the balance of the XI. India won the first Test of the series in Perth under Jasprit Bumrah 's captaincy when Rohit was on paternity leave, with KL Rahul opening instead and playing a significant role in that win.Not wanting to disturb a combo which has just won India an away Test, Rohit, when he returned as captain, agreed to take Rahul's usual middle-lower spot at No. 6 for the next two games. It seems he has not been unable to adjust to the role. Many experts and former captains have also been clamouring for him to return to the top and face the new ball.Perhaps all the chatter just got to Rohit. For the ongoing fourth Test, the in-form Rahul, who looked in good touch on Friday, was pushed down to No. 3 so Rohit could open. The regular No. 3, Shubman Gill , was dropped and a spin-bowling allrounder, Washington Sundar , was instead drafted in.India have failed to pick pacers to support Jasprit Bumrah and instead packed the side with allrounders to provide more batting depth in tough Australian conditions. With the runs not consistently flowing from Virat Kohli's blade either, the pressure has been on the lower middle order to pull off rescue acts.On Friday, after Rohit's dismissal, former India captain Sunil Gavaskar said on air here, ""(These are) tough times for him. There will be a second innings (here) and two more in Sydney. Questions will be asked if he doesn't score in those three innings.""Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting, who has always been an advocate for Rohit opening, expressed concern at the manner of his dismissal. ""That's just a lazy, not switched on, not up for the moment type of shot,"" Ponting said. ""He's been known as one of the best hookers and pullers of the ball since he made his debut but that's just not there. It's nothing. It's not committed, not really looking to be aggressive. He's just looking to tap it on the head.""Then there's the Ashwin factor. The famed off-spinner, one of India's greatest ever match-winners, retired in a huff after the Brisbane Test, ostensibly because he was not picked over Washington Sundar in Perth and not guaranteed a place in the XI for the Melbourne and Sydney Tests. Ashwin refused to be a passenger and left the squad immediately. If a player of his stature could be given the nudge, can the captain be above reproach?At 37, Rohit is at the backend of a glorious career and there are fears he could be in terminal decline as a batsman. In Australia, he'll be hoping a few more innings at the top will help him recover some semblance of his old prolific self. Else, chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar and head coach Gautam Gambhir may need to have a serious conversation with India's captain. Failure in the second innings of the Boxing Day Test will raise speculation to fever pitch.","Rohit Sharma has failed to recover from a prolonged slump as a Test batsman. The 37-year-old has scored just 11 runs in his past 14 Test innings. The manner of his dismissal, too, was bizarre - a leading edge off a tentative half-pull.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116729291,imgsize-39860,width-400,resizemode-4/116729291.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Indian cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar weighed in on young batter Yashasvi Jaiswal ’s unfortunate run-out during the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).Speaking on Star Sports, Gavaskar explained that the mix-up between the India opener and Virat Kohli could have been avoided hadn't the former spent his seconds watching the fielders.""It would have been a quick run, and somebody like Virat Kohli would definitely have made it. But the thing was, he looked at the fielder. When you look at the fielder, when you turn, you've lost that vital second. And so naturally, you then think, 'No, I want to be able to make it.' Your balance is completely off. And it would have been a tight run. I think at that stage, why do you need to take a run that carries an element of risk? You're batting well, runs are coming,"" Gavaskar remarked.""At that stage, the risk was not really necessary. But it could have been completed only because Kohli is such a fantastic runner between the wickets.""Before the run-out, Jaiswal had been anchoring the Indian innings brilliantly, amassing 82 runs off 118 balls with 11 fours and one six.The talented opener seemed poised for a major milestone as he neared a well-deserved century.However, disaster struck late in the day as a mix-up with Kohli led to his dismissal.The incident unfolded when Jaiswal drove a full delivery from Scott Boland to mid-on and set off for a quick single.Kohli, however, held back, momentarily ball-watching. Pat Cummins pounced on the opportunity with a direct throw attempt that missed, but 'keeper Alex Carey capitalised on the chaos, collecting the ball and completing the run-out.The dismissal proved costly, triggering a mini-collapse in the Indian batting lineup. From a strong position at 153/2, India stumbled to 164/5 by stumps on Day 2.Nightwatchman Akash Deep fell for a duck, and the visitors faced a daunting deficit of 310 runs, with 111 needed to avoid the follow-on.",Yashasvi Jaiswal was run-out by Virat Kohli on Day 2 of the Boxing Day Test.

Washington Sundar: 'Nitish Reddy is fire, not flower; he killed it today'

HYDERABAD: When Nitish Kumar Reddy knelt down at the Melbourne Cricket Ground to celebrate his century against Australia on Saturday, he stood taller than a giant. It was also his way of telling the world where he came from — the land of Telugu movies or Tollywood — which shapes popular culture in the two Telugu states of AP and Telangana.The third youngest centurion for India in Australia at 21 years and 216 days — after Sachin Tendulkar in 1992 and Rishabh Pant in 2019 — celebrated his 50 'Pushpa' style — airbrushing his beard with the iconic 'jhukega nahi'. But after hitting his century, he became 'Bahubali' — the hero laying his helmet on his bayonet, showcasing his commitment to a cause. A killi (paan) after a hearty dinner and a movie are a part of life in Andhra, and with his celebrations, Nitish paid tribute to what defines swag for many youngsters in this region.The 21-year-old Andhra lad from the port city of Visakhapatnam is the toast of the nation after his gutsy, rearguard innings saved India the ignominy of a follow-on at the MCG on Saturday.Nitish's father, who travelled for this Test match, said, ""I was very nervous and thought he would miss the century when Washington and Bumrah got out. Even in the previous Tests when he scored a couple of 40s, we were disappointed that he missed his halfcentury. Today, when Bumrah got out, I thought he had missed the century. But thank God, he made it. For us as a family, it was the most joyous feeling when he played in the Indian Premier League and the Andhra Premier League. He then went on to play for India in T20Is. Now, coming to a foreign soil and scoring this century for the country in Test format is unbelievable. I don't have words to express this feeling,"" Mutyala Reddy told TOI from Melbourne.Reddy senior recounted Nitish's hard road to success: ""We used to travel 30 km from Gajuwaka to Port Stadium at 5 am each day. It was possible because of my wife Manasa who used to get everything ready before time. She supported us despite not knowing anything about the game.""Nitish's father had to leave a steady job with Hindustan Zinc Ltd. in Visakhapatnam as he was transferred to Udaipur. Instead, he heeded the call of coaches Kangani Kumaraswamy and A Krishna Rao as it would've affected Nitish's training. He opted for early retirement instead. ""We struggled financially after I left the job. It was tough to manage the family. We sailed through with our savings, but we made sure Nitish got all the support,"" he said.""I don't know English well. But when everyone in the stands and so many Australian fans congratulated me, I could not control my joy. Even (Adam) Gilchrist congratulated me. I am over the moon,"" he added.The uncertainty over his selection and visa formalities delayed his arrival in Australia before the MCG Test, but Nitish's father was delighted by his son's achievements in 2024. ""For Nitish, 2024 is a golden year. He has made us very proud. We got very emotional speaking to him after the day's play.""Reddy senior also thanked the Bharat Army who invited him to their celebrations. ""We got our family pass and were in our designated area. But the Bharat Army fans came and took me to the boundary. When Nitish scored a century, we had a blast,"" he said.","The 21-year-old Andhra lad from the port city of Visakhapatnam is the toast of the nation after his gutsy, rearguard innings saved India the ignominy of a follow-on at the MCG on Saturday.

This was history in the making, the birth of India's next big batting star, forged under the most trying circumstances.Reddy is a movie buff but sport is real, not reel. And yet, he's living out a script of his dreams.Nitish Kumar Reddy came in to bat at No. 8, a strange position for someone of his composure and batting ability, a position no doubt necessitated by the rocky form of some superstars from a previous era. The tail needed to be packed with as much batting firepower as Rohit Sharma 's faltering team could muster at the G on Saturday, the third day of the fourth Test against Australia.Reddy arrived at the crease after Rishabh Pant had thrown his wicket away by playing a bizarre stroke, leaving the team in deep, deep trouble at 191/6 in response to Australia's massive first-innings 474. India still needed to avoid a potential follow-on.Thirty runs later, senior partner Ravindra Jadeja too was gone, setting the stage for Indian cricket's Gen Next to script a turnaround for the ages. Enter Reddy's able ally on the day, Washington Sundar , who blunted Australia's relentless attack with his broad blade, scoring just one boundary during a half-century knock as Reddy at the other end exhibited temperament, poise, discipline and a range of strokes remarkable for someone who made his Test debut in this very series in Perth, four Tests ago.Washington is close to Reddy, has previous experience of playing a key role with the bat in Australia, in the Gabba heroics of 2021, and the pair put on 127 runs in 47.5 overs. They took full advantage of some favourable batting conditions and a relatively docile pitch. Australia simply didn't see it coming.Reddy started positively as usual but wasn't needlessly adventurous, leaving the ball sensibly and impressing with his good shot selection, nimble footwork against Nathan Lyon's off-spin, wristy strokes and some pristine drives. Australia squeezed the runs and bowled dry, more so after a rain break made the pitch sticky, but they just couldn't dislodge Reddy.His controlled defiance and Washington's patience ensured that by the end of the day, the duo had blunted the second new ball, picked up the pieces and reignited India's campaign in this series. Lyon dismissed Washington at the end with Reddy on 97, and that was when things got tense. With tailender Jasprit Bumrah coming in, Reddy was forced to refuse a few singles. Off the last ball of a Boland over, the 113th of the innings, an increasingly edgy Reddy drove airily over cover in a bid to retain the strike. For some inexplicable reason they ran back for two, leaving Reddy stranded on 99 and unable to take strike.Pat Cummins took only three balls to crack open Bumrah's defence, bringing Mohammed Siraj to the crease. You could hear a pin drop at the 'G'. Three balls to negotiate. Cummins beat Siraj first ball, then bowled a bouncer which Siraj ducked under. Siraj defended the third ball safely. The stadium exploded. Three more balls in Boland's next over and Reddy had breached the three-figure mark. He had faced 19 deliveries in his nervous 90s and emerged triumphant.It was the sort of knock which will resonate for decades to come, and no doubt many here who went back with a tear in their eye and a gulp in their throat will tell their grandchildren, “I was there when Nitish Reddy scored his first Test ton.” Even the beer-guzzling, rain-drenched Australian nationalist, the kind who has made it a habit of abusing visiting sides all day long, left shaking his head in amazement and muttering under his breath.It was an incredible fightback but India are not out of the woods yet, of course. They took stumps on Day Three still trailing by 116 runs, and only one wicket left standing. Reddy is still out there, batting on 105, and will probably look to belt a few around the park come Sunday.It was what Reddy did on the third day of the fourth Test, though, that will go down as the stuff of legend. As the tears poured out of Mutyala and the on-field celebrations ended, the heavens opened as if on cue and no further play was possible. Hopefully, the flame Reddy has lit will burn bright for years to come.",Allrounder scores maiden Test century at Melbourne Cricket Ground. Nitish Kumar Reddy and Washington Sundar put on 127 runs in 47.5 overs. Australia bowled out for 474 in their first innings on Boxing Day. India are now on 191-6 at stumps on the third day of fourth Test.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116757472,imgsize-87804,width-400,resizemode-4/116757472.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Cometh the hour, cometh Nitish Reddy . He first rescued India from a precarious position, bowled some overs, and then turned into a guide for India's No. 11, Mohammed Siraj The 21-year-old Reddy, who displayed tremendous resilience by scoring a determined 105 not out at number 8 to virtually save India on day three of the Boxing Day Test, was heard guiding Siraj from the non-striker's end on how to handle the Australian bowling attack.""Miyan bhai, off pe khade rehna. Bahar ka ball chhod do. Ghumega nahi. Ghum gya to fir kuch nahi kar sakte. Chhod do usse,"" Reddy was heard telling Siraj. [Stay on the off side. Leave the ball outside. It won't turn. If it turns, then there's nothing we can do. Just leave it.]Impressed by Reddy's sensational maiden century, former coach Ravi Shastri advocated for his promotion in the batting order, suggesting that a top-six position would provide better balance for India going into the fifth and final Test.""I feel that the way he's batted, this is the last time he will bat at 7,"" Shastri told Star Sports.""To get the balance of the side, you need him to go higher up the order, either 5 or 6, and then you have the opportunity of playing 5 bowlers to take the 20 wickets. He's given that kind of confidence to the selectors, the team management, and the captain.""India's batting has appeared fragile, especially with skipper Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Rishabh Pant struggling for runs in the five-Test series so far.Throwing his support behind Nitish, Shastri added, ""Reddy is fully capable of batting in the top 6. Then it changes the whole balance of the game.""You go to Sydney with him batting in the top 6, and you're playing five bowlers.""","Reddy scored 105 not out at number 8 to virtually save India on day three of the Boxing Day Test.

The law of averages caught up with Australia's opener Sam Konstas as early as the second innings of his Test career, when the teenager's stumps were rattled early on Day 4 of the fourth Test in Melbourne by Jasprit Bumrah -- the same bowler he had scooped for a six in his debut knock.Australia took the remaining one wicket of the Indian innings quickly on Sunday morning to wrap up the visitors' first innings for 369 and take a healthy 105-run lead. India's centurion, Nitish Kumar Reddy, was the last wicket to fall, dismissed by Nathan Lyon for 114. The offspinner ended with three wickets (3 for 96), the same as pacers Pat Cummins (3 for 89) and Scott Boland (3 for 57).The Indian bowlers began in a much more disciplined fashion, and Bumrah made the new ball count with the dismissal of Konstas in the 7th over. He followed his breezy 60 runs in the first innings by only 8 in the second.To rub a little further, Bumrah egged on the Indian fans in attendance to celebrate with loud cheers.The ball seamed in after pitching, moved a lot to find the gap between bat and pad, and hit the top of middle-stump to trigger celebrations in the Indian camp.Australia were 20 for 1 at the stage, which brought Marnus Labuschagne in to join Usman Khawaja.Later in the morning session, Mohammed Siraj struck to make it two down when he castled Khawaja for 21 to make it 43 for 2 in 19 overs.Australia led by 148 runs at that stage.","Australia take remaining one wicket of Indian innings quickly on Sunday morning to wrap up the visitors' first innings for 369 and take a 105-run lead.
