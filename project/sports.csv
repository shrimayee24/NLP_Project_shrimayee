RCB vs CSK: Live streaming details

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru have a potential playoff spot within reach, while Chennai Super Kings are in search of a morale-boosting win. But beyond the immediate team objectives, Saturday’s IPL clash promises a nostalgic spectacle — a possible final face-off between two legends of the game, Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni, in the league.Before dwelling on that emotional subplot, it’s worth noting the stakes. A win for RCB would take their tally to 16 points, putting them in a strong position to secure a place in the Qualifiers with three matches still to go.For CSK, already out of playoff contention, a win could provide a late spark — a chance to build some momentum and finish mid-table, steering clear of the embarrassment of ending up at the bottom of the standings.The pitch at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium has offered some help to bowlers this season, making run-scoring a tougher task for batters, who’ve had to work hard for their runs. However, there have been instances where the surface has favoured batters, allowing them to play with freedom and capitalise on the short boundaries for maximum returns. If the pitch leans towards batting-friendly conditions, bowlers will need to stick to a stump-to-stump line and use variations wisely to outsmart the batters and take wickets.On the other hand, any assistance from the surface will allow them to bowl more aggressively and apply pressure to restrict the opposition. Dew is likely to play a crucial role, especially in the second innings — a trend that has significantly affected bowling teams throughout the season. The M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, home to RCB, has hosted 99 IPL matches so far. Of these, teams batting first have won 42 games, while those chasing have won 53. The highest successful run chase at this venue is 186/3, achieved by the Deccan Chargers against RCB in 2010.RCB: Virat Kohli, Jacob Bethell, Rajat Patidar (C), Jitesh Sharma (WK), Tim David, Romario Shepherd, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Suyash Sharma, Josh Hazlewood, Yash DayalCSK: Shaik Rasheed, Ayush Mhatre, Sam Curran, Ravindra Jadeja, Dewald Brevis, Shivam Dube, Deepak Hooda, MS Dhoni (C/WK), Noor Ahmad, Syed Khaleel Ahmed, Matheesha PathiranaRajat Patidar (c) Phil Salt, Virat Kohli, Devdutt Padikkal, Jitesh Sharma (w), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Romario Shepherd, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash Dayal, Suyash Sharma, Lungi Ngidi, Liam Livingstone, Swapnil Singh, Manoj Bhandage, Rasikh Dar Salam, Nuwan Thushara, Jacob Bethell, Mohit Rathee, Swastik Chikara, Abhinandan Singh.MS Dhoni (c, wk), Shaik Rasheed, Ayush Mhatre, Deepak Hooda, Sam Curran, Ravindra Jadeja, Dewald Brevis, Shivam Dube, Noor Ahmad, Khaleel Ahmed, Matheesha Pathirana, Anshul Kamboj, R Ashwin, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Ramakrishna Ghosh, Jamie Overton, Vijay Shankar, Rahul Tripathi, Shreyas Gopal, Devon Conway, Rachin Ravindra, Mukesh Choudhary, Nathan Ellis, C Andre Siddarth, Vansh Bedi.Matches played: 34RCB won: 12CSK won: 21NR: 1Tied: 0Out of the 34 matches played between Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Chennai Super Kings in the IPL, CSK have emerged victorious 21 times, while RCB have won 12 matches.

NEW DELHI: Gujarat Titans continued their dominance over Sunrisers Hyderabad with a comprehensive 38-run win, further consolidating their position in the top half of the IPL 2025 points table . This marked GT’s fifth win over SRH in six completed matches, including a hat-trick of victories at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.With this win, Gujarat Titans moved up to second place in the table, having played 10 matches and secured 7 wins.

Despite playing an extra match, their strong net run rate gives them the edge in the standings.Royal Challengers Bengaluru, also with 14 points from 10 matches, are third on the table. Their net run rate of +0.521 is lower than both MI and GT, but their form has kept them firmly in the race for a playoff spot.Punjab Kings occupy fourth position with 13 points from 10 games, including one no-result. They have won 6 and lost 3, with a modest net run rate of +0.199.Delhi Capitals are hot on their heels in fifth place with 12 points and a healthy net run rate of +0.362, having won 6 of their 10 matches.Lucknow Super Giants sit mid-table in sixth place with 10 points from 10 games (5 wins, 5 losses), but their negative NRR of -0.325 could hurt them in a close qualification race.Kolkata Knight Riders, despite having one no-result, are seventh with 9 points and a net run rate of +0.271. Rajasthan Royals and Sunrisers Hyderabad have both struggled this season, each stuck on 6 points.However, RR have played 11 matches and have been eliminated (E) from the playoff race, while SRH's hopes hang by a thread, suffering their seventh loss and holding a poor NRR of -1.192.Chennai Super Kings are at the bottom, officially eliminated after managing just 2 wins in 10 matches, with the worst net run rate in the tournament (-1.211).","Gujarat Titans beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by 38 runs in IPL 2025.

Rodgers, Steelers, and the rising storm in Pittsburgh



Aaron Rodgers Leaves Door Open To Playing, Seemingly With Steelers, Or Potentially Retiring

“All signs would lead you to believe they’re going to get Aaron Rodgers.”

The NFL rumor mill is heating up, and this time, it’s hard to ignore. Aaron Rodgers may be heading to the Pittsburgh Steelers , and the impact could be huge. With training camp approaching and no clear QB in sight, the idea of Rodgers in black and gold is looking more likely. This move feels less like a stretch and more like a natural next step in his career.Aaron Rodgers returning to the spotlight in Pittsburgh isn't just about filling a quarterback vacancy, it’s a statement. The Steelers , after bypassing a top-tier QB in the NFL Draft and sticking with volatile talent like George Pickens, appear to be setting the table for a win-now push. Mike DeFabo of The Athletic fueled the fire, stating,That comment has lit up sports radio, social media, and fan forums, sparking one of the offseason’s most polarizing debates.On paper, the match is hard to ignore. The Steelers boast a playoff-ready defense, a bruising run game, and a wide receiver corps desperate for a leader. Rodgers, even at 40, brings elite IQ, poise, and the kind of swagger the Steelers haven’t seen since Big Ben’s prime.But this isn’t just about football. It’s about culture and control. Rodgers has never been one to bite his tongue, and Pittsburgh isn’t exactly known for coddling egos. Add in George Pickens, who’s made it clear he won’t settle for mediocrity at quarterback, and you’ve got a potentially combustible locker room. If Rodgers joins, it's not just his arm the Steelers will be banking on, it's his ability to unify a team that’s one bad day from imploding.Also Read: Travis Kelce predicts Josh Simmons will be future Hall of Famer, strengthening Chiefs' legacy with Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid Critics argue the move reeks of desperation, a band-aid over a long-term issue. Supporters believe Rodgers could be the catalyst for one last Super Bowl run. Either way, the NFL landscape is watching closely. Because if the Steelers take a chance on Rodgers, the fallout be it good or bad will be impossible to ignore.","The NFL rumor mill is heating up, and this time, it’s hard to ignore.

Gregg Popovich steps down as Spurs head coach after 29 seasons to take over front office role,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/gregg-popovich-steps-down-as-spurs-head-coach-after-29-seasons-to-take-over-front-office-role/articleshow/120832177.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Gregg Popovich’s legacy: 5 championships and the dynasty he built in San Antonio

Gregg Popovich’s departure: The end of an era and what’s next for the San Antonio Spurs

Gregg Popovich , the longest tenured and winningest coach in NBA history, is officially stepping down as the head coach of the San Antonio Spurs . After nearly three decades on the sidelines, the 76-year-old will now fully focus on his role as the team’s President of Basketball Operations , the Spurs confirmed on Friday, May 2. His decision follows recent health setbacks, including a mild stroke in November 2024 and a medical scare in April. Gregg Popovich ’s career is nothing short of historic. Since taking over as head coach during the 1996–97 season, he has racked up 1,422 regular-season wins, the most in NBA history, and led the Spurs to five NBA championships . His title-winning seasons came in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2014, a stretch that turned the Spurs into a model franchise and dynasty.He helped shape the careers of legends like Tim Duncan , David Robinson, Tony Parker, Manu Ginóbili, and Kawhi Leonard . Popovich also coached Team USA to gold at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and is a three-time NBA Coach of the Year , tied for the most ever alongside Pat Riley and Don Nelson.Although he signed a five-year extension with the Spurs in 2023, health challenges shifted his plans. Popovich suffered a stroke on November 2, 2024, and did not return to the bench for the remainder of the season. During his recovery, assistant coach Mitch Johnson took over and led the team to a 31–45 finish.Popovich remained involved behind the scenes throughout the year, and in recent weeks, he had been seen around the team’s facilities. However, the rigors of coaching proved too demanding to return.“While my love and passion for the game remain, I’ve decided it’s time to step away as head coach,” Popovich said in a statement on Friday. “I’m forever grateful to the wonderful players, coaches, staff and fans who allowed me to serve them as the Spurs head coach and am excited for the opportunity to continue to support the organization, community and city that are so meaningful to me.”Popovich’s coaching journey began with the Spurs as an assistant under Larry Brown in 1988 before returning in 1994 as general manager. In 1996, he appointed himself head coach midseason and soon helped engineer a historic turnaround that led to 22 consecutive playoff appearances between 1998 and 2019.His departure marked a change of guard in the NBA. With Popovich stepping down, Erik Spoelstra of the Miami Heat, head coach since 2008, becomes the league’s longest tenured active coach.Also Read: Gregg Popovich health update: Fan favorite San Antonio Spurs coach suffers scare in restaurant Though he won’t be on the sidelines, Popovich remains deeply woven into the Spurs’ future.

What Mike Sullivan’s firing really means for Sidney Crosby’s future in Pittsburgh Penguins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/what-mike-sullivans-firing-really-means-for-sidney-crosbys-future-in-pittsburgh-penguins/articleshow/120831787.cms,"Photo by Joe Sargent/Getty Images

Mike Sullivan’s firing puts spotlight on Sidney Crosby’s future with the Pittsburgh Penguins

why

Mike Sullivan getting the boot wasn’t the biggest surprise of the Penguins’ offseason. But what might it lead to? That’s the real story. It’s not about just swapping out a coach. It’s about how that decision hits the guy who's been the face of the franchise for nearly 20 years Sidney Crosby . The bond between coach and captain ran deep. And while Crosby isn’t the type to make a fuss, you have to wonder: could this be the moment he starts questioning how much longer he wants to ride this out in Pittsburgh?At Monday’s press conference, Kyle Dubas stood in front of reporters trying to explain why he chose to cut ties with the most successful coach in Pittsburgh Penguins history. But as things were winding down, someone asked the question that really mattered: was he worried that this move might push Crosby to consider leaving?“No,” Dubas replied, short and sharp, a rare one-word answer from a guy who usually speaks in paragraphs.Dubas did say he called Crosby on Sunday to give him a heads-up. “In terms of how he feels about it, I had a five-minute conversation with him before about the fact that we were going to make a change, and we didn’t get into the ins and outs of it,” he explained. “I have to do what I think is best for the organization.” He wouldn’t share any more than that. “I’m not going to speak for Sid.”Crosby hasn’t said much publicly either — just a short statement to NHL Network, where he thanked Sullivan for his “preparation and commitment to winning,” and said the coach pushed him every day for a decade.And here’s the thing: this might not be about Sullivan, exactly. It’s abouthe’s gone. Rumor is, Sullivan and Dubas weren’t seeing eye to eye on the team’s future. Sullivan wanted to keep pushing. Dubas? He’s talking about “transition” and how just making the playoffs next year would be “a tremendous accomplishment.”That’s not the kind of timeline you pitch to a 37-year-old Hall of Famer who’s still playing at an elite level.Last month, Crosby spoke openly about how much the losing has worn on him. Watching longtime teammates get traded, seeing the team fade out of the playoff picture again — it’s been a grind. Dubas admitted as much, saying, “Until we are back contending to win the Stanley Cup, I expect him to be grumpy.”Dubas says the plan is to build around Crosby, bringing in young players who can grow into a new core. “Him helping them and them helping him is really what the focus is,” he said.But that only works if those timelines actually sync up.Crosby’s loyalty has never been in question. He signed an extension. He’s never asked out. He brushed off trade rumors and stayed laser-focused when others were looking for the exits. But you can only run uphill for so long before you start asking where the top is — or if you’re even still climbing.If Crosby ever does start to consider playing somewhere else, we might look back on the day Mike Sullivan was fired not just as the end of a coaching era — but as the first step toward something nobody in Pittsburgh really wants to think about.Also Read: Los Angeles Kings vs. Edmonton Oilers: Key stats and breakdown for round 1","Sidney Crosby has been the face of the Pittsburgh Penguins for nearly 20 years.

Knicks survive, avoid potential implosion





Jalen Brunson ’s game-winning three-pointer with 4.3 seconds left didn’t just secure a 116-113 victory over the Detroit Pistons—it may have saved the New York Knicks from an offseason of chaos. The shot, which sealed the first-round playoff series in six games, could go down as one of the most consequential moments in recent Knicks history.With the Knicks barely surviving a grueling series against a relentless Pistons squad, Brunson’s heroics ensured the team avoided a do-or-die Game 7. Instead, they now prepare for a second-round showdown against the defending champion Boston Celtics .Jalen Brunson’s 40-point performance was capped by a cold-blooded three over Ausar Thompson, reinforcing why he was named the NBA’s Clutch Player of the Year. But beyond the box score, the shot carried immense weight:- Saved jobs – A first-round exit could have triggered major changes, from coaching staff to front-office decisions.- Avoided disaster – A Game 7 loss to the underdog Pistons would have been catastrophic for a team with championship aspirations.- Extended the season – The Knicks now have another chance to prove themselves against the Celtics.Had Brunson missed, the narrative would be entirely different. The Pistons, who pushed the Knicks to the brink in four games decided by three points or fewer, could have forced a decisive Game 7 at Madison Square Garden.New York now shifts focus to Boston, a team that dominated them in the regular season. The Celtics swept all four matchups, with three of those wins coming in convincing fashion.- Boston’s dominance – The Celtics are the defending champions and present a far tougher challenge than Detroit.- Health concerns – The Knicks are battered and bruised after a physical series.- Pressure to perform – Another underwhelming playoff run could still lead to changes, but Brunson’s shot bought them time.Coach Tom Thibodeau summed it up best: ""He’s at his best when his best is needed."" Brunson’s clutch gene has kept the Knicks alive—for now.History shows how a single shot can redefine a franchise:Brunson’s shot didn’t just win a game—it may have preserved the Knicks’ current era.

Gujarat Titans aim to recover from the blow dealt by young sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi when they face a struggling Sunrisers Hyderabad in an IPL match tonight (May 2).Suryavanshi stunned GT with his incredible performance, hitting the season’s fastest century in just 35 balls and becoming the youngest IPL centurion at only 14 years and 32 days old.Despite an eight-wicket loss — post a strong 209/4 score — the result hasn't altered GT's position in the league. The Titans remain one of the most consistent teams this season, boasting a balanced squad with strengths in both batting and bowling.Led by Shubman Gill, they sit comfortably with six wins out of nine matches (12 points). Just two more wins from their last five fixtures would secure a spot in the playoffs, reaching the 16-point threshold.GT's in-form top order gives them confidence, especially with standout Sai Sudharsan, who is second in the Orange Cap race with 456 runs and five fifties. Gill (389 runs) and Jos Buttler (406 runs) also rank among the season’s top batters, making a formidable trio despite recent challenges.Earlier this season, GT defeated SRH convincingly in Hyderabad by seven wickets, thanks largely to Mohammed Siraj's impressive 4/17 spell. They’ll be hoping for a similar performance this time.Meanwhile, SRH find themselves in a critical position, needing wins urgently. The runners-up last season have struggled — just three wins in nine matches — and sit ninth on the points table. Another loss could effectively eliminate their playoff hopes.While SRH have seen flashes of brilliance from openers Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head, consistency remains elusive for the team.The pitch at Narendra Modi Stadium favours the batters, which should benefit SRH. In five of the eight matches played at Motera, teams have scored over 200 runs, highlighting the batting-friendly conditions.

Astrologer Greenstone Lobo: Is Yuzvendra Chahal's India career over?

NEW DELHI: Vaibhav Suryavanshi lit up IPL 2025 with a sensational century against Gujarat Titans , turning heads across the cricketing world. The 14-year-old southpaw set the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur alight with his explosive strokeplay in a high-scoring thriller that saw Rajasthan Royals chase down a daunting 210-run target with ease, clinching an eight-wicket victory. Just days after his record-breaking feat, Suryavanshi faced a harsh lesson in the game’s unpredictability, falling for a two-ball duck against Mumbai Indians at the same venue on Thursday.With Rajasthan Royals now out of the playoff race and gearing up to face Kolkata Knight Riders on Sunday, Suryavanshi was spotted sharing a light-hearted moment with teammate Nitish Rana In the video, Rana can be heard saying:“Main 5 bat deta hoon tujhe. Agar uska count 14 se upar gaya na…” (I’ll give you 5 bats, but if the total goes above 14...)Suryavanshi counters:“Mujhe ek hi chahiye, baat yeh hai... Mere age se zyada bats hue toh main apna bat usko de dunga jisko tum bologe.” (I only need one. The point is... if the number of bats exceeds my age, I’ll give my bat to whoever you say.)Rana retorts:“Mera bat hai, meri marzi – main kyun doon?” (It’s my bat, my choice – why should I give it?)Rana adds with a grin:“Tere paas 10 bat hain? 10 bat toh bohot hote hain, itne toh Virat bhai ke paas bhi nahi hote!” (You have 10 bats? That’s a lot! Even Virat bhai doesn’t have that many!)Cricket icon Kapil Dev also weighed in on the young star’s meteoric rise, underlining the need for patience in his development.""Give him time, don't rush it. He is a good talent and has good ability. But you need to give time to players,"" said the 1983 World Cup-winning captain, acknowledging the teenager’s promising skills.Suryavanshi orchestrated Rajasthan’s stunning chase, dismantling a Gujarat bowling lineup that boasted a combined 694 international caps. His 35-ball century — the fastest by an Indian in IPL history — is second only to Chris Gayle’s 30-ball ton in 2013.At just 14 years and 32 days, he became the youngest player ever to score a T20 century. His knock, which included 11 towering sixes, tied Murali Vijay’s record for the most sixes in an IPL innings by an Indian — Vijay struck 11 during his 127 against RR in 2010.","14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi becomes youngest player ever to score a T20 century.

Astrologer Greenstone Lobo: Is Yuzvendra Chahal's India career over?

NEW DELHI: Gujarat Titans skipper Shubman Gill was at the heart of a dramatic moment during his side’s 38-run victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Friday, voicing his frustration after a controversial DRS decision led to his dismissal.The incident unfolded in the 13th over of GT’s innings when Gill was ruled run out following a tight call at the striker’s end. Gill, who looked set for a big score, reacted strongly to the decision and later opened up about the heated exchange with the officials.“There was a little bit of a discussion with me and the umpire,” Gill said after the match. “Sometimes there are so many emotions involved. As you give your 110 percent, there are bound to be some emotions.”The flashpoint came after Jos Buttler nudged a delivery from Zeeshan Ansari towards short fine leg and called for a quick single. Harshal Patel collected and fired a sharp throw to the striker’s end, where wicketkeeper Heinrich Klaasen attempted to deflect the ball onto the stumps. The third umpire, Michael Gough , ruled that the ball had touched the stumps after reviewing several replays, pointing to a visible deviation after contact with Klaasen’s gloves.Gill, who had scored a blistering 76 off just 38 balls, was visibly stunned and reluctantly walked off the field. Cameras later showed him in a tense exchange with the TV umpire near the dugout.Despite the controversy, GT were dominant throughout, finishing with 224/6. Gill, Buttler (64), and Sai Sudharsan (48) led the charge with aggressive intent and precise strike rotation, registering just 22 dot balls in the entire innings.“Definitely didn’t plan that [on just 22 dot balls],” Gill said of the efficient batting display. “The only conversation was let’s try to play the game we have been playing. We have an understanding of how to keep the scoreboard ticking.”The victory strengthened GT’s playoff push, but the evening will be remembered as much for Gill’s fire as his flair.","Gujarat Titans skipper Shubman Gill engaged in a tense exchange with the on- field and TV umpires.

Giannis Antetokounmpo and Tyrese Haliburton’s father’s altercation stole the spotlight at Gainbridge Fieldhouse



Fans reacted to Giannis Antetokounmpo’s confrontation with Tyrese Haliburton’s father

The Indiana Pacers edged out a dramatic 119-118 overtime victory against the Milwaukee Bucks . While Tyrese Haliburton 's game-winning shot over Giannis Antetokounmpo lit up Gainbridge Fieldhouse, the postgame headlines were stolen by a courtside altercation between Giannis and Haliburton's father, John. Fans online are not happy with John’s move, as many are asking the NBA to ban him from the playoffs.Giannis Antetokounmpo was making his way off the court when John Haliburton approached him, waving a towel with his son's face on it and allegedly yelling, “This is what we do.” The bold move did not sit well with the two-time MVP, who interpreted the act as a blatant show of disrespect. Giannis responded, and the two ended up in a tense face-to-face standoff that required players and staff from both benches to intervene.Giannis later addressed the confrontation: “I believe in being humble in victory. That’s who I am,” he said in his postgame comments. “Some people will say when you win the game, you can talk s___ and say it’s a green light for you to be disrespectful. I disagree. I’ve won a championship, they haven’t.”The Bucks star added, “I feel like that’s very, very disrespectful.”Tyrese Haliburton didn’t shy away from the issue either. Addressing the incident in his postgame press conference, he took accountability for his father’s actions. “As far as the incident between Giannis and my pops, I had no idea until I got to the back and was shown the video. I don’t agree with what transpired... I don’t think that my pops was in the right at all there.”Fans online quickly shared their thoughts on the matter. Many demand a ban on John Haliburton from the NBA games as a form of punishment.“Better be banned for the rest of the playoffs for this dumb s*it,” one fan wrote on X.“Father should be banned for rest of playoffs,” another echoed the same.“Father a bad example of sportsmanship,” another wrote.“I’m glad i saw this angle cause Hali dad was deff in the wrong for taunting Giannis after a big loss like that,” another shared.“What a clown,” one fan condemned the action of John.“Why is he seeking out a 7 foot Greek god like that.

Remembering Gianna Bryant: A tribute to her legacy amid defaced murals and tough times



On Thursday, May 1, 2025, Vanessa Bryant marked what would have been her daughter Gianna “Gigi” Bryant’s 19th birthday with a touching Instagram post that resonated far beyond social media. Accompanied by a powerful image of Gigi in her basketball uniform, the post was a raw and emotional tribute from a mother who continues to carry the weight of an unimaginable loss. The moment was made even more emotional as it came just days after a beloved mural of Gigi and her father, Kobe Bryant, was vandalized in Los Angeles.From Los Angeles to global basketball circles, the name Gianna Bryant , known affectionately as “Gigi” and “Mambacita,” still echoes with deep meaning. On Thursday morning, Vanessa Bryant shared a birthday message on Instagram that read, “Happy birthday, Gigi! Mommy loves and misses you more than I could ever express. I love you Gianna. ❤️19 ♉️ 5/1 #Mambacita.” It was a simple yet deeply moving tribute that quickly garnered love and support from fans, athletes, and brands across the sports world.Gigi, the daughter of NBA legend Kobe Bryant , was just 13 when she and her father tragically died in a helicopter crash on January 26, 2020, along with seven others.Nicknamed “Mambacita,” Gigi was seen as the heir to Kobe’s legacy. He even trademarked the name for her in December 2019, recognizing her growing talent and fierce passion for basketball. She embodied the same Mamba Mentality that her father was known for—relentless, fearless, and unapologetically determined with a drive well beyond her age.Over the years, more than 330 murals have popped up across California honoring Kobe and Gigi. But just days before Gigi’s birthday, one of the most beloved murals in L.A., a portrait of the father and daughter, was defaced with black paint. The timing hit hard. It rattled fans and added even more emotional weight to a week that was already tough for Vanessa, who also has a birthday coming up on May 5.To honor Gigi, Nike released a special edition “Mambacita” Kobe 9 sneaker on May 1, designed in partnership with the Bryant family. Inspired by Gigi’s drive and spirit, the shoe represents her commitment to excellence and her dream to elevate girls’ sports.Through the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation, Vanessa continues to champion those values, investing in youth athletics and pushing for gender equality in sports.Also Read: ‘Kobe' Chant: How a comedic skit sparked a global tradition and a classroom tribute that moved Vanessa Bryant May 1 will always be more than just a date for Vanessa Bryant; it’s a reminder of her daughter’s spirit, her dreams, and the powerful impact she left behind.

A lavish video with a sarcastic punch

Logan Paul - Still Humble (Official WWE Music Video) ft. YNG Martyr

Behind the scenes and star reactions

I Made Logan Paul's WWE Theme Song

The official theme song, created in collaboration with Australian rapper YNG Martyr , was released on Paul's YouTube channel and is now the centrepiece of his WWE entrance. Packed with luxury visuals and tongue-in-cheek lyrics, the video blends Paul’s trademark arrogance with a layer of self-mockery, reinforcing his role as one of WWE’s top villains.The video features Paul in private jets, mansions, poolside setups, and even a WWE ring - all symbolic of his over-the-top persona. It kicks off with the cheeky line, “How can I be so good-looking and still humble?” and continues to build on the mock-humility theme with lyrics about wealth, fame, and online haters.Fans online were quick to latch onto the song’s satirical tone. Comments ranged from “Bro is so humble he barely said anything in his own song” to “The least humble person making a song about how humble he is - best rage baiter 2025.” One user summed it up aptly: “This goes hard, and it fits his character perfectly.”The song already has hundreds of thousands of views and continues to trend, adding another successful digital project to Paul’s growing WWE résumé.YNG Martyr, who worked on the track and video, shared behind-the-scenes clips revealing how the idea came to life. Filmed in Puerto Rico, the production included late-night brainstorming sessions, high-end casino outings, and an all-access WWE shoot.WWE stars have also chimed in. Liv Morgan’s infamous mugshot, originally part of the video, was eventually cut - much to her amusement. Rhea Ripley, who also didn’t make the final edit, joked, “Autotune too? Damn. Didn’t think you were that lame.”Paul also took the opportunity to troll Dominik Mysterio backstage, showing him a spoof clip featuring his wife, Liv Morgan, and former on-screen partner Rhea Ripley all in one frame - a nod to ongoing WWE storylines and social media buzz.Following his high-profile win over AJ Styles at WrestleMania 41, Paul has now called out new World Heavyweight Champion Jey Uso. The tension escalated on RAW, with Paul getting super kicked by Uso, only to retaliate later with a surprise backstage attack.As WWE Backlash nears, fans are already speculating that Paul could make a legitimate run for the top title in WWE? If Logan Paul’s music video and recent momentum are anything to go by, he’s not just creating buzz - he’s turning it into storyline gold.","Logan Paul's official WWE theme song has been released.

Dallas Stars’ playoff control slips after Lian Bichsel’s Game 6 injury



Without Bichsel, Can Stars be able to hold the line?



Dallas Stars defenseman Lian Bichsel went down with a scary injury in Game 6 against the Colorado Avalanche , shaking up the team’s playoff momentum. The 20-year-old rookie has been a defensive standout this postseason, and his unexpected exit could have major consequences. With the series hanging in the balance, Bichsel’s health suddenly becomes Dallas’ biggest concern.The Dallas Stars were cruising with confidence, holding a 3-2 lead over the Colorado Avalanche in their high-stakes first-round playoff battle. With a roster stacked with scorers like Jason Robertson, Matt Duchene, and Roope Hintz, it’s easy to focus on the flash. But anyone really watching knows it’s been the defense, especially 20-year-old Lian Bichsel, that’s kept Colorado’s lethal offense in check.Midway through the second period of Game 6, Bichsel crashed violently into the boards during a routine battle with Jack Drury. It didn’t look ordinary and it didn’t feel minor. The young Swiss blueliner stayed down, clutching what appeared to be his shoulder, and needed help to leave the ice. Just like that, the Stars’ backbone looked broken.Bichsel may only be in his rookie season, but his impact has been anything but rookie-level. He’s been logging double-digit minutes with composure, physicality, and a maturity beyond his years. In fact, it’s Bichsel’s pairing with veteran Alex Petrovic that has helped keep Colorado’s sixth-ranked regular-season offense frustrated and limited.His ability to close gaps, deliver timely hits, and stay positionally sound has made him a surprise X-factor for Dallas in this series. The Stars' blue line depth has been one of their biggest postseason strengths and Bichsel’s emergence is a huge reason why.Also Read: Capitals finally win again but can Alex Ovechkin carry them any further? His absence, whether temporary or long-term, could dramatically alter the tone of this series. The Avalanche, hungry and dangerous, only need the smallest crack to seize momentum.

LeBron James was spotted drinking wine with friends after the Los Angeles Lakers’ playoff elimination

Just hours after the Los Angeles Lakers were eliminated from the NBA Playoffs, LeBron James didn’t appear to be sulking — in fact, quite the opposite. The 40-year-old superstar was seen in high spirits, leaving Wally’s Beverly Hills restaurant around 4:00 a.m. following the Lakers' Game 5 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves, which ended their postseason hopes.LeBron James dressed head to toe in Louis Vuitton and flashing a big grin, and for fans, he looked more like someone celebrating a win than mourning a defeat. He was accompanied by a tight-knit circle of friends, including longtime confidant and super-agent Rich Paul , and Corey Gamble. Both were also seen at Crypto.com Arena earlier that evening, witnessing the Lakers fall 103-96 in a series-ending loss. According to TMZ Sports, James carried a large water bottle and a back cushion as he made his way to his car, seemingly relaxed and unfazed.Despite the disappointing result, James still turned in a respectable individual performance, logging 22 points, 7 rebounds, and 6 assists. But the team’s overall lack of size and consistency doomed them against a deeper, more balanced Timberwolves squad.LeBron’s off-court reaction may have said more than the box score. As TMZ humorously noted, James seemed to embody the old sports adage: ""Win or lose, we still booze."" While it's not confirmed what the gathering entailed beyond the sighting, the vibe certainly felt more like a casual celebration than a mourning ritual.The lighthearted tone didn’t sit well with every fan, especially given how emotional Lakers Nation can be after a disappointing playoff run. But LeBron’s demeanor reminded everyone that life — and legacy — go on. After all, when you’ve won four championships, been named MVP four times, and shattered nearly every major record in NBA history, a first-round exit might sting less.The moment of wine, friends, and laughter was probably a coping mechanism, but the spotlight on James, even after the loss, remained.Also Read: Bronny James gets real about Los Angeles Lakers rookie year, future ambitions, and living up to his own name Additionally, James was also in the headlines as his retirement rumor sparked after the devastating loss that eliminated the Lakers from the playoffs.

My physio took a look at it after and cracked my back up, which felt like a relief. Hopefully it's nothing too serious. I'll do everything we can, and I can, to feel better for tomorrow. Based on the way it felt, it shouldn't be too much to worry about for Sunday,"" Ruud explained.Ruud's performance will see him return to the top 10 rankings after previously dropping to 15th in the world.Draper, who improved to 4-0 in career meetings with Musetti, reached his second Masters 1000 final of the year.""I felt like both of us, our quality didn't drop from the first ball.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Astrologer Greenstone Lobo: Is Yuzvendra Chahal's India career over?

Sachin Tendulkar at 52: Power, Pride, and a Nation’s Pulse

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders captain Ajinkya Rahane has reaffirmed his unwavering determination to return to the Indian team, saying he still harbours the “desire and hunger” to represent the country again. The 36-year-old last featured in a Test match in 2023 and has been out of India’s white-ball plans for nearly a decade, but his focus remains clear.""I would love to be back in the Indian set-up again. The desire, the hunger, the fire is still there. Fitness-wise, I am right up there. I just want to take one game at a time, thinking about this IPL right now, and then, let's see what happens in the future,"" Rahane said during Star Sports’ Press Room interaction on Friday.""I am a guy who will never give up. (I) always try and give my best on the field; give more than 100 per cent. It's always about that, focusing on controllable things. I have been playing domestic cricket as well and I am really enjoying my cricket at this moment,"" he added.Rahane’s most celebrated chapter in Indian colours came during the 2020–21 Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, where he led an injury-depleted side to a historic 2-1 Test series win. Despite that high, he soon found himself sidelined as younger talent emerged and took centre stage.""Every day when I wake up, it's always about what goals I want to achieve. For me, there is nothing higher than representing your country,"" he reiterated.""I want to represent my country. I want to wear those Indian colours again. During (the) off-season, I train for two-three sessions a day. I feel at this moment, for me, keeping myself really fit is really important, recovery is really important,"" he said.""(I am) focusing on my diet as well...the motivation to do well for India, it's still there. I am enjoying my cricket, that is the important thing. I am still passionate. I still love the game.""As the conversation shifted towards IPL 2025 and KKR’s campaign, Rahane expressed full support for out-of-form vice-captain Venkatesh Iyer , who has struggled for consistency. With the defending champions needing to win all four of their remaining games to stay in playoff contention, pressure is mounting.Iyer, the franchise’s costliest buy at Rs 23.75 crore, has only managed scores of 60 and 45 of note this season. In the last four games, he has accumulated just 28 runs. But Rahane is backing his deputy to bounce back.""Every player goes through that phase where he is trying his best but the performance is not coming. He is a quality player. We all know that he has done well for the franchisee in the past, (he has) won the matches for the team as well,"" he said.""It's important from management (and) leadership group point of view (that) we back him. He has been working really hard. People generally only see about the results and the outcome. But the hard work which all the players are doing, that is really important.""""From my point of view, we are completely backing Venkatesh Iyer. He is just one innings away. You can probably see one good innings from him in next four games,"" he added.Rahane also admitted that the team’s opening combinations haven’t clicked consistently.""Sunil Narine has done well in the past for us. This year, we started with Quinny (Quinton de Kock). Quinny played a very good knock. But again, he couldn't capitalise on that. He is trying hard. He is trying his best. But now, we have to look at the positives rather than what is not working for us,"" he said.""Obviously, the errors (have) happened and that can happen in this format. You want your players to play with freedom, play sometimes with high-risk cricket, so we are bound to make errors.""""I don't like to pinpoint on any players or any particular number. Everyone has to contribute...It's not happening, yes. I accept that.""Looking ahead, Rahane emphasized the importance of focusing one match at a time, especially with upcoming games against Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings, both already eliminated from the playoff race.""When teams are out, they have got nothing to lose and they come with a different mindset to play the game. For us, it's important to go out there with the right mindset (and) right attitude on that particular day and give our best,"" he said.",Kolkata Knight Riders captain Ajinkya Rahane wants to return to the Indian team.

What’s the tile game Meghan Markle played on Netflix? A beginner’s guide to mahjong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/whats-the-tile-game-meghan-markle-played-on-netflix-a-beginners-guide-to-mahjong/articleshow/120736644.cms,"Meghan Markle played the game of Mahjong in her Netflix series

From the Qing dynasty to pop culture

How is mahjong played?

Connor Wan, a 29-year-old British-Chinese artist, learned mahjong while visiting family in Hong Kong. He enjoyed it so much that he started the Four Winds Mahjong Club in London, and later brought it to Toronto after moving there in 2024. “Moving countries is hard, especially when you don’t know anyone,” he said. The club became popular quickly, not as a place for gambling, but for making friends and celebrating Asian culture. Nicole Wong, a writer and audio producer from California, started playing mahjong as a teenager with her grandparents. She later began The Mahjong Project in 2019 to share the game’s cultural stories and organise pop-up game nights. This year, she published a book called Mahjong: House Rules from Across the Asian Diaspora. Nicole says the sound of the tiles is especially powerful. “Mahjong is more than just fun,” she says. “It has a deep history and brings back strong memories.” In Toronto, Robyn Feldberg has taught over 250 people how to play mahjong through her courses. She donates all the money—about $50,000 so far—to charities like Save A Child’s Heart. She says the game is especially popular with young mothers who want a fun way to relax and connect with others. “They tell me, ‘We want something that’s just for us,’” she said.

A centuries-old Chinese game called mahjong is having a modern revival across continents, from luxury cruise ships and trendy hotel lounges to Meghan Markle’s Netflix series.In the sixth episode of her docuseries With Love, the Duchess of Sussex invites friends for a cosy game night – playing mahjong, reports the Globe and Mail.The four-person tile-based game, traditionally associated with Chinese culture, is now catching on with new generations across the globe. “The game itself is really so fun,” says Markle. “But what was so great was the idea of learning something new with your friends, together... the mahjong becomes the background of the expansion of friendship. It’s the feeling of community.”Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China. Traditionally played with 144 tiles, the game blends skill, strategy and a touch of luck. Players pick and discard tiles to form winning hands, much like the card game rummy.The game’s expansion across the world has now erupted into a full-blown trend. The World Mahjong Championship was recently held in Mississauga, Ontario – the first time it’s been hosted in North America. Hotels such as the Ace Hotel New York and Thompson Hotel Dallas regularly hold mahjong-themed nights.Fans with money to spare are buying fancy mahjong sets from Hermès, Louis Vuitton, and Ralph Lauren. Some are even splashing out on luxury tables that shuffle the tiles automatically – costing over $4,500.Even cruise ships have joined the trend, offering mahjong tournaments and special rooms just for playing the game.Mahjong is played with 144 tiles. Players begin by shuffling the tiles face down. Everyone rolls dice and the highest roller becomes the dealer. Each player picks 36 tiles and builds a wall—two rows of 18 tiles. The walls are pushed forward, creating a space in the middle for discards. Each player then draws 13 tiles (the dealer starts with 14), and the game begins.Players take turns drawing one tile and discarding one, always keeping 13 tiles in hand. You can draw a new tile or pick up someone’s discarded one. If a discarded tile helps complete a set (called a meld), you can grab it, announce the set, and show the tiles. To win, a player must have four melds (like three or four matching tiles or a sequence of three in a suit) and one pair (two matching tiles)—making 14 tiles total.There are five types of tiles: Bamboo, Characters, Dots (these are the three main suits), and special tiles called Honors (Dragons and Winds) and Bonus (Flowers and Seasons). Each suit goes from 1 to 9. Honors and Bonus tiles add extra excitement but aren't needed to win. Mahjong mixes strategy and memory with a bit of luck—and it’s all about building the right sets before your opponents do.For many mahjong fans, it’s not just a game but a deeply social experience.","Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China.

What is Pope League? TikToker creates viral fantasy game around papal conclave,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/what-is-pope-league-tiktoker-creates-viral-fantasy-game-around-papal-conclave/articleshow/120763819.cms,"(Source: itismaxhooray/Instagram)

As the world mourns the passing of Pope Francis , a TikToker has found a viral way to keep younger audiences engaged in the otherwise secretive process of choosing the next Pope by turning it into a fantasy league, reports The Washington Times.The papal conclave , set to begin on May 7 at the Vatican, will see cardinals from across the globe gather behind closed doors to vote for the next head of the Catholic Church . While the centuries-old process is steeped in tradition, one content creator on TikTok is bringing a modern twist to it.The Tik Toker named Max, going by the username of @itismaxhooray has launched what he calls the Pope League , a fantasy football-style game where users pick a cardinal and earn points based on how their pick performs in the voting rounds.“There are 10 times the number of people in this sweepstakes as there are cardinals in the Catholic Church, making it bigger and therefore more legitimate than the real conclave,” Max was quoted as saying by the Independent.The idea quickly went viral. The Washington Times reported that over 2,000 people signed up for the game on the very first day, after Max’s videos were viewed more than 100,000 times. Participants can earn ""Pope points"" and even imagine themselves “becoming the next Pope” through the game.The real conclave is expected to be closely watched, especially since most of the cardinals voting were appointed by Pope Francis himself. This has raised questions about whether the next Pontiff will continue the current path of reform or shift to a more moderate direction.Pope Francis died on April 21 at the age of 88 in Vatican City. His funeral was attended by world leaders, dignitaries, and thousands of mourners from around the globe.","The papal conclave, set to begin on May 7 at the Vatican, will see cardinals from across the globe gather behind closed doors to vote for the next head of the Catholic Church.

(AP)

A night meant for baseball glory turned tragic when Kavan Markwood , a 20-year-old former college football player, fell 21 feet from the stands at PNC Park during the Pirates vs. Cubs game on Wednesday. The terrifying moment, caught on video, has gone viral across social media platforms, drawing concern and sympathy from fans nationwide.The incident unfolded just as Andrew McCutchen delivered a clutch two-run double in the bottom of the seventh inning, giving the Pittsburgh Pirates a 4–3 lead. As cheers erupted, cameras and spectators captured the moment Markwood tumbled from above the iconic Clemente Wall, landing on the warning track in right field.The game was paused for about 10 minutes while EMS, police, and on-field staff rushed to assist. Markwood was quickly transported to Allegheny General Hospital, where he remains in critical condition. Officials have said the fall is being treated as accidental.The viral video has since stunned sports fans and raised questions about stadium safety. While authorities have not released the footage officially, clips circulating online show the immediate shock in the stadium as the crowd realized what had happened.Later identified by the South Allegheny School District, Markwood is a McKeesport native and a former linebacker for Wheeling University. He played five games in 2023 and was known for his grit, strength, and leadership.“He’s a fighter. He’s touched a lot of lives at South Allegheny,” said school spokesperson Laura Thomson. “We’re a small community. He’s a household name here.”Pirates Chairman Bob Nutting called the fall a “terrible accident” and said the organization was heartbroken: “It was one of the most difficult moments many of us have ever experienced… Pirates baseball is a community, and our fans are like family.”Though the Pirates snapped their three-game losing streak with McCutchen’s seventh-inning heroics, the night was defined not by the win, but by the horrifying scene that played out in real time — and online.","Kavan Markwood, a 20-year-old former college football player, fell 21 feet from the stands at PNC Park during the Pirates vs. Cubs game on Wednesday.

IPL 2025 | Kagiso Rabada: 'Even a No. 10 can hit a six... there's no mystery anymore'

TimesofIndia.com

No matter the sport, the concept and idea of home advantage makes a difference to a team. There is a sense and reasonable argument behind the idea: the home team understands the conditions, understands the surface, has vehement fan support and these factors can make a difference between winning and losing.The phenomenon holds true across sports and was the factor behind Barcelona's monumental 38-game winning streak at home in the UEFA Champions League, a run that spanned seven years. It was also a central factor behind Oklahoma City Thunder topping the NBA Western Conference in 2024-25 as they stitched a 35-6 win-loss record at home - the best in the league.But when it comes to cricket, though, the concept of home advantage gets a little foggy.Sure, India had a run of 18 consecutive Test series won at home, a run that began in 2013 and was shattered by New Zealand last year. During that jaw-dropping feat, India won 42 matches, lost four and drew six. The Men in Blue also hold the record for the longest home streak in T20Is, going 17 series unbeaten from 2019 to now.Some of the factors that tip the scale towards the home side in international cricket are: familiarity with the stadiums and the conditions; knowledge of the pitch and ability to dictate things; ability to stay with friends/family instead of hotels and last, but not the least, backing of a passionate crowd.But these factors don't necessarily hold true when it comes to franchise T20 leagues such as the Indian Premier League (IPL). With local, Indian and international players making up the squads, most of these factors are nullified.Yet, there are the likes of Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians who have strong home records. CSK made Chepauk their fortress with 72 wins out of 113 played, a win-loss record of 1.800. Then there are fellow five-time IPL champions MI who have won 68 of 115 home matches, a win-loss record of 1.478.This year, though, CSK have had a year to forget - in general and at home. On April 25, as they went down to Sunrisers Hyderabad, it accounted for their fifth defeat at MA Chidambaram Stadium. They've never lost more at home in a single season.After their thumping against Royal Challengers Bengaluru on March 28, coach Stephen Fleming argued they're not getting any 'home advantage'.""Well, as we've been telling you for a number of years, there was no home advantage at Chepauk. We haven't been able to read the wickets here in the last couple of years. So, it's not new. We are trying to come to grips each day with what we get, and we don't know.""The gripe with home surface isn't new and Fleming certainly wasn't the only voice that had criticism for the curators. Ajinkya Rahane, Zaheer Khan and Chandrakant Pandit all questioned the lack of support for home teams from the curators. Cricketer-turned-commentator Simon Doull went to the extent of suggesting that defending champions KKR should move away from the Eden Gardens if the curator doesn't pay heed.KKR's home record this season hasn't been great. They've played five at Eden Gardens, winning just one and losing three with one getting rained off. With two home matches remaining, and IPL playoff chances on the line, they would hope for a turn in fortunes starting Sunday against Rajasthan Royals.The rules, however, don't allow franchises to dictate the condition of the surface. As franchises only take the grounds on loan from the BCCI, they have no say on how the surface should be prepared.""A BCCI curator is not accountable to any franchise. There is no clear guidelines as such from the BCCI also,"" a source close to developments on the ground told TimesofIndia.com. ""There's been no meeting of curators since long (time).""The franchise(s) do love to put blame on the curators. Instead of blaming the curators, they should see the quality of cricket they are playing.""The franchises play at a certain venue for two months but forget that entire year there is a BCCI tournament (different age-groups) are happening. If not BCCI then state association play their leagues, conduct camps and other stuff.""The curators are following the guidelines that has been made by former BCCI chief curator Daljit Singh three decades ago...,"" added the source. Gujarat Titans COO Colonel Arvinder Singh questioned the point of the discussion around surfaces when the rules are crystal clear.""The rules of the game are very clear and they are common for everybody. No franchise has any right to say, 'I want this kind of a pitch'. That's not something that the rules allow you to do,"" he told""The home advantage has to stem from the fact that that is your home. You are supposed to know those conditions better than anybody else who's coming because that is where you play most of your games, where you practice. So from that perspective, if you're looking at a home advantage, well, why not? You deserve all the home advantage that you can take.""To say that I need home advantage because I want this kind of a pitch. Sorry, I don't think that cuts any ice with anybody,"" he added.Then there are question marks over the ethics of the sport if the surfaces are skewed towards a certain team or certain style of play.""What's the point of playing if the conditions are just going to be the same?,"" questioned South Africa and Gujarat Titans seamer Kagiso Rabada in an exclusive conversation withThis IPL season, in the 50 matches played until Mumbai Indians' win over Rajasthan Royals at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur on May 1, only 20 were won by the home side. Of the remaining matches, 28 have gone the visiting team's way with one, between Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals being decided in a Super Over, and one match getting washed out.There's still some matches to go before the IPL 2025 playoffs kick in but this year is not a one-off in seeing home sides struggle. During IPL 2023, of the 74 matches, 29 were won by the hosts while 44 went the away side's way. And then in IPL 2022, there were 34 home wins and 40 away wins across the 74 matches.Conversely, IPL 2018 followed the opposite script. In the 60 matches that season, 38 were won by home teams and 22 by the visitors. The balance was tipped last year as well with 42 home wins and 29 away wins in 72 matches.","Chennai Super Kings have a record of 1,478-1,478 at home in IPL. Mumbai Indians hold the record for the longest home streak in T20Is, going 17 series unbeaten from 2019 to now.

Astrologer Greenstone Lobo: Is Yuzvendra Chahal's India career over?

NEW DELHI: Gujarat Titans bounced back in style with a commanding 38-run win over Sunrisers Hyderabad on Friday, thanks largely to a sparkling captain’s knock from Shubman Gill The right-hander set the tone early and anchored a ferocious batting effort that saw GT post a daunting 224/6 — a total that proved well beyond SRH’s reach.Gill was in sublime touch, crafting a scintillating 76 off just 38 deliveries. From the very first over, he looked in control, flicking Mohammed Shami for a stylish six to get the scoreboard ticking.Alongside the in-form Sai Sudharsan (48 off 23), Gill punished the SRH attack with elegant strokeplay, taking the team to 87 without loss in under seven overs.He was particularly severe on Pat Cummins, hammering the Australian for a four and a six in an over that summed up GT's dominant start. He reached his fifty off just 25 balls, showcasing impeccable timing and placement, especially through the off-side.Even after Sudharsan’s dismissal, Gill maintained the momentum, finding support in Jos Buttler (64 off 37), who helped lift GT beyond the 200 mark.Gill’s innings, though cut short by a run-out on 76, laid the perfect platform. The skipper also showed his passion in the field, seen engaging in a heated conversation with the umpires over a DRS call involving Abhishek Sharma.On the bowling front, Prasidh Krishna starred with a miserly 2/19 in four overs, including the prized wicket of Travis Head, brilliantly caught in the deep by Rashid Khan.Despite a lone fight from Abhishek Sharma (74 off 41), SRH faltered under the climbing asking rate, ending at 186/6.With this win, Gujarat Titans not only solidified their playoff hopes but also sent a clear message; with Shubman Gill leading from the front, they're not done yet.",Gujarat Titans beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by 38 runs. Captain Shubman Gill top scored with 76 off just 38 deliveries. Jos Buttler (64 off 37) and Sai Sudharsan (48 off 23) also scored half-centuries.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120833266,imgsize-45972,width-400,resizemode-4/Shubman-Gill.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The qualifying mark for the men's javelin throw at the World Athletics Championships is the same as the Olympics: 85.50 metres. At the halfway stage of the Asian Games 2022 final in Hangzhou, Kishore Jena had already crossed that mark with a mighty 86.77m throwNot long after, he bettered that with a sensational 87.54m (a new personal best), placing himself in the gold medal position.But then came Neeraj Chopra , launching the javelin to a staggering 88.88m to clinch the coveted gold.For Odisha-born Jena, it was a silver. Yet, not a single trace of disappointment was visible on his face.As the crowd at the Hangzhou Olympic Sports Park Main Stadium, famously known as the ""Big Lotus"", looked on, Jena was seen jumping, hugging Neeraj in pure joy, clicking pictures, and taking selfies under a shared tricolour, moments that soon went viral across social media.Back home, Jena received as much love as the Olympic champion.His resolve now hardened, and he began training with a singular focus: to challenge Neeraj in Paris 2024.But with the Olympics two months away, just as preparations picked up steam, trouble struck.""Back in May, I was in Patiala. During a practice throw, I felt something in my left ankle,"" Jena told TimesofIndia.com.The pain was tremendous, not just physically, but mentally too, as his Olympic dream had just taken a hit.The Paris 2024 Olympics arrived; Kishore Jena pressed on but couldn’t qualify for the final round.“I thought if I go for surgery before the Olympics, I’ll lose too much time. But later, I was told surgery was the only permanent fix. Without it, proper recovery wasn’t possible,” said the 29-year-old.On October 4, Jena underwent surgery.“Now everything's fine. The doctors said the ankle just needs time to adapt. There’s a 7–8 month gap in training, so it’s readjusting,” he smiled.Last month, Jena made his competitive return at the Indian Open in Chennai.Though his best effort of 75.99m wasn’t much to write home about, for someone who had struggled to walk just a few months ago, it was a personal victory.At the Federation Cup in Kochi later in April, Jena threw 77.82m, missing the podium by just 0.02m. Sachin Yadav took gold with 83.86m, followed by Yashvir Singh (80.85m) and Sahil Silwal (77.84m).Meanwhile, the athletics world was abuzz with the announcement of the Neeraj Chopra Classic ( NC Classic ), a prestigious 'A' category Continental Tour Gold event by World Athletics.Indian stars like Sachin, Rohit Yadav, and Sahil were named in the lineup released on Tuesday, but Kishore Jena’s name was notably missing.""I had been trying to get an entry into it for a while, but the throws just weren’t landing well, so it felt like maybe it wouldn't happen this time. I was like, if it doesn't happen this year, that's okay. I thought I would try again next year,"" Jena added.Then came the call. Under the evening Mumbai sky on Wednesday, Jena’s phone rang. On the other end was double Olympic medallist Neeraj Chopra.""Around 8:20 or 8:25, I got a call from Neeraj bhai. He said he had spoken to the management and that I should be playing. That’s how the conversation started,"" he said.This wasn’t their first conversation about it. Even earlier, messages from Neeraj had encouraged him to participate. But with the Diamond League’s Doha leg looming and a notable dip in performance, Jena wasn’t sure he could manage both.Perhaps the Wednesday night call was the push he needed. On Thursday, Jena was officially added to the NC Classic lineup as its latest entrant.""We had been keen to include Jena, but were waiting for the confirmation since he’s just returned from injury and is also preparing for the Diamond League,"" a source close to the developments told TimesofIndia.com.Before stepping into the high-profile NC Classic on May 24 at Bengaluru’s Kanteerava Stadium, Jena, however, has a bigger target: to breach the all-important 85.50m barrier at the upcoming Doha Diamond League on May 16.""The goal is definitely to qualify for the World Championships through that,"" concluded Jena, who will leave for Qatar on May 14.ALSO WATCH:","Kishore Kumar Jena wins silver in the men's javelin throw at the Asian Games 2022.

Poll Who was the standout performer for Gujarat Titans in their recent match against Sunrisers Hyderabad? Sai Sudharsan Prasidh Krishna Jos Buttler Shubman Gill

NEW DELHI: Gujarat Titans stormed back to form with a commanding 38-run win over Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL 2025 on Friday. The win was powered by explosive half-centuries from Shubman Gill and Jos Buttler , with Prasidh Krishna’s clinical spell capping off a complete performance. The loss all but ended SRH’s playoff hopes, while GT gave their campaign a timely boost.Batting first, the Titans posted a formidable 224/6, riding on a fiery 87-run opening stand between Gill and Sai Sudharsan. Gill smashed a 38-ball 76, while Sudharsan’s 48 came off just 23 deliveries. Jos Buttler then took over, hammering 64 from 37 balls to power GT past 200.SRH began their chase positively but failed to maintain momentum, finishing on 186/6. Abhishek Sharma was the lone warrior with a 41-ball 74. Despite his efforts, the asking rate climbed beyond reach, especially after the dismissal of Travis Head via a sensational catch by Rashid Khan, who covered significant ground from deep square leg and changed direction mid-run to grab the ball.Prasidh Krishna was once again outstanding with the ball, returning figures of 2/19 in his four overs. The only concern for GT was Ishant Sharma limping off the field before completing his spell.SRH’s bowlers had no answers early on, as Mohammed Siraj leaked 22 runs in his first two overs and Ishant gave away 20 in his first spell. Shubman Gill launched the GT innings with a six off Mohammed Shami and continued to dominate, especially against Pat Cummins, taking 17 off one over that included a powerful six over deep mid-wicket.Sudharsan toyed with Shami, hitting him for four consecutive boundaries. The pair put on 82 in the powerplay. Leg-spinner Zeeshan Ali finally broke the partnership by having Sudharsan caught behind off a googly.Gill carried on fluently, reaching his half-century in 25 balls with a stylish drive through extra cover. Buttler, in excellent touch, also crossed the 4000-run milestone in IPL with a towering six off Ansari.Gill survived a drop on 66 by Cummins off Harshal Patel but was soon run out, thanks to Harshal’s sharp throw from short fine-leg and a clever deflection onto the stumps by Klaasen.In a tense moment, Gill was seen arguing animatedly with the umpires over a review involving Abhishek Sharma, who tried to pacify the GT skipper.Ultimately, Gujarat’s clinical batting and disciplined bowling proved too much for SRH, who are now staring at elimination.",Gujarat Titans beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by 38 runs in IPL 2025. Shubman Gill and Jos Buttler both hit half-centuries for the Titans. Prasidh Krishna took 2/19 in his four overs for GT.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120833131,imgsize-69554,width-400,resizemode-4/GT-celeb2-0205-IPL.jpg"

A Day That Marked a Shift



Black Tuesday for Sporting Legends: Ronaldo, Messi, Dhoni, and LeBron All Crumble on April 30April 30, 2025, will go down as one of the most sobering days in modern sports memory. Four of the world’s most iconic athletes—Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi , M.S. Dhoni , and LeBron James—each saw their teams knocked out of major competitions in stunning fashion, triggering reactions ranging from heartbreak to harsh public scrutiny.Cristiano Ronaldo's pursuit of silverware with Al-Nassr came to another bitter end after a 3-2 loss to Japan’s Kawasaki Frontale in the AFC Champions League semi-final. Despite boasting 75% possession and fielding stars like ex-Liverpool forward Sadio Mané and former Arsenal midfielder Marcelo Brozović, the Saudi side failed to convert dominance into victory. Ronaldo missed a clear chance in stoppage time and looked visibly distraught post-match, talking to himself and making odd gestures, behavior that raised further concerns among fans. With no major titles this season, frustrations continue to mount for both the star and Al-Nassr supporters.In Chennai, M.S. Dhoni’s return to the captaincy couldn’t save the Chennai Super Kings . A four-wicket defeat to Punjab Kings at Chepauk marked CSK’s fifth home loss of the season and confirmed their elimination from IPL 2025 with just two wins in ten matches, the worst record in the league.The once-mighty fortress of Chepauk now mirrors the decline of a team that has fallen steadily since 2020. Dhoni, 43, stepped back into leadership after Ruturaj Gaikwad was ruled out with injury but couldn’t arrest the freefall. The five-time champions were the first team knocked out of the playoffs race, a fall from grace that punctuates the end of an era.Across the Atlantic, Lionel Messi's Inter Miami were thoroughly outplayed by Vancouver Whitecaps in the CONCACAF Champions Cup semifinal. A 3-1 loss on the night completed a 5-1 aggregate defeat. Despite Messi’s early involvement—threading a pass that led to Jordi Alba’s ninth-minute goal—Miami’s backline was torn apart.Vancouver’s relentless attack exposed Miami’s aging midfield and slow defence. Messi had a few half-chances but remained largely peripheral. After the match, Javier Mascherano admitted: “Although it was the first time the club had advanced to the semifinals, the defeat hurts us a lot... we have to accept that our opponents outplayed us.”The loss not only ended Messi’s continental hopes but further spotlighted the limitations of Miami’s star-powered, yet increasingly sluggish, squad.In Los Angeles, LeBron James and the Lakers were eliminated from the NBA playoffs following a 103-96 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Despite a 50-win season and homecourt advantage, the Lakers were outscored in every fourth quarter of the series.But amidst the disappointment, LeBron found solace in the personal. Sharing the court with his son Bronny James ranked as the pinnacle of his career: “Number one for sure. That’s easy. That’s not even close.”Bronny, who split his rookie season between the Lakers and their G League affiliate, showed promise and poise. “Just pushing through and growing at the same time is something to be proud of,” he said.Lakers head coach JJ Redick was praised by LeBron for his composure in his debut season, despite the early exit. Luka Doncic, recently traded to LA, echoed the sentiment but admitted: “It’s tough to get that chemistry on the court without any practices.”April 30 wasn’t just a bad day for four sports icons. It was a symbolic reckoning, an inflection point where age, form, and transition collided. The weight of legacies clashed with the brutal demands of present-day competition, leaving fans and critics alike to wonder if the torch has truly begun to pass.","Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, M.S.

Sunrisers Hyderabad suffered their seventh defeat in IPL 2025 , losing to Gujarat Titans by 38 runs at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Friday.

Additionally, no more than three teams should finish with more than 14 points for SRH to have a chance at qualifying through net run rate.The team's journey in IPL 2025 has been inconsistent. They started with a victory against Rajasthan Royals but faced defeats against Lucknow Super Giants, Delhi Capitals, and Kolkata Knight Riders.
