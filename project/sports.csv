Isaac Guerendo Injury Update: 49ers Running Back Set To Return For Thursday’s Match,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/isaac-guerendo-injury-update-49ers-running-back-set-to-return-for-thursdays-match/articleshow/116265757.cms,"A Moment During Match (Image Via AP News)

49ers' Isaac Guerendo Reportedly Will Play Against Rams Despite Last Week’s Foot Injury



49ers rookie RB Isaac Guerendo has a foot injury and is listed as questionable for Thursday's game against the Rams. Despite this, he is expected to play through the injury, as per ESPN's Adam Schefter.The San Francisco 49ers' running game is already at risk, with Christian McCaffrey and Jordan Mason both out due to injuries. If Guerendo does play, he could potentially take on a significant role in the backfield. In his recent performance against the Bears, he showed his prowess with 15 carries for 78 yards and two touchdowns, as well as two catches for 50 yards.Guerendo left Sunday's win with what head coach Kyle Shanahan called a possible foot sprain. Although Guerendo wasn’t concerned about his availability for "" Thursday Night Football ,"" as reported via NBC Sports Bay Area, the team is no doubt cautious.He exited in the fourth quarter when San Francisco held a 31-13 lead with just under 11 minutes to go.Christian McCaffrey, previously considered the top fantasy pick, has been limited to just four games this season due to injuries and is now on injured reserve, alongside Jordan Mason. Incidentally, Mason was also a reliable fill-in option earlier in the season. With their absence, Guerendo has stepped up and displayed his mettle as a fantasy force in Kyle Shanahan's offence.His impressive performance against the Chicago Bears, which included 78 rushing yards and two touchdowns also indicates that any 49ers running back from Shanahan’s roster can be a valuable asset in fantasy football if they’re given enough playing time. Shanahan's system is often plug-and-play regarding running backs and that often helps their opponents.As per recent reports, the 49ers have activated star linebacker Dre Greenlaw from injury. Greenlaw had been out since suffering a torn Achilles tendon in the Super Bowl, missing the entire 2024 offseason and the first 13 games of the season.The bottom line is that the 49ers cannot afford to lose this rivalry match; the Los Angeles Rams have more assets on their offensive end after their win against the Bills last week, and with Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp healthy.Also Read : The woman behind Jimmy Garoppolo: Meet his girlfriend","49ers rookie RB Isaac Guerendo has a foot injury and is listed as questionable for Thursday's game against the Rams.

Vinod Kambli Refuses To Let Go: Emotional Reunion With Sachin Tendulkar In Mumbai

Vinod Kambli Exclusive | Alcoholism | Rehab | Shane Warne | #TheVickeyLalwaniShow

For the first time since sparking concern at the Ramakant Achrekar memorial event a few weeks ago, former India cricketer Vinod Kambli has spoken about his recent health scare and reflected on his long-standing friendship with Sachin Tendulkar Kambli, 52, revealed that he has been battling a severe urine infection that led to his collapse a month ago. His family - wife Andrea, son Jesus Cristiano, and daughter Johanna - played a crucial role in his recovery.""I am better now. My wife takes care of me a lot. She took me to three different hospitals and told me, 'You have to get fit.' My son picked me up when I collapsed, and my daughter and wife stood by me throughout. The doctor told me to get admitted,"" Kambli shared during an interview with Vickey Lalwani on YouTube.Despite his struggles, Kambli remains determined to recover fully. ""I'm ready to go to rehab. I want to go there because I don't fear anything. My family is with me,"" he said, expressing gratitude for their unwavering support.Kambli's appearance at the Achrekar memorial event, where his visibly frail condition and emotional reunion with Tendulkar went viral, reignited conversations about their storied friendship. The duo famously forged a world-record 664-run partnership in a school match in 1988 and went on to represent India together.However, their relationship hit a rough patch in 2009 when Kambli publicly suggested that Tendulkar could have done more to help him during his struggles. Addressing the controversy after 15 years, Kambli clarified that his remarks were born out of frustration.""At that time, it came to my mind that Sachin didn't help. I was extremely frustrated. But Sachin did everything for me, including paying for my two surgeries in 2013. We spoke, and childhood friendship came forward,"" Kambli explained.Tendulkar's gesture of covering Kambli's medical expenses and their interactions at the Achrekar memorial event underscore the enduring bond between the two. ""Sachin told me how to play. I made nine comebacks. We are cricketers; we get hurt. When we get out, we also get hurt,"" Kambli added.Reflecting on his cricketing journey, Kambli acknowledged the highs and lows. A prodigious talent, he burst onto the scene in the early 1990s, becoming the first Indian to score back-to-back double centuries in Test cricket. His knock of 224 against England at Wankhede remains one of his cherished memories.""The double hundred at Wankhede, I will cherish the most. Achrekar sir was with me, and we had such a great team. I used to have fun battles with Muttiah Muralitharan and our other opponents,"" Kambli recalled.Despite his early success, Kambli's career was marred by inconsistency and off-field issues. He played his last Test in 1996 and ODI in 2000, finishing with a respectable Test average of 54.20 and 1084 runs including four centuries from 17 matches.Kambli's story remains one of unfulfilled potential, but his candid reflections and resilience in the face of adversity continue to inspire. ""My journey wasn't perfect, but I gave it my all. I'm grateful for the support of my family and friends like Sachin,"" he said.",Former India cricketer Vinod Kambli has spoken about his recent health scare and reflected on his long-standing friendship with Sachin Tendulkar.

Former Australian fast bowler Jason Gillespie has stepped down as head coach of Pakistan's Test team, citing frustrations with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). The PCB confirmed his resignation on Thursday, adding to the growing turmoil within the national cricket setup.In a statement, the PCB said: ""The PCB has named former Pakistan paceman Aaqib Javed as interim red-ball head coach following the resignation of Jason Gillespie."" Javed, already serving as the interim white-ball coach after Gary Kirsten’s departure in October, will now lead Pakistan in the two-Test series in South Africa starting December 26 in Centurion.Gillespie's resignation reportedly stemmed from a series of disagreements with the PCB, particularly following the board's decision not to renew the contract of his assistant, Tim Nielsen. Speaking during Pakistan's Test series against England, Gillespie hinted at his frustrations. ""I think there's always frustrations from time to time. It wasn't what I signed up for, I'll be completely honest,"" he told Sky Sports.The PCB's statement emphasized their focus on continuity amid the transition, with Javed's appointment aimed at ensuring stability during the South Africa tour. ""Aaqib Javed's first assignment as red-ball head coach will be the two-match Test series against South Africa during the ongoing all-format tour,"" the statement read.Gillespie's tenure saw mixed results. After a humiliating 0-2 whitewash against Bangladesh and an innings defeat to England, Pakistan rebounded to claim a 2-1 Test series victory against England on sharply turning tracks. Despite this success, Gillespie was removed from the selection panel, further straining his relationship with the PCB.His resignation mirrors that of Gary Kirsten, Pakistan's white-ball coach, who stepped down in October under similar circumstances. The PCB's frequent coaching changes - six different head coaches in four years - have drawn criticism for undermining long-term stability.The Pakistan team is currently in South Africa for a T20I and ODI series ahead of the Tests.

The soreness in his left foot has now sidelined LeBron James for a second straight game. After a four-day break, the Los Angeles Lakers confirmed that James would not participate in Friday's contest against the Minnesota Timberwolves.

NEW DELHI: The final match of the World Chess Championship between 18-year-old Indian Grandmaster D Gukesh and reigning champion Ding Liren witnessed a dramatic culmination of their gripping 14-game series in Singapore.On Thursday, the 14th game, a highly anticipated battle, swung decisively in Gukesh's favour after a critical blunder by Ding Liren, securing Gukesh’s historic triumph as the youngest world chess champion.The game began in a Nimzo-Indian structure, with both players opting for solid development.By the middlegame, Gukesh managed to create counterplay with his queenside pawns, especially with the brilliant 26...bxa3(!), which gave him a dangerous passed pawn.The position remained balanced until move 58, when Ding, under time pressure, miscalculated in a tense endgame. Ding’s crucial mistake occurred as he tried to activate his king and rooks in an effort to push for a draw.As It Happened: D Gukesh vs Ding Liren Game 14 However, his endgame manoeuvre inadvertently allowed Gukesh to trade down into a favourable position where his active pieces and superior pawn structure proved decisive.Gukesh skillfully exploited this error, turning what seemed like a drawn endgame into a victory.The final result was sealed after four hours of intense play.Gukesh’s strategy of relentless pressure throughout the match, coupled with his ability to capitalize on Ding’s momentary lapse, proved to be the winning formula.With a score of 7.5–6.5, Gukesh dethroned Ding and became the 18th World Chess Champion.The victory not only broke Garry Kasparov's long-standing record as the youngest champion, but it also marked a new era for Indian chess. Subsequently, Gukesh joins the legendary Viswanathan Anand as the second Indian to claim the title.Reflecting on the win, Gukesh shared, “I was dreaming this moment for the last 10 years.

Gukesh also became only the second Indian, after five-time champion Viswanathan Anand , to claim the title.The decisive moment came when Ding, under time pressure, blundered in an endgame that appeared destined for a draw. Gukesh, with a rook, bishop, and one-pawn advantage, tenaciously pressed on, turning the game in his favour. Ding slumped in despair as Gukesh, overwhelmed with emotion, buried his face in his hands.Fans erupted in cheers, with many Indian supporters chanting his name during the post-match press conference.

"Young Gukesh did not use chess engines; family, coach lent the fuel",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/young-gukesh-did-not-use-chess-engines-family-coach-lent-the-fuel/articleshow/116273731.cms,"FOLLOW THE LEADER: Gukesh exits the elevator towards the playing area, ahead of Game 14, with father Rajinikanth just behind

CHENNAI: Mere hours after D Gukesh pounced on a horrific lapse by Ding Liren in Game 14 of the World Chess Championship in Singapore on Thursday, and then like any boy true to his age, burst into tears from all the pent-up emotion, a video from 2018 started doing the rounds on social media.Soon gone viral, it was reminiscent of those similar grainy videos embedded in our consciousness - the 1989 news clip of a fresh-faced Sachin Tendulkar, before his selection to the Indian senior team; a 10-year-old Diego Maradona in 1971, effortlessly juggling the football and telling the interviewer that his ambition was to win the World Cup, or ""Copa del Mundo,"" as he would call it in Spanish.Gukesh was just 11 years and 6 months, when he was asked of his ambition. ""I believe I will be a world champion one day,"" was the reply.It was 2018. Magnus Carlsen was the undisputed champion of the world; a good handful of Indian players were far ahead of the little boy in the ratings, and you felt that Gukesh was probably taking a little too much on himself a little too early. But we all know how that turned out. Like Sachin, then barely 16, had told the late Tom Alter, ""I think this is just the start.""But then, isn't that what champions are made of? The Chennai boy knew he was ready to dig in to reach the top. Coming from a city that has produced Viswanathan Anand and boasts of a chess academy in every nook and cranny, the teenager would never be short of support. His alma mater, Velammal Vidyalaya , produces Grandmasters for fun, and he had the much sought-after Vishnu Prasanna as coach from a young age who guided him through his baby steps as a chess boy.But before all that come Gukesh's parents, absolute pillars of strength when they recognized their boy possessed a mind of steel and set about nurturing his dream. Father Rajinikanth, an ENT surgeon, and mother, Padma, a microbiologist, made significant sacrifices to make it work. Rajinikanth gave up on his career to travel alongside as his son tried to find a footing on the cut-throat world circuit. ""The biggest sacrifices were done by my parents"" Gukesh has often said. He repeated the same after becoming world champion on Thursday. ""We were not a very well-off family. There were financial struggles which I didn't realize…""""At some point in 2017-18,"" remembers Gukesh, ""We were running so low on money, I could only play tournaments and train because of my parents' friends. They came forward and sponsored to help me play. My parents had to endure so much and all the lifestyle changes that they made just so that I could get a chance to play.""The Chennai boy was determined to repose the faith his parents showed in him. Vishnu Prasanna explained his ward's hunger during his early days. ""He used to play a lot - about 230 games in a year. He used to train whenever he was not playing, even when he was travelling,"" Vishnu, himself a Grandmaster, told TOI.Once Gukesh grew a little older, he cut down on playing and replaced it with ""10 to 12 hours of practice"" every day. ""At each level, we tried to change his strategy,"" Vishnu remembers, ""We did not use chess engines etc. He used to train for 10 to 12 hours a day, including the time on physical fitness.""What makes Gukesh stand out is his ability to keep every distraction at length even as stardom tiptoes close. ""He has managed it somehow, he did not go for vacations and there were not a lot of moments when he wasn't training,"" Vishnu said, ""Everybody wants Gukesh's outcome, but they do not want his lifestyle or habits. I keep telling that to parents who bring their kids to me and hope to turn them into Gukesh one day.""You could say then that success has been a given in the Gukesh story over the past few years - a two-time individual Olympiad gold medallist, team gold medallist, Candidates winner before becoming India No. 1 by dethroning his mentor and hero, the legendary Anand.But there were difficult moments as well. It was such a different story this time a year ago. Forget becoming world champion, Gukesh wasn't sure whether he would make the Candidates even. It was at this point, the strength of his character and hunger to succeed kept him going. ""After the World Cup, things went horribly wrong for me,"" Gukesh had said, ""It was probably where I was at my lowest, clearly not handling the Candidates pressure well. We had about 20 days between the Grand Swiss and London Classic, and I talked with Vishnu Prasanna and second (Grzegorz Gajewski) a lot. I felt much better and had more clarity after those conversations,"" Gukesh remembered, adding that Gajewski kept reminding his that ""he is the best in the world"".Gajewski's words worked like magic. On Thursday, Gukesh proved that belief and dedication, can conquer mountains.","D Gukesh won the World Chess Championship in Singapore on Thursday. The Chennai boy was just 11 years and 6 months when he first said he wanted to be a world champion. His father Rajinikanth, an ENT surgeon, and mother, Padma, a microbiologist, made significant sacrifices.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116273720,imgsize-67742,width-400,resizemode-4/116273720.jpg"

When I was watching that match being played inside the glass box, I thought it would be so cool to be inside that box one day. When Magnus won, I thought I really wanted to be the one to bring back that title back to India. And realising this dream that I had for more than 10 years is the single most important thing in my life so far.""For the first time in 138 years, two contestants from Asia competed for the world chess championship crown.Getting a hold on himself after a very emotional few minutes after becoming the world champion, Gukesh spoke at length and thanked God for being with him whenever he needed.On the 55th move, when Ding made a blunder, Gukesh couldn't believe his eyes. He said, ""At first, I didn't see that I was winning. When I realised that I was winning, it was the best moment of my life.""Gukesh started his interaction by praising Ding. ""We all know Ding has been one of the best players for several years, and to see him struggling and under pressure, and the kind of fight he gave, shows what a true champion he is. He is the world champion for me.""Elaborating on his journey, Gukesh said, ""I started playing chess when I was 6.5 years old. I have been dreaming about this. I have been living for this moment for the past 10 years. All the chess players think about this moment, and very few get the chance. I am thankful to God for helping me to live this dream. This whole journey, starting from qualifying for the Candidates till here, could only be made possible by God.""He added, ""I am thankful to all the people who have been by my side in this journey. To thank each and every one, I need to prepare my speech because given the kind of emotion that I am feeling right now, I might say something stupid, so I will prepare something nice and thank everyone.""When asked what it feels like to shatter the record of being the youngest champion in history, Gukesh said, ""It means a lot. In 2017, I said that I wanted to be the youngest world champion. Now that this is not just a dream, it is a reality, that kid would be really happy.""On his best experience in Singapore, Gukesh said, ""The best part was when I entered the room for Game 1. Though it did not go my way, like I had earlier said about the 2013 match in Chennai, when I was in the stands as I did not get a seat, now to be sitting there and see the Indian flag next to me was the best moment.""On his emotional outburst after realising that he had won, Gukesh said, ""I did not really expect to win from that position. I was really going to press the position as long as I could. I thought we were going to play for 5-6 hours, and it was going to end in a draw, so I was preparing myself to fight it out in the tiebreaks. All these things were in my mind, but suddenly when I saw that 55th move rook f2 (blunder) and I saw this chance that it was actually done, that I had achieved my dream, I got emotional. I am not one who shows a lot of emotions, but this time could be forgiven.""On how he got into the act after losing the opening game of the match, Gukesh said, ""Losing the first game here was the toughest challenge. I knew it could happen, but after losing the first game, the way it went, was a bit humiliating. After the game, when I was walking back, a nice moment happened when Vishy Sir was in the lift, and he told me, 'I had 11 games, and you have 13 games'. That's the only thing he said, and I realised that it was a nice reminder that I would get my chances.""Despite becoming the youngest world champion, Gukesh remained humble and said Magnus Carlsen still remains the best and elaborated on his goal in chess. ""My aim is to be in the top level for longest time possible. I have just started my career, and I want to stay on top for a long time. Playing against Magnus in the world championship would be the toughest challenge in chess. It is up to Magnus, but I would love to test myself against the best player in the world.""",Dommaraju Gukesh became the youngest world chess champion in history.

'Gukesh's face told me I had just made a blunder'

Caissa, the chess goddess, smiled on D Gukesh on Thursday. He thanked her in return. The world championship crown, the one Magnus Carlsen took away from Viswanathan Anand in Chennai in 2013, is returning to India - the birthplace of chess.At 18, Gukesh is the youngest world champion the chess world has ever seen, the first teenager to wear the crown. Garry Kasparov , who held the record till Thursday evening, was 22 when he ascended the throne in 1985.When Ding Liren blundered in a seemingly equal and drawable position in the 14th and last game of the World Chess Championship in Singapore, Gukesh, the challenger, realised he would be the new monarch of the 64-square game.The World No. 5 could not hide his excitement and emotions. He smiled, covered his face and uncorked a winning move. Three moves later, Ding resigned to hand over the crown he held after beating Russia's Ian Nepomniachtchi via tiebreaks in Astana, Kazakhstan, last year.""I knew I could play on this game for 5-6 hours, but I was mentally prepared for tomorrow's tiebreaks,"" said Gukesh.Indeed, Ding was not expected to crack in this position - rook and light-squared bishop each with Gukesh having an extra pawn (2 vs 1). But the stage and time-pressure got to him as he played the only move on the 55th turn - without much provocation - which would end in a loss. Hence, it was no surprise that Gukesh first thanked the almighty after his moment of triumph.Ding had told chess24 on the eve of the last game that he was prepared for a long haul. But despite having white pieces and getting a decent position out of the opening, he was lured to play for the draw following Gukesh's 18th move (pawn to b5) after fearing for the worse without much reason.Being the champion does not mean I am the best player in the world,"" said Gukesh. ""It's motivating that someone (Magnus Carlsen) is at a very, very high level. That will help me to continue working hard.""Carlsen has withdrawn from the World Championship cycle that had helped Ding enter the fray last year. The five-time world champion had cited lack of motivation in classical time control and skewed 'effort vs reward ratio' for it.Thursday's game was heading towards a draw, and the match towards rapid tiebreaks. Considering Ding's experience and higher rating in shorter time controls, he was seen as the favourite in that phase.Finally, that was thrown out of the window much to the relief of the players as Gukesh won with a scoreline of 7.5-6.5 points. Gukesh won in 58 moves of Reti Opening, Kings Indian Attack variation from black pieces.Despite the path-breaking achievement, Gukesh did not lose his bearings. When Ding left the playing arena, Gukesh wept tears of joy but did not forget to rearrange his pieces and that of his opponent. He also bowed in front of the chess board before leaving the stage. In a show of great appreciation for his rival, Gukesh stood up when Ding was set to leave after finishing his part of the press conference and shook his hand. Till Ding left the hall, Gukesh was clapping for the Chinese.So, where did Ding go wrong? The Chinese brought his rook on the f2 square without realising that the rook exchange at that point would put cold water on all the resilience he had shown in this entire match. The 32-year-old Chinese's bishop was trapped on the 'a8' square, limited to just one diagonal. Plus, Gukesh's bishop was not only in a position to attack the rival's bishop but even his king was adjacent to complete even the bishop exchange followed by the rook exchange. And then with only two pawns vs one pawn remaining on the board, the situation was completely winning for Gukesh with more than an hour remaining on his clock.Ding said after the loss, ""Gukesh's face told me that I had just made the blunder. I was totally shocked. It was already not easy to draw the game. Maybe I just needed to wait (show patience). No game tomorrow. This tournament was my best performance of the year."" It underlined his overall struggle and how he raised his game in Singapore with wins in the first and 12th game after losing the third and 11th game. ""Considering yesterday's lucky escape (a draw in the 13th game), it's a fair result. I have no regrets.""","D Gukesh beats China's Ding Liren 7.5-6.5 to become 18th World chess champ at 18, the 1st teen ever - breaking Kasparov's record (22 yrs) and 2nd Indian after Viswanathan Anand.

The star batter, who has played just one Test in Brisbane without reward back in 2014, is fussing over his technique, putting in the hard yards & rallying the rest as India seek batting edge in crucial third Test...

IND vs AUS: India batting has been a major cause of worry

This Virat Kohli is like Sachin Tendulkar of 2011-13

BRISBANE: Step out of the Queensland Cricketers' Club members dining area and there's a unique vantage point right above the Gabba nets, offering a bird's eye view of the proceedings below.For those watching from here, through the four intense hours that India's top six sweated it out in sweltering heat and alarming UV levels, it was clear this batting unit is trying extremely hard to get its act together following the shellacking in Adelaide.Everybody, from KL Rahul to Rohit Sharma , put in the hard yards on Thursday but it was Virat Kohli who perfectly epitomized this renewed focus. He was a bundle of batting energy, hopping from one net to the other, facing pace, then more pace, fronting up against spin before spending a long time working on his technique and body position while facing throwdowns from the sidearm, or 'throwdown stick' as the Aussies call it.Kohli seemed a man on a mission even before hitting the hits, giving a long pep talk to the youngsters along with vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah , getting in some decent slip-catching practice before going deep within himself to iron out some perceived flaws.It was like watching a past master's frantic attempts to clear the cobwebs of the mind, to try and rediscover the poise and decisiveness of youth. Kohli is still very fit and far from being a spent force, of course. He has already done his bit as the series hits the halfway stage, having hit a century as India won in Perth. But he knows a decisive knock or two under pressure is what the team needs most from him.It is here, at the Gabba, with India on the ropes, that Kohli will be itching to contribute. He has played just once here and not done well. He knows the team is staring at either an early transition, or a delayed one if veterans like him and Rohit Sharma can rage against the dying of the light a bit longer. The transition will happen, nonetheless.For the moment, in the here and now, the spotlight is firmly on them. After the Perth ton, Kohli had said, ""I'm not the sort of guy who wants to hang around just for the sake of it. I just want to contribute to the team's cause.""In Perth, Kohli enjoyed the cushion of runs, with India already 321 ahead when he came out to the middle. He didn't have that cushion in Adelaide and faltered.In Perth, Kohli had the time to get his eye in before unleashing a range of strokes when he realized the team was waiting for him to get to three figures before declaring. In Adelaide, he was caught in two minds whether to reach out to a Mitchell Starc delivery, play or leave, and paid the price. In his second stint it was Scott Boland and again that nagging length, and the star batsman only managed to edge it to the 'keeper.In recent times, Kohli has had a tendency to commit on the front foot, but in Perth he used the depth of the crease well against the likes of Nathan Lyon. In the Brisbane nets on Thursday, he faced problems against deliveries just short of full length, playing and missing or edging against the likes of Jasprit Bumrah, Akash Deep and Mukesh Kumar.Lately, Kohli has found surprising ways to get out, like the Mitchell Santner full toss during the home series against New Zealand. Is it an eyesight thing? Are the trigger movements slow er? Only Kohli would know for sure, but it's possible to draw a distinct line at the point where the consistency starts to taper off—for someone who averaged 54.97 from 2011-19 and scored 27 Test tons, the years from 2020 till date have fetched him only three centuries and an average of 32.14. That's a steep decline, although he has still been impressive overseas of late.Kohli, then, has to break new ground at the Gabba, but he's not the only one. In India's last five Tests, against Australia here and New Zealand at home, the whole top six has collectively averaged a poor 27.47. Take just the last seven overseas Tests, and their collective average rises to 35.39. In Australia so far, across the two Tests, the top six averages only 28.13 across 24 innings, in spite of centuries from Yashasvi Jaiswal and Kohli.To make a strong comeback here, this team must find that elusive quality of consistency. Simply put, India must bat long. As Rohit Sharma had said after the defeat in the pink-ball Test, ""When you come to Australia the best chance of winning a Test match is by putting runs on the board."" Can Kohli inspire a top-six turnaround?","Virat Kohli has played just one Test in Brisbane without reward back in 2014. The star batter is fussing over his technique, putting in the hard yards & rallying the rest as India seek batting edge in crucial third Test. In India's last five Tests against Australia and New Zealand, the whole top six has collectively averaged 2747.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116271440,imgsize-44286,width-400,resizemode-4/116271440.jpg"

How can India still qualify for World Test Championship final?

BRISBANE: Steve Smith is discovering, just like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli before this tour to Australia, that extreme home conditions are not always conducive to late-career batting revivals.Both luck and form seem to have deserted Smith this year and without a turnaround at the Gabba, he risks falling into the rabbit hole of endless technical tweaks as the pressure grows to deliver.India's ageing stalwarts have discovered this the hard way, with the turning tracks at home negating any possibility of notching up high scores, like we saw in the series against New Zealand.After the Adelaide defeat, Rohit had said, ""We accept that when we play in India, we are trying to play in very difficult conditions. It's our choice and we know the big scores are not going to happen. But whenever we travel abroad the conditions are there to score runs.""It's unlikely Smith will agree Australian conditions are still batting-friendly, given the recent tendency to maximize advantage for the pacers at home, especially against teams from the subcontinent. Translating meagre returns at home to a windfall abroad isn't always easy either, especially when a string of low scores keeps playing on the mind or becomes a national obsession.Never the most orthodox of batters, Smith has had a horror run in 2024, averaging 23.2 from seven Tests. The drop in returns has been gradual-in his last 23 Tests he averages 35.75, and although his overall batting average stands at 56.09, the alarm bells have started ringing across Australia.In Perth in the first innings, he fell first ball to a monster of a delivery from Bumrah, and in the second he was hanging on until Siraj got one to straighten off the seam and take the edge. In Adelaide, the ill fortune continued as he tickled one down leg.At 35, Smith's best days are probably behind him, but if he gets going he can still punish India in this series. Teammate Mitchell Marsh , for one, is hoping for just such a turnaround.""We know he's one of our best players ever and I'm certainly backing him to get some runs,"" Marsh said here on Thursday. ""I'm probably not in a position to tell Steve Smith what he should work on. We know he's a class player and he's scored a lot of runs for Australia. At times when we've needed him, he always seems to step up.""Smith, who hit the nets with gusto here on Thursday, has already shunted himself up and down the order in recent times to get the runs-going on to open and then making a hasty return to his favourite No. 4 spot.With Jasprit Bumrah waiting to pounce, his job won't get any easier. But it's Smith, and India can't write him off till he faces his last ball of the series.","Steve Smith has had a horror run in 2024, averaging 23.2 from seven Tests.

New Zealand (from):

England have recalled seamer Matthew Potts for the third Test against New Zealand in Hamilton, with captain Ben Stokes looking to build depth in his bowling attack after already securing the series. Potts, who will take the new ball in the final Test starting on Saturday, replaces Chris Woakes in the squad.England clinched the series with dominant victories in Christchurch and Wellington, securing their first series win in New Zealand since 2008.Potts, 26, has had a mixed international career, since making his debut in 2022 against New Zealand at Lord’s, where he impressed on debut by taking seven wickets, including twice dismissing the legendary Kane Williamson . Despite his promising start, Potts has struggled to secure a permanent place in the team since then.Stokes praised Potts' potential, saying, ""He’s got a massive engine and he fully deserves another chance."" The England captain also emphasized the importance of giving opportunities to players who haven't featured regularly. ""Two-nil up, you put yourself obviously in an easier position to make that change,"" Stokes explained. ""We want to be giving experience to the guys who don’t necessarily always get the opportunity.""The recall of Potts reflects England's strategy of providing exposure to less experienced players, with none of the specialist bowlers in the squad - Potts, Brydon Carse, Gus Atkinson, and spinner Shoaib Bashir - having played more than 14 Tests.While Woakes has been solid in the series, taking six wickets at just under 30, Stokes clarified that his omission wasn't due to poor form. ""Chris Woakes came into the winter tours with a bit of scrutiny behind his away record, but I think what he's done has proven a lot of people wrong,"" Stokes said, highlighting Woakes' contributions in both Pakistan and New Zealand.On the New Zealand side, captain Tom Latham confirmed that Will Young would replace Devon Conway, who stayed home to attend the birth of his child. Latham, however, will wait to see the conditions at Seddon Park on Saturday before finalizing his XI, with spinner Mitchell Santner possibly replacing one of the seamers. Latham also hinted that veteran Tim Southee would feature in his 107th and final Test before retirement.Latham acknowledged New Zealand's underperformance in the series, saying, ""We know we haven’t played to our potential the last couple of games but hopefully we can put on a good showing for the fans."" With the series already decided, Latham's men are keen to prove themselves in front of their home crowd.Tom Latham (capt), Will Young, Kane Williamson, Rachin Ravindra, Daryl Mitchell, Mark Chapman, Tom Blundell, Glenn Phillips, Mitchell Santner, Nathan Smith, Matt Henry, Tim Southee, Will O'Rourke, Jacob Duffy.","England have recalled seamer Matthew Potts for the third Test against New Zealand in Hamilton.

How can India still qualify for World Test Championship final?

This Virat Kohli is like Sachin Tendulkar of 2011-13

Australia’s star batter Steve Smith is rethinking his training approach to combat a recent dip in form. He's adopted a ""less is more"" strategy, inspired by advice from former teammate Mike Hussey .Smith's performance has been under scrutiny, with only 19 runs across three innings in the first two Tests against India. This has raised concerns, especially given his return to his preferred number four batting position.Smith consulted Hussey, renowned for his late-career success, which included eight Test centuries after turning 35. Hussey suggested that reduced training could be more beneficial for older players.""It's well documented that him and Marnus (Labuschagne) in particular, they hit a lot of balls, they practise really hard and they do a great deal of preparation,"" Hussey said.Hussey’s advice stemmed from his own experience of maintaining peak performance later in his career. He emphasized the importance of mental and physical freshness over extensive training.""And I just said (to Smith), 'It's worth just thinking about how much you hit, and is it actually helping you, or is it slightly detrimental?'"" Hussey added.He elaborated on his philosophy, contrasting the needs of younger and older players. Younger players benefit from high training volume, while older players benefit from prioritizing freshness.""I think as a young player, volume is really important. But as you get older, I certainly found from my own perspective, it wasn't about hitting more balls and working yourself into the ground. It was more about coming into games as mentally and physically fresh as you possibly can."" Hussey explained.Smith implemented Hussey's suggestion by skipping a training session before the Adelaide Test. He aimed to enter the match feeling refreshed. Unfortunately, the strategy didn't immediately pay off. Smith was dismissed for only two runs, caught off a Jasprit Bumrah delivery.""In an ideal world, I probably wouldn't hit as many balls as I do in the lead-up,"" Smith admitted.Smith acknowledged that while less training is generally preferable, he sometimes needs extra sessions to address specific technical aspects. He finds himself caught between the two approaches.""It's just if I need to feel a bit better with something or work on a certain movement or whatever, I might need that last session."" Smith clarified.Smith's recent dismissals, particularly against Indian pace bowlers, have sparked debate about his defensive technique. Smith remains determined to find the optimal balance in his training and batting approach. He's analyzing the techniques of successful batsmen on challenging wickets.""In the last two years or so, while the wickets have been tricky, the guys getting runs are probably the ones going harder at the ball, almost keeping their bodies out of the way, giving themselves room in a way, and hitting hard and scoring quickly,"" Smith observed.He highlighted Travis Head and Mitch Marsh as examples of players who have adapted well to difficult batting conditions. He's seeking to incorporate elements of their approach into his own game.""For me, there's a balance. Obviously, you've got to try and put the bowler under some kind of pressure and try and dictate terms a little bit. But that can be tricky on those sorts of wickets as well."" Smith concluded.","Steve Smith is rethinking his training approach to combat a recent dip in form. He's adopted a ""less is more"" strategy, inspired by advice from former teammate Mike Hussey.

The West Indies completed a dominant 3-0 clean sweep over Bangladesh in their ODI series after a thrilling four-wicket victory in the final match in St. Kitts on Thursday. Debutant Amir Jangoo delivered a sensational performance, becoming only the second West Indian to score a century on ODI debut, finishing unbeaten on 104 off 83 balls.Chasing a daunting target of 322, the hosts found themselves in trouble early, losing three wickets within the first five overs. Sherfane Rutherford steadied the innings briefly with a knock of 30 before being dismissed by Taskin Ahmed. Jangoo then partnered with Keacy Carty in a game-changing 132-run stand.Carty fell agonizingly short of his second ODI century, dismissed for 95 after a sharp catch by Soumya Sarkar off Rishad Hossain. Jangoo, however, kept his composure and brought up his maiden ton with a towering six. Supported by Gudakesh Motie, who added an unbeaten 44, Jangoo guided the West Indies to victory with four overs to spare.Earlier, Bangladesh produced their best batting display of the series, amassing 321/5 in 50 overs. Soumya Sarkar (73) and Mehidy Hasan Miraz (77) laid a solid foundation, while a record unbroken sixth-wicket stand of 150 between Mahmudullah (84 not out) and Jaker Ali (62 not out) gave the visitors a competitive total.Despite their efforts, the bowlers struggled to contain the West Indies' chase. Jangoo's remarkable debut innings ensured the Caribbean side sealed their first ODI series whitewash over a Test-playing nation since their 3-0 win against Sri Lanka in 2021.The victory marked a memorable milestone for the West Indies, highlighting the team's potential and the emergence of fresh talent on the international stage.","West Indies complete 3-0 clean sweep over Bangladesh in ODI series.

As one of only two players to score a century in the league’s history, he is focused on driving the team’s success.""I think for us, it's about trying to qualify.

""I think it's about finding a way to be successful at home. We play a lot of games at Sharjah, and the scores are lower, so it's about making sure we find ways as a unit and for myself to play on the slower pitches, and to be able to post a score that's challenging,"" he explained.""I felt last year we went too hard trying to get scores that were too big instead of actually just getting a competitive score,” he further added.Kohler-Cadmore also praised local talents like Muhammad Jawadullah and Junaid Siddique, who have grown into pivotal bowlers for the team.""I think this is a great platform for them to stand up and show how good they are. We've been lucky to have Junaid and Jawadullah with us, they have become two of our frontline seamers over the last couple of seasons. It's been amazing watching Jawadullah grow, — we weren’t sure what we were going to get but when he came out for games, he absolutely starred for us, that is the beauty of these competitions, you always manage to find young talent and watch their careers grow,” he noted.Kohler-Cadmore expressed confidence and gratitude toward fans, saying, “Keep supporting us, and hopefully, we’ll bring the trophy home this year.”Sharjah Warriorz will kick off their campaign against the Gulf Giants on 12 January 2025.","Tom Kohler-Cadmore is one of only two players to score a century in the league’s history.

In fact, their performance has been the worst amongst the five franchises in WPL-they have lost 12 matches, and won just four in 16 outings.The WPL mini-auction will be held in Bengaluru on December 15.In November, Mithali took up the role of mentor of Women's Cricket Operations of Andhra Cricket Association.Also out of the Gautam Adani-owned franchise is former India off-spinner Nooshin Al Khadeer , who was the team's assistant coach for the first two seasons. Al Khadeer is currently the head coach of the India Under-19 women's team that will play in the second edition of the Under-19 World Cup to be held in Malaysia early next year, with India set to defend their title.On Thursday, Gujarat Giants announced that former Australian cricketer Daniel Marsh and ex-Mumbai and Rajasthan Royals leg-spinner Pravin Tambe, who made his debut for RR at the age of 41 in what is an inspirational story, had come on board as their batting and bowling coaches, while former South Australia batter Michael Klinger continues to remain their head coach.Tambe is still remembered for the hat-trick that he took for the Rajasthan Royals in their Indian Premier League clash against the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in IPL 2014. The tweaker had dismissed Manish Pandey, Yusuf Pathan and Ryan ten Doeschate to spark the Royals' 10-run win.

MUMBAI: A heartening feature of Mumbai's so far successful campaign in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy - they will play Baroda in the semifinals on Friday at 11am - has been the emergence of young turk Suryansh Shedge as a reliable finisher-a destructive power-hitter who can send the bowlers to the cleaners in the death overs.Twice in a row at SMAT now, Shedge, batting at No 6, has churned out blazing cameos which have helped Mumbai chase down 200-plus totals easily and seal a win from the jaws of defeat.In the must-win last league match against Andhra at Hyderabad, Mumbai, chasing a tall target of 230, were in a spot of bother when Shedge blasted an unbeaten 30 off just eight balls, in an effort which included three sixes and two fours to take Mumbai home in a record chase without much fuss.In the quarterfinals against Vidarbha at Alur on Wednesday, Mumbai again looked down and out at one point, before Shedge exploded with a power-packed 36 not out off merely 12 balls, this time hitting four sixes and a four. Thanks to the 21-year-old's hurricane, unbeaten 67-run partnership with experienced allrounder Shivam Dube, Mumbai romped home to a six-wicket win.In the four innings (he has played in all the seven matches for Mumbai) that he has batted in so far in SMAT, Shedge has rustled up an astounding strike rate of 247.22-never mind his average of 29.66 or overall runs tally (89).In the Ranji Trophy this season, Shedge provided proof of his unique ability when he smashed 99 off 93 balls against Assam at Guwahati, and then thumped 79 not out off just 36 balls, including six sixes, as Mumbai looked to declare in quick time against Odisha at the Mumbai Cricket Association's ground in BKC.Shedge first shot into limelight back in 2016 as a 13-year-old, when he smashed the fastest triple century in the history of the Giles Shield cricket tournament, scoring a blistering 326 off just 137 balls for the Gundecha Education Academy against SPSS Mumbadevi Niketan.A Bandra boy, Shedge owes his power-hitting skills to some useful training sessions in this regard with India's assistant coach Abhishek Nayar and Monty Desai , currently Nepal's head coach. ""Abhishek Nayar sir and Monty sir have helped me a lot when it comes to power hitting… giving me different drills to try and a good perspective on power hitting. They and Manish Bangera (childhood coach) are my important coaches and mentors,"" Shedge told TOI from Alur on Friday.Interestingly, the explosive allrounder develops his power-hitting by training in multiple grounds in Mumbai. ""I try to practice at different locations, and not just at one place. That helps a lot when you play in different conditions across Mumbai,"" he said.The young gun takes immense pride in wearing the Mumbai shirt. ""The MCA has backed me since a very young age. It gives me immense pride to play for the best team in India. In turn, I’ve built competitiveness and the hunger to win games. My team comes first, we play to win,"" he said with pride in his voice. Bought by the Punjab Kings at his base price of Rs 30 lakhs, Shedge, who was a part of Lucknow Super Giants could be the franchise's latest rising star if given proper opportunity.Showering praise on his ward, Monty Desai told TOI, ""Having known Suryansh since he was 11, I've witnessed his abilities, drive, and hunger evolve into a free-flowing batting style that is a joy to watch. But behind every young talent is the unwavering support of parents who endure the rollercoaster of emotions in their child's journey. While my participation is from a distance (National Duty), he still trains with Sportslife Coaches occasionally, and most of the time, we engage in meaningful conversations about his journey and setting a program and plan,"" Monty Desai told TOI from Kathmandu.""I have always felt he is a special talent who makes his presence felt on the ground. It is my privilege to keep guiding and mentoring him, encouraging him to stay connected to the deepest sense of his identity - grinding and staying grounded while showcasing his skills fearlessly, with flair and finesse. Yet, it's still a long way ahead - a journey of continuous learning and growth to build a true champion mindset,"" Desai felt.","Mumbai's Suryansh Shedge is a destructive power-hitter who can send the bowlers to the cleaners in the death overs.

'Rohit Sharma must return to opening if...': Ravi Shastri,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/rohit-sharma-must-return-to-opening-if-ravi-shastri/articleshow/116256117.cms,"IND vs AUS: Rohit Sharma has had a terrible time with the bat in whites

How can India still qualify for World Test Championship final?

Former Indian coach Ravi Shastri has offered his perspective on the ongoing India-Australia Test series. Shastri, who oversaw India's historic Test series wins in Australia in 2017-18 and 2020-21, believes Rohit Sharma should return to his opening position.Shastri was the team director during India's first-ever Test series victory in Australia and the head coach during their second triumph. He suggests that Rohit's optimal batting position is as an opener.India lost the second Test in Adelaide by 10 wickets. This defeat leveled the five-match series at 1-1. Shastri believes the third Test will be pivotal.""That's where he's (Rohit) been at his best over the last eight or nine years,"" Shastri was quoted as saying by 'The Age'.""It's not that he's going to set the world on fire – he could – but that's the place that's best for him...If he has to do damage, if he has to throw the first punch, that's the best place from where he can do it.""Prior to the second Test, Rohit had only one fifty in his last ten innings. Interestingly, Shastri had initially advised against changing the opening combination of Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul He also supported the idea of Rohit batting in the middle order at that time. Shastri now firmly believes that the winner of the third Test, commencing on Saturday, will likely win the series.""I feel whichever team wins this Test match will win the series. I have absolutely no doubt in my mind. So it is very, very important that India get the balance right, because Australia have got the confidence back.""Shastri highlighted the importance of India finding the right balance, especially considering Australia's regained confidence. He spoke at the first annual Usman Khawaja Foundation lunch at the Gabba.He reflected on India's 2021 series win, considering it one of the greatest achievements in Indian cricket history. He emphasized the team's unity amidst COVID-19 restrictions as a key factor in their success.""In COVID, the first Test match you start with five bowlers and the same five bowlers don't play the last Test. That says it all, it's like Australia playing without these five bowlers in the last Test of the series, it's a different ball game. Plus you didn't have quite a few batsmen as well. So it's a tribute to the players.""Shastri praised the players for their resilience and performance under challenging circumstances. He acknowledged the limitations of a coach's role and emphasized the players' contribution to the victory.""You can only do so much as a coach from behind the scenes. At the end of it, it's the players who have to go out there and do their job and they were magnificent.""India suffered a heavy defeat in Adelaide on the last tour, being bowled out for their lowest ever Test score of 36. However, they made a remarkable comeback to win the series. Shastri recalled a conversation between Rishabh Pant and Shubman Gill during the final Test at the Gabba.""I'll never forget it,"" Shastri said.""Last session, 140 runs to get. We had two different change rooms because of COVID. I went down from the coaches' room to have a chat with either Rishabh or (Chateshwar) Pujara. When I was about to reach the toilet, I heard a conversation between Gill and Pant.""Seventy-one overs bowled, Gill had got out for 91, and they were the two youngest players in the side, 21 and 22. 'Nine overs left, they need the new ball, they'll bring (Marnus) Labuschagne on with his leg spin, you've got to score 45-50 runs there'.""They are planning how they can reach closer to the end score, and no way was I going to stop them, I don't want to change that mindset. So I just walked past and said 'do what you have to do'. In the end, we chased down nearly 150 in that last session.""",India lost the second Test in Adelaide by 10 wickets.

'Follow Sachin Tendulkar's approach': Sunil Gavaskar's key tips to Virat Kohli,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/follow-sachin-tendulkars-approach-sunil-gavaskars-key-tips-to-virat-kohli/articleshow/116254181.cms,"(AP Photo)

Is India's batting now over dependent on Yashasvi Jaiswal?

This Virat Kohli is like Sachin Tendulkar of 2011-13

NEW DELHI: The legendary Sunil Gavaskar has come up with a piece of advice for struggling Virat Kohli , whose weakness against deliveries outside the off-stump continues to trouble him in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .Gavaskar advised Kohli to refrain from playing deliveries outside the off-stump until he settles in at the crease. He also highlighted that the opposition quickly identifies his approach and adjusts their field placements accordingly.""This approach should be that in the beginning, when you are not set, you should not go for a lunge until you are settled. Look, in the first innings, the shot played went over the top,"" Gavaskar told Star Sports.""Now, the Australian players must have noticed, when they came for the second innings, they placed a fielder there, so he needs to manage that. If he plays straight, he is good enough to hit between mid-on, mid-wicket, and straight if he just concentrates,"" he added.Gavaskar also urged Kohli to adopt Sachin Tendulkar 's approach, where he refrained from playing any shots outside the off-stump, a strategy that helped him score nearly 250 runs against Australia in Sydney.""Just like Sachin Tendulkar did in Sydney, in the previous three Test matches, he was getting out outside the off-stump, caught in the covers, or in the slips. He didn't play even one cover drive, only played straight and scored around two hundred and fifty runs by controlling himself and deciding not to play there. If he plays like this, just as Sachin scored a double century, Kohli can also do the same.""Gavaskar also feels Australia will have the momentum in the third Test against India starting on Saturday thanks to their victory in the Pink Ball Test at Adelaide last week.""The momentum that the Indian team got in Perth was lost during the 10-day gap. Now, the momentum is with Australia because they have won this Test match,"" Gavaskar said.""After the Adelaide Test, a few days later, you are playing at The Gabba. So, the momentum is now with the Australian team,"" he added.","Sunil Gavaskar says Virat Kohli should refrain from playing deliveries outside the off-stump until he settles in at the crease.

'No impact player rule' in SA20

Amid the influx of T20 leagues and the cramped calendar as a result, getting a clean window to rope in the best of talents is a challenge. Indian Premier League (IPL) with its big money is the biggest T20 league by a distance. It leaves the door ajar for the others to make a mark of their own. Australia's Big Bash League (BBL), Bangladesh Premier League (BPL), West Indies' Caribbean Premier League (CPL) and Pakistan Super League (PSL) are some of the most sought after.Slowly but gradually, South Africa's SA20 has also risen up the charts, with clear ambitions and backing of IPL franchises. Durban Super Giants, Joburg Super Kings, MI Cape Town, Paarl Royals, Pretoria Capitals and Sunrisers Eastern Cape all have support of IPL owners.The league, too, is not shying away from acknowledging that IPL is well and truly ahead of the rest but they hope to learn from its success. SA20 league commissioner and former cricketer Graeme Smith labelled the IPL as 'incredible'.SA20 Ambassador and former all-rounder Jacques Kallis said the reason the league has done well over the two editions is because the teams are evenly matched with quality players on display.""Obviously the product of the IPL is on the next level, your quality of players, your audience it's just streets ahead of anything else at the moment. We're trying to get the league (SA20) to as close as possible to IPL and make it a really exciting product, (something) that people want to watch. It's also key to have really strong teams. I think that's where they have done well, that is strength-versus-strength, and you got the best players coming over and attracting as many world class players as your overseas players as possible,"" he said in response to a query fromThe quality of the cricket and the spectacle was truly embraced by the locals as 3,80,000 people came through the turnstiles during the second season.""People want to see strength-versus-strength. They want to see the best players in South Africa and world class overseas players. And that's what this product has produced. And we've seen that people will come and watch it when the cricket's good. There's lots of other entertainment. So, it's good value. It's the format (that) allows you to bring the whole family to come and watch. So it's inclusive of all, which, you know, makes it a great and exciting product,"" he added.The league will have higher expectations of getting more viewers on the television screens as well with Dinesh Karthik to feature for Paarl Royals in the 2025 season. The now-retired batter will become the first Indian to play in SA20.""It's wonderful to have quality players coming especially from India. They haven't really been allowed to play the leagues around the world. So hopefully it's the start of many Indians coming over. People love watching India play cricket, and seen a lot of the players in the IPL, and to get to see them firsthand... I think the crowds are going to be really excited to see how his type of player comes across and does,"" stated the 49-year-old Kallis.SA20 has produced some exciting talents in the two years. MI Cape Towns' Ryan Rickelton and Dewald Brevis are two of the standout names. Rickelton scored 676 runs in 17 matches for MI Cape Town at an average of 42.25 and strike rate of 155.76. 21-year-old Brevis, meanwhile, has been brought into the international team after scoring 385 runs from 20 matches in the SA20 at a strike rate of 125.40.Another youngster to watch out for is 18-year-old left-arm seamer Kwena Maphaka . He was roped in the Paarl Royals for the second season and has been retained for the third. His talent has been noticed in India as well with Rajasthan Royals recruiting him for Rs 1.50 crore during the IPL 2025 Auction in November.""There is such a wonderful chance for these young guys to come through and show their skills, and if you can be successful in a league like this with such quality opposition and overseas players, it will certainly throw your name forward to playing international cricket,"" said Kallis on the opportunities at hand.Kallis, one of the most influential all-rounders of his time, isn't keen on seeing the Impact Player be introduced in SA20.“No, I don’t like the impact player rule because I think it takes away from the all-rounder. We’re trying to produce all-rounders in South Africa, and this rule diminishes that role. So no, I wouldn’t like to see it in SA20,” he said.","South Africa's T20 league has risen up the charts, with clear ambitions.

Stockholm: Swedish prosecutors on Thursday dropped a rape investigation that was launched in connection with football star Kylian Mbappé's visit to Stockholm in October.In a statement, lead investigator Marina Chirakova said there was not enough evidence to continue the investigation, which centered on an incident at a hotel.“During the course of the investigation, there has been a designated person suspected on reasonable grounds of rape and two cases of sexual assault, but my assessment is that the evidence is not sufficient to proceed and the investigation is therefore closed,"" Chirakova said. “The designated person has not been notified of suspicion of a crime.”Prosecutors never publicly named the suspect in the investigation, but many Swedish media reported it was Real Madrid striker Mbappe , who visited Stockholm in October during a break in the Spanish league.At the time Mbappe's legal team dismissed those reports as false.Mbappe's lawyer Marie-Alix Canu-Bernard and the player's representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comments on Thursday.In an interview that aired Sunday on French TV station, Mbappe said he was ""surprised"" by the reports that he was the subject of a rape investigation and he had not been contacted by Swedish authorities.“These are things that come into your life like that, you can’t see them coming,” Mbappe told. ""It's just incomprehension. I don’t think it weighed on me in the sense that I have never considered myself involved.”The 25-year-old football star appeared in Stockholm on October 10 during an international break instead of playing for France in the Nations League. Just days later Swedish media reported he was the subject of a rape investigation.At the time Swedish prosecutors confirmed that a rape investigation began but declined to comment further.","Swedish prosecutors dropped a rape investigation that was launched in connection with football star Kylian Mbappé's visit to Stockholm in October.

Before the season began, advancing to the next stage of the new format seemed inevitable for a side that had won the last four Premier League titles and was the 2023 European champion. However, that is no longer the case as City manager Pep Guardiola struggles with injuries and his players' seeming lack of faith.With goals from Dušan Vlahovic and Weston McKennie causing the most recent loss and igniting Juventus' hopes of qualifying, City has only won one of its last ten games across all competitions.Barcelona 's 3-2 victory over Borussia Dortmund propelled them into second position in the league rankings, behind Liverpool, and ensured their advancement. Ferran Torres and Raphinha each scored two goals for Barcelona.Bukayo Saka 's two goals helped Arsenal defeat Monaco 3-0, putting them in third position and ahead of six other clubs with 13 points.The clubs ranked No. 9-24 enter a two-leg playoff, while the top eight advance straight to the round of 16.The first of City's two remaining Champions League games comes against Paris Saint-Germain, another struggling powerhouse in 25th place, one point outside of the qualifying spots.With a powerful header aimed directly at City goalkeeper Ederson, who was only able to divert the ball over his own line, Vlahovic gave Juventus the lead in the 53rd minute. Juve won thanks to two American substitutes, including McKennie, who volleyed home from a cross from Timothy Weah.Juventus rose to 14th position.Last season's runner-up Dortmund was forced out of the top eight after Ferran Torres came off the bench to lead Barcelona to their fifth victory in six games.Robert Lewandowski, who had a quiet game against his old team, was replaced by Torres in the 71st minute. Torres scored on the rebound of Dani Olmo's shot just four minutes later.The score was tied at 2-2 after Serhou Guirassy's second goal of the match, but Torres scored again in the 85th minute after Lamine Yamal's counterattack.Barcelona took the lead thanks to Raphinha, and Guirassy equalized from the penalty spot. Lewandowski leads the league with seven goals, while Raphinha and Guirassy are tied for second place with six goals each.Saka scored goals in the 34th and 78th minutes and put in a shot that was converted into the net by substitute Kai Havertz in the 88th, giving Arsenal their third consecutive league-stage home victory without giving up.On goal differential, Arsenal leads Bayer Leverkusen, Aston Villa, Inter Milan, Brest, and Lille. On Wednesday, Lille defeated Sturm Graz 3-2 at home.AC Milan defeated Red Star Belgrade 2-1, with Tammy Abraham scoring the game-winning goal in the 87th minute to pull one point out of the top eight.

Other potential bids had withdrawn.A joint British and Irish bid was abandoned to focus on hosting Euro 2028. There were also unconfirmed suggestions of a joint bid from South Korea, China, Japan, and North Korea.Four South American countries initially launched a joint bid in 2019. They believed the centenary World Cup should be held entirely on the same continent as the first tournament.In late 2022, UEFA promoted a joint bid involving Spain, Portugal, and war-torn Ukraine. This was seen as a gesture of “solidarity” following the Russian invasion.Ukraine was subsequently removed from the candidacy. Morocco joined the Iberian nations, and South America agreed to host three symbolic matches in exchange.Following the “centenary celebrations” in the Southern Hemisphere winter, the participating teams and their fans will travel across the Atlantic for the remaining 101 matches.This extensive tournament will conclude with the final on July 21st. The venue for the final match is yet to be determined.Spain, which hosted the 1982 World Cup, is expected to play a central role, offering 11 of the proposed 20 stadiums.Morocco, having unsuccessfully bid five times previously, will become the second African nation to host the World Cup, following South Africa in 2010.Potential final venues include Madrid’s Santiago Bernabeu, Barcelona’s renovated Camp Nou, and the planned Hassan II stadium. The Hassan II stadium, located between Casablanca and Rabat, is projected to be the ""biggest stadium in the world"" with a capacity of 115,000.Portugal, which hosted Euro 2004, will contribute two stadiums in Lisbon and one in Porto, hoping to host a semi-final.Regarding the 2034 World Cup, FIFA invoked its continental rotation principle, welcoming bids only from Asia or Oceania. The 2026 World Cup, expanded to 48 teams, will be hosted across North America.FIFA gave potential bidders a short timeframe to submit candidacies, causing controversy. Australia and Indonesia quickly withdrew their interest.This left Saudi Arabia as the sole candidate. This paves the way for the World Cup to return to the Gulf region after Qatar hosted in 2022.Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been utilizing sport to enhance the nation's global image and influence.Securing the 2034 World Cup would be a significant achievement for Saudi Arabia. Currently, they possess only two stadiums with a capacity of 40,000, while 14 are required.Besides the logistical challenges, the extreme summer temperatures might necessitate rescheduling the tournament to later in the year, similar to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The timing of Ramadan in December 2034 presents an additional complication.The awarding of the World Cup to Saudi Arabia is expected to reignite discussions surrounding human rights, as seen with Qatar in 2022.Rights groups have raised concerns about mass executions, allegations of torture, restrictions on women under the male guardianship system, and limitations on free expression in Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia, currently hosting high-profile events like Formula One and the WTA Finals, faces accusations of ""sportswashing."" This involves using sport to deflect attention from its human rights record.","FIFA will announce the 2030 and 2034 World Cup hosts on Wednesday. A joint bid from Morocco, Spain, and Portugal is expected to secure the 2030 tournament, while Saudi Arabia is anticipated to host in 2034. The hosting rights will be determined through a vote during a virtual FIFA Congress. However, the outcomes seem predetermined as neither bid faces competition.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116178621,imgsize-32172,width-400,resizemode-4/116178621.jpg"
Novak Djokovic will run out of energy: Andre Agassi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/novak-djokovic-will-run-out-of-energy-andre-agassi/articleshow/116235405.cms,"American legend

Andre Agassi

believes Djokovic will miss Federer & Nadal, the guys he came to the dance with

Excerpts:

Carlos Alcaraz

and longevity…

American men haven't had results like the women:

Graf was the hardest victory I ever had: Agassi

BENGALURU: Andre Agassi wondered if the 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic would miss his greatest rivals -- the now-retired Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer -- in the last leg of a glittering career where the 37-year-old goes for more history.The eight-time Grand Slam champion, in the city for the TiE Global Summit, assessed Djokovic's run and the Serb's recent partnership with friend and rival Andy Murray in a candid chat with media.It's hard to say, Father Time always wins. He has already done so much for so long, it's hard to imagine longer. We said that about (Roger) Federer too. I think Novak will run out of energy more than capability. Cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left, that's a big thing.When Pete (Sampras) retired it was a blow to me, it set me back a little bit. It made me rediscover my inspirations on some level. Djokovic has lost the guys he made history with. It'll probably get tougher and tougher emotionally, but I would never bet against them. Bet against them at your peril.In any coach-student relationship you need trust and trust can take time, but it's nice when it starts with believing in somebody because you know that they know your experience. There's an asset to their history as competitors.Any success of a relationship is based on complete buy-in and that's always the part you have to wait and see. It's not what I know that changes your career, information doesn't lead to transformation, somebody has to counter that. That's the connector. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of trust immediately, we'll see how the results go.Alcaraz defends like Novak, has more power and spin like Nadal, hands and finesse like Federer but just because he has the best of all the three doesn't mean he can do what they did. There are so many parts to the game such as decision-making, injuries, luck. So how long can (Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner) do it (for)? They could do it for 20 years or not.The women's game hasn't had to deal with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, but they have their version of it. Serena Williams is the Novak of the women's game and you got Coco as a potential, like Alcaraz has potential and Sinner has potential.How the game evolves is interesting. The women's game has gotten very powerful, just straight power. For lack of a better example, Lindsay Davenport was powerful, tall, precise through the court and now you have a lot of that. There's still room for somebody who can offset that kind of power, like an Ash Barty.The men's game has changed in the sense that guys have gotten bigger with longer levers, which means they're better athletes, they can move and they need more time, they start playing further back. Soon you're going to start seeing the net game start coming back, everything morphs in its own way. But the biggest issue for American (men) not winning is an unfortunate set of decades where the guys were very stingy and very greedy -- 66 Grand Slams in the same generation. There's not a lot left there (for others)!Andre Agassi - the second of five men to achieve a career Grand Slam in the Open Era and the first man to complete a career golden slam - has won it all, including a stirring love match.""She was the hardest victory I ever had,"" said Agassi of his wife German tennis legend Steffi Graf, a 22-time major winner.Agassi, who has won eight major titles and the Olympic gold, speaking during a session at the TiE Global Summit, said, ""We all live a hero's journey - first part of life is about performing and achieving. Then life hits us with broken relationships and dreams. I went through it all. Finally, in the last phase of the journey, it's about serving others.""The 54-year-old said, ""At 28 my (tennis) career started over. Without the struggles, I would've never gotten Steffi to say yes. I tried to get her for years.""On a lighter note, Agassi said he likes to keep his trophies out of the house. ""I don't bring my trophies home, because if I bring my trophies home, then she brings her trophies home - and that's bad math!""",Andre Agassi believes Novak Djokovic will run out of energy more than capability. The eight-time Grand Slam champion is in the city for the TiE Global Summit. Agassi is the second of five men to achieve a career Grand Slam in the Open Era.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116235384,imgsize-29004,width-400,resizemode-4/116235384.jpg"
