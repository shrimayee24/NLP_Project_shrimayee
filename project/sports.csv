What is included in the presidential fitness test?

Donald Trump just made a big decision that will impact gym class for school going children in America. On Thursday, July 31, 2025, the US President signed an executive order to bring back the old Presidential Fitness Test in public schools. The test was stopped in 2012 when Barack Obama was President. But now, more than 10 years later, it’s making a comeback. Trump says it’s time for young Americans to get strong and healthy again but not everyone is clapping.Donald Trump signed the executive order on Thursday afternoon in Washington, D. C. It demands the reinstatement of the Presidential Fitness Test, a physical test students once completed in class yearly. The test was first started in 1956 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.Sit-ups, pull-ups, push-ups, a one-mile run, a shuttle run, and a sit-and-reach stretch were all included in the original version of the test. It was intended to assess youngsters' level of fitness. President Barack Obama, however, did away with the test in 2012 and substituted the ""Presidential Youth Fitness Program,"" which emphasized health more and fewer difficult challenges.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said,Trump was joined by famous athletes when he signed the order including Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker, pro golfer Bryson DeChambeau, former WWE star Paul “Triple H” Levesque, and former NFL player Lawrence Taylor.The timing of this order is important. The United States is getting ready to host the FIFA World Cup in 2026 and the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028.

Carter Hart and Hockey Canada Five NHL ban updates

Brian Lawton on Stan Bowman and Edmonton Oilers second chances





FAQs



Are the Edmonton Oilers interested in signing Carter Hart?

Why are Carter Hart and the Hockey Canada Five not allowed to play in the NHL?

Have the Edmonton Oilers given second chances to players before?

Carter Hart may not be getting a chance with the Edmonton Oilers. NHL insider Frank Seravalli said on July 28, 2025, that the team is not interested in signing the goalie. Hart and four other players were part of the Hockey Canada Five case. Although they were found not guilty in court, the NHL has said the five players cannot play for now. Seravalli called Hart a “non‑starter” for the Oilers and said the league will review the case before making a final decision.Justice Maria Sarroccia ruled last week in Ontario’s King’s Court that Carter Hart and four teammates were not guilty in the Hockey Canada Five case. The players had faced sexual assault charges from a 2018 incident in London, Ontario. The judge said the complainant, known as E.M., gave consent and that parts of her story were not credible.Despite the verdict, the NHL told teams the players remain ineligible to sign until the commissioner’s office finishes its review. Frank Seravalli discussed this on TSN in Toronto on July 28. On the same day, Bob Stauffer, who hosts the Oilers Now show in Edmonton, asked fans and guests if the Oilers should sign any of the cleared players.Stauffer has raised this question several times since the ruling.On July 29, Stauffer invited former NHL agent and GM Brian Lawton to the show. Lawton said, “Canada feels divided over this. Half think the players did something horrible, half think they were cleared and should move on with their lives.” He added that the players may find it easier to sign with a U.S. team where hockey is less in the public eye.Also Read: Edmonton Oilers Face Uncertainty As Connor McDavid Eyes Short-Term NHL Contract Extension At Potential Record Salary The Oilers have a history of second chances. Last summer, Edmonton hired Stan Bowman as GM even though he had served a three‑year NHL suspension for mishandling a sexual assault case in Chicago in 2010. The team also signed players like Craig MacTavish, Zack Kassian, Evander Kane and Corey Perry when they faced serious problems. Many of those players rebuilt their careers and image in Edmonton.Now, with Carter Hart and the other four players, fans are wondering if the Oilers are changing their approach. NHL sources say the team has no current plans to sign any of them.Now, with Carter Hart and the others cleared in court but still banned by the NHL, fans wonder if Edmonton will stick to its history of second chances or shift course entirely.No, NHL insider Frank Seravalli said the Oilers have no plans to sign Carter Hart right now.The NHL has kept them ineligible until the commissioner’s office finishes its review of the 2018 case.Yes, the Oilers have signed players like Stan Bowman, Evander Kane, and Corey Perry after past issues.","Edmonton Oilers have a history of giving second chances to players.

Eric Karlsson wants one thing in a trade: a real shot at winning the Stanley Cup

Penguins expected to move Eric Karlsson before start of 2025–26 NHL season



FAQs

1.bWhat does Erik Karlsson want in a trade?

2. Which teams are most likely to trade for Eric Karlsson?

3. Will Eric Karlsson be traded before the 2025–26 season starts?

As the Pittsburgh Penguins enter a pivotal offseason, veteran defenseman Erik Karlsson has become a central figure in trade discussions. The team, which has missed the Stanley Cup Playoffs for three consecutive years, is now shifting toward a rebuild, making big names like Karlsson, Rickard Rakell, and Bryan Rust available for potential trades.But one thing stands out in Karlsson’s case: he’s not willing to land just anywhere.According to NHL insider Frank Seravalli, Erik Karlsson has made it clear that he only wants to be traded to a contender. “Karlsson wants a chance to win,” Seravalli shared, emphasizing that any interested team will not only have to absorb Karlsson’s sizable contract but also meet his championship expectations.With this demand, the market for Karlsson becomes both exclusive and strategic. Only teams with both the cap flexibility and playoff-ready rosters need apply, making destinations like the Dallas Stars, Detroit Red Wings, and Carolina Hurricanes the most viable suitors. Each of these franchises has reportedly been exploring ways to reinforce their defensive core and make a serious Cup run.Karlsson’s contract, coupled with his desire to win, limits trade options but also clarifies the direction of talks.The Penguins, led by GM Kyle Dubas, are looking to refresh the roster and prepare for the future, meaning offloading Karlsson before the puck drops in the 2025–26 season is a top priority.The former Norris Trophy winner still has value, especially to a playoff-bound team in need of elite offensive skill from the blue line. Despite the obstacles, insiders believe a trade could realistically happen in the coming weeks, positioning Karlsson for one last serious Stanley Cup push.Also Read: NHL Rumors: Connor Bedard may get a powerful new linemate as Anton Frondell eyes opening night spot with Blackhawks He only wants to be traded to a Stanley Cup contender.Detroit, Dallas, and Carolina have been named as top possibilities.All signs point to the Penguins moving him before the 2025–26 campaign begins.","Penguins expected to move Eric Karlsson before start of 2025–26 NHL season.

FAQs

What is Sophie Cunningham’s podcast called?

How does Sophie Cunningham know West Wilson?

Is Sophie Cunningham serious about skipping games for Bravo?

The Indiana Fever guard, Sophie Cunningham, recently revealed that her Bravo obsession is so intense that she’s willing to bend the rules, at least jokingly, for a chance to party with the Summer House crew.While promoting her new podcast Show Me Something with Summer House star West Wilson, Cunningham opened up about her Bravo fandom and the temptation to join the summer party circuit despite WNBA commitments.Sophie Cunningham openly admitted that she would go to the extent of “faking illness” for her WNBA game to have a gateway with the Summer House cast. The Indiana Fever front office should take note that if Cunningham called in sick, she could be perfectly alright, just having the moment of her life. In a PEOPLE exclusive, the Fever star candidly joked about ditching a WNBA game while expressing her love for Summer House.“I haven't been [to the house] because it's during our season,” she said of the Hamptons mansion where the show is filmed. “Though, we have said this so many times — I think I'm gonna, like, fake being sick or something and just show up there.”Cunningham’s comment wasn’t just a passing joke. She has a long-standing friendship with Wilson, whom she’s known since childhood.The two grew up together in Columbia, Missouri, and have maintained a playful bond ever since. That chemistry now fuels their podcast, which promises to blend sports commentary with pop culture chaos.“ We're definitely going to hit on the WNBA, a huge topic in sports right now, and then Bravo, clearly, but pop culture, food, fashion, travel—we really do talk about anything,” Cunningham said of the podcast’s scope.Their crossover connection is no accident. Wilson, who has supported Cunningham at several games and refers to her as a WNBA ""fan favorite,"" recalls her fearless energy even in high school. As for a standout moment, he shared the time she stepped in as a football kicker on the night of their homecoming dance. “It was homecoming so all these girls were dressed up so cute and pretty… and then I was like, in football pads with my poor date in a tuxedo,” Cunningham said with a laugh.Although she now plays in Indiana, Cunningham’s influence is felt throughout the WNBA—and apparently, in the Bravo universe too. She admits to turning many of her Fever teammates into Summer House fans. “I’ve been addicted, and I have my teammates on it. I have everyone watching it because of West,” she shared.While Wilson jokingly worried about the locker room becoming his focus group, “That part makes me nervous, that the team’s watching,” Cunningham seemed cool with it. The duo’s banter, laced with humor and honesty, sets the tone for their podcast. “We’re lighthearted, and sometimes our love language is, like, s--- talking,” she said. “It’ll be cool that people can see our humor… and it’s coming from us.”The podcast has created anticipation among fans, but again, if Cunningham is absent from the WNBA, it’s worth checking up with the Summer House cast.Also Read: ""You are dumb as f*ck""- Sophie Cunningham uncovers ugly truth behind Caitlin Clark's rough welcome in WNBA It’s called Show Me Something, co-hosted with Summer House star West Wilson.They’ve been friends since childhood, growing up together in Columbia, Missouri.She was joking, but her love for Summer House is clearly very real.","Sophie Cunningham is co-hosting a new podcast with Summer House star West Wilson.

Bulls Get Giddey and Claxton

Nets Add Frontcourt Depth and a Pick

In the midst of a turbulent NBA restricted free agency market, a three-team trade proposal has surfaced that would sendforwardto the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for Brooklyn’s explosive guard Cam Thomas. The deal, while hypothetical, reflects the growing uncertainty around restricted free agents and the Warriors’ roster direction.Aimed at resolving the futures of several young talents, the trade proposal brings together the Warriors, Nets, and Bulls:Cam Thomas, a 6-foot-3 guard, has carved out a reputation as a microwave scorer. Averaging 24 points per game last season for the Nets, Thomas showcased his ability to create offense at will, regardless of the defender in front of him. His offensive output has drawn comparisons to some of the league’s best bench scorers.However, concerns remain. His defensive limitations and lack of positional versatility could pose challenges in Golden State ’s system. As Jeremy Kruger notes in The Sporting News, “Thomas is a hard player to analyze… he also leaves a lot to be desired on defense.” Still, for a Warriors team possibly losing Kuminga, adding a prolific scorer off the bench could be a step toward bolstering their second unit.The trade buzz comes at a time when Jonathan Kuminga ’s future with the Warriors appears cloudy. Reports suggest that Kuminga is uninterested in returning to Golden State, favoring a move to the Phoenix Suns or Sacramento Kings instead. While the Warriors have publicly leaned toward retaining the 21-year-old forward, external speculation and trade proposals continue to gain traction.Kuminga has shown flashes of star potential, particularly with his athleticism and defensive upside. But inconsistent development and questions about his fit in Golden State’s system have fueled speculation that he could be on the move.The Bulls, often linked with trade discussions this offseason, would walk away with two young, controllable talents: center Nic Claxton and guard Josh Giddey, the latter re-signing on a four-year, $98 million deal. Claxton adds interior defense and rebounding, while Giddey provides backcourt playmaking and size.Brooklyn would receive Kuminga - adding more youth and athleticism to their core - along with veteran big man Nikola Vučević and a top-5 protected first-round pick in 2028. This move could help the Nets pivot toward a younger, more dynamic future.This proposed three-team trade checks multiple boxes: it provides a new home for discontented restricted free agents, balances rosters with complementary talent, and offers long-term cap clarity. For the Warriors, trading Kuminga for Cam Thomas would mark a shift toward offensive firepower over potential and defense.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors Urged to Pursue $83,081,018 Sacramento Kings Star Duo to Bolster Squad; Jonathan Kuminga Prime Trade Asset Still, whether Golden State would truly entertain this move depends on how much faith they have in Kuminga’s long-term development—and how much risk they’re willing to take on a scorer like Thomas.","A three-team trade proposal has surfaced that would send Golden State Warriors forward Jonathan Kuminga to the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for Cam Thomas.

Why did the video of Ayesha Curry go viral?

Did Ayesha say anything rude to the fan?

What was Stephen Curry doing in the video?

A peaceful day on the golf course turned into unexpected internet buzz for Stephen Curry and his wife, Ayesha Curry . In a now-viral video, the Golden State Warriors star paused a casual round of golf to sign a young fan’s jersey. It was certainly an act of kindness that didn’t go unnoticed. But it wasn’t just Steph’s generosity that drew attention. All eyes quickly shifted to Ayesha, whose reaction sparked a wave of online chatter.In the short clip, Stephen Curry is seen stopping his golf cart to greet a young fan and the kid’s mother. He graciously signs the kid’s Warriors jersey and a card, smiling warmly throughout the interaction. Fans praised the gesture, calling it “vintage Curry” and a “class act.”But Ayesha, seated next to him, wasn’t quite in the same headspace. She remained on her phone, glanced at the fan without much reaction, and offered a look that some online described as “annoyed” or “unimpressed.” While she didn’t say anything overtly negative. While Ayesha responded back with a “hi” after the kid’s mother greeted her, her reaction was not something that fans expected.Many fans were less forgiving, accusing her of being cold or dismissive during what should have been a feel-good moment.However, not everyone was critical; many came to Ayesha’s defense, suggesting she was simply hoping for a quiet day with her husband, away from the constant interruptions that come with fame.While Stephen Curry is universally celebrated for his down-to-earth vibe, it’s easy to forget the toll constant public attention can take, especially on his family.

India vs England 5th Test Preview: Can Shubman Gill's India level the series at The Oval?

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

TimesofIndia.com in London: Overcast sky, green pitch, rain interruptions, enough for the bowlers all day, and hard work for the batters. Day 1 of the fifth England-India Test at The Oval had a very English look and feel to it. Even after 20 days of hard-fought cricket, that feeling was missing, and the opening day in London gave plenty of it. The beer taps continued to flow in the stands, but for a change, thanks to the weather, even the espresso machines had some decent queues when play got underway.The spectators had plenty of options to enjoy their cricket, but for the ones in the middle, patience was going to be their only companion. From the time Ollie Pope asked India to bat in those challenging conditions, it was clear that this was going to be the sternest examination of the batters in the series so far. This was the spiciest pitch of the tour, and it lived up to its billing with the assistance it provided to the quicks.There was activity in the air, movement off the pitch, and the odd one kicked off the surface. 204/6 has left the day slightly in England's favour, with Karun Nair and Washington Sundar being the last recognised pair, but it could have been much worse had the bowlers used the conditions better.Apart from Gus Atkinson, the others lacked consistent control, and there were looseners which allowed a release shot here and there.It wasn't easy to deal with the moving Dukes, and rain interruptions only made life more difficult for the batters. Two, read KL Rahul and Dhruv Jurel, were guilty of throwing it away, one, read Shubman Gill, misjudged a run, and the remaining three got out to very good deliveries. Those three good deliveries were always going to come their way in these conditions, but it was the previous bunch of three which could have been avoided.England did release the steam when Karun Nair did the repair job, first with Dhruv Jurel and then with Sundar, but it could have been a much worse day for the hosts had those three dismissals not happened. India assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate summed up the day as ""fair"" and felt if they can stretch to 300, it will be a job well done by the batters. He lauded Sai Sudharsan for his patient knock before getting dismissed by a Josh Tongue peach!""It’s a fair day. If we can push to 300, it will be a great score. Guys by and large did very well today. Sai Sudharsan played very nicely… two very good balls by Tongue,"" said ten Doeschate during the media interaction.The coach felt Gill’s run-out was a misjudgment from the skipper.""He is in the touch of his life; he made batting look easy today. England bowled very nicely today, and we spoke about accumulating runs during the break. Guys did a nice job accumulating runs, but it was a misjudgment of the run,"" added ten Doeschate.It was a bizarre day of play that had everything: a bowler sprayed all over but bowled two unplayable deliveries; a player who was not sure of playing in this game scored a fighting unbeaten fifty; and a series that was played on very batting-friendly surfaces dished out the spiciest track—for the game in which both Jasprit Bumrah and Jofra Archer didn't feature in the Playing XI.When Nair and Sundar come out to bat on the second day, they will be carrying the familiar feeling of not feeling set, no matter what score you are batting on. English conditions for you!","England are 204-6 at stumps on the first day of the fifth Test at The Oval. Karun Nair and Washington Sundar are the last recognised pair.

India vs England 5th Test Preview: Can Shubman Gill's India level the series at The Oval?

Poll Should umpires refrain from signaling during appeals in cricket? Yes, it creates confusion. No, it's part of the game.

Watch Dharmasena's signal here:

NEW DELHI: Former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar has criticised umpire Kumar Dharmasena for his unusual on-field gesture during the first day of the fifth and final Test between India and England at The Oval. The Sri Lankan umpire appeared to signal an inside edge to England’s players mid-appeal, a moment that has sparked debate across the cricketing world.The incident occurred in the 13th over of India’s first innings. England’s Josh Tongue fired in a sharp inswinging yorker that struck Sai Sudharsan on the pad. England’s players launched a loud LBW appeal, only for Dharmasena to shake his head and then gesture with his fingers, seemingly to indicate an inside edge. Replays confirmed that Sudharsan did, indeed, get a faint nick, but the mid-appeal gesture raised eyebrows.On Star Sports commentary, Bangar didn't hold back: ""These habits do not go away because it is second nature that whenever there is an appeal, you try to say it. When Dharmasena started umpiring, there was no DRS, but now you don't have to give any signal as to what's in your mind. That little hint gives the bowling team insight into what the umpire is thinking.

Poll Do you think Chahal's emotional response to his divorce is justified? Yes, emotions are valid No, he should be stronger It depends on the situation

Cricketer Yuzvendra Chahal has finally addressed the story behind his viral “be your own sugar daddy” T-shirt, worn during his divorce from social media influencer and choreographer Dhanashree Verma.In a candid appearance on Raj Shamani’s podcast, Chahal spoke openly about the emotional toll the separation took on him and the quiet strength it required to maintain composure publicly.“I didn’t want to create drama, I just wanted to send a message, and I did,” Chahal said, referring to the now-notorious T-shirt that sparked speculation online.Chahal and Dhanashree were granted a mutual divorce by the Bandra Family Court on March 20 earlier this year.When asked why he felt the need to send that message at all, the Indian leg-spinner revealed that something triggered him emotionally.“Because something had happened from the other side. Initially, I wasn’t planning to do anything, but when that happened, I thought, to hell with everything, I don’t care about anyone anymore. So I wore it. I didn’t abuse anyone, didn’t say anything; I just wanted to give that message,” he said.Chahal also shared that the divorce was not a sudden event but rather a gradual and private decision.“It was going on for a long while,” he said. “We decided we do not want to show the people... until we reach the point of the end, we are not going to say anything. Yes, I was faking it.”He pointed to career pressures and differing goals as major reasons for the rift.“A relationship is like a compromise. Two ambitious people can stay together, but everyone has their own lives, their own goals.”Addressing online rumours, Chahal said, “People labelled me as a cheater. I have never cheated. You won’t get a more loyal person than me… I know how to respect women.”",Chahal and Dhanashree Verma were granted a mutual divorce by the Bandra Family Court on March 20 earlier this year.

Poll Should players prioritize national duty over franchise leagues like IPL? Yes, national duty should come first No, players should choose what's best for their careers

As rain interrupted proceedings on Day 1 of the fifth and final Test between India and England, a strong message came from ECB chair Richard Thompson. The official lauded the commitment of England players, highlighting batter Harry Brook ’s decision to pull out of IPL 2025 despite the financial cost.Brook had been bought by Delhi Capitals for ₹6.2 crore in the IPL mega auction, but the 26-year-old withdrew just days before the start of the tournament to prioritise playing for England. That decision has led to a two-season IPL auction ban for the right-hander.“Look at Harry Brook, who we hadn't even had a conversation with about taking on the white ball captaincy, and he knows by not playing in this year's IPL he is then banned for the next two years,” said Thompson. “That decision cost him several million dollars, and it wasn't even a thought that he wouldn't do that.”Thompson reflected on a broader question being asked across the cricketing world: “Is this when players start to prioritise franchise cricket over playing for their country?” The current predicament can also be seen in the way certain teams have seen players retire early from the National team setups to focus on franchise cricket and other T20 leagues.But in his view, the answer from within the England setup is clear. “It could not be further from the reality of the dressing room that Baz (Brendon McCullum) has created there with Rob (Key) and a brilliant captain in Ben (Stokes). It has transformed the sense of everyone wanting to be part of that dressing room,” Thompson said.“And as part of that decision to make Baz both white-ball coach as well as red-ball coach, he has created that golden thread. So the desire for any English cricketer to play for England, I don't think has ever been greater.”Under head coach Brendon McCullum and captain Ben Stokes, England have looked united and competitive, even as they battle a spirited Indian side in the ongoing series.As tensions flared and arguments broke out between the two sides, the hosts have looked like a solid unit, standing their ground and backing their players over the four Tests that have concluded.",England face India in the fifth and final Test at The Oval.

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

Poll Do you think Yashasvi Jaiswal can bounce back from his recent poor form? Yes, he has the talent. No, he's struggling too much.

Former India batter Sunil Gavaskar has raised serious concerns over Yashasvi Jaiswal ’s technique following his poor dismissal on Day 1 of the fifth Test at The Oval.The young opener, who began the series on a high with a century, continued his slump in form as he was trapped lbw for just 2 by Gus Atkinson, exposing a now-familiar vulnerability to deliveries angling in from around the wicket.Speaking on Sony Sports, Gavaskar pointed to technical flaws that have crept into Jaiswal’s game.“There’s a bit of uncertainty and maybe a lack of confidence creeping into Jaiswal's game. After scoring a hundred in the first Test, he hasn’t looked very fluent,” Gavaskar said.He added that the issue lies in the batter’s footwork and shoulder positioning, something that’s increasingly impacting his ability to counter the inswingers.“That’s possibly why he's not getting his front foot far enough forward to smother this return. But he's a good player. I think if someone sits with him and works on a few technical aspects, like getting his front foot forward and not opening up his shoulder too much, it could help.”Breaking it down further, Gavaskar explained, “Right now, his back shoulder is going towards first or second slip, which makes it hard for the bat to come down straight.If his shoulder stayed more towards the wicketkeeper and first slip, the bat would come down straighter.”Jaiswal’s early exit left India under pressure after being asked to bat first by England. At stumps on a rain-interrupted day, India were 204 for 6 in 64 overs, with Karun Nair unbeaten on 52 and Washington Sundar on 19.India’s top order struggled throughout the day. KL Rahul was bowled by Chris Woakes for 14, while Shubman Gill was run out for 21. India will need a strong lower-order fightback to post a competitive total in the final Test.","Yashasvi Jaiswal was out for 2 on Day 1 of the fifth Test at The Oval.

By acknowledging both her pride and her fear, she’s showing that it’s okay for parents to feel uncertain, too.

Would Noah Fant become the missing piece of the Bengals’ puzzle? Only time will tell. For now, it’s his contract that’s on top of the discussion shelf.ESPN Senior NFL Insider, Adam Schefter, took to his X to inform the cyberspace that the Bengals are giving former Seahawks and Broncos TE Noah Fant a one-year deal. They have also released TE Kole Taylor. An X user commented, “Bengals adding another piece to Burrow’s arsenal.” Another said, “Good target for Burrow. Solid pick up.” A third fan chimed in, “The man wants to win. Cincy makes sense.”Bengals HC Zac Taylor is all-praise, no-complaint for the newly signed tight end, Noah Fant. The coach called Fant a great, explosive player and a weapon in the tight end room. Taylor told Russ Heltman of Sports Illustrated, “You’ve got a player that’s really plus in both the run and the pass, and so at the point of attack, blocking, backside of blocking, and protection can help you.But also really explosive as a receiver, great size, great explosiveness, really good hands, tough to bring down.

Known for his dazzling edge work, slick hands, and patient playmaking, Barzal has often been criticized for not firing the puck more.Barzal, ever the technician on the ice, explained that hockey isn’t a video game. Decision-making happens in milliseconds, not minutes. “People think it’s just skate and rip,” he hinted, “but the angles, the pressure, and the goalie in front of you make it a chess match, not checkers.”Islanders fans have long clamored for their star center to shoot more, and with good reason. When Barzal does fire the puck, good things tend to happen. But from his perspective, passing often opens up better scoring lanes, especially in a league where goaltenders like Andrei Vasilevskiy cover nearly every inch of the net.Looking ahead, Islanders fans can expect a more assertive version of Barzal. With the franchise in need of scoring depth and leadership, the 27-year-old playmaker may be entering a new chapter in his career one that features a few more goals and, perhaps, a few fewer “shoot!” chants echoing from the stands.He prioritizes playmaking and believes passing.

Patrick Mahomes is a great quarterback, but even a greater dad to his three toddlers, Sterling Skye Mahomes, Patrick ""Bronze"" Lavon Mahomes III, and Golden Raye Mahomes. The Kansas City Chiefs' crown jewel isn't only living his fatherhood, he's relishing every bit of it alongside his wife, Brittany. Back in January, right after the couple welcomed Golden, their youngest one to this world, the athlete said it's a lot of fun to be a dad of three. It is indeed, and Brittany managed to make it even funnier by bringing the kids to meet their dad in the field this Wednesday.The multiple Super Bowl Champion is looking to add more and more stacks to his already illuminated career, heading to his ninth year with the Chiefs. Last season, the veteran racked up a total of 392 passes out of 581 attempts for 3,928 yards, 26 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. No, it was neither the classic Mahmoes' score nor one of his best marks in the field. He had fewer touchdowns and more interceptions than usual, but at the end of the day, it's still Mahomes who stands tall in the top 2025 QB rankings, holding the rank 1 among all the talented rising QBs. He doesn't lace up his shoes with a chip on his shoulder, but he will definitely look to be back to his lofty standard, at least.However, while fixing his eyes on the goal, Mahmoes got an extra boost to his mood seeing his adorable kids there in the field during the first week of the training.It was not a typical 'bring your kids to work day' for the Chiefs.

A rookie carrying Tennessee’s 2025 defensive hopes

The Tennessee Titans stunned the NFL when they released veteran linebacker Harold Landry III in March. Landry had just led the team with nine sacks in 2024, making his exit a surprise for fans. The move marked a defensive reset, with the franchise turning to the 2025 NFL Draft for a new pass-rushing anchor.Tennessee addressed its defensive need in the second round by drafting Oluwafemi Oladejo, a versatile edge rusher built to energize a stagnant pass rush. While officially an edge rusher, Oladejo offers more than just quarterback pressure. The Titans plan to deploy him in a hybrid role, capable of attacking off the edge and dropping into coverage when needed.The Titans recorded just 32 sacks last season, tied for the third-fewest in the NFL. This lack of pressure allowed opposing quarterbacks too much comfort, costing Tennessee key games. ESPN’s Turron Davenport reported that the team sees Oladejo as a key piece in reviving a struggling pass rush.Determined to make an immediate impact, Oladejo has been studying elite edge rushers like T.J. Watt, Maxx Crosby, and Micah Parsons.His path mirrors Parsons, who successfully transitioned from middle linebacker to dominant edge rusher in the NFL. Oladejo followed a similar journey, starting as a middle linebacker at California and UCLA before moving to defensive end late in college.“The biggest thing playing on the edge is your get-off,” Oladejo said. “If you have a good get-off and play with your hands, it can make up for anything.” His dedication to fundamentals and technique could be exactly what the Titans need to turn their pass rush around.The Titans released Harold Landry III in March 2025 despite his nine-sack season to reset their defense and create room for younger pass rushers like Oluwafemi Oladejo.Oluwafemi Oladejo is a rookie edge rusher drafted in the second round of the 2025 NFL Draft.

India vs England weather, rain forecast: Why bad news for India from The Oval

In a remarkable display of sportsmanship on Day 1 of the 5th Test between India and England at The Oval, Indian batter Karun Nair chose not to take a fourth run after England's Chris Woakes injured his shoulder while attempting to save a boundary. This gesture earned widespread praise on social media for exemplifying the true spirit of cricket.The incident occurred when Woakes, while fielding at mid-off, chased a ball toward the boundary. The damp outfield caused him to slip and land awkwardly on his left shoulder. He needed immediate medical attention and left the field using his sweater as a makeshift sling.Nair, who had already completed three runs with his partner Washington Sundar, had the opportunity to take a fourth run. However, he signalled to Sundar not to run, showing respect for the injured opponent.The injury appears serious for Woakes, who has been the only constant in England's pace attack throughout the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy series. His teammate Gus Atkinson shared his concerns with BBC Sport, saying, ""It doesn't look great. I will be surprised if he takes any part in the game.""Atkinson, who recently returned from a hamstring strain, expressed his readiness to step up if needed. ""It's the last game of the series and when anyone gets injured it's a shame. We're hoping it's not too bad. Whatever it is, he will get full support from everyone,"" he added.The injury marks a disappointing end to Woakes' series campaign, where he has struggled with his bowling performance. He has managed to take just 11 wickets at an average of 52.18, with his best figures being 3/84.","Karun Nair chose not to take a fourth run after England's Chris Woakes injured his shoulder.

Jasprit Bumrah’s tour of England has finished with him playing three out of the fives Tests as per the initial plan. The team management and selectors made peace with the arrangement when they picked the star pacer for the tour more than two months ago.It has now emerged that the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) may be revisiting its policy regarding Bumrah.The Indian team management, despite it being publicly known at the start of the tour that Bumrah would be available to play just three Tests, didn’t confirm his unavailability till the eve of the final Test at the Oval.Sourcesthat it was becoming challenging to plan for a long series without knowing which games Bumrah would play — or not play — due to his workload concerns.This is why there is an inclination to tweak the policy and consider Bumrah for selection only if he is available for an entire series. It has also been highlighted that the medical team should provide Bumrah’s fitness report before each selection meeting.“Strength and condition (S&C) coaches can set the workload threshold for each player. But Bumrah’s availability should depend on his fitness, which will be assessed by the medical team,” a BCCI source said.India don’t play another five-Test series for a couple of years now. They only have two-Test home series against West Indies and South Africa this year.Two days before the Oval Test, India’s batting coach Sitanshu Kotak explained how workload is measured. “It is about a bowler putting in a certain number of overs per week. If he’s preparing for a T20 and putting in six overs for five days, that is good enough workload for T20. So, for preparing for the Test series when they were playing IPL, the bowling coach and the S&C team were all in contact with them,” he said.“In the build-up over the last four-five weeks, there should not be any spike. If a bowler is putting in 30 overs per week, and suddenly, in the first inning, he's put in 35 overs, then that’s the spike in his load. It also depends on whether the bowler himself feels I’m tired. Then, they will think about the load,” he added.When Bumrah went for the Australia tour last winter, his workload was around 45-50 overs a Test. However, he didn’t break down in the fifth and final Test in Sydney because he bowled around 52 overs in the previous Test in Melbourne. It was because he put more load in a single session.When Kotak was asked about the probability of Bumrah playing at the Oval, he said: “He has bowled in one inning in the last match. The head coach, our physio and captain will have a discussion and decide.”Bumrah had bowled 33 overs in Manchester spread across three days. On the eve of the match, Gill insisted that they would take a call on Bumrah on the morning of the Test since the pitch looked very green.When England captain Ben Stokes put in a superhuman effort of bowling two 10-over spells on the last day of the third Test at Lord’s, comparisons with Bumrah’s conservative workload started doing the rounds. The Indian team management started leaning towards Bumrah for the fourth Test in Manchester after Akash Deep and Arshdeep Singh suffered injuries during the break between the two Tests.However, it turned out Stokes was pushing his limits in Manchester. He subsequently broke down and was forced to miss the final Test here. Bumrah and the Indian team management, maybe, learnt their lesson.",India bowler Jasprit Bumrah played three out of the fives Tests as per the initial plan.

Netflix Quietly Regrets Meghan Markle’s $100M Deal





Natasha Archer has been by the Princess of Wales’s side since 2010. She selected outfits for overseas tours, was even on hand at the hospital for royal baby photo calls, ready with spare outfits and supplies and was promoted to Senior Private Executive Assistant in 2022. Last week Kensington Palace confirmed Archer, now 37, is leaving to start a private “luxury consultancy.”Soon after the news broke, Archer switched her long-private Instagram profile to public. Royal watchers noticed two quick moves. She stopped following Meghan Markle , the Duchess’s lifestyle label As Ever, and several friends in Meghan’s circle, including makeup artist Daniel Martin and polo player Delfina Blaquier.The timing set off fresh speculation because the royal family is quietly trying to ease tensions with the Sussexes. Palace sources say aides for King Charles and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex held an informal meeting in London this month to explore next steps toward better relations. Prince William’s team did not attend, leaving doubts about how far any thaw can go.Commentators see Archer’s “unfollow” spree as a public hint that fences remain unmended. The Blast, citing insider chatter, called the move a “controversial stunt” that risks undercutting reconciliation plans said to be backed by Princess Kate herself.People who have worked with Archer stress her loyalty to the Wales household. She received the Royal Victorian Order in 2019 for personal service and is married to royal photographer Chris Jackson. Friends say her new consultancy will advise private clients on travel logistics and event styling, skills honed during fifteen years on royal duty.Neither Kensington Palace nor the Sussex office has commented on the social-media changes. Online, opinions split quickly. Some see the unfollows as a harmless reset before Archer’s career move. Others view them as a subtle show of support for Kate during a sensitive phase in family diplomacy.What happens next will likely unfold off camera. Kate is said to be focused on her children’s summer break and on a fuller return to public engagements later in the year. Meghan remains in California, preparing for new launches under her As Ever brand. Behind the scenes, advisers on both sides are expected to keep talking, while Archer steps into private life with new clients and fewer royal handles in her feed.For royal watchers, the small click of an unfollow button has added one more twist to a story that shows no sign of fading from the spotlight.","Natasha Archer has been by the Princess of Wales’s side since 2010.

LONDON: A rare Gandhi portrait, believed to be the only oil painting Mahatma Gandhi ever sat for, sold in an online auction at Bonhams on Tuesday for £152,800 (Rs 1.7 crore.)“Portrait of Mahatma Gandhi” by British artist Clare Leighton sold for triple its estimate of £50,000-£70,000 (Rs 57 lakh to Rs 80 lakh). It was the top lot in the Travel and Exploration online sale and the first time this portrait has been sold at auction.According to the artist’s family, the portrait was on public display in 1974 when it was allegedly attacked with a knife by a Hindu right-wing activist. The catalogue entry refers to signs of restoration to tears in several places.Leighton met Gandhi when he visited London in 1931 to attend the Second Round Table Conference.At the time, Leighton was in a relationship with political journalist Henry Noel Brailsford, who was a passionate supporter of Indian Independence. It was through this connection that she was introduced to Gandhi and was one of the few artists admitted to Gandhi’s office to sit with him to sketch and paint him.In November 1931, Leighton showcased her portraits in an exhibition at the Albany Galleries in London.Journalist Winifred Holtby attended the opening and wrote: “The little man squats bare-headed, in his blanket, one finger raised, as it often is to emphasise a point, his lips parted for a word that is almost a smile… the statesman who knows just how to play on the psychology of friends and enemies alike.”","“Portrait of Mahatma Gandhi’ by British artist Clare Leighton sold for triple its estimate of £50,000-£70,000 (Rs 57 lakh to Rs 80 lakh) It was the top lot in the Travel and Exploration online sale and the first time this portrait has been sold at auction.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122542027,imgsize-22548,width-400,resizemode-4/122542027.jpg"

Indian cricketer Yuzvendra Chahal has addressed the swirling rumours about his personal life, particularly those linking him to RJ Mahvash following his divorce from Dhanashree Verma.In a candid chat on Raj Shamani’s podcast, the cricketer spoke about heartbreak, healing, and how public speculation made things worse for everyone involved.Chahal firmly dismissed the dating buzz. “No, there’s nothing. People can think whatever they want to think,” he said, clarifying that he isn’t seeing anyone.On whether he’s open to love again, he admitted, “It will take time to process. I need to gather myself. I’m not afraid to fall in love again, but I’m scared of losing the person because I get attached with all my heart.”Rumours linking him to Mahvash intensified after they were spotted together during a Champions Trophy game, but Chahal said things were taken out of context.“We had a Christmas dinner with five people, but the photo was cropped to make it look like just the two of us were on a dinner date,” added Chahal.He also recalled a video recorded while she dropped him to the airport: “I was just fixing my hair, and people started saying all sorts of cheap things...That really hurt me.”Mahvash, he said, stood by him during a dark period, but the trolling got intense. “Even she clarified it, but it was very hard for her. She was called a homewrecker… people said really nasty things.”He even joked about online speculation: ""I saw on Twitter (now 'X') that Yuzi Chahal is getting married on 31st June. And people actually believed it in the comments; I was just watching it all unfold.""Chahal also spoke about wearing the viral “Be Your Own Sugar Daddy” tee.“I didn’t abuse anyone, didn’t say anything; I just wanted to give that message,” he said.","Indian cricketer Yuzvendra Chahal has addressed the swirling rumours about his personal life, particularly those linking him to RJ Mahvash.

TimesofIndia.com in London: Gus Atkinson made an immediate impact on his return to the England XI but admitted the team was concerned about Chris Woakes ’ injury after a stop-start first day at The Oval.“I don’t know too much, but it doesn’t look too great,” Atkinson said at the press conference. “It’s the last game of the series, so it’s a big shame.”Woakes left the field late in the day with a shoulder injury sustained while fielding. England were already a bowler short after a wayward performance from Jamie Overton and Josh Tongue.Atkinson, though, had a good outing with two wickets and a direct-hit run-out of Shubman Gill . “If we can keep them to 230-240, we’re still in a good position,” he said.India ended the day on 204 for 6, with Karun Nair producing a gutsy unbeaten 52 in testing conditions. It was Nair’s first Test fifty in 3,148 days, the last being his triple century in 2016. He walked in with India wobbling and put together a crucial 51-run stand with Washington Sundar (19*).Nair’s knock, which included seven boundaries, was a rare moment of calm on a day when the ball constantly beat the bat. He brought up his half-century with a couple off Jacob Bethell.With just 64 overs possible due to rain, India will be the happier side after fighting back from 153 for 6. England, meanwhile, will hope Woakes can recover in time to bowl again.","Gus Atkinson made an immediate impact on his return to the England XI.

Poll Do you think Shubman Gill will break more records as captain of the Indian Test team? Yes, definitely No, this is his peak He'll break records in other formats

In what has been a stunning series for Shubman Gill as India’s Test captain, the batter has etched his name into the record books by breaking a 47-year-old milestone.Heading into the fifth and final Test against England at The Oval, India trailed the series 2-1 and needed a win to draw level. But while the team’s position remains challenging, Gill’s individual form has stood out throughout. Leading from the front, he has now scored 737* runs in the series — the most ever by an Indian captain in a single Test series.The previous record was held by the legendary Sunil Gavaskar, who had amassed 732 runs against the West Indies in the 1978/79 series. Gill’s record-breaking moment came during his ongoing knock in the first innings of the final Test, continuing a consistent run of performances that includes four centuries with the highest being a stunning 269.His dominance with the bat has been a central highlight for India in a hard-fought series, as the young skipper continues to grow into the leadership role. While his efforts may not be enough to seal the series unless India win at The Oval, they have certainly marked a new chapter in Indian cricket.Interestingly, while Gill now tops the chart for most Test runs in a series by an Indian captain, Virat Kohli still holds the record in both white-ball formats — 558 runs in an ODI series against South Africa in 2018, and 231 in a T20I series against England in 2021.As captaincy transitions continue across formats, Gill’s red-ball credentials are now firmly established.With Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul gone, the captain will once again need to take matters into his own hands to help India to a formidable first innings total.","Shubman Gill has now scored 737* runs in the series.

Poll How impressed are you with Karun Nair's performance in the fifth Test at The Oval? Very Impressed Somewhat Impressed It's too late

Karun Nair made the most of his opportunity in the fifth and final Test at The Oval, scoring a vital half-century under pressure to keep India afloat after a shaky start. Returning to the playing XI after being dropped for the fourth Test in Manchester, Nair showed grit and calm in challenging conditions.India were in trouble at 83/3 when Nair walked in, and the team needed someone to steady the innings. The 33-year-old did just that, reaching his fifty in 89 balls with a clip off the pads for two runs off Jacob Bethell. It was a quiet celebration, with a raise of the bat towards the dressing room, acknowledging an important knock not just for the match, but for his own career.This was Nair’s second-highest Test score, only behind his iconic unbeaten 303 against England in Chennai back in 2016. That triple century had set high expectations, but this latest knock was his first Test fifty in nearly nine years. To be exact, it was his first fifty in 3,148 days to put things into context. This in itself is a milestone that may revive his red-ball journey.At stumps on Day 1, Nair stood at 52 unbeaten and was part of a 51-run partnership with Washington Sundar, taking India to 204/6. With the series on the line and India trailing 2-1, Nair’s effort was a timely reminder of his potential and perseverance.In a heartwarming moment, England's Joe Root was seen patting the India batter on his back, appreciating his efforts.With the painful wicket of captain Shubman Gill from a run out to both Sai Sudharsan and Raivndra Jadeja dismissed by two unplayable Josh Tongue balls, India were in trouble.

Bombay Sport Exchange: FanCode's Yannick Colaco on toxic fan wars, India's sports ecosystem

NEW DELHI: India leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal has opened up about his divorce from influencer and choreographer Dhanashree Verma, revealing the emotional turmoil and mental health struggles he endured during the difficult phase of his life.In a deeply personal conversation on Raj Shamani’s podcast, Chahal admitted that the separation was not sudden but had been a long, private process. The couple kept their struggles off social media, projecting normalcy until they were certain about ending their marriage.“It was going on for a long while,” Chahal said. “We decided we do not want to show the people... We were like, until we reach the point of the end, we are not going to say anything. We will be like a normal couple on social media. Yes, I was faking it.”Reflecting on their incompatibility, Chahal spoke about how both he and Dhanashree were deeply invested in their careers and struggled to find common ground. “A relationship is like a compromise. If one gets angry, the other has to listen… Two ambitious people can stay together, but everyone has their own lives, their own goals.”The most disturbing aspect, he shared, was the vicious rumours surrounding the breakup.“When I was going through the divorce thing, people labeled me as a cheater. I have never cheated. You won’t get a more loyal person than me,” he said. “Just because you're seen with someone, people link you up and write for views. I have two sisters, I know how to respect women.”Chahal also admitted that the mental strain pushed him to the edge. “For one month, I used to sleep for only two hours. I had suicidal thoughts, I shared them with my friends,” he revealed. “I needed a break from cricket. Even on the field, my mind wasn’t there.”On his viral T-shirt that read ""Be your own sugar daddy"", which he wore to court, Chahal cryptically added, “Something happened from the other side, so I wanted to give this message.”Despite the turmoil, Chahal says the separation was peaceful and mutual. “If things are happening between two people, they can still happen with peace,” he said.",India leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal has opened up about his divorce from influencer and choreographer Dhanashree Verma.
