Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce enjoy stylish date night in NYC ahead of NFL season



Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are soaking in every moment together before football takes over the tight end’s calendar. The couple, who’ve become pop culture’s most talked-about duo, were spotted enjoying a summer date night in New York City on Friday, June 20, just days after appearing together at the NHL’s Stanley Cup Final.The romantic outing unfolded in Manhattan, where Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce were seen leaving a trendy restaurant. In a fan-shared video that quickly circulated online, Kelce, 35, could be seen warmly shaking hands with a staff member before stepping outside. Moments later, Swift followed, her signature elegance on full display. The pair paused briefly before reaching their ride, sharing a small but affectionate gesture as they held hands before getting into their car.Taylor Swift turned heads with a soft, summery look—a light blue bustier-style tank top paired with a white pleated mini skirt. She completed the look with white stilettos and a matching shoulder bag, embodying casual glamour. Kelce complemented her perfectly in a white T-shirt and shorts, offering a relaxed, athletic vibe.Their New York outing came just a week after the duo were seen at Game 4 of the NHL’s Stanley Cup Final in Sunrise, Florida.There, they cheered on the Florida Panthers as they faced off against the Edmonton Oilers. Swift opted for a cream jacket and athletic shorts, paired with her iconic red lipstick. Kelce wore a vibrant red sweatshirt and shorts combo, topped off with a coordinating cap—subtly proving yet again that this couple knows how to serve a coordinated look.But beyond the coordinated fashion and glamorous appearances, the couple seems to be prioritizing quality time. According to a source close to Taylor Swift, she is “really looking forward” to supporting Kelce during the upcoming NFL season. “Not just because she loves supporting Travis,” the insider shared with PEOPLE, “but because for the first full season since they started dating, she’s not juggling a packed tour schedule. ”Swift recently wrapped up her record-breaking Eras Tour in December 2024. Spanning five continents and grossing over $2 billion, it became the highest-grossing tour in music history. With her schedule finally free of cross-country flights and nightly performances, this fall promises more stability for the couple. “The past two seasons were a whirlwind between performing across multiple countries, long flights, and trying to squeeze in alone time together wherever possible. It wasn’t easy, but they made it work,” the source added.As Kelce gears up for another run with the Kansas City Chiefs, the couple seems committed to making the most of the calm before the storm—hand in hand, in love, and very much in sync. Recently, according to some fan page, Taylor Swift spotted at the TEU event with Travis Kelce. As we are 10 weeks always from season kick off, fans are hoping to see Swift more frequently.Also Read: ""Still got cheated on by his wife"": Shirtless at 47, Tom Brady flexes shredded physique and fans bring Gisele Bundchen reference","Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce enjoyed a date night in New York City on Friday.

Antonio Brown leaves country after attempted murder warrant but he can’t run forever,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/antonio-brown-leaves-country-after-attempted-murder-warrant-but-he-cant-run-forever/articleshow/122025677.cms,"(Image via Getty)

Antonio Brown is wanted in Florida for attempted murder but he left the country instead



“I’m out the country, ain’t no more child support, tell your mama get a job.”

From abroad, Brown mocks child support and doubles down on his defiance



“Ain’t no more child support, tell your mama get a job.”

Antonio Brown just crossed another line and this one might be the hardest to come back from. The former NFL wide receiver, once known for his record-breaking catches, is now making headlines for something far darker: facing an attempted murder charge and fleeing the country before the warrant could be enforced.But instead of laying low, AB is doing what AB does best, making it worse.On June 11, Florida authorities issued a warrant for Brown’s arrest on second-degree attempted murder charges after a violent altercation outside a celebrity boxing event in Miami. Reports allege that Brown punched a man, disarmed a security guard, and fired two shots, one of which grazed the victim’s neck.The bond was set at $10,000, and Brown was ordered to remain on house arrest once taken into custody.But instead of turning himself in, he left. Authorities confirmed that Brown is no longer in the United States, with most signs pointing to Dubai or somewhere in the Middle East.Brown took to X (formerly Twitter) with a jaw-dropping message:The internet’s jaw dropped, and just like that, Antonio Brown reminded the world why he’s no longer seen as a misunderstood star, but a full-blown PR disaster.Law enforcement is now waiting for him to return, at which point he’ll be arrested.If there was ever a moment to show remorse or at the very least, silence—this was it. But Antonio Brown, never one to read the room, decided to post this instead:This comes after multiple past legal issues involving unpaid child support. And now, the post has triggered massive backlash, with fans and critics calling it “disgusting,” “clueless,” and “beyond saving.”Brown also lashed out at the media, claiming he was being portrayed unfairly and that he's the victim of ""racist profiling.""Legally, Brown can’t run forever. Miami police say they’ve been in touch with his legal team and plan to arrest him as soon as he returns to U.S. soil. However, without an international warrant, his stay abroad may delay the process, possibly on purpose.But legally delayed doesn’t mean forgiven. And publicly? The damage might already be permanent.Also read - When Odell Beckham Jr. revealed how he never wanted to leave the Giants and fans were heartbroken all over again","Antonio Brown is wanted in Florida for attempted murder but he left the country instead of turning himself in.

Is jersey number 0 cursed? Fans can’t get over insane theory after Tyrese Haliburton’s injury resembled Damian Lillard and Jayson Tatum,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/is-jersey-number-0-cursed-fans-cant-get-over-insane-theory-after-tyrese-haliburtons-injury-resembled-damian-lillard-and-jayson-tatum/articleshow/122026901.cms,"Jayson Tatum, Tyrese Haliburton and Damian Lillard.

Tyrese Haliburton’s Achilles injury resembled Damian Lillard and Jayson Tatum , which sparked jersey no. 0 curse speculation



Fans react to the theory of the cursed jersey number 0



Tyrese Haliburton’s injury has put the Indiana Pacers far behind the winning line in the NBA Game 7 finals decider, as the OKC Thunder eventually secured the 103-93 win. As Haliburton fell on the floor after a non-contact injury, a wild theory surfaced, which coincidentally reflects that three NBA superstars who wore jersey no. 0 succumbed to the same Achilles during postseason games. Many fans believe that the jersey number is cursed as three fallen star lost their chance of a championship.So, is jersey number 0 cursed? While any rational thinker would dismiss it as a superstition, a recently surfaced wild theory suggests that three NBA stars— Damian Lillard, Jayson Tatum, and now Tyrese Haliburton have met with the same fate, coincidentally, they wear the same jersey number.Let’s put things in perspective, Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton had been battling a nagging calf strain for several games leading up to the NBA Finals. But in Game 7 against the Oklahoma City Thunder, his worst fears materialized. Just minutes into the first quarter, Haliburton crumpled to the floor clutching his lower leg. His father later confirmed it was a torn Achilles.“I know the risks, I know everything that comes with it.I just had to hear it was OK,” Haliburton had said days earlier. The 24-year-old had been the heart of Indiana’s playoff run, averaging 17.3 points, 8.6 assists, and 5.3 rebounds, including four game-winning shots. His exit not only cost the Pacers their floor general but also highlighted the growing list of casualties this postseason.Damian Lillard and Jayson Tatum add to the injury epidemic. The string of Achilles injuries began with Milwaukee Bucks guard Lillard, who went down in Game 4 of the first round. Just weeks later, Boston Celtics forward Tatum followed suit in the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the New York Knicks. Both stars, according to former NBA All-Star Gilbert Arenas, had reportedly been experiencing calf pain prior to the injury, just like Haliburton.“Even with Jayson Tatum… and Dame — [I asked] was your calf hurting before? And they both said yes,” Arenas revealed during a Finals watch party.Their stories mirror a larger trend. According to injury analyst Jeff Stotts, eight Achilles tears occurred during the 2024–25 NBA season—a staggering number that already shattered the previous high of five. That count doesn’t even include Haliburton, Thanasis Antetokounmpo (preseason), or draft prospect Jalon Moore (via Sporting News).NBA fans, especially the Indiana Pacers supporters, were quick to respond to the wild theory.“Unbelievable,” one fan reacted with a shocked-faced emoticon.“No way that's insane,” another reacted.“Zero chance this is a coincidence??” one fan made a claver joke on the theory.“There’s some voodoo afoot,” another wrote.It is possible that the reason for these injuries is fatigue, overwork, and even low-top shoes as potential contributors. With players clocking over 40 minutes per night during the postseason, many believe the physical load is simply unsustainable. Achilles injuries, after all, are among the most traumatic in sports, often requiring a year of rehab with no guaranteed full recovery.","Tyrese Haliburton’s Achilles injury has put the Indiana Pacers far behind the winning line in the NBA Game 7 finals decider, as the OKC Thunder eventually secured the 103-93 win.

KL Rahul press conference: On his role, being elder brother in team, role clarity and match

Former India left-arm spinner Dilip Doshi passed away following a cardiac arrest in London on Monday, the Saurashtra Cricket Association confirmed. He was 77. Sachin Tendulkar paid an emotional tribute on X, recalling their first meeting in the UK in 1990. “I met Dilipbhai for the first time in the UK in 1990, and he bowled to me in the nets on that tour. He was really fond of me, and I reciprocated his feelings. A warm-hearted soul like Dilipbhai will be deeply missed. I will miss those cricketing conversations which we invariably had. May his soul rest in peace. Om Shanti,” Tendulkar wrote.Doshi made his Test debut in 1979 after Bishan Singh Bedi’s retirement and went on to play 33 Tests until 1983, taking 114 wickets, including six five-wicket hauls. He was especially effective at home in his early years, picking up 100 wickets in just 28 Tests.His most memorable performance came at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1981 when he bowled with a fractured toe and claimed five wickets to help India defend a modest target.A stalwart in the English county circuit, Doshi played over a decade of county cricket for Nottinghamshire and Warwickshire. In the domestic circuit in India, he represented Bengal and Saurashtra and took an impressive 898 wickets in first-class cricket with 43 five-fors.Former BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah expressed his grief, calling Doshi’s death a personal loss. “He was like family and one of the finest human beings,” Shah said.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Known for his pin-point accuracy and clever flight, Doshi often troubled top international batting line-ups. He was respected by teammates and opponents alike, although Pakistan’s Javed Miandad famously teased him during matches by asking for his room number mid-game.After retiring, Doshi settled in London where he found success in business.

Poll Do you believe in shared parenting responsibilities? Yes, absolutely! No, it's traditional roles

Jasprit Bumrah press conference: Lashes out at critics, dropped catches and no balls

NEW DELHI: Bollywood actor Anushka shared candid insights into her approach to parenting with her husband, cricketer Virat Kohli . Now parents to 4-year-old Vamika and 15-month-old Akaay, the couple have consistently prioritised shared responsibilities, balanced parenting, and shielding their children from the glare of social media.Reflecting on the early influence of family upbringing, Anushka spoke about the importance of values and the home environment in shaping a child’s worldview.""Conditioning is the most important role in how we see the world. I come from a progressive background, so that will always be a part of our home. Love is the underlying factor in our home, and what's important to us is that our child be respectful of people. You have to create that value structure. We don't want to raise brats,"" Anushka told Vogue.She also emphasised that raising children isn’t about dividing responsibilities along traditional gender lines but about working together as a cohesive unit.""We don't see it as mum and dad duties, but as a family unit. For us, it's important that our child be raised with a very balanced outlook. It is all about shared duties. I will be the primary caregiver, especially in the first few years, and that's the reality.I am self-employed and I can decide when I am working if I do one or two films a year. In Virat's case, he plays round the year. What becomes important is the time we spend together as a family. ""Speaking about evolving societal norms, Anushka underlined the importance of setting the right example for children in a working household.""Times have changed. It's important for children to look at their parents—they learn from you. And there is a sense of normalcy that both of us do work. Of course, one will have to manage things differently and more efficiently to work.""Firm in their stance on privacy, the couple has made a conscious choice to keep their children away from the spotlight and social media.""We've thought about it a lot. We definitely do not want to raise a child in the public eye—we don't plan on engaging our child in social media. I think it's a decision your child should be able to take. No kid should be made to be more special than the other. It's hard enough for adults to deal with it. It's going to be difficult, but we intend to follow through.""On the unpredictable journey of parenthood, Anushka offered a reminder that there’s no manual to get it all right.""You have to learn as you go; you can't pressurise yourself, but you have to be prepared because there will be curveballs.""Over the years, Anushka and Virat have been admired not only as public figures but also as parents who’ve remained intentional and grounded while raising their children out of the limelight.","Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli are parents to 4-year-old Vamika and 15-month-old Akaay.

“Straight ball hai, Rishabh aise yeh jaroori nahi hai theke? Marna hai to seedha lag jayega na iss ball pe zabardasti with the wind try kare jaa raha hai.”

KL Rahul press conference: On his role, being elder brother in team, role clarity and match

India vice-captain Rishabh Pant yet again proved why he is one of the most entertaining characters in world cricket, both with his audacious shots and with the conversations he has with himself in the middle.On Day 4 of the first Test against England at Headingley, Pant added another gem to his growing collection of iconic knocks overseas. After scoring a masterful 134 in the first innings, he stitched a momentum-shifting 195-run partnership with KL Rahul in the second innings and brought up his second century of the match, becoming the first Indian to score twin tons in a Test in England.While Pant’s flamboyance is well-known, what caught the stump mic and the cameras was his candid reminder to himself during one of his adventurous attempts against Shoaib Bashir. Eyeing another innovative stroke, Pant muttered,This self-advice came as he was trying to reverse scoop a delivery that did not warrant such a shot. Moments later, Pant calmed himself down and returned to a more traditional approach, eventually steering India towards a massive lead.Pant’s 118 off 140 balls in the second innings secured his place in an elite club. He became only the second designated wicketkeeper after Andy Flower to notch hundreds in both innings of a Test. He also matched the record for the most sixes in a Test innings in England, hitting nine maximums, a feat previously achieved by Andrew Flintoff and Ben Stokes Quiz: Who's that IPL player? His innings pushed his tally in England to 808 runs from 10 Tests at an impressive average above 42. His match total of 252 runs is now the highest for a wicketkeeper in a Test in England, surpassing Alec Stewart’s 204 against South Africa in 1998.After reaching his milestone, batting legend Sunil Gavaskar asked Pant to celebrate with a somersault. Pant, however, gave his trademark grin and saved the flip for another day. He instead continued his charge, smacking Joe Root for a mix of unconventional sweeps and classical lofted drives before falling for 118, caught by Zak Crawley.While India’s lower order folded quickly, Pant and Rahul’s fireworks gave India a massive cushion, leaving England to chase 371 on a wearing Headingley surface.Fans will remember this innings not just for the runs but also for Pant’s honest, almost comic self-talk that reflects the genius and unpredictability that define him.","Rishabh Pant is the first Indian to score twin tons in a Test in England.

Greenstone Lobo predicts winner of IND vs ENG series | Who Has the Astrological Edge?

LONDON: Former India left-arm spinner Dilip Doshi passed away due to cardiac arrest here on Monday. He was 77. Doshi played 33 Tests and 15 ODIs from 1979 to 1983.Mourning the death of Doshi, the Saurashtra Cricket Association, whom Doshi represented in first-class cricket, stated, ""The SCA is deeply pained and very sad at the passing away of Dilip Doshi, a revered, distinguished, and prominent figure in the world of cricket. He left for his heavenly abode today in London. He has left behind a rich legacy of sportsmanship, commitment, and excellence. The legendary left-arm spinner was a stalwart of Indian cricket, renowned for his unparalleled skill and dedication to the game.""Doshi had recently attended the BCCI Awards function and the World Test Championship final at Lord's earlier this month.""Doshi was a true and spirited Saurashtrian and a legendary left-arm leg-spinner in the cricket world. Despite his late India debut, he achieved many remarkable milestones and was a pure match-winner. Dilipbhai reached the 100-wicket mark in only 28 Tests. He played 33 Tests and took 114 wickets, including six five-wicket hauls. He played 238 first-class matches, taking a staggering 898 wickets, including 43 five-wicket hauls and six 10-wicket hauls. In 15 ODIs, he took 22 wickets, including two four-wicket hauls.These figures say it all about his class.""""Dilipbhai’s passion for cricket was exceptional and beyond compare. He rated his five-wicket haul in the Melbourne Test in 1981 against Australia as his best performance. He continued bowling in spite of acute pain due to a fractured toe. He did it because he believed Team India would win the match. Such was the depth of his passion for the game. Sir Garfield Sobers had rightly said that 'Dilip Doshi has an immeasurable knowledge to pass on to those who want to follow his path into professional cricket. He has played at all levels over the world and there can be no one more qualified to talk about the art of spin bowling.'""Expressing his ""profound grief"" at Doshi's passing, Niranjan Shah, former secretary of the BCCI, said: “It is an extremely painful and personal loss for me. Dilip was not only one of the legendary cricketers, but also one of the finest human beings I have ever known. His noble heart, integrity, and priceless dedication to the game made him truly special. He was family—someone I shared not just cricketing conversations with, but also a deep bond built on mutual respect and affection. His presence always brought warmth, humility, and positive energy. The void he leaves behind is beyond words. It is not just the world of cricket, but my own heart that feels his absence deeply. I shall always cherish the beautiful memories and moments we spent together. His legacy will live on through the many lives he inspired.”SCA president Jaydev Shah stated: “His passing is an irreparable loss to the cricketing fraternity, and to all of us who had the honour of knowing him. His legacy, both as a player and a person, will continue to live in our hearts and in the history of cricket. This is an incredibly painful and personal loss for me. He was not just a legendary cricketer—he was my uncle, my mentor, and someone I looked up to throughout my life. His deep love for the sport, disciplined approach, and graceful conduct made him a role model for generations. For many of us, he was not only a hero on the field but also a guide and a well-wisher off it. Indian cricket has lost a true legend today. Everyone at the SCA conveys his/her heartfelt condolences to the late Dilip Doshi’s family and prays to the Almighty to grant eternal peace to his noble soul.""","Former India left-arm spinner Dilip Doshi passed away due to cardiac arrest here on Monday.

Trevor Zegras becomes another Philadelphia as Pat Verbeek pounds the puck over the Anaheim Ducks

In a somewhat shocking yet largely confirmed rumour, the Anaheim Ducks have traded forward Trevor Zegras to the Philadelphia Flyers. The blockbuster trade corresponds with the aggressive off-season approach the Ducks are taking in order to reconstruct a roster that simply has been a failure in recent years. Zegras will now restart his life as the next great cornerstone in Philadelphia, while Anaheim intends to reshape its core around younger, more flexible assets and future NHL Draft picks.Twenty-four years young and one of the most marketed faces of the NHL, Trevor Zegras here holds fort in a major roster overhaul involving his name. In respect to his trade, the Ducks acquired forward Ryan Poehling, the 45th pick in the upcoming draft, and a 2026 fourth-round pick. The deal is indicative of Ducks' GM Pat Verbeek's strategy to capitalize on draft capital and handle their cap space in advance, keeping the agenda to freshen the team's identity in his mind.Zegras had 12 goals and 32 points in a 2024–25 injury-affected season after injuring his meniscus and missing the last 22 games. But still, considering how spectacular he has profiled and with prior spells of 65 points in 2022–23 and being named the EA Sports NHL cover athlete, this only underlines his offensive versatility.In Philadelphia, Zegras is expected to serve as a top-six forward and act as a cornerstone in the reshaping of the franchise's offense.The Ducks, meanwhile, continue to be highly aggressive this summer. With Kreider and the future being anointed with Joel Quenneville, Anaheim wants to step in the direction of long-term competitiveness under whom Verbeek has been given carte blanche. They operate with more than $36 million in cap space, with some very important RFAs to secure, including Mason McTavish and Lukas Dostal.A former 25th overall pick, Ryan Poehling adds a level of depth and versatility to Anaheim's forward group. Though not a star, his 31-point campaign in Philadelphia has yielded steady improvement and dependability. He has one year left on an inexpensive $1.5 million deal, offering the Ducks extra leverage heading into 2025-26.Also Read: Team USA’s Trevor Zegras eyes redemption at the 2025 IIHF World Championship The trade for Trevor Zegras is more than just a typical trade done at the 11th hour; it becomes a historic moment to define Anaheim's long-term view.

Tyrese Haliburton’s injury in Game 7 has sparked outrage among fans



Tyrese Haliburton, one of the most popular and talented players in the NBA, left the Indiana Pacers’ fans shocked and heartbroken as he had to exit Game 7 of the NBA finals early due to an injury on his right leg. With Game 7 being the third consecutive game in which the Indiana Pacers lost against the Oklahoma City Thunder, fans are now questioning young players and the way they have gotten injured this season.Tyrese Hailburton’s injury has sparked a discussion about what has been going wrong with the players this season and it has sparked a divide among fans.While some fans have blamed the number of games the players have to participate in, others have blamed the young players’ lifestyle.A fan took to X and wrote, “As physical as the 90s were, you hardly ever heard of players tearing their Achilles. They already take games off, it sucks those players got hurt but how much softer do we want the NBA?”Another fan posted, “How about these guys are in better shape eat better train better than the guys in the 80s and you want to shorten the season? lol make things easier for people that have it easy”.A third fan wrote, “So we are supposedly seeing more advanced athletes than ever before, but they can’t handle as many games as guys have played for 40 years now? You get paid big money to play 82+games, do it”, while another user posted, “Or unpopular opinion, these dude need to start taking care of their bodies? If it was a season issue, a lot more players would be having these type of injuries.”However, neither the Indiana Pacers nor Tyrese Haliburton has responded to the speculations yet.Tyrese Hailburton has been dealing with many injuries this season, and before Game 6, he had spoken about playing even though he was in pain.He had said, “These are the men who I’m willing to fight with, and we’ve had a very special season together, developing a special bond in our team.

AFC on Alert: Kansas City Chiefs still cast the longest shadow in the conference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/afc-on-alert-kansas-city-chiefs-still-cast-the-longest-shadow-in-the-conference/articleshow/122038194.cms,"Chiefs AFC win analysis (Image via LAPRESSE)

NFL Network analysts point to leadership, depth, and dynasty DNA



AFC challengers like Bills, Ravens, and Bengals still fall short



While the rest of the AFC reloads for a title push, the Kansas City Chiefs remain the team no one wants to face when it matters. Their recent Super Bowl stumble hasn't shaken their grip on the conference. With elite talent and proven leadership, the Chiefs aren't just surviving—they're still dominating. As training camps approach, the gap remains wider than rivals would like to admit. NFL Network’s Good Morning Football featured former running back Rashad Jennings, who emphasized why KC still rules the AFC. “Patrick Mahomes, they have Andy Reid, Travis Kelce is still there, they're bringing back healthy receivers—in short, yes,” he said. Jennings added, “They’re the best team, they’ve built a dynasty, they made the Super Bowl last year—that’s the only thing they could have done besides win.” That belief is echoed across NFL circles.The Chiefs enter the 2025 season with a roster that looks battle-ready and refreshed. Their receiving corps is recovering well, and with rookies and veterans stepping up, the offense could be even faster than last year. Jaylon Moore and Josh Simmons are projected to boost the O-line, offering more protection for Mahomes.When Kansas City retools, they do it with precision and purpose.It’s not that Buffalo, Cincinnati, or Baltimore lack star power—it’s that Kansas City continues to outperform when it counts. Despite playoff hype, none of these contenders have ousted the Chiefs over the last three postseasons. Mahomes continues to be the postseason’s most reliable weapon, thriving under pressure and producing wins.Defensively, Kansas City retains its aggressive identity, and continuity in coaching gives them an edge over younger, reshuffled staffs. Their culture, chemistry, and experience create a barrier others can’t yet cross. While other AFC teams hope to close the gap, Kansas City is already building toward another February run. And according to the NFL Network, no one has earned the right to claim their throne.Also read: NFL Trade Rumor: Post-mandatory minicamp stars who could be moved before training camp The Kansas City Chiefs aren't chasing the AFC—they are the AFC.

Despite playing some questionable shots early in his innings, Pant reached his century in the 70th over off Shoaib Bashir's bowling.The 27-year-old keeper-batsman's aggressive style of play has often been a subject of debate, but Rahul emphasised that there is a clear method behind Pant's approach to batting in Test cricket.""It is hard for us to understand his mindset but you let Rishabh Pant be Rishabh Pant. There is obviously a method to his madness as he is averaging 45 in Test cricket. There is a lot of thinking about the outrageous shots he plays. You just try to calm him down as much as possible between balls,"" Rahul told reporters after the day's play.The historic achievement by Pant has put India in a strong position going into the final day of the Test match.England started their chase, reaching 21/0 in six overs at stumps, with Zak Crawley showing more resilience compared to his first innings dismissal.Rahul expressed confidence about the match situation while acknowledging the challenge ahead.

Music drop stuns fans amid serious criminal allegations



Once a Super Bowl champ, now a viral headline-maker



Just when fans thought Antonio Brown’s controversies had peaked, the former NFL star dropped another bomb—this time, in the music world. Amid reports of an attempted murder warrant in connection with a Miami boxing event, Brown surprised the internet by releasing a song with rapper Trippie Redd, worth $5 million per Celebrity Net Worth. The move left NFL followers and critics alike questioning his priorities. The once-dominant wide receiver now appears to be doubling down on his rap career—even while allegedly on the run.According to reports, Brown is wanted for attempted murder with a firearm, with authorities instructing him to stay under house arrest until trial. However, as of now, he has not turned himself in. Instead, Brown appeared active online, promoting his latest song collab on X. This shocking decision prompted disbelief among fans, who quickly took to social media to react.One fan wrote, ""Ain’t you evading the law somewhere?"", summing up the general sentiment. Another joked, ""Next release: Jailhouse Rock,"" referencing the irony of his musical activity while being legally pursued. A third added, ""We need a troll rap,"" highlighting the absurdity of the situation. With each post, the online conversation around Brown grew more intense.Brown's decision to continue his music career while under such serious accusations has divided public opinion. Some see it as bold defiance, others view it as a PR distraction. His collaborations continue to draw attention, but not always the kind he may want. The move has also raised questions about accountability for celebrities in the spotlight.Brown last played in the NFL with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2021, where his dramatic mid-game exit effectively ended his football career. Since then, he has focused on building his rap persona—releasing songs, creating buzz, and courting controversy.

During the Game 7 of 2025 NBA Finals, as the Oklahoma City Thunder dominated and decimated Indiana Pacers with an overall score of 103-91, ESPN’s reputed commentator Doris Burke diverted the attention of the NBA fans for all the wrong reasons.

Sitanshu Kotak press conference: Big revelation on Shubman Gill

NEW DELHI: Legendary Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has expressed strong reservations over the naming of the ongoing five-match Test series between India and England as the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy. Gavaskar argued that Sachin Tendulkar ’s name should appear before James Anderson’s, citing Tendulkar’s seniority and vastly superior achievements in international cricket.Writing in his column for Mid-Day, Gavaskar dismissed the reasoning that names were ordered alphabetically and took particular aim at the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) for their decision.“The ECB is fully entitled to call the series by any name they choose but for most, if not all, Indian cricket lovers it is jarring to know that Anderson's name comes first. Not only is Sachin Tendulkar along with Kapil Dev the greatest Indian cricketer, but also senior to Anderson by more than a dozen years. He is numero uno as far as runs and centuries are concerned in Test cricket but also at the one-day level too he has more runs than anybody else,” Gavaskar wrote.The former India captain continued by underlining the disparity in accomplishments between the two cricketing icons.“Anderson is third in the list of wicket takers in Test cricket and his record is nowhere as good as Tendulkar in one-day cricket. Tendulkar is also part of a World Cup winning team which Anderson has not been.Jimmy Anderson was a terrific bowler but mainly in English conditions and his record away is nowhere near as good as Tendulkar's is,” he added.Gavaskar also called upon Indian fans and the media to refer to the series as the Tendulkar-Anderson Trophy, flipping the current order to reflect what he believes is the more appropriate recognition.In the same column, Gavaskar offered suggestions regarding the Pataudi Medal of Excellence, which is currently awarded to the captain of the series-winning team. He questioned the logic behind that structure.“Why the captain and what if the series is drawn? That's why it would have been better to have had a Pataudi medal for the man of the match for every Test, culminating in the Pataudi Trophy for the player of the series. This way, the Pataudis will be remembered after every Test match played as well as after the series is finished in England,” Gavaskar remarked.","Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar has expressed strong reservations over the naming of the ongoing five-match Test series as the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.

Alex Caruso clears the air after Thunder title comment sparks talk of shade toward 2020 Lakers championship



After helping the Oklahoma City Thunder clinch the 2025 NBA championship in a thrilling Game 7 win over the Indiana Pacers, veteran guard Alex Caruso found himself at the center of an unexpected controversy. During the postgame celebration, a comment he made — seemingly lighthearted — sparked debate among fans, particularly those of the Los Angeles Lakers, regarding the legitimacy of the team’s 2020 bubble title. Caruso’s words quickly went viral, prompting him to clear the air and explain the true intent behind his remarks.Alex Caruso, who played a major role in the OKC Thunder’s playoff success, was quite emotional following his second championship. Reflecting on his journey, he made a comment that many took as a jab at his former team and the unusual nature of the Lakers’ 2020 title run. Now, after the statement got wide attention online, he jumped on social media to set the record straight. “I had 3 beers already, it’s SARCASM!!” Caruso posted on X, assuring fans that the comment was made in jest.Post-game, Caruso was asked about how he would compare the 2020 Los Angeles Lakers Championship run. He said:“Yeah, now I got a real one. Now nobody can say anything,” Caruso said with a grin during his postgame press conference. “Yeah, I think just because of the way the team is constructed now versus the team I had in 2020, like it was much harder with this team just because of the experience, right?”He elaborated further on what made this title feel different, “And everybody talked about you need experience, win a championship, and you need this, that, and the other.And I said multiple times through the postseason with this team that the good basketball is good basketball, winning basketball is winning basketball.”Caruso added, “And the best team can win no matter what happens if you go out there and execute and do the stuff that you need to do to win the game. And I think through the playoffs, this team grew up and learned on the fly, which most teams have to learn through losses and learn through defeat. And I think this team learned through success.”While many interpreted the “real one” comment as a dig at the Lakers’ 2020 title — won inside the NBA’s COVID-19 bubble at Walt Disney World — Caruso was quick to dispel the notion that he was diminishing the value of that achievement.Also Read: “We won’t remember it” — NBA legend Gilbert Arenas drops bombshell take on OKC Thunder’s championship run for one reason In Game 7 of the 2025 Finals, Caruso logged 32 minutes, finishing with 10 points, three rebounds, three steals, and a block.","Alex Caruso helped the Oklahoma City Thunder clinch the 2025 NBA championship in a thrilling Game 7 win over the Indiana Pacers.

Brady's team insists, Parsons pushes back



From rivals to respect: jersey finally promised



Micah Parsons may be one of the NFL ’s most feared defenders, but even he turned into a fan for a moment when he met Tom Brady in person this weekend. At the star-studded Fanatics Fest in New York City, the Dallas Cowboys linebacker finally confronted the retired quarterback — not for a sack, but for a missing Brady jersey he says he's never received. What followed was a playful but slightly tense exchange that quickly went viral online. Cameras captured the moment Parsons publicly called out Brady, proving even NFL stars have bucket-list fan requests.During the interaction, Brady asked his crew, “Have we signed one for Micah and sent one his way? A jersey?” His team claimed they had already done so, but Parsons wasn’t convinced. “No, you’re lying,” he replied with a smile. “I’ve never gotten a jersey. I wouldn’t lie to you.”Parsons pressed further, saying, “I called you out last year about it.” The defensive star didn’t shy away from his disappointment, adding, “I just want a jersey, bro. Put it in my house.” The exchange highlighted a rare, candid side of two elite athletes normally seen only on the gridiron. Fans watching the clip applauded Parsons' honesty — and Brady's cool-headed response.Though the conversation began awkwardly, it ended on a warm note with Brady promising to send a signed jersey to Parsons soon. The light-hearted confrontation marked a full-circle moment — from on-field rivals to mutual respect off the field.

Which title match is no longer taking place at WWE Night of Champions this year?

WWE Night of Champions 2025 was set to showcase some highly compelling championship title matches. The GOAT, John Cena, is set to defend his Undisputed WWE Championship against CM Punk, and Jacob Fatu will put his WWE United States title on the line against his former Bloodline cohort, Solo Sikoa. There was another championship bout scheduled to take place at Night of Champions this year. However, on the go-home edition of Monday Night RAW, the match was taken off the card.On the June 23rd edition of Monday Night RAW, General Manager Adam Pearce was in a conversation with AJ Styles in his office. The Phenomenal One was set to clash against Dominik Mysterio for his WWE Intercontinental Championship at Night of Champions. However, Pearce informed Styles that Mysterio was not medically cleared to compete, and henceforth, the match was not taking place at the event.This came just a week after Dominik Mysterio's onscreen girlfriend, Liv Morgan, injured her shoulder last week on RAW. Now, Dirty Dom has also suffered a setback. While WWE did not disclose the nature of his injury, he was present on this week's RAW in a backstage segment with The Judgment Day.Furthermore, WWE wasted no time in filling the void. Heated rivals Rhea Ripley and Raquel Rodriguez will settle their weeks of tensions at Night of Champions in a Street Fight. This came after Mami engaged in a brawl with Rodriguez, who put her through a table. The other match made official for Night of Champions will see Sami Zayn and Karrion Kross competing in a singles match. Kross has been trying to get in Zayn's head for weeks. This week on RAW, Zayn punched him in the face backstage and told him that they will go one-on-one at Night of Champions.As for AJ Styles, it is expected that he will eventually get his shot at the Intercontinental title against Dominik Mysterio. So it remains to be seen when Dominik Mysterio will be cleared for in-ring action and give Styles the match he deserves.Also read: WWE RAW Results & Highlights (6/23/25): Cody Rhodes gets one step closer to become King of the Ring and m","WWE Night of Champions 2025 was set to showcase some highly compelling championship title matches.

Tyrese Haliburton undergoes surgery and speaks from the heart in a heartfelt message



Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton faced the cruelest twist of fate during the most important game of his career. Just seven minutes into Game 7 of the NBA Finals, Haliburton, who had started hot with three early three-pointers, collapsed to the floor in pain. Diagnosed with a torn Achilles, the injury forced him out of the game, leaving the Pacers without their leader in a 103–91 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. On Monday, he addressed fans with a vulnerable, emotional message from his hospital bed.Following surgery in New York City, Tyrese Haliburton took to social media Monday night, just one day after the injury, to express gratitude and share his mindset.“Man. Don’t know how to explain it other than shock. Words cannot express the pain of this letdown. The frustration is unfathomable. I’ve worked my whole life to get to this moment and this is how it ends? Makes no sense,” Haliburton shared.He continued, “Now that I’ve gotten surgery, I wish I could count the number of times people will tell me I’m going to “come back stronger”. What a cliche lol, this shit sucks. My foot feels like dead weight fam. But what’s hurting most I think is my mind.Feel like I’m rambling, but I know this is something I’ll look back on when I’m through this, as something I’m proud I fought through. It feels good to let this shit out without y’all seeing the kid ugly cry. ”Haliburton added that he has no regrets and would ""do it again"" for his team and city. Despite the torn Achilles, he believes the experience will shape him into a better man and player. “At 25, I’ve already learned that God never gives us more than we can handle. I know I’ll come out on the other side of this a better man and a better player. And honestly, right now, torn Achilles and all, I don’t regret it. I’d do it again, and again after that, to fight for this city and my brothers. For the chance to do something special.”The Pacers guard also issued an emotional apology to Indiana fans, promising to fight like hell to return stronger and finish what they started. Quoting Kobe Bryant, he vowed to stop feeling sorry for himself and get to work with the same drive and conviction.“Indy, I’m sorry,” he apologized. “If any fan base doesn’t deserve this, it’s y’all. But together we are going to fight like hell to get back to this very spot, and get over this hurdle. I don’t doubt for a second that y’all have my back, and I hope you guys know that I have yours. I think Kobe said it best when in this same situation. ‘There are far greater issues/challenges in the world then a torn achilles. Stop feeling sorry for yourself, find the silver lining and get to work with the same belief, same drive and same conviction as ever. ’ And that’s exactly right. I will do everything in my power to get back right.”Further, with confidence and humility, Haliburton promised to dust himself off and return as the best version of himself. “My journey to get to where I am today wasn’t by happenstance, I’ve pushed myself every day to be great. And I will continue to do just that,” he shared.“The most important part of this all, is that I’m grateful. I’m grateful for every single experience that’s led me here. I’m grateful for all the love from the hoop world. I don’t “have to” go through this, I get to go through this. I’m grateful for the road that lies ahead. Watch how I come back from this. So, give me some time, I’ll dust myself off and get right back to being the best version of Tyrese Haliburton.”Later, he added his jersey number, with apparently a minus sign, and then finished his lengthy message for fans with a quote from the Bible. “Proverbs 3:5-6 ‘Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight.’”Also Read: NBA world reacts as Indiana Pacers lose star Tyrese Haliburton to injury just before halftime lead in Game 7 of NBA Finals Haliburton is currently in the recovery process.

But the real excitement starts at pick 3, where Philadelphia might go for the adaptable Baylor wing VJ Edgecombe, who ""checks all the boxes"" for their defensive and athletic requirements.Right now, Ace Bailey's draft stock is taking a hit because he's reportedly skipped pre-draft workouts, causing some concern for scouts. Don't forget to keep an eye on the Brooklyn Nets, who have four first-round picks (8th, 19th, 26th, 27th) and could be looking to make some roster changes.As draft night approaches, the Maverick-focused No. 1 pick wraps up the lottery saga, Freddie teams up with Harper, and the real discussions kick off: will Edgecombe remain in place, will Bailey drop, or could a surprise like Knueppel or Fears rise up?

2025 highlights: Familiar faces and dramatic falls



Is it just madness or tradition





Every year on a steep hill in Gloucestershire, England, hundreds gather to chase a rolling 7-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down a dangerously steep slope. Known as the Cooper’s Hill Cheese Rolling Contest, the event is chaotic, absurd, and completely thrilling. With participants tumbling, somersaulting, and crashing their way to the bottom, the headline “People sprint to catch a 7-pound wheel of cheese” is technically accurate, but it doesn’t quite capture the madness, tradition, and injuries that define this bizarre British spectacle. So, is it a good headline? That depends on what you’re hoping to convey.The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. Dating back at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize. It sounds simple, but the event is notorious for its steep incline, dangerous tumbles, and frequent injuries.The hill is so steep that it's nearly impossible to stay upright. Most participants end up tumbling head over heels, colliding with each other or the ground.Gravity takes over quickly, and the cheese, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, is almost never actually caught. Still, competitors willingly risk sprains, fractures, and concussions for a shot at glory and a round of cheese.This year, German YouTuber Tom Kopke claimed victory for the second year in a row. Shirtless and triumphant, he declared, “I risked my life for this. It’s my cheese. Back to back.” On the women’s side, Ava Sender Logan from London tumbled repeatedly but emerged victorious, saying, “It felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head. I’m fine.” Around them, spectators packed the woods and fences for a glimpse of the chaos.While the event may seem absurd to outsiders, for locals and returning participants, it’s a point of pride and cultural identity. Despite calls to regulate or cancel it over safety concerns, the contest continues to thrive, drawing international competitors and media attention. Volunteers, medics, and long-time residents treat it as an important local tradition","The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire.

Continuing his remarkable record in challenging SENA (South Africa, England, New Zealand, Australia) conditions, Rahul crafted his third Test hundred on English soil — and sixth overall in SENA — to put India firmly in control of the opening Test. His 195-run partnership with Rishabh Pant pushed India’s second innings lead to 370, setting England a daunting 371-run target.Reflecting on his form after the day’s play, Rahul toldthat he no longer obsesses over numbers or milestones. “I am just getting runs now. There was a time when I would get starts but not convert them into big scores, especially in Tests. I am much calmer in my head and not chasing numbers anymore. I just want to enjoy my cricket as much as I can,” he said.He also credited former India assistant coach Abhishek Nayar for playing a key role in reviving his approach. “I have spent a lot of time with him in the last 15-18 months. I went back to basics. Earlier, I focused too much on quality over quantity and did not spend enough time hitting balls. Now, I enjoy spending long hours in the nets,” Rahul added.Rahul’s purple patch extends across formats. He starred as India’s dependable No.5 during the 2023 ODI World Cup, amassing 452 runs, including India’s fastest World Cup ton — a 62-ball century against the Netherlands.Post-World Cup, he embraced the finisher’s role, delivering crucial runs during India’s ICC Champions Trophy triumph, where he averaged a staggering 140 in four innings.In the IPL too, Rahul rediscovered his aggressive best, scoring 539 runs at a strike rate of nearly 150, his best since 2018 while opening and batting in the top order for Delhi Capitals.After a stint as a middle-order bat, Rahul has returned to his preferred Test opening slot with renewed consistency. Since the Australia tour, he has scored 431 runs in five Tests at an average nearing 48, including this latest Leeds masterclass.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Despite a career Test average of 34.70, Rahul says he no longer lets statistics cloud his focus. “Of course, it hurts when I look at my average. But at this stage, I don’t want to think about numbers. I want to make an impact whenever I get a chance and enjoy playing Test cricket for India and it’s what I grew up loving,” he said.Looking ahead to the final day, Rahul expects a gripping contest as India defends a stiff target. “When the match started, it looked like a batting paradise and I thought it would be a draw. But now, there’s enough wear and tear and the cracks are opening up. It’s a perfect day-five wicket and it’s going to be a blockbuster,” he said.At stumps on day four, England were 21 for no loss, with Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett navigating six tricky overs without a hiccup. The pair added quick runs to keep the chase alive, leaving the hosts needing 350 more for what would be a record chase at Headingley.Earlier, India’s lower order once again faltered, collapsing from 349/6 to 364 all out in under five overs, with only Ravindra Jadeja and the tail adding quick runs at the end. The top five, however, were outstanding — racking up five centuries between them and scoring 721 of India’s total runs in the Test.With Pant’s twin centuries and Rahul’s controlled ton, India hold the advantage heading into what promises to be a riveting final day at Leeds.","KL Rahul scores his third Test hundred on English soil to put India firmly in control of the opening Test.

Poll Who do you think played a more crucial role in the partnership against England? KL Rahul Rishabh Pant

Greenstone Lobo predicts winner of IND vs ENG series | Who Has the Astrological Edge?

Early in their partnership, the stump mic picked up a heartwarming conversation between KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant where the former was urging his younger teammate to watch the ball closely. Pant heard him and responded, ""hanji... aise nahi hai aise hi ghuma du... ball acche se dekhta hu."" (yes, it's not that I swing wildly, I watch it nicely). From the outside, it may feel like a normal conversation between two batters looking to bail the side out of trouble after the early hiccup - Shubman Gill's wicket - but it meant much more. It felt much more.There is a six-year age gap between KL Rahul and Pant, and while it's not the ideal difference between siblings of an average Indian family, the camaraderie in the middle certainly felt like one. Without being authoritative, Rahul was putting the point across to Pant with an unsaid sense of assurance in his tone. The young batter was all ears and the ""hanji"" - hindi word for yes used while addressing someone senior to you - said and conveyed a lot more.This is an Indian dressing room undergoing transition and Rahul, as far as batting is concerned, is the only link between the past and the future. Since making his debut in 2014, the right-hander has played with the former greats, seen plenty come in and out of the side and is now witnessing the youngsters - who made their debuts in front of him - take the next step in their Test careers.Rahul, however, hasn't turned that guiding angel for the young batters overnight.It was visible during the numerous net sessions in Australia where he would guide Yashasvi Jaiswal, speak to him constantly and maintain the chatter even when the two opened the innings together. It was a much star-studded dressing room back then but things have changed now. He is the senior pro who has taken the responsibility of making the youngsters comfortable.And he was doing just that when Pant walked out to bat under an overcast sky, windy conditions and against a bowling attack which was asking a lot of questions in the first hour of day's play.Pant and Rahul together wasn't going to be similar music from both ends and it was a throwback to the 90s where the audio cassettes were dominated by 2-in-1 collections. One side would have music completely different from the other. Vengaboys on one side and a Yash Chopra classic on the other meant there was something for everyone.With their own means and ways, the two drove India into a position of control. Rahul continued to be patient, calm and left the ball as well as anyone has in this part of the world. Pant, meanwhile, entered a period of self-talking where he calmed himself to weather the early storm and then returned to maverick ways before making timely returns to sensibility.Rahul faced 143 deliveries during the partnership, Pant faced 140 and the two contributed 66 and 118 runs, respectively. The contributions, however, weren't of importance here but the manner in which they complimented each other, in spite of the different approaches, was. The elder brother in Rahul didn't miss an opportunity to walk up to his teammate when he would sense him getting edgy - which happened far too often.With Pant, every delivery becomes an event but Rahul, having played so much cricket with the explosive left-hander, timed his chats to perfection and didn't come across as the overbearing senior instructing from the other end. When he was leaving consecutive deliveries in the 90s, Rahul let him be. Even when he went big off Shoaib Bashir, Rahul let him be. And when the hundred finally came, the long warm hug showed how much it meant to Pant, and Rahul, as together the two batted India into a very good position in the opening Test against England.It was shortly after that Rahul got the chance to kiss the crest on his helmet but this partnership was more than about the individual tons. Many moons ago, the two had put on a show at The Oval in 2018 when they hit hundreds vs Joe Root & Co. but it came for a side littered with superstars, led by one of the modern day-greats, Virat Kohli.The superstars have now walked into the sunset, the greats have called it a day but Rahul, who has had a ringside view to the movements and transitions, has moved up the hierarchy. He opted for Tamil when Sai Sudharsan was in the middle, Hindi for Pant and switched to Kannada for Karun Nair. The language changed but the intention remained the same.The soft-spoken tattooed youngster is now the elder brother in a very young dressing room led by a 25-year-old captain.","KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant's partnership was more than individual tons. There is a six-year age gap between Rahul and Pant, and while it's not the ideal difference between siblings of an average Indian family, the camaraderie in the middle certainly felt like one. The elder brother in Rahul didn't miss an opportunity to walk up to his teammate when he would sense him getting edgy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122031878,imgsize-51814,width-400,resizemode-4/122031878.jpg"

'You just let Rishabh Pant be Rishabh Pant. Stand out there and admire.' KL Rahul ’s words summed up the essence of day four at Headingley, where the Indian duo of Rahul and Pant unleashed twin centuries to propel India to 364 all out in their second innings, setting England a steep 371-run target.By stumps, England openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett had reached 21 without loss. The series opener remains delicately poised with 350 more needed by the hosts and one full day to go.Pant, who made 134 in the first innings, completed his second century of the match with a thrilling 118 off 140 balls - becoming the first Indian to hit twin tons in a Test against England and only the second wicketkeeper in history to achieve the feat.KL Rahul, anchoring the innings with a composed 137 off 247 balls, was at his vintage best. “Was happy with the way I was batting in Australia… Unfortunately couldn’t get big runs. I learnt there that once I get starts, I’ll convert into big ones,” he said after the day’s play.On his ever-evolving role in the batting order, he admitted: “Last couple of years I have forgotten what position I am comfortable in. I am ready for whatever has been given to me.I have enjoyed my role as an opener the last couple of series.”Rahul also spoke about helping younger players adjust to English conditions. “Everyone wants to learn, get better at their game. Whoever has come and spoken to me, we’ve had lengthy conversations. It was something that used to happen earlier also.”Despite India losing their last six wickets for 31 runs, they had done enough damage. England pacer Josh Tongue, who triggered India’s late collapse, said: “It’s a shame I couldn’t get the hat-trick… but the dressing room is very positive. We have a very good batting order.”Day five promises fireworks - or a fight for survival.","KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant hit twin centuries to propel India to 364 all out in their second innings, setting England a steep 371-run target.

KL Rahul press conference: On his role, being elder brother in team, role clarity and match

England face a formidable challenge at Headingley, needing 371 runs to win the first Test against India. After conceding a big second-innings lead, England’s openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett ensured they finished Day 4 at 21 for no loss, keeping hopes alive for what would be a historic chase. With Headingley famous for some of Test cricket’s most dramatic fourth-innings run chases, all eyes are on whether England can script another thrilling finish.Headingley cricket ground in Leeds has witnessed some of cricket’s most memorable run chases in Test match history, with Australia’s pursuit of 404 runs against England in 1948 standing as the highest successful chase at this venue. The historic ground has hosted five remarkable fourth-innings victories, showcasing extraordinary batting performances and match-winning partnerships that have left an indelible mark on Test cricket.The highest successful run chase at Headingley came in 1948 when Australia, led by Don Bradman, achieved a target of 404 runs with seven wickets to spare. Bradman’s unbeaten 173 and Arthur Morris’s 182 formed a partnership of 301 runs that secured this historic victory for Australia.The second-highest chase occurred in 2019 when England successfully pursued 362 runs against Australia. Ben Stokes emerged as the hero with an unbeaten 135 off 219 balls, forming a crucial last-wicket partnership with Jack Leach, who contributed just one run to the cause.West Indies achieved the third-highest chase in 2017, successfully reaching a target of 322 runs with five wickets remaining. Shai Hope’s twin centuries and Kraigg Brathwaite’s significant contribution helped the West Indies secure a memorable victory on English soil.The fourth spot belongs to England’s chase of 315 against Australia in 2001. Mark Butcher’s outstanding innings of 173 runs from 227 deliveries guided England to victory despite a shaky start at 33 for 2.The fifth-highest successful chase at Headingley was completed by England against New Zealand in 2022, when they reached the target of 296 with seven wickets in hand. Joe Root and Ollie Pope’s partnership of 134 runs off 168 balls proved crucial after England lost both openers with only 51 runs on the board.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? These successful chases at Headingley have featured remarkable individual performances. Don Bradman’s unbeaten 173 in 1948, Ben Stokes’ 135 not out in 2019, and Mark Butcher’s 173 in 2001 stand as some of the finest fourth-innings batting displays at this ground.The venue has particularly been favourable for England, who feature in four of the five highest successful chases. Three of these victories came against their traditional rivals Australia, while the other was against New Zealand.The success rate of teams batting fourth at Headingley demonstrates the ground’s potential for producing exciting finishes. The pitch characteristics and conditions have often allowed batting teams to successfully chase substantial targets.These historic chases have often involved significant partnerships. The 301-run partnership between Bradman and Morris in 1948, the last-wicket stand between Stokes and Leach in 2019, and the Root-Pope partnership in 2022 exemplify how crucial partnerships have been in successful pursuits at this venue.Each of these five chases has contributed to Headingley’s reputation as a ground capable of producing dramatic Test matches with successful fourth-innings pursuits. With a 371-run target now set, England’s current team has a chance to add its name to this famous list — but it will take something truly special to do so.","England face a formidable challenge at Headingley, needing 371 runs to win the first Test against India.

Greenstone Lobo predicts winner of IND vs ENG series | Who Has the Astrological Edge?

NEW DELHI: Sunil Gavaskar and Rishabh Pant continued to deliver viral social media moments on Day 4 of the first Test of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy at Headingley on Monday. Pant, the dynamic left-hander, followed up his brilliant 134 in the first innings with a superb 118 in the second, becoming the first wicketkeeper-batter to score a century in both innings of a Test match.He also became the first Indian to achieve this rare feat in England.Pant’s iconic somersault celebration had already gone viral following his first-innings century. However, he chose not to repeat the flip after reaching his eighth Test ton in the second innings.As the cameras shifted to the stands, Sunil Gavaskar was seen gesturing to Pant, urging him to perform the somersault once more. In response, Pant signalled, ""some other time.""The light-hearted exchange added another chapter to the growing on-field chemistry between Gavaskar and Pant. During the 2024–25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Gavaskar had famously criticised Pant’s dismissal as “Stupid. Stupid. Stupid,” only to later praise his Headingley hundred as “Superb. Superb. Superb.”Pant walked in after Indian captain Shubman Gill was dismissed in the very first over of the day by Brydon Carse.The 27-year-old began in typically aggressive and unorthodox fashion, but quickly adapted to the challenging conditions.He played cautiously before lunch, scoring 31 off 59 balls, and then launched a calculated counterattack, particularly targeting spinner Shoaib Bashir. Pant brought up his century in 130 deliveries and was eventually dismissed for 118 by Joe Root.Former India wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta praised Pant's temperament and adaptability, comparing him to India’s resilient former batter, Cheteshwar Pujara.“The first phase of Pant’s innings was entertaining — he was trying to use the strong wind in his favour, playing those big shots. But he wasn’t quite convincing in the way he did it. Then he decided to switch gears completely. And, this is the beauty of Pant — his cricketing mind is sharp. He abandoned the aggressive shots, went all-out defense, and did not play a single aerial shot after that.“It reminded me of how versatile he is. This is the same guy who, early in his Test career, once got a 29-ball duck. He can bat like Pujara for an hour or two. We’ve seen him play at a strike rate of 30 for over an hour during hundreds that he has scored. It was fascinating to see the contrast — two very different versions of Rishabh Pant in one session,” said Deep on Jio Hotstar’s Match Centre Live.","Rishabh Pant becomes first wicketkeeper-batter to score a century in both innings of a Test match.

Young Indian talents Tilak Varma and Ishan Kishan made strong statements in red-ball cricket with impressive performances on their County Championship debuts in England.Playing for Hampshire in Division One, Tilak walked in when his team was under pressure at 34 for 2 against Essex in Chelmsford. The 22-year-old displayed remarkable composure and patience, finishing unbeaten on 98 from 234 deliveries. His innings included 11 fours and three sixes, showing his ability to adapt to the longer format. He also chipped in with two tidy overs of spin, conceding just six runs.Tilak, speaking to a local BBC station after stumps, said,The young batter’s calm and gritty knock under pressure shows he is eager to prove himself in the longer format too.Ishan Kishan, meanwhile, turned heads with an attacking knock for Nottinghamshire against Yorkshire. The left-handed wicketkeeper-batter struck 87 off 98 balls, laced with 12 fours and a six. Only Ben Slater, who made 96, scored more for Nottinghamshire. Kishan, signed for a short two-match stint, also made an impact behind the stumps by taking a sharp catch to dismiss opener Adam Lyth off Mohammad Abbas.Among other notable names, Jofra Archer made his long-awaited red-ball return for Sussex against Durham. The England pacer, playing his first First-Class match in four years, bowled 14 overs with six maidens and conceded just 28 runs while picking up a wicket.

Jasprit Bumrah press conference: Lashes out at critics, dropped catches and no balls

Poll Do you agree with Michael Atherton's criticism of Ben Stokes' defensive tactics? Yes, I think Stokes was too defensive. No, I believe it was a strategic choice.

England’s approach on Day 4 of the first Test at Headingley has come under sharp criticism from former skipper Michael Atherton , who questioned Ben Stokes ’ defensive tactics against India’s KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant. The duo’s commanding 195-run partnership turned the game firmly in India’s favour and left England’s bowlers searching for answers.Rahul’s measured 137 off 347 deliveries combined with Pant’s counterattacking 118 off just 140 balls piled on the pressure. Despite the conditions and Headingley’s reputation for slip catches, Stokes opted to remove catchers behind the wicket during a crucial phase - a move Atherton found baffling.“England's tactics were unusual at the start of the second session as Stokes went quite defensive, and there were no slips in place. The vast majority of wickets at Headingley come in the slips, and there weren't any when Pant edged two. India pressed the accelerator after that and put the hammer down,” Atherton said on Sky Sports.Rahul’s technical discipline and Pant’s fearless strokeplay enthralled the Headingley crowd and left England’s inexperienced attack exposed.Former India coach Ravi Shastri lauded the pair’s contrasting brilliance but admitted Pant’s relentless charge gave India an unusual problem — when to declare.“Pant has taken the game forward. He has given India a headache in terms of when should they declare and how many runs do they get. There is plenty of food for thought, but India will be very happy after a technical masterpiece from Rahul and the flamboyance and exuberance that you can't imagine from Pant,” Shastri remarked.Pant’s smashing innings was ended Shoaib Bashir, who tempted him into a miscue and was caught by Zak Crawley. Rahul followed soon after, bowled off an inside edge while attempting to cut a ball that bounced extra.","Michael Atherton questioned Ben Stokes' defensive tactics against India's KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant.

England pacer Jofra Archer marked a significant milestone in his comeback journey on Monday, stepping back onto the first-class stage for Sussex in their County Championship clash against Durham at Chester-le-Street. This appearance could pave the way for Archer’s much-anticipated return to England’s Test side, with the second Test against India set to commence on July 2.It’s been a challenging road for the 30-year-old pacer, whose last Test appearance came over four years ago — against India in Ahmedabad in 2021. Since then, elbow injuries, two surgeries, and a stress fracture in his lower back in 2022 had threatened to derail a promising career that once made him England’s spearhead across formats.But on his red-ball return, Archer wasted little time reminding everyone of his impact. In his very first outing back, he snapped up the wicket of Emilio Gay with a trademark sharp delivery that trapped the Durham batter lbw. This marked his first wicket in red-ball cricket after an absence of 1,501 days.England Test skipper Ben Stokes recently confirmed that Archer has been in regular contact with the national camp, eager to don the whites again.

Yildiz stars for Juventus

Manchester City hit Al Ain for six on Sunday to secure a place in the last 16 of the Club World Cup after Real Madrid shrugged off an early red card to beat Mexican side Pachuca 3-1.Juventus proved too strong for Wydad Casablanca while Red Bull Salzburg and Al Hilal drew 0-0 as the second round of group games at the tournament came to a conclusion.The match between City and Al Ain in Atlanta was dubbed the ""Abu derby"", with the English club's owner and United Arab Emirates vice-president Sheikh Mansour facing off against his elder sibling, Sheikh Mohamed, president of the Emirati team and also the country.Ilkay Gundogan put City ahead early on before 19-year-old Claudio Echeverri netted his first goal for the club with a free-kick and Erland Haaland slotted in the third with a penalty in first-half stoppage time.In the second half, Gundogan struck again before two substitutes joined in, with Oscar Bobb rolling in the fifth and Rayan Cherki grabbing his first City goal for 6-0.The result, in a game watched by a crowd of over 40,000, means both City and Juventus are through to the knockout phase after each winning their first two matches in Group G.hey will now face each other in Orlando on Thursday to decide who tops the section.""Now we have to see whether we'll be first or second in the group,"" said City coach Pep Guardiola, who changed his entire starting line-up following the 2-0 opening win against Wydad.""We played a little bit better than the first game, especially in the second half.""Juventus triumphed 4-1 against Moroccan giants Wydad in Philadelphia, as Kenan Yildiz played a starring role.The Turkish international forward scored twice after forcing the early own goal which put Juve ahead in front of almost 32,000 at Lincoln Financial Field.His shot found the net with the aid of a slight but crucial deflection off Abdelmounaim Boutouil, and Yildiz then smashed in the second on 16 minutes with a brilliant half-volley.South African winger Thembinkosi Lorch pulled one back for Wydad, but the impressive Yildiz made it 3-1 midway through the second half and Dusan Vlahovic converted a penalty in injury time to seal the win for Igor Tudor's side.""He has great potential,"" Tudor told broadcaster DAZN when asked about Yildiz. ""A wonderful player, so there is a big future in front of him.""In Charlotte, Real Madrid overcame the early sending-off of Raul Asencio to beat Pachuca and get their first win under new coach Xabi Alonso.Defender Asencio was dismissed after just seven minutes for pulling down Salomon Rondon with the Venezuelan clear on goal.That left the Liga MX team sensing the chance for an upset in front of 70,248 fans at the home of the NFL's Carolina Panthers.However, Real took the lead on 35 minutes when Jude Bellingham buried a left-foot shot into the bottom corner, and they scored again before the interval through Arda Guler.Fede Valverde got their third in the second half, with a deflected Elias Montiel effort pulling one back for Pachuca.Alonso praised the way his team handled the early sending-off.""It became really intense for us, but we defended with a lot of sacrifice and solidarity, which is what it takes,"" he said.Alonso also said that Real defender Antonio Rudiger had complained of a racist incident at the end of the game when the German was visibly angered following an exchange of words with Pachuca's Gustavo Cabral.""I think the FIFA protocol has been activated to investigate, but if it has happened, all measures should be taken and we support Antonio because it's something unacceptable,"" said the coach.Cabral, the 39-year-old Argentinian centre-back, denied the accusations, saying his words had been misinterpreted.Real are level at the top of Group H on four points with Salzburg, who drew 0-0 with Al Hilal in Washington, DC.Madrid and Salzburg meet each other next in Philadelphia, while Al Hilal have two points and can still qualify with a win when they play Pachuca, who are now out.",Manchester City beat Al Ain 6-0 in the FIFA Club World Cup.
