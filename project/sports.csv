GUWAHATI: Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ) are facing a tricky situation regarding MS Dhoni ’s batting position. Having drawn a lot of criticism for coming in to bat at No. 9 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru last week, Dhoni came in to bat at No.7 on Sunday against Rajasthan Royals.His team needed 54 off 25 balls at that point, but Dhoni couldn’t take this team over the line. When he departed after scoring 16 off 11 balls (1x4, 1x6) — Shimron Hetmyer taking a superb catch at deep mid-wicket — CSK still needed 19 off the last five legal deliveries from Sandeep Sharma. They failed to go the distance and lost by six runs.Asked to explain Dhoni’s flickering appearances with the bat and his changing batting positions, CSK head coach Stephen Fleming said, “It’s a time thing. It’s MS who judges it. His body, his knees aren’t what they used to be. He’s moving okay but there’s still an attrition aspect to it. He can’t bat 10 overs running full stick. So, he will gauge on the day what he can give us.“If the game is in the balance, he’ll go a little bit earlier and he backs other players when opportunities are up. So he’s balancing that. I said it last year, he is too valuable to us for leadership and wicketkeeping. To throw him in at 9, 10 overs... he’s actually never done that. So, from around 13, 14 overs he’s looking to go depending on the situation,” the former New Zealand captain said.Analysing their second straight loss this season after the opening win against Mumbai Indians, Fleming said, “It’s probably the two Powerplays. Our Powerplay with the ball went for best part of 80 runs and we were only able to manage mid-40s or early-40s. That’s the big difference.""We were also sloppy in the field compared to Rajasthan, who were outstanding. The start of a new three-year cycle (following a mega IPL auction) is always a little bit difficult, especially if you’re just short of a little bit of form.”","MS Dhoni came in to bat at No.7 against Rajasthan Royals on Sunday.

Theare gearing up for a postseason push, but front-office decisions loom large in the upcoming free agency. One name that stands out as a potential target is Atlanta Hawks center, who could address the team’s glaring need for interior depth and defense.The Los Angeles Lakers have struggled with consistency at the center position this season. The Lakers’ blockbuster trade for Luka Doncic has propelled them to the No. 4 seed in the Western Conference.

NHL fans rip into Brady Tkachuk after heated exchange with Blue Jackets

Brady Tkachuk , captain of the Ottawa Senators , is known for his aggressive and physical style of play. During a recent game against the Columbus Blue Jackets , his on-ice actions sparked backlash from fans, with some even calling him reckless and questioning his leadership. Some labeled him one of the worst captains, arguing that his aggression hurts the team.During the first period, Ottawa Senators captain Brady Tkachuk delivered a late shove to Columbus Blue Jackets forward Sean Monahan after he had already moved the puck. This aggressive move led Blue Jackets winger Kirill Marchenko to step in and confront Tkachuk in defense of his teammate. As a result, Tkachuk was assessed a roughing penalty.The incident sparked backlash on social media, with many NHL fans criticizing Brady Tkachuk’s actions. One tweeted saying, “Worst captain in sports.” Another one wrote, “Biggest fake tough guy in the league.” ""The fact he is even in this game is kinda crazy after he elbowed the guys head into the ice last game,"" one wrote. ""Crazy choice of caption from an organization full of TML fluffers. Guy gets grabbed by some no name basically wearing a bubble and ends up with the only penalty, brutal call,"" another wrote.""How Brady got a penalty is hilarious, and honestly I’m not surprised by the comments.. sportnet followers are as trashy as their panel,"" a user commented. ""So Brady gets jumped by a chickenshit with a full face shield and HE is the only player penalized? Make that make sense,"" another wrote.Tkachuk has always been a polarizing figure—while Senators fans appreciate his passion and leadership, others see his physicality as excessive. This isn't the first time he's drawn criticism for his rough play, as he often engages in fights and racks up penalty minutes.Despite the backlash, the Senators' management and coaching staff continue to support Tkachuk. General Manager Steve Staios and head coach D.J. Smith have praised his competitive nature, emphasizing that his emotional engagement is a key part of the team's identity. They believe his energy helps elevate the team, even if it occasionally leads to controversy.The Senators secured a 3-2 win over the Blue Jackets with goals from Ridly Greig, Drake Batherson, and Jake Sanderson. Boone Jenner and Kirill Marchenko scored for Columbus. Linus Ullmark made 29 saves for Ottawa, while Daniil Tarasov stopped 24 shots in the loss. Greig opened the scoring, but Jenner quickly equalized. Batherson and Sanderson extended Ottawa’s lead before Marchenko cut it to 3-2 in the third. Despite the late push, Columbus couldn't complete the comeback. Coach Travis Green praised the team's energy and effort, calling it a playoff-like game.Also Read: Miro Heiskanen injury update: Stars head coach reveals that he is making steady progress in recovery as the team prepare for playoffs While some fans criticize his leadership, others argue that his physicality and grit are exactly what the Senators need.

Michael Wilbon calls out ESPN’s priorities

ESPN under fire: Channing Frye, Charles Barkley, and Michael Wilbon criticize network’s shallow coverage of NBA

ESPN has come under fire for its relentless focus on Bronny James, and one of its own, veteran journalist Michael Wilbon , isn’t holding back. Wilbon, the longtime co-host of Pardon the Interruption, recently criticized the network for what he sees as an excessive push to make Bronny a daily topic. Speaking in an interview with Outkick, he revealed that ESPN executives attempted to get him and his co-host Tony Kornheiser to frequently discuss Bronny on their show—something they refused to do.During the interview, Michael Wilbon was candid about the pressure from higher-ups at ESPN to cover Bronny James extensively, even at the expense of more deserving basketball stories. He expressed frustration over the way the network prioritizes narratives that generate buzz over meaningful discussions about the game.""There were shows that talked about Bronny every day,"" Wilbon said. ""You know what shows I'm talking about. I don't care if my bosses get mad. They would try to get Tony and me to talk about it. No, we were not going to do it.""He acknowledged that as a father, he understands why LeBron James is so invested in his son’s career. However, he took issue with ESPN seemingly placing Bronny’s name above legitimate stars in the NBA.""They talked about him more than Shai Gilgeous-Alexander ,"" Wilbon added. ""That's pandering. It's all pandering. Let me be clear: our business is a piece of sh*t a lot of days.""Wilbon explained that Pardon the Interruption only covered Bronny when it was truly newsworthy—such as when he was drafted by the Lakers and when he played alongside his father on opening night. In contrast, he noted that other ESPN shows, particularly First Take, seemed to include Bronny in daily debates, overshadowing actual basketball discussions. Many fans have also voiced frustration, questioning whether ESPN's obsession with Bronny is truly about basketball or just a ratings ploy.Wilbon is not alone in his criticism. Former NBA player and analyst Channing Frye also recently called out ESPN after Stephen A. Smith falsely claimed that LeBron James did not attend Kobe Bryant ’s memorial. Frye took to social media to demand more accountability from the network.""Please don't lie. Please don't make sh*t up. Fact-check yourself,"" Frye posted. ""The beef is not fun when you've run out of things to talk about. Just don't lie to try and win an argument.""Meanwhile, NBA Hall of Famer Charles Barkley has been vocal about what he sees as ESPN’s repetitive and shallow coverage. While speaking on Inside the NBA, Barkley mocked ESPN’s fixation on teams like the Lakers and the Warriors, arguing that it dilutes real basketball conversations.""Them fools at the other network, which we're going to be working at next year, that's all they talk about,"" Barkley said. ""Y'all just want to talk about the Warriors and the Lakers... Y'all are idiots cause y'all talk about the Lakers and the Warriors all the time.""Wilbon’s remarks came at a time when First Take continued its back-and-forth with LeBron James, a feud that has dominated headlines. However, Wilbon emphasized that this issue is bigger than one individual or one show—it’s a reflection of the entire sports media landscape.""This isn't about Stephen A. It's the entire industry,"" Wilbon stated. ""That's what I want to remind LeBron. Our business is just sh*t some days. It just is.""As voices like Wilbon, Barkley, and Frye call for a shift in the way sports are covered, the future of sports journalism remains uncertain. The industry is at a crossroads, where it must decide whether to prioritize thoughtful, in-depth coverage or continue chasing sensational stories for ratings.Also Read: LeBron James opens up about the real reason behind his feud with Stephen A. Smith: “He’s on a Taylor Swift tour run” With the debate intensifying, it remains unclear whether calls for journalistic integrity will reshape the landscape or if viral content will continue to dominate.

NEW DELHI: Jasprit Bumrah ’s return to competitive cricket may take a little longer. It is understood that he is yet to bowl full tilt at the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence (CoE). Pacer Akash Deep’s comeback, too, has been pushed back by at least a week.TOI has learnt that Bumrah is clinically fit, but his workload is being increased gradually since he is at risk of suffering a stress fracture of the back. Even Akash Deep is nursing a back injury. Both pacers have not played any competitive cricket since the tour of Australia. While Bumrah suffered a lower back injury during the middle of the Syndey Test in the first week of January, Akash Deep couldn’t make it to the XI after developing some “discomfort”.The BCCI medical team has decided to tread very cautiously with Bumrah, given India are slated to play five Tests in England immediately after the IPL . As it is, the national selectors and the team management are not banking on Bumrah to play all five Tests.“Bumrah’s injury is a bit more serious. The medical team wants to ensure he doesn’t suffer a stress fracture. Bumrah himself is being careful. He is bowling at the CoE but it could take longer to get back in full swing. No definite timeline has been set yet, but one hopes he gets back by mid-April. Akash Deep too hopes to get back by April 10,” a BCCI source said.Bumrah was initially expected to join Mumbai Indians by April 1.Meanwhile, Lucknow Super Giants pacer Mayank Yadav is also on the same timeline as Akash Deep and Bumrah. According to the refreshed standard operating procedure, the bowling coach at the CoE will have to give the final clearance. While the medical team decides if the player if fit enough to endure the rigours of high-performance sport, the bowling coach must decide if he is ready to go once he leaves the CoE.","Jasprit Bumrah is yet to bowl full tilt at the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence (CoE) Pacer Akash Deep's comeback, too, has been pushed back by at least a week.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

IPL | Punjab Kings' Suryansh Shedge: From playing under Shreyas to dreaming of meeting Kohli

Punjab Kings secured an impressive eight-wicket victory over Lucknow Super Giants , with Prabhsimran Singh's explosive 69 and captain Shreyas Iyer 's unbeaten 52 leading the chase. The win was followed by a cheeky social media post from Punjab Kings, seemingly responding to LSG captain Rishabh Pant 's pre-season comments about the auction.The social media post showed Iyer striking various poses after the win, accompanied by the caption ""Tension toh auction me hi khatm ho gayi thi"" (Tension ended in the auction).Before the season began, Pant had expressed his thoughts about the auction in an interview with Star Sports: ""I only had one tension, that was Punjab (laughs). They had the highest purse. When Shreyas went to Punjab, I felt I could make it to LSG. There was a possibility. But eventually, with auction you never know, so I just thought I would wait and watch, and had my fingers crossed,"" he had said in the video that went viral after the match on Tuesday.At the Ekana Cricket Stadium, Punjab Kings successfully chased down the 172-run target in just 16.2 overs. Prabhsimran Singh dominated the early proceedings with his 34-ball 69, which included nine fours and three sixes.Shreyas Iyer provided stability at the end with an unbeaten 52 off 30 balls, ensuring a comfortable victory for his team.Lucknow Super Giants had a difficult start, losing three wickets during the powerplay and managing only 39 runs. Arshdeep Singh was particularly effective, taking three wickets for 43 runs, including the crucial dismissal of Mitchell Marsh for a duck in the first over.The LSG innings saw further setbacks with Aiden Markram falling to Lockie Ferguson, and Rishabh Pant managing just two runs before being dismissed by Glenn Maxwell.Nicholas Pooran (44 off 30) and Ayush Badoni (41 off 33) attempted to stabilise the innings for LSG. Abdul Samad's quick 27 off 12 balls helped push the final total to 171.LSG's bowling attack struggled without Mayank Yadav, who is currently sidelined. Their lead spinner Ravi Bishnoi's poor form continued, while Shardul Thakur and Avesh Khan failed to make an impact.Prabhsimran Singh took advantage of the weakened bowling attack, particularly targeting the pace bowlers during his aggressive innings.","Punjab Kings secured an impressive eight-wicket victory over Lucknow Super Giants.

BENGALURU: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), perennial slow starters and a side that has too often flattered only to fizzle when it matters, have been a revelation in this Indian Premier League (IPL) so far. As beginnings go, theirs has been pristinely new.Under new captain Rajat Patidar, they have begun impeccably, notching up big wins against Kolkata Knight Riders and Chennai Super Kings. They now have a more balanced side with a competent bowling attack — a bugbear in previous years — complementing a confident batting unit.RCB play the first of their home matches against Gujarat Titans at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Wednesday and, given how often they have let down fans, it’s hard not to conjure up the fate that befell their women’s team recently. After a sizzling start in the Women’s Premier League, the defending champions led by Smriti Mandhana lost four consecutive matches at home and crashed out in the league phase.Although the men don’t play that many home matches on the trot, they will have to tread carefully at their home ground, a known batting paradise given its small boundaries.One of their biggest assets is the new-ball bowling pair of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Josh Hazlewood, old warhorses intimately familiar with conditions in Bengaluru. The city holds a special place for Bhuvneshwar, who cut his teeth in T20 international cricket at this venue against Pakistan in 2012.Hazlewood has been immaculate in the two games so far in the 18th edition of the IPL, a luxury that has helped Patidar channel his bowling options around the veteran Australian. Apart from the seasoned pacers, RCB have the option of playing either Yash Dayal (most likely) or Rasikh Salam. RCB’s all-rounders Krunal Pandya, Liam Livingstone and Suyash Sharma for the crux of their spin department.RCB’s batting lies in its top-order led by the red-hot Phil Salt and Virat Kohli, who is still warming up to the league. With in-form skipper Patidar offering stability, Devdutt Padikkal, Jitesh Sharma and Tim David lend depth to the line-up which will be a worry for any opposition.The Titans, on the other hand, have had a mixed start to their campaign. After a heartbreaking 11-run loss to Punjab Kings in the opener, they recovered to outplay Mumbai Indians by 36 runs in Ahmedabad over the weekend.Helmed by the ‘prince’ of Indian cricket, Shubman Gill, the Titans have a potent batting line-up which includes Sai Sudharsan, Gill, Jos Buttler, Shahrukh Khan, Rahul Tewatia and Sherfane Rutherford. If the RCB bowlers are to have an off-day, Titans have enough ammunition to light up the compact stadium.At the Chinnaswamy, RCB will be wary of the Titans’ bowling attack. Mohammed Siraj has spent the better part of his IPL career at the venue before the Bengaluru outfit let go off him before the mega auction. Then, there is the expertise of home boy Prasidh Krishna and the experience of Ishant Sharma to go with the class of Kagiso Rabada. With Rashid Khan and Sai Kishore also in the frame, the Titans have a better spin attack compared to the hosts.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) have been a revelation in this Indian Premier League (IPL) so far.

Kumar’s sensational 4 for 24 helped MI bundle out KKR for just 116 in 16.2 overs — the lowest total in this IPL season.The 23-year-old from a town called Jhanjeri, near Chandigarh, became the first Indian to take four wickets on an IPL debut, etching his name in the history books. He joins an elite list of bowlers with standout performances on their first IPL outing, including Alzarri Joseph (6/12) and Andrew Tye (5/17).Also See: MI vs KKR Live Ashwani struck with his very first ball in the IPL, dismissing KKR captain Ajinkya Rahane. His spell, complemented by Deepak Chahar’s 2 for 19, dismantled KKR’s batting lineup, with Angkrish Raghuvanshi top-scoring for them with 26 off 16 balls.Reflecting on his debut, an elated Ashwani said, “I felt very good, there was pressure but the team environment helped me to settle down. I didn’t have lunch today, I only ate a banana, there was some pressure so I didn’t feel hungry. The captain, Hardik bhai, told me to bowl it into the wicket and back my skills. Everyone back in my village will be watching me play, and I’m very happy.”With just four senior T20 matches, two Ranji Trophy, and four List A games under his belt before this, Ashwani’s impact on debut signals a bright future ahead for the young pacer and Mumbai Indians.",Ashwani Kumar becomes first Indian to take four wickets on an IPL debut.

LSG vs PBKS IPL 2025, Lucknow weather prediction

The Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) will seek their first home victory of the season when they face Punjab Kings (PBKS) at the Ekana International Stadium in Lucknow today (April 1).Captain Rishabh Pant aims to make an impact after LSG narrowly lost their season opener to Delhi Capitals by one wicket in Vizag. However, they rebounded strongly with a five-wicket win over Sunrisers Hyderabad, driven by standout performances from Nicholas Pooran (70 runs), Mitchell Marsh (55 runs), and Shardul Thakur (4/34), who excelled with the ball.LSG's top order has been firing, with Marsh and Pooran laying a solid foundation. Aiden Markram, like Pant, had a disappointing performance and will be eager to improve.Pant, the most expensive player in the IPL auction last year at Rs 27 crore, is under pressure after a lacklustre showing in the first two matches. A strong performance at home would certainly help alleviate some of that burden.Abdul Samad also shone against SRH, scoring 22 runs off just eight balls, while Shardul Thakur, who stepped in for Mohsin Khan, has performed well with the ball. LSG has chosen to field three spinners on the slow Ekana pitch, with hopes resting on Ravi Bishnoi.For Punjab, seasoned leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal will lead the spin attack, and Glenn Maxwell is also expected to contribute with the ball. This match features an intriguing matchup between the most expensive and second-most expensive players in IPL history.In contrast to Pant’s struggles, Shreyas Iyer , purchased for Rs 26.75 crore, shone by scoring a match-winning 97 not out off 42 balls against the Gujarat Titans. The IPL-winning captain enjoys his role at No. 3, enhancing Punjab's batting strength.Don't expect a high-scoring affair when LSG meet PBKS at the Ekana Cricket Stadium . As one of India’s larger grounds it could give some respite to the bowlers. Records suggests plenty of support for the spinners and an even show of bat and ball. The slow surface will favour the spinners. Batters will have to rotate strike regularly and bank on powerplay for the big runs.Punjab Kings: Prabhsimran Singh (w), Priyansh Arya, Shreyas Iyer (c), Shashank Singh, Marcus Stoinis, Glenn Maxwell, Suryansh Shedge, Azmatullah Omarzai, Marco Jansen, Arshdeep Singh, Yuzvendra ChahalImpact Sub: Vijaykumar VyshakLucknow Super Giants: Mitchell Marsh, Aiden Markram, Nicholas Pooran, Rishabh Pant(w/c), Ayush Badoni, David Miller, Shahbaz Ahmed, Shardul Thakur, Ravi Bishnoi, Avesh Khan, Prince YadavImpact Sub: Digvesh RathiPunjab Kings squad: Priyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh(w), Shreyas Iyer(c), Azmatullah Omarzai, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Shashank Singh, Suryansh Shedge, Marco Jansen, Arshdeep Singh, Yuzvendra Chahal, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Nehal Wadhera, Praveen Dubey, Harpreet Brar, Vishnu Vinod, Yash Thakur, Aaron Hardie, Kuldeep Sen, Harnoor Singh, Musheer Khan, Pyla Avinash, Xavier Bartlett, Lockie Ferguson, Josh Inglis.Lucknow Super Giants squad: Aiden Markram, Nicholas Pooran, Rishabh Pant(w/c), Ayush Badoni, David Miller, Abdul Samad, Shardul Thakur, Ravi Bishnoi, Avesh Khan, Digvesh Singh Rathi, Prince Yadav, Mitchell Marsh, Manimaran Siddharth, Himmat Singh, Akash Maharaj Singh, Shahbaz Ahmed, Matthew Breetzke, Aryan Juyal, RS Hangargekar, Yuvraj Chaudhary, Akash Deep, Mayank Yadav, Shamar Joseph, Arshin Kulkarni.LSG and PBKS have squared off only four times in the IPL. LSG have won three of them while PBKS have come out victorious once. Last year's clash was won by LSG by 21 runs. PBKS' solitary triumph had come in the 2023 season.Lucknow is expected to be warm and dry during the match between LSG and PBKS with temperatures in and around 30 degrees Celsius.

His 36-ball 81 propelled RR to a formidable total, which they successfully defended to register their first win of the IPL 2025 season.Following the match, Rana disclosed that he had been unwell and had missed practice.

He emphasised that high-pressure situations are part of the IPL, and he was eager to contribute to RR's success.""High pressure is there in all 14 games since this is the number one league in the world. And as a batsman, as a player, that pressure is always there whether you are coming after a win or a loss. Those two points were very important.

LUCKNOW: Punjab Kings (PBKS) stunned Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) on their home turf here as skipper Shreyas Iyer and Prabhsimran scored brilliant half-centuries to secure an emphatic eight-wicket win with 22 balls to spare for the team coached by Ricky Ponting.The tone was set by the Punjab bowlers early on as they put up a superb show — led by left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh — to restrict Lucknow Super Giants to 171/7 at the Ekana stadium on Tuesday. It was a sub-par total on the track and though Punjab stuttered early in the chase, losing Priyansh Arya cheaply, Shreyas Iyer joined hands with Prabhsimran to ease the team’s nerves.Punjab scored 62/1 in the six overs of powerplay. Prabhsimran (69 off 34 balls; 9x4, 3x6) played a brilliant knock, getting to his fifty off just 23 balls. Shreyas and Prabhsimran powered their way to an 84-run stand off 44 balls for the second wicket to virtually seal the outcome.Prabhsimran, though, was out to a brilliant catch from Bishnoi at deep mid-wicket, leaving Shreyas to finish things off with a superb, unbeaten 52 (30b; 3x4, 4x6). Nehal Wadhera also played a good knock, a 25-ball 43, to get Punjab their second win in as many matches.Shreyas sent Abdul Samad soaring over deep mid-wicket to bring up both the victory and his half-century.For Lucknow, skipper Rishabh Pant again failed to contribute with the bat, falling for just 2. Punjab seized the initiative early as LSG’s top order collapsed, with Mitchell Marsh, Aiden Markram and skipper Pant departing in quick succession. Pant, in particular, is having a nightmare start to the season, scoring just 17 runs in three matches.Marsh, following two successive half-centuries, departed for a golden duck, undone by some extra bounce from Arshdeep Singh and managing only a leading edge. Markram got going and even had a 31-run partnership off 19 balls with Nicholas Pooran before he fell inside-edging a Lockie Ferguson delivery onto his stumps.Pant’s dismissal was the most disappointing, the LSG skipper falling to a half-tracker from Maxwell. Only Ayush Badoni (41 off 33b, 1x4, 3x6) and Nicholas Pooran (44 off 30) made noteworthy contributions in Lucknow's chase, but it wasn’t enough in the end.The outcome puts Pant and his team under even more pressure, while Punjab will be delighted to have begun the long season on a bright note.“To be honest, there’s no right combination. It’s just that the camaraderie and synergy has to click at the right time. You just need to have a similar kind of mindset,” Shreyas, whose captaincy has been impressive, said.Pant, meanwhile, said, “It was not enough, we were 20-25 runs short. You cannot control each and every thing.”",Punjab Kings (PBKS) stunned Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) Shreyas Iyer and Prabhsimran scored brilliant half-centuries to secure an emphatic eight-wicket win with 22 balls to spare.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119892526,imgsize-67070,width-400,resizemode-4/119892526.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings secured their second consecutive victory in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025, defeating the Lucknow Super Giants by eight wickets on Tuesday.Captain Shreyas Iyer continued his impressive form, notching his second consecutive half-century and leading Punjab to a comfortable win with 22 balls remaining.Sent to bat first, Lucknow struggled to establish a strong foundation, losing early wickets and reaching a final total of 171/7 in their allotted 20 overs. Punjab's bowling attack, spearheaded by Arshdeep Singh 's impressive figures of 3/43, effectively restricted Lucknow's scoring opportunities.Despite losing Mitchell Marsh for a golden duck and captain Rishabh Pant for a meager two runs, Lucknow found some stability through a 31-run partnership between Aiden Markram (28) and Nicholas Pooran (44).However, it was the partnership between Pooran and Ayush Badoni (41) that truly resurrected the innings.Late cameos from David Miller (19) and Abdul Samad (27) helped Lucknow surpass the 150-run mark.Punjab's chase got off to a flying start, courtesy of opener Prabhsimran Singh's blistering 69 off 34 balls. Singh and Iyer combined for a dominant 84-run partnership in just 44 balls, effectively dismantling Lucknow's bowling attack.Although Singh fell to wrist spinner Digvesh Rathi (2/30) in the 11th over, the damage had been done.Iyer continued his aggressive approach, reaching his half-century off just 30 balls, smashing three fours and four sixes in the process.Impact player Nehal Wadhera provided the finishing touches, smashing an unbeaten 43 off 25 balls, including four sixes. Together, Iyer and Wadhera forged an unbeaten 67-run partnership off just 37 balls, sealing a comprehensive victory for Punjab.This win propels Punjab Kings to second place in the points table, trailing only the Royal Challengers Bengaluru on net run rate.Lucknow Super Giants, on the other hand, find themselves in sixth place after this defeat.
