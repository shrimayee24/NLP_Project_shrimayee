'We are in Paris to give India its 9th Olympic hockey gold': Captain Harmanpreet promises the nation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/we-are-in-paris-to-give-india-its-9th-olympic-hockey-gold-captain-harmanpreet-promises-the-nation/articleshow/112237660.cms,"Every time adrenaline gushes through Harmanpreet's forearms to send those drag-flicks whizzing past defenders and bring the opponent post crashing down in Paris, mind goes back to the January evening of 2023 in Bhubaneswar. A dejected India skipper, carrying the nation's hopes on his penalty-corner skills, appeared clueless. The ball almost refused to roll up his stick on those flicks.The New Zealanders sent India out of the World Cup.It was not even the quarterfinal. Dream dusted in the crossovers, a desperate D-top flick by Harmanpreet during one-on-one shootout against the Kiwi custodian defined the tournament for India and its skipper.Head hung in disappointment, Harmanpreet dragged himself to the mandatory press conference along with Graham Reid, who almost knew it was his last meeting with the media as the India coach.It was about a year and half to go for the Paris Olympics then. Hockey India brought in a new coach in Craig Fulton, and his partnership with Harmanpreet as the team's think-tank has not just won India titles, including the Asian Games gold, but also saw Harmanpreet returning with his lethal short-corner skills that have taken India to the quarterfinals of theParis Games .With six goals in five matches, Harmanpreet is playing like Rocky Balboa returning to the ring.India's two slightly nervous opening matches were salvaged by Harmanpreet's last-minute goals, resulting in a 3-2 win over New Zealand and a 1-1 draw against the 2016 Olympic champions Argentina. The clean sheet in the 2-0 win over Ireland, courtesy Harmanpreet's brace, was comforting. But the real test at the pool stage was always going to be defending Olympic champions Belgium and nemesis Australia.With a place in the quarterfinals sealed before the two big games, India gave the Belgians a run for their money before losing 1-2. But the story of the men's hockey competition so far was written in the match against Australia.After 52 years, India finally managed to bell the cat and beat the Aussies in an Olympic match -- the last instance being a 3-1 win at the Munich Games in 1972.Harmanpreet's stick continued to fire, scoring two goals in India's 3-2 win, taking the tally of his international goals to 190 in 224 matches.Opposite to the trend against the Aussies over the years, it was India who led 2-1 at half-time, showing the promise that the team wants to deliver on in Paris.“That's what we are looking for -- to give India its ninth (hockey) gold. We are giving (it our) everything to win that gold medal,"" Harmanpreet told FIH (International Hockey Federation) after the win over Australia.""But the main tournament is starting now. So the quarterfinals, the semifinals, those matches are very crucial. So we're just looking to give our best,” said the two-time FIH Men’s Player of the Year.Having finished second in Pool B with 10 points, India will take on Pool A's third-placed team, Great Britain. The match is scheduled for 1:30 pm IST on August 4.Decoding the historic win over Australia, Harmanpreet said: ""We started (the Paris Olympics by) winning, and we decided we were going to finish with a winning match. We put them under pressure and the pressure was so good from the frontline. And our motto was to score the first goal. So we did it and I think after that we managed very well. Because everybody knows that the Australians come full press, so the positioning and scanning was good today, the way we managed the ball.""The real tournament, though, begins with the knockouts, where the losing team packs its bags to go home. And Harmanpreet summed it up in few and precise words.""There's no room to make mistakes.""","Harmanpreet scored two goals in India's 3-2 win over Australia. India finished second in Pool B with 10 points. India will take on Pool A's third-placed team, Great Britain, on August 4. India beat Australia for the first time in 52 years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112237765,imgsize-61570,width-400,resizemode-4/112237765.jpg"
EXPLAINED: Why India will play Paris Olympics hockey semifinal against Germany with 15 players,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/explained-why-india-will-play-paris-olympics-hockey-semifinal-against-germany-with-15-players/articleshow/112273951.cms,"WHY ROHIDAS GOT A RED CARD

HOCKEY INDIA'S OFFICIAL COMPLAINT

ONE-MATCH SUSPENSION FOR ROHIDAS

HOW ROHIDAS'S ABSENCE AFFECTS INDIA

The Indian men's hockey team has received a jolt ahead of their Paris Olympics semifinal against Germany and are already at a disadvantage in their quest for a place in the final after 44 years.The Tokyo Olympics bronze medallists will have only 15 players available to play the last-four clash instead of a full squad of 16 after defender Amit Rohidas was suspended for one match following his red card in the quarterfinal against Great Britain.The 31-year-old Rohidas was spotted swinging his stick across the face of British forward Will Calnan in the second quarter of the match on Sunday. The on-field umpire did not rule the offence as serious to get a red card, but Rohidas was shown red and given the marching orders after a video referral.Subsequently, India played the British team with 10 players for more than 40 minutes. However, the Harmanpreet Singh-led side defended heroically, thanks largely to PR Sreejesh's presence in the goalpost, to hold onto the 1-1 scoreline and take the game to a shootout.Goalkeeper Sreejesh once again turned out to be the star, saving two attempts by the GB team in the one-on-one shootout to help India earn a dramatic 4-2 win and a second successive entry into the semis at the Olympics.After the match, India officially raised a concern ""about the quality of umpiring and decision-making"" and citied ""several inconsistencies in officiating"" that ""potentially influenced the game's outcome"".Among the issues raised by India were ""inconsistent video umpire reviews, particularly regarding the red-card decision"" and the fact that the British goalkeeper was being coached from behind the goalpost during the shootout.""Hockey India calls for a thorough review of these matters to uphold the integrity of the sport and ensure fair play in future matches,"" the complaint read.However, later in the evening, the tournament's organising committee handed Rohidas a one-match ban for breaching the FIH Code of Conduct, which means India will have one player less in their usual squad of 16 men for the semifinal against Germany.“Amit Rohidas was suspended for one match for a breach of the FIH Code of Conduct which occurred during the India vs Great Britain match on August 4,” read the official statement by the FIH.“The suspension affects match No. 35 (India’s semi-final match against Germany), where Amit Rohidas will not participate and India will play with a squad of 15 players only.”Rohidas's absence will seriously hamper the Indian defence, their options of drag-flickers on penalty corners and rolling substitutions. Most importantly, the team will miss the rushing skills of Rohidas.He is considered one of the best rushers in the world when it comes to penalty-corner defence, and his absence will force India's chief coach Craig Fulton to alter India's short-corner strategy against Germany.",Amit Rohidas has been suspended for one match by the FIH. The 31-year-old defender was shown a red card in the quarterfinal against Great Britain. Rohidas was spotted swinging his stick across the face of British forward Will Calnan in the second quarter of the match on Sunday. India played the British team with 10 players for more than 40 minutes.

They specifically mentioned the red card issued to Indian player Amit Rohidas .According to the video umpire, Rohidas’s stick-raising was deemed a deliberate attempt to harm another player. Many observers, however, argued that his action was part of his natural biomechanical movement and not intentional.The incident has reduced trust in the video review system among players, coaches, and fans.Another major issue was the coaching of Great Britain’s goalkeeper from behind the goalpost during the shoot-out. Hockey India noted this as a breach of fair play principles and expressed concerns over the integrity of the match.The use of a video tablet by the Great Britain goalkeeper during the shoot-out also drew scrutiny. The unusual practice led to concerns about rule adherence and fairness in the competition.Hockey India has called for a thorough review of these incidents.

Little disappointed but these things happen,"" said Rohit, as quoted by PTI, in the post-match presentation ceremony.""We weren't good enough. Don't want to look too much into how we played. But there'll be talks about our batting in the middle overs,"" he added.Rohit emphasized that India's batters need to adapt quickly to the pitch conditions.""You got to adapt to what's in front of you. With left-right (combination of batsmen), we felt it'll be easier to rotate strike. But credit to Jeffrey, he got six wickets.""The 37-year-old stated that his approach will remain unchanged despite the setback in this match.""The reason I got 65 is because of the way I batted. When I am batting like that, there's a lot of risks taken. If you don't cross the line, you always feel disappointed.""But I don't want to compromise on my intent. We understand nature of this surface, it gets really tough in the middle overs. You have to try to get as many as possible in the powerplay,"" he added.Sri Lankan skipper Charith Asalanka said that their total of 240 was sufficient given the conditions.""I was happy with the score -- 240 was good enough. As a captain, I like this kind of problems (plenty of spin options). It was an unbelievable spell by him (Vandersay).""However, Asalanka expressed hope that he would contribute with the bat in the next match.""I am mainly a batter, and I have to score runs. After that I can bowl a few overs,"" he said.Player of the match Wandersay acknowledged feeling some pressure to perform, as he stepped in as a replacement for Wanindu Hasaranga , who was ruled out of the series due to a hamstring injury.""There was a lot of pressure coming into the side. I am coming out of a layoff. It is easier to take credit (for myself). But I want to give credit to the batters as well, who put 240 runs on board.""The 34-year-old acknowledged that he will need to keep pushing himself to remain among the regular players.""Hasaranga is our No. 1 spinner. I got to understand the atmosphere of the team and team balance. I have to keep pushing myself.""Vandersay said the wicket of Rohit Sharma boosted his confidence.""There was assistance in the wicket, I was trying to hit the good areas. Once I got my first wicket (Rohit), that built up my confidence,"" he said.","India lost second ODI by 32 runs to Sri Lanka in Colombo on Sunday.

Yusuf Dikec , a Turkish pistol shooter , has recently become a social media sensation for his calm and seemingly casual demeanor while securing a silver medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics . Many have praised his ‘ main character energy ,’ while others jokingly speculated that he might be an undercover assassin returning to serve his nation. A viral social media post even claimed that Dikec was a 51-year-old mechanic from Istanbul who took up shooting after a divorce.In reality, Dikec is far from a newcomer to the sport. He is a seasoned athlete who has represented Türkiye in every Summer Olympics since 2008. Before his shooting career, Dikec served as a non-commissioned officer in the Turkish Gendarmerie, Türkiye’s paramilitary police force. His recent partnership with Sevval Ilayda Tarhan in the mixed team 10-meter air pistol event at the 2024 Paris Olympics led to Türkiye’s first-ever medal in Olympic shooting.The misinformation likely started with a social media post that included a photo of Dikec and a fictional story about him taking up shooting after a difficult personal life. However, a closer look at his background reveals that Dikec has a long and accomplished history in competitive shooting.Dikec holds a degree from the Gazi University School of Physical Training and Education in Ankara and a Master’s degree in coaching from Selcuk University in Türkiye. His Olympic journey began in 2008, and the Paris 2024 Olympics marked his fifth appearance on the world stage. He started shooting competitively in 2001, shortly after joining the Turkish Gendarmerie General Command. His consistent participation in the Olympics, along with his well-documented records and accomplishments, debunks the viral narrative that he is a recent entrant into the sport.","Yusuf Dikec has represented Türkiye in every Summer Olympics since 2008.

NEW DELHI: In 1928, Indian hockey embarked on a journey that got written and rewritten in 'golden' words, where the team won medals for 10 Olympics in a row. The 44-year run of consecutive podium finishes included a period of 28 years that saw a couple of World Wars, India getting independence and six Olympic editions where the hockey team won six successive gold medals without losing a match.At the 1952 Helsinki Games, wrestler KD Jadhav won India's first post-independence individual medal, a bronze.It was the first occasion when the hockey team's medal had company. But what hockey kept waiting for, since winning its first medal on 26th May 1928, was an Indian 'team' from another sport to join it as an Olympic medal winner.That wait ended after 96 years on July 30th 2024, at the Paris Games when the shooting duo of Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh became the first Indian 'team' apart from hockey to win an Olympic medal.is how hockey legend and three-time Olympic medallist Harbinder Singh reacted in surprise when Timesofindia.com reached out to him over the phone for his reaction on the unique parallel of Manu and Sarabjot's bronze-medal win. The Indians defeated their South Korean opponents, Oh Ye Jin and Wonho Lee, 16-10 on Tuesday in the third-place playoff in the10m air pistol mixed team event.It was Manu's second medal of the Games, after she opened India's account in Paris with a bronze in the women's 10m air pistol individual event.""These two young kids have done well. Good for hockey to have company now with another team, as you pointed out. It never struck me,"" he added.""It still gives me goosebumps when I think of winning the gold medal by beating Pakistan in the (Tokyo) 1964 final, after we had lost to them in the final of the (Rome) 1960 Olympics,"" Harbinder recalled. ""I remember we landed at the Palam airport in Delhi and the entire airport was packed with fans who had come to welcome us.""Talking about similarities to hockey's 96-year wait for an Indian 'team' from another sport to win an Olympic medal, it took 44 years after KD Jadhav's 1952 bronze to have another individual Olympic medal winner from India. Tennis legend Leander Paes ended that wait with his men's singles bronze at Atlanta 1996.It took India 100 years to have a woman win an Olympic medal, a historic feat achieved by weightlifter Karnam Malleswari, who won a bronze at the Sydney Olympics in 2000. She waited 12 years for company in the form of badminton great Saina Nehwal and boxing legend Mary Kom as the next women Olympic medal winners from India. Both won bronze medals at the 2012 London Games.Rifle shooter Abhinav Bindra 's individual gold at Beijing in 2008 was India's first in 108 years of the country's Olympic history at that time. He was joined by track-and-field athlete Neeraj Chopra 13 years later with his javelin-throw gold in Tokyo.Hockey had to wait for 41 years, after its 1980 Moscow gold, to return to the Olympic podium. The bronze at the Tokyo Games in 2021 broke that jinx.Neeraj's javelin gold at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago remains India's first athletics medal post independence.

Vandersay then delivered a spectacular performance, taking 6 wickets for 33 runs, which stifled India's chase and secured a memorable 32-run victory for Sri Lanka at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.Since making his debut in December 2015, Vandersay has featured in 22 ODIs, often finding himself in and out of the team.However, in Sunday’s match, he emerged as the hero, dismissing Rohit Sharma , Shubman Gill, Shivam Dube, Virat Kohli , Shreyas Iyer, and KL Rahul in just 29 balls. His efforts earned him the seventh-best figures by a Sri Lankan bowler in ODIs and gave Sri Lanka a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Vandersay, named Man of the Match, attributed his confidence to the dismissal of Rohit Sharma.“There was some assistance from the wicket, so I focused on hitting the right areas and sticking to the basics. This was my first game in a while, so I knew I needed to bowl accurately,"" Vandersay said after Sri Lanka won the match.“Once I took the first wicket (Rohit), my confidence grew.

The leg-spinner's six-wicket haul for just 33 runs played a crucial role in dismantling the Indian batting lineup, ultimately leading Sri Lanka to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series, following a tied opening game.The match saw India chasing a target of 241 on a pitch that was conducive to spin bowling.Despite a promising start, India were bowled out for 208 in 42.2 overs.Rohit Sharma 's aggressive 64 off 44 balls, featuring five fours and four sixes, initially set a strong foundation for India. Alongside Shubman Gill, who contributed a steady 35, the pair propelled India to 97 for one in just 13.3 overs.However, the dismissal of Sharma, caught off a reverse sweep by Vandersay, marked the beginning of a dramatic collapse for the Indian batting order.From a comfortable 97 for one, India's situation quickly deteriorated to 147 for six, losing six wickets for just 50 runs within a span of 10 overs.Vandersay, stepping in for the injured Wanindu Hasaranga , was the architect of this collapse, effectively exploiting the conditions and the Indian batsmen's vulnerabilities. Notable dismissals included Shivam Dube , Virat Kohli , and Shreyas Iyer , all falling to Vandersay's spin, highlighting the challenges posed by the pitch.Despite the top-order collapse, Axar Patel attempted a counter-attack with a resilient 44 off 44 balls, including a brief partnership with Washington Sundar .However, his effort was cut short when he was caught off the bowling of Charith Asalanka, concluding any realistic chance of an Indian comeback.Earlier in the day, Sri Lanka's batting effort was characterized by a challenging start against India's spinners, particularly Washington Sundar, who finished with figures of 3/30. Kuldeep Yadav also contributed with 2/33, applying pressure on the Sri Lankan batters.Despite struggling at 136 for six, a crucial 72-run partnership between Dunith Wellalage and Kamindu Mendis provided the hosts with a competitive total of 240 for nine.

"Lovlina Borgohain exits arena, but not without a fight at Paris Olympics",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/lovlina-borgohain-exits-arena-but-not-without-a-fight-at-paris-olympics/articleshow/112275751.cms,"PARIS: Lovlina Borgohain entered the arena with a smile, and with a strange, awkward looking sway to the music almost as if she was willing herself to be in the zone that was required of her. She smiled through almost all of her bout with old foe Li Qian , showing even through the exaggerated pouts that mouth guards give boxers - once even offering to help pick up the Chinese when the double Olympic medallist and the world No 1 found herself on the floor during a second round brawl.The last Indian boxer in the fray here, was she not aware of the task ahead of her in Paris? Or was appearing blissfully oblivious her way of deflecting all things mental in boxing?Maybe, that is how she is made. Is Lovlina too much of a nice guy in this grab and smash world of Olympic women's boxing ? It was an aspect that she may have perhaps needed to conceal, disguise in this high stakes bout with Qian, one that would grant her entry to the Roland Garros venue as a semifinalist in the women's 75kg, and ensure her of a medal, her second at the Olympics.Because at some level there was disappointment too, and overnight anger. Disappointment because Lovlina was the last of the Indian boxers here in Paris, after a shrill campaign that had promised much but unfortunately delivered little. And anger from overnight, because many in the Indian camp felt that late evening fighter, Nishant Dev was robbed of a genuine win against Mexico's Marco Alvarez in the strangest of split decisions in Saturday's men's 71kg quarterfinals, after he had taken the lead in the first round and had looked the better puncher in the final third.Lovlina entered the ring with a smile, but left with a little tear in her eye. Because, it would go in similar fashion on Sunday morning as well, the Indian being edged out in a 4-1 split decision in a close fight to a familiar foe.The bout began with Lovlina needing to stay out of the Chinese's reach, not get too close and get ensnared in a scrap which would allow Qian employ her clinching tactics. But just the reverse happened. Lovlina was drawn into the fight at the level and nature that Qian would have liked, the holding and clinching ensued leaving Lovlina having to drag herself from it. Still, it was a close verdict - 3-2 - in the Chinese boxer's favour.Realising that she may have a chance if she reverted to her type, Lovlina began Round Two in just that way. Like she did with her easy-looking manner in the last bout against Norway's Sunniva Hofstad , Lovlina kept away forcing Qian to charge. The taking over of momentum worked, as Lovlina seemed much more in control, dictating the fight her way.It was the best round of boxing of the bout with the two gangly 75 kg boxers sizing each other up, parrying and trading punches. It was again 3-2 in favour of Qian, but a much-improved show from Lovlina - two of the judges who had ruled in favour of Qian in the first round choosing to award the Indian here. It gave much hope for the final three minutes, where maybe there lay in store, a semifinal entry for Lovlina, and her own second Olympic medal.She had to fight to recover, to draw level and to take the lead. In the third then, dropping her defences Lovlina waded in, in an attempt to turn the tide but Qian was more than prepared. Trailing after the first round has afflicted the Indian boxers here in Paris, leaving them with having to do the rallying in the second and fight for parity and hope for an inch-close win off the final. More often than not that will not work at this highest level of competition, and certainly not for India at Paris here.","Lovlina Borgohain beaten 4-1 by China's Li Qian in women's 75kg quarterfinal.

PARIS: ""The real test begins now,"" Lakshya Sen had said on Friday evening after making the semifinals of the men's singles. The Indian shuttler found out that it was indeed real, and mentally bruising, at the Porte de la Chapelle arena on Sunday. The 22-year-old was up against world's No.2 Victor Axelsen of Denmark. World champion, defending champion, towering over his rival at six feet four, the 30-year-old Dane was a formidable, intimidating opponent.Sen knew that. He had won just one in eight encounters against the Dane before this and taken just three games off him.But the Indian was fearless when he went in there. He gave it his all, left his heart out there on the court. He walked away with several unanswered questions ringing in his head. He had lost 20-22, 14-21 and it would take time to sink in.Sen was in control of the first game. After fighting with all his skills and courage, he had the Dane cornered, having scored six points in that game at one stage to go up 17-11. He finally had three game points in his hands. 20-17. He had to go for the kill. Something snapped. He lost it there.Sen was probably thinking too much, too hard. He made a service error. You don't do that against a player who has often come back from the dead in hostile arenas across the world. This was the lifelineAxelsen needed. He could see that the Indian across the net was nervous. It was his turn to go for the kill. Axelsen drove the knife in hard, taking the game at 22-20, reeling off five straight points.The tone of the contest was set. Or was it? Sen returned to serve in the second game and looked unaffected as he scored seven straight points. 7-0. This was unreal. Axelsen looked a bit unsettled as he kept making unforced errors, sending his returns long or wide. Sen was cruising. He served well, returned well, had a couple of delectable drop shots and a few smash hits too.But the fans in Sen's corner were probably thinking too far ahead. Probably so was Sen. Axelsen being a champion of comebacks, got a foot in the door when a Sen return went wide. Down 1-7, the Dane slowly started catching up.Sen was the better player at the net throughout the contest. He kept trying to draw his tall rival in with his drop shots. The Indian won some crucial points at the net and his experienced rival realised that he needed a change in strategy. Instead of playing the drop shot contest, he hit out long and took control from the backcourt. From there came the half smash, the flick and the stinging powerful smash.Axelsen caught up with Sen at 10-10 with his trademark smash. Lakshya stayed in the game till 12-12 and then suddenly lost rhythm. He was losing control. Axelsen sensed it and knew just what to do. Suddenly, he looked to be in a hurry. He smashed at will, hard and brutal. Sen had no more answers. He kept making unforced errors and threw in the towel.After the match, Axelsen admitted that Sen played better on the day. ""He could have won today. Four years down the line he will be a better player, I am sure,"" he said.So, what was he thinking when he was down 17-20 in the first game? ""I tried not to think. I was blank. He thought a lot. It is natural. He got nervous and I had to strike. He made mistakes due to his nerves. My experience helped me.""When asked about Sen's game, Axelsen said: ""He played better than me. But I won it here,"" he said, pointing to his head.And what was his weapon against the Indian? ""Good badminton ,"" said the Dane with a smile as he walked away.And what did Sen think of the missed opportunity. ""I should have won the first game. Overall, it was a good match, and I am already looking ahead,"" he said, not wanting to speak about the bitter defeat.""I have to learn to be a bit more patient. I made errors but honestly, I played what I thought was the best in that situation on the court. There are many lessons for me from this match. But there is no time to think about them now. I have to forget this and the earlier matches,"" he said.He will be back on the court on Monday. He still has a date to keep - the bronze match against World No. 7 Lee Zii Jia of Malaysia.","Lakshya Sen loses 20-22, 14-21 to world No.2 Victor Axelsen of Denmark.

Nothing to celebrate in athletics so far

NEW DELHI: The Indian men's hockey team delivered an outstanding performance to secure a spot in the Olympic semifinals for the second time in a row while Lakshya Sen 's dreams of gold medal shifted to a potential bronze on a mixed-result day for India at the Paris Games.India's 53rd position in the medal tally did not improve on Sunday as no new medals were added but the hockey team's incredible shoot-out win over Great Britain turned out to be the highlight of the day.India's current tally includes bronze medals, all in shooting events -- from the women's 10m air pistol, 10m air pistol mixed team, and men's 50m rifle three positions.In boxing, Lovlina Borgohain, a bronze medalist in the welterweight category at the Tokyo Games, faced disappointment. Borgohain lost in the quarterfinals to Chinese veteran Li Qian in the women's middleweight (75kg) category.Lakshya Sen also faced a setback in his bid for gold, losing 20-22, 14-21 to defending champion Viktor Axelsen.However, Sen has another chance for a medal as he will compete against Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia in the bronze playoff scheduled for Monday evening.Despite the challenges, the Indian contingent had a reason to rejoice. The men's hockey team showed remarkable resilience, particularly after key defender Amit Rohidas received a red card for unintentionally hitting a rival player 20 minutes into the game.The team managed to hold off Britain to 1-1, leading to a decisive shoot-out.Veteran goalkeeper PR Sreejesh , often referred to as the 'Great Wall of India', then played a crucial role in the shoot-out.

This can be my last match, or I got an opportunity for two more matches and I think, yeah, I got two more matches now,"" he quipped.Coach Craig Fulton expressed his pride in the team’s performance, stating that the victory was more than just a win.""When our backs are against the wall, we're all roped in. We're all in this together,"" he said.India's boxing campaign came to an unsuccessful end after Lovlina Borgohain, the Tokyo bronze-winner, lost in the women's 75kg quarterfinals to China's Li Qian.The defeat followed a close loss by Nishant Dev in the men's 71kg quarterfinals, leaving the team without any medals.Borgohain, who is the reigning world champion in her category, was defeated 1-4 in a challenging match against Li Qian, the Tokyo Games silver medalist. Both boxers received repeated cautions for clinching and holding during the contest.India was represented by a six-member boxing contingent at the Games, consisting of four women and two men. Four of these boxers were eliminated in the preliminary stages.India's pursuit of a historic first Olympic gold in badminton was dashed when Lakshya Sen lost to Viktor Axelsen in the men's singles semifinals.The 22-year-old Sen, who previously won a bronze at the World Championships, could not hold onto his early leads in either game of the 54-minute match against the two-time world champion.Sen initially had a three-point advantage in the first game and followed with a 7-0 lead in the second game.Despite the promising starts, he ultimately succumbed to Axelsen's prowess, leaving the dream unfulfilled.India is yet to clinch an Olympic gold in badminton.PV Sindhu won a silver and bronze in the 2016 Rio and 2020 Tokyo Olympics , respectively, while Saina Nehwal secured a bronze at the 2012 London Games.Shooters Vijayveer Sidhu and Anish Bhanwala put up commendable performances in the qualifications of the 25m rapid fire men's pistol event in Chateauroux but fell short of making it to the finals.Vijayveer and Anish displayed brilliant shooting skills over the two stages of qualification.They remained strong contenders until the final 10 shots of the second rapid-fire stage.However, they shot scores of 92 and 93, finishing in ninth and 13th places respectively. Unfortunately, only the top six shooters advance to the final round.In the women's skeet competition, Maheshwari Chauhan and Raiza Dhillon also showed competitive spirit. Maheshwari ended in 14th place, scoring a total of 118 across five series. The first three series, which took place on Saturday, saw her scoring 23, 24, and 24, followed by 25 and 22 in the subsequent series.Raiza finished in 23rd place with a total score of 113, after recording 21, 22, 23, 23, and 24 in her series.Similar to the men's event, only the top six in the qualifications moved on to the final stage.India's performance in the athletics competition saw national record holders Parul Chaudhary and Jeswin Aldrin falling short in their respective events.While Parul failed to qualify for the women's 3000m steeplechase, Jeswin Aldrin did not make it through the men's long jump qualification, both ending their campaigns at the Paris Olympics .Parul finished eighth in her heat and 21st overall in the women's 3000m steeplechase.Jeswin fouled his first two attempts in the men's long jump qualification before recording a jump of 7.61 meters on his third try.He concluded the competition 13th in Group B and was placed 26th overall.",Lakshya Sen loses to Viktor Axelsen in men's singles badminton.

Unbelievable off-side 'helicopter' shot by Rashid Khan - Watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/unbelievable-off-side-helicopter-shot-by-rashid-khan-watch/articleshow/112258574.cms,"WATCH VIDEO

Rashid Khan keeps moving from one T20 league to another around the globe and the bowling all-rounder from Afghanistan continues to expand the array of his shots, which saw an astonishing ' helicopter shot ' on the off-side for a six in a match of ' The Hundred ' in England.The helicopter shot -- an aerial whip from the off and middle stump to a delivery pitched up -- was made famous by former India captain MS Dhoni, who is known to have invented it during his heydays.But batsmen across the world, especially Afghanistan captain Rashid, continue to evolve it and take it to a different level.It's easier for the bottom hand on the bat handle to rotate the wrist inward and hit the ball on the on-side. But to make your wrist do that in the opposite direction and still put the same power into the shot is almost unthinkable, but Rashid did it.That's why almost every helicopter shot ends up somewhere between deep mid-wicket and long-on. But Rashid's helicopter landed over long-off.Batting for Trent Rockets in the unique 100-balls-a-side format in England, called 'The Hundred', Rashid's solitary six during his 8-ball 13 against Welsh Fire made jaws drop.Last month, playing in the Major League Cricket for MI New York, Rashid pulled off a helicopter shot with horizontal bat, which was also a never-seen-before version of it.",Afghanistan's Rashid Khan pulls off a helicopter shot on the off-side for a six in a match of'The Hundred'in England.
