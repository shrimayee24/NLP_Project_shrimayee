Asia Cup press conference: Suryakumar Yadav on playing Pakistan, Sanju Samson, India Playing XI

NEW DELHI: In a rare incident during the Asia Cup 2025 clash between India and UAE at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Wednesday, UAE batter Junaid Siddique was initially given out after a sharp direct throw from India‚Äôs wicketkeeper Sanju Samson found him short of the crease. However, Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav chose to withdraw the appeal when Siddique pointed out that bowler Shivam Dube‚Äôs towel had slipped from his waistband during the run-up.The unusual moment came in the 13th over when Siddique attempted a wild swing at Dube‚Äôs short-pitched delivery. Replays from the third umpire confirmed that his foot was outside the crease, and the ‚ÄúOUT‚Äù signal was flashed on the big screen before India opted to overturn the appeal.The gesture did not impact the match result, as UAE were bundled out for just 57 runs soon after.Kuldeep Yadav, returning to white-ball action after warming the bench during India‚Äôs five-Test tour of England, was the star with the ball.

Who Wins the Most?

Theare reportedly in advanced talks to acquirefrom the Los Angeles Clippers in a blockbuster trade that could reshape the NBA landscape. By pairing Leonard with LeBron James and Luka Doncic, the Lakers aim to create one of the most formidable trios in league history. The trade would not only offer immediate title hopes but also bring strategic advantages for all teams involved.NBA sources indicate that the Lakers would need to offer a substantial trade package to secure Kawhi Leonard, who is under a $50 million salary for the 2024-25 season. The Clippers are expected to demand a mix of promising young players such as Austin Reaves or Bronny James, future draft picks, expiring contracts, and salary-matching assets.An interesting development making this trade more plausible is the NBA‚Äôs ongoing investigation into the Clippers‚Äô 2021 cap circumvention, which could potentially void Leonard‚Äôs contract and allow the Lakers to sign him at a discounted rate, sources suggest.Adding Kawhi Leonard would drastically enhance the Los Angeles Lakers ‚Äô championship aspirations. Leonard‚Äôs elite two-way play would complement the scoring prowess of Doncic and the leadership of LeBron James.Leonard, known for his clutch performances and defensive excellence, averaged 21.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, and 3.1 assists on nearly 50% shooting in the current season.Key benefits for the Lakers include:‚Ä¢ A versatile lineup that can switch defensively.‚Ä¢ Balanced scoring options and reduced pressure on star players.‚Ä¢ A renewed push toward winning now while LeBron James remains at his peak.For Kawhi Leonard, the trade offers stability and a healthier environment. Leonard would share playmaking responsibilities with Doncic, allowing him to conserve energy and lower injury risks. He would also join a championship-caliber roster while remaining in Los Angeles, near family and personal interests.Leonard‚Äôs benefits include:‚Ä¢ Access to a title-driven team structure.‚Ä¢ Reduced physical demands and prolonged career viability.‚Ä¢ A chance to move past off-court controversies involving the Clippers. The Clippers , by trading Leonard, would open the door to rebuilding with younger talent and future draft picks. The team‚Äôs roster, currently averaging 33.2 years of age - the oldest in NBA history - would undergo much-needed rejuvenation.Advantages for the Clippers:‚Ä¢ Increased flexibility for future signings.‚Ä¢ Relief from salary cap constraints.‚Ä¢ Public relations improvement following scandal coverage.‚Ä¢ The Lakers become instant title contenders with three elite scorers and defenders.‚Ä¢ Kawhi Leonard benefits from reduced injury risks and better team support.‚Ä¢ Clippers gain young assets and strategic cap space for rebuilding.‚Ä¢ Potential chemistry challenges with Leonard‚Äôs previous reluctance to play alongside LeBron James.‚Ä¢ Clippers‚Äô competitiveness may dip in the short term.‚Ä¢ Lakers may risk depth for a win-now approach.The Lakers win immediately, forming the league‚Äôs most talented trio and maximizing LeBron‚Äôs remaining window.‚Ä¢ The Lakers gain an elite roster capable of challenging for titles.‚Ä¢ Leonard receives better health management and career opportunities.‚Ä¢ The Clippers position themselves for long-term growth and roster flexibility.‚Ä¢ NBA fans benefit from a high-stakes rivalry and an exciting narrative.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Target $1,082,061 Los Angeles Clippers Star to Strengthen Defense and Support LeBron James & Luka Doncic A Kawhi Leonard trade to the Los Angeles Lakers could be one of the biggest moves in recent NBA history.

Why Kawhi Leonard Dodged the Los Angeles Lakers and LeBron James

The Los Angeles Clippers initially labeled the allegations as provably false before changing their language to absurd

In the summer of 2019, Kawhi Leonard was at the top of the NBA world. After guiding the Toronto Raptors to their first championship, the calm superstar entered free agency as the most sought-after player available. His choice would change the league's dynamics, balancing local loyalty with championship dreams and personal desires.In the end, Leonard chose the Los Angeles Clippers instead of the Los Angeles Lakers or a possible comeback with the Raptors.From the beginning, the Lakers were considered a long shot, despite their flashy reputation and the addition of LeBron James and Anthony Davis. In 2019, various reports mentioned that Leonard had no desire to play with James, thinking it could lead to a clash of egos or styles.According to NBA insider Chris Haynes, then with Yahoo Sports, Leonard's camp explicitly avoided the Lakers because he ""didn't want to play with LeBron,"" preferring to be the unquestioned leader. This sentiment was echoed in later reflections; for instance, in a 2024 Fadeaway World report, it was noted that Leonard rejected the chance to form a superteam with James and Davis, opting instead for Paul George as a partner.A faceless NBA executive mentioned to Newsweek in September 2025 that the Lakers ""dodged a bullet"" by not acquiring Leonard, highlighting his injury record and the unfolding scandal. At that moment, Lakers GM Rob Pelinka was chasing Leonard hard, but the forward's dislike for sharing the spotlight with James who he had just triumphed over in the Finals with the Warriors sealed the deal. Leonard's decision favored freedom over joining a dominant team.Jump ahead to 2021-2022, and things get a bit dicey with Leonard's agreement with Aspiration, a climate finance company. As Pablo Torre first mentioned on his podcast ""Pablo Torre Finds Out"" back in September 2025, Aspiration committed to shelling out $7 million each year for four years beginning in April 2022, specifically for no services provided.The contract, found among more than 3,000 pages of documents, had a clause that let Leonard off the hook from any work. Torre also verified, through the Boston Sports Journal, that Leonard got $20 million in company shares now completely worthless after Aspiration went bankrupt.In August 2021, Leonard signed an extension with the Clippers; then in September 2021, Ballmer put $50 million into Aspiration; that same month, the Clippers announced Aspiration as a sponsor; Leonard's LLC got registered in November 2021; and the payouts kicked off in 2022. An unnamed Aspiration employee told Torre this was a ""scheme to skirt the NBA salary cap."" The deal was never publicized, unlike endorsements with celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio or Drake, who received far less.In a September 2025 interview with Ramona Shelburne for ESPN, Ballmer refuted claims of cap violations, saying he was ""conned"" by Aspiration and had no say in their deal with Leonard. He acknowledged that he introduced Aspiration to Leonard at their request but maintained that the Clippers followed the rules. Initially, the Clippers labeled the allegations as ""provably false,"" but later they toned it down to ""absurd. ""Also Read: Luka Doncic shuts down the critics with a EuroBasket best defender nomination So far, Leonard and Robertson have kept quiet. If this scandal is confirmed, it could overshadow earlier cases like the 1998 Joe Smith-Timberwolves trade, which led to penalties and lost draft picks. At this moment, it puts a negative spin on Leonard's choice to go with the Clippers avoiding LeBron, securing George, and reportedly receiving a $28 million side deal that Toronto ethically declined.","Kawhi Leonard avoided the Los Angeles Lakers and LeBron James because he ""didn't want to play with LeBron,"" preferring to be the unquestioned leader.

Ethan Pritchard shooting : four suspects charged



Ethan Pritchard honored amid Thursday Night Football schedule spotlight



Authorities in Florida have arrested four individuals in connection with the shooting of Florida State freshman linebacker Ethan Pritchard, a rising player whose football journey was abruptly interrupted by a senseless act of violence. The incident, which occurred in Havana, Florida, late on August 30, left Pritchard hospitalized in critical but stable condition. Officials now believe the shooting was a case of mistaken identity.The Florida Department of Law Enforcement announced Wednesday that Jayden Bodison, Caron Miller, Germany Atkins, and an unnamed minor were taken into custody. Bodison, Miller, and the minor face three counts of attempted murder along with one count of shooting into an occupied vehicle. Atkins has been charged separately with a probation violation.Investigators said Pritchard had been dropping off relatives, including a child and an aunt, when gunfire struck his car. One bullet hit him in the back of the head, forcing emergency responders to rush him to Tallahassee Memorial Hospital. Sheriff Morris Young confirmed authorities are treating the case as a tragic case of mistaken identity.The timing of the shooting only magnified the heartbreak. It happened just one day after Florida State opened its season with a win over Alabama.Pritchard, a three-star recruit from the 2025 class, did not play in that game, but he was expected to play a role in the Seminoles‚Äô defense this season.While Pritchard fights to recover, his teammates and coaches continue to keep his spirit alive. During Florida State‚Äôs dominant victory over Texas A&M-Commerce, players wore wristbands with his number, 35, and his jersey was carried out for the coin toss. Head coach Mike Norvell presented the game ball to Pritchard‚Äôs father, Earl, following the win.Norvell grew visibly emotional when asked about Pritchard. ‚ÄúEthan is one of my favorites,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI recruited him for years and got a chance to watch him grow. When he committed to Florida State, the way that he plays the game, his passion and energy‚Äîhe loves it.‚ÄùFor now, Florida State rallies around Pritchard as law enforcement pushes forward in building its case. With arrests made, the focus shifts to ensuring justice, while the football community waits and hopes for Pritchard‚Äôs full recovery.Also Read: Harrison Butker breaks silence with touching message remembering Charlie Kirk after tragic assassination stuns America",Florida State freshman linebacker Ethan Pritchard was shot in the back of the head on August 30.

Asia Cup: Gautam Gambhir in a serious discussion with India vice-captain Shubman Gill

NEW DELHI: Left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav and seamer Shivam Dube ran through the United Arab Emirates‚Äô batting lineup as India romped to a nine-wicket win in their Asia Cup 2025 opener on Wednesday. Kuldeep‚Äôs sharp googlies earned him figures of 4 for 7, while Dube claimed 3 for 4, helping bowl out UAE for just 57 in 13.1 overs ‚Äî the lowest-ever T20 total against India.In reply, India made light work of the chase, reaching 60 for 1 in just 4.3 overs. Opening batter Abhishek Sharma impressed with 30 off 16 balls, hitting three sixes and two boundaries, while Shubman Gill remained unbeaten on 20.After the victory, Gill posted on social media: ‚ÄúStep one.‚ÄùUAE‚Äôs innings never truly got going despite a reasonable start from Alishan Sharafu (22) and captain Muhammad Waseem (19), who put together 41 for 2 in the powerplay.India‚Äôs relentless bowling soon took control. Bumrah dismissed Sharafu with a pinpoint yorker and Mohammad Zohaib was caught at backward point attempting an ambitious shot against Varun Chakravarthy.Kuldeep‚Äôs three-wicket over, which included a plumb leg-before dismissal of Waseem, dismantled the middle order.Dube then struck thrice in his two overs, and UAE folded with more than six overs to spare.A rare moment of confusion saw Junaid Siddique initially stumped, but India withdrew the appeal after he explained that Dube‚Äôs rag distracted him. He fell the next ball trying to recover. Kuldeep finished the innings by having Haider Ali caught behind.India‚Äôs chase was clinical. Abhishek launched Ali‚Äôs first ball over wide extra cover for a six and continued to dominate before falling off a miscued short ball. Suryakumar Yadav then smashed Siddique for a six, and Gill sealed the win with a boundary to mid-on.India now head into their next group matches against Pakistan and debutants Oman, having made a resounding statement in Dubai.","India beat United Arab Emirates by nine wickets in their Asia Cup opener.

Indian batters to hit first ball of the innings in T20I for a six:

Batter Name Rohit Sharma Yashasvi Jaiswal Sanju Samson Abhishek Sharma

NEW DELHI: Abhishek Sharma stole the spotlight as India began their 2025 Men‚Äôs Asia Cup campaign with a stunning nine-wicket win over the United Arab Emirates (UAE) at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. The left-handed opener, alongside Shubman Gill, made light work of a modest target in just 27 balls, orchestrating India‚Äôs fastest chase in men‚Äôs T20I history.The match swung India‚Äôs way early, thanks to brilliant bowling from Kuldeep Yadav and Shivam Dube. Kuldeep‚Äôs four-wicket haul (4-7) and Dube‚Äôs three wickets (3-4) bundled out UAE for a mere 57 in 13.1 overs ‚Äî a total the UAE would rue for months. This low score set the stage for Abhishek to unleash his power-hitting skills.From the first ball, Abhishek was aggressive. He lofted Haider Ali over long-off for a six, immediately asserting dominance, before slicing the spinner for a boundary.Gill, making a return to the T20I squad after more than a year, contributed with 20 not out, including a flick over square leg for a six. But it was Abhishek who kept the scoreboard ticking with dazzling strokes, including a back-foot six over long-off against Dhruv Parashar and a crisp four over extra cover.Even after a miscued pull to mid-on ended his innings, he had already set the tone for a statement chase.Abhishek now joins the elite list of Indian batters to hit a six off the first ball of a T20I innings, alongside Rohit Sharma Yashasvi Jaiswal , and Sanju Samson.Skipper Suryakumar Yadav added a swish over fine leg for six, and Gill finished with a boundary past mid-on to seal the emphatic victory. India chased the target in just 4.3 overs, eclipsing their previous record of 6.3 overs against Scotland in the 2021 Men‚Äôs T20 World Cup, also in Dubai.For UAE, it was an evening to forget. Their batters struggled against India‚Äôs relentless bowling, and their bowlers couldn‚Äôt contain Abhishek, Gill, and Suryakumar. Abhishek‚Äôs explosive start and commanding presence at the crease not only set the tone for India‚Äôs campaign but also sent a clear message to their Asia Cup rivals: India‚Äôs top order is in imperious form.India now head into their next group matches against Pakistan and debutants Oman, having made a resounding statement in Dubai.","India beat United Arab Emirates by nine wickets in Dubai.

Who is Akriti Agarwal?



Shaw‚Äôs cricketing journey



NEW DELHI: Indian cricketer Prithvi Shaw , once celebrated as India‚Äôs cricketing prodigy, is now making headlines for reasons beyond the cricket field. The right-handed batter, who has endured a tough phase in his professional career, is rumoured to be dating influencer Akriti Agarwal.Shaw, who went unsold at the IPL 2025 mega auction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, has been under the spotlight for his off-field life. Recently, he was spotted with Akriti in Mumbai, which immediately sparked dating rumours. The buzz gained momentum when Shaw wished her on her birthday with a heart emoji, a gesture fans were quick to interpret as confirmation of their relationship.On Wednesday, Shaw was seen driving to Lonavala for a short getaway with Akriti. She later uploaded a vlog and a reel on Instagram, giving followers a glimpse of their staycation. The video featured Shaw dancing, taking part in a rope zipline activity, and enjoying lighter moments away from the cricket field. ""Welcome to our first mini vlog. #minivlog #lonavala,"" Akriti captioned her post.Born in Lucknow and educated at Nirmala Memorial College in Mumbai, Akriti began her career as a content creator.Through a mix of relatable short videos and glamorous photoshoots, she steadily built a strong presence on Instagram and YouTube. She currently has more than 70,000 YouTube subscribers, and her upcoming film Trimukha is tipped to push her into Bollywood‚Äôs mainstream.Shaw was earlier linked to model Nidhi Tapadia, whose cryptic social media posts about betrayal and heartbreak hinted at a possible breakup. With Akriti now often seen alongside him, fans believe that Shaw has moved on. However, neither Shaw nor Akriti has officially confirmed the relationship.While his personal life makes headlines, Shaw‚Äôs cricketing journey continues to attract attention.Earlier this year, he shifted from Mumbai to Maharashtra and made an instant impact. In his maiden outing for his new side, he smashed a century in a Buchi Babu Trophy clash against Chhattisgarh on a difficult turning track in Chennai.Despite such flashes of brilliance, Shaw has struggled to return to the international fold. He last played for India in July 2021 and has represented the country in five Tests, six ODIs and one T20I.","Indian cricketer Prithvi Shaw is rumoured to be dating influencer Akriti Agarwal.

For years, Ram Vilas Shah, a migrant labourer from Kushinagar, Uttar Pradesh, sold fruit juice on his rehri (cart) outside Gate No. 1 of the IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali. His daily customers were a young batter by the name of Shubman Gill and his father Lakhwinder, who would stop for a glass of mosambi juice. Ram Vilas's son, Avinash Kumar , used to be a fast bowler and trained at the ground behind the Mohali Stadium.One day in 2014, Lakhwinder spotted Avinash near the cart and asked about his father. ""I told him, 'paaji, I've quit cricket. I am working in a photo studio. Today I am here because my father is not well,'"" Avinash recalls in a conversation with TimesofIndia.com.""I played cricket after my father requested one of the PCA coaches. I am two years senior to Shubman. I was a fast bowler but I quit cricket because of our family's financial constraints,"" he explains.A few months later, Lakhwinder spotted Avinash at his father's cart again and blasted him for quitting cricket.""Lakhwinder paaji was angry. He told me cricket can change your family's life. He was unhappy with my decision to walk away from cricket, and was even more miffed after I told him that I work in a photo studio,"" he says with a laugh now.A week later, Lakhwinder showed Avinash a video of a side-arm thrower and asked him to start practising and take the profession seriously.""I saw the video. Lakhwinder paaji helped me get one side-arm and I started mastering it,"" he says.From then on, Avinash‚Äôs friendship with Shubman Gill grew stronger.""I knew him from the academy. But now I became his personal side-arm thrower. Woh din tha aur aaj ka din hai. Hum ikkathe hai (There was that day and it is now. We've been together),"" Avinash proudly says.Avinash would earn Rs 150‚Äì200 per day but he personally never took a penny from Shubman or his father.""I never used to take money from Shubman's father. He has been my guiding light. He gave me money during festivals like Holi and Diwali. He took me to the hospital and also helped my family whenever we were in need. I will always be grateful,"" he says.Avinash recalls the early changes in Shubman‚Äôs batting.""Lakhwinder paaji used to get angry whenever Shubman played a lofted shot. Shubman would only hit in the V. It was only after the U-19 World Cup, followed by the IPL , that he started working on range-hitting,"" he says.""It surprised me because he used to say, 'what‚Äôs the point of getting out trying to score two extra runs? I can hit boundaries without taking risks.' But he realised that in T20, he needed to work on six-hitting. He started working on it and never looked back,"" he says.Avinash also explains how meticulous Gill‚Äôs preparations are.""He comes to every net session with a purpose. Even if he bats for three hours, he has the same intent. After the nets, he watches his videos, checks the areas where he‚Äôs troubled, watches his dismissals, and the next day he follows the same routine again,"" he adds.In 2019, Avinash became a side-arm thrower for the Punjab Ranji team and was instantly liked by senior pros like Mandeep Singh and Gurkeerat Mann, while bonding with youngsters like Shubman, Abhishek Sharma, Prabhsimran Singh, and Anmolpreet Singh.In 2024, in jest he told Shubman, 'Yaar ab tu captain ban gaya, mujhe bhi IPL le chal' (You have become captain of Gujarat Titans, take me with you).Shubman‚Äôs assuring words gave him hope. ""He told me I didn‚Äôt need to worry.""Earlier this year, Avinash was playing with his newborn son in Chandigarh when he received a call from Shubman.""Shubman told me to pack my bags as I would soon get a call from the Gujarat Titans management. He has gifted me spikes, clothes, mobiles ‚Äî but this was something else. It was precious,"" he recalls.Even before IPL 2025, Shubman‚Äôs eyes were set on the five-Test series against England. With Khushpreet Singh Aulakh, his mentor and childhood friend, around, he also needed someone who could challenge him with the red ball. Avinash had a reputation for troubling Punjab batters during Ranji seasons.""It was KP paaji‚Äôs idea. He told Shubman to start practising with the red ball during the IPL itself. KP paaji has invested his entire life in Shubman. He has worked tirelessly on him.""When I joined the Titans, Shubman instructed me to challenge him at the nets with the red ball. I started doing it. With the red ball, I make life difficult for batters. With the white ball, throwers give batters confidence to hit, but with the red ball, it‚Äôs a battle,"" Avinash says.Avinash bent his back in the nets, and it helped Shubman amass 754 runs in England.Avinash doesn‚Äôt want credit. ""It is all his hard work. I‚Äôve given him so many bruises but he never complained. His father first, and then KP paaji‚Äîthese two have made Shubman what he is today,"" he says.""Maine kya kiya bas usko knocking karwayi (I only helped him with the knocking). For what his father has done for me and my family, I will always be indebted,"" he says.At his father‚Äôs cart, meeting Shubman was a blessing for Avinash. He now considers the Gills his own family. At that cart, Shubman found not just juice‚Äîbut a lifelong friend and confidante.",Avinash Kumar used to be a fast bowler and trained at the ground behind the Mohali Stadium. Avinash would earn Rs 150‚Äì200 per day but he personally never took a penny from Shubman or his father. Lakhwinder paaji was angry.

NHL trade rumors: Is Sidney Crosby headed to Montreal Canadiens in a major trade involving top prospects?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-is-sidney-crosby-headed-to-montreal-canadiens-in-a-major-trade-involving-top-prospects/articleshow/123808410.cms,"Sidney Crosby, Pittsburgh Penguins (Jess Starr/The Hockey Writers)

Why Sidney Crosby to Canadiens trade is under serious debate

Is Sidney Crosby still the game-changer Montreal needs?

Speculation about Sidney Crosby‚Äôs future in the NHL is heating up once again. With two years left on his $17.4 million contract, and after the Pittsburgh Penguins finished near the bottom of the Metropolitan Division last season, trade rumors surrounding the veteran star have gained momentum. His recent game-winning performance for Team Canada at the 4 Nations Face-Off further fueled questions about whether Crosby‚Äôs next chapter could be with a Canadian franchise like the Montreal Canadiens.On TSN‚Äôs FanDuel OverDrive, analysts Bryan Hayes, Jeff O‚ÄôNeill, and Jamie McLennan debated what a potential trade package might include. O‚ÄôNeill argued that the deal ‚Äúprobably starts with Lane Hutson or something,‚Äù suggesting the Canadiens could offer top-tier prospects. McLennan countered by emphasizing that draft picks and prospects would likely play a bigger role than established young stars. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs somebody on their live roster that is playing. Like it‚Äôs not Demidov,‚Äù he said.Despite differing opinions, Hayes pointed out that cap space wouldn‚Äôt be a hurdle, noting Montreal had already cleared $10.5 million in space. The conversation became more pointed when Hayes asked, ‚ÄúWould you do Demidov straight up for Sid right now?‚Äù O‚ÄôNeill replied without hesitation, ‚ÄúOf course.To bring in Sidney Crosby into the fold, to get a couple of years out of him.‚ÄùAt 38 years old, Crosby remains remarkably productive, having scored 31 goals and 84 points in 80 games last season. However, McLennan questioned whether Montreal is realistically positioned to contend for a Stanley Cup in Crosby‚Äôs remaining elite window, stating, ‚ÄúIs Montreal a Cup winner in two years? I don‚Äôt see that.‚ÄùAlso Read: Brad Marchand could finish his career with Anaheim Ducks despite Florida Panthers deal, predicts NHL analyst As the Canadiens aim to build on their recent playoff return, this debate highlights the tough decisions teams face when balancing immediate star power with long-term development.",Sidney Crosby has two years left on his $17.4 million contract.

Aaron Rodgers admits back tightness affected his performance

Aaron Rodgers‚Äô focus now shifts to recovery and improving mobility

Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers opened up about dealing with persistent back tightness following the team‚Äôs narrow 20-17 victory over the New York Jets on Sunday, September 7. Rodgers admitted that the discomfort affected his mobility in the pocket and contributed to multiple sacks during the game, raising concerns about his physical health early in the NFL season.During a candid postgame interview, Aaron Rodgers explained how the back tightness limited his ability to escape pressure. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I was moving that well,‚Äù Rodgers said. ‚ÄúI think I ran, kind of, into at least one or two sacks. So I‚Äôve gotta do a better job of using my legs. I might be old, but I still feel like I can move around pretty good and I wasn‚Äôt moving the way I usually like to move.‚ÄùDespite the setbacks, Rodgers remained confident in the Steelers‚Äô offensive line, especially rookie Broderick Jones. Rodgers praised Jones‚Äôs attitude and dedication, saying, ‚ÄúI really like Brod. I‚Äôve gotten to know him during training camp. I like what he‚Äôs about.I like his attitude. He‚Äôs a genuinely positive guy. I‚Äôve got a lot of confidence in him watching my back.‚ÄùIn the aftermath of the game, Rodgers prioritized recovery efforts, undergoing massages and ice baths on Monday and Tuesday. He was careful to avoid taking too many hits during the game, which he believes helped him avoid more serious injury.Looking ahead, Rodgers emphasized the need to improve his mobility as essential for minimizing pressure from opposing defenses. He acknowledged that while the offensive line provided solid protection for the most part, his own physical limitations played a role in the sacks he took. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a couple fundamental things to clean up. Pat [Meyer]‚Äôs gonna take care of those guys. I‚Äôve just gotta get the ball out,‚Äù he said.Also Read: Why Aaron Rodgers prefers to keep his marriage to Brittani out of the public spotlight As the Steelers aim to build momentum this season, all eyes will be on Rodgers‚Äôs health and ability to stay mobile under increasing defensive pressure.

Turki Al-Sheikh hints at WrestleMania 43 in Saudi Arabia

WWE‚Äôs global push and TKO‚Äôs strategy



For the first time in history, WWE is preparing to take WrestleMania outside of North America. Multiple reports now point to Saudi Arabia as the confirmed host of WrestleMania 43 in 2027, marking a landmark moment in the company‚Äôs global expansion. While the announcement hasn‚Äôt been formally made by WWE, sources close to the situation insist it‚Äôs already a done deal.The speculation gained traction after Turki Al-Sheikh, Saudi Arabia‚Äôs Minister and Chairman of the General Entertainment Authority, appeared on Snapchat this week and addressed the subject directly. In a rough translation of his comments, he stated: ‚ÄúWrestleMania has been announced, for the first time outside of America, WrestleMania in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 2027.‚ÄùAn Arabic press release briefly went live before being pulled, fueling further buzz. Mike Johnson of PWInsider.com noted, ‚ÄúThe story is 100% legitimate and an announcement is coming very soon.‚Äù The sudden slip-up left fans buzzing, with insiders suggesting the reveal was mistakenly sent ahead of schedule.The move follows years of speculation. WWE and Saudi Arabia signed a major partnership in 2018, later extended to bring two Premium Live Events to the Kingdom annually.That relationship has already produced high-profile shows like Crown Jewel and, more recently, the historic announcement that Riyadh will host the 2026 Royal Rumble.Beyond the spectacle, WrestleMania 43‚Äôs placement highlights a new strategy under WWE‚Äôs parent company, TKO Group. Executives have been open about pursuing site fees in the same style as Formula 1, inviting cities and nations into bidding wars for WWE‚Äôs marquee events. At a recent investor event, TKO President Mark Shapiro was blunt about the model: ‚ÄúMost important to me is cash. You know, cash. Cash kills.‚ÄùBy securing WrestleMania 43, Saudi Arabia strengthens its growing role in global sports entertainment. With the 2026 Royal Rumble and now the company‚Äôs biggest annual show confirmed within a 14-month window, WWE is locking its most significant properties into the Kingdom. Fans worldwide now wait for WWE‚Äôs official confirmation, but the stage already seems set for a historic spectacle in 2027.Also Read: Wrestling star Odyssey Jones filed subpoenas for WWE, police, and social media records in lawsuit against ex-girlfriend","WrestleMania 43 is reportedly happening in Saudi Arabia in 2027.

Let‚Äôs gauge through the emotions each of these women went through when they were in a relationship with the Ayahuasca Retreat lover, Aaron Rodgers.Shailene Woodley described her relationship with former Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers in an interview with Melissa Johnson ofMagazine.actress said she had lost herself completely. She said she understood what anxiety and depression truly were. Her stylist, Kris Zero, would try her level best to keep theactress occupied, but she would feel depressed again.‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt shared much about my relationship with Aaron(Rodgers) because it always makes me cry. It was not right. But it was beautiful. I had a really awful, traumatic thing happen in early 2022.I felt like I lost my soul, my self, my happiness, my joy. I really understood depression and anxiety, and like, complete soul detachment.‚ÄùShe chose to remain in a toxic situation because she was empathizing with someone else.‚ÄúEmpathy kind of kept me in this loop of feeling everything for everyone. I knew I was depressed when I looked at a tree and felt nothing. That was the lowest low of my life.‚ÄùShailene Woodley‚Äôs stylist, Kris Zero, would wake her up with blasting music just to get her out of bed. ‚ÄúSometimes I was so angry at her. But then we‚Äôd go surf, and for ten minutes that day, I thought life could be okay again.Then the depression would come back, and she‚Äôd out‚ÄìWe‚Äôre volunteering at the horse ranch! ‚Äì and we‚Äôd find a random f*cking horse ranch and we‚Äôd clean up horse sh*t.We‚Äôd clean hooves and brush the horses, and for 20 minutes that day, I thought like could be okay again. And then depression came back, and she‚Äôd wake up the next morning and go‚ÄìLet‚Äôs go on a hike and bring trash bags and clean up trash!‚ÄùMelissa reported that after about six months, the depression started to fade.Olivia Munn, theactress, appeared on thepodcast, where she talked about a past relationship in which she felt trapped in a tumultuous family dynamic. She said that her therapist encouraged her to stay in the relationship that she wanted to get out of.‚ÄúI had a therapist who I really loved, and I know that she cared about me, or at least I thought she did. I would constantly, from the very beginning, say‚ÄìI don‚Äôt know about this, I don‚Äôt think this is the right(relationship), I want to get out. I gotta get out,‚Äù Munn said.Theactress said her therapist encouraged her to stay in that relationship. ‚ÄúShe thought that my ‚Äòpicker‚Äô was off, and she would look at it as: this person on paper looked great. And when there was couples therapy, they knew how to present the right way. Then the stories I would tell seemed unbelievable.From that experience, learning that I gotta go with my gut and I gotta be decisive with some things if it‚Äôs coming from a place where I want to survive, and I realize that I‚Äôm not happy, and that days and weeks and months go by of unhappiness and fear.I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a word to describe what that relationship was like. It was without a doubt the hardest period of my life, being in that,‚Äù she said she felt ‚Äúreally trapped in a tumultuous family dynamic.‚ÄùMunn further said that the relationship taught her to stand up for herself. ‚ÄúIt taught me how to stand up and fight for myself, so that was great. I truly had no idea that I could be manipulated and hurt that way, that I wouldn‚Äôt just get out of something that was dangerous to my psyche.It‚Äôs not just the period that you‚Äôre with the person, but, if you‚Äôre lucky to get out, (it‚Äôs) the years of healing yourself afterwards,‚Äù Munn told Lewinsky.She further shared, ‚ÄúThe catalyst was getting out of a relationship that had drained me and left me just really...it's hard, I don't know if there's a word to describe it what that relationship was like...it was, without a doubt, the hardest period of my life, being in that.‚ÄùDanica Patrick, the former professional racing driver and model, appeared onpodcast, where she disclosed that she was in an emotionally abusive relationship with the 41-year-old quarterback, Aaron Rodgers.‚ÄúThe breakup with Aaron(Rodgers) in 2020‚Äîbecause it was sudden, it felt like it was my life. When you live with somebody, it‚Äôs your whole life‚Äîyour dentist appointments, your hairdo, your clothes, your mailing address, everything. Because the nature of the relationship was emotionally abusive, it wore me down to nothing.Something that people could never imagine is that I would lack any confidence or belief in the simple things about who I am. Everything was torn to bits.He leaves a trail of blood. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm saying too much earth-shattering stuff; there‚Äôs been enough out there.But it gave me the greatest gift, which was myself‚Äîhow much I needed to show up for myself, take care of myself,‚Äù Patrick told Sage Steele.The former IndyCar Series and NASCAR driver said she felt like she was built for hard things when she was in a relationship with Rodgers,‚ÄúHindsight, I ignored it(emotionally abusive relationship), but in real life, it was just like, I would say all the time‚ÄîI‚Äôm built for hard things. I can handle hard things. And so, I just saw it as a hard thing, and my nature is to try harder and do more.What if I don't do it for the right person? What if I get too proud and go like‚ÄîI'm just I'm done. Instead of going‚ÄîMan, just try a little harder. What if you look back and think‚ÄîMan, I wish I would have tried. I would never want that in my life. I wish I would have tried.

Hockey Canada sexual assault: NHL expected to decide soon on future of five players acquitted in high-profile case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/hockey-canada-sexual-assault-nhl-expected-to-decide-soon-on-future-of-five-players-acquitted-in-high-profile-case/articleshow/123808562.cms,"Michael McLeod, Alex Formenton, Carter Hart, Dillon Dube, Cal Foote (Image via Reuters)

Why the NHL‚Äôs decision matters for players and hockey‚Äôs image

The path ahead for the players and the league

The NHL is preparing to make a decision in the ‚Äúrelatively near future‚Äù on the status of five former Hockey Canada players acquitted in a high-profile sexual assault case. Michael McLeod, Carter Hart, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dube, and Callan Foote were all cleared of charges in July following a trial that captured national attention and reignited discussions about consent and hockey culture in Canada.Despite their acquittal, the five players remain ineligible to play in the NHL while the league continues its internal review. NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly told reporters at the NHL/NHLPA media tour in Las Vegas that ‚Äúthe matter is taken very seriously, and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs still under review.‚Äù The delay has left the players in a state of uncertainty, unable to resume their professional careers in North America. Meanwhile, Hockey Canada continues to suspend them from all sanctioned activities.This situation has broader implications for the sport, as the trial renewed public debate about how hockey institutions handle issues of accountability and culture. The case, which dates back to a hotel room encounter in June 2018, involved many members of Canada‚Äôs gold-medal-winning world junior hockey team. The lengthy legal process came to an end more than seven years later, but the public and league response remain highly scrutinized.Some of the players, including McLeod, Dube, and Foote, spent recent seasons playing in the KHL, while Alex Formenton recently joined a Swiss top league team. Carter Hart, a former Flyers star goaltender, has not played since the 2023-24 NHL season. As the NHL prepares to finalize its decision, many await whether these players will be able to return to the league or continue their careers overseas.Also Read: ‚ÄúHe would leave Edmonton‚Äù: Analyst sparks debate by claiming Toronto Maple Leafs could steal Connor McDavid from Oilers Bill Daly reiterated that ‚Äúa decision is expected soon,‚Äù as the league seeks to balance justice, player welfare, and its reputation amid ongoing public scrutiny.","The NHL is preparing to make a decision in the ‚Äúrelatively near future‚Äù on the status of five former Hockey Canada players acquitted in a high-profile sexual assault case.

It was not a usual afternoon as hundreds of people gathered at Utah Univeristy for Charlie Kirk's signature ""Prove Me Wrong"" debates. Everyone was paying attention to Kirk's speech, who, during his last moment, was responding to a question about transgender mass shooting suspects.It began as a heated campus debate but turned into a scene of terror on Wednesday when US President Donald Trump's ally and right-wing activist Charlie Kirk was shot during the event at Utah University. Witnesses recalled that the single gunshot that hit Kirk's neck set off a chain reaction of fear, confusion and chaos.According to The New York Times, 28-year-old Andrew Piskadlo was eagerly waiting for his turn to challenge Kirk on the Eight Amendment when the shot rang.""It was surprising, and no one really got down until the people in front of the stage did,"" he said, who was about 80 feet away from Kirk. ""People got down in waves.""Brandon Russon, 24, a student at Ensign College, described a split second of disbelief.""I just saw Charlie kind of slump backwards, and I saw ‚Äî it was very graphic ‚Äî a lot of blood,"" he recalled. ""At first I wondered if it was some kind of act, because he was literally being asked about mass shootings.But within a second, I knew it was real,"" he told New York Times.Russon, who was 20 feet away from Kirk, said that he stayed crouched on the ground for about a minute, fearing more bullets were coming. ""I texted my wife to tell her I loved her,"" he said. ""Then I grabbed my friend and ran.""For Zachary Morris, a registered nurse from Lehi, the first instinct was to protect his 3-year-old daughter.""I reached down, grabbed my daughter and my phone, and began to run,"" he told New York Times. ""All I could think was that I gotta get her out of there,"" he added.Others described the confusion spreading as quickly as the fear. Isaac Davis, a junior at UVU, said the gunfire didn't sound like what he expected.""It wasn't that loud ‚Äî almost like a firecracker,"" he said. ""But once people started screaming, it turned into hysteria. We got pushed into a classroom to hide. I just didn't want to be in the building while everything was going on, so I ran out.""Witnesses recalled that waves of fear rippled across as hundreds scrambled for cover. Some ducked under seats. Others sprinted for nearby buildings. Parents clutching children, strangers pulling each other toward safety ‚Äî the amphitheatre was suddenly a place of survival, not debate.What lingered afterwards for many wasn't just the shock, but the sense that the danger could have been avoided.

India Asia Cup prediction: Why bad news could be in store for India | Greenstone Lobo predicts

Speaking to TimesofIndia.com ahead of India‚Äôs Asia Cup 2025 opener, astrologer Greenstone Lobo offered an intriguing perspective on the tournament‚Äôs likely outcome.While India are widely seen as the overwhelming favourites, Lobo explained why predicting winners of smaller tournaments can be more complex than forecasting World Cups.‚ÄúWhen we talk about winning tournaments, predicting a major tournament like a World Cup is actually easier. But it becomes a little more difficult to predict which team will win an IPL or a T20 World Cup. And it‚Äôs even more difficult to predict a smaller tournament like an Asia Cup,‚Äù Lobo said.According to him, the difference lies in horoscopes. Captains with the strongest charts usually succeed in the biggest competitions, while those with ‚Äúslightly lesser horoscopes‚Äù can still triumph in smaller tournaments. ‚ÄúThat is where it gets tricky and interesting,‚Äù he noted.Turning to the present edition, Lobo highlighted Suryakumar Yadav‚Äôs leadership as a major positive.‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got a phenomenal chart. Pluto is in nascent exaltation, Neptune is very powerful. Planet Z is in its own house. That‚Äôs a very strong indication he‚Äôs going to do well,‚Äù he said, calling the Suryakumar‚ÄìGautam Gambhir combination ‚Äúan extremely powerful team and a big proposition for winning the T20 World Cup.‚ÄùYet, Lobo warned that this strength could ironically make the Asia Cup a ‚Äúbanana peel"".He pointed to Pakistan‚Äôs new T20I captain Salman Ali Agha, born in 1993, as a serious contender: ‚ÄúHe has got a phenomenal chart. If it comes between Surya and Salman, Sky has a higher chance to win the T20 World Cup, which means Salman can win a smaller tournament like the Asia Cup.‚ÄùHe also mentioned Sri Lanka, under Charith Asalanka, and Afghanistan, led by Rashid Khan, as potential surprises.‚ÄúIndia, yes, we are the firm favourites, even astrologically,‚Äù Lobo concluded, ‚Äúbut we are not the only favourites. Pakistan, Afghanistan, even Sri Lanka‚Äîthey all have strong chances.‚Äù",Greenstone Lobo predicts India will win the Asia Cup 2025.

He drew attention to the men's tennis U.S. Open final in New York on Sunday, September 7, 2025, where Donald Trump's unexpected entrance delayed the match for almost 50 minutes. Donald stated he hopes the PGA of America will take something from that encounter and keep the Ryder Cup going.Luke Donald reminded reporters that Trump is expected to be on the first tee when the Ryder Cup begins on Friday, September 26, 2025, at Bethpage Black. He said,The concern comes after Donald Trump caused disruption at the U.S. Open men‚Äôs final in New York on September 7. Security around Arthur Ashe Stadium forced hundreds of fans to wait in long lines.The final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, which was supposed to start at 2 p.m. local time, began at 2:49 p.m. Many fans missed the opening games because of the extra checks.Luke Donald said the Ryder Cup crowd will be even bigger, with more than 50,000 people expected daily, so it is very important that organizers avoid a similar problem.Donald explained.Reports this week said Ryder Cup organizers have asked Trump to arrive later in the day, maybe around lunchtime or in the afternoon, instead of being at the opening tee.

Elizabeth Tsurkov‚Äôs ordeal: Kidnapped in Baghdad, freed after 903 days

Academic and human rights contributions

The significance of her release







Elizabeth Tsurkov, a determined Israeli-Russian graduate student and human rights advocate, has finally been freed after enduring 903 days in the captivity of Hezbollah in Iraq. Her ordeal, which began in March 2023 while she was conducting field research for Princeton University, tested her resilience and courage in unimaginable ways. Tsurkov‚Äôs steadfast commitment to her work, even in the face of prolonged detention and harsh conditions, exemplifies remarkable bravery and perseverance. Her release is not only a triumph for her and her family but also a condemnation of the tyranny and violence wielded by militant groups who seek to silence voices dedicated to knowledge and human rights.Tsurkov entered Iraq using her Russian passport to carry out research for her doctoral dissertation. On March 21, 2023, she was abducted in Baghdad‚Äôs Karrada district by Kata‚Äôib Hezbollah after attempting to meet members of the Alwani family, including a senior militia official. A video of Tsurkov was later broadcast on Iraqi television in November 2023, confirming she was alive. During her captivity, her life and safety were under constant threat, drawing attention from governments, human rights organizations, and academic institutions worldwide.Tsurkov‚Äôs release came after prolonged negotiations involving the US, Iraq, and advocacy groups. Her family, particularly her sister Emma Tsurkov, tirelessly campaigned for her freedom, engaging with global organizations and policymakers to ensure Elizabeth‚Äôs safety. US authorities, the Global Reach nonprofit, and officials at the US Embassy in Baghdad played pivotal roles in facilitating her return, demonstrating the power of international advocacy and diplomacy in confronting injustice.Elizabeth Tsurkov, 37, is a Princeton University doctoral student and a fellow at the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy. Her research focuses on Iraq and the broader Middle East, highlighting human rights, governance, and social justice. During her time in Iraq, she was known for her commitment to academic integrity and raising awareness of vulnerable communities, reflecting her courage not only in the field but also in confronting the broader challenges posed by conflict and oppression.Tsurkov‚Äôs release is a moment of celebration for her family, colleagues, and the academic community. It underscores the importance of defending scholars, journalists, and researchers working in dangerous environments. At the same time, it serves as a stark reminder of the cruelty of militant groups like Kata‚Äôib Hezbollah, who employ violence and intimidation to suppress independent thought and human rights advocacy. Her return to safety marks both a personal victory and a moral repudiation of those who wield terror to silence truth.","Elizabeth Tsurkov, 37, is a Princeton University doctoral student and a fellow at the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy.

The Ronaldo effect

Unreal Calendar





Cristiano Ronaldo isn‚Äôt just playing football in Saudi Arabia anymore, he‚Äôs living a future he didn‚Äôt see coming. As the face of the Saudi Tourism Authority‚Äôs new global campaign,, Ronaldo now stands at the intersection of sport, culture, and national transformation. From signing a contract extension with Al Nassr to pledging to make the Kingdom his permanent home, the 40-year-old legend is not just in Saudi for goals, he‚Äôs here for good. And in doing so, he has become the living emblem of Vision 2030‚Äôs soaring ambitions.Unveiled with Cristiano Ronaldo at its center, theis more than a marketing initiative,it‚Äôs Saudi Arabia‚Äôs open invitation to the world. With the taglinethe campaign stretches across digital screens, TV spots, and global social media, targeting key markets like Europe, India, and China.The cinematic visuals show Ronaldo stepping out from monochrome shadows into vibrant color‚Äîsymbolizing his journey from footballer to cultural ambassador. ‚ÄúWhat I admire most about Saudi is how it honors its roots while building for the future,‚Äù he says, anchoring the campaign‚Äôs ethos in both heritage and ambition.The calendar spans the cultural and geographic breadth of Saudi Arabia, with a year-round lineup of events in Riyadh, Jeddah, and AlUl, ranging from elite sports and global entertainment to wellness retreats, fashion showcases, and arts festivals.Saudi Arabia is no longer positioning itself as a fleeting attraction; it‚Äôs staking its claim as a permanent fixture on the global map of experience-led travel.In a heartfelt interview released via Al Nassr‚Äôs official YouTube channel, Ronaldo gave his most definitive statement yet about life after football. ‚ÄúMy family always supports my decisions, and we‚Äôre happy here in Saudi Arabia. The people treat us in an incredibly warm way. That‚Äôs why we want to live here and build our lives here,‚Äù he said.The Portuguese icon, who turned 40 earlier this year, confirmed he intends to remain in the Kingdom long after he hangs up his boots. ‚ÄúI will stay two more years as a football player, but also for life because my contribution to this country is not only for football. I want to be part of the country‚Äôs growth forever.‚ÄùHis contract extension until 2027, announced by Al Nassr in June, sees him playing until at least age 42. Since his arrival in late 2022 following his dramatic departure from Manchester United, Ronaldo has scored a staggering 101 goals across all competitions, redefining expectations for an athlete in his fourth decade.To Ronaldo, Saudi Arabia is more than a league. It‚Äôs a ""land of peace and safety,"" a phrase he used to describe his family‚Äôs comfort in the country.

History isn‚Äôt always about kings, battles, and dusty treaties, sometimes it‚Äôs about the really weird stuff. Think of it as history‚Äôs ‚ÄúX-Files‚Äù: moments when reality cracked open just enough to let in a flood of mystery, confusion, and conspiracy theories. From towns that literally danced themselves into exhaustion, to ships sailing eerily without their crews, to a Swiss watch found centuries before Switzerland even made watches, the past is full of oddities that make even the most skeptical eyebrow twitch.These aren‚Äôt just quirky footnotes; they‚Äôre stories that have baffled historians, inspired endless theories, and fueled late-night debates about time travelers, parallel universes, and ghostly forces. Whether it‚Äôs a book that tried to rewrite European history, or a traveler who showed up with a passport from a country that doesn‚Äôt exist, each tale invites us to ask: how much of history is fact, and how much is just wonderfully, deliciously strange?Imagine walking into Strasbourg in July 1518, expecting the usual bustle of market stalls and chatter, only to be confronted with a scene straight out of a fever dream. Men and women fill the square, leaping, twirling, and stomping in a frenzy that has nothing of joy about it. Their limbs jerk out of rhythm, their faces are pale and strained, and the sound of pipes and drums only fuels their uncontrollable movements. What looks at first like a street festival quickly reveals itself as something far darker ‚Äî a plague of dance.These so-called ‚Äúchoreomaniacs‚Äù were not celebrating but suffering.For days, even weeks, they danced without pause, some collapsing from exhaustion, others bleeding through their shoes, a few even dancing themselves to death. The people of Strasbourg didn‚Äôt know if they were witnessing a curse, divine punishment, or mass hysteria ‚Äî only that the city had been seized by a force no one could understand. Five centuries later, the ‚Äúdancing plague‚Äù remains one of history‚Äôs strangest and most unsettling mysteries.Picture Boston‚Äôs North End on a chilly January day in 1919. Looming over Commercial Street was a steel giant ‚Äî a 50-foot-tall holding tank brimming with sticky, dark molasses. The tank belonged to the United States Industrial Alcohol Company, which shipped in molasses from the Caribbean and transformed it into alcohol for liquor and, more pressingly at the time, for munitions. Built just a few years earlier, in the thick of World War I, the tank was a monument to speed over care, thrown together in haste to meet surging demand.From the outside, it seemed solid enough ‚Äî a towering symbol of industry and profit. But beneath its riveted steel walls lay a dangerous truth: the tank had been poorly constructed, plagued by leaks and shortcuts from the start. No one could yet imagine that this looming vessel of syrupy sweetness would soon unleash one of Boston‚Äôs most bizarre and deadly disasters, remembered forever as the Great Molasses Flood.Imagine waking up on a summer morning in 1908 in the Siberian wilderness ‚Äî only to see the sky burst into flame. Locals described a blinding fireball racing across the horizon, followed by a thunderous explosion that flattened trees for miles and sparked massive forest fires. This was the Tunguska event, when an asteroid plunged into Earth‚Äôs atmosphere and detonated high above the ground. Because the region was so remote, news barely spread beyond Tsarist Russia, and it took nearly two decades before scientists finally reached the site. By then, the evidence was still undeniable: the shock wave and heat blast from the explosion had scarred the land on a staggering scale.What happened in Siberia wasn‚Äôt unique ‚Äî history and archaeology suggest Earth has faced similar cosmic intrusions before, and smaller asteroids regularly burn up in the atmosphere without consequence. But the Tunguska explosion was a stark reminder of how vulnerable our planet can be. That‚Äôs why today, organizations like Nasa are preparing for the next big one. With its Planetary Defense Coordination Office and projects like the DART mission ‚Äî which successfully tested redirecting a small asteroid ‚Äî humanity is, for the first time, learning how to nudge space rocks off course. The question is, when the next Tunguska-sized visitor arrives, will we be ready?In January 1959, ten young hikers set off on a winter expedition through Russia‚Äôs remote Ural Mountains. Within days, one had turned back due to illness, but the remaining nine pressed on. When no word came back to their sports club by late February, a search party was dispatched. What rescuers eventually found was chilling: five bodies scattered in the snow, some barely clothed despite the freezing conditions, others bearing strange wounds ‚Äî including one man who appeared to have gnawed off part of his own knuckle.As the snow thawed months later, the rest of the group was discovered, and their injuries were even more disturbing. One had a shattered skull, another a twisted neck, and two were missing their eyes. A woman was found without eyes and with her tongue removed. The grotesque details fueled decades of speculation. From avalanches and infrasound-induced panic to covert weapons testing ‚Äî and even attacks by yetis ‚Äî the Dyatlov Pass incident has resisted definitive explanation, leaving it one of the most haunting mysteries of the 20th century.In several parts of Europe during the Middle Ages, communities were suddenly struck by outbreaks of mass dancing. Entire towns would take to the streets, with people convulsing, leaping, and whirling uncontrollably for hours, days, or even weeks. Witnesses described dancers collapsing from exhaustion, sometimes even dying, as if gripped by an unstoppable force.Historians have long debated what caused these bizarre ‚Äúdancing plagues.‚Äù Some point to mass hysteria brought on by famine, disease, and social unrest. Others suspect ergot poisoning from contaminated bread, which could have triggered hallucinations. Whatever the explanation, the phenomenon left an eerie mark on European history, a reminder of how fragile the human mind can be under collective strain.In 2008, Chinese archaeologists claimed to have stumbled upon a startling discovery: inside a sealed 400-year-old tomb in Shangsi County, Guangxi, they found what looked like a tiny Swiss watch. The object, shaped like a ring with ‚ÄúSwiss‚Äù engraved on its back, appeared oddly modern despite being buried centuries before Switzerland was even producing such items.The strange find immediately sparked speculation about time travel and alternate timelines. Skeptics dismissed it as a misplaced trinket or a hoax, but conspiracy theorists saw it as proof of visitors from the future. While the watch was never conclusively explained, the tale has endured as one of the most intriguing ‚Äúout of place artifacts‚Äù in modern archaeology.In 1954, Tokyo airport officials were baffled when a man arrived carrying a passport from a country that didn‚Äôt exist: Taured. The passport looked authentic, complete with stamps from previous travels, yet no one had ever heard of the nation. When asked, the traveler insisted Taured was located between France and Spain ‚Äî a region occupied by Andorra on our maps.Authorities detained the man in a hotel room while they investigated. Yet by the next morning, he had vanished without a trace, along with his mysterious documents. To this day, the ‚ÄúMan from Taured‚Äù fuels theories ranging from parallel universes to government cover-ups. The case remains one of the strangest unsolved puzzles in travel history.On December 4, 1872, sailors spotted the merchant shipdrifting silently in the Atlantic Ocean. When they boarded, they found the vessel fully intact: cargo untouched, provisions stocked, and no signs of violence. Yet the captain, his family, and the entire crew had vanished without explanation.The fate of the‚Äôs crew has inspired endless theories. Some argue they abandoned ship after fearing an explosion from the alcohol cargo. Others point to pirates, seaquakes, or even supernatural intervention. With no definitive evidence, the story of the ghost ship endures as one of maritime history‚Äôs most chilling mysteries.In the 19th century, a manuscript surfaced in the Netherlands claiming to be an ancient chronicle of a forgotten European civilization. Known as theit described a powerful people who influenced world history thousands of years ago, rewriting the origins of Western culture.Initially hailed by some as a groundbreaking discovery, the manuscript was later exposed as a hoax, likely crafted in the 1800s. Yet its mix of mythology, pseudo-history, and nationalistic undertones gave it a lasting influence, inspiring occultists, fringe historians, and even Nazi ideologues. Today, it stands as a cautionary tale about how fabricated history can shape real-world beliefs.","History is full of oddities that make even the most skeptical eyebrow twitch.

"Prince Philip‚Äôs blunt warning to Kate Middleton on royal life: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not a celebrity‚Äô; report reveals why he told her, ‚ÄòNever look at camera‚Äô",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/prince-philips-blunt-warning-to-kate-middleton-on-royal-life-youre-not-a-celebrity-report-reveals-why-he-told-her-never-look-at-camera/articleshow/123662014.cms,"



Prince Philip once offered Kate Middleton a blunt piece of advice that has since shaped her path as a senior royal: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a celebrity. You represent the royal family.‚ÄùThe revelation comes from Gyles Brandreth‚Äôs 2021 biography ‚ÄúPhilip: The Final Portrait,‚Äù recently revisited by Hello! magazine. According to the book, the Duke of Edinburgh cautioned the then-new royal against treating her public role like stardom, warning her that personal attention could lead to trouble.""If you think the attention is on you personally, you‚Äôll end up in trouble,"" Philip told her. ""The focus is on your role, what you do, what you support. It‚Äôs not focused on you as an individual.""He even shared a practical ‚Äúgolden rule‚Äù: avoid looking at cameras during engagements. Instead, Philip explained, Queen Elizabeth II always directed her gaze toward the person she was speaking to, never the photographers.Royal commentators say this guidance proved pivotal. Broadcaster Helena Chard told Fox News Digital that Philip‚Äôs mentorship helped Kate weather media storms with dignity. ‚ÄúShe was taught by the best‚Ä¶ her humility and discretion, combined with Philip‚Äôs advice, have given her the strength to breeze through challenges,‚Äù Chard said.Fellow royal expert Hilary Fordwich agreed, noting that Kate naturally embraced tradition, service, and stability. ‚ÄúHe made it blatantly clear that royalty and celebrity are two completely different things,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why she avoids seeking attention for personal fame.‚ÄùPhilip, who supported Queen Elizabeth II for more than 70 years, reportedly admired Kate‚Äôs level-headedness and was relieved Prince William had found such a partner. Biographer Penny Junor once told the Daily Mail that despite her non-aristocratic background, Kate adapted seamlessly to palace life.""Kate shines in her own light, but she knows her place in the royal family,"" Junor said. ""I think Kate is a bit like Prince Philip, who has always supported Queen Elizabeth II.""","Prince Philip once told Kate Middleton: ""You're not a celebrity.

CAIRNS: Three Scottish brothers stepped ashore in Australia on Saturday after claiming a new record for rowing non-stop and unsupported across the Pacific Ocean, ""over the moon"" to be back on dry land.Ewan, Jamie and Lachlan MacLean set off in a carbon fibre dinghy from Lima in Peru in April for the 14,500 kilometres journey, enduring violent storms and sickness during their 139 days at sea.At one point Ewan was swept overboard before being pulled back into the boat, while they battled exhaustion and feared running out of food. ""The fastest human-powered crossing of the full Pacific Ocean, non-stop and unsupported,"" they said on social media after arriving in Cairns. ""After 139 days at sea, we are over the moon to be back on land with our friends and family,"" they added.The brothers, from Edinburgh, were given a bagpipe welcome in front of family and friends after the treacherous ordeal, which garnered support from celebrities including Mark Wahlberg and Ewan McGregor. ""Things got tough towards the end and we seriously thought we might run out of food,"" said middle brother Jamie.""Despite how exhausted we were, we had to step up a gear and make it before supplies ran out, but now we get to eat proper food. ""While the mid-Pacific - from California to Hawaii - is well travelled, relatively few have attempted the full Pacific from South America to Australia. Lithuanian solo rower Aurimas Mockus had to abandon his crossing attempt this year due to Tropical Cyclone Alfred. ""This has been the hardest thing I've ever done, and I couldn't have even contemplated it without my brothers,"" said Ewan. ""There have been countless setbacks to overcome, some leaving us lost, but we've always lifted each other up. ""Days before landing in Cairns, brothers said they had to battle currents off the coast. ""We're going to be rowing three up as we navigate through the Great Barrier Reef and away from shipping lanes, all while fighting against horrendous winds,"" they said.The brothers were raising money for clean water projects in Madagascar. They broke three world records crossing the Atlantic Ocean in 2020, without ever having rowed professionally, making the journey from La Gomera in Canary Islands to Antigua in 35 days.","Ewan, Jamie and Lachlan MacLean set off in a carbon fibre dinghy from Lima in Peru in April.

Victoria police chief Del Manak retired on August 27 after serving 35 years with the Vancouver police department, marking a historic milestone as the first Indian-origin officer to become police chief in Canada. The City of Victoria commemorated his retirement by declaring August 27 as 'Del Manak Day' in recognition of his contributions to law enforcement and breaking barriers as the first person of color to lead the Victoria Police in its 168-year history.Manak began his law enforcement career with the Vancouver Police Department in 1990, steadily advancing through the ranks before assuming the role of Victoria's police chief in 2017. His appointment as chief marked a significant achievement for diversity in Canadian law enforcement.""When I joined the force, it wasn't easy. I had to struggle a lot, but I kept going and worked hard,"" Manak reflected on his journey in law enforcement.Born in 1964 in Vancouver, Manak's family history traces back to Punjab, India. He shared his family's migration story, connecting his roots to the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar district.""My father hailed from Banga, a historic town in the district. He migrated to Singapore, and later our family settled in Canada,"" Manak said, describing his family's journey to Canada.Throughout his career, Manak faced numerous challenges and memorable experiences in law enforcement. One significant incident occurred during his early days on the force.""There were also high-speed chases that tested us,"" he noted, recalling his experiences. He specifically mentioned one of his first assignments in 1992, responding to a nightclub shooting in Vancouver, where he secured the crime scene and coordinated with senior officers.During his tenure, Manak consistently advocated for improvements in the justice system, expressing concerns about repeat offenders.""It's disheartening when police arrest a criminal and within a month, they're out on bail, committing crimes again,"" he remarked, highlighting challenges within the criminal justice system.Manak emphasized the importance of addressing contemporary law enforcement challenges, particularly focusing on crime prevention and substance abuse issues. He stressed the necessity of enhanced rehabilitation programs to reduce repeat offenses.As for his retirement plans, Manak is taking time to consider his next steps. ""I have some job offers, but for now, I'm going to Europe for a month,"" he revealed, indicating his immediate post-retirement plans.",Del Manak is the first person of color to lead the Victoria Police in its 168-year history.

Barack Obama‚Äôs 2011 state visit to London left behind more than polished speeches and diplomatic handshakes, it also produced one of those dry, razor-sharp Queen Elizabeth II moments that courtiers and politicians never forgot.In Power and the Palace, a new book by royal author Valentine Low serialized in The Times, the late monarch is quoted asking then‚ÄìChancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to do the unthinkable: politely tell the President of the United States that it was time to call it a night.‚ÄúWill you tell President Obama it‚Äôs time to go to bed?‚Äù the Queen reportedly whispered to Osborne as the state banquet carried on past midnight.Osborne admits he froze. ‚ÄúI could see Obama surrounded by this big crowd. Am I supposed to go and tell him to go to bed?‚Äù he recalled. Ultimately, the Queen‚Äôs private secretary Christopher Geidt stepped in, assuring the flustered minister, ‚ÄúWe are handling the situation, Chancellor.‚ÄùThe anecdote paints a vivid picture of Elizabeth II‚Äôs sharp humor and no-nonsense pragmatism, qualities that defined her reign as much as her tiaras.Low‚Äôs book also delves into weightier matters, claiming the Queen once expressed quiet skepticism about Brexit, telling a minister, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better to stick with the devil you know.‚Äù But for many, it‚Äôs the image of the world‚Äôs most powerful woman, weary of late-night pleasantries, hinting that even the leader of the free world needed to mind the clock, that best captures her unmatched style.",Queen Elizabeth II reportedly asked then-Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to tell Barack Obama to go to bed.

The simmering tension between Prince Harry and Queen Camilla, long splashed across tabloids, has been reignited, but this time by someone unexpectedly in the middle of royal history.

From feud to a possible reunion: Is a royal homecoming for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle with children on the cards?

Prince Invites King Charles Amid Hopes Of Reunion

For years, the rift between the royal family and the Sussexes has been the stuff of palace whispers, glossy magazine covers, and endless ‚Äúsources close to‚Äù speculation. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have built a life on the other side of the Atlantic - swapping Buckingham Palace for Montecito mansions, royal duties for media deals, and the London fog for Californian sunshine. But is there a chance the family feud could finally ease? Some royal watchers say the door might just be creaking open.Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital that trust remains the sticking point. ‚ÄúI believe it to be totally correct that members of the royal family do not trust Meghan. And of course, she does not trust some members of the royal family in return,‚Äù he said.Still, Turner hinted that the narrative isn‚Äôt as black-and-white as it seems. ‚ÄúIf every member of the royal family doesn‚Äôt trust Meghan, then why did King Charles instigate a meeting with his senior advisor and that of Harry and Meghan‚Äôs team? Is it all the royal family, or is it perhaps William?‚ÄùOptimism, however, lingers. Turner hopes Harry, Meghan, and their children‚ÄîArchie and Lilibet‚Äîwill eventually be welcomed back ‚Äúwarmly‚Äù into the fold. Fellow commentator Ingrid Seward echoed the sentiment, telling Fox News Digital, ‚ÄúI feel that [this] won‚Äôt go on forever. I just feel that at some stage‚Ä¶ they will begin to come together.‚ÄùThat said, Seward was quick to admit that Meghan remains deeply unpopular with hardcore royalists.The speculation is being fueled further by Harry‚Äôs scheduled trip to the UK in September. According to PEOPLE!, he‚Äôs set to appear at a charity event for WellChild, which supports children with life-limiting conditions.Whether this visit sparks a reunion with King Charles remains to be seen, but it has reignited questions about the Sussexes‚Äô long-term ties to Britain.One factor pulling them back could be education.Former royal butler Grant Harrold told Style Caster that Harry may want Archie and Lilibet to experience the same schooling system he grew up with. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very likely and it‚Äôs completely possible‚Ä¶ But then it depends on how the relationship is with the rest of the family when the time comes.‚ÄùBut here‚Äôs the royal-sized hurdle: security. In ITV‚Äôs Tabloids on Trial, Harry admitted that safety concerns are the main reason Meghan avoids the UK. ‚ÄúThey are genuine concerns for me‚Ä¶ It's one of the reasons why I won‚Äôt bring my wife back to this country,‚Äù he said.A source close to him doubled down in Us Weekly: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll always be fond of his home country, but the way he views it, his wife and kids are his priority.‚Äù","Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner says trust remains the sticking point.
