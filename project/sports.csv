From gridiron greatness to emotional vulnerability



When public image collides with private battles



Even the most successful athletes face challenges that stats and accolades can’t capture—and Tom Brady is no exception. Widely regarded as the greatest quarterback in NFL history , Brady's legendary career boasts an unmatched seven Super Bowl titles, yet behind the shine of championship rings lies a more vulnerable, human side he’s beginning to share with the world.For two decades, Tom Brady maintained a laser focus on football, becoming the ultimate symbol of discipline and competitive excellence. But recently, the 46-year-old has revealed glimpses of his personal struggles, particularly in the wake of his divorce from supermodel Gisele Bündchen . Brady, who is usually tight-lipped about his private life, opened up about the emotional toll of navigating heartbreak, admitting he’s dealt with moments of “willful blindness.”This phrase—suggesting a conscious decision to ignore uncomfortable truths—points to the complexities Brady faced in his marriage’s unraveling. While he didn’t name names, the context was unmistakable, especially given recent headlines surrounding Bündchen's ongoing relationship with her jiu-jitsu trainer, who is now widely rumored to be her partner and the father figure in her children’s lives.“Willful blindness” is not just a phrase—it’s a powerful acknowledgment of emotional compromise. Brady’s reflection reveals the cost of chasing perfection on the field while personal issues simmer in the background. The quarterback, once seemingly invincible both in his career and family life, now speaks like someone reckoning with the pain of being left behind. For fans, it’s a rare and raw admission: the GOAT is still just a man.The emotional fallout of watching Gisele Bündchen move on publicly is undoubtedly difficult for someone so accustomed to control and success. Reports of her being seen with her new partner and children add emotional weight to Brady’s recent comments, suggesting a sense of betrayal or at least loss.Also Read: Fresh discussion on Tom Brady and Gisele’s Bündchen’s marriage reignites debate over missed red flags Tom Brady’s recent openness signals a shift—not just for him but for the culture surrounding sports icons.

The first night of WrestleMania 41 was a night filled with top-class in-ring action, spectacular moments and a shocking end.WrestleMania 41 kicked off its first night in the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas.

NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings (PBKS) return home brimming with confidence after clinically dismantling Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in a rain-shortened clash at the Chinnaswamy just two days ago. But as both sides gear up for the rematch in Match No. 37 of IPL 2025 at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium in New Chandigarh, the stakes are significantly higher.With five wins in eight matches, PBKS are sitting pretty in second place. Another win here would further solidify their playoff push. RCB, on the other hand, despite a strong start to the season, now find themselves slipping to fourth after back-to-back losses. They'll be desperate to stop the slide and regain momentum on what promises to be a spin-friendly track in Chandigarh.In Saturday’s 14-over rain-affected clash, PBKS executed their plans to perfection. Their bowlers, led by Marco Jansen (2/10), Yuzvendra Chahal, and Harpreet Brar, skittled RCB for just 95. Arshdeep Singh’s early double strike -- including the prized wicket of Virat Kohli -- set the tone.While RCB showed brief resistance through Tim David’s unbeaten 50, it wasn’t enough to mask a middle-order collapse. Punjab chased down the target with 11 balls to spare, thanks to a calm, match-winning knock from Nehal Wadhera, who remained unbeaten on 33 off 19.Wadhera, still new to IPL stardom, is now pushing for a regular middle-order spot -- especially with Shashank Singh and Josh Inglis yet to find form.RCB will want to brush off that defeat quickly, knowing they simply didn’t show up with the bat. Josh Hazlewood (3/14) and Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2/26) were bright spots with the ball, but RCB's batting fragility -- especially in the Powerplay -- has become a pattern.Phil Salt’s explosive starts haven’t lasted, while Kohli’s dismissal for just 1 in the last outing raised eyebrows. Captain Rajat Patidar is yet to truly stamp his authority, despite crossing 1000 IPL runs last game. They’ll hope Tim David can carry his late-innings form into a more prominent role.The big question for RCB is whether they stick with the same XI or ring in changes -- especially in spin, where PBKS clearly held the edge.The pitch in New Chandigarh is expected to play slow and low, especially in the second innings. Spinners have traditionally found grip here, making Harpreet Brar and Chahal crucial for Punjab. RCB, meanwhile, will likely rely on Suyash Sharma and Krunal Pandya to counter.If dew stays away in the evening, expect the toss to play a big role -- with both captains eyeing a chance to bowl first and exploit the early tackiness.The Maharaja Yadavindra Singh Stadium has favored spinners and slower bowlers this season. The dry surface tends to hold up, especially in the evening games, and scoring in the second innings hasn’t been easy. Anything above 160 could be competitive.Priyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh, Shreyas Iyer (c), Nehal Wadhera, Josh Inglis (wk), Marcus Stoinis, Shashank Singh, Marco Jansen, Harpreet Brar, Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep SinghXavier BartlettPhil Salt, Virat Kohli, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar (c), Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash DayalSuyash SharmaA warm and dry evening is expected with temperatures hovering around 34°C at match time.

Patrick and Brittany Mahomes share adorable family photo fans can’t stop talking about



The Mahomes family is known for their picture-perfect moments, but this Easter, they truly delivered a heartwarming surprise that had fans gushing. On April 19, Brittany Mahomes shared a carousel of festive Easter snapshots on Instagram, offering a rare glimpse into their life as a family of five. The post, captioned “He is Risen🙏🏻✝️ Happy Easter🤍,” instantly became a fan favorite — and for good reason.While Patrick Mahomes and Brittany have had no shortage of adorable family highlights, it was the long-awaited appearance of their youngest child, Golden Raye, that stole the spotlight. The family, dressed in soft pastel tones, posed joyfully, but all eyes were on baby Golden, making her debut in the most endearing way. Clad in a sweet all-pink ensemble, she mirrored her older sister Sterling’s outfit, sending fans into a frenzy over their twinning moment.Randi Mahomes , Patrick’s mother, added a personal touch by commenting, “Happy Easter!! I love y’all,” while Patrick’s brother Jackson chimed in with, “BEST FAM!! Love you all!” The overwhelming love in the comments section reflected the affection fans hold for this wholesome NFL family.Since their high school sweetheart beginnings, Patrick and Brittany’s journey has been closely followed. They tied the knot in March 2022, and since then, their family has grown steadily — first with the birth of Sterling Skye in February 2021, followed by Patrick “Bronze” Lavon in November 2022, and most recently, Golden Raye on January 12, 2025.Though baby Golden was first teased to the world during the couple’s pregnancy announcement — where only her tiny feet were shown — her Easter debut marked the first time she featured in a full family photo. While her face hasn’t been revealed yet, the moment felt monumental for longtime fans who’ve watched the Mahomes family blossom over the years.This Easter celebration wasn’t the only recent family adventure. Earlier, the Kansas City Chiefs star quarterback took his loved ones on a Disney trip to Florida. From Bronze enjoying a front-row seat at Disney on Ice to Sterling’s cheeky side-eye at a Disney princess, the photos were both hilarious and heartwarming. Patrick even posed alongside Mickey Mouse — though Bronze didn’t seem quite as impressed.Brittany also took time to celebrate her best friend’s 30th birthday in a tropical getaway, sporting a stunning “golden hour” dress that subtly paid homage to her newborn daughter. But it was the Easter gathering, the first real family portrait featuring all three children, that truly resonated with fans.While Golden’s full reveal is still under wraps, her Easter cameo brought smiles across social media. As fans eagerly await more glimpses of the littlest Mahomes, one thing’s for sure — this growing family continues to charm the world, one photo at a time.Also Read: Why did Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce really disappear?

NEW DELHI: Saturday's IPL 2025 double-header served up two nail-biters, with Jos Buttler and Avesh Khan playing lead roles in contrasting fashion to guide Gujarat Titans and Lucknow Super Giants to memorable wins over Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals, respectively.In Ahmedabad, Buttler weathered cramps and unleashed a blistering unbeaten 97 off 54 balls to steer Gujarat Titans to a seven-wicket victory over Delhi Capitals.Chasing 204, GT overcame early hiccups with Shubman Gill and B Sai Sudharsan departing early, but Buttler anchored the chase alongside Sherfane Rutherford (43), the pair adding a match-turning 119-run stand for the third wicket.Buttler’s knock was a masterclass in timing and power; he famously took apart Mitchell Starc for five consecutive boundaries in the 15th over, blending classical strokeplay with brute efficiency.Despite missing out on a hundred, Buttler ensured the chase ended with four balls to spare as Rahul Tewatia finished things in style.Earlier, Prasidh Krishna’s 4/41 helped restrict DC to 203/8 despite fighting knocks from Axar Patel (39) and Ashutosh Sharma (37 off 19).In Jaipur, Avesh Khan delivered under extreme pressure, defending nine runs in the final over as Lucknow Super Giants eked out a two-run win against Rajasthan Royals.RR, chasing 181, were coasting at 156/2 in 17 overs with a blazing Yashasvi Jaiswal (74) and 14-year-old debutant Vaibhav Suryavanshi (34) setting the tone.But Avesh’s deadly 18th over, removing Jaiswal and Riyan Parag, turned the game on its head.With nine needed off the final six, Avesh dismissed Shimron Hetmyer and conceded just six runs, finishing with 3/37 and sealing a heist win for LSG.Earlier, Aiden Markram (66) and Ayush Badoni (50) helped LSG post a competitive 180/5, with Abdul Samad’s 10-ball 30 lifting them past 175.The wins saw Gujarat Titans climb to the top of the table, while Lucknow Super Giants revived their campaign with a gritty, last-over triumph that will be talked about for days.","Buttler weathered cramps and unleashed a blistering unbeaten 97 off 54 balls to steer Gujarat Titans to a seven-wicket victory over Delhi Capitals.

Rangers fire Head Coach, but front office missteps fuel deeper crisis



In a move that’s more scapegoat than solution, the New York Rangers fired head coach Peter Laviolette on Saturday and with it, tried to wash their hands of one of the most embarrassing collapses in recent franchise history. After a record-setting 2022-23 season, the Rangers didn’t just miss the playoffs in 2024, they imploded. And rather than admit the problem runs deeper than the bench, GM Chris Drury seems content pinning it all on the coaching staff.Let’s call it what it is: the Rangers' issues didn’t start or end with Peter Laviolette. Yes, the team underperformed. Yes, their power play was abysmal. But to act like the man behind the bench is the root of the problem is a convenient narrative that protects the real culprits, the ones in suits, not skates.Drury’s roster decisions were puzzling all season long. Trading captain Jacob Trouba mid-season raised eyebrows. Shipping off Kaapo Kakko and Filip Chytil while shuffling in new faces like J.T. Miller and Carson Soucy only added to the instability. And let’s not forget the March deadline moves that felt more like desperation than direction. The chemistry never clicked because the pieces kept changing and that’s not on Laviolette.Worse yet, the Rangers are now part of a not-so-proud club, one of only four teams in NHL history to win the Presidents’ Trophy and miss the playoffs the very next season. That’s not just a stumble. That’s a structural failure.Still, Drury insists his job is safe and that “it starts with me.” But if it truly started with him, he wouldn’t be dodging questions about ownership’s confidence. He wouldn’t be pushing the narrative that a new coach, whether it’s a recycled NHL name or an unproven college upstart, is the magic fix.Also Read: Penguins duo Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin set rivalry aside, celebrate Alex Ovechkin’s historic goal record with Rolex gift And where does this leave the locker room?

Until the front office owns up to its missteps, New York is chasing shadows.The Rangers didn’t just fire Laviolette. They lit the fuse on a bigger crisis.","The New York Rangers fired head coach Peter Laviolette on Saturday.

Bombay Sport Exchange Episode 3: Kane Williamson exclusive on NextGen cricketers to watch out for

In any sport, big money doesn’t always guarantee big performance — and the Indian Premier League (IPL) is no exception. Every year, massive auction prices grab headlines and fuel fan expectations, but by mid-season, the numbers often tell a different story.The 2025 edition of the IPL followed last year’s mega auction, where franchises splurged record sums to assemble their squads. The buzz around top buys was sky-high — experts and fans alike closely tracked whether these investments were paying off.Now, at the halfway stage of the league, with all ten teams having played at least seven of their 14 matches, it's time to assess the performances of the tournament’s most expensive stars.Here’s a look at the top five underperformers among the marquee players of IPL 2025 so far:The highest-ever price tag in IPL history brought Rishabh Pant to Lucknow Super Giants, along with immense expectations. The India wicketkeeper-batter had made an inspiring return last season after a near-fatal car accident, and his strong showing with Delhi Capitals made him a hot pick. LSG handed him captaincy duties too, expecting leadership and runs.While the team is faring well — currently fourth on the table with five wins in eight matches — Pant’s personal form has nosedived. He has scored just 106 runs in seven innings at a dismal average of 15.14 and a strike rate below 100. His lone fifty aside, he has struggled to make any significant contribution.M: 8 | I: 7 | R: 106 | HS: 63 | Avg: 15.14 | SR: 98.14 | 50s: 1Kolkata Knight Riders stunned many by shelling out Rs 23.75 crore to re-acquire Venkatesh Iyer, whom they hadn’t retained. But halfway into the season, the gamble appears shaky.KKR have been inconsistent, sitting at sixth on the table with just three wins from seven games. Iyer, too, has been patchy — a couple of good knocks, including a fifty, but not much else. His strike rate of 155.12 is healthy, but with just 121 runs from five innings, he’s yet to make the kind of impact expected of a top buy.M: 7 | I: 5 | R: 121 | HS: 60 | Avg: 24.20 | SR: 155.12 | 50s: 1Renowned as one of the finest T20 bowlers, Rashid Khan has been a consistent match-winner in previous seasons. Retained by Gujarat Titans for Rs 18 crore — more than skipper Shubman Gill — Rashid was expected to be their bowling spearhead.However, the Afghan leg-spinner has had an unusually quiet season so far. He has managed just four wickets in seven games at an average of 63.25 and an economy rate of 9.73. While GT have performed well as a unit and sit atop the points table, Rashid’s lack of penetration remains a concern heading into the business end.M: 7 | W: 4 | BBI: 2/37 | Avg: 63.25 | Econ: 9.73 | SR: 39.00Retained for Rs 18 crore after leading SRH to last season’s final, Pat Cummins has had a tough outing this year. Under his captaincy, SRH have managed only two wins from seven matches, currently sitting ninth in the standings.Cummins has picked up seven wickets, but his economy rate of 10.21 has been alarming. While he impressed with a 3/26 spell against Mumbai Indians, such performances have been rare. With SRH’s playoff hopes dwindling, the onus is on their skipper to inspire a turnaround.M: 7 | W: 7 | BBI: 3/26 | Avg: 36.00 | Econ: 10.21 | SR: 21.14Rohit Sharma’s knock of 76 against Chennai Super Kings showed flashes of his brilliance, but the overall picture remains underwhelming. Excluding that innings, he scored only 82 runs in six outings — not ideal for an opener of his calibre and value.MI have found some rhythm recently, climbing to sixth with four wins from eight matches. But if Rohit is to justify his Rs 16.30 crore retention, more consistent and impactful innings will be needed in the second half of the tournament.M: 7 | R: 158 | HS: 76* | Avg: 26.33 | SR: 154.90 | 50s: 1","Rishabh Pant, Rashid Khan, Rohit Sharma, Pat Cummins and Venkatesh Iyer are the top five underperformers of IPL 2025 so far. Pant has scored just 106 runs in seven innings at a dismal average of 15.14 and a strike rate below 100. Khan has managed just four wickets in seven games at an average of 63.25 and an economy rate of 9.73.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120470658,imgsize-1186551,width-400,resizemode-4/Rishabh-Pant-and-Rohit-Sharma.jpg"

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Krishna's ability to outthink batters and vary his length have been the key, as seen in his recent spell against Lucknow Super Giants when he returned with a four-wicket haul. Left-arm spinner R Sai Kishore has taken 11 wickets and could relish the variable bounce and slow nature of Eden surface.The surface at the Eden Gardens has been questioned by the KKR players. Ahead of their must-win fixtures, two pitches have been prepared for this match. One has an extra layer of grass that has not been trimmed.

Why was Ambati Rayudu banned?

Former India opener Shikhar Dhawan playfully trolled Ambati Rayudu while doing Hindi commentary during the game between Punjab Kings and Royal Challengers Bengaluru.Dhawan and Rayudu had played together since their U-19 days. While reminiscing about those times, Dhawan blamed Rayudu for India's loss against Pakistan in the 2004 U-19 World Cup held in Dhaka, Bangladesh.""Ambati Rayudu was a big name in U-19 cricket. He was our captain in the U-19 World Cup, and he got banned there as well ahead of the semifinal, which cost us the match,"" Dhawan said.In Rayudu's absence, Dinesh Karthik led India in the semifinal, and they lost to Pakistan by five wickets.Batting first, India U-19 posted 169 runs. Robin Uthappa top-scored with 33 runs, while Dhawan only managed eight runs.In reply, Pakistan U-19 chased down the total in 44.5 overs. Pakistan was struggling at 83 for 5 at one stage, but Tariq Mahmood (45 not out) and Fawad Alam (43 not out) put together an unbeaten 88-run partnership for the sixth wicket.Pakistan went on to win the U-19 World Cup, defeating West Indies in the final.Ambati Rayudu, who was the captain of India U-19, missed the semifinal after being banned for one match for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct. Rayudu was reported by umpires Brian Jerling and Billy Doctrove under provision C2 of the ICC Code of Conduct at Level 2 for conduct that brought the game into disrepute.The charge related to excessive time-wasting in the opening overs of the second innings during India's final group match against Sri Lanka on February 26th. India bowled only eight overs in the first 50 minutes of the Sri Lanka innings.","Former India opener Shikhar Dhawan playfully trolled Ambati Rayudu while doing Hindi commentary during the game between Punjab Kings and Royal Challengers Bengaluru.

How has MS Dhoni performed as IPL's oldest uncapped player?

NEW DELHI: As the Indian Premier League 2025 crosses its halfway mark, it's not just the superstars who have made headlines.This season has witnessed an exciting surge of uncapped players stepping into the spotlight, proving their mettle in high-pressure situations.While legends like MS Dhoni, who entered the league as an uncapped player due to a rule change, continue to draw crowds, it's the lesser-known names: Digvesh Rathi, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, and Ashwani Kumar, among others, who’ve turned heads and started carving their own legacy.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Among the uncapped bowlers, Digvesh Rathi of Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) has arguably been the most consistent.In eight matches so far, the leggie has picked up nine wickets at an economy of 7.43, a commendable rate in today’s batting-dominant format.His best of 2/30 might not be headline-grabbing, but Rathi’s control and temperament under pressure, powered by his unorthodox bowling action, have added real depth to LSG’s bowling arsenal.Close on his heels is Kolkata Knight Riders ' Vaibhav Arora, whose eight wickets in just six matches have come at a strike rate of 16.12.QUIZ: Who's that IPL player? While his economy (9.11) suggests a bit of leakage, Arora’s knack for breakthroughs has made him invaluable.Mumbai Indians' Vignesh Puthur has been a revelation in fewer opportunities: six wickets in four matches at a superb average of 15.66.However, it’s Ashwani Kumar who provided one of the most eye-catching performances of the season. He notched a four-wicket haul in his maiden league appearance, becoming the first Indian to take four wickets on IPL debut.If MI use him smartly in the latter half, he could turn into a late-season X-factor.Meanwhile, some uncapped bowlers have struggled to adapt. Simarjeet Singh, Prince Yadav, and Yash Thakur have all gone for 10-plus runs an over, with high bowling averages and minimal impact.While these young guns show promise, the pressure of the IPL spotlight is clearly a tough crucible.Another name making waves is Punjab's Priyansh Arya, who smacked a blistering 103 against Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in his fourth IPL start. Currently, he boasts a mind-boggling strike rate of over 200.With 254 runs, he’s played the aggressor’s role to perfection.Teammates Nehal Wadhera and Prabhsimran Singh have added substance to Punjab’s batting, with both showing improved shot selection and situational awareness.Abishek Porel (DC) and Amanjot Raghuvanshi (KKR) have been steady performers in the middle order, while Aniket Verma (SRH), with a strike rate of 187.05, has delivered explosive cameos that have turned matches.Asutosh Sharma has emerged as Delhi’s clutch finisher, striking at 178.94 with a cool head and a fearless blade in the death overs.However, not all uncapped batters have flourished.Naman Dhir, Ramandeep Singh, and Sameer Rizvi have had underwhelming runs, showing flashes of brilliance but lacking consistency.Even as these youngsters make their mark, MS Dhoni’s presence continues to be magnetic. Albeit, considering the 43-year-old -- who played over 500 matches for India -- qualifies as an uncapped player by a rule change, the comparisons are hardly like-for-like.On the face of it, the numbers paint a rosy picture. Batting precariously down the order, the former Indian skipper has scored 134 runs in 8 matches with a stunning strike rate of 152.27.Again, considering he's no ordinary 'uncapped' player, these are paltry returns for someone of his experience.As some of these names, such as Rathi, bring their names into a conversation for national team selection, if there's one certainty in IPL, it's that heroes can emerge from the unlikeliest corners, and maybe we can find a new one today?",Digvesh Rathi leads the pack of uncapped bowlers in IPL 2025. Ashwani Kumar is the first Indian to take four wickets on IPL debut. Priyansh Arya boasts a mind- boggling strike rate of over 200.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120454763,imgsize-53878,width-400,resizemode-4/MS-Dhoni-and-Digvesh-Rathi-BCCI-Photos.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Just when the critics had begun to question his place in the playing XI, Rohit Sharma roared back in vintage style, smashing an unbeaten 76 off 45 balls, his highest score of IPL 2025 , to guide Mumbai Indians to a dominant nine-wicket win over Chennai Super Kings at Wankhede Stadium on Sunday.After being left out of the starting XI, Rohit came on as an Impact Substitute and made an immediate statement.Walking in to bat during the chase, the veteran opener took full control, timing the ball like the ""Hitman"" of old and tearing through the CSK bowling lineup with elegant brutality.Partnering with Suryakumar Yadav (68 not out off 30), the duo stitched an unbeaten 114-run stand that made light work of CSK’s 177-run target.Their partnership came in just 9 overs, completely silencing critics and delighting a packed Wankhede crowd.Meanwhile, Rohit’s innings featured four fours and six sixes (the joint-most by the 37-year-old in an IPL innings), with his footwork and shot selection reminiscent of his prime years.Earlier, MI opted to bowl first, restricting CSK to 176/5.Shivam Dube (50 off 32) and Ravindra Jadeja (53 not out off 35) were the key contributors for Chennai, after teenage debutant Ayush Mhatre dazzled with a rapid 32 off 15 balls.But MI’s bowlers, led by Jasprit Bumrah (2/25), applied the brakes just in time to prevent a massive total.This win breathes new life into MI’s campaign, lifting them to sixth position with eight points from as many games.For Rohit, it wasn’t just about runs; it was a personal comeback story. After a string of low scores and rising questions about his fitness and future, the 37-year-old let his bat do the talking in the most emphatic way possible.","Mumbai Indians beat Chennai Super Kings by nine wickets at Wankhede.

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma added another feather to his already illustrious cap on Sunday as he etched his name in IPL history, becoming the first Indian cricketer to win 20 Player of the Match awards in the tournament.The milestone came during Mumbai Indians ’ emphatic nine-wicket victory over Chennai Super Kings at Wankhede Stadium.Having struggled for form in this season, Rohit returned to peak mode with a sublime unbeaten 76 off 44 balls.Entering as an impact substitute, the former MI skipper showcased his vintage touch with elegant flicks, effortless pulls, and calculated aggression.His innings not only ended his personal dry spell but also laid the perfect foundation for a clinical chase of CSK's 177-run target.Rohit was well supported by Suryakumar Yadav, who blazed away with 68 not out off just 30 balls.Together, the duo stitched a match-winning 114-run partnership as Mumbai sealed the win with more than four overs to spare.But it was Rohit’s milestone that stole the spotlight.

Poll Do you believe a mentor's role is crucial for a team's success? Not really, players can manage on their own. Yes, absolutely!

In the buildup to the much-anticipated Indian Premier League clash between Gujarat Titans and Delhi Capitals at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Saturday, a light-hearted exchange between KL Rahul and Delhi Capitals mentor Kevin Pietersen stole the spotlight — and the internet’s heart.The Delhi Capitals' social media team posted a seemingly innocent video of GT skipper Shubman Gill greeting Pietersen during practice. The two exchanged pleasantries before Pietersen, with his trademark charm, posed a rhetorical question: “Bro, what’s a mentor? No one knows what a mentor is. Can you tell me what a mentor is?”Just as Gill chuckled, KL Rahul — who was nearby, gearing up for the session — chimed in with a zinger that had everyone in splits.“Mentor is someone who goes to Maldives for two weeks mid-season,” Rahul quipped, sending Pietersen into a smile as others around joined the laughter.The Capitals’ admin didn’t miss the opportunity to ride the wave, captioning the clip: “Thanks, KL, now we know what a mentor does.”After the video went viral, Pietersen replied to Rahul through a social media post explaining the role of a 'mentor' in a funny way.""Mentor - The wise and sagacious guide of a cricket team who, through a mysterious blend of tactical genius and holiday planning, ensures the team is as adept at swinging bats as they are at swinging in hammocks. Known for the rare ability to teach the art of the perfect switch-hit and the secret to finding the best vacation deals during mid-season breaks. Often spotted with a clipboard in one hand and a travel brochure in the other,"" Pietersen wrote.On the field, DC, under the captaincy of Axar Patel , will look to maintain their pole position on the points table, having won five of their six matches. Gujarat Titans, currently third with four wins from six, are hot on their heels and will hope to break DC’s winning momentum in front of a home crowd.","KL Rahul and Kevin Pietersen exchange light-hearted jibes during practice.

NEW DELHI: New Zealand’s batting icon Kane Williamson shared his vision for the next era of cricketing greatness during an exclusive conversation with senior journalist K. Shriniwas Rao on TimesofIndia.com's latest episode of Bombay Sport Exchange When asked to name his “next Fab Four,” Williamson chuckled and replied, ""The five players that come to mind would be Yashasvi Jaiswal (India), Shubman Gill (India), Rachin Ravindra (New Zealand), Harry Brook (England) and Cameron Green from Australia.""Also See: MI vs SRH Coming from a player who is himself part of the modern ""Fab Four"" alongside Virat Kohli Steve Smith , and Joe Root, this endorsement carries tremendous weight.With over 9,276 Test runs at an average of 54.9, including 33 centuries, Williamson’s words reflect not just respect but a keen eye for future legends.The young Indian opener is enjoying a meteoric rise in the longer format, having already scored 1,798 runs in 19 Tests at an average of 52.9, including 4 centuries.His calm temperament and aggressive shot-making have made him a force at the top of the order.He was also part of India’s T20 World Cup-winning team, showing his growing presence in white-ball cricket, although he is yet to make his ODI debut.Gill’s classical style and adaptability have seen him become a regular in all three formats.In Tests, he has scored 1,893 runs in 32 matches with 5 centuries, averaging 35.While he hasn't quite replicated his white-ball dominance in the Test arena, he is widely regarded as the future captain of India's white-ball sides, thanks to his maturity and consistency in ODIs and T20Is.One of the most consistent and dependable new faces in the New Zealand setup, Rachin has been a key figure across all formats.In Tests, he’s scored 1,057 runs in 15 matches, averaging 37.8, with 2 centuries, including a career-best 240.His ability to slot into any role and contribute with both bat and ball makes him an all-format asset for the Kiwis.Harry Brook has been a revelation in red-ball cricket for England.In just 24 Tests, he has amassed 2,281 runs at a stunning average of 58.5, with 8 centuries and a high score of 317.His explosive style and aggression align perfectly with England’s ""Bazball"" strategy.Recognizing his potential as a leader and limited-overs performer, Brook has now been appointed England’s white-ball captain, marking a new chapter in his career.Despite battling recent injuries, Cameron Green remains a crucial all-rounder for Australia, offering balance with both bat and ball.In Tests, he’s scored 1,377 runs in 28 matches at an average of 36.2, with 2 centuries and a top score of 174*.His 13 sixes and 152 fours reflect his ability to shift gears, and when fully fit, Green is a game-changer in all three formats.Williamson’s nod to these five reflects both current performance and future potential.As the ""Fab Four"" era edges toward its twilight, this ""Fab Five"" could well be the torchbearers of the next golden generation of Test cricket.","Kane Williamson names five players to watch out for in next generation of cricketers.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals (DC) take on Shubman Gill’s Gujarat Titans (GT) in Match No. 35 of the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Saturday. The Capitals currently sit atop the points table with 10 points from six games, while Gujarat trail just behind with eight points from eight outings.DC will walk in high on confidence after their edge-of-the-seat Super Over victory against Rajasthan Royals -- a game where Mitchell Starc turned the tide with his ice-cold death-over brilliance. The Aussie speedster, known for his pinpoint yorkers and late swing, was the architect of that heist and continues to lead the pace attack with authority.But Starc and co. will be up against a GT top order that’s looked ominous. Shubman Gill’s fluent strokeplay, Sai Sudharsan’s consistency, and Jos Buttler’s explosiveness have powered Gujarat’s batting thus far. Between them, they’ve notched up at least one fifty in every match — and DC will know that cracking that code early could unravel the Titans.On the flip side, all eyes will be on Mohammed Siraj, who’s found his groove after a testing season of international cricket. Siraj, fresh and firing, has bagged 10 wickets with a miserly economy of 8.50 — especially potent in the Powerplay. His matchup against Delhi’s young openers Jake Fraser-McGurk and Abishek Porel will be one to watch. The duo has shown flashes of potential but faces a stern examination under the Ahmedabad sun.And should early wickets fall, the Capitals will lean on veterans KL Rahul and Karun Nair to anchor the innings. Local lad Axar Patel, who plies his domestic trade for Gujarat, will be keen to shine at his home ground — especially now that he’s back in form with both bat and ball.Spin could prove decisive on a dry Ahmedabad deck. GT will back their seasoned duo of Rashid Khan and R Sai Kishore to keep things tight in the middle overs, while DC’s Kuldeep Yadav — if fit — will be their X-factor. His wrist spin has been Delhi’s trump card, ably complemented by the promising Vipraj Nigam. But Kuldeep’s availability remains in question after a shoulder niggle saw him leave the field in their last outing.Traditionally a true surface with pace and bounce, the Ahmedabad pitch this season has played slower than expected in afternoon games. Batters who apply themselves early can reap rewards later, but spinners and cutters into the surface have found assistance. With the match scheduled for 3:30 PM, dew won't be a factor, but dryness might.Jake Fraser-McGurk, Abishek Porel, KL Rahul, Karun Nair, Axar Patel (c), Tristan Stubbs, Mitchell Starc, Mukesh Kumar, Mohit Sharma, Dushmantha Chameera, Kuldeep Yadav (if fit) / Vipraj NigamAshutosh SharmaShubman Gill (c), B Sai Sudharsan, Jos Buttler (wk), Shahrukh Khan, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, R Sai Kishore, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Kagiso Rabada, Washington SundarKarim JanatA dry and hot afternoon is expected in Ahmedabad, with temperatures hovering between 33°C and 41°C.

Jaipur: Sometimes a small contribution can make a big impact. Rajasthan Royals realised it the hard way against Lucknow Super Giants here on Saturday. Avesh Khan has been hogging the limelight with his last-over heroics for Lucknow, but many experts believe it was Abdul Samad ’s little cameo for them which made the pivotal difference.Opting to bat, LSG found themselves struggling at 153/5 with two overs to go. That’s when Samad stepped in and smacked four sixes in the last over to finish their innings on a high. An explosive 30 runs off just 10 balls swelled their total to 180 for 5.The flamboyant 23-year-old Jammu batter made the perfect use of Sandeep Sharma’s military pace to hammer him over the long-on and mid-wicket region to notch up 27 runs from the 20th over. Flaunting his power-hitting muscle and dispatching the ball into the SMS Stadium stands with clean strikes, his unbeaten 30 changed RR’s fortunes.As his onslaught unfolded, few would know that Samad had arrived in Jaipur only hours before the game as his mother was admitted to a New Delhi hospital because of back issues. Samad ’s father Mohammed Farooq praised his son for showing mental toughness in the hour of crisis. “I am really proud about my son’s performance.Hitting four sixes against an experienced bowler like Sandeep Sharma is not an easy thing. As my wife was not well, Samad was with her for a couple of days after getting permission from the team management. He flew to Jaipur just before the match. I hope Samad continues to play such knocks in the remaining matches,” Farooq, himself a national-level cricketer in his college days, said.Samad’s mate, Avesh also acknowledged the impact of those last over sixes, pointing out that had Samad hit only two, the score would have been much lower, making the target more achievable. “The last overs are crucial. The momentum shifts. With his four sixes, the momentum shifted to our side.If he had hit two sixes, we would have got 165-170. It was only a difference of 10 runs. In the last over, when a bowler (Sharma) gets hit for 20-25 runs, he hands momentum to the other team. Samad provided us with a cushion in the last over,” said Avesh.After playing for Sunrisers Hyderabad for three years, Samad arrived at LSG for Rs 4.2 crore this season, largely thanks to his awesome strike rate of more than 150. Samad’s close friend Prince Utkarsh admired the way he left behind the personal troubles. “He was worried about Aunty’s health as she was bed-ridden. But knowing the importance of the match, he came here as a thorough professional cricketer,” said Utkarsh.",Abdul Samad smacked four sixes in the last over to finish their innings on a high.

Kolkata: Is the chink in Kolkata Knight Riders ’ armour becoming visible? The way they lost two of their last three games, it seems the purple brigade is missing out on a finisher. At the halfway stage of the tournament, KKR head coach Chandrakant Pandit would be a worried man as they gear up to play Gujarat Titans at the Eden Gardens here on Monday.Against Lucknow Super Giants and Punjab Kings, the defending champions were cruising smoothly before they crumbled. In a high-scoring match against LSG at the Eden, chasing 239 for victory, KKR smashed 90 in the Powerplay. Even in the middle overs, they stayed on course but lost the plot at the death, losing five wickets for 23 runs in the space of 20 balls to fall short by four runs.Against PBKS, very few expected KKR to come second while chasing a target as low as 112. At 62 for two in the eighth over, victory seemed to be a foregone conclusion before they endured a sensational collapse losing their last eight wickets for just 33 runs to lose by 16 runs.KKR’s success last season came much due to the flowing starts that they got upfront. But this time, their openers Sunil Narine and Quinton de Kock have failed to provide such blistering starts putting the onus on the middle order. Despite batting deep with Ramandeep Singh coming in at No. 8, KKR have managed to put up 200-run totals only twice so far.There’s no doubt that KKR have banked heavily on their ‘RRR’ by retaining Rinku Singh Andre Russell and Ramandeep before the last mega auction. But halfway through the season, the trio has failed to live up to expectations. Things will not get any easier against GT who perhaps have the most disciplined bowling attack in this IPL.Mohammad Siraj and Prasidh Krishna have combined so well that the side is not feeling the absence of Kagiso Rabada. At the same time spinner Sai Kishore has also stood up to fill in for a below-par Rashid Khan.Probable XIIs: Kolkata Knight Riders: Ajinkya Rahane (c), Sunil Narine, Quinton de Kock (wk), Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Ramandeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Varun Chakravarthy, Vaibhav Arora, Moeen Ali.Gujarat Titans: Shubman Gill (capt), B Sai Sudharsan, Jos Buttler (wk), Sherfane Rutherford, Shahrukh Khan, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Arshad Khan, R Sai Kishore, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Washington Sundar/Ishant Sharma.",Defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders have lost two of their last three games.

Jaipur: Executing yorkers with flair and precision is Avesh Khan ’s forte. The Lucknow Super Giants speedster displayed this rare skill in abundance to bowl his side to a thrilling two-run victory against Rajasthan Royals on Saturday.Thousands of RR faitfhful at the packed Sawai Mansingh Stadium could only watch helplessly as Avesh gave away just six runs in the final over when the home team needed nine for a win and halt their losing sequence. “I just focus on the execution,” said Avesh later, “I always back 100% whatever ball I have decided to bowl.“Mostly it is the yorker,” he revealed, “even if the situation is 15 required or 20 required, I back myself on the yorker, and that is very important in the IPL . When you focus completely on the match, you focus only where you want to bowl.”The 28-year-old pacer from Madhya Pradesh believed getting rid of Yashasvi Jaiswal was the turning point of the match. The RR opener was batting fluently on 74 when a rush of blood halted his advance. “It was like ‘you miss, I hit,’” said Avesh, “Yashasvi was batting quite well and has almost put his team on the verge of victory.I decided to bowl straight and, in the block-hole.. He tried to force me out in the covers region but misjudged the line of the ball and was castled. It was certainly the turning point of the match.” Avesh said he did not feel any pressure while bowling in the death overs.“I know I am good in the death overs. I only focus on the execution at the time. When we watch from the outside, even us, we feel the tension; but when I am playing, I never feel that tension that I will go for a six or a four,” he said, underlining the process behind the return of 3 for 37 from his 4-over spell to restrict RR to 178/5 while chasing 181.Although he bowled a match-winning spell, he admitted luck favoured him in the last over. Shardul Thakur, who was fielding at the short fineleg took a blinder to send Hetmyer back to the pavilion. Even Shubham Dubey’s powerful shot hit his body and deflected to cover for a solitary run with four runs needed on the last ball.“Not that you want to get the wicket this ball or you want to make the batter defend or you want to bowl a dot ball. The moment I saw him (Hetmyer) shuffle to off, I bowled the stump line, and luckily it went to hand because he was the only fielder there.If Shubham’s shot did not hit me on my hands, it could have resulted in 2-3 runs,” said Avesh, who could not celebrate the win because of the impact of the ball",Lucknow Super Giants bowled Rajasthan Royals to a thrilling two-run victory. Avesh Khan took 3 for 37 from his 4-over spell to restrict RR to 178/5 while chasing 181.

IPL Points Table

Mumbai: This wasn’t a chase; it was a massacre. Wielding his willow like a murderous axe, Suryakumar Yadav (68* off 30 balls, 6x4, 5x6) clobbered Matheesha Pathirana for two consecutive sixes over extra cover and long-off in the 16th over to make a powerful statement for the Mumbai Indians , who notched up their third straight win.Message delivered: Never underestimate the five-time IPL champions. Powered by scintillating half-centuries from India’s Test and ODI captain Rohit Sharma (76* off 45 balls, 4x4, 5x6) and India’s T20 skipper Surya, and their blazing 114-run partnership off just 54 balls for the second wicket, Mumbai Indians continued their resurgence in IPL 2025 , trouncing the beleaguered Chennai Super Kings by nine wickets with 26 balls to spare at a packed Wankhede. MI have now moved up to sixth on the points table, while CSK laguish at 10th.Chasing 177, MI were off to an electrifying start with a 63-run opening stand in 40 balls between Rohit and South African ’keeper-batter Ryan Rickelton (24 off 19 balls, 3x4, 1x6), before Rohit and Surya went berserk against a clueless CSK attack, making a mockery of the target.Rohit, turning back the clock, shrugged off his average form to bring up his maiden fifty of the season, treating the Wankhede faithful to vintage pull shots and elegant pick-ups. Surya, meanwhile, was in full flow, dismantling Noor Ahmad with savage sweeps to raise his half-century in just 26 balls.Earlier, 17-year-old Ayush Mhatre , making his T20 and IPL debut at his home ground, became the latest Indian youngster to make a mark in IPL 2025. The Mumbai boy smashed a strokefilled 32 off just 15 balls, including four fours and two sixes, before fifties from Ravindra Jadeja (53* off 35 balls, 4x4, 2x6) and Shivam Dube (50 off 32 balls, 2x4, 4x6) powered CSK to 176 for five after being asked to bat first.Walking in during the fourth over after Rachin Ravindra (5) was caught behind off Ashwani Kumar, Mhatre, the youngest-ever to debut for CSK at 17 years and 278 days, lit up Wankhede with three brutal hits in four balls — a sumptuous off-drive, a towering six over long-on, and a ferocious pull off the Punjab left-arm pacer.He dominated a 41-run stand off 22 balls with Shaik Rashid (19 off 20 balls), before he was out to Deepak Chahar. The youngster, who like Prithvi Shaw hails from Virar, has long travelled by early morning trains to train in the maidans of South Mumbai — a journey that paid off with a pat from Surya himself as he walked back.After Mhatre’s departure, CSK stuttered to 73 for three in 11 overs, with 26 dot balls in that stretch, before Dube and Jadeja powered a 79-run fourth-wicket stand in 50 balls, plundering 103 runs in the last nine overs. Jasprit Bumrah (2-25) was again the pick of the MI bowlers, including the wickets of Dube and MS Dhoni","Suryakumar Yadav (68* off 30 balls, 6x4, 5x6) clobbered Matheesha Pathirana for two consecutive sixes over extra cover and long-off in the 16th over to make a powerful statement.
