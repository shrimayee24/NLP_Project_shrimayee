The rivalry between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal is one of the most celebrated in tennis history, blending fierce competition with mutual admiration.Spanning over 40 matches, including epic Grand Slam finals, their contrasting styles captivated fans worldwide — Federer's effortless grace against Nadal's relentless intensity.Beyond the court, their camaraderie has been equally inspiring. Despite battling for supremacy, they’ve shared a deep respect, often praising each other's achievements and work ethic.Their iconic rivalry transcended sport, showcasing how competition can coexist with friendship. Federer and Nadal remain symbols of sportsmanship , leaving an enduring legacy of rivalry and bonhomie in tennis lore.As Nadal prepares to join Federer into retirement, with the upcoming Davis Cup Finals in Malaga to be his last, the Swiss penned an emotional note for the Spaniard.""Vamos, @RafaelNadal!As you get ready to graduate from tennis, I’ve got a few things to share before I maybe get emotional.Let’s start with the obvious: you beat me—a lot. More than I managed to beat you. You challenged me in ways no one else could. On clay, it felt like I was stepping into your backyard, and you made me work harder than I ever thought I could just to hold my ground. You made me reimagine my game—even going so far as to change the size of my racquet head, hoping for any edge.I’m not a very superstitious person, but you took it to the next level. Your whole process. All those rituals. Assembling your water bottles like toy soldiers in formation, fixing your hair, adjusting your underwear... All of it with the highest intensity. Secretly, I kind of loved the whole thing. Because it was so unique—it was so you.And you know what, Rafa, you made me enjoy the game even more.OK, maybe not at first. After the 2004 Australian Open, I achieved the #1 ranking for the first time. I thought I was on top of the world. And I was—until two months later, when you walked on the court in Miami in your red sleeveless shirt, showing off those biceps, and you beat me convincingly. All that buzz I’d been hearing about you—about this amazing young player from Mallorca, a generational talent, probably going to win a major someday—it wasn’t just hype.We were both at the start of our journey and it’s one we ended up taking together. Twenty years later, Rafa, I have to say: What an incredible run you’ve had. Including 14 French Opens—historic! You made Spain proud... you made the whole tennis world proud.I keep thinking about the memories we’ve shared. Promoting the sport together. Playing that match on half-grass, half-clay. Breaking the all-time attendance record by playing in front of more than 50,000 fans in Cape Town, South Africa. Always cracking each other up. Wearing each other out on the court and then, sometimes, almost literally having to hold each other up during trophy ceremonies.I’m still grateful you invited me to Mallorca to help launch the Rafa Nadal Academy in 2016. Actually, I kind of invited myself. I knew you were too polite to insist on me being there, but I didn’t want to miss it. You have always been a role model for kids around the world, and Mirka and I are so glad that our children have all trained at your academies. They had a blast and learned so much—like thousands of other young players. Although I always worried my kids would come home playing tennis as lefties.And then there was London—the Laver Cup in 2022. My final match. It meant everything to me that you were there by my side—not as my rival but as my doubles partner. Sharing the court with you that night, and sharing those tears, will forever be one of the most special moments of my career.Rafa, I know you’re focused on the last stretch of your epic career. We will talk when it’s done. For now, I just want to congratulate your family and team, who all played a massive role in your success. And I want you to know that your old friend is always cheering for you, and will be cheering just as loud for everything you do next.Rafa that!Best always, your fan,Roger""","Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer's rivalry is one of the most celebrated in tennis history.

Deion Sanders: The Rising Star



Bill Belichick: The Legendary Coach in Search of a Challenge

Cowboys Future: A Pivotal Coaching Call

Who Will Lead the Cowboys in 2025?

The Dallas Cowboys might be entering into a massive change in coaching by 2025. Mike McCarthy signed a five-year deal and, as another season in 2024 might turn out to be disappointing, Jerry Jones could get himself a new head coach. Five consecutive seasons of great regular-season performance and several playoff appearances later, the team still hasn't found a trip to the Super Bowl under his captaincy. If the Cowboys are not making a deep postseason run with championship aspirations high, it may be time for Jones to make a change.Mike McCarthy arrived in Dallas in 2020 with all the talent and endless hype one could want. Since McCarthy's steady regular-season records, his Cowboys have consistently failed in the postseason. Never in his tenure has McCarthy's team escaped the divisional round. It is simply that McCarthy hasn't been able to get them to play their best when it counts. Most likely, if 2024 ends with another early-playoff exit, Jones would be looking elsewhere.His name has quickly emerged as one of the top candidates to take the reins of the Cowboys in the future. His aptitude to draw in the best tier of talent, along with his fiery leadership, have portrayed him as the bright shining star in the coaching world. With a career as a Hall of Fame player and then with growing success as a coach, Sanders could be the jolt the Cowboys need to recapture competitiveness again.Another name that always brings up debate is Bill Belichick. Although the New England Patriots have struggled lately, there's no disputing that Belichick is the greatest coach to ever coach in the NFL-from six Super Bowls to untold division crowns.They have the parts to contend seriously for a Super Bowl; now they just need the right leadership to push them over the top. It doesn't matter whether it's the youthful energy of Deion Sanders or whether it's experience with Bill Belichick-the Cowboys need a coach who can take it all home and finally bring an end to the team's Super Bowl drought.Also Read - Sauce Gardner’s Social Media Slip-Up: A Leaked DM and a Public Apology Deion Sanders and Bill Belichick are some of the earliest favorites in the running, but the coaching search may get too fluid and depend on how the 2024 season plays out.

This decision may ensure the future of the franchise for years to come.","Mike McCarthy signed a five-year deal with the Dallas Cowboys in 2020.

A retiring Rafael Nadal lost 4-6, 4-6 to Netherlands' Botic van de Zandschulp in a Davis Cup Finals quarter-final singles rubber on Tuesday as the Dutch took a 1-0 lead against Spain.Nadal, who holds 22 Grand Slam titles, has announced his intention to retire from professional tennis after the Davis Cup tournament in Malaga. This decision follows a period marked by injuries.There was uncertainty regarding Nadal's participation until David Ferrer, the team captain, confirmed Nadal's presence in the first singles match of the finals.The Spanish national anthem played as a visibly moved Nadal stood before the cheering crowd , who chanted his name enthusiastically.“Rafa! Rafa!”Nadal had an impressive record in the Davis Cup, with 29 victories in his last 30 singles matches. His two previous matches against Van de Zandschulp had also resulted in wins.The veteran player's initial nervousness seemed to dissipate after he recovered from a 15-30 deficit to secure the first game.Van de Zandschulp, ranked 80th in the world, faced a setback when he served three consecutive double faults. However, he regained his composure to hold serve.Nadal, currently ranked 154th, aimed for shorter points, employing powerful serves and showcasing his renowned forehand. His signature fist pump and roar followed.Van de Zandschulp targeted Nadal's backhand, a strategy that proved challenging for the Spaniard to counter, particularly on the indoor hard court, a surface far from Nadal's favoured clay.At 4-4, the Dutchman earned two break points and capitalised on the second with a well-placed cross-court winner, giving him a significant lead. He then converted his second set point.Nadal mounted a comeback in the second set, recovering from 0-30 down, but he couldn't convert it into a hold. Van de Zandschulp capitalised on the Spaniard's extended play, securing the first break and increasing the pressure.Trailing a set and a break, Nadal fought relentlessly to gain a foothold. He persevered through intense pressure on his serve in the third game, ultimately holding and eliciting the most fervent applause of the evening.Van de Zandschulp maintained his momentum, holding his serve and then breaking Nadal's serve once more to take a 4-1 lead. Another cross-court winner after a demanding rally sealed the break.Despite the challenging situation, Nadal showcased his unwavering determination, breaking back in the sixth game by converting his third break point. This glimmer of hope grew stronger as he held his serve, reducing the deficit to 4-3.The Spaniard, giving his all in what could be his final match, saved a break point and won two consecutive games for the first time in the match.Van de Zandschulp, displaying his own resilience, held serve in the eighth game with two powerful aces. Nadal followed suit, leaving Van de Zandschulp serving for the match.Nadal's final game saw him hitting a shot long to concede match point and then hitting the net, sealing the victory for his Dutch opponent.Spain's hopes of advancing in the Davis Cup now rest on World No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz . He faces Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands in the second rubber.The winner of this match will advance to the semi-finals, where they will face either Germany or Canada.","Rafael Nadal has announced his intention to retire from professional tennis after the Davis Cup tournament in Malaga.

Grizzlies vs Nuggets injury report for tonight's game

The injury bug seems to have been biting at various teams already, as evident in Sunday's Grizzlies vs Nuggets match. Both teams were deprived of their biggest stars, Ja Morant and Nikola Jokic, respectively, thus the win for the Grizzlies. With both teams clashing once again, these injuries cast a looming shadow over them.Denver coach Mike Malone knows what to expect when the Nuggets play the Memphis Grizzlies. Malone will get another opportunity to impart that wisdom Tuesday when the visiting Nuggets play the Grizzlies for the second time in three days, this time in an NBA Cup game. Host Memphis beat Denver 105-90 on Sunday.The Denver Nuggets (7-5) will be keeping an eye on three players on the injury report, including Nikola Jokic, as they prepare for a Tuesday, November 19 game against the Memphis Grizzlies (8-6) at FedExForum. Five injured players have been listed by the Grizzlies. The game begins at 8:00 PM ET.Ja Morant is currently sidelined due to a hip injury sustained during the Lakers game on November 6, and his return is uncertain. However, he hinted at a possible return in a recent tweet. “Sooner than you think. Source: me,” he tweeted. The Grizzlies are awaiting Morant's return after Zach Edey injured his left ankle, leaving mid-game. Marcus Smart may miss his second consecutive game due to illness, while GG Jackson II and Cam Spencer remain out with injuries. The team is hoping for Morant's quick return.The Joker, a three-time MVP, is questionable after missing two games due to personal reasons, raising concerns among fans. Nuggets reporter Katy Winge recently assured, “I can confirm that he and his family are fine and there is nothing to be alarmed about!” Jokic's absence has left a significant void, as he has been averaging a 29.7-point triple-double.Aaron Gordon is out for multiple weeks due to a left calf strain he suffered during a Raptors game. He was averaging 15.4 points and nearly seven rebounds before the injury. Rookie DaRon Holmes II is also out with a torn right Achilles.

Coach's resolve put to the test

IND vs AUS 1st Test: Visitors rocked by Rohit unavailability, Gill injury; batting a serious concern

The honeymoon period for the Indian cricket team 's head coach Gautam Gambhir has ended abruptly. After enduring a humiliating 3-0 whitewash in the Test series against New Zealand on home soil, the former opener finds himself under immense pressure as India gears up for a challenging five-Test series against Australia.Gambhir was brought on board to sustain India's dominance across all three formats. However, India lost a white-ball series in Sri Lanka for the first time in 27 years.Then, to add bruises to the blushes, they were trumped by a modest New Zealand side. It was the worst defeat at home in 91 years and set alarm bells ringing at BCCI headquarters.These drastic losses have fuelled debate about the direction Indian cricket is heading towards under Gambhir. It needs to be asked — how did a formidable Indian side crumble so dramatically? Did the new head coach inherit a team on the decline?They say good teams evolve while empires fall apart. India probably missed the trick heading into the new season by not blooding youngsters soon enough. Rohit Sharma , Virat Kohli, R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, the men who took Indian cricket to new heights season after season, are on the wane.Indian cricket stands at a crossroads, and Gambhir has a monumental task ahead of him. The 43-year-old has defended his aging core, stating, ""Transition or no transition, if that has to happen, it will happen. But I see some incredibly tough characters in that dressing room who are hungry to do well."" Beyond these words, Gambhir's mind is likely focused on identifying players who can shape the future of Indian cricket. He began this process by promoting Washington Sundar during the New Zealand series, a move that paid off as the allrounder performed well. Gambhir is now betting on young talents like Andhra allrounder Nitish Reddy and Delhi pacer Harshit Rana.Brave that he is, it'll not be surprising to see him toss the duo into the choppy waters of international cricket over the next few weeks.India's tactical frailties were exposed in both Sri Lanka and at home against New Zealand.After losing 27 wickets to spin in Sri Lanka, the curators were ordered to dish out turners in Pune and Mumbai. With five regular Test stars — Shubman Gill, Rohit, Kohli, Rishabh Pant and Axar Patel — failing on spin friendly Lankan surfaces, it was wishful thinking that the rest would do well in similar conditions at home.Gambhir, himself a master at taming the wiles of Muttiah Muralitharan, Rangana Herath, and Saeed Ajmal, couldn't help but control the damage against lesser skilled bowlers. With Nathan Lyon looming in Australian conditions, India's struggles against spin could persist.The Tests against New Zealand also saw experts pointing out the flaws as India repeatedly stuttered on the field. Rohit Sharma did say that he was subpar while captaining the side, but whether he was nudged in his vulnerable moments by the coach or other members of the coaching staff remains unclear.Gambhir's playing career was characterised by grit and determination, with two standout examples being the 2009 Napier Test and the 2011 Cape Town Test. Against New Zealand in Napier, he batted for nearly two days to secure a hard-fought draw. However, his knocks of 93 and 64 at Newlands in Cape Town were even braver, given the challenging conditions, the match-series situation, and the quality of the bowling attack.At Newlands, Gambhir batted for over five hours with a swollen left elbow to rescue India against the fiery pace duo of Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel. Across the series, the left-hander notched up three scores of fifty-plus in four innings, playing a pivotal role in helping India draw the series for the first time on South African soil.As a coach, he must instill that same resolve in his players against Australia even though he reckons it was much easier doing it as a player.""You realise when you are playing, it's a completely different thing to when you are coaching. You can only control certain things. You can't just walk into the middle,"" Gambhir had said recently.His mettle as coach will face its sternest test yet Down Under. While the recent setbacks have cast a shadow of doubt, they also present an opportunity for redemption. The challenge for Gambhir now is to channel his renowned fighting spirit into his coaching and inspire his players to bounce back.Australia will not only test the technical and tactical preparedness of this Indian side but also its resilience. The series could well define Gambhir's tenure as head coach and mark a turning point in India's journey. For now, Gambhir's focus must be on restoring confidence, refining strategies, and fostering unity within the squad.It's believed that redemption often lies just beyond the horizon of despair. Gambhir and his team must believe that their best days are ahead of them. If they do overcome this tough phase, it will serve as a blueprint for how champions rise from the ashes of defeat.",Gautam Gambhir has a monumental task ahead of him.

The uncertainty surrounding the host venue for the 2025 Champions Trophy continues to dominate discussions in world cricket.The controversy began when the BCCI informed the International Cricket Council (ICC) that the Indian cricket team would not travel to Pakistan, the designated host for the tournament.In response, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) took a firm stance, rejecting the idea of a hybrid model.Now, former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has weighed in on the issue, sharing his perspective in a recent interview.""It's really up to the governments. It's nothing to do with the BCCI. It is up to the BJP government . They will decide,"" Shoaib Akhtar said.""There will be back channel talks. Even in days of war, there are back channel talks. We should not lose hope. We have to look forward to a solution. We know a fact that 95-98 per cent of sponsorship for ICC comes from India.""If Pakistan fails to convince India to come to Pakistan, then two things will happen: Pakistan will lose about 100 million dollars of the sponsorship that will go to ICC and the host country will earn. Second, it would be better if India comes and plays in Pakistan. But it's really, really up to the government. It has nothing to do with BCCI. Virat Kohli is trying to play in Pakistan for the first time. Entire Pakistan wants to see Virat play in Pakistan. Imagine him scoring a century in Pakistan. It will be good; he doesn't score a century here and gets out early. It will be a full circle for him.""Pakistan has got a tag that it cannot host big tournaments like the World Cup or Champions Trophy. If this (Champions Trophy) happens, it will be a stepping stone for bigger events. I don't think this will happen. Keeping the fingers crossed. Wait till the last moment. I think currently, as of now, India is coming to Pakistan,"" Akhtar said.","Former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has weighed in on the Champions Trophy controversy.

Chess men or destiny's children? How quirk of fate played a role in setting up Ding vs Gukesh world chess battle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/chess-men-or-destinys-children-how-quirk-of-fate-played-a-role-in-setting-up-ding-vs-gukesh-world-chess-battle/articleshow/115469928.cms,"File Pic: Ding Liren and D Gukesh (X Photo)

'It's not just luck but what you make out of luck that matters more,' goes the famous adage. While that holds true for both the finalists of the World Chess Championship Match — champion Ding Liren and challenger D Gukesh — the Indian's story is even more fascinating.It is well documented that Ding came into the World Championship picture only because China organised some games for him and met FIDE 's minimum-games-played criteria. Then, despite not winning the 2022 Candidates, he still got a shot at the title because Magnus Carlsen withdrew before the 2023 Match.Gukesh remains the deserving challenger for the solidity and competitive nous that he has showcased. His 18/21 score on the top board in two Olympiads is legendary. But things came together, somewhat accidentally, for him too.When Russian premier Vladimir Putin attacked Ukraine in Feb 2022, the war killed Russia's chance of hosting the Olympiad. That brought Gukesh on the top board as replacement hosts India were allowed to field a second team. Any other spot — either on the reserve board of the first team or on the second board of the second team — won't have given Gukesh the big platform.By scoring 8/8 on the top board, Gukesh announced himself on the world stage. But things started to go awry at the end of 2023 when he dropped 30 Elo points in three months preceding the 2024 Candidates cutoff. However, the Chennai GM tournament came to his rescue despite the floods in the city testing the organisers. The venue of the tournament could be finalised only a fortnight before. Gukesh won that event to seal the Candidates spot.In the Candidates in Toronto earlier this year, Vidit Gujrathi defeated Gukesh's closest rival Hikaru Nakamura twice and favourite Fabiano Caruana failed to beat Nepo in winning position in the last round. Maybe it was destiny's way to balance things out as it had pitted Gukesh against Carlsen in the quarterfinals of the knockout World Cup last year (another qualifying event for the Candidates), an event where Pragg and Vidit were given relatively easy pairings.Vishy Anand 's semi-retirement phase, his astute mentorship, including sharing his trainer Grzegoz Gajewski with Gukesh, was also timed to perfection.China's Ding, son of a nurse, too has shown his gutsy side. In the last year's Championship match, Ian Nepomniachtchi led thrice and Ding was not in the best condition. But he still scored three series levelling wins and then went on to win the title via rapid tiebreaks.The first of 14 games of the World Chess Championship in Singapore begins at 2.30pm IST on Nov 25.",Gukesh remains the deserving challenger for the solidity and competitive nous that he has showcased.

Jake Paul wants to be Logan Paul’s Paul Heyman

After defeating Mike Tyson despite astonishing criticism, Jake Paul has recently revealed that he is eying on to join WWE for the aid of his brother but the YouTuber-turned-boxer shared that he will stay out of in-ring competitions preferably taking a managerial role like WWE Hall of Famer Paul Heyman . It appears that Jake Paul has not much interest in stepping into the locker room or the ring for a fight.Paul Heyman’s legendary status seemingly impressed Jake Paul as he is looking for a similar position at WWE managing his brother and former United States champion Logan Paul. Appearing in Logan’s Impulsive podcast, Jake shared that he is willing to join WWE but as his manager.“I would want to be your like Paul Heyman. I wouldn't want to like wrestle as much like I could do some shit, but I would want to be like your sidekick business man,” Jake told Logan during a recent episode of his podcast.The Paul brothers are two of the most prominent internet sensations, the YouTuber-turned-stars in the boxing and wrestling worlds have already made their names heard. Still, they are far from a slew of controversies. Recently, Jake defeated legendary boxer Mike Tyson in a fight that was aired on Netflix with reportedly 108 million viewers worldwide. The fight, however, invited a series of controversies as Tyson, despite his glorious boxing career is 58 while Jake is just 27.Also, leading up to the fight, Tyson faced numerous medical challenges. It has raised speculation that the event was more about securing a payday than delivering a fierce contest. When asked if he eased up during the match, Paul admitted, ""Yeah, definitely,"" adding that he ""wanted to give the fans a show.""Also Read: Jake Paul Wants to Fight Connor McGregor As Mike Tyson Throws Down the Gauntlet for Logan Paul “Yeah, a little bit.

Texans-Cowboys matchup thrills 17 million fans



Houston Texans vs. Dallas Cowboys Game Highlights | NFL 2024 Season Week 11

The Monday night clash between the Texans and Cowboys delivered a one-sided outcome on the field, but it struck gold in television ratings. Despite the Texans dominating the Cowboys with a decisive 34-10 victory, the game garnered an impressive average viewership of 17 million across ABC, ESPN , and ESPN2, according to data released by ESPN.This surge in viewership says about the strategic advantage of airing games on ABC. However, the high audience turnout is noteworthy given the lackluster performances leading into the game. The Texans had failed to impress in previous prime-time matchups, while the Cowboys endured a disappointing season, particularly in home games. The numbers reveal that even in games lacking high stakes or competitive excitement, the NFL's drawing power remains immense.Interestingly, ESPN has remained tight-lipped about the specific viewership figures for the ""ManningCast,"" the alternate broadcast hosted by Peyton and Eli Manning. A pattern has emerged where viewership stats for the ManningCast are revealed only when the numbers are deemed strong. Otherwise, as seen in this instance, the figures are withheld, leaving fans and analysts guessing about its performance.Looking ahead, expectations for next Monday night's game are significantly higher. The Chargers and Ravens will face off in what promises to be a thrilling encounter, marking the first Harbaugh brothers' showdown since their memorable Super Bowl clash. Scheduled for the Monday before Thanksgiving, this game is poised to draw a larger audience, fueled by the anticipation of a high-stakes matchup and the Harbaugh brothers' rivalry narrative.Also Read: Jets part ways with Joe Douglas as team struggles to a 3-8 Start in yet another disappointing season This week’s ratings reinforce the NFL’s unmatched ability to capture audiences, even in games that lack traditional allure.

#LIVE: India bowling combination for 1st Test Border-Gavaskar Trophy vs Australia in Perth

IND vs AUS 1st Test: Visitors rocked by Rohit unavailability, Gill injury; batting a serious concern

NEW DELHI: While all eyes are trained on how the Indian team will fare in the five Tests in Australia from Friday, coach Gautam Gambhir and chief selector Ajit Agarkar will also be working on a roadmap for the future of the white-ball teams, apart from the Test squad.TOI understands that Agarkar has been asked to stay in Australia for the entire length of the tour to work closely with Gambhir and get an understanding of how each player is placed in his career. Following the 0-3 debacle at home against New Zealand, talk of transition has gathered steam.According to BCCI sources, the idea is to ensure that both Agarkar and Gambhir are on the same page on the matter. There has been speculation that there is a lack of synchronization over some of the recent strategies and selections.""Both Agarkar and Gambhir know that such poor performance in India will trigger widespread criticism, which is justified. Since it's a long tour, both can sit together and discuss how things can be taken forward after the tour,"" a BCCI source said. ""Both will need at least a year and a half to build a team with strong backup. That's where both have to be on the same page about the process.""It is learnt that one of the major tasks is to speak with the senior players about their future plans. Captain Virat Kohli , R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja are all in their late 30s. ""These senior players are still a very important part of the team. But one may expect some tough discussions as well. The seniors will be kept in the loop about the vision of the selectors and coach. They will be asked to share how they plan their careers going into the next World Test Championship cycle and the ODI World Cup being about two years away,"" the source said.It may be noted that the turnaround time for the ICC Champions Trophy is very short after the fiveTest series. India have just three ODIs and five T20Is against England at home. The workload of the Test players will be reviewed. It is understood that the selectors, Rohit and Gambhir will also try to zero down on the core for the Champions Trophy.Gambhir is also keen on having a niche T20 team with T20 specialists only, and not multi-format players, which is likely to come up for debate. The confusion stems from the fact that India's multi-format players are often rested from T20I bilateral series. ""The T20 format requires specialists but there are a few players like Bumrah, Pant, Jaiswal and Gill who can't be ignored. Most of the T20I series are played against weaker oppositions or teams who also rest topline players. There is a line of thought that the youngsters in the T20 team then have to make way for the Test players when they are available,"" the source said.",Gautam Gambhir and Ajit Agarkar will work on roadmap for future of white-ball teams.

Friendship Beyond the Rivalry

From the sweltering courts of Miami to an emotional farewell in London, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer shared one of tennis’s most iconic rivalries, leaving behind a legacy that transcended the sport. Their 40 meetings across 18 years weren’t just battles for titles but a testament to their mutual respect and enduring friendship.""What a career, Rafa! I always hoped this day would never come,"" Federer wrote in a heartfelt tribute following Nadal’s retirement. ""Thank you for the unforgettable memories and all your incredible achievements in the game we love. It’s been an absolute honor!""Nadal led their head-to-head 24-16, including a 6-3 advantage in Grand Slam finals, yet the numbers tell only part of the story. Their rivalry redefined tennis, blending skill, resilience, and sportsmanship in a way that captivated fans worldwide.Their rivalry began in March 2004 when a fearless 17-year-old Nadal defeated the world number one Federer in straight sets in Miami. ""I really wanted to play this match against the world number one,"" Nadal said, recalling his nerves and excitement. Federer, impressed, predicted a future filled with rematches: ""I was impressed with what I saw.""From that first meeting to their last in 2019, Nadal and Federer delivered countless unforgettable moments.While their battles on the court were fierce, off it, the two shared an unshakable bond. Their emotional partnership in Federer’s final professional match at the 2022 Laver Cup symbolized their journey together. ""When Roger leaves the tour, an important part of my life is leaving too,"" a tearful Nadal admitted during the event.Federer echoed the sentiment at his retirement: ""I can call up Rafa and talk about anything... Any evening we spend together never feels like enough time.""","Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer's rivalry began in 2004 in Miami.

Virat & Rohit’s Home Struggles: Left-Arm Spin & Lost Intent? | Beyond the Boundary Highlights

The focus on Virat Kohli is getting closer and closer as the opening Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) in Perth approaches its start date -- November 22. And while many have doubted the batting icon's return to form from a lean phase in red-ball cricket since 2020, Australia's ace spinner Nathan Lyon believes that a champion player like Kohli is always a threat.The 36-year-old Lyon, who has played 129 Tests and is Australia's leading off-spinner with 530 Test wickets, will once again play a key role in Australia's bowling attack dominated by fast bowlers that will try to put the out-of-form Kohli under pressure right from the start of the series.Lyon says the respect Kohli has earned over the years with his performances can't be ignored just because he hasn't scored many runs lately.""Look at his record out here,"" Lyon said. ""Overall, look at his record. You don't write off champions. I've got nothing but respect for Virat,"" Lyon said, as quoted by the Australian Associated Press.Since his first tour of Australia in 2011-12, Kohli has scored 1352 runs in 25 innings across 13 Tests at an average of 54.08, including 6 hundreds and 4 fifties.However, Kohli has not been on the top of his game in the post-Covid era, with just two hundreds coming off his bat in the last 60 innings. Lately, in the Test series against Bangladesh and New Zealand at home before flying to Australia, Kohli aggregated just 192 runs in 10 innings.""I want to get him out. There's no point in hiding behind that, but it's challenging. It's been pretty amazing competing against him for so many times,"" Lyon said.India were whitewashed by New Zealand 0-3 at home before flying out to Australia, but Lyon felt not much should be read into that because of India's record in Australia in recent times.India won the series on their last two Test tours of Australia and are in possession of the BGT for the last decade.""They're dangerous all the time. They're a side full of superstars. They've got so much experience, but talented youth as well, and you can never write off that,"" said Lyon.""I was fascinated by that series against New Zealand, but we're expecting the best India that we've played against for a number of years now.""",India face Australia in first Test of Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) in Perth on November 22.

NEW DELHI: The third and final one-day international (ODI) between New Zealand and Sri Lanka in Pallekele was abandoned after just 21 overs due to persistent rain.Umpires officially called off the match at 7:45 PM local time (1415 GMT) as the weather showed no signs of improvement.The match was a dead rubber, with Sri Lanka already securing the series 2-0 following a thrilling three-wicket win on Sunday.Batting first after winning the toss, New Zealand were well-placed at 112 for 1 in 21 overs. Will Young (56* off 68 balls) and Henry Nicholls (46* off 51 balls) shared a solid 88-run stand for the second wicket, propelling their side towards a promising total.Young’s composed knock, his ninth ODI half-century, featured eight boundaries.Earlier, Sri Lankan skipper Charith Asalanka pulled off a sensational diving catch to dismiss opener Tim Robinson, giving Mohamed Shiraz his maiden international wicket. However, New Zealand recovered quickly with Young and Nicholls steadying the innings.Having already secured the series, Sri Lanka rested several key players, including Pathum Nissanka , Kusal Mendis, Kamindu Mendis, Asitha Fernando, and left-arm spinner Dunith Wellalage. Chamindu Wickramasinghe made his debut as a seam-bowling all-rounder.New Zealand also made changes, bringing in pacer Adam Milne and debutant all-rounder Zakary Foulkes for Nathan Smith and Jacob Duffy.

Australia batters will find it difficult and have issues of their own

NEW DELHI: Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly has voiced his confidence in the team's preparedness for the upcoming high-stakes five-match Test series against Australia, dismissing concerns about the team being ""undercooked.""""Undercooked is a term used when you haven't played any Test cricket at all. They have just played five Tests in the last seven weeks so how does the question even arise?"" the former BCCI president told PTI in an interview ahead of the marquee series.Speaking about the recent Test series loss to New Zealand, Ganguly acknowledged the unexpected nature of the defeat but emphasized the challenging nature of the pitches.""I can understand that the defeat against New Zealand was unexpected but you have to understand we played on some extremely difficult tracks. In Australia, the tracks will be good for batting,"" Ganguly said.He also highlighted the need for India to return to playing on balanced cricket tracks that foster both batting and bowling skills, suggesting that over-reliance on rank turners could hinder players' confidence and adaptability in different conditions.""I don't think so. But I must say that we need to get back to playing on good cricket pitches at home.""We should stop this habit of playing on rank turners. The batsmen lose confidence on such tracks and we have a team which can win Test matches on good tracks.""Also on turners, you need to learn to grind before you can attack. There are two types of tracks where you can't just hit through the line and get out of trouble. One is a seaming track and other being a rank turner.""Shubman Gill's thumb fracture is undoubtedly a setback for India, but Ganguly remains confident in the team's ability and mental strength to move past their recent shock loss.Gill, who boasts five centuries in 29 Tests, played pivotal roles during India’s previous tour, scoring a half-century in Melbourne and a match-defining 91 in Brisbane, which contributed to two memorable victories.However, the young opener sustained a left thumb fracture while fielding in an intra-squad simulation game between the senior team and India A, ruling him out of the first Test.""Shubman's injury is jolt for the team no doubt as he is an in-form batter and has scored in Australia. A thumb fracture could rule him out for two Tests.""But I believe the other batters would step up in absence of Rohit (on paternity leave) and Shubman during the first Test. I don't think New Zealand defeat would have any bearing on this series,"" the former BCCI president told PTI in an interview ahead of the marquee series.With Hardik Pandya no longer featuring in Test cricket, India lack genuine pace-bowling all-rounders. While Nitish Kumar Reddy remains relatively inexperienced, one of India's most celebrated captains believes the Andhra cricketer should be given opportunities in conditions that suit his skill set.""Look, there is absolutely no point in playing two specialist spinners either at Perth (Optus) or at the Gabba (Brisbane). You obviously need to find a way to play Reddy in these conditions. He is a good batsman and coming in at lower middle order, it will lend proper balance to the side,"" he gave his rationale for inclusion of a multi-skilled player.Ganguly also felt that Mohammed Shami should have travelled to Adelaide and played the second Test starting December 6, which is a day/night game. Shami is not being fast-tracked immediately by the selectors, who want him to play in Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament before taking a call on his travel Down Under.""Shami bowled nearly 45 overs, fielded for more than 100 overs and also scored some runs. That's a good enough fitness test to be sent to Australia because you need a bowler of his calibre alongside Jasprit Bumrah .""",Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly has voiced his confidence in the team's preparedness for the upcoming high-stakes five-match Test series against Australia. Ganguly also highlighted the need for India to return to playing on balanced cricket tracks that foster both batting and bowling skills.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115455677,imgsize-89064,width-400,resizemode-4/115455677.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Former India player Robin Uthappa has suggested Rajat Patidar as a potential captain for Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025.RCB will need to consider leadership alternatives for IPL 2025 , following their decision not to retain Faf du Plessis Despite the availability of established players like Jos Buttler, Rishabh Pant , and Shreyas Iyer in the mega auction, Uthappa recommends that RCB should consider giving Patidar an opportunity to lead the team.""I think they should look at Rajat Patidar to take over that role because it seems like you need a new leader after two years. So, you might as well do it now to get ahead of the curve and build a captain for the next three to five years. Rajat is one of those players who can actually play that role for them,"" Uthappa said on JioCinema.RCB opted for a strategic approach by keeping only three players in their roster. The franchise chose to retain Virat Kohli , Patidar and the emerging fast bowler Yash Dayal.This decision led to the departure of several key players from the team, including Mohammed Siraj Will Jacks and Glenn Maxwell. Armed with a substantial budget of Rs 83 crore and the Right To Match card, RCB aim to build a strong team capable of securing their maiden IPL championship.Former India cricketer Saba Karim suggests that RCB might utilise their Right to Match (RTM) option to secure both Mohammed Siraj and Will Jacks, considering their valuable contributions across various aspects of the game.""RCB can always go back to Siraj because he's been phenomenal for the side. They got Yash Dayal as a left-arm seam bowler, which is a wonderful thing, but they also need someone to give him proper company. So, if RCB can have Siraj, then at least the pace bowling section is kind of filled up. I'm also looking at Will Jacks. He was very good for them last season. He can come in right at the top, and he's also a very useful right-arm off-break bowler,"" Karim said.",Robin Uthappa has suggested Rajat Patidar as a potential captain for Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025.

Excerpts:

India have history on their side as they have won the last two BGT in Australia. Do you feel the buildup is a bit different this time around as compared to what happened during your playing days. Not many expected India to do well Down Under...

Over the years, the contest between the two sides has become one of the most sought after properties in the cricket calendar. You have played a lot of matches involving India and Australia... did you ever imagine that this will become as popular as The Ashes or a India-Pakistan contest?

Talking about Australia.

and Co. have achieved literally everything possible within their reach. So you reckon this BGT will probably tick most of the boxes off for most of these players who, like their Indian counterparts, are towards the fag end of their careers. How important is this series going to be for the likes of Cummins, (Mitchell) Starc etc...

Ravi Shastri, Rahul Dravid and now Gautam Gambhir. India have a new coach and he is set for the toughest challenge yet. What do you expect from the new Indian head coach since you have seen him very closely during your playing days and then during the IPL?

The last time India were in Australia, they had to deal with a lot of adverse situations. Player availability, injury and then a series during the COVID-19 period. Even this time around, there is a sense of unsettledness in the Indian camp with

, no

. Do you reckon the bowling will be overdependent on

?

Hardly any talk around the two but this series could well see two modern-day great off-spinners (

and Nathan Lyon) up against each other for probably the last time in Tests. How excited are you to see them perform for their respective sides because they have left a stamp the way they have played in the previous few series wherever India and Australia have met.

India prepare for tough Test series in Australia

You reckon India's fragility against spin in the recent past could be weighing up on Nathan Lyon's mind? World he be licking his fingers to have a crack at this Indian batting line-up?

Gautam Gambhir, head coach of India, looks on with Morne Morkel, bowling coach of India, during the practice match between India and India A at WACA in Perth. (Getty Images)

How much of a role do you think 'local boy' Morne Morkel, who is settled in Australia, will have to instill that group mentality. He certainly would know a thing or two about doing well in Australia, right? A world class bowler himself and now India's bowling coach.

You think India-Australia contests have become friendlier than what they used to be back in the day? The IPL probably bringing the players close and helping them forge those friendships.

KL Rahul made his Test debut in Australia, had scored a hundred. A decade later, he is still struggling for consistency. What would be your advice to him?

What are your thoughts on the Australian camp. Opening combination, team balance... from the outside, you reckon they are in a settled space?

The first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy is just three sleeps away and the excitement is building for what promises to be a cracking series between two quality sides. India have been training in Perth for more than a week now and the visitors have been rocked by some availability and injury concerns before the series opener on November 22.There is a lot of chatter around the form of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma but former Australia cricketer Mike Hussey expects India to put up a solid show in the five-match series.In an exclusive chat with, the former southpaw opens up on the series, India's new head coach Gautam Gambhir, battle of two great off-spinners, and more.I think everyone in Australia is really excited about the series and fascinated to see what's going to happen. I mean, yeah, India have won the last two times in Australia, so they'll certainly take some of that confidence into into the series. And I think quite a few of the Australian players will be really, really up for it and really keen to do well and almost try and put the record straight, because we don't lose too many times in Australia. So, it's going to be a fascinating series. It should be high-quality cricket. And I think everyone in the country just can't wait for it to start.The Ashes is always very special for an Australian and an English player as well. But, yeah, I'm not sure we can ever compete with India versus Pakistan. That's a unique series, and the rivalry is obviously very strong there. But yeah, I agree. India has turned themselves into a real powerhouse of world cricket. Australia have been pretty strong over the last 20 or 30 years. So I think the rivalry has really grown. And, two great teams, two great nations, going head to head. That's what everyone wants to see.I think Pat Cummins has still got a fair bit of cricket ahead of him. He's certainly not as old as a Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon , etc. So I think you'll want to keep going for a fair few years yet. But I know what you're saying. I think some of the players might see this as a their last opportunity to beat India in Australia. So that'll offer them some motivation. But to be honest, you don't need any extra motivation when you're playing in a Test match. Test series against India in Australia... I mean, it doesn't get much bigger than that, so I don't think they'll use it necessarily as extra motivation. But they'll want to win and and finish their careers with victory against India on home soil.Similar to when he was a player... he was a great competitor and he would fight all the way for victory. And so I have no doubt, watching him, sort of being involved with the IPL and teams that he's been involved in, he loves to win, and he loves to compete and I'm not expecting anything different from this Indian team. They've got some great fighters and some great competitors. So I'm sure his personality will come through with the way he coaches. And I think you need to have something like that in in Australian conditions. It's not easy coming to Australia and competing with a strong Australian team.And I think Ravi Shastri certainly brought that really competitive hard edge to the team when he was coaching the team as well, and real positiveness as well. Gambhir is someone that's done well in Australia in the past as well. He will have fond memories of coming here. He's a real fighter and a real competitor. And I'm sure he'll bring that in this Indian team as well.You think of the last series that India were in Australia, and they had a lot of adversity. They lost Shami early... . I think broke his arm and went home early as well. But they still managed to find a way and bring in new players and perform really well. And I think Ravi and the players need a lot of credit. Rahane led the team well and Ravi kept instilling his positive attitude in whoever came in... that they could compete and they could win in Australia. It's all about the having the right attitude. We know there's so much talent and so much depth in Indian cricket.We've seen it so many times to ride off champion players... pundits come out and say that Rohit Sharma is finished and Virat Kohli is no good anymore. I mean, that's just ridiculous. They're legend, legendary players. They're proud players. If you write them off, you're just going to end up having egg on your face, because they will perform well again. They're too good not to. I think it's silly to write them off and write off the Indian team as well. It's just not in my vocabulary.I think they'll both play really important roles for the team, and probably throw Jadeja in there as well. Nathan Lyon, we quite often say it as commentators, that he is actually the most important bowler in the Australian lineup because he can bowl a lot of overs. He can bowl in a attacking sense. He can bowl in a defensive sense. He allows the fast bowlers to rotate from the other end. And so he's such a crucial part of the Australian team.I think Ashwin, he might have struggled the first couple of times that he came to Australia, like a lot of players do. A smart bowler and a smart man over time, and over more tours, will figure out how to bowl well in Australian conditions. And so I'm expecting if he plays the majority of the Tests, I'm expecting him to have a really good series. And play a really important role for India because if he can bowl really well and strongly at one end, then that enables the captain to attack from the other end, to rotate the fast bowls around from the other end. So it's going to be a classic battle.And I know we talk about (Jasprit) Bumrah, we talk about Starc and Cummins and the like but it could be how the spinners go head to head, that could be the difference between the two teams in the end, you know, because they both play such important roles.The conditions in India are a lot different to what these they're going to pop in Australia. You know that the pitches generally will be a lot faster and bounce here... probably take a lot less spin. Nathan Lyon will have to just bowl well, like he always does in Australian conditions. And when he does bowl well, he's a real hand. The Australian attack just doesn't rely on Lyon or just Starc. They see it as a real group mentality.Talking on the group mentality, India too just can't rely on Bumrah. It'll have to be that group mentality for India to be able to win the series.It'll be very important but at the end of the day, the bowlers have to go out and do the job. Monet's got great experience about playing in Australia. He knows the conditions well. He's performed well himself, so he knows what it takes to play well in Australian conditions. And so that experience will be invaluable, no doubt. And I'm sure he's a he's a great person, a great character, and he will pass that, actually pass that mentality under the Indian bowlers as well. But at the end of the day, the Indian bowlers have to do the job.Both teams will really want to win for their countries, and you have pride in your own performance as well, whether they're friendly to each other in the middle, or they're not, or they're, you know, angry at each other, I don't think that'll have any bearing on the series at all. I think, you know, once it comes down. It's bat versus ball. It's country versus country, and that's all, that's all that matters at the end of the day.He's another fantastic player. So I guess, just to trust his game and to be confident with whatever he does, you know that's the most important thing. We know how good he is. And so I guess there's a lot of external people put these doubts in your mind, but I just hope that he just doesn't worry about all the external stuff and just concentrates on his game, his preparation, and just tries to play his best possible cricket, because when he's playing at his best, he's one of the best players in the world.And to be honest, that's what we want to see in this series. We want to see two great teams with great players from both sides, you know, going at it head to head. I'm sure if he can start well in the series, get a good score under his belt early, then that'll help his confidence the rest of the series.I think the team is pretty settled... There was a lot of talk in Australia about who was going to open the batting and it seems like they've settled on Nathan McSweeney to do that role. So I'm pretty sure that the Australian team is settled. They'll just go about their preparation and be ready to go for Friday.",Former Australia cricketer Mike Hussey expects India to put up a solid show in the five-match series.

Uninspiring Argentina

Jeers for Brazil

Lautaro Martinez's goal gave Argentina a 1-0 win over Peru on Tuesday in a South American qualifying match in Buenos Aires and left the hosts close to a spot in the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada.Their main continental rivals Brazil drew 1-1 against Uruguay in Salvador, Brazil with two impressive goals in an otherwise lackluster match. Federico Valverde gave Uruguay the lead with a curled shot from the edge of the box, and Gerson netted his first for Brazil in similar fashion at the Arena Fonte Nova.Argentina lead South American qualifying with 25 points from 12 matches, five points clear of its closest competitor, Uruguay. Ecuador and Colombia are next with 19 points each.Brazil lag in fifth position with 18 points after several uninspiring performances, still hoping that striker Neymar will return from injury and fit in again. Paraguay, with 17 points, are in sixth place.South American qualifying will give six direct berths in the next World Cup. Seventh-place Bolivia, with 13 points, are in the international playoff position. Venezuela (12), Chile (9), and Peru (7) are out of qualifying spots.The next round of South American World Cup qualifying will be played in March.Martinez's goal was his 32nd for the national team, which puts him level with the legendary Diego Maradona.Until Martinez scored, Argentina's best chance was in the 21st minute, when striker Julian Alvarez hit the Peruvian goalkeeper's right post. Messi once again had a modest performance, as he did in his team's 2-1 defeat at Paraguay on Thursday.Messi crossed the ball in the penalty area in the 55th minute to give Martinez one of the few clear opportunities of the match. The striker moved his body with more grace than power to put the ball in the back of the next.Despite the disappointing performance at home, Lionel Messi's team will finish the year with few question marks beyond its performances in November.“We won Copa America, we lead South American World Cup qualifying,” said goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez. “We must be proud of ourselves.”Brazil fans at home in Salvador jeered their team after the final whistle. In a match with few opportunities for either side, Uruguay seemed closer to winning for most of the second half.Valverde opened the scoring in the 55th minute after Brazilian defenders failed three times to clear the ball from their penalty area. The Real Madrid midfielder hit the ball to the left corner to score. Gerson equalised in the 61st minute.Striker Raphinha said he understood the frustration from his team's fans, but disagreed with them.“We played great. We did everything we could to leave here with a victory. We must have our heads high up, it will be very tough to beat us,” he said.Also on Tuesday, Ecuador won 1-0 at Colombia with a goal by Enner Valencia in the seventh minute, in which he dribbled through three players before scoring. Ecuador lost defender Piero Hincapié to a red card in the 34th minute but held on for the win.Bolivia and Paraguay drew 2-2 in a match between teams that could end up fighting for the seventh position in the region's qualifying. Chile, one of the worst performing teams in the region this year, showed some fighting spirit and beat Venezuela 4-2.","Argentina lead South American qualifying with 25 points from 12 matches, five points clear of its closest competitor, Uruguay.

They pressed hard for the first goal without success. The visitors went ahead through forward Paulo Josue. Goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh, who came out of the box to head the ball out, missed it completely and Josue gleefully accepted the gift.India found the equaliser in the 39th minute through defender Bheke, who headed a corner from Brandon Fernandes much to the delight of the home crowd that turned up in numbers.After changeover, both teams played safe. Malaysia's Farzur Amir had a great solo run on the right, but he was thwarted by the Indian de fenders in the 83rd minute.The hosts survived some anxious moments in injury time as the visitors nearly found the winner.Fergus Tierney 's header from Muhammad Safwan Bin's pass hit the post. On the rebound, Safawi Bin Rasid's shot sailed over.Coach Marquez called it a fair result. ""We conceded an easy goal. We knew the game would not be easy. But in the end, the score is fair. We didn't adapt well today. We didn't play with pace in the second half,"" said Monolo, who gave chances to a lot of players who have been doing well for their respective clubs this season.Malaysia's coach Pau Marti Vicente insisted that they were the better side.

When Andrej Kramarić hit the post and Josko Gvardiol had a 62nd minute goal ruled out for offside it looked like it might not be Croatia's night.Bu Manchester City's Gvardiol got the equaliser just a few minutes later and Croatia held on to take the second quarterfinal spot from Group A1.There was little to play for in Tenerife, where Spain, top of Group A4, took on the already relegated Switzerland.Coach Luis de la Fuente offered a first start to Barcelona midfielder Marc Casado and gave debuts to Samu and Aitor Paredes in a much-changed Spain side.But it was the two Bryans, Gil and Zaragoza, who got the goals that mattered for the European champions.Pedri's first half penalty was saved but Yeremi Pino converted to put Spain ahead.Joel Monteiro equalised for Switzerland after 63 minutes but Bryan Gil got Spain back in front five minutes later.

The opener was Northern Ireland's 100th under coach Michael O'Neill.However, even though the home side scored twice in the last 18 minutes, Northern Ireland ended its campaign with 11 points, two ahead of Bulgaria, which drew at home with Belarus 1-1.

""We've come close on a couple of occasions and the next step is for me and the other boys to win.""We have a new coach coming in March.

Argentina 's 1-2 defeat to Paraguay in the FIFA World Cup qualifier on Friday was marred by an incident, where the World Cup-winning captain Lionel Messi faced the ire of Paraguay fans, as a water bottle was thrown at him from the stands while he was taking a corner.The match got heated at half-time when Messi confronted the referee over a decision related to a tackle by Paraguay defender Omar Alderete .Five minutes after getting a yellow card in the first half, Alderete brought Messi down to foil an attack; but the referee didn't pull up Alderete for a second yellow, much to the annoyance of Argentine players.The Paraguay fans, perhaps, reacted to Messi confronting the referee.However, Alderete apologized for the action of the fans and apologised to the legend in an Instagram post.""Dear Leo Messi, I want to apologize on behalf of my country for the unfortunate incident in which someone threw a bottle at you. You are an idol for millions here and around the world"", he wrote.""This deeply disrespectful act does not represent the affection and admiration we feel for you.""Talking about the game, Argentina took the lead early with a Lautaro Martinez strike in the 11th minute.
