Poll Will Praggnanandhaa become the next World Chess Champion? Yes, definitely! Maybe in the future. No, he won't. Unsure at this moment.

Dutch No.1 Grandmaster Anish Giri, 31, sparked conversation across the chess world on Friday with a tongue-in-cheek reaction to R Praggnanandhaa becoming the new World No.1 junior.“Chess juniors nowadays have to be at least U16, keeping track of U20 players is totally pointless,” Giri, who currently holds the live rating of 2748.0 and is world no. 10, wrote, hinting at how elite young talents are now already competing at the top of the senior world rankings.The remark came shortly after 19-year-old Praggnanandhaa’s remarkable victory at the UzChess Cup Masters 2025 in Uzbekistan, which propelled him to a live rating of 2778.3 — making him the World No.4 overall and officially India’s highest-rated chess player.He leapfrogged both World Champion D Gukesh (2776.6) and Arjun Erigaisi (2775.7), reshuffling the Indian chess hierarchy.Praggnanandhaa’s road to victory was nothing short of dramatic. Starting the final day behind both Nodirbek Abdusattorov and Javokhir Sindarov, he scored a crucial win over Abdusattorov in the last classical round to force a three-way tie.In the blitz tiebreaks, Praggnanandhaa showed nerves of steel, eventually winning the tournament in the second set of rapid games — his third major classical title of the year.Five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand applauded the youngster, stating, “This win seemed the least likely with just two rounds to go… An impressive demonstration of character.”With this triumph, Praggnanandhaa adds the UzChess Cup to his 2025 title haul, which already includes victories at the Tata Steel Chess Tournament and the Superbet Classic in Romania. He also recently finished runner-up at the Stepan Avagyan Memorial.While Giri’s comment playfully downplays the relevance of junior rankings, Praggnanandhaa’s performance makes one thing clear — the future of world chess is already here, and it’s thriving in India.",R Praggnanandhaa is the new World No.4 chess player. The 19-year-old won the UzChess Cup Masters 2025 in Uzbekistan. He leapfrogged both World Champion D Gukesh (2776.6) and Arjun Erigaisi (2775.7),"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122129282,imgsize-54150,width-400,resizemode-4/122129282.jpg"

Toronto Maple Leafs era ends as Mitch Marner moves on



Mitch Marner's impending departure from the Toronto Maple Leafs, added an emotional twist to the 2025 offseason. As for many years, Marner has been a mainstay in Toronto's top lines, producing two-way play of the highest calibre. His farewell, a nostalgic media appearance. Also with past-tense references, fans and analysts believe the writing is on the wall.Mitch Marner’s expected departure is more than just a roster change. It necessitates a comprehensive reassessment of Toronto’s structure, identity, and short-term objectives. The club now has a rare opportunity to reset over $10 million in cap space and recalibrate a roster that has long underperformed in the playoffs, especially in high-pressure postseason moments where offensive depth and defensive reliability often faltered.Trade and free agent speculation will dominate the coming weeks, with potential targets like Elias Lindholm or Martin Necas being floated but nothing can truly replace the consistency and chemistry Marner brought to the Maple Leafs lineup.What truly made Marner’s farewell resonate was his candid reflection on the off-ice toll of playing in Toronto. He spoke of the strain on his family, especially his wife Stephanie, as the hockey-mad city often directed its frustrations toward him during playoff losses.The stress of being a high-profile figure in a market as intense as Toronto likely played a large part in his decision, and the opportunity to play elsewhere, possibly with the Anaheim Ducks or Seattle Kraken, two teams with strong rebuild potential and passionate yet less invasive fan bases. This could bring the balance and freedom his personal life demands.For Marner, this isn’t just a hockey decision, it’s a personal pivot aimed at preserving both performance and well-being in the next chapter of his NHL career.Mitch Marner’s career with the Maple Leafs was more than numbers. It was connection, growth, and at times, heartbreak, from a hometown hero to a polarizing figure under pressure. Marner’s evolution mirrored the highs and lows of a team struggling to meet its potential.Now, as Toronto prepares to write its next chapter. The absence of number 16 will be felt in more ways than one.Marner’s emotional exit signals more than just a player leaving, it’s the end of an era.

Trey Hendrickson still waiting as Bengals’ contract offer fails to match market value

Bengals Star Trey Hendrickson SOUNDS OFF on Contract Status, Future in Cincinnati

Bengals defense needs Trey Hendrickson now more than ever



Trey Hendrickson has officially turned down a $28 million-per-year offer from the Cincinnati Bengals, intensifying his contract holdout and casting serious doubt over his future with the team. Despite leading the NFL in sacks last season, the star EDGE rusher remains unsigned long-term, fueling speculation that one of Cincinnati’s most dominant defenders could be on his way out in 2025.Trey Hendrickson isn’t just another pass rusher, he’s the most productive EDGE defender in the NFL over the last two seasons. After posting a league-leading 17 sacks in 2024 and a staggering total of 35 since 2023, Hendrickson has become the anchor of a Bengals defense that desperately needs his presence.Yet, despite his performance, the Bengals have reportedly offered just $28 million annually—a figure well below market value for a player of Hendrickson’s caliber. While the deal would place him eighth among NFL EDGE defenders in annual salary, it still falls short of what most believe he’s worth in today’s rising salary cap environment.According to NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, Hendrickson isn’t demanding to surpass Myles Garrett’s record-setting $40 million AAV.Instead, he’s seeking multi-year security that reflects his elite status and long-term impact in Cincinnati.“He would like to get a multi-year deal that gives him security and keeps him in Cincinnati,” Pelissero stated on The Rich Eisen Show. “Bengals just have not stepped up with significant enough of an offer for him to take it.”The Bengals’ hesitation to lock in Trey Hendrickson is raising concerns—especially after their defense struggled during the 2024 season. With Joe Burrow returning healthy, Cincinnati is back in win-now mode. Losing their top defensive player could seriously hurt those chances.Also Read: Michael Penix Jr. takes over as Falcons’ starting QB; $27.5M Kirk Cousins moved to backup role To make matters worse, stars like T.J. Watt are also due for new deals, and market prices are rising. If the Bengals wait too long, they risk overpaying later or losing Hendrickson entirely. And if that happens, the Bengals may find out just how hard it is to replace a true game-changer off the edge.","Trey Hendrickson has officially turned down a $28 million-per-year offer from the Cincinnati Bengals.

Her withdrawal followed a challenging period where she became the first leader after veteran Chandi Dayle's resignation due to a rule violation during a team trip to the Bahamas.KayDianna Garza, a fourth-year DCC member for the 2024-2025 NFL season, initially joined in 2021 to ‘validate her own abilities,’ stating, ""All my life people believed that I was a great performer and dancer, but I never believed that myself. Trying out for DCC was my way of showing myself what everyone else saw in me!"" She especially valued the emphasis on ‘sisterhood’ and giving back.The ""Bahamas incident"" significantly disrupted the DCC. Chandi Dayle allegedly violated policy by sharing the team's hotel with an unknown man. Dayle explained, ""I was just kind of crumbling down and I was like, 'Dang, I feel like I have no one here to talk to, so it's nice to have someone to confide in.' I broke a DCC rule and had time with my friend. It was probably the wrong place and time to do that, but selfishly, I had to do it for me because I feel like I was just losing it.""

Garza stated, ""I definitely didn't feel supported, I felt like I was just a body. It was as if Chandi got the perks of being a first leader and I got the responsibility part of it."" Kelli Kelli Finglass verified Garza's exit was ""her choice.”On April 27, 2025, Garza announced her departure on Instagram: ""After prayerful consideration, I have made the decision to step away from my role with the Dallas Cowboys organization.

A crushing loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl didn’t just cost them a title, it fractured the image of invincibility around Patrick Mahomes. For years, Mahomes symbolized calm under pressure, football brilliance, and leadership. But this season’s finale exposed cracks in both the quarterback and the franchise’s identity.While Mahomes posted respectable numbers, the fire and fearlessness that once defined his game were missing when it mattered most. His throws lacked urgency, his body language reflected frustration, and his leadership seemed muted. Fans were stunned not just by the loss, but by Mahomes’ inability to rally the team when it mattered. For a player used to miracle moments, this ending felt eerily quiet.Behind closed doors, questions are swirling about Mahomes' mental fatigue and whether he’s burdened by the weight of his own myth. A former rival defensive end criticized his “emotional flatline” during crunch time, calling it a sign of pressure getting to him.The narrative isn’t just about poor play anymore — it’s about whether Mahomes has lost the edge that once terrified defenses. This shift is rippling through the locker room and the fanbase alike.This wasn’t just Mahomes’ loss — it was the Chiefs’ cultural reckoning. The team, once known for resilience and composure, looked shell-shocked against the Eagles. Internal sources suggest a lack of vocal leadership, waning morale, and strategic confusion throughout the postseason run. Now, management faces a critical decision: rebuild the team’s emotional foundation, or risk long-term damage to the franchise’s core.Also read: Russell Wilson’s NFL redemption tour begins in New York after Giants’ brutal season As the 2025 season looms, the pressure is now twofold — Mahomes must rediscover his identity, and the Chiefs must reignite a culture of belief. The talent remains, but the aura has cracked. Whether Mahomes bounces back as the fearless icon or fades into just another “what if” story will define Kansas City’s next era. The road to redemption has begun — but this time, it starts from within.",The Kansas City Chiefs' 2024 season ended not just in defeat — but in disillusionment.

Poll Which aspect of Praggnanandhaa's game has improved the most? Confidence Calmness under pressure Strategic thinking

Exclusive | Arjuna Awardee Vantika Agrawal: 'People still ask, 'Chess is fine, but what do you really do?''

When Magnus Carlsen slammed his fist on the table after a shocking loss to D Gukesh at the elite Norway Chess tournament, the moment went viral — a rare, raw display of frustration from a modern-day chess titan. To many, it was a sign that the young Indian brigade is finally rattling the very foundation Carlsen built.But for 19-year-old Grandmaster R Praggnanandhaa, the incident was something else entirely: a reminder of just how far one must go to reach that level of passion and dominance.""Yes, it was an instinctive reaction. I think it does happen to players. I've done it sometimes, but rarely,"" Praggnanandhaa told PTI.""I mean, it's (me hitting the table) not as powerful as Magnus because he's a strong guy, but Gukesh has done it and many others. It's just an instinctive reaction because you're so focused that it just comes out.""But, I mean, is it a good thing? Maybe not. I don't think so because I guess it's not good. (Having said that), I think so many people got to know that something like this happened and it became such a big thing on the internet.""And, I think it's good for the game in a way because a lot of people got to know that there was such a tournament going on and that such a dramatic game happened.""So, I think there are some good things and bad things, but I think overall, chess is growing. That's what matters.""""I think Magnus is still the best player in the world. There’s no question about it,"" Praggnanandhaa added. ""Every time he plays, he’s the favourite. His performance — like winning 9 out of 9 in the Grand Slam Freestyle — that’s something only he can do. It’s just brilliant.""Yet, while Carlsen remains the benchmark, Praggnanandhaa’s own rise has been just as headline-worthy.After a quiet 2024, the teenager has exploded into form this year, winning three major classical titles — the Tata Steel Masters, Superbet Classic in Bucharest, and the UzChess Cup Masters — and leapfrogging both world champion Gukesh and Arjun Erigaisi to become India’s highest-rated player at World No. 4.So what changed?“I wasn't able to win as many games as I would have liked to (last year), but yeah, I'm much more confident now and much more ambitious than earlier. And, hopefully, I'll make it to the Candidates,” said Praggnanandhaa.READ ALSO: Exclusive | No Magnus Carlsen in India! Freestyle Chess event called off over lack of sponsors ""I'm not sure how to answer that. But, I mean, I try to give my best in every tournament, and this year has been going my way so far.""It’s not just the titles, but the manner of his victories — two of them coming through nerve-wracking tie-breaks — that point to a more seasoned, composed player.“I do think tie-breaks require some luck. Because there were moments where I needed them. But I think being calm also helps in such situations where you are playing for high stakes in such a short time. I do feel the tension. It's not like I don't feel it. But I'm able to play much more calmer than my opponents,"" he added.That measured response mirrors his approach to the Candidates race — the gateway to a world championship match. ""Yes, there are different (several) spots, of course. I am currently leading (the race for a Candidates spot) but there is still a lot of fight till December. But I think, I mean, I will also be playing the Grand Swiss and the World Cup. So, if I can make it in one of those, that will be better because I don't have to wait till December,"" he continued.Still, he’s acutely aware of the high standards set by his peers.“But, I think, overall, we (Indians) are doing well. Gukesh winning the World Championship, his performance last year, he won gold in the Olympiad, he won the Candidates... and Arjun crossing 2800 in an exceptional last year. We are also inspiring each other,"" Pragg said.","R Praggnanandhaa says Magnus Carlsen is still the best player in the world.

NEW DELHI: India pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah and sports presenter Sanjana Ganesan revealed the hilarious story of their first meeting during the 2019 ODI World Cup in England - a moment Sanjana thought he was ""either married or being watched"" by a girlfriend. The couple, now married with a son, shared the story on Who’s The Boss?, hosted by Harbhajan Singh and Geeta Basra Recollecting the moment, Sanjana said, ""This was in 2019 during the World Cup. I was around the Indian team during practices. The other boys like DK [Dinesh Karthik] used to wave and say hi. Jasprit was in the group but made this face, like ‘I’m not going to say hi or even make eye contact.’""Assuming he was deliberately avoiding her, Sanjana joked, ""Mujhe laga maybe girlfriend hogi, wife hogi [I thought maybe he had a girlfriend or wife watching him]. I was like either I’ve done something wrong, or that’s his personality!""However, as the two started interacting more, the ice quickly melted. ""Once we spoke, we understood each other. Turns out, he’s not like that at all,"" Sanjana added.Bumrah, laughing off the incident, responded, ""This story is very one-sided! She thought I was married? My nature is shy.I don’t randomly go around saying ‘hi’ to people. It takes time for me to open up.""""Her logic was that I didn’t say hi, so I must be married and being watched - what kind of logic is that?"" he joked.The couple tied the knot in March 2021 and welcomed their son, Angad, in September 2023.

Poll Which debutant's achievement do you find more impressive? Dewald Brevis - Fastest fifty Lhuan-dre Pretorius - Youngest centurion

India’s Day 2 at the Nets in Edgbaston | IND vs ENG Test Series

Jasprit Bumrah: India’s Spearhead Locked In for 2nd Test?

South Africa's cricket team, fresh from their World Test Championship victory, has returned to Test cricket against Zimbabwe at Queen Sports Club in Bulawayo, where two debutants made history.Dewald Brevis set a world record for the fastest fifty in a debut Test innings, while Lhuan-dre Pretorius became South Africa's youngest Test centurion at 19 years and 93 days, breaking Graeme Pollock's 61-year-old record.The Test match, which falls outside the World Test Championship 2025-27 cycle, saw several regular South African players absent, creating opportunities for new talent to emerge. The team's decision to blood young players proved fruitful as both debutants delivered remarkable performances.Dewald Brevis, known for his association with Chennai Super Kings , demonstrated his aggressive batting style by scoring 51 runs off just 41 balls. His innings included three fours and four sixes, with his half-century coming in 38 balls, establishing a new record for the fastest fifty in a debut Test innings.The significance of Brevis's achievement becomes apparent when compared to previous records. While New Zealand's Tim Southee had scored a 29-ball fifty and England's Jacob Bethell achieved a 37-ball fifty on their debuts, both these performances came in their second innings.Brevis's record stands unique as it was accomplished in his first Test innings.The South African innings faced early trouble when the team lost their first four wickets for just 55 runs. However, Brevis and Pretorius formed a crucial 95-run partnership for the fifth wicket, steering their team away from difficulty.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Lhuan-dre Pretorius's achievement holds particular significance in South African cricket history. At 19 years and 93 days, he surpassed the long-standing record held by Graeme Pollock, who had scored his century against Australia in 1964 at 19 years and 317 days.The partnership between Brevis and Pretorius not only rescued South Africa from a precarious position but also showcased the depth of young talent in South African cricket. Their performance demonstrated the potential benefits of giving opportunities to young players in international cricket.The timing of these achievements gains additional context considering South Africa's recent World Test Championship victory. While this match against Zimbabwe doesn't contribute to the WTC 2025-27 cycle, it has provided a platform for emerging talents to make their mark in international cricket.The absence of regular team members, while potentially seen as a limitation, has opened doors for these young cricketers to showcase their abilities at the highest level. The success of both debutants validates South Africa's strategy of nurturing young talent and providing them with opportunities in international cricket.The historic achievements by both Brevis and Pretorius at the Queen Sports Club have added a significant chapter to South African cricket history, particularly in the context of Test cricket debuts and age-related records. Their performances have set new benchmarks for future generations of South African cricketers.","Dewald Brevis set a world record for the fastest fifty in a debut Test innings.

India may have lost the first Test of the ongoing five-match series against England, but the performance of their top-order batters was a major positive to take forward. At Headingley, while the lower order collapsed in both innings, the likes of Shubman Gill , KL Rahul, and Yashasvi Jaiswal scored centuries, and Rishabh Pant smashed brilliant hundreds in each innings to keep India in the fight.Looking ahead to the crucial second Test at Edgbaston, former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar is confident that Pant will continue his sublime form. Speaking on Star Sports’ ‘Game Plan’ show, Manjrekar praised Pant’s hunger and determination to make big scores in the longest format.“I think he (Rishabh Pant) will carry on because it seems like he enjoys batting in Test cricket. Any batter who gets two hundreds in a single Test, it takes a lot out of you mentally. To do it again within 48 hours shows the hallmark of an exceptional player,” Manjrekar said.Highlighting another senior batter, Manjrekar pointed out that KL Rahul must keep his good form going for the remainder of the series. “Rishabh Pant enjoys playing Tests. He has not scored enough runs in recent times, so he is hungry. I see him continuing this form, but there is another senior batter who now has no choice but to carry his form through the series.Indian cricket needs him badly and KL Rahul cannot be a one-hundred wonder or a one-Test-match performer,” he added.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? India will have to bounce back strongly in the second Test, which starts on July 2 in Birmingham. The challenge could get tougher with pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah likely to miss the match for workload management.England, on the other hand, have bolstered their squad with Jofra Archer, adding more firepower to their pace attack.

Nick Knight EXCLUSIVE: On Shubman Gill and absence of Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma in England

Former India Test captain and current ODI skipper Rohit Sharma , who recently retired from red-ball cricket at the age of 38, was seen vacationing with his family in Europe.Rohit has been seen sharing photos of his family regularly in the past couple of day.Rohit, now focused solely on One-Day Internationals, next cricketing assignment is scheduled for August, when India tours Bangladesh for a three-match ODI series starting on August 17.A year ago it was under Rohit Sharma's captaincy that India ended their 13 year long wait to win an ICC Trophy.“Barbados will forever be in my veins. This is the proudest moment of my cricketing career. To lift that trophy, to be crowned ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 Champions—it was surreal. I played in the inaugural 2007 T20 World Cup and we won under MS Dhoni’s captaincy. And now, to win it again with Rahul Dravid as head coach—it meant everything to this group.“We’ve seen heartbreak. We’ve come so close. That’s why this one was so special. We worked and planned relentlessly—every day. And when we finally won, all the emotions came pouring out. The younger players, especially those playing their first World Cup, realised how hard it is to win one.Nothing can be taken for granted. It was magical,” said Rohit to JioHotstar.What was going through his mind before taking the field for the final, which also became his last game for India in T20Is after the championship glory was achieved? Rohit admitted that he didn’t sleep well in the night before the final and nervous energy led to him waking up much earlier than expected.“Thirteen years is a long time. Most people don’t even have a 13-year career. So, to wait that long to win a World Cup… the last one I won was in 2007. For me, it couldn't have gotten any bigger than this. I didn’t sleep the whole night. I was only thinking about the World Cup. I was nervous. I couldn’t feel my legs. Did I feel nerves? Of course.“I just don’t show it—but inside, it was a lot. We were supposed to leave around 8:30 or 9 in the morning. But I woke up at 7. From my room, I could see the ground and just kept watching it. I remember thinking—‘In two hours, I’ll be there. And in four hours, the result will be out. Either the Cup will be here or it won’t.""","Rohit Sharma is currently vacationing with his family in Europe.

Alex Formenton 's rise through the ranks and unexpected career halt

Legal charges tied to 2018 Team Canada incident

Once viewed as one of the Ottawa Senators' most promising young forwards, Alex Formenton has found himself at the center of one of Canadian hockey’s most disturbing scandals. Now 25, the former NHL player is currently standing trial for his alleged role in the 2018 Hockey Canada sexual assault case, a saga that has shaken the foundations of the sport across the country.Born in King, Ontario, Alex Formenton was drafted 47th overall by the Ottawa Senators in 2017. Known for his speed and versatility on the left wing, he earned early praise for his potential and work ethic. He played parts of three seasons with the Senators and was considered a valuable penalty killer and depth scorer, notching 18 goals in the 2021–22 season.However, his promising career came to a screeching halt when contract negotiations with Ottawa stalled amid rising speculation about his involvement in the alleged 2018 group sexual assault involving members of Canada’s World Junior team.As a restricted free agent, Formenton was left unsigned and later moved overseas to play for HC Ambrì-Piotta in Switzerland. In 2025, he stepped away from professional hockey entirely and began working in construction in his hometown.The turning point came on January 28, 2024, when Formenton turned himself in to London police. He was officially charged with one count of sexual assault related to an incident that allegedly took place in June 2018, shortly after Team Canada’s World Junior Championship victory.“Formenton had ‘moved on from a hockey career,’” read court documents filed in August 2024. Despite this claim, the implications of his past actions continue to follow him into the courtroom. He has pleaded not guilty, and his trial began in April 2025.In a twist that further complicates his public image, Formenton is also seeking $20 million in damages from his former agency. He alleges that he was misadvised during contract negotiations, which ultimately left him vulnerable when his hockey career unraveled due to the criminal investigation.Also Read: Who is Carter Hart?

Speaking on the future of the Rodgers-Steelers relationship, Harrison didn’t mince words: if the team struggles, he believes Rodgers’ time in Pittsburgh could end sooner than expected.“If Rodgers isn’t working out, and the Steelers aren’t winning, the distraction will be too much,” Harrison said, adding that the team might choose to “move on by the midway point.”This isn’t Harrison taking a personal shot at Rodgers—it’s coming from someone who has seen plenty of locker room drama during his time in Pittsburgh. His comments reflect a concern that Rodgers’ larger-than-life presence could become a liability if things go south.This isn’t the first time Pittsburgh has gambled on a new quarterback. After a string of underwhelming seasons post-Roethlisberger, the franchise has cycled through short-lived experiments at QB, none offering long-term stability.That history raises the stakes for Rodgers’ tenure even more.While head coach Mike Tomlin has not commented on any potential contingency plans, there’s no denying the expectations are sky-high—and the margin for error razor thin.If Rodgers performs like his old self, the Steelers could be contenders. But if the offense stumbles early, the pressure from fans, media, and even inside the building could force a radical decision.Rodgers may be the most accomplished quarterback the Steelers have had in years, but that won’t guarantee job security. As James Harrison made clear, “unless they’re winning, the Steelers-Rodgers relationship isn’t going to work out.”Also Read: ""A spoiled child"": Aaron Rodgers slammed as overrated and selfish in final NFL season amid Tom Brady comparisons For now, Rodgers is saying the right things and doing what leaders do.

Jabari Smith Jr. wants to sign a $122 million contract extension with Houston Rockets for five years through 2031,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/jabari-smith-jr-wants-to-sign-a-122-million-contract-extension-with-houston-rockets-for-five-years-through-2031/articleshow/122149668.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Houston Rockets bet big on youth by locking in Jabari Smith Jr through 2031

At just 22 years old, Jabari Smith Jr. isn’t just putting pen to paper on a deal—he’s committing to be the face of Houston ’s future. The Rockets’ move to offer him a fully guaranteed $122 million speaks volumes. He’s more than just a promising forward now; he’s a foundational piece of the franchise. After a playoff run and a Durant trade that didn’t involve him, one thing is clear—Smith is at the heart of Houston’s ambitious plans.The extension is said to include a massive $122 million commitment over five years—completely guaranteed—putting Smith among the highest-paid young forwards in the league. At only 22, Smith is already seen as a key piece of the Rockets’ future plans, especially after the big trade that brought Kevin Durant to Houston. In fact, the Rockets turned down offers from Phoenix to include Smith in the trade, making their stance clear.Last season Smith averaged a respectable 12.2 points and 7.0 rebounds in 57 games and that was with a broken left hand during the month of January keeping him off the court to a large extent. More surprising is the way he played in the playoffs, shooting 45.5% behind the arc in fewer than 20 minutes per game, which proves that he can do more when needed.His rim-protecting ability, particularly his ability to stretch the floor, is what makes him the perfect stretch-four of the present era.This announcement is a piece of a wider early offseason activity by the Rockets. Besides locking in Smith, Houston has also extended Fred VanVleet, Jae’Sean Tate, Aaron Holiday, Jeff Green, Steven Adams, and even coach Ime Udoka. Smith’s extension not only maintains stability on the court but also establishes a foundation for Houston to grow, even as they aim for titles with superstars like Durant.Still, this agreement carries increased expectations. A total guarantee indicates that the organization has faith in Smith to evolve into a dependable two-way contributor. With his shooting on the rise and his defensive instincts still sharp, this extension isn’t just a precaution—it’s a wholehearted acceptance of his potential.Also Read: James Harden stuns at Paris Fashion Week amid legal issues and a $36M Clippers deadline ticking fast Smith’s extension is way bigger than the usual rookie deals and raises the stakes for his next performance. He’s got to keep up that playoff shooting vibe and steer clear of the ups and downs that marked his regular season. If he can juggle scoring, rebounding, and shooting while keeping fit, Smith might turn into the player Houston hoped for when they picked him No. 3 overall in 2022 from Auburn.","Houston Rockets bet big on youth by locking in Jabari Smith Jr through 2031.

Are Sabrina Carpenter and Oregon QB Luke Moga dating? Viral burger date fuels speculation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/are-sabrina-carpenter-and-oregon-qb-luke-moga-dating-viral-burger-date-fuels-speculation/articleshow/122142503.cms,"Sabrina Carpenter and Oregon quarterback Luke Moga sparked dating rumors (Images via Getty Images & IG)

Pop star meets rising QB: Viral burger outing fuels unlikely romance buzz

College football just collided with pop stardom—and it’s not because of a touchdown. Sabrina Carpenter , the chart-topping singer currently dominating headlines for her bold performances and empowering messages, is now at the center of a budding dating rumor with Oregon quarterback Luke Moga. The pair were recently spotted sharing a casual meal in Eugene, Oregon, and it didn’t take long for the photo to explode across social media.The unexpected pairing— Sabrina Carpenter in her pink pop prime and Luke Moga, a redshirt freshman who has yet to take a college snap—has sent fans into a frenzy. While neither party has confirmed anything romantic, the internet is doing what it does best: fueling the speculation with memes, jokes, and full-blown shipping. And it wasn’t just fans who chimed in.Cleveland Browns rookie Dillon Gabriel, who previously played at Oregon, threw fuel on the fire with a playful Instagram story after the viral burger date. Sharing the image, he wrote: “Hard launch bro! Happy for you guys.” The cheeky remark instantly sparked even more buzz, with Ducks fans declaring Moga “QB1”—not just on the field, but in the dating game too.Gabriel’s comment may have been in jest, but it amplified the attention Moga is receiving both as a potential starter and as a rising social media personality.For a quarterback who hasn’t even made his collegiate debut, being linked to Sabrina Carpenter is the kind of PR that can elevate a brand overnight.Moga is far from just a viral sensation. The dual-threat quarterback threw for nearly 1,900 yards and 23 touchdowns in his senior year of high school, while rushing for over 650 yards and 12 touchdowns. Oregon head coach Dan Lanning has praised the depth in his quarterback room, and now with Moga gaining national attention, that spotlight only intensifies.Also Read: Why Taylor Swift’s love life feels louder with Travis Kelce than it ever did with Joe Alwyn Whether it’s a real romance or a media-driven moment, one thing is clear: Luke Moga is suddenly a name fans—and maybe even rivals—won’t forget.

From early rejection to national spotlight

A trained dancer with elite experience

Balancing beauty, brains, and branding

The second season of Netflix’s America’s Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders has done more than pull back the curtain on the glitz and grind of NFL cheerleading — it’s made Ava Lahey a household name. Since the June 18, 2025 premiere, viewers have been captivated by Lahey’s journey, resilience, and undeniable screen presence, turning her into an instant fan favorite.Ava Lahey’s rise didn’t happen overnight. Originally from Jacksonville, Florida, her first audition with the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders (DCC) in 2021 ended in disappointment, with Lahey being cut during the final selection stage. That moment, described in the series as “heartbreaking,” could have ended her dream — but instead, it became the foundation of her underdog narrative.This season, fans watched her finally make the cut and flourish as a rookie on the team. Lahey’s combination of technical precision and emotional vulnerability struck a chord with audiences looking for more than just high kicks and sequins.Lahey’s performance isn’t just about raw ambition — it’s backed by a lifetime of training. Beginning dance at age two, she mastered a wide range of styles, from lyrical and hip-hop to classical ballet.She danced competitively from age nine and performed with the Springfield Ballet Company, taking on roles in Swan Lake, The Nutcracker, and Cinderella.She also trained with some of the most prestigious ballet programs in the country, including the Joffrey Ballet, Houston Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, and Pacific Northwest Ballet — a résumé few NFL cheerleaders can rival.Ava graduated from the University of Kentucky, where she was part of the dance team for two years, adding a collegiate athletic edge to her ballet background. Off the field, she works as a social media manager at a local beauty school — a fitting career for someone who knows how to command attention both online and on stage.This season of America’s Sweethearts ends with an important milestone: a long-overdue pay raise for the DCC squad. The docuseries doesn’t just entertain — it highlights the intense work, dedication, and underappreciated labor of NFL cheerleaders. And Ava Lahey’s story is at the heart of that shift.Also Read: Was KayDianna Garza silenced for exposing the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader scandal?

A changing landscape as teams prepare for July 1

As July 1 approaches, all eyes in the hockey world are locked on one name—Connor McDavid. The Edmonton Oilers’ superstar has the ability to swing the competitive balance of the NHL like no other, and his potential availability in free agency is sending shockwaves through the league. Whether he stays or explores new options, McDavid’s decision could become a defining moment in modern NHL history.Connor McDavid is not just a player; he’s a franchise-altering force. With unmatched speed, elite playmaking, and a long list of personal accolades, he’s widely viewed as the most dynamic talent of his generation. His presence can instantly elevate a team from playoff hopeful to Cup contender. That’s why rumors of a potential free agency shake-up are being treated with the weight of a league-wide pivot point.Even the possibility of McDavid testing the market has front offices re-evaluating their summer strategy. Cap space is being restructured, trade possibilities rechecked, and long-term plans adjusted—all to be prepared if the Oilers captain becomes available.Several contenders are believed to be in “watch mode,” waiting to see how the situation unfolds. While the Oilers are doing everything possible to keep their cornerstone, the reality of modern NHL economics means no scenario is off the table.If McDavid does move, it won’t just be about where he lands—it will be about dominoes that fall afterward. His signing could trigger a chain reaction: trades, rival signings, and possibly even reshaping how top-tier contracts are negotiated in the years ahead.Should McDavid hit free agency, it will be one of the most significant shifts in NHL history.

""I’m still googling everything"": A mom of four keeps it real



In the Kelce household, life is anything but quiet—and Kylie Kelce wouldn’t have it any other way. As a mother to four daughters under six, she’s experiencing the wild beauty of girlhood in full force. But lately, it’s not the diapers or sleepless nights that have her raising eyebrows—it’s the rapidly shifting alliances among her daughters. From harmless play to full-blown toddler teamwork, Kylie is witnessing sisterhood evolve into strategic rebellion.The growing bond between her middle daughters, Elliotte and Bennett, is now creating unexpected parenting challenges. During an appearance on the House of Maher podcast, Kylie opened up about how the pair are starting to test boundaries—together. ""But now our second and our third seem to be pairing up, so I'm a little bit worried about that because of the power of suggestion [and] how it works on our second and how manipulative our third is,"" she explained, giving a glimpse into the tactical nature of toddler behavior.While many parents can relate to sibling mischief, Kylie’s youngest troublemaker has taken things to another level. Bennett, now in full toddler mode, has quickly earned a reputation as the family firecracker.“She’s bats--t crazy,” Kylie added with laughter, reflecting on the unpredictability that defines her days. One example? A simple attempt to reduce laundry spiraled into a fashion rebellion as Bennett insisted on endless outfit changes.Kylie and her husband, former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, welcomed their fourth daughter, Finnley, in March. The couple is no stranger to chaos, but juggling four distinct personalities has been its own learning curve. Wyatt, the eldest at 5, brings maturity to the mix, while Elliotte and Bennett stir the pot—and Finnley quietly observes it all, possibly plotting her own moves down the line.Despite her growing experience, Kylie doesn’t claim to have parenting all figured out. In fact, on a separate episode of her Not Gonna Lie podcast, she shared a refreshingly honest admission. ""I am still Googling things 'cause that doesn't stop either,"" she said, as reported by E! Online. ""It's similar like when people say to me, 'Well you have four kids what's your advice?' No, I actually still have no idea what I'm doing. We're all winging it.""In a world that often pressures moms to present perfection, Kylie Kelce’s raw truth and relatable humor remind us that sometimes, survival is success—and sisterhood, even when chaotic, is a beautiful thing.Also read: Kyle Juszczyk’s movie night with wife Kristin turns nostalgic with ballet film ‘Center Stage’","Jason Kelce's wife, Kylie, has four daughters under the age of six.

Jalen Williams on the insane female attention the NBA players get

Jalen Williams keeps focus on basketball

The Oklahoma City Thunder have won their maiden NBA championship, a victory that brings with it not only name, fame, and money — but also an increase in female attention. With million-dollar contracts and stardom reaching new heights, NBA players often find themselves vulnerable to situations that can go far beyond admiration. Some women go to extreme lengths, with a few even using the opportunity to deceive or exploit them. Jalen Williams, now a member of an NBA title-winning team, once opened up about this aspect of fame, speaking candidly about how players can be susceptible to the wrong kind of attention — and the consequences that may follow.In a 2023 appearance on the Don’t Trip We Got You podcast, Jalen Williams — popularly known as J-Dub — was asked if he had personally experienced any of those “crazy” situations involving women seeking the attention of NBA stars.“Me personally, no. I try and stay out the mix as far as… like girls… during the season,"" Williams responded.He said, ""I've seen some stuff just in general. Like I know girls be hanging out in the hallways and hotel rooms all the time and kind of do that just to see who they can get to come upstairs. They know your schedule and stuff, and you always get the random DMs like ‘fly me out.’”When the host pointed out that such attempts sometimes work, Williams explained why many young players fall into the trap.“You guys definitely see it, but like, that's the trap that I think a lot of—especially younger—guys fall into. You got girls at 2 a.m., 3 a.m., you’re already tired, you’re vulnerable. Just played a back-to-back. You might have had a good game. Then they’ll be at your hotel room like, ‘Take me upstairs, let’s go out to eat,’ blah blah blah,” he said.Williams called it “insane,” suggesting that such encounters have, at times, ended in theft or blackmail involving compromising photos. “There’s been all kinds of stuff. People get their wallets stolen, or they’ll take a picture of you while you’re asleep. So you always gotta be careful in that regard,” he added.Despite his rising popularity, Jalen Williams has kept his personal life extremely private. There have been no public confirmations of a relationship, and if he is dating someone, he's kept it well under wraps.As a result, the spotlight has remained firmly on his performance. In Game 7 of the NBA Finals, Williams scored 20 points along with four assists and four rebounds, becoming the second-highest contributor for the Oklahoma City Thunder behind Finals MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. After the win, Alexander called Williams a “once-in-a-lifetime player” — and it seems he just might be right.","The Oklahoma City Thunder have won their maiden NBA championship.

Former India captain Mohammad Azharuddin has cautioned the team management against over-reliance on pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah and called for the inclusion of left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav in the second Test against England at Edgbaston.India went down by five wickets in the first Test at Headingley, despite centuries from Shubman Gill, Rishabh Pant , KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal. However, the team faltered with repeated collapses and a bowling unit heavily dependent on Bumrah to both take wickets and control the run rate.“They are too much dependent on Bumrah. It’s not easy because you need more experienced bowlers, and they should play Kuldeep Yadav,” Azharuddin told PTI Videos, suggesting that the wrist-spinner’s inclusion could offer more control and variety.India will face England in the second Test starting July 2 in Birmingham. With conditions likely to favour spin later in the match, Azhar said picking the right bowling combination will be key to bouncing back from the Leeds defeat.“We lost because of the batting collapse, but now they have to pick the right players. Bowling has to be perfect,” he noted.Azhar also defended new Test captain Shubman Gill, who is leading India for the first time in a five-match series. “This is just his first match as captain. You can’t talk about captaincy so early. He should be given a fair chance, support, and time,” Azhar said.The former skipper, who led India in 47 Tests, stressed that patience is crucial. “We cannot just complain and criticise players like that,” he added.",Mohammad Azharuddin warns India against over-reliance on Jasprit Bumrah.

India Add Spin Option Ahead of 2nd Test | All Eyes on Team Balance

June 29, 2024, will forever be remembered as the day India ended a 11-year wait for an ICC title, winning the T20 World Cup in a nerve-wracking final against South Africa in Barbados. Under Rohit Sharma ’s leadership, India clinched the crown with a narrow seven-run win, sealing a night of high drama and national celebration.One of the most-discussed moments from that epic final came during South Africa’s tense chase. With 30 runs needed off 30 balls, Rishabh Pant suddenly went down, signalling discomfort in his knee. Play stopped.At the time, it looked like a concerning injury, especially given Pant’s recovery from a life-threatening car accident in 2022.Now, a year later, Rohit Sharma has shared fresh insight into that moment, admitting he initially feared the worst.“See, Hardik has come to bowl there. So, we were discussing with Hardik what to do. I didn't know what had happened before. I genuinely thought that something had happened to him. The accident he had, I thought he was just trying to. But actually, it was just to stop the game a little bit. The momentum was with them.So, it was very important to break that. So, I think we went back to that. Eventually, Hardik dismissed Klaasen,” Rohit told Star Sports.Speaking earlier on The Great Indian Kapil Show, Rohit had revealed how Pant’s presence of mind helped India regroup: “When South Africa needed 30 runs off 30 balls, just before that, there was a small break. Pant used his intelligence to pause the game - he had a knee injury, so he had his knee taped, which helped slow down the game - because the game was fast-paced, and at that moment, all a batter wants is the ball to be bowled quickly.""But we had to break the rhythm. As I was setting the field and talking to bowlers, suddenly I saw Pant fallen on the ground. The physiotherapist had arrived and was taping his knee. Klassen was waiting for the match to start again. I am not saying it's the only reason, but it could be one of them - Pant Sahab used his smarts and things worked out in our favour.”India’s eventual win not only ended years of ICC heartbreak but also served as an emotional farewell for Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ravindra Jadeja, and coach Rahul Dravid. One year on, Pant’s “injury” remains one of the most iconic—and debated—turning points of that unforgettable night.","Rishabh Pant's injury in T20 World Cup final is one of the most-discussed moments.

Poll Which player do you think will have a bigger impact in the upcoming Test series? KL Rahul Rishabh Pant

Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar has called for KL Rahul to demonstrate more consistency in Test cricket , particularly as he steps into a senior role following the retirements of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. Meanwhile, Rishabh Pant has strengthened his position in India's batting lineup by becoming only the second wicketkeeper in cricket history to score twin centuries in a Test match, following Andy Flower's feat.Being one of the most experienced players in India's relatively young batting order, Rahul is now expected to provide stability and leadership while delivering consistent performances with the bat.Pant's achievement of scoring two centuries in the Leeds Test has particularly impressed Manjrekar, who praised the wicketkeeper-batsman's dedication to the longer format of the game.""I think he will because it seems like he enjoys batting in Test cricket. Any batter who gets two hundreds in a Test match, it takes a lot out of you mentally, not so much physically, getting a hundred in the first innings, and 48 hours later, you have the same kind of reserve to get another hundred. So that is a hallmark of an exceptional player,"" Manjrekar said on Star Sports.Manjrekar emphasized that KL Rahul needs to avoid being known for stop-start performances and must maintain consistency throughout the series.""I see Pant carrying his form, but there is another senior batter in the team, who now has got no choice but to carry his form right through the series. Indian cricket needs him badly, and KL Rahul cannot be a one-hundred wonder or a one-Test-match performer,"" Manjrekar added.The spotlight is now firmly on Rahul, with increased expectations as he assumes the role of the senior-most batter in India's Test lineup. Pant's recent performance has set a high standard, demonstrating his ability to deliver consistently in the red-ball format.As the team undergoes transition, it will be up to the more experienced stars to steer the ship clear of obstacles and help the younger stars manoeuvre this transitional phase.","Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar has called for KL Rahul to demonstrate more consistency in Test cricket.

LeBron James reveals the actual reason behind his future NBA exit

As Los Angeles Lakers’ iconic star LeBron James is gradually inching closer towards his 23rd NBA season, the speculations around his retirement have always diverted the attention of his fans and analysts. With LeBron James already in his 40th year, prominent NBA analysts and insiders believe that retirement is just around the corner.

Chirania mentioned in one of his viral posts—“It remains to be seen if James will reach season No. 24 or beyond. James went out to dinner in New York City this past week with his wife, Savannah; Miami Heat big man Kevin Love and his wife, Kate; and other confidants, and one of the dinner guests posted a snippet of the night to Instagram where James can be heard saying, ‘[Savannah] wants me to (expletive) retire in the next year or so.”The viral clip on Instagram dates back to LeBron James’ outing with his fellow teammate Kevin Love and his wife, Kate Love.However, neither the Los Angeles Lakers star nor his entrepreneur wife, Savannah, has spoken about his retirement on social media or any other public platform.Looking at LeBron James’ records, he would be breaking a draw with Vince Carter with respect to the maximum number of NBA seasons played. One of the best aspects of LeBron James’ NBA career revolves around sharing another season with his eldest son, Bronny, on the Los Angeles Lakers. With more than two decades in the NBA, James has achieved what A-list athletes could only dream of. From having a crazy fan following on almost every continent to becoming one of the most prominent faces with respect to brand endorsements, LeBron James has almost achieved everything, and now his wife, Savannah James, wants him to focus on retirement.Also Read: LeBron James reveals giving life important lessons to his sons Bronny and Bryce over group chat","LeBron James reveals the actual reason behind his future NBA exit in viral chat.

The Emotional Toll and Fan Reaction

The NBA world was stunned when the, their franchise cornerstone, to the Los Angeles Lakers in a late-night deal that many—including Doncic himself—considered both shocking and disrespectful. As details of the trade and its aftermath have emerged, it has become clear that the manner of Doncic’s exit and the subsequent public narrative have fueled his motivation this offseason like never before.“They have no idea… I worked my ass off to be here. So it’s kinda, I would say disrespectful, just sad that people say that,” Luka Doncic on criticism from the Mavericks’ front office. Luka Doncic’s departure from Dallas was not just a bold move—it was a historic event for the franchise and its fanbase. Despite five First-Team All-NBA selections in six seasons, a Western Conference Finals, and an NBA Finals appearance, Doncic was traded in a deal widely viewed as lacking in value and executed without his consent. The Mavericks’ front office, led by GM Nico Harrison, justified the move by questioning Doncic’s fit with the team’s culture, as well as his conditioning and work ethic.After the trade, a series of leaks and hit pieces emerged from the Mavericks’ organization, painting Doncic in a negative light.Reports suggested that his off-court habits and communication issues with the team’s medical staff were factors in the decision to move on from him. These narratives, particularly the public questioning of his work ethic, deeply stung Doncic. The Mavericks ’ handling of his exit and the subsequent criticism have become a driving force for Luka Doncic. According to ESPN’s Dave McMenamin, Doncic has committed to an intensive offseason training and nutrition program, determined to address every criticism leveled at him by his former team. People close to the Lakers have praised his focus and presence at optional workouts, noting that he has been a constant in the gym since the trade.Doncic himself has been vocal about how the Mavericks’ actions and words have motivated him:- Public Rebuke: Doncic has openly called the narrative about his work ethic “disrespectful,” emphasizing that his achievements were the result of relentless hard work, not luck or entitlement.- Personal Motivation: He has described the trade and the rumors as “a motive… for a long, long run here” with the Lakers, making it clear that he intends to prove his doubters wrong on the court.- Professional Approach: Rather than engage in a war of words, Doncic has let his performance speak for itself, delivering standout games against his former team and other top opponents.Doncic’s exit has left a lasting impact on Mavericks fans, many of whom are still reeling from the loss of a player who became the face of Dallas basketball. The organization’s attempts to erase his legacy—such as removing references to him—have only intensified the sense of disrespect and galvanized Doncic’s resolve to excel elsewhere.His first return to Dallas as a Laker was marked by high anticipation, with fans eager to show their appreciation and Doncic eager to make a statement against the team that let him go. The ongoing chants of “fire Nico” from Dallas fans reflect the widespread belief that the franchise mishandled the situation and underestimated Doncic’s value and commitment.As Doncic enters the offseason, his focus is sharper than ever. The disrespect he felt from the Mavericks has become a source of fuel, pushing him to new heights in his preparation and performance. With the Lakers, Doncic is determined to chase a championship and cement his legacy—not just as one of the league’s most talented players, but as one of its most resilient and motivated competitors.Also read: Dwyane Wade Applauds Celtics’ Bold Gamble as Anfernee Simons Trade Keeps Playoff Hopes Alive Amid Jayson Tatum’s Achilles Crisis The saga of Luka Doncic’s exit from Dallas and his response is a powerful reminder: for some athletes, disrespect is the ultimate motivator.

Mid-Air Deaths: Rare But Not Unprecedented







A routine international flight turned tragic on Thursday, June 26, when Mohsen bin Saeed Alzahrani, a cabin manager with Saudi Arabia’s national airline Saudia, died mid-flight following a sudden medical emergency. The incident occurred aboard Flight SV119, which had departed from Jeddah and was en route to London.The severity of the situation led the flight crew to divert the aircraft to Cairo International Airport, where Alzahrani was formally pronounced dead. The airline later confirmed that immediate medical attention was administered onboard by crew members and medically licensed individuals traveling on the flight, but efforts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful.In an official statement posted on X (formerly Twitter), Saudia confirmed the incident, stating:“Despite the immediate and valiant efforts of fellow crew members and medically licensed individuals onboard, he was pronounced deceased upon the aircraft's arrival at Cairo International Airport.”The airline described the loss as “a heartbreaking moment in which we lost one of our most dedicated team members.” Alzahrani was remembered with deep respect and admiration.Saudia praised him as “a shining example of commitment and discipline, admired by his peers for his integrity, professionalism, and high moral character.”The statement continued by offering condolences to Alzahrani’s family, colleagues, and friends and affirming the airline’s commitment to fully supporting them during this difficult time. Saudia is working closely with the Saudi Embassy in Egypt to complete the procedures for repatriating Alzahrani’s body back to the Kingdom.“Saudia remains fully committed to supporting his loved ones and all those affected by this profound loss,” the airline stated.In the wake of the tragedy, Saudia praised the remarkable courage and professionalism of the flight crew, who managed the situation with composure and continued the journey under exceptionally difficult circumstances. The airline also thanked passengers onboard for their understanding and cooperation during the ordeal.While rare, deaths during commercial flights do occur and often necessitate emergency landings. In October 2024, a Turkish Airlines pilot collapsed and died mid-flight, forcing the plane to make an emergency landing in New York. Similarly, in February 2023, a flydubai flight from Dubai to Dhaka had to divert to Karachi after a passenger passed away during the journey.These incidents serve as solemn reminders of the unpredictable nature of in-flight medical emergencies and the critical role played by cabin crew in responding under pressure.","Mohsen bin Saeed Alzahrani, a cabin manager with Saudi Arabia’s national airline Saudia, died mid-flight following a sudden medical emergency.

While one was growing up, one's mother often lamented that if one spent as much time poring over textbooks as one did perusing the collective works of Frederick Forsyth, one might have amounted to something worth writing about—instead of writing about worthless things. Tautologies masquerading as jokes aside, Britain, too, has long mastered the art of making its hypocrisy sound like high wit.TakeThere’s a hilarious episode where Jim Hacker and Sir Humphrey Appleby team up to pressurise adirector into pulling an embarrassing interview. Theman initially refuses—until Sir Humphrey gently reminds him that failure to cooperate might result in budget cuts and, more scandalously, the loss of seats at Wimbledon and Royal Ascot. They all then solemnly agree that while themustn’t appear to give in to government pressure, they won’t air the interview due to “security implications.”The brilliance of the scene lies in how comfortable the British—for all their lack of tastebuds—are with poking fun at the very institutions they hold dear. A taxpayer-funded broadcaster that can satirise both the government and itself without missing a beat.But—as brilliant as it is—is perhaps only thesecond greatest contribution to the literary arts.The top spot, without contest, belongs to a former Royal Air Force pilot with an eye for detail and a knack for turning geopolitical chaos into page-turning precision: Frederick Forsyth, who departed for Elysium on June 9.And here’s the kicker: Forsyth might never have become an author at all had it not been for the BBC.Fate—disguised as institutional cowardice—had to intervene so that he could stumble into his true dharma.The story goes that once his flying days were over, Forsyth joined, before moving on to the Beeb.However, disgusted by the BBC’s denial of genocide—a custom in which Albion has shown considerable promise—during the Biafra War, Forsyth quit and began covering the conflict as a freelancer.Freelancing, as every freelancer worth her salt will tell you, leads to penury.Broke, and living on a friend’s sofa he wrote the first manuscript of the book that came to be known asostensibly within only 35 days.was initially rejected because it dealt with a rather sticky subject – the attempted murder of a very much alive Charles De Gaulle – not to mention that the cold, journalistic style of writing, lack of a traditional Herculean hero, overt detailing, and a plot whose ending was preordained.The rest as they say is history.sold over 10 million copies, become the inspiration for two movies, and a race-swapped limited series, but to reduce Forsyth’s legacy tois like calling Bob Dylan merely the poet who wroteIt’s simply one arrow in a quiver full of masterpieces.Forsyth was a masterful storyteller, an author who brought a journalist’s eye-for-detail with a poet’s gift for storytelling without getting into the literary quagmire of a John Le Carre that could alienate those with more limited grasp of the King’s.In fact, today, it’s almost hard to explain to a generation that has grown up on C-Bag, Instagram reels or TikTok videos, the magic that Forsyth produced on his vintage Olympia typewriter (he used them till his death).His attention to detail was legendary and reading his novels wasn’t just a walk through a story but a tour through space-time, a history lesson more enthralling than anything in one’s textbook.Take one’s favouritewhere we move from The Battle of Britain to Vietnam to Milosevic’s Yugoslavia to an unnamed South American republic with dodgy leaders ending on the night of September 10, 2001 with a plot twist that would boggle your mind.In, we meet mercenaries with a plan that it’s almost a CliffNotes on how to carry out aon an African nation. The fact that some mercenaries actually thought they were going to carry out an actual coup bears testimony to its hyperrealism.In, we see the future of Labour politics and Leftism in Britain which will ally with any force inimical to the Western order.In, Forsyth astutely predicts the rise of a Putin-like figure whose expansionist ways will become a threat to Europe if not stopped in time. Unfortunately, Forsyth’s protagonists only exist in the pages of novels whose effete real world versions pale in comparison. Today, as the world grapples with Putin trying to increase his sphere of influence, the book reads like a prophecy.Forsyth’s protagonists are a breed apart—neither the brooding intellectualism of Le Carré’s George Smiley nor the martini-drenched bravado of Ian Fleming’s James Bond. They are men of method, mission, and moral ambiguity—shaped more by bureaucracy and battlefield scars than by tuxedos or existential crises. Take Calvin Dexter, the tunnel rat turned avenger, who channels quiet rage into legal vigilantism, or Cat Shannon, a professional mercenary with a conscience honed in Africa’s cruel geopolitics. Jason Monk, ex-CIA and emotionally flayed by betrayal, stands at the cusp of East-West collapse in Icon.Then there’s Mike Martin, the SAS ghost who reappears across Forsyth’s work—first infiltrating Iraq in, then the Taliban inPaul Devereaux, the cold, calculating CIA man in, is the closest Forsyth comes to a Bond figure—minus the glamour, doubled on ruthlessness.Even the teenage hacker Luke Jennings inis a far cry from traditional spy fiction—a vulnerable savant weaponised by Adrian Weston, a spymaster who knows the game is rigged. They’re professionals in a bureaucratic wilderness, soldiers of shadow wars and moral compromise—proof that in Forsyth’s world, heroism is about precision, not panache.And inForsyth’s memoir is a debrief confirming the many things we already know and a few we didn’t like the fact that he did covert work for MI6, had a dalliance with an East Bloc spy and was part of back-channel talks to de-nuclearise post-Apartheid South Africa.Forsyth’s memoir is not a celebrity confessional—it’s a debrief. He writes of his time as a fighter pilot, his disillusionment with journalism during Biafra, and his covert work for MI6. He describes his writing method with the same precision as his fictional operatives.You finish the book understanding that Frederick Forsyth didn’t write thrillers. He lived them. Then redacted just enough to publish. And in that, Forsyth was a journalist through and through. And maybe reading his books was far more entertaining, if not useful, than reading one’s textbooks.","Frederick Forsyth, a former Royal Air Force pilot with an eye for detail and a knack for turning geopolitical chaos into page-turning precision, died on June 9. Forsyth might never have become an author at all had it not been for the BBC. Britain, too, has long mastered the art of making its hypocrisy sound like high wit.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121753636,imgsize-100028,width-400,resizemode-4/121753636.jpg"

King Charles’ Cancer CONFIRMED As ‘Incurable’? Royal Health Secret Finally Revealed | Shocking Update

Prince Harry & Meghan Markle At Odds Over 'Divorce' Deal? Insider Drops Bombshell





King Charles is reportedly ""livid"" about potentially missing a cherished Christmas tradition this year.Recent reports from The Sun indicate a shortage of pheasants at Sandringham Estate, potentially affecting the winter shooting schedule. This activity is traditionally one of the monarch's preferred holiday pursuits.""King Charles III is livid, frustrated and disappointed, reflecting both his deep personal attachment to the cherished family tradition and his broader commitment to his royal heritage,"" British royal expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News Digital.""He's also annoyed that the mishap reflects rather poorly on the management of Sandringham, which he inherited from his mother, Queen Elizabeth II,"" she further said.""The shoot gathers his extended royal family and guests, reinforcing bonds while upholding a long-standing aristocratic tradition. The root of the problem is that Charles has always opposed importing birds from elsewhere, preferring to maintain the estate's game population. The eco-friendly approach has failed<"" she added.The reduced bird population might force the 76-year-old monarch, currently receiving cancer treatment, to cancel the traditional Boxing Day shoot, a significant component of royal holiday celebrations.British photographer Helena Chard told Fox News Digital, ""Allegedly, King Charles is disappointed that one of his favorite Christmas family traditions may not take place this year. The Sandringham shoot is questionable due to a lack of Sandringham pheasants on the estate. It seems the family will have to bond, enjoy and celebrate over another hobby, or possibly clay pigeon shoots are the way forward.""""King Charles may have felt a fleeting healthy upset, but in light of recent times, with the slimmed-down monarchy, cancer battles and more... the monarchy has found their typical ways changing as they are forced to be flexible,"" she added.A veteran gamekeeper, tasked with overseeing the bird population at the estate, was reportedly dismissed during recent personnel changes, leading to a deficit, as indicated by The Sun. A source informed the publication, ""It was a total cock-up. No birds, no bang, just red faces. The king wasn't having it.""Per Chard's account, despite the king's disappointment, he remains open to adjustments. The sovereign is currently adapting to a new schedule whilst undergoing weekly cancer treatments, all whilst maintaining his commitment to full-time royal responsibilities.The expert highlighted that the scarcity could lead the king to reassess the hunting custom, which has received criticism from organisations advocating for animal welfare.Meanwhile, royal commentator Ian Pelham Turner believes the altered arrangements might enable the king to focus on reconciliation with his younger son, Prince Harry . The Duke of Sussex and his wife Meghan Markle withdrew from their senior royal duties in 2020, stating they faced intolerable media scrutiny from British newspapers and insufficient backing from the palace. They now live in California.Following their departure from royal duties, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have voiced their concerns through various media appearances and Harry's revealing 2023 book, ""Spare."" Insiders familiar with the prince, 40, have informed People magazine about the king's apparent reluctance to engage in communication via telephone or written correspondence.""Perhaps he could bring the royal clan together, lock the door, knock all their heads together and unite the entire family, including Harry and Meghan,"" Turner told Fox News Digital. ""This may be feathers flying in a different way than a grouse shoot, but if they really believe in the Christian principles, they would try, in my view. It is what Britain expects.""According to People magazine, Charles advocates for conventional methods and stands against bringing birds from other regions for this rural custom. The publication noted that sustaining the population of game birds in the region has proven to be ""challenging.""","King Charles is reportedly ""livid"" about potentially missing a cherished Christmas tradition this year.
