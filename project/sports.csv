“A drug dealer”: Stefon Diggs accused of handing out ‘pink cocaine’ on boat party with women as NFL stays silent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/a-drug-dealer-stefon-diggs-accused-of-handing-out-pink-cocaine-on-boat-party-with-women-as-nfl-stays-silent/articleshow/121491353.cms,"Stefon Diggs faces scrutiny after a video surfaced (Image via AP)

Stefon Diggs under fire as viral boat video ignites drug-related rumors

Coach Mike Vrabel and the Patriots respond with discretion





New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs is back in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. A recently surfaced video shows the star NFL player on a boat with a group of women, allegedly handing them a bag filled with pink crystals. The footage, which quickly spread across social media, has fueled intense speculation over the nature of the substance — with many users suspecting it to be “pink cocaine,” though there is no confirmation of that claim.In the viral video, Stefon Diggs is seen chatting casually with three women who reportedly referred to him as “Daddy” before he passed around the bag of pink material. “Yikes: NFL fans are speculating that Stefon Diggs handed these three girls what looks to be pink c*caine after he asked them to call him Daddy,” one user wrote on X (formerly Twitter). Others followed suit with similar reactions, suggesting Diggs was “serving pink cocaine” and even labeling him “a football player, pimp and a drug dealer. ”Despite the wave of viral commentary, there is currently no official evidence confirming that the substance was illicit. Still, the video has created a media storm, putting both Diggs and the Patriots in a difficult position during the offseason.When asked about the situation, Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel addressed the controversy during a media session ahead of an optional team practice, which Diggs did not attend.“It’s something that we’re aware of. Obviously, we want to make great decisions on and off the field,” Vrabel said. He added that his discussions with Diggs “will remain between him I and the club.”The NFL has chosen not to comment on the situation at this time, with a league spokesperson telling the Associated Press there would be no statement regarding the video.Also Read: T.J.

Cardi B, who filed for divorce from rapper Offset last year, was reportedly also on the boat during the controversial outing.As the video continues to circulate online, all eyes are on the NFL and Stefon Diggs’ camp for an official response.","New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs is back in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons.

Punjab Kings and Mumbai Indians are set to face off in IPL 2025 Qualifier 2 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Sunday, with PBKS aiming for their first final appearance since 2014 and Mumbai Indians pursuing their sixth title. The match was relocated to Ahmedabad due to military tensions between India and Pakistan, which led to tournament schedule revisions and changes in playoff venues.The playoff stages began with Qualifier 1 between PBKS and Royal Challengers Bengaluru, followed by Eliminator 1 between Gujarat Titans and MI in Mullanpur. The remaining matches, including Qualifier 2 and the final, were subsequently moved to Ahmedabad.Saturday witnessed brief spells of rain, impacting Punjab Kings' training session, but the evening of the IPL Qualifier 2 looks clear. As per Accuweather, any chances of rain have cleared up.It is expected to be 36 degrees Celsius at 7pm, the time of toss, and slated to get cooler as the match progresses. Most importantly, the odds of rain don't pick up throughout.In case of a complete washout, the team with the higher position in the points table will advance to the next round.This would favour the Shreyas Iyer-led Punjab Kings, who topped the league stage with 19 points and maintained a superior net run-rate compared to the Mumbai Indians, who finished fourth.The BCCI and IPL Governing Council have implemented additional time provisions to address potential rain interruptions. The playing conditions now include an extra hour to complete the match if weather disruptions occur.""Similar to the playoffs stage, an additional one hour will be allocated to the playing conditions for the remaining matches of the league stage, starting Tuesday, 20 May,"" states the BCCI announcement earlier in the season.The IPL Playing Conditions, specifically Clause 13.7.3 regarding extra time, provides detailed guidelines: ""Where the start of play is delayed or play is suspended for any reason then extra time of… up to one hundred and twenty minutes for any of the play-off matches (shall be available).""The playing conditions further elaborate: ""For the avoidance of doubt, if extra time is required to be used, it will be taken in the following sequence. In the event of a delayed start or interruption, the provision of… one hundred and twenty minutes for play-off matches extra time is to be used first, followed by the time allocated for time-outs and then the reduction in the innings change interval (if applicable).""Additional clarification is provided regarding Super Over scenarios: ""For clarity, the changeover period (maximum 10 mins) for a Super Over after the main match is not to be taken into account when applying any permitted extra time available.""The match arrangements currently do not include a reserve day provision for the second qualifier.

Mumbai Indians (MI) head into the IPL 2025 Qualifier 2 with a historical edge and recent momentum on their side, as they prepare to face a shaken Punjab Kings (PBKS) on Sunday in Ahmedabad.MI, under Hardik Pandya's leadership, are eyeing a sixth title after a 20-run win over Gujarat Titans in the Eliminator. In contrast, Shreyas Iyer-led PBKS enter the do-or-die clash low on confidence, following a heavy defeat to Royal Challengers Bengaluru in Qualifier 1.MI’s depth and experience in knockout games, coupled with standout performances from Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah and Suryakumar Yadav, give them a clear advantage. The form of Jonny Bairstow and Richard Gleeson has also strengthened their case. Bumrah’s tactical deployment has been key, offering MI control even on batting-friendly tracks.PBKS, meanwhile, must regroup quickly. Their bowling attack — missing Marco Jansen and Yuzvendra Chahal — looked vulnerable in their previous match. Arshdeep Singh is under pressure to lead an inexperienced unit. The explosive opening pair of Prabhsimran Singh and Priyansh Arya needs to fire, while the team draws belief from a win over MI earlier this season.The outcome may hinge on which bowling unit adapts better to Ahmedabad’s high-scoring conditions.Total matches played: 33Punjab Kings: 16Mumbai Indians: 17The pitch at Ahmedabad is expected to offer ideal conditions for batting, especially as the match progresses. The surface has a consistent grass covering and a hint of early moisture, but the intense heat is likely to dry it out quickly, making it a true wicket with good bounce and carry. The ball should come on nicely to the bat, favouring stroke play throughout the innings. The square boundaries measure 61 and 67 metres, while the straight boundary stretches to 73 metres, offering some help to the bowlers who can vary their lengths smartly.Priyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh, Josh Inglis(w), Shreyas Iyer(c), Nehal Wadhera, Shashank Singh, Marcus Stoinis, Azmatullah Omarzai, Harpreet Brar, Arshdeep Singh, Kyle JamiesonImpact Sub: Suryansh ShedgeJonny Bairstow (w), Rohit Sharma, Corbin Bosch, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya (c), Naman Dhir, Mitchell Santner, Deepak Chahar, Trent Boult, Jasprit BumrahImpact Sub: Karn SharmaSunday’s IPL 2025 Qualifier 2 in Ahmedabad is expected to enjoy clear weather conditions.

Auston Matthews and his fans got emotional as his mother opened up about the financial struggles of getting him into hockey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/auston-matthews-and-his-fans-got-emotional-as-his-mother-opened-up-about-the-financial-struggles-of-getting-him-into-hockey/articleshow/121166477.cms,"Image credit - Paige Taylor White/CP

Auston Matthews’ hockey dream wasn’t cheap and his mom took the weight

“I used to work in the morning for Starbucks, in the afternoon the restaurant, i was very fortunate to have two jobs. And believe me, if they would have more hours, I would have more jobs.""





Before Auston Matthews was an NHL superstar, his biggest supporter was clocking into two jobs, trying to make ends meet. His mom, Ema Matthews, didn’t just believe in his dream, she bankrolled it, penny by penny, from behind a Starbucks counter. For families without deep pockets, hockey can be financially brutal. But Ema’s resilience turned obstacles into opportunity and her son into one of the league’s brightest stars. Her story is the heartwarming reminder that every great athlete often has a real-life superhero cheering from the sidelines, sacrificing, hustling, and holding it all together so their child can chase the impossible.Ice time, gear, coaching, travel, youth hockey isn’t just a sport, it’s a financial beast. For the Matthews family, especially with Ema being originally from Hermosillo, Mexico, the culture and cost of the sport were both daunting. But she took on the challenge without hesitation, picking up multiple jobs including a gig at Starbucks to ensure Auston never missed a chance to grow on the ice. She juggled long hours, late nights, and early mornings, often sacrificing her own comfort and time just to make sure Auston’s hockey dreams stayed alive and on track.Ema shared in a past interview that the cost of hockey often reached up to $20,000 a year, a heavy ask for any middle-class family. To make it work, she didn’t just cut corners, she picked up shifts and poured lattes while helping Auston stay focused on the sport. She even deposited small amounts of money in his account so he could grab food with teammates like a regular teen. Beyond that, Ema often drove long hours to tournaments, handled equipment costs, and juggled bills, all to ensure Auston had every chance to chase his dreams without added stress.Ema’s story also breaks stereotypes. In a sport dominated by players from Canada and northern U.S. states, Auston’s rise as a player of Mexican heritage makes his success even more impactful. It's not just about talent, it’s about trailblazing, especially for kids of color or immigrant families who rarely see themselves represented in hockey.Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the NHL. He’s not just known for his goal-scoring skills but also for his poise and work ethic, traits his mom likely helped instill. While fans celebrate his success on the ice, stories like Ema’s remind us of the sacrifices behind the scenes that made it possible, from long car rides to practices, emotional support during tough losses, and the quiet strength that helped shape his journey to stardom.Ema Matthews’ story shows what’s possible when love, grit, and hustle lead the way, proving that behind every great athlete stands a family whose unwavering support shapes both their character and their incredible achievements. Her journey highlights the sacrifices, encouragement, and strength that fuel success, reminding us that triumphs on the ice are built far beyond the rink, in the hearts and homes of those who believe the most.Also read - “From baptism to strip club”: Pete Blackburn’s unhinged NHL comparison is going viral and fans totally get it","Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the NHL.

Juan Soto silences critics with clutch performance as he ends HR drought and proves David Stearns' belief right,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/juan-soto-silences-critics-with-clutch-performance-as-he-ends-hr-drought-and-proves-david-stearns-belief-right/articleshow/121544737.cms,"After 17 homerless games, Juan Soto’s bat explodes just when the Mets needed it most (AP Photos)

Juan Soto breaks slump in style, ends homer drought and delivers big for Mets in crucial win







Juan Soto reminded baseball fans why he commands one of the most lucrative contracts in the sport with a thunderous 404-foot home run that snapped a 17-game drought. The blast, launched in the fourth inning of the Mets’ 8-2 win over the Colorado Rockies on Saturday, was more than just a number on the box score—it was a statement.After weeks of quiet at the plate, Soto's swing roared back to life with a 109.5 mph shot to left-center, despite facing a 14 mph wind pushing out to right field. “He put a really good swing on it,” Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. “For him to hit it out of the ballpark like that on a day that the conditions are not in his favor, that’s pretty impressive.”Soto himself couldn’t hide his confidence. Grinning when asked if he thought the ball had enough to clear the fence, he responded, “I mean, 110 (mph), you’ve got to be. I knew it was gone.”The home run was his first since May 9, and although it marked the fourth-longest homerless stretch of his eight-year career, the fans at Citi Field never wavered. When Soto completed his home run trot, he raised his hands to acknowledge the roaring crowd. Just moments later, chants of “JUAN SO-TO” echoed from the right-field seats, to which he turned and raised his arms in appreciation. “It’s a great feeling when you feel the support like that,” he said.The moment became even sweeter when it followed Brandon Nimmo’s two-run homer, making it a back-to-back blast for the Mets. “Francisco (Lindor) and I were doing our picture down there,” Nimmo said of the team’s dugout celebration. “Heard the sound of the bat and the crowd going wild. We looked out and were able to see him go the other way. That’s when he’s the best.”While Soto’s $765 million, 15-year deal sets sky-high expectations, it also invites relentless scrutiny. Any slump feels seismic. But baseball is a game of streaks, and Mets president David Stearns offered a dose of reason during Soto’s recent struggles. “I think he's having good at-bats. He controls the strike zone pretty well. He's hitting the ball on the ground a little bit more than before and it's something he's aware of. ”The calendar turning to June and Soto’s power reawakening could signal a pivotal shift—not just for him, but for the Mets’ momentum going forward.Also Read: “I don’t know what to do”: Olivia Dunne breaks down over terrifying stalker encounter at airport","Juan Soto broke his 17-game homer drought with a 404-foot blast on Saturday.

India Test squad vs England: Ajit Agarkar full press conference





NEW DELHI: India’s batting mainstays Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, along with ace spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, have retired from Test cricket, while star pacer Mohammed Shami will miss the crucial five-match series in England due to fitness issues.All eyes are now on the Shubman Gill-led Indian side, widely regarded as one of the most inexperienced teams to tour England in recent memory.In the absence of Kohli and Rohit, India's batting line-up appears quite thin in experience. So, could the selectors consider recalling experienced campaigners like Cheteshwar Pujara or Ajinkya Rahane , who are yet to retire from the traditional format, to strengthen the top order?During a recent interview, Pujara was asked whether Gautam Gambhir had reached out to him regarding the England tour.""No, not yet,"" Pujara told Lallantop when asked, ""Have you received a phone call from Gambhir yet?""Also See: MI vs GT IPL Live Score The 103-Test veteran expressed his readiness to return if given the opportunity.""I am ready. I don't know if they will take me or not. But if I get a chance, yes, it will be an honour to represent the country again. As a cricketer, you always feel that as long as you are fit, as long as you are contributing, and if I have a good performance in domestic cricket, and I am preparing well, if I get a chance, yes, I will be more than happy to be part of the team,"" Pujara said. Shubman Gill has been handed the responsibility of leading the Indian Test team through a “massive transition” period, with the dynamic Rishabh Pant appointed as his deputy for what is expected to be a stern challenge in English conditions.At just 25, Gill becomes India’s fifth youngest Test captain, following in the footsteps of Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi (21), Sachin Tendulkar (23), Kapil Dev (24), and Ravi Shastri (25). The first Test against England is scheduled to begin on June 20 in Leeds.""Last year or so we have looked at Shubman (for leadership). We are hopeful he is the guy who is going (to take the team forward). It is a high pressure job but he is a terrific player. We wish him all the best,"" said chief selector Ajit Agarkar after announcing the 18-member squad, which included no major surprises.Explaining Pant’s appointment as vice-captain, Agarkar added: ""Pant is one of our best batters in Test cricket over the last four-five years. A wicketkeeper can see the game well and that's why he is Shubman's deputy.""The squad also features maiden Test call-ups for promising left-hander B Sai Sudharsan and left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh.","Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Ravichandran Ashwin have retired from Test cricket.

Paris Saint-Germain won their first-ever Champions League title with a historic 5-0 victory over Inter Milan in Munich on Saturday. Teenager Desire Doue scored twice, while Achraf Hakimi, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, and substitute Senny Mayulu added goals in what became the most one-sided final in the tournament's 70-year history.The French champions dominated from the start, with Doue setting up Hakimi for the opening goal in the 12th minute. Doue then scored his first goal in the 20th minute through a deflected shot.The teenager added his second goal after the hour mark, effectively sealing the victory before Kvaratskhelia and young substitute Mayulu completed the rout.""This means everything. It's our dream. It's incredible. The result is not by magic. I'm happy we did it like this,"" said PSG midfielder Vitinha.The victory marks a significant milestone for PSG, coming after more than a decade of investment from their Qatari owners and five years after their only previous final appearance, where they lost to Bayern Munich.PSG completed a domestic treble with this victory, becoming only the second French club to win Europe's premier competition after Marseille's triumph in 1993.For manager Luis Enrique, it represents his second Champions League title, following his 2015 success with Barcelona.""It was the objective since the start of last season to make history. I have felt a really strong connection with the players and the supporters,"" Luis Enrique told Canal Plus.This PSG team, rebuilt over the past two years following Kylian Mbappe's departure, has emerged as one of the competition's most impressive sides.Inter Milan, seeking their first Champions League title since 2010, failed to match PSG's intensity throughout the match. The defeat means they end the season without any trophies, having also missed out on the Serie A title to Napoli.""PSG absolutely deserved to win this match. We are very disappointed,"" said Inter coach Simone Inzaghi.""As a coach I am proud of our campaign, but we're not satisfied with tonight's game. PSG outplayed us. I thanked the players for what they did this season. We won no silverware, but I'm proud.""The match at the Allianz Arena saw PSG take control early, with Vitinha's pass finding Doue, who assisted Hakimi for the opener. Hakimi chose not to celebrate against his former club.The second goal came from a counter-attack, with Willian Pacho's clearance leading to a sequence involving Kvaratskhelia, Ousmane Dembele, and Doue, whose shot deflected off Federico Dimarco.Inter's only notable chance came when Marcus Thuram headed wide from a corner in the first half.The second half saw PSG extend their lead further. Dembele and Vitinha combined to set up Doue for his second goal past goalkeeper Yann Sommer.Kvaratskhelia added the fourth goal in the 73rd minute after being released by Dembele.Nineteen-year-old Mayulu completed the scoring in the 86th minute, exchanging passes with Bradley Barcola before finding the net.The five-goal victory marked the first time a team had scored that many in a European Cup final since Benfica in 1962, cementing PSG's place in football history.","Paris Saint-Germain beat Inter Milan 5-0 in the Champions League final in Munich.

A high-stakes IPL 2025 Eliminator between Mumbai Indians and Gujarat Titans took an intense turn on Friday, not just for the cricket but for a fiery mid-pitch exchange between Jasprit Bumrah and Rahul Tewatia . While Mumbai sealed a thrilling 20-run win to book a spot in Qualifier 2 against Punjab Kings, the moment between the two Indian players became a talking point.The flashpoint came in the 18th over of Gujarat's tense run chase. Tewatia launched Bumrah for a massive six over deep mid-wicket, sending a jolt through MI’s camp. But the very next delivery saw a swing and a miss, followed by another failed attempt where Tewatia only managed a leg bye. As he rushed to the non-striker's end, he muttered something under his breath — words that seemingly irked Bumrah.The usually composed MI spearhead was caught on stump mic, saying, “Mereko mat bol (Don't say it to me),” making it clear he took the remark personally. Tewatia, caught off guard, quickly clarified: “Main tereko nahi bol raha hoon, main khud ko bol raha (I wasn’t talking to you, I was saying it to myself).”Thankfully, the moment didn’t spiral further. Bumrah returned to his mark without escalating the issue, and Tewatia too kept his focus on the game.

Punjab Kings (PBKS) battled through three bouts of drizzling on Saturday ahead of IPL 2025 Qualifier 2 against Mumbai Indians (MI) at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.There were three mild showers during PBKS' three-hour training session in Ahmedabad. Ahead of the big match, PBKS may get their most experienced player, Yuzvendra Chahal , back in action. The 34-year-old, who missed PBKS' last three matches due to a wrist injury, would be desperate to play on Sunday.Chahal's right wrist was protected, but the veteran spinner did train. He played football, took catches, and bowled a few balls in the empty net. It is yet to be seen how much his wrist has recovered, but TimesofIndia.com has learned that he is ready to take injections, if needed, to get back into the playing XI.Chahal, a wily customer, will be needed by Shreyas Iyer against the five-time champions MI, who never slip up in the playoffs.Meanwhile, MI have had their own share of injury issues. Deepak Chahar, who didn't play the Eliminator due to a hamstring strain in his left leg, was at the venue for his fitness test.The MI team had reached Ahmedabad at AM on a chartered flight, but their coaching staff and medical team were at the stadium, conducting Chahar's fitness test. The other MI bowler who made it to the stadium was left-arm quick Reece Topley.Chahar looked fine, but if he is not match-fit, then Topley might play his first match for MI.While there have been some light pre-monsoon showers in Ahmedabad in the days leading up to the match, the forecast for Sunday, June 1, suggests a low chance of rain during match hours.The covers from the pitch at the Narendra Modi Stadium came off for barely five minutes, with MI coaching staff, including head coach Mahela Jayawardene, taking a quick look. This is the same pitch on which Gujarat Titans defended 217 against Rajasthan Royals, and Chennai Super Kings defended 230 against the home team. One can expect a run-fest in Qualifier 2. Of the 14 innings played in Ahmedabad, teams have crossed the 200-run mark on nine instances.Rohit Sharma, Jonny Bairstow (wk), Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya (c), Naman Dhir, Mitchell Santner, Deepak Chahar, Reece Topley, Jasprit Bumrah, Trent BoultAshwani KumarPrabhsimran Singh, Priyansh Arya, Josh Inglis (wk), Shreyas Iyer (c), Nehal Wadhera, Shashank Singh, Marcus Stoinis, Azmatullah Omarzai, Harpreet Brar, Kyle Jamieson, Yuzvendra ChahalVyshak Vijaykumar","Yuzvendra Chahal is likely to return for Punjab Kings in the IPL 2025 Qualifier 2 against Mumbai Indians.

The real reason behind Jalen Ramsey trade deadlock







The Miami Dolphins and Jalen Ramsey saga is quickly turning into one of the most talked-about stories in the NFL. Once a key player in Miami’s defense, Ramsey now faces a turning point. His relationship with the team has become strained, and his big contract is making a trade complicated. But is Miami holding back only because of the money, or is there more to this situation that fans and experts haven’t figured out yet?Jalen Ramsey’s time in Miami is undeniably strained. Rumors swirl that his locker room relationships have soured, and the Dolphins appear ready to move on. Yet, the real obstacle isn’t just about player dynamics, it’s about the massive financial burden Ramsey’s contract places on Miami’s salary cap. The Dolphins are clear: they want to trade Ramsey but refuse to shoulder much of his guaranteed money, creating a complicated dance with potential suitors.ESPN insider Jeremy Fowler shed light on the hold-up, emphasizing that while interest in Ramsey is high, teams are wary of taking on the full financial weight of his deal. This isn’t just a minor negotiation; it’s a power play over millions in guaranteed cash. Miami’s strategy is to wait until after June 1, a date when the NFL’s salary cap rules allow them to free up significant cap space by moving Ramsey.This waiting game has frustrated many, as it delays the inevitable.A dam Schefter’s reports underline this growing impatience, noting that a trade announcement could come as soon as June but won’t be processed until the post-June 1 window opens. Meanwhile, Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel keeps a tight lip on the matter, focusing publicly on the current roster and refusing to elaborate on Ramsey’s uncertain future.Amid all this, Ramsey himself took to social media, trying to defuse fan backlash and clarify his mindset. His message was a rare glimpse into his perspective, he hasn’t lost respect for the cities and fans he’s played for, but he’s clearly ready to turn the page.Also Read: Pittsburgh Steelers risk 2025 season by choosing rookie Will Howard over Aaron Rodgers Whatever happens next, Jalen Ramsey’s Miami chapter is closing amid controversy and financial chess, setting the stage for a high-stakes move that could redefine both the player’s career and the Dolphins’ future defense.

A dramatic hit-wicket dismissal to Kusal Mendis stole the spotlight in Mullanpur as Mumbai Indians edged Gujarat Titans by 20 runs in a record-breaking IPL 2025 Eliminator that saw a staggering 436 runs scored—the most in any IPL playoff.Chasing MI’s daunting 228/5, GT’s early hopes were pinned on Mendis and Sai Sudharsan after Shubman Gill fell cheaply. The Sri Lankan looked in rhythm, hammering two sixes and a four in a brief 10-ball stay. But just as the 64-run stand with Sudharsan was blossoming, chaos struck.Facing Mitchell Santner , Mendis lost his balance attempting a forceful stroke and accidentally trod onto his stumps, getting out hit wicket for 20. The moment was surreal—GT were 67/2 in 6.2 overs and cruising—until that lapse shifted the game’s tone.Sai Sudharsan continued valiantly with his sixth fifty of the season, while Washington Sundar’s 48 kept GT in touch. But with wickets falling at regular intervals, and Sudharsan bowled in the 16th over, GT’s chase slowly unravelled.MI’s bowlers held their nerve in the death overs despite heavy dew.

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Gujarat Titans skipper Shubman Gill has put an end to swirling rumours of a rift with Mumbai Indians captain Hardik Pandya following a viral video from the IPL 2025 Eliminator.On the evening of May 31, Gill took to Instagram to share photos of himself smiling with Pandya, accompanied by a clear message: “Nothing but love.

Gill’s post served as a public clarification that there is mutual respect between the two players and that the perceived tension may have been exaggerated online.The controversy began after a video clip from the toss went viral on social media. In the footage, Hardik Pandya extended his hand for a shake, but Gill appeared to walk past without acknowledging it. The clip immediately drew attention, with many interpreting it as a deliberate snub.Adding to the drama, when Gill was dismissed early in the match for just 1 run, Pandya was seen celebrating animatedly, further fuelling the narrative.However, Gill’s calm and composed response on social media has seemingly ended the speculation.","Gujarat Titans skipper Shubman Gill has put an end to swirling rumours of a rift with Mumbai Indians captain Hardik Pandya following a viral video.

2025 highlights: Familiar faces and dramatic falls



Is it just madness or tradition





Every year on a steep hill in Gloucestershire, England, hundreds gather to chase a rolling 7-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down a dangerously steep slope. Known as the Cooper’s Hill Cheese Rolling Contest, the event is chaotic, absurd, and completely thrilling. With participants tumbling, somersaulting, and crashing their way to the bottom, the headline “People sprint to catch a 7-pound wheel of cheese” is technically accurate, but it doesn’t quite capture the madness, tradition, and injuries that define this bizarre British spectacle. So, is it a good headline? That depends on what you’re hoping to convey.The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. Dating back at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize. It sounds simple, but the event is notorious for its steep incline, dangerous tumbles, and frequent injuries.The hill is so steep that it's nearly impossible to stay upright. Most participants end up tumbling head over heels, colliding with each other or the ground.Gravity takes over quickly, and the cheese, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, is almost never actually caught. Still, competitors willingly risk sprains, fractures, and concussions for a shot at glory and a round of cheese.This year, German YouTuber Tom Kopke claimed victory for the second year in a row. Shirtless and triumphant, he declared, “I risked my life for this. It’s my cheese. Back to back.” On the women’s side, Ava Sender Logan from London tumbled repeatedly but emerged victorious, saying, “It felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head. I’m fine.” Around them, spectators packed the woods and fences for a glimpse of the chaos.While the event may seem absurd to outsiders, for locals and returning participants, it’s a point of pride and cultural identity. Despite calls to regulate or cancel it over safety concerns, the contest continues to thrive, drawing international competitors and media attention. Volunteers, medics, and long-time residents treat it as an important local tradition","The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians held their nerve better in a pressure-cooker Eliminator to outclass Gujarat Titans by 20 runs in a high-scoring IPL 2025 clash on Friday. Rohit Sharma (81 off 50) capitalised on early chances to play a pivotal knock, while Jonny Bairstow (47 off 22) made an instant impact on debut, powering MI to a commanding 228 for five in their 20 overs.After sealing a place in Qualifier 2, Player of the Match Rohit Sharma expressed pride in his side's all-round effort.""I have got only four fifties. Would have loved to score more fifties. Good day for us as a team. I do understand the importance of playing this Eliminator and going through this and taking the next step forward. Really proud of a complete team effort,"" Rohit said at the post-match presentation.""When I play the game, I try to do my best keeping everything aside. Making sure how I can do the job for the team. I had to make the most of the luck. I am glad I could do that. Get the team into a good position. It was going to be challenging with the dew coming. The bowlers held their nerves really well. To be honest, I have played those shots before in the tournament and found fielders.""Somewhere down the line you got to be lucky and today was that day for me. I got lucky as those catches were dropped.But even after that you got to play. I was focussing on keeping the momentum and tempo going. Was a good bowling effort. Jonny I have watched him over the years from the other side. We know the quality he has. Lot of experience playing in this format. Never looked like he was playing the first game. We got the start and capitalized on it,"" Rohit said.Mumbai Indians will now face Punjab Kings in Qualifier 2 in Ahmedabad on Sunday. The winner will meet Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL 2025 final on June 3.Gujarat Titans, despite being erratic in the field and with the ball, managed to stay in the hunt thanks to a masterful knock from Sai Sudharsan (80 off 49), but eventually fell short at 208 for six, bowing out of the tournament.Ultimately, it was Mumbai who won the crucial moments to stay alive in the playoffs. Despite the heavy dew, chasing down such a mammoth total in a knockout match demanded something extraordinary — and Sudharsan nearly delivered just that before his dismissal in the 16th over tilted the contest.Bumrah’s trademark yorker accounted for Washington Sundar (48 off 24), and Richard Gleeson struck the decisive blow by dismantling Sudharsan’s stumps when the left-hander missed a scoop, turning the tide in MI’s favour.While he was at the crease, Sudharsan’s strokeplay was a sight to behold. In a match dominated by brute power, the elegant left-hander stood out, threading gaps with surgical precision and timing.With the equation down to 36 off 12 balls, and left-handers Rahul Tewatia and Sherfane Rutherford at the crease, MI debutant Gleeson was handed the final over with 24 runs needed. He held his nerve to deliver three clinical deliveries, effectively sealing the win before walking off with an apparent hamstring issue.",Mumbai Indians beat Gujarat Titans by 20 runs in IPL 2025 Eliminator.

It was a night that saw Mumbai Indians flex their championship mettle once again. In a record-breaking IPL Eliminator in Mullanpur — where both teams combined for a staggering 436 runs, the highest ever in playoff history — MI held their nerve to beat Gujarat Titans by 20 runs and march into Qualifier 2.While the scoreboard lit up with sixes and boundaries, it was Mumbai’s ability to win the clutch moments that stood out. Skipper Hardik Pandya , facing his former franchise in a high-pressure knockout, was full of praise for his team’s temperament and timing.“At one point of time the game was even-stevens,” Pandya said after the win. “I thought the wicket got better in the second innings. It started to come on well, they got into rhythm and we realised we need to hold our nerves and back our boys.”He singled out Jonny Bairstow’s explosive debut knock and Rohit Sharma ’s composed 81 as pivotal. “The way Jonny batted and started... for him to make his debut for us, it's a special franchise, coming in and playing the way he played. The way Ro batted — he took his time and once he got into rhythm, it was beautiful.”Pandya also praised his bowling unit, particularly Richard Gleeson’s final over under injury duress and Jasprit Bumrah ’s clinical spell.“The way Gleeson bowled. Jassi being Jassi. Ashwani... everyone chipped in well and we held our nerves. I would've liked couple more (big hits). The little margins help. We wanted to push in batting and I think we were able to do that.”Asked when he decides to bowl Bumrah, Pandya smiled: “It's very simple. Whenever you think the game is going away, just bring him. When you have that it's a luxury. It's like Mumbai housing prices – he's that expensive.”The final overs were tense, but Pandya had it planned. “I was just watching the scoreboard and I thought if we can keep extra runs at the end, I had the bowlers to bowl it. It was important that Jassi comes and bowls that over so that the margin becomes longer (the 18th over). Very important to recover well. Looking forward to the next game.”With this victory, Mumbai Indians set up a Qualifier 2 clash against Punjab Kings in Ahmedabad on June 1.

Sabalenka shrugs off the pressure

Musetti, Rune battle through





Carlos Alcaraz survived a scare to book his place in the French Open last 16 on Friday, with defending women's champion Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka also through to the fourth round at Roland Garros.Second seed Alcaraz won 6-1, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 against 69th-ranked Bosnian Damir Dzumhur in the night session to keep his title defence on course.Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz arrived as the favourite at Roland Garros after securing the Monte Carlo Masters and Italian Open trophies in the build-up to the clay-court major.But his fluctuating performances in the past two rounds have given his rivals reason to believe he is vulnerable.""Today I honestly didn't enjoy it that much. I suffered quite a lot,"" said a relieved Alcaraz, who came from a break down in the fourth set to seal victory.""That's why doing a really good result in a Grand Slam is really difficult because you have to maintain a really high level for three to four hours.""The 22-year-old next meets American 13th seed Ben Shelton who eased past Italian qualifier Matteo Gigante 6-3, 6-3, 6-4.Swiatek kept her bid for a fourth consecutive French Open title on track, coming through 6-2, 7-5 against Romania's world number 60 Jaqueline Cristian in sweltering conditions.Swiatek broke the 60th-ranked Cristian twice in a comfortable first set, but she was pushed a lot harder by her rival in the second and had to save six break points.""She really stepped up in the second set. I had to step up as well. It was an entertaining match,"" said Swiatek, hoping to become the first woman to win four successive Roland Garros titles since Suzanne Lenglen 102 years ago.The 23-year-old Pole will next play 12th seed Elena Rybakina after the Kazakh dispatched 2017 champion Jelena Ostapenko 6-2, 6-2 in a clash of big hitters.Swiatek has a 4-4 record against Rybakina but has lost both previous meetings on clay. However she was relieved at avoiding Ostapenko, who is 6-0 against her.A grinning Swiatek suggested earlier she had no preference as to her last-16 opponent before asking: ""Am I a good liar?""""Let's say it doesn't matter, really. Oh, my God. I couldn't play poker,"" joked the world number five who has not won a title since last year's French Open.Sabalenka produced a dominant display in a 6-2, 6-3 win over 34th-ranked Serbian left-hander Olga Danilovic.But the Madrid Open winner, whose best result at Roland Garros was a semi-final in Paris two years ago, insisted the pressure was on Swiatek.""Let's just leave it (the pressure) on Iga (Swiatek) since she won it, what, three times in a row,"" said Sabalenka.The 27-year-old Belarusian next plays 16th-seeded American Amanda Anisimova who ousted Danish 22nd seed Clara Tauson 7-6 (7/4), 6-4 in their third-round tie.Zheng Qinwen ended the run of Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko 6-3, 6-4.The Chinese eighth seed has now won nine successive matches at Roland Garros following her run to Olympic gold last year.Zheng is through to the fourth round in Paris for the second time and will next play Russian 19th seed Liudmila Samsonova who brushed aside Ukraine's Dayana Yastremska 6-2, 6-3.Italian fourth seed Paolini eased past Ukrainian lucky loser Yuliia Starodubtseva 6-4, 6-1.Runner-up last year at Roland Garros and Wimbledon, Paolini next plays Ukrainian 13th seed Elina Svitolina who dug deep to see off American Bernarda Pera 7-6 (7/4), 7-6 (7/5).Eighth seed Musetti won 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 against Argentine Mariano Navone as he follows on from his runner-up finish in Monte Carlo and semi-final runs in Madrid and Rome.But the Italian dropped his first set in Paris against world number 97 Navone.""I've grown up a lot. A match like this I don't know if I would (have) come back a few years ago,"" said Musetti.""The heat was pretty tough to manage. But happy to find a way to turn around the match.""Musetti next plays Rune who was two points from defeat in the fourth set before rallying past France's Quentin Halys 4-6, 6-2, 5-7, 7-5, 6-2.American Tommy Paul, the 12th seed, got past Russian Karen Khachanov 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (9/7), 3-6, 6-3 and meets Australian Alexei Popyrin, the 25th seed, who beat Portugal's Nuno Borges 6-4, 7-6 (13/11), 7-6 (7/5).Arthur Fils, the 14th seed, withdrew ahead of his third-round match on Saturday, extending the host nation's wait for a first men's champion at Roland Garros since Yannick Noah in 1983.","Carlos Alcaraz beats Damir Dzumhur to reach French Open last 16.

'I don't want to be a one-season wonder': Punjab Kings' Shashank Singh





A day after a one-sided affair in Qualifier 1, the Eliminator between Gujarat Titans (GT) and Mumbai Indians (MI) proved to be exactly what the doctor ordered at the New PCA Stadium in Mullanpur. It went down to the wire as MI defeated GT by 20 runs. MI will now take on Punjab Kings in Qualifier 2 on Sunday at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Gujarat.Rohit Sharma (81 off 50 balls; 9x4, 4x6) made the most of two reprieves offered by GT fielders as the five-time champions delivered a strong statement in the must-win match. After winning the toss, MI posted a formidable 228 for 5.Rohit was dropped twice—first by Gerald Coetzee and then by Kusal Mendis—and he made GT pay for those missed chances. In the second over, Prasidh Krishna banged one in short, and Rohit miscued a pull high into the air. Coetzee had enough time, kept his eyes on the ball, but shelled the skier. Rohit was on 4 at the time, looking to break free with a swivel pull.In the next over, Rohit dispatched two delightful boundaries off Mohammed Siraj. Siraj could’ve had the last laugh, but Mendis fumbled a thick edge behind the stumps—failing to grab it in two attempts.The fourth over completely turned the tide in MI’s favour, as Jonny Bairstow hammered 26 runs off Prasidh Krishna’s second over—featuring three sixes, including a monster hit into the second tier at Mullanpur.Making his first appearance of the season, Bairstow came out firing on all cylinders. He and Rohit forged a rollicking 84-run opening partnership, with 79 of those runs coming in the powerplay. Bairstow blazed his way to a 22-ball 47 before falling to Sai Kishore.The powerplay onslaught set the tone, and the rest of the MI batting unit kept the momentum going. Suryakumar Yadav (33 off 20 balls; 1x4, 3x6) and Tilak Varma (25 off 11; 3x6) chipped in with impactful cameos. Captain Hardik Pandya (22* off 9; 3x6) provided the finishing touches, smashing Coetzee for 22 runs in the final over.Prasidh Krishna (2/53) and Sai Kishore (2/42) took two wickets each, but most of GT’s bowlers proved expensive. However, Team India management and Test captain Shubman Gill may be concerned after Mohammed Siraj, who dismissed Tilak Varma in the 18th over, appeared to pull his hamstring later in the same over.Sai Sudharsan continues to redefine orthodoxy in T20 cricket. His classical technique offers a refreshing counter to the notion that T20 cricket is eroding traditional skills. In this IPL season, Sudharsan has shown that the two formats—Test and T20—can indeed coexist. While broadcasters may try to strip away the “cricket” from T20, players like Sudharsan keep putting it right back in.On Friday, the 23-year-old produced yet another masterclass. He scored a classy 80 off 49 balls, laced with 10 boundaries and a six. Despite his aggressive approach, Sudharsan rarely loses shape, showcasing a full range of proper cricketing shots.GT’s chase began on a poor note, with Trent Boult removing skipper Shubman Gill for just 1. But Sudharsan continued in red-hot form, hitting a six off Boult and finding support in Kusal Mendis, who launched two sixes in the same over. The duo kept the momentum going, especially as Sudharsan struck two boundaries off Richard Gleeson’s first over.Hardik Pandya brought himself on but was welcomed with two boundaries from Sudharsan and one from Mendis, who narrowly escaped a run-out at the end of the powerplay. However, Mendis was soon out in bizarre fashion—hit wicket after stepping on the stumps and falling flat on his back.Sudharsan found another able partner in Washington Sundar (48 off 24), and together they stitched an 84-run stand off just 46 balls. At that point, GT looked well on course to make Qualifier 2. But Jasprit Bumrah, the ultimate T20 cheat code, yorked Sundar to break the stand.Shortly after, Gleeson dismissed Sudharsan, effectively ending GT’s hopes. Lower-order efforts from Sherfane Rutherford (24), Rahul Tewatia (16), and Shahrukh Khan (16) weren’t enough, as MI held their nerves and marched on to the next round.",Mumbai Indians defeated Gujarat Titans by 20 runs in IPL Qualifier 2. Rohit Sharma (81) and Jonny Bairstow (47) scored centuries for MI. MI will now take on Punjab Kings in the second Qualifier on Sunday.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121523727,imgsize-84954,width-400,resizemode-4/121523727.jpg"
