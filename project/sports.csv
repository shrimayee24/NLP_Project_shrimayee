Taylor Swift’s quiet date night with Travis Kelce in Palm Beach sparks concern amid Blake Lively drama

Travis Kelce trains hard while Taylor Swift seeks peace of mind

P op superstar Taylor Swift and NFL tight end Travis Kelce were spotted together on a subdued date night in Palm Beach, Florida, drawing both fan admiration and media speculation. The couple, usually vibrant and playful in public, appeared noticeably restrained as they exited Harry’s restaurant late Friday evening, marking one of their few public sightings this year.Observers noted Taylor Swift looked “a little down,” a contrast to her usual radiant demeanor. While she eventually relaxed over dinner—reportedly enjoying a glass of white wine and smiling while placing her order—the somber mood raised eyebrows. It’s a shift that many believe stems from recent personal upheaval involving longtime friend Blake Lively and actor Justin Baldoni.The typically private Swift was drawn into an unexpected legal conflict between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, a dispute that reportedly threatened to expose personal messages between the singer and the Gossip Girl actress. A subpoena issued earlier this month demanded Swift’s involvement, but it has since been withdrawn.Despite the legal resolution, the emotional strain seems to linger.According to reports, Baldoni’s legal team claimed that Lively had ""pressured Swift to publicly side with her,"" potentially putting their friendship—and Swift’s reputation—on the line. The singer, known for her meticulous control over her public image, remained silent throughout the ordeal, avoiding public comment and any legal entanglements that could compromise her privacy.While Swift takes time off from touring to recover emotionally and mentally, Kelce is taking a different approach to the offseason. The Kansas City Chiefs star has been laser-focused on fitness, reportedly shedding 25 pounds and undergoing grueling training sessions in Miami ahead of the team’s May 27 activities.“Travis Kelce confidently shows off his hairy back during an intense offseason workout session,” a headline teased, showcasing his transformation and commitment to a stronger 2025 season.

Whether this offseason brings them closer together or highlights their individual challenges remains to be seen.

Derek Green’s football roots and surprising career shift

From mystery man to Insta-official: Gracie and Derek’s budding romance

Gracie Hunt, the glamorous daughter of Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt, is once again in the spotlight—this time not for the team’s Super Bowl success, but for her new relationship. After much speculation and cryptic Instagram posts, the mystery man in Gracie’s life has finally been revealed as Derek Green, the son of former NFL quarterback and Chiefs legend Trent Green.Derek Green certainly has NFL pedigree running through his veins. His father, Trent Green, enjoyed a stellar 15-season NFL career—including six seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs—and even earned two Pro Bowl selections. While Derek initially pursued the same path, playing quarterback at Southern Methodist University (SMU) from 2018 to 2021, he later transferred to Long Island University in 2022. However, he quietly exited the gridiron, choosing not to pursue a long-term football career.Instead, Derek redirected his focus to academics and business. He graduated with a degree in finance and briefly played for the European League of Football between 2023 and 2024. According to his LinkedIn, he now works as a Sports Operations Manager at Creative Planning. His career transition may have distanced him from the football field, but it seems fate kept him close to the Chiefs family—especially now, as the boyfriend of the team owner's daughter.Gracie Hunt had fans buzzing for weeks as she shared sun-soaked vacation photos featuring a then-unnamed man. The Instagram post from May 18 featured the couple enjoying a beachside getaway with friends, and fans immediately speculated on her new beau’s identity. Alongside the romantic snapshots, Gracie wrote a heartfelt caption:“My heart is full. Grateful for some much-needed time to rest, reflect, and reset after a whirlwind few months post-football season. So thankful for time with the people who keep me grounded, remind me I’m loved, and never fail to make me laugh.”Adding to the glamour, the couple also recently traveled to Monaco with the Hunt family, likely in anticipation of the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix.Also Read: “It's happening”: Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld wedding buzz intensifies as Dion Dawkins backpedals on May 31 date While neither Gracie nor Derek have made an official media statement, their social media chemistry and shared Chiefs connection make one thing clear—this isn’t just a fling.

AEW Double Or Nothing Post Show Media Scrum | Glendale, AZ 5/25/25

WWE counters AEW with strategic scheduling

All Elite Wrestling (AEW) President Tony Khan didn’t hold back while addressing the growing rivalry between AEW and WWE during the post-Double or Nothing 2025 media scrum. With both promotions running events on the same weekend, Khan was asked about WWE’s recent trend of counter-programming AEW pay-per-views. His response was both historical and defiant.“It’s pretty consistent,” Khan said. “I’d say it’s the most consistent event head-to-head scheduling since Jim Crockett Promotions. Saw a lot of scheduling that went that way. And I can tell you this will go a lot differently than that did.”The comparison to Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) is a significant one. Back in the 1980s, JCP often clashed with WWE programming, with the rivalry culminating in the WWF running Survivor Series opposite JCP’s Starrcade in 1987. The financial strain from such scheduling eventually led JCP to sell to Turner Broadcasting in 1988.Khan’s remarks come at a time when WWE appears to be intensifying its counter-programming strategy. On the same weekend as AEW’s Double or Nothing, WWE held both NXT Battleground and Saturday Night’s Main Event. Even more notably, WWE has lined up their second all-women’s premium live event, Evolution, for the day after AEW’s biggest show of the year - All In: Texas - set for July 12 at Globe Life Field in Arlington.Additionally, WWE’s programming calendar includes a European tour during AEW’s Forbidden Door event in London this August, signalling what many believe to be a clear attempt to divert attention and viewership.Despite WWE’s attempts to dominate the schedule, Khan remains optimistic and assertive. His tone during the media scrum was confident, suggesting that AEW has learned from history and is better equipped to handle such competition.While Khan didn’t reveal specific strategies to combat WWE’s moves, his message was clear: AEW isn’t intimidated, and it’s prepared to maintain its momentum in the face of growing pressure.With both companies now regularly overlapping major events, the professional wrestling landscape is heating up like never before in the modern era. For fans, it’s a flashback to the legendary Monday Night Wars of the late 1990s - only this time, the battle spans not just Monday nights but weekends and international tours as well.With AEW’s All In: Texas and Forbidden Door on the horizon, and WWE ramping up its own counter-efforts, wrestling fans could be witnessing the birth of a new golden age, where competition drives creativity and both companies are pushed to deliver their very best.What’s clear is this: the rivalry between WWE and AEW is no longer theoretical. It’s unfolding live, and the industry may be better for it.",All Elite Wrestling (AEW) President Tony Khan was asked about WWE’s recent trend of counter-programming AEW pay-per-views.

Brad Marchand Dairy Queen Blizzard controversy: Ice Cream snack or smart marketing strategy?



When playoff hockey is on the line, every detail matters — every goal, every pass, and apparently, every snack. But in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals, the spotlight shifted from the ice to something far sweeter: Did Boston Bruins’ star Brad Marchand sneak in a Dairy Queen Blizzard between periods? What started as a casual comment has quickly turned into one of the most talked-about off-ice moments of the postseason, raising eyebrows, fueling rumors, and even hinting at a savvy marketing play.The story kicked off after Marchand’s team, the Florida Panthers, crushed the Carolina Hurricanes 6-2. During a post-game interview with Sportsnet’s Kyle Bukauskas, Marchand was asked about a viral video showing him eating something off a spoon between periods. His response? A confident admission of enjoying a “little chocolate chip cookie dough Blizzard.”However, Panthers coach Paul Maurice wasn’t so sure: “I know he said it. I’m just not sure that makes it a fact.” That doubt isn’t unfounded. Teams typically fuel their players with high-protein, performance-focused snacks like peanut butter or nuts, not sugary ice cream, especially during critical playoff games.Still, the Panthers’ recent Dairy Queen visit in North Carolina and the proximity of a DQ near their home arena make the story plausible. But could Marchand have been playing the media, delivering a sweet tease to fans and potential sponsors? His cheeky follow-up—requesting a “lifetime free supply of Dairy Queen”—suggests this might be more than just a simple snack confession.Also Read: Carolina Hurricanes set unwanted NHL record with 15 straight Eastern Conference Finals losses What’s undeniable is that whatever Marchand ate seemed to work, he scored a crucial goal shortly after his alleged Blizzard break, helping seal the Panthers’ victory.

With Gujarat Titans, Royal Challengers Bengaluru, MI, and PBKS having secured playoff spots earlier than usual, the remaining league matches will determine the final standings.Currently placed second with 17 points, PBKS risk slipping to third or even fourth with a loss to MI, which would place them in the Eliminator on May 30.Securing a top-two finish appears challenging for PBKS, as they not only need to defeat a formidable MI side but also rely on both GT (18 points) and RCB (17 points) losing their final matches.Having lost their previous game to Delhi Capitals, PBKS now find themselves in a must-win scenario against MI to stay in contention for a top-two finish.MI, on the other hand, can benefit from their superior Net Run Rate among the four playoff teams. A win against Punjab Kings, combined with losses for GT and RCB, could significantly boost their chances of securing a top-two spot.Ahead of the much-anticipated clash, RJ Mahvash—rumoured to be spinner Yuzvendra Chahal 's girlfriend—had a fan-girl moment as she met Punjab Kings co-owner and actress Preity Zinta at Rambagh Palace in Jaipur.RJ Mahvash took to Instagram to share a series of pictures and a video from the palace.""Isn't Zaara the most gorgeous?"" she wrote while sharing photos with Preity Zinta.MUMBAI INDIANS: Hardik Pandya (c), Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Robin Minz (wk), Ryan Rickelton (wk), Shrijith Krishnan (wk), Bevon Jacobs, Tilak Varma, Naman Dhir, Will Jacks, Mitchell Santner, Raj Angad Bawa, Raghu Sharma, Corbin Bosch, Trent Boult, Karn Sharma, Deepak Chahar, Ashwani Kumar, Reece Topley, VS Penmetsa, Arjun Tendulkar, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Jasprit Bumrah.PUNJAB KINGS: Shreyas Iyer (c), Nehal Wadhera, Vishnu Vinod (wk), Josh Inglis (wk), Harnoor Pannu, Pyla Avinash, Prabhsimran Singh (wk), Shashank Singh, Marcus Stoinis, Harpreet Brar, Marco Jansen, Azmatullah Omarzai, Priyansh Arya, Aaron Hardie, Musheer Khan, Suryansh Shedge, Mitch Owen, Arshdeep Singh, Vyshak Vijaykumar, Yash Thakur, Kuldeep Sen, Xavier Bartlett, Pravin Dubey, Kyle Jamieson.","Mumbai Indians and Punjab Kings meet in their final league-stage fixture of the Indian Premier League here on Monday.

WWE Superstar Zoey Stark made her comeback to the limelight in a tragic manner on the recent episode of Monday Night RAW. What was supposed to be a critical milestone in her career, Stark got severely injured in her knee in a triple-threat qualifying match for the 2025 Women's Money in the Bank (MITB) ladder match. The incident has not only sidelined her from one of WWE’s most prestigious events but may also signal a prolonged absence from in-ring competition.The accident occurred at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, South Carolina, during a MITB qualifier bout between Zoey Stark, Kairi Sane, and Rhea Ripley. At its climax, Stark tried her characteristic springboard dropkick—a sportslike move that requires agility and accuracy. In targeting Kairi Sane, Stark slipped in executing the springboard, resulting in her awkwardly landing on her right leg.The blow caused her knee to bend in a distinctly unnatural manner, quite visibly startling both supporters and commentators. The match instantly became secondary as paramedics rushed onto the field to treat the hurt athlete. After the botched maneuver, Stark fell to the floor, cradling her right knee and exhibiting obvious signs of pain and distress. The referee stopped the match for a moment and motioned for medical attention. WWE ringside physicians made their way into the ring and evaluated her condition.Despite the extent of the injury, Stark first tried to leave the ring independently. She tried to stand, only to fall again, as she could no longer bear the weight of herself. Eventually, she was assisted backstage by medical personnel, affirming the severity of the ordeal.Veteran WWE play-by-play commentator Michael Cole guessed on-air that Stark may have re-aggravated an old injury. Stark had extensive knee surgery in 2021 to repair a torn ACL, MCL, and meniscus—injuries requiring months of rehabilitation.With the visual similarity and reaction of Stark, there is an increasing fear that her current injury is a recurrence or exacerbation of the same condition of the knee. But to date, WWE has not issued a formal medical diagnosis or recovery timeline. The wrestling fraternity came in support of Stark after the injury. AEW wrestler Thunder Rosa showed her concern with a heartfelt post on social media:""Wrestling is a lovely and risky sport. We leave everything on the table every time we go to the ring, and we also put a lot on the line when we do what we are passionate about. Zoey Stark, I love you, sister, and I hope that you heal soon."" — Thunder Rosa through X (previously Twitter)Zoey Stark's RAW match was her first on television since January. She had last remained an active member of the dissolved faction Pure Fusion Collective, after Sonya Deville and Shayna Baszler left. Stark was competing mainly in non-televised WWE house shows and sporadic Main Event tapings before this return.As a result of her earlier knee damage incurred during her stint in NXT, Stark was drafted to the main roster as part of the 2023 WWE Draft—a testament to how much the WWE believed in her promising future. The MITB qualifier was set to be a career-launching experience, which made her untimely injury so much more heartbreaking.With Stark out, the match went on between the remaining participants. Rhea Ripley took advantage of the situation, overpowering Kairi Sane and finishing the match with her characteristic Riptide finisher. The pinfall win earned Ripley a spot in the upcoming ladder match for Women's Money in the Bank, which is to be held on June 7. Ripley’s victory, however, was overshadowed by the concern surrounding Stark’s health, as WWE fans and analysts alike shifted focus to the severity of the injury.The extent of Stark’s injury remains unconfirmed by WWE, leaving her return date unknown. Given her history of severe knee damage, fans and medical experts fear that she could face another lengthy recovery process. This injury not only removes her from one of WWE’s most career-defining matches but also risks stalling the momentum she had just begun to regain. For now, Zoey Stark’s fans—and the WWE Universe as a whole—await official word from WWE’s medical team.","WWE superstar Zoey Stark suffers a painful knee injury during MITB qualifier match.

In a high stakes clash at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur, Punjab Kings and Mumbai Indians faced off in the penultimate match of the IPL 2025 league stage. The winner of this game was guaranteed a top-two finish and a place in Qualifier 1.Punjab Kings captain Shreyas Iyer won the toss and elected to field first, banking on the advantage of chasing under lights.Mumbai Indians posted a competitive total of 184 for seven, thanks to crucial contributions from Suryakumar Yadav and Hardik Pandya . Suryakumar was once again the standout performer, scoring 57 off 39 balls. In the process, he broke Sachin Tendulkar’s long-standing record to become Mumbai Indians’ highest run-scorer in a single IPL season. Hardik Pandya chipped in with a quickfire 26 off just 15 balls, providing much-needed acceleration in the death overs.Opener Ryan Rickelton gave MI a positive start with 27 off 20 balls, helping his team reach 52 for one in the powerplay despite facing a probing spell from Arshdeep Singh. Kyle Jamieson, making his debut for Punjab Kings, was taken for a few early boundaries by Rickelton but settled down as the innings progressed.Rohit Sharma played a steady hand with 24 off 21 balls, including a classy straight hit over mid-off against Marco Jansen. However, Jansen got the better of Rickelton in the sixth over, inducing a mistimed shot that was caught at mid-on. Harpreet Brar, filling in for the injured Yuzvendra Chahal, continued his impressive form by removing Rohit Sharma. Nehal Wadhera took a fine catch at long-on to complete the dismissal.Mumbai found themselves in a spot of bother at 106 for four in the 13th over. Vijaykumar Vyshak’s wide lines worked well in the middle overs, as he dismissed both Will Jacks and Tilak Varma in quick succession. But the tide turned in the 19th over when Mumbai hammered Vyshak for 23 runs. Suryakumar and Naman Dhir (20 off 12) played key roles in this late surge.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Despite the momentum shift, Arshdeep Singh bowled a sensational final over, conceding only three runs and picking up two wickets to restrict Mumbai to 184.Punjab Kings’ chase started on a shaky note, losing Prabhsimran Singh early for 13 off 16 balls to Jasprit Bumrah. But a powerful 109-run partnership between Priyansh Arya and Josh Inglis completely turned the tide. Arya struck a composed 62 before falling to Mitchell Santner, who also claimed the wicket of Inglis after a brilliant 73 off 42 balls.Captain Shreyas Iyer stayed calm and composed, finishing the chase with an unbeaten 26 off 15 balls alongside Nehal Wadhera, who made 2 off 2. PBKS reached the target in 18.3 overs.With this result, Punjab Kings have secured a top-two finish and a spot in Qualifier 1. They will face either Gujarat Titans or Royal Challengers Bengaluru, depending on the outcome of tomorrow’s match between LSG and RCB. If RCB win, they will finish in the top two and play PBKS. If not, GT will take that second spot and face Punjab.Mumbai Indians, meanwhile, will play in the Eliminator. Finishing in the top two offers a valuable cushion—if a team loses Qualifier 1, they get another chance in Qualifier 2 against the Eliminator winner, keeping their path to the final alive.","Punjab Kings beat Mumbai Indians by eight wickets in IPL 2025.

Why Zach Wilson is the Dolphins ’ backup QB for now



The Miami Dolphins are placing a controversial bet by entrusting Zach Wilson, once branded a draft bust by New York Jets fans with a critical backup quarterback role. With starter Tua Tagovailoa’s injury woes continuing to loom large, Miami’s hopes for offensive stability may rest heavily on a player whose NFL career has been anything but smooth. But is Wilson truly the answer, or just another gamble destined to backfire?When the Dolphins drafted Wilson from the Jets’ rubble, fans and analysts alike were skeptical. After all, Wilson’s highly touted potential seemed to evaporate under the intense pressure of the NFL spotlight. He was a No. 2 overall pick with a rocket arm but inconsistent decision-making and mounting turnovers tainted his early years. Despite that, Miami is banking on him to be their immediate contingency plan if Tua goes down again.The alternative is Quinn Ewers, Miami’s seventh-round pick out of Texas, who has yet to prove he belongs in the league. Dolphins beat writer Alain Poupart recently addressed this debate in a mailbag Q&A, emphatically stating Ewers won’t supplant Wilson anytime soon. ""It’s absolutely Wilson’s job to lose,"" Poupart insisted, the Dolphins aren’t ready to roll the dice on a rookie who’s still raw and lacks NFL seasoning.Wilson’s arm talent and experience, even if underwhelming, make him the safer choice in Miami’s eyes. Ewers, once a five-star recruit, now struggles with a comparatively weaker arm and zero pro experience, a risky proposition given the Dolphins’ championship aspirations. While Ewers might develop into a reliable backup down the line, the immediate future demands someone who can manage the offense competently at the drop of a hat.Yet, this decision leaves Miami fans uneasy. Wilson’s history of underperformance is well-documented, and his stint with the Jets was riddled with questionable throws and poor field awareness.Also Read: Cleveland Browns QB battle 2025: Dillon Gabriel, Shedeur Sanders, and Cade Klubnik’s impact on the franchise future For now, the Dolphins want Tagovailoa under center as much as possible. But when injuries strike, the team expects Wilson to step in seamlessly, or risk another year of offensive instability. It’s a high-stakes gamble on a player who has more to prove than most, and the NFL world will be watching closely to see if Miami’s faith in Wilson is redemption or another costly mistake.","The Miami Dolphins are placing a controversial bet by entrusting Zach Wilson with a critical backup quarterback role.

Winnipeg Jets end of season media availability: Kyle Connor

Plugging the second-line center position is still a priority



Winnipeg Jets need to balance grit and skill for playoff success



A summer of make-or-break decisions is looming for Winnipeg Jets



With the Winnipeg Jets preparing for a decisive 2025 NHL offseason, clarity on forward Nikolaj Ehlers is now the organization's number-one priority. The path of Ehlers' future will heavily dictate the team's direction, particularly with important restricted free agents such as Gabriel Vilardi and Dylan Samberg also needing long-term attention. The Winnipeg Jets seem to have a summer of defining moments that can solidify their Stanley Cup ambitions or set up a window of doubt.While the Jets can give Nikolaj Ehlers a contract in the $8.5–$9 million per-year range — on par with forward Mark Scheifele's salary scale — the Danish winger could choose to pursue a different option, with teams such as the New Jersey Devils and Carolina Hurricanes reportedly watching his situation.Should Nikolaj Ehlers walk, the Jets will need to redirect their cap space strategically. Veterans Brock Boeser and Brock Nelson, who have been on Winnipeg's list in the past, might be targets to add depth up front. Winnipeg has not fared well with unrestricted free agents, so internal development or trade solutions proactively might be more feasible.Gabriel Vilardi and Dylan Samberg locked up multi-year deals is the next step that makes sense.Vilardi, who scored 61 points playing in 71 games last year, might take a short-term contract to wager on a cap boost in the future, while Winnipeg might balance that with his injury history before committing long-term. Samberg, on the other hand, provides stability on defense and adds intangibles with his connections to the local community. At 26 years old and with free agency eligibility in 2026, signing him now might avoid complications next summer.Aside from the immediate contract negotiations, Winnipeg also needs to set the foundation for 2026 free agents like Kyle Connor, Adam Lowry, and Cole Perfetti. Connor's extension will be the most expensive and one that will have long-term cap consequences, so early projecting is critical. Perfetti, who can expect a top power-play opportunity soon, might be an astute early extension option before his price goes up.The Jets' consistent failure to find a surefire second-line center remains an area of weakness. Previous trade rentals, such as Sean Monahan and Kevin Hayes, haven't panned out in the long term, and the organization can no longer continue to give away first-round draft picks searching for Band-Aids. Internal alternatives such as Brad Lambert and Cole Perfetti have questions around them, so this is a position that might again need outside help—perhaps in free agency, should the right man present himself.Rosters like the Florida Panthers and Edmonton Oilers emphasize roster balance between toughness and skill. While additions such as Nino Niederreiter and Alex Iafallo have brought some edge to the Jets, perhaps a physical player or two with scoring potential would serve the team well. Without overcorrecting, the Jets need to keep looking for players who are a combination of intensity and offense.Also read: Nikolaj Ehlers faces a big summer career decision as his current season shows strong form The Winnipeg Jets are facing one of their most critical offseasons in recent history. With cap space, a core unit on the verge of contract decisions, and playoff aspirations still within reach, the course the organization takes with Nikolaj Ehlers, Gabriel Vilardi, and Dylan Samberg will dictate the direction for seasons to come. If the Jets can make these moves smartly, they'll be confident Stanley Cup contenders heading into the 2025-26 season, but a wrong move will jeopardize all they've gained.","The Winnipeg Jets have a summer of defining moments that can solidify their Stanley Cup ambitions or set up a window of doubt.

Boat Names and Diamond Rings: Bill Belichick hinting at a major life change



Bill Belichick has always kept his private life out of the spotlight—until now. The NFL world is abuzz with speculation after the 72-year-old coaching legend’s much-younger girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, was photographed sporting what appears to be an engagement ring. The image, snapped at Raleigh-Durham International Airport and reported by TMZ Sports, has sparked a media frenzy, with fans and critics alike asking: Is Belichick really heading down the aisle?The speculation didn’t start overnight. The same dazzling ring was first noticed back in April during the couple’s appearance at a high-profile luncheon in New York City. At the time, it raised eyebrows but now, with multiple sightings and fresh details emerging, the engagement rumors have reached a boiling point.Fueling the fire further is the curious case of Belichick’s famously named boat. Previously called “VIII Rings” in tribute to his eight Super Bowl victories, the vessel now reportedly bears a new title: “I + VIII Rings.” Many see the update as a not-so-subtle nod to a ninth ring, perhaps an engagement ring for Hudson.While the couple went public with their relationship in late 2024, they’ve mostly dodged media questions.That changed during an awkward CBS Sunday Morning interview, when reporter Tony Dokoupil asked how the two met. Before Belichick could answer, Hudson quickly cut him off, saying, “We’re not talking about this.” The tense moment quickly went viral, and public opinion hasn’t been quiet since.Some see the relationship as a private matter between two consenting adults. Others argue it’s a distraction from Belichick’s current role at the University of North Carolina, where questions are already swirling about his future. The nearly 50-year age gap has also sparked criticism, with many questioning the dynamics of the relationship.Also Read: Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes set for major comeback and possible contract extension in 2025 Still, amid the backlash and attention, neither Belichick nor Hudson has confirmed or denied the engagement.

The Buffalo Bills have taken the AFC East division every year since 2020. They are still the best team in one of the NFL's weaker divisions. While the New England Patriots, New York Jets, and Miami Dolphins try to catch up, none have succeeded. The Miami Dolphins showed some hope in recent seasons, but they collapsed late in the year. Now in 2025, both the New England Patriots and New York Jets have brought in new head coaches. Still, doubts remain about whether they can seriously challenge the Buffalo Bills’ dominance in the near future.The New England Patriots named Mike Vrabel as their new coach in January 2025. It was during a broadcast from Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts. Mike Vrabel was active for the New England Patriots from 2001 to 2008.He was named the head coach of the Tennessee Titans in 2018. He led them to the A.F.C. championship game in 2019 and departed the franchise in 2023.

The hiring occurred in MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, Aaron Glenn had previously played for the New York Jets and been the defensive coordinator of the Detroit Lions from 2021 to 2024.He brings leadership but faces a big rebuild. Despite these changes, the Buffalo Bills remain far ahead. NFL Spin Zone writer Lou Scataglia, on May 10, 2025, predicted the New England Patriots would finish 8–9 and the New York Jets 5–12 in 2025.

The New England Patriots and the New York Jets are rebuilding, but for now, Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills are still the team to beat.","Buffalo Bills have taken the AFC East division every year since 2020.

NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings produced a clinical all-round performance to defeat Mumbai Indians by seven wickets and confirm a top-two finish in the IPL 2025 league stage. The result not only propelled Punjab to the summit of the points table with 19 points but also ensured them a berth in Qualifier 1, giving them two chances to reach the final.For Mumbai Indians, the loss meant they slipped to fourth place with 16 points and will now play in the Eliminator.With this victory, Punjab Kings capped off a consistent league campaign, registering 9 wins, 4 losses, and one no-result across their 14 matches. Their net run rate of +0.372 helped them edge past Gujarat Titans, who also won 9 matches but finished second with 18 points and a slightly lower NRR of +0.254.Royal Challengers Bengaluru, who still have one game remaining, sit third with 17 points from 13 matches. A win in their final game (vs Lucknow Super Giants) could potentially push them to second place, but for now, they are locked in for a playoff berth.Mumbai Indians, despite boasting the highest net run rate (+1.142) among all teams, slipped to fourth due to their sixth defeat of the season. Their road to the IPL final has now become more difficult, with the Eliminator being a do-or-die clash.Delhi Capitals finished just outside the top four, ending their season with 15 points.While they fought hard and maintained a positive NRR (+0.011), one more win could have made all the difference. Sunrisers Hyderabad also showed glimpses of promise but ultimately bowed out with 13 points.Lucknow Super Giants, Kolkata Knight Riders, Rajasthan Royals, and Chennai Super Kings all endured disappointing campaigns. None of them could breach the 12-point mark, with CSK and RR ending at the bottom of the table with just 8 points each. For former champions like CSK, it marked the end of an underwhelming season where both batting and bowling failed to click consistently.As the playoffs loom, the stage is set for a thrilling finish. Punjab Kings, Gujarat Titans, Royal Challengers Bengaluru, and Mumbai Indians will battle it out for IPL 2025 glory. With the top two teams getting the cushion of a second chance, the pressure will be intense, especially in the Eliminator, where one loss spells the end of the road.","Punjab Kings beat Mumbai Indians by seven wickets to seal top-two finish.

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

MUMBAI: Even as questions linger over whether Shubman Gill is the right choice as India’s new Test captain, leg spin great Anil Kumble has thrown his weight behind the 25-year-old, saying he is “capable” of handling the job — though he did note that captaining a franchise like Gujarat Titans is “slightly different” from leading the Indian team.On Saturday, India’s selection committee appointed Gill as captain for the upcoming fiveTest series in England in June-July.“I think captaincy for India is slightly different from captaining a franchise or any state side; it comes with its own responsibilities and pressures. But I’m sure Shubman will figure it out, and I think he is capable. They (India’s young team) are all capable — you’ve seen that with the kind of cricket they play and the brand of cricket they represent,”Kumble said on Monday during a fireside chat on the Australia Summer of Cricket 2025-26, organised by JioStar, Cricket Australia, and the Australian Government.Former Australian captain Steve Waugh, ex-Aussie opener Matthew Hayden, and ex-India opener Robin Uthappa were also in attendance. Kumble added that, as a cricket fan, it would feel unusual not to see the names of Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma , and R Ashwin, whom he referred to as the “three pillars of Indian cricket”— when India takes the field for the first Test at Leeds on June 20.“Transition is bound to happen, and with three pillars of Indian cricket not available, it’s going to be different, for us as fans too—when the Indian team takes the field in the first Test and those three names aren’t there.That’s something I’m sure the dressing room will get used to,” Kumble said.India will tour Australia later this year for a white-ball series comprising three ODIs and five T20Is, beginning with the first ODI on October 19.Kumble acknowledged that it won’t be “easy” for Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli to continue playing only ODIs as they are getting increasingly sparse.","Anil Kumble backs Shubman Gill as India's new Test captain.

The segment ended with Rollins vowing to qualify for the Money in the Bank ladder match and become the World Champion again.This was the first Money in the Bank Triple Threat qualifying match of the night. The three delivered a spectacular showdown that was exciting to watch. In the end, Mexican star El Hijo del Vikingo, who was in the crowd, came to the ring and kicked Chad Gable when the referee was not watching. This led to Penta delivering the Mexican Destroyer to Dragon Lee, followed by a Penta Driver to Gable to win the match.This was a mere squash match that ended in minutes as Rusev delivered a huge kick and made Akira Tozawa tap out.He refused to release the hold after the match ended. This led to his former ally and rival, Sheamus, to come down to the ring to confront him.The triple-threat tag team match was for the New Day's WWE World Tag Team Championships.

She confronted Dominik Mysterio about recent events that have been happening with Judgment Day and Roxanne Perez earlier in the night. Later on, she had an exciting match against Kairi Sane. However, Perez came down to the ringside in the final moments of the bout. She pushed Sane off the top rope and got into an altercation with Raquel Rodriguez. The distraction cost Morgan as Sane took advantage to pick up the win.Lyra Valkyria and Becky Lynch had a heated exchange over the fact that Lyra had now beaten Lynch twice in her career. The Man proposed a third match for the WWE Women's Intercontinental Championship, and if she lost, she would never challenge Valkyria for the title, to which she agreed.This was the main event and the last Money in the Bank Triple Threat qualifying match of the night. Tensions were evident between Seth Rollins and Sami Zayn, while Finn Balor tried to gain the upper hand. Dominik Mysterio came in the end and pushed a chair into the ring. Balor attempted to grab it but instead got his head stomped into it by Rollins, who pinned him to qualify. Right after his win, CM Punk's music hit, and he entered the ring from behind to nail Rollins with a GTS. Punk ran out into the crowd before Rollins' faction members, Bronson Reed and Bron Breakker, could get their hands on him.Also read: Tony Khan calls out WWE's scheduling tactics - ""This will go a lot differently than JCP""

Michael Beasley takes a firm stand on the issue

""I hate this narrative on Luka, right? It's just something that I'm hearing in the news. I hate this ""out of shape"" narrative that I'm hearing, 'cause it's like everybody that's saying he's out of shape is the same ones that's cheering hurrah hurrah when he's scoring 50 points or 60 points.”

""It's like, when I'm scoring 50, tell me then to get in shape,""

""The second I get a turnover, or the second I don't win one of the games that you clearly been paying me — now I'm out of shape? That s**t messes up the players' money. And the organizations know what they're doing. That's not fair.”

While Luka Doncic is one the greatest basketball players, for some people he doesn’t try hard on defense and isn’t in the best shape. This impacts his image, especially after his team lost early in the playoffs. Some believe his poor fitness is why the Dallas Mavericks traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers. However, former NBA player and former Los Angeles Lakers’ star player Michael Beasley firmly disagrees.Michael Beasley firmly believes if Luka Doncic was really out of shape, he wouldn’t be able to score so much or lead a team to the NBA Finals like he did. Beasley thinks Luka’s performance proves he's better than people give him credit for. In the NBA, if a player needs to score well, a lot of strength and energy is required. Luka takes over 20 shots per game and has led his team to the Finals, which proves he can handle the tough physical game.Beasley said:Beasley believes people only criticize Luka Doncic’s fitness when his team loses. But when Luka scores well, like 73 points, even against tough defenses, the criticism disappears. Beasley says this shows Luka is clearly fit and skilled, and the negative talk only comes up when things go wrong.""In order to score 50, you have to be in shape to shoot at least 30 shots, right? Especially in the NBA. When it works, what shape are we speaking about? It's like you always have to find something bad to say about him. And it's like—why? Like bro, sometimes the other guy was just better and just bust their ass. And just really bust their ass. And it's as simple as that.”Beasley further adds:the ""Walking Bucket"" stressed.Also Read: Luka Doncic Steps Out To Watch A Game In Spain; Fans Comment On His Slimmer Look: “He Loses Weight In Off-Season Then Gains It Back While NBA fans have been pleased to see Luka after at a recent game in Spain, having lost weight, Luka’s strategies haven’t changed a bit.

The French Tennis Federation’s tribute to Rafael Nadal was surfeit with moments that make memories. Be it the legendary Spaniard’s speech, done in three languages or the magnificent setting of the stands, dressed in ochre, and the permanent imprint of the 14-time champion’s foot. It was a ceremony with a soul.But when his three greatest rivals Roger Federer Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray walked out onto Court Philippe Chatrier late on Sunday evening, it looked like the early scenes of a gripping sequel.Nadal has shared a match court with these men 124 times, only a fraction of the 1300-odd matches he has played in his career, yet it was this very rivalry that held his career together, like the binding of a book.After the hour-long function the four men hung together and shared laughs, which Nadal was asked about in the press conference that followed.The soon-to-be 39-year-old started the answer with good intentions, saying they had each enquired about families, but then, just like that, the competitive fire was stoked.“You know, my good friend Andy, we were not in touch for a while, but the day Arsenal beat Real Madrid (in the Champions League quarter final in April), one second after the match, he texted me,” Nadal said, reaching for his phone. “I’m going to read (the message), because it's quite good, interesting…”“Hey Rafa, haven't spoken to you in a while.Just checking in to make sure you are okay,” Nadal read from his phone before looking up at a laughing press room. “It took me like five seconds to realise what I was reading. In the beginning, I said, okay, he's such a nice guy. He's asking how I'm doing. After five seconds… This Bbrrriiitish sense of humour.”Only Nadal wasn’t done, he had the angled forehand to rip. “By the way, I didn't text him back when PSG beat Arsenal.""Competition aside it’s the camaraderie that set this rivalry apart. There was the fight, but there was more, united by a feeling that was unique to this quartet of champions.“We were four of the best rivals, we pushed each other to the limits,” Nadal said. “When you are only two, you can lose a little bit of motivation because (maybe) the other starts losing or gets injured. But being four, always one of the four was winning. That didn’t allow us to relax or give us a break in terms of intensity, and determination to keep improving our game.”He added, “Within us we show (each other) the way, to be better and better. We achieved our dreams and because of this rivalry we raised the numbers of tennis history to the next level.”Nadal, the only one of the foursome in formal shoes, the other three wearing sports soles, expected his rivals to be present on Sunday, but he wasn’t sure if they would actually be there.The 22-time major winner, who has two less than Djokovic and two more than Federer, said his collection of 14 Coupe des Mousquetaires trophies would be tough to top.“If I did it, another one is going to achieve that too,” he said, “(But) a lot of things need to go in your favor, you need a long career, you can't have a lot of injuries, even if I had. I only retired here once in 2016, but you can have injuries, you can also have very, very bad days, so you need some luck, too.”The Spanish superstar was asked if he would encourage his two-year-old son Rafael Nadal Junior to become a professional sportsman given the road, and the sacrifices the journey entailed.“You mentioned sacrifices, the things that you lost to become a professional (athlete), I never had that feeling, that I made a lot of sacrifices. I never thought I had lost a part of my life to become professional,” he said. “I was not able to do all the things my friends were doing every weekend, but I was able to do all the things, and I did it. At the same time, when you are doing what you want to do, you are not making sacrifices. ”Nadal underlined that if his son approached sport with a similar attitude, he would support him.Nadal knew that a couple of surprises had been planned for the ceremony, but he didn’t know what exactly they would be. When a bit of the dirt was cleared later in the evening, revealing Nadal’s footprint, tears flowed down his face.“Knowing that it’s going to be there forever is a present I can't describe in words,” he said. “Very, very emotional to have this spot on the most important court of my tennis career. Very, very special.”That was the kind of champion Rafael Nadal was. All that he won is in the numbers, the mettle of the man resonates in his footprint.","Rafael Nadal was honoured at a ceremony at Roland Garros on Sunday night. The 14-time grand slam champion was joined by his three greatest rivals. Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray were all present. Nadal said the camaraderie was what set them apart.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121427215,imgsize-149782,width-400,resizemode-4/121427215.jpg"

'We manifested and then we worked hard': Shashank Singh after Punjab Kings seal top-two finish

'They outplayed us tonight': Ryan Rickelton admits as MI face Eliminator test

JAIPUR: Shreyas Iyer provided the finishing touches while opener Priyansh Arya (62 off 35 balls; 9x4, 2x6) and No. 3 Jos Inglis (73 off 42 balls; 9x4, 3x6) backed up a fine bowling effort as Punjab Kings (PBKS) sealed a top-two spot by beating Mumbai Indians (MI) here on Monday.The seven-wicket victory ensured a place in Qualifier 1 for the Ricky Ponting-coached side, meaning they now get two opportunities to make the IPL final. The win put to shade a fine batting effort from Suryakumar Yadav earlier, which lifted MI to 184/7. PBKS completed the chase with nine balls to spare.Arya and Inglis’ sparkling knocks followed a fine bowling effort from the Punjab seamers as Marco Jansen, Arshdeep Singh and Vijaykumar Vyshak all got among the wickets. Vyashak was, however, smashed for 23 runs in his final over by Suryakumar and Naman Dhir.PBKS will now play the Qualifier 1 on May 29 in Mullanpur while Mumbai will play the Eliminator on May 30. While Inglis was at his scintillating best on Monday night, Arya gave the Australian good company as they partnered for 109 runs to tilt the match Punjab’s way. No doubt, the strategic investment in uncapped players is now paying off for Punjab.Arya and Inglis’ calculated aggression dismantled a bowling attack that boasts names like Jasprit Bumrah, Mitchell Santner and Trent Boult. After Arya’s dismissal off Santner, Iyer (26 not out off 16) clubbed with Inglis to ensue PBKS cruised to the target.Earlier, Suryakumar proved yet again why he is the backbone of the Mumbai Indians (MI) team, scoring a fighting 39-ball 57 (6x4, 2x6) to bring the team back on track after being put into bat by.Apart from Suryakumar, the visiting MI batters were largely sluggish and looked in discomfort against a disciplined PBKS bowling lineup. Suryakumar also broke Sachin Tendulkar’s record to become the highest run scorer for MI in a single season.PBKS, playing at their third home base this season here at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium, were largely impressive on the field. Coming into the match after a six-wicket defeat against Delhi Capitals on Saturday, the Iyerled side showed resilience and skill.Arshdeep (2/28) and Jansen (2/34) shared four wickets between them, including the dismissals of Hardik Pandya and Suryakumar. MI’s scoring rate, incidentally, dipped below nine between overs 6-15 before Suryakumar injected some life to the innings.He stitched small partnerships with Rohit Sharma (36) and Hardik Pandya (44 runs). In the penultimate over, Suryakumar and Naman Dhir pressed the accelerator, slamming 23 runs off Vijaykumar Vyshak, who until then was having a good day.Arshdeep, delivering tight lines and generating pressure with his movement, leaked only three runs in the final over of the innings that also included two wickets. Jansen struck just when the Surya-Hardik collaboration was starting to look threatening. The pacer dismissed Hardik (26 off 15 balls) with a length ball, inducing a thick outside edge. Pandya, trying to slash it, was caught by Josh Inglis. It was a key wicket for Punjab in the 17th over.",Punjab Kings beat Mumbai Indians by seven wickets to seal top-two spot. Ricky Ponting-coached side now get two opportunities to make the IPL final. Priyansh Arya and Josh Inglis top-scored for Punjab Kings with 109 runs.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121427126,imgsize-113190,width-400,resizemode-4/121427126.jpg"

Hangtime refers to the duration a player can remain suspended in the air while taking a dunk or a shot, scoring points for their team.After an impressive victory in Game 3 over the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Minnesota Timberwolves faced another disappointing loss in Game 4, with the final score being 128-126. The Thunder increases their lead with a conference final standing of 3-1. This makes the circumstances difficult for the Wolves to secure a spot in the finals with just 4 games remaining.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach. It became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118066912,imgsize-31572,width-400,resizemode-4/118066912.jpg"

'We manifested and then we worked hard': Shashank Singh after Punjab Kings seal top-two finish

Punjab Kings batter Shashank Singh said the team is not ""top of the world"" as qualifying for the playoffs is only half the job done. Shreyas Iyer 's deputy also revealed the captain's motivational dressing room talk.""No, not top of the world to be very honest,"" he told reporters after Punjab Kings' thumping seven-wicket win over Mumbai Indians at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur.""Because what we have believed, what we have manifested is still yet to come.""So, obviously, this is something where we really enjoy it because we really enjoy each other's success. If we would have not qualified for the top two, we still would have been happy that we have qualified. But again, it's half the job done.""The full job will be done on the 3rd of June, I guess. When, late at night, 12 o'clock, we'll have a press conference. That will be the time I'll tell you that, yes, we are at the top of the world,"" he added.Shashank also touched upon what captain Shreyas Iyer said in the dressing room after Punjab Kings qualified for the knockouts after a gap of 11 years.""What Shreyas told in the last meeting is that qualification is half the job done, finishing top two is half the job done,"" he said.Punjab Kings will lose Marco Jansen in the playoffs, who will be leaving for national duty. But Shashank said they have enough match-winners in the team.""I mean, all good wishes to him. He is going for the World Test Championship (WTC). But then again, we have players to fill his boots,"" he said.""When you see all 14 league games we have played, every match has seen a new face, a new hero. So, someday, Shreyas has done well. Today, Josh and Priyansh.""Someday, Prabhsimran. Someday, Arshdeep. So, obviously, it's a combined team effort. When you finish in the top 2, the most important thing is that there isn't only 1 or 2 heroes. You have 11-12 heroes. Or if not 11-12, 6-7 heroes.""So, obviously, our team has 6-7 heroes. And hopefully, in the finals, we all can come together and win the title.""","Shashank Singh says Punjab Kings are not ""top of the world"" as qualifying for the playoffs is only half the job done. Punjab Kings beat Mumbai Indians by seven wickets in the Indian Premier League (IPL) match in Jaipur.
