BENGALURU: While Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) lit up Chinnaswamy Stadium with high-octane cricket action Saturday, drama of a different kind unfolded off the pitch - right inside the elite Diamond Box. The families of two high-ranking govt officials, one a senior IPS officer and the other an income tax commissioner, clashed over who was entitled to which seat!The clash of egos quickly spiralled into a full-blown showdown, turning the VIP box into a war zone of words and tempers. The duel escalated so dramatically that it spilled beyond the stadium and landed both parties at Cubbon Park police station, turning the cricket fever into a criminal case. The IPS officer's family charged the income tax commissioner's family with intimidation, sexual harassment and outraging modesty, which the latter has denied.""But what's more shocking is it all took place in the complimentary hospitality box even as several senior govt officials watched without intervening,"" a senior cop said. The incident happened when the IPS officer's daughter and son were at the seating area enjoying the game. ""The daughter stepped away to use the washroom, leaving her purse on the seat to indicate it was occupied. That is when a man came and occupied her seat. When the brother told him to vacate as his sister was all set to return, the man did not budge and an argument broke out between the two. Soon, the sister joined her brother while the man was joined by his wife, the income tax official, and their son. The argument intensified with each hurling abuse at the other. At one point, the confrontation between the IPS officer's daughter and the man almost went out of control as the man was arguing in her face,"" the cop elaborated.The brother-sister duo called their parents, who were watching the match at home on television. The IPS officer and his wife rushed towards the stadium, and worried about their children, called senior police officers in the city to intervene. With no help coming, the IPS officer's wife told her kids to move out of the stadium as she rushed to Cubbon Park police station and lodged a complaint. She accused the man ""of making unwelcome physical contact and intruding on her (daughter's) privacy with an intention to offend her"". She stated that visuals of the rowdy behaviour of the man was captured by her son on his mobile phone. She also pointed out that there were no cops on duty in the Diamond Box when the incident took place, between 9.40pm and 10.20pm.Based on her complaint, police registered a case against two unknown persons under BNS Sections 351 (criminal intimidation), 352 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 75 (sexual harassment which includes physical contact involving unwelcome overtures), and 79 (insulting a woman's modesty).After two hours, the man in question and his wife were summoned to the police station, and they were later allowed to leave. When contacted, the police brass chose not to comment and claimed necessary action would be taken after investigation. A police officer claimed helplessness, stating: ""One is a senior IPS officer and another is a senior income tax officer, we are in a spot.""","Families of two high-ranking govt officials clashed over who was entitled to which seat.

Shreyas Iyer's tactical call to promote Josh Inglis pays off: Ricky Ponting

During the 55th IPL 2025 league match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Delhi Capitals at Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Monday, a run-out incident involving Vipraj Nigam sparked animated reactions from SRH owner Kavya Maran , which have gone viral on social media.The dismissal occurred in the 13th over of DC's innings when a miscommunication between Nigam and Tristan Stubbs led to Nigam's run-out while attempting to take two runs. Nigam had scored 18 runs off 17 balls, including one four and one six.Maran's expressive reaction to the dismissal was captured on camera and quickly became a talking point on social media platforms, with multiple Twitter users sharing clips of her response.Before his dismissal, Nigam had formed a crucial 33-run partnership for the sixth wicket with Stubbs, helping Delhi Capitals recover from a precarious position of 29 for 5 in 7.1 overs.The incident gained significant attention as Star Sports, the official broadcaster, highlighted Maran's reaction with the caption: ""IPL Race 2 Playoffs got everyone excited: Kavya Maran's face says it all. Watch the LIVE action on Star Sports 1, Star Sports 1 Hindi & JioHotstar!""Sunrisers Hyderabad won the toss and opted to bowl first against Delhi Capitals, a decision that paid immediate dividends.

Only SRH’s own 24 for 4 against Mumbai Indians at the same venue ranks lower.

Jeff Teague says even Atlanta Hawks fans turned on him after his 2016 playoff shove on LeBron James,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/jeff-teague-says-even-atlanta-hawks-fans-turned-on-him-after-his-2016-playoff-shove-on-lebron-james/articleshow/120902497.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Jeff Teague reflects on fan backlash following 2016 playoff incident with LeBron James

In the 2016 NBA Playoffs , Atlanta Hawks ' point guard Jeff Teague gave a strong shove to LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers , knocking him into the stands during Game 3 of their Eastern Conference Semifinals. This move came from Teague's frustration over previous playoff losses, but he was surprised by the backlash he faced from both Cavs fans and his own Hawks crowd. Years later, Teague reflects on that moment and the surprising responses it generated.Recently on the Club 520 Podcast, Jeff Teague shared the memorable incident when he pushed LeBron James out of bounds during the final moments of Game 3 in the 2016 Eastern Conference Semifinals. The Hawks were about to face another playoff sweep by the Cavaliers, and Teague's frustration reached its peak. ""We was losing. Sh*t I'm a sore loser. I ain't win a playoff game against him ever. I was sick of this sh*t.... I got so much hate mail... that was my first time deleting Instagram"" Teague admitted. He added that seeing Atlanta fans cheer for LeBron in their home arena intensified his emotions, leading to the impulsive foul.Teague got a flagrant 1 foul for the shove, but it didn't stop there. He was flooded with hate mail, which led him to delete his Instagram for the first time. What really shocked him was how little support he got from Hawks fans. ""I thought the fans was gonna ride with me. I was like, 'Stand up, Hawks fans.' They were like, 'Nah, that's the King,'"" he recalled.Teague was really frustrated because the Hawks kept losing in the playoffs to LeBron's teams. In the 2014-15 season, Atlanta had an amazing 60 wins but got swept by the Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference Finals. The next year, they faced the same outcome in the semifinals. LeBron was on fire, averaging 30.3 points, 11.0 rebounds, and 9.3 assists per game in the 2015 series.Reflecting on those matchups, Teague acknowledged the challenge of facing LeBron at his peak. ""LeBron was just too dominant, man. Like, y'all, you can see him now from the USA game,"" Teague said. ""He's 40 years old now. He's still the most dominant player in the league. Ten years ago, we didn't have a chance. We ain't stand a chance for him, man. He's just too dominant, man, too dominant.""Also Read: “We getting a chance to see who can really hoop” — Dwyane Wade backs referees for letting physicality play out The push on LeBron James was frustrating, but it really showed how complicated fan loyalty can be and how tough it is to go up against one of the best players ever.","Jeff Teague pushed LeBron James out of bounds during the final moments of Game 3 in the 2016 Eastern Conference Semifinals.

What could have led to this dramatic downfall?The Browns organization is treading carefully, with a spokesperson confirming they are ""aware and gathering more info."" The team has remained tight-lipped on whether Bush will face immediate disciplinary action, but considering the gravity of the charges, a suspension or even a permanent exit from the team could be on the horizon.What makes this even more explosive is that Bush has history in the Pittsburgh area playing for the Steelers for several years meaning the city’s connection to the linebacker could add more fuel to the fire.Devin Bush now faces a preliminary hearing on May 20 in Allegheny County court.

Sherrone Moore’s suspension smells of strategic damage control,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/sherrone-moores-suspension-smells-of-strategic-damage-control/articleshow/120896927.cms,"Michigan sidelines coach Moore for two games amid controversy (Image via: Getty Images)

Why Sherrone Moore’s sudden suspension feels like a PR move

Postgame Interview: Michigan HC Sherrone Moore on UPSETTING Ohio State, postgame scuffle and more

Michigan’s controversy deepens ahead of NCAA decision



The University of Michigan isn’t just calling audibles on the field, it’s doing it behind closed doors, too. As college football braces for yet another controversy-filled season, the Wolverines have issued a self-imposed two-game suspension for head coach Sherrone Moore . But this move feels less like discipline and more like a calculated distraction. The timing, conveniently placed during low-risk matchups, raises eyebrows and signals that Michigan might be more concerned with optics than true accountability.Michigan announced it will suspend Moore for two games, not to start the season, but right in the softest part of their schedule. He’ll sit out Week 3 and Week 4 against Central Michigan and Nebraska, conveniently steering clear of any high-stakes matchups. He’ll be free to coach against Oklahoma and New Mexico, the latter being especially notable considering Moore's own playing history at Oklahoma. That’s not coincidence, that’s choreography.The reason behind the suspension is allegedly deleting a 52-message text chain with former staffer Connor Stalions , the central figure in a brewing sign-stealing scandal . The deletion reportedly took place the same day the scandal hit the headlines. If that doesn’t raise a red flag, nothing will.The move looks less like accountability and more like a smokescreen. Michigan’s athletic department isn’t denying wrongdoing, they're just hoping to control the narrative before the NCAA does. But this isn’t damage control; it’s damage delay.The silence from the NCAA so far is deafening, but it won’t last. They’re watching. And if Michigan thinks it can run the clock out on this investigation with a couple of sacrificial Saturdays, they may be in for a rude awakening.This is the same program that suspended Jim Harbaugh for three games last year while letting him coach practices like nothing ever happened. The playbook hasn’t changed, only the names have. Moore’s absence won’t change Michigan’s win-loss column much, but it says volumes about what the program values: appearance over integrity. While players chase trophies, leadership seems more focused on staying one step ahead of a scandal that’s catching up fast.Also Read: Inside NFL Draft-Day drama: Did Chargers play hardball with Eagles over Omarion Hampton? This isn't just about one assistant coach or a few deleted texts. It’s about a culture that seems increasingly willing to trade ethics for edge.

Gujarat Titans aim to recover from the blow dealt by young sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi when they face a struggling Sunrisers Hyderabad in an IPL match tonight (May 2).Suryavanshi stunned GT with his incredible performance, hitting the season’s fastest century in just 35 balls and becoming the youngest IPL centurion at only 14 years and 32 days old.Despite an eight-wicket loss — post a strong 209/4 score — the result hasn't altered GT's position in the league. The Titans remain one of the most consistent teams this season, boasting a balanced squad with strengths in both batting and bowling.Led by Shubman Gill, they sit comfortably with six wins out of nine matches (12 points). Just two more wins from their last five fixtures would secure a spot in the playoffs, reaching the 16-point threshold.GT's in-form top order gives them confidence, especially with standout Sai Sudharsan, who is second in the Orange Cap race with 456 runs and five fifties. Gill (389 runs) and Jos Buttler (406 runs) also rank among the season’s top batters, making a formidable trio despite recent challenges.Earlier this season, GT defeated SRH convincingly in Hyderabad by seven wickets, thanks largely to Mohammed Siraj's impressive 4/17 spell. They’ll be hoping for a similar performance this time.Meanwhile, SRH find themselves in a critical position, needing wins urgently. The runners-up last season have struggled — just three wins in nine matches — and sit ninth on the points table. Another loss could effectively eliminate their playoff hopes.While SRH have seen flashes of brilliance from openers Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head, consistency remains elusive for the team.The pitch at Narendra Modi Stadium favours the batters, which should benefit SRH. In five of the eight matches played at Motera, teams have scored over 200 runs, highlighting the batting-friendly conditions. Bowlers are likely to struggle, particularly in the second innings, as dew is expected to make an impact.Shubman Gill (C), Sai Sudharsan, Jos Buttler (WK), Sherfane Rutherford, Shahrukh Khan, Washington Sundar, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh KrishnaImpact sub: Karim Janat/Ishant SharmaTravis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen (WK), Aniket Verma, Kamindu Mendis, Pat Cummins (C), Harshal Patel, Simarjeet Singh, Zeeshan AnsariImpact sub: Mohammed ShamiGujarat Titans squad : Shubman Gill (Captain), Jos Buttler (wk), B Sai Sudharsan, Shahrukh Khan, Sherfane Rutherford, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, Mohammad Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Ishant Sharma, Washington Sundar, Glenn Phillips, Anuj Rawat, Mahipal Lomror, Arshad Khan, Jayant Yadav, Nishant Sindhu, Kulwant Khejroliya, Gerald Coetzee, Manav Suthar, Kumar Kushagra, Gurnoor Brar and Karim Janat.Sunrisers Hyderabad squad : Pat Cummins (c), Ishan Kishan (wk), Atharva Taide, Abhinav Manohar, Aniket Verma, Sachin Baby, Smaran Ravichandran, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Travis Head, Harshal Patel, Kamindu Mendis, Wiaan Mulder, Abhishek Sharma, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Mohammed Shami, Rahul Chahar, Simarjeet Singh, Zeeshan Ansari, Jaydev Unadkat, Eshan Malinga.In Ahmedabad on Friday, temperatures are expected to be quite hot, reaching up to 44°C during the day.

BENGALURU: While Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) lit up Chinnaswamy Stadium with high-octane cricket action Saturday, drama of a different kind unfolded off the pitch — right inside the elite Diamond Box. The families of two high-ranking govt officials, one a senior IPS officer and the other an income tax commissioner, clashed over who was entitled to which seat!The clash of egos quickly spiralled into a full-blown showdown, turning the VIP box into a war zone of words and tempers. The duel escalated so dramatically that it spilled beyond the stadium and landed both parties at Cubbon Park police station, turning the cricket fever into a criminal case. The IPS officer's family charged the income tax commissioner's family with intimidation, sexual harassment and outraging modesty, which the latter has denied.""But what's more shocking is it all took place in the complimentary hospitality box even as several senior govt officials watched without intervening,"" a senior cop said.The incident happened when the IPS officer's daughter and son were at the seating area enjoying the game. ""The daughter stepped away to use the washroom, leaving her purse on the seat to indicate it was occupied. That is when a man came and occupied her seat. When the brother told him to vacate as his sister was all set to return, the man did not budge and an argument broke out between the two. Soon, the sister joined her brother while the man was joined by his wife, the income tax official, and their son. The argument intensified with each hurling abuse at the other. At one point, the confrontation between the IPS officer's daughter and the man almost went out of control as the man was arguing in her face,"" the cop elaborated.The brother-sister duo called their parents, who were watching the match at home on television. The IPS officer and his wife rushed towards the stadium, and worried about their children, called senior police officers in the city to intervene. With no help coming, the IPS officer's wife told her kids to move out of the stadium as she rushed to Cubbon Park police station and lodged a complaint.She accused the man ""of making unwelcome physical contact and intruding on her (daughter's) privacy with an intention to offend her"". She stated that visuals of the rowdy behaviour of the man was captured by her son on his mobile phone. She also pointed out that there were no cops on duty in the Diamond Box when the incident took place, between 9.40pm and 10.20pm.Based on her complaint, police registered a case against two unknown persons under BNS Sections 351 (criminal intimidation), 352 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 75 (sexual harassment which includes physical contact involving unwelcome overtures), and 79 (insulting a woman's modesty).After two hours, the man in question and his wife were summoned to the police station, and they were later allowed to leave. When contacted, the police brass chose not to comment and claimed necessary action would be taken after investigation. A police officer claimed helplessness, stating: ""One is a senior IPS officer and another is a senior income tax officer, we are in a spot.""","A heated argument erupted in the Diamond Box at Chinnaswamy Stadium during the RCB-CSK match.

Vikram Solanki, GT director of cricket, was happy to have Rabada back in the fold as the team chases a playoff berth.""Kagiso will be available for the match,"" confirmed Solanki, before adding: ""Kagiso has expressed regret for an error in judgement. He is looking forward to getting back to playing the game he loves. He will take his lessons from this.

Met Gala 2025 SHOWSTOPPERS: Sabrina, Teyana, Sydney & Gigi DOMINATE The Red Carpet

Damson Idris channels F1 speed and Met Gala glam in eye-catching outfit switch



On a night known for fashion risks and unforgettable statements, Damson Idris claimed the crown for the most jaw-dropping moment of the 2025 Met Gala. With the theme ""Superfine: Tailoring Black Style"" setting the tone, the British actor didn't just walk the red carpet — he raced into the spotlight, delivering a theatrical, high-octane fashion reveal that has since been hailed as “the best reveal of the entire night.”Arriving like a Formula 1 champion, Damson Idris stepped onto the iconic Met steps in a fully suited APXGP racing outfit, a nod to his upcoming film F1 where he stars alongside Brad Pitt. But what truly sent shockwaves through the crowd and across social media was the transformation that followed. In one smooth motion, his glittering racing suit—complete with a helmet adorned with 20,000 Swarovski crystals—was ripped away to unveil a striking, custom-made Tommy Hilfiger tuxedo. The sharp, tailored rouge ensemble, patterned in classic Tommy Tartan plaid, not only honored the theme but also embodied the perfect blend of style and storytelling.Damson, 33, wasn’t just attending — he was making a statement, both as an actor and as a muse. “We’re excited to partner with the highly anticipated film, ‘F1,’” said Tommy Hilfiger. “Damson Idris stars as Joshua Pierce, a driver for the fictional APXGP team, and we wanted his Met Gala entrance to reflect the same cinematic energy.” And that it did — merging the speed of sport with the sophistication of fashion in a way rarely seen at the Met.The appearance also reunited Idris with seven-time F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton , co-chair of this year’s gala and a key producer of F1. “There’s no better person to teach you about F1 than Lewis Hamilton,” Idris shared during a candid moment at an IWC event. “They put me behind the wheel… but it’s unlike anything that we’re doing right now.”Hamilton, whose past Met Gala initiatives brought Black designers into the limelight, reflected on the honor of co-chairing: “We were in London, and [Anna Wintour] told me the theme. And I was so, so excited. And then she asked me to be the co-chair… I couldn’t believe it—I was like, ‘I’m gonna say no?’”With F1 hitting theaters on June 27, Damson Idris is racing ahead in both fashion and film. If his Met Gala reveal is any hint, audiences should expect nothing short of a thrilling ride.Also Read: Lewis Hamilton stuns at 2025 Met Gala with symbolic vintage jewels and cream-colored custom suit","Damson Idris dazzled at the 2025 Met Gala with a dramatic F1-themed reveal.

It was a disappointing weekend forafter he suffered the first loss of his pro MMA career. The middleweight fighter was on a 7-match winning streak until May 3, when his opponent,, handed him his first loss to the fighter. Nickal’s defeat met with severe criticism owing to the fighter’s previously made comment on his willingness to face Khamzat Chimaev . Many believed that the loss was necessary for the fighter to reevaluate his position within the division. However, Reinier seems to have a different take on the issue entirely, where he instead backs the fighter for his skills and abilities.In a recent interview with MMA Fighting, middleweight contender Reinier de Ridder talks about his previous bout against Bo Nickal. With an overall pro-MMA record of 20-2-0, Reinier currently rides on a 3-0 undefeated streak within the UFC . The fighter applauded Nickal for the skills and expertise he brings to the Octagon during his bouts. Reinier even expressed his desire to work with the fighter sometime in the future.When asked about the perceived Nickal’s arrogance ahead of the fight, Reinier stated, “I don’t feel he was that arrogant coming into this fight all, to be honest. He was very humble. From what I’ve seen, he was very down-to-earth coming into this fight.” The fighter further added on the next possible approach for Nickal in deciding his next bout, “It’s up to him to see if this can be a negative thing or a positive thing. He can make this into a positive thing. He can look at this as being a big lesson and something he’s going to grow [from] or he can look at this and say that it was a fluke and I just wasn’t myself that day and f*ck it.”Reinier believes that the past history of Nickal wouldn’t let him get weak and might even help him bounce back, “But I think if you see how far he’s already gotten in this game, how far he’s gone in wrestling, you can’t have a weak mindset. He’s a very strong guy. He’s a very strong individual, and I think he’s going to take some time off from planning a fight, and we’ll see him back in six months, and he’s going to tear through a lot of guys.”RDR seemed to be very confident about Nickal’s skill set which would develop over time and render him one of the toughest challengers in the division.“I’m just happy I got a chance to fight him now and not in three years. In three years, he’s going to be a f*cking killer. He’s going to run through everybody.”Fighters regarding their opponents is one of the most pleasant things to happen in the world of combat sports. Reinier was full of appreciation for his opponent and even backed him up at a time when Nickal was facing tons of criticism and trolls. Reinier expressed his willingness to train with the fighter despite being from different teams.“I would really like to work with this guy. Because of the skill set he brings, it would be awesome to train together.” Reinier brought up the issue of being from different things, “I don’t really know if me being a Kill Cliff guy now and him being American Top Team is going to work out, but maybe we can do it low-key and not tell anybody.”Also read: UFC 315 shakeup!

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Calling the game between Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and Rajasthan Royals (RR) at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on Sunday, former India skipper Sunil Gavaskar likened Rajasthan Royals’ captain Riyan Parag ’s bowling to a “mixed pakora — a bit of everything”. The quip to describe the “variety in his bowling”, aired on TV, came during Riyan’s tidy spell that yielded one for 21.But it was with the bat that the 23-year-old served a spicier dish, becoming the first in Indian Premier League history to smash six consecutive sixes .Little did Riyan know that enroute his 45-ball 95, he would also turn a two-year-old dream into a reality. Back in March 2023, a 21-year-old Riyan tweeted with youthful bravado, “My inner conscience says I’m hitting 4 sixes in an over at some point this IPL”.He not only fulfilled but surpassed that prophecy, etching his name in IPL history.Chasing a daunting 207, Royals were reeling at 102 for 5 in the 12th over. With pressure mounting, Riyan stepped up. Facing KKR’s seasoned spinner Moeen Ali in the 13th over, he unleashed a breathtaking assault. The second ball he faced soared over deep square leg, the next cleared long-on, and the fourth and fifth rocketed over square leg and long-on again. Moeen, desperate to disrupt Riyan’s rhythm, bowled a wide, but the reprieve was brief. Parag hammered the next delivery over long-off, completing five sixes in the over.In the next over, Shimron Hetmyer took a single, bringing Parag back on strike. With a cheeky reverse-sweep, he dispatched Varun Chakravarthy over backward point, sealing six sixes in a row. But despite his valiant effort, the Royals lost by one run.",Sunil Gavaskar likened Rajasthan Royals’ captain Riyan Parag ’s bowling to a “mixed pakora — a bit of everything’ The 23-year-old became the first in Indian Premier League history to smash six consecutive sixes.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120919202,imgsize-66330,width-400,resizemode-4/Riyan-Parag.jpg"

They ran constant interference until the referee tossed them out of the ringside area. Chad Gable then tried to interfere, but Penta took him out. He then turned his attention to JD McDonagh and delivered a Mexican Destroyer for the win.Originally, it was suppose to be Grayson Waller to wrestle, but he goaded Adam Pearce to let Austin Theory take the match. His opponent was revealed to be the returning Sheamus. The Celtic Warrior dominanted the contest despite Theory's best efforts and finished him off with a Brogue Kick to secure the pinfall.Becky Lynch came out to berate Bayley and then called out her Backlash opponent, Lyra Valkyria.

Following an heated exchange, Lynch tried to hit a cheap shot, but Valkyria countered leading to a brawl breaking out. WWE officials tried to break it up, but Valkyria ran to the ring and countered the Man Handle Slam into the Nightwing to win the match.It was one of the most captivating and compelling showdowns of the night as IYO Sky and Roxanne Perez tore down the house. The ending saw Perez avoiding the moonsault by SKY and tried to roll her up for the win, but SKY rolled her up and secured the pin. After the match, Giulia and Perez attacked IYO Sky and left her laying.It was a one-sided affair as Rusev dominated Otis in his first match since returning to WWE last week.

Rollins and Uso engaged in a huge back and forth contest that captivated the audience of Omaha. Towards the final moments, Bron Breakker tried to run interference, but Sami Zayn appeared to fight with him and Uso delivered a spear on Rollins. Breakker took him out leading to Jey Uso going to check on him. This allowed the Visionary to recover and deliver a Pedigree on Jey who also ate a spear from Bron outside the ring. As he was about to secure the pinfall, CM Punk made his shocking return with a chair and took out both Breakker and Rollins to end the show.Also read: Clarification: Alberto Del Rio WWE return highly unlikely, no official deal in place","The May 5th edition of WWE RAW took place at the CHI Health Center in Omaha, Nebraska.

LONDON: Over 30 years after Britain's elite Magic Circle expelled a woman for posing as a man to gain admittance, the formerly male-only society is to welcome her back as a full member.The London-based international magic organisation ejected Sophie Lloyd after she masqueraded as a male in 1991 to win membership.But after her story came to light last year, the society's first female chair Laura London launched a search to track down Lloyd and apologise.She was eventually located living abroad and will later on Thursday be presented with a membership certificate at a special ceremony at the organisation's London headquarters.""It is so exciting after all these months tracking Sophie... I can't tell you how happy we are as a society to welcome her back into the fold,"" London told BBC radio.Lloyd posed as Raymond Lloyd for 18 months before unmasking herself as a woman.But members, who voted to admit women in September 1991, were so angered by her ""deliberate deception"" that they went ahead with her expulsion.The deception was in fact a two-person act involving the late magician Jenny Winstanley, who recruited Lloyd to help her prove that women magicians were just as good as men.""I did a 20-minute show in front of 200 people, three examiners, and spoke to the examiner for an hour-and-three-quarters afterwards,"" Lloyd said, recalling how she managed to pull the wool over everyone's eyes.After the Magic Circle changed its stance on allowing women in, Winstanley, who died in 2004, phoned the society to explain.""Two days later we got a letter to say Raymond's been expelled,"" said Lloyd.""We couldn't get our heads round it. We just thought, 'come on it's funny, it's amusing' but they didn't think so and Jenny was completely snubbed, unfortunately.""After the expulsion, Lloyd continued to perform magic for 11 years in an anti-bullying variety show before eventually moving overseas.She said the Magic Circle had changed out of all recognition in the 30 years since she was thrown out, adding: ""This is for Jenny really, Jenny would have loved it.""London said Thursday's ceremony would also be a chance to recognise Winstanley both for her contribution to magic and her audacious trick at the Magic Circle's expense.""I just think she's a wonderful woman and I know she'd have loved to be here and I just wish more than anything I could have met her myself,"" she said.The Magic Circle was founded in 1905 by around 20 magicians at a restaurant in London's Chinatown district.Members must vow never to give away the secrets of magic.Although women have now been admitted to the Magic Circle for over 30 years, they still make up only around five percent of the society's 1,700 membership.The body says, however, that increasing numbers are now coming through in the 10-18-year-old age group.","Sophie Lloyd was expelled from the Magic Circle after posing as a man to gain admittance.

“All throughout the impugned advertisement, there is no (in)direct imputation/ insinuation/ comparison/ exaggeration/ sensationalism/ distortion of matters of fact of any kind by any of the defendants against the RCB trademark/ RCB cricket team,”

Why RCB filed a lawsuit against Uber Moto ad featuring SRH’s Travis Head



“The impugned advertisement is in the context of a game of cricket, a game of sportsmanship, which, in the opinion of this court, does not call for interference of any sort at this stage, especially while this court is considering the present application...More so, since in a case like the present one, interference by this court, at this stage, would tantamount to allowing the plaintiff to run on water with assurances of their not falling,”

“There can be no one-sided impression or one-sided version of the impugned advertisement, particularly, since what according to the plaintiff is 'right' can according to the defendants be 'wrong', and vice versa. The act(s) of disparagement cannot be concluded on the basis of the reviews/ comments/ statements made by few viewers/ followers as there are always two sides of a coin. In any event, the same cannot form or be the benchmark for determining the act of disparagement and/ or infringement... This is not a telltale,”

The Delhi High Court has ruled that an Uber Moto advertisement featuring IPL team Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) member Travis Head does not affect the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB). After dismissing a plea by RCB against the YouTube advertisement, the court reportedly noted that no prima facie case of disparagement or trademark infringement was established. It also said that the advertisement creates a general perception of healthy banter and lighthearted humour, the report claims.

Poll What do you think is the main reason for SRH's disappointing performance this season? Injuries to key players Challenging playing conditions Inconsistent batting

Sunrisers Hyderabad head coach Daniel Vettori addressed the team's disappointing IPL 2025 campaign following their washout against Delhi Capitals at Hyderabad on Monday. After starting as trailblazers with an aggressive batting approach, SRH managed only three wins in 11 games, with Vettori citing unexpected playing conditions and tricky surfaces as key factors in their performance.The conditions at Hyderabad's home ground proved challenging this season, with teams crossing the 200-run mark in only four out of 11 innings, compared to seven out of 12 times last year.""I definitely did not say after every match I was backing an aggressive approach. I said we are about assessing conditions and this year, the conditions weren't as we expected. If you look at last year, there were a lot of high-scoring games here,"" Vettori stated during the post-match press conference.""These surfaces in particular have been a little bit different. It has been tricky, it has not been easy for the batters. All we have talked about is assessing conditions, trying to read the game, and understand what to do in certain situations. I think the guys are innately aggressive, but certainly, this season has been about trying to establish what's been required on the day,"" he added.The coach elaborated on the varying nature of pitches this season, with two surfaces supporting high scores while others favoured fast bowlers.""There have been two surfaces that have been 250-plus, and there have been four here that have been probably more conducive for the fast bowlers. Not so much the spinners but the new ball has been a little bit sticky, hard to hit, not coming onto the bat. The IPL has some of the best new-ball bowlers in the world, and they were able to exploit those conditions,"" Vettori explained.SRH's playoff hopes were dashed after the washout against DC, where they had restricted the opposition to 133/7 before rain intervened.""Obviously, it is disappointing. We came in with high hopes, but we have not been consistent enough with our performances. I have spoken to you guys a number of times around just not being able to put complete performances together. Today was the start of a complete performance, so it is frustrating that we could not finish it, but that is cricket,"" Vettori commented.Captain Pat Cummins showed impressive form, taking 3/19 including a wicket on the first ball, removing Karun Nair. The decision to drop Mohammed Shami, who struggled with six wickets in nine games at an average of 56.16, was based on conditions.""It has obviously been a tough season so far for Shami. But he has been working exceptionally hard in the background. We just saw, particularly on this Hyderabad wicket, that is the best make-up of this team for us,"" Vettori said regarding Shami's exclusion.Praising Cummins' versatility, Vettori stated: ""If you look at his overall performance, he's been able to be a wicket-taker. He has bowled [in] a number of different roles for us. He has been able to mix and match depending on who has been selected in the team. Today, I think was the first [second] time he took the first over and you can see why he's such a dominant Test-match bowler when he gets the opportunity. Pleasing for him to be able to turn up today and bowl so well and lead the team exceptionally well. Hopefully, that carries onto the last three games of the season.""In the washed-out match, DC recovered from 29/5 through Tristan Stubbs (41- off 36 balls) and Ashutosh Sharma (41 off 26 balls) to post 133/7.The result left DC in fifth position with 13 points from six wins, four losses, and a no-result, while SRH remained eighth with seven points from three wins, seven losses, and a no-result.","Sunrisers Hyderabad have been eliminated from IPL 2025 playoff contention following their abandoned match against Delhi Capitals.

Poll Should the BCCI limit salaries for uncapped players? Not sure Only for certain players No, players should earn what they can Yes, to ensure fairness

NEW DELHI: Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has criticized the Board of Control for Cricket in India BCCI ) for altering its rules to accommodate MS Dhoni as an “uncapped player” ahead of the 2025 Indian Premier League (IPL) season. In his column in Sportstar, Gavaskar raised alarm over the soaring salaries of uncapped players, cautioning that such moves could damage the future of Indian cricket.The BCCI revived a rule — scrapped in 2021 — that allows an Indian player who hasn’t played international cricket in five years to be considered “uncapped.” This enabled Chennai Super Kings to retain Dhoni for Rs 4 crore under the uncapped player category.“To accommodate Mahendra Singh Dhoni , who became an uncapped player before the auction last year, the limit was raised to Rs 4 crore,” Gavaskar noted, calling the move a disappointing example of convenience over merit.He also questioned the value of splurging on untested talent. “A whole lot of the players bought for huge amounts simply fade away as their hunger and drive are satiated... Indian cricket takes a bit of a beating at the loss of any player whether he has been successful or not,” he wrote.“In all these years, it is hard to recall an uncapped player bought for huge numbers who has justified his inclusion in the team,” Gavaskar added, while noting that players often perform better once price and pressure drop.Gavaskar urged the BCCI to reverse the rule change and limit salaries for uncapped players to safeguard Indian cricket’s long-term interests.",The BCCI revived a rule that allows an Indian player who hasn’t played international cricket in five years to be considered “uncapped” This enabled Chennai Super Kings to retain Dhoni for Rs 4 crore under the uncapped player category.

Brief Scores

Delhi Capitals:

Persistent rain forced match officials to call off the match between Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Delhi Capitals (DC) at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Monday.SRH now have seven points from 11 matches and are out of contention for the playoffs, while DC moved to 13 points from 11 games and sit fifth on the table.The match was called off due to a wet outfield. The two captains shook hands as both teams shared a point each. SRH have been officially knocked out of the competition, becoming the third team after Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals to be eliminated from the playoffs race.Earlier, after being sent in to bat, DC suffered a top-order collapse but recovered to post a respectable score following a 66-run partnership in 45 balls between Tristan Stubbs (41 not out) and No. 8 Ashutosh Sharma (41) for the seventh wicket.DC were reduced to 29/5 in 7.1 overs after incisive spells from SRH skipper Pat Cummins (3/19) and Jaydev Unadkat (1/13).SRH captain Pat Cummins set the tone, bowling well on a wicket that assisted the pacers. He dismissed Karun Nair off the first ball of the innings, then Faf du Plessis, and finally Abhishek Porel, putting DC under significant pressure.Axar Patel and KL Rahul tried to break free but couldn't establish a strong partnership. Vipraj Nigam had a brief stay before he was run out after a significant misunderstanding between the wickets with Tristan Stubbs.Then Stubbs was joined by impact substitute Ashutosh Sharma, who batted extremely well. Sharma scored a feisty 41 in quick time, which allowed DC to breach the 130-run mark.Stubbs tried to accelerate but struggled as the wicket wasn't the easiest to play shots on.SRH needed 134 runs to win the match, but not a single ball was bowled in their innings as it started pouring down during the innings break.133/7 in 20 overs (Ashutosh Sharma 41, Tristan Stubbs 41 not out; Pat Cummins 3/19, Jaydev Unadkat 1/13) vs Sunrisers Hyderabad","Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Delhi Capitals match abandoned due to rain.

Poll Is dual responsibility affecting Rishabh Pant's captaincy? It's hard to tell No, he can handle both Yes, it seems overwhelming

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 4: Prof. Ratnakar Shetty on BCCI, cricket politics & Indian cricket's growth

NEW DELHI: With Rishabh Pant enduring a torrid IPL 2025 season, former Australia captain Aaron Finch has suggested a bold change: the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) skipper should hand over wicketkeeping duties to Nicholas Pooran to improve on-field communication and regain clarity in leadership.Pant’s struggles continued in LSG’s 37-run loss to Punjab Kings , where he scored a sluggish 18 off 17 in a daunting 237-run chase. With just 128 runs from 10 innings at a strike rate of 99.22, this marks his worst IPL showing since his debut in 2016.Speaking on Jiostar, Finch highlighted how the dual role of captain and keeper could be hampering Pant’s effectiveness. “It must be really difficult to captain a side when you're the wicketkeeper. You probably get a couple of seconds to talk to your bowler between overs, and with the stop-clock rule, that time is minimal,” Finch explained.He added that Pooran often acts as the communication bridge between Pant and the bowlers but emphasised that indirect messaging can disrupt strategy execution. “That can be really difficult — the bowler's plan might change ball to ball, and so might Rishabh’s. You can see how animated and frustrated he is when things don’t go to plan.”Finch advised Pant to step out of the gloves temporarily: “Maybe it’s time he says, ‘Pooran, you take the gloves. I need to get rhythm, manage plans better, and talk to my attack directly.’”He pointed out how captains like Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill maintain constant communication from inside the ring — something Pant might benefit from replicating.With LSG now in a must-win zone, leadership clarity could be vital in their playoff push.",Lucknow Super Giants skipper Rishabh Pant is enduring a torrid IPL season.

SRH vs DC IPL 2025, Hyderabad weather prediction

Delhi Capitals will aim to revive their playoff hopes and arrest a two-match losing streak at home when they face a struggling Sunrisers Hyderabad in a must-win IPL 2025 clash on Monday. Axar Patel’s side, currently fifth with 12 points from 10 games, have relied heavily on away wins but will need to find form in familiar conditions to stay in the top-four race.Axar, who bruised his left hand in the previous game against KKR but still smashed a valiant 43, remains a fitness concern. His full bowling involvement could be key, especially against an SRH side all but out of playoff contention after a 38-run loss to Gujarat Titans.While KL Rahul and Abhishek Porel have led DC's batting, their inability to accelerate at crucial moments has been costly. However, Mitchell Starc and Mukesh Kumar form a potent attack, with Axar's presence adding balance.SRH, despite big names like Pat Cummins, Mohammed Shami, Travis Head, and Heinrich Klaasen, have failed to click. Pacer Jaydev Unadkat pointed to inconsistent bowling and pitch conditions as major hurdles.With both teams desperate for points, the match promises high stakes and intensity at Arun Jaitley Stadium.A scorching day in Hyderabad, and the pitch is an absolute belter. Dry, hard, and full of runs, it promises a high-scoring contest with a par score expected around 220–230. The dimensions offer some imbalance — 63 meters to the right, 70 to the left, and 77 down the ground — giving batters plenty to target. While the surface heavily favours batters, both sides possess quality seamers who could make early inroads. The only grass lies behind the stumps, offering no real help to bowlers.
