"‘Journalism is first draft of history, Wikipedia second’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/journalism-is-first-draft-of-history-wikipedia-second/articleshow/128662426.cms,"For centuries, humanity has found itself caught between the promise of tomorrow and its perils when talking about the future. Socrates died a worried man because he thought writing will kill the quest for knowledge. It’s the same now with AI. How do you see this?

Broadly speaking, internet has made information a ‘commodity’. Do you think AI will make intelligence a commodity?

.

Wiki powered a huge number of Google search answers and is now emerging as a source layer for AI. Are LLMs both a threat and an opportunity to Wiki’s future?

■

You’re making the case really for human moderation of information.

Do you think that is where eventually the biggest problem with AI-curated information will lie, a wall that it cannot breach?

Like Google search in the past, AI companies have a frenemy relationship with news media — New York Times has sued OpenAI, for example. If AI systems increasingly cite original sources, should they be required to link back and share revenue or traffic?

.

How do we solve that?

Wikipedia has had this debate between deletionists and inclusionists. Which side are you on?

Tell us about your India community and volunteer group. There’s a perception or misperception, you tell us, that India pages are not as rigorous.

When people say, ‘Wikipedia is broken because it’s biased’, how do you react to that? And what’s your take on an AI-first competitor like Grokipedia?

How important is tone neutrality for credibility?

■

You launched WikiTribune to address neutrality in public discourse. Why did you not continue?

AI is fast changing the way information is created and shared, but speed and scale don’t necessarily mean credibility. Jimmy Wales , who co-founded Wikipedia — harnessing the wisdom of the crowd to upend traditional encyclopaedias like Britannica and become the internet’s default reference point — now finds it at the centre of a new debate on trust, including attacks from Elon Musk over alleged bias. Speaking to Rohit Saran and Saikat Dasgupta on the sidelines of the AI Impact Summit in Delhi, Wales reflects on the opportunities and risks AI presents, why neutrality is non-negotiable, and why trust is more important than ever■ John Philip Sousa (one of US’s most celebrated composers) believed people wouldn’t sing anymore when music began to be recorded. Chess, as a game, is more popular than ever before, even though the best chess player in the world is no longer human. It hasn’t stopped people from saying, ‘Oh, but we really enjoy playing chess!’ About AI, since the technology is so new, and so accessible, I don’t know. You ask a computer a question and it can answer, that’s incredible. But we also know it’s flawed. And then, there is this wild conjecture that it’s going to destroy all jobs, or no one will need to work anymore because we’re going to become vastly wealthy. Probably the answer, as ever, is somewhere in the middle.AI is obviously going to have a huge impact. What it will be is so hard to predict right now.■ All I can say is that right now, when we look at large language models — and I use them a lot, I’m a programmer, but not a very good one because I enjoy making things — it’s incredibly helpful and very fun. But it also makes things up and hallucinates. What I’m most interested in right now is, are there ways we can use this technology to support the community? Are there things that I can do pretty well? A lot of Wikipedia discussions are really long. You can get AI to summarise it. But here’s a key point, I want to read the original. It’s very useful. Another example would be you load up the Wikipedia article and all the sources and ask if there’s anything in the sources that should be on Wikipedia, but isn’t, or is there anything that’s not supported by sources. I did this and I think it is potentially useful for the community. Then say I want to write about a Bollywood movie that’s not globally famous in Wikipedia and I want to just get some basic facts about it. But I can’t read Hindi. Maybe the AI could help me a bit.We’re really about that human element, the human curated knowledge, the judgement. That machine translation might be a grammatical translation, but if you think about the cultural context of the reader, what they need to understand, what they are likely to know and what you need to explain to them, that goes beyond just the text. My example is, who’s the most famous cricket player? Today, it could be Virat Kohli in India. But if you’re writing for a global audience, you need to add a little text to explain who he is and put it in context. Machine translation can’t do that. But a human can.■ So, Gary Marcus is an AI researcher who has become known as kind of an AI sceptic, although I would say he’s not really an AI sceptic, but thinks that large language models have already hit a sort of wall — that we’re not seeing improvement on a lot of key issues like hallucinations. He thinks there needs to be some more fundamental breakthroughs. For some time, scaling seemed to make all the difference. But there are other experts of equal fame who disagree with them. Just watching that, I think, maybe we’re going to have a little bit of a break for a few years until there’s more breakthroughs where it’s like ‘okay, we’ve got this amazing tool but maybe we’re not that close to the next steps’.■ I think we’re going to have a big fight on copyrights. It’s going to be across legislatures and courts, rethinking how copyright law is structured. My concern is, we want to be careful about overreach. One of the classic principles of copyright law has always been that you can’t copyright facts. Some scientific publishers may be very excited to be able to say, you can’t use the facts unless you pay. And that’s a disaster. We don’t want to go there. That damages Wikipedia and our ability to say that on this date, this happened. Here’s the sources, and it’s five different newspapers. Also, newspapers don’t want to go there. One of the bigger, deeper issues is that local journalism has been wrecked. And that happened long before AI. For society, that’s a huge problem. I’m from Huntsville, Alabama, which is not a huge city, but it’s not tiny — 250,000 people. When I was a kid, I was a paper boy. I rode my bike and threw the papers (into houses). As a Wikipedian, the value of this is if I want to write about the history of Huntsville or the 1978 mayoral election, I’ve got a lot of good content to work with. But if I want to write about the most recent election? Very thin content. Because there’s just one afternoon paper now that’s published three times a week and from 100 miles away. And that means the first draft of history, which is journalism, isn’t being written. So, the second draft of history, which is Wikipedia, becomes much harder.■ I wish I had the answer to that. In some cases, maybe AI can help, if there’s some way to make it possible for one or two journalists to do more in a useful way that could be good. The changes in the information ecosystem have a lot of positives, obviously, but also some negatives. So go ahead and test.■ It has helped strengthen Wikipedia that we have this active, intellectual dialogue. I always say that I’m an eventualist, which is, we’ll probably get it wrong a lot but we’ll get it right eventually. The health of the Wikipedia community is important for us. Is the community having active discussions, having fun, behaving well? Are we doing things in a thoughtful way? I’m very comfortable with the debates as long as they don’t just become angry screaming matches.■ I find the Indian Wikipedia community to be very similar to everywhere in the world. A lot of nerds, not necessarily professionals in this field. There’s this guy in the global community with the nickname Hurricane Hank, who is a weather expert but not a professional meteorologist. The community has more men than women, unfortunately. That’s always something that we talk about. We want to improve that around the world. This is my third trip to India in a month and a half. On one of the trips, I was in Kerala, and I met with the local Wikipedia group. Among them was a couple, both Wikipedia editors, who brought their kids. On the second part of your question, I’ve not heard that about India pages. I do think it would be likely for the smaller language versions of Wikipedia. Obviously, those pages are typically going to be shorter and less filled in and less rigorous because there are fewer people doing it.■ See, Wikipedia is a source of knowledge, and sources are transparent things. One of the things that Elon (Musk) said is that Wikipedia just reflects mainstream propaganda. And I’m like, that’s really weird. Wikipedia reflects what reliable sources say. We cannot take one strange side, and say, ‘uh, we’re going to fight against all of scientific wisdom’, right? But we should reflect a debate if it’s a legitimate debate. Do we have biases? Well, of course, we’re human beings. So, we have to be really careful about that. Being neutral is one of the core values in the community. There’s no dispute about that. But do we always get it right? Maybe not. An old saying that I love is if you ask a fish about water, the fish will say, ‘What water?’ They live in it. They have no idea about it. And so oftentimes our biases are just there because we don’t know.Amartya Sen makes a comment in the introduction of his book, ‘10 Indians, 12 opinions’. That’s actually all humans — 10 humans, 12 opinions. Tone neutrality is very important for Wikipedia and for newspapers as well. I live in London and read two papers, Guardian and Telegraph. Guardian is a sort of centre left, Telegraph centre right. Both quality newspapers. I have an electric car, not a Tesla. I love electric cars and so I read a lot about them. If you cut out the headlines from those two papers, I can probably filter the information 90% accurately, because Guardian loves electric cars and Telegraph hates them. But because of this tone, I also trust both of them less because it feels like they are both campaigning. That’s a problem because it can reduce trust, not just with people who disagree, but even with people who agree with the tone.■ Tribune was an experiment to see if there was a way for journalists and community members to collaborate. What journalists can do, like you have come here in the middle of Delhi to chat with me, or go and report on something, or attend a press conference, or talk to a politician, that’s almost impossible to do as a volunteer. So, we explored some good collaborations. And then we would look at traffic stats every day. We had one story that had a really clickbait headline that I didn’t like. To make this into a commercial success, we needed more clickbait headlines. I didn’t want to do that. That’s how I realised the problem is not with journalism but that model, the broader ecosystem. The newspapers always love a good, juicy headline. There’s nothing wrong with that. But if algorithms are feeding people content to keep them around as long as possible, then that encourages more of the same kind of behaviour and so on. So it kind of changed my focus and was like, ok, good experiment.","Jimmy Wales co-founded Wikipedia, the internet’s default reference point.

Why Congress can’t afford friction in Puducherry

Puducherry, the Union territory nestled within Tamil Nadu, will head to the polls in April alongside the state. But a growing rift between the Congress and its ally, the DMK — which governs Tamil Nadu on its own despite their alliance — now threatens to spill into Puducherry just months before the crucial assembly elections.At the heart of the conflict is the Congress’ demand for a share of power in Tamil Nadu if the DMK-led bloc wins again, along with a larger number of seats to contest than in 2021. Puducherry, given its geographical and cultural closeness to Tamil Nadu, is also emerging as a stage for this simmering rift.Manickam Tagore, a close confidant of former Congress president and current Lok Sabha leader of opposition, Rahul Gandhi, has been at the forefront of the party’s push for greater “respect” from the DMK in Tamil Nadu. Now, he is extending that demand for “respect” in Puducherry as well.How practical is Tagore's demand? Can he — or the Congress — compel the DMK to concede? How likely is it that the DMK would give in? And with elections approaching, can the alliance afford internal strains? Let’s take a closer look.The politics in Puducherry, a former French colony, has been dominated by the Congress. Three other parties have also formed governments here—DMK, AIADMK, and the All India NR Congress—but none have ever enjoyed the level of dominance that the Congress did.That dominance is evident in the numbers: of Puducherry’s 10 chief ministers, seven have hailed from the Congress.The UT's lone Lok Sabha seat has also mirrored this political success. The constituency, also called Puducherry, has been contested in 15 general elections since 1967 and has been won by the grand old party — either directly or through its factions — 11 times.This legacy perhaps explains why the Congress sees Puducherry as politically significant. Given its long-standing dominance and the stakes of a potential defeat, the Congress would be keen to reclaim its supremacy here.Against the backdrop of political tensions in Tamil Nadu, the first signs of a possible spillover to Puducherry emerged on February 6. That day, Tagore posted on social media, citing electoral data to argue that the Congress — and not the DMK — should lead their alliance in Puducherry.“Will the party with 8% of the votes lead the coalition? No, the party with 26% of the votes will lead. Why should the Congress party be talked down to in the coalition?” he asked.The data he referred to was from the 2014 general elections. He did not explain why he chose figures from more than a decade ago, particularly from a parliamentary election rather than an assembly contest. In that election, the Congress finished second in the Puducherry Lok Sabha constituency, while the DMK came fourth. The Congress candidate, V Narayanasamy, who became chief minister two years later and held the post for over four years, secured 26.35% of the vote, whereas DMK’s AMH Nazeem received 8.19% and came fourth.A visit to Puducherry by the DMK’s election in-charge and Lok Sabha MP, S Jagathrakshakan, appears to have triggered the current episode. During the trip, he did not meet Congress leaders, and this “snub,” coupled with the ongoing friction in Tamil Nadu, seems to have sparked Tagore's outburst.But beyond the immediate provocation, the larger question is whether his assertion is merely rhetorical posturing or grounded in electoral reality.Despite Tagore’s assertive stance, the ground reality appears far less encouraging - if not outright alarming -for the Congress in Puducherry, where it was once the dominant political force. While the DMK remains the undisputed leader of the alliance in Tamil Nadu, the Congress now finds itself on comparatively weaker footing in Puducherry. Although it won the Puducherry seat in the two most recent general elections, its performance in the 2021 assembly polls was far less impressive. The Congress secured just two of the 14 seats it contested — a steep drop from the 15 it had won out of 21 during a successful campaign five years earlier.In contrast, the DMK, which contested 13 assembly constituencies under the seat-sharing arrangement, won six of them — securing the post of the leader of opposition in the assembly. The DMK, which is currently headed by Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin, had managed just two of the nine seats it contested in 2016.Tagore’s remarks could, therefore, be read either as election-season posturing or as a calculated attempt to pressure the DMK — in Puducherry or even in Tamil Nadu.The DMK remains a significant political player in Puducherry, while the Congress has been largely marginal in Tamil Nadu — last heading a government there in 1967 and last holding the leader of opposition post in 1996.The Dravidian major’s categorical refusal to share power in the southern state — a stance reiterated by Stalin himself — presents a major challenge for the Congress, leaving it to try and assert itself in Puducherry, where its historical influence still exists and where the party held power as recently as 2021.However, the Congress’ leverage — or lack thereof — in Tamil Nadu is already evident. The state Congress unit has urged the party’s national president, Mallikarjun Kharge, to take action against Tagore for his criticisms of the DMK, which itself has also called for action against the Virudhunagar MP.Whether the DMK exercises this leverage in Puducherry too or concedes ground to the Congress to maintain alliance cohesion ahead of the elections would shape not only the immediate electoral battle with the UT’s ruling NDA coalition, but also the longer-term balance of power between the two allies.With much at stake, the Congress can hardly risk tensions in Puducherry, especially on the eve of elections. With governments in only three states — Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, and Telangana — the Congress can ill afford fresh tensions within the alliance. A victory in Puducherry would provide a much-needed additional governing foothold and strengthen its hand within INDIA, the national opposition bloc it leads. Tensions within the opposition coalition have been simmering after a series of electoral setbacks following the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, in which they succeeded in reducing the BJP below the majority mark for the first time since 2014.For now, the Congress appears to be adopting a wait-and-watch approach. Whether this strategy bolsters its position or strains a key alliance ahead of the elections will soon be revealed.","Puducherry, the Union territory nestled within Tamil Nadu, will head to the polls in April alongside the state.

AR Rahman Admits Awards Once Weighed Him Down, Calls Reinvention More Important Than Legacy

NEW DELHI: Music composer A R Rahman on Friday agreed before Supreme Court to give credit to Ustad N Faiyazuddin Dagar and Ustad N Zahiruddin Dagar, popular as Junior Dagar Bandhu, in his song ‘Vera Raja Veera’ during the pendency of a suit by an heir of the Dagars accusing him of copyright infringement.Appearing for Rahman, senior advocate A M Singhvi told a three-judge bench led by CJI Surya Kant that the composer had always respected tradition and taken the spirit behind the court’s suggestion at the last hearing. Singhvi said Rahman would insert a new credit line for the song to be displayed every time it was played on OTT or online channels.The line reads: “Composition inspired by Dagarvani Tradition Dhrupad, first recorded as Shiva Stuti by Late Ustad N Faiyazuddin Dagar and Late Ustad N Zahiruddin Dagar”. Singhvi said the insertion would take four weeks to take effect on all mediums. The bench granted five weeks for the same.Delhi HC’s Justice Pratibha Singh had asked the credit line ‘Composition based on a Dagarvani Tradition Dhrupad’ be replaced with ‘Composition based on Shiva Stuti by Late Ustad Faiyazuddin Dagar and Late Ustad Zahiruddin Dagar’. This interim direction was set aside by an HC division bench on an appeal filed by Rahman.It was challenged in SC by Ustad Faiyaz Wasifuddin Dagar.A week back, the bench advised Rahman to acknowledge contributions of legendary Jr Dagar Bandhu’s contribution to the Dhrupad tradition of classical music.Ustad Faiyaz Wasifuddin Dagar had filed a suit seeking to bar Rahman from using ‘Shiva Stuti’ and said he still held copyright over the composition by his father and his uncle.Disposing of the appeal, the bench said all contentions of parties would be kept open during the trial of the suit pending before the HC single-judge bench and clarified it had expressed no opinion on the merits of any issue raised in the suit.",A R Rahman agrees before Supreme Court to give credit to Ustad N Faiyazuddin Dagar in his song ‘Vera Raja Veera’ Rahman will insert a new credit line for the song to be displayed every time it was played on OTT or online channels.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128636068,imgsize-373757,width-400,resizemode-4/article-46.jpg"
Scrap dealer returns gold junked during cleaning,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/scrap-dealer-returns-gold-junked-during-cleaning/articleshow/128636087.cms,"From scrap to rightful owner

GURGAON: Haji Akhtar Khan picked honesty over a windfall. And the Sharmas got their Diwali gift, six months late.Khan, a scrap dealer in Faridabad, returned to the family nearly 100 gram of gold jewellery worth about Rs 15 lakh that had been accidentally sold off with household trash before Diwali.The family of Ashok Sharma, an electrician, realised the ornaments had gone missing while preparing for Lakshmi puja in Oct last year. The jewellery, mostly bangles and earrings, were kept in a small box and placed inside a sack at home before the family left for Kumbh Mela in Jan. It was an effort to keep the valuables safe from theft. During routine pre-Diwali cleaning, however, the sack was mistakenly thrown out and sold as scrap.The trash went to Khan (60).Khan has been running a scrap business since 1992 on Agra Canal Road.Suspecting the baby had been inadvertently thrown out with the bathwater, Sharma visited Khan two to three times over the following months to inquire if he had found anything but returned empty handed.Recalling what had happened, Khan said Sharma had come to his shop about two months before Diwali to sell some scrap. “He came in his own vehicle during house cleaning and sold off the scrap,” Khan said.When the family came back roughly two months later, Khan said he did not store CCTV footage from his shop that old. “Had they approached within 20 to 30 days of the scrap being sold, we could have checked the cameras. By the time they approached us, we had deleted the footage,” he added.The turning point came earlier this week when Khan, while sifting through scrap at his shop, noticed a plastic packet. “Someone might have kept it there thinking it was brass. But I had my suspicion,” he said.Khan got the packet checked by a jeweller. “He confirmed it was gold — 22 carat — about 100 gram. I was sure it belonged to Sharma ji and no one else. So, it had to be returned. We earn through hard work and cannot keep someone else’s property. My family also agreed with me.” The scrap dealer took the jewellery to a police station to ensure a proper handover.","Ashok Sharma, an electrician, realised the ornaments had gone missing while preparing for Lakshmi puja in Oct last year.

The art of staying afloat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-art-of-staying-afloat/articleshow/128609349.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. That morning, I was still jet lagged; sleep had not yet chosen its continent. The phone rang. It was Priya—my schoolmate, gentle by temperament and scrupulous about never calling at unearthly hours. Her mother was once our beloved botany teacher, Miss Vathsala. I answered at once. Priya sounded relieved. “Amma was sobbing and very disturbed,” she said. “At her age, it is difficult to explain social media. She believes everything; thank you for picking up.” I was puzzled. Perhaps she had come across the news of a snowstorm. But then a series of calls began; polite voices, careful tones: ‘Are you alright?’ ‘We heard’, ‘We were worried’. Then Mallika Akka called from our ancestral village. As soon as she heard my voice, she burst out in relief, “Muruga! I will take paal kavadi for you!” Then anger rose. In a rolling Thirunelveli cadence she cursed the unseen wrongdoer; ‘may scorpions rain on his head’, ‘may his house be full of mud’. It landed like a thunderbolt. Somewhere, for the sake of YouTube video views, a malicious YouTuber had released a video announcing my death. He spoke about my various achievements and then went on to show photographs of various VIPs ‘visiting’ my house. The rest of the day was spent on reassurance—answering calls, calming relatives, explaining repeatedly that I was alright, lodging a cybercrime complaint. Suddenly I was in the same boat as the legendary Mark Twain. In 1897, a newspaper prematurely reported his death and even carried a moving account of his life. Twain responded with his immortal wit: “Reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.” That evening, I called Miss Vathsala again—this time understanding her distress of the previous day. She spoke softly, as though the world had grown harsher. “It must be a very tough life out there,” she said. “I don’t know how you manage.” I smiled. “Miss, you taught us how to.” She thought I was offering courtesy. But I meant it literally. “Every water flower does this,” I said. “It must keep itself above the water level or it will perish. The depth of the pond may rise or fall. But the flower adjusts the length of its stalk to the depth of the water; it’s a classic example of plasticity in plant morphology. The lesson she had once explained returned now as life’s algorithm. A lotus rooted in mud does not argue with the pond. It grows with just enough zeal to remain in light. Miss Vathsala fell silent for a moment, then laughed. Her subject had moved beyond the classroom and entered life. Botany, after all, was never only about plants. Centuries earlier, another keen observer of flora and fauna had observed the same truth. In Kural 595, Thiruvalluvar writes: Vellath Thanaya Malarneettam; Maandhartham Ullath Thanayadhu Uyarvu As the water flowers shoots up to the surface of water, Man is hoisted to the level of his zeal The depth of the water—like circumstances—lies beyond command. But the inward reach, the will to rise, determines whether we bloom or drown. That day’s false rumour was not mine to choose. But something else was – the decision to stay above the waterline of fear, to return by evening to equilibrium. Zeal is that silent struggle under water, not known or seen outside. Depths may increase; shadows may gather. Still, the flower remembers the sun—and because it remembers, it rises.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128611669,imgsize-40958,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/128611669.jpg"

The four of them constitute one of the most popular contemporary power couples in hockey.By the year 2026, Connor McDavid is projected to have an individual net worth of between 30 and 35 million dollars. In 2017, the Edmonton Oilers captain entered into a contract of eight years and payment of $100 million , which was one of the most lucrative contracts in the history of the NHL at the time. At an average of $12.5 million a year, it is evident that McDavid is one of the highest-paid players to play in the league in each new round on NHL.Besides his base salary and performance bonuses that make him earn more than 10 million annually, McDavid also makes a lot of money through endorsements. His alliances with several of the key lifestyle and sports brands are said to bring millions of dollars every year, which adds to a robust portfolio off the ice. His marketability is also enhanced during the playoffs or significant NHL match outcomes.Lauren Kyle McDavid has started a business career in the meantime. She started the high-end residential and commercial design firm Kyle and Co. Design, and she has also gotten into the hospitality business in Edmonton, where she has opened trendy restaurants and socializing spots that the locals have liked.Lauren's success on her own is a big part of the couple's overall wealth. The exact amount of her personal net worth is still a secret. But the industry thinks she adds a few million dollars to their joint financial status.In 2026, Connor McDavid and Lauren Kyle McDavid are thought to be worth between 35 and 42 million dollars. As long as McDavid stays in charge of the Edmonton Oilers and Lauren keeps making a name for herself in business, their finances will keep getting better, and the McDavids' off-ice empire is growing at the same rate as his on-ice career.","Connor McDavid and his wife Lauren Kyle McDavid are one of the most popular contemporary power couples in hockey.

Out



Right Knee - Injury Management; Right Shin - Soreness





Thewhen they play the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday,. The team has ruled him out due to right knee management and soreness in his right shin.This is his fourth straight missed game. He sat out the final few games before the All-Star break and has not returned yet. The team is being cautious, but there is still no clear timeline for when he will be back.Joel Embiid is officially listed as out with right knee injury management and right shin soreness.He has played 31 games this season and is averaging 26 points, 7 rebounds, 3.9 assists, and 1.1 blocks. His absence has affected the team’s results. The Sixers are 1-6 in games he has missed since the start of 2026.Philadelphia comes into this game with a 30-25 record and is currently sixth in the Eastern Conference. They have lost three games in a row. Without Embiid, the team has struggled on both ends, especially inside.Nick Nurse has adjusted the rotation to deal with Embiid’s absence. Paul George has taken on a bigger role in the frontcourt along with Trendon Watford, Dalen Terry, and Andre Drummond.Johni Broome and Adem Bona are also getting minutes at center.Tyrese Maxey is leading the backcourt, with support from VJ Edgecombe, Cameron Payne, and Quentin Grimes. The guards are handling more of the scoring and playmaking.Without a strong presence in the paint, the team has had trouble protecting the rim and controlling rebounds.New Orleans has a 15-42 record but still has players who can take advantage of this matchup.Zion Williamson and Dejounte Murray lead the offense. Jordan Poole, Trey Murphy III, and Yves Missi are also part of the rotation.With Embiid out, the Pelicans are likely to attack inside. Williamson’s drives and Murray’s pick-and-roll play will test the Sixers’ defense.Maxey’s role becomes more important without Embiid. He needs to score and create chances for others.The Sixers may continue with smaller lineups, using George at power forward and rotating centers like Drummond or Broome. This helps spacing but can hurt them defensively.Rebounding and transition defense will matter. The team needs to limit second chances and fast breaks.Also read: Philadelphia 76ers vs New Orleans Pelicans injury report: Who's playing, injured and questionable players, head-to-head records, team stats, and more (February 21, 2026) There are no other major injuries for Philadelphia.

The contest could hinge on how effectively New Zealand’s middle order handles the craft and variation of Pakistan’s spin attack when the two teams meet in the opening Super Eight Group 2 clash of the T20 World Cup on Saturday.So far in the tournament, the Kiwi batting unit has not quite found top gear. Openers Tim Seifert and Finn Allen have led the charge with three half-centuries between them, but the middle order has struggled to provide consistent support. Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Mark Chapman and Daryl Mitchell have all shown flashes without stringing together impactful contributions.Phillips and Ravindra have registered a fifty each, yet their overall returns remain modest. Ravindra, for instance, has scored 72 runs in four outings, with 59 of those coming in a single innings against Canada. Adding to their challenge is the fact that this will be New Zealand’s first match in Colombo in this edition of the tournament.Pakistan, in contrast, have been based in the Sri Lankan port city since the start of the World Cup and have already featured in two matches at the Premadasa. Their bowlers — especially the spinners — understand the tempo and lengths required on a slow surface where patience often trumps aggression.For New Zealand, it will be crucial that the middle order complements the Powerplay thrust provided by Allen and Seifert. A measured approach will be needed to either post or chase a total in the region of 180 on a pitch that demands calculated strokeplay.Pakistan’s spin arsenal — Usman Tariq, Abrar Ahmed, Saim Ayub, Mohammad Nawaz and Shadab Khan — gives them a clear advantage. However, they have their own concerns with the bat. Shadab, with 88 runs, is their second-highest scorer behind Sahibzada Farhan (220), the tournament’s leading run-getter.Against a seasoned New Zealand outfit, Pakistan will require a stronger collective effort from their batting unit. The biggest concern for the team management remains Babar Azam, who has managed just 66 runs in four matches at a strike rate of 115.78. The former captain has struggled to adapt to the tempo demanded by modern T20 cricket.Another failure could prompt Pakistan to consider Fakhar Zaman, who has yet to feature in the tournament. They are also weighing up the option of recalling left-arm pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi, omitted for the must-win fixture against Namibia.Afridi has claimed three wickets in three matches but at a costly economy rate of 11.22, underlining his difficulty in adjusting to slower conditions. His struggles serve as a warning for New Zealand’s pace-heavy attack.Lockie Ferguson, Matt Henry, Jacob Duffy and James Neesham have all been somewhat expensive and may need to rethink their approach. Greater reliance on variations — knuckle balls, slower bouncers and leg cutters — could be key to unsettling Pakistan’s batters and easing the burden on the spin trio of Mitchell Santner, Ish Sodhi, along with part-time options Ravindra and Phillips.Total matches: 49Pakistan won: 24New Zealand won: 23No Result: 2Pakistan: W, W, W, L, WNew Zealand : L:, W, W, L, WTotal matches: 51No result: 1Most wins by teamIndia – 12 winsSri Lanka – 10 winsAustralia – 7 winsPakistan – 6 winsSouth Africa – 5 winsBangladesh – 5 winsZimbabwe – 3 winsWest Indies – 3 winsNew Zealand – 3 winsEngland – 2 winsBeyond the on-field rivalry, the weather in Colombo threatens to have a major say in the outcome.

Showers are likely in the opening half of the evening, with temperatures ranging between 24 and 26 degrees Celsius and humidity levels climbing past 80 per cent.There is no reserve day allocated for this Super 8 encounter. Should persistent rain force an abandonment, the teams will split points — a result that could significantly hurt their chances of progressing to the semi-finals.Match officials will have an extra 90 minutes at their disposal in an effort to produce a result.

Pakistan vs New Zealand Super 8s weather report: What happens if PAK-NZ gets called off?



Pakistan will lock horns with New Zealand in their first Super 8 clash of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Saturday. With a storied rivalry and plenty at stake, the contest promises to be a high-intensity encounter between two evenly matched sides.This will be the 50th T20I meeting between Pakistan and New Zealand, underlining how closely contested this rivalry has been in the shortest format. Of the 49 matches played so far, Pakistan have won 24, New Zealand 23, while two games ended in ties — a near-perfect split that highlights the fine margins between the teams.Since January 2022 alone, the two sides have faced each other 24 times in T20Is. New Zealand hold a slight edge with 13 wins compared to Pakistan’s nine. However, Pakistan fans draw confidence from their memorable victory in the 2022 T20 World Cup semi-final, where they defeated the Black Caps to book a place in the final.New Zealand and Pakistan last played a T20 match in March last year, when New Zealand hosted the 2009 T20 World Cup champions for a three-match series, which the home side won 2-1.Performance of both teams in their last 5 matchesIn this edition, both teams have blown hot and cold. Pakistan suffered a setback against India in the group stage, while New Zealand went down to South Africa.As a result, both finished second in their respective groups and now find themselves in a challenging Super 8 group that also includes England and Sri Lanka.Form-wise, Pakistan come into the game with three wins in their last five matches (W, W, W, L, W), while New Zealand’s recent run reads L, W, W, L, W — again reflecting how evenly matched the sides are.While the cricketing rivalry adds spice, the weather in Colombo could play a decisive role. Rain is forecast before and during the match, which is scheduled to begin at 7 PM local time. Showers are expected during the first half, with temperatures hovering between 24 and 26 degrees Celsius and humidity above 80 per cent.There is no reserve day for this Super 8 fixture. If the match is abandoned due to rain, both teams will share one point each — a scenario that could severely dent their semi-final hopes.Officials will have an additional 90 minutes on the day to try and force a result, but if even a five-over contest isn’t possible, the game will be called off.","Pakistan face New Zealand in their first Super 8 clash of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Saturday.

The journey of America’s top-ranked player

Taylor Fritz is trending, but not just because of a win. This time, the conversation around him is about how much tennis he is playing and whether his body can keep up. Former WTA Tour player Coco Vandeweghe recently questioned his heavy schedule despite his injury struggles, and that has added fuel to the discussion among fans. Fritz is currently competing at the Delray Beach Open, where he is the top seed and a two-time defending champion. Playing at home always brings extra attention, and he moved into the quarter-finals after a 7-6(4), 6-4 win over Rafael Jodar. But recent weeks have been physically demanding. At the Dallas Open, he had three championship points before losing the final to Ben Shelton. Earlier, at the Australian Open, he exited in the fourth round against Lorenzo Musetti, and there were visible concerns about his movement and fitness.To understand why this matters, one needs to look at who Taylor Fritz is. Born on October 28, 1997, in Rancho Santa Fe, California, he grew up around tennis. His father, Guy Fritz, played professionally and later became a coach. His mother, Kathy May, was ranked in the world’s top 10 in the late 1970s. Tennis was not something he picked up later in life - it was part of his world from the start.He turned professional in 2015 and quickly showed he belonged.In 2016, he reached the Memphis Open final in just his third ATP event. The moment that changed things for him came in 2022, when he defeated Rafael Nadal to win the Indian Wells Masters. The win pushed him into a new category. Today, Fritz is ranked inside the world’s top 10 and is the highest-ranked American singles player. He has become one of the steady names on the ATP Tour and a regular for the US Davis Cup team.Still, the physical side of the sport has tested him. He had meniscus surgery in 2021 and has dealt with knee and oblique issues since. Despite those signs, Fritz has made it clear that he intends to play through manageable pain. Speaking about his knee issue, he said, “It’s not something that gets better with a lot of stentinitis.” He added, “You need to just work through it. So I trust my physio, and we think the knee can get better while I’m still playing tournaments if it’s something I can play through. ”","Top-ranked American tennis star trending after injury and fitness concerns.

How Jakub Menšík built his rising tennis fortune



One big night can change how a career feels. For Jakub Menšík, Doha was that night. At the 2026 Qatar Open in Doha on February 19, the 19-year-old Czech delivered the biggest result of his career by defeating the world No. 2, Jannik Sinner, in the quarterfinals. He came through a tight three-set match, winning 7-6(3), 2-6, 6-3 after more than two hours on court. It was a composed and confident performance against one of the most consistent players in men’s tennis, and it sent Menšík into the semifinals with some serious momentum. He served boldly, swung freely and trusted his power when the pressure tightened.A win like that changes things. It gives a young player a lot of confidence. Opponents start taking him seriously. Fans stop calling him “one for the future.” And whenever a teenager breaks through like that, curiosity naturally turns to the bigger picture, which includes what it means financially. Let's take a look at his net worth.According to his official ATP Tour profile, Menšík has earned approximately $5.28 million in career prize money so far. For someone who is still only 19, that’s a whopping number.It reflects steady progression, consistent tour-level results and the ability to compete deep into events. But prize money figures can be misleading. The $5.28 million listed on the ATP site is gross income. Professional tennis players pay their own way. Coaches, physios and fitness trainers are not optional at this level but essential. Travel is constant and international. Hotels, flights and tournament expenses stack up quickly. Add management commissions and taxes across multiple countries, and the headline figure shrinks fast.Once those deductions are factored in, industry estimates suggest Menšík’s 2026 net worth likely falls somewhere between $1.5 million and $3.5 million. That range is typical for a rising ATP player who is earning well but still investing heavily in building a long-term career.Commercially, he’s still early in his journey. He doesn’t yet have the blockbuster endorsement deals that established top-10 stars command. However, statement wins dramatically increase visibility. Brands are drawn to youth, momentum and upside and a fearless teenager who just beat one of the sport’s most consistent players checks all three boxes.Right now, Menšík’s finances reflect a player climbing rather than one who has fully arrived. If performances like Doha become regular instead of rare, both his ranking and his earning power could rise very quickly.","Jakub Menšík beat world No. 2 Jannik Sinner 7-6(3), 2-6, 6-3 in the quarterfinals of the 2026 Qatar Open in Doha on February 19.

Tommaso Giacomel’s Olympic heartbreak as Johannes Dale-Skjevdal wins gold

Tommaso Giacomel looked ready for a medal. Then, in a shocking turn, he was sitting in the snow. The 22-year-old Italian biathlon star shocked fans after collapsing during the men’s 15km mass start at the 2026 Winter Olympics. The worrying moment happened in Anterselva during the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics. Tommaso Giacomel was in strong form and even led the race at the halfway mark.

Other athletes passed him. Soon after, television cameras showed him sitting on the ground in the woods section of the course. His ski poles were beside him. Officials rushed to check on him.According to Eurosport, commentators described it as a “Cursed Olympics” for Giacomel and reported that he appeared to struggle with his breathing. He did not finish the race. In fact, he was the only one among the 30 competitors who did not cross the finish line. More than an hour later, Italy coach Fabio Cianciana gave an update. He said, “Health comes before the races.If Tommy felt some pain in the ribs, it is right that he has stopped. ” He added, “After one minute, he already felt better. He went on his legs for the first medical check. Now he is doing other treatments and he is fine.”Cianciana also spoke about how well Giacomel was performing before the incident. He said, “The race was going very well. Once he passed unharmed from the prone shooting, we knew that Tommaso would have been very dangerous on the standing shooting.”While Giacomel’s race ended in pain, the competition continued. Johannes Dale-Skjevdal of Norway won gold with a perfect performance. He hit all 20 of his shots. His teammate Sturla Holm Laegreid took silver and finished the Games with a medal in each of the five races he entered.For Giacomel, this was his sixth event of the Olympics. He had already raced in the individual, sprint, pursuit, mass start, and team relay. He also won a silver medal in the mixed relay, which means he will not leave the Games without success.Still, the scene in Anterselva left fans concerned.

United WE Announces Brittany Mahomes as First Champion for Change Winner



""at the decision-making table,""

In Kansas City, the Mahomes name is synonymous with winning but while Patrick is busy leading the Chiefs and recovering from his injury, Brittany Mahomes is carving out a legacy that is arguably just as historic. On February 19, 2026, it was officially announced that Brittany has been named the inaugural recipient of the Champion for Change Award by United WE.The honor isn't just a ""thank you"" for being a local celebrity, it’s a recognition of the serious economic and cultural shift Brittany has spearheaded in Missouri and beyond.The primary reason for the award is Brittany’s visionary leadership in women’s professional sports. As a co-owner of the KC Current, she didn't just buy into a team, she invested in an entire ecosystem. She was a driving force behind the construction of CPKC Stadium, which made global headlines for being the first stadium on Earth built specifically for a women’s professional team.United WE noted that her leadership proves that when women arethe entire economy grows stronger. By treating women’s sports as a ""growing economic engine"" rather than a side project, she has changed the blueprint for sports ownership in America.Beyond the soccer pitch, the award highlights her philanthropic work. Alongside her husband, Patrick Mahomes , Brittany has channeled millions through the 15 and the Mahomies Foundation. These funds have gone directly into underserved communities, focusing on children's health, wellness, and educational opportunities.The organization emphasized that Brittany’s role as an entrepreneur, investor, and mother of three makes her the perfect face for this new award. She represents a generation of women who aren't just participating in the conversation, they are leading it.Randi Mahomes celebrated this achievement of her daughter-in-law on her Instagram story, sharing her excitement and publicly showing support for Brittany’s special milestone.The award will be presented on May 6, 2026, during a milestone event at CPKC Stadium.

Mens Hockey Olympics : Sidney Crosby ruled out as Canada faces Finland after both teams win dramatic overtime quarterfinals

Winter Olympics fans woke up early on Friday ready to watch one of the biggest games of the 2026 Milano Cortina Games. But many were shocked when they could not see the start of the Canada vs Finland men’s hockey semifinal on regular TV. The game began at 10:40 a.m. Eastern Time. Instead of airing live on cable, the opening part of the matchup was available only on Peacock. USA Network, which is owned by NBCUniversal, showed the women’s speed skating 1500m during that time. NBC later scheduled delayed coverage of the hockey game at 11:50 a.m. ET on USA Network.Fans quickly shared their anger online. Many said they felt frustrated that such a major semifinal was not shown live on television. The matchup featured top-seeded Canada and defending 2022 Olympic champion Finland, making the decision even more surprising for viewers across the United States.The semifinal was already a huge story before the broadcast issue. Canada entered the game as the No. 1 seed, while Finland came in as the defending gold medalist from the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.Both teams fought hard in the quarterfinals earlier in the week.Finland edged Switzerland 3-2 in overtime. Canada also needed extra time to beat Czechia 4-3. Those close wins set up what many believed would be one of the best hockey games of the tournament.However, Canada had to prepare without its captain, Sidney Crosby. The veteran forward suffered a lower-body injury during Wednesday’s quarterfinal and was ruled out of the semifinal. His absence was another major talking point heading into Friday’s game.Still, much of the online reaction focused on the broadcast choice. Fans took to X to express how they felt.One fan wrote, “Not having this Canada-Finland hockey game on a dedicated tv channel is infuriating to me.”Another posted, “Absolutely wild the Canada Finland semi final game isn’t on tv right now.”A different viewer added, “Why is my USA channel playing speed skating??? All your stars yet I have to have peacock to watch???”One more comment read, “Everywhere I look, I see that USA Network is supposed to be broadcasting the CAN/FIN hockey semifinal. Yet — they aren’t.”For many hockey fans, the issue was not about streaming itself. It was about missing the first hour of a major Olympic semifinal on traditional television. With two strong teams on the ice and a place in the gold medal game at stake, viewers expected full live coverage from the opening puck drop.","The Canada vs Finland men’s hockey semifinal began at 10:40 a.m. Eastern Time.

Inside Kelce’s $6 million Leawood mansion

Earlier Kansas City home and Florida family condo

Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce is known for his success on the football field, but his real estate choices have also drawn major attention. The NFL star has owned a lot of homes throughout the years that shows how he lives, and how he intends for the future. The spotlight on his homes increased even more after his relationship with pop star Taylor Swift became public.The best among Kelce's expensive properties is his gorgeous residence in Leawood, Kansas. One of the most talked-about residences for NFL players is this one because it boasts seclusion, exciting amenities, and a modern decor.Kelce's Leawood mansion is worth roughly $6 million and contains more than 17,000 square feet. Located at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac, the property was designed with privacy in mind, an important factor given Kelce’s global popularity. The house features six bedrooms and several bathrooms, offering enough space for guests, family, and large gatherings.The mansion is built in a French Regency style and includes high-end features that make it feel like a luxury resort. Inside the property there are a lot of places to have fun such as a complete bar, a wine cellar, and a two-level movie theater.The exterior environment is just as beautiful, with a resort-style pool, a waterfall, a wide patio, and many acres of manicured grounds.For fitness and recreation, the home includes a private gym, sauna, pickleball court, and even a miniature golf course. These features highlight Kelce’s focus on recovery, training, and leisure in one place. Reports suggest that the mansion also served as the setting for his widely discussed proposal to Swift, adding emotional value to the property.Before moving into the Leawood estate, Kelce purchased a home in Kansas City’s Briarcliff West neighborhood in 2019 for under $1 million.

A peaceful base away from the tour for Novak Djokovic



Tennis legend Novak Djokovic has spent years living out of suitcases, hotel rooms and player lounges. So when he goes home, he really goes home. For the tennis great, that place is Marbella, Spain — a quiet, sun-soaked corner of the Costa del Sol where he can switch off from the noise of the tour and just be with his family. His villa is located in Sierra Blanca, one of Marbella’s most private and high-end residential areas. It sits slightly above the coastline, with open views of the Mediterranean and the mountains behind it. The neighborhood is known for security and seclusion. For someone as globally recognized as Djokovic, that kind of privacy isn’t a luxury, but a necessity.The house is large but not flashy. It is reported to span close to 1,000 square metres, with open living spaces and several bedrooms. Inside, the design is simple and calm, with marble floors, soft colours and large glass doors that bring in natural light. Outside, there is a spacious swimming pool and open terraces where the family can relax. The gardens are neatly kept and offer privacy and quiet.The villa also supports his training routine. It reportedly has nine bedrooms and eight bathrooms, along with a private gym and a spa area that includes a sauna and Turkish bath.There is a cinema room, a games room and a private tennis court where he can practise away from the public eye. With sea and mountain views around the property, the home works as both a peaceful retreat and a private training base. For a player known for his strict routines and recovery work, having those facilities at home makes sense. Even in downtime, the work doesn’t completely stop.The mansion is believed to be worth around $10 million approximately, reflecting both the prime location and its size. Djokovic is said to have settled there around 2020, after spending time in the area and enjoying the climate. Marbella offers warm weather most of the year, which is ideal for training. But more importantly, it offers space that is away from cameras and constant attention.For fans, it’s nice to see this side of Djokovic. On court, he is intense and fully focused. In Marbella, life is quieter and slower for the tennis icon. His home seems not about showing off, but about comfort, privacy and balance. After everything he has achieved in tennis, that may be what matters most.","Novak Djokovic is said to have moved to Marbella, Spain in 2020.

Playing at the same venue



Facing spin



Team news



New Zealand middle-order batter Mark Chapman looked perplexed when he was asked about the Super Eight groups, where all four table-toppers, who have done well in their respective groups, will end up facing each other. It has been done because of the pre-tournament seedings.The 31-year-old smiled and replied, “When it comes to scheduling and planning, that’s not really in my domain.”Chapman’s response sums up the way New Zealand play their cricket. No fuss, no theatrics, just straight down to business.After playing three matches in Chennai and one in Ahmedabad, all on red-soil pitches, the Kiwis had only one training session to adapt to the conditions ahead of their first Super Eight match against Pakistan at the R Premadasa Stadium.None of them rushed towards the pitch for a closer look. Once warm-ups were done, the players moved to the indoor nets. About an hour later, Daryl Mitchell came out barefoot to inspect the surface, spending a good fifteen minutes studying every inch of the 22 yards.Chapman, who did not get to see the surface, left it to the senior leadership group.“In the subcontinent, the toss always plays a factor depending on the conditions.I haven’t seen the pitch yet, so I don’t actually know what it looks like. There will be discussions behind the scenes with the senior leadership group about what we want to do,” he said.The black-soil pitches in Colombo do assist spinners, and with bigger boundaries and a slower outfield, it presents a new challenge for the 2021 T20 World Cup finalists.“We haven’t played in Sri Lanka yet. A lot of guys in our team have played a lot of cricket here, so I don’t see that playing too much of a factor. Guys understand what they need to do, and we are confident we will face whatever conditions are in front of us,” said Chapman, whose knees were heavily strapped.“In India, particularly on red-soil pitches, conditions have been favourable for batting. It has been tough for the bowlers, and the margins have been very small. We have seen scores close to 200 regularly.“Here, it is slightly different with the slower nature of the pitches. The bowlers will hopefully get a chance to show their skills, and spinners are more likely to play a part here,” he added.Although Pakistan are stationed in Sri Lanka, they played their group matches at two different venues in Colombo.New Zealand will be the only team playing all their Super Eight matches at the same venue, facing Pakistan on February 21, Sri Lanka on February 25, and England on February 27, all at the R Premadasa Stadium.“One of the challenges in tournaments like these is hopping from venue to venue and adapting. When we play three games at the same place, we learn with each game.“It is nice to turn up at the same venue with similar pitches and adjust. Tomorrow is our first game here, so we will have to adapt anyway, but we will understand the conditions better as we go,” he said.New Zealand’s first challenge will be Pakistan’s spin-heavy attack. Usman Tariq, Abrar Ahmad, Mohammad Nawaz, Saim Ayub, and Shadab Khan form a strong unit.“Pakistan have a number of very good spinners, each with their own threat. We have played them quite frequently over the last few years.“We are well aware of what they will bring. For us, it is about being really clear in how we want to play against them,” he said.Obviously, there was a Usman Tariq question: “Usman Tariq has a unique action with the way he pauses at the crease, so that is something to factor in.""Chapman, whose role is to take on spinners in the middle overs, explained why running between the wickets will be crucial.“Given the slower pitch and bigger boundaries, you have to change your game plan. Against spinners, it is about different options like the sweep or reverse sweep. In India, you can target straight boundaries more.“For me, it is about finding different areas of the ground. There are big pockets here, so it is not all about sixes. Twos, fours, and running between the wickets are very important, especially if it is not a high-scoring game,” he said.New Zealand have suffered injury setbacks. Michael Bracewell has been ruled out of the remainder of the tournament after re-injuring his left calf. Captain Mitchell Santner missed the last group match against Canada due to illness, while Lockie Ferguson returned home for the birth of his first child.“Mitchell Santner looks pretty sprightly and excited to get back on the park, barring any last-minute illness.“Lockie has just returned and is coming off a long flight. We will see how he pulls up. I cannot confirm whether he will be in the playing eleven,” Chapman said.","New Zealand will play all their Super Eight matches at the same venue, facing Pakistan on February 21, Sri Lanka on February 25, and England on February 27.

Nina Westbrook speaks out after disturbing message sparks debate over sports betting culture

Russell Westbrook’s past clashes with fans resurface as criticism turns deeply personal

Russell Westbrook, a seasoned NBA guard, has faced criticism all of his career, but a recent incident went too far. An angry ""fan"" who was upset about her husband's performance on the court sent a startling email to Westbrook's wife, Nina, calling her a ""dumb b*tch"" and wishing they ""both die in a car crash. ""On Thursday night, Nina, who wed Westbrook in 2015, posted the unsettling statement on her Instagram story. Russ' 5-point performance in the Kings-Magic game seems to have prompted the note's sending. Nina chose not to react emotionally, instead framing the matter as a component of a broader problem associated with the explosive expansion of legal sports betting.After a bettor lost a parlay related to Westbrook's performance with the Sacramento Kings, Nina Westbrook disclosed that she received a violent email. Nina made the statement public in order to draw attention to what she called the negative aspects of contemporary gambling and sports culture. After disparaging the player's performance, the email turned into a threat against them both.The email titled ""F*** You"" reads:""Your piece of f***in sh*t husband sucks to f***n bad can't even get 1o points is pathetic. I hope you both die in a car crash dumb b*tch.""She described the harassment as a result of ""the negative effects of sports betting,"" highlighting the growing resentment of sportsmen and their families over lost income.However, athletes are not liable for specific wagers made by spectators. Player stats, whether they are five points or fifty, remain a component of the competition and do not constitute a wagering agreement. As betting grows more ingrained in broadcasts and fan interaction, the event reignited debate over the lines separating fandom from abuse.In response, Nina, a certified marital and family therapist and former collegiate basketball player, blamed sports gambling as the primary culprit in her Instagram story. Westbrook said:""The negative effects of sports betting.. Brings out the worst in ppl smh.""Westbrook, who joined the Kings in October 2025, regrettably has experience with rowdy fan conduct. A close-up video shows the former NBA MVP arguing with a Suns fan, among other verbal altercations with supporters during games.In response to his contentious interactions with fans, Westbrook, who has three children with Nina, has stated that he would not put up with disrespect, particularly when it concerns his family. For Westbrook, the circumstances are reminiscent of earlier encounters.When fans started making fun of him with different forms of his last name after he performed poorly during his tenure with the Los Angeles Lakers, the criticism became personal. The hostility finally affected his personal life and spread beyond social media to venues.","Nina Westbrook, wife of NBA star Russell Westbrook, received a threatening email after a bettor lost a parlay related to her husband's performance.

After more than half a century behind bars, Charles Bronson , born Michael Gordon Peterson and now legally known as Charles Salvador, and famously portrayed by Tom Hardy in the 2008 film, is once again at the centre of a parole review.Now 73, he is widely regarded as Britain’s most notorious prisoner and was due to have his case considered on 18 February. In the weeks leading up to the review, he dramatically sacked his legal team and refused to take part after being told his request for a public hearing had been rejected. In a letter to Sky News, he wrote: “Sacked the legal team!” and said he wanted nothing to do with what he called the “farcical jam roll,” his term for parole, asking: “What are they afraid of? The truth getting out?”A new solicitor has since been appointed and secured a postponement. The Parole Board is now conducting a paper review rather than holding a fresh oral hearing. The panel will examine written statements from prison staff, probation officers, psychiatrists and Bronson’s legal representatives before deciding whether he can be safely released, transferred to an open prison, or whether the case should proceed to a further oral hearing.No decision has yet been publicly confirmed. What is clear is that this is his ninth attempt at parole.This latest review is not a public spectacle. It is an administrative exercise focused on risk.The panel’s task is straightforward in principle: does Bronson pose a risk to the public, and if so, can that risk be managed through licence conditions and restrictions? If the risk is deemed too high, he remains where he is.At his last full parole hearing in 2023, one of the first public parole hearings in England and Wales, secured after Bronson successfully challenged the secrecy of the process, the board accepted that his behaviour had improved. However, it concluded he was not ready for transfer to an open prison. It recommended that he be tested in a less restrictive regime as a step towards potential release.That progression does not appear to have materialised. Bronson remains in a high-security prison, segregated and locked in his cell for around 23 hours a day. Decisions about reducing his security classification lie with the Ministry of Justice, which does not comment on individual cases.Bob Johnson , a psychiatrist who worked with Bronson three decades ago, has publicly argued that he is being “unjustifiably punished,” describing the length and intensity of his solitary confinement as “unbelievable.” Johnson believes Bronson is heavily institutionalised but could cope outside with structured support and income from his artwork.The Parole Board, however, must weigh that optimism against a long record of violence.Bronson was first jailed in 1974 at the age of 22 for armed robbery. The original sentence was seven years. With the exception of two brief periods of release, 1987 and 1992, he has remained in custody ever since.While serving his initial term, he was convicted repeatedly for violent assaults on prison staff and inmates in 1975, 1978 and 1985. He was released in 1987 at 34, but after just 69 days was returned to prison for robbing a jeweller. In 1992 he was freed again, only to be jailed weeks later for intent to rob.The most consequential episode came in 1999 at Hull prison, where he held a prison art teacher hostage for around 44 hours. The teacher was not physically injured but was left traumatised and did not return to work. Bronson received a discretionary life sentence with a minimum tariff of three to four years, which expired in the early 2000s. He has remained detained ever since because the Parole Board has repeatedly judged him too risky to release.His last conviction was in 2014 for assaulting a prison governor, resulting in a further three-year sentence.Across the decades, Bronson has taken hostages including a deputy governor, staff and inmates, staged protests, and engaged in repeated violent outbursts. He has been moved between numerous high-security prisons and secure hospitals, including Broadmoor, Rampton and Ashworth. In the late 1970s and early 1980s he was transferred to psychiatric hospitals after assaults and suicide attempts, and at one stage attempted to strangle fellow patient John White .Former Belmarsh governor John Podmore has said he once placed Bronson in a normal cell and worked to curb his behaviour. The arrangement lasted only weeks.Outside prison, Bronson briefly fought in illegal bare-knuckle boxing contests and adopted the name Charles Bronson after the Hollywood actor. Over the years he has also used names including Charles Ali Ahmed, following a short-lived conversion to Islam, and, more recently, Charles Salvador.His notoriety has been amplified by popular culture. The 2008 film, directed by Nicolas Winding Refn and starring Tom Hardy, dramatised his life and cemented his public image as a theatrical, volatile anti-hero.Inside prison, Bronson has channelled much of his energy into art and writing. Since 1999 he has had 11 books published, includingand. In February 2023, hundreds of his drawings were exhibited and offered for sale, with prices ranging from £700 to £30,000. The works are vivid, often depicting confinement, madness and despair, but occasionally carry handwritten messages of hope, including: “God save our dreams. It’s all we have left. One simple dream will bring you through all this misery.”Supporters argue that his art demonstrates transformation. Critics see performance layered over a record of violence.Bronson’s personal life has unfolded largely within prison walls.He married Irene Kelsey in 1971; and eight months later, the couple wed and had their first son named Michael Jonathan Peterson. In 2001, he married Fatema Saira Rehman at HMP Woodhill after she began writing to him. He briefly converted to Islam and took the name Charles Ali Ahmed. The marriage ended four years later, and he renounced both Islam and the name.In 2017 he married Paula Williamson, a formeractress, after she began visiting him in prison. The marriage was annulled in 2018. Williamson was found dead at her home in 2019; police said her death was not suspicious.Bronson has spoken publicly about wanting to be released to fulfil what he described at his 2023 hearing as his mother’s “last dream.” At that hearing he admitted that in earlier years he “couldn’t stop taking hostages,” describing it as “battling against the system.” He told the panel he was “almost an angel now” compared with his younger self.Bronson has now spent approximately 52 years in custody, one of the longest periods served by any British prisoner. Much of that time has been in solitary confinement.For release to occur, the Parole Board must be satisfied that the risk he presents can be safely managed in the community. Alternatively, it could recommend a move to an open prison as an intermediate step. It could also decide that further testing or a fresh oral hearing is required.The central question has not changed in decades: is Charles Bronson a man who has aged out of violence, or one whose history makes him too unpredictable to trust?At 73, he remains hopeful. In his recent letter, he referenced a “freedom party” planned for 2028, telling readers: “Don’t be late.”Whether that party ever takes place depends not on reputation, art or mythology, but on a risk assessment now unfolding quietly on paper.","Charles Bronson was first jailed in 1974 at the age of 22 for armed robbery. With the exception of two brief periods of release, 1987 and 1992, he has remained in custody ever since. While serving his initial term, he was convicted repeatedly for violent assaults on prison staff and inmates in 1975, 1978 and 1985.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128575771,imgsize-1335341,width-400,resizemode-4/charles-bronson.jpg"

Coffee voucher glitch makes Nottingham woman a “quadrillionaire” on paper

From a Christmas gift to global news: Sophie’s bizarre coffee fortune





Sophie Downing, a 29-year-old business owner from Nottingham, has reportedly become the richest person in history according to a local coffee shop receipt. The catch is that her fortune can only be spent at 200 Degrees Coffee.The Nottingham story began with a simple Christmas gift. Sophie received a voucher that she thought was £10 for the café. When she tried to buy a matcha latte last week, the till displayed an astonishing balance of over £63 quadrillion.A person richer than the world’s richest man? Strange! It is roughly 100,000 times more than Elon Musk’s net worth and 670 times the total value of the world economy.Check below the whole story of Sophie, who is the ‘Richest Person in the History’, but only for COFFEE?Sophie first used the card at the Flying Horse Walk branch on February 12. The barista reportedly froze when the balance appeared on the screen. “His face was just like, ‘what?’” she said. She returned on February 17 to make another purchase and discovered the balance was still in the tens of quadrillions. No one from 200 Degrees has confirmed what caused the error. Sophie speculates that it could be a scanning mistake. “It looks as though the wrong barcode was scanned, which somehow created this insane balance,” she said.Despite the unbelievable amount, Sophie has no plans to spend it all. “I could go in and clear the shelves, but I don’t want to take the mick,” she joked. “It would be better if it were a different gift card.”Although the figure is technically not cash, it illustrates the quirks of modern digital systems. Barcodes, scanning errors, and software glitches can sometimes create numbers that are impossible in reality, especially in automated retail environments relying heavily on digital inventory tracking. Experts say this is a rare but fascinating example of how technology can produce absurd outcomes. On paper, Sophie is far richer than anyone else alive. The number is so huge that it’s caught everyone’s attention across news outlets and online forums alike. Social media is full of jokes and memes about her “coffee empire.” People are having fun imagining what she might do with this quadrillionaire status—buy entire cities, or maybe supply coffee to the world, fund space missions, or pay off global debts overnight.Sophie herself finds the situation funny and a little magical. “You feel rich for a moment, even if it’s just on a screen,” she said. “It makes you think about numbers differently.” The incident has sparked conversations about how technology and daily life intersect. A small Christmas gift and a simple coffee order have created headlines around the world. While this fortune is likely due to a technical glitch, it’s an entertaining reminder of how reality can sometimes feel stranger than fiction.","Sophie Downing, a 29-year-old business owner from Nottingham, has reportedly become the richest person in history according to a local coffee shop receipt.

Indian plate drift reshaped the region



Himalayas continue to uplift 1 cm every year





Imagine standing 8,000 metres above the sea floor at Mount Everest , and you find a marine fossil. You should not be surprised because fossils of marine animals have been documented near the summit of Mount Everest , findings that continue to draw scientific and public interest. Climbers and geologists have reported remains of trilobites, crinoids and brachiopods embedded high in the Himalayas. These fossils are not recent intrusions. They are part of sedimentary rock formed millions of years before the mountain existed. Their presence reflects deep geological change linked to plate tectonics and the long closure of an ancient ocean. Evidence gathered over decades connects these marine deposits to the former Tethys Ocean, which once separated the Indian landmass from Asia. The rocks now exposed at extreme altitude were once laid down beneath seawater, later lifted as continents converged.According to The Geology Society , Everest’s summit is formed on the floor of the Tethys Ocean. Around 225 million years ago, the Indian plate sat far south of Asia, separated by this broad ocean basin. Sediments accumulated along its margins. Shells and skeletal fragments settled into layers that slowly hardened into rock.These layers remained in place as tectonic forces reshaped the region. The fossils seen today are ordinary marine organisms from that distant period. Their height above sea level is what seems unusual.When the supercontinent Pangaea began to fragment about 200 million years ago, the Indian plate started moving north. By 80 million years ago it was thousands of kilometres south of Asia but advancing steadily. The oceanic crust of the Tethys was pushed beneath the Eurasian margin in a subduction zone, similar in setting to the Andes today.Not all material disappeared underground. Thick marine sediments were scraped off and pressed against the Eurasian edge. Over time these accumulated sediments became part of the rising mountain belt.Between 50 and 40 million years ago, the Indian and Eurasian continental plates collided. Neither plate could sink easily because both were buoyant continental crust. Instead, the crust crumpled, thickened and lifted. The collision marked the start of Himalayan uplift.The Himalayas stretch roughly 2,900 kilometres east to west. Mount Everest reaches 8,848 metres, the highest point on Earth. Geological measurements indicate the range is still rising by more than one centimetre per year as India continues to press northward. At the same time, erosion works in the opposite direction. Rock is worn down by ice, wind, and water. The balance shifts slowly. Fossils remain in place, quiet traces of a sea that once covered what is now the roof of the world, reminding scientists of ancient life and the dramatic transformations that shaped the landscape over tens of millions of years.","Fossil seashells on Everest confirm the Himalayas were once under the sea.

Serial drugging and deaths at motels





A 21-year-old South Korean woman has been charged with murder in connection with the so-called ‘Gangbuk motel serial deaths’, after police claimed to have gathered evidence that she used ChatGPT to research the potentially fatal effects of mixing prescription drugs with alcohol.The suspect, Kim, is accused of drugging men at motels in Seoul’s Gangbuk district by giving them drinks laced with prescription drugs containing benzodiazepine, leading to the deaths of two men and leaving a third unconscious, authorities said.A forensic examination of her mobile phone allegedly revealed repeated ChatGPT searches about the dangers of combining sleeping pills with alcohol.According to the BBC, investigators found that she had asked the AI chatbot questions, including: “What happens if you take sleeping pills with alcohol?” “How many do you need to take for it to be dangerous?” and “Could it kill someone?”Kim had earlier admitted to putting prescribed benzodiazepine-based sleeping pills into drinks, but had claimed that she did not know the combination could be deadly. She claimed that she used the combination to help the victims sleep.Kim was initially arrested on February 11 following the deaths of two men in their 20s. The police charged her with inflicting bodily injury resulting in death, as the men were found dead following separate motel visits with her.According to police, the first alleged fatal incident took place on 28 January in Suyu-dong, Gangbuk-gu, Seoul. Kim had reportedly entered a motel with a man in his 20s and left alone about two hours later.The next day, the man was discovered dead inside the room.Investigators say a similar incident occurred on 9 February. Kim allegedly checked into another motel in Gangbuk-gu with a second man in his 20s, who was also found dead later. The police suspected that the same method was used in both cases.Officials have also revealed that what they believe was Kim’s first attempt at drugging someone occurred in December last year.In that instance, she allegedly gave a drink laced with sedatives to her then-partner in a café parking lot in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province, causing him to lose consciousness. He had later regained consciousness.Police allege that after this initial incident, Kim began preparing drinks with significantly higher doses of the drug, leading to the subsequent deaths.Authorities are continuing their investigation to determine whether there may be additional victims beyond the three cases currently identified.","Kim, 21, is accused of drugging men at motels in Seoul's Gangbuk district.

Claims generate online interest and academic caution

Speculation links findings to ancient myths and older cultures

Cairo: PM Narendra Modi visits 'The Great Pyramid of Giza'





News stories in March 2025 brought to light new claims that there are hidden buildings under the Pyramid of Khafre on the Giza plateau. A study group in Italy, using satellite radar images instead of digging in the ground, says it has found large underground features that go deep below the monument. The group used Synthetic Aperture Radar data from satellites in space and processed it to make a set of images showing the density of the ground below. Based on what they know, there are vertical shafts and large rooms cut into the rock. It has not been confirmed by an investigation that took place on-site. For now, they are still part of a debate about how to use remote sensing, how to analyse data, and the geology of Egypt's Giza plateau, which has been studied for a long time.The researchers relied on Synthetic Aperture Radar, often shortened to SAR. This technology sends radar signals from satellites in orbit. The signals reflect off the ground and are recorded, then processed using mathematical modelling. Variations in density and structure can appear as patterns in the final images.Based on this study, “What Really Lies Beneath the Pyramids?” , the team believes it can see eight deep cylindrical shafts beneath the pyramid.These are said to descend hundreds of metres into the limestone bedrock. At the lower end, the images appear to show two large cubic chambers. Inside the pyramid itself, five vertical voids are also suggested. It is an interpretation of patterns rather than a physical survey.The announcement moved quickly across social media platforms. Alternative history commentators gave it prominence. Videos and commentary circulated widely within days.Academic reaction has been more restrained. Egyptologists point out that satellite radar imagery can be complex. Image processing may produce shapes that resemble structures without confirming their material nature. Without drilling, excavation or ground-penetrating surveys, it is difficult to establish what lies below.The Giza plateau is not solid stone throughout. Limestone bedrock in the area contains natural cavities and fissures. Some caves have been explored in previous decades. Earlier geophysical surveys also detected voids in certain areas beneath the pyramids.Because of this, some researchers suggest the radar signatures could represent natural formations rather than engineered shafts. The difference matters. Geological voids are common in limestone terrain. The present claims do not yet clearly separate between natural and artificial origins.Beyond the technical dispute, some authors have made similarities between the suggested structures and the Duat, the nether region mentioned in funerary texts in ancient Egypt. Others go further and propose connections to Taş Tepeler-related prehistoric sites in Anatolia. These connections are yet theoretical. There is currently no archaeological evidence linking those previous cultures to the Giza plateau. For the time being, the radar investigation broadens the debate about Khafre's pyramid. It doesn't resolve the issue.","Satellite radar study claims vast underground structures beneath the Giza Pyramid.
