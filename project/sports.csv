Magic Johnson praises Jeanie Buss and Mark Walter in heartfelt reaction to record-setting Lakers sale



The Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson could not hide his feelings after a bombshell report that the franchise was being sold. In a stunning move that has redefined sports business history, the Los Angeles Lakers— one of the NBA's most valuable franchises— has been sold for a record-breaking $10 billion. Jeanie Buss and her family agreed to sell their 66% majority stake to billionaire Mark Walter, CEO of TWG Global and Guggenheim Partners. The transaction, first reported by ESPN’s Shams Charania, makes it the largest sale of a professional sports franchise ever, surpassing the Boston Celtics' $6.1 billion mark earlier this year.Magic Johnson, the face of the Los Angeles Lakers' greatness and a longtime close friend of Jeanie Buss, had no hesitation in applauding her decision and the legacy she now leaves behind. Taking to X, Johnson poured out a series of personal and public reflections.“Job well done to my sister Jeanie Buss for striking an incredible deal and picking the right person to carry on the @Lakers legacy and tradition of winning - Mark Walter, my business partner and friend! Mark Walter is the best choice and will be the best caretaker of the Laker brand. The proof is in the pudding on what he’s been able to accomplish with the LA Dodgers.Mark has been nothing short of a winner notching 2 World Series and 11 NL West divisional titles in the last 12 years!” Johnson wrote.Mark Walter, already a minority stakeholder in the Lakers since 2021, also owns the Los Angeles Dodgers, the WNBA’s Sparks, and interests in Chelsea FC and a Formula 1 team. His entry into majority ownership, as confirmed to CNBC, is viewed not just as a business move but as a strategic continuation of LA's winning culture.“Laker fans should be ecstatic. A few things I can tell you about Mark – he is driven by winning, excellence, and doing everything the right way. AND he will put in the resources needed to win! I can understand why Jeanie sold the team to Mark Walter because they are just alike – they are competitive people, have big hearts, love to give back, and both prefer to be behind the scenes. This makes all the sense in the world. I am so so SO happy and excited for @Lakers fans all over the world!!” Johnson added.The sale marks the end of a 46-year legacy that began when Dr. Jerry Buss purchased the Lakers for $67.5 million in 1979. Under the Buss family's leadership, the franchise flourished, capturing 11 NBA championships and becoming a global brand. Jeanie Buss, who took over as governor in 2013 following her father’s passing, will retain her position and a minority share post-sale.“Just like I thought, when the Celtics sold for $6B, I knew the Lakers were worth $10B!” Johnson stated, referencing the Celtics’ March 2025 sale to private equity executive Bill Chisholm.Despite the mammoth valuation, the Lakers’ home—Crypto.com Arena—is not included in the deal, which makes the sheer franchise value even more staggering.“I know that my sister Jeanie would have only considered selling the Lakers organization to someone she knows and trusts would carry on the Buss legacy, started by her father Dr. Buss. Now she can comfortably pass the baton to Mark Walter, with whom she has a real friendship and can trust. She’s witnessed him build a winning team with the Dodgers and knows that Mark will do right by the Lakers team, organization, and fans! Both are extremely intelligent, visionaries, great leaders, and have positively impacted the greater Los Angeles community! I love both my sister @JeanieBuss and my business partner Mark Walter,” Johnson shared in another post.The sale, which still requires formal league approval, is expected to close within months. For Johnson, the emotion was palpable when he spoke directly to Jeanie.“I just talked to my sister Jeanie Buss to tell her congratulations, and that I’m so happy for her and family. I told her that her dad Dr. Buss would be very proud of her for getting $10B for the Lakers, the largest sports franchise sale in history!” he wrote.Also Read: Los Angeles Lakers $10 Billion Sale Shatters Sports Franchise Records; Buss Family Makes NBA History The Lakers, with 17 NBA championships and a global fanbase, are entering a new era.

Why Toronto Maple Leafs star Mitch Marner needs a clean NHL break



A Blizzard of Goals Puts Florida a Win Away From Glory | 32 Thoughts

Top NHL teams in the Western Conference could pursue Mitch Marner

The NHL offseason buzz is centered on Toronto Maple Leafs forward Mitch Marner, and his teammates may have already revealed the biggest clue. Several Leafs players reportedly believe Marner’s next destination lies out West, away from the pressure cooker of Toronto and the emotional ties to the Eastern Conference.As NHL insider Elliotte Friedman recently shared, the belief in the Leafs locker room is that Marner wants a full reset, and a Western Conference team would offer just that. While the Carolina Hurricanes have shown interest, Friedman downplayed their chances, pointing instead to a desire for a clean break and long-term distance from his current team.Since entering the league, Mitch Marner has carried both the hopes and frustrations of Toronto Maple Leafs fans. Postseason disappointments and salary cap debates have often overshadowed a skilled playmaker and top-line winger, Marner’s regular-season consistency.The attention and pressure from the Canadian hockey market have seemingly taken a toll. After years of scrutiny, Marner is now believed to be craving something the Leafs can no longer provide, freedom from expectations.As trade talks heat up, several NHL teams in the Western Conference are emerging as potential fits for Mitch Marner.Though no official suitors have been named, teams like the Los Angeles Kings, Vegas Golden Knights, and Seattle Kraken have cap space and a desire to bolster their top-six forward groups.Early offseason chatter linked Marner to the Boston Bruins and Florida Panthers, but remaining in the Atlantic Division now appears unlikely. Facing the Maple Leafs multiple times each season while still in the Eastern spotlight runs counter to Marner’s apparent desire to fade from that narrative.According to teammate insight and league reports, this is about more than hockey. Mitch Marner wants control over his next chapter, and that next chapter seems destined to begin far from Toronto, in the quieter lanes of the NHL’s Western frontier. Don’t be surprised if talks stretch deep into the summer. Marner’s $10.9 million cap hit means any deal will require strategic balancing from both sides.In the meantime, fan opinion remains divided. Some still believe Marner deserves more time, while others see his exit as a necessary evolution for the franchise. Mitch Marner’s future with the Maple Leafs seems increasingly uncertain as trade rumors intensify. A move to the Western Conference could offer the reset he’s reportedly seeking. With emotional fatigue setting in and pressure mounting, Marner’s next chapter may unfold far from Toronto’s spotlight.Mitch Marner’s future with the Toronto Maple Leafs is shrouded in uncertainty, as teammates believe a Western Conference move is likely. Tired of constant scrutiny and emotional weight, Marner is reportedly seeking a full reset away from Toronto’s spotlight. Trade talks are expected to stretch into the summer, with Western teams eyeing him as a transformative top-line addition.Read more: Trade news: Blackhawks send Victor Söderström to Bruins for Ryan Mast and a draft pick","Mitch Marner’s future with the Toronto Maple Leafs is shrouded in uncertainty, as teammates believe a Western Conference move is likely.

Brad Marchand’s misspelled tattoo goes viral again

In the world of hockey, few celebrations are as wild or as talked about as Brad Marchand’s after the 2011 Stanley Cup win. The Boston Bruins forward did not hold back. But what’s making noise again in 2025 isn’t just the party—it’s what came with it. From a massive bar bill to a tattoo gone wrong, Marchand’s choices continue to spark laughs and surprise across social media.Brad Marchand and the Boston Bruins won the Stanley Cup on June 15, 2011, after beating the Vancouver Canucks in Game 7. To celebrate, they went to the Las Vegas Strip. At XS Nightclub in the MGM Grand, they partied all night. A bill from that night showed they spent $156,679.74. Most of the money went on very expensive champagne bottles and luxury drinks.Recently, in June 2025, the photos of the bill circulated social media again, causing a stir. People were surprised at how much was spent in a single night. Many hockey fans on reddit joked about how one party night could equal a year’s salary for others.Some even called it “the most expensive hangover in NHL history.” Bruins fans shared mixed reactions, with many still proud of that victory, while others found the spending “over the top.”Along with the wild party, Brad Marchand also got a tattoo to remember the win, but it had a mistake. The tattoo was meant to say “Stanley Cup Champions.” Instead, it read “Stanley Cup Champians.” The spelling error went viral in 2011 and has now returned to the spotlight in 2025 as fans post old photos again.Also Read: NHL Trade News: Brad Marchand's Departure Sparks Emotional Storm As Boston Bruins Fan Makes Shocking Weather Discovery Social media users shared the image widely, and it started trending after a new sports meme account posted it with the caption, “Still the most Boston thing ever.” Bruins fans have joked about it, but some admit the error still stings. One fan wrote, “We waited 39 years for the Cup and got ‘Champians’ forever.”Even Marchand himself once joked about it during an interview in 2016, saying, “I didn’t even notice it for days.” He has never gotten the tattoo fixed, which only adds to its fame.","Brad Marchand and the Boston Bruins won the Stanley Cup on June 15, 2011.

Brandon Aiyuk could be the star Patrick Mahomes needs

Patrick Mahomes has been waiting for a big-play receiver

The Kansas City Chiefs might be planning something big before the 2025 NFL season begins. On June 16, 2025, reports started coming out that the team could go after San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk. He’s looking for a long-term deal, possibly worth $23 million per year. Such a move could potentially create a lot of avenues for the Kansas City Chiefs' offense and give quarterback Patrick Mahomes another powerful weapon. Nothing is done yet, but each day is bringing this closer. Fans are enjoying what will emerge next.Brandon Aiyuk, 26, was a big part of the San Francisco 49ers' offense, compiling a 2023 season where he notched 75 catches, 1,342 yards, and 7 touchdowns in his statistically best season as a professional. Brandon Aiyuk is fast, trustworthy, and consistently finds ways to beat defenders — in other words, he's the type of option Patrick Mahomes could use more of. The Kansas City Chiefs have not had a true top wide receiver since Tyreek Hill left town. If this deal goes through, it could reshape the AFC landscape and make the Chiefs even tougher to stop in the postseason.On June 16, 2025, Brandon Aiyuk posted a short video on TikTok saying, “They don’t want me back,” referring to the 49ers.That same day, ESPN’s Adam Schefter said on NFL Live, “If Brandon Aiyuk is truly available, the Chiefs will absolutely be in the mix.”Brandon Aiyuk is in the final year of his rookie contract, with a $14 million option. He wants a raise — close to $23 million a year. If the Kansas City Chiefs want to help Patrick Mahomes even more, this could be their chance. According to The Athletic, the team still has around $25 million in cap space. That gives them enough room to make the deal work if they want to.This offseason, Patrick Mahomes has been training in Missouri with a young group of wide receivers. Most of them are still learning, and while they’ve shown potential, none of them have the star power that Brandon Aiyuk brings.A player like Brandon Aiyuk could alleviate pressure on Patrick Mahomes, and make the Kansas City Chiefs’ offense much more dynamic. Training camp will start towards the end of July 2025. If a deal ever occurs before that, the team could go into the season with a brand new weapon ready to go.Adding Aiyuk could elevate the Chiefs’ offense with improved playmaking, balance, and versatility—bringing more explosiveness, precision, and leadership to the field. It wouldn’t just be a roster upgrade; it could reshape their entire offensive identity and Super Bowl path.Also Read: San Francisco 49ers GM John Lynch Breaks Silence On Brandon Aiyuk’s Return After ACL And MCL Tear Against Kansas City Chiefs","Brandon Aiyuk, 26, was a big part of the San Francisco 49ers' offense, compiling a 2023 season where he notched 75 catches, 1,342 yards, and 7 touchdowns.

What is the controversial “ring culture” comment by LeBron James?

If you’re an NBA fan, then two legends — LeBron James and Michael Jordan are who you should be well versed with. They have been pretty excellent at creating history. But, what could possibly be admiration, may soon turn into a rivalry — only to answer one question — who is the bigger GOAT in the NBA — Is it LeBron James or Michael Jordan?Having debates over “ring culture” could be seen as an uplifting move for fans, and other NBA players, but for one of the best NBA stars, LeBron James, it is pretty frustrating, as he feels, he doesn’t understand why. LeBron James said, he doesn’t understand why ‘ring culture’ is always brought up when it comes to him. He feels such conversations always end up being taken in a different context rather that how much effort an individual player is putting in their game. LeBron insists that ""winning a title is a collective effort.“Are you seriously telling me that these guys weren't incredible just because they didn't win?"" That they're left out of conversations about other greats? It's bizarre,"" he said.Craig Carton, who hosts Breakfast Ball, feels LeBron James has been talking about NBA legend Michael Jordan, indirectly, as he brings up “championship rings” in debates. During the podcast, Carton said, ""He makes it so easy for me, He's an insufferable narcissist. Great player. For my money, a top-10 player of all-time, for sure. You can debate where you want to put him. He's not No. 1. But it's so clear to me — I can't prove this, it's just my take on it — of how Michael Jordan lives rent-free in his head.Michael Jordan has been able to secure at least six championships in his entire career. Meanwhile, LeBron James secured four championships. Carton believes, when LeBron brings up “championship rings” stating they don’t matter, is due to the particular context.In an interview with the Today Show's Willie Geist, LeBron was confident enough to pick himself out of the two. LeBron said ""Oh, I take myself. I will take myself for sure. I'm going to take myself versus anybody, They're going to have to have a few wheelchairs and a couple of ambulances there to get us off the floor.""During a promotional event in Hong Kong, NBA legend, Shaquille O'Neal was asked regarding the same LeBron and Jordan debate, he said via ESPN, ""It would be an interesting game, Young LeBron was more like Magic Johnson. He was sort of like Magic with Jordan's abilities. He liked to pass, and he liked to get it up. But Mike was Mike. He was just special—like no one else. He always did things no one else could do and things you couldn't compare to anyone else. So, he was special, and he'd win.""Also Read: “A ring is a team accomplishment”- LeBron James goes down memory lane with the ring culture in NBA on Mind the Game","NBA legend, Craig Carton criticizes LeBron James' 'ring culture' comment.

They tilted the rink, they were able to stay on top of us all over the place. Never really able to generate any momentum up the ice.""Connor McDavid added, ""We kept trying the same thing over and over again, just banging our heads against the wall. Credit to them, they played well.""But fans believe the Edmonton Oilers’ captain will soon be leaving the team.A fan took to X and wrote, “Connor McDavid most likely will not be an Oiler next season. That’s my prediction”, while another fan commented, “McDavid will go to the habs. Probably not.”A third fan posted, “Respect.While Kanes blaming the refs, fans are blaming Skinner, this guy says, yep, the Panthers are a good team.

Evander Kane did not show up for the traditional handshake after losing Game 6 to the Panthers



Fans instantly called him out, with many calling it “classless” and “disrespectful”



“I get it, emotions are high,but hell definitely regret that if not already. Ita the single greatest tradition in playoff hockey and what separates the NHL from other sports”

When the Oilers watched the Panthers celebrate their first-ever Stanley Cup win, the pain was real. But as hockey tradition goes, you line up, shake hands, and show respect, win or lose. Except one name was missing. Evander Kane never showed up for the post-game handshake line after Edmonton’s crushing 5–1 Game 6 loss and fans instantly noticed. Cue the backlash.It’s one of the most sacred things in hockey: no matter how heated the battle, players meet at center ice after a playoff series to shake hands. But after Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Final, as Florida players lined up to shake hands with the defeated Oilers, Evander Kane was nowhere to be seen.Kane was handed a 10-minute misconduct late in the third period after slashing Matthew Tkachuk. By the time the game ended and handshakes began, Kane had already left the bench and did not return.The moment didn’t go unnoticed. Viewers on social media lit up the timeline, accusing Kane of being a “sore loser” and showing “zero sportsmanship.”One comment read: “Lifetime regret added on top of never winning the cup.”Another X (Twitter) user wrote:Criticism came fast, especially since the post-game handshake is considered one of the most respectful rituals in pro sports. And with this being the Stanley Cup Final, emotions were at an all-time high.Not everyone was ready to drag Kane for it. A few fans online pointed out that a 10-minute misconduct means a player technically isn’t allowed to come back on the ice, even after the game ends.Still, others argued he could have found a way to show respect whether it was on the ice, or even a public acknowledgement after.Kane isn’t exactly a neutral figure in the hockey world. His past controversies including past suspensions and off-ice drama make moments like this one feel even more intense. For many fans, this felt like just another example of Evander Kane doing Evander Kane things.Also read - Trade watch: Penguins could trade $30M winger Bryan Rust after career season, per insider","Evander Kane did not show up for the traditional handshake after losing Game 6 to the Panthers.

Police say Shedeur Sanders was clocked at 101 mph near Strongsville, Ohio



The rookie QB now has two options: fight it in court or pay up



Fans react as Sanders' “fast start” takes on a whole new meaning



Just months after being drafted by the Cleveland Browns, rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders is already making headlines and not the kind the team was hoping for. Early Tuesday morning, the 22-year-old was pulled over in Ohio for allegedly speeding at 101 miles per hour on the highway. It was 12:24 a.m., and according to police records, Sanders was driving north on I-71 when he was cited for going 41 mph over the limit.According to the citation, Shedeur was pulled over by local authorities in Strongsville, about 20 minutes from downtown Cleveland. He was allegedly driving 101 mph, a clear violation of the speed limit and one that could come with steep penalties depending on how the case is handled.For now, it’s a standard traffic ticket, but driving over 100 mph can sometimes result in harsher consequences depending on local laws, past driving history, or how the court views the offense. Luckily for Shedeur, this doesn't appear to involve any DUI or reckless endangerment charges, just excessive speed.Shedeur now has a choice: he can either fight the ticket in court or pay the fine outright. That’s standard in these cases though fighting it could come with the hope of reducing points or penalties on his license.No official statement has been released by Sanders or the Browns organization, but it’s safe to assume the team is aware.And considering this is his rookie offseason, the last thing they want is more off-field drama.Naturally, fans didn’t waste time chiming in. Some joked that Sanders is just “practicing his 40-yard dash in a car,” while others questioned his decision-making just weeks before Browns training camp.It’s not uncommon for NFL players to land in hot water over speeding tickets, but driving over 100 mph? That’s never a good look, especially for a rookie QB already under the microscope thanks to his famous last name and high expectations.While no one's calling this a scandal, it’s definitely not the cleanest way to kick off your NFL career. Shedeur has time to clean it up, either by paying the fine or showing up in court. But you can bet Browns fans and coaches will be watching closely.Also read - “Fu*k KC”: Chiefs hit with racial bias lawsuit, fans stunned over pay gap and wrongful firing claims","Shedeur Sanders was pulled over early Tuesday morning in Strongsville, Ohio.

The Bigger Picture: Lakers’ Offseason Strategy

Theentered the 2025 season with high expectations after acquiring Luka Dončić to pair with LeBron James . However, their early playoff exit against the Minnesota Timberwolves exposed glaring roster flaws. Now, the front office is eyeing upgrades, and a surprising target has emerged: former Boston Celtics defensive stalwart Marcus Smart.According to Bovada, the Los Angeles Lakers hold the second-best odds (+200) to land Smart, trailing only the Sacramento Kings (+150). With Washington likely moving on from the veteran guard, Los Angeles sees an opportunity to bolster its defense and add championship experience.Despite limited playing time over the past two seasons (just 54 total games), Marcus Smart remains a proven difference-maker. His resume includes:- 2019-20 NBA All-Defensive First Team- 2021-22 Defensive Player of the Year- Key contributor to Boston’s 2022 Finals runThe Los Angeles Lakers struggled defensively last season, ranking 18th in defensive rating. Smart’s ability to guard multiple positions and disrupt opposing offenses would immediately address this weakness.As Matt John of Athlon Sports noted in the original report: ""Smart is a former Defensive Player of the Year who helped the Celtics make multiple extensive playoff runs, including a run to the NBA Finals in 2022.""While Los Angeles is a strong suitor, other teams are also in the mix:The Kings’ slightly better odds stem from their need for backcourt defense, but the Lakers’ championship pedigree could sway Smart’s decision.Washington isn’t expected to demand a hefty return for Smart, given their rebuild. The Lakers could offer:- A future second-round pick- A young prospect (e.g., Jalen Hood-Schifino)- Salary filler (e.g., Taurean Prince)This low-risk move would allow LA to retain flexibility for bigger trades while adding a proven playoff performer.Marcus Smart isn’t the only piece the Lakers need, but he fits their timeline. Here’s why:1. Defensive Upgrade – Smart’s tenacity would complement the offensive firepower of James and Dončić 2. Leadership – His experience in high-pressure games would benefit a roster with title aspirations.3. Cost-Effective – Unlike blockbuster trades, acquiring Smart wouldn’t gut the Lakers’ assets.Marcus Smart's interest from the Los Angeles Lakers suggests a practical approach to roster construction. He won't fix every issue they have, but his playoff experience and defensive prowess make him a prime target. Los Angeles' pursuit of another championship may benefit from this move if they can outmaneuver Sacramento.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Might Sign $100 Million Brooklyn Nets superstar; Backups In Store Too?

Is Gisele Bundchen over Tom Brady for good? Her recent move has fans convinced



Tom Brady has always worn his heart on his sleeve when it comes to family. This past Mother's Day, the NFL icon took a moment to publicly appreciate his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen, for her role as a dedicated mother. His social media tribute described her as “strong,” “compassionate,” and “amazing,” praising her efforts in raising their two children, Benjamin and Vivian. For many, it was a reminder of Brady's commitment to celebrating the people who shaped his personal life, even if they are no longer together.However, when Father’s Day rolled around just weeks later, fans were taken aback by Bündchen’s silence. Not a single post or mention of Tom Brady appeared on her social media. While celebrities often choose to keep their personal expressions private, this noticeable absence sparked curiosity—and in some corners, criticism.Tom Brady’s heartfelt tribute had raised expectations of a reciprocal gesture. Instead, Bündchen’s pages remained focused on her personal life, which now includes her new family dynamic with jiu-jitsu trainer Joaquim Valente. Her most recent family-centered post revolved around her daughter Vivian’s birthday, capturing her happiness in a new chapter.This, for many fans, signaled a stronger desire to close the chapter on her former life with Brady and fully embrace her new one.Meanwhile, Brady continued to show the world that family is central to who he is. On Father's Day , he honored his own father, Tom Brady Sr., with a message that read, ""It's important to appreciate the people who shape us. No one's done more for me than my dad."" The tribute underscored the NFL legend’s consistent public display of gratitude, not just as a father but also as a son.The sharp contrast between Brady’s open expression and Gisele Bündchen’s silence triggered waves of speculation online. While some believed Gisele was simply setting boundaries, others viewed it as a sign of lingering tension. Social media comment sections quickly filled with polarized takes—some defending her right to privacy, others accusing her of being dismissive despite Brady’s previous gesture.Publications like The Sun and Newsweek also weighed in, noting how fans interpreted the silence as a possible reflection of a deeper divide between the ex-couple. Still, it's worth noting that neither Brady nor Bündchen has publicly addressed the situation, allowing the speculation to grow.According to People, Gisele’s romance with Valente blossomed slowly and quietly. “They started out as great friends first. She’s very private about this and wanted to keep it quiet while they got to know each other,” a source revealed. “He was a huge comfort for Gisele while she went through her divorce. Their friendship turned romantic after the divorce.”As the former couple continues to co-parent in the public eye, the disparity in their public gestures reveals the complexities that come with navigating life post-divorce—especially when the world is always watching.Also Read: Tom Brady once choked up as he admitted he wasn’t as good a father as his own dad: ""When I think about being a dad...""",Gisele Bündchen did not post on her social media for Father's Day.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander came into this Finals with an average of 32.4 points, 5.0 assists, 4.6 rebounds, 2.4 steals, and 1.8 blocks per game. No player has matched that kind of stat line in Finals history over five games since the 1973–74 season. With those impressive numbers already grabbing attention, the pressure for Game 6 is immense: breaking century-old records, securing a championship, and etching his name among the greats.Shai Gilgeous‑Alexander currently holds the fifth spot in the all-time career Finals PPG list at 32.4, trailing behind Rick Barry (36.3), Allen Iverson (35.6), Giannis Antetokounmpo (35.2), and Michael Jordan (33.6).If he has a monster Game 6—think 52 points—it won’t just bring a championship to Oklahoma City; it will also make him the highest-scoring guard in Finals history. Additionally, it would break the Game 6 single-game scoring record (currently 50 by Bob Pettit and Giannis) and add another remarkable achievement to an already stunning Finals résumé.This year's MVP has been a force since Day 1. He topped the league with 32.7 PPG while shooting 51.9%, contributed 6.4 assists and 5 rebounds, and led the Thunder to an impressive 68-14 record. In the Western Conference Finals, he put up an average of 31.4 PPG, 8.2 APG, and 5.2 RPG, earning him the WCF Finals MVP title. Now, he's just two wins away from solidifying a legacy that starts with MVP accolades but could peak with a championship and record-breaking performance.Also Read: Caitlin Clark walked back into the game and what followed shocked everyone Game 6 isn’t just another occasion—it’s potentially the climax of a phenomenal year for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. A 52-point, series-clinching blowout would obliterate long-standing records, elevate him to the title of the most prolific Finals guard in history, and weave Thunder tales into legend. Paycom Center is buzzing with excitement—and after one stunning performance, the narrative surrounding Shai Gilgeous‑Alexander could change permanently.","Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous‑Alexander is the Finals MVP.

England have named their playing XI for the opening Test of the much-awaited five-match series against India, set to begin on Friday, June 20, at Headingley in Leeds. The series marks the inauguration of the newly minted Tendulkar-Anderson Trophy and kicks off the 2025–27 World Test Championship cycle for both sides.Veteran all-rounder Chris Woakes makes a return to the Test team for the first time since December, reinforcing England’s seam attack and lower-order batting. Also included is Durham pacer Brydon Carse , who will play his maiden home Test after previously featuring in five away fixtures in Pakistan and New Zealand.The biggest talking point, however, is the retention of Ollie Pope at No.3. Despite mounting competition from 21-year-old Jacob Bethell, Pope has held onto his spot. Bethell had impressed on England’s New Zealand tour last winter and showed his talent again during the recent white-ball series against West Indies. However, he opted to play the IPL with Royal Challengers Bengaluru instead of the recent Zimbabwe Test, where Pope staked his claim with a commanding 171.Still, Pope’s form against India and Australia remains a concern.The vice-captain averages just 24.60 against India and a paltry 15.70 in Ashes Tests. Despite the stats, captain Ben Stokes backed Pope and dismissed suggestions of a bias toward Bethell, calling the speculation an “agenda.”England have made two changes to the team that defeated Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge. Woakes comes in for the injured Gus Atkinson, and Carse replaces Sam Cook. Wicketkeeper Jamie Smith retains his place, adding depth to the middle order.With Stokes leading a well-rounded side and multiple bowling options at his disposal, England will look to make a strong start.India, led by new skipper Shubman Gill , aim to end a 18-year wait for a series win on English soil.

NEW DELHI: As the cricketing world braces for the highly anticipated five-match Test series between India and England starting June 20 at Headingley, a fresh debate has emerged around the best combined India-England Test XI of the post-2000 era.Former England captain Nasser Hussain recently shared his picks, sparking discussion by omitting Indian skipper Rohit Sharma from his lineup.While naming modern greats like Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, and Joe Root as “non-negotiables” in his combined XI, Hussain opted for a more aggressive opening pair with England’s Alastair Cook and India’s Virender Sehwag.""Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, and Joe Root are non-negotiable... Listen, I like Rohit Sharma, but I think Virender Sehwag in Test match cricket in those 25 years and also Alastair Cook, oh, what a beautiful combination it would be!” he remarked during a segment with fellow former cricketer Michael Atherton.Hussain also offered a blunt assessment of India’s chances in the upcoming series, predicting a 3-1 victory in favour of England.In his Mail Sport column, he emphasised the importance of home advantage and the absence of key Indian batters like Kohli and Rohit, penning: “India will miss the runs and experience of those two. England’s home form and bowling attack should prove decisive.”Echoing similar confidence, ex-off-spinner Graeme Swann called the series a perfect build-up to the Ashes, backing England to win 4-1. “We need to beat India at home after being outplayed in their conditions. With Kohli and Rohit not in the mix, this is our chance.”India’s squad will be led by Shubman Gill, with Rishabh Pant as vice-captain, while England fields a strong side under Ben Stokes.

Nick Knight EXCLUSIVE: On Shubman Gill and absence of Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma in England

NEW DELHI: India's Test vice-captain and wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant has confirmed a major change in the batting line-up ahead of the first Test against England at Headingley, Leeds, starting Friday, June 20.Addressing the media on Wednesday, Pant revealed that skipper Shubman Gill will move down the order to bat at No.4 - a position long occupied by the now-retired Virat Kohli - marking a significant shift in India's batting structure after the recent exits of both Kohli and former captain Rohit Sharma.""I think there is still discussion going on about who is going to play at No.3. But 4 and 5 are definitely fixed. Shubman is going to bat at 4 and I am going to stick to No.5 as of now,"" Pant said.Gill, who began his Test journey as an opener, had shifted to No.3 recently to make room for Yashasvi Jaiswal . His move to No.4 is seen as a bid to solidify India's middle order during this transitional phase.Pant also spoke about his strong rapport with Gill. ""Me and Shubman have a really good camaraderie off the field. If you're good friends off the field, it eventually shows on the field.The comfort zone we have with each other is going to be really special,"" he added.With England also in transition, missing legends James Anderson and Stuart Broad due to retirement, Pant admitted there was relief but urged caution.""Definitely, it feels good when both (Anderson and Broad) are not there. But we can't take the current bowling attack lightly. They have enough firepower, and we have to respect them,"" Pant said.India haven't won a Test series in England since 2007. Their closest shot came in 2021 when they led 2-1 before the COVID-delayed fifth Test was lost in 2022, resulting in a drawn series.The five-Test series will now be contested for the newly minted Tendulkar-Anderson Trophy, symbolizing the evolving legacy of this storied rivalry.","India's Test vice-captain Rishabh Pant has confirmed a major change in the batting line-up ahead of the first Test against England at Headingley, Leeds, starting Friday, June 20.

Gautam Gambhir sends stern message after Bengaluru tragedy

You mentioned new a couple of times there. New captain, new vice-captain. To start with... Shubman Gill is young, still a work-in-progress as far as Test cricket and Test batting is concerned. How do you look at Shubman Gill, the Test batter? Do you feel he is ready for the challenge - both as a batter and a captain?

The support he gets and a captain is as good as the team. First, I'll get to the team bit. What were your initial thoughts on the squad? You think it has ticked the right boxes?

One player you would have seen closely is Sai Sudharsan. Not mixing formats here but he is riding that recency bias after a fantastic IPL and has looked very compact. Inspires confidence with his County outings. And the way he has modelled his game to be very correct. Do you reckon he could get a look-in during this tour?

Poll Will KL Rahul perform consistently in the upcoming Test series? Yes, he's experienced. No, he often tapers off. It depends on the conditions.

I think this team is in the same situation as Dhoni's team when they embarked on the first T20 World Cup. There are no expectations. So, that is a big advantage WV Raman

Everybody is saying that this will be Gautam Gambhir's team now, more than it would be Shubman Gill's. What do you make of that, coach? And how important is this an assignment for Gautam Gambhir?

Nick Knight EXCLUSIVE: On Shubman Gill and absence of Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma in England

Before I let you go, I'll put you on a spot there as I always like to do. Your prediction for the series, coach. Who's winning this one? And by what scoreline?

That's a diplomatic answer, coach. You gotta give me a scoreline.

The five Tests against England is going to be a tough assignment for new captain Shubman Gill and head coach Gautam Gambhir . Former India cricketer WV Raman feels Gill & Co. are in the same situation as MS Dhoni 's team was back during the 2007 T20 World Cup, a tournament they won against all expectations.In an exclusive chat with TimesofIndia.com, Raman speaks about India's squad, the challenge of five Tests, India's ideal batting order and more.It's a good thing it's a five-Test series because the side can (make a) comeback. And for a young Indian side like this, with a new captain, new vice-captain, just about everything being new there, the five-Test series is ideal. And of course, as far as the change of the trophy's name is concerned, that's up to the administrators. We got to try and get on with it. And I'm sure that it'll be a very exciting series, this one.Now, whatever we've seen of Shubman Gill in Test cricket has given you the confidence that he's capable of performing in that format as well.He did get useful runs in the tough, hard-fought series in Australia. Of course, England can always test the best batters. But again, that was at the start of his career. And we have a Shubman Gill here who's seen a lot of things already, even though he's 25. He's got a lot of experience. He's been around for a while with the Indian team. He's been playing different formats. And he's also developed that sense of accepting responsibility and dealing with responsibility by virtue of becoming the captain of the franchisee side in the IPL.So, it's all a matter of him bringing into play the learnings that he's had over a period of time. And for a young captain, what is important is the kind of support that he gets in terms of inputs from the other experienced members in the side. And of course, to just repeat the cliché, a captain is only as good as his team. A young captain needs his team to measure up, raise the bar and perform together. And that's when a young captain will probably be capable of overcoming the challenges on a tough tour such as this.Spinners, yes, we've ticked the boxes. And even batting, maybe one-half of it. It's just that the other half will depend on the slot that is provided to the batters, that's given to the batters. And the role allocation, I think that is what will depend on. It depends on who bats on which number.And also, who it is that they want to be a part of this batting unit will be very important. Because we got the likes of (Abhimanyu) Easwaran and Karun Nair who almost forced their way into the side by sheer weight of their runs over a period of time. Now, the question is the level of confidence that the team management has on these two to give them the chances first up in the series.No, let's not forget that Easwaran has been getting runs much higher than him over a long period of time. We have been having Easwaran as a part of the squad. We are not playing him. And that is again creating a lot of dilemma when the next selection comes up. We will have to try and reward him fully in the sense that there is no point picking him in the squad. We don't have, let's say, a player who has opened in the past, who is willing to open. There is a vacant slot at the top of the order. And here you have on the other hand, you have a player who has been opening right through his life, who has got runs every season almost. And then you pick him in the squad. When there is an opening slot which is vacant, you don't use him. I think we need to first answer that particular bit. Again, we have got somebody who is making a comeback after a long period of time. And then he is not a spring onion now. He is into his 30s. He is experienced. He is also in the best of form.You just mentioned Karun Nair. Someone who is coming back on good run in the domestic circuit, found his second wind, did well in the IPL on a couple of occasions, double-hundred for the India A set-up. But then one player who continues to slip under the radar is KL Rahul. He starts a series in very emphatic fashion but then kind of tapers off. How important are these nine Tests going to be for KL Rahul - five away and then four at home.Yeah, this has also happened on his last tour of England. He started off well and then he tapered down and this is something that has happened. We all know that. But again, still the fact of the matter is that he is experienced, he has got runs, he is capable of runs, he gives you the impression that he can get runs. So, he also is aware of the fact that he needs to step up as far as consistency is concerned. Now, the matter is very straightforward. You play him in the first three test matches, you see how he goes about it. Obviously, if he does well, you will continue him and then he has got to be told, yes, we are very well aware of the fact that you are talented, you have performed in all the three formats. Now, the time has come for you to up it in terms of consistency and a message has to be conveyed to him.And that's the way to go about it. Failing which, you are anyway in a transition period. You got to try and look for other options.It's not all about the coach all the time. Yes, we all know Gambhir is a good tactician. He's also a very intense man. And he's also got the best interest of the team at heart. So, we got to try and forget the fact that everything should be related to the coach. We didn't do this with his predecessors. We are doing it with him, if you remember. So, coach is always somebody who's got to stay in the background. We should allow the coach to do his job. And he's going to take all the decisions based on how he sees things. Because he's the one who is completely aware of what is exactly happening with each and every individual in the side. And then as far as this team is concerned, this will always be a team under the title of a captain who is successful. People are not calling this the Rohit's team until he started succeeding as a captain in white ball cricket. The same happened with Virat in red ball cricket. So, it gets dubbed as the captain's team when he starts doing well when he stays put for a long period of time as a captain. But as far as this particular team is concerned, even though there's a lot of apprehension about how the series will pan out, I for one think this team is in the same situation as Dhoni's team when they embarked on the first T20 World Cup. There are no expectations. So, that is a big advantage for this side. That's a real big advantage for this side. And they have everything to gain. The only way is up.And I think therein lies this team to spring a surprise. Because let's not forget that even though India has not won many series in England, we've always sprung a lot of surprises there. Starting from Chandra's (Bhagwath Chandrasekhar) spell and Ajit Wadekar 's series win in 1971, India has sprung a surprise or two always in England.All I would like to see this team do is to play good cricket. I am not a great fan of this numbers game.A pragmatic answer. You always put people in a spot. I always give pragmatic answers.","Former India cricketer WV Raman feels Gill & Co. are in the same situation as MS Dhoni's team was back during the 2007 T20 World Cup.

Poll Will the absence of Mohammed Shami impact India's performance in the series? Yes, he is a key player. No, we have strong alternatives.

Former India head coach Ravi Shastri and bowling coach Bharat Arun revealed how Mohammed Shami 's anger over a plate of biryani during lunch led to a match-winning performance against South Africa in Johannesburg in 2018. The incident occurred on the fourth day of the final Test match when South Africa needed 223 runs with eight wickets in hand to complete a series whitewash.The hosts had already secured the series by winning the first two matches. By lunch on the fourth day, South Africa had reduced the deficit to 171 runs with seven wickets remaining.During the lunch break, Shastri noticed Shami with a large serving of biryani on his plate while walking past.""It was Johannesburg. Final day. There was enough heat in that game. That match on the last day, they needed 240, just 100 runs to get. Eight wickets in hand. It was lunchtime and as I was walking past, Shami's plate. He had a massive helping of biryani there,"" Shastri recounted onBharat Arun shared that Shastri approached Shami and questioned him about his hunger after seeing the biryani.""Ravi walked across and asked him, 'tera bhook idhar theek ho gaya kya?'

Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova is set to return to the All England Club this year after being awarded a wild card for the main draw of the 2025 tournament. The Czech star, who won Wimbledon titles in 2011 and 2014, last played at the grass-court Grand Slam in 2023 and has been making a comeback following a 17-month maternity leave.

She first lifted the Venus Rosewater Dish in 2011 after defeating Maria Sharapova in the final. She claimed her second Wimbledon crown in 2014 by beating Eugenie Bouchard. Despite a lengthy break from the sport, including recovery from a serious hand injury sustained during a home invasion in 2016, Kvitova has remained a formidable competitor on grass courts.Alongside Kvitova, seven British players have been awarded wild cards for the women’s singles draw. Notable names include Heather Watson, Harriet Dart, and Jodie Burrage.On the men’s side, British number one Dan Evans is among seven players granted wild cards, with one more men’s wild card yet to be announced.

Don Cherry claims the Boston Bruins plotted Brad Marchand return



Stanley Cup win and GM comments add intrigue



After helping lead the Florida Panthers to their second Stanley Cup, Brad Marchand has cemented himself as the hottest name entering NHL free agency. The former Boston Bruins captain scored 10 goals and totaled 20 points over 23 playoff games.This is proving instrumental in the Panthers' run, and his ability to perform in big moments has only boosted his value. And with July 1 fast approaching, teams are lining up.Don Cherry, the legendary and often controversial voice of Canadian hockey, stirred the pot this week with a stunning theory about Marchand’s trade. On his podcast, Cherry proposed that the Bruins and Panthers might have secretly agreed to a one-year arrangement, allowing Marchand to return to Boston after the 2025 season. According to Cherry, the plan was for Florida to sign him temporarily for the Cup push, with Boston reclaiming their former captain this summer.As the Panthers lifted the Cup after a dominant Game 6 win over the Edmonton Oilers, Marchand stood at the center of the celebration. General manager Bill Zito even joked about buying a Dairy Queen franchise to convince Marchand to stay, while the comment, lighthearted as it was, underlined how valuable Marchand has become to Florida’s locker room and on-ice chemistry.Despite this, uncertainty lingers. Marchand is now in a rare position of power as a veteran leader. He is a proven performer, and free agent with Cup-winning momentum. Whether Cherry’s theory holds any truth remains unknown, but one thing is certain, Marchand’s next move could reshape the NHL landscape.Read more: Spicy moment as Jim Matheson annoys Connor McDavid again with a question Oilers fans hated For now, Don Cherry’s conspiracy may simply be wishful thinking.

Brock Lesnar made an appearance with his old look outside WWE

Brock Lesnar has undergone a change in his appearance amidst a prolonged WWE hiatus.Brock Lesnar is enjoying life outside professional wrestling. The Beast Incarnate has been spotted in multiple outside appearances. A while ago, Lesnar surprised the audience by sporting a long-haired look seen at a wedding. However, the latest photo emerging showed that he has reverted to his old style.In a recent photo surfacing on social media, Brock Lesnar was spotted at the Powerhouse Gym. However, he no longer had long hair, but his classic cowboy look became highly popular in WWE. Lesnar had tried out a long hair look for the first time in his life. However, it seems that it did not match his personality, or he simply found it too much trouble to handle, and hence decided to undergo the transformation.Brock Lesnar had been a top draw for WWE for many years. He rose to prominence in his first run back in the early 2000s. He further attained more fame for his stint in the UFC. In 2012, Lesnar returned to WWE after eight years and began wrestling as a part-time attraction.Upon his return to the company, he battled top names like John Cena, Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins, and more. Moreover, he famously ended The Undertaker's undefeated streak at WrestleMania 30.His last appearance on WWE television was at the SummerSlam 2023 Premium Live Event. He lost a highly enthralling and spectacular bout to Cody Rhodes and endorsed him following the match. He went on hiatus and was set to make his return at the start of 2024. However, the Anomaly's name was linked to the lawsuit filed by Janel Grant against Vince McMahon and John Laurinaitis on the charges of s*x trafficking and s*xual misconduct.At the start of 2025, Lesnar's name officially came up in the amended lawsuit. Moreover, a fan on social media stated that Lesnar told him that he had retired from professional wrestling.

Giannis Antetokounmpo’s wife, Mariah Riddlesprigger does not want her husband to fall for streaming



Money has a loud noise, and everyone seems to fall for it, even Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo. In a recent clip, having a chat with his wife Mariah Riddlesprigger, Antetokounmpo shared that he wants to stream and make loads of money. However, the idea was straightaway declined by his wife, who reminded him of existing responsibilities on his hands.Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo may be one of the NBA ’s most dominant forces on the court, but off the hardwood, he’s considering an entirely different arena, live streaming. In a playful interaction with his wife, Mariah Riddlesprigger, Giannis opened up about his desire to step into the world of online content creation, sparking interest across social media and the streaming community.During a now-viral TikTok Live, Giannis turned to his fans and asked, “Should I start streaming? IShowSpeed, Kai Cenat, help a brother out!” The questioncertainly showed his genuine curiosity about diving into the booming world of streaming.Giannis praised both Kai Cenat and IShowSpeed, calling them engaging and excellent at what they do. “I’ve seen them how they’re doing it, they’re actually good at it. Engaging, they’re very good!” he said.The two popular streamers, who have built massive audiences on Twitch and YouTube, were name-dropped repeatedly as Giannis contemplated following their lead. His interest appears to be more than a passing thought, it’s part of a larger trend of elite athletes exploring ways to connect with fans beyond traditional sports media.However, not everyone in the Antetokounmpo household was sold on the idea. His wife, Mariah, quickly offered a practical perspective. When Giannis asked why he shouldn’t pursue streaming, she immediately rejected the idea, “Because we have four kids and a lot of other responsibilities.” The couple's humorous back-and-forth continued, as Giannis tried to justify the venture by pointing out the financial upside. “Do you know how much money they make? They make a lot of money, baby.”Even though he already has a lucrative NBA contract— with $54 million set for the upcoming season and nearly $300 million earned in his career— Giannis seems intrigued by the challenge and creativity of streaming. He recently returned from a vacation in Brazil and appeared refreshed and reflective, perhaps setting the stage for new endeavors during what he called “the greatest offseason of all time.”“Basically, I’m having my own podcast without doing nothing,” Giannis joked. “People are out here asking me questions.” His wife quipped in response, “Which is what streamers do, right?”Also Read: Who is Mark Walter?

Four words, big message — Shedeur Sanders breaks the silence



QB battle brewing — Sanders eyes the top job

Shedeur Sanders may be new to the NFL, but he’s already making waves in Cleveland. During a recent Browns training camp appearance, the former Colorado Buffaloes star sparked discussion with quiet confidence and sharp intent. As quarterback competition builds behind Deshaun Watson, Sanders isn’t just learning—he’s making a statement.While interacting with a group of kids at camp, Sanders was asked whether he expects to start over veteran Joe Flacco. He didn’t hesitate before replying, “We got preseason first.” It was short, cold, and calculated—enough to grab attention across the league and stir debate in the locker room.The Browns are reportedly weighing the rare option of retaining all four quarterbacks on the roster—Watson, Flacco, Dorian Thompson-Robinson, and Sanders—due to cost-effective contracts. But for Sanders, merely making the 53-man squad isn’t enough. He has his sights set on something bigger, the starting role.Flacco, a Super Bowl XLVII winner, brings leadership and experience. But at 40, questions loom about longevity and mobility. Sanders, on the other hand, enters with fresh legs, athletic upside, and a reputation for thriving under pressure—attributes he developed playing under his father, Deion Sanders, in college.Inside Browns camp, early signs point to Sanders impressing the coaching staff with his timing, poise, and football IQ. But the real test lies ahead. With the NFL preseason set to begin in August, live reps will reveal whether the rookie can truly challenge veterans like Flacco.Also read: Nick Chubb signs with Texans, but Cleveland chapter might not be over yet Whether his four-word response was quiet confidence or subtle shade, one thing is clear—Sanders isn’t in Cleveland to play backup.

Georgia football recruiting scores big with OT Ekene Ogboko

Ekene Ogboko's commitment boosts Georgia's offensive line future

“They made it clear I was a priority,” he said. “I wanted a place that can get me to the league, and Georgia does that.”

Four-star offensive tackle Ekene Ogboko, a top-tier 2026 lineman, chose to pledge to the University of Georgia. The 6-6’, 270-pound product from Durham, N.C., picked the Bulldogs over Clemson, Florida, and Notre Dame. The move provides a huge boost to Georgia's offensive line future and pairs him up with his older brother, Nnamdi Ogboko, who currently plays on the Bulldogs' defensive line.Ogboko had enjoyed an active spring with officials at Clemson, Georgia, and Florida before the decision. The standout offensive lineman became a major target for Georgia's coaches, especially head coach Kirby Smart, after the Bulldogs lost out on elite OT prospects early in the cycle. The Bulldogs held on and landed one of the most physically gifted and technically sound offensive linemen in the 2026 class.Georgia has the recruiting win by landing Ogboko, as the Bulldogs lost ground earlier in the process to Miami and USC for other elite tackles. His versatility and upside alone make him a candidate to compete for early playing time, considering Georgia's relative uncertainty in its offensive line depth chart at the moment.As the fourth top-50 recruit to commit to the Bulldogs this cycle, Ogboko joins quarterback Jared Curtis and defensive backs Justice Fitzpatrick and Zechariah Fort.From scouting reports, Ogboko is described as possessing size, raw power, and impressive footwork, all traits that give him high-end potential as an edge prospect. He should be a multi-year starter who plays his way into the NFL Draft as well, and he's an ideal fit in the Georgia pipeline of great offensive linemen. Having the ability to play on either side of the line allows him to provide some very important versatility to Georgia's trenches of the future.Also Read: 'Keep em coming': 4-star RB Javian Osborne reacts to prediction for Devin Fitzgerald to Notre Dame Family was another important aspect of his decision.

Ravens' defense adds Jaire Alexander to elite secondary unit

Lamar Jackson 's recruitment and Ravens culture influence the signing

The Baltimore Ravens opened up the news cycle with an absolute bombshell, signing former Green Bay Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander to a one-year deal worth up to $6 million. Now, the Ravens not only add further depth to their secondary with this, but they send a message to the entire AFC as well. We are all in for a Super Bowl in 2025.Adding Jaire Alexander makes for one of the more talented secondaries in all of football for the Ravens. They would pair him with fellow Pro Bowler Marlon Humphrey, top draft pick Nate Wiggins, and star safety Kyle Hamilton. Baltimore would now boast one of the most elite and versatile defensive backfields in the league. Alexander, a two-time Pro Bowler, boasts 70 pass breakups, 12 career interceptions, and one of the best reputations as a man-to-man cover corner in the league.Even with him dealing with some injuries lately, the sky still has always been the limit for Alexander. His coverage grades on PFF are consistently among the best in the league when healthy. The Ravens smartly laid out the contract in terms of performance-based bonuses, thereby putting minimal risk into betting on Alexander returning to form. Baltimore's improved defense may be just the thing that gets the Ravens over the hump in the playoffs in an AFC where they want to be more pass-heavy with the quarterbacks like Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen prolific in the league.Alexander's decision to sign with Baltimore was heavily impacted by Lamar Jackson, his former teammate at Louisville. Jackson himself is said to have contacted Alexander and has reportedly even pushed the Ravens' front office to pick him up. And that familiarity, coupled with a winning culture and Super Bowl expectations, put Baltimore at the top of the market for Williams, even over other offers that included more lucrative dollar signsAlso Read: Three men charged in shooting that paralyzed aspiring college football star in Brooklyn Park The Ravens keep reinforcing that this is a player-led, Super Bowl-or-bust organization. Jackson's leadership off the field is now catching up to his MVP-caliber performances on it. GM Eric DeCosta showed the Ravens can still make impactful moves by listening to his franchise quarterback and delivering what he wanted. Alexander's arrival is just the type of addition that takes a strong contender and transforms them into a legitimate favorite in the AFC.","The Baltimore Ravens signed former Green Bay Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander to a one-year deal worth up to $6 million.

Basketball season has been getting very heated lately, with teams deciding on which player to keep and which player not to. As it gets interesting, the team Milwaukee Bucks has been a pretty strong contender since 2018, who also managed to secure an NBA title in 2021. But currently, the team has been struggling. They also had to make an exit during the playoffs at least three times, which hasn’t worked in their favor. Fans are frustrated with the entire fiasco. They have not appreciated how the Milwaukee Bucks aren't taking the entire issue seriously, and how Giannis is the one carrying the entire team on his own.NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo remains a loyal face, but now, with the Milwaukee Bucks almost struggling and having been on a turning point, the situation is very different. The team has to decide now, whether they will rebuild the entire strategy, or try working around Giannis, despite facing issues pertaining to a limited draft pick and salary cap that the players will have to manage with. Some fans took to X, where they shared their opinions on the same issue. While a few of them believe Milwaukee Bucks needs to rebuild itself, and have urged the team to trade Giannis, now, that his value is important, other fans remain divided as they question whether or not Bucks has that much in their assets to push for more expensive players.A fan said, “Giannis looking like a one-man army out there! Bucks better find him some help quick, or he might just carry the whole team to the trade block himself!”While another fan reacted, saying, “Just trade the man. Soon as they traded Jrue and Middleton got old and they didn't have a replacement for him, the Bucks were over with.”Another fan believed, “Milwaukee is cooked, need to trade Giannis while they still can and get some value to start the rebuild.”Another fan reacted, saying, “I doubt there's anything the Bucks can do to keep him in Milwaukee. Imagine the haul they can get for him, though.”A fan claimed, “The Bucks are in a really tough spot. They can aggressively talk all they want, they however just don't have anything worth enough value for any championship level leap.”Another fan suggested, “Bucks should try to sign Schröder, Grimes and Aldama, bring back Gary Trent Jr and KPJ. Then salary dump Connaughton for a second round pick and trade Kuzma for anything. Not a contender but it would be far better than last year.”Also Read: ""I Would Never Give Up"" - Complete Giannis Antetokounmpo's Journey From Pauper To Multi-Millionaire NBA Champion It will be interesting to see how the situation turns out for the Milwaukee Bucks, now that NBA teams are working on rebuilding strategies with newer players.","NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo remains a loyal face, but now, with the Milwaukee Bucks almost struggling and having been on a turning point, the situation is very different.

""I believe the best quarterback right now is Josh Allen,""

""I think he's become the guy. For years, it was Patrick Mahomes... The start of Mahomes's career was absolutely mind blowing. The last couple of years though, he's not been that guy, and really, it's been Josh Allen.""

""Allen's combination of freak show 'wow' plays, like everything he can do with his arm, the cheat code that is his short yardage ability, his athleticism. The fact that he basically does not take sacks, one of the lowest pressure-to-sack rates you're going to find anywhere. Utterly absurd analytics numbers behind him as well.
