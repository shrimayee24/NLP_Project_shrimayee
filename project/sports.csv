NEW DELHI: In a surprising development, India's star wrestler Vinesh Phogat , who was a strong favourite for a gold medal, was disqualified from the Paris 2024 Olympics finals on Wednesday morning.The disqualification was due to a sudden increase in her weight, which prevented her from competing against the United States' Ann Hildebrandt in the women's 50 kg wrestling final.Phogat had successfully weighed in at 49.90 kg on Tuesday morning, allowing her to compete in her first match of the day. She went on to win three bouts, including the semi-final. However, her weight unexpectedly increased to approximately 52.7 kg, resulting in her disqualification.In response, the Indian wrestling team , determined to resolve the issue, enlisted the help of Dr. Dinshaw Pardiwala , a renowned sports orthopedic surgeon . Chef de Mission Gagan Narang, along with Dr. Pardiwala, Phogat's husband, physiotherapist, medical staff, and officials from the Indian Olympic Association, worked tirelessly through the night to help Phogat meet the weight requirements.Despite their best efforts, they were unable to reduce her weight in time. Reports indicate that Dr. Pardiwala emphasized that Phogat's health was paramount and that compromising her well-being was not an option.Dr. Dinshaw Pardiwala is a highly esteemed expert in sports medicine. He recently performed surgery on wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant and has treated many notable cricketers, including Sachin Tendulkar, Yuvraj Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, and Ravindra Jadeja.With over two decades of experience, he currently serves as the Director of Arthroscopy and Shoulder Service at Kokilaben Hospital in Mumbai. In recognition of his contributions to arthroscopic surgery, he received the prestigious ICOS John Joyce Award in 2009.Despite this setback, Phogat's accomplishment of becoming the first Indian female wrestler to reach the Olympic finals remains a significant milestone for Indian wrestling.","Vinesh Phogat was disqualified from the Paris 2024 Olympics finals on Wednesday morning.

"But for my recurring groin injury, I could’ve thrown 4m further: Neeraj Chopra",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/but-for-my-recurring-groin-injury-i-couldve-thrown-4m-further-neeraj/articleshow/112415339.cms,"‘I still have many good throws left in me’

PARIS: When Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem cleared 92.97 metres with his effortless second throw in the javelin final Thursday night, the pressure was on Neeraj Chopra to better it.The Indian believed he could do it, but in his desperation to go past his Pakistani rival’s mark, he ended up with four foul throws. Trying to come to terms with his first loss to Nadeem since 2016, Neeraj, who threw 89.45m and bagged silver, said a nagging groin injury has been bothering him.“When I get ready for my throws, 70-80% of my focus is on my injury as I don’t want to aggravate it. My speed drops and so I start pushing myself. Before the last World Championships , the doctor had advised me to go for surgery . But I didn’t have the time. I couldn’t do it before Olympics either. But (now) I will have to make a big decision,” the current world champion said here after the event, adding that the same throw could have been four metres further had he been in perfect shape.Despite the disappointment of not winning back-to-back Olympic gold, many consider Neeraj the greatest-ever Indian athlete. He, though, remains humble. “It’s been a great journey after starting from a small village,” he said.Starting off, Neeraj never believed he would be on the Olympic podium one day. “I didn’t have the physique or the background. I don’t know how I reached this far,” Neeraj said.Talking about his injury, “It was in 2017 that I felt the groin pain for the first time and after that I had a lot of treatment. At the beginning of this year, everything was perfect. Maybe (I have to undergo) surgery… I will speak to my team and make a decision,” Neeraj said. The champion athlete had tried to play down the injury in the build-up to the Olympics, but now that it’s all down, he was ready to explain how difficult it was. “I was not able to throw using my full runway for the last couple of years.Normally, we make 40-50 throws in each session. But in my case the session itself was happening once every two or three weeks because of the injury scare. Till you throw, you are not working with the javelin and then it is very difficult to lift it. But now I’m throwing because I have the belief in my hand,” Neeraj said. The champion said he won’t rest till he manages the big throws.“I still have many good throws left in me. Until I achieve that, I won’t get peace. I now realise that mindset is very important going into an Olympics. I will surely do it if my body is willing to come along as my mind will be ready. If you can stay away from injury, then your throw gets bigger and bigger,” the 26-year-old said. Neeraj’s first throw on Thursday was a foul, but that didn’t affect his confidence.“After the foul in the first throw, I had confidence ahead of the second throw that I could do it. I was pushing myself a lot but the throw was good and I can tell you that I still have a lot of big throws left in me. For that I have to keep myself fit.” Asked what changed between the qualification when he appeared in great form and the final, the 26-year-old said: “In the qualification round it’s all easy and relaxed. But finals are different. I tried to keep my mind the same but it was hard. I tried to go really fast on the runway but it didn’t work.Even in qualification I was really close to the line but I stopped within one step.” The pulls and pressures of commercial commitments become part and parcel of a top athlete’s life, but Neeraj has learnt to take that in his stride.“After Tokyo, I gave priority to sports. With great difficulty we get a chance to endorse a brand. So if you get a chance then who will leave it? But I don’t want to overdo it, because if my body breaks, nothing will be left.” Neeraj was tired but his sense of humour was intact. “Motivating myself to talk in English is almost like being in competition with the best in the business,” he said as everyone burst into laughter.","Arshad Nadeem cleared 92.97 metres with his effortless second throw in the javelin final.

Jagmander Singh and Virender Dahiya , senior Indian coaches, led the rigorous weight-cutting regime.Following the mat session, he endured a one-hour hot-bath session.At 12:30 am, Aman moved to the gym for a non-stop one-hour treadmill run to induce sweating and weight loss.A brief 30-minute break was given before engaging in five 5-minute sessions of the sauna bath.By the end of the sauna sessions, Aman's weight was still 900 grams above the limit.He then received a massage and was instructed to do light jogging.

Aman

beats Cruz to clinch sixth medal for India

PARIS: Aman Sehrawat is just 21 but mature way beyond his age. He has been to hell and back.He lost both his parents when he was just 11 years old. His mother took her own life after battling mental illness for years. His father also died soon after. Aman battled depression and tried to take drugs to forget his pain.He was in a dark place. But his uncle Sudhir Sehrawat was a pillar of support. He backed his nephew to concentrate on his wrestling career , take his mind off negative thoughts. His grandfather Mangeram also motivated him.Inspired by Olympian Sushil Kumar 's exploits, Aman had joined Chhatrasal Stadium in Delhi two years before his father passed away. With his uncle holding his hand now, life changed. Aman found peace on the mat. He had a mission in life. He made steady progress, kept reaching new milestones and made newspaper headlines when he became the first Indian to win a gold medal at U-23 World Wrestling Championship .On Friday evening, at the Champs de Mars stadium, a makeshift arena right next to the Eiffel Tower, Aman took on Puerto Rico's Darian Cruz in the 57kg freestylebronze medal match, a weight category in which Ravi Dahiya had won silver for India in Tokyo.Aman dominated his seasoned 29-yearold rival, a three-time medallist at the Pan American Games. After an initial contest, he won comfortably at 13-5. The bronze medal was India's, the country's fifth medal at the Games here.In the first period, Cruz took the lead by grabbing Aman's left leg and pushing him out of the orange circle. 1-0. Aman tried hard to draw level and went up 2-1 soon as he pinned Cruz to the mat. Cruz returned the compliment to go 3-2 up.It was very close at this stage. But Aman started gaining confidence and started attacking more, lunging at Cruz's legs to get the crucial points. He managed to do that midway through the period, to get two points for a 4-3 lead. The Puerto Rican seemed to be tiring now and just before the hooter, Aman got a good grip, Cruz went down to avoid a takedown and Aman was 6-3 ahead.In the second period, Cruz came back determined and got two points. Aman was just a point ahead at 6-5 now. It could have gone either way, but Aman was not giving up. He took two points to go 8-5 ahead. There were just two minutes left for the final hooter. He was looking in control.At this point, Cruz opted for a break, pointing to his left knee. He was trying to catch his breath against the young Indian. After the medical assistance, Cruz was back on the mat, looking a bit tired. Aman saw that and went in for the kill. His strategy was simple. He attacked his rival by grabbing his leg, forcing him to go down and then got on top for two points.With a minute and 7 seconds to go, it was 10-5. With just 45 seconds left, it became 12-5. There was no way Cruz was coming back. Aman secured another point to emerge an easy winner and ran to his coach to celebrate his medal.Hailing from village Birohar in Haryana's Jhajjar district, Aman had a keen interest in mud wrestling as a kid. The move to the mat changed his life.The 21-year-old, the lone Indian in the men's section, had a good outing on Thursday here, posting two big wins to race through the pre-quarters and quarterfinals of the 57kg freestyle.In the quarterfinals, Sehrawat was up against Albania's Zelimkhan Abakarov. The verdict was 12-0 in the Indian's favour as he rattled up the points over the two periods. He had lost to Akabarov at the senior World Championships.Aman lost to his Japanese opponent in the semifinals but returned on Friday to fight for bronze. He was hungry, he was determined. He was the better wrestler.This medal would give some solace to India's wrestling contingent which was in a shock after Vinesh's disqualification. It came as a much-needed balm.","Aman Sehrawat is the first Indian to win a gold medal at U-23 World Wrestling Championship.

Together, we faced some of the best fast bowlers in world cricket and naturally, we would be worried about how to handle the situation. Jab koi saath mein opening karta hai, you interact a lot with each other. A day before the match, we would sit down and discuss how to face the fast bowlers the next day. That’s how we became friends.”He adds, “I knew that he was unwell for a while. But still, you always hope for the best and think that your friend will recover. Losing him has been a tough blow.”Bahut afsos hai, I am at a loss for words. As a player, I learnt a lot of things from him.I knew him (Anshuman) for a very long time and have fond memories of playing badminton together. The way he bravely faced fast bowlers as a player was inspiring. Apart from being a terrific batsman, he was also a great captain for Baroda and played a key role in guiding young cricketers from the city. Very few former cricketers have contributed so much to the game. We will miss him.His demise is a huge loss for our country. He was very respectful towards everyone and shared a great bond with our family.

There were not a lot of runs scored down the ground. They did not use the feet as much as we expected. It was about using sweeps and piercing that deep square leg and midwicket field. That is something we failed to do as a batting unit. We did not play enough sweeps, reverse sweeps, or paddle sweeps, and used our feet too much. That was the difference,"" said Rohit.""If you look at Kusal Mendis and Avishka Fernando today [who put on an 82-run stand], they got a lot of runs square of the wicket. They were using the turn, and sweeping, making the fielder move left and right. They were smart with how they batted and we were not,"" he added.The Indian captain acknowledged that the Men in Blue were under siege from Lankan spinners rather than dominating against them. Additionally, he stated that players are allowed to devise their own strategies for overcoming spin and playing on turning tracks.""It starts with your training, When you get to your sessions, I can see the guys are working hard in the nets whenever we get the opportunity to train as well. I do not see there being a lack of effort when we want to try and play different shots,"" he added.According to Rohit, it's crucial to score as many runs as you can during the first ten overs of the powerplay because these pitches slow down later on.""My personal effort was to ensure that I score as many runs as I could. It was not as if I wanted to throw my wicket away after the powerplay. I wanted to continue the momentum and intent, but I unfortunately got dismissed while trying to play a few shots.
