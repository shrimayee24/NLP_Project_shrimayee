The Mumbai Indians (MI), one of the most successful franchises in Indian Premier League (IPL) history, are set to enter the 2025 IPL mega auction with a clear strategy and a strong financial position. Scheduled to be held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on November 24-25, the auction is expected to be highly competitive as teams look to revamp their squads for the upcoming season.MI, who endured a disappointing 2024 season finishing last in the 10-team league, will have Rs 45 crore remaining in their auction purse. With five IPL titles under their belt, MI will be looking to strengthen their squad by adding key players across different departments. They also hold one strategic Right to Match (RTM) card, allowing them to potentially retain a player by matching the highest bid during the auction.In preparation for the mega auction, MI confirmed the retention of five key players who form the backbone of their team. These retentions have used up a significant portion of their total auction budget of Rs 120 crore. Here's a breakdown of the retained players and the amounts spent:This retention cost MI a total of Rs 75 crore, leaving them with Rs 45 crore to spend at the auction. These players bring a wealth of experience and talent, with Bumrah as the bowling spearhead and Suryakumar Yadav, who is also India’s T20I captain, leading their dynamic batting lineup. Notably, Rohit Sharma, who recently retired from T20 Internationals after leading India to a T20 World Cup win, remains a pivotal figure for MI despite stepping down as captain. His leadership duties have been handed over to Hardik Pandya, who returned to MI after a stint as Gujarat Titans' captain.With Rs 45 crore in hand, MI will look to target crucial areas in their squad. They will be aiming to rebuild after a poor 2024 season, focusing on reinforcing both their batting depth and bowling attack. The presence of an RTM card gives them added flexibility to bring back a former player who might attract high bids.After five retentions, MI have a minimum of 13 slots and a maximum of 20 slots available to fill.Mumbai Indians will have several important slots to fill during the auction, with a focus likely on securing few world-class overseas talents and uncapped Indian cricketers. Additionally, MI could look to bolster their bowling unit to support Jasprit Bumrah, particularly with spinners and pacers who can adapt to different conditions.Having retained their core group of stars, including their new skipper Hardik Pandya and the explosive Suryakumar Yadav, MI now have the challenge of finding the right balance in the rest of their squad to return to their winning ways in 2025.Rs. 45 croreJasprit Bumrah (Rs. 18 crore), Suryakumar Yadav (Rs. 16.35 crore), Hardik Pandya (Rs. 16.35 crore), Rohit Sharma (Rs. 16.30 crore), Tilak Varma (Rs. 8 crore)13 players20 players8 playersAlso See: India vs South Africa Live","IPL mega auction to be held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on November 24-25.

NEW DELHI: Sanju Samson and Tilak Varma delivered sensational centuries as India crushed South Africa by 135 runs in Johannesburg on Friday, sealing the four-match T20I series 3-1 and handing the hosts their heaviest-ever defeat in the format.Opting to bat first, India amassed a colossal 283/1 in 20 overs before skittling South Africa for 148, showcasing dominance in every aspect of the game.Samson smashed his third T20I century in five innings, hammering an unbeaten 109 off 56 balls despite scoring ducks in the other two games. Tilak continued his remarkable form, slamming his second consecutive T20I ton with a blistering 120* off 47 balls, featuring 10 sixes.The duo combined for a record-breaking 210-run partnership for the second wicket off just 85 balls, dismantling South Africa’s bowling attack and sending the ball flying to all corners of the ground.India’s bowlers then piled on the misery, with Arshdeep Singh (3/20) and Hardik Pandya (1/8) reducing the hosts to 10/4 early on. Using the movement off the pitch that South Africa’s bowlers failed to exploit, India effectively ended the contest in the powerplay.

South Africa’s previous biggest T20I defeat was by 111 runs against Australia last year.After the commanding win, captain Suryakumar Yadav praised Tilak, Samson, and Abhishek Sharma for their performances.""There's no secret to adapting to the conditions and situations. Our plans were very clear as soon as we landed in Durban. Last time when we came here, we played the same brand of cricket and wanted to continue that. Though we were up 2-1 in the series, today we wanted to follow the good habits and not worry about the result. It happened naturally,"" Suryakumar said after India won the series 3-1.""[on Tilak, Samson and Abhishek's batting today] It's very difficult for me to choose one good knock from them, it was amazing batting skills displayed by them. We spoke about that and they literally walked the talk. When we toured last year, we knew there was something in this wicket once the lights were on and the temperature dropped. We just followed that, stuck to our lines and the result was right in front of us. It gives a big boost if you are winning any ICC tournament, winning from where we won. It was difficult to sum up what goes through our minds when we won there. It is very challenging when we tour South Africa, to come and win here, this is a special win and will stay with me forever,"" he said.",India crush South Africa by 135 runs to win T20I series 3-1.

Aayush Pandey started from where he had left off the day before as he scripted a well-knit double century on Day 3 to put Chhattisgarh in control of their Ranji Trophy Group D match against Assam in Raipur on Friday.Aided by Pandey’s 211, as well as a couple of useful half-centuries by Eknath Kerkar (50) and Ajay Mondol (69), the hosts declared their first innings on 500/9 and gave the visiting Assam batters a huge task to get something out of the game on the final day.Assam, however, made their own job harder by losing the wicket of opener Rishav Das for a duck in the third over of their second innings and were 58/1. They are trailing by 153 runs when stumps were called on Day 3 at Shaheed Veer Narayan Singh International Cricket Stadium.Earlier, Chhattisgarh resumed their innings on an overnight score of 214/4 with Pandey, on 108, and Kerkar at the crease and soon the duo began dominating the Assam bowlers. They batted with flair and kept moving the scoreboard even as Assam skipper Denish Das tried different options with the ball in search of a breakthrough.However, it was only towards the end of the day’s first session that Kerkar, who had just completed his half-century, gave a catch to RK Das off a Mukhtar Hussain delivery and had to go back to the pavilion. But he and Pandey had already added 124 runs for the fifth wicket as Chhattisgarh looked set for a huge total.There was, however, little respite for the visitors as Mondol joined Pandey in the middle and accumulated another 106 runs in their sixth-wicket partnership before the former was caught leg before by Sibsankar Das.But Pandey still kept adding to the team total as he completed a brilliant double century before being caught and bowled by Rahul Singh on 211 in a 401-ball knock that included 26 boundaries and a sixer.For Assam, Hussain and Singh claimed three wickets each but could not ease the pressure on their batters who have a long day to save the match on the final day.Assam 289 & 58/1 in 16 overs.

Many expected a thrilling end to the open category of the rapid section of Tata Steel India Open Rapid and Blitz meet on Friday with Uzbekistan Nodirbek Abdusattorov breathing down Carlsen’s neck with just half-a-point difference between the two.But in the end Carlsen emerged champion with a round to go as Abdusattorov suffered two losses in the opening two rounds of the last day while Carlsen continued his good run to get past Vincent Keymer and Daniil Dubov.In the ninth and last round, Abdusattorov did provide some scare to Carlsen who managed to hold on for a draw to end with 7.5 points, a good two points more than Wesley So and R Praggnanandhaa , who were tied for second spot. But the Indian’s superior tie-break score earned him the first runner-up position, while So took the third spot. It was a winning comeback for Carlsen who won the tournament in his last visit to the city in 2019.However, it was a disappointing end for the Indian trio as Arjun Erigaisi managed 3.5 points while Vidit Gujrathi and SL Narayanan ended up with three points each.In the women’s category, Russia’s Aleksandra Goryachkina maintained her consistent form to emerge victorious with 7.5 points.

Connor Williams retired from the NFL mid-season to recover from a severe knee injury

A new starting center for the Seattle Seahawks is sorely needed after Connor Williams retired from the NFL mid-season to recover from a severe knee injury he suffered playing in 2023 for the Miami Dolphins. Williams entered the league in 2018 as the No. 50 overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft for the Dallas Cowboys, but initially started there at left guard before being benched after eight weeks. He eventually became a starting left guard after an injury to Zach Martin. Williams has played for the biggest teams in the NFL.Seattle Seahawks starting center Connor Williams has reportedly decided to retire immediately, the team's coach, Mike Macdonald, told reporters on Friday. He also stated that he feels Williams will not reverse the decision and return for the Seahawks to play out this season.Williams was drafted by Dallas Cowboys with the 50th overall pick in the second round of 2018 NFL Draft with the hope of allowing him to play guard. The Cowboys began tabbing him as the starting left guard before benching him during the first eight games in Week 10 and giving way to Xavier Su'a-Filo. He then played the next two games at right guard because of Zack Martin's injury.He signed a two-year deal valued at $14 million on March 17, 2022, to the Miami Dolphins. He quickly became the center and officially named a starter over Michael Deiter as the offseason program began. He played all 17 games, giving up 3 sacks and 6 penalties. He was the one player to play 100 percent of the offensive snaps with 1,057 snaps for the team.Williams was tabbed the number one center on the depth chart coming into the 2023 NFL season; the season had officially opened on August 8. On August 29 Dan Feeney was traded to the Chicago Bears and Alama Uluave was assigned to the practice squad, so Williams came into the season as the Dolphins' first-string center. In the Week 14 game against the Titans, he tore his ACL and was placed on injured reserve on December 13, 2023.Also Read: NFL commissioner Roger Goodell aims to expand the NFL season to 18 games within five years Head coach Pete McDonald said Olu Oluwatimi will take over starting center responsibilities.

NEW DELHI: November 15 holds a special place in Indian cricket, celebrating milestones from two of the country’s greatest batters: Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli . This date marks not only the beginning of Tendulkar’s legendary career but also a record-breaking achievement by Kohli, symbolizing the generational shift in Indian cricket excellence.On November 15, 1989, a 16-year-old Sachin Tendulkar debuted for India in a Test match against Pakistan in Karachi.Facing a formidable bowling attack that included another debutant Waqar Younis, Tendulkar displayed remarkable resilience under pressure. Despite being hit on the nose by a bouncer, he showed grit and determination, scoring 15 runs off 24 balls, including two boundaries.This was the beginning of an iconic 24-year career in which Tendulkar would redefine cricketing records, amassing 15,921 Test runs and achieving a historic 100 international centuries — a feat unparalleled in the sport.Exactly 34 years later, on November 15, 2023, Kohli surpassed Tendulkar’s record for most ODI centuries by scoring his 50th ton during the World Cup semi-final against New Zealand in Mumbai.Playing in the World Cup semi-final against New Zealand at the iconic Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, Kohli scored his 50th ODI century, cementing his status as one of the modern era’s greatest players.His century came with a two off Lockie Ferguson, as he reached the mark in 106 balls, striking eight fours and a six.This achievement not only showcased Kohli's skill and determination but also honored the legacy of his idol, Tendulkar, setting a new benchmark in ODI cricket.Together, these milestones on November 15 underscore the impact of Tendulkar and Kohli on Indian cricket, celebrating a shared legacy of excellence across generations.","Virat Kohli scored his 50th ODI century on November 15, 2023.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli will be in the spotlight as India prepare to face Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , starting on November 22 in Perth. All eyes will be on the star batter as he aims to overcome recent struggles and make history on Australian soil.Despite a recent dip in form, Kohli has a strong track record in Australia, making it an ideal setting for him to rediscover his peak performance and leave a lasting legacy.Kohli is on the verge of achieving several significant milestones during this series.* One of the most notable milestones within Kohli's reach is surpassing Sachin Tendulkar 's record of 1,809 Test runs in Australia. Kohli currently sits at 1,352 runs in 13 Tests at an average of 54.08, needing 458 more runs to claim the top spot for an Indian batter.* Kohli is also closing in on the record for most Test centuries by a visiting player in Australia. He currently holds six centuries, putting him within striking distance of surpassing English legends Jack Hobbs (nine centuries) and Wally Hammond (seven centuries).* The Adelaide Oval holds a special place in Kohli's heart, as it's his most successful Australian venue. He has amassed 509 runs in four Tests there, averaging an impressive 63.62. With 102 more runs, he can surpass Brian Lara 's tally of 610 runs and become the highest-scoring visiting batter at this iconic ground.* Beyond Test cricket, Kohli is also in contention to top the list for most fifty-plus scores in international cricket by a visiting batter in Australia. He currently boasts an impressive 30 fifty-plus scores across all formats (11 centuries, 19 fifties), putting him in the running alongside legends Viv Richards (42) and Desmond Haynes (34).* Kohli's consistent performance in Australia extends to overall international runs. He has accumulated 3,426 runs across all formats, putting him 126 runs ahead of Sachin Tendulkar's record of 3,300 runs. He's also aiming to become the first Indian to reach 4,000 international runs on Australian soil, requiring 574 more runs to achieve this milestone.* The Adelaide Oval has been particularly kind to Kohli, as he's already notched five centuries at the venue. Scoring another century there wouldn't just make him the first visiting player to reach 1,000 runs at the venue, but also surpass Jack Hobbs' record of five centuries at the MCG.* This series will mark Kohli's 100th international match against Australia, likely during the third Test at The Gabba. This achievement would make him the second Indian to reach this milestone, joining the ranks of Sachin Tendulkar who has played 110 matches against the Aussies.* Kohli's current tally of 16 centuries against Australia puts him in a strong position to chase down Sachin Tendulkar's record of 20 international centuries against the Aussies.Having faced a challenging year with the bat, scoring just 488 runs in 19 matches across formats at an average of 20.33, Kohli will be eager to use this series as a platform for redemption. Australia has historically been a happy hunting ground for him, and his performance in this series holds the potential to shape not only the outcome of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy but also cement his legacy in Test cricket.The series begins on November 22 in Perth, followed by matches in Adelaide, The Gabba, and the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

PANAJI: At lunch break, when Goa's Snehal Kauthankar and Kashyap Bakle trooped into the dressing room after putting on 577 runs for the third wicket against Arunachal, the two were told they were just 18 runs short of the highest-ever partnership in Ranji Trophy history.Kauthankar had struck a triple century, while Kashyap, playing only his second Ranji game, was unbeaten on 280.On resumption, the duo went past Maharashtra's Swapnil Gugale and Ankit Bawne's record 594. The Academy ground in Porvorim erupted in joy. The two had stitched a 606-run partnership, with Kashyap too reaching a triple ton, when Goa captain Darshan Misal declared. Only later did Misal realise that the duo was just 19 runs short of a first class world record.""We came to know about the world record after declaring our innings,"" Kauthankar told TOI. ""Nobody was aware, else we would have surely gone for that record (as well).""The highest partnership in first-class cricket is the 624 runs scored by Sri Lankan pair of Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene during a Test match against South Africa at home in 2006.""We don't have any regrets of not getting the world record. We are extremely proud of our performance. More importantly, we are now going to the Elite group,"" said the experienced Goa batter, who scored 250 in the previous game against Mizoram.Goa are playing in the Plate group, comprising six of the lowest-ranked teams. Until last season, Goa were in the Elite category but were relegated after finishing at the bottom of the pool. This season, they topped the group and qualified, winning all their five matches. In contrast, Arunachal Pradesh lost all five games, the one in Goa in less than two days.After bowling out Arunachal for 84 in their first innings, Goa declared their innings at 727-2, with Kauthankar (314* off 215 balls) and Bakle (300* off 269 balls) putting on a record partnership for the third wicket. Arunachal's second innings ended at 92 in 22.3 overs, giving Goa a win by an innings and 551 runs, a Ranji record.Goa's 727-2 was their highest score in the premier domestic cricket tournament, but it was well short of the record in Ranji Trophy. That belongs to Tamil Nadu who declared their innings at a massive 912-6, incidentally against Goa in Panaji in 1989.In that game, Tamil Nadu's WV Raman and Arjun Kripal Singh had scored 313 and 302 runs, the first instance of two batters getting triple centuries.Arunachal 84 (Nabam Tagan Abo 25, Neelam Obi 22; Arjun Tendulkar 5-25, Mohit Redkar 3-15) & 92 (Nabam 31) Lakshay Garg 4-43, Deepraj Gaonkar 2-15, Keith 2-25) lost to Goa 727-2 (Snehal Kauthankar 314*, Kashyap Bakle 300*, Suyash Prabhudessai 73).",Goa's Snehal Kauthankar and Kashyap Bakhale put on the highest-ever partnership in Ranji Trophy history.

NEW DELHI: India batter Tilak Varma scripted history on Friday during the fourth and final T20I against South Africa in Johannesburg, where the Men in Blue secured a commanding 135-run victory. The 22-year-old became only the second Indian to score centuries in consecutive T20I innings, joining an elite list that includes Sanju Samson Tilak had already made headlines with an unbeaten 107 in the third T20I of the series.Building on that momentum, he delivered a scintillating 120 off just 47 balls in the fourth match, achieving a phenomenal strike rate of 255.32. His explosive knock featured nine fours and ten sixes, showcasing his dominance at the crease.Reflecting on his performance, Tilak shared a lighthearted moment: ""Actually, I wanted to tell one funny thing—last year when I played here, I got out on the first ball. This innings was very crucial for the team and the series.""Speaking about his approach, he added: ""I just focused on holding my shape and sticking to the basics from the last game. I stayed calm. It's an unbelievable feeling—I can't express it right now. I never imagined scoring two centuries in South Africa under challenging conditions. Thanks to our captain Surya for his support. As I mentioned after the last game, I was injured in recent matches, but I trust in God and my processes. That’s why I celebrated this way, dedicating it to God.""Tilak’s exceptional innings earned him the Player of the Match award.","Tilak Varma becomes only the second Indian to score centuries in consecutive T20I innings.

NEW DELHI: India dished out an all-round performance to inflict a massive 135-run defeat on South Africa in the fourth and final T20I in Johannesburg on Friday. With this victory, India clinched the four-match series 3-1.Chasing a mammoth 284-run target, South Africa were rattled by pacer Arshdeep Singh 's brilliance as he swung the ball both ways. He dismissed Reeza Hendricks in the first over and then quickly followed up with the wickets of Aiden Markram and Heinrich Klaasen His astonishing effort helped India reduce the hosts to a disastrous 10/4 within just 3 overs, effectively ending the contest early.South Africa's only focus now was to save face, with David Miller and Tristan Stubbs leading the fightback. The pair put on 86 runs before Varun Chakravarthy struck, dismissing Miller.Stubbs fell off the very next ball to Ravi Bishnoi, and India wrapped up the innings, bowling South Africa out in the 19th over. Marco Jansen showed his all-round abilities with a few big hits, but it was too little, too late.Earlier, Sanju Samson 's precision andTilak Varma 's muscular elegance combined as India effortlessly dismantled the South African bowling attack to post a commanding 283/1.This total not only marked India's highest-ever T20I score overseas but also became the highest by any team on South African soil.Among the numerous records shattered, the standout achievement was the rare feat of two Indian batters scoring centuries in the same T20I innings. Samson and Varma also set the record for India’s highest-ever partnership in T20Is—210 runs off just 93 balls for the second wicket.Samson (109* off 56 balls), who had already struck a brilliant century in the first game, once again put the Proteas to the sword alongside Varma (120* off 47 balls), who has been in sensational form at number three, brimming with confidence and vigour.Samson now has three T20I centuries in his last five innings, including two ducks, while Varma has scored back-to-back centuries.Samson reached his century in 51 balls, while Varma took just 41 balls to bring up his ton—10 balls fewer than his partner.Abhishek Sharma (36 off 18 balls) also deserves credit for setting the tone in the Powerplay with four huge sixes.On a flat track offering true bounce, the Indian batsmen were in full flow, hammering a record 23 sixes. Samson’s nine maximums were just one shy of Varma’s 10.","India inflict 135-run defeat on South Africa in fourth and final T20I in Johannesburg.

Problems galore as Tamil Nadu launch Santosh Trophy bid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/problems-galore-as-tamil-nadu-launch-santosh-trophy-bid/articleshow/115322177.cms,"Tamil Nadu players and staff

Choosing 22 players from 580 in a space of a few days was the biggest challenge, says coach Nallappan Mohanraj

CHENNAI: The men’s football scene in Tamil Nadu has been far from ideal in the last six years. With the non-conduct of the CFA leagues since 2018 due to the long-standing dispute between the Tamil Nadu Football Association (TFA) and Chennai Football Association (CFA) – they were hosted without recognition in 2022 – the local players have been struggling for game time.In a bid to sustain their careers and make a living out of the sport, many TN footballers have been forced to ply their trade in other state leagues. The grim situation has severely impacted TN’s performances in the Santosh Trophy (National Championship), where the state team has been a mere participant in the last few years.Not much has changed in TN football in recent times, but newly-appointed head coach Nallappan Mohanraj is optimistic about restoring pride in the upcoming Santosh Trophy. TN have been pitted alongside Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Andhra Pradesh and 2022-23 champs Karnataka in Group G and will play their pool matches in Anantapur from Friday to Tuesday. As only one team will qualify from the group for the final round, the competition is going to be tough.""I played in the Santosh Trophy as a youngster and captained the team as well. Being with TN in my first assignment as a head coach is something memorable. I love being put in tough situations; staying comfortable makes me uncomfortable. I have always wanted to do something good while being put in a tough situation,"" Mohanraj, a former India defender, told TOI.""I had to assess about 580 players in just three days of the trials, so I do not know if they were able to show their full potential in the little time they got. I might have missed out on picking a promising player. I do not know when these players (22 members in the final squad) last played 90 minutes in a match, so I had to decide which aspect I needed to give more importance to – fitness or tactics. It has been a huge challenge, but I have been trying to find solutions,"" said Mohanraj, who had worked with the India U-23 and U-20 teams.Mohanraj can rely on the experience of Ajith Kumar, Lijo Francis, B Sriram, Sinivasan Pandiyan and Alexander Romario Jesuraj, players who have competed in the top-two tiers of Indian football . ""I hardly had 10 days to work with the group. Adding experience while building a team is important; that is why I have opted to have at least one senior player in every area of the pitch. There has to be a good balance between youth and experience,"" added Mohanraj.Despite not having the best of build-ups, the chief coach is focused on the target. ""Our goal is to take TN to the final round. We did not have time to implement my philosophy, so I did not want to complicate our tactics. The boys know what I expect from them. I want them to do the basics right.""","Choosing 22 players from 580 in a space of a few days was the biggest challenge, says coach Nallappan Mohanraj.

KOLKATA: On Oct. 13, when Bengal was preparing to bid farewell to Maa Durga, Sanjoy Sen began his new journey.A total of 78 players assembled at the Salt Lake Stadium. And so commenced the selection trial for Bengal’s Santosh Trophy squad under the watchful eyes of coach Sen. Over the past few days, they were made to go through the grind and play four practice matches, including the one against I-League team Inter Kashi, before Sen picked his final 22 for the tournament.""When I watch a game — be it a match from ISL or I-League or any other tournament — I have this habit of taking note of the performance of any good player and keeping their names in my notebook. This has been my longtime practice. And this has helped me settle down on my final squad for Santosh Trophy also,"" Sen told TOI on Thursday.""Besides, I've collected data of some players from people and coaches who have been directly involved in teams playing in the CFL. They have also helped me pick my players. Robi Hansda, Israfil Dewan, Ayon Mondal and Aritra Ghosh — they all have proved their worth in the CFL. Overall, in my opinion they are the best of the lot. Let's see what the future holds for me and my team,"" he added.Seated comfortably in his shorts and tee, he looked relaxed at the Bengal team hotel adjacent to the Kalyani stadium where he would be busy with a mission to fulfil in the next few days.Bengal begin their group-stage campaign with a game against Jharkhand on Saturday. The two other teams of the group — Bihar and Uttar Pradesh — will also square off on the same day.The most successful team in the Santosh Trophy history with 32 titles, Bengal have not won it since the 2016-17 season. It was the time when Sen had been scaling new heights in Indian club football, having guided Mohun Bagan to their maiden I-League title and a Federation Cup to boot.""I'm not an expert in assessing why we have fallen behind in Indian football. I'm not a person who wants to live in the past. Maybe, at that time players from Mohun Bagan, East Bengal and Mohammedan SC used to play for Bengal. From Latifuddin to Md Akbar and Xavier Pias they all played for Bengal in the Santosh Trophy and helped Bengali players grow as a whole. Now these three teams no longer allow their players to take part in the tournament. So, the present can't be judged in the light of what has happened in the past,"" said Sen, who has also managed Mohammedan Sporting and United SC in the I-League and served now defunct ATK as its head of youth development.""Moreover, when we used to rule Indian football, the game was limited to Bengal, Kerala, Goa, Punjab and Services. Now, 38 teams are playing in the Santosh Trophy this year. The game has expanded and it offers a more level-playing field,"" he remarked.A daily routine chart for the players hangs up on the wall of the dining room. Each morning it is shared with them on the specially-opened WhatsApp group. ""They must know what I want from them. Following everything in a disciplined way is a must in my scheme of things,"" he put it.Sen would also often sit with them, dissecting their performances in the practice match against Inter Kashi. Mohun Bagan SG's ISL Shield-winning coach Antonio Lopez Habas, now serving the Varanasi-based team as a technical director, spoke highly of Sen's brigade after the match which Kashi won 2-0.Working a little away from the media glare and with the challenge of helping Bengal return to their days lost glory in Santosh Trophy for the first time in his 27-year-old coaching career, does he have a point to prove? Is there any self-motivating factor?""In our time, representing Bengal was itself an honour. But the players now know that unless they become champions or runners-up, they will not be noticed. This is their motivation and they are hungry to reach that stage. It's a collective mission. I'm here as a catalyst, helping my players fuel that dream,"" Sen pointed out, his stiff jaw betraying a sense of determination.And any personal objective?""My dream? I've not thought about this, honestly speaking. I've trained the Indian junior team. And just like Manolo Marquez, I too applied for the Indian senior coach's job. If there's any dream, maybe it's there... If it doesn't happen, well, it will leave me with no regrets.""Sen signed off, got up and with a whistle in his mouth, began his training session with the players at the Kalyani stadium.","Bengal begin their group-stage campaign with a game against Jharkhand on Saturday.
