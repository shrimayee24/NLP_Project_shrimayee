This is a feat that some teams can only dream of, while six teams have not made the playoffs in the last four years.

""They're usually saying things grounded in some level of reality. There might be a degree which you disagree with them, and that certainly happens a lot with Jalen and Nick Sirianni. I think higher of them on a baseline principle. Because I'm more connected to them, I tend to magnify their strengths and the things that I know they do really well.‚ÄùKelce emphasized that Hurts' contributions to the Eagles' offense are often undervalued, with praise often being given to Saquon Barkley, the offensive line, and the talented receiving duo of A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith. ‚ÄúI think Jalen never gets enough credit for a lot of things he does for this offense,"" Kelce said.He further added, ""Saquon Barkley would not have the season he had without having Jalen Hurts as the QB and that's the reality of it and he never gets credit for that. All of that goes to the offensive line and Saquon. The reality is, his threat as a runner, his threat as an RPO person, all of that stuff opens up so many other things. ... To me he has cemented himself as a competitor and as a leader. He's just done so well this postseason, so I'm really happy for Jalen.‚ÄùAlso Read: Can the Chiefs can afford to retain Trey Smith and Nick Bolton?

remains a key name to monitor before Thursday night‚Äôs clash against the Atlanta Hawks at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse. With the Cavs rolling at 38-9 and looking to avenge two earlier losses to Atlanta, Garland‚Äôs availability could significantly impact their game plan.As of now, the Cleveland Cavaliers have not officially submitted their injury report to the NBA, leaving Darius Garland‚Äôs status unclear. The 24-year-old guard has battled injuries at various points this season, making his potential absence a crucial factor in Cleveland‚Äôs rotation.If Garland is sidelined or limited, the scoring burden will fall heavier on Donovan Mitchell, who will likely have to take on more ball-handling responsibilities against an Atlanta team missing several key players. Max Strus could also see an expanded role in initiating the offense, while Caris LeVert would be expected to provide an offensive spark off the bench.Even if Darius Garland suits up, the Cleveland Cavaliers will need to execute at a high level, particularly against Hawks guard Trae Young. Young, the NBA‚Äôs assist leader, is officially listed as probable with a right hamstring issue but remains a constant threat. If Garland plays, he‚Äôll likely split time with Strus on defending Young, a matchup that could determine the flow of the game.With Atlanta missing Jalen Johnson, Clint Capela, and Bogdan Bogdanoviƒá, the Hawks are short-handed but still dangerous. Cleveland‚Äôs defensive intensity and ability to control the paint‚Äîespecially with Evan Mobley regaining form‚Äîwill be critical in neutralizing Young‚Äôs impact.Beyond the team‚Äôs desire for redemption, individual aspirations will also be on the line. The NBA will announce All-Star reserves just before tipoff, and with Garland, Jarrett Allen, and Mobley in the mix, emotions could run high depending on the selections.Also read:The Cleveland Cavaliers enter the matchup as 10.5-point favorites, according to sportsbooks, but Darius Garland‚Äôs availability could influence both the betting lines and the outcome.

Bills Mafia stands behind Griffin



Sports stir up passion, and when a team falls short, emotions can run high. That was certainly the case after the Bills‚Äô gut-wrenching loss to the Chiefs in the AFC Championship. Veteran QB Robert Griffin III added fuel to the fire with his controversial analysis of Josh Allen 's performance, igniting a fierce backlash from Buffalo fans who weren‚Äôt pleased with his critique of their star quarterback.Sports can stir up intense emotions, especially when your team falls short. And that's exactly what happened after the Bills' heartbreaking loss to the Chiefs in the AFC Championship. The aftermath? A fiery reaction from fans, particularly after veteran QB Robert Griffin III pointed fingers at Josh Allen, a move that did not sit well with the Buffalo faithful.Appearing on Kay Adams' ""Up and Adams"" show, Griffin shared his controversial take, stating, ‚ÄúNo one has pointed this out‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve watched the tape back multiple times, Josh Allen could have actually adjusted the protection and picked up that blitz. But no one is talking about that because I think there‚Äôs a fear right now amongst the media to criticize Josh Allen because he‚Äôs been so great. And I do think Josh Allen is a great quarterback.‚ÄùThe Bills were trailing the Chiefs 29-32 with just two minutes left on the clock. In a critical moment, Allen threw a pass to Kincaid, who had gotten behind the defense but couldn't make the catch. That mistake allowed the Chiefs to run down the clock and secure the victory. But Griffin believes the blame lies not with Kincaid, but with Josh Allen himself.Despite a solid performance completing 24 of 34 passes for 237 yards, two touchdowns, and a passer rating of 104.7, Allen‚Äôs mistake was enough to spark outrage. Bills fans, fiercely loyal to their star QB, were outraged by Griffin's comments. The backlash was so severe that some fans went as far as sending death threats to the former Ravens QB.Also Read: Andy Reid's key weapon at Chiefs: 6-time Super Bowl champion who coached both Mahomes and Brady Griffin recently took to X to address the backlash he received after analyzing the Bills‚Äô loss to the Chiefs.

Justin Tucker: Ravens Kicker Justin Tucker Accused of Sexual Misconduct by Allegedly Brushing Women with Exposed Genitals from Six Massage Therapists,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/ravens-kicker-justin-tucker-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-by-allegedly-brushing-women-with-exposed-genitals-from-five-massage-therapists/articleshow/117754244.cms,"NFL.com

Justin Tucker Accused of Sexual Misconduct: Breaking Down the Allegations



How This Affects Tucker's NFL Career



Could the NFL Take Action?



Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker is at the center of a major controversy as six massage therapists have accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior. The reported incidents took place between 2012 to 2016, and supposedly occurred during several massage sessions done at high-class spas in Baltimore. With how serious the offenses are, talk in the world of the National Football League remains rife and full of wonder about his career.Several massage therapists have come forward and described encounters where Tucker allegedly made them uncomfortable with unprofessional and inappropriate conduct. The accusations are similar to those in past cases involving NFL players, particularly Deshaun Watson, who faced a high-profile legal battle over similar claims.Tucker's attorneys have denied the allegations, declaring that their client is innocent and will fight for his name. So far, neither the NFL nor the Ravens have made public statements on whether an internal investigation will take place.A resurfaced 2021 tweet from a user named Young MC, who had previously hinted at troubling behavior by Tucker without specifying details, is now gaining attention amid the recent allegations. Many are revisiting the tweet, speculating whether it was an early warning about the accusations that have now come to light.Beyond the controversy off the field, Tucker did have a struggling 2024 season that's already been batted around. He made only 73.3% of his field goal attempts, and he missed eight field goals and two extra points, which are far from where he's ever been. Tucker did rebound, though, as he was successful on all of his kicks during the playoffs when it counted.Despite his struggles, Ravens GM Eric DeCosta has publicly backed Tucker, expressing confidence in his ability to return to top form in the 2025 season. But now, with these allegations surfacing, Tucker‚Äôs future with the team‚Äîand in the NFL‚Äîlooks uncertain.The NFL has yet to decide whether it will officially investigate the case, but given the league's recent approach to off-field misconduct cases, it is likely that they will step in. If the accusations lead to a formal investigation, Tucker could face disciplinary action, including suspension.For now, the Ravens' kicker is active, but this situation has the potential to get out of hand quite rapidly based on new developments. The NFL is keeping a close eye on the case, and fans and analysts alike are eager to see how this unfolds.Also read - Patrick Mahomes‚Äô wife Brittany Mahomes vs. Jalen Hurts‚Äô girlfriend Bry Burrows: Who has the most expensive fashion style?","Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker is at the center of a major controversy as six massage therapists have accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior.

Adam Silver wants 10-minute quarters in the NBA to align it with the rest of the world

Commissioner of the NBA, Adam Silver has sparked discussion following his controversial proposal which garnered wide attention from fans and analysts alike. Silver wants to shorten NBA quarters from 12 to 10 minutes to match the standard used worldwide. Following his bold proposal, coaches of the league have started giving their thoughts on the matter and their impression of the potential big change does not align with Silver‚Äôs vision. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about the proposal that sparked huge reactions in the NBA community.NBA has one thing that does not align with the rest of the world and that is the 12-minute quarter format but it appears that the format which has been in practice for over seven decades, will change soon as Adam Silver shared his idea of reducing the 12-minute format to 10.Some of the NBA coaches have shared their thoughts on the potential change coming to the league. Boston Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla revealed that he does not have any concerning issues with the change. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care. Whatever you got to do. Just play the game,‚Äù the 36-year-old said after the Boston Celtics‚Äô 122-100 win against the Chicago Bulls.New York Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau was leaning towards the traditional approach of the game. ‚ÄúI think we have a great game. I think what people really want to see is competition. When you study which transpired over time, there has always been different styles of play. So, the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, what goes into winning is the same. And, I think what fans really enjoy is great competition. I think if we focus on the competition aspect of it, everything else will fall into place,‚Äù Thibodeau told the press.Further, Denver Nuggets head coach Michael Malone responded, ‚ÄúI give the league credit, because they‚Äôre always trying to find ways to keep the fans engaged. But I hope we don‚Äôt go to 10-minute quarters.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúI hope we don‚Äôt put in a 4-point line. I hope we don‚Äôt become Barnum & Bailey, or do whatever we have to do to keep viewership. Because there is a history and greatness to this game. And a purity to this game and I hope we can find a way to stay true to that.‚ÄùOf course, the NBA viewership decline this season has been concerning, and the league has been looking at more potential options to claim more viewership in the long run.Silver recently appeared on The Dan LeBatard Show, where he addressed a major difference between the NBA and other leagues worldwide. He pointed out that the NBA is the only league still using 12-minute quarters, while international competitions stick to 10-minute periods.Certainly, Silver‚Äôs intention of expanding the NBA for global reach has been clear. Now, with his recent proposal to align with the global game and make broadcasts more viewer-friendly, Silver is considering shortening quarters to 10 minutes.""I'm probably in the minority, but as we get more involved in global basketball, the NBA is the only league that plays 48 minutes. I am a fan of four, 10-minute quarters. I'm not sure that many others are. Putting aside what it means for records and things like that, I think a two-hour format for the game is more consistent for the modern, television audience,"" Silver said.He added, ""People in the arenas aren't asking us to shorten the games. But as a television program, being two hours... Olympic basketball is two hours, college basketball is two hours... It's such a dramatic change to the game. I think something like that would have to be talked about more.""Also Read: YouTube mogul MrBeast says Kobe Bryant is the sports version of him: ‚ÄúI relate very well to him‚Äù Silver‚Äôs point of view on the league is understandable as the Commissioner is presumably on a mission to make the NBA accessible to the globe. However, the traditional approach that differentiated the league from the other basketball games, would not be there.","Commissioner of the NBA, Adam Silver has sparked discussion following his controversial proposal.

Virat Kohli's Ranji Trophy return creates frenzy in Delhi

NEW DELHI: It‚Äôs 5 AM. Wrapped in thick jackets, mufflers, and woolen caps, hands tucked into pockets, Delhiites braved the biting cold for a chance to enter the Arun Jaitley Stadium . This wasn‚Äôt an international match. It wasn‚Äôt a World Cup clash. It wasn‚Äôt even the IPL. It was all about one man ‚Äî Virat Kohli . After a decade, their local hero was set to play a Ranji Trophy match. His last appearance for Delhi came in 2012 against Uttar Pradesh. For Kohli, this wasn‚Äôt just a return‚Äîit was a homecoming.Never in Ranji Trophy history had a domestic match witnessed a crowd of nearly 15,000. But this was Virat Kohli-mania, rewriting the script.Security was tight. Delhi Police and ITBP commandos were stationed outside the stadium to control the crowd. But in India, cricket is more than just a sport ‚Äî it‚Äôs a religion. Fans, desperate for a glimpse of their icon, dashed from one gate to another, searching for any possible way in. Amid the pushing and heated exchanges, the moment of relief arrived ‚Äî the gates finally opened, and the sea of supporters poured in.The long wait was over.""We've been standing here since 4:30 AM. We didn‚Äôt want to miss our chance to get in and secure a good seat with a clear view of Virat Kohli. This is a huge moment for all of us, and we couldn‚Äôt afford to miss it. He‚Äôs playing after so long, and I feel grateful for this opportunity to watch a legend live on the field,"" an excited fan said.Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy A fan with a fractured leg, his plaster cast visible, stood at the stadium gate, leaning on a walker as he waited for entry.

But that doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äîmy love for the game is far greater. I want to meet Saif, and if I‚Äôm lucky, Virat as well. I'm here to enjoy this special match because of him. Wishing him all the best!,"" he said.Apart from the frenzy, it was a herculean task for the security officials as well.""Cricket fans are truly mad. This is my first time being deployed outside a cricket stadium, and I‚Äôve never seen such a craze. I had to push some fans to keep them in line and follow the rules. I had heard about the madness surrounding Virat Kohli, but today, I witnessed it firsthand,"" a commando said.As soon as the gates opened and fans flooded inside, the streets outside fell silent. The madness had shifted into the stadium. Banners of Kohli were raised, pamphlets waved, and the chants of ""Kohli! Kohli!"" echoed through the stands.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 Schedule The noise levels skyrocketed when Kohli stepped onto the field, taking his position at second slip after Delhi opted to field against Railways.

NEW DELHI: Thursday was all about Virat Kohli marking his return to the Ranji Trophy after a gap of 12 years, but with Delhi opting to field first, the day belonged to Railways wicketkeeper Upendra Yadav , who served a timely reminder to selectors about his capabilities with a beautifully crafted 95 off 177.The knock came in difficult circumstances, with the team tottering at 66/5 as the batters were rocked by some early morning seam movement on a greenish pitch.Upendra's knock ensured Railways ended the day still very much in the hunt for a quarterfinal berth. Upendra has been a consistent performer and was seen as a potential backup to Rishabh Pant in red-ball cricket. He even made the India 'A' team a few years ago. However, he fell off the radar with the emergence of Dhruv Jurel , Abhishek Porel and Kumar Kushagra. With the help of Karn Sharma , Upendra dragged Railways to a respectable 241.Upendra and Sharma put on 104 for the sixth wicket after Delhi's seam attack of Navdeep Saini , Siddhant Sharma and Money Grewal troubled the top order. Just when the pitch looked to have flattened out, Sharma fell to some short-pitched stuff from Saini.Railways 241 in 67.4 overs (Upendra 95, Karn Sharma 50; Navdeep Sain 3/62, Sumit Mathur 3/20) vs Delhi 41/1 in 10 overs",Wicketkeeper Upendra Yadav scores 95 off 177 balls.

NEW DELHI: Former India wicketkeeper-batter Wriddhiman Saha has opened up about his departure from the national team in 2022, stating that it was not an injustice but a decision based on team needs. The 40-year-old played his final match at Eden Gardens in Bengal's Ranji Trophy game against Punjab on Thursday, marking the end of an illustrious career.Saha's international journey effectively concluded in 2021 when the Indian team management, led by head coach Rahul Dravid and captain Rohit Sharma , opted for KS Bharat as Rishabh Pant 's backup. While the decision was a turning point in his career, Saha harbors no bitterness about it.""I wouldn't call it injustice. That would be selfish. Maybe it wasn't just one person's decision. Maybe I wasn't capable enough or didn't deliver as expected, so they made their choice,"" Saha told reporters. ""If I had performed better, this wouldn't have happened. I don't dwell on it ‚Äî I just take the positives from whatever comes my way.""Despite stepping away from the international arena, Saha remains confident in his abilities and believes he could still contribute to the Indian team.""If I was in the team, I would have contributed with good catches or good innings. I've tried my best for Bengal. In slip fielding, I haven't missed a single catch. I've enjoyed every bit of it,"" said Saha, who represented India in 40 Tests and nine ODIs.While Saha officially announced his retirement in November last year, he had contemplated stepping away from the game earlier. However, he was encouraged by former BCCI president Sourav Ganguly and his wife, Romi, to continue for another season.""I had planned to retire last season itself. But only because of Dadi (Sourav Ganguly) and my wife Romi, I pushed it to this season. Otherwise, I would have retired by now,"" he revealed.Known for his calm demeanor, Saha has always avoided the limelight and maintained a grounded approach to his career.""I've always been like this. It's my choice to be carefree. I don't seek attention. I just want to remain the same humble player on the field. I've always been comfortable with that.""Even on the occasion of his farewell match, Saha remained emotionally composed.""I've never been an emotional person, even as a child. There's no special sentiment about playing my last match. I'll go out with my friends like always.""As he steps into retirement, Saha is looking forward to spending more time with his family, something he has missed over nearly two decades of professional cricket.""Finally, after 18 years, I don't need a warm-up anymore after this match. Now, I can spend more time with my family.""Reflecting on his career, Saha acknowledged that while not all his dreams had been realised, he had no regrets.""Some have been fulfilled, some haven't. You can't force every dream to come true. Many people already know about my retirement unofficially.""Above all, Saha expressed gratitude for the opportunities cricket has given him.""I am here today because of cricket, which I've played my whole life. I have spent so much time with the team, 17 years in the IPL, so why should I regret anything? I'm grateful to everyone. It's difficult to name each and every person.""",Former India wicketkeeper-batter Wriddhiman Saha has announced his retirement.

Taylor Swift‚Äôs Friends Reveal Super Bowl Plan: A Star-Studded Affair Awaits

Taylor Swift pulled into legal drama involving her close friend Blake Lively



As Taylor Swift gears up to support her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, at the upcoming Super Bowl , reports suggest she will be joined by her close friends, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds. The Hollywood power couple has been invited to Swift‚Äôs VIP box as the Kansas City Chiefs face off against the Philadelphia Eagles. However, their anticipated appearance comes amid a legal controversy, as Lively and Reynolds remain entangled in a sexual harassment lawsuit involving filmmaker Justin Baldoni.The Kansas City Chiefs, led by superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes, have battled their way into Super Bowl 59, aiming for an unprecedented three-peat. As the team gears up for the historic showdown in New Orleans on February 9, Taylor Swift‚Äîperhaps their most high-profile supporter‚Äîhas her own plans set for the big game.Despite her packed schedule, the global pop icon and girlfriend of Chiefs' tight end Travis Kelce has attended nearly every home game this season. With Kansas City now on the verge of making NFL history, Swift‚Äôs presence at the Superdome is all but confirmed. After all, would she really miss witnessing Kelce and the Chiefs chase a record-breaking championship?According to reports from The U.S. Sun, Taylor Swift won‚Äôt be watching the game alone. The suite she‚Äôs reserving for the event will be filled with A-list friends and family. The exclusive guest list reportedly includes Hollywood elites like Selena Gomez, Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, Benny Blanco, Sabrina Carpenter, and Ice Spice.Lively and Reynolds, a power couple in their own right, were recently spotted on a double date with Swift and Kelce. Their bond is strong, and their plans for the Super Bowl have been in the works for months.‚ÄúBlake and Ryan have been talking with Taylor and Travis about it when they spent days together a couple of months ago,‚Äù a source revealed to The Sun. ‚ÄúAnd they told them not to book anything for that time of the year and to get ready to go to New Orleans at the beginning of the year.‚ÄùThis isn‚Äôt just a last-minute decision‚Äîit‚Äôs been a conversation since the season began. Now, with the Chiefs officially in the big game, the final preparations for the ultimate Super Bowl watch party are underway.Lively and Reynolds were also spotted alongside Swift at last year‚Äôs Super Bowl, where the Chiefs secured a dramatic 26-22 overtime victory over the San Francisco 49ers. If history repeats itself, their presence might just bring Kansas City another championship.While Swift is focused on celebrating Kelce‚Äôs Super Bowl moment, she has also found herself unintentionally dragged into a legal dispute involving her close friend Blake Lively.According to The Daily Mail, Swift was reportedly ""confused"" after being linked to director Justin Baldoni‚Äôs ongoing legal battle with Lively. A source clarified the situation, stating, ""Taylor is proud of the film because her music was featured in it, which gave her a sense of involvement, though she wasn't fully aware of the extent of the project's developments.""It was further emphasized that Swift‚Äôs connection to Lively remains strictly personal, not professional. ""Taylor's relationship with Blake is purely a friendship, with no interest in influencing or controlling Blake's projects,"" the insider added.The situation escalated when Baldoni‚Äôs legal team reportedly tried to paint Swift‚Äôs brief visit to Lively‚Äôs meeting as something more than it was. However, those close to her dismiss this as an attempt to pull her into the feud.""This was the first time that Taylor ever met Justin,"" the source explained. ""She had no idea who he was and Taylor was simply being polite. She was polite to him as she is to everyone she meets.""As the legal battle continues, a March 9, 2026, trial date has been set by U.S. District Judge Lewis J. Liman. The initial hearing, which was scheduled for mid-February, has now been moved up. The conference will address concerns regarding pretrial publicity and alleged attempts to influence potential jurors.Also Read: ""He forced us to do so many things"": Who‚Äôs the best Super Bowl opponent Tom Brady ever faced?

Travis Kelce is determined to win the Super Bowl

Kansas City Chiefs face perhaps the greatest test in their postseason history, to become the greatest team in the history of the NFL by winning three consecutive Super Bowl s - a feat never achieved by any team. Kansas City is three wins away from becoming the first team to win the Lombardi trophy in three consecutive seasons, a feat that has been achieved by several teams, including eight winning back-to-back Super Bowls. Tight end Travis Kelce expressed his thoughts on this achievement.The Kansas City Chiefs have achieved the historic milestone of winning back-to-back Lombardi Trophies and reaching the Super Bowl in year three, thereby becoming the first NFL team to win three consecutive Super Bowls, or a three-peat . This historic achievement is an important one.In the latest episode of New Heights, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce was asked about Kansas City's historic Super Bowl opportunity by his brother and co-host Jason. Kelce responded with a NSFW, blunt response. ""I don't give a f--- about a g-- d--- record,"" Kelce said. "" I want a Super Bowl this year.‚ÄùKansas City is implementing the same strategy that has been successful in recent years, according to Kelce, who jokingly mentioned the Chiefs' reference to the three-peat ""non-stop"" as they prepare for Super Bowl LIX against the Philadelphia Eagles.""It hasn't been mentioned one time outside of being asked about it in the media,"" Kelce said. ""Everybody in the building is just focused on doing their job. That's how we got here. That's how we got the first one. That's how we got the second one. It's the only way you win football games and get to the Super Bowl is if you focus on the task at hand.""Kelce is well aware that the Eagles, who were defeated by Kansas City in Super Bowl LVII, are seeking revenge this year. ""And we got a huge task coming up. Man, it's gonna be electric. It's gonna be absolutely electric. We know Philly's got the sour taste in their mouth from the last one and they're a hell of f------ football team. This will be the best team we played all year.‚ÄùAlso Read: Andy Reid reveals that Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce are not just any Chiefs, he takes a different approach with the star players and are treated differently The Chiefs hold a slight edge in Super Bowl LIX due to their elite defense and Patrick Mahomes ' ability to rise in big moments, while the Eagles' ground dominance and defensive revamp make the matchup unpredictable. The outcome will be determined on February 9.","Kansas City Chiefs are three wins away from becoming the first team to win the Lombardi trophy in three consecutive seasons.

Career and personal life

Bonnie Blue , a 25-year-old OnlyFans creator from Derbyshire , claims to have set a world record by having sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours, reports Daily Mail.The event took place in London, allegedly surpassing the previous record of 919 men in 24 hours set by adult actress Lisa Sparks in 2004, with Bonnie claiming she ""bedded 1,057 in 12 hours.""In a video shared on TikTok, Bonnie thanked those who participated, saying, ‚ÄúThank you to all the barely legal, barely breathing and the husbands.‚ÄùShe added that her skin looked better after the event and described the experience: ‚ÄúThe room was absolutely full. We did groups of five, like one after the other. It was a rotating circle.‚ÄùHer PR team confirmed the tally, stating, ‚ÄúShe slept with 1,057 people. As she hit 1,000, there were still 57 left in the queue who Bonnie wanted to pleasure before ending the 12-hour day.‚Äù Calculations suggest she averaged 41 seconds per partner.The stunt sparked outrage online, with comments such as ‚ÄúHow embarrassing‚Äù and ‚ÄúSad that men would want to do that too‚Äîall for fame and money.‚Äù Bonnie is no stranger to controversy, having previously defended her claims of sleeping with ‚Äúbarely legal‚Äù 18-year-olds and encouraging men to cheat on their wives.Bonnie's real name is Tia Billinger , who says she earns up to ¬£750,000 a month from her OnlyFans content. Despite criticism, she insists her work is educational. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt think of one situation where an 18-year-old has had sex where they‚Äôve had to bring a passport, sign consent forms, and do a breathalyser,‚Äù she said on ITV‚Äôs This Morning.She also addressed criticism for sleeping with married men, arguing, ‚ÄúIf wives aren‚Äôt going to pleasure husbands, let them go elsewhere. It‚Äôs just an act; the husbands mean nothing to me.‚ÄùBonnie transitioned to sex work after moving to Australia in 2022 with her now ex-husband, Oliver Davidson. Formerly a recruitment professional, she launched her career as a cam girl and later joined OnlyFans.She claims her family now supports her career, with her mother even assisting her business by booking appointments and handing out condoms for marketing. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs changed their life completely for the better,‚Äù she said.Bonnie defended her actions, stating, ‚ÄúThese 18-year-olds can go to the army, they can drive, they can drink‚Ä¶ If they want to use their own bodies to come and sleep with me, that is their decision.‚Äù","Bonnie Blue, 25, claims to have had sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours.

4th T20I: Time for India to change combination against England?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/england-tour-of-india-2025/4th-t20i-time-for-india-to-change-combination-against-england/articleshow/117766009.cms,"Tweaking a spin-heavy combination and being more guarded in powerplay could be the way forward for India in Pune

PUNE: Mohammed Shami's international comeback in the last match, the availability of middle-order batter Rinku Singh and conditions at Gahunje stadium will play a role as India look to play their best playing XI to seal the T20 series against England. Suryakumar Yadav 's team, leading 2-1, play Jos Buttler's men in the fourth match at Gahunje stadium on Friday night. The hosts had a chance to clinch the series in Rajkot but fumbled in a chase of 172 runs - widely viewed as a sub-par target - on Tuesday.The team had to rest left arm pacer Arshdeep Singh in that contest to make way for Shami. For, they stuck to the idea of playing four spinners - left-armer Axar Patel, offie Washington Sundar and leggies Varun Chakravarthy and Ravi Bishnoi. However, the pitch for this match is not doctored to assist spinners like it was for the October's Test against New Zealand. Hence, not resting Shami, but bringing in Arshdeep and Rinku in place of Sundar/Bishnoi and Dhruv Jurel respectively may make sense.Rinku missed the second and third games due to lower back spasms, but he was available for selection when Team India practised on Thursday evening. England chose not to train.Regardless of India's spin combination, the faceoff between tweakers from the hosts and England leggie Adil Rashid will be a nice sub-plot to the contest.Bishnoi has leaked 95 runs in 12 overs for one wicket in the series. He was taken to the cleaners in the last match with two fours and five sixes. And England batters are perfectly capable of repeating the act. Though the pitch is expected to offer some assistance to the bowlers, it is unlikely to play tricks. Still, India cannot take visiting pacers - led by Jofra Archer - lightly.England had managed to choke India and stop them from hitting boundaries for 43 balls in the middle overs in the last match. And coach Gautam Gambhir may have taken serious note of that.Hardik Pandya has enjoyed the status of being one of the most valued members of the team since he offers a rare all-round fare - aggressive batting and pace bowling. But his ability to maintain strike rate, especially if he comes into bat before the 10th over has come under the scanner.How to use your resources optimally is a bigger task for captains in T20 than in other forms of the game. Jurel, playing as a specialist batter, came in quite late in the last game. Axar was under bowled and Washington Sundar's one over (15 runs) was quite costly.England can take credit for handing the reigning T20 World Champions a rare defeat - only their third in the last 31 games. And their aggressive brand of cricket means they are perfectly capable of taking the series to the decider in Mumbai on Sunday. But since the format offers their batters a license to kill, they can also shoot themselves in the foot.The retirement of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli from T20Is, has opened the big door for Sanju Samson, Abhishek Sharma and Tilak Varma to establish themselves at the top of the order. And if they survive the initial spell and boundary-hitting temptation in the powerplay, they can make a big impact.","Mohammed Shami's international comeback and availability of middle-order batter Rinku Singh will play a role as India look to play their best playing XI to seal the T20 series against England.

Joburg Super Kings ' (JSK) captain Faf du Plessis spearheaded his team's seven-wicket win over Paar Royals on Thursday with a sublime half-century, which kept them alive in the race to the playoffs.Du Plessis's 87 off 55 balls, including 7 sixes and 4 fours, never allowed the Royals a chance after they had put up a modest 150 for 9 on the board.The victory put JSK level with Sunrisers Eastern Cape (SEC) on 19 points, though they remain at the fourth spot, behind SEC on bonus-point count.JSK's opening partnership laid the foundation of the win as Du Plessis and Devon Conway (20 off 25 balls) put up a valuable 54-run stand for the first wicket, which was broken by Mujeeb Ur Rehman when he dismissed Convoy.Keith Dudgeon got the wicket of du Plessis, but by then the JSK chase had reached 130 and the writing was on the wall for the Royals.Leus du Plooy (18*) and Jonny Bairstow (8*) then took the Super Kings home in 17.5 overs.Earlier, the Royals suffered an early setback when Sam Hain (2), who replaced the rested Joe Root, was dismissed on the second delivery of their innings by Donovan Ferreira who registered figures of 3 for 23.The equally effective Lutho Sipamla (3 for 19) continued to shine, taking his tournament tally to 11 wickets.Despite Lhuan-dre Pretorius (19 of 11 balls) and Rubin Hermann (28 off 26 balls) making brief contributions, it was Dinesh Kartik who stood tall for the Royals , scoring his first SA20 fifty with 53 off 39 balls.The Royals were also without skipper David Miller, who is at home with his family following the birth of his child.Paarl Royals have already secured their spot in Qualifier 1, where they will face MI Cape Town Gqeberha on February 4.SEC, JSK, and Pretoria Capitals are competing for the remaining two playoff positions.","Joburg Super Kings (JSK) beat Paar Royals by seven wickets.

PCB to have an event in Lahore

NEW DELHI: The 2025 edition of the Champions Trophy will not have a pre-tournament captains photo-op due to different arrival schedules of participating teams. It is reliably understood that there are a lot of hurdles in getting all captains together before the tournament gets underway as even England and Australia will be reaching Pakistan late due to their ongoing international assignments.The development means there is no need for India captain Rohit Sharma to travel to Pakistan and he can stay with the Indian team in Dubai - where they play the three group matches and also the knockouts if they qualify.It is learnt that the Indian team is likely to leave for Dubai on February 15 and more clarity on the departure schedule is expected in the coming days.Rohit Sharma and Co. will be camped in Dubai and are unlikely to play a warm-up game before their opening game vs Bangladesh on February 20. Various options were explored but since most teams will be in Pakistan for their matches, it was difficult arranging a fixture.It is further understood that the Indian camp is okay with quality net sessions as they are scheduled to play three ODIs vs England before starting their Champions Trophy campaign.The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has planned an event in Lahore ahead of the Champions Trophy. There were discussions of having it in Karachi but it has now been moved to Lahore. It is learnt that opening ceremonies/events are carried out by host nations and Pakistan have decided to have it in Lahore.The venues in Pakistan are yet to be handed over to the global cricket body but PCB are confident to finish the work in the coming week. The multi-nation tournament gets underway on February 19 and the final will happen on March 9.If India qualify for semi-final, they will play that fixture in Dubai only and even the final will be moved there if India make it to the title clash.",The 2025 edition of the Champions Trophy will not have a pre-tournament captains photo-op due to different arrival schedules of participating teams.

The Sharjah Warriorz took a massive step towards the ILT20 playoffs as they jumped from sixth to third spot after their four-wicket win over Abu Dhabi Knight Riders (ADKR) in Sharjah on Thursday, championed by Adam Zampa and Adam Milne's spirited show with the ball and Johnson Charles 's half-century.In pursuit of 162, the Warriorz started brilliantly as Charles and Tom Kohler-Cadmore launched attacked from the word go, putting together a 66-run partnership that set up the stage perfectly.During the fourth over, the pair hammered Ibrar Ahmad for 24 runs. Vijayakanth Viyaskanth eventually broke through, dismissing Kohler-Cadmore who was caught in the deep, having scored 39 runs off 21 balls.Charles continued to dominate the innings, taking on all the bowlers, while Rohan Mustafa played a supporting role.Mustafa's innings was cut short by Sunil Narine after he had scord just five runs, causing a temporary dip in scoring rate, but Charles maintained his aggressive approach.A lifeline was given to Charles in the 11th over when he was dropped, allowing him to reach his fifty. The following over saw another fielding lapse when Roston Chase failed to hold onto an edge from Jason Roy's bat.Charles appeared poised for a big knock but was dismissed by Narine after a decisive innings of 65 of 35 balls. Roy's departure for 15 followed shortly when Jason Holder delivered a wicket maiden in the 16th over.The Warriorz suffered a collapse as Tim Seifert (10) and Ethan D'Souza (1) were dismissed in quick succession, losing three wickets while adding merely two runs. Despite their earlier dominance, they found themselves in a challenging position at 148 for6, requiring 14 runs from 16 deliveries.However, Ashton Agar's calculated assault (12* off 10), comprising a six and a four, effectively managed the pressure situation and steered the Warriorz home.Earlier, Milne provided the Sharjah Warriorz with an excellent beginning by striking early to leave the Knight Riders struggling at 29 for 2.Andries Gous was dismissed for a golden duck and Joe Clarke was sent back for 15 after smashing Milne for three successive boundaries.Chase navigated through some precarious moments before establishing a crucial 58-run partnership with Kyle Mayers for the third wicket. However, Zampa secured a breakthrough when Chase departed after scoring a quick 33.Mayers took control of the Knight Riders' innings, reaching his half-century in just 29 balls. Just when it appeared he would guide his team to a substantial total, Zampa struck again, claiming the crucial wicket of the West Indian for 56.When Milne (3 for 33) returned to bowl in the 15th over, he immediately dismissed Narine (2). Subsequently, Zampa (3 for 27) outwitted Andre Russell, who managed only three runs, as both Warriorz bowlers enjoyed significant success.In the closing stages, Holder (26 off 17) played an impactful innings, particularly targeting Tim Southee (0 for 39) in the 19th over where he scored 17 runs, helping the Knight Riders achieve a competitive total of 161 for 8.",Sharjah Warriorz beat Abu Dhabi Knight Riders by four wickets. Adam Zampa and Adam Milne took three wickets each for the Warriorz. Johnson Charles scored 65 of 35 balls in Sharjah's chase of 162.

NEW DELHI: Paris Olympics bronze medallist Aman Sehrawat will not be able to defend his men's 57kg category title at the forthcoming Zagreb Open ranking series tournament next week, as the Wrestling Federation of India ( WFI ) failed to secure requisite clearance for the event from the sports ministry due to its inexplicable suspension since Dec 2023.And it's not solely Sehrawat who has been denied the opportunity to compete at the season's first ranking series meet, which carries vital ranking points for seedings at the senior World wrestling championships, scheduled to be held later this year.Other Indian men and women freestyle and greco-roman wrestlers, too, have been compelled to forgo yet another prestigious championship because the ministry has declined to grant affiliation to an elected body in WFI, which has the recognition from the sport's world governing body ‚Äì UWW . Sanjay Singh was duly elected the WFI president more than a year back after decisively defeating govt-backed candidate Anita Sheoran .According to sources, the WFI waited for the ministry's authorisation for the Feb 5-9 event in Croatia's capital despite submitting entries to the organisers well in advance, as well as reminding the Sports Authority of India (SAI) about the same on multiple occasions. However, the clearance hadn't materialised as of Thursday evening.""The trip to Zagreb has been called off. There's no time remaining to process anything. You have a weekend approaching (Feb 1-2) and the Croatian embassy in Delhi will be closed. The wrestlers were scheduled to depart on Monday evening for the event commencing on Wednesday. You cannot arrange everything in just one day (Friday, Jan 31). The team's participation has been withdrawn since the federation hasn't received confirmation from the SAI.

NEW DELHI: Following one of the most highly anticipated clashes of Round 10, India‚Äôs Gukesh Dommaraju maintained his lead at the top of the Masters leaderboard at the 2025 Tata Steel Chess Tournament , defeating Dutchman Max Warmerdam on his home soil in Wijk aan Zee on Wednesday.Defending with the black pieces, Gukesh responded to the King‚Äôs Pawn Opening with an out-of-the-box Pirc Defense. Showing early aggression, the youngest-ever World Chess Champion captured Warmerdam‚Äôs first piece, the Queen‚Äôs Pawn, with Cxd4.With the Chennai-born grandmaster maintaining his aggressive stance, continued pressure from his pieces ultimately provoked a blunder from the 24-year-old Dutchman.As Gukesh captured Warmerdam‚Äôs rook with Qxc8 on move 27, Warmerdam, in a desperate attempt to attack Gukesh‚Äôs queen, played Rc1.The advantage was now entirely in Gukesh‚Äôs hands, and he capitalised immediately, playing Nxg3 on move 30. With no escape from the mounting pressure, Warmerdam resigned, sealing Gukesh‚Äôs second consecutive win in the 87th edition of the ""Wimbledon of Chess"".The game between Slovenia‚Äôs Vladimir Fedoseev and Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu was another thriller. One of the tournament‚Äôs most formidable, in-form players, Fedoseev had already defeated Arjun Erigaisi, Fabiano Caruana, Vincent Keymer, and Pentala Harikrishna, suffering only one loss ‚Äî to Alexey Sarana ‚Äî before facing Praggnanandhaa in this Round 10 matchup.An unconventional Tarrasch Defense with the Two Knights Variation saw Fedoseev, defending with black, deploy his pieces in an early offence.However, as he concentrated on stacking up his pieces on the left side of the board, Praggnanandhaa remained composed, refraining from an overzealous push and ensuring he retained the upper hand.With the queens traded off by move 36, Praggnanandhaa delivered a decisive rook check before successfully promoting his d8 pawn to a queen.With that, the game was effectively over, giving the Indian grandmaster a much-needed victory after his crushing defeat to Dutch No. 1 Anish Giri on Tuesday.Elsewhere, Arjun Erigaisi mounted a recovery from the poor start to the tournament with a much-needed draw against Germany‚Äôs Vincent Keymer, while last year‚Äôs Challengers winner, Leon Luke Mendonca, held off Giri in a 30-move battle.Meanwhile, Nodirbek Abdusattorov, Gukesh‚Äôs closest rival in the standings, secured a crucial win over Alexey Sarana with the white pieces. Pentala Harikrishna and Fabiano Caruana, after a gruelling 68-move duel, agreed to a draw.ALSO SEE: Tata Steel Chess 2025 Schedule In the Challengers section, it was a tough day for the Indian contingent as Vaishali Rameshbabu and Divya Deshmukh both suffered defeats, losing to table-topper Thai Dai Van Nguyen and Frederik Svane, respectively.

NEW DELHI: Upendra Yadav played a defiant knock of 95 to steer Railways to 241 on Day 1 of their Ranji Trophy clash against Delhi, a game marked by Virat Kohli ‚Äôs much-anticipated return to domestic red-ball cricket after 13 years.Delhi's pace trio ‚Äî Navdeep Saini , Siddhant Sharma, and Money Grewal ‚Äî made early inroads, reducing Railways to 66 for five in the first session by exploiting the morning conditions. However, Upendra, along with veteran spinner Karn Sharma (50 off 105), stitched a crucial 104-run stand for the sixth wicket, stabilising the innings.Kohli‚Äôs presence added an extra spark to the contest, energising both teams and drawing an unprecedented Ranji Trophy crowd of over 15,000 spectators.Upendra was on course for his third century of the season but fell late in the day, mistiming an aerial stroke off left-arm spinner Sumit Mathur to be caught at long-off. Before his dismissal, he had confidently pulled a couple of deliveries into the 90s, accumulating 10 fours and a six in his innings.Karn Sharma and Upendra‚Äôs partnership frustrated Delhi as the pitch eased out post-lunch. Delhi skipper Ayush Badoni, primarily a batter, remained his team‚Äôs leading wicket-taker for the season with his off-spin, highlighting the side‚Äôs bowling struggles.While Grewal impressed in the morning, Saini showcased his persistence in the afternoon session, breaking the crucial sixth-wicket stand in the 53rd over.He dismissed Karn Sharma, caught at fine leg after a rash slog, and trapped Ayan Chaudhari lbw on the very next delivery, swinging momentum back in Delhi‚Äôs favor before tea, leaving Railways at 182 for seven. Saini had earlier bowled opener Vivek Singh with a sharp, seaming delivery.Left-arm spinner Mathur cleaned up the tail, drawing cheers from the crowd, which was eagerly waiting for Kohli‚Äôs turn to bat.Saini and Grewal bowled 18 and 17 overs, respectively, while Siddhant Sharma was used sparingly with just nine overs.Kohli‚Äôs intensity remained high throughout, whether stationed at second slip for the pacers or moving to cover. He frequently engaged with the crowd, keeping the energy levels up. Briefly leaving the field twice, he returned to thunderous applause each time.With the anticipation building, the biggest moment will come on Friday when Kohli walks out to bat. At stumps, Delhi stood at 41 for one in 10 overs.","Upendra Yadav scores 95 to steer Railways to 241 on Day 1 of their Ranji Trophy clash against Delhi.

NEW DELHI: The unmatched aura of Virat Kohli was on full display at the Arun Jaitley Stadium as thousands of fans turned up for Delhi‚Äôs Ranji Trophy clash against Railways on Thursday, creating a surreal atmosphere rarely seen in domestic cricket.The excitement, however, reached a boiling point when an overzealous fan breached security, ran onto the field, and touched Kohli‚Äôs feet before being whisked away by officials.The incident occurred in the 12th over of Railways‚Äô innings, when Kohli was stationed at second slip.As the fan sprinted towards him, the crowd erupted in cheers. Security personnel rushed in to remove the intruder, but Kohli, ever composed, gestured for them to go easy on him. The dramatic moment summed up the fervor surrounding Kohli‚Äôs first domestic red-ball appearance in over 12 years.The Delhi & District Cricket Association (DDCA) had anticipated around 10,000 fans for Kohli‚Äôs return, an extraordinary number for a Ranji Trophy fixture. However, as the morning progressed, it became clear that the projections had fallen short.The officials have later confirmed that more than 15,000 fans are watching the match in the stadium.Despite the electrifying atmosphere, Delhi‚Äôs bowlers kept their focus, reducing Railways to 66/5.

Match ends in thrilling draw

NEW DELHI: Run-outs are often game-changers in cricket, capable of shifting momentum in an instant. But in a rare and unlucky turn of events, England U19 batter Aaryan Sawant suffered one of the most bizarre dismissals in recent memory during the first unofficial Test against South Africa U19 in Stellenbosch.Sawant, batting on 11 with England at 106/2 in their second innings, was facing left-arm spinner Jason Rowles. Attempting a sweep shot, he directed the ball towards short-leg fielder Jorich Van Schalkwyk. In a freakish sequence, the ball ricocheted off Van Schalkwyk‚Äôs helmet and crashed into the stumps while Sawant was out of his crease. The South African players immediately erupted in celebration, while Van Schalkwyk remained on the ground in pain from the impact, requiring medical attention.The incident left commentators in disbelief, with one remarking, ""When you think you've seen everything in cricket..."" - a sentiment echoed across social media as the video of the dismissal quickly went viral.The match itself was a gripping contest, ending in a nail-biting draw as South Africa finished at 295/9, just 22 runs short of the 317-run target set by England.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 England had posted 299 in their first innings before South Africa took a slender 20-run lead with 319.

Despite the unusual run-out, the game remained evenly poised until the final ball, with England needing just one more wicket for victory.While the match ended without a winner, Sawant‚Äôs dismissal will be remembered as one of the unluckiest in cricket history, proving once again that the sport never ceases to surprise.","England U19 batter Aaryan Sawant suffered one of the most bizarre dismissals in recent memory during the first unofficial Test against South Africa U19 in Stellenbosch.

Rinku Singh is fit and available for fourth T20I against England: Ryan ten Doeschate

Renowned for his 360-degree stroke play, Suryakumar Yadav is India's best T20I player, just as ICC Player of the Year 2024 Jasprit Bumrah is in Tests, according to former India batter Sanjay Manjrekar Surya's journey is one of the most inspiring in Indian cricket-making his national team debut at 30 and rising to become India's T20I captain in just three years.In the latest episode of Deep Point on Star Sports, experts Manjrekar and Sanjay Bangar delved into Surya's stature as India's top T20I batter and his potential as captain.Manjrekar strongly endorsed SKY as India's premier T20I batter, emphasising his meteoric rise from IPL standout to one of the finest players in the format today.""This has taken a lot of time; it didn't happen in just two years. He used to play for KKR (Kolkata Knight Riders), and I remember he had just two shots. Predictably, he would play the flick shot on the first ball of the innings, no matter where it landed. The growth of Suryakumar Yadav is incredible. Who would have predicted, when he was playing lower down the order for KKR, that he would go on to become the best T20I batter in the world?""Former India batting coach Bangar highlighted how the 34-year-old batter's exceptional skill is further elevated by his imagination and adaptability.""The method to this madness is proactiveness. It takes a lot of imagination, courage, and the ability to anticipate where the ball is coming from before it's even bowled-that's his hallmark,"" said Bangar.""During the Asia Cup, we analysed how, when bowlers try to adjust their deliveries after Surya gets into position, he still has another option to punish them. That‚Äôs his special ability. There are many players who can hit across 360 degrees, but his ability to abandon his plan and react to a delivery is amazing,"" he added.Commenting on Surya's captaincy, Bangar admitted he was surprised by Hardik Pandya 's exclusion but suggested that Surya could be the perfect leader for India's next generation of T20 talent.""Honestly, I was shocked that he was elevated to captain because, until that point, Hardik Pandya was the captain-designate. The way he handled that transition shows his great man-management skills. It's still early days, but he's the best fit for this young squad after the retirements of Jadeja, Kohli, and Rohit. That's a big plus - he can be the leader of this new generation, someone who is one among them,"" Bangar added.Under Suryakumar's captaincy, India have registered 16 wins and just four losses in T20Is. Manjrekar believes that Surya‚Äôs status as the team‚Äôs best player makes him the ideal choice to continue leading the side.""He has a great temperament. Throughout his career, you can see that after a strong innings, he always has a smile during his interviews. He's light-hearted. Just like Bumrah for India's Test captaincy, SKY is by far the best player on this T20I team,"" he said.Manjrekar also emphasised the importance of strong coaching support for Surya's captaincy.""In T20Is, if you have a great coach working alongside the captain, because you need outside inputs, I think he could be a great long-term leader. I'm very excited to see if he has any say in team selection because I‚Äôm looking forward to watching players like Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson, Rinku Singh making a comeback, and even Varun Chakravarthy getting a chance.""","Suryakumar Yadav is India's best T20I player, according to Sanjay Manjrekar and Sanjay Bangar. The 34-year-old made his national team debut at 30 and became captain in just three years. Bangar believes Surya could be the perfect leader for India's next generation of T20 talent.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117748283,imgsize-157300,width-400,resizemode-4/117748283.jpg"

Madness! Thousands welcome 'King' Virat Kohli

NEW DELHI: In what was rare for a Ranji Trophy match, thousands of people of all ages gathered around Delhi's Feroz Shah Kotla ground hours before play began for the first day of the Elite Group D match between Railways and Delhi. As the gates of the Arun Jaitley Stadium opened around 9 am, the spectators thronged the stands and cheered, and screamed, and danced. All for one man - Virat Kohli The crowd waited all day, hoping to see their hero at the crease. However, the day ended in disappointment for them after he didn't come out to bat as Delhi lost only one wicket, of opener Harshit Rana, in their 10 overs of batting with Yash Dhull and Sanat Sangwan ensuring no further damage against Railways.However, Virat will come out to bat on the second day if and when Delhi loses another wicket. But Railways' Upendra Yadav , who was the top scorer for his team, scoring 95, said that they have ""made plans"" for Kohli.""We had a discussion with our bowlers regarding him (Kohli) and we have made some plans for him, which I cannot tell right now,"" Upendra said while talking to the media after the day's play.""We have asked our bowlers to not get carried away, and bowl around the good-length area. A good bowl is as good for Virat bhaiya as it is for any other batter. If you bowl in good areas, you will get the results,"" Upendra added.Upendra missed his well-deserved hundred, which could have been his third of the season, by just 5 runs and lost his wicket while trying to hit a six over long-on to left-arm orthodox spinner, Sumit Mathur. When asked about his dismissal, Upendra said, ""I did not play it (the shot) because I was tired. I played it because I had confidence that I could clear the fielder.""Upendra, with his resolute defence and judicious stroke play, was at the forefront of Railways' recovery from 66-5 after Delhi's fast bowlers' early onslaught and built a 104-run partnership for the sixth wicket with Karn Sharma.Upendra was the highest scorer for the Railways (95 off 177 deliveries), followed by Karn Sharma (50 off 105), and helped his team reach a respectable total of 241.Earlier in the day, Kohli‚Äôs presence on the field led to an extraordinary turnout for a Ranji Trophy match, unlike anything seen in recent years.The Delhi and District Cricket Association ( DDCA ) had estimated a crowd of around 10,000 for Kohli‚Äôs much-anticipated homecoming ‚Äî an unprecedented figure for a domestic fixture. However, his immense star power shattered those expectations.Even before play began at 9:30 am, thousands of fans were eagerly pushing to enter the stadium, where entry remains free for domestic matches. Initially, the DDCA opened the 6,000-capacity ‚ÄòGautam Gambhir stand‚Äô for spectators, but as the crowd kept swelling, officials had no choice but to open the ‚ÄòBishan Singh Bedi stand,‚Äô which can accommodate around 11,000 people.","Virat Kohli didn't come out to bat on the first day of the Ranji Trophy match between Railways and Delhi. But Railways' Upendra Yadav said that they have ""made plans"" for Kohli. Upendra was the highest scorer for the Railways (95 off 177 deliveries), followed by Karn Sharma (50 off 105), and helped his team reach a respectable total of 241.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117746684,imgsize-101112,width-400,resizemode-4/117746684.jpg"
