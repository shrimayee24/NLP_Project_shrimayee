A goal for the ages: Alex Ovechkin breaks Wayne Gretzky's 26-year record



FULL Alex Ovechkin Celebration Ceremony After Record-Breaking Goal No. 895

A legacy passed down: Anastasia Shubskaya receives diamond tribute from Janet Gretzky



After Alex Ovechkin netted his 895th career goal and broke legendary Wayne Gretzky 's record, Janet Gretzky showed respect to a time-honored hockey tradition by gifting Anastasia Shubskaya , wife of Alex Ovechkin, an eight-carat diamond ring that had been estimated at $280,000. The Capitals may have lost to the New York Islanders by a score of 4-1, but the outcome was an afterthought to a night all about legacy, love, and a new chapter in hockey's history.The moment of history arrived at 7:26 of the second period. Alex Ovechkin let go of a blazing shot through fellow Russian Ilya Sorokin, making himself the NHL's all-time leading goal scorer. Fans inside UBS Arena lost their minds, and Alex Ovechkin commemorated the occasion by executing a belly flop onto the ice—celebrating his big achievement.Alex Ovechkin celebrated this achievement in a pregame ceremony against the Carolina Hurricanes on April 10, 2025. He was given a six-foot sculptural painting by TYP depicting his skates and game-used sticks, with his image on it, with “Most Goals All Time” written on the top and “895 Alex Ovechkin 895” on the bottom.While Alex Ovechkin was absorbing the enormity of his achievement, Anastasia Shubskaya was gifted a symbolic token of the historic night. Continuing a tradition started in 1994, when Colleen Howe (wife of Gordie Howe) gave Janet Gretzky a diamond ring after her husband, Wayne Gretzky, broke Colleen Howe’s husband’s record, Janet Gretzky ensured history repeated itself—this time from one hockey family to another.In an interview with the media, Wayne Gretzky said, “A month ago, my wife said, ‘You know, Colleen Howe started a tradition. I’m not sure if anyone is going to break Alex’s record, but I want to give her (Ovechkin’s wife, Anastasia Shubskaya) something really unique.’ So, we went out and she picked out an eight-diamond ring for Alex’s wife. Not only do hockey guys pass down traditions. So do the families and wives.”The act not only spanned generations of greatness but also underlined the strong relationship between hockey families across generations.Anastasia Shubskaya, who tied the knot with Alex Ovechkin in 2016, is a Russian model who has appeared in numerous Russian magazines during her career and has built a strong social media presence. They are proud parents of two sons- Sergei and Ilya.Also read: “Now the real stuff is coming”: Alex Ovechkin skips The Tonight Show appearance to stay playoff-ready Even though the Capitals fell on the evening, the larger context is one of hope. The team had already secured a playoff berth and now has the emotional tailwind of reaching a once-a-generation milestone. With the NHL playoffs coming, Alex Ovechkin and the Washington Capitals aim to ride the wave of history toward what would be a fairy tale conclusion to the 2025 campaign.","Alex Ovechkin scored his 895th career goal, breaking Wayne Gretzky's 26-year record.

What is Scottie Pippen's Net Worth in 2025?

Scottie Pippen has played in the NBA for 17 seasons and has six NBA Championship wins under his belt. The athlete is considered to be one of the greatest small forwards in NBA history. Additionally, his achievements include being one of the two players in history who have won an Olympic Gold Medal and an NBA title twice in the same year. After earning great fame and recognition, we are taking a look at how this has impacted his financial portfolio.According to Celebrity Net Worth, Scottie Pippen has a net worth of $20 million. This comes after playing with the Chicago Bulls for 12 seasons, with the Houston Rockets for one season and the Portland Trail Blazers for four seasons. After all the achievements and accolades, his net worth is not as high as his peers. This comes after the star is known to be one of the most underpaid players of all time. He signed a 7-year contract with the Bulls for $18 million. Thus, when the Bulls were at their peak and Michael Jordan would earn $30+ million annually, Pippen would only earn $2.6 million.However, his contract with the Houston Rockets earned him a staggering $67.2 million. Post this, when he joined the Bulls during the last two years of his career, he earned $10 million. While he has earned over $109 million over the years as an NBA player, his net worth has diminished massively.Pippen's net worth also accounted to numerous brand endorsements.

Poll Which team will win the upcoming match: CSK or KKR? KKR CSK

Are CSK making the best use of Jadeja?

CHENNAI: There was much drama in the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) camp on the eve of their must-win game against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). Ruturaj Gaikwad , who was hit by a Tushar Deshpande delivery in the game against Rajasthan Royals in Guwahati last week, appears to have a broken elbow.“Ruturaj has been ruled out of the rest of the IPL with a broken elbow. And now a certain uncapped player called MS Dhoni will lead us,” coach Stephen Fleming said.Gaikwad hasn’t been at his best and it will be interesting to see if CSK go back to senior player Rahul Tripathi at the top of the order or throw in one of the rookies — Shaikh Rashid or Andre Siddarth — into the deep end.Asked whether it was difficult to make Dhoni take up the captaincy again, Fleming said, “No, he understood the situation. Ruturaj didn’t want to go but it’s an unfortunate situation.”The injury complicates an already complicated situation for CSK, who have only one win out of five. Another loss here on Friday may just make the uphill road to playoffs qualification all the more difficult. But then, their opponents KKR aren’t exactly better off either.The defending champions have won only two of their five matches and it’s extremely important that they take full points here. There’s one thing, though, that may just help the Knight Riders at the MA Chidambaram Stadium — the pitch. They have complained a lot about their home pitch at the Eden, but here, their spinners might get the purchase they are looking for.For a long time, one of the centrepieces of Chennai Super Kings’ success has been Ravindra Jadeja. It was his consistency over the years that made CSK shell out Rs 18 cr to retain him. However, in the five games that CSK have played so far, it seems that their former captain has been underutilised to a degree.In none of the games did the experienced left-arm spinner get his full quota of four overs. In 13 of the 20 available overs that he bowled, Jadeja gave away 105 runs, going at an economy rate of 8.“We have six options. It’s not a set stage for anybody, we try to go according to the situation,” coach Fleming said on Thursday.Meanwhile, as a batter too, Jadeja has been limited to the role of a finisher at a time when the top order has struggled.“We really like his partnership with MS at the back end. That appeals to us,” Fleming said.",Ruturaj Gaikwad has been ruled out of the rest of the IPL with a broken elbow. MS Dhoni will lead the Chennai Super Kings against Kolkata Knight Riders. Ravindra Jadeja has been underutilised in the five games CSK have played.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120188531,imgsize-77758,width-400,resizemode-4/Dhoni-Fleming.jpg"

Most expensive bowling returns in IPL history

Highest total for Punjab Kings in IPL

NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad pacer Mohammed Shami endured a night to forget on Saturday, recording the second most expensive bowling figures in Indian Premier League (IPL) history during a hammering at the hands of Punjab Kings .Shami was taken for a staggering 75 runs in his four overs, finishing with figures of 0 for 75 — just one run short of the unwanted record of 0 for 76 set by Rajasthan Royals' Jofra Archer earlier this season at the same venue.The veteran seamer had already gone for 48 runs in his first three overs, but things spiraled in the 20th over when Marcus Stoinis launched a brutal assault. The Australian all-rounder smashed Shami for four consecutive sixes off the final four balls of the innings, collecting 27 runs in the over. His last over read: 1, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6.0/76 - Jofra Archer (RR) vs SRH, Hyderabad, 20250/75 - Mohammed Shami (SRH) vs PBKS, Hyderabad, 2025*0/73 - Mohit Sharma (GT) vs DC, Delhi, 20240/70 - Basil Thampi (SRH) vs RCB, Bengaluru, 20180/69 - Yash Dayal (GT) vs KKR, Ahmedabad, 2023Stoinis, who finished unbeaten on 34 off just 11 balls, said at the break, ""Nice to make a contribution, a little cameo from me there. There was a bit of spin and bounce. It's a very good score, depends on how we start in the powerplay and how we finish.""Punjab’s massive total was built on the foundation of a blistering 82 off 36 balls from captain Shreyas Iyer , who struck six fours and six sixes. His fifty came off just 22 balls, marking his fastest IPL half-century.Punjab's final total was their second highest in IPL history , behind only their 262/2 against KKR last season.262/2 vs KKR, Kolkata, 2024245/6 vs SRH, Hyderabad, 2025*243/5 vs GT, Ahmedabad, 2025232/2 vs RCB, Dharamsala, 2011231/4 vs CSK, Cuttack, 2014","Mohammed Shami recorded the second most expensive bowling figures in Indian Premier League (IPL) history.

Sai Sudharsan Exclusive Interview: 'The dream is to play Test cricket'

Lucknow: Lucknow Super Giants star batters Nicholas Pooran and Aiden Markram unleashed spectacular half-centuries and produced a formidable batting display on home ground to secure a commanding six-wicket victory over Gujarat Titans .LSG’s third consecutive victory took them to third on the points table, while GT slipped to second spot behind Delhi Capitals.After being put in to bat by LSG skipper Rishabh Pant , the Titans could only manage 180/6 in 20 overs even though skipper Shubham Gill and Sai Sudharsan gave the team a fine start by scoring impressive half centuries. After the 12th over, GT were 120/0 and apparently headed for a big total, but they lost six wickets for 60 runs in the last eight overs, handing the initiative back to LSG.During the chase, the out-of-form Pant — opening the innings in place of the absent Mitchell Marsh, whose daughter is unwell — and Markram (58; 31 balls; 9x4, 1x6) put on a solid 65-run stand in 6.1 overs. Pant managed 21 runs off 18 balls this time but again, couldn’t really hit top gear as he was dismissed by Prasidh Krishna.Orange-Cap holder Pooran (61 off 34b; 1x4, 7x6) joined hands with Markram and both orchestrated a spectacular display of towering sixes and boundaries to please the locals. They put on 58 runs off 29 balls before Prasidh again provided the crucial breakthrough to send back Markram.Ayush Badoni and David Miller then ensured there would be no hiccups as Lucknow cantered to the target.Gujarat Titans’ marquee pacer Mohammed Siraj gave away 50 runs off four wicketless overs. Sai Kishore was also expensive, conceding 35 runs in 1.3 overs.Earlier, Sudharsan (56 off 37) struck his fourth fifty of the season and created a platform for a massive total with Gill (60 off 38), but the rest of the lineup faltered as the home team bowlers made a valiant comeback.","LSG’s third consecutive victory took them to third on the points table, while GT slipped to second spot behind Delhi Capitals.

Kolkata: If winning is a habit, trust Mohun Bagan SG to make it a magical monotony at home this season.Let them face the biggest of challenges, let them have all sorts of odds stacked against them and let them be forced to trail with a title at stake. But invariably and unflinchingly, expect Jose Molina’s men to find a way out of the crisis and have the last laugh. Bengaluru FC learnt this in quite a compelling way at the Salt Lake Stadium. Gerard Zaragoza’s visitors were welcomed to the Bagan’s formidable fortress with a giant tifo from the home fans — “Champion’s home, entry prohibited.”Yet they silenced the thunderous crowd when Alberto Rodriguez was forced into conceding an own goal while dealing with Ryan Williams’ centre in the 49th minute.Jason Cummings’ penalty in the 72nd minute and Jamie Maclaren’s poacher’s goal six minutes into the first half of extra time were all Bagan required to script a turnaround in a 2-1 win here on Saturday and become the second team after Mumbai City FC to complete the Indian Super League double.A year ago, Bagan lost a similar opportunity to Mumbai City at the same place. But this season they seemed to be a different beast, assuming a juggernaut crushing one opponent after another at home to stretch their winning run to 14 matches. Two months after sealing their back-to-back Shield, they deservedly lifted the ISL Cup in front of 59,112 spectators.It’s quite a journey for Molina’s men. Nine months ago, BFC inflicted the heaviest defeat on them (0-3), putting Molina’s Bagan project under serious question mark. Now claiming the double at BFC’s expense should come as completion of a circle for the winners.Bagan began in a way culled straight from their playbook, setting the alarm bells ringing in the all-Indian rival defence with some trademark moves from the wings. Having somehow managed to weather that storm, BFC started to establish a more recognizable rhythm. BFC duly and deservedly went ahead soon after the restart. It started with another incisive run from Ryan Williams down the right and the Australian delivered an inviting cross. Rodriguez ended up miskicking it into his own.Molina sought intervention from the bench. The introduction of Ashique Kuruniyan and Sahal Abdul Samad brought pace and panache to the attack. When Cummings swivelled to take aim, it looked destined for a goal but Gurpreet denied him. But BFC caved in to Bagan’s constant pressure.As Maclaren tried to get past Chinglensana Singh following Cummings’ centre, the ball touched the BFC centre-back’s hands, forcing referee Senthil Nathan to point to the spot. Cummings made no mistake in beating Gurpreet.Maclaren then provided the coup de grace.",Mohun Bagan beat Bengaluru FC 2-1 to complete the ISL Shield and Cup double.

Why an icon from Hindi heartland became Chennai’s superhero | #dhoni #ipl I Witness

Chennai: A sapling is being planted for every dot ball bowled in this IPL , and a meme all over the Internet since Friday night is an AI image of a jungle around the MA Chidambaram Stadium!Netizens, of course, are on overdrive because of the poor quality of cricket that Chennai Super Kings , the home team at the MAC, has dished out over the last three weeks. They have lost five of the six games, including three at home. And the worst bit about the defeats is that there hasn’t been any real contest in any of these matches — the lack of intent has made the five-time champions a painful watch.To start off, it’s their ‘new skipper’ MS Dhoni and his approach. Twice in this IPL, he has chosen to come out at No. 9, which included the horrendous show on Friday, when they managed 103-9 against Kolkata Knight Riders. The bowlers were in their rhythm, batters kept coming and going, but Dhoni wouldn’t come out to bat. He is apparently at his best after the 15th over. Not that he set the stage on fire, getting out for 1 to Sunil Narine.Harbhajan Singh, his former India and CSK teammate, said on his YouTube show that Dhoni’s decision to bat at No. 9 was inexplicable.“If he is batting at No. 9, he shouldn’t be playing. He is a better player than that. He has shown he can hit those big sixes, then why bat so low? He is tarnishing his own legacy,” Bhajji, who won the IPL with CSK under Dhoni in 2018, said.The truth of the matter is that Dhoni, who once hit Axar Patel for three sixes in the last over to win Rising Pune Supergiant a game, simply struggles against spin at this stage of his career. If there is no pace off the bowler, he struggles to create his own pace. When it’s fast wrist-spin, the legend doesn’t seem to know which way the ball is turning. There is a reluctance to run the quick singles too, of which he was a master in his heyday. His only chance is against pacers erring in line and length at the deep end.The fact that he is averaging 3 in the games that CSK have won and around 40 when they have lost in the last couple of years shows that MSD is no longer the match-winner that he used to be.CSK, for a decade, set the template for playing T20 cricket for teams across the globe, including national sides. But in recent years, the game has gone in a different direction. Preservation in the middle for an all-assault in the last few overs has become an outdated concept. CSK, though, have been unable to adapt, choosing players from the auction who cannot take on the opposition in the Powerplay.In addition to that, players like Rahul Tripathi, Vijay Shankar, R Ashwin are well past their sell-by date as top players. Still, CSK refuse to throw in youngsters like Shaik Rasheed, Vansh Bedi or Andre Siddarth into the deep end.“We still think we have the right team. Yes, we have some good youngsters, but they should be introduced when they are ready. We don’t want to put out the white flag yet. The youngsters can come in when we don’t have a chance,” batting coach Mike Hussey said.","CSK have lost five of the six games, including three at home.

Hyderabad: A string of four defeats failed to deter the Orange Army from turning up in numbers, and they were fully rewarded with Abhishek Sharma scoring his maiden IPL century.Saturday night saw a mind-numbing number of fours and sixes and a grand total of 492 runs being scored at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium as Abhishek took centrestage. His 141, the highest by an Indian in the IPL, shaded the breezy 82 (36b, 6x4, 6x6) from Punjab Kings skipper Shreyas Iyer.The SRH opening duo of Abhishek and Travis Head took the attack to the opposition in an audacious display of attacking batsmanship. Imagine Head being reduced to a mere spectator! By the time the Australian fell for a brisk 66 (37b, 9x4, 3x6), Abhishek was nearing his century, which he dedicated to ‘the Orange Army’ . The opening stand of 171 runs came in just 75 deliveries as Punjab paid the price for the lifeline Abhishek got on 27. He was caught off a no-ball by Impact player Yash Thakur.Such was his domination that by the time he fell, SRH needed just 24 more runs from 22 deliveries. Heinrich Klaasen and Ishan Kishan finished the match at 247/2 and the eight-wicket win with nine deliveries to spare should do the Sunrisers’ confidence a lot of good after the misery their bowlers suffered earlier.As for Iyer, his open stance was brilliant as it helped in easy execution of his shots, most of them being effortless sixes. His job was made easy by the 66-run foundation laid by the red-hot Priyansh Arya and Prabhsimran Singh. The left-right opening combination ran the Hyderabad attack ragged after Iyer decided to bat on a wicket on which SRH had posted 286/6 in their first match.The first three overs by Mohammed Shami and Pat Cummins went for 53, and by the time Arya fell for 36 (13b, 2x4, 4x6), the visitors were well placed for their third score over 200.Shami, meanwhile, had a forgetful night. He went for 37 in his first two overs and 27 in the last, with Stoinis smashing the last four deliveries for sixes.","Abhishek Sharma scored a century for Sunrisers Hyderabad against Punjab Kings in Hyderabad in IPL 2025.

One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Bill Belichick acknowledges key mistake in 2018 that impacted New England Patriots’ future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/bill-belichick-acknowledges-key-mistake-in-2018-that-impacted-new-england-patriots-future/articleshow/120221669.cms,"Image via Imagn Images

Bill Belichick reflects on the missed opportunity that changed Patriots’s QB search

Over the course of his distinguished career, Bill Belichick crafted a formidable dynasty with the New England Patriots, solidifying his legacy as one of the NFL's all-time great coaches. Under his direction, particularly during the Tom Brady era, the Patriots were consistently in Super Bowl contention. Yet, despite his many triumphs, Belichick recently confessed to a significant mistake, one that may have had a lasting impact on the team's success.The mistake Bill Belichick referred to goes back to the 2018 season, a year that, despite ending in a Super Bowl win, was filled with behind-the-scenes tension and questionable decisions. One of the most criticized moves was his decision to sideline cornerback Malcolm Butler in Super Bowl LII. The unexpected benching sparked confusion among players and fans alike, and Belichick now admits it may have disrupted the team's chemistry.In a forthcoming book, Bill Belichick reflects on some of the choices he wishes he could revisit one of the most debated being his decision to pass on Lamar Jackson during the 2018 NFL Draft .With the 31st overall pick, the Patriots had a prime opportunity to secure a future star. Instead, they selected running back Sony Michel, while Jackson was scooped up immediately afterward by the Baltimore Ravens. Since then, Jackson has emerged as one of the league’s most explosive quarterbacks, reshaping the Ravens’ offense with his mobility and earning an MVP title along the way.Although Michel made valuable contributions most notably helping the Patriots win their last Super Bowl in the Tom Brady era his long-term impact hasn’t matched Jackson’s game-changing presence. In hindsight, Belichick admits the decision stands out even more sharply, especially given New England's ongoing search for a dependable quarterback after Brady’s exit.Since Brady’s departure, the Patriots have gone through multiple quarterbacks, none of whom have managed to bring lasting stability. Although the rise of Drake Maye has sparked optimism for what’s ahead, there’s still a strong belief that Lamar Jackson could have been the ideal solution to their quarterback struggles.Despite all of Belichick’s accomplishments over the years, passing on Jackson remains a what-if moment, one that might have completely altered the course of the Patriots’ journey in the post-Brady era.Also Read: “I don’t care, and it never ends”: Josh Berry sounds off on Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce obsession As Belichick reflects on his legacy, it's clear that even the most brilliant minds can second-guess their past decisions. While his career is filled with unmatched achievements, the choice to overlook Lamar Jackson in 2018 serves as a reminder that every draft pick can shape a franchise’s future for better or worse. For Patriots fans, it remains a lingering “what could have been” in the story of life after Brady.",Bill Belichick reflects on missed opportunity that changed Patriots’s QB search.

Alex Ovechkin's tribute night ruffles feathers among Washington Capitals fans



Ovechkin Makes History, Capitals Make It Special!

Wayne Gretzky's Rolls-Royce comment creates unrealistic expectations



Alex Ovechkin finally broke Wayne Gretzky's record of 894 goals, and he is now the NHL's all-time leading scorer. The Washington Capitals superstar was honoured with a touching ceremony amidst thousands of cheering fans. But while the franchise lavished gifts and accolades on Alex Ovechkin and his family with the finest luxuries, some fans were left feeling disappointed, particularly following Wayne Gretzky's suggestion of a Rolls-Royce gift that created greater expectations.The Washington Capitals threw everything at their disposal into celebrating Alex Ovechkin's record-breaking accomplishment. The 39-year-old forward, who spent 15 games out of the lineup with a broken leg this season, still broke the NHL all-time goal record.President of Hockey Operations Brian MacLellan gave Alex Ovechkin a full-sized golden hockey stick—engraved and constructed as a one-of-a-kind commemorative piece. The star's sons, Sergei and Ilya Ovechkin, accepted miniature versions of the same stick, while Ted Leonsis distributed luxury watches—Rolexes for Ovi and his mother, and a Cartier for his wife, Anastasia Shubskaya.And to top it all off, the Capitals revealed a sculptural piece of art by Detroit artist TYP. The 6-foot work of art, puck-shaped and sporting actual casts of Ovechkin's skates and stick, brought a three-dimensional element to the tribute. While Ovechkin was visibly emotional, fans were divided in their reactions.“We were there, and the lighting made it look like it was papier-mâché, like a piñata? We thought for sure something was going to pop out. Like football kids through the banner…” a fan said.Some of the backlash came as a result of comments Wayne Gretzky made before the ceremony. “I told Mr. Leonsis, when I broke the record, they got me a Rolls-Royce. So I hope they get you something,” he said.“I really thought after the Gretzky comment that Leonsis was going to toss Ovi keys to a new Rolls-Royce,” another fan shared.Also Read: No more chasing—Alex Ovechkin’s hitting back as Capitals surge to top Alex Ovechkin, however, remained grateful. “It’s such a great moment for me, my family, and the organization, for DC.

Poll Should athletes be held accountable for supplements purchased from local stores? Only if they are aware of the risks No, they cannot verify ingredients Yes, they should be responsible

Bengaluru: Asian Games silver medallist in men's 10,000m, Kartik Kumar , has failed out-of-competition dope test conducted by the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) during his recent training stint in the United States.According to sources, Kumar's sample collected by USADA officials towards the end of February, from his training base in Colorado Springs, returned an Adverse Analytical Finding for testosterone and its metabolites. Another sample, which was collected in the middle of March, also returned a positive test, the stakeholders were informed.The positive result of Kumar, who will turn 26 next month, came as a shocker for athletics experts as Kumar came up the ladder the hard way. At the 2023 Asian Games in Hangzhou, Kumar ran a superb race to bag India's first medal in the event in 25 years when he finished second in 28:15.38s ahead of Gulveer Singh who took bronze. Meanwhile, sources added that Gulveer's samples collected on the same dates have returned negative results.“He was a medal prospect for next month's Asian Athletics meet in Gumi, South Korea. A gold medal there would have won him a berth at the Worlds as continental champion. Even otherwise, he was certain to qualify through the world ranking route,” an expert told TOI after hearing the disappointing news.According to sources, Army athlete Kumar, who was in the US along with national record holder Gulveer to train under coach Scott Simmons, believes that supplements purchased at his native place in Saharanpur could be the reason for failing the test.Kumar, who returned to India at the end of last month, was getting into prime shape ahead of the big meets scheduled later this year. He ran his season's best time of 14:05.67s in 5000m in Boston on Feb 14 and 28:11.34 in 10,000m last month in San Juan Capistrano.

Poll What do you think about the on-field exchange between Travis Head and Glenn Maxwell? Not sure, needs context It adds excitement to the game It was unprofessional It's just friendly banter

Australian cricketers Travis Head , Glenn Maxwell , and Marcus Stoinis engaged in a heated exchange during an IPL 2025 match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Punjab Kings at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium, where SRH successfully chased down 246 runs in 18.3 overs with eight wickets remaining.The on-field tension began in the ninth over when Head hit Maxwell for consecutive sixes. After Head attempted to make room, Maxwell delivered a quicker-length ball that Head hit back to him, leading to Maxwell throwing the ball towards the keeper.Head took offence to Maxwell's actions, resulting in a verbal exchange between the two players. The incident escalated when Stoinis intervened, prompting Head to dismiss him while the umpire called for calm.The match saw Head's dismissal three overs later, caught by Maxwell off Yuzvendra Chahal's bowling.Head later downplayed the incident in his statement to broadcasters: ""It's all fun. I think they probably bring the best and the worst out of you when you know each other and play each other so much. So, yeah, a bit of friendly banter between us, but it's all good. I got to put up with them at home, so nothing to it.""The game featured exceptional batting performances from both teams. Punjab Kings posted 245-6, with Shreyas Iyer scoring 82 and Marcus Stoinis contributing a quick 34.Sunrisers Hyderabad's response was dominated by Abhishek Sharma 's remarkable 141 off 55 balls, marking his first IPL century.

Carlos Alcaraz secured his first Monte Carlo Masters final appearance by defeating fellow Spaniard Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 7-6 (7/2), 6-4 on Saturday. He will face 13th-seeded Italian Lorenzo Musetti , who overcame Australian eighth seed Alex de Minaur 1-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) in the second semi-final.Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz is seeking his first Masters title since his victory at Indian Wells last year. His only title this season came at the ATP 500 event in Rotterdam in February.""I knew how well Davidovich Fokina had played in Monte Carlo so I had to be ready to fight,"" said Alcaraz.""It's been a long time since I've had the chance to win a title on clay and I can't wait to try my luck again here,"" Alcaraz said, referencing his Olympic final loss to Novak Djokovic in August.""At the beginning of the week, the first tournament on clay, you have to get used to the conditions,"" he added. ""The ball comes different. You know, the play on clay is different... I'm just really happy to get the level that I wanted at the beginning of the week.""Alcaraz emerged as the tournament favourite following early exits by top seed Alexander Zverev and Novak Djokovic, while world number one Jannik Sinner remains suspended due to a doping ban.""The first question, you know, since Jannik was unable to play tournaments, a lot of people were asking me and talking about, how important (the) moment that I have ahead is to reach the number one (ranking) again or to win tournaments or whatever,"" Alcaraz said. ""I was thinking so much about it instead of playing my good tennis and enjoy the time that I have, stepping on the court and playing matches.""The 21-year-old Spaniard started strongly against world number 42 Davidovich Fokina, securing an early break. However, Davidovich Fokina fought back to level at 5-5 before losing the first-set tiebreak 7/2.Alcaraz broke early again in the second set and maintained his advantage despite Davidovich Fokina saving 13 break points and four match points.In the other semi-final, Musetti overcame a difficult start where he lost all four service games in the first set. The Italian regained his composure in the second set, breaking De Minaur in the ninth game.The decisive third set saw multiple service breaks before heading to a tiebreak, where Musetti prevailed on his first match point when De Minaur hit a forehand into the net.""It means so much. Honestly, it's unexpected,"" said Musetti, who will enter the world's top 10 if he wins the final. ""If I look back where we started, at the beginning of the week, I was of course dreaming to be in final and to have the chance to play for the top 10, for the title, for a lot of things.""The final will be a rematch between Alcaraz and Musetti, with the Spaniard winning their last three encounters. However, Musetti won their only previous final meeting in Hamburg in 2022.""For sure the key of that match was the mental part,"" added Musetti. ""So hopefully tomorrow I'll do the same.""The match represents a significant milestone for both players, with Alcaraz seeking his first clay court Masters title since Indian Wells and Musetti appearing in the biggest final of his career.","Carlos Alcaraz beats Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 7-6 (7/2), 6-4 in Monte Carlo Masters semi-final.

In one of the most thrilling double-headers of the IPL season, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Lucknow Super Giants pulled off memorable chases on Saturday — with SRH achieving the second-highest successful chase in league history and LSG hunting down a tricky target with clinical efficiency.At the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium, Abhishek Sharma delivered the knock of a lifetime, smashing a record 141 off just 55 balls as SRH chased down Punjab Kings’ mammoth 245 with eight wickets in hand and nine balls to spare. It was a night to remember for the southpaw, who brought up his maiden IPL hundred in just 40 deliveries — the third fastest by an Indian — and finished with the highest IPL score by an Indian batter. His brutal knock featured 14 boundaries and 10 sixes.Abhishek shared a 171-run stand with Travis Head (66 off 37) — the highest partnership of the season — which completely flattened the PBKS bowling attack. Heinrich Klaasen (21*) applied the finishing touches after Head and Abhishek departed.Earlier, Shreyas Iyer ’s 82 and Marcus Stoinis’ unbeaten 34 off 11 had powered PBKS to a daunting 245/6, but SRH’s power-packed top order made light work of the target.
