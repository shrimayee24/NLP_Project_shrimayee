“Aaron has an eclectic brain”: Mike McCarthy clarified that Aaron Rodgers' off-field interests did not interfere with his leadership or the Packers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/aaron-has-an-eclectic-brain-mike-mccarthy-clarified-that-aaron-rodgers-off-field-interests-did-not-interfere-with-his-leadership-or-the-packers/articleshow/116564793.cms,"Image via USA Today Network

Mike McCarthy ensures that Aaron Rodgers's off-field interests did not distract the Green Bay Packers

Aaron Rodgers and Mike McCarthy's time with the Green Bay Packers came to an end in 2018 when McCarthy was fired. Six years later, McCarthy is the Dallas Cowboys coach and Rodgers is the quarterback for the New York Jets, where he appeared on Rodgers's Netflix docuseries, Aaron Rodgers: Enigma. Mike McCarthy joined Shan, Bobby, and Jared for a discussion on the upcoming match against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He discussed the Aaron Rodgers documentary, Cooper Rush's progress, Baker Mayfield's tape, college quarterbacks, and the transfer portal.Mike McCarthy was interviewed for this docuseries exploring the journey of Aaron Rodgers: from junior college to four-time NFL MVP, discussing not only his off-field activities but also his recovery from a torn achilles in 2023 and his use of psychedelic ayahuasca. Throughout the years, Rodgers has been open to unusual topics, such as ayahuasca and his darkness retreat in 2023.McCarthy, who coached Rodgers on the Packers from 2006 to '18, clarified that Rodgers' off-field interests did not interfere with his leadership or the Packers. Instead, McCarthy complimented Rodgers's interests and their contribution to the ""current event"" discussions at the beginning of meetings. McCarthy clarified that these discussions are part of every team he has coached.“The current events is something I’ve always been a part of,"" McCarthy said on 105.3 The Fan. ""I learned it from our old offensive line coach, Alex Gibbs ... That's a common practice among quarterback rooms I've been a part of. What was really cool about Aaron is Aaron has an eclectic brain, interests, and was always very well read. The current events was always a fun time to start the day.”The recent tone of McCarthy and Rodgers has drastically changed since the time they were together in Green Bay, which was characterized by rumors of tension. According to Tyler Dunne in 2019, Rodgers believed McCarthy had a ""low football IQ,"" and both egos did not help the Packers. Former Packers coach and quarterback duo McCarthy and Rodgers also stated ""appreciation"" for their time together in Green Bay two years ago.“It’s probably normal in any relationship you have,” Rodgers told the media in 2022. “When you’re able to take time away and you have that separation, it’s natural to look back and have a greater sense of appreciation and gratitude and thankfulness for that time.”McCarthy added at the time, ""When I think of him, I think of the one-on-one conversations we used to have, especially in the younger days. And it always ended with a hug and, ‘I love ya.’ So that’s what I think about our relationship. I think he made me a much better coach.”Also Read: “He is a narcissist”: ESPN’s Dan Graziano went totally ballistic left no doubt as to how he feels about Aaron Rodgers","Mike McCarthy was interviewed for Aaron Rodgers' Netflix docuseries, Aaron Rodgers: Enigma.

Taylor Swift Wants A Private “White Wedding” Which Will Be Away From The Media



Travis Kelce Finds It “Overwhelming” How Much Their Fans Speculate About An Engagement



As Taylor Swift celebrated her 35th birthday party in an Eras-themed birthday celebration, many fans speculated if she and Travis Kelce were already engaged. As per Daily Mail, a source close to the couple has denied such rumours but has also given an interesting detail about the kind of wedding Taylor wants.

They might be spotted outside hanging out or on date nights but they never reveal too much about their relationship in public forums. As per Daily Mail, the source has revealed that even their closest friends want fans to calm down so that the couple can enjoy their relationship. The source also highlighted that an engagement is something both Taylor and her boyfriend, the NFL star and the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, Travis Kelce are looking forward to but this is not the right time for it. They are deeply in love with one another and want to enjoy their relationship. Contrary to public opinion, apparently both Taylor and Travis find it very funny that fans have spread stories about them being engaged since the beginning of their relationship and there is literally no truth to it.Travis also finds it “overwhelming” due to the number of stories people make about their engagement and future plans. Every time there has been a big event in either Taylor or Travis’ careers, there have been stories about an engagement taking place. Though neither Travis nor Taylor have issued any public statements about it but as per Daily Mail, the source close to the couple has revealed that they know the stories being circulated about them but they tend to not react to them.The source has also revealed that Travis already has few ideas about their engagement and wants it to be a memorable day for Taylor so he will not leave any stone unturned to make it possibly the best day in Taylor’s life but he will not go public with his plans.

Tom Brady did not hesitate to reveal the Kansas City Chiefs as his pick for the Super Bowl in the 2024-2025 NFL season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tom-brady-did-not-hesitate-to-reveal-the-kansas-city-chiefs-as-his-pick-for-the-super-bowl-in-the-2024-2025-nfl-season/articleshow/116564297.cms,"Image via Imagn Images

Tom Brady continues to back the Chiefs when it comes to winning championships

Kansas City Chiefs qualified for Week 16 of the 2024 NFL Season with the other game played Saturday, December 26, where they won 27-19 against the Houston Texans. The Baltimore Ravens won the last NFL game for the day with a final score of 34-17 against the Pittsburgh Steelers.Legendary quarterback and Fox Sports analyst Tom Brady called this final game between the Baltimore Ravens and the Pittsburgh Steelers together with Kevin Burkhardt and Erin Andrews. In the fourth quarter, Burkhardt asked Brady who he thought would win Super Bowl LIX, and the former Patriots and Buccaneers star predicted the Chiefs to win three-peat.The Buffalo Bills were installed as the favorites to win Super Bowl LIX with +425 odds entering Week 16. Josh Allen was considered the frontrunner for the MVP award. But Saturday's showcase games showed that there were no sure bets in the National Football League. Patrick Mahomes led the Kansas City Chiefs over the Houston Texans, 27-19.Lamar Jackson led the Baltimore Ravens-breaking the playoffs with a win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Both Kansas City's and Baltimore's Super Bowl odds were among the top five going into the weekend, behind the Buffalo Bills, Philadelphia Eagles (+475), and Detroit Lions (+475) but ahead of the Chiefs (+600) and Ravens (+800).Tom Brady, who won a total of seven Super Bowl championships, expressed his opinions regarding which teams, he thinks, hold the advantage heading into postseason play, having just seen the Ravens beat the Steelers 34-17 on FOX. And Brady is picking the Chiefs to be the Super Bowl winner because of Mahomes, especially if it's close.""If it's a one-score game, I'm taking Patrick Mahomes anytime because he's got that championship DNA,"" Brady said. ""He doesn't flinch, either. The way that Josh Allen has played this year, he's right in the hunt for MVP, along with Saquon [Barkley] and Lamar [Jackson]. They're just tremendous as they come down the stretch.”In Week 11, the Bills defeated the Chiefs by 30-21, with Josh Allen's impressive performance leading the way. With this win, Allen improved his regular-season record against Kansas City to 4-1; however, he remains 0-3 in the postseason against Mahomes and Co. Brady also mentioned that playoffs are a different beast than regular-season games.""These games, in the end, come down to turnovers. Who converts a third down? Whether it's a missed kick or not. There's games to be decided in terms of standings as you go into the playoffs, but once you get there, man: It's a one-game, single-elimination tournament. You are all-out to see who, ultimately, can play their best in the biggest moments.”Also Read: Tom Brady criticized De'Vondre Campbell during the Baltimore Ravens vs. Pittsburgh Steelers broadcast, receiving praise from NFL fans Brady has started 48 NFL-most playoff games, averaging 35-13.

What’s inside Virat Kohli’s kit bag?

'Top order should get more runs'

MELBOURNE: In one sudden move, a citadel lies in ruins. The Ravindra Jadeja-Ravichandran Ashwin combine, one of the game's greatest ever spin-bowling pairs, has met an untidy end with Ashwin's abrupt retirement.If the end of their era deserved a more sentimental flourish, Ravindra Jadeja was having none of it on Saturday as the Indian team hit the nets here at the MCG.""Move on toh hona hi padega (one must move on),"" Jadeja said. ""Hopefully, Indian cricket will get a good spinner and allrounder in Ashwin's place. In India, aisa to hai nehi ki koi uski jagah nehi le sakta (it's not as if there's nobody to replace Ashwin).""Whoever goes, we get some replacement or the other. It's also good for the youngsters. Whichever youngster replaces him will get a good opportunity to prove himself at this level,"" he added.Jadeja isn't someone to wax philosophical, and his pragmatic approach to what he termed an unexpected move from Ashwin is probably best for the team heading into the crucial fourth Test.""I got to know at the last moment (about the retirement), just five minutes before he came for the press conference. Someone informed me. The whole day we were sitting together, and he didn't even give me a hint. Ashwin ko to sab jante hi hai, uska dimaag kaisa hai (everyone knows he's a bit quirky),"" Jadeja said with a smile.The pair, which came together in Dec 2012 in Nagpur against England, formed the impenetrable core of India's home domination for over a decade. In tandem, they bowled in 58 Tests, 49 of them at home, and earned a 71.42 home win percentage, with only six losses.Ashwin was the shape shifter, possessing the rare skill to constantly remake himself. Jadeja could bend steel with relentless accuracy.They are both very different personalities but fed off each other's strengths, improving their career averages when they bowled together. Away from home, though, they were often competitors for the lone spinner's slot.""Obviously he was like an on-field mentor,"" Jadeja said. ""As a bowling partner for so many years, we kept passing messages to each other. What the situation of the match is, what shots the batters are looking to play, how best to plan as a pair. All these things I will miss very much.""The end of their hunt marks a line in the sand for spin bowling in general, and probably ends, for now, India's long tradition of spinners hunting in pairs. Jadeja, however, said the absence of Ashwin wouldn't have an immediate impact on him.Spinners have taken only seven wickets compared to 86 by the pacers in the three Tests played in this series so far, and Jadeja said his role as a support act to the pacers wasn't about to change either at the MCG.""My mindset won't change with Ashwin's departure. Every match situation is different and that dictates the mindset in a particular game,"" Jadeja said.Will there be more responsibility, now that Ashwin is gone?""In India when we play, the spinners have a greater role to play. Here, it's only a supporting role because the wickets don't offer much help,"" he said.""One has to bowl a good line and length, decide the field accordingly and keep bowling in that manner. In Australia, I don't think there will be talk of greater responsibility on me. From the last Test to this one, I don't think my role will change. But yes, definitely when we play in India, there will be greater responsibility.""After making Jadeja sit out of the first two Tests, India found out in Brisbane just how crucial his presence is in the XI. While he was a bit flat with the ball in unfriendly conditions, Jadeja rescued India with a well-made 77, putting on 67 vital runs with KL Rahul.The knock eventually enabled India to avoid the follow on and save the rain-affected Test.Jadeja, as usual, made light of his omission. ""It just gave me more time to work hard in the nets,"" he said. ""It's satisfying to score runs outside India, especially when the team is in trouble. It has also boosted my confidence. I'll try to maintain the rhythm and momentum in the coming games.""Jadeja was also unequivocal in stating that the team needs a larger contribution from the top and middle order. ""Even if we win one (of the remaining two Tests), we can retain the trophy. When you play outside India, especially in places like Australia and South Africa, it becomes important for the toporder to score runs.""If they cannot contribute in these conditions, definitely there is more pressure on the middle and lower-middle order. As a team we need the top-order to perform. That said, as a batting unit if everyone contributes, the team will do well.""Even if the script doesn't go India's way eventually, Jadeja has already spied the positives. ""The youngsters need to get more experience in these conditions,"" he said.",Ravindra Jadeja says no one is irreplaceable after R Ashwin's retirement.

NEW DELHI: Recently retired Pakistan quick Mohammad Amir says Indian superstar Virat Kohli is the greatest 'player of this generation' and his comparisons with the likes of Babar Azam , Joe Root and Steve Smith make him laugh.Kohli, who retired from the shortest format after India's win in the 2024 T20 World Cup boasts a stunning record across formats -- 8,947 Test runs, 13,906 ODI runs, and 4,188 T20I runs -- and for Amir, former India captain's ability to win matches for the country sets him apart.“Virat Kohli is the greatest player of this generation. I laugh when comparisons are made between him and Babar Azam, Steve Smith, or Joe Root. We cannot compare Virat Kohli to anyone because he has won so many matches for India, which seems impossible for any one player. Not just in one format, but in all three formats, Virat is the greatest batsman of this generation,"" Amir said on the Cricket Predicta Show.The former Pakistan speedster hailed Kohli's work ethic, pointing out the fact how Kohli came out of his bad phase in 2014 and turned himself into a run machine.“Virat Kohli’s work ethic sets him apart from all players. After his bad phase in England in 2014, the way he made a comeback and then consistently performed brilliantly for the next 10 years was no ordinary feat. His wicket in the 2017 Champions Trophy final was very important for us, which helped us win the final. If Virat had not been dismissed, we would have lost the final because we all know how exceptional Virat’s record is while chasing runs,” Amir said.Kohli recently has been going through a run rut.In the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Kohli does have a ton to his name but apart from that, he has looked out of sorts, scoring 5 single-digit scores.The India vs Australia series is currently tied at 1-1 after three matches.The fourth Test begins on December 26 in Melbourne.","Virat Kohli is the greatest batsman of this generation, says Mohammad Amir.

Most blended with this idea of Reeves trying out for an NFL team fit well with his reputation for hard work and intense preparation for his film roles.Keanu Reeves's role in The Replacements, playing Shane Falco in 2000, was among the most defining moments of his illustrious career as an actor. In the film, Reeves was the quarterback for the Washington Sentinels, signed after a strike, as Falco is the quarterback needed by coach Jimmy McGinty, played by Gene Hackman.In an interview on Sports Illustrated, Reeves together with Idris Elba discussed their upcoming movie, Sonic the Hedgehog 3, and rumors of an NFL try-out with the Baltimore Ravens after playing Falco in The Replacements. ""That's absolutely ridiculous,"" Reeves said with a huge smile. ""I got OK, but that is ridiculous. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yeah, I was out there, 'Blue 87!' [throwing] 50-yard outs no problem,"" he added laughing.The Baltimore Ravens, led by Brian Billick at that time, won Super Bowl XXXV less than six months after ""The Replacements"" premiered. While some sources suggest Billick might have expressed interest in Reeves, no official records or statements confirm that the Ravens extended a tryout invitation. Reeves' reputation for intense preparation in film roles and his portrayal of Shane Falco as a comeback-story quarterback make the rumor of him trying out for an NFL team plausible.Also Read: Will Taylor Swift attend the Chiefs-Texans game to cheer for Travis Kelce? Fans wonder if it's her final regular season appearance The Replacements was inspired very loosely by the 1987 NFL strike; in its story, one team-the won-out Washington Redskins-won three replacement games while all of its regular players were lost and then went on to win Super Bowl XXII after that. The story may center on replacement players, but the Falco–Martel quarterback controversy is reminiscent of the post-strike Washington controversy involving Doug Williams and Jay Schroeder.Squeezed in as the third position on the box office chart, the movie made $11,039,214 within its opening weekend in North American box office standings, following Space Cowboys and Hollow Man - which both made their way to this spot for the second consecutive week. By the end, it grossed about $44.7 million in domestic figures and about $5.3 million internationally, at more than $50 million worldwide.Although there is no official record, there are indications that Keanu Reeves was indeed offered the chance to play on the Ravens. However, Shane Falco was praised by Brian Billick, who at that time was the quarterback of the Baltimore Ravens. The team won Super Bowl XXXV six months after the movie had been released.","Rumor has it that Keanu Reeves was once approached to try out for quarterback by the Baltimore Ravens.

NEW DELHI: Polish chess grandmaster and D Gukesh 's coach during the recently-concluded FIDE World Chess Championship , Grzegorz Gajewski has reflected on the rise of the new world chess champion Gukesh.He drew comparisons between his protégé and Magnus Carlsen , who is a five-time world champion and also regarded as the greatest chess player of all time.Gajewski, however, highlighted a clear distinction in their styles, emphasizing that Gukesh’s analytical approach sets him apart from Carlsen’s intuitive gameplay.“He will never be a player like Magnus Carlsen in the sense of being an intuitive kind of a player,” Gajewski told The Hindu. “He (Gukesh) likes to calculate and he likes to go deep into position. He doesn’t like to make moves just purely based on intuition. He will never play in the Magnus style, but he can very well mimic it.”Having worked with legendary five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand , Gajewski went on to explain how Gukesh compares with some of the game’s other greats.He hailed Anand as one of history's greatest talents for calculation but noted that Gukesh’s patience and precision make him a unique force on the chessboard.“Vishy, in terms of talent for calculation, perhaps no one in the history of the game could match him. But at the same time, he was so fast that sometimes it became his weakness. Gukesh somewhat resembles a young Fabiano Caruana,” he remarked.D Gukesh created history by becoming the youngest World Chess Champion , dethroning China’s Ding Liren in a fiercely contested 14-game series in Singapore.In recognition of his remarkable achievements, the Tamil Nadu State Government organized a grand felicitation ceremony for Gukesh last Tuesday.Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin personally awarded the prodigy a cheque for Rs 5 crore, lauding his contributions to Indian chess on the global stage.","Polish chess grandmaster Grzegorz Gajewski has reflected on the rise of the new world chess champion Gukesh.

Rohit Sharma hit on knee during nets session at MCG

MELBOURNE: ""Neeche dekh raha hai... pata chal gaya bouncer daal raha hai (you are looking down, I figured you will bowl a bouncer)"" Rohit Sharma got into the position quickly and comfortably pulled Mohammed Siraj's short-pitched delivery. He was all smiles after that and told his teammate how he figured it would be an attempted bouncer.Siraj had briefly paused, which most bowlers do in the nets, for feedback and was clearly caught unaware when Rohit revealed how he got the cue. The quick returned to the top of his run-up for the next delivery but will keep the words in mind when he decides to bowl a bouncer in remainder of the Border-Gavaskar series.India cricket team's nets sessions are always fun but they were very chatty today and had epic one-liners from the likes of Rohit, Jasprit Bumrah and Rishabh Pant Rohit set the tone when he mocked Washington Sundar's over-enthusiasm after every delivery and lightened up the mood as even the handful of spectators joined in with the laughs.Bumrah would go ""arrey, re...re"" every time he had the openers Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul in a tangle, and even comforted the left-hander when he nicked an away going delivery. ""Theek hai, carry nahi hoga (it's alright, it won't carry to fielder),"" he would say to the youngster who looked short on confidence during the first phase of his batting.In between deliveries, Jaiswal would get pep talks from Virat Kohli , batting in the adjacent net, and Rahul continued with his mentoring and constant feedback when the two openers made way for each other.It was challenging for the two as Akash Deep and Siraj were also bowling at full tilt, and looked in good rhythm, but it was Bumrah who asked the tough questions. There was a lot of fire in his belly and it continued even when Rishabh Pant took guard for his hit.""Na batsman [batter] ko match mai ready hone dete ho, na practice mein (you don't allow batter to get ready in match or practice),"" chuckled the youngster after he was rushed by a delivery which skidded off the good-length spot.Bumrah smiled and resumed breathing fire after another twitch of his shoulder muscles. Even when he was done, he sat and discussed a lot of cricket with his teammates but the spectators would have been a tad disappointed they didn't hear much from Kohli.The star India batter had a brief chat with Jaiswal while they were batting in adjacent nets but not a lot could be heard from that conversation. Except the rare ""yes, one"" and nod of the head, more like a pat on his own back, after he made connection with the ball, there were only murmurs with Shubman Gill in Punjabi but unlike Rohit, Bumrah and Pant's loud and clear one-liners, they weren't audible.Even after the challenges of the surface, the harsh sun and some blows to their batters on both days, India looked a very happy bunch right from their warm-ups to their intense sessions in the nets.They would hope the chatter, banter and good vibes continue when they take field in front of a capacity crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . For the fans and spectators, the stump-mic will ensure not a single one-liner goes unnoticed on what could be very loud days of Test cricket.",Rohit Sharma and Jasprit Bumrah had epic one-liners in nets session.

Jasprit Bumrah breathes fire in the nets at MCG

Rohit Sharma hit on knee during nets session at MCG

MELBOURNE : Keep calm and listen to Jasprit Bumrah . That seems to be the mantra for India’s under-pressure support cast of pace bowlers going into the all-important fourth Test.As the frontline pacers hit the nets at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday, Bumrah’s towering presence in this India squad was in full view. It also served as a sobering reminder of the team’s over-reliance on him in this series. A freakishly rare species of express fast bowler who needs judicious handling, Bumrah has instead been everywhere, done everything on this tour, even with the bat — like staving off the follow-on in the Brisbane Test in the company of pace compatriot Akash Deep .With the new Kookaburra ball, Bumrah has been a phenomenon. Going into the Boxing Day Test , an astonishing 44.68% of the Australian wickets taken by India’s bowlers have fallen to Bumrah. He even captained the team to victory in the opening Test. Now, it seems, there’s another, all-important task remaining — rallying the rest of the pace lineup, which has struggled to match Bumrah’s standards.Harshit Rana has been replaced, Akash Deep has been luckless and Mohammed Siraj has been off-kilter since that showdown with Travis Head. Akash, who replaced Rana after the Adelaide Test and has been impressive without being penetrative, said here on Sunday that the relative inexperience of the pace line-up made Bumrah’s tips invaluable.“Unko aap pura trust kar sakte ho (you can completely trust his suggestions),” Akash said.Bumrah’s advice and attention to detail has been limited to simple, executable tasks which have helped the bowler — be disciplined with your lengths, keep your mind uncluttered, don’t be excitable. Don’t get overawed by the occasion.“This is my first time in Australia, so I didn’t have any experience of playing here,” Akash said. “Jo who chhoti, chhoti cheezay batate hain, who kaafi useful hota hai (he tells us small, small things which are very useful). He told me not to get excited after seeing the help from the pitches. Just select your spot and keep bowling there, the pitch will sooner or later offer some help. Don’t think too much, come in and bowl like you bowl in India.”Still, the wickets have largely eluded India when Bumrah isn’t bowling. The often lone spinner, as Ravindra Jadeja said the other day, has been reduced to holding one end up because of the conditions.Akash repeatedly beat Steve Smith in Brisbane, even earning the batter’s praise, but the breakthrough just wouldn’t come.Siraj, meanwhile, has looked off-kilter since the Australian crowds started their incessant booing. He has seemed a bit upset to be the object of their derision. Bumrah disclosed in Brisbane how he had had a word with Siraj before coming here.“When we arrived in Perth, as well as (in) the last game, he looked in very good spirits. He was bowling well. Here (in the third Test), he played with a niggle. He’s got a great attitude and a fighter’s spirit that the team loves, that I personally love. He always gives it his all. In terms of wickets, some days you will bowl well and they won’t come. That is the conversation I’ve had. Keep focusing on your stuff, things you can control. Keep running in, having a smile on your face,” Bumrah had said.Still, Siraj has struggled to maintain the consistency Akash has.Harshit Rana, meanwhile, has been bowling full tilt in the nets since the Adelaide meltdown against Travis Head, with bowling coach Morne Morkel working closely with him. Morkel will know the old ball, in particular, that phase of the game after the first 30 or so overs, is where Australia have marched ahead with the bat.“It’s not that we’re not bowling well with the old ball,” Deep said. “Luck is a factor. If you see the last game, Travis Head survived a couple of close calls at the start of his innings. He also had a bit of trouble against the short ball. When I was bowling to Smith, he was getting beaten both ways. I thought he should get out at any time, but then I realized wickets are not in my control. I can only bowl in the right areas. Otherwise, you tend to put pressure on yourself.”The end result has been that India have either had to wait for the second new ball, and for Bumrah to return, or given him longer spells first-up.Bumrah, dutifully, has turned on the magic whenever required. Australia haven’t breathed easy with him around. He has dismissed the openers and the middle order (Nos. 3-6) eight times each and the tail five times. He has been relentlessly at the batters. Of his 21 dismissals, 15 have been either caught by the wicketkeeper (9), LBW (4) or bowled (2).It’s the sort of uncanny form which the other bowlers have struggled to replicate.There’s still a way to go for the Boxing Day Test and India have time to firm up their plans. Bumrah will aim for the stratosphere again at the MCG, just like in 2018. In his slipstream, the others, armed with Bumrah’s tips, will be hoping to sneak in a few moments of their own.","Jasprit Bumrah has taken 44.68% of the Australian wickets taken by India’s bowlers. Harshit Rana has been replaced, Akash Deep has been luckless and Mohammed Siraj has been off-kilter since showdown with Travis Head.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116583617,imgsize-39334,width-400,resizemode-4/116583617.jpg"

Head coach feels lucrative prize money & better scheduling could draw top stars

BENGALURU: Over the past five years, the number of Indian star shuttlers featuring in the individual events at the Senior national badminton championship has dwindled sharply. The ongoing competition at the Karnataka Badminton Association (KBA) here is no different. Of the six Indian men ranked inside the top 50 in the BWF rankings, only Satish Kumar Karunakaran, ranked 45, is competing, while Anupama Upadhyaya (ranked 46) and Aakarshi Kashyap (47) are the top-ranked women players in fray.As a result, Badminton Association of India (BAI) secretary general Sanjay Mishra recently said the federation in future could make the premier domestic event mandatory.India head coach Pullela Gopichand remarked, ""It’s always a challenge when you want (top) athletes to play two circuits, international and national, or national and state. Ideally, there should be only one calendar,"" he said here Sunday.""…the importance of the national championship has gone down. How do we revive it?"" he questioned.Scheduling is one of the key reasons for top players not featuring in the nationals. With the competition played at the year’s end, it is internationally offseason and an ideal resting period for the players. It is also the phase during which many of them begin preparations for the next season, which starts in early January.With star players focusing on major international events, which offer bigger prize money and ranking points, how can a player be convinced to play in the nationals?""You must give them benefits. Making it mandatory is one way, but they could just come, walk the first day, lose a match and walk off. That’s not the purpose. So, you want them to come here prepared and perform. So, either the prize money needs to be at a point where it is motivating or certain things such as an honour or a facility should be there,"" said Gopi.He also suggested the duration of the competition be reduced to three days.","Head coach feels lucrative prize money & better scheduling could draw top stars.

NEW DELHI: India will look to take a pivotal lead in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy as they gear up for the fourth Test against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). The focus will firmly be on opener KL Rahul , who has been in stellar form amidst a challenging series for Indian batters.The Boxing Day Test , set to begin on December 26, sees the series evenly poised at 1-1.KL Rahul, promoted to the opening slot after skipper Rohit Sharma opted for a middle-order role following the birth of his second child, has shown remarkable composure and confidence against the moving new ball.KL Rahul is currently India’s leading run-scorer in the series and second overall, amassing 235 runs in six innings at an average of 47.00. His performances include two half-centuries, with a top score of 84.This Test offers KL Rahul a chance to achieve a rare feat: a hat-trick of centuries in Boxing Day Tests.The right-hander previously notched up centuries in Boxing Day games against South Africa, scoring 123 in 2021 at Centurion during a victorious outing, and 101 at the same venue in 2023 in a losing effort.Interestingly, KL Rahul’s only Boxing Day Test appearance in Australia came during his debut in 2014, where he struggled with scores of 3 and 1.In 2024, Rahul has featured in eight Tests, scoring 469 runs at an average of 39.08, including four fifties with a best of 86.In the ongoing ICC World Test Championship cycle (2023-25), he has scored 574 runs in nine matches at an average of 41.00, including one century and four half-centuries.","KL Rahul is India's leading run-scorer in the series and second overall.

""I only believe in Jassi Bhai""

When Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk 'talked' cricket

Jassi Bhai Superman and other viral memes

Indian cricket team saved itself from a humiliating defeat earlier this week after a determined fight back. Indian bowlers Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep prevented what may have been a embarrassing innings defeat, preventing a follow-on to make the Aussies bat once again on Day five of the Brisbane Test. Faced with the daunting challenge of avoiding a follow-on and potential innings defeat, half-centuries from KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja, along with partnership between Bumrah and Akash Deep, helped India end day four at 252/9. The crucial knocks from KL, Jadeja, Bumrah and Akash Deep gave India a fighting chance in the test that later ended in Draw on Day 5.One of the key highlights of the day 4 was the 39-run stand between Bumrah and Akash Deep. Incidentally, Akash Deep was said to be playing with the bat given by Virat Kohli. This led some cricket fans on the internet to 'add' Virat angle to his batting.Also, Indian cricket fans couldn't thank Bumrah enough after he took six for 76 in Australia's first innings and following it up with the important runs. Joining the 'gratitude' Google India too shared an appreciation post for Bumrah, lovingly called Jassi Bhai. ""I only believe in Jassi Bhai 💪,"" reads the post from Google IndiaThe Google post on X, formerly Twitter, quoted post of Twitter user named Deepak Kumaar who had shared an earlier post match conference video of Jasprit Bumrah with the caption: ""name a better comeback than ‘Google it’""As to how the name 'Jassi Bhai' went viral for Bumrah, can't be really said. However, one of the most memorable mention of it is from India's star bowler Mohammad Siraj. After India's T20 World Cup 2024 win in South Africa, a teary eyed Mohammad Siraj said, ""I knew only Jassi bhai could do it for India, and he did it for us"".Bumrah's heroic on Day 4 of BGT also got applauds from two of the Corporate World's biggest leaders -- Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.A known ardent fan of cricket, Pichai shared the Google post on Bumrah with a caption. ""I did Google it:) anyone who can hook Cummins for a six knows how to bat! Well done @Jaspritbumrah93 saving the follow on with Deep!,"" wrote Google CEO.

NEW DELHI: Ace drag-flicker Harmanpreet Singh , who captained the Indian men's hockey team to a bronze medal-finish at the Paris Olympics 2024, has been recommended for the country's highest sporting honour, the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna award.Harmanpreet joins para athlete Praveen Kumar , who won gold in the men's high jump T64 class with an Asian record at the Paris Paralympics for the nomination, recommended by a 12-member selection committee, headed by retired Supreme Court judge, Justice V Ramasubramanian.Strangely, ace pistol shooter, the Paris Olympics double medallist, Manu Bhaker 's name is missing from the recommendation for India's highest sporting award. While officials in the sports ministry claimed that the shooter didn't apply for the award, sources close to Manu's family said that she had indeed sent in her application.Even if she hadn't applied for the award, the selection committee doesn't seem to have taken suo moto cognizance of her stupendous achievements as a shooter over the years.Last year, cricketer Mohammed Shami too hadn't applied for the Arjuna but was eventually given the award on the Indian cricket board's (BCCI) insistence, after which the National Sports Day awards committee took suo moto cognizance.Manu was honoured with the Arjuna in 2020. At the Paris Games this year, she created history after securing two back-to-back medals (bronze) -- the women's 10m air pistol and in the mixed team event with Sarabjot.However, soon after Paris, Manu faced flak on social media for allegedly asking for the Khel Ratna from the government. She had posted on X: ‘Tell me, Do I deserve the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna award . Thanks'.Hockey captain Harmanpreet was rewarded for his show as one of the world's best penalty corner specialists in addition to his fine defending skills and overall leadership guided India to a creditable bronze finish in Paris and an Asian Games gold in Hangzhou last year.He was also part of the team's successful campaign in Birmingham CWG 2022 (silver), Tokyo Olympics 2020 (bronze) and Jakarta Asiad 2018 (bronze). The 28-year-old from Amritsar has won the ‘FIH Player of the Year' award thrice in his career, a record by itself.Similarly, Praveen's rise as the country's leading para high jumper cannot be ignored. In Paris, he cleared 2.08m in the final to clinch gold and his second successive Paralympics medal. The 21-year-old from Jewar in Greater Noida, had won silver in Tokyo 2020 with a clearance of 2.07m, an Asian record.The awards committee also recommended the names of a total 30 sportspersons for the Arjuna. These include 13 from able-bodied sports and 17 para-athletes. Men's 57kg freestyle wrestler Aman Sehrawat is one of the prominent names to be nominated for his bronze winning-campaign at Paris and Hangzhou Asiad.Shooters Swapnil Kusale, who won bronze in Paris in the men's 50m rifle three positions event, and Sarabjot, who secured bronze in the 10m air pistol mixed team event partnering Manu in Paris, have been recommended for the Arjuna. Sarabjot also won gold in the 10m air pistol team event in Hangzhou.The members of the men's hockey team, who weren't awarded with Arjuna on any of the previous occasions, too, have been recommended for the sporting honour. These include Jarmanpreet Singh, Sanjay Rana, Rajkumar Pal, Abhishek Nain and Sukhjeet Singh.India's first Paralympic gold medallist, para swimmer Muralikant Petkar, has been recommended for Arjuna in the lifetime achievement category. He won individual gold in the 1972 Heidelberg Paralympics in West Germany.The 17 para-sport recommendations, who won medals in Paris and have been nominated for Arjuna, include Navdeep Singh (para athletics), Dharambir (para athletics), Ajeet Singh (para athletics), Sachin Khilari (para athletics), Pranav Soorma (para athletics), Preeti Pal (para athletics), Simran (para athletics), Hokato Hotozhe Sema (para athletics), Deepthi Jeevanji (para athletics), Nitesh Kumar (para badminton), Manisha Ramdas (para badminton), Thulasimathi Murugesan (para badminton), Nithya Sivan (para badminton), Mona Aggarwal (para shooting), Rubina Francis (para shooting), Kapil Parmar (para judo) and Rakesh Kumar (para archery).Para shooting coach Subhash Rana has been recommended for the Dronacharya. Under his mentorship, India's para shooters landed four medals from the Paris Paralympics, including one gold and one silver and two bronze. Avani Lekhara secured gold in the women's 10m air rifle event, Manish Narwal won silver in the men's 10m air pistol and Rubina Francis and Mona Agarwal won bronze each in the women's 10m air rifle discipline.However, a few eyebrows have been raised on the nomination of four-time Paralympian and Arjuna awardee, wheelchair-bound para athlete Amit Kumar Saroha, for the Dronacharya award . According to sources, Saroha is an active para athlete who just participated in Paris and has been a Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) beneficiary for the last eight years.""He is an active athlete and TOPS beneficiary who has never worked as a coach with the para athletics team. Even the athletes whose affidavits have been submitted by Saroha don't even train together in the same ground,"" alleged a source.","Harmanpreet Singh, Praveen Kumar, Aman Sehrawat, Swapnil Kusale, Sarabjot, among 30 nominated for Arjuna award.

MELBOURNE: Before walking into the nets on the first day of Team India 's practice session at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), Virat Kohli patiently applied tape on the bottom of his bat. The star batter ensured to have protection on his willow and few deliveries of his session were enough to understand why he did that.Unlike the surfaces which we generally see during Tests Down Under, the practice pitches at the MCG had lower bounce and absolutely nothing in it for the quicks. Except the deliveries where the bowlers used the shoulder, not many rose above waist height and were comfortably dealt with off the front-foot.It was clearly evident on the opening day and the trend continued on Sunday too. India's quicks Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep were operating with the new ball for most of the session but there was very little help for the trio. Bumrah did slip in a few gems but they were mostly because of his use of angles and the subtle wrist work.It was hard work for the bowlers under the harsh sun, which kept playing hide-and-seek with the clouds, and the nature of the surface was definitely not to the Indian camp's liking.Akash Deep did speak about it during his interaction with the media and felt it was on the flatter side, had variable bounce and was more suited for white-ball cricket. The variable bounce was on display as whenever side-armers put in the extra effort, some deliveries rose awkwardly from the good length spot and some kept a tad low.So it wasn't a surprise when the likes of KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Akash Deep took some blows to the body, and captain Rohit Sharma was in a lot of pain after one delivery hit the flap of his left pad and made a serious impact on his left knee.Rohit had the ice pack on for close to 30 minutes but looked comfortable as he made his way back to the change room. Even when he was batting, he kept checking the toe of his bat after not hearing the ideal sound from the connection. The captain batted but finally decided to change the willow towards the fag end of his lengthy hit in the nets.Australia are yet to get their training underway and will have their first session, an optional one, in the afternoon on Monday. The hosts, however, are highly unlikely to train on the same set of pitches as those were heavily watered after India's session got over this afternoon.There are more pitches in the training square which were covered throughout India's sessions and when the covers did come off briefly today, they looked spicier than the ones which were given to the visitors.The reveal of the other pitches will happen tomorrow (Monday) when Australia arrive at the MCG and it remains to be seen how the Indian camp reacts if they turn out to be as spicy as they looked.","Rohit Sharma hit on knee during nets session at MCG on Sunday.

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

Why R Ashwin retirement was a last minute surprise for Ravindra Jadeja

Stadium Walkthrough series: Inside The Gabba

NEW DELHI: Ravichandran Ashwin announced his retirement from international cricket earlier this week, bringing an end to his illustrious career following the Gabba Test against Australia. The 38-year-old spinner retires as India’s second-highest wicket-taker across all formats, trailing only the legendary Anil Kumble.Ashwin’s impact on Test cricket has been monumental. He claimed 11 Player of the Series awards, the most by any cricketer in men’s Test history, cementing his status as one of India’s greatest match-winners.Over the years, comparisons between Ashwin and fellow Indian spin legend Harbhajan Singh were frequent. Speculation about a rift between the two spinners has often surfaced, suggesting strained relations.However, Harbhajan recently dispelled such rumors following Ashwin’s retirement, asserting that there is no truth to the claims of discord between them.""I read social media only as much as I need to. If there is a standoff between me and Ashwin or if there was ever any fight, quarrel or disagreement, I would be the first person to go up to him and ask what the issue is,"" Harbhajan Singh said on his YouTube channel.""But it was never like this, and it will never be like this because whatever is in his destiny, he will get it, and I got whatever was in my destiny. He has been a phenomenal bowler for India. I am very happy for his achievement,"" he added.""If people twist things on Twitter and make it seem as if I have a problem with Ashwin, then it's their point of view. I am a little vocal about the fact that the pitches on which India play cricket are not good tracks, there is a lot of spin on these tracks and matches get over within two and a half days,"" said Harbhajan.""Because I am vocal about it, there is a lot of noise on social media, and people think I have a problem with one individual. I don't have a problem with any individual, I respect everyone because it is not easy to play for the country. They are all my colleagues. They are all my brothers, some elder, some younger,"" said Harbhajan.Ashwin picked 765 wickets in international cricket in 379 innings, while Harbhajan scalped 707 wickets in his illustrous career.","Ravichandran Ashwin retires as India's second-highest wicket-taker across all formats.

Rohit Sharma hit on knee during nets session at MCG

Akash Deep on his battle with Steve Smith, plans for Travis Head

MELBOURNE: Rohit Sharma had an injury scare in the India nets on Sunday, copping a painful hit on his left knee while facing throwdowns at the MCG nets. The captain was into his trademark pull shot when he missed, the ball sneaking through the flap of the pad and hitting him painfully on the knee.He kept batting for a while but then needed attention from the physio and chose to leave the nets, rest his leg on a chair and apply an ice pack for a good half hour.He subsequently got up and was seen walking around and mingling with teammates, pointing to his knee and smiling.Minutes later, pacer Akash Deep , who was himself hit on the hand while batting, brushed aside any major concerns for the team. “No concern, itni chotey to lagti rahti hai (it’s common to sometimes get hurt). The practice area was prepared for white-ball purposes, it seems. The ball was keeping a bit low.”Minor controversies have dogged India since arriving in Melbourne, with Virat Kohli first having a run-in with an Australian reporter and a cameraman at the airport over filming his children and then Ravindra Jadeja being criticized for not answering questions in English. Rohit is under pressure to come good in his new middleorder slot while Akash Deep, after his satisfying performance in Brisbane, is expected to play a crucial role in the Boxing Day Test.Wasn’t looking to avoid follow on, says Deep Akash Deep also clarified he and Jasprit Bumrah , the last-wicket pair which heroically avoided the follow-on in the previous Test in Brisbane, were simply looking to play out balls and survive.“Whenever we bat, scoring those 20-30 runs is vital. I didn’t think about saving the follow-on, I was just looking at not getting out. I’m happy that I was able to give the team some confidence from that situation. We’ll carry that momentum into the MCG Test,” he said.",Rohit Sharma hit on knee during nets session at MCG. Akash Deep brushed aside any major concerns for the team.

Stadium Walkthrough series: Inside The Gabba

VADODARA: Fired by some brilliant swing bowling under the lights by seamer Renuka Thakur (five for 25 in ten overs) and another fabulous knock by their vice-captain Smriti Mandhana (91 runs off 102 balls), India secured a massive 211-run win in the opening Women’s ODI against a highly disappointing West Indies on Sunday at the brand new Kotambi Stadium-staging its first-ever international match.India, who had earlier clinched the WT20I series against the Caribbeans 2-1, will now look to clinch the WODI series too in the second WODI of the three-match series at the same venue on Tuesday.Carrying her sizzling form in her kit bag from Perth to Navi Mumbai to international cricket’s newest venue-the Kotambi Stadium here, Mandhana led the charge while several other batters made useful contributions as the hosts, despite losing a cluster of wickets in the final overs, put up 314 for nine against West Indies in the first Women’s ODI on Sunday.Making the new ball talk at night, Renuka destroyed the West Indies top-order, prising out the wickets of captain Hayley Matthews (0), veteran allrounder Deandra Dottin (8), Aaliyah Allene (13) and Shabika Gajnabi (3). Badgered by Renuka’s early strikes, the visitors were left tottering at 34 for six in 13 overs.While the dangerous Matthews swished at a wide one and feathered it, Dottin was castled while trying a wild slog across the line. Alleyne fell to a stunner by Indian women’s team skipper Harmanpreet Kaur, who, returning to action after missing the last two T20Is due to a knee injury, leapt in the air and caught the ball out of nowhere at mid-on. Renuka had her fourth scalp when, given an extended opening spell, she castled Gajnabi with a trademark inswinger.Supporting Renuka well, Sadhu (1/24 in seven overs) cleaned up the stumps of Rashada Williams (3) with a beauty of an inswinger that rushed through the gap between the ball and the bat.The Caribbeans were off the worst-possible start when opener Qiana Joseph was run out off the first ball of the innings as she failed to sprint home in time after Matthews dabbed the ball for a single to covers, where an alert Jemima Rodrigues quickly threw the ball to ‘keeper Richa Ghosh.At the moment, Smriti Mandhana is to the Indian women’s team what the legendary Sachin Tendulkar was to the Indian men’s team in the 90s, and Virat Kohli was from 2012 to 2019-the Atlas who carries the entire bunch on his/her shoulders. The talisman of the team.Looking to round off a dream 2024, in which the classy opener has stroked four WODI centuries and three consecutive fifties in the three-match WT20 series at the DY Patil Stadium against West Indies, Mandhana narrowly missed out on scoring back-to-back hundreds in the 50-over format, but once again led her team’s batting charge to an impressive total.Suffering badly yet again on this tour due to another shoddy effort in the fielding, the visitors were only provided some cheer by 20-year-old left-arm spinner Zaida James, who took five for 45 in eight overs-her maiden fiver in WODIs, and West Indies’ best bowling figures against India in this format.After they lost the toss and were asked to take first strike, India were provided a perfect start by the classy left-hander and debutant Pratika Rawal (40 runs off 69 balls), who managed to impress in her first international outing, as the duo added 110 in 140 balls for the opening wicket. It was a subdued start initially as the pair played out 53 dots in the first 13 overs, with Rawal -lucky to survive a caught behind decision down the legside that West Indies missed out on reviewing and then a dropped chance at mid-off- particularly struggling to get the ball off the square.However, India increased the pace of the innings later, as Harleen Deol (44 runs off 50 balls) and a fit-again skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (34 runs off 23 balls), who missed the last two T20Is due to a knee injury, added 66 in just 52 balls for the third wicket.Thereafter, Jemimah Rodrigues (31 runs off 19 balls) and aggressive ‘keeper-bat Richa Ghosh (26 runs off 13 balls) kept up the momentum.India lost seven wickets in the last 10 overs, but plundered 89 runs as Harleen, Harman, Rodrigues and Ghosh all unleashed a few lusty blows.",India beat West Indies by 211 runs in the first Women's ODI at the Kotambi Stadium in Navi Mumbai.

Australian fast bowler Jhye Richardson is enthusiastic about his return to the Test team. He will be playing in the final two matches of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against India.Richardson's inclusion in the squad comes after Josh Hazlewood 's calf injury ruled him out of the series. Australia needed an additional pace option.While Richardson admitted to being surprised by his selection for the Boxing Day Test , he expressed excitement about his international comeback.“Even a week ago, I was like, 'I'm not really thinking about that just yet',” Richardson said on Fox Cricket during the Scorchers' clash with the Hurricanes on Saturday.To prepare for his potential Test return, Richardson will miss the Perth Scorchers ' match against the Melbourne Renegades. He played for the Scorchers on Saturday in Hobart.He and young opener Sam Konstas are the new additions to Australia’s 15-player squad for the rest of the series.“I just wanted to stay on the park and play Big Bash cricket and make sure that the body was OK and keep ramping up (the workloads) and following the processes that we've got in place. But here we are, and if there's an opportunity, then it's obviously really exciting.”In the Scorchers' recent loss to the Hobart Hurricanes, Richardson didn't take any wickets. This contrasted with his Player of the Match performance in the BBL season opener, where he took 3-19 against the Melbourne Stars.Richardson's surprise at his selection was due to his gradual return to long-form cricket this season. Despite limited opportunities, he has consistently shown his talent as one of Australia's best bowlers when fit.Just a week prior, Richardson had stated that an international return was ""unrealistic."" His focus was on regaining consistent match fitness.He has played only one four-day game this season. However, he made an immediate impact by taking two wickets in his first over during Western Australia's pink-ball Shield match against South Australia last month.Richardson’s confidence grew after successfully returning to bowling after dislocating his shoulder while celebrating one of those wickets.While he has played two T20 matches for the Scorchers since his first-class appearance, Richardson believes the transition to Test cricket won't be difficult. His summer training has been geared towards the longer format.“I'd probably argue that I've had less white-ball practice leading into this Big Bash. Having played a couple of second XI games and a Shield game, we've really been prioritising trying to build (my bowling) loads to get my body right for four-day cricket,” Richardson said.“So I'll probably find it easier to go back to red-ball cricket just from a preparation point of view.”Richardson's return has been carefully managed due to a history of injuries. These include a side strain during last season's Big Bash and hamstring surgery nine months earlier.This summer, he has played four One-Day Cup matches for Western Australia, two second XI games, and one Shield match. He sat out their most recent Shield game, which WA lost to NSW.",Australian fast bowler Jhye Richardson is enthusiastic about his return to the Test team.

Former Indian cricketer Parthiv Patel recently commented on the Indian batting unit's collapses in recent matches, particularly during the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy series against Australia, where India has struggled to post substantial scores.""There is no doubt that collapses have occurred, especially in home series. We have seen collapses on rank turner pitches against New Zealand. When we toured Australia, the collapses continued there,"" Patel remarked to Cricbuzz.Patel observed similar collapses during India's home series, particularly on challenging turning pitches against New Zealand. He noted that these collapses also persisted during India's tour of Australia.""I do not believe this has happened due to extreme aggression. If we respect the traditional style of Test cricket and bat with discipline, these are the same batters who have previously performed well. Indian batters need to apply themselves more because they have the ability. If they bat with discipline, they can succeed anywhere,"" he added.Patel attributed the issue not to excessive aggression but rather to a lack of discipline. He believes that the same batsmen, who have demonstrated strong performances in the past, need to adhere to traditional Test match batting principles. He emphasised the importance of application and discipline for success, regardless of the playing conditions.Ahead of the Boxing Day Test against Australia, several Indian players engaged in rigorous practice sessions. Batsmen Yashasvi Jaiswal , Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma , and Rishabh Pant spent considerable time in the nets.

Fans protest with banners

KOCHI: The usual fanfare surrounding a home fixture of the Kerala Blasters at the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium was missing as they took on Mohammedan SC here on Sunday night. There was an unprecedented silence at the stadium when the Blasters players took the field for the match, as the home fans held the Blasters’ management responsible for their poor run in ISL this season.However, by the end of 90 minutes, Blasters not only rediscovered their winning touch by blanking MSC 3-0 but also managed to turn that silence into cheer from a small turnout of 15,000 who came in for a holiday fixture.With this win, Blasters are now in tenth spot in the points table with 14 points from 13 matches, while MSC remain at the bottom of the heap with five points from 12 matches.Though the first half of the game was more about missed passes from both teams, the dynamics changed after MSC goalkeeper Bhaskar Roy’s goalkeeping blunder helped Blasters open their account in the 62nd minute,.

Goalkeeper Bhaskar Roy tried to punch the ball away but his mistiming saw the ball falling into his own net, giving the hosts a 1-0 lead.After conceding the lead, MSC were forced to attack, but they were guilty of opening up space in their defence, which Blasters striker Noah Sadaoui exploited.

Bournemouth secured a resounding 3-0 victory against Manchester United at Old Trafford on a chilly Sunday, boosting their Premier League standing to fifth place. Goals from Dean Huijsen, Justin Kluivert, and Antoine Semenyo propelled the Cherries to victory.This win marks Bournemouth's fourth league victory in five matches, elevating their points tally to 28 after 17 games. Meanwhile, Manchester United sits in 13th place with 22 points, marking the first time in Premier League history they will spend Christmas in the bottom half of the table.In the 29th minute, Huijsen opened the scoring for Bournemouth, outjumping Joshua Zirkzee to head in Ryan Christie's free-kick. This highlighted Manchester United's ongoing struggles with set pieces, having conceded similar goals from corners against Arsenal and Nottingham Forest earlier this month.Despite Manchester United's barrage of shots towards the end of the first half, including three attempts by captain Bruno Fernandes, Bournemouth extended their lead with two quick goals early in the second half.In the 61st minute, Kluivert successfully converted a penalty, awarded after Noussair Mazraoui 's foul on the Dutch winger. Kluivert sent goalkeeper Andre Onana the wrong way, solidifying Bournemouth's advantage.Mere moments later, while Bournemouth fans were still celebrating, Dango Ouattara delivered a precise pass to Semenyo inside the box. Semenyo's powerful shot past Onana, met with minimal resistance from United defender Lisandro Martinez, sealed the 3-0 victory for Bournemouth.“It's an important win for us,” Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola remarked.“We won 3-0 but it was more difficult than it looks when you see 3-0. I think we've been quite solid, it was a mature performance.”Bournemouth supporters, echoing their team's identical victory at Old Trafford last season, chanted ""Man United, it's happened again"" during the final minutes of the match.Manchester United appeared disjointed throughout the game, which followed their uplifting 2-1 derby win against Manchester City the previous week. Their performance lacked cohesion both offensively and defensively.“It's hard to push for two, three wins and we are trying,” United boss Ruben Amorim stated.“This game was hard on us. We suffered again on set-pieces and we were a bit nervous, I felt it in the stadium. The penalty and another goal are really hard here. We tried to score some goals but it was a tough match so let's move on.”“We have to focus on the job and not what you feel in the stadium. It's the only way I know how to focus my players. We have to suffer again but we will try to win. We will do it until the end.”Manchester United outshot Bournemouth 23 to 10, including a flurry of attempts just before halftime. Among these attempts, Fernandes unleashed a powerful shot from the edge of the box that narrowly missed the target. Moments later, Kobbie Mainoo skillfully bypassed three defenders before his shot also went wide.In the second half, Alejandro Garnacho missed a golden opportunity, outpacing two defenders but ultimately shooting directly at goalkeeper Kepa.Manager Ruben Amorim excluded forward Marcus Rashford from the squad for the third consecutive match, fueling speculation about the player's future at the club. Rashford, present at the stadium but not on the bench, seems to have fallen out of favor with the manager. In a recent interview, the 27-year-old expressed his readiness for a ""new challenge"" away from Manchester United.","Bournemouth secured a resounding 3-0 victory against Manchester United at Old Trafford.
