It's always a possibility that you may look past some key moments in a game when your team is on the winning side in the end, but not when you are a seasoned pro like Dinesh Karthik, who made an interesting analysis, which is hard to deny as a factor that contributed in Royal Challengers Bengaluru 's (RCB) win over Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the IPL on Saturday night.The game was played under overcast skies and even got interrupted by rain during RCB innings, after the hosts were put in to bat by CSK, who won the toss at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru.Bowling with a ball that repeatedly got wet after rolling on the grass wasn't easy. It was the same for RCB bowlers as they went in to defend a formidable 218/5. While CSK would have loved to win and move into the playoffs, they also had an eye on the 201-run mark, which would have helped them finish in the playoffs bracket even in the face of a defeat.Yash Dayal was asked by RCB captain Faf du Plessis to deliver the final over. With it difficult to grip the wet ball, Dayal faltered off the first delivery, which turned into a juicy full-toss to MS Dhoni on leg-side. The CSK legend helped himself by dispatching it for a 100-metre six that landed outside the stadium.That required a replacement ball to be called for. It was much drier and comparatively easier to grip for the bowler.The six, thus, turned into a blessing in disguise for Dayal, who not only dismissed Dhoni (25 off 13 balls) on the next delivery but also conceded just one run off his last four deliveries to spark off victory celebrations in the RCB camp.Analysing the game in the dressing room after the win, RCB's veteran wicketkeeper-batsman Karthik described that crucial moment in the dying stages of the match.""The best thing to happen today was Dhoni hitting that six outside the ground (because) we got a new ball, which was much better (drier) to bowl with,"" said Karthik, as everyone in the dressing room approved of his analysis.""Yash, that was good bowling. You have a doubt, always bowl a hip-high full-toss on leg-stump...that's a good mantra to follow when the ball is wet,"" he added on a lighter note.He then commended the effort of his teammates, especially for registering six consecutive wins to qualify for the playoffs, when it all looked gloomy having lost seven of their first eight matches of the season.""Other than that, jokes apart, we should be really proud of this journey that we are having. People always remember certain journeys. The way we have come back after 8 games (losing seven of those), we needed to win six (in a row). The way we have come back, I think people will remember this team for a very very special (long) time,"" said Karthik.On a cheeky note, the 38-year-old stumper added: ""Don't be like Andy Flower (head coach) with a glum face. Smile, enjoy, drink, party, have fun.""We have within our grasp to do something where people will remember us for many many decades. They’ll say 'wow, that RCB team was special'.""","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) beat Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the IPL on Saturday night.

NEW DELHI: Riding high on confidence after securing their first playoffs spot in three years, Sunrisers Hyderabad is eyeing a second-place finish in the IPL 2024 points table . They will face Punjab Kings in their final league game with hopes of securing a win to bolster their position.Having finished at the bottom in the last three IPL editions, Sunrisers Hyderabad has shown remarkable improvement this year.Their aggressive batting and skillful bowling have made them strong contenders for the title.Led by Pat Cummins , Sunrisers Hyderabad secured a spot in the final-four after their match against Gujarat Titans was washed out. With 15 points from 13 matches, they can reach a maximum of 17 points if they defeat PBKS.However, if Rajasthan Royals manage to beat table-toppers Kolkata Knight Riders, they will surpass SRH with 18 points, pushing Hyderabad to the third spot.In their last six outings, Sunrisers have had a mixed run, winning two matches, losing three, and one ending in a washout.For Punjab Kings, this match is an opportunity to end their season on a high note after failing to make it to the final four. They have lost key players like Sam Curran, who played a crucial role in their previous win against Rajasthan Royals, due to England player commitments.In their head-to-head encounters, Sunrisers Hyderabad has dominated Punjab Kings, winning 15 out of their 22 matches, while PBKS has managed to win only seven.The pitch at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium has favoured batsmen in IPL 2024, initially appearing flat and lifeless. However, in recent games, bowlers have found some assistance as the pitch has slowed down.In six matches played at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium during IPL 2024, teams batting first have won three times, while teams chasing have won twice. The average first innings total is 203, while the average second innings total is 190. The highest total recorded is 277/3 by Sunrisers Hyderabad against Mumbai Indians, while the lowest total is 165-5 by Chennai Super Kings against Sunrisers Hyderabad.Considering the current state of the pitch, it will offer something for everyone. It will be best for batting early on, making top-order batsmen from both teams good picks. As for bowlers, those who can vary their pace and use cutters effectively will have an advantage.The Australian opener has been instrumental in SRH's success in IPL 2024. With his current form and familiarity with the venue, Head is a reliable choice as he is third in IPL 2024 orange cap . Stats: 533 runs in 11 matchesThe South African middle-order batsman has played crucial innings for SRH in the middle overs. With consistent performances in IPL 2024, Klaasen is a safe bet for fantasy teams. Stats: 339 runs in 11 inningsThe Indian middle-order batsman has been a standout performer for PBKS in IPL 2024, providing solidity and dynamism. Given his form, Shashank Singh is a strong fantasy pick. Stats: 352 runs in 13 matchesSunrisers Hyderabad: Abhishek Sharma, Travis Head, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Aiden Markram, Abdul Samad, Nitish Reddy, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins (c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat, T Natarajan, Mayank Markande, Umran Malik, Anmolpreet Singh, Glenn Phillips (wk), Rahul Tripathi, Washington Sundar, Upendra Yadav (wk), Jhathavedh Subramanyan, Sanvir Singh, Vijayakanth Viyaskanth, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Marco Jansen, Akash Maharaj Singh, Mayank Agarwal.Punjab Kings: Matthew Short, Prabhsimran Singh (wk), Jitesh Sharma (c & wk), Sikandar Raza, Rishi Dhawan, Atharva Taide, Arshdeep Singh, Nathan Ellis, Harpreet Brar, Rahul Chahar, Harpreet Bhatia, Vidwath Kaverappa, Shivam Singh, Harshal Patel, Ashutosh Sharma, Vishwanath Pratap Singh, Shashank Singh, Tanay Thyagarajan, Prince Choudhary, Rilee Rossouw.Heinrich KlaasenRilee Rossouw, Travis Head, Ashutosh SharmaShashank Singh, Nitish ReddyJaydev Unadkat, Pat Cummins, Harshal Patel, T Natarajan, Nathan Ellis (Here's a list of updated Purple cap list)","Sunrisers Hyderabad will face Punjab Kings in their final IPL 2024 game.

MS Dhoni swansong pushed back in playlist?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ms-dhoni-swansong-pushed-back-in-playlist/articleshow/110259500.cms,"Legend has told

he will need some time before taking final call

'Impact sub' rule may play a role

CHENNAI: It hardly happens that a 110-metre six that goes out of the ground becomes counterproductive for the batting side. But that's exactly what happened for MS Dhoni and Chennai Super Kings at Bengaluru's Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday when the legend hit left-arm pacer Yash Dayal for a massive six in the first ball of the last over.""The ball was lost and had to be replaced. Dayal got a drier ball and suddenly hitting became difficult,"" a senior CSK official told TOI. What it meant was that Dhoni couldn't connect the all-important second six of the over and fulfill his promise to his fans of playing his last IPL match at Chepauk.The 42-year-old was devastated after the loss and was one of the first to leave the city for Ranchi on Sunday morning. But there lingers a belief in the CSK camp that Saturday's loss against Royal Challengers Bengaluru might not have been Dhoni's last.""Dhoni has not told anybody in CSK that he is quitting. He has told the management that he will wait for a couple of months before taking a final call,"" a source close to the developments said.What is giving CSK management hope is that Dhoni will keep his promise of playing his last game at Chepauk, is his batting and wicketkeeping form. Even on Saturday, he scored 25 at a strike-rate of close to 200 which was better than the likes ofRavindra Jadeja or Shivam Dube -- the designated hitters of the team.Dhoni also batted for four overs and was comfortable in his running between the wickets -- the torn calf that he was playing with gradually healing along the course of the tournament. ""He did not feel any discomfort in his running between the wickets and that is a plus,"" the source said.There is a big auction coming up next year and teams may be allowed to retain a maximum of five players. There are four CSK players -- Ruturaj Gaikwad , Jadeja, Dube and Matheesha Pathirana -- who are sure-fire retentions. In that case, Dhoni may well opt for the lowest retention slot without blocking too much money for new players to be bought from the auction table.In addition, Dhoni may wait to see if the ‘impact sub' rule is abolished by the BCCI for the next IPL. This rule allows Dhoni the flexibility of playing the extra batter while keeping himself for the last two overs, when he doesn't have to do too much running. If BCCI does away with the rule, it may not be too viable for a team to have a batter exclusively for only 12 balls. His franchise appears to have left the decision to him. ""We will wait for Dhoni's communication. He always has the best interests of the team in mind, let's see what happens,"" the CSK official said.",MS Dhoni has not told anybody in CSK that he is quitting. He has told the management that he will wait for a couple of months before taking a final call. Dhoni may wait to see if the 'impact sub' rule is abolished by the BCCI for the next IPL.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110259564,imgsize-50208,width-400,resizemode-4/110259564.jpg"

It won't be wrong to call Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) the phoenix of IPL 2024 , for the way they have literally risen from the ashes to script one of the most remarkable comebacks the league has ever seen. But there's still unfinished business, which is why RCB icon Virat Kohli says ""we gotta focus on the next one.""RCB qualified for the playoffs, finishing fourth on the points table after defeating five-time winners Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in their do-or-die match at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru last Saturday.That was their sixth consecutive win on the trot, after losing seven of their first eight matches in this edition, which is what makes their run special and iconic. No other team has ever done that after a similar horror start to the season.Kohli, with 708 runs to be the league's top run-getter, has been one of the inspirational figures behind this comeback; but the batting legend doesn't want to delve much into it as the team has the all-important Eliminator against Rajasthan Royals coming up. The losing team in that match exits the tournament, while the winners go on to play Qualifier 2 for a place in the final.Qualifier 1 will be played between Kolkata Knight Riders and Sunrisers Hyderabad, with the winner moving into the final and the losing team taking on the winners of the Eliminator.""God's got a plan,"" Kohli could be heard saying on a video clip on social media, as he walks towards the dressing room.""So you just need to be honest with what you are doing. I think we were pretty honest with our hard work and we got the rewards. I don't want to say anything more than this. We gotta focus on the next one,"" the former RCB captain added.Kohli has been with RCB since the inception of the league, which makes it his 17th season with the franchise. However, they are yet to win the title and will hope that this inspirational comeback continues for three more matches to end their wait.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) are the phoenix of IPL 2024.

CATCHES WIN MATCHES

BENGALURU: Years ago, Royal Challengers Bengaluru fans, ever hopeful of their team winning the Indian Premier League title despite seemingly forever being on the brink, came up with the catchline, 'Ee sala Cup namde!' (The cup is ours this time). The wait for the trophy, though, has stretched 17 seasons and the catchline has been a subject of much mockery and jeers.This season, RCB changed Bangalore in their name to Bengaluru and the catchline changed to 'Hosa adhyaya' (A new beginning).But with one win in eight matches at one stage, it seemed pretty much like the RCB of old. Then that famous turnaround happened with Faf du Plessis and his men notching up win after win to make the playoffs.Handed a clear role and a consistent slot, Rajat Patidar has come into his own. With five half-centuries and a strike rate touching 180, Patidar has filled the vacuum for an Indian batter other than Kohli. He has accelerated consistently, and the standout feature has been his six-hitting abilities.Virat Kohli has struck a purple patch and has donned the Orange Cap for the better part of the season. Yet, when the team's chips were down, his strike rate and not his performance was the talking point. Kohli has amassed 708 runs this season with a century and five half-centuries at a strike rate of 155.60.A stumbling Faf du Plessis, Glenn Maxwell with a cold bat, and the indifferent form of Recee Topley, Will Jacks and Cameron Green were a major worry for RCB. But in the second half of the season, Jacks raised the tempo with the bat and Green filled the role of an all-rounder with aplomb.Du Plessis is among a few in the RCB dugout who knows what it feels like to lift the IPL trophy. He has done that twice with Chennai Super Kings . The 38-year-old can hand a lesson or two in soaking up the pressure and delivering when it matters. After Kohli's exit on Saturday night, on a wicket made tricky by the dampness, the South African brought all his experience to the fore and his 54 proved to be a clincher.Bowling has often proved to be RCB's Achilles' heel. It was the case in the first half of the season. But in the latter half, discipline and precision have been the key. The foreign pacers like Green and Lockie Ferguson have complemented the efforts of Mohd Siraj and Yash Dayal , while a returning Maxwell and Swapnil Singh have fortified the undercooked spin attack.Fielding at mid-off, Du Plessis plucked a one-hand stunner to dismiss CSK's Mitchell Santner off Siraj's bowling on Saturday night. This was one of the instances of RCB's sharp fielding in a season where dropped catches have been the norm. The likes of Du Plessis, Maxwell and Kohli have made up for the shortcomings of a few others.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru won the Indian Premier League on Saturday night.

When Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) defeated Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in their do-or-die match in Bengaluru last Saturday, they scripted a comeback that is nothing less than iconic and will be remembered for the years to come.After losing seven of their first eight matches, the Bengaluru team, led by Faf du Plessis and inspired by Orange Cap holder Virat Kohli (708 runs), won their next six matches on the trot to push CSK out of the race and finish in the top four on the leaderboard.That made RCB the first IPL team ever to qualify for the playoffs after losing seven of their first eight matches in the season.Former India allrounder Irfan Pathan, who has the experience of playing in the IPL, described what this remarkable turnaround means to the league and RCB.""This season has been iconic (for RCB).

Winning just one out of seven home matches hurt us: PBKS coach Sanjay Bangar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/winning-just-one-out-of-seven-home-matches-hurt-us-pbks-coach-sanjay-bangar/articleshow/110254008.cms,"(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings head coach Sanjay Bangar lamented on Sunday that their poor performance at home, winning just one out of seven matches, contributed to their subpar Indian Premier League season, where they finished ninth out of ten teams in the highly competitive T20 tournament.In their final league match, Punjab Kings were defeated by Sunrisers Hyderabad by four wickets, ending their campaign with 10 points from 14 matches.""We could not adapt to the home conditions. We won four out of the seven away matches but out of the seven home matches we just managed to win one. So, if a team has to progress in a tournament, certainly that is a worrying aspect,"" Bangar said at the post-match press conference.""The four games we lost back-to-back through mid season, all of them home matches, and the two close games we lost, hurt us. In some matches which went down the wire, we could not win the crucial moments. If you leave so many things to be done in the later half of the season then it's always a challenge.""Bangar highlighted the batting performances of domestic players Prabhsimran Singh , Shashank Singh , and Ashutosh Sharma as one of the positives for his side this season.""If you look at the performances of the domestic batsmen Prabhsimran Singh, Shashank Singh and Ashutosh Sharma, those are the real positives for us as far as our season goes in the batting department.""The former India batter said the loss of players like Liam Livingstone and Kagido Rabada hurt the team.""When we went to the auction, the ECB (England and Wales Cricket Board) had made it clear that all the players will be available. It is just that it so happens that the tournament got slightly extended, I would say, because of multiple reasons. Everybody were in a similar position but we lost those English players,"" he said.""For us, even losing Livingstone with a niggle around his knee, the ECB pulling him out. Even KG ( Kagiso Rabada ) had an infection and he had to go back (to South Africa). Those things coupled together meant that when we came to the last two matches, we were short of players of international pedigree and experience.""That hurt us but that is not the sole reason why our season was below par.""Talking about Sunday's match against SRH, he said, ""We could not contain them (SRH batters) after having the wicket of Travis Head first ball. We could have bowled a little bit better.""Once the field spread out we could have applied a little more pressure on them. We have given away 15-20 runs too many in powerplay.""","Punjab Kings finished ninth out of ten teams in the highly competitive T20 tournament.

Virat Kohli is in fine form and Suryakumar Yadav is in good touch. Two left-arm pacers are going, who can bowl in powerplay. Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja are going.""""However, matches there are at 10:00 AM in the morning. The wickets are also drop-in. The team should get used to these wickets and conditions as soon as possible,"" he added.On vice-captain Hardik Pandya 's poor run of form in the IPL, Raina said, ""He has done really well (for India).

But the new batter Rahul Tripathi , who came into the playing XI after a long time, made an immediate impact scoring 33 runs off 18 and lent a good hand to Abhishek Sharma in the partnership that helped them chase down the total.SRH fast bowling coach James Franklin is mighty pleased with the way Tripathi came into the side and delivered straight away. ""I think Rahul Tripathi did that brilliantly. He hasn't played a game for a wee while, so to come out and really suit himself in the manner that he did and create that partnership with Abhishek was probably what got us ahead of the runway in terms of chasing down a pretty big score,"" he said after the win.He also said the partnership between Tripathi and Abhishek that helped them clinch the result. ""Yeah, obviously a great partnership from the foundation for that chase. And then the others, they came in and just continued it on. And I think that just meant that we just stayed ahead of the rate the whole time. And maybe those last 3 or 4 overs, we took a bit too much time. But we also got the job done which was good.""When asked the reason behind bringing in Tripathi for the clash, he revealed, ""We just chased the dynamic for today's game. We've been picking our squads very much on a game-by-game basis. And we went with the extra batters today as opposed to the extra bowler. And it worked in terms of using Rahul in the way that he did. He played fabulously. But as we move forward into the playoffs, again, the selection debate will happen and we'll work out what our best squad is for whoever we play and whatever game we play. I think that'll be good.""After a couple of quiet games, Klaasen also returned to form, playing a key role in the victory. ""I think when you've got such a high-quality player like Klaasen in our team, when they've probably had a couple of games pushed by their own standards, they're probably not entirely happy with how quickly they work out what they need to do to make those little subtle improvements moving forward. And I think we've seen that tonight with how brutal he is against spinners. There are a couple of balls there which, if you actually look back at them, they're pretty good balls from Punjab Spinners. But he's so quick on pick-out length. He's devastating to pull a couple of balls straight, I think, straight. But looking at the six, brilliant. And that's what he's done for a period of time now. So, hopefully tonight he's shown some nice signs for himself and for us moving forward tonight.""Meanwhile, Sanjay Bangar, Punjab Kings’ director of cricket development said, ""I suspect that we could have bowled a little bit better, which would have meant that once the field spread out then we could have applied a little more pressure. We gave away 15-20 runs too many in the powerplay,"" he added.He also rued that they failed to come up with good shows in their home ground. ""I felt we just couldn't adapt to the home conditions because if you look, we played seven away matches and won four. And, at home, we just won one match. So, if a team has to progress further in the tournament, certainly that is a worrying aspect as to why you can't win many more home games,"" Bangar said.",Sunrisers Hyderabad beat Punjab Kings by four wickets in their IPL clash.

On the next Indian striker par excellence

On possibly missing the chance of reaching the 100-goal peak in international football

KOLKATA: Sunil Chhetri is at peace with himself now. A day after announcing his retirement from international football , he woke up on Friday with 688 missed calls on his cell phone.“It isn’t easy,” he said with a smile.It was a decision driven by instinct. It was a decision taken in consultation with Indian cricket star and his friend, Virat Kohli.“I discussed with him (Kohli) because we both understand the ups and downs of a career and take the step of calling time on it,” Chhetri said during a virtual interaction with media persons from Bhubaneswar, where Igor Stimac’s India are preparing for the upcoming FIFA 2026 World Cup qualifiers.As Chhetri gets ready for his swansong in the Blue Tigers’ jersey with the clash against Kuwait at the Salt Lake Stadium on June 6, the legendary Indian with 94 goals and 150 matches opened up on his 19-year journey and more.I don’t know the exact date, but probably 10 to 15 days after the Afghanistan game (which India lost 1-2 in Guwahati in the World Cup qualifiers on March 26) I started thinking about retirement. I was fighting with myself, trying to think holistically. Eventually it came with an instinct and when it came it was so individualistic, so narrow that I was taking time and it wasn’t easy. But now I am at peace with my decision.I’m very optimistic about the future of Indian football . There is a lot of fight for different positions. When you talk about the No. 9 one, there are a lot of candidates doing well. Unfortunately, they don’t play enough games in that position in the ISL. And in due time, I hope that changes. If you take this season’s two finalists (Mumbai City and Mohun Bagan SG), Liston Colaco and Manvir Singh or Bipin Singh, Vikram Pratap (Singh) and Chhangte or (Anirudh) Thapa playing as No. 10 or Sahal (Abdul Samad)...all these attacking players are really doing well. I do understand that No. 9 is a specific one, but I’m pretty sure that with the talent we have and the structure we have, we’ll get one.I don’t feel hollow, not reaching a hundred doesn’t bother me at all. 150 games — that’s the number that I really love. Playing 150 matches will be on top of everything if I have to tell my son what I had achieved as a footballer.I’ve never paid any heed to such things earlier. But now I may be thinking more about it. A very good-looking and hard-working player — this is how I would like to be remembered as.I’ll probably do coaching licenses just to be more knowledgeable (about the game). You see all these coaches who are handsome and in one year they lose hair and everything. I don’t want to lose my hair and grow older! I’ll think (about my future role) during my sabbatical but coaching is not very higher on my agenda right now.One or two years maximum. I am with Bengaluru FC for another year.

NEW DELHI: Lionel Messi is expected to rejoin Inter Miami 's starting lineup on Saturday night when the Herons face DC United at home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.The Argentine superstar sat out Wednesday night's goalless draw against Orlando City due to a knee problem, marking his fifth absence from league play for the Eastern Conference leaders (8-2-4, 28 points).In the five matches without Messi, the Herons have managed only one victory and two draws. However, they remain undefeated in the nine games he has featured in, securing seven wins in the process.Messi's absence on Wednesday seemed to be more of a precautionary measure for load management. Coach Tata Martino expressed optimism about the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner's return for Saturday's match, and Messi's name was not listed on the league's player availability report released on Friday night. ""We trained well yesterday, and we hope to train well today. We will define it after training, but we are optimistic about (Saturday's) match,"" Martino said Friday, via an interpretation from Spanish by USA Today.With 10 goals and a league-leading 12 assists, Messi has been in scintillating form this season. His former FC Barcelona teammate, Luis Suarez , is among three MLS players tied for the top spot in the goalscoring charts with 11 goals.DC United's Christian Benteke , who also has 11 goals to his name, failed to find the back of the net in his team's 4-1 home defeat to the New York Red Bulls on Wednesday night. Despite missing some excellent opportunities to claim the outright lead in the goalscoring race, Benteke's chances may not have altered the outcome against the Red Bulls, who posed a consistent threat on the counter-attack.The loss marked the third occasion this season where DC (4-4-5, 17 points) have conceded three or more goals at home. ""I mean listen, I think everyone was disappointed the other night, and the things that we didn't get right, we try to address in a really short time. And I think that's just trying to identify where some of the game got away from us. And I think a lot of those things are controllables,"" DC coach Troy Lesesne said.Away from home, DC have proven to be a tough side to beat, drawing four out of six matches and securing their first road victory last weekend with a 3-2 win over Atlanta United, courtesy of Benteke's second hat trick of the campaign.

NEW DELHI: Pep Guardiola has warned that Manchester City cannot take anything for granted as they seek to claim an unprecedented fourth consecutive Premier League title against West Ham on Sunday.City currently lead Arsenal by two points going into the final day of the season, meaning they control their destiny in the title race.Guardiola highlighted the importance of remaining vigilant and focused, recalling the dramatic final day two years ago when City had to come from 2-0 down late on to beat Aston Villa 3-2, securing the title and denying Liverpool .This serves as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of football and the need for City to maintain their concentration until the very end.In their recent match, City faced a tough challenge from Tottenham, eventually winning 2-0. Despite many Spurs fans wanting their own side to lose to prevent their north London rivals Arsenal from claiming their first title in 20 years, City had to work hard to secure the victory.Guardiola's cautious approach underscores the competitive nature of the Premier League and the necessity for City to give their all in the decisive match against West Ham.""We would like to be 3-0 up after 10 minutes but that's not going to happen,"" Guardiola said at his pre-match press conference on Friday.""I'm ready for it to be a tough, tough game. I want to put in the mind of the players, 'Look at Tottenham, how they fought for every ball'.""It was the same with Aston Villa two years ago -- they were in the same position, they didn't have anything to play for -- and we know what happened.""Our people have to come here and be ready from the first minute, to be with us and do it together.""City are attempting to become the first side in history to win four straight English top-flight titles and are on the brink of a sixth Premier League win in the past seven seasons.Guardiola batted away suggestions that his side do not get the credit they deserve for the scale of those achievements.""I don't know what people think but if you ask all the Premier League teams at the start of the season, they would want to be in our position,"" he said.""We have one game left, destiny in our hands. Win our game and we will be champions.""They (the players) know it is win or win, otherwise Arsenal will be champions.""",Pep Guardiola has warned that Manchester City cannot take anything for granted as they seek to claim an unprecedented fourth consecutive Premier League title.
