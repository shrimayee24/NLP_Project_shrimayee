Rahul was visible, a little too much? A lookback at 2025

Mahatma Gandhi once envisioned a future where the Congress would quietly dissolve itself into a Lok Sevak Sangh after Independence, having fulfilled its role and returned power to the people. History, as it often does, chose drama instead. The party stayed on, grew older, heavier with legacy -- and now, at 140, finds itself older than independent India and still very much in the business of electoral survival.Founded in 1885, the Indian National Congress didn’t just witness the making of modern India; it scripted large parts of it. But fast-forward to the present, and the party that once defined the political centre is struggling to locate it. The slogans are loud, the marches long, the symbolism familiar—but dominance has been replaced by damage control, and nostalgia no longer guarantees votes.Now, stepping into its 141st year, the Congress has little time to blow out birthday candles and even less room to get things wrong. A series of assembly elections across five states is lining up as its next reality check, testing whether fresh campaign calls, revived alliances, and lessons from a bruising 2025 can finally add up.From rebranding protest politics to fighting key battles in the south and the northeast, the grand old party is once again at the crossroads -- older, wiser, and under pressure to prove it still knows the way forward.Save the Constitution, vote chori, caste survey -- these are some of the battle cries Congress tried to campaign on. Rahul Gandhi walked miles for it. While the leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha may have charmed those he walked with, the votes did not enter its account.2026, however, would see a break from these campaign calls as the Grand Old Party announced nationwide protests against the BJP-led central government for replacing the rural employment scheme - MGNREGA - with VB G-RAM-G law.""We also pledge to democratically oppose every conspiracy to remove Gandhiji's name from MNREGA,"" Mallikarjun Kharge said at the CWC meet as he announced the campaign from January 5.But the question is, would the people who need the scheme relate to ""conspiracy to remove Gandhiji's name from MNREGA""?While the CWC release does highlight what it describes as the systematic dilution of MNREGA, including unilateral changes to the scheme’s structure without consultation or parliamentary debate, the beneficiaries in whose name the Congress is mobilising are unlikely to engage with or prioritise such detailed party statements.Out of the five states that are set to see ballot contests this year, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry remain the crucial ones for Congress. The party will directly face the BJP or the Left in these assembly elections.The party is riding on high confidence with a sweeping comeback in the Kerala local body polls. However, the BJP-led NDA's Trivandrum win cannot be ignored.The local body election results offer the Congress-led UDF a clear strategic edge heading into the upcoming assembly polls. A pronounced anti-incumbency wave has cut through the LDF’s welfare and governance narrative, pushing the Left to its weakest grassroots position in years and denting its push for a third consecutive term.While the BJP’s expanding footprint has complicated Kerala’s traditional bipolar contest, the erosion of LDF dominance gives the UDF momentum, credibility, and a renewed claim as the principal alternative as the assembly battle approaches.After its 2016 defeat in Assam—driven by deep anti-incumbency, alliance consolidation by the BJP, and voter frustration over corruption, jobs, and governance—the Congress is recalibrating its approach. This time, the party is foregrounding a grassroots-first strategy through its “Raijor Podulit Raijor Congress” campaign, aimed at rebuilding credibility from the bottom up. By crowdsourcing inputs for its manifesto via thousands of “aspirational boxes” and sustained community outreach across regions, the Congress is seeking to address precisely the issues that cost it power earlier: employment, fair wages for tea workers, flood management, public health, and governance delivery.At the organisational level, the Congress is also positioning itself as the anchor of a broad opposition alliance to take on the BJP, while trying to avoid the fragmentation that helped its rivals in the past.However, the decision to contest 100 of 126 seats has exposed fault lines within the alliance, making seat-sharing and coordination a key test of leadership. Balancing assertiveness with accommodation, translating consultation into votes, and countering the BJP’s entrenched narrative on identity and development remain the party’s central challenges as it looks to convert renewed mobilisation into an electoral comeback in Assam.Congress finds itself walking a tightrope within the DMK-led alliance. While it wants to improve its bargaining position by pressing for a higher number of seats, the party has to contend with its relatively weak independent base in the state and the DMK’s clear upper hand.The party’s challenge lies in projecting relevance and cohesion without appearing disruptive, ensuring smooth coordination at the grassroots for vote transfer, and managing internal ambitions—all while avoiding strain in a long-standing alliance that remains crucial for its electoral survival in Tamil Nadu.Conflicting actions by individual leaders, including high-profile meetings outside the alliance framework, have added to doubts about unity and discipline, even if these are intended mainly to strengthen Congress’s hand in talks.Congress heads into the West Bengal polls facing an existential challenge shaped by years of steady decline and shrinking political space. From being a significant player with strongholds in Malda and Murshidabad a decade ago, the party has slipped into near irrelevance, drawing a blank in the 2021 assembly election and losing even its traditional bases.This collapse has coincided with the BJP’s rapid rise as the principal opposition to the Trinamool Congress, leaving Congress squeezed out of the bipolar contest. Compounding the problem is Mamata Banerjee’s clear insistence on going it alone, shutting the door on any meaningful alliance and reducing Congress’s bargaining power to zero.With no dominant leader, weak organisation, and little clarity on whether it is fighting for seats, vote share or mere visibility, Congress enters the 2026 battle not just struggling to regain relevance, but fighting to remain a credible political force in Bengal at all.The recent remarks from within and around the Congress have given fresh momentum to the question of whether the party is informally sounding out Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as a larger leadership option amid its ongoing churn.The letter by former Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim, questioning Mallikarjun Kharge’s effectiveness and explicitly citing age and youth disconnect, reflects a deeper anxiety within sections of the party about stagnation and electoral drift.Endorsements of Priyanka—ranging from Imran Masood’s projection of her as a prime ministerial face to Robert Vadra’s acknowledgement of growing demands—suggest an undercurrent that sees her as a potential unifying figure who could reconnect the party with voters.Rather than a clear leadership challenge, the episode points to a Congress struggling to balance generational renewal, organisational reform and its continued reliance on the Gandhi family, with Priyanka emerging less as a declared alternative and more as a symbol of unresolved succession questions.2025 was a year of motion without payoff for the Congress. Rahul Gandhi’s 1,300-kilometre march through Bihar—spanning 25 districts and 110 seats—came loaded with slogans, symbolism, and carefully curated local flavour. From gamchas and Bhojpuri soundbites to makhana and motorbike rides, the outreach was exhaustive. The results were not. Voters showed up, but they did not line up behind the Congress, leaving the party staring at one of its weakest performances in the state and once again exposing the gap between optics and organisation.That disconnect played out across the electoral map. The promise of 2024’s Lok Sabha showing evaporated in the 2025 Assembly elections in Haryana, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Delhi. Haryana slipped away amid factional squabbles and the absence of a decisive state leader.Maharashtra saw alliance fatigue within the MVA blunt Congress’s impact. In Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the BJP’s machine, backed by Narendra Modi’s enduring pull, steamrolled Congress campaigns. Delhi remained a write-off. Jharkhand stood apart, where the Congress survived by riding on the back of a strong JMM alliance and a welfare-driven pitch—less a revival than a reminder of where the party still works.Rahul Gandhi ensured the Congress never vanished from the headlines, sharpening his attacks with claims of “vote chori” and warnings of systemic voter fraud. The rhetoric kept the narrative alive, but elections are won on the ground, not in press conferences. By the end of 2025, the verdict was hard to miss: the Congress can still set the conversation, but without organisational discipline and credible state leadership, it continues to lose the contest.","The Indian National Congress has little time to blow out birthday candles and even less room to get things wrong.

Pulwama cricketer wears helmet with Palestinian flag sticker; cops start probe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pulwama-cricketer-wears-helmet-with-palestinian-flag-sticker-cops-start-probe/articleshow/126311917.cms,"J&K cricketer wears helmet with Palestine flag

JAMMU/SRINAGAR: J&K police have started a probe after videos went viral of a cricketer, Furqan Ul Haq, walking into a Jammu tournament wearing a Palestinian flag sticker on his helmet. The row also took on a political edge, with the PDP and others backing the Pulwama youth and BJP condemning the act as an attempt to incite “separatism”.The controversy broke Wednesday after Furqan strode in to bat at Jammu and Kashmir Champions League in Muthi, around 10km from Jammu city, for his team JK Eleven Kings with the flag emblazoned on his helmet. Some players of the rival team Jammu Trail Blazers raised strong objections, leading Furqan’s team to send him back and oust him from the match.On Friday, the police issued a statement confirming a preliminary inquiry to “ascertain the facts” Furqan’s “intent, background and any possible linkages”. The 14-day preliminary inquiry under Section 173(3) BNSS has been ordered given the sensitivity of the matter and its potential public order implications, the statement added. Furqan and the private organisers of the tournament were later called to Jammu’s Domana police station for the inquiry.Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA) distanced itself from the controversy, maintaining that the tournament was a private event and not recognised by it. “JKCA has nothing to do with this. It involves local players. Even spectators are not allowed. Police will take necessary action,” JKCA official Anil Gupta said.While JKCA shrugged off the issue, politicians didn’t. Former CM and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti posted a message in support of Palestine. “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free. A flag in the wind, bold and free, From the river to the sea,” Mehbooba wrote on X after reports about the police inquiry.Sheikh Khursheed, Awami Ittehad Party MLA and brother of jailed Baramulla MP Engineer Rashid, called the police action “unjustified.” Khursheed said expressing solidarity with Palestine should not be treated as a crime, particularly when India has consistently supported the Palestinian cause internationally.Khursheed recalled that Congress’s Priyanka Gandhi had carried a bag bearing a Palestine symbol in Parliament without facing action. “If such expressions are acceptable for politicians, targeting a sportsperson for a symbolic gesture exposes selective outrage,” Khursheed said.BJP, however, denounced Furqan. Party MLA RS Pathania called for strict action against the cricketer and the organisers of the match, saying such deeds “emanating from Kashmir only promotes separatism”.This is the second cricket event in J&K to have been engulfed by controversy in less than two months. In Nov last year, the privately run Indian Heaven Premier League (IHPL) collapsed when its organisers allegedly bolted out of Srinagar after duping players, officials, broadcasters and hoteliers.","J&K police have started a probe after videos went viral of a cricketer wearing a Palestinian flag sticker on his helmet.

NEW DELHI: The high-decibel “vote chori” campaign led by Rahul Gandhi , which had united the opposition cutting across party lines last year, now seems to have created a divide between them. This, after Trinamool Congress leader Abhishek Banerjee claimed that the Congress and some other regional parties had failed to understand how the game of “vote chori” was happening through the process of Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls under the watch of the Election Commission .The Trinamool leader also questioned the approach of these parties as he asserted that the “fight against vote chori was on the ground at the booth level and not on social media and TV channels.”The Congress reacted sharply to his remarks. And the charge was led by West Bengal leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who has been one of the strongest critics of Mamata’s Trinamool Congress. Adhir accused Abhishek, who is the nephew of Mamata Banerjee, of following Rahul Gandhi by walking on the path shown by the former Congress president to take credit.“Everyone in India and even across the world knows that it is Rahul Gandhi who had exposed ""vote chori” in elections and attacked the Election Commission and it was his sustained campaign that even forced the Supreme Court to intervene at least five times in the process of SIR. This nephew of Bengal is now trying to copy the agenda of Rahul Gandhi and take credit,” Adhir said, attacking Mamata’s nephew.Chowdhury, who is a former West Bengal Congress president, also alleged that Mamata’s nephew always attacked and abused the Congress while not saying anything against the BJP.""When he was called for questioning by the ED, he came out and attacked the Congress, not the ED or the BJP. Now, he went to the ECI office, and then, as he stepped out, he again abused the Congress. Let people see for themselves who he is working for. He doesn't say a single word against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),"" Adhir said.Congress’s reaction came after Abhishek Banerjee claimed that “vote chori” was happening through the electoral rolls and not the EVMs.“Vote chori is happening in voter lists through the electoral rolls and not in the EVMs.If the Congress and other parties could have caught this game, the BJP would have lost all the states it won last year. Such high strike rates of BJP in so many states were not a coincidence. Congress, AAP, RJD could not understand the game,” claimed Abhishek Banerjee.He claimed that opposition parties are failing to understand what ""algorithms and software are being run to disenfranchise and remove 50 lakh to 1 crore voters"" and said if this is not happening, the ""poll panel should release a list of 1.36 crore logical discrepancies.""Abhishek also went on to question the approach of these parties in highlighting the “vote chori” allegations. “Those who think that elections can be won by making a few strong remarks on TV channels have got it wrong. The fight is on the ground and you have to fight at the booth level to prevent it,” he said.Clearly, this was a strong message to the Congress, especially Rahul Gandhi, who was the first to make “vote chori” allegations and tried very hard to make it an election issue in Bihar, but failed.Led by Abhishek, the Trinamool Congress has unleashed an all-out offensive against the Election Commission. The Trinamool leader has locked horns with CEC Gyanesh Kumar over the process of SIR and has asserted that his party will not accept the electoral roll if the discrepancies are not removed.“Our position is unambiguous and non-negotiable: The entire list of voters branded under the vague and arbitrary label of 'Logical Discrepancy' must be published immediately, with clear Assembly-constituency-wise and category-wise break-ups. The criteria, methodology, and legal authority used to create this category must be placed in the public domain without delay,” the Trinamool has said after a heated meeting with the Election Commission on Wednesday.","Abhishek Banerjee claims Congress, AAP, RJD could not understand game of 'vote chori' West Bengal leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury accuses Mamata's nephew of following Rahul Gandhi's path to take credit.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126310144,imgsize-961807,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"

BJP Leader Attacks Shah Rukh Khan Over KKR's Bangladeshi Cricketer Amid Hindu Lynching in Bangladesh

.

NEW DELHI: Hindu religious leaders and BJP figures have launched sharp attacks on Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan over his IPL team Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) selecting Bangladeshi cricketer Mustafizur Rahman , while the Congress has stepped in to defend the actor, calling the remarks against him an attack on India’s pluralism.The first public criticism came from Hindu spiritual leader Devkinandan Thakur, who questioned KKR’s decision in the backdrop of reported violence against Hindu minorities in Bangladesh. Speaking to ANI, Thakur said the KKR management should remove the Bangladeshi player. He demanded that the money paid to the cricketer be given to families of Hindu victims as an apology.""The management of KKR, their boss, should remove that cricketer (Mustafizur Rahman). Rs 9.2 crore that they are giving to that cricketer, that money should be given as an apology to the relatives of the Hindu children if they are in India, so that at least they can know that their feelings are with the Hindus,"" Thakur said.Spiritual leader Jagadguru Swami Rambhadracharya went on to questioned Khan’s character and called hhim a traitor.""He (Shah Rukh Khan) is not a hero. Shah Rukh Khan does not have a character.His actions have been those of a traitor,"" Rambhadracharya said.Soon after, BJP leader Sangeet Som called Shah Rukh Khan a “traitor” and accused him of investing money in a player from a country he claimed was “working against India”. Som said Mustafizur Rahman would not be allowed to play in the IPL.""The way Hindus are being persecuted in Bangladesh, women and girls are being raped, their homes are being burned, and anti-India slogans are being chanted there. Despite all this, traitors like Shah Rukh Khan, I'm calling him a traitor because everything he has is given by India, given by the people of India, but where do they invest this money? They invest it in players from a country that is working against India. I want to tell people like Shah Rukh Khan that they will not succeed. At any cost, they will not be able to get Mustafizur Rahman to play here. Rahman won't be able to step outside the airport,"" Som told ANI.The response from Congress followed soon after. MP Manickam Tagore condemned the remarks against Khan, calling them an attack on India’s pluralism. In a post on X, Tagore said hatred could not define nationalism and criticised the RSS for spreading division.""Calling Superstar Shah Rukh Khan a 'traitor' is an attack on India's pluralism. Hate cannot define nationalism. RSS must stop poisoning society.""The attacks come amid a series of violent incidents targeting members of the Hindu community in Bangladesh. Last month, two Hindu youths were lynched in separate incidents.

India News - The Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/boundless-welcome/articleshow/126307036.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar , the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. Some verses take time to convince us. They sit patiently, waiting for the mind to ripen. As a teenager, I remember feeling faintly dissatisfied with a few couplets of Thiruvalluvar. They appeared lofty, even impractical. One such couplet was in the chapter on hospitality , a virtue the Tamil world has always treated not as etiquette, but as dharma. Valluvar wrote: “Viththum Idal Vendum Kollo Virundhombi Michchil Misaivaan Pulam” Is it necessary to sow seed in the field of the man who, having feasted his guests, eats what may remain? Couplet 85 puzzled me deeply. Why would a man who feeds others be exempt from sowing his own seeds? Was Valluvar exaggerating? Feeling that I was missing something essential, I asked my mother who asked my grandmother to tell us a story that afternoon. That day became my first introduction to the Nayanmaars, the 63 celebrated servitors of Shiva. And it came not from scripture, but a steel chatti of tangy puli saadam in our small Triplicane house. My grandmother was a large, imposing woman with a gentle voice. During summer vacations, lunch was always fed by her hand, and every meal came with a story. That day, it was the story of Ilayankudi Mara Nayanmaar. Maran was a devoted servant of Shiva, bound by a vow to feed visiting devotees every single day. His offerings were balanced with all six tastes. Over time, poverty crept in and debts mounted. Yet his resolve did not weaken. Hospitality, for him, was identity. One monsoon night, Maran and his wife lay hungry, having eaten nothing all day. Rain lashed the earth and the wind howled. At that moment, a visitor arrived — soaked, weary, and hungry. The couple welcomed him without hesitation. There was no food left in the house. No grain. No firewood. Maran’s wife reminded him of the paddy grains soaked in the field earlier that day, meant for sowing. A farmer’s most sacred possession. No farmer would dare touch them. But Maran did. In the storm, amidst slush and snakes, he walked to his field and gathered the wet grains. Back home, he cut a wooden beam from the roof and plucked greens growing around the house. A meal was prepared from almost nothing. A plantain leaf was laid and hot food served. When the couple invited the guest to partake of the meal, he did not step forward. Instead, he revealed himself as a sudden flash of light. Shiva appeared with Shakti, seated on the holy bull, blessing the devoted couple and granting them eternal grace. Years later, when I read this episode in the Periya Puranam , it returned to me with renewed force. Maran could have refused. His wife could have turned the guest away. What guided them was not even devotion to God — but unwavering commitment to the guest. Adithi devo bhava, virundhinar deivam — the guest as divine — is not a metaphor in our culture. It is a lived philosophy. My thoughts went back to Valluvar. He posed a question and gave an inherent answer. A person who the service to humanity as service to God, need not toil, need not sow the seeds. Perhaps because the universe sows for him. Perhaps because grace follows those who give without calculation. Or perhaps because hospitality itself is the richest harvest. Valluvar was not being illogical after all. He was simply seeing further than most of us do.","The Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love.

The San Francisco 49ers and Leeds United explain the York family’s money trail





Denise DeBartolo York and her family landed at No. 163 on the 2025 Forbes 400, with Forbes estimating their net worth at $8.4 billion. That figure comes from Forbes’ latest ranking, as reported Sept. 19, 2025.This is not some mystery-money story. Forbes ties the York family fortune primarily to their ownership of the San Francisco 49ers, where the family holds more than 90% of the franchise.The Forbes 400 list is basically a “you’re in or you’re out” snapshot of America’s richest. In 2025, Forbes said the 400 wealthiest Americans held $6.6 trillion combined, and you needed at least $3.8 billion to make the cut.The York family cleared that bar easily. WFMJ’s report notes the family’s wealth has climbed hard over the last decade, tracking Forbes wealth history data: $1.9 billion in 2016, $3.2 billion by 2020, and then the 2025 Forbes 400 estimate at $8.4 billion.They also landed ahead of other famous names on that same 2025 list, including Mark Cuban and Steven Spielberg, per the same report.Here’s the straight line: Edward DeBartolo Sr. bought the San Francisco 49ers for $13 million in 1977, and the family still controls the franchise today.Denise DeBartolo York took control of the 49ers in 2000. Her oldest son, Jed York, is now the team’s CEO. Forbes also lists the 49ers as the NFL’s sixth-most valuable franchise, and the team finished as the Super Bowl runner-up in 2023.Then the family pushed further into global soccer. The 49ers’ ownership arm agreed to buy the remaining 56% stake in Leeds United in 2023 after already owning 44%.The WFMJ report said the family paid more than $200 million to acquire that remaining stake.Bottom line: the Yorks aren’t climbing because of a random side hustle. Their net worth rises when their sports assets rise. And the biggest one is still the 49ers.Denise DeBartolo York and her family landed at No. 163 on the latest Forbes 400, with an estimated net worth of $8.4 billion, driven largely by their majority ownership of the San Francisco 49ers, which Forbes ranks as the National Football League’s sixth most valuable franchise. York, who took control of the team in 2000, now sees her son Jed York serving as CEO, while the family has also expanded into global soccer with their takeover of Leeds United in 2023.","Denise DeBartolo York and her family landed at No. 163 on the 2025 Forbes 400, with Forbes estimating their net worth at $8.4 billion.

Patrick Mahomes welcomes 2026 focused on rehab as Chiefs shift from urgency to patience





The Kansas City Chiefs are closing out a season few in the locker room expected, and the unease has little to do with the standings. For the first time in years, the focus in Kansas City has shifted away from playoff math and toward patience. At the center of it all is Patrick Mahomes, whose recovery has quietly become the franchise’s most important storyline heading into 2026.While Andy Reid addressed the situation publicly, it was Brittany Mahomes who offered the most telling glimpse. A New Year’s Instagram post showed a joyful family moment, fireworks overhead, children close by. Yet one detail stood out. Patrick Mahomes was still on crutches, his knee wrapped in a heavy brace. The image said more than any official update. Rehab remains the priority, and the process is far from over.Patrick Mahomes suffered ACL and LCL tears late in Week 15 against the Chargers while pushing to keep the season alive. That single play reshaped the Chiefs’ winter. The expectation inside the organization is cautious optimism, with a hopeful return near Week 1. Until then, progress is measured in small, deliberate steps, not timelines.Reid confirmed Mahomes has stayed deeply involved, even if he will not travel with the team for the Week 18 finale. As the coach explained, “He’s around, so he’s in the building and working and doing his rehab, and spending a lot of hours doing it.” Reid added, “He’s really attacked that and will continue to do that. He’s around and sees the guys, but most of his time is being spent rehabbing.”Asked about Mahomes joining the team on the road, Reid shut that down quickly. “Probably not this soon, no,” he said.The decision reflects caution, not concern. Knee injuries demand discipline, and the Chiefs see no value in unnecessary strain. Rehab will stretch through the offseason, likely into training camp, with careful checkpoints along the way.For now, Mahomes enters 2026 grounded, surrounded by family, focused on recovery. The season may be ending, but belief in Kansas City remains firmly intact.Also Read: “Hate will not get us out”: Brittany Mahomes addresses hate and healing during emotionally charged moment off the field","Patrick Mahomes is entering 2026 focused entirely on rehab after suffering ACL and LCL tears late in the season.

Natalya Neidhart’s WWE career and earnings growth

Tyson Kidd’s in-ring success and post-injury WWE role





Natalya Neidhart and Tyson Kidd were born into professional wrestling and WWE universe and have been established since they were 20 years old. Through WWE contracts, television showcases, and decades of steady employment instead of fleeting headlines, both built financial futures. Good record of relevancy, including expanding their combined net worth.Neither is among WWE's top 10 global superstars so far as compensation, at least on the finer points of the evening, but the dollars tell the tale of consistent success for each. Natalya is still appearing regularly, while Tyson Kidd moved into an important backstage position after suffering a career-ending injury. Combined, their earnings have been accumulated with salaries, achievement bonuses, merchandise royalties, and offstage duties not associated with actual wrestling.Natalya Neidhart has had one of the longest, uninterrupted runs in WWE's modern era women's division. Having first debuted on the main roster in the late 2000s, she quickly became a consistent presence on weekly television, premium live events, and overseas excursions. This consistency eventually progressed into an uptick in contract renewals and a small bump in pay every year.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.The bulk of Natalya's income has traditionally come from a salary she is guaranteed to earn annually, bonuses related to major events, merchandise, and further exposure via WWE-related media. The association with the iconic Hart wrestling family only enhanced her brand value, allowing her to remain relevant throughout almost every era of women's wrestling. Her individual net worth has widely been estimated at around $2 million, a figure based on years of reliable earnings, not temporary highs.Tyson Kidd’s real-life identity is TJ Wilson. He started his career working as an in-ring performer, predominantly as a skilled singles male and tag team wrestler. However, a serious neck injury in 2015 saw his career take a drastic turn when he was forced to stop competing full-time.Instead of releasing him, WWE kept Kidd backstage in a producer and trainer role. It's a role that hardly anyone but hardcore fans will notice, but guarantees employment, stability, and permanence in a company. His continued role in planning matches and developing talent has helped him secure an ongoing source of income, which is reported at $3 million.Combined, Natalya Neidhart and husband Tyson Kidd have a net worth estimated at $5 million. That number represents two decades' worth of WWE contracts, bonuses, royalties, and near-constant employment. Their financial profile is linked to longevity, faith from management, and shifting roles within WWE, the opposite of top-tier superstars, most of whom work based on huge short-term contracts.Also Read: What is really going on with WWE star Nikki Bella and NFL star Cooper DeJean’s dating buzz on Netflix?","Natalya Neidhart and husband Tyson Kidd have a net worth estimated at $5 million.

Why are Vancouver Canucks and Boston Bruins emerging as trade market storylines?



Bruins URGED to make HUGE trade... Report reveals NEXT move | Boston Bruins News





The NHL rumor roundup is getting hotter as the speculation around Vancouver Canucks trades involving Kiefer Sherwood and Elias Pettersson heats up, while the Boston Bruins are rumored to be inquiring about Matias Maccelli ahead of the March 6 trade day. With several clubs looking into the market from the start, these unfolding plots are rapidly capturing the attention of all the people around the league.It has been reported that both sides are quietly investigating the possibilities, and this information comes from Sportsnet, The Athletic, and The Province sources. A lot of names are thrown around, and the management is set to acquire the best ones. The rumor mill is very busy as the deadline is approaching.The Canucks' trade of Quinn Hughes to the Minnesota Wild not only surprised the league but also hinted that more such changes could be in the offing. Vancouver’s Elliotte Friedman of Sportsnet has Kiefer Sherwood, the winger, as the potential trade candidate from the Canucks, while he also mentioned on The Fan Hockey Show that the San Jose Sharks might be interested in him. Vancouver seems to be receptive to the idea of trading off some of its players before the deadline, as there are multiple teams making calls.Harman Dayal of The Athletic mentioned that the Canucks have to act quickly on impending UFAs if they are to control their freewheeling forward group. This could lead to the trading of either Sherwood or Evander Kane.At the same time, Patrick Johnston from The Province reported that there are still talks regarding Elias Pettersson, notwithstanding his poor performance and $11.6 million cap hit. On the other hand, the Bruins are reportedly interested in Matias Maccelli, as per Fluto Shinzawa of The Athletic, who sees him as a potential offensive boost for Boston; however, NESN’s Victor Barbosa has warned that a trade with Toronto could be complicated due to the rivalry between the two teams.The Vancouver Canucks and Boston Bruins are still the teams to monitor with the approaching trade deadline. The unfolding of these rumors into trades will be determined by several factors: timing, price, and playoff aspirations—but the talk around the league indicates that changes are to happen shortly. Trade discussions remain fluid as deadline pressure builds.Also Read: Top NHL suspensions and fines of 2025: Mathew Barzal, Carter Hart, Alex Formenton, and others disciplined",The NHL rumor roundup is getting hotter as the speculation around Vancouver Canucks trades involving Kiefer Sherwood and Elias Pettersson heats up.

Caitlin Clark is a huge Drake Maye fan



Caitlin Clark’s most-awaited recovery and return







With the Super Bowl almost a month away, everyone has their favorites, and so does WNBA’s biggest star, Caitlin Clark. On the recent episode of the “New Heights” podcast hosted by the Kelce brothers, Jason and Travis, the 2024 ROTY winner appeared and sparked a cross-sport debate after naming her favorites for Super Bowl 2026.Though Clark hails from Iowa, she admitted her admiration for the New England Patriots, which is largely influenced by her liking for Patriots star QB Drake Maye. This seemed like a classic case where greatness recognizes and appreciates greatness.The last episode of New Heights for 2025 was anything but not dramatic. In a conversation with Jason and Travis over who is Clark’s favorite to win the next Super Bowl, Caitlin revealed, “I may not be cheering for anybody…but honestly, I am a Drake Maye fan. He’s been incredible.Continuing, she said, “I will probably be pulling for the Patriots, but the Rams are really good too. Sam Darnold seems like a good guy…I could root for him.”Drake Maye and Caitlin Clark began their professional career in 2024 and have been proving to be a cornerstone for their teams. Draye Maye registered a completion rate of 66.6% completing 225-of-338 passes in 2024, over 2,276 yards, and 15 touchdowns.Clark also entered the 2025 season after a historic rookie campaign where she averaged 19.2 points and a league-leading 8.4 assists per game. Though her 2025 season ended early, just after 13 games, due to an injury, the snippets from the USA camp show Clark is healthier and ready to enter the 2026 season with a bang.While the Super Bowl occupies the current headline from who’ll play to who’ll perform at halftime, the Indy fever fans are more concerned with Clark’s physical longevity.Reports suggest her 100% recovery and her focus on strength training to return by the WNBA’s 2026 tip-off. Clark’s return is just not crucial for the Fever, whose offensive strength revolves around her, but also for the league as she’s a walking viewership magnet. The fourth-most-watched WNBA games of 2025 all featured Caitlin Clark and her team.

Yoenis Cespedes was never just another power hitter in the major league baseball. The former Oakland A's and the New York Mets star is known to bring that same flair to his life off the field. Very few players in the Major League Baseball have expressed their success in the larger-than-life manner as Cespedes did through his collection of luxury cars, which made spring training parking lots resemble unofficial car shows.The interest of Céspedes in high-performance machines gained popularity during his time playing with the New York Mets. His coming to spring training gained a lot of attention as much as his batting sessions did. A Lamborghini Aventador, which is traditionally priced at around $300,000, was the biggest treasure of Céspedes' collection, even before customization. This supercar came laced with some customized paint, wheels, a redesigned interior, and a flame-shooting exhaust that made it iconic quickly. Cespedes owns luxury, rare, and several off-road vehicles, most of which were customised to a large extent. His car collection consists of:A number of these cars were redesigned by the famed car designer, Alex Vega, who assisted in bringing Cespedes' concepts to life to create one-of-a-kind car statements.The mix of supercars and off-road trucks was a sign of Céspedes's admiration of both speed and power.For Céspedes, luxury cars are the ultimate measure of financial success. Having been brought up in Cuba, where people did not possess as many cars as they do in the United States, he tended to perceive cars as a source of liberty and success. Today, Céspedes’ car collection, comprising both large-scale customization and numerous pieces, was estimated to be near $1 million, which made his garage one of the hottest topics among MLB players. Céspedes has retired from Major League Baseball, but his luxury car collection still constitutes a part of his off-field legacy.Also Read: Is Juan Soto dating anyone?

Criticism resurfaces at the worst possible time

Lamar Jackson: 'I'm Gonna Be Out There' | Baltimore Ravens

Lamar Jackson addresses the allegations directly

Also Read:





As the Baltimore Ravens head into a crucial Week 18 showdown, Lamar Jackson finds himself battling more than just a division rival. The two-time NFL MVP is also pushing back against renewed criticism about his professionalism, choosing calm defiance over distraction as Baltimore’s playoff fate hangs in the balance.Jackson recently became the subject of a pointed column that questioned his work ethic, alleging late-night video game habits and even suggesting he had fallen asleep during team meetings. The criticism went further, urging the Ravens to consider trading their franchise quarterback claims that quickly gained traction given Baltimore’s uneven 2025 campaign.Speaking to reporters this week, Jackson dismissed the narrative without hesitation. He labeled the criticism as “noise,” stressing that speculation tends to surface whenever results don’t go as planned.“When you’re winning, there’s no talk,” Jackson said. “As soon as things don’t look right, all types of stuff comes out of nowhere.”Jackson was visibly amused by the suggestion that he had dozed off during meetings, flatly denying the claim and pointing to his relationship with head coach John Harbaugh as proof.“Do you really think Coach Harbaugh would let me fall asleep in meetings?” Jackson said with a laugh. “I’m sitting right in the front.”He also rejected reports about staying up late gaming, calling them completely fabricated and insisting they don’t reflect his routine even during the offseason. For Jackson, the focus remains on football, not on countering every headline.The timing of the criticism couldn’t be more sensitive. Jackson is expected to return this week after missing the Ravens’ Week 17 win due to a painful back injury. With the AFC North title still up for grabs, Baltimore controls its playoff destiny with a win against the Pittsburgh Steelers.Despite missing time, Jackson made it clear he had nothing to apologize for regarding his injury absence. “I’m human,” he said, noting that the team still found a way to win without him. There’s a familiar rhythm to the doubts surrounding Jackson. From early career debates about his position to recurring questions about leadership and preparation, the quarterback has consistently responded with results. Now, with his contract future and postseason hopes intersecting, Jackson appears unfazed.As Sunday approaches, the Ravens will look to their star quarterback to silence both rivals and critics. If Baltimore’s playoff hopes survive, Jackson’s response won’t come through words; it will come under the lights, where he has made a habit of rewriting the conversation.",Lamar Jackson has been the subject of renewed criticism about his work ethic.

Paul Skenes embraces a new look heading into 2026

Livvy Dunne’s playful response wins over fans

“baby face cutieeee”.





One of baseball’s brightest young stars, Paul Skenes, unveiled a new year look, and his girlfriend was among the first to react. In her TikTok posted on January 1, Livvy Dunne said she was filming her first reaction to boyfriend Paul Skenes being beardless, in a trick that immediately made fans sit up and take notice. Taking inspiration from this viral sound, the video opted to go for laughs, pairing the footage with the catchphrase ""Oh my goodness! She’s bald!”, and Dunne chronicled this unexpected change.The Pittsburgh Pirates ace, who is currently 23 years old, abandoned his former signature mustache at the start of the 2026 season, replacing the now-familiar look with a much cleaner face and the extremely well-groomed features that his fans immediately linked to his burgeoning career in Major League Baseball. Amidst this non-story, Dunne's witty response soon turned into part of the dialogue of that pop-culture moment in an otherwise quiet offseason update.Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Paul Skenes has been in the news cycle much of the last two years, both for his nasty, nasty mound games but also for his one-of-a-kind stache. Those whiskers got so much more visible when he went from college stud to MLB star, which made his shorn face that much more noticeable.The clean-shaven look, despite being cosmetic, signals a new chapter as he prepares for the 2026 campaign. Twitter users were quick to respond, many agreeing with Dunne that Skenes is just as good as ""baby face"" Skenes. Despite seeing nothing to indicate that the switch to No. 24 was more than a personal choice, it nevertheless confirms a good degree of offseason buzz.Dunne captured her approval in just a few words, writing alongside the video:The former LSU gymnast who has turned into one of the biggest names in sports social media for mixing humor with a bit of her personal life, as this post fell directly in line with.The pair, who went public with their romance in 2023, is no stranger to people talking when their worlds collide online. Fans loved the relatable response, as well as the couple's effortless chemistry, in this latest moment, too. And with Skenes setting up for yet another season filled with ample media opportunities and Dunne branching her brand outside of gymnastics, even such mundane activities as shaving a mustache are enough to hold the gaze of the fans watching so intently.Also Read: How tall is Fernando Tatis Jr?

LeBron James vs Stephen Curry salary breakdown

The net worth battle between LeBron James and Stephen Curry







LeBron James and Stephen Curry are the Mount Rushmore of modern NBA. They just do not dominate the court with their skills and game IQ, but make a significant impact off the court too. It is still wild to imagine how James and Curry were born in the same hospital. Shocked much? As reported by the Beacon Journal in 2015, both James (1984) and Curry (1988) were born at Akron General Medical Center in Ohio, just a few years apart.These two heavyweights just don’t outshine their opponents on the court, but they also command the financial landscape of NBA. From battling for rings to sharing a bond of trust and respect, LeBron James and Stephen Curry have come a long way and have done their bank account. One is a certified billionaire business mogul, while the other is currently the highest-paid on-court performer the league has ever seen.If one just looks at the seasonal paycheck, then Stephen Curry is actually winning. For the 2025–26 season, Steph is pulling in a staggering $59.6 million from the Golden State Warriors, making him the highest-paid player in the league, a record that he has held since 2017-18. But LeBron James isn't exactly lagging, despite his Lakers salary for this season sitting at $52.6 million.The difference is Curry’s art of the ""Supermax."" He was the first player to cross the $200 million contract threshold when he signed a 5-year $201 million deal with the Warriors in 2017. And with his recent veteran extension of $62 million for 1-year, Curry’s on his way to becoming the first NBA player to be paid $62 million for a single season in 2026-27. However, while Steph wins the annual salary race, LeBron still leads in total career on-court earnings, having banked over $580 million since he was drafted back in 2003.This is where the comparison gets steep and the difference wide. LeBron James officially hit billionaire status in 2022 and currently sits at a net worth of approximately $1.3 billion. He didn't get there just by playing ball; he built an empire. Between his lifetime Nike deal (rumored to be worth over $1 billion), his production company SpringHill, and stakes in Fenway Sports Group (which owns the Red Sox and Liverpool FC), LeBron is playing a completely different game off the court.Stephen Curry’s current net worth is estimated at $240 million as of late 2025. While that’s a massive fortune, it shows the difference between being a superstar and being a tycoon. Steph’s wealth is climbing fast, though, thanks to his own Curry Brand, which is now independent after breaking with Under Armour and his Unanimous Media production house. At the end of the day, whether you prefer the King’s power or the Chef’s range, both are proving that the modern athlete is just as much a CEO as they are a point guard.Also read: ""“We emptied the cups”: LeBron James and Bronny James get candid on LA Lakers’ Spill The Tea","LeBron James and Stephen Curry are the Mount Rushmore of modern NBA.

How the game changes without Jokic





when the Denver Nuggets face the Cleveland Cavaliers on January 2, 2026. Denver has ruled out its starting center as he continues to recover from a left knee hyperextension, an injury the team expects will keep him out for at least four weeks.This game was expected to be one of the more notable matchups of the week. Instead, it arrives with Denver missing much of its regular rotation and focused on getting through the night without further issues. The Nuggets are deep into an Eastern Conference road trip and are clearly thinking beyond a single January game.The Denver Nuggets confirmed earlier in the day that Nikola Jokic will not suit up in Cleveland. His absence is part of a planned recovery process, not a late decision or short-term rest.The game tips off at 7:30 p.m. ET at Rocket Arena, which means fans in India will be watching early on January 3. There has been no indication from the team that a return was ever on the table for this matchup.Nikola Jokic suffered a hyperextension of his left knee earlier in the week, with additional concern around a bone bruise. Denver has already outlined a recovery window of more than four weeks, with a re-evaluation expected in about a month.Before the injury, he was averaging 29.6 points, 12.2 rebounds, and 11 assists per game.

Inside story of why Shubman Gill was DROPPED from India T20I World Cup squad





Just like Virat Kohli ’s recent domestic matches, Indian ODI and Test captain Shubman Gill ’s upcoming Vijay Hazare Trophy game will also be played without fans in the stands. It will be Gill's first domestic game since being dropped from India's T20 World Cup squad.Gill will turn out for Punjab against Sikkim on Saturday at the Jaipuria College ground, but no general public will be allowed to watch the match from inside the venue.The decision has been taken following BCCI guidelines.According to the board’s instructions, both Shubman Gill and India pacer Arshdeep Singh will feature in Punjab’s next two Vijay Hazare Trophy matches.Punjab will face Sikkim on January 3 and Goa on January 6.While the match against Goa will be played at the KL Saini Stadium, the Sikkim game has been scheduled at the Jaipuria College ground.Due to security concerns and the absence of proper seating arrangements for spectators, the match will be held behind closed doors.A BCCI source explained that only people associated with the college will be allowed entry.""The students and staff are allowed inside the premises but there will be enough security arrangements including private bouncers being deployed. In any case, no outsiders will be allowed inside the college premises,"" the source told PTI.""The scheduling was done much earlier. Only because of Rohit Sharma and anticipating the response, Mumbai's match had to be shifted to Sawai Man Singh Stadium from Anantam,"" the source added.Like the Vijay Hazare Trophy games featuring Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, Gill’s match will also not be available for fans to watch on television or online.There will be no live broadcast or live streaming of the game.Shubman Gill and Arshdeep Singh are expected to reach the venue late on Friday night.Their travel plans were affected due to poor weather conditions in north India.""Both Gill and Arshdeep were supposed to arrive by evening but prevailing weather condition in North India has led to delay of their flights. Weather permitting, they will arrive by late night,"" the source said.With fans unable to attend or watch the match live, Gill’s appearance for Punjab will remain a low-key affair.However, the game will still be important for Punjab as they continue their Vijay Hazare Trophy campaign with two key international players returning to domestic cricket.",Shubman Gill to play for Punjab against Sikkim in Vijay Hazare Trophy.

Jaipur: After a difficult few weeks — first dealing with an injury setback and then the disappointment of being dropped from India’s T20 World Cup squad — Shubman Gill will get a chance to rediscover his white-ball rhythm when the India’s Test and ODI skipper turns out for Punjab against Sikkim in the fifth round of the Vijay Hazare Trophy on Saturday.Much to the disappointment of Gill fans, the match will be played behind closed doors at the Jaipuria Vidyalaya ground, which doesn’t have the seating capacity of the Sawai Mansingh Stadium, where around 20,000 spectators enjoyed Rohit Sharma ’s ton last week.Gill, who will miss his Punjab opening partner Abhishek Sharma — the dashing southpaw returned home following the first two games — will look to make the most of these two Vijay Hazare matches to put the recent disappointment behind him.

Why Mohammed Shami needs to return in India colours before World Cup





New Delhi: The current Indian team management’s go-to word has been ‘flexibility’. Now, it remains to be seen whether the selectors continue to experiment or opt for continuity. At the centre of this debate is Rishabh Pant By standard team-building logic, Pant’s place in the 15-member squad shouldn’t be in doubt. He has warmed the bench as KL Rahul ’s backup wicketkeeper for the last 18 months. Since coming back from a car accident, he has played only one ODI — on a rank turner in Sri Lanka in Aug 2024. Before the accident, Pant averaged over 41 with a strike rate close to 110 while batting at No. 4. Much has changed since. Gautam Gambhir has consolidated his influence as head coach. Rohit Sharma has been replaced by Shubman Gill as captain. ‘Flexibility’ and an aversion to superstar culture have become core principles of selection.Three ODIs against New Zealand may not seem significant. But India will play only 20 or so ODIs before the 2027 World Cup. “The team management and selection committee did a good job when they started the transition process. But constant chopping and changing doesn’t help stability. If Pant has been your No. 2 wicketkeeper and is dropped without playing, you are challenging your own selection process. There needs to be consistency in selection, otherwise it doesn’t send a good signal to players coming up the ranks,” former national selector Devang Gandhi told TOI.It is understood that the selectors wanted to rotate Pant and Rahul as wicketkeepers in the six home ODIs this season. However, the continued reluctance to play Pant suggests a lack of trust in his abilities. Similar situations have played out in Test cricket with Shardul Thakur and Nitish Kumar Reddy, when the management and captain did not appear to be on the same page.“My only fear is a repeat of 2019, when you didn’t prepare backups in the middle order. Pant can still serve for another seven to eight years. If they feel they can maximise his potential, they must start working with him. He has been part of the system since 2018. If not, they must identify a definite second wicketkeeper — and not keep changing without giving the player a full run, because there aren’t many ODIs before the World Cup,” former India wicketkeeper and broadcaster Deep Dasgupta said.Pant hasn’t set the stage on fire in the Vijay Hazare Trophy on sticky Bengaluru pitches. “I won’t judge him by the runs. He hasn’t played the 50-over format for nearly three-and-a-half years. Before his accident, he had started finding his feet in ODIs. It’s about how much you want to back him,” Dasgupta added.",Rishabh Pant has warmed the bench as KL Rahul’s backup wicketkeeper for the last 18 months.

Year Total Runs (T20s) Average Runs per Team 2025 4,62,258 295.37 2024 4,74,631 285.40 2023 3,49,643 288.00 2022 3,86,865 280.54 2021 3,49,170 281.81 2020 1,80,197 296.86

Poll Do you believe that the rise in T20 scores is improving the excitement of the game? Absolutely! It's thrilling. Somewhat. It depends on the match. Not really. I prefer lower scores. I have no opinion on this.





The number of runs cricketers score in the T20 cricket continues to climb each year since the turn of the decade. In 2025, 4,62,258 runs were scored across the world in game's shortest format. On an average, each team scored 295.37 runs per match.Punjab scored 310 against Bengal in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy with Abhishek Sharma scoring a 52-ball 148. At the international level, England walloped South Africa by scoring 304 runs, thanks to Phil Salt's unbeaten 60-ball 141 and Jos Buttler's 30-ball 83.Big scores remain the central objective for everyone involved - curators with batting-friendly pitches; lawmakers allowing broader bats and organisers promising run fest to bring fans to the stadiums or keep them hooked to the TV.The average score in the T20 format in the past five years reads: 281.81 (2021), 280.54 (2022), 288.00 (2023), 285.40 (2024) and 295.37 (2025). The year the first T20I was played (2005), the average was 275.19.Given the adulation they get, does that make a batter more attractive to the next generation of cricketers? Former West Indies speedster Ian Bishop doesn't think so.""I don't think everybody wants to be a batter. I still think there is room in the game for those who want to bowl fast, those who want to bowl wrist spin, those who want to bowl finger spin,"" said Bishop, who is a commentator in the ongoing ILT20.""Historically, and we go back to the inception of the game, batters have always been seen as the heroes and bowlers the villains. Even when I was playing that was always the battle,"" he continued to explain with a smile.""I do think you are absolutely right in the respect that the game kind of has drifted more and more in favour of the batters but I still think guys want to come through. And bowlers are an adaptable species. The more the game changes, the more bowlers will come up with plans to counter it. That has always been the ebb and flow of cricket generally - red ball or white ball or T20.""As administrators though, what I will agree with you on is that we have to do a better job of creating a better balance between bat and ball even in T20 cricket,"" he reasoned.This isn't the only radical change he wants to make to the modern game. The 58-year-old, who played 43 Test matches for the Windies, is a strong advocate for four-day Test matches.""I have long been in favour of 4-day Test cricket. This is especially true if you are going to have a World Test Championship (WTC) where results are imperative, necessitating pitches that yield results.""But the arguments against it from others is (about) weather impacting games and then there is no coming back. But if you ask me, I have long said publicly, I am a 4-day Test cricket fan.Here’s a rewritten version with the same meaning, but refreshed wording:The ICC had approved four-day Tests for bilateral series in 2017, with England facing Zimbabwe over four days at Trent Bridge last year, following four-day Tests against Ireland in 2019 and 2023. Four-day Tests have as yet not been played under the World Test Championship (WTC) format.Many smaller nations are hesitant to host Tests because of the time they require and the cost. However, shifting to four-day cricket could allow a full three-Test series to be completed in under three weeks. In four-day Tests, playing hours are extended to ensure a minimum of 98 overs per day (instead of 90) to help offset the time lost.","Former West Indies speedster Ian Bishop is a strong advocate for four-day Test matches.

Kawhi Leonard’s contract breakdown



How Kawhi Leonard's contract hit Clippers’ bench







After a spectacular season with Toronto Raptors in 2018-19, Kawhi Leonard decided to move closer to his house and signed with the LA Clippers. To make a championship worthy team, Leonard put forward the condition of acquiring another star player before signing, and the Clippers fulfilled it by getting Paul George in a blockbuster deal.With the league’s expansion, all eyes are always scanning the crowd for the next big trade, but Kawhi and the Clippers front office quietly handled their business back in early 2024 with a three-year, $149.5 million veteran extension. For all those die-hard fans of Leonard, this was a statement: Kawhi isn't going anywhere, and Steve Ballmer is more than willing to pay for that elite talent.Kawhi Leonard was drafted 15th overall by the Indiana Pacers in 2011 but was immediately traded to the San Antonio Spurs where he stayed till 2017-28 season. After joining the Raptors over a 1-year deal worth $23 million for 2018-19 season, Kawhi led the franchise to its first ever NBA championship and won his second Finals MVP.Since joining Clippers in 2019 on a 3-year $103 million contract that was active till 2021, the management and Leonardo decided to sign another maximum extension worth $176 million that would keep the latter in the team through 2024 season.On January 14 2024, Clippers via a social media post announced that they have signed another contract extension with Kawhi Leonard.It is a 3-year contract worth $149.5 million keeping Leonardo with the Clipper through the 2027 season.Through this deal, Leonard is guaranteed to earn $149.5 million with an average annual salary of $49 million in 2024. For the 2025-26 season, he will earn $50 million and $50.3 million for 2026-27. By the time the 2026-27 season wraps up, his career on-court earnings will cross past the $425 million mark becoming one of the highest on-court earners in NBA.From a front-office perspective, Kawhi’s contract is a massive anchor on the salary cap. Carrying a $50 million cap hit for each of the next two seasons means the Clippers are essentially living in the luxury tax. Because he signed for slightly below his absolute maximum, it gave the team just enough breathing room to keep guys like James Harden around, but let’s be real, the NBA’s CBA is always breathing down everyone’s necks.There’s no player option on the back end of this deal, meaning Kawhi is committed through 2027. For the fans, that’s the best part. They don't have to worry about ""opt-out"" rumors every summer. All they hope is that Kawhi Leonard stays healthy and fit and continues to perform dominantly on the court.Also read: Here are the 5 tallest players in today’s NBA: Victor Wembanyama, Zach Edey, and more","Kawhi Leonard signed a three-year, $149.5 million veteran extension with the LA Clippers.

Professional volleyball player for a Mom and NFL quarterback for a Dad…this kid’s going to be an athlete for sure: a Green Bay Packers fan page on Instagram commented on Jordan Love and wife Ronica Stone Love’s collaborative pregnancy announcement. They captioned it: “New year, new addition,” and shared seven wholesome snapshots. The couple reportedly chose their home as the backdrop for their classic denim-and-white maternity photoshoot.The first image shows the two in matching white t-shirts and sky-blue denim jeans. Ronika reportedly chose a no-makeup look because a common pregnancy sign, “linea nigra,” was visible on her tummy. This harmless dark vertical line on the abdomen during pregnancy is caused by increased melanin production from hormonal changes. The “pregnancy line” fades after childbirth. What were the other snapshots shared by the expectant couple? Let’s check them out one by one.The first image shared by The Love Couple featured six slideshows of their baby’s sonogram. The second image shows a monochrome silhouette of the two facing each other, with Jordan landing a warm peck on Ronika’s forehead. The backdrop stands out in the second snapshot: a large transparent arched window reveals a dense forest of bare trees and snow-covered ground, perfectly depicting winter.The third image shows Ronika on Jordan’s lap, his hands gently encircling her tummy. Ronika tenderly holds Jordan’s hand while looking at her tummy with fondness. Brownie points for how their wedding rings also encircle the baby.The fourth image shows the pregnant couple, standing before the same large, transparent arched window. Ronika stands in front of Jordan in the monochrome photo, looking back at him with her brightest smile. Jordan looks at her with boundless love. Both hold the tummy tenderly.The fifth image features Jordan’s back profile with Ronika standing in front of him. They look into each other’s eyes. The highlight: Ronika holds a cream-colored knitted baby romper with ruffle details around its legs. The romper has “BABY Love SPRING 2026” knitted in lavender pink.The sixth image shows Ronika comfortably seated on a beige couch while Jordan takes her photo on his smartphone. The image focuses on Ronika and blurs the Green Bay quarterback.The last image shows Ronika, her face obscured, focusing on a tiny jersey she holds. The jersey reads “LOVE” with the number “10,” which is Jordan Love’s Green Bay Packers number.“My dad [Orbin Jr.] wore number 10 when he was in high school,” Jordan told Ryan Wood of Green Bay Press-Gazette in September 2024. “That was a tribute to him. When I was younger, I started wearing 10. I think, like sixth grade, seventh grade, I started wearing 10, and it kind of just stuck with me.

What could this injury mean for Victor Wembanyama and San Antonio Spurs?





The San Antonio Spurs star, Victor Wembanyama, has had the blast of a season this time, and his scores have reflected and speak volumes. But injuries are a must when it comes to playing basketball, and it caught Wembanyama in the previous game against the New York Knicks. He is now suffering from what seems to be a left knee hyperextension, and his return is expected in the next game, which is scheduled tonight, against the Indiana Pacers.While sources revealed that Wembanyama’s injury is nothing serious, his return is highly expected at tonight’s match. The San Antonio Spurs made it through the previous matchup in a hard-earned 134-132 victory. However, this time, due to Wembanyama’s injury, things are going to get pretty rough. Here is everything you need to know about the Spurs star’s latest injury report and what this could mean for the Texas franchise.The 2025 NBA All-Star, Victor Wembanyama, is injured, and his return in tonight’s game is uncertain. He has a left knee hyperextension, which was later revealed by NBA sources. While Wembanyama is confident about his return in tonight’s clash against the Indiana Pacers, his comeback has created all sorts of uncertainties in the minds of fans and the media.The San Antonio Spurs just began to gain momentum in the 2025-2026 season and weren’t at all expecting their star player, Wembanyama’s injury, which too before the year's end. However, fate had something else written for the Texas franchise and their favorite player. Despite the team’s narrow and hard-earned victory in the previous match, Wembanyama wasn’t a part of it.Wembanyama had just started the season with mind-blowing scores. He has averaged 24 points, 11.7 rebounds, and 3.5 assists per game during the season of 2025-2026. Apart from this, his career high score stands at 50 points, which he scored back in 2024 against the Washington Wizards. He has also set career highs with 8 three-pointers, thereby becoming the fourth youngest player in the history of the big league.However, with his recent injury, the Spurs’ fate for tonight’s victory remains uncertain. Now, say, even if Wembanyama returns, will he be able to play with his full potential strength? Unfortunately, the answer remains unknown. As fans anticipate Wembanyama’s return, he has to live up to the expectations of his teammates and his fans.Also read: Here are the 5 tallest players in today’s NBA: Victor Wembanyama, Zach Edey, and more","Victory Wembanyama developed left knee hyperextension during Spurs vs Kicks matchup.

When the Florida Panthers entered this season, many expected them to become the first team in four decades to three-peat the Stanley Cup. With back-to-back championships and a roster full of all-stars, things looked smooth for the Panthers.But their form this season has left a lot to be desired. With captain and key defenseman Aleksander Barkov out of action, their defense has been incredibly vulnerable. To secure a playoff spot, changes are necessary. One insider believes that the answer to that might be in making a trade.Justin Faulk from the St. Louis Blues is the target. The 33-year-old right-shot defenseman carries a $6.5 million cap hit this season and represents the kind of aggressive move that could push Florida over the top in its championship pursuit.According to Chris Johnston of The Athletic, the Panthers are eyeing the NHL's March trade deadline. Faulk has been increasingly competent this season. Johnston is proposing what he calls a home run swing deal that would bring a veteran defenseman to South Florida.Johnston makes the case that Florida needs to strengthen the right side of their defense. Jeff Petry is currently playing third-pair minutes behind Seth Jones and Aaron Ekblad, and the Panthers should be looking for an upgrade in that area.Faulk would represent more than just a minor improvement. Johnston describes the potential acquisition as a home run swing rather than a simple roster tweak, noting that no team should be more motivated to go big than the Panthers, given their championship aspirations.""Chasing Faulk would represent a home-run swing rather than a mere upgrade, and who could be more incentivized to go big than the Panthers?"" Johnston wrote. With more than 1,000 NHL games under his belt, Faulk would bring both veteran presence and reliability to the Panthers.Florida, meanwhile, offers him the first real chance to compete for the Stanley Cup. Johnston believes Florida general manager Bill Zito won't shy away from making the aggressive move required to land Faulk. Zito has a history of bold decisions and understands what it takes to build championship rosters.""Florida GM Bill Zito has never shied away from an aggressive move, and he'll be trying to arm his team with the horses needed to win a third straight Stanley Cup,"" Johnston explained. Only the greatest teams in NHL history have won three consecutive championships.The challenge becomes exponentially harder with each title, as opponents adjust and roster construction becomes more difficult under the salary cap. Florida can't afford to be complacent.A trade for Faulk would send a clear message that the Panthers are all-in on making history and won't settle for anything less than another championship.",The Florida Panthers are looking to strengthen their defence. Justin Faulk from the St. Louis Blues is the target. The 33-year-old right-shot defenseman carries a $6.5 million cap hit this season. The Athletic's Chris Johnston describes the potential acquisition as a home run swing.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126309944,imgsize-77712,width-400,resizemode-4/florida-panthers.jpg"
Will Sauce Gardner play in Week 18 against the Texans? Colts' CB injury update,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/will-sauce-gardner-play-in-week-18-against-the-texans-colts-cb-injury-update/articleshow/126312662.cms,"Sauce Gardner (X/Colts)

Colts officially rule out Sauce Gardner due to lingering calf injury





The Indianapolis Colts will be without one of their defensive backs in the final week of the regular season. Cornerback Sauce Gardner has officially been ruled out after dealing with a calf injury, according to the team’s latest injury report. With Week 18 approaching fast, the decision shuts the door on any last-minute return and leaves Indianapolis short-handed in the secondary as they prepare for their final game.The Colts confirmed that Sauce Gardner will not play this week after failing to recover from a calf issue that has limited him recently. Gardner was unable to practice leading up to the game, which ultimately led to the team ruling him out entirely.The injury has clearly been enough of a concern for Indianapolis to take a cautious approach. Rather than risking further aggravation, the Colts opted to keep Gardner sidelined, signaling that he was never truly close to returning for Week 18.Gardner being ruled out creates another challenge for a Colts defense that has already dealt with inconsistency throughout the season. With one less cornerback available, Indianapolis will need to rely more heavily on depth players to handle coverage responsibilities.Against a Texans offense that can stretch the field, losing a defensive back only adds pressure to the rest of the unit. The Colts will have to adjust their rotations and coverage schemes without Gardner in the lineup, especially on the outside.Gardner’s calf injury surfaced over the past few weeks and continued to limit him as the season progressed. While the team did not provide a detailed timeline, his lack of participation in practice made his Week 18 availability unlikely from the start.With the regular season nearing its end, the Colts’ decision suggests a longer-term mindset rather than pushing through a late-season injury. There was no indication of a setback during the week simply that Gardner was not healthy enough to go.With Gardner officially ruled out for Week 18, attention now turns to his recovery moving forward. The Colts have not announced a timetable for his return, and his status will likely be reevaluated once the season concludes.Also read - Jerry Jones gives sarcastic response to Micah Parsons after he claimed his name was slandered","Colts officially rule out Sauce Gardner due to lingering calf injury.

Jerry Jones addresses Micah Parsons comments during 105.3 The Fan appearance

“slandering my name to Cowboys media and national media for months.”

“I wish Micah the very best,”

“I’d love to have Micah on the team. But we just couldn’t afford him. We wanted four to five players more than we did him. But he’s outstanding. I understand his sensitivity and can even understand these comments.”





The Micah Parsons breakup with the Dallas Cowboys just got a lot more personal and a lot more public. What started as a contract dispute has now turned into a full-blown war of words, with Parsons accusing team owner Jerry Jones of slandering his name and Jones responding live on Dallas radio. Instead of quietly moving on, both sides are now fighting over the story of why this relationship fell apart. And Jerry’s explanation? It’s already setting fans on fire.Micah Parsons didn’t hold back when he took to social media and accused Jerry Jones ofThe post immediately went viral, with fans reading it as a clear sign that the split between Parsons and Dallas wasn’t just about money, it was about respect.For many supporters, the accusation hit hard. Parsons wasn’t a role player. He was the face of the Cowboys defense, a game-changing star who consistently delivered. Seeing him suggest that the organization was quietly damaging his reputation added an emotional layer to an already messy exit.Jerry Jones finally responded during an appearance on 105.3 The Fan, and his comments quickly made headlines.Jones said.On the surface, Jones sounded calm and respectful. He praised Parsons’ talent and claimed to understand his emotions. But the explanation that Dallas preferred roster depth over keeping Micah was exactly what reignited the controversy.This is where things got complicated. By saying the Cowboys wanted “four to five players more” than Parsons, Jones framed the decision as purely strategic. But to many fans and possibly Micah himself that wording felt like more than a cap discussion.It wasn’t just “we couldn’t make the numbers work.” It sounded like the team valued others more than their defensive superstar. That subtle difference is why so many believe Jones’ comments actually support Micah’s claim instead of clearing the air.At this point, the relationship looks beyond repair. Jerry Jones believes he explained the business side. Micah Parsons believes his reputation was dragged on the way out. And neither side seems interested in backing down.Also read - Viral NYE video shows Tom Brady and Alix Earle getting cozy together, sparks dating rumors and age-gap chatter","The Micah Parsons breakup with the Dallas Cowboys just got a lot more personal.
