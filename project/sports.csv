Inside Tommy Fleetwood’s net worth and love story with wife who once rejected him,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/inside-tommy-fleetwoods-net-worth-and-love-story-with-wife-who-once-rejected-him/articleshow/123489726.cms,"Tommy and Clare Fleetwood (Image Source: Getty)

Clare initially turned down Tommy Fleetwood before love story started

Clare Fleetwood ’s support during heartbreaking near-misses

Tommy Fleetwood is one of the top-paid golfers in the world as of August 2025. On the PGA Tour itself, he has won more than $31 million in prize money. This statistic makes him one of the biggest-money winners in the history of the DP World Tour, with a career earnings total of around $35 million.Other sources of income have also bolstered Fleetwood, but still has yet to nab a win on the PGA Tour. In addition, he has taken home sponsorship deals with Nike, TaylorMade, and TAG Heuer, benefitting from a significant amount of millions as a result of golf's former Player Impact Program.Fleetwood met his wife, Clare, in 2015, which further blended his personal and professional lives. Clare was then a sports management executive when she became Tommy's client. Their work was the beginning of what would soon become a deeper relationship, despite their 23-year age difference, and after the controversies from the media.Clare explained how she initially turned down Tommy when he first asked her out because the age gap made her feel cautious. But after further thought, she succumbed, and the couple entered a relationship that shocked the golf world.The pair had concerns about whether mixing business with romance would work, but agreed to give it six months to see how it went.So when they did, they were surprised to find that the two arrangements reinforced each other, professionally and personally. Clare, who maintains a cool and calm approach, has regularly been acknowledged as a reason Tommy stays composed and relaxed in stressful situations on the course.Apart from materialistic dividends, there have been some massive emotional ups and downs in Fleetwood’s professional career. Clare has remained his rock through his lowest lows, which include several painful near misses on the PGA Tour.None was more heartbreaking than the one he endured at the Travelers Championship as Tommy once again finished in second place, this time the victim of a late charge by Keegan Bradley to come up one stroke short of the winner. Enticing words like these have shaped his career narrative to date, so near, but not close enough to cement that first PGA Tour title.Going into the last 18 holes of the Tour Championship, Fleetwood was quoted as a fan's favourite, and Clare was back to have his back as always. Friends of the couple say Clare has been a great support to Tommy in dealing with the pressure, and his two losses have only made him more determined and focused towards the future.Also Read: Who is golfer Tommy Fleetwood’s wife Clare?

The final drive with Walter Gretzky that meant more than the farewell ovation

Lessons from Walter Gretzky that shaped a hockey icon

Wayne Gretzky’s last NHL appearance on April 18, 1999, at Madison Square Garden is remembered as a celebration of the “Great One’s” extraordinary career. Yet, for Gretzky, the moment wasn’t only about the sold-out crowd, the ovations, or the history—it was about a quiet car ride with his father, Walter Gretzky.On the 25th anniversary of his retirement, Wayne Gretzky reflected on why he asked Walter to drive him to Madison Square Garden that night. “For my final game, I decided that since my dad drove me to the first game I ever went to, it would be great to drive my dad to my last game,” he told NHL.com.That ride, however, was far from ordinary. Gretzky admitted, “The ride was good, but it was kind of awful in the same sense because every three minutes, he kept hitting my leg and telling me that I could play one more year. I said, ‘No, dad, I’m done.’”While the NHL and fans worldwide treated the day as a fitting farewell to the greatest player in hockey history, Gretzky cherished that personal moment most. To him, it was the perfect full-circle memory, blending his first steps in hockey with the end of his iconic journey.Walter Gretzky was more than just a supportive parent—he was the guiding force behind Wayne’s rise. When officials tried to block young Wayne from moving to Toronto in 1974, Walter stood firm, saying, “No, they can't tell me where to send my own boy… If he will be happy elsewhere, we decide between the family.”Also Read: What is the Wayne Gretzky Rule and how it changed the modern NHL forever Walter’s philosophy of family first left a lifelong mark on Wayne, who carried those values into his career and personal life. Though Walter passed away in 2021, his wisdom continues to influence Gretzky, reminding fans that behind the hockey legend was always a devoted son.","Wayne Gretzky's last NHL appearance on April 18, 1999, at Madison Square Garden is remembered as a celebration of the “Great One’s” extraordinary career.

Raleigh blasts into Mariners record books with 50th home run

Switch-hitting sensation joins MLB legends

Smashing catcher records and breaking boundaries

Eyes on the future: Legacy in the making



Cal Raleigh of the Seattle Mariners has etched his name into baseball lore, blasting his 50th home run of the 2025 MLB season. With this historic milestone, Raleigh becomes only the second switch-hitter in MLB history to reach 50 homers in a single season, joining Mickey Mantle, and just the second Mariners player to hit 50+ homers after Ken Griffey Jr. Fans and analysts are already hailing Raleigh’s season as one of the most electrifying campaigns in recent memory, with every swing carrying a mix of power, precision, and history-making potential.Raleigh’s 50th homer solidifies him as a transformative force in Mariners history. Ken Griffey Jr. remains the franchise benchmark with his 50+ home runs in 1997 and 1998, but Raleigh now shares that elite spotlight. At 28 years old, Raleigh’s combination of patience, timing, and raw power has energized Seattle’s lineup, making him the player every pitcher fears.What makes Raleigh’s milestone truly rare is his status as a switch-hitter. Only Hall of Famer Mickey Mantle previously reached 50+ home runs from both sides of the plate, accomplishing it in 1956 and 1961. Raleigh’s ability to dominate from both left and right sides underscores his adaptability and elite skill, showing that modern hitters can redefine what’s possible.Raleigh isn’t just a slugger; he’s rewriting catcher history as well. Salvador Perez held the previous single-season home run record for a primary catcher with 48 in 2021. Raleigh surpassed that mark before reaching 50, becoming the first catcher ever to hit 50 homers in a season. On top of that, he’s the first player in modern MLB to hit at least 20 homers from both sides of the plate in a single campaign, adding another layer to his already historic season.With roughly a month left in the regular season, Raleigh has a real shot to break Griffey’s franchise record and approach Mantle’s legendary totals. Fans have flooded stadiums and social media, celebrating each clutch swing, while analysts praise his poise under pressure. “He’s not just hitting home runs; he’s shaping a legacy,” said one commentator. Raleigh’s 2025 season isn’t just a series of stats—it’s a story of determination, skill, and history in the making.Also read: Samuel Basallo agrees to massive eight-year $67 million extension with Baltimore Orioles after MLB debut",Cal Raleigh becomes only the second switch-hitter in MLB history to reach 50 homers in a single season.

Kansas City Chiefs’ 53-man roster: Robert Tonyan, Gardner Minshew among notables

Trades, waivers, and surprise cuts: Eagles, Bears, Cowboys make key moves

NFL teams are racing against the clock to finalize their 53-man rosters ahead of Tuesday’s 4 p.m. ET deadline. With the preseason officially wrapped, teams like the Kansas City Chiefs, Philadelphia Eagles, and Chicago Bears have already started making major moves, trades, waivers, and tough releases, as they trim down from 90 players.Rosters must be reduced to 53 by Aug. 26, with practice squads to follow by Wednesday. Players with fewer than four accrued seasons will be subject to the waiver wire, while veterans are released outright and hit free agency. Teams can also use tools like injured reserve, reserve/PUP, and NFI lists to meet cut requirements without outright dropping players.Here’s what you need to know about key cuts, trades, and projected rosters from the NFL’s biggest names before the transaction window closes.Kansas City is expected to field one of the most stable rosters in the league, but even so, familiar names could be on the outside looking in. The Chiefs will likely carry two quarterbacks: Patrick Mahomes and Gardner Minshew, with Chris Oladokun set for the practice squad.Running back Isiah Pacheco is healthy and back in RB1 shape, while rookie Brashard Smith earned first-team snaps in the preseason finale and could leapfrog into a secure role.Veterans like Elijah Mitchell may not survive the cut.Among wide receivers, Rashee Rice, Hollywood Brown, and rookie Xavier Worthy headline a crowded group. JuJu Smith-Schuster and Tyquan Thornton are projected to stick, while Jalen Royals and Nikko Remigio are battling injuries and special teams roles.Tight end Robert Tonyan led the team in preseason receiving yards (90), making a strong case for a roster spot behind Travis Kelce and Noah Gray. Jared Wiley may hit injured reserve, depending on his knee recovery.On defense, Chris Jones anchors the interior line, with veteran Derrick Nnadi rejoining the team after a short stint with the Jets. Felix Anudike-Uzomah, a first-round pick in 2023, is out for the year with a hamstring injury, opening space for Malik Herring or a potential waiver addition.Linebacker Cooper McDonald, a rookie tryout, has pushed into contention after impressing in camp. In the secondary, the absence of Joshua Williams from key reps suggests he could be cut, while Chris Roland-Wallace and Nazeeh Johnson look secure.The Philadelphia Eagles made headlines on Sunday by completing three trades, starting with acquiring quarterback Sam Howell from the Minnesota Vikings. As per ESPN’s Adam Schefter, the Eagles also sent Darian Kinnard to Green Bay and brought back offensive tackle Fred Johnson from Jacksonville.In Cleveland, Shedeur Sanders remains buried on the depth chart and has seen four offensive linemen from his unit waived, including Javion Cohen and Sebastian Gutierrez, as per the Browns' official website.Shilo Sanders was waived by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers following an ejection for punching Bills tight end Zach Davidson in a preseason matchup. The altercation likely sealed his fate, despite flashes of promise earlier in camp.The Chicago Bears are also deep into cut territory. Offensive lineman Kiran Amegadjie, a former third-round pick, appears to have been leapfrogged on the depth chart by rookie Theo Benedet. Running backs Brittain Brown and Ian Wheeler were productive in the preseason but are expected to miss the 53 due to depth and special teams priorities.Wide receiver Maurice Alexander showed solid preseason numbers but may be edged out by undrafted rookie Jahdae Walker. Veteran Devin Duvernay is expected to secure a roster spot as a return specialist.In New England, pass-rusher Anfernee Jennings is viewed as a likely trade candidate. As per ESPN’s Bill Barnwell, “Jennings is a stout run defender on the edge… I like him as a fit in Detroit.” The Patriots have already cut 15 players, including Micah Bernard, Monty Rice, Jaheim Bell, and Sidy Sow.The Jacksonville Jaguars, currently fifth in waiver priority, traded Fred Johnson to Philadelphia and now hold 12 picks in the 2026 NFL Draft. Rookie Wyatt Milum and swing tackle Cole Van Lanen remain injury questions heading into final cuts.","NFL teams are racing against the clock to finalize their 53-man rosters ahead of Tuesday’s 4 p.m. ET deadline.

Magic Johnson reacts after Washington Commanders confirm Terry McLaurin deal

Terry McLaurin signs extension after tense Washington Commanders offseason

Also Read:

The city of Washington is buzzing with sports excitement once again. A huge development has brought new energy to the NFL team and sparked celebrations among fans. What makes the moment even more special is the reaction of NBA legend Magic Johnson, now a proud co-owner of the Washington Commanders. His words, shared on social media, turned a routine announcement into a headline moment that no one wanted to miss.On Monday, August 26, NBA legend Earvin “Magic” Johnson, now 66 years old, went public with his reaction after the Washington Commanders made a headline announcement. Johnson, who became a co-owner of the Commanders in 2023, took to his official X account to share his thoughts.He wrote: “I’m thrilled that we re-signed Terry McLaurin! Job well done by my partner Josh Harris and GM Adam Peters. This is great news for Commander players, our organization and all Commander fans! Terry is more than just a great football player; he is an outstanding leader and does tremendous things in the DMV community.”The message came just hours after ESPN’s Adam Schefter confirmed that the Commanders had reached a deal with star wide receiver Terry McLaurin. The three-year extension, worth up to $96 million, put an end to weeks of uncertainty around the player’s future.Fans quickly pointed out a slip in Johnson’s wording, noting that “re-signed” appeared as “resigned.” The playful confusion spread across social media, but the core message remained clear - Johnson was proud of the move and thrilled for the team.The deal itself was confirmed earlier on August 26, when Terry McLaurin’s agents, Buddy Baker and Tony Bonagura, finalized the extension. McLaurin, who had been holding out during training camp, finally ended his standoff with the front office just days before the Commanders face the New York Giants in their Week 1 game.The 28-year-old wideout admitted in July that the long wait had taken a toll. Speaking at the time, he said:“I’ve been pretty frustrated, not gonna lie. Everything that has transpired up until this point has been disappointing and frustrating. I want to continue my career here, I’ve created my life here, my wife and I have bought our first home here, so this is somewhere I’ve always wanted to be.”Pushing into the NFC Championship Game for the first time in over 30 years, he had 82 receptions for 1,096 yards and 13 touchdowns in 2023: the highest single-season performance of his career.This only gives more energy for both the Commanders and McLaurin to go forward. For Johnson, who has already invested in multiple sports teams across Los Angeles, this moment showed how strongly he values building a winning culture in Washington.","Washington Commanders announce Terry McLaurin has signed a three-year deal worth up to $96 million.

“Being in a position to get cut 7x is an honorable accomplishment. Hope the next one sticks! 🍻”

NFL fans show support for Ben DiNucci after his hilarious airport beer post about 7 cuts

Ben DiNucci’s rollercoaster NFL career

Life in the NFL isn’t always Super Bowls and champagne. For some players, it’s fighting for a roster spot year after year. That’s been the case for quarterback Ben DiNucci, who has now been released by NFL teams seven different times. Instead of sulking, DiNucci turned the moment into a viral one, raising a glass of beer at an airport and posting about it. The internet, surprisingly, loved every second of it.After his latest release by the Atlanta Falcons, Ben DiNucci didn’t post a long statement or a sad goodbye. Instead, he kept it short and humorous, calling it an “airport beer” kind of day. That simple line, paired with a photo of him with a drink, exploded online. For fans, it was refreshing to see an athlete handle such a tough setback with humor instead of heartbreak.Once the post hit X (formerly Twitter), fans rallied around Ben DiNucci with the perfect mix of jokes and genuine support. Some praised his resilience, saying being cut seven times is still proof of a long NFL career. Others joked about how relatable an “airport beer” feels when life knocks you down. One fan even flipped it into motivation, saying,Ben DiNucci’s story has always been about persistence. Drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in 2020, he went from backup to starting quarterback in just his first season, even posting a 1–0 record in his lone start.Since then, he’s bounced around the league with stops at the Denver Broncos, Buffalo Bills, New Orleans Saints, and most recently, the Atlanta Falcons.Across his career, Ben DiNucci has started 3 games and thrown for 219 yards.

Anthony Edwards China tour marks a new chapter in his off court success story

Minnesota Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards isn't one to hold back on making bold claims, and his recent statement during a promotional tour in China has basketball fans talking. The 24-year-old guard went on social media to confidently say that he would dunk on Chinese basketball icon Yao Ming, the 7-foot-6 Hall of Famer who ruled the NBA with the Houston Rockets from 2002 to 2011.The statement was posted directly by Edwards on Instagram Threads, where he shared a picture of his meeting with Yao and captioned it, ""I wud dunk on Yao shout out to one of da greats."".This isn't the first time Edwards has shown off his bold confidence in his dunking skills. In a past Instagram reel, when someone asked him if he ever felt guilty about dunking on his opponents, Edwards confidently responded, ""H*** no,"" before adding, ""I wish I could dunk on every f***ing body. I wanna dunk on everybody, I swear to God.""This unfiltered sentiment was expressed in a laid-back video clip, showcasing his attitude that goes beyond just regular trash talk—it's a real urge to take on and dominate anyone who stands in his way.In a similar vein, during Netflix's documentary series 'Starting 5,' Edwards opened up about his mixed emotions regarding dunking, stating, ""I don’t like to dunk at all, to be honest. Because it hurts,"" but he quickly clarified his exception: ""I like to dunk on people.""These quotes, delivered in interviews and social media, paint a picture of a player who thrives on the thrill of humiliating defenders, even if it comes with physical discomfort.Beyond all the talk about dunks, this tour has been a major milestone in Edwards' expanding career beyond basketball. After being selected first overall by the Timberwolves in 2020, Edwards has evolved from a promising rookie into a three-time All-Star and an essential leader, guiding Minnesota to consecutive appearances in the Western Conference Finals. His rapid ascent has also earned him a signature shoe deal with Adidas , which is a huge opportunity for young athletes.The AE 1, his very first model, became a huge hit, and on the second day of the China tour, Edwards unveiled the AE 2 in the ""With Love"" colorway. This sneaker features sleek synthetic overlays, breathable patterned mesh, and a design that combines streetwear aesthetics with high-performance functionality.During the launch event, Eric Wise, who is the global general manager of Adidas Basketball, gave high praise to Edwards, saying, ""We know what his ceiling is. It’s pretty high, if there is one… He’s skyrocketing. He feels like a part of us.Also Read: “I’ve never looked at Klay Thompson as a role player” — Patrick Beverley explains why Paul George fits the Golden State Warriors better It doesn’t feel like a different athlete from a different brand."" This statement was made during the AE 2 reveal in China, emphasizing Edwards' smooth transition into the Adidas family. The shoe is expected to be released worldwide on October 4, 2025, with the ""With Love"" edition priced at $130.",Anthony Edwards posted a picture of his meeting with Yao Ming on Instagram Threads.

Injury Report to Watch for Tonight’s New York Liberty vs Connecticut Sun Game (August 25, 2025)

Theare heavy favorites heading into their Monday night matchup against theat Barclays Center, with sportsbooks listing them as 12 to 15-point favorites. The Liberty’s moneyline sits at -1350, while the Sun are big underdogs at +880. The total is set around 166 points. Projections lean toward a Liberty victory, with simulations giving them close to a 79 - 90% chance of winning and an expected score near 90-76.You can consider the following for tonight’s New York Liberty vs Connecticut Sun game:• Breanna Stewart Under 14.5 Points (injury concerns and defensive attention could keep her below this mark, -102 odds)• Marina Mabrey Over 2.5 Threes (a key perimeter option for the Sun, +140 value)• Jonquel Jones Over 16 Points & 10 Rebounds (interior mismatch in Liberty’s favor)New York (22-15) remains a top-five team in the WNBA despite dropping their last two games. Led by Sabrina Ionescu, Breanna Stewart, and Jonquel Jones, they’re averaging 85.8 points per game on 45.3% shooting and giving up just 81.6. Playing at home in Brooklyn only strengthens their edge.Connecticut sits at 9-27, but they’ve shown life with a three-game winning streak. Tina Charles has been a steady presence at 16.3 points and 6.0 rebounds per game, while Bria Hartley’s 23-point outburst in the last matchup provided offensive punch.Still, the Sun average just 75.7 points per game and surrender 85.3, making them vulnerable against elite opponents. Hence, in tonight’s New York Liberty vs Connecticut Sun, the latter are considered long shots.The Liberty have dominated recent matchups, winning eight of the last ten, including an 87-78 victory at Mohegan Sun Arena earlier this month. Returning home, they’ll look to continue their control over Connecticut.The Liberty’s depth could be tested with Sabrina Ionescu , Natasha Cloud, and Breanna Stewart all questionable. Nyara Sabally is out. For Connecticut, Rayah Marshall won’t play (personal reasons), and Leila Lacan is doubtful with an eye injury. These absences may open up betting opportunities in the player prop market.The New York Liberty vs Connecticut Sun matchup heavily tilts toward the Liberty, who should win comfortably if their stars are available. The Sun may keep it competitive with recent momentum, but New York’s talent, depth, and home-court advantage make them the safe bet. Bettors should look to Liberty covering the spread and key props involving Stewart, Jones, and Mabrey for value.","New York Liberty (22-15) remains a top-five team in the WNBA despite dropping their last two games.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) has parted ways with long-serving team masseur Rajeev Kumar , bringing an end to his nearly decade-long association with the national side.Kumar, a familiar face around the Indian dressing room, confirmed his exit with a heartfelt message on Instagram: “It has been a privilege and honour to serve the Indian cricket team for a decade (2006–2015). Thank you, God, for the opportunity, truly grateful and looking forward!”For players and fans alike, Kumar was more than just support staff.Always seen with his trademark smile, he became an ever-present figure at the boundary ropes during matches, ready to step in when needed.Once the day’s play was done, he was often the first person the players turned to, working tirelessly to ease stiff muscles and help them recover quickly.His duties went beyond massage therapy, he also prepared energy drinks, protein shakes, and hydration mixes, tailored to each player’s needs.His presence on the field was equally significant, as he was part of the crew stationed at the ropes to collect wayward balls, ensuring players remained fresh and over rates were kept under control.Kumar’s rapport with the seamers was particularly strong, given their physically demanding spells.His popularity reached fans too when Mohammed Shami posted a birthday photo with him and Ishant Sharma in 2019, showcasing their camaraderie. Yuzvendra Chahal once called Kumar and other staff the “unsung heroes” who helped cricketers perform at their best.Kumar’s departure comes amid a wider reshuffle in the Indian team’s support system, which has also seen Abhishek Nayar , Arun Kanade, and Soham Desai move on, while fielding coach T. Dilip briefly exited before being reinstated.With Rajeev Kumar’s exit, Indian cricket says goodbye to one of its most trusted behind-the-scenes contributors, an individual whose quiet dedication helped shape countless victories.","Rajeev Kumar has left the Indian cricket team.

When will CSK legend MS Dhoni retire from IPL? Astrologer Greenstone Lobo predicts

NEW DELHI: Cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar gave fans a special opportunity to connect with him on Monday by hosting an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session on Reddit. The former India captain invited fans to pose questions on cricket and beyond, sparking lively exchanges and nostalgic memories.Among the questions, one fan referred to Virender Sehwag ’s revelation that it was Tendulkar’s suggestion to promote MS Dhoni ahead of Yuvraj Singh in the 2011 World Cup final.Asked if this was true, Tendulkar confirmed and explained the strategy behind the move.“There were two reasons. The left-right batting combination would have upset the two off-spinners. Also, Muralitharan had played for CSK (from 2008–2010) and MS had played him for three seasons in the nets,” he said.The decision paid off handsomely as Dhoni went on to score a match-winning 91 not out, guiding India to a historic title win over Sri Lanka at a packed Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.Fans also quizzed Tendulkar on his favourite innings.While acknowledging he had played several memorable knocks, the batting maestro singled out his unbeaten 103 against England in Chennai in 2008 as the most meaningful.ALSO READ: Did Arjun Tendulkar get engaged to Saaniya Chandhok?

Poll Who do you think has the best chance of becoming the next World Chess Champion? Gukesh Dommaraju R Praggnandhaa Karthikeyan Murali Magnus Carlsen

Karthikeyan Murali (Special Arrangement)

“I just stood my ground. Magnus took some chances, and it backfired. It was a good moment for me.” Karthikeyan Murali

'Playing chess was accidental'

Karthikeyan Murali (Special Arrangement)

The memories are still raw. Norway Chess 2025. A lot had already been said, mostly surrounding the scepticism about how Gukesh Dommaraju was not quite living up to his world championship promise. Tensions boiled over. And it peaked during his match against World No. 1 Magnus Carlsen For the first time in his career, the 34-year-old Norwegian lost to the youngest-ever World Champion in the classical format. What followed was a burst of raw emotion: a loud bang on the table and a now-viral “oh my god!” that reverberated far beyond the chess hall.Magnus Carlsen would later remark, “On a normal day, of course, I win that game.” It is almost like Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim saying, “We proved today that we can win any game in the Premier League,” after a season-opening 1-0 defeat to Arsenal — confident in theory, but the scoreboard tells a different story.History, as they say, cannot be rewritten, neither in chess nor in football.But there’s a twist, though. Gukesh’s win was with the white pieces, and so was R Praggnandhaa’s 2024 victory over Carlsen at Norway Chess.But the real story is even more remarkable, and far less talked about.In the last 14 years, only one Indian has beaten Magnus Carlsen with the black pieces since he regained the World No. 1 spot from Viswanathan Anand in 2011.And it wasn’t Gukesh, Pragg, or even Anand. It was Karthikeyan Murali, a Thanjavur-born Indian Grandmaster.In 2023, at the Qatar Masters, Karthikeyan made history, becoming only the third Indian to defeat Magnus Carlsen in classical chess after Pentala Harikrishna in 2005 and Anand multiple times, but he was the first to do it with the black pieces in Carlsen’s 14-year reign as World No. 1.“It was a great feeling to beat the World No. 1 with black pieces,” he tells TimesofIndia.com.Even with victory in hand, the nerves were real as he admits: “Of course, there was some kind of intimidation. He’s the world number one. I was nervous and excited. But I noticed some weaknesses in him, what I was targeting, and it paid off. I have huge respect for him. He’s one of my role models and biggest inspirations. Even with advancing computer technologies, he still beats everyone. That’s something to learn from. ”Why is winning with black so special? In chess, white always moves first, giving an advantage in setting the pace. Winning with black takes careful planning, strong nerves, and smart tactics, making the win much sweeter for the black.26-year-old Karthikeyan Murali has quietly carved out an impressive chess career, one milestone at a time.Picked up the game at 10, the two-time national champion started competing professionally at 12, and over the years, built a resume few can rival. But his entry into chess wasn’t a grand plan.“It was accidental,” he recollects. “My dad had a surgery, and he was on bed rest for 15 days. During that time, he played games like checkers, chess, carrom… and I got more interested in chess than other games. That’s how it started. Then I joined an academy, and it went on like that.”As Indian chess continues to produce stars like Gukesh and Pragg, Murali’s feat stands apart. Beating Magnus Carlsen with black in classical chess is a rare mark of mastery, one few achieve and even fewer sustain.The boy from Thanjavur, who stumbled into chess by accident, recently finished joint-second at the Chennai Grand Masters. But his eyes shine brightest when the conversation turns to that one night in Qatar. As Murali himself says, ""That was something very special for me.""","26-year-old Karthikeyan Murali has quietly carved out an impressive chess career, one milestone at a time.

What Sachin Tendulkar said on not having a century at Lord's

NEW DELHI: Legendary Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar reminisced about his on-field duels with Australian greats Glenn McGrath and the late spin maestro Shane Warne , while also sharing a light-hearted remark about former international umpire Steve Bucknor , who gave several controversial decisions against him during his career.During an 'Ask Me Anything' session on Reddit, Sachin walked down memory lane, offering fascinating insights into the modern game.When asked if he had ever deliberately played a false shot to upset a bowler’s rhythm or test his reaction, Sachin said, ""Yes, on many occasions I have played risky shots to break the bowler's rhythm. The one that comes to my mind is against McGrath at Nairobi in 2000.""He was referring to the ICC Champions Trophy quarterfinal against Australia in 2000, where McGrath, wicketless until then, tried to dominate the opening pair of Sourav Ganguly and Sachin. In response, Sachin went on the attack, hammering him for two boundaries and three sixes in his 38 off 37 balls, featuring three fours and three sixes. His brisk 66-run opening stand with Ganguly set the stage for debutant Yuvraj Singh’s match-winning 84, guiding India to 265/9. McGrath finished wicketless, conceding 61 runs in nine overs.Australia were bowled out for 245, and India marched into the semifinals before losing to New Zealand in the final, where Chris Cairns starred with a century.Sachin also recalled his fierce battles with Warne, one of cricket ’s most talked-about rivalries. Asked who had advised him on playing sweep shots against the legendary leg-spinner, Sachin replied, ""No one, I did it myself. I had a different stance for him when he bowled over the wicket and when he went around the wicket.""That statement underlined his dominance over Warne, who struggled to dismiss him despite being one of the greatest spinners. In their head-to-head battles, Sachin scored 123 runs off 172 balls at a strike rate above 71, striking 16 fours and a six, without losing his wicket to Warne.Overall, Sachin had an outstanding record against Australia across formats, amassing 6,707 runs in 110 matches at an average of 49.68, with 20 centuries and 31 fifties, including a highest score of 241*.When the discussion turned to former umpire Bucknor, who had controversially ruled him out several times, Sachin responded with humour. ""When I am batting, give him boxing gloves to wear (so he can't raise his finger),"" he quipped.Sachin remains international cricket’s all-time leading run-scorer with 34,357 runs, 100 centuries, and 164 half-centuries in 664 matches. He was also part of India’s historic 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup-winning squad.",Legendary Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar reminisced about his on-field duels with Australian greats Glenn McGrath and the late spin maestro Shane Warne.

Shubman Gill not fit to lead in all three formats | Greenstone Lobo predicts

NEW DELHI: Reflecting on his Test career, which he ended earlier this year, former India captain Rohit Sharma said on Monday that the format is both ""challenging and draining,"" but he learned to handle its demands through preparation.The 38-year-old, who scored 4,301 runs at an average of 40.58 in 67 Tests, retired from the five-day game in May, a year after stepping away from T20 internationals following India’s World Cup triumph under his captaincy.Speaking at a CEAT event during a panel discussion on preparation for big moments, Rohit said: ""It is something that you prepare for, because the game demands longevity. Especially in the Test format, you have to last for five days. Mentally, it is very challenging and it is draining as well. But all cricketers have been brought up playing First-Class cricket. When we start playing cricket at a competitive level, even in Mumbai, club cricket (matches) go on for two days (or) three days so we are built like that and it starts at a very young age for us. It kind of makes it a little easier how to respond to situations that are there in front of you.""Rohit admitted that young players may not immediately realise the importance of preparation, but it grows on them as they progress.""...when I started playing the sport, it was all about having fun, enjoying (it). As you go on, you start playing age group cricket and you kind of keep moving forward from that. Slowly, as you meet a lot of senior players (and) coaches, they talk about how important it is to prepare well. When you are very young, you don't understand the importance of preparation. But as you go along, you understand, it gives you a kind of discipline that the game asks for, so it starts with preparation, understanding what exactly you need to do. ""Highlighting Test cricket’s demands, Rohit stressed that sustaining performance begins with being mentally fresh.""It takes a lot when you're playing the longest format and concentration is something that is the key, because you are speaking about high level performance and when you are expecting to put in high level performance, it starts with being mentally fresh all the time. A lot of work starts behind the scenes. Like I said, in preparation. I have to go back again to that because that is where it all starts. You prepare yourself to sustain for the longer period of time on the field. ""He explained that preparation became a central part of his game once he started playing for Mumbai and later India.""It exactly happened to the same (way) with me, when I started playing for Mumbai and then went on to play for India. A lot of the focus, a lot of my time was given (on) how I prepped before the game. Because once the game starts, it's all about reaction and you react to whatever is thrown at you, whether it is a pressure situation, whether it is making the right decision on the field with the bat or with the ball. A lot of time was devoted to prep and I'm sure it's not just in cricket, but anywhere, whatever you do with life, I think preparation is the key.

Tennis legend Venus Williams faced an emotional first-round defeat at the US Open on Monday, leaving uncertainty about her future in tennis. The former world number one put up a strong fight before losing to Czech 11th seed Karolina Muchova with a score of 6-3, 2-6, 6-1 at the Arthur Ashe Stadium.Williams made her return to competitive tennis in July after a 16-month break, receiving a wild card entry into the main draw at Flushing Meadows despite some criticism.The 45-year-old American showed impressive form against her 29-year-old opponent, who was born after Williams began her professional career in 1994.She indicated no plans to compete for the remainder of the year due to travel concerns, and remained uncertain about participating in the Australian Open.""That's kind of far too,"" an emotional Williams, the US Open champion in 2000 and 2001, said when asked about the Australian Open.""My goal is to do what I want to do. I'm so grateful for all the folks who gave me a wild card. They could have said, 'Hey, listen, you've been gone too long, you haven't won a lot of matches in the last few years.' I wasn't lucky with my health and with injuries.""But there were a lot of people who believed in me in these tournaments.I'm very grateful to have had that chance and that opportunity to make good on it and have a chance to really strike the ball.""I play an exciting brand of tennis. It's a lot of fun to go literally hog wild out there and hit as hard as I can. I'm happiest when I can just hit hard.""The seven-time major singles champion noted significant improvement from her 2020 US Open match against Muchova, where she lost in straight sets.""When I think about the match I played against her in 2020, I was so uncomfortable,"" she added. ""I wasn't well. I was in so much pain. Today it's night and day how much better I felt, so I'm so grateful to have had the opportunity to play in feeling better, and at that rate, have a real chance.""Williams became emotional while discussing her improved physical condition and playing without pain.""What did I prove to myself? I think for me getting back on the court was about giving myself a chance to play more healthy,"" she explained. ""When you play unhealthy, it's in your mind. It's not just how you feel. You get stuck in your mind too. It was nice to be freer.""",Venus Williams loses to Czech 11th seed Karolina Muchova in first round of US Open.

Did Nylander's comments calm fans' bitter feelings towards Marner?

Also read

As the Toronto Maple Leafs gear up for a future without Mitch Marner, the NHL team is working to bring in a potential replacement for Marner, and as reports suggest, they are considering William Nylander as a replacement. It has recently come to light that Forward Matthew Knies has suggested that William Nylander could step into Marner’s shoes alongside Auston Matthews on the top line, a move that could keep the team competitive without forcing a costly trade.Earlier, William Nylander said Mitch Marner was a “great teammate” and an “incredible person,” and scoffed at the notion that the forward was already looking to leave the Toronto Maple Leafs midway through last season. Let’s take a look at the team’s decision to proceed forward with William Nylander.After Mitch Marner’s exit, the Maple Leafs are considering William Nylander to step into Marner’s shoes on the team. In a chat with The Toronto Star, Knies pointed out that the Leafs already have the right player for the job. This idea is attractive from both a hockey and a financial perspective. With Toronto facing an already difficult situation, avoiding another blockbuster move will allow the club to maintain assets while still ensuring Matthews has an elite partner.Meanwhile, William Nylander and Matthews are no strangers to each other, as they have spent most of their NHL careers as teammates, giving them a natural chemistry that could be tapped into more consistently. While the Leafs have typically kept them apart at even strength to balance their scoring threats, the loss of Marner may push the team to reunite the two stars on a permanent basis.In fact, it will be an added advantage too if both Nylander and Marner collaborate, as it could provide the Maple Leafs with a potent top-line duo capable of carrying the offensive load.William Nylander called Mitch Marner a “great teammate” and an “incredible person,” while dismissing speculation that the forward had one foot forward and was already looking to leave the Toronto Maple Leafs midway through last season. Speaking at the NHL/NHLPA European Player Media Tour on Friday, Nylander said Marner remained committed to Toronto throughout the 2023-24 season despite rumors about his future.“Not sure where that stuff comes from, but I don’t think he was ever thinking of leaving ahead of time,” Nylander told NHL.com. “I actually asked him during the season, and he said he was concentrating on Toronto. I didn’t want to press him on that and let him be because it was obviously on his mind, but his play was focused on helping us. Then I asked him after the season, and he wasn’t sure.”It is to be noted that Mitch Marner, who gained a career-high 102 points last season, was dealt to the Vegas Golden Knights in a July 1 sign-and-trade, securing an eight-year, $96 million contract.Nylander admitted it was tough to see him go, but expressed happiness that Marner chose his destination. “It’s tough seeing him go, but I’m so happy for him and his family. “We’re going to miss him a lot, but that’s just the business of the sport,” he said.",The Toronto Maple Leafs are considering William Nylander as a replacement for Mitch Marner. Marner was dealt to the Vegas Golden Knights in a sign-and-trade on July 1.

"Iconic Amul Girl created by daCunha, not influenced by Tharoor sister, says GCMMF",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/iconic-amul-girl-created-by-dacunha-not-influenced-by-tharoor/articleshow/123510467.cms,"Amul Girl

VADODARA: The big-eyed mascot– Amul Girl – dressed in red polka dots with a matching ribbon in her hair, red shoes, and a red-and-white bow, has once again taken centre stage. It is not because of any witty or innocent comment on any current event that usually appears on the billboards with cheeky one-liners in the longest-running outdoor advertising campaign in the world.Almost six decades after its 'birth', the iconic mascot is drawing attention after an Instagram video regarding her creation went viral, forcing her marketers to clarify the origins.This occurred after marketing consultant Dr Sanjay Arora shared a video suggesting that the Amul girl was inspired by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor 's sister, Shobha Tharoor Srinivasan. The video, which starts with ""what does this girl (Amul girl) and Shashi Tharoor have in common,"" claims that ""the face of India's most famous butter girl – the cheeky blue-haired Amul mascot, was inspired by Shobha Tharoor, Shashi Tharoor's young baby sister.""In the video, Arora claims that ""the queen of puns came from the sister of the king of vocabulary."" The video shared by Arora, which racked up millions of views, even caught the attention of Shashi Tharoor's sister, who responded to the video on ‘X'.""Received a charming reel posted by @chiefsanjay from so many asking whether I inspired the Utterly Butterly blue-haired cherub. Yes, I was the first Amul baby. Yes, #ShyamBenegal took the photos.My sister @SmitaTharoor was in the 2nd colour campaign. We may have. But we don't know,"" she shared on ‘X'.The marketers of the Amul brand, however, have debunked his claims. ""We wish to clarify that the Amul Girl illustration is not influenced by Ms Shobha Tharoor. She was created by Mr Sylvester daCunha and illustrator Mr Eustace Fernandes,"" the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), the Indian dairy major that markets brand Amul, said in a statement.Created by daCunha, the polka dot-dressed Amul girl was born in 1966 with three magic words - ""utterly butterly delicious"" 10 years after Amul butter was launched in 1956.DaCunha received inputs from Dr Verghese Kurien, who conceived Amul's mascot. In June 2023, daCunha passed away.","Amul Girl is the longest-running outdoor advertising campaign in the world.

Desmond Watson released by Tampa Bay Buccaneers after weight concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/desmond-watson-released-by-tampa-bay-buccaneers-after-weight-concerns/articleshow/123512055.cms,"Rookie DT Desmond Watson let go by Bucs after skipping camp to lose weight (Image via Getty)

Why the Tampa Bay Buccaneers made the decision to release Desmond Watson



Fans weigh in as social media debates Desmond Watson’s tough cut



Talk about a rough start to an NFL journey! The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have officially released rookie defensive tackle Desmond Watson before he even got a chance to step on the field. At 6’5” and 449 pounds, Desmond Watson missed the entire training camp to focus on dropping weight, but unfortunately, it wasn’t enough to secure a spot on the roster. For a player who was once a standout at Florida, this news is a tough reminder of just how brutal the NFL grind can be.The main reason behind the release seems clear, weight management. Desmond Watson didn’t participate in any practices or preseason games, and the Buccaneers needed players ready to compete immediately. NFL teams are strict about conditioning, and while Watson has the size and raw talent, the team clearly decided they couldn’t wait for him to get into playing shape.Desmond Watson made waves at Florida as a dominant force on the defensive line. Known for his size, strength, and disruptive presence, he was a big-bodied player that college offenses struggled to block. However, even during his college days, managing his weight was part of the conversation. The transition from college to the NFL is tough for any lineman, and for Desmond Watson, it appears the Bucs needed faster results than he could deliver this preseason.Fans and analysts had mixed reactions to the news. Some sympathized with Desmond Watson, pointing out that the jump to the NFL is massive for a 22-year-old still adjusting to professional demands.Others noted that NFL life waits for no one and that players must hit the ground running. Social media lit up with discussions on size vs. speed, conditioning, and the high-stakes expectations rookies face.Being cut this early doesn’t have to be the end. NFL history has examples of players who were released early but returned stronger after focusing on conditioning and training. Desmond Watson still has youth, size, and potential on his side, and if he can manage his weight and showcase his abilities, another team could take a chance on him. For now, though, the Buccaneers’ roster move marks a challenging first chapter in what could still be a promising career.Also read - “He is so embarrassing”: Fan reacts as Madison Beer’s ex Nick Austin caught stalking Justin Herbert romance","The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have released rookie defensive tackle Desmond Watson.

"When Steve Jobs, who hated getting photographed, called a photo ‘best picture ever taken of me’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-steve-jobs-who-hated-getting-photographed-called-a-photo-best-picture-ever-taken-of-me/articleshow/123500053.cms,"A portrait of conviction



Apple founder Steve Jobs lived by the rule that God is in details



In a proof of power of a single image and the story behind the iconic portrait of Apple co-founder Setev Jobs highlights that how a competent photographer won over the famously camera-shy Jobs. In the year 2006, a Scottish photographer Albert Watson was given the task of capturing a portrait of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs for a magazine. Jobs was known for his camera-shy personality and he also disliked photo sessions. However, the portrait captured by Watson later became iconic and Jobs himself described it as ‘maybe the best picture ever taken of me.’ As reported by Bezinga, commissioned for a magazine feature, was scheduled for 9 a.m. sharp. Jobs arrived at 8:59 a.m., punctual and businesslike. Watson was warned in advance that ‘Jobs hated photographers’. When Watson met Jobs he said, ‘I believe I have you for an hour, but I think I can get this done in half an hour.” Jobs, visibly relieved, replied, “Oh, my god, that would be great. I’ve got so much to do today.”In order to capture the perfect photograph, Watson approached the shoot with minimalist precision. He used a white background, clean lighting and selected passport-style composition. Watson also instructed Jobs to lean a bit forward, imagining himself to be sitting across a table with someone who disagrees with him, but knowing that he was right. Jobs responded with characteristic wit: “Easy for me, I do that every day.”The photo session lasted for about 20 minutes and after seeing the Polaroid, Jobs reportedly said “That’s maybe the best picture ever taken of me.”Years after capturing the perfect portrait of Steve Jobs, Watson received a call from California requesting the photo again. On the same evening he got to know that Jobs has passed away on October 5, 2011 after this battle with pancreatic cancer. Apple then used the same portrait to pay tribute on its homepage. Since then the portrait has become a visual symbol of Jobs’ legacy.Apple founder Steve Jobs believed and lived by a simple rule which clearly defines his successful career, “God is in the details."" As per biographer Walter Isaacon, Jobs spent ‘hours after hours’ obsessing over the smallest of design elements, driven by a belief that ‘God is in the details’. It is believed that this philosophy of Jobs has shaped Apple’s DNA and it still continues to be the culture at the company.",Photographer Albert Watson was given the task of capturing a portrait of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs for a magazine.

As things stand, a new Nintendo Direct event could be held very soon in the month of September, 2025. This is actually going to be a great news for all the Nintendo fans as it’s been a while since a full-fledged direct event was last held.In July, fans were treated with a Nintendo Direct in July but it was entirely dedicated to third-party titles only, like Monster Hunter Stories 3, Star Wars Outlaws, etc. August also saw another Direct event, but again it was just a Kirby Air Riders-exclusive event.2025 has already been an incredible year for the Nintendo fans thanks to the highly awaited launch of Switch 2. The July’s event also enriched the new console with many brand new games, but it still lacks the first-party aura. However, that seems to be changing now.Recently, popular Nintendo leaker and insider SwitchForce posted a cryptic tweet which suggested that the upcoming Nintendo is going to be held on September 12, 2025. This claim event got a more solid base after a report by VGC, which stated that a potential Nintendo Direct is planned for mid-September.However, the report didn’t put a seal on any exact date. Still, September 12 makes a significant date for a full-fledged Nintendo Direct event as it marks the 40th anniversary of Super Mario Bros, just a day before.So, fans can really root for that day to host this highly anticipated event.Although neither the VGC report or the SwitchForce tweet didn’t go in detail about what we can expect from the event, but it seems the hugely anticipated release date of Metroid Prime 4 Beyond might be finally released. Along with it, we might also see an announcement regarding Super Mario as it was earlier mentioned that the day after the event will complete 40 years of this legendary title.Other titles like Pokemon Legends: Z-A or Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream might be featured as well in the upcoming Nintendo Direct. Besides this, fans can expect more third-party announcements for Switch 2, despite July’s event.","A new Nintendo Direct event could be held very soon in the month of September, 2025.
