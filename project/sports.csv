World Chess Championship: Gukesh gets early wakeup call as Ding Liren takes exciting win in Game 1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/world-chess-championship-gukesh-gets-early-wakeup-call-as-ding-liren-takes-exciting-win-in-game-1/articleshow/115686808.cms,"D Gukesh and Ding Liren during game one of the WCC on Monday.

THE MOVES:

D Gukesh was ready to pounce, but he was not fully prepared for the counter-attack.Reigning world champion Ding Liren , 32, gave the 18-year-old Indian challenger a 'wake up and smell the coffee' moment in the opening battle of the 14-game World Chess Championship match in Singapore on Monday.The world No. 23 Chinese, who had accepted that he was an underdog, won in 42 moves of French defense Steinitz variation against an opponent who is world No. 5 and in red-hot form.It was a nervy contest, rich in nuances and high on spirit. For almost five hours, the followers were glued to their gadgets and apparently so was Ding, supposedly recovering from mental cobwebs. In the process, it was Gukesh's turn to get trapped.The winless run of 300-plus days didn't stop Ding from scoring his third career classical win against Gukesh - and all of them have come with black pieces. Gukesh is yet to score a classical win against the Asian giant and if he wants to avoid tiebreaks of shorter time controls, he has to win at least twice now to seal the deal. Gukesh did not make any dramatic mistakes or blunders; but there were oversights. Ding was more accurate and alert and raised the bar with good moves that his younger opponent didn't envisage at clutch moments.Once a regular opening, the French defense became extremely rare at the World Championship level since the 1978 Match onwards. And Ding last tried it against Nepo last year in the seventh game, also with black, and lost it. But this specific line - Classical Steinitz variation (named after the first ever world champion) was the first occurrence at this stage.Only one pawn and a knight were off the board till the 25th move as the players tried to wrest control. Though Ding castled late (31st move), his two knight moves (18..Nb2 and 32..Nd3) had precision written all over. Ding acknowledged it was a great win, but he was lucky too. ""I was worse out of the opening but overall, I played well. I thought he (Gukesh) might get nervous at the start of the match and hence I tried to play something unusual that I have not tried recently. And it worked to perfection.""Gukesh accepted that it's not a great start in his bid to become the youngest monarch of the sport. ""All depended on alertness,"" he said at the press conference later. ""I made a tactical oversight (GM and commentator Judit Polgar thought the mistakes were strategic). It can happen. I expected nothing else but the best version of Ding. Now, it gets more exciting since I am trailing.""Saying that he was playing on his own (out of the book) after Ding's 10th move that led to his first long thought, with stretched for almost 21 minutes, the Indian emphasised that his gameplan for the remaining contest won't change much. He intends to play with good energy and according to the positions and not be ultra-defensive.For the first 10 moves, Gukesh took just 90 seconds and Ding almost 50 minutes - the pawn move needing 28 minutes and a queen-push a further 15. But 12 moves later, Ding had the clock advantage (29 mins in hand for 28 moves to Gukesh's 24). And finally, it led to Gukesh needing to make seven moves in 45 seconds to reach the 40-move mark.1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nce2 Nc6 7.c3 a5 8.Nf3 a4 9.Be3 Be7 10.g4 Qa5 11.Bg2 a3 12.b3 cxd4 13.b4 Qc7 14.Nexd4 Nb6 15.0-0 Nc4 16.Bf2 Bd7 17.Qe2 Nxd4 18.Nxd4 Nb2 19.Qe3 Rc8 20.Rac1 Qc4 21.f5 Qd3 22.Qe1 Bg5 23.Rc2 Rc4 24.h4 Bf4 25.Qb1 Rxc3 26.Rxc3 Qxc3 27.fxe6 fxe6 28.Ne2 Qxe5 29.Nxf4 Qxf4 30.Qc2 Qc4 31.Qd2 0-0 32.Bd4 Nd3 33.Qe3 Rxf1+ 34.Bxf1 e5 35.Bxe5 Qxg4+ 36.Bg2 Bf5 37.Bg3 Be4 38.Kh2 h6 39.Bh3 Qd1 40.Bd6 Qc2+ 41.Kg3 Qxa2 42.Be6+ Kh8 white resigned.","Reigning world champion Ding Liren gave the 18-year-old Indian challenger a 'wake up and smell the coffee' moment in the opening battle of the 14-game World Chess Championship match in Singapore on Monday.

The discussion was brief and he was walking back to the pavilion when he collapsed. The events were caught on camera as the match was being streamed live. Patel was rushed to hospital where doctors declared him dead.“He didn’t have history of any medical condition,” said Naseer Khan, another cricketer. “He was in good physical condition. In fact, he was an allrounder who loved the game. We’re all still in shock.”Patel leaves behind a wife and three daughters, the youngest only four months old. A massive crowd turned up for his last rites near Maulana Azad College late on Wednesday. Patel owned a cricket team, had a real-estate business and ran a juice shop.

“From traditional to open-chested position…” EAM Jaishankar’s cricket analogy draws applause

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Thursday used a cricket analogy to describe the evolution of India's foreign policy . He also described the changing nature of India-Pakistan policies towards each other with the progression of the former's defensive policy to a more proactive one towards the latter.Speaking at the release of former Indian cricketer Mohinder Amarnath's memoir 'Fearless', Jaishankar said, ""You said you played them better because from the traditional side-on position, you now move to an open-chested position. I couldn't have found a better description for a Pakistan policy that time.""Highlighting several key lessons from the book that resonate with country's foreign policy, Jaishankar said, ""The first takeaway is that the world is intensely competitive, but respect is earned. So the same Clive Lloyd in 1976, who did not spare any of you from body line bowling, was also the fielding captain who was generous enough to declare that pitch unfit in 1983. And that, in many ways, was respect earned.""""I think nobody has any doubt that 1983 was the inflection point. It was not just the inflection point, but the man of the match of the inflection point. Pakistan won it at one point and Sri Lanka won it at one point. But nowhere else was it as big an inflection point as it was in the history of cricket. Because, if you look at India's role in world cricket after 1983, it fundamentally changed,"" he said.Mohinder Amarnath played for the Indian national team from 1969 to 1989, amassing 4,378 Test runs, with nine of his eleven centuries coming overseas.He was named man of the match in both the semi-final and final of India's 1983 World Cup victory. In recognition of his contributions, he was named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1984 and also received the prestigious Arjuna Award that same year.", External affairs minister S Jaishankar used a cricket analogy to describe the evolution of India's foreign policy. He also described the changing nature of India-Pakistan policies towards each other.

"Reports indicate Deion Sanders is being considered for the head coaching position at the Dallas Cowboys, following Mike McCarthy's firing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/reports-indicate-deion-sanders-is-being-considered-for-the-head-coaching-position-at-the-dallas-cowboys-following-mike-mccarthys-firing/articleshow/115790904.cms,"Image via LAPRESSE

Pressure is increasing for Jerry Jones to fire Mike McCarthy and hire Deion Sanders

Coach Mike McCarthy of Cowboys, had been criticized since the commencement of 2025. When Dallas lost terribly to Tampa Bay in its opener against Tampa Bay for its wild card round elimination, he looked like being given his pink slip coming out of the offseason for having one too many chances that might just not arrive the following year.In such circumstances, owner Jerry Jones had stuck with faith with his head coach in an uncertain situation. McCarthy appeared to be a guy who was on the way out after a humiliating playoff loss in the first round last season. But, owner Jerry Jones chose to keep the faith in McCarthy, despite uncertainty about his future.Reports indicate Deion Sanders is being targeted for the head coaching job with the Dallas Cowboys. A Hall of Fame quarterback is reportedly backing the move. With a 4-7 record this season and the slimmest of hopes to end their Super Bowl drought, the Cowboys will decide whether to move on from Mike McCarthy at the end of the season. With Jerry Jones believed to be bringing a fresh face to the table, some may believe that McCarthy will receive a new contract because his team lacks stars such as Dak Prescott.Brett Favre, a former NFL quarterback, has endorsed Deion Sanders for the Cowboys, citing his impressive resume from Colorado and Jackson State, as well as his connections to the America's Team. ""If he does go in the direction of firing Mike McCarthy,"" Favre said, ""which I have no idea which way he's leaning. I think he's definitely worthy of a shot.”Favre acknowledged his personal connection with Sanders and his ability to support his character. ""I think the world of him. I know him personally. So, I know what kind of character he has."" Sanders has not shown much interest in taking over the Cowboys, stating that he has a ""kickstand down"" in Boulder.Also Read: Will Demarcus Robinson play against the Saints this Sunday after arrest on DUI suspicion? Rams coach Sean McVay clears the air Dallas signed McCarthy to a five-year deal in 2020, but the 2024 season is his last season under his current contract. Like Dak Prescott, he did not have an extension worked out with the front office. If Dallas does have a turnaround, they might look for a new head coach this coming offseason. Before joining the Cowboys, McCarthy spent 13 seasons as the Packers' head coach. This is his 18th season as a head coach in the NFL. He has a career record of 171-109-2, having won the Super Bowl with the Packers in 2010.","Deion Sanders is being targeted for the head coaching job with the Dallas Cowboys.

Who is the batting coach of Chennai Super Kings in IPL 2025?

NEW DELHI: Having retained the core of their team for 2025 and beyond, Chennai Super Kings brought back R Ashwin after 10 seasons at the IPL Auction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and reunited him with Ravindra Jadeja. They also bolstered their spin attack and created backup in the form of Noor Ahmed.The five-time IPL champions also signed players who have the experience in domestic cricket but their IPL careers haven't created headlines in the years gone by. That list includes Rahul Tripathi, Vijay Shankar, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Deepak Hooda and Shreyas Gopal.Out of the total purse of Rs 120 crore, which each franchise had before retaining players, CSK spent Rs 65 crore to retain five players, including the uncapped MS Dhoni (Rs 4 crore).The re-introduction of a rule in the IPL Player Regulations allowed CSK to retain Dhoni. The rule states that any player who hasn't played international cricket for five years or hasn't had a central contract for that period is considered uncapped.Coach Stephen Fleming on the CSK squad, ""I think we've got a really well balanced side, a good mix of some experience, of exciting young players. And sometimes you've just got to hold your nerve. We also knew it was going to be really competitive with a number of players that we wanted. So it's always a juggling act between going too far and being able to stop.""1. Moeen Ali2. Deepak Chahar3. Tushar Deshpande4. Rajvardhan Hangargekar5. Ajay Mandal6. Mukesh Choudhary7.

NEW DELHI: With trusted lieutenant Virat Kohli once again headlining the Royal Challengers Bengaluru's (RCB) new 22-member squad, the team will launch another attempt next year to win the elusive Indian Premier League (IPL) title.The team's think-tank pieced together the new squad during the two-day IPL mega auction held in Jeddah on November 24-25. RCB maintained their core by retaining three crucial players before the auction -- Kohli, Rajat Patidar and Yash Dayal -- and were left with Rs 83 crore for shopping in the Saudi Arabian port city.The franchise strengthened their batting lineup through significant acquisitions at the auction, securing all-rounder Liam Livingstone and wicketkeeper-batter Phil Salt. They also spent big to acquire Indian wicketkeeper Jitesh Sharma.RCB shelled out a big amount to get the services of Australian fast bowler Josh Hazlewood as the leader of their pace attack alongside swing bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar.While the team will decide its new captain in due course, there are reports that Kohli might return to lead the side once again.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru will launch another 22-member team next year to win the elusive Indian Premier League next year.

NEW DELHI: The two-day Indian Premier League (IPL) auction concluded in the port city of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia on November 25, with Rishabh Pant emerging as the costliest buy, breaking the record of biggest price tag with a pay-cheque of a staggering Rs 27 crore from the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG).Batter Shreyas Iyer came a close second with a bid of Rs 26.75 crore, shelled out by the Punjab Kings.Rishabh Pant, who was not retained by Delhi Capitals (DC) and is currently playing the Test series in Australia, was bought by the LSG after an intense bidding war with Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Delhi -- taking his base-price of Rs 2 crore to a record rise. It will be the first time that Pant will move out of his hometown Delhi to play for another IPL side, and it required LSG to empty their pockets, breaking the record set by Australian pacer Mitchell Starc last year with his Rs 24.75 crore bid from Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). In all likelihood, Pant will lead the LSG side, especially because KL Rahul is no longer with the Lucknow team.Shreyas Iyer took home a whopping Rs 26.75 crore pay-cheque from Punjab. Released by KKR ahead of the auction, Iyer had led the franchise to their third IPL title in 2024, after missing the entire 2023 season due to a back injury. However, he was still not retained by Kolkata. The 29-year-old was originally bought by KKR for Rs 12.25 crore in 2022, taking on the role of captain following seven seasons with Delhi Capitals. Punjab, who were also looking for a marquee player to lead the side, might appoint him as their skipper for the 2025 season.Venkatesh Iyer turned out to be a surprise star at the IPL 2025 mega auction, with reigning champions KKR splashing a massive Rs 23.75 crore to bring him back into the fold. The left-handed Iyer was not retained by KKR ahead of the auction. Iyer entered the auction with a base price of Rs 2 crore, with KKR making the first move for the star performer of their title-winning run in the last edition and eventually winning the bid after an intense battle with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB).England white-ball captain Jos Buttler laughed his way to the bank as he raked in a jaw-dropping Rs 15.75 crore from 2022 champions Gujarat Titans (GT). After an intense three-way bidding war, GT secured the services of the England superstar for a whopping price. Buttler, who was not retained by Rajasthan Royals ahead of the auction, was part of the franchise for the last seven editions. Before joining Royals in 2018, Buttler had represented Mumbai Indians in 2016 and 2017 editions. Buttler also brings with him valuable experience and leadership qualities.KL Rahul was part of the marquee list at the auction and had a base price of Rs. 2 crore. He had entered the IPL auction after not being retained by LSG despite being their captain last season. Rahul has been a vital asset for multiple franchises over the years, including the Lucknow, Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings), Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Sunrisers Hyderabad. With Pant no longer with DC, Rahul is the most likely candidate to lead the Delhi team in the 2025 season.Rajasthan Royals (RR) snapped up England pacer Jofra Archer for Rs 12.50 crore. The Royals, known for their strategic picks, brought back Archer, adding a world-class bowler to their roster. Archer, who played his last IPL season in 2020, was added back to the shortlist three days before the auction. The right-arm pacer made his comeback this summer after a lengthy injury layoff, featuring in England's white-ball series against Pakistan, Australia and the West Indies, as well as the T20 World Cup.MI bagged veteran New Zealand pacer Trent Boult, known for his early strikes with the new ball, for Rs 12.50 crore. The move will reunite the Kiwi left-arm pacer, who took 16 wickets in last IPL season but was still released by Rajasthan, will reunite with India’s ace fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah at MI. The pair was instrumental in Mumbai's title-winning campaign in 2020. It was their fifth and last crown. Overall, Boult has represented as many as five teams: Sunrisers Hyderabad, Kolkata Knight Riders, Delhi Capitals, Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals in the cash-rich league.Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) has successfully re-acquired the Australian right-arm pacer Josh Hazlewood for Rs 12.5 crore. Having previously contributed to RCB's impressive 2021 season, Hazlewood is set to lead their pace attack once again. His proven skills in generating bounce and movement will significantly enhance RCB's fast-bowling department.Ishan Kishan will be turning up for a new franchise in the IPL as the youngster was sold to SRH for Rs 11.25 crore, which is 26% less than Rs 15.25 crore MI paid to buy him in the 2022 auction. Mumbai started the bidding for Kishan at his pace price of Rs 2 crore but didn't go beyond Rs 3.20 crore. Delhi Capitals, looking for a wicketkeeper-batter after Rishabh Pant wasn't retained, were in an intense bidding war with Punjab Kings before SRH joined the action late and got his services.Chennai Super Kings secured Afghanistan's young talent Noor Ahmad for Rs 10 crore after a fierce bidding contest ensued between Mumbai Indians and Chennai for the left-arm Afghanistan spinner's services. Initially acquired by CSK for Rs 5 crore, Ahmad's price doubled when GT's attempt to get him with the 'Right to Match' card was thwarted by CSK's elevated bid of Rs 10 crore. Chennai's acquisition of Ravichandran Ashwin, the retention of Ravindra Jadeja from IPL 2024 and the addition of Ahmad has established a formidable spin-bowling unit that appears well-suited to their home-ground conditions.","Indian Premier League (IPL) auction concluded in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia on November 25. Rishabh Pant broke the record of biggest price tag with a pay- cheque of a staggering Rs 27 crore from the Lucknow Super Giants. Shreyas Iyer came a close second with a bid of Rs 26.75 crore, shelled out by the Punjab Kings.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115684676,imgsize-63190,width-400,resizemode-4/115684676.jpg"

The retention of core players like Ruturaj Gaikwad, Ravindra Jadeja, and MS Dhoni highlights CSK’s commitment to stability and experience.Having retained the core of their team for 2025 and beyond, CSK brought back Ravichandran Ashwin after 10 seasons at the IPL Auction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and reunited him with Ravindra Jadeja. They also bolstered their spin attack and created backup in the form of Noor Ahmed.The five-time IPL champions also signed players who have the experience in domestic cricket but their IPL careers haven't created headlines in the years gone by.

Rishabh Pant became the most expensive player at IPL 2025 Auction and in the history of the league after the flashy left-handed wicketkeeper-batter was acquired by Lucknow Super Giants for Rs 27 crore. Pant became LSG's obvious choice as team leader as they broke bank for his credentials.Shreyas Iyer had become the most expensive IPL player for a brief period when Punjab Kings spent Rs 26.75 crore on him. He had played his cricket for defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders last season and led them to the title.While Pant and Shreyas were expected to draw big bids after not being retained by their respective franchises, the third biggest bid of the IPL 2025 Auction came out of nowhere. KKR broke bank for one of their own in the form of Venkatesh Iyer, bringing him for Rs 23.75 crore.Another notable signing over the two-day IPL Auction was that of 13-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi. From a base price of Rs 30 lakh, the teenager went to Rajasthan Royals for Rs 1.10 crore in a deal that captured the attention of many.Out of the national team setup for over two years, Bhuvneshwar Kumar’s experience found high demand among IPL franchises, with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) securing his services for Rs 10.75 crore on Monday.The second day of the mega auction turned out to be lucrative for several Indian pacers, while some big names, including Shardul Thakur, Prithvi Shaw, Ajinkya Rahane, Kane Williamson, and Glenn Phillips, went unsold.Set to turn 35 before the start of the next IPL season, Bhuvneshwar boasts an impressive record of 300 wickets in 287 T20 matches with an economy rate under eight.Other notable deals included Deepak Chahar, who fetched Rs 9.25 crore from Mumbai Indians despite his injury history, and Mukesh Kumar, retained by Delhi Capitals for Rs 8 crore through the RTM card. Lucknow Super Giants also invested heavily, signing Test pacer Akash Deep for Rs 8 crore.Among the all-rounders, Krunal Pandya earned Rs 5.75 crore from RCB, who were in need of an experienced spin-bowling all-rounder. Rajasthan Royals made significant bids for Tushar Deshpande (Rs 6.50 crore) and Nitish Rana (Rs 4.20 crore), while Delhi Capitals secured former RCB skipper Faf du Plessis at a bargain base price of Rs 2 crore. Gujarat Titans acquired Washington Sundar for Rs 3.20 crore in another smart move.The scarcity of quality Indian seam-bowling all-rounders worked in favor of South Africa’s Marco Jansen, who secured a Rs 7 crore deal with Punjab Kings. Also making a major gain was veteran New Zealand pacer Trent Boult who was bought by Mumbai Indians for Rs 12.5 crore -- highlighting the demand for quality fast bowlers.Meanwhile, the auction reflected the high demand for Indian talent despite the limited options, ensuring lucrative deals for even fringe players.On Sunday, the first day of the auction, most of the high-profile names raked in the moolah as the franchises virtually emptied their pockets to bag the priority players in their respective shortlist.Led by Rs 27 crore Lucknow Super Giants spent to buy star wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant, the sum of money splurged by the franchises came to a whopping INR 467.95 crore.Pant edged past Shreyas Iyer, who fetched Rs 26.75 crore from Punjab Kings, as teams went all out for marquee Indian stars. Venkatesh Iyer took home a whopping Rs 23.75 crore from KKR.A total of 84 players from the roster of 577 were presented on the opening day at the Abadi Al Johar Arena. Out of these 68 got sold, while four were retained through the Right-to-Match card.Among other big buys, leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal attracted Rs 18 crore from Punjab Kings, who also used the Right-to-Match card to bring back paceman Arshdeep Singh for Rs 18 crore. KL Rahul was picked up by Delhi Capitals for Rs 14 crore.Meanwhile, the BCCI has taken a significant step by announcing the schedules for the IPL for the next three seasons. This is a departure from the usual practice of releasing schedules closer to the tournament.The 2025 IPL will commence on March 14 and conclude on May 25.The IPL Auction 2025 showcased a dramatic and competitive bidding war, with several franchises securing high-profile talent to strengthen their squads for the upcoming season. The second day saw Indian pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar topping the chart with a hefty price of INR 10.75 crore, reflecting the high demand for experienced fast bowlers despite his long absence from the national team. This influx of Indian talent demonstrates how IPL franchises value local players, often resulting in hefty bids even for those not part of the national setup.Franchises made smart moves by picking up key players based on specific team needs. Deepak Chahar, for example, fetched Rs 9.25 crore despite a history of injuries, highlighting the increasing reliance on proven seamers. Meanwhile, Mumbai Indians, who often make shrewd investments, secured both Mukesh Chahar and Deepak Chahar, bolstering their pace attack for IPL 2025. Lucknow Super Giants also impressed with strategic buys like Akash Deep, further reinforcing their depth in bowling.Notably, there was also a surge in the prices of all-rounders like Krunal Pandya (Rs 5.75 crore) and Washington Sundar (Rs 3.20 crore), whose versatility adds immense value to their respective teams. This indicates that franchises are looking for players who can contribute with both bat and ball, especially in the high-pressure, multifaceted environment of the IPL.The auction was also marked by some surprising omissions. Players like Shardul Thakur, Prithvi Shaw, Ajinkya Rahane, and Kane Williamson, who are usually regarded as top performers, went unsold, pointing to the shifting dynamics of IPL team strategies. While these players' exclusion may have shocked fans, it underlined the intense competition for spots and the changing nature of what franchises are looking for in their squads.Overall, the 2025 auction was a testament to the evolving nature of IPL strategies—teams focused on a mix of experience, youth, and flexibility. As the season nears, fans can look forward to an exciting and unpredictable tournament, with new combinations and fresh talent ready to light up the IPL stage.","Bhuvneshwar Kumar, out of India's national team for two years, fetched a hefty Rs 10.75 crore from RCB in the IPL 2025 auction.

Delhi's bowling card:

NEW DELHI: Delhi created a unique chapter in cricket history on Friday, becoming the first team to deploy all 11 players as bowlers in a T20 match. The remarkable feat was achieved during their Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy encounter against Manipur at the Wankhede Stadium , Mumbai.Manipur won the toss and opted to bat first, presenting Delhi skipper Ayush Badoni with an opportunity to execute this unconventional strategy.Primarily a wicketkeeper, Badoni himself bowled two overs, claiming one wicket while maintaining a tight economy. His second over was a maiden, further highlighting the effectiveness of the approach.Delhi’s 11 bowlers managed to restrict Manipur to 120/8 in their 20 overs.Digvesh (2/8) and Harsh Tyagi (2/11) were the standout performers with the ball for Delhi, while Priyansh Arya (1/2) and Aayush Singh (1/7) also were among the wickets. Despite utilizing all their resources, Delhi could not bowl out Manipur, whose batters put up a gritty fight.This achievement surpasses the previous record in T20 cricket, where no team had employed more than nine bowlers in an innings. It also mirrors a rare occurrence in Test cricket, most notably when India, under Sourav Ganguly's captaincy, used all 11 players to bowl against the West Indies in 2002.Delhi’s innovative tactic underscores the flexibility and unpredictability in the shortest format of the game, offering a fresh perspective on team dynamics and strategy.",Delhi became the first team to deploy all 11 players as bowlers in a T20 match.

""We don't want this guy full of confidence for the rest of the series,"" Border added.Border also questioned Pat Cummins ' captaincy, suggesting that the strategies employed allowed Kohli to regain his form after recent struggles against New Zealand. Hayden shared similar views, specifically pointing out flaws in Australia's field placements.""They missed a few tricks with Virat Kohli in the early part of his innings,"" Hayden told Channel 7. ""It was so easy for him to get off strike... when he got the bit between the teeth, it was too late.""Hayden also criticized the delayed use of short-pitched bowling against Yashasvi Jaiswal , who initially appeared susceptible to this tactic.""Maybe tiny things with Pat Cummins, the ability to think through these decisions,"" Hayden remarked.Hayden speculated that Australia's poor first-innings batting performance may have contributed to their less effective tactics.Both former players emphasized the need for improved planning to counter India's batting lineup in the subsequent Tests. They cautioned that a confident Kohli could be a game-changer in the five-match series.","Allan Border and Matthew Hayden expressed concerns about Australia's handling of Virat Kohli.

NEW DELHI: Star wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant on Sunday made history at the IPL 2025 mega auction in Jeddah, becoming the league’s most expensive player with a record-breaking Rs 27 crore bid from Lucknow Super Giants (LSG).Pant edged past Shreyas Iyer, who fetched Rs 26.75 crore from Punjab Kings, as teams went all out for marquee Indian stars.Both Pant and Iyer entered the auction after parting ways with their previous teams. Iyer, who led Kolkata Knight Riders to the IPL title earlier this year, briefly held the record as the costliest IPL player before LSG swooped in for Pant. Delhi Capitals used their Right to Match (RTM) card for Pant at Rs 20.75 crore but opted not to match LSG's staggering bid.Former DC teammates Iyer and Pant have had to deal with adversity in the past couple of years but have shown remarkable resilience and courage to bounce back.Iyer is expected to captain Punjab Kings, while Pant is likely to lead LSG in the upcoming season. Among other big buys, leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal attracted Rs 18 crore from Punjab Kings, while former LSG skipper KL Rahul was picked up by Delhi Capitals for Rs 14 crore.Sunrisers Hyderabad secured India pacer Mohammed Shami for Rs 10 crore, while left-arm seamer Arshdeep Singh earned Rs 18 crore through Punjab’s RTM card.South African speedster Kagiso Rabada went to Gujarat Titans for Rs 10.75 crore, highlighting an auction filled with record-breaking bids and tactical moves.","Rishabh Pant becomes most expensive IPL player after he goes to LSG for Rs 27 crore.

Prithvi Shaw, base price Rs 75 lakh, failed to attract a bid at IPL 2025 mega auction

NEW DELHI: Prithvi Shaw , once regarded as one of India's brightest cricketing talents, found no takers at the IPL 2025 mega auction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The 25-year-old batter, who captained India to victory at the 2018 U19 World Cup, had entered the auction with a conservative base price of Rs 75 lakh but remained unsold.Shaw, who was released by Delhi Capitals after a six-year stint, had been a mainstay in the franchise since 2018. However, inconsistent performances and questions over his fitness have deterred franchises from bidding for him.Delhi Capitals co-owner Parth Jindal, speaking to India Today, offered a candid assessment of Shaw's journey and his current struggles. ""Prithvi is a great kid but is misunderstood in many ways. I think, once in a while, we all need a jolt, and need to be shaken up from our slump,"" Jindal said.Jindal highlighted the high expectations Shaw faced early in his career, with comparisons to legends like Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara , creating an environment that may have hindered his growth. ""When all your life you grew up hearing that you are the special one, the most talented, and is the only other batsman in the world other than Sachin and Kohli to own an MRF bat, that tells you a lot. Somebody called him Lara, somebody called him Sachin, or the next big thing...so he grew up in that environment.""""Everyone from Mumbai cricket was talking about him. Mumbai has given us Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar, and now they were talking about him. So, this is that one jolt Prithvi needed. Till now he was on a fat IPL contract and playing across formats for Mumbai and was starting for Delhi,"" Jindal said.The Capitals co-owner further emphasized that Shaw's path forward requires rediscovering his passion for the game while addressing issues of fitness and commitment. ""He needs to work hard and get back to loving the game again, and work on his fitness and discipline. I hope he comes back and becomes the Prithvi Shaw he had known,"" Jindal added.Shaw's decline in recent years has been stark. Once touted as a potential future star for India, his performances in domestic and IPL cricket have been inconsistent, and his lack of fitness has drawn criticism. This auction outcome may serve as a crucial turning point in Shaw's career, as he now faces the challenge of rebuilding his reputation and earning his way back into top-level cricket.","Prithvi Shaw, base price Rs 75 lakh, failed to attract a bid at IPL 2025 mega auction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

From moulding

into an off-spinner to seeing him become an effective Test allrounder, coach Mhambrey outlines the player's evolution

IPL Auction: RR bowling looks overdependent on Jofra Archer

In Jan 2016, Washington Sundar went to the U-19 World Cup believing he was a top-order batter. Little did the 16-year-old know that U-19 head coach Rahul Dravid and bowling coach Paras Mhambrey were tapping into his off-spin bowling skills.""Rahul and I feel he is untapped as an off-spinner. It's difficult to break his thinking right now. He can be a good first-class off-spinner much like R Ashwin. He has a role model from his state,"" Mhambrey had told TOI on the eve of the final then.Cut to Nov 2024. Washington was taking the field for India in a Test match in Perth ahead of Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja . He is now part of two successive Test wins on two of the paciest pitches in Australia.There's nothing flashy about Washington. He isn't the chattiest person around. Yet, he has been effective. ""The Washi of 2016 was a very shy boy who wouldn't talk much. But he was always a good listener. Now, he is mature and can have a two-way conversation. He will take inputs but he doesn't mind coming back and saying that it's not working for him,"" Mhambrey told TOI on Friday.A year after the U-19 World Cup, Washington made IPL and India 'A' teams on the strength of his off-spin — a remarkable progress for a teenager. Mhambrey puts it down to a sharp mind ticking inside his head: ""He is a smooth operator. He will think about the things he has been told. He'll then figure out what works for him. So, he started working hard on his off-spin and the improvement showed every season.""His selection over Ashwin and Jadeja in Perth has sparked a debate, but going by Mhambrey, it was something that was deliberated upon earlier in the year as well. India captain Rohit Sharma has been supportive of Washington's ability, even publicly criticizing IPL's 'impact player' rule for stunting his growth.""We were talking if it was time to prepare for life beyond Ashwin and Jadeja during the England series earlier in the year. Washington fits the bill. Rohit is fond of him because he is not someone who will be a nuisance if he is not played. He will do exactly what the team asks him to do. But he takes immense pride in what he does,"" Mhambrey pointed out.Yet, Mhambrey concedes that Washington is not a conventional off-spinner. ""Let's get it straight. He is not a regular off-spinner. Certainly not like Ashwin who can turn the ball big,"" he said.So what makes Washington tick? ""He has worked hard on getting the ball to turn. He never thought about becoming another Ashwin. We worked on bowling from different angles, and not to tamper with his action for the sake of getting turn. That could have rattled him when he was young. Then, it was more about just bowling, a lot. Now, he understands mixing the pace and line with angles, and is accurate. The pace through the air and off the pitch usually gives the batters less time to adjust,"" Mhambrey said.Is it enough for him to pip Ashwin and Jadeja? Mhambrey feels his batting credentials alongside his bowling ability on bouncy pitches have convinced the team management. ""His batting fundamentals are very strong. He plays pace and bounce very well. I would say he can bat in the topseven. And his style of bowling can be a handful on faster, bouncier tracks. He is someone who could even bowl in powerplays in T20s in his early days,"" Mhambrey said.Ashwin and Jadeja may still be an integral part of the team's plans going deep into the series in Australia. But Washington has certainly got going.",Washington Sundar is an effective Test allrounder for India. The 16-year-old was picked ahead of R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja in Perth.

Andy Reid urges team to stay focused



The Kansas City Chiefs just know how to win a game. And they have done it yet again while playing against the Raiders on the Black Friday clash. Patrick Mahomes led Chiefs found a way to beat Antonio Pierce 's team in a narrow 19-17. With this win, Andy Reid 's team also clinched their playoff spot. Despite this win, Reid has got some words to tell his boys. Addressing the locker room, the acclaimed coach gives a strong reminder to the players to stay grounded and work harder.The Kansas City Chiefs have certainly redefined clutch performances during the NFL season. With their unbelievable resiliency in nail-biting games, the latest one did not only make their ninth one-score win but even extended their record to 14 consecutive one-possession wins, unmatched in the NFL's history. This is proof that they are good enough when it matters most.Friday's win secured more than just their historical record; it clinched their 10th consecutive playoff appearance, a streak that now ranks second in league history. Despite the achievements, head coach Andy Reid emphasized the importance of refinement. ""We gotta clean up just a few things and take care of some business here,"" Reid stated in his postgame address.""We do that, these penalties, man. We do that and we're gonna be in great shape. But we gotta take care of that stuff, men. And I mean those are the things we can control. Other than that, we're going to enjoy this win the best way we possibly can.""Then Reid's warned his players saying:""And you to a little time here, so check your schedules. We'll get on a normal week next week,"" he said. ""Check your schedules out. Use the time wisely. Stay out of trouble. And let's take a knee, man. But hold it! How 'bout those Chiefs!""Kansas City's recent games have been nothing short of dramatic. A last-second field goal against the Carolina Panthers, a critical blocked field goal against the Denver Broncos, and a walk-off win versus the Bengals earlier in the season underscore their flair for thrilling finishes. These tight victories have cemented the Chiefs' identity as a team that thrives when the stakes are highest.Also Read: NFL Quarterback Josh Allen and actress Hailee Steinfeld are officially engaged With a brief respite before their Dec. 8 clash against the Los Angeles Chargers, the Chiefs have an opportunity to recalibrate and recharge.

Piper Niven, Lash Legend, and Michin faced off in a triple threat, and Roman Reigns met CM Punk for a tense sit-down.

Andrade countered with high-flying moves, including a leap from the top rope, but Nakamura fought back with sharp strikes. The back-and-forth direction of the match shifted repeatedly when Andrade hit a moonsault for a near fall. After exchanging elbows and suplexes, Andrade drove Nakamura into the corner. However, Nakamura exposed the turnbuckle, causing Andrade to crash into it. Nakamura was quick to seize the moment and delivered a Kinshasa to secure the victory.Result: Shinsuke Nakamura with the win.The match started with Hayes dodging Rhodes’ initial attempts, but the Undisputed WWE Champion soon connected with a punch.

Punk made it clear he didn’t like Reigns but proposed a one-time deal: help now, with Heyman owing him a favor later.

(Image: X/BCCI)

In an encouraging sign for India ahead of the second Test, the pink-ball contest in Adelaide from Dec 6, India's No. 3 batter Shubman Gill returned to the India nets on Friday, showing signs of recovery from a thumb injury that ruled him out of the Perth series opener.Gill was seen facing India's second-string pacers Yash Dayal and Akash Deep in Canberra on Friday. ""I was just trying to get a feel to be honest, see how the injury is reacting, if any kind of soreness is there but it went much better than what I and Kamlesh (Jain, physio) expected. Very happy with that,"" Gill said in a video posted by BCCI on X after the training session.However, according to a reliable source, Gill's participation in the second Test remains in doubt, as he's racing against time to be fit. The batter could likely miss India's pink-ball warm-up game against Australian PM's XI starting Saturday in Canberra.""Gill was advised a two-week rest by the medical specialist after suffering the injury to his thumb. Today was just about how he ‘feels' the ball while batting in the nets. He's desperate to return and contribute to the team. While he's likely to miss the warm-up match from Saturday and is still doubtful for the second Test, he'll certainly be back from the third Test onwards,"" a BCCI source told TOI.Recently, former Mumbai and India selector Jatin Paranjape had told TOI, ""Injuries like the one he has suffered to the thumb, take two to four weeks to heal, so don't be surprised if he misses two to three Test matches.""In Canberra on Friday, Indian team's assistant coach Abhishek Nayar said, ""Gill is batting and the evaluation will be done by physios. He looked comfortable while batting. I do not know if he will feature (in the warm-up match).""In Gill's absence, India played Devdutt Padikkal at the No. 3 spot in the Perth Test, but the left-hander was out for 0 & 25 in India's 295-run win.Gill was naturally disappointed about getting injured, but India's special performance cheered him up. ""Any ball when it hits the middle of the bat, the feeling that you get, that is the feeling I play for. When I got to know about my injury, I was quite low. Perth is the only venue we did not play last time around (2020-21). But the way we played at the end of it, I was very happy,"" the batter added in the video.India would want Gill to recover soon, considering that a No. 3 batsman is crucial to any batting line-up, especially on a fiveTest tour of Australia. Gill has the special ability to anchor the innings with his solid defence, and can attack the bowling when needed too. Importantly, the Punjab man enjoyed a good time during India's last tour of Australia in 2020-21, scoring 259 runs in three Tests at 51.80, including a crucial 91 in the historic chase in the fourth Test at the Gabba.Having scored 926 runs, including three hundreds at the No. 3 spot at 47-plus average, Gill has done well to fill the big shoes of Cheteshwar Pujara in that position. He has also scored 874 runs as an opener in 29 innings. In the 27 Tests that he has featured in, Gill has batted on only two positions — opening and one-down.","India's No. 3 batter Shubman Gill returned to the India nets on Friday. Gill was seen facing India's second-string pacers Yash Dayal and Akash Deep. Gill's participation in the second Test remains in doubt, as he's racing against time.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115827969,imgsize-31362,width-400,resizemode-4/115827969.jpg"

East or West, Pakistan India Cricket is the Best | Basit Ali

The International Cricket Council 's ( ICC ) virtual meeting to break the impasse over next year's Champions Trophy ended in a little over 15 minutes on Friday, and the deadlock between India and Pakistan continued. While the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) stands by its decision to not travel to Pakistan to play the tournament, the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) has stuck to its refusal of accepting a hybrid model where India can play all their matches at a neutral venue.In such a scenario, moving the Champions Trophy out of Pakistan looks to be the likely option, with the tournament going ahead even without Pakistan unless they accept a hybrid model.However, former Pakistan batter Basit Ali says it's impossible to conduct the tournament without both India and Pakistan part of it.""Who won in the meeting -- ICC, BCCI or PCB? And How could the meeting end so quickly?"" Basit asked in a video on his YouTube channel.""Ab pata chalega, Pakistan ko ek kaum bana diya hai BCCI ne (now they will get to know, the Indian board has united Pakistan)...Even those who were against the PCB, they are saying 'Whatever (PCB chairman) Mohsin Naqvi says, we will stick to that,"" he added.Another meeting of the ICC Board is expected in the next few day to arrive at a final decision over the tournament scheduled for February 19 to March 9 next year.""Yeh insaaf nahi hai, ke hamari Champions Trophy pe aap daaka daalne ki bharpoor koshish kar rahe hain (it's not justified that they are trying to rob Pakistan of Champions Trophy hosting),"" he said.The Champions Trophy will be making a return to the ICC calendar after a gap of seven years.Talking to media about the deadlock, BCCI's vice-president Rajeev Shukla said, ""Talks are on with the Pakistan board. The ICC is trying its best. Our position is very clear; whatever our government will tells us, we will do that.""",ICC virtual meeting to break impasse over next year's Champions Trophy ends in 15 minutes.

NEW DELHI: Former India batting legend Sunil Gavaskar is of the opinion that India will make at least two changes for the day-night Adelaide Test against Australia that starts from December 6.After the stupendous victory in the first Test against Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , India is scheduled to play a two-day warm-up match against Prime Ministers XI at the Manuka Oval in the Australian capital of Canberra from Saturday.The pink ball warm-up match in Canberra is of utmost importance for India as it will be the only practice game they will get to play ahead of the day-night second Test in Adelaide.And it will be also the first game for captain Rohit Sharma on this trip to Australia as he missed the first Test in Perth due to the birth of his son.Talking to 7Cricket, Gavaskar said, ""I think there will be two changes for sure, both Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill coming back into the 11.""Young Devdutt Padikkal is set to be replaced by returning captain Rohit Sharma in the Indian playing XI for the second Test in Adelaide.Everyone will be intrigued by KL Rahul 's batting position in the pink ball warm-up match in Canberra.Rahul might be positioned at number three instead of Padikkal, depending on whether the injured Gill recovers in time for the game.Gill missed the first Test match and has not yet begun batting in the nets after suffering a hairline fracture during the intra-squad match at the WACA.Gavaskar continues, ""My feeling is that the batting order will change. Where Rohit Sharma will replace Rahul, Shubman Gill will bat at three, Padikkal and Jurel will go out of the team, Rahul will bat at six.""At the Adelaide Oval, spin bowling might be the only tactical change made to the starting lineup.In Perth, Washington Sundar was selected ahead of the two veteran spinners, Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja.Before the 36-all-out occurred in the December 2020 Pink Ball Test in Adelaide, Ashwin handed India the lead in the first innings with statistics of 4 for 45, including a brilliant dismissal of Steven Smith.However, based on their recent performance in the nets, Ashwin, Jadeja, and Washington don't now provide much of a choice. Additionally, batting becomes crucial in Pink Ball Tests because the spinners aren't used as often.Gavaskar concludes, ""And one other change that could happen is that Jadeja comes in place of Washington Sundar.""India's success in overseas Test matches has been mostly attributed to Jadeja's batting, although Washington, a left-hander, has also performed admirably in Test matches. In Perth, he helped India surpass the 500-run mark with an 89-run partnership with Virat Kohli",Sunil Gavaskar believes India will make at least two changes for Adelaide Test.

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant shattered records at the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 mega auction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, becoming the highest-paid player in the league's history. The Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) secured the dynamic wicketkeeper-batter for an unprecedented Rs 27 crore.Pant's previous franchise Delhi Capitals attempted to retain their star player by exercising the Right to Match (RTM) card at Rs 20.75 crore. However, LSG’s aggressive bid of Rs 27 crore forced Delhi Capitals to step back, sealing Pant’s move to the Lucknow-based franchise.Pant’s record-breaking contract caps off a remarkable comeback story. After surviving a near-fatal car accident in 2022 and undergoing extensive rehabilitation, he returned to international cricket with a renewed focus for the 2024 season of the IPL.Now, Pant is expected to lead LSG as captain in the upcoming IPL 2025 season, which is scheduled to begin on March 14.While Rs 27 crore headlines Pant’s historic contract, the actual net payout will be a different story due to tax implications.Lucknow have committed Rs 27 crore per season for Pant's services with the team. The Indian government will claim Rs 8.1 crore in tax (30%) from his total contract value. This leaves Pant with a net salary of Rs 18.9 crore per season from his IPL team.Speaking about Rishabh Pant's move to LSG, former India player Robin Uthappa opined, “I think the fact that Shreyas was bid for by Punjab Kings was a planned thing, because even if they didn’t go for him, because they had the luxury of having such a big bank, they could have gotten Pant for a little less. I think there was communication where Rishabh really wanted to move on from everything that was DC in the past and go on to other things in life and I think that is why there was less interest from Ponting and Punjab Kings for Pant and more interest in Shreyas.”Another ex-India player, Mohammad Kaif, said, ""With Rishabh Pant joining LSG, the team has gained both a strong brand value and a recognisable face—an essential factor for any franchise. While LSG do not have many big names apart from Pooran, Pant’s presence will significantly benefit them. The decision to jump from ₹21 crore to ₹27 crore was aggressive, but it’s a move that seems justified. They now have an Indian captain, and securing Rishabh Pant at ₹27 crore is a worthwhile deal for LSG.""Rs 27 crore (per season)Rs 8.1 crore (as per Indian government regulations)Rs 18.9 crore (per season).","Rishabh Pant becomes most expensive IPL player after he goes to LSG for Rs 27 crore.

And it's not just a win for the Indian cricket team but a victory for the entire Indian cricket fraternity. The team is full of confidence, that they we can defeat anybody, anywhere.""A key positive for India was the batting exploits of Yashasvi Jaiswal and a return to form for Virat Kohli , with both smashing centuries.But it was their bowling unit that put India on the road to victory by dismissing the hosts for 104 in the first innings.Bumrah stood in as captain for Rohit Sharma , who missed the opener due to the birth of his second child..Akram adds, ""This is the first time that I have seen an Asian team play and win like this in Perth in 40 years, except India. And the manner in which they have won, so convincingly, one-sided, there has been no problem. India's batting in the second innings after their first innings debacle is just incredible.

IPL Auction: Will it be MS Dhoni's 'last hurrah'?

NEW DELHI: Joe Root , one of England's greatest-ever cricketers, marked a significant milestone by becoming the fourth English player and the 11th in the world to play 150 Test matches. The first Test against New Zealand in Christchurch was expected to be a celebration of Root's illustrious career, but it turned into an anticlimactic occasion as the premier batter was dismissed for a duck in the first innings.The 33-year-old Root, who had entered the match with a staggering 12,754 Test runs at an average of 51.01, was bowled by New Zealand medium-pacer Nathan Smith . Attempting to punch the ball through the covers, Root got an inside edge that brushed his back thigh before deflecting onto the stumps.The dismissal placed Root in an unfortunate club, as he became only the third batter to be out for a duck in their 150th Test. He joined Australian legends Steve Waugh , who suffered the fate against Pakistan in Sharjah in 2002, and Ricky Ponting , who was dismissed for zero against England in Adelaide in 2010.Despite the disappointment in Christchurch, Root’s recent form has been nothing short of spectacular. He has amassed 1,338 runs this year alone at an average of 55.75, including five centuries and four fifties. With 35 Test centuries in his career, Root continues to be a pivotal figure for England, although Friday's duck was the 13th in his 12-year Test career.Root's achievement of reaching 150 Tests underscores his longevity and consistency at the highest level of the game. While the milestone innings may not have gone as planned, it serves as a testament to a career filled with remarkable contributions to England's Test cricket legacy.","Joe Root becomes the fourth English player and the 11th in the world to play 150 Test matches.
