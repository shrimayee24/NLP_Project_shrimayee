NEW DELHI: India's performance in the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup was marked by both dominance and heartbreak. Entering the tournament as one of the favorites, the Indian team, led by Virat Kohli , displayed exceptional form in the group stages, winning seven out of nine matches, with one match against New Zealand being washed out due to rain. This consistency saw India finish at the top of the group stage.However, their journey took a dramatic turn in the semi-final against New Zealand.Chasing a modest target of 240, India's top order crumbled, with Rohit Sharma , captain Virat Kohli, and KL Rahul all departing early.Despite a valiant effort from Ravindra Jadeja and MS Dhoni , who stitched together a gritty partnership, India fell short by 18 runs, bringing an end to their World Cup campaign.The semi-final defeat was a bitter pill for Indian fans to swallow, as the team had been strong contenders throughout the tournament.Rohit Sharma, who emerged as the tournament's leading run-scorer with 648 runs at an average of 81.00, including five centuries, later expressed his belief that Dhoni should have batted at number four.In a viral video from 2019, Rohit mentioned: ""I personally always feel that him batting at number 4 ideal for the team. It totally depends on how the captain (Virat) and the coach think about it. Personally, I would be happy if he (Dhoni) bats at number four.""In the crucial semi-final, Dhoni batted at number seven, scoring 50 runs off 72 balls before being run out by Martin Guptill .India, who last won the ODI World Cup in 2011, have won the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 title under Rohit's captaincy.","India lost to New Zealand in the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup semi-final.

The dismissal also served as a reminder of the crucial role spinners can play in Test cricket , particularly on surfaces that offer assistance.With England seemingly in control and Brook looking comfortable at the crease, the wicket provided Sri Lanka with a much-needed breakthrough.It remains to be seen whether this moment of brilliance will prove decisive in the context of the match, but it undoubtedly added another chapter to the rich history of spin bowling at Old Trafford.","Sri Lanka spinner Prabath Jayasuriya dismisses England's Harry Brook for 56.

Shikhar Dhawan put in both the smiles and the miles to make it big,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/shikhar-dhawan-put-in-both-the-smiles-and-the-miles-to-make-it-big/articleshow/112774278.cms,"Shikhar Dhawan , who announced his international and domestic retirement on Saturday, knows Indian cricket has moved on without him. Dhawan will also know, more than most, that the stage never belongs to anyone in particular. One has to jump on it and stake a claim. Dhawan did it longer, and better, than most.Consider that the left-handed opener was already 52 first-class matches old, stretching back to November 16, 2004, when he finally got to make his ODI debut against Australia in Vizag in October 2010.His reward from the gods would be a two-ball duck.By the time of his famed Test debut at the age of 27 in March 2013 in Mohali — yet again against the Aussies — he had been long used to trudging his way across India’s dreary domestic landscape, where even big hundreds can sometimes go against you.He had put in 81 first-class appearances. It was priceless experience but a number today’s fast-tracked T20 stars would be loath to consider an achievement. Before he blazed through to the fastest Test century on debut — the 85-ball record still stands — Dhawan had been written off as the quintessential cricketing journeyman.Cynics still referred to him as the hero of India’s 2004 U-19 World Cup campaign. Even the most weather-beaten Delhi club coach had doubts whether Dhawan’s technique would hold under international cricket’s piercing glare.Hidden deep beneath that effervescent smile and casual air, though, was an extraordinary ability to ride the roughest wave. Dhawan knew something most people who interacted with him didn’t — he may be easygoing but as an active cricketer, he was deeply philosophical. He knew, more than most, that nothing goes according to the script. There’s no need to get all cut-up and angsty about it. Adapt. Move on. Be professional. There’s the other, real, life, and of course those problems need attention too. Don’t hold a grudge. Keep the faith. Keep believing.This surprising level of detachment and level-headedness helped him, in a relatively short span of time, to forge a legacy as a lef-thanded batter of distinction who delivered in high-pressure situations in 50-over cricket, especially in ICC tournaments.It couldn’t have been easy because Dhawan’s career was full of surprises — of both the pleasant and nasty kind — and nothing that happened followed from before. As someone who replaced Virender Sehwag in Tests and was meant to extend the dominance of the Delhi school of batsmanship, Dhawan now retires not as a Test stalwart of renown but instead as an ODI giant, someone who gave his best when India needed to win the big global events.In ICC tournaments he averages 65.15, the best ever, and he played a prominent role in the 2013 Champions Trophy win. He forged 18 century stands with Rohit Sharma, the second best for an opening pair behind Ganguly and Tendulkar. His ODI career average of 44.11 is only behind Kohli, Dhoni, Rohit and Tendulkar. That makes Dhawan fifth best. He’ll take that, no questions asked.“It is important to turn the page to move forward in a story, and in life,” Dhawan said in a video posted on social media. “I’m leaving with peace in my heart that I played so long for India. I’ve told myself not to feel sad that you won’t play for India again, but feel happy that you played for your country (at all).”The statement is typical Dhawan. He was all aggressive strokeplay, cuts and off-side flourishes with bat in hand on the field. Off it, his analysis of his own game was simplistic but effective. He may not have been the classiest left-hander in the business and may have had a limited range of strokes but as Sanjay Manjrekar said in tribute, he “punched well above his weight”.When Dhawan timed it well, he was a treat to watch. And so what if he never conquered his troubles against real lateral movement! Dhawan never let his technical weaknesses, and an early tendency to chase the ball, weigh him down in big ICC events, and that’s all that matters.He featured prominently in some memorable moments in Indian cricket, making him one of its most popular characters. Now, there’s no need to hang on. There’s a lesson he can still offer to the Shubman Gills, Yashasvi Jaiswals and Rishabh Pants, who will now carry the flame forward. Clarity of mind is everything. And playing with a smile helps.","Shikhar Dhawan announced his international and domestic retirement on Saturday.

An undisputable champion of ICC ODI events

NEW DELHI: Former Indian men's cricket team opener, Shikhar Dhawan announced his retirement from international cricket on Saturday, drawing curtains upon his career spanning over a decade and 269 matches, where he scored 10,867 runs at an average close to 40. He last appeared for India in an ODI against Bangladesh in Chattogram in December 2022.Dhawan announced his retirement in a post on social media.In a video message, Dhawan said, ""It is important to turn the page to move forward in life and that's why I am announcing my retirement from international and domestic cricket... I am leaving with peace in my heart that I played for so long for India. I tell myself not to feel sad that you will not play for India anymore, but to feel happy that you played for your country.""Although making debut for the senior men's Indian team in 2010, Dhawan made his first mark in international cricket in 2013, in his Test debut against the mighty Australians in Mohali. He scored an 85-ball hundred, fastest by a debutant, and went on to score 187 runs in the innings.However, his most stellar career stats came in One Day Internationals (ODIs). In 164 innings of 167 ODIs, Shikhar scored 6,793 runs at an impressive average of 44.11 and with a strike rate of 91.35. He became the second-fastest Indian to score 6000 runs in ODIs, only behindVirat Kohli . Dhawan achieved this feat in only 143 matches. He retires as one of only eight batters who have amassed over 5000 runs in the ODIs while maintaining an average above 40 and a strike rate exceeding 90.But as he announced his retirement after being dropped from the Indian team for over a year and faded away unnoticed, the question that remains is: Once considered a modern-day great, what will be the legacy of Shikhar Dhawan? What 'Gabbar' of Indian cricket will be remembered for? The answer lies in his consistent and valuable performance in ICC tournaments, particularly ICC ODI events, World cup and Champions trophy.Long before making debut for the senior India team, Shikhar showcased his skills at Under-19 level. At the Under-19 World cup in Bangladesh in 2004, Dhawan finished as the highest run-getter in the tournament. He scored 505 runs with a strike rate of 93.51 and an average of 84.16.Dhawan hit a total of three centuries and a half-century in the tournament and, although India lost to Pakistan in the semi-finals, he was named as Player of the Tournament. With 505 runs, Dhawan held the record of most runs in a single edition of Under-19 World cup until 2022, when South Africa's Dewald Brevis broke it by scoring one more run.England & Wales hosted the Champions trophy in 2013. Before the Champions trophy, Dhawan played 5 ODIs for India between 2010 and 2011, having scored a mere 69 runs. However, his terrific performance in Test matches against Australia, in 2013, got him his place back into the ODI side.Stats wise, 2013 was Dhawan's best year in ODIs as he scored 1162 runs in 26 matches at an average of 50.52 with the strike rate of 97.89. So he didn't just score runs, he scored them quickly. The cherry on top was his performance in 2013 CT.After 2011, Dhawan got back into the ODI side in the 2013 Champions Trophy, as he was entrusted with the responsibility to open for India in the Champions Trophy. He grabbed the opportunity with both hands and scored 363 runs, most in the tournament, in just 5 outings.Dhawan began his campaign with consecutive centuries against South Africa and West Indies, respectively. He then scored 48 against Pakistan, 68 against Sri Lanka, and in the rain-affected finals against host England he played a match-winning knock, scoring 31 off 24 balls.His best knock came in the opening match of India against Proteas in Cardiff, where he smashed the likes of Morne Morkel, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Rory Kleinveldt, and Ryan McLaren all around the ground, and scored his maiden ODI century. He eventually got out on 114, which came off in just 94 balls with one six and twelve fours.With an average of 90.75 and strike rate of 101.39, Dhawan was selected as the player-of-the-tournament.After collecting the player-of-the-tournament award, Dhawan said, ""I'd dreamt of this, I'm really happy with it ... The bouncy tracks suit my game. I worked hard in practice and in the warm-up games. It makes it more special because I was out of the side for a few years.""As he became a key player in India's ODI set-up following his brilliant performance in 2013 Champions trophy, Dhawan continued his good form in ODI World cup of 2015.He started his campaign on a high note, scoring 72 runs against arch-rivals Pakistan in India's opening match at Adelaide Oval. He also scored 2 centuries in the tournament, one against South Africa at Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) and another against Ireland.His most glorious and pleasant knock of the tournament came against South Africa, again, at MCG. In all three previous encounters that India had with SA in World cups (1992, 1999, 2011), they were thrashed by the Proteas. In the 2015 World cup also, South Africa had a terrifying line-up with the likes of Steyn, Morkel, Imran Tahir, AB de Villiers , Faf, Hashim Amla, and de Kock in the team.When India elected to bat first, it needed to put pressure on SA straight away. But Rohit Sharma got run out for a duck in the third over. The occasion was big, and the team was under pressure. Dhawan stood up to the occasion, he took on all the South African bowlers and built crucial partnerships with Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane.Dhawan scored 137 runs hitting 18 boundaries during his knock, including two sixes. India emerged victorious against South Africa, for the first time in World cups, by 130 runs.Shikhar was India's top scorer in the tournament with 412 runs in 8 matches, he scored them at an average of 51.50.Shikhar's bat continued to wreak havoc on opposition teams in Champions trophy 2017. Dhawan's stellar performance in the Champions Trophy 2017 was a continuation of his form from the previous edition. He started the tournament with a solid 68 against Pakistan in the opening match.In the following game against Sri Lanka, Dhawan showcased his batting skills by scoring a brilliant century, scoring 125 runs. He continued his good form against South Africa, contributing a valuable 78.With 338 runs in 5 innings at an average of 67.60, Dhawan emerged as the top run getter in the tournament, which earned him the golden bat award for the second time in a row.India began its World cup campaign on a positive note, comfortably emerging victorious against South Africa in the first group match. The next match was against Australia at The Oval. This match was significant considering the fact that Australia ended India's World cup 2015 campaign in the semi-final.Against a formidable bowling line-up comprising Starc, Coulter-Nile, and Pat Cummins, Dhawan exhibited the batting master-class of the highest order and scored a brilliant century. He went on to score 117 runs off 109 balls, hitting 16 fours during his innings, as India defeated Australia by 36 runs.The century against Australia proved to be his last outing for India in ICC events, as he was ruled out for the rest of the tournament due to an injury.As Shikhar Dhawan decided to hang his boots, it is hard to resist the fact that he has been an absolute clutch player for India as far as ICC ODI events are concerned.Shikhar Dhawan's performance in ICC 50-over tournaments, which include ODI World Cups and Champions Trophies, has been exceptional. In the 20 innings he played in these tournaments, he scored six centuries and crossed the 50-run mark on ten occasions.Dhawan's average in these tournaments is the highest among the 51 batters who have scored a minimum of 1000 runs, slightly surpassing Virat Kohli's average of 64.55. The list includes the likes of Sir Vivian Richards, Saeed Anwar, and Kane Williamson.When considering his performances in World Cups separately, Dhawan maintained an average of 53.70 across ten innings. His Champions Trophy record is even more remarkable, with an average of 77.88 over the same number of innings.","Former Indian men's cricket team opener, Shikhar Dhawan announced his retirement from international cricket on Saturday.

Croatian midfielder Filip Mrzljak and Argentine forward Norberto Vidal restored Punjab's lead, but Australian Jason Cummings equalized again in the 79th minute, sending the match into a tie-breaker due to the absence of extra-time provisions.In the penalties, Cummings missed MBSG's first spot-kick, giving Punjab an early advantage.

As sudden death ensued, Melroy Assisi scored for Punjab FC. Subhashish Bose and Scottish defender Thomas Aldred , who scored the decisive penalty, converted for MBSG.

Other MBSG scorers in the tiebreaker included Manvir Singh, Liston Colaco, and Dimi Petratos, while Vinit Rai, Norberto Vidal, Bakenga, and Filip Mrzljak scored for Punjab FC.A wonderful 1-2 between Luka and Vinit saw the latter in the clear inside the Mariners penalty area and as he was about to strike, Spanish central defender Alberto Martin was adjudged to have brought him down. The Shers’ talisman made no mistake with the spot-kick. The equaliser came at the stroke of half-time. Liston initiated it as he had been for the entire half with his forays down the left. On this occasion, he cut inside and laid it on for Greg Stewart whose first-time strike took a deflection off Suhail lurking just outside the six-yard box and wrongfooted Ravi to trickle in.Manvir was the first of the substitutes to make an immediate impact when Sahal set him up with a through ball on the right after having received a pass from the young and talented Abhishek.

Bakenga produced the dummy run from the centre as the Croat found Vidal in the clear with his run from the left. The diminutive Argentine, who had come close just after coming on, this time beat Vishal Kaith with a clinical left-footer.It was then the turn of the Mariners to equalise as Liston’s cross was headed down by Manvir for Cummings to finish expertly with a left-footed volley which bulged the roof of the net. That led to the tie-breaker which resulted in heart-break for Punjab FC.",Defending champions Mohun Bagan Super Giant (MBSG) overcame Punjab FC 6-5 in sudden-death penalties.

""Yes, they were closer together, but I'm not in any big rush to play those.

Instead, she returned to Britain to focus on training rather than participating in additional tournaments in preparation for her highly anticipated return to New York. In the first round of the US Open, Raducanu is set to face off against Sofia Kenin, the 2020 Australian Open champion.While some players crave match time, Raducanu said that just isn't her. The rising star's approach to tournament preparation differs from that of many of her peers, as she prioritizes targeted practice sessions over extensive match play leading up to major events.""I don't think I'll ever be the player who's playing, like, close to 30 events a year,"" she said. ""I think that's not my style. It never has been.""Emma Raducanu's 2023 season was marred by injuries, forcing her to miss a significant portion of the year due to surgeries on both wrists and an ankle. As a result, her only appearance at the U.S. Open following her historic 2021 victory as a qualifier was a first-round defeat to Alize Cornet in 2022.Despite the setbacks, Raducanu expressed a greater sense of preparedness for this year's U.S. Open. During her practice session on Friday, she had an unexpected encounter with a 7-year-old fan who had watched her play the previous day and enthusiastically proclaimed Raducanu as her favorite player.Although Raducanu had to leave quickly after the practice and couldn't meet the young fan, she took to social media to apologize and asked her followers to help locate the girl.Much to the delight of the young fan, Raducanu found her on Friday and extended an invitation to hit together on the court, creating a memorable moment for both the player and her admirer.""She barely missed a ball and she has a lot of courage to kind of go onto the court with a lot of people watching and start hitting balls, and it was nice to meet her and speak to her,"" Raducanu said. ""Obviously I felt incredibly bad about yesterday but I feel good and I feel happy that I was able to connect with her today.""Emma Raducanu is well aware that her career decisions have drawn skepticism from those who doubt her ability to secure another U.S. Open title. However, the sight of her name etched on the trophy and her image displayed alongside past champions serves as a powerful reminder of her previous triumph and her potential to achieve such greatness once more.""I think that's such an epic achievement and these two weeks I completed it,"" she said.

"Novak Djokovic targets Slam record at US Open, Jannik Sinner under cloud",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/novak-djokovic-targets-slam-record-at-us-open-jannik-sinner-under-cloud/articleshow/112699883.cms,"- 'Biggest success' -

NEW DELHI: Novak Djokovic , energized by his triumphant performance at the Olympic Games, aims to break new Grand Slam records at the US Open starting Monday. Meanwhile, his main rival, Jannik Sinner , arrives in New York facing scrutiny over two positive drug tests.If Djokovic secures a fifth title, he can become the oldest Open era champion at the tournament, sharing the record with Jimmy Connors, Pete Sampras, and Roger Federer.A victory would also elevate him to 25 Grand Slam triumphs, surpassing the 24 he currently shares with Margaret Court.This year has been challenging for Djokovic, as Sinner succeeded him as the Australian Open champion and took over his world number one ranking. Additionally, Carlos Alcaraz claimed Djokovic's French Open title and dominated him in a one-sided Wimbledon final.However, Djokovic made a remarkable comeback on the clay courts of Roland Garros, stunning Alcaraz in the Olympic final. His emotional victory in Paris allowed him to join an elite group of only five players to complete a career Golden Slam, winning all four majors and an Olympic gold medal.The victory silenced the growing number of skeptics who had dismissed the Serb as a fading force in a new era dominated by the 23-year-old Sinner and 21-year-old Alcaraz.Djokovic, who underwent knee surgery in June, described his Olympic victory as his ""biggest sporting success"" and the 99th title of his professional career.""At the age of 37 and facing a 21-year-old who is probably the best player in the world right now, winning Roland Garros and Wimbledon back-to-back, I can say that this is probably the biggest sporting success I have ever had,"" insisted Djokovic.Sinner, the rising Italian tennis star, enters the US Open, the final Grand Slam event of the year, fresh off his victory at the Cincinnati Masters. The young player's impressive performance on the court, however, was quickly overshadowed by recent revelations regarding his drug tests.Earlier in the season, Sinner tested positive on two separate occasions for clostebol, ""an anabolic agent prohibited at all times by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)."" The news raised concerns about the athlete's integrity and the fairness of his competitions.Despite the positive tests, Sinner managed to avoid a prolonged suspension from the sport. Officials ultimately accepted his explanation that the banned substance had inadvertently entered his system due to contamination from a member of his support team.This decision allowed him to continue competing, but the incident has cast a shadow over his recent successes on the court.""I will now put this challenging and deeply unfortunate period behind me,"" said Sinner.","Novak Djokovic aims to break new Grand Slam records at the US Open starting Monday.
