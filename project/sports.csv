NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli has once again set social media abuzz with an announcement on X (formerly Twitter), sharing a new chapter in his journey off-the-field.Kohli, who has been synonymous with both cricketing excellence and inspiring leadership, announced his partnership with Sporting Beyond, expressing enthusiasm for this fresh start.“I am excited to announce a fresh start with Sporting Beyond, my new team, who have been working with me for a while now,” Kohli wrote.“The team at Sporting Beyond shares my goals and values of transparency, integrity, and a love for sport, in all its forms. This opens a new chapter for me as I look forward to my partnership with my new team, who will be working with me on all of my business interests.""This year, it has been a rollercoaster ride for Kohli on the field. While he celebrated a few historic milestones, Kohli has also faced struggles of late.The right-handed batting maestro missed the England Tests early in 2024 but came back strong to help India secure the T20 World Cup in Barbados.However, his form has been inconsistent, particularly in the recent Test series against New Zealand, where he managed low scores, which contributed to India’s 3-0 series defeat.Recently, his rankings also dropped, leaving him ranked 22nd in the latest ICC Test rankings , below Pakistan’s Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan.As India prepare for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , Kohli’s form remains a focal point.Known for his fierce performances and awe-inspiring records against Australia, Kohli’s experience and aggressive style have often been crucial in neutralizing Australia’s powerful bowling.Now, all eyes will be on him to reignite that spark and lead India's batting acumen in what is going to be a crucial series in the context of the ICC World Test Championship (WTC) finals.",Virat Kohli announces partnership with Sporting Beyond.

BRIEF SCORES

NAGPUR: It was the day of professionals at VCA Civil Lines Stadium . Unbeaten knocks by Dhruv Shorey and Karun Nair put Vidarbha firmly on top in their Ranji Trophy match against Himachal on Thursday.At the start of Day 2 of the Elite Group 'B' clash, Himachal, having posted 307 all out in the morning session, were slightly ahead. Vidarbha, though, wrested the initiative thanks to batters — led by Shorey and Nair — putting up a solid performance.By the time stumps were drawn on Day 2, Vidarbha were 283 for 2 in 70 overs. Shorey's 108 not out (192b;6x4) and Nair's unbeaten 76 (115b;9x4) ensured that the hosts were just 24 runs adrift of Himachal's first innings total.Right from the start, Vidarbha batters showed the right intent. Opener Atharva Taide (33;42b;6x4) started on a brisk note to take Vidarbha to 50 for no loss by lunch. Post Taide's dismissal on the second ball of the second session, Danish Malewar took on the responsibility of keeping the scoreboard ticking at a fair clip. The 21-year-old Malewar essayed a stroke-filled knock laced with 10 boundaries.After racing to 59 off 72 balls, Malewar was caught at midwicket off Ashish Vashisht's delivery as the batter tried to hit his 11th boundary. Malewar scored at a strike rate of close to 82, the highest in Vidarbha innings on Thursday, to post his third half century in as many First Class matches.The Mokhade dismissal was the last celebration Himachal bowlers could manage on Day 2. The Shorey-Nair partnership dictated terms for the rest one-and-half sessions.Shorey posted his second First Class century for Vidarbha, 13th of his career. At the other end, Nair scored his 35th First Class fifty. With eight wickets still intact, Vidarbha will hope to extend their innings for most part of Day 3 to bat Himachal out of the contest.Prior to Vidarbha's solid batting display, young left-arm spinner Harsh Dubey posted his third five-wicket haul in his 12th First Class match. Thanks to Dubey's five-for, Himachal's first inning, starting on overnight 263 for 6, folded at 307 in 108 overs. Off spinner Akshay Wakhare and medium pacer Praful Hinge finished with two wickets each. Skipper Rishi Dhawan (73;135b;9x4) was top scorer for Himachal.Himachal (Overnight 263 for 6 in 90 overs): 307 all out in 108 overs (Rishi Dhawan 73, Ekant Sen 44, Mukul Negi 38; Harsh Dubey 5-71, Akshay Wakhare 2-43, Praful Hinge 2-57) lead Vidarbha: 283 for 2 in 70 overs (Dhruv Shorey 108 batting, Karun Nair 76 batting, Danish Malewar 59, Atharva Taide 33; Vaibhav Arora 1-49, Mukul Negi 1-42) by 24 runs.","Dhruv Shorey and Karun Nair put Vidarbha firmly on top in their Ranji Trophy match against Himachal on Thursday.

That helped me sort of shore up some game plans and work on a few positions that I wanted to,"" Ravindra said following his sessions with CSK.The situation brings to light a unique question about franchise responsibilities versus national priorities in the world of modern cricket .India now face the challenge of regrouping before a demanding series against Australia starting on November 22 in Perth.","Robin Uthappa slams Chennai Super Kings for providing New Zealand's Rachin Ravindra with training facilities ahead of their three-match series against India.

The Team Is Heavily Reliant On Bumrah's Genius But In The Absence Of Shami, Can The Rest Of The Faster Men, Including Siraj, Rise To The Occasion?

India A continue to struggle in Australia | KL Rahul disappoints again | #BeyondTheBoundary

During the last tour of Australia in 2020-21, Indian cricket appeared to have unveiled an enviable pool of fast bowlers. Two years before that, Jasprit Bumrah Mohammed Shami and Ishant Sharma formed a menacing pace-bowling attack that took the fight to the hosts.This week, though, as the Indian team leaves in batches for Australia, there's a sense of anxiety around the pace attack. Bumrah may be the leading pacer in international cricket but his support cast of Mohammed Siraj , Akash Deep, Prasidh Krishna and Harshit Rana looks undercooked. Siraj's form adds to the concern. The selectors have picked five pacers in the main team along with three travelling reserves for the five-Test long tour. Yet, picking two effective seamers to complement Bumrah remains a big challenge going into a series that will decide India's fate in the World Test Championship (WTC).One may argue that India emerged triumphant on the last tour Down Under despite being without Shami, Ishant and Umesh for the most part, before Bumrah too broke down ahead of the final Test in Brisbane. However, unlike 2020-21, the support cast of faster bowlers doesn't inspire the same confidence. Devang Gandhi, who served as national selector for both previous tours, says there was so much clarity on the last tour about the second line of players.""Navdeep Saini, Siraj and Shardul Thakur were finished products by the time they made their debuts for India. The robust India 'A' programme under Rahul Dravid helped them to be prepared for conditions around the world. This time there's kind of a lack of experience on that front. When the pacers were on song in the last two tours, it reduced pressure on the batters to get big scores. Scores of 300-plus were enough to put the opposition under pressure,"" Gandhi told TOI.Talking about India's famed developmental programmes, former India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey, who was Dravid's trusted lieutenant for almost decade, said it usually takes five years to prepare a crop of pacers but one must not put a timeline on individual bowlers.""If you talk about the current set of pacers, one must know that there have been bowlers who picked up the art of sustaining themselves at the highest level in a few weeks, while there have been others who needed more time to mature. The key is to have patience with the players picked,"" said Mhambrey. Harshit Rana and Prasidh Krishna are just 10 and 20 first-class matches old and have been picked ahead of Mukesh Kumar, who has played a huge role in Bengal doing well in the Ranji Trophy for the last five years. Sources told TOI that head coach Gautam Gambhir was adamant on keeping Rana in the Test team. There has also been debate over persisting with Saini as a reserve pacer.Gandhi, who coached Rana in Delhi last year, fears the team management may have missed a chance to give him more time to acclimatize. ""Harshit is very promising and a brave cricketer. He doesn't shy away from challenges. But had he been in Australia with the India A team right now, he would have got more time to understand the lengths and how to bowl with the Kookaburra ball. Mind you, you may have to rest Bumrah in the middle of such a long series. Saini doesn't look to be at his best and his economy is a major concern,"" Gandhi said.This is where all eyes will be trained on Siraj, hardened through the 'A' programme, who emerged as India's next leader of pace attack on the last tour. But he travels to Australia in search of rediscovering himself after a rather dull home season.Yet, Mhambrey doesn't mind putting his money on Siraj. ""You have to back him. He has the art of taking wickets and the experience of bowling around the world. His rhythm seems to be bothering him right now. But he is experienced enough to know that he needs to do a lot of bowling to get it back,"" said Mhambrey. Could it be the added pressure of delivering as a lead pacer in the absence of Shami? ""I don't think so. The pressure may affect his consistency with line and length. But once he finds his rhythm, all of that will be taken care of. He knows you have to stick to a plan and line in Australia.""Krishna was a kind of a pet project for Dravid and Mhambrey when they were working with the Indian team and decided to move on from an ageing Ishant. ""Prasidh's ability to generate bounce from a fuller length is his USP. When he is on song, he is very tough to play. The Kookaburra ball flattens out by the 35th over. That's when you need someone to hold an end and someone to do something extra like Bumrah does,"" Mhambrey said.Rohit Sharma's team is under pressure. And it may come down to the inexperienced pace attack to turn things around Down Under.","Jasprit Bumrah is the leading pacer in international cricket. But his support cast of Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep, Prasidh Krishna and Harshit Rana looks undercooked.

Our bowling was not up to the mark. Our spinners, especially the experienced ones, didn't gave a great series. Batting, without a doubt, we lack in ability to play spin.

MUMBAI: Shreyas Iyer 's brilliant double century (233 off 228 balls) for Mumbai against Odisha on Day Two of their Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match at the Sharad Pawar Cricket Academy has put the defending champions in an impregnable position.Sidelined from India's Test team, Shreyas blazed away to his highest first-class score and reached his third double hundred in the format and the first in seven years when he tonked Debabrata Pradhan for a four over his head. His previous double tons came against Punjab in 2015 and versus against Australia (at CCI) in 2017.The double hundred, which came at a strike rate of 102.19, followed his 142 against Maharashtra last month. The Mumbaikar is currently the third-highest run-scorer in the ongoing Ranji Trophy season, having amassed 405 runs in four innings at an average of 101.25.On Thursday, continuing from his overnight score of 152, Iyer took just 37 balls to bring up his double century off 201 balls. He struck 24 fours and smoked nine sixes during his knock.The 29-year-old forged a record 354-run partnership for the fourth wicket-—Mumbai's highest for this wicket-—with Siddhesh Lad , who capped off a dream comeback for Mumbai with an unbeaten 169 (337b, 17x4). This is Lad's career-best score in first-class cricket. Together, Lad and Iyer dismantled Odisha's attack, as the visitors tried as many as eight bowlers.“Shreyas is back in form. We expect a lot from him. It's good for Mumbai and him that he's knocking on the door of the Indian team again. I feel that if he was there against New Zealand, his skills against the spinners would've made a difference. However, I'm sure the selectors would be watching his performance,” Lad said.After Iyer was finally out 33 minutes before lunch, Suryansh Shedge put the IPL franchises on notice with an unbeaten 79 off 36 balls. Mumbai declared at 602/4 before their bowlers reduced Odisha to 146/5.Cherishing his comeback, Lad confessed he thought he was done with first-class cricket after his Goa stint. The 32-year-old thanked head coach Omkar Salvi for his successful Mumbai return.""The story starts from June in the pre-season camp in Alur. I didn't believe in myself as much as our team management.

India A continue to struggle in Australia | KL Rahul disappoints again | #BeyondTheBoundary

Dhruv Jurel joined the India A team in Melbourne only a couple of days ago. On Thursday, when he walked out to bat in the second and final 'unofficial' Test against Australia A at the MCG, his team was staring at humiliation. The India A top-four was removed in no time as the visitors slumped to 11-4 by just the third over and had their back against the wall.But India A found a saviour in Jurel, who joined the squad along with KL Rahul after India's Test series against New Zealand ended on Sunday. Playing his first long-format match Down Under, the 23-year-old did not look out of place on a pace-friendly track; he batted with assurance and delivered a fighting 80 (186 balls; 6x4, 2x6).On a day when the top-order batters, including opener Rahul, danced to the tune of the Aussie pacers, Jurel tackled the quicks with a knock of substance, single-handedly guiding the tourists to 161 in their first innings. In response, Australia A stood at 53-2 at stumps.Following his battling performance in challenging conditions, Jurel will definitely be one of the contenders for a spot in the XI when India play Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy opener in Perth from November 22. Operating with great temperament and mixing caution with aggression on Thursday, he displayed an array of strokes, be it back-foot punches, square cuts, cover drives, flicks or pull shots. The one that stood out was the upper-cut that he played off Michael Neser over the slips' head for a four — it was a reminder to the team management that one thing the Uttar Pradesh player does not lack is courage.With Sarfaraz Khan failing in four back-to-back innings against New Zealand, the No. 6 slot in the India team has opened up. That Jurel, also a wicketkeeper, was made to travel early indicates that he is very much in the scheme of things for the marquee five-match assignment.Former India opener and national selector Devang Gandhi said that Jurel has the ability to fight it out on demanding tracks. ""Jurel did not have much time to train ahead of the Australia A match. Despite being a last-minute inclusion and not having enough preparation, he showed what he is capable of,"" Gandhi told TOI.While Gandhi backed the inclusion of Jurel in the XI, he said that the management may opt for the experience of Rahul if he is in a direct fight with the Karnataka man. ""If Rahul is promoted to the top of the order in the absence of Rohit Sharma, Jurel should bat at No. 6. If Rohit is available, Rahul should be the first-choice No. 6. In that case, Jurel should be a very good back-up who can be used during the course of the series,"" added Gandhi.During the home Test series against Bangladesh in September-October, India head coach Gautam Gambhir referred to Jurel as a ""phenomenal player"" and said that he will have to wait for opportunities since Rishabh Pant is the clear first-choice wicketkeeper-batter. But with skipper Rohit admitting recently that Pant's workload has to be ""managed carefully"", Jurel may have a role to play behind the stumps as well.India A 161 in 57.1 overs (Jurel 80; Neser 4-27) vs Aus A 53-2 in 17.1 overs.",Dhruv Jurel scored an unbeaten 80 in India A's first innings against Australia A.

BENGALURU: A few seasons ago, V Koushik was dropped from the Ranji Trophy probables. The KSCA selection think-tank deemed him too old — he was approaching 30 then. Another argument with reasonable justification was his lack of pace — his fastest hovered around 130kmph. But a crucial factor the selectors often missed was that the mechanical engineer used precision and discipline to make up for his lack of pace.Koushik forced his way back into the team with a happy combination of solid performances in the state league and the unavailability of other pacers. Over the past two seasons, he has become the third cog in Karnataka’s pace attack with Vidwath Kaverappa and Vyshak Vijaykumar taking the top two slots.With Kaverappa and Vyshak unavailable Koushik has led Karnataka’s pace attack — and how — in the Ranji Trophy fixture against Bengal. On Thursday at the M Chinnaswamy stadium , the 32-year-old snagged the third five-wicket haul (5/38 in 25 overs) of his career to help the hosts bowl out Bengal for 301 on Day 2.Koushik soldiered on despite the lack of support. Abhilash Shetty, making his debutant, lacked rhythm while Vidhyadhar Patil sprayed the ball around. Leggie Shreyas Gopal was his ally with a three-wicket haul, which ensured Bengal added only 50 runs to their overnight tally.Among the batters too, Karnataka found a saviour, whose story is similar to that of Koushik’s. Branded a T20 specialist with big-hitting skills, Abhinav Manohar was ignored for the red-ball variety until the previous game against Bihar. In Patna, he offered a glimpse of how he could convert his white-ball skills into red-ball assets.Against Bengal, as the more established players gifted their wickets away, the middle-order bat put fear into the Bengal bowlers during his unbeaten 73-ball 50 (6x4; 1x6). The knock helped ease nerves, although the sword still hung heavy. At stumps, Karnataka were 155/5, still 146 runs in deficit.The narrative could have been very different for the home team on a cloudy day if they had not lost wickets in a heap. Sujay Sateri, Mayank Agarwal and Manish Pandey all perished for the addition of a mere 11 runs.Sateri was looking to cut pacer R Vivek (2/44) but only offered an edge which wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha gleefully pouched. Agarwal, who lived dangerously early in his innings, did well to see off the new ball with Kishan Bedare, who came in as a concussion substitute for an injured Nikin Jose. But just when he was settling in, Agarwal chopped a Suraj Jaiswal (2/53) delivery onto his stumps, ending his stay.With the home side tottering at 63/4, the onus was on Pandey but the seasoned campaigner lasted all of two deliveries, a half-hearted loft off Vivek finding Shuvam Dey at mid-on.This brought Abhinav out and he immediately got down to business. Timing is the hallmark of a batsman in form and Abhinav’s was impeccable. Anything in the slot was quickly dispatched to the fence — usually all along the ground.His partnership with R Smaran (26) helped calm nerves, but it ended at 34 when Smaran mis-timed a cut and was taken by Sudip Chatterjee at first slip. It’s tempting to say Karnataka batters were done in by poor shot selection, but Bengal’s bowlers were disciplined and hit the deck consistently which made Abhinav’s knock even more valuable. He built an unconquered 58-run association with Sheyas Gopal (23 batting), which offered Karnataka hope.",V Koushik takes third five-wicket haul of his career to help hosts bowl out Bengal for 301 on Day 2.

Brief score:

JAIPUR: Rajasthan's strength lies in their seam attack, but it had negligible influence on the first two days of the Elite Group B Ranji Trophy contest underway at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium here. Instead it was their lone full-time spinner Ajay Kookna who held the fort and forged his way to his fifth five-wicket haul, 47-3-139-5, in First Class cricket. But the hosts failed to pierce through the defense of Hyderabad’s Rahul Radesh whose 100 off 268 balls helped Hyderabad post a commanding first innings score of 410 all out in 144 overs.Coming out to bat, Rajasthan lost opener Ram Chouhan early, but Abhijeet Tomar and Mahipal Lomror helped the hosts cruise to 117/1 in 31 overs at the time of stumps. Though Tomar, 44 off 96 balls, took a while to get going, Lomror was quick to attack the bowlers. He mostly dealt in fours and sixes to score an unbeaten 58 off 61. He struck 7 fours and 3 sixes.Earlier, playing his sixth Ranji match, this was 21-year-old Radesh’s maiden First Class century which included seven fours.After resuming at the overnight score of 261/5, Radesh's unhurried knock had ample support of tailenders Chama Milind (48 off 77 balls), Tanay Thyagarajan (22 off 44 balls), Aniketh Reddy (16 off 30) and No. 11 Rakshan Readdi.Readdi was mindful of his partner approaching the three figures and managed to survive 28 deliveries without scoring a run.It is the first time in the 2024-25 season that a team has scored in excess of 400 against Rajasthan.With pitch likely to deteriorate on Day Three, Rajasthan have a task on hand as they trail by 293 runs.Radesh says hard work paid off: Falling six runs short of a hundred during Hyderabad’s game against Uttarakhand, Radesh is happy that he could capitalise on the opportunity this time. “I missed out on the century in our second match against Uttarakhand. I got out at 94 in the first innings. I am really happy that this time I could convert the score into three figures. I am really happy to have reached the milestone. Finally my efforts have paid off,” the Hyderabad keeper-batter said after the day’s play.Hyderabad 410 all out in 144 overs (Tanmay Agarwal 40, Rahul Singh Gahlaut 66, Rahul Radesh 100, Chama Milind 48; Ajay Kookna 5-139, Deepak Chahar 2-60) vs Rajasthan 117/1 in 31 overs (Abhijeet Tomar 44 not out, Mahipal Lomror 58 not out; Ajay Dev Goud 1-26).","Rajasthan lost opener Ram Chouhan early, but Abhijeet Tomar and Mahipal Lomror helped the hosts cruise to 117/1 in 31 overs at the time of stumps.

The 26-year-old defender scored a brace for Haryana in their 12-1 victory over Himachal Pradesh in the Hockey India Senior Men National Championship Pool B encounter here on Wednesday.Two months ago, Joginder was the top goal scorer (six goals) for champions Indian Railways in the all India MCC-Murugappa Hockey tournament in Chennai. Joginder was instrumental in Railways defending their title. On Wednesday, it took Joginder just five minutes to open his account and scored another in the 30th minute.“This is a lucky ground for me. I was the best defender in the Murugappa tournament and to come back and play here again is very special. I hope to perform well in the nationals and make a mark in the national circuit,” Joginder told TOI.Joginder’s performances in domestic tournaments did not go unnoticed as he was picked up by Delhi SG Pipers in the recent Hockey India League (HIL) auction. “This is a career-defining opportunity, and it is the right time to prove myself. The HIL is a very big platform and playing alongside international players will help me gain experience,” Joginder said.Hailing from Hisar, Joginder received an opportunity to play for Melbourne Sikhs United club in the Men’s Vic League 1 competition in Victoria. Joginder trained under Olympian Waseem Ahmed, who has over 400 plus international appearances for Pakistan.“I played in Melbourne from April to September last year. Waseem guided me on improving my defence and PCs, and taught me on how to handle situations on the field. The major learning from Australia is that I have understood to stay patient.

A good all-round effort by the Assam bowlers followed by the batters’ steady reply put the hosts in a strong position in their fourth-round match of Ranji Trophy against Tamil Nadu in Guwahati on Wednesday.The match, which resumed on Day 2 with Tamil Nadu at 299/7, saw their innings conclude at 338 in the morning session. The hosts, led by captain Denish Das and Rishav Das , who both scored 54, ended the day at 176/3 from 68 overs, trailing Tamil Nadu by 162 runs in an Elite Group D clash at Barsapara Cricket Stadium.The day began with Tamil Nadu’s overnight batters pushing the score past the 300-mark. However, their innings wrapped up quickly, adding only 39 runs to their overnight total. Mohamed Ali, who was on the brink of a half-century, was left stranded at 49, as Tamil Nadu’s last three wickets fell for a mere four runs.Assam bowlers, particularly Mrinmoy Dutta and Mukhtar Hussain, played a crucial role in halting Tamil Nadu’s progress, each taking vital wickets in the morning session.In response, Assam openers Parvej Musaraf and Rishav Das provided a solid start, putting up a 49-run partnership for the first wicket. Despite the loss of Musaraf (18) and Subham Mandal (16), who failed to capitalise on their starts, the Das duo steadied the innings. Denish, alongside veteran Sibsankar Roy, who is batting on 23, ensured the home side ended the day without further damage, crafting a 71-run stand for the unbroken fourth wicket.Tamil Nadu bowlers, Gurjapneet Singh, Sonu Yadav, and Ali, managed to claim a wicket each, but struggled to break the Das-Roy partnership for almost 33 overs as the duo saw off the entire third session. With Assam trailing by 162 runs and the pitch showing no demons, the third day promises to be crucial as Assam aims for a crucial first-innings lead.The match has been a display of strategic cricket from both sides, with Assam bowlers showing a commendable effort to restrict Tamil Nadu to 338. As the match heads into its vital stages, both teams will look to assert their dominance and secure vital points in this Elite Group D encounter.Tamil Nadu (o/n 299/7) 338 in 98.4 overs (Mohamed Ali 49 n.o., Swarupam Purkayastha 2/33).

Victor Osimhen scored twice as Galatasaray inflicted a first Europa League defeat of the season on Tottenham with a 3-2 victory in Istanbul on Thursday, while Manchester United got their first win on the board by beating PAOK Thessaloniki.The Turkish champions have 10 points from four games and have all but secured qualification for at least the knock-out play-off round, while Spurs sit in seventh place after losing their 100-percent record.""We expected it to be a difficult match.

ISTANBUL: Manchester United earned their first Europa League win with a 2-0 victory over PAOK, Tottenham Hotspur 's perfect start ended with a 3-2 loss at Galatasaray and Lazio top the standings after a 2-1 victory over Porto on Thursday.Ajax strolled to a 5-0 win over Maccabi Tel Aviv, Athletic Bilbao came from behind to beat Ludogorets 2-1 and Anderlecht were denied joining Lazio on top as a late own goal left them with a draw in Latvia at RFS.A brace from Amad Diallo gave United their first success in this season's competition, coming under interim manager Ruud van Nistelrooy after they had drawn the previous three games with Erik ten Hag was in charge.Amad's first came five minutes after the break when he met a Bruno Fernandes cross with a looping header which found the far corner, and he added a solo second 13 minutes from time.United have six points in the standings, three behind Spurs who despite going down to 10 men almost made a dramatic comeback in Istanbul where Victor Osimhen scored twice for the hosts and Will Lankshear grabbed his first goal for Spurs before being sent off.Yunus Akgun gave Galatasaray an early lead with a stunning half-volley but Spurs levelled when Brennan Johnson's layoff across the goal left Lankshear with a simple tap-in.Radu Dragusin was caught napping at the back in the 31st minute and was dispossessed by Mauro Icardi. The ball fell to Dries Mertens who slipped a pass to Osimhen and the Nigerian striker found the bottom corner.Osimhen struck again six minutes from the break and Lankshear received his second booking on the hour mark, but 10-man Tottenham pulled a goal back when substitute Dominic Solanke back-heeled Pedro Porro's cross into the net.Lazio made it four wins from four to take control at the top of the standings thanks to an added-time goal from Pedro.The Italian side went ahead at the end of the first half through Alessio Romagnoli's header but Porto drew level through Stephen Eustaquio.It looked like Lazio would have to settle for a draw but with time running out Pedro turned a cross from Gustav Isaksen into the net.Anderlecht could have joined them on 12 points, with Mario Stroeykens putting them ahead five minutes from time but RFS snatched a draw deep into added time when Moussa N'diaye put the ball into his own net.Bilbao moved on to 10 points with their comeback win in Bulgaria against Ludogorets after Inaki Williams and Nicolas Serrano scored second-half goals in quick succession.Ajax are also on 10 after cruising to victory over Maccabi with goals from Bertrand Traore, Kenneth Taylor, Mika Godts, Brian Brobbey and Kian Fitz-Jim.Eintracht Frankfurt overcame Slavia Prague 1-0 thanks to Omar Marmoush's goal direct from a free kick and they remain two points behind Lazio.AS Roma were held to a 1-1 draw at Union Saint-Gilloise where Gianluca Mancini put the Italians ahead before Kevin MacAllister equalised for the Belgian side, which leaves the Italians down in 20th on five points.","Manchester United earn first Europa League win with 2-0 win over PAOK.

Instead, he visited Stockholm with his associates for a brief holiday.Following his Swedish visit, local media outlets reported an investigation into alleged rape charges. Mbappe dismissed these reports as ""fake news"", while his legal representative announced intentions to pursue libel action.A Swedish prosecutor verified that an investigation was underway, though Mbappe's name was not specifically mentioned.Subsequently, the former Paris Saint-Germain striker has participated in four matches for his club, scoring once.

Al Ain have parted ways with head coach Hernan Crespo , just six months after celebrating an AFC Champions League title . The decision follows a string of disappointing results, culminating in a heavy 5-1 defeat to Cristiano Ronaldo 's Al Nassr in the Asian Champions League group stage.“Recent results have not been up to expectations,” explained the club in an official statement released on Wednesday.Al Ain confirmed that a replacement for Crespo will be announced soon.Crespo, a former Argentine international striker known for his time at clubs like Chelsea and Inter Milan, joined Al Ain in November 2022. He quickly made an impact, leading the team to victory in the AFC Champions League this past May after defeating Japan's Yokohama F. Marinos in the final.However, the team's form dipped significantly starting in late September, with the loss to Al Nassr proving to be the final straw for Crespo's tenure. Ronaldo himself was among the scorers in the lopsided match, a result that leaves the defending champions at the bottom of their group with a single point from four matches.Al Ain's domestic campaign in the UAE Pro League has also been challenging. They currently sit in eighth place in the 14-team league, having earned just eight points from five matches. This puts them ten points behind league leaders Shabab Al Ahli.The search for a new manager is already underway as Al Ain aims to turn around their season both domestically and in the prestigious Asian Champions League.","Al Ain have parted ways with head coach Hernan Crespo.

VILLA SLIDE

BAYERN AND DINAMO

NEXT UP

Barcelona and Inter Milan won again in the Champions League on Wednesday though both former title-holders are looking up in the standings toward upstart newcomer Brest.Aston Villa started the week atop the 36-team table but their winning run ended after a bizarre penalty was awarded when defender Tyrone Mings picked up the ball in the area at Club Brugge, resulting in a 1-0 loss that sent the English club plummeting to eighth place.Paris Saint-Germain , in their first season without Kylian Mbappe, trail far behind in 25th after Atletico Madrid scored in stoppage time to seal a 2-1 win for the Spanish team at Parc des Princes.Barcelona’s blistering scoring form continued in a 5-2 win at Red Star Belgrade — a seventh straight win since the start of October at a rate of four goals per game. Robert Lewandowski scored twice and has 21 this season.Inter Milan stifled Arsenal in a 1-0 win at San Siro sealed by Hakan Çalhanoğlu’s penalty in first-half stoppage time.Inter are unbeaten on 10 points and in fifth place, one below Brest who won 2-1 at Sparta Prague. The French debutants look sure to advance to the knockout phase starting in February.Atalanta won 2-0 at Stuttgart to stay unbeaten on eight points and Salzburg got their first goals and points in a 3-1 win at Feyenoord.Bayern Munich won 1-0 at home to Benfica in a game that was delayed 15 minutes by crowd congestion and then was played in a muted atmosphere because of a medical incident for a fan.Shakhtar Donetsk playmaker Heorhiy Sudakov had a fine assist and an even better goal in a 2-1 win for the Ukrainian champion against Young Boys. Shakhtar’s No. 10 showed why he is expected to be the club’s next big-money sale.Liverpool, who on Tuesday routed Bayer Leverkusen 4-0, lead the standings at the midway point of the eight-round program.Liverpool is the only team with four straight wins, while five teams have four losses. They are Leipzig, Sturm Graz, Young Boys, Red Star and Slovan Bratislava.Two Italian teams – Inter Milan and Atalanta – have yet to concede a goal in four games. Another Italian side, Bologna, is the only team with no goals scored.Villa had led the standings in the new league-phase format after three straight wins without conceding a goal — and it took a bizarre incident before goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez was eventually beaten.Mings was punished for picking up the ball when Martínez seemed to restart play with a goal kick passed forward to his teammate. Mings walked a couple steps to gather the ball with his left hand and returned to place it in the six-yard box.""It’s the biggest mistake I witnessed in my career,” Villa coach Unai Emery said. “It has only happened one time in all my life. Today.”Brugge captain Hans Vanaken placed the 52nd-minute spot-kick to Martínez's left as the World Cup-winning Argentina goalkeeper dived to his right.It was the standout result of the inaugural week of the new Champions League in September: Bayern Munich 9, Dinamo Zagreb 2.It was the first time a team had scored nine times in a game in the 32-year Champions League era, and Dinamo fired its coach two days later.Since then? Bayern lost twice, including a 4-1 rout at Barcelona, and Dinamo won twice. At the end of play Wednesday, Bayern was 17th on six points, one place below Dinamo on seven. If those placings hold until January, they meet again twice more in the knockout playoffs round.The fifth round in three weeks' time has perhaps the stellar attraction of 144 games in the league phase: Liverpool vs Real Madrid.That game on November 27 is a rematch of the 2022 and 2018 finals, both won by Madrid, and the 1981 European Cup title match that Liverpool won.There is another final rematch: Bayern Munich hosts PSG on November 26 in a repeat of the pandemic-season final played in August 2020 without fans in Lisbon.Also, sixth-place Barcelona host Brest, a fixture which might have been overlooked when the draw was made in August yet the French team is currently fourth.Only the top eight teams in January advance directly to the round of 16 in March.","Liverpool is the only team with four straight wins, while five teams have four losses.

On Bagan's disqualification from ACL Two

have got 22 yellow cards in just 6 games so far in this ISL. Is discipline a worry for you so early in the season?

Jose Molina loves to live in the present. This is the byword for his life.The Mohun Bagan Super Giant coach's 'weltanschauung' or world philosophy may have been influenced by a personal battle to overcome cancer 22 years ago.Even a long-term contract is not something the 54-year-old Spaniard pines for. ""For me it's a piece of paper I need to sign. I'm here because Mohun Bagan wanted me and I wanted to come. But if any one of the parties is not happy, the best thing is to shake hands and leave,"" he said rather nonchalantly.His mind is now preoccupied with the catastrophic floods back in Spain. ""I live in the north of Valencia and floods have devastated the south. All my family and friends are okay. But it's a terrible catastrophe to have happened in Spain,"" he remarked, now with a serious, somber note.Molina - a former Spanish goalkeeper who's still regarded as a hero at Atletico Madrid - is not new to Indian football. By his own admission, since guiding now defunct ATK to the 2016 ISL title, he continued to be sounded out by several Indian clubs until he said yes to Bagan's call this year.During an exclusive chat with a select media persons, including TOI, at the Mohun Bagan tent on Tuesday, Molina opened up on several key chapters of his career, from playing with the likes of Diego Simeone and Lionel Scaloni to serving the Spanish football federation as its sporting director.I was a goalkeeper but made my debut for Spain as a left-winger! During the match against Norway (a friendly held in Oslo in 1996), the coach (Javier Clemente) used up all his substitutions and when another player got injured, I was given two options - either staying on the bench or coming on as a left-winger. I played for 16 minutes. (It was) not my position but an amazing experience.My last game (he played 9 matches in all for La Roja) was also against Norway (in Euro 2000). As a goalkeeper I made a mistake and we lost 1-0. The coach (José Antonio Camacho) said after the game that I would no longer play. As a player I had to accept the coach's decision. We all make mistakes and that decision still hurts me. Because I believe that I had the talent to play for Spain longer.I was also in the 1998 World Cup squad and (Andoni) Zubizarreta was No. 1 goalkeeper. We lost the first match 3-2 to Nigeria and Zubizarreta made mistakes. But the then coach (Clemente) decided that Zubizarreta stayed in the XI. That was not the case with me in 2000.Was it the best experience for me as a player? No. Every time I win any title that is the best experience. To win the ISL in 2016, the title in the Hong Kong league (with Kitchee). These are all parts of my best experiences.That was an amazing moment. Everyone at Real Madrid was preparing to celebrate the occasion by winning that match (Copa del Rey) since it was their centenary year and they were hosting the final at Estadio Santiago Bernabéu. It was more special because of my Atletico past. Day before the final, some of my friends at Atletico came over to me and wished me luck. People still talk about that match in La Coruna.When you are a player, you never know what will happen to you in future. Simeone and Scaloni - they too didn't know their future at that time. Even I wasn't sure about my future. I live in the present. Maybe my illness has helped me understand the value of enjoying my present as much as I can.One of the first things I did as a technical director (of Spanish football) was to look for more balance in our style and the kind of players suitable for this so that we could create a winning team. Football is a constant evolution. Spain has not changed tiki-taka style. But it's a process of evolution. Tiki-taka is still there, but sometimes you need to be more direct in your approach to the game.I am not happy with the AFC's decision. I would prefer my team to play in Asia. Now, you have to forget about the AFC and focus on ISL. We'll try to win it and play in the AFC next year to prove that an Indian team can be strong in Asia tournaments as well.Not at all. The yellow cards are the referee's decisions and they can be right or wrong. But Mohun Bagan have brought me here not to win the Fair play trophy but the title. If both are achieved, it's better, but the aim is always to win the championship.","Mohun Bagan coach Jose Molina is a former Spanish goalkeeper. Molina won the Liga and Cup 'double' for Atletico Madrid in 1996 and 2002. The 54-year-old also played for Deportivo la Coruna, Real Madrid and Atletico.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115000189,imgsize-45212,width-400,resizemode-4/115000189.jpg"

MADRID FALTERING

OTHER RESULTS

European heavyweights Real Madrid and Manchester City both suffered big defeats in the Champions League on Tuesday.Defending champions Madrid were humbled 3-1 at home by AC Milan , while Erling Haaland missed a penalty and City squandered a fourth-minute lead as they lost 4-1 at Sporting Lisbon , whose coach will soon take charge of its crosstown rival.It was a much better evening for Liverpool , as Luis Diaz scored a hat trick and Cody Gakpo grabbed another goal in a 4-0 win over German champion Bayer Leverkusen at Anfield that marred Xabi Alonso’s return to his old home.The Leverkusen coach was given a warm welcome on his return to the club where he became a fan favorite as a player over five seasons between 2004-09. Alonso won the Champions League with Liverpool in 2005.Liverpool moved to the top of the league phase table with four wins from four games, followed by Sporting and Monaco, both on 10 points after three wins and a draw. Under the new 36-team format introduced by UEFA this season, the top eight teams advance directly to the next round, and those from ninth to 24th enter playoffs to reach it, while the bottom 12 are eliminated.Before their game, Sporting fans displayed a huge tifo thanking Ruben Amorim in his last home game before he takes over Manchester United.Phil Foden then got City off to a flying start in the fourth minute, only the second goal Sporting have conceded in four games of the competition.But Swedish forward Viktor Gyokeres scored a hat trick as Sporting came roaring back. Gyokeres first equalized in the 38th after a perfect through ball from Geovany Quenda, before Maximiliano Araújo made it 2-1 right after the break.

We have to analyze and react quickly,"" Lunin said, referring to Madrid's 4-0 loss to Barcelona in their previous Spanish league game.It's the first time since 2009 that Madrid have lost two successive games at home with at least three goals conceded in each, according to Opta.“We have to get back on track,” Lunin said.German forward Nicolas Kuhn scored twice as Celtic defeated Leipzig 3-1 at home, and Juventus drew 1-1 at Lille.Lille midfielder Edon Zhegrova eluded two defenders before playing a perfect pass for Jonathan David, who fired inside the far post, but Dusan Vlahovic equalized with a penalty for the Italian club.Donyell Malen scored late for Borussia Dortmund to beat Sturm Graz 1-0 at home, and Thilo Kehrer did likewise for Monaco to win at Bologna 1-0.United States midfielder Malik Tillman scored one goal and set up another as PSV Eindhoven beat Spanish team Girona 4-0.Dinamo Zagreb dealt Slovan Bratislava their fourth straight defeat in the competition as the visitors came from behind to win 4-1 in Bratislava.",Real Madrid lose 3-1 at home to AC Milan.

Riyadh:

Defending WTA Finals champion Iga Swiatek was eliminated from the season-ending championship on Thursday after Barbora Krejcikova's 7-5 6-4 win over Coco Gauff meant the Polish world number two failed to advance to the last four.Gauff was already guaranteed to make the semis, but five-times Grand Slam champion Swiatek needed the American to beat eighth-seeded Czech Krejcikova who required a victory herself to progress.The 13th-ranked Krejcikova took a tight first set, which lasted 54 minutes, after saving four break points, wrapping it up with a powerful backhand that zipped down the line.Former US Open champion Gauff, who had not dropped a set in the tournament before the contest, was hurt by unforced errors — 23 alone in the opener.The second set was once again a close affair, but the Wimbledon champion held her nerve to secure the win in one hour and 42 minutes.""This is a big win for me and really happy with how I played and it was a really good match,"" the 27-year-old Krejcikova said. ""It's tough, it was up and down. The Wimbledon victory is the highest point in my career so far.""Being here and reaching the semi-final, it's something unimaginable. I'm really proud of myself and I'm looking forward to the new challenges.""Krejcikova is the lowest-ranked player to book a spot in the semis at the WTA Finals since Sandrine Testud (14) in 2001.Gauff will face world number one Aryna Sabalenka in a blockbuster semi-final, while Krejcikova will take on China's Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen .Earlier Swiatek had produced a ruthless performance to dismantle Daria Kasatkina 6-1 6-0, wasting little time in asserting herself as she raced to a 5-0 lead in the opening set which she wrapped up with an ace.Having replaced Jessica Pegula after the American withdrew due to a left knee injury, world number nine Kasatkina was demolished in the second set as Swiatek sealed the win in 51 minutes, making it the fastest match at the WTA Finals in eight years.Swiatek won 72% of her points on serve and thumped 15 winners as she extended her head-to-head advantage over the 27-year-old Russian to 6-1.Kasatkina is not the first player to be steam-rollered at the WTA Finals by Swiatek, who took her tally of 6-0 set wins at the tournament to five.The 23-year-old Pole equalled Serena Williams' total of 6-0 set wins at the event and is now only behind greats Martina Navratilova (12), Chris Evert and Steffi Graf (both seven).",Defending WTA Finals champion Iga Swiatek is eliminated from the season-ending championship.

Coco Gauff posted a rare victory over Iga Swiatek to punch her ticket to the semi-finals of the WTA Finals in Riyadh on Tuesday, ensuring Aryna Sabalenka will finish the year as the world number one Swiatek, the defending champion, was in a direct battle with Sabalenka for the top spot this week but needed a win over Gauff to keep her chances alive of leapfrogging her Belarusian rival.Gauff, 20, entered the contest having lost 11 of her 12 previous meetings with Swiatek, with the American's sole victory coming in Cincinnati last year.But she turned the tables on Swiatek on Tuesday, defeating the second seed 6-3, 6-4 to make it two straight-sets wins from two round-robin matches in Riyadh this week.""It feels great. I knew going into the match that despite our head-to-head I had a lot of confidence going in,"" said Gauff, who hit 11 double faults during the one-hour 48-minute showdown.With the exception of the opening game of the match, Gauff had break point opportunities in every Swiatek service game in the first set.The American third seed made her move in game seven, breaking for 4-3, and she closed out the set with a second break of serve, taking the lead in 49 minutes.Swiatek needed six break points in a marathon third game of the second set to finally take down the Gauff serve but she couldn't consolidate her advantage.They traded breaks again, as Gauff's double-fault tally went up to double digits and Swiatek racked up the errors.It was Gauff who eventually steadied the ship, and wrapped up the victory on Swiatek's 47th unforced error of the match.Swiatek, a five-time major champion, admits her two-month break between the US Open and the WTA Finals and the fact she is playing her first tournament with her new coach Wim Fissette have made things ""a bit more tricky and different than usual"".""But I'll force myself to work even better in the next match,"" the Pole added.Earlier in the day, Barbora Krejcikova ended Jessica Pegula's chances of qualifying for the semi-finals, defeating the sixth-seeded American 6-3, 6-3.A runner-up at the WTA Finals last year, Pegula suffered her second straight-sets defeat of the week and enters her final round-robin match against Swiatek on Thursday anchoring the Orange Group with zero sets won.Eighth-seeded Krejcikova bounced back from her opening loss to Swiatek to keep her hopes of making the final four alive.""I was fighting for every ball and I felt that I really have to play my best tennis and I was trying to be really solid and trying to put as many balls to the other side as I could,"" said Krejcikova, who picked up just her 20th match win of the season.""I'm definitely proud.

It's nice to get the win and still be part of the event.""Despite being ranked number 13 in the world, Krejcikova qualified for these WTA Finals thanks to a new rule introduced by the WTA that gave priority to a player who has won a Grand Slam this season, while maintaining a ranking between 9 and 20, over a player ranked number eight in the Race.As the reigning Wimbledon champion, Krejcikova claimed the final qualifying spot in Riyadh over world number eight Emma Navarro.Krejcikova squandered a 6-4, 3-0 lead against Swiatek in her opener two days ago and made sure there was no repeat scenario against Pegula on Tuesday.The crafty Czech fired 11 aces and broke Pegula four times to wrap up the win in 69 minutes.Both Krejcikova and Swiatek will have to wait until Thursday's matches to learn their qualification fate in Riyadh.","Coco Gauff beats Iga Swiatek 6-3, 6-4 to reach WTA Finals semi-finals.

Aryna Sabalenka was assured of the year-end World No. 1 spot in the WTA rankings for the first time when Iga Swiatek lost at the WTA Finals on Tuesday.Sabalenka, 26, was assured of finishing the season atop the WTA rankings without swinging her racket, thanks to Coco Gauff's 6-3, 6-4 win against Swiatek at the season-ending tournament in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.A year ago, in September, Sabalenka briefly displaced Swiatek at the top of the standings for the first time, but relinquished the place when the Polish player won the WTA Finals in Cancun.This time, Sabalenka was already in pole position after Swiatek took a break from competition after the US Open.The Belarussian is 56-12 this season with four titles, including the Australian and US Opens to raise her major championship total to three. Her first came at the 2023 Australian Open.Sabalenka's game is laden with powerful — if once-erratic — serve and intimidating groundstrokes; her forehand speeds at the US Open this year were higher than every other woman and man in the tournament. But lately she has added elements of touch and variety to her game.“It’s really good to have these options in your pocket. Like sometimes, you don’t feel your best on the baseline, and you can just go for a slice or a drop shot or come to the net. I mean, I’ve been always working on this variation on the court,” Sabalenka said after defeating Jessica Pegula 7-5, 7-5 in the U.S. Open final in September. “I’m really glad that I’m brave enough to use these tools.”The WTA also announced that Katerina Siniakova will finish at No. 1 in the year-end doubles rankings.
