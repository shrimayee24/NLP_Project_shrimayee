Bruins insiders make bold Stanley Cup prediction if Connor McDavid lands in Boston

Should Bruins TRADE Pavel Zacha? | Bruins Beat

Connor McDavid’s uncertain future has the entire NHL holding its breath

As NHL free agency and trade talks ramp up, one name continues to dominate every rumor mill—Connor McDavid. With his contract situation still unresolved in Edmonton, speculation is heating up across the league. Among the teams linked to the Oilers captain, the Boston Bruins have now entered the conversation—and some local media believe a potential McDavid deal could change everything.During the August 1 episode of Bruins Beat, reporters Evan Marinofsky and Conor Ryan briefly entertained the fantasy of Connor McDavid wearing a black and gold jersey. Marinofsky tossed out the question, “What if McDavid ended up with the Bruins?” Ryan’s response was immediate and emphatic: “I mean, they’d win a cup. They would, yeah.”That may sound like a stretch—but Ryan doubled down. Calling McDavid “the easiest cheat code,” he drew a parallel to another generational athlete: “I think McDavid is so dominant now that he’s kind of like LeBron during his prime, right? Where, like just him alone, you’re going to be in the third round if not in the final.”Ryan also acknowledged the financial weight that a McDavid contract would carry—likely in the ballpark of $15.5 to $16 million per year, a new NHL record.Yet he argued that even at that cost, McDavid would be worth every penny.After another playoff letdown for the Oilers in June, Connor McDavid’s long-term commitment to Edmonton has come under question. The 2024 Conn Smythe winner has recorded at least 90 points in all nine of his NHL seasons—yet remains without a Stanley Cup. His contract talks have reportedly stalled, and the league is taking notice.Connor McDavid made his priorities clear in a recent interview: “Winning is the most important thing… If I feel there’s a good window to win here over and over again, then signing is no problem.” That statement leaves the door open for other franchises—like the Bruins—to make their pitch. Whether Boston is a serious contender or just a fan-fueled fantasy, one thing is certain: until McDavid re-signs, the NHL rumor machine won’t slow down.Also Read: Connor McDavid to the Maple Leafs? Rumors swirl as NHL insider insists it’s Toronto or nowhere The Oilers are expected to have $45 million in open contract space next offseason, so there won't be much excuse for not giving McDavid something between $16-20 million per year.Connor McDavid is one of only two players – after fellow Oilers captain Wayne Gretzky in 1982 – to unanimously win the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player.","Bruins Beat hosts Evan Marinofsky and Conor Ryan speculate about Connor McDavid.

"Uttarkashi mayhem: In Dharali, the calendar is written in floods; here, clock ticks to the roar of Kheer Gad",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/uttarakhand-flash-flood-dharali-mountain-village-that-marks-calendar-by-number-of-times-it-sinks-river-arrives-unannounced-and-dragging-centuries-of-stone/articleshow/123130541.cms,"



DEHRADUN: In Dharali, disaster isn't the exception. It's the architecture. And each time the Kheer Gad river roars to life, villagers climb to the roof and wait - not for rescue, but to see what's left standing when the river leaves.The river doesn't knock before entering the hamlet near Gangotri on the old Indo-Tibetan Silk route. It doesn't announce itself with thunder or rain, just arrives - sudden, swollen, dragging centuries of stone behind it.In this village tucked into a crease of Uttarkashi, flood isn't a headline. It's a season in the calendar. Locals mark the years not by festivals or elections, but by the floods: the one in 2010 that soaked the school walls, the one in 2012 that swallowed a shop, another in 2018 that buried apple orchards under boulders taller than men. The Kheer Gad, a seemingly harmless trickle for most of the year, turns violent when cloudbursts hit Srikanth Parvat. And when it does, it doesn't rise - it lunges.Despite the frequency and intensity of these disasters, Dharali had been extraordinarily fortunate so far: in all recorded incidents between 2010 and 2018, no lives were lost. The river took homes, orchards, roads, and livelihoods - but never a person.Dharali, with a population just over 500, sits along the Char Dham yatra route, 20km before the Gangotri shrine.In summer, its guesthouses and dhabas are packed with pilgrims and tourists, more than doubling the population; by mid-July, the rains begin and the village watches the stream. The 2018 flood - the worst before Tuesday's - came in the early hours, leaving behind silence and the smell of wet iron. Nearly two dozen homes and hotels were reduced to rubble, two hectares of apple orchards disappeared under muck, and the road to the shrine was choked with silt and broken tin roofs.Lokendra Bisht, an Uttarkashi resident, remembers 2018 clearly. ""We dug out furniture from mud two days later,"" he told TOI. ""That time, no one died. But the loss - of homes, of work - it stayed with us longer than the flood."" He remembered 2012 the same way: quieter, but damaging. The Kheer Gad had risen again, this time pushing through homes and shops without warning.The pattern has grown hard to ignore. Over those years, the Kheer Gad behaved less like a stream and more like a fuse - short, volatile, and primed to detonate without warning. And each year, the debris has crept closer to the village centre. The stream begins on Srikanth Parvat and empties into the Bhagirathi river just downstream. The short run belies its power. When it floods, Dharali becomes a basin.Before the recent floods etched Dharali into disaster maps, destruction had already marked the valleys around it. In 1978, a dam breach near Dabrani, roughly 35km downstream, sent a rush of water through villages along the Bhagirathi. In 1984, a cloudburst over the Gyansu nala - just 15km from Dharali - triggered a flood that turned fields into silt flats overnight. And in 2003, a section of Varunavat mountain peeled off above Uttarkashi town, 40km away, burying homes and snapping roads. Dharali was spared each time, but the events traced a ring around it - as if the landscape had been circling the village, waiting.And the pushing hasn't stopped. A 2013 report by the Uttarakhand Disaster Mitigation and Management Centre classified Dharali and nearby villages like Sukhi and Jhala as high-risk zones. The warnings were clear, but so were the incentives to ignore them. Hotels continued to rise on riverbeds. Pilgrim traffic swelled. Roads were widened. Slopes were cut.Experts who have studied the region's topography have dire warnings. With glacial melt accelerating and rainfall patterns shifting, cloudbursts are now more frequent, and the consequences more immediate. ""People think the mountain breaks in one night,"" a geologist from the Wadia Institute once said. ""But in reality, it's been breaking slowly for years.""","Dharali is a hamlet near Gangotri on the old Indo-Tibetan Silk route.

Poll Do you think social media plays a significant role in raising awareness about animal cruelty? Yes, absolutely Not really

A disturbing case of animal cruelty has emerged from Navi Mumbai's Kopar Khairane residential area, where a 16-year-old stray dog, roughly equivalent in age to an 80-year-old human was brutally assaulted by a man using a heavy wooden plank. The helpless dog was left injured and visibly shaken until a team of animal rescuers arrived and intervened.The video of the incident was originally shared on Instagram by one of the rescuers, Mohammed Raiz. In it, the young man can be seen repeatedly striking the defenseless animal with a thick stick of plywood. The footage quickly went viral, sparking widespread outrage across social media platforms.In his post, Raiz wrote: ""Hats off to PFA’s brave warriors for standing up for the voiceless!""The rescue operation was carried out by the People for Animals (PFA) Mumbai Unit 2, led by Vijay Rangare. The team comprising Mohammed Raiz, Aditya, Tarun and Sanket Bhatt acted swiftly, tracked down the accused and confronted him directly. Due to their quick response, the dog was rescued and is now safe.n a follow-up post, Raiz also revealed that the accused’s mother had allegedly provoked her son to commit the act. Shockingly, she reportedly justified the cruelty and even claimed they would repeat it if necessary.The video has garnered over 77.9K views on social media. Reactions have been overwhelmingly critical of the attack.Reacting to the video one user commented, “Please give him the same treatment he gave to the poor dog.” “So much he beat the dog… please tell me, is the dog okay?” commented another concerned netizen.The situation escalated further when a crowd confronted the man in public. He was thrashed by locals, including a woman who beat him with her slippers in the middle of the road, shaming him for attacking an innocent animal.Giving an update about the condition of dog, the official page of Street Dogs of Bombay posted: ""The senior dog who was badly beaten is now safe. He’s getting better, thanks to Dr. Kartik Iyer and his kind team. They are giving him all the care, love, and attention he needs. We’re hopeful he will soon go back to his usual spot at his little home on the street.""",A 16-year-old stray dog was brutally assaulted by a man using a heavy wooden plank.

Ciara’s ‘Level Up’ advice for single women sparked major backlash

Fans accused Ciara of judgment and hypocrisy

Ciara’s heartfelt response: growth, not judgment

In January 2018, singer Ciara stirred a storm of debate on social media after she shared a sermon clip by Pastor John Gray encouraging women to embrace “wife energy” if they wanted to attract a husband. What seemed like motivational advice quickly escalated into a cultural flashpoint — prompting both fierce criticism and passionate support.In the Instagram post, Ciara captioned a clip from Gray’s sermon with: “#LevelUp. Don’t Settle.” In the video, Gray states:“Too many women want to be married but you’re walking in the spirit of ‘girlfriend.’”He continues, “You’re not a wife when I marry you, you’re a wife when I find you… A wife is not the presence of a ring, it’s the presence of your character.”The post was widely interpreted as Ciara telling single women that their lack of romantic success was due to their failure to ""act like wives.""Ciara’s advice came under fire quickly. Many pointed to her previous relationship with rapper Future — which ended in a very public and painful breakup — and called her tone tone-deaf now that she was happily married to NFL star Russell Wilson One viral tweet criticized her for preaching from a “throne”: “You can be the queen of the ball today and have cake in your face tomorrow!” Another added, “Didn’t you need grace, mercy & compassion when you were being dragged up and down the Internet for the Future situation?”Facing the heat, Ciara responded with a heartfelt Instagram post explaining the context behind her message. “I was one that girl wanting to be loved a certain way but was making the wrong choices… I needed to love myself.” She emphasized that her “level up” mindset came from self-love and personal growth, not judgment.Also Read: “She just wants attention”: Simone Biles faces unexpected NFL backlash as feud with Riley Gaines fuels fan criticism Looking back, this viral moment reflected a deeper cultural tension about dating standards, double standards, and how women support — or criticize — each other in the name of empowerment.",Ciara stirred a storm of debate on social media after she shared a sermon clip by Pastor John Gray.

Club Shay Shay

Fresh off settling a lawsuit reportedly worth up to $23 million, Shannon Sharpe is out here chasing petty debts and turning it into top-tier podcast content. On a recent episode of, Sharpe turned to co-host Chad “Ocho Cinco” Johnson and hit him with a line fans can’t stop quoting. After dropping millions in back-to-back legal battles including one involving an OnlyFans model, it was the timing that had fans absolutely unhinged. One second he’s in a courtroom, the next he’s calling out Ocho like he’s running collections. Here’s the full drama and why this tiny debt moment is now all over X.In case you missed it, Shannon Sharpe has had a month. The sports media legend recently settled a sexual assault lawsuit reportedly tied to an OnlyFans model, with outlets estimating the settlement landed somewhere in the $20–23 million range. While the details remain sealed, the timing of his “my pocket’s light” line couldn’t have been more chaotic.The clip itself is straight comedy. In a casual back-and-forth, Sharpe turns to Ocho and says:Yes, he’s probably joking.But that wasn’t even the only legal drama Sharpe’s been juggling. He’s also facing a $20 million defamation lawsuit from Jimalita Tillman, the woman who went viral for dancing with Usher after Sharpe and Ocho implied onthat she was married during the moment.Tillman says the comments were false and damaging, and she wants payback.So yeah... that “$5,900” jab?

Fans instantly turned it into meme gold. Some of the top replies on X:It’s one of those viral moments where the line between joke and reality gets really blurry.The moment might’ve been lighthearted, but fans are also clocking a pattern. Sharpe’s recent controversies have been non-stop from legal headlines to awkward podcast moments to wild feuds on. Add in the fact that he's still cracking jokes while reportedly hemorrhaging millions? It’s giving “unbothered but broke” energy.Also, let’s be honest, if you just paid out a small country's GDP in lawsuit money, maybe don’t remind the world you’re still collecting IOUs from your co-host.

Trinity Rodman earns heartfelt praise from Lakers legend Magic Johnson

Trinity explained her relationship with her father, Dennis Rodman

Trinity Rodman made headlines once again as the Washington Spirit forward delivered a stunning game-winning goal against the Portland Thorns, marking her return from injury in spectacular style. The moment was enough to electrify the crowd. He stunning performance also earned a public message of praise from Los Angeles Lakers legend and part-owner of the Spirit, Magic Johnson.On a thrilling evening in D.C., Rodman reminded fans why she’s a generational talent. With just minutes left on the clock, she buried a decisive goal to give the Washington Spirit a 2–1 victory. For Trinity, it was a storybook return after injury kept her sidelined for weeks.Magic Johnson, who is part of the Spirit’s ownership group, didn’t hold back his excitement on X.He wrote, “Welcome back superstar Trinity Rodman! Congratulations on scoring the game winning goal for our Washington Spirit in a 2-1 victory over the Portland Thorns. The entire National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) has missed you!”It wasn’t the first time Johnson praised the young forward, but this moment carried added emotion.After all, Rodman’s prowess in the game has become as much a part of her identity as her footwork and finishing.In an emotionally raw interview earlier this year on Call Her Daddy, she opened up about her strained relationship with her father, NBA Hall of Famer Dennis Rodman. ""My dad, he likes to be in control. So he would take us shopping, get us phones, do this, do that. 'Oh, I'm going to take you and your brother shopping,' and me and my brother are like, 'We don't want to go shopping, we just want money to go get In-N-Out after school with our friends,"" Trinity said.""So it was like, he wouldn't give us money to do that. He needed to have the control of bringing us shopping and swiping his own card. But if we asked, 'Hey, could we have $100 to go get food, to go to Claire's to get my ears pierced,' just little stuff like that? He was like, 'No. You're using me.'""“He’s not a dad,” Trinity continued. “Maybe by blood, but nothing else. Hearing his voice is painful.”She described a childhood marked by instability, often living in a car with her mother, while her father’s absence left emotional gaps. Even when Dennis Rodman showed up — like when he surprised her at her NWSL debut — the gestures felt more about control or spectacle than support.“I answer the phone now for my conscience,” she added, “to be like, he needed to hear my voice before anything else happens.”Also Read: Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton attends WWE SummerSlam in style amid his Achilles injury Despite the emotional weight she carries, Trinity Rodman continues to shine on her own terms.

Christian McCaffrey hails wife Olivia Culpo as ‘real MVP’ in touching tribute after birth of their daughter



Olivia Culpo’s tough pregnancy journey reveals deeper layers of love



Amidst the rigors of NFL training camp, Christian McCaffrey is finding inspiration far beyond the gridiron. The San Francisco 49ers running back recently opened up about life as a new dad and offered a touching tribute to his wife, Olivia Culpo , following the arrival of their daughter, Colette Annalise McCaffrey, born on July 13. While McCaffrey may be battling defensive lines, at home, he says it’s Culpo who’s doing the heavy lifting.As Christian McCaffrey returns to training camp, he gave fans a glimpse into his journey through early fatherhood and his admiration for Culpo’s resilience. “She’s been great. She’s been so cool… I feel guilty at times,” McCaffrey admitted. “I’m sleeping well in the hotel bedroom while she’s doing the dirty work, but super thankful for it—and she’s doing an incredible job.”While he trains with the 49ers, Culpo remains home caring for their newborn, supported by both families who’ve stepped in to help the first-time parents. Their joint announcement on social media revealed the birth of Colette, accompanied by intimate photos—one especially moving image captured McCaffrey holding Culpo’s hand during her C-section, a moment that echoed their unwavering bond.Culpo, 33, hasn’t held back her appreciation either.In a heartwarming Instagram story, she called McCaffrey the “best daddy in the world,” adding, “We’re going to miss him so much,” along with a crying emoji, as he headed off to camp.Though the couple now celebrates their growing family, the road wasn’t easy. Culpo had been candid about her physically taxing pregnancy. Back in March, she shared on TikTok that she had battled pneumonia and remained on bed rest for nearly a month.

Theare no strangers to making bold veteran signings in pursuit of another championship. With Stephen Curry still performing at an elite level, every roster move matters - and while much of the talk this offseason has revolved around Boston’s Al Horford, there’s another name that could quietly fit the bill. Former Milwaukee Bucks star and NBA champion Khris Middleton, though past his peak, might be exactly the kind of experienced, playoff-tested player the Warriors need to stabilize their wing depth and boost their scoring options.Blue Man Hoop's G. C. Bellchamber pointed out Khris Middleton’s unexpected departure from Milwaukee, saying, “After parts of 11 seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks , Middleton was shockingly dealt to the (Washington) Wizards in the middle of last season as a result of the Bucks’ tenuous cap situation.” (H/t: Sporting News)While his exit was abrupt, Middleton showed he could still contribute in Washington.Now entering the final year of a three-year, $93 million extension signed with Milwaukee, Middleton could soon be a buyout candidate. Washington’s decision to focus on its younger core - parting ways with other veterans like Marcus Smart - only strengthens that possibility.If available, Middleton could be a valuable addition to the Golden State Warriors ’ rotation. His experience and composure would help stabilize the team’s wing depth, particularly around young forward Moses Moody.• Veteran leadership for a team still aiming for a title run• Proven playoff performer with championship experience• Capable of being a reliable third or fourth scoring option• Defensive versatility at 6-foot-7• Ability to play alongside elite talent without disrupting chemistryMiddleton thrived as Giannis Antetokounmpo’s right-hand man during the Bucks’ championship run. His playoff numbers in 2021 reflect his impact:His steady scoring and clutch performances were vital in helping Milwaukee secure the title.At 33, Middleton’s athleticism and production have dipped, but his skill set and experience remain valuable. For the Golden State Warriors, who are still in win-now mode with Curry leading the charge, the move could be a low-cost way to strengthen their roster for a playoff push.Also read: Boston Celtics Weigh Trade Options and Roster Adjustments Ahead of 2025-26 Season The decision will ultimately come down to whether Golden State sees Middleton as a short-term spark or chooses to keep its current core intact.","Khris Middleton could be a buyout candidate for the Golden State Warriors.

George Kittle ‘distraught’ over NFL’s new smelling salt ban



The science and safety behind the NFL’s sudden move



George Kittle has never been one to shy away from making a scene - especially when it’s both hilarious and heartfelt. During a light-hearted yet surprising interruption at 49ers training camp, the San Francisco 49ers tight end made headlines after jokingly announcing he was “distraught” and even “considered retirement. ” The reason? A brand-new NFL policy that has banned smelling salts and ammonia packets from all league play starting in 2025.The impromptu moment unfolded when Kittle stormed the NFL Network set mid-interview, grabbing the mic while teammate Fred Warner was speaking. “I honestly just came up here to air a grievance,” he said, prompting laughter from those around. “Our team got a memo today that smelling salts and ammonia packets were made illegal in the NFL, and I've been distraught all day.” He then tossed in a cheeky bombshell: “I considered retirement. ”While clearly joking, Kittle wasn’t exaggerating his personal attachment to the now-banned item. “I'm an every-drive guy,” he emphasized, explaining that he uses smelling salts as part of his regular pre-snap ritual. “I miss them already,” he confessed, before quickly drawing a line at overuse: “Every play is too much.”The ban, however, is anything but a joke to the league.According to NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo, the memo referenced a 2024 alert from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which cited growing concerns over the unregulated use of ammonia inhalants (AIs) — the broader category including smelling salts. The NFL’s head, neck, and spine committee echoed these concerns, recommending a full ban due to the potential for AIs to “mask certain neurologic signs and symptoms,” particularly those associated with concussions.The league’s official stance is firm. Players, coaches, and staff are prohibited from using or providing smelling salts in any game context — pregame, during play, or even halftime. The FDA highlighted troubling side effects like shortness of breath, seizures, vomiting, and even fainting, especially from unapproved or cheaply sourced products bought online.Smelling salts, once intended to revive fainting victims, have become a go-to stimulant for athletes in high-impact sports like football and hockey. While Kittle’s playful protest might have earned chuckles, the ban is rooted in player safety — a direction the league clearly isn't planning to reverse.Still, fans shouldn’t worry. Kittle just signed a lucrative extension, and despite the melodrama, he isn’t actually walking away from football. But one thing’s for sure — he definitely wants a compromise.Also Read: How Erin Andrews and Charissa Thompson remain unbiased despite close ties with top NFL players","The NFL has banned smelling salts and ammonia packets from all league play starting in 2025.

Elliotte Friedman says it’s ‘irresponsible’ to speculate on Carter Hart’s NHL future post-acquittal

Public relations risk keeps teams like Oilers away from Carter Hart amid unresolved eligibility

The NHL future of Carter Hart remains shrouded in uncertainty, even after his acquittal in the high-profile Hockey Canada sexual assault case. While fans continue to debate whether the former Philadelphia Flyers goalie deserves another shot on the ice, NHL insider Elliotte Friedman has strongly advised against making any assumptions.Five members of Canada’s 2018 world junior hockey team were found not guilty of sexual assault, ending months-long trial that has garnered national attention since it began in April. Michael McLeod, Carter Hart, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dubé and Cal Foote were acquitted of all charges by Ontario Superior Court Justice Maria Carroccia.Speaking on his 32 Thoughts podcast, Elliotte Friedman addressed the growing speculation around Hart’s potential return to the league. Despite being found not guilty along with four other players in the 2018 Hockey Canada case, Hart’s status remains unresolved in the eyes of the NHL.“I think it is really irresponsible to speculate until we have a legal ruling on this,” Friedman said. “I don’t think anything more needs to be said about that until we know if they're eligible to play. I just don't think it's smart to speculate on where they could play.”The NHL has made it clear that acquittal does not equate to reinstatement.The league released a statement acknowledging that the players’ behavior—though not criminally punishable—was still “very disturbing” and “unacceptable.” The league added that it would be “reviewing and considering the judge's findings” before making any decisions about eligibility.While Hart is technically an unrestricted free agent, teams are hesitant. Analyst Avry Lewis-McDougall shut down rumors linking Hart to the Edmonton Oilers during the Fanatics View Hockey Show, stating bluntly: “It’s a hard no.” He cited both the unresolved nature of Hart’s status and the inevitable media firestorm.“Teams don’t want the PR headache,” he said. “You should be looking at somebody you can bring in with less baggage.”With the Oilers needing a reliable goalie after two consecutive Stanley Cup Final losses, Lewis-McDougall emphasized that Hart’s off-ice issues make him an unsuitable option—even if he’s cleared to return.For now, Carter Hart’s road back to the NHL remains a legal, ethical, and reputational maze.Also Read: “Keep it real and sensible”: Carey Price’s wife Angela responds to Sydney Sweeney’s American Eagle ad backlash Since early 2024, Hart has been on an indefinite leave of absence from hockey due to his alleged involvement in the 2018 Hockey Canada sexual assault scandal; upon reaching restricted free agency that offseason, the Flyers did not match his minimum qualifying salary offer and thereby released him.","Elliotte Friedman says it's 'irresponsible' to speculate on Carter Hart's NHL future.

WNBA addressed the s*x toy throwing controversy



What began as a strange interruption during a WNBA game has now evolved into an unwanted trend, and Sophie Cunningham is caught between finding it funny and fearing the consequences. The Indiana Fever guard addressed the bizarre new fan behavior that’s shaken up multiple league games, fans throwing neon green s*x toys onto the court mid-play.In recent weeks, fans have disrupted at least three WNBA games by hurling s*x toys from the stands. The first known incident occurred on July 29 during a matchup between the Atlanta Dream and the Golden State Valkyries, with another quickly following on August 1 at a Chicago Sky game. Officials have had to halt play each time, with the most recent objects identified as bright green dildos tossed from unknown seats.Sophie Cunningham spoke about the incidents during a recent episode of her podcast, Show Me Something, and didn’t hold back her concerns or her humor.“I was thinking about like, if someone threw that thing and like, first of all, the bounce that that thing had, if that smacks someone in the face, you know that's gonna be plastered everywhere,” she said.She added, “I just know how things go viral now. And I just know that thing like, even came from like the rafters or bounced and just slapped me right in the face. That would be what I'd be known for, for life. So I was just trying to protect all of our images.”These incidents don’t just disrupt games, they create safety hazards for players and officials while also dragging the league’s growing reputation through unnecessary controversy.The WNBA has seen an impressive rise in popularity over the past few seasons. That momentum makes fan antics like these especially frustrating for players trying to build credibility and grow the sport. “Everyone’s trying to make sure the W is not a joke and it’s taken seriously and then that happens,” Cunningham said. “I’m like, ‘how are we ever going to get taken seriously?’”And she’s not alone in her frustration. Players across the league have voiced their outrage. Chicago Sky center Elizabeth Williams called it “really immature,” adding, “It’s super disrespectful. I don’t really get the point of it.” New York Liberty forward Isabelle Harrison also questioned security protocols, writing, “ARENA SECURITY?! Hello??!”Cunningham even shared a moment from her personal life to show how the bizarre trend has reached her inner circle. “Funny thing is like my parents and my sister, they literally text me after or before every single game, saying, ‘Good luck,’” she said. “But my mom goes, instead of like my good luck text, she goes, ‘Watch out for flying (s*x toys) tonight.’”Also Read: Why 5x NBA All-Star Wants to Join the Los Angeles Lakers and How His Hollywood Hopes are Halted by Salary Cap Restrictions Following these incidents, the league has taken action.

Connor Bedard is carrying a franchise with no real plan — why are the Blackhawks wasting a generational talent?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/connor-bedard-is-carrying-a-franchise-with-no-real-plan-why-are-the-blackhawks-wasting-a-generational-talent/articleshow/123118785.cms,"Chicago Blackhawks' offseason strategy faces scrutiny as they haven't adequately supported Connor Bedard (Getty Images)

Chicago’s offseason moves lack the firepower Connor Bedard needs right now

Banking on prospects won’t cut it for a team in need of progress



As the 2025 NHL offseason nears its end, one glaring oversight from the Chicago Blackhawks continues to spark concern: the team has done little to meaningfully support Connor Bedard. Despite high hopes following his promising rookie campaign, Chicago’s reluctance to add top-tier talent raises questions about the front office’s long-term strategy—and whether it's setting up its young star to succeed or fail.After a disappointing 2024–25 season that saw the Blackhawks fire head coach Luke Richardson and stumble to another forgettable finish, fans expected the franchise to get aggressive in free agency. At one point, Chicago was even loosely linked to Mitch Marner before he landed in Vegas. But instead of landing a game-changer, the Blackhawks settled for smaller trade-market moves—sending Joe Veleno to Seattle for Andre Burakovsky and reacquiring Sam Lafferty from Buffalo.While Burakovsky has potential, his recent form leaves room for doubt. Lafferty, though valuable in a bottom-six role, won't share much ice time with Bedard.And that’s the problem—none of these moves bring the high-skill, top-line help the Blackhawks’ 19-year-old cornerstone desperately needs.Chicago's front office seems committed to giving their young players a shot at roster spots. That long-term vision is admirable, but it comes at the cost of short-term development. Bedard may be the future, but he needs support now to build confidence and elevate his play.Free agents like Jonathan Drouin, Andrew Mangiapane, or even a more ambitious play for Nikolaj Ehlers could’ve changed the dynamic completely. And there’s still a chance to correct course—names like Jack Roslovic remain available and could slot in as immediate help.Also Read: Connor McDavid Trade Bombshell to the Bruins: NHL insiders say it could guarantee a Stanley Cup win For now, though, the Blackhawks are skating on thin ice. “Bedard needs players he can count on right now,” and unless that changes soon, Chicago risks wasting another crucial year of their franchise savior’s development.","Chicago's reluctance to add top-tier talent raises questions about the front office's long-term strategy.

Nick Robertson emerges as trade rumor target amid identity crisis

Can Robertson fill the Marner-sized hole — or is he being set up to fail?

The Toronto Maple Leafs’ offseason has taken a turbulent turn, with the franchise still reeling from another early playoff exit. But it’s not just the loss to the Florida Panthers that has fans restless — it’s the massive shake-up that followed. Mitch Marner, one of the team’s cornerstone stars, is no longer wearing blue and white. His sign-and-trade to the Vegas Golden Knights — where he inked an 8-year, $96 million deal — sent shockwaves through Leafs Nation.While the Leafs received Nicolas Roy in return, his bottom-six forward role is no match for the offensive engine that was Marner. With 102 points last season and 741 over his nine-year career in Toronto, replacing him isn't just hard — it’s nearly impossible.“Mitch Marner was far more than a point scorer… he carried the team’s offensive burden night after night,” the article states.As the team begins to recalibrate, another name is surfacing — Nick Robertson. A recent episode of the 32 Thoughts Podcast lit up speculation when insider Elliotte Friedman said: “I had a couple people ask me about the possibility of Nick Robertson and Pittsburgh; Kyle Dubas knows him…”Dubas, now at the helm in Pittsburgh, drafted Robertson in 2019 and may see untapped potential in the 24-year-old winger.Robertson has battled through injuries but showed glimpses of promise, posting 27 points in 56 games in 2023–24 and returning healthy last season.With his recent one-year, $1.2 million deal, the Leafs seem to be keeping doors open. But the bigger question is: are they investing in his growth, or simply boosting his trade value?While Robertson lacks Marner’s pedigree, his cost-effective contract and improving form make him an intriguing piece.

Kirby Dach recovery timeline casts doubt on Montreal Canadiens lineup for 2025–26 NHL opening night

Montreal Canadiens urged to prioritize Kirby Dach’s long-term health over early NHL return after knee injury

Montreal Canadiens forward Kirby Dach may not be ready for the start of the 2025–26 NHL season, as recovery from his knee surgery is reportedly still ongoing. According to a new report, the 24-year-old has yet to fully heal from the procedure he underwent after suffering an injury in late February. Concerns are now growing about his availability for opening night.The uncertainty around Kirby Dach's recovery gained traction after journalist Maxime Truman reported that the forward is still not fully recovered. That report was further supported by comments from an orthopedic surgeon, who spoke to HFTV, stating that the general recovery window for a professional athlete after such a procedure is between 6–9 months. However, the surgeon added that if it was a repeat surgery, the recovery timeline could be even longer.Considering Dach's injury occurred near the end of February, the standard timeline places his return somewhere between late August and November. While there remains a chance that Dach could return in time for the Montreal Canadiens' season opener, it is far from guaranteed. His actual availability will depend heavily on when he resumes skating and how his knee responds in the coming weeks.While Canadiens fans hope to see Dach in the lineup on opening night, many believe the organization should exercise caution. A rushed return could risk aggravating the injury or causing long-term setbacks. Several observers, including Truman, emphasized the importance of allowing Dach to recover fully before rejoining the team.Dach, originally drafted third overall by the Chicago Blackhawks in 2019, was traded to the Canadiens in 2022 and has since become a key piece in Montreal’s rebuilding efforts. Ensuring his long-term health is viewed as essential not just for the current season but for the franchise’s future success.Although having Kirby Dach ready for the 2025–26 NHL season opener would benefit the Montreal Canadiens, the focus remains on his complete recovery. With his long-term value to the team in mind, both the medical staff and front office are expected to proceed with caution, prioritizing health over haste.Also Read: Toronto Maple Leafs ink William Villeneuve to new contract for 2025–26 season after breakout AHL year","Montreal Canadiens forward Kirby Dach may not be ready for the start of the 2025–26 NHL season.

How Recent Moves Highlight the Problem

Why Los Angeles Holds Special Meaning for Kevin Love

What Could Happen Next

, a five-time NBA All-Star and one of the league’s most respected veterans, has entered trade season with a clear goal - landing with the Los Angeles Lakers or LA Clippers. After completing his 17th season with the Miami Heat, where he delivered steady production and veteran leadership, Love became part of a major three-team deal.The trade sent John Collins to the Clippers, Norman Powell to Miami, and Kevin Love - along with Kyle Anderson - to the Utah Jazz. At nearly 37, Love has little interest in joining a rebuilding effort in Utah, instead setting his sights on a buyout and a final playoff push in Los Angeles, where he could reunite with former teammates or coaches.While the Lakers and Clippers would both welcome a stretch big with Kevin Love’s pedigree, the hard cap presents a major roadblock. Due to recent high-profile acquisitions, both franchises are hard-capped at the first salary apron.• Lakers: Sitting just $1.1 million under the first apron, any move for Love would require clearing a roster spot and freeing enough space below the cap - likely through trading or waiving guaranteed contracts.• Clippers: Only $1.2 million below the apron after blockbuster moves for Bradley Beal and Chris Paul, the team would face a similar challenge, potentially having to give up a young player or key contract to fit Love under the cap.Recent roster decisions by both LA teams show just how tight the margins are:• The Lakers waived players like Jordan Goodwin and Shake Milton to fit in Deandre Ayton and Marcus Smart.• The Clippers had to waive Jordan Miller and Drew Eubanks to sign Chris Paul and Bradley Beal, later re-signing Miller on a two-way deal.For contenders already managing limited flexibility, taking on a veteran in the twilight of his career comes with risk.Kevin Love’s interest in Los Angeles isn’t solely about basketball:• California Connections: Raised in Oregon but a star at UCLA, Love has deep ties to LA’s basketball community.• Familiar Faces: Potential reunions with LeBron James on the Lakers or Tyronn Lue with the Clippers add a personal incentive.• Defined Playoff Role: Even in a limited capacity, his shooting, toughness, and leadership fit the mold for teams chasing a championship.The most likely path for Kevin Love involves a Jazz buyout followed by waiting for midseason when teams often have more roster flexibility.

De’Aaron Fox’s Heartfelt Message to San Antonio Spurs

Why the San Antonio Spurs Made Extended Fox's Contract

Mixed Reactions and What’s Next

Thehave made a franchise-defining move, securing point guardon a four-year, $229 million maximum contract extension. The deal, confirmed by Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul and first reported by ESPN’s Shams Charania, runs through the 2029-30 NBA season with no player options or trade kickers - making it one of the largest contracts in league history. De’Aaron Fox , once the centerpiece of the Sacramento Kings, grew frustrated with the team’s trajectory last season. Reports indicated he had no interest in extending his contract in Sacramento, paving the way for a blockbuster trade before the deadline. The San Antonio Spurs, eager to fast-track their rebuild and pair a proven playmaker with emerging star Victor Wembanyama, capitalized.The trade, which also involved the Chicago Bulls , brought Fox to San Antonio. His debut run was shortened to 17 games due to a thumb injury, but his numbers - 19.7 points, 6.8 assists, 4.3 rebounds, and 1.5 steals per game - showed exactly why the Spurs view him as a foundational piece in their push toward playoff contention.Shortly after signing, De’Aaron Fox took to X to address the San Antonio Spurs community: “San Antonio! So thankful to be a part of an incredible organization, it’s an honor to put on black and silver. Can’t wait for us to make our future! Race for Seis! Go Spurs Go,”Accompanied by silver and black heart emojis, the post signaled Fox’s pride in joining the franchise and his commitment to chasing a sixth championship for San Antonio.At an average of $57.25 million per year, Fox now ranks among the NBA’s top earners. While some critics question paying that figure to a player with only one All-Star selection and limited playoff success, Spurs leadership sees the extension as a strategic investment.With rookies Dylan Harper (No. 2 overall pick) and Stephon Castle (reigning Rookie of the Year) joining Wembanyama, Fox’s leadership and playmaking are seen as critical to bridging youth with experience. The SSan Antonio purs’ favorable salary situation means they can absorb Fox’s contract without immediately hitting the luxury tax - giving them flexibility until their young core becomes eligible for extensions.The deal has sparked debate across the league. Supporters envision a dynamic San Antonio Spurs backcourt and a return to fast-paced, high-energy basketball. Skeptics, however, wonder if De’Aaron Fox’s production matches the price tag and whether he could eventually be moved if younger guards develop into primary ballhandlers.Also read: Boston Celtics Weigh Trade Options and Roster Adjustments Ahead of 2025-26 Season For now, the San Antonio Spurs’ commitment is clear: build around Wembanyama while giving the team a proven floor general to guide them into contention.

Erin Andrews and Charissa Thompson on covering NFL’s biggest names



What it was like meeting Taylor Swift | Calm Down Podcast

They have built some real relationship, real moments over the years



Some stories in sports broadcasting go beyond stats and sidelines — they’re about the people behind the mic and the bonds they form along the way. For Erin Andrews and Charissa Thompson, covering the NFL isn’t just a job. It’s a lifelong passion wrapped in genuine friendships, unforgettable moments, and the occasional fangirl reaction. In a candid chat on their Calm Down podcast, the Fox Sports veterans opened up about the delicate, often hilarious balance of staying professional while cheering on the very athletes they’ve grown close to over the years.It’s rare to hear seasoned broadcasters admit they still get starstruck, but Andrews and Thompson wear their enthusiasm proudly. “I don’t,” Andrews said when asked how she maintains composure around NFL icons. “I’m a huge fan of all the guys I cover and I get so excited to talk to them.” Her co-host, Thompson, echoed the sentiment, recalling a thrilling comeback by Baker Mayfield. “That was probably not professional, but I didn’t care, that was f—king awesome,” she laughed.Their excitement doesn’t come from a lack of experience. Andrews has been with Fox since 2012 and has covered multiple Super Bowls, including Super Bowl 2025.Thompson leads Fox NFL Kickoff and co-hosts Thursday Night Football on Prime Video. Yet, even with such credentials, the spark of fandom remains — not as a weakness, but as a reflection of their love for the sport and its athletes.The personal connections Andrews and Thompson have built over the years — with stars like Aaron Rodgers, Patrick Mahomes , and Travis Kelce — are not just professional relationships. They’ve been nurtured through mutual trust, time, and authenticity. “It’s taken us a minute to get where we are,” Andrews explained. “You have to build up credibility… with not only viewers at home, your bosses and also, the players and the coaches.”That credibility has extended beyond the sideline. This past offseason, Andrews and Thompson vacationed with Kelce and his girlfriend, Taylor Swift — a couple whose relationship they famously supported from the start. “They want to see you having a good time and smiling,” Andrews shared, reflecting on Fox’s culture that encourages authenticity. “There is nothing wrong with sitting on the [show] desk with Baker after an amazing game... and be like, 'Can we just talk about this last play?' It’s awesome.”Their unique blend of enthusiasm and professionalism has earned them trust in both locker rooms and living rooms. With reported contract extensions on the horizon, it’s clear their approach — candid, joyful, and human — is a winning formula in today’s sports media.Also Read: “I feel guilty”: Christian McCaffrey can’t stop admiring Olivia Culpo’s strength in emotional message after baby’s arrival","Erin Andrews and Charissa Thompson have been with Fox Sports since 2012.

Brooke Hogan reveals why she didn’t show up for Hulk Hogan’s funeral

Brooke Hogan wanted nothing from Hulk Hogan



In the days following the death of wrestling icon Hulk Hogan , a glaring absence at his funeral raised questions. Brooke Hogan , his only daughter, chose not to attend the public service. Certainly, it was an emotional decision that sparked both criticism and curiosity. Now, in a powerful statement and rare interviews, Brooke has broken her silence, revealing why she skipped the final farewell and why she chose to walk away from her father’s will long before his death.On July 24, Hulk Hogan, born Terry Bollea, passed away from a heart attack at 71 after a battle with leukemia. As family, friends, and fans gathered at Indian Rocks Baptist Church in Largo, Florida, Brooke and her husband, Steven Oleksy, took a different path. Instead of mourning at the pulpit, Brooke honored her father by doing something personal, taking their newborn twins to his favorite beach.“My father hated the morbidity of funerals. He didn't want one,” Brooke, 37, wrote in a heartfelt Instagram post. “And although I know people grieve in many ways... I had to make my own decision to honor him the best way I knew how—privately.”Her tribute wasn’t cloaked in flowers or eulogies.“The only thing missing today was him in his pop-up lawn chair watching the waves… and the sunset,” she added, referencing the quiet moments that once defined their bond.She shared photos of her family walking the shoreline with their twins, Oliver Andrew and Molly Gene. “Molly loved the water. I think she’ll be a ‘little fish’ as you called me,” Brooke wrote. “Every grain of sand and every wave reminded me of being your beach baby.”The story behind Brooke’s absence has rather an extended reason than a distaste for public grieving. In a candid conversation with longtime family friend Bubba the Love Sponge, she opened up about years of emotional distance, broken trust, and the moment she asked to be removed from her father’s will.“I was sobbing,” Brooke recalled. “I just said, take me off everything. I don’t want to be a part of it.”She feared the turmoil that would follow Hogan’s death, conflict with her mother Linda, tension with Hogan’s third wife Sky Daily, and rumors of Scientology involvement. “I don’t want to fight Linda. I don’t want to fight Scientology,” she said plainly. “It scared me (via BLAST)”Brooke’s decision came from fatigue. After standing by her father through scandals, leaked tapes, and painful headlines. She admitted the toll it took.Their final exchange was cryptic and unsettling. “He said, ‘I just wanted to call and say I’m sorry for whatever I did,’” Brooke recalled. “I asked, sorry for what? He never said. That was the last time I talked to my dad.”Still, forgiveness remained in her heart. “No matter what he ever did, I would forgive him for it,” she said. “That’s my daddy. I love him and I miss him.”By the time Hulk Hogan’s funeral came around, Brooke had made peace with her choice. “We honored you in the simplest, most genuine way that agreed with my soul,” she wrote. “I pray you are at peace and know how dearly I love you. Rest in heaven, Daddy.”Also Read: Hulk Hogan’s farewell held behind closed doors with tight guest list and no public fanfare","Brooke Hogan, Hulk Hogan's only daughter, chose not to attend his funeral.

UFC legend Daniel Cormier and Chael Sonnen on Brock Lesnar’s return

“They pop for him … they tweaked him a little bit with the hair. I thought it worked.”

Brock Lesnar’s comeback context and legal background

Brock Lesnar made a shocking return to WWE on August 3, 2025, at SummerSlam Night Two in MetLife Stadium, New Jersey. After being away since SummerSlam 2023, he surprised everyone by attacking John Cena, just minutes after Cena lost the Undisputed WWE Title to Cody Rhodes.

They said it felt like Lesnar could still lead the WWE show.Daniel Cormier and Chael Sonnen began their discussion by recalling Lesnar’s entrance at SummerSlam Night Two. Cormier said the show “delivered” when Lesnar came back. Sonnen agreed and noted that WWE tweaked Lesnar’s appearance slightly adding long hair and the crowd loved it. He said:Daniel Cormier added that Lesnar “looked tremendous” and still seems like someone who “could run the WWE.” His tone made it clear: even after two years away, Lesnar’s presence feels dominant and very much in control.Brock Lesnar had not appeared on WWE since he lost to Cody Rhodes at SummerSlam 2023. WWE pulled him from shows, including Royal Rumble 2024, after Brock’s name surfaced in the Janel Grant lawsuit against Vince McMahon. Lesnar was mentioned in the amended complaint filed in February 2025. That legal issue had kept him off TV.Also Read: “Stop Practicing With Men”: Andre Agassi’s Father Once Blamed Male Practice Partners For Shocking Downfall Of Serena Williams And Venus Williams Daniel Cormier had even said Lesnar was on a “banned list,” though it wasn’t clear whether that was by UFC, WWE or TKO.

His comeback was kept secret even WWE staff and media were told nothing.At the end of John Cena vs. CodyRhodes, as the crowd was still cheering, Brock Lesnar’s music hit. He stormed the ring and hit Cena with his signature F‑5 finisher. Then he left without speaking. The show closed on that shocking moment.","Brock Lesnar made a shocking return to WWE on August 3, 2025, at SummerSlam Night Two in MetLife Stadium, New Jersey.

New kids on the block get an instant masterclass

Keenan Allen has shocked the NFL by walking away from Chicago after one low-key season to sensationally re-sign with the Los Angeles Chargers on a one-year, $8.52 million pact. The 33-year-old Pro Bowl magnet, who once refused a pay-cut to stay, is now back to revive his on-field romance with quarterback Justin Herbert. His quick-fire reunion comes as Los Angeles scrambles to replace outgoing playmaker Mike Williams after major roster churn. In a young, untested receiving room, Allen instantly becomes Jim Harbaugh’s most trusted security blanket for must-have first-downs.New head coach Jim Harbaugh is chasing culture and credibility in his first Chargers season. Bringing back an iconic franchise face sends exactly that message to fans and free agents alike. Reports indicate the veteran is expected to jump straight into the starting lineup under the new staff. Insiders believe Allen’s return is less about nostalgia and more about harsh roster reality in Los Angeles.Drafted by the Chargers in 2013, Allen previously churned out 904 receptions, 10,530 yards and 59 touchdowns. His 2023 haul of 108 catches for 1,243 yards proved he was still elite before being traded for refusing to slash his salary.He is widely seen as returning to fill a massive need for the Chargers’ shallow wide-receiver group. Sources say Justin Herbert privately pushed for Allen’s return after struggling to build chemistry with younger targets.Allen now lines up alongside potential sophomore breakout Ladd McConkey, tipped to lead L.A.’s next-gen WR group. Third-round rookie Tre Harris, former first-rounder Quentin Johnston and speed merchant Derius Davis round out the depth chart. Fifth-round pick KeAndre Lambert-Smith becomes the latest prospect looking to absorb the veteran’s route-running genius. “What remains for Allen in terms of production won't come to fruition until the season is underway,” Tom Pelissero warned.Whether Allen can still post Pro Bowl numbers at 33 remains uncertain — but his experience, swagger and built-in chemistry with Herbert give Harbaugh’s Chargers a ready-made control freak on third-down.Also read: Travis Kelce’s unexpected dating ‘dealbreaker’— resurfaced clip sparks fresh Taylor Swift buzz","Keenan Allen has shocked the NFL by walking away from Chicago.

Viral clip sets NFL internet on fire

Retirement hasn't killed Jason Kelce’s hunger to lead

Underdog-to-underdog bond sparks speculation

Legacy grows as coaching rumors explode

Jason Kelce may have officially retired from the NFL this offseason, but one viral training camp moment shows he hasn’t stepped far from the Philadelphia Eagles. Footage of the Super Bowl-winning centre mentoring rookie Hollin Pierce — an undrafted free agent battling for a roster spot — has lit up online, reigniting debate about his next move. In the clip, Kelce is seen actively coaching technique as if still on the payroll, sparking rumours of a comeback in a new capacity. For Eagles fans, the message is clear: retirement might be just a technicality — because Jason Kelce still bleeds green.The 37-year-old Eagles icon, who called time on his 13-year career after the 2023/24 season, made headlines by turning up at Philadelphia’s 2025 training camp. Instead of merely visiting, Kelce jumped into offensive-line drills, guiding Pierce with hands-on, technical coaching. The moment quickly exploded across NFL Twitter/X, with fans sharing the footage and questioning if he had secretly joined Nick Sirianni’s staff. Kelce’s unexpected involvement brought back memories of the leadership he displayed while anchoring the line in Super Bowl LII.Despite earning six First-Team All-Pro selections, seven Pro Bowls and a Super Bowl ring, Kelce is clearly not slowing down. Observers praised how naturally he slipped into a teacher’s role, correcting footwork, adjusting hand placement and quietly motivating the rookie lineman.Such behavior has only fueled speculation that his departure was merely from the roster — not the organization. In true Philadelphia fashion, even after retirement, Kelce continues to serve the locker room he once led.The fact that Kelce mentored Hollin Pierce instead of headline names like Jalen Hurts or Saquon Barkley resonated deeply with Eagles fans. Kelce himself was a sixth-round pick in the 2011 NFL Draft and had to claw his way into a starting role. That underdog spirit seems to have shaped his interest in uplifting rookies who arrive without fanfare. “Jason is the kind of guy who can’t just step away,” one fan wrote — echoing thousands cheering the viral moment.Officially, the Eagles have not announced Kelce in any formal job – but fans believe the soft launch has already begun. With his presence saturating camp coverage, speculation now centres around whether the franchise is easing him into a developmental role. Kelce himself has been coy, simply saying he’s still figuring out life after football while staying close to the game. Yet one thing is undeniable: helping undrafted rookies like Pierce proves Jason Kelce hasn’t left the Eagles — he’s just evolving his impact.Also read: Travis Kelce’s unexpected dating ‘dealbreaker’— resurfaced clip sparks fresh Taylor Swift buzz","Jason Kelce's viral training camp moment shows he hasn't stepped far from the Philadelphia Eagles.

Son Heung-min has completed a sensational move to Los Angeles FC, signing a contract with the Major League Soccer (MLS) club on Tuesday. The 33-year-old South Korean forward ended his 10-year stint at Tottenham Hotspur, marking the end of an era in North London and the beginning of a new chapter in Southern California.Son was spotted in a luxury suite at BMO Stadium during LAFC’s Leagues Cup match against Tigres on Tuesday night. The club is expected to unveil him formally at a press conference on Wednesday. LAFC reportedly paid over $20 million for the transfer — potentially a record-breaking fee in MLS history.During his time at Spurs, Son became a fan favourite and one of the Premier League’s brightest stars, scoring 173 goals in 454 appearances. His departure was marked by an emotional farewell in Seoul last week, where he received a guard of honor and a standing ovation from nearly 65,000 fans during Tottenham’s exhibition against Newcastle.Los Angeles is a symbolic and strategic destination for Son. Home to the largest Korean population outside of Korea, the city offers the perfect platform for Son to extend his influence off the pitch, much like Shohei Ohtani has done with the LA Dodgers in Major League Baseball.Son’s move also reunites him with former Spurs captain Hugo Lloris, now LAFC’s goalkeeper. With LAFC sitting sixth in the Western Conference and chasing another MLS Cup, Son’s arrival is expected to inject pace, creativity, and firepower into the squad.Despite a quieter Premier League season by his standards, Son remains a world-class talent and will likely be a major force in MLS. The move also positions him ideally for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, set to be held across North America, where he is expected to lead South Korea once again.",Son Heung-min has completed a sensational move to Los Angeles FC.

Fenerbahçe coach José Mourinho was moved to tears while paying tribute to his Champions League-winning captain Jorge Costa.Jorge Costa, the former Portuguese football star who captained Porto to their historic 2004 Champions League victory, died on Tuesday at the age of 53 following cardiac arrest at the club’s training center, where he was serving as director of football.According to Portuguese media reports, Costa suffered cardiac arrest at Porto’s training facility and was taken to São João Hospital.The decorated defender earned 50 caps for Portugal’s national team and helped Porto secure eight Portuguese league titles during his playing career.His greatest achievement came as captain under José Mourinho, when Porto stunned Europe by winning the Champions League in 2004, just a year after lifting the UEFA Cup.“It’s part of my history that goes,” said Mourinho.“You have captains, you have leaders. And sometimes it’s not about the armband — it’s about what you represent.“Jorge was one of those guys who, as I used to say, cleaned the garbage and let the coach do his job as a coach, not as the leader of the dressing room. That’s perfection for a coach — when his captain does that work. Of course, I’m very sad. It’s part of my history that goes.“But let’s forget football. Let’s focus on him — on Jorge, a young guy, on his kids, whom I met when they were really young. Now, of course, they are grown men. And yes, I’m very sad, but I’m here because if he could speak to me now, he would say: ‘Come on, do your press conference.’ And he would say: ‘Tomorrow, play the game. Play the game, mister.’‘Win the game and forget about me.’ That would be Jorge. So that’s what I’m going to try to do — do my job today, do my job tomorrow. And then cry after. But today and tomorrow, I have a job to do. And I know Jorge would want me to do it.”Earlier, Mourinho posted an emotional tribute, writing: “Your legacy will stay with us,” and imagining Costa’s words to him: “Mister, stop crying. Tomorrow you have a match, and your boys need you ready and strong.”","Jorge Costa, who captained Porto to their 2004 Champions League victory, died on Tuesday at the age of 53.

Marching in the name of legacy: Sikh regiment debate rekindled in Britain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/marching-in-the-name-of-legacy-sikh-regiment-debate-rekindled-in-britain/articleshow/123097673.cms,"Marching in the name of legacy: Sikh regiment debate rekindled in Britain





The debate over whether there should be a Sikh Regiment in the British Armed Forces has resurfaced but the ministry of defence (MOD) insists there are no such plans.The debate was triggered after Lord Sahota asked defence minister Lord Coaker in the House of Lords on 7 July whether there was any progress of having a Sikh regiment in the British Army, given the loyalty of Sikh soldiers in both world wars. Coaker replied, “Let me consider that request from my noble friend. I am quite happy to meet him to see what more we can do to recognise the contribution of soldiers such as Sikhs.” This led to UK headlines such as ‘Minister open to British Army Sikh regiment proposal.’But MOD sources told TOI, “Over the years, there have been conversations about this, but it would breach Britain’s anti-discriminatory laws. There are no current plans for a Sikh regiment as it goes against the Equality Act. We want to do something to recognise Sikh contributions in some way, but not through a Sikh regiment.”Lord Sahota, whose grandfathers served in the British Indian army, including the 15Punjab Regiment, told TOI: “I don’t think it would go against the Equality Act.”He pointed out the British Army has had the Staffordshire regiment and currently has the Brigade of Gurkhas, the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, the Royal Welsh and Royal Regiment of Scotland and so on.“It doesn’t mean other faiths like Hindus, Muslims or Christians wouldn’t be able to serve in a Sikh Regiment. If you are in the Royal Regiment of Scotland, it doesn’t mean you have to be Scottish.”.“We are struggling to recruit ethnic minorities in this country,” he said, and so having a Sikh Regiment would give Sikhs a “reason to join.” “They would wear turbans and have beards and it would reflect Sikh heritage and values,” he said.“It would foster a better relationship with other countries such as India and South Asia as well,” he added.There are estimated to be only 200 Sikhs in the British Armed Forces currently.“People tend to go into the army if their grandfather was in it. Sikhs don’t have that role model here,” Sahota said. He said if there was a Punjab or Sikh Regiment, they would have that role model. “There are more than 700k Sikhs in the UK. I am sure quite a few would be prepared to follow in their great grandfather’s footsteps. King Charles even told a Sikh soldier he wanted to see more Sikhs in the British Army,” the Labour life peer added.India-born Sahota (74) said he plans to meet Lord Coaker after the summer recess and will take Sikhs in the British Army and MPs with him.Preet Kaur Gill MP, who has met the armed forces minister many times, to raise the issue, said: “The ministers are looking at doing something. No decision has been made. It is being looked at. There have been existing Sikh regiments in the army. It’s not anything new.”The modern Indian army has a Sikh Regiment, which continues to recruit from the Sikh community and a Punjab Regiment. The Sikh regiment is one of the most decorated regiments and traces its origins to the first Sikh battalion raised by the East India Company in 1846.But veteran army reservist Captain Jay Singh-Sohal OBE is against the idea.“Even if they did this they wouldn’t fill out a regiment with recruits - we struggle with getting young Sikhs into the military as it is. A Sikh regiment isn’t going to change this and would become massively understaffed. A single battalion regiment requires 700 plus. A Sikh regiment will fail as it won’t get 700 plus young Sikhs joining. And if the answer is to look beyond Sikhs then what’s the point of a race specific regiment?” he said.“These British Sikh politicians need to make the argument for the benefit of Sikh specific regiments in the context of the threats we face today,” Sohal added. “It’s not about harking to past glories but about practical ways in which Sikhs today can make an impact through military service. I believe Sikhs do make an impact as we serve alongside those who represent Great Britain as a whole,” Johal said.“The Sikh identity is already recognised as a strength in the British Army and protected by UK law. We don’t need special treatment. We already practice our faith in the army. A modern army is about bringing capabilities and insights from different walks of life and backgrounds to create a synergy into a whole team setting. Sikhs can contribute a lot to that. Having a Sikh specific regiment won’t motivate more youngsters to join. What would, is if they see value in soldiering or developing themselves as a leader through military experience. I challenge Preet Gill and Lord Sahota to find me 20 Sikhs willing to sign up to the British Army right now, regardless of whether we have a Sikh regiment or not. They won’t be able to do it.”Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi MP, chair of the defence committee, which scrutinises the work of the MOD, said: “Given the extraordinary history, martial traditions and sacrifices of Sikh soldiers, especially during both world wars, I have supported the establishment of a British Sikh Regiment for several years, including meetings with ministers and other activists.""""While the campaign has not achieved success thus far, we will certainly continue to make the case"", Dhesi added."," debate over whether there should be a Sikh Regiment in the British Armed Forces has resurfaced.

Black Sabbath – The sound of doom being born. N.I.B. – Lucifer’s love song, sludgy and sinister. Crazy Train – Ozzy’s solo battle cry of chaos and survival. Mr. Crowley – Gothic mysticism powered by Randy Rhoads’ guitar wizardry. Bark at the Moon – 1980s metal excess distilled into one song. Mama, I’m Coming Home – A surprisingly tender ode from the madman. No More Tears – Dark, cinematic, and bass-heavy brilliance.

The Working-Class Hero



WORKING CLASS HERO. (Ultimate Mix, 2020) - John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (official music video HD)





Ryan Coogler’s– the best movie to come out so far this year – begins with the line: “There are legends of people born with a gift of making music so true, it can pierce the veil between life and death.” The reference is to the young blues musician Sammie “Preacher Boy” Moore whose music could summon the undead. Ozzy Osbourne too, was born with the gift of making music so true, it could pierce the veil between life and death.Two weeks ago, when Ozzy – perched on a giant black throne like some deranged medieval king – growled, “Let’s go crazy one last f**** time,” before launching into Paranoid, it felt like theatre. Now it feels like prophecy. On July 22, John Michael Osbourne – yes, he had a perfectly ordinary name before the bat-biting and ant-snorting – left this world, but not before reinventing what sound, fury, and darkness could mean.Ozzy’s voice was never operatic, never “clean.” It was a cracked cathedral bell, wailing raw truth. With Black Sabbath, he didn’t just sing; he conjured fear. Tony Iommi’s down-tuned guitar, forged after losing fingertips in a factory accident, rumbled like industrial machinery.Geezer Butler’s bass rolled like thunder, while Bill Ward’s drumming cracked like collapsing steel. Above it all, Ozzy’s haunted wail floated like a ghostly siren, cutting through the darkness.Black Sabbath’s rise was almost accidental. In 1968, Ozzy scribbled an ad that read “Ozzy Zig needs gig.” He found Iommi, Butler, and Ward, four factory boys marinated in Birmingham’s soot and gloom, and together they invented something the world hadn’t heard before: doom.Sabbath’s sound was unlike anything in rock at the time. Iommi’s guitar riffs were thick slabs of distortion, down-tuned to sound like machinery grinding in the dark. Geezer Butler’s bass didn’t just follow the guitar – it roared and throbbed, a counterpoint storm. Bill Ward fused jazz swing with sledgehammer beats, giving their heaviness an eerie groove. And Ozzy’s voice? It wasn’t angelic or operatic – it was a nasal, haunted chant, cutting through the sludge like a prophet warning of the apocalypse. This combination was so raw and otherworldly that it left the flower-power generation stunned and thrilled in equal measure.Their 1970 debut Black Sabbath – with its sinister tritone riff – was practically a séance. Then came Paranoid, an album that blended war paranoia, industrial despair, and existential horror into songs like War Pigs and Iron Man. Sabbath wasn’t peace and love; Sabbath was the sound of living through nightmares and learning to dance with them.The ripple effect was seismic. Without Sabbath, there would be no Metallica’s Master of Puppets, no Slayer’s Reign in Blood, no grunge sound of Alice in Chains or Nirvana’s darker edges. Even bands like Soundgarden, Iron Maiden, and Slipknot have Sabbath’s DNA stitched into their riffs. They didn’t just start a band; they started an entire language of music that countless artists still speak. Even Marvel’s Cinematic Universe might not have landed the same punch if “I Am Iron Man” hadn’t played when Tony Stark announced the arrival of the coolest superhero of them all.By the mid-70s, Sabbath were rock gods. But Ozzy, the self-destructive prince, was spiralling. His love affair with alcohol and drugs turned every tour into a circus of chaos. By 1979, the band fired him – a decision that could have ended his career. Instead, it marked the beginning of his wildest and most successful chapter.Fired, broke, and drowning in substances, Ozzy should have been a rock ‘n’ roll casualty. Instead, he turned into the genre’s greatest survivor – thanks to Sharon Arden (soon to be Sharon Osbourne ), who pulled him from the brink. She managed his career with iron resolve and cunning, building the Ozzy myth as both madman and messiah.The stories from this era read like biblical plagues crossed with drunken comedy sketches. The most infamous is the bat incident. In 1982, during a show in Des Moines, a fan threw a bat on stage. Ozzy, assuming it was rubber, bit its head off. It wasn’t rubber. Blood gushed. He was rushed for rabies shots – and a legend was born.Then there was the Alamo fiasco: a drunk Ozzy urinated on a cenotaph in San Antonio, earning a ten-year city ban. And the Mötley Crüe tour in 1984 – where, in a grotesque contest of dares, Ozzy reportedly snorted a line of ants and licked up a puddle of urine, leaving the band speechless. “Alright, Ozzy, you win,” Tommy Lee later said – a detail immortalized inand repeated by Lee himself, though guitarist Jake E. Lee disputes the “ants” part. Whatever the truth, the story has passed into heavy metal’s folklore.Ozzy didn’t just flirt with chaos; he signed a lifelong contract with it, took it on a drug-fuelled honeymoon, and still managed to write chart-toppers while it set fire to the hotel curtains. It was like Keith Richards , he had some imaginary pact with the devil.In 1980, Blizzard of Ozz exploded into the charts with Crazy Train and Mr. Crowley, proving Ozzy didn’t need Sabbath to remain metal’s high priest. Randy Rhoads, his guitarist, brought a neoclassical brilliance that elevated songs into anthems. Rhoads’ tragic death in a 1982 plane crash could have crushed Ozzy completely. Instead, it hardened him, fuelling Diary of a Madman and Bark at the Moon.By the 1990s, Ozzy’s reputation as the lovable lunatic of metal was solidified. No More Tears gave him another hit parade, with tracks like Mama, I’m Coming Home. His voice – nasal, haunted, indomitable – aged not like wine but like rusted steel: jagged, unyielding, unforgettable.Then came Ozzfest, a metal carnival that gave both legends and newcomers a stage. Ozzy, once the face of controversy, became metal’s benevolent elder. And then came The Osbournes, MTV’s reality show that introduced him as a hilariously foul-mouthed, bumbling family man, swearing at dogs and microwaves. The Prince of Darkness became America’s favourite sitcom dad – albeit one who bit bats.Though Sabbath had fired him in 1979, fate – and fan demand – brought them back together. In 2011, Ozzy reunited with Iommi and Butler for a new album, 13, which topped charts worldwide. Their farewell tour, aptly titled The End, concluded in 2017 in Birmingham, closing the circle where it all began.But Villa Park, July 5, 2025, was the true epilogue. The 76-year-old Ozzy, slowed by Parkinson’s, returned home for one last show titled Back to the Beginning. Seated on a towering black throne adorned with a giant bat, he performed with Sabbath in full force. When he growled “Let’s go crazy one last f**** time,” the 45,000 fans roared as if summoning every demon and angel he’d ever sung about. His voice – cracked, frail, but still otherworldly – soared over the crowd like it did in 1970.It was also fitting that the farewell happened in Villa Park – the same ground celebrated by Ozzy just last year when Aston Villa launched their new kit with a promotional video featuring him and Geezer Butler, soundtracked by Paranoid. For the working-class hero from Aston, football and metal were cut from the same cloth: raw, tribal, and electric.Many years ago, a man from Liverpool – murdered by a fanatic for not living according to the ethos of a popular song – wrote Working Class Hero, mocking society for crushing individuality. Ozzy, the son of Aston’s factories, embodied that rebellion. He never conformed – not to society, not to rock clichés, not to life or death. He lived on his terms, and he left on his terms, gifting us one last sermon of riffs and wails.Ozzy is gone, but the echo of his howl – that haunted, unrepentant scream – still vibrates through every heavy riff played today. Better clear some room, Lucifer, because hell is about to get a new frontman. The Prince of Darkness is coming home.","Ozzy’s voice was never operatic, never “clean” It was a cracked cathedral bell, wailing raw truth. With Black Sabbath, he didn’t just sing; he conjured fear.

Natasha Archer has been by the Princess of Wales’s side since 2010. She selected outfits for overseas tours, was even on hand at the hospital for royal baby photo calls, ready with spare outfits and supplies and was promoted to Senior Private Executive Assistant in 2022. Last week Kensington Palace confirmed Archer, now 37, is leaving to start a private “luxury consultancy.”Soon after the news broke, Archer switched her long-private Instagram profile to public. Royal watchers noticed two quick moves. She stopped following Meghan Markle , the Duchess’s lifestyle label As Ever, and several friends in Meghan’s circle, including makeup artist Daniel Martin and polo player Delfina Blaquier.The timing set off fresh speculation because the royal family is quietly trying to ease tensions with the Sussexes. Palace sources say aides for King Charles and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex held an informal meeting in London this month to explore next steps toward better relations. Prince William’s team did not attend, leaving doubts about how far any thaw can go.Commentators see Archer’s “unfollow” spree as a public hint that fences remain unmended. The Blast, citing insider chatter, called the move a “controversial stunt” that risks undercutting reconciliation plans said to be backed by Princess Kate herself.People who have worked with Archer stress her loyalty to the Wales household. She received the Royal Victorian Order in 2019 for personal service and is married to royal photographer Chris Jackson. Friends say her new consultancy will advise private clients on travel logistics and event styling, skills honed during fifteen years on royal duty.Neither Kensington Palace nor the Sussex office has commented on the social-media changes. Online, opinions split quickly. Some see the unfollows as a harmless reset before Archer’s career move. Others view them as a subtle show of support for Kate during a sensitive phase in family diplomacy.What happens next will likely unfold off camera. Kate is said to be focused on her children’s summer break and on a fuller return to public engagements later in the year. Meghan remains in California, preparing for new launches under her As Ever brand. Behind the scenes, advisers on both sides are expected to keep talking, while Archer steps into private life with new clients and fewer royal handles in her feed.For royal watchers, the small click of an unfollow button has added one more twist to a story that shows no sign of fading from the spotlight.","Natasha Archer has been by the Princess of Wales’s side since 2010.

Having settled all the doubts, now it’s time for the two to set concrete plans for the future.Gill landed in England with an Indian team in the first week of June with questions being raised about his inexperience.Now he deserves to go off the constant high-performance routine of an India cricketer for a few days.Meanwhile, Gambhir’s tenure as India’s head coach has revolved around his strong people-over-individuals philosophy. He is also a coach who came into the Indian dressing room to wipe out the superstar culture.Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Ravichandran Ashwin retired from Test cricket before the selectors could get down to planning for the English summer. Jasprit Bumrah, the biggest name after Kohli and Rohit, declared he was available for only three of the five Tests.India boarded the flight from Mumbai to London after a disastrous first six months in Test cricket under Gambhir. The ICC Champions Trophy triumph in March aside, Gambhir knew he had to deliver. Not that there was any immediate threat to his position, but a drubbing with a fresh team here would have been detrimental to his reputation. The first thing he did was to instill enough conviction in Gill and the team.“Before the start of the series, Gauti bhai (Gambhir) said that we are a young team, but we don’t want to be looked at as a young team. We want to be looked at as a gun team’. The way we played today showed why we are a gun team,” Gill said. This has also been Gambhir’s line of thinking. After India pulled off a draw in the fourth Test in Manchester, having trailed almost throughout the match, a typically combative Gambhir decided to front up to the media. “I don’t like to call this a team in transition. I will say they are inexperienced,” he had said.There is this unmistakable aversion to the word ‘transition’. “Even if there was no transition or if we had the old players, everything would have looked good if batters and bowlers performed,” Gill said. Then he went on to highlight his batting lineup’s stellar performance in the series.“Almost every batter in the series has performed. They have scored hundreds. They have scored runs in crucial and crunch situations,” he mentioned, offering enough hints that this team management had moved on long before the world could.Gill’s confidence in his batting lineup is backed up by numbers. Gill himself scored 754 runs while KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja finished with more than 500 runs. Rishabh Pant scored 479 runs in the seven innings he batted before suffering a broken foot. Yashasvi Jaiswal finished with 412 runs.On the topic of transition or inexperience, Gill has been bullish about the potential of his team. He believed the scoreline before the fifth Test wasn’t a true reflection of the cricket India have played. He maintained that even after the win on Monday. For him, even if India had lost the last Test, the scoreline wouldn’t have been a fair one.The plans will be taking shape soon. There is a certain assertion in Gill’s speech now which suggests he is a man who is firmly in charge. He is already looking ahead.Handling BumrahThat India managed to win two Tests on the tour without Bumrah playing must have settled a lot of nerves. TOI understands that Bumrah will either play an entire Test series or sit out of it in future. So, it could come down to picking either the two-Test series against West Indies at home in Oct before South Africa come in Dec for another two Tests. India don’t have another five-Test series in two years. With the team expected to play on spin-friendly pitches in India, there won’t be much load on the pacers. The selectors and Bumrah can comfortably plan his availability for white-ball tournaments like the T20 World Cup at home in Feb-March next year.With Gill and Gambhir striking a cord, there could be a temptation to revisit the ODI leadership group going forward. Gill is already the designated vice-captain in the ODI format. His consistency with the bat makes him indispensable.With incumbent Rohit Sharma not being a certainty for the 2027 ODI World Cup in South Africa, there are murmurs in the board that if a new captain had to take charge, he should get a fair time to shape the ODI team according to his philosophies. India don’t play much ODI cricket in the build-up to the 2027 World Cup.",India captain Shubman Gill had his friends and family over to celebrate a memorable tour that has placed him at the centre of Indian cricket’s power centre. Head coach Gautam Gambhir checked out of the team hotel by evening.

India need EIGHT wickets, England 324 runs: Who will come out on top at The Oval?

NEW DELHI: Congress MP and renowned public figure Shashi Tharoor has once again sparked debate around Virat Kohli’s retirement from Test cricket, calling it “premature” and urging the Indian stalwart to return to the longest format. Tharoor’s latest remarks came after India’s spirited 2-2 series draw in England, under new skipper Shubman Gill , who led a young side admirably in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.Despite India fighting back from a 1-2 deficit with a draw in Manchester and a nail-biting win at The Oval, Tharoor couldn’t help but reflect on what might have been with Kohli in the lineup.“I was just admiring Joe @root66’s consistent excellence as England’s hardy perennial at age 35, while @imVkohli, just two years older, languishes in premature retirement,” Tharoor posted on social media, in reply to a debate on Kohli’s potential return.Earlier during the fifth Test, Tharoor had already voiced his emotions, posting: “I’ve been missing @imVkohli a few times during this series, but never as much as in this Test match. His grit and intensity, his inspirational presence in the field, not to mention his abundant batting skills, might have led to a different outcome. Is it too late to call him out of retirement? Virat, the nation needs you!”Kohli, 36, announced his Test retirement in May 2025, ending a stellar 14-year red-ball career with 123 Tests, 9,230 runs, 30 hundreds, and a top score of 254*. He remains India's most successful Test captain in England, with three wins, and was central to several near-misses — including the closely contested 2018 series and the COVID-delayed 2021-22 finale.As Team India embraces a new era, Tharoor’s impassioned appeal may reignite calls from fans and pundits alike for King Kohli’s red-ball encore.","Congress MP and renowned public figure Shashi Tharoor has once again sparked debate around Virat Kohli’s retirement from Test cricket.

Poll What do you think about Mohammed Siraj's performance in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy? Outstanding Good Average

NEW DELHI: India pacer Mohammed Siraj returned to the country on Wednesday, landing in Mumbai after a heroic performance in the recently concluded Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, where India drew 2-2 against England. The 31-year-old fast bowler was the leading wicket-taker in the five-match Test series, finishing with 23 scalps at an average of 32.43.A video of Siraj’s arrival at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport quickly went viral on social media, showing him walking out in crisp black casuals and acknowledging a small group of fans who had gathered to welcome him. Though there were enthusiastic requests for selfies and autographs, Siraj, ever low-key off the field, made a quick exit.Siraj’s performances in England, especially in the absence of Jasprit Bumrah for two Tests due to workload management, elevated his status from support act to spearhead. He produced a six-wicket haul at Birmingham, where his 6/70 helped India gain a 180-run lead, and followed it up with a stunning five-wicket spell at The Oval, triggering England’s collapse from 301/4 to 367 all out.Dubbed ‘Miyan Magic’, Siraj silenced critics who once pointed to his erratic spells, emerging as a dependable and tireless workhorse in overseas conditions. Since his Test debut in 2020, Siraj has bowled 1069.5 overs, taking 123 wickets in 41 Tests—only behind Bumrah in terms of workload among Indian pacers.With his passion, relentless energy, and emotional intensity, Siraj has not just delivered results but has become a symbol of India's evolving pace identity.",Mohammed Siraj returned to India on Wednesday after England series.
