SALIVA BAN LIFTED

IPL: How will GT, LSG, DC, PBKS, RR fare? Greenstone Lobo predicts

INTRODUCTION OF THE ‘SECOND BALL’ RULE

IMPACT PLAYER RULE TO STAY

DRS FOR HEIGHT AND OFF-SIDE WIDES

NEW DELHI: Over the years, the Indian Premier League (IPL) has introduced several innovative rules, such as strategic timeouts and the Impact Player rule, to enhance the excitement of the tournament. With IPL 2025 set to begin, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has introduced a few more changes while retaining some existing rules.Bowlers will once again be allowed to use saliva on the ball in IPL 2025.This decision was made after discussions with captains from all 10 teams, with the majority supporting the move.The saliva ban was originally imposed as a health and safety measure during the COVID-19 pandemic, but with the restrictions now lifted, bowlers can resume the practice.A significant new rule—the ‘Second Ball’ rule—will be implemented in IPL 2025 to counter the effects of dew in night matches.Dew often hampers bowlers' ability to grip the ball, providing batters with an undue advantage, particularly during run chases.To address this, umpires will assess the condition of the ball after the 11th over of the second innings.If excessive dew is detected, the bowling team will be allowed to use a new ball. This rule, however, will not apply to afternoon matches.The Impact Player rule, introduced in previous editions, will continue in IPL 2025.This rule allows teams to substitute one player during a match, providing more opportunities for uncapped players who might not otherwise get a chance to play.The Decision Review System (DRS) will now include referrals for height-based no-balls and wides outside the off-stump. With the use of Hawk-Eye technology and ball tracking, umpires will have additional support in making accurate decisions.","IPL 2025 has been announced by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.

Hilarity Ensues After Los Angeles Lakers Star LeBron James Seemingly 'Forgot' His Wife,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/hilarity-ensues-after-los-angeles-lakers-star-lebron-james-seemingly-forgot-his-wife/articleshow/119269462.cms,"LeBron and Savannah James (Image via Getty)

Did LeBron James really forget about his wife?



King James is a thorough gentleman



LeBron James forgets Savannah was with him leaving her with only one choice at the event

LeBron and Savannah James are two people who show every day how much they love and respect each other. The couple has been going strong from day one and is yet to falter. But what about 'forget'? Well, if you ask some people, they might tell you that the Los Angeles Lakers star allegedly forgot about his wife while the two were at an event for their youngest son, Bryce James .Recently, LeBron and his wife, Savannah James, were attending their son, Bryce's game, where he and his teammates were crowned California State Division 1 champions . While the two parents were quite happy with their child's achievements and seemed to be in good spirits, some fans made a little fuss about how LeBron James had seemingly left Savannah behind when they got to the venue.King James was seen walking ahead, something rare for the Lakers star, as he and Savannah are usually seen walking side by side. But in this instance, he walked ahead while the queen was seen coming in after him. And that led to fans needlessly pointing the whole thing out, making a conspiracy out of thin air. For someone like James, who is always praising his wife, forgetting her would be a little too much.While he may have taken his seat before his wife, that did not mean King James had foregone all his manners. After taking his own seat in the front row, LeBron made sure that Savannah's seat was lowered, so that she didn't have any problem while sitting. Just because he walked ahead of her for once, does not mean he forgot he had his wife with him.The two were seen having a good time, as their younger son and his high school team earned yet another victory before they were declared California State Division 1 champions, much to the delight of the James family. Bryce will be moving to Arizona in the fall, where we will be joining the Wildcats. His father, on the other hand, although is out with injury as of now, is expected to return by the end of next week.Also Read: Look Out JJ Redick: Injury Means Nothing as LeBron James Takes to Coaching the Los Angeles Lakers from the Bench","LeBron James and his wife, Savannah James, were attending their son, Bryce's game.

Why the Lakers Could Land Kennard

Luka Doncic of the Los Angeles Lakers (Image via Getty)

Financial Flexibility: Kennard’s relatively low salary demands make him an affordable target for the Lakers Proven Track Record: His consistent shooting numbers demonstrate his ability to contribute immediately Fit with Superstars: Kennard’s skill set complements the playstyles of Doncic and James, making him a valuable addition.

“We’ll see if the magical negotiating tactics that allowed Pelinka to pry Luka away from the Mavs can get to work snagging Kennard away from what will be multiple suitors.”

Theare reportedly setting their sights on adding sharpshooters this offseason, and one name that has emerged as a potential target is. This player could be a key addition to the Lakers’ roster as they aim to build a competitive team around their superstar duo of Luka Doncic and LeBron James Luke Kennard, a six-foot-five shooting guard of the Memphis Grizzlies , has built a reputation as one of the league’s most reliable three-point shooters. This season, he’s shooting an impressive 44.6% from beyond the arc, maintaining a career average of 43.9%. His ability to stretch the floor and knock down shots consistently makes him an ideal fit for the Los Angeles Lakers, who are prioritizing floor spacers to complement their star players.Luke Kennard’s affordability is another factor that makes him an attractive option for the Lakers. Currently earning $9.3 million in the final year of his contract, Kennard has never made more than $15 million annually. This financial flexibility is crucial for the Los Angeles Lakers, who are managing significant salary commitments to Doncic and James.As Colin Keane of the Sporting News notes:Luke Kennard’s NBA journey began when he was drafted by the Detroit Pistons in 2017. After spending two and a half seasons in Detroit, he was traded to the LA Clippers, where he continued to showcase his shooting prowess. In 2022, he was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies, where he has become a key contributor.Now, as an upcoming unrestricted free agent, Kennard is expected to draw interest from multiple teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers. The Grizzlies will likely attempt to retain him, but the Lakers’ front office, led by GM Rob Pelinka, is known for its strategic negotiating tactics.The Los Angeles Lakers ’ offseason strategy revolves around adding cost-effective shooters who can thrive alongside their star players. Kennard’s skill set aligns perfectly with this vision. His ability to knock down threes at a high clip would provide much-needed spacing for Doncic and James, allowing them to operate more effectively on the court.The Lakers' desire to assemble a team with a variety of players is further demonstrated by their interest in Kennard. Dalton Knecht, a rookie shooter, was traded away earlier this season, but Pelinka was able to reverse the transaction and keep him. Knecht's future with the squad is still up in the air, though, which highlights the necessity for dependable shooters like Kennard.While Luke Kennard’s fit with the Lakers is undeniable, the team will face competition from other suitors. The Grizzlies are expected to make a strong push to retain him, and other teams in need of shooting could also enter the fray.However, Pelinka’s track record of successful negotiations, including the acquisition of Luka Doncic , gives the Lakers a fighting chance. As Keane points out:The Los Angeles Lakers’ pursuit of Luke Kennard shows their commitment to building a roster capable of competing at the highest level. His shooting, affordability, and fit with the team’s stars make him a prime target for the upcoming offseason. While challenges remain, the Los Angeles Lakers’ front office has proven its ability to pull off significant moves in the past.Also read: How the Los Angeles Lakers Transformed Into a True Title Contender Ahead of the Playoffs As the offseason approaches, all eyes will be on Rob Pelinka and the Lakers to see if they can successfully lure Kennard away from Memphis and bolster their roster for a championship run.","Luke Kennard is a six-foot-five shooting guard of the Memphis Grizzlies.

KOLKATA: Rajat Patidar will be happy to be back at the Eden Gardens. It was here, back in 2022, that Patidar’s cricketing career changed overnight. In a squad having players like Faf du Plessis, Virat Kohli and Glenn Maxwell, it was Patidar who stood tall that night against Lucknow Super Giants in the IPL Eliminator.Coming in to bat at No. 3, Patidar got his first T20 century as he set the Eden stands on fire, hitting 12 fours and seven sixes to remain unbeaten on 112 off 54 balls. That incidentally remains the highest IPL score at this venue.On Saturday, he will be arriving in a new avatar, donning the captain’s hat for the first time for a franchise. With RCB yet to win the trophy, there will be pressure on him. But adjusting to situations is all that counts in a fast-paced tournament like the IPL.Patidar has matured as a skipper, leading Madhya Pradesh to the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 final last season and ending up as the second-highest run-getter in the tournament.When it comes to leadership, KKR will also be no different.In any sport, it’s not often that we get to see a side parting ways with its winning skipper. But KKR decided to walk a different path as they released Shreyas Iyer, who won them their third IPL trophy last year. They also lost their think-tank after mentor Gautam Gambhir, who was largely credited for their revival after back-to-back seventh-place finishes, took up the national team’s coaching job and Abhishek Nayar and Ryan ten Doeschate also joined him.Naming Ajinkya Rahane , who did not seem to be KKR’s first-choice player — he was picked up in the mega auction at his base price, that too on the second call — as their new skipper could prove to be a double-edged sword for the defending champions.Back in KKR after 2022, Rahane will not only have to rebuild a winning formula with coach Chandrakant Pandit and new mentor Dwayne Bravo, but he will also have to score consistently to cement his place in the power-packed batting side.Although not a natural T20 player, Rahane has great credentials as a skipper. Who can forget India’s greatest-ever overseas Test triumph under him at the Gabba in Jan 2021! Rahane has won all the three ODI games that he has captained India in and got one victory in two T20Is as the skipper. He also won the Ranji and Irani titles as skipper in 2024 and top-scored for Mumbai in the Mushtaq Ali T20 meet scoring 469 runs in eight matches at a strike rate of 164.56.But his IPL record is not that encouraging. Captaining a side (RR) last in the IPL in 2019, he won just nine of the 25 matches. For the skippers, there’s so much to play for in this IPL.","Rajat Patidar will be donning the captain’s hat for the first time for a franchise.

After going unsold at the mega auction, all-rounder Shardul Thakur is all set to sign an Indian Premier League IPL ) contract with Lucknow Super Giants (LSG). Thakur has been with the side since their preparations for the 2025 season got underway and will be replacing injured Mohsin Khan in the Rishabh Pant-led squad.The official announcement is yet to be made but it's learnt that Thakur has been informed about the decision and will be travelling with the side to Visakhapatnam for their season opener vs Delhi Capitals.Mohsin picked up an ACL injury which has impaired him from featuring in any cricket for the last three months, and then had a calf strain when he resumed bowling in the LSG nets. With their core group of seamers still recovering at the Board of Control for Cricket in India's (BCCI) Centre of Excellence (CoE), the management was forced to take the call on an injury replacement.The India-heavy pace attack features Akash Deep, Avesh Khan and Mayank Yadav but all are yet to join the IPL franchise. While Akash Deep and Mayank are at the CoE, Avesh still hasn't linked up with the squad after recovering from the knee injury. As far as pace sensation Mayank is concerned, he has started bowling at reduced intensity in the nets but is far from attaining match fitness.From side strain to hamstring to issue in the left side of the back and now the right side, the youngster's body has gone through a lot and he is yet to play a competitive fixture since October last year. Even if the 22-year-old gets an all-clear from the CoE to join his IPL side, it will be nothing short of a miracle if he lasts the distance.The LSG camp is yet to give details of their seamers' injuries and mentor Zaheer Khan insisted that they will follow a dynamic approach this season.""The situation is dynamic for some of our players due to injuries. But it’s time that we look for positives and adopt things to tackle the situation amicably. Some players are at the National Cricket Academy and others are spending time with their physios. Right now, it will not be right to say anything about this. The situation will be dynamic this season,” Zaheer said in a media interaction.In absence of their core seamers, Shardul will now be leading the pack as he is the most experienced bowler in the set-up. Shamar Joseph is the only overseas seamer in the LSG squad which also features youngsters like Rajvardhan Hangargekar and Prince Yadav. While the spin department wears a settled look, the same can't be said about the quicks.","Shardul Thakur is set to sign an IPL contract with Lucknow Super Giants.

George Foreman vs Muhammad Ali - Oct. 30, 1974 - Entire fight - Rounds 1 - 8 & Interview

Top 5 George Foreman Knockouts | Big George Foreman Now Playing Exclusively in Movie Theaters

Former heavyweight boxing champion George Foreman passed away at age 76 on Friday, as announced by his family.Foreman's family shared the news through a statement on his official Instagram page, confirming his peaceful departure on March 21, 2025, while surrounded by his loved ones.""With profound sorrow, we announce the passing of our beloved George Edward Foreman Sr, who peacefully departed on March 21, 2025, surrounded by loved ones. We are grateful for the outpouring of love and prayers, and kindly ask for privacy as we honour the extraordinary life of a man we were blessed to call our own.""Foreman was born in Texas on January 10, 1949, and grew up in Houston with J.D. Foreman, who was often absent and struggled with alcohol. He later discovered that J.D. was not his biological father when his real father, a decorated World War II veteran, contacted him after his heavyweight title victory.His teenage years were marked by trouble, leading him to drop out of school at 16.""At 13-years-old, George was about 6-foot-2, 200 pounds and the terrorist in the neighbourhood. And when you're bigger and stronger and think you're better than everyone else, you take things,"" his younger brother Roy told the BBC in 2024.He began boxing at age 16, which would change the course of his life.""I wanted to a football player. I tried boxing just to show my friends that I wasn't afraid. Well, 25 fights and one year later, I was an Olympic gold medallist.""At the 1968 Mexico Olympics, 19-year-old Foreman won the super-heavyweight gold medal. He celebrated by waving an American flag in the ring, just days after fellow African Americans Tommie Smith and John Carlos made their black power salute.Standing at 6-foot-4, Foreman dominated the heavyweight division with his size and strength. He earned a title shot against Joe Frazier and won convincingly in two rounds.By the time he faced Muhammad Ali in the famous "" Rumble in the Jungle "" in October 1974, Foreman had an undefeated record of 40 fights. He lost to Ali in eight rounds, largely due to Ali's ""rope-a-dope"" strategy.""I just couldn't believe I'd lost the world title. It was the most embarrassing moment of my life. It went from pride to pity. That's devastating.""After losing to Jimmy Young in Puerto Rico in March 1977, Foreman experienced a religious awakening and retired at age 28 to become an ordained minister.He returned to boxing ten years later, fighting 21 times and winning all bouts, with 20 knockouts. He secured title shots against Evander Holyfield in 1991 and Tommy Morrison in 1993, losing both on points.In November 1994, wearing the same shorts from his Ali fight, Foreman knocked out Michael Moorer in the 10th round to become the oldest heavyweight world champion at 45 years and 299 days.He later lost his WBA and IBF titles for refusing mandatory defences. His final fight was a points loss to Shannon Briggs in 1997 at age 48.Foreman's professional record stood at 76 wins from 81 fights, with 68 victories by knockout.After boxing, he found success with the ""George Foreman Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine"" and hosted a TV show called ""Bad Dads"" in 1996.His personal life included four marriages and twelve children, with ten biological and two adopted. He named all five of his sons George Edward.""If one of us goes up, then we all go up together, and if one goes down, we all go down together!""","Former heavyweight boxing champion George Foreman passed away at age 76 on Friday.

What happens if match is affected by rain?

The opening match of IPL 2025 between Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bengaluru at Eden Gardens on Saturday, March 22, faces uncertainty due to weather concerns. The India Meteorological Department has issued an orange alert for Kolkata, with forecasts predicting rain and thunderstorms that could affect both the match (scheduled for 7:30pm IST) and the opening ceremony (for 6pm IST).The weather situation in West Bengal is unstable due to a trough extending from central Odisha to Vidarbha and wind confluence over eastern India. An anticyclonic circulation over the Bay of Bengal at lower tropospheric levels is adding to the weather complexity.The forecast indicates scattered light to moderate rainfall with thunderstorms, lightning, and gusty winds across parts of West Bengal from March 20 to March 22. Kolkata's Regional Meteorological Centre has specifically predicted thunderstorms with lightning and strong gusty surface winds for match day.The temperature in Kolkata is expected to range between 29°C and 22°C, lower than usual due to cloudy conditions. The humidity level is forecasted at 65%, which could impact pitch conditions if play occurs.The morning hours of March 22 are expected to see cloudy skies with showers, with precipitation chances reaching 66% around 11 AM. This could affect the preparations for the opening ceremony scheduled between 6:20 PM and 6:45 PM IST.The afternoon forecast shows intervals of clouds and sunshine, with rain probability decreasing to 25% by late afternoon. During the evening, when the match is scheduled to begin with toss at 7:00 PM IST, initial rain chances reduce to 10%.However, the precipitation probability increases to 70% by 11 PM IST, suggesting possible interruptions during the match. The ground staff at Eden Gardens has already covered the playing area since Thursday as a precautionary measure.Practice sessions for both teams were shortened on Friday due to drizzle, forcing players to move indoors. The match features KKR's new captain Ajinkya Rahane against RCB led by Rajat Patidar.The opening ceremony holds special significance as Kolkata hosts it for the first time since 2015. The event will feature performances by Shreya Ghoshal, Karan Aujla, and Disha Patani, showcasing West Bengal's art and culture. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is expected to attend.If the match is washed out, both teams will receive one point each. Even a shortened game could be affected by the pitch conditions, potentially favouring bowlers over the strong batting lineups of both teams.Eden Gardens has transformed from a spin-friendly venue to a batting-friendly surface in recent IPL seasons. However, rain could alter the pitch conditions, making it more favourable for bowlers if the covers remain on for an extended period.","Kolkata's Regional Meteorological Centre has specifically predicted thunderstorms with lightning and strong gusty surface winds for match day.

Golden State Warriors receives a concerning update following Stephen Curry’s hard fall on the floor



starexited Thursday night’s game against theafter taking a tough fall late in the third quarter. The 37-year-old guard, who had been dealing with a sore back, landed hard after attempting a pass in the lane, colliding with Toronto’s Jonathan Mogbo and Colin Castleton. The Warriors later announced that he had sustained a pelvic contusion and would not return to the game.Golden State Warriors star player Stephen Curry ’s fall has left fans and the team concerned about his health. The incident occurred as Curry drove into the paint and attempted to kick out a pass to the opposite corner. As he failed to break his fall, Curry landed awkwardly on his lower back. The sound of his hard fall was audible as commentators aptly pointed out, “Here you can actually hear him hit the floor here.”Curry remained on the ground for a minute while play continued before a Toronto timeout allowed the Warriors’ medical team to check on him.Curry slowly got to his feet and walked to the sideline before heading to the locker room with Warriors’ vice president of player health and performance, Rick Celebrini.The Athletic's Anthony Slater shared, ""Concern for the Warriors: Steph Curry just went to the locker room grabbing at his tailbone after a hard fall. Here he is discussing it with Drew Yoder and Rick Celebrini and then walking to locker room gingerly with Celebrini.""The Warriors went on to claim a 117-114 win over the Toronto Raptors. Later, it was revealed that he was taken for MRI. “He thought he might be able to come back,” Kerr said. “We just decided not to risk anything. Hopefully it’s not bad.”Curry's teammate Draymond Green also commented on his hard fall, “He hit that ground hard, you could hear it. It’s crazy. Obviously a scary moment for us, for him. Hopefully he’s good.”The Warriors veteran had already been managing a lower back strain from last Thursday’s win over the Sacramento Kings. Although he was in discomfort, he continued playing through it before sitting out Tuesday’s game against Milwaukee. Before his exit against Toronto, Curry had been battling tight individual defense but still managed 17 points in 25 minutes, shooting an efficient 6-of-8 from the field and 2-of-4 from three-point range.Beyond his brief rest against the Bucks, Curry has been remarkably durable this season, playing in 59 of the Warriors’ 69 games. Now, his injury concern could be a massive blow for the Warriors’ playoff campaign.“The last three games I think he’s been tired, but it’s more of a mental and emotional fatigue than physical. He’s fine physically. When he’s emotionally tired, it affects his decision-making. He’s a little bit out of sorts,” head coach Steve Kerr recently said of Curry. “We’ve got lots of experience with Steph. We know him well. He just needs a night off once in a while. He’s for sure earned it,” he added.Also Read: Stephen Curry's exhaustion catches up as Golden State Warriors crumble against shorthanded Nuggets: ""We gotta get him some rest"" Of course, Curry has led the team to win on multiple occasions and his dominance on the court adds fuel to their lineup. However, so far, the Warriors did not specify his potential absence from the upcoming games.","Golden State Warriors star player Stephen Curry ’s fall has left fans and the team concerned about his health.

Lewis Hamilton makes history with first Ferrari triumph in intense Chinese Grand Prix sprint battle



Lewis Hamilton marked a new chapter in his illustrious career by clinching his first victory for Ferrari in the sprint race at the Chinese Grand Prix on Saturday. The seven-time world champion delivered a dominant performance, leading from start to finish and fending off fierce competition from Red Bull’s Max Verstappen and McLaren’s Oscar Piastri. This victory not only gave Hamilton his first taste of success in Ferrari colors but also marked the Italian team’s maiden sprint race win since the format was introduced in 2021.Lewis Hamilton’s stunning pace was evident right from the qualifying session on Friday when he secured a remarkable pole position. His performance on Saturday only made his return to winning ways, as he expertly managed his tires and held off challenges from his rivals. Verstappen, despite his usual aggressive approach, found himself struggling with tire wear, which allowed Piastri to execute a late overtake on the reigning world champion. However, the young McLaren driver was unable to mount a serious challenge against Hamilton, who comfortably crossed the finish line in first place.Lando Norris, who started from sixth on the grid, endured a frustrating race as he went wide early on, losing valuable positions. The British driver, a strong contender in the championship, struggled with tire degradation and spent much of the race battling Lance Stroll’s Aston Martin. After an intense fight, Norris eventually managed to overtake Stroll but could only finish eighth, picking up a solitary point.Also Read: Lewis Hamilton claims F1 sprint pole position at the Chinese Grand Prix Hamilton’s triumph not only adds to his legendary career but also boosts Ferrari’s momentum as they look to challenge Red Bull’s dominance in the 2024 season.

ROYAL CHALLENGERS BENGALURU

KOLKATA KNIGHT RIDERS

The defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders host Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the opening match of the 2025 Indian Premier League season on Saturday at the Eden Gardens .Here's a look at how the two teams shape up for the opening face-off:Strengths: Like most teams in IPL , a formidable batting lineup. Virat Kohli , Phil Salt and newly-appointed skipper Rajat Patidar form the top order. Liam Livingstone, Tim David, Krunal Pandya and Romario Shepherd add further dynamism. With the acquisitions of Josh Hazlewood, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Rasikh Salam, RCB’s bowling unit has gained muchneeded reliability, particularly in death overs.Weaknesses: Lack of a wicket-taking spinner. Krunal Pandya, at best, is a run-stopping option, while Suyash Sharma is yet to prove his credentials on the big stage. Patidar’s appointment as captain introduces leadership potential but also poses challenges due to his limited experience in such a role. The ongoing pursuit of their first IPL title adds pressure, which could impact team performance.X-Factor: Virat Kohli. Has the hunger to win an IPL title for RCB, and this time in several years has the squad that can go the distance.Strengths: Have successfully retained a strong core of players, including Varun Chakravarthy, Rinku Singh, Venkatesh Iyer, Andre Russell and Sunil Narine, who have been pivotal in their previous successes. Narine and Chakravarthy gives KKR one of the most formidable spin bowling units in the league. With the likes of Russell, Rinku, Iyer and Rovman Powell, KKR possesses exceptional batting firepower in the death overs.Weaknesses: The middle-order, featuring Ajinkya Rahane and others, lacks explosiveness. With Rahane stepping in as captain, there may be uncertainties regarding leadership dynamics.X-Factor: Varun Chakravarthy. The ‘mystery spinner’ has been in top-notch form and will be a major weapon for KKR.",Defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders host Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the opening match of the 2025 Indian Premier League season on Saturday.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

After a massive career with the UFC, Anthony Smith has announced his retirement from fighting. The 36-year-old light-heavyweight fighter confirmed his retirement after his last fight scheduled for April 26, 2025, during UFC Kansas City. This fight will see Smith face Zhang Mingyang in what is expected to be a very emotional farewell.Smiths' career at UFC hit the highs and the lowest of his life after losing to Jones in their fight at UFC 235 in 2019 concerning the light heavyweight title. Smith has never been associated with the extreme breakage and long streak of losses similar to B.J. Penn and Tony Ferguson, but there is no denying that Smith was not the same dominant force that he used to be after losing to Jones in 2019. Nonetheless, Smith continued to fight, earning recognition as a fighter with resilience and determination.In a candid interview with MMA Fighting, Smith admitted he may have stayed in the sport longer than he should have. “I probably stuck around too long already, if we’re being honest,” he said with a laugh. Reflecting on his career, Smith shared that balancing fighting with family life became increasingly challenging. “It comes down to being a dad and a husband. I’m super involved, but it’d be nice to slow things down,” he explained.Smith also opened up about the toll of training camps, which often kept him away from his loved ones. The recent passing of a close friend, Scotty, made the decision to retire easier. “Once Scotty died, it made it really easy. This thing is different for me now. Retiring feels like leaving something that doesn’t feel normal anymore,” he said.As Smith prepares for his final fight, fans are left wondering if he’ll go out with a win. Regardless of the outcome, his legacy as a fierce competitor and a dedicated family man will remain intact.Also Read: Unstoppable?

George Foreman passes away at the age of 76



George Foreman , the two-time heavyweight champion and Olympic gold medalist who became an enduring sports icon, has passed away at the age of 76, his family confirmed. Foreman’s sudden demise left a huge void in professional boxing but his legacy stretches far beyond his achievements in the ring. His journey from youth to world champion, ordained minister, and entrepreneur remains one of the greatest second acts in sports history.In a statement released on Instagram on Friday night, George Foreman’s family confirmed his passing. ""Our hearts are broken,” the statement read.""A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father, and a proud grand and great grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility, and purpose. A humanitarian, an Olympian, and two time heavyweight champion of the world, He was deeply respected - a force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name - for his family,"" the statement continued.""We are grateful for the outpouring of love and prayers, and kindly ask for privacy as we honor the extraordinary life of a man we were blessed to call our own.""Born on January 10, 1949, in Marshall, Texas, Foreman grew up in Houston under difficult circumstances. Dropping out of school and engaging in street crime, he found salvation through the Job Corps program, which introduced him to boxing. Just a few years later, at the age of 19, he won a gold medal at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, signaling the arrival of a formidable new force in heavyweight boxing.Foreman quickly established himself as one of the most feared punchers in the sport. He won his first 37 fights, culminating in a devastating victory over the undefeated Joe Frazier in 1973. Foreman knocked Frazier down six times in the first two rounds to claim his first world heavyweight championship.In the legendary ""Rumble in the Jungle"" against Muhammad Ali, Foreman made his name known further. Although he had the edge as a younger and stronger fighter, Foreman fell victim to Ali’s brilliant “rope-a-dope” strategy. He was knocked out in the eighth round.Foreman retired in 1977 and dedicated himself to his Christian faith. He became an ordained minister and founded the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ in Houston. However, his financial struggles ultimately brought him back to boxing.In 1987, at the age of 38 and weighing over 300 pounds, Foreman returned to the ring and right after 24 straight wins. Later, Foreman became the oldest heavyweight champion in history, proving that determination knows no age limit.Also Read: Puja Tomar eyes historic win at UFC London to boost Indian MMA presence Following his final fight in 1997, Foreman became a respected HBO boxing analyst and an incredibly successful entrepreneur.

EXCLUSIVE | Shreyas Iyer and Yuzvendra Chahal key to Punjab Kings' hunt for maiden IPL title: Shashank Singh

NEW DELHI: It is that time of the year. Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 is set to kick off -- but with a host of rule changes, many of which have already drawn attention.While most of the recent updates make sense to an extent, both current and former players are keen to see how the changes pan out over the next two months.Among the headline-grabbing rules are: the return of saliva to shine the ball and the introduction of a second ball for the second innings in evening matches.With these new regulations in place, certain questions have started creeping into the equation: What was the need for these new norms? How could these benefit the players -- bowlers in this case? And are these rules a game-changer or gimmick?""If you look at it, saliva is used less on a new ball; sweat is used more because the new white ball is lighter,"" Parvinder Awana, who played three IPL seasons for Kings XI Punjab, toldOver the past few seasons, 200-plus scores have become routine in the IPL, thanks to flat wickets and flamboyant bravado of the batters. The Impact Player rule made a significant difference last season.Bowlers, particularly pacers, have struggled to get much purchase off the surface with the white ball.The lifting of the saliva ban might just tilt the balance slightly in their favour.""When the ball gets a bit older, one side needs to be made slightly heavier for reverse swing. That’s when saliva is applied, and it helps the ball shine better,"" the 38-year-old explained.""The red ball shines more because its leather is softer. The white ball is harder, and its shine wears off quickly. It swings early on, but as it ages, the swing reduces.""However, for saliva to be effective, the playing surface needs to be conducive to reverse swing. That means some wear and tear on the pitch -- and on one side of the ball.""If the pitch and ground conditions are a bit rough, and if some saliva is applied to shine one side while keeping the other side rough, the ball will reverse swing,"" Awana elaborated.While it remains to be seen how much of a difference saliva can make, the introduction of a second ball in the second innings of evening games is expected to bring noticeable relief for bowlers.By giving bowlers a worn-down ball after the 11th over of the second innings, the second ball rule aims to counter the dew factor -- a perennial issue in night matches.This move is expected to restore some balance between bat and ball, and reduce the toss advantage often gained by the chasing side.""In evening matches, there's usually dew. So if a second new ball is used, it would help bowlers with grip. And a new ball could also swing,"" Awana pointed out.READ ALSO: Don't think Virat Kohli necessarily turned down RCB's captaincy: AB de Villiers However, the implementation of this change is not automatic.The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has left the decision on ball replacement to the discretion of the on-field umpires.While acknowledging the potential impact of this move, Awana is cautiously optimistic and keen to observe how it plays out in real-timeHe concluded, ""As a fast bowler myself, it’s a good thing for bowlers; it’s something new. Let’s see how it plays out when the season starts.""","IPL 2025 is set to kick off with a host of rule changes, many of which have already drawn attention.

SQUAD:

NEW DELHI: The pressure will undoubtedly be on Shubman Gill to guide Gujarat Titans back into the playoffs—and ultimately, to their second IPL title. Expectations are high, thanks to the franchise's impressive past performances.Making their IPL debut in 2022, Gujarat Titans, under Hardik Pandya’s captaincy, scripted history by winning the title in their very first season. They continued their dominance in 2023, reaching the final once again, only to fall short in a thrilling clash against Chennai Super Kings.However, 2024 was a different story. With Pandya’s move to Mumbai Indians, the captaincy baton was passed to Shubman Gill, but the transition did not go as planned. Gujarat Titans endured a disappointing campaign, managing just 5 wins in 14 matches and finishing eighth, crashing out in the league stage.Now, with a revamped squad, Shubman and his team will be determined to turn things around in IPL 2025 .Ahead of the IPL 2025 Auction, Gujarat Titans retained their core, including Rashid Khan , Shubman Gill, B Sai Sudharsan, Rahul Tewatia, and Shahrukh Khan. They included England's batting star Jos Buttler (Rs 15.75 crore), Mohammed Siraj (Rs 12.25 crore), and Kagiso Rabada (Rs 10.75 crore) as their marquee signings in the IPL 2025 mega Auction.With a fresh squad and renewed ambitions, will Gujarat Titans erase the 2024 disappointments and reclaim the IPL trophy?Gujarat Titans will enter IPL 2025 with a formidable batting lineup. With a mix of proven batters and explosive all-rounders, the Shubman Gill-led side is expected to pile on the runs this season.At the top, Sai Sudharsan, Jos Buttler, Anuj Rawat, and Shubman Gill provide stability and firepower, ensuring solid starts for the team.The middle order is packed with big-hitters like Glenn Phillips, Shahrukh Khan, Rahul Tewatia, Mahipal Lomror, Sherfane Rutherford, Rashid Khan, and Washington Sundar, giving GT multiple match-winning options.Gujarat Titans also boast a well-rounded bowling unit, with both spin and pace arsenals covered.With depth in both batting and bowling, Gujarat Titans look well-equipped to make a strong statement in IPL 2025.Shubman Gill (C), Jos Buttler (wk), Sai Sudharsan, Glenn Phillips, Rahul Tewatia, Washington Sundar, Rashid Khan, Mohammed Siraj, Sai Kishore, Kagiso Rabada, Prasidh KrishnaShubman Gill (C), Jos Buttler, Sai Sudharsan, Shahrukh Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Nishant Sindhu, Mahipal Lomror, Kumar Kushagra, Anuj Rawat, Manav Suthar, Washington Sundar, Gerald Coetzee, Arshad Khan, Gurnoor Brar, Sherfane Rutherford, Sai Kishore, Ishant Sharma, Jayant Yadav, Glenn Phillips, Karim Janat, Kulwant Khejroliya.","Gujarat Titans made their IPL debut in 2022, winning the title in their very first season.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians , one of the most successful franchises in Indian Premier League (IPL) history, are set to make a strong comeback in the 2025 season after a forgettable campaign last year, where they finished at the bottom of the table under new captain Hardik Pandya. As five-time champions, the franchise will be determined to reclaim their glory with a revamped squad featuring a blend of experienced campaigners and exciting new additions.The franchise has retained its core lineup, including skipper Hardik Pandya, batting maestro Rohit Sharma, India's T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav, rising star Tilak Varma and pace sensation Jasprit Bumrah. These core players have been instrumental in Mumbai Indians' success over the years and will continue to be the backbone of the team. With the addition of new signings and renewed motivation, MI will aim to secure a record sixth IPL title.One of the most significant signings for the 2025 season is New Zealand's premier fast bowler Trent Boult. Known for his deadly swing and pace, Boult will bolster the pace attack alongside Deepak Chahar and English seamer Reece Topley. Boult's experience with Mumbai Indians in the past will be crucial in guiding the younger bowlers, and his ability to swing the new ball both ways will add a new dimension to the bowling lineup. These additions will complement Bumrah's fiery spells, forming a formidable pace battery that can trouble any batting lineup in the league.On the batting front, the acquisition of South African wicketkeeper-batter Ryan Rickelton brings fresh firepower at the top of the order. Known for his aggressive stroke play and consistency, Rickelton will be pivotal in providing quick starts. Alongside him, former captain Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav will continue to be the bedrock of Mumbai's batting unit. Rohit’s experience and Surya’s dynamic stroke play make them a formidable combination at the top, while young Tilak Varma adds depth to the middle order.In the all-rounder department, captain Pandya will once again be the key player, balancing the team with his explosive batting and impactful bowling. The versatile Will Jacks, who can bat anywhere in the order and bowl handy off-spin, will be a valuable asset. Adding to the flexibility is the inclusion of experienced Mitchell Santner, who not only adds depth to the batting lineup but also strengthens the spin department with his left-arm orthodox bowling. Afghan spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman, known for his mystery spin, and veteran leg-spinner Karn Sharma complete the spin attack.Rohit Sharma, Ryan Rickelton (wk), Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav, Will Jacks, Hardik Pandya (capt), Deepak Chahar, Mitchell Santner, Karn Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah, Trent BoultWith renewed vigour and a refreshed lineup, Mumbai Indians are geared up to put last year’s disappointment behind them and aim for a historic sixth IPL title.
