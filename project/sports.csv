Taylor Swift won't perform at the Super Bowl until Travis Kelce retires

Taylor Swift is considering performing a halftime show for the NFL after her boyfriend Travis Kelce retires, according to a report by the Daily Mail.

Despite fans' desire for Swift to take center stage, she remains committed to supporting Kelce on the sidelines.Taylor Swift, who has been dating Kelce for two years, attended the Super Bowl and watched Kendrick Lamar's halftime performance, but is hesitant to accept the role while Kelce remains an active player.“She doesn’t want to do it now until Travis is fully retired as she would like to be at the game supporting him rather than performing at it,” the Daily Mail’s source said. “When she eventually performs at it, she wants all her loved ones to be able to experience it. And as long as Travis is in the league, the Chiefs have a chance to be in the game, so she is going to wait to do it till he is officially done.”Travis Kelce's NFL future remains uncertain after the Chiefs' Super Bowl LIX loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. Rumors about his retirement arose, and he said he would take time to decide on his New Heights podcast with his brother Jason Kelce.“I’m gonna take some time to figure it out,” Kelce said. “And I think I owe it to my teammates that if I do come back that it’s gonna be a wholehearted decision and I’m not half-assing it, and I’m fully here for them. I think I can play, it’s just whether or not I’m motivated or it’s the best decision for me as a man, as a human, as a person to take on all that responsibility.”Also Read: Travis Kelce is rumored to propose to Taylor Swift during their next upcoming romantic vacation Travis Kelce, a key player for the Kansas City offense, has seen a career-low 823 yards and three touchdowns this season.

have seemingly bounced back as they have secured a stunning win against theon Thursday night. At 40 years old, on the second night of a back-to-back, the four-time NBA champion, LeBron James delivered a jaw-dropping 40-point performance to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a 121-112 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. His efforts left Lakers head coachboth stunned and inspired, as he showered James with praise following the game. LeBron James has recently dealt with lingering injuries and only confirmed fit to play hours before tipoff but showed no signs of slowing down. He shot an efficient 14-for-24 from the field, including 4-of-8 from beyond the arc, and added eight rebounds and four assists.Head coach JJ Redick , who has always been a vocal admirer of James’ work ethic and longevity, couldn’t hold back his admiration for the legend. Speaking to reporters in a post-game presser, he shared his honest thoughts on the King’s astonishing performance.“He really just defies anything that's normal, and not just the physical feats and the plays—it’s the mentality,” Redick said. “He is—I believe I saw the other day he's a billionaire—and he's playing on the second night of a back-to-back at 40 after 22 years with every record and every accolade.”Redick continued his witty remark, “And the kids will say that I'm glazing him. He's one of the greatest competitors. [Assistant coach] Nate [McMillan] and I were talking before the game—he's amazing to coach. He brings it every single day, he sets the standard for how you're supposed to approach this craft. That’s to me the most incredible thing—the mindset to do it, get up the next day, do it, over and over again.”James’ ability to maintain this level of excellence post-40 has been undeniably top of the word, according to fan analysts. For two decades, he has maintained his stature as a standout star and forged his legacy with a stunning resume to his name.Additionally, James has just added another milestone in his career.

NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan are set to clash in a high-stakes ICC Champions Trophy encounter on Sunday, with both teams chasing different objectives. India, buoyed by their six-wicket win over Bangladesh, look to secure a semifinal berth, while Pakistan, reeling from a 60-run defeat to New Zealand, must win to remain in contention for the last-four spots.The two arch-rivals last met in a Champions Trophy match in 2017, when Pakistan triumphed in the summit clash. The tournament is making a comeback after eight years since the 2017 edition.Although diplomatic tensions have eased, muting the usual fervor, anticipation remains high for this Group A showdown at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.India hold a clear advantage, having acclimatised to the conditions, while Pakistan arrive in Dubai straight after their loss to New Zealand in Karachi. With form and familiarity on their side, India head into Sunday’s clash with a psychological edge.The Champions Trophy clash between India and Pakistan at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on February 23 is expected to proceed without any rain interruption, despite rainfall occurring in Dubai days before India's tournament opener.The forecast indicates partly cloudy conditions during afternoon hours, with temperatures ranging between 22 degrees Celsius at its lowest and reaching up to 32 degrees Celsius at its peak.31 DegreesMostly sunny and warm20 km/h5%32 DegreesMostly sunny and warm30 km/h23%26 DegreesPartly cloudy and warm24 km/h100%The playing surface at the Dubai International Stadium provides opportunities for both batting and bowling, with conditions that can fluctuate. During day/night contests, as the surface becomes drier, spin bowlers often find increased effectiveness. The initial phase favours pace bowling, with the potential for movement in the air and bounce off the surface. Whilst scoring opportunities exist, as evidenced by typical first innings totals, the venue does not consistently yield substantial scores.Spin bowling proves particularly crucial during the middle phase, as the surface tends to assist turn. Pace bowlers find value with the new ball, extracting movement and lift.

NEW DELHI: As the much-awaited India-Pakistan showdown in the ICC Champions Trophy approaches, former Indian cricketer Yuvraj Singh has backed Indian captain Rohit Sharma , calling him a ""dangerous"" player even when not in peak form.The arch-rivals will face off in Dubai on Sunday in a match that holds historical significance, with Pakistan leading 3-2 against India in Champions Trophy encounters.Speaking on JioHotstar’s 'Greatest Rivalry Returns', Yuvraj emphasised Rohit's ability to change the course of a game, irrespective of his form.“In ODIs and white-ball formats, he has been India’s biggest match-winner alongside Virat Kohli . If he is struggling but still gets runs, that is dangerous for the opposition. If he is in form, he will score a century in 60 balls. That is his quality — once he gets going, it’s not just about fours, but also clearing the ropes with sixes,” Yuvraj said.He also praised Rohit’s dominance against pace, particularly short-pitched bowling, which is often a concern for batters. “Even if someone bowls at 145-150 kmph, Rohit has the ability to hook it effortlessly. His strike rate is always between 120-140, and on his day, he can single-handedly win you the game,” he added.Rohit has a stellar record against Pakistan, scoring 873 runs in 19 ODIs at an average of 51.35, with two centuries and eight fifties. His highest score of 140 came in the 2019 World Cup.Pakistan, coming off a disappointing tournament opener against New Zealand, will be eager to repeat their 2017 Champions Trophy final triumph over India.However, with Rohit leading the charge, India, who beat Bangladesh in their opening game, will look to level the head-to-head record in the prestigious tournament.","Former Indian cricketer Yuvraj Singh has backed Indian captain Rohit Sharma.

After a defeat in the tournament opener, Pakistan's hopes of progressing in the Champions Trophy hinge heavily on their next group match against traditional rivals India in Dubai on Sunday, which former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali views as heavily loaded in favour of India.New Zealand outclassed defending champions and hosts Pakistan by 60 runs in the first match of the tournament at Karachi, while India beat Bangladesh by six wickets in Dubai.Talking about Pakistan's chances and their must-win situation, Basit said it will be a big upset if Pakistan get the better of India.""It is a 'final' for Pakistan,"" the former batter said on his YouTube channel. ""India are heavy favourites. If Pakistan win, it will be an upset in my view because Pakistan's cricket has gone down, hit a low.""Agar one-sided hota hai, toh ab TV bhi nahi tootenge kyuki Pakistan mei mehangai boht zyada hai. Ab zabaan se hi har cheez hogi (if Pakistan lose one-sided, now fans wont' break TV sets because of the country's economic situation; now there will be only voiced opinions).""The hosts suffered a blow after the defeat against the Kiwis, losing their attacking batter Fakhar Zaman to injury, which led to Imam-ul-Haq coming in as replacement""Who will bat at No. 3, nobody knows. They might ask Usman Khan to open with Imam and bring Babar (Azam) at No. 3. Something needs to be done,"" Basit added, talking about the team's dire state.Babar has been opening since the ODI tri-series at home ahead of the Champions Trophy and was criticised for his laborious 64 off 90 balls in the first match of the Champions Trophy despite a target of 321 to chase.""Fakhar Zaman is out. Now Pakistan's batting line-up from number one to five is similar and there is no scope to swap positions. It's true. If their car is running in third gear, then it will stay in third gear. It won't be able to switch to turbo, maybe in the last 5 or 10 overs, maybe,"" said Basit.India, meanwhile, put up an all-round show against Bangladesh to start their campaign on a rousing note, with Mohammed Shami shining with a five-wicket spell (5 for 53) and opener Shubman Gill scoring an unbeaten century (101*).Basit said India will continue to play normal cricket and take it like just another match, while the mentality in Pakistan is still to beat India at any cost.""Baaton ki cricket ab nahi hone chahiye, ab bat se, dimag se (Pakistan now need to make their bats talk, use their brain),"" he said.Captain Rohit Sharma, who scored a century during the ODI series at home against England to return to form, looked good in his 36-ball 41 against Bangladesh, while Virat Kohli had to struggle for his 22, which came off 38 balls.""Virat intezar karta hai Pakistan ke match ka (Virat waits for the match against Pakistan),"" said Basit, predicting that the batting legend may play a big knock in the pressure match.He concluded by criticising the Pakistan Cricket Board for the money it spent in refurbishing the three stadiums in Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi.He said the board should instead have applied its mind in building a team.""The amount of money they spent in building the stadiums, they could have built a good team in half that amount. But to build a team you need intelligence. What is your vision? What's your thinking? How do you view a player's talent and longevity? These things matter.""As things stand at the moment in Group A, New Zealand are on top with two points, with India at No.2 because the Kiwis have a better net run-rate (NRR) of +1.200 compared to India's +0.408.Bangladesh are ahead of bottom-placed Pakistan. Both the teams are without any points, while Bangladesh's NRR of -0.408 is better than Pakistan's -1.200.",Basit Ali says it will be a big upset if Pakistan get the better of India.

NEW DELHI: When former cricketer Atul Wassan announced that he wants Pakistan to defeat India in Sunday's Champions Trophy match in Dubai, it caught everyone off guard.Pakistan will take on fierce opponents India in the duel of the heavyweights in an attempt to maintain their championship defense. After losing to New Zealand by 60 runs in the opening match of the competition, Pakistan ended up in this situation.The Men in Green would require a lot of different combinations to work in their favor and sustain their campaign if they lose against India on Sunday. Wassan thinks that if Pakistan wins the crucial match, the competition will become much more thrilling.""I want Pakistan to win because it will be fun, tournament-wise. If you don't let Pakistan win, then what will you do? If Pakistan wins, then it becomes a contest. There should be an equal fight,"" Wassan told ANI.Wassan praised India's batting depth in the starting line-up while analyzing their team for the current Champions Trophy. He believed that India was the greatest squad and supported their plan to launch a spin-heavy attack in Dubai given the circumstances.""You have a lot of good batters: Shubman (Gill), Rohit (Sharma), Virat (Kohli). You are batting until number eight in Axar Patel. Rohit has picked five spinners, and this team is best for Dubai. Have faith in what you have and move ahead,"" he added.India glided to a facile six-wicket victory against Bangladesh to open their account, while Pakistan started the campaign on a losing note.However, Wassan voiced his displeasure at Rishabh Pant 's exclusion from India's starting XI in favor of KL Rahul . Wassan believes that Pant makes the opposition uneasy, something Rahul cannot do.Head coach Gautam Gambhir 's preference for Rahul over Pant did not impress Wassan. He claims that the ""mercurial"" player has been let down by the Indian management, which could have long-term consequences for him.""Gautam Gambhir is picking his own team. I am just very upset that Rishabh Pant is not playing. I don't know why. He's a mercurial player who makes the other team nervous. They feel that he will single-handedly win the match. KL Rahul is a very good player but does not attract such fear from the opposition. You let Rishabh Pant down. If you let a good player enter this situation that he won't play, the hero in him becomes zero,"" Wassan said.","Former cricketer Atul Wassan wants Pakistan to defeat India in Sunday's Champions Trophy match in Dubai.

Latif said that the criticism was justified and that Babar ought to have taken chances while he was at the crease.""I think Babar Azam is being rightly criticised. If the ball is not coming onto the bat then you should have a Plan B. If you keep racking up the dot balls then you add pressure onto the team. Babar should have taken more risks, I believe the opening ten overs were there to take risks, as they struggle to play freely against spin. People think Pakistan have been unpredictable but Babar's batting has become predictable,"" Latif told IANS.The former wicketkeeper-batter went on to say that Babar is no longer Pakistan's best chance, citing Virat Kohli as an example who gained international acclaim for his clutch scoring for India.""Bowlers always know what shot he will play against which ball. Babar used to be Pakistan's hope at one time but not anymore as there are other players who can do (better). If on a day when Virat Kohli does not perform then Shubman Gill will perform, if he does not then Rohit is there, you've got Shreyas Iyer Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul as well but Virat is a big game player, he played a crucial innings in the T20 World Cup final (2024) as well,"" he added.Latif stated that the Mohammad Rizwan-led team appears weaker against Rohit Sharma & Co. ahead of Sunday's crucial match between India and Pakistan in Dubai.""If we look at both teams then Pakistan's side looks weak. Even though India's record has been stronger against Pakistan but there used to be competition, the game used to go till the final overs. People think India's tournaments have usually been due to their batting but Pakistan's success has always been due to their bowling,"" he said.""This match is very important for Pakistan. I am not worried for just the Champions Trophy but for Pakistan cricket as well because a lot of things were said and written in the build-up to the tournament (regarding India's participation) but all of that was off the field now the cricket has started and Pakistan lost their opening game whereas India won theirs. In a tournament like CT, where every team is a top side, the margins of errors are less there. Pakistan had lost their opening game in 2017 as well.""Despite pace-spearhead Jasprit Bumrah 's absence, the seasoned hitter termed India's bowling arsenal better than Pakistan.""I believe India's bowling is currently better, I know Jasprit Bumrah is not here, but their spinners are dominating, and in conditions like Dubai, Pakistan will struggle to face their spin attack,"" Latif said.",Former Pakistan batter Rashid Latif says Babar Azam should have taken more risks. Latif believes that Babar is no longer Pakistan's best chance against India.

This match is being played in Dubai after India declined to travel to Pakistan, the tournament's host nation.Pakistan will be under pressure in front of an anticipated full house at the 25,000-seat Dubai International Stadium, with hundreds of millions more people riveted to their TVs.Realistically, Mohammad Rizwan 's team needs to defeat favorites India in order to go to the semi-finals of the eight-nation event after losing badly to New Zealand by 60 runs in the first match of the ODI competition in Karachi.On a higher run-rate, New Zealand leads Group A ahead of India, who defeated Bangladesh by six wickets on Thursday. Pakistan sits at the bottom of the group, in fourth place.The semi-finals will be played by the top two teams in each of the two groups.""If we want to win against the great teams of the world and be one of the great teams of the world we will have to bring consistency,"" Pakistan batsman Salman Ali Agha said.""We can't play well in one game and bad in another.""Last week in a tri-nation event at home, Pakistan lost to New Zealand in the final, crashing to 242 all out after chasing down a record 353 against South Africa.Their top batsman, Fakhar Zaman , sustained a muscular injury on Wednesday, which dealt them a serious blow in the defeat.

Champions Trophy EXCLUSIVE: India, Pakistan prepare for blockbuster in Dubai

Champions Trophy: Shubman Gill identifies where India-Pakistan could be won or lost

Expressing surprise over the downfall of Pakistan cricket , former India off-spinner said that there is no comparison between the current Pakistan team and the ones that played till 2011-12.The archrivals are set to renew their rivalry in Dubai on Sunday when they meet in a group-stage fixture of the ICC Champions Trophy In the build-up to the big game, Harbhajan featured as a guest on a Pakistan news channel, alongside Pakistan legends Mohammad Yousuf and Shahid Afridi Harbhajan said the lack of unity in the current Pakistan squad is disappointing.""Haven't seen such a Pakistan team in years,"" he said. ""When we used to play Pakistan, there was always a feeling that the opposition could beat you because they had star players, power-packed performers, bowling was very good and the unity showed. This (current) team may have players who can win a game on their own, but that unity isn't evident.""They have individuals who can win a game on their day. But a team should have 7-8 such players who can win you the championship. I don't see that in this team. That's my opinion.""Pakistan defeated India in the final of the last Champions Trophy in 2017 with a commanding 180-run victory. But since that defeat, India haven't lost to Pakistan.In six matches played since the 2017 Champions Trophy final at The Oval, India have won five, while one ended as a no-result.""No doubt you won in 2017 when Fakhar Zaman played that big innings. But somewhere, I think, there is a lot of difference now from the days when India and Pakistan used to be nicely balanced teams. Now India is ahead of Pakistan,"" Harbhajan added.Concurring with Harbhajan, Afridi said now Pakistan lack match-winners who can take them all the way to winning titles.""Bhajji is right. We can't compare this team with the one from the '90s. They are now short of match-winners. Like Bhajji said, you can win a match but to lift the trophy you need (consistent) match-winners. Mindset against the top team is the most important thing,"" said the former Pakistan captain.The two teams started their Champions Trophy campaign in contrasting fashion. Pakistan lost the tournament opener to New Zealand by 60 runs, while India defeated Bangladesh by six wickets.As a result, Pakistan are in a virtual must-win situation with just a match against Bangladesh left to play after this in Group A.The eight-team competition will see top two teams from each of the two groups qualifying for the semifinals.","Former India off-spinner Harbhajan says current Pakistan team lacks unity.

Casey DeSmith stops 31 shots leading the Stars to win over the Devils

Casey DeSmith made 31 saves, and the Dallas Stars secured a 4-2 win over the New Jersey Devils at Prudential Center. He holds the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins record for most saves in a playoff game. DeSmith was named to the AHL 's 2016–17 All-Rookie Team and was a co-recipient of the 2017 Harry ""Hap"" Holmes Memorial Award.The Dallas Stars defeated the New Jersey Devils 4-2, with Evgenii Dadonov and Thomas Harley scoring first-period goals and Casey DeSmith making 31 saves. Matt Duchene and Wyatt Johnston also scored for Dallas in their first game after the 4 Nations Face-Off tournament break. Jack Hughes scored twice for New Jersey.Dadonov scored the first goal, and Harley scored his 10th goal of the season on a power play, leading all Stars defensemen with 30 points. Hages ended DeSmith's shutout bid with a power-play goal, and Duchene restored the Stars' two-goal margin with his 23rd of the season.Dallas won the game against New Jersey, earning points in eight of their past 11 games (7-3-1) and winning five consecutive at Prudential Center since 2022. DeSmith saved a quick snap shot by Hamilton, while Johnston scored a short-handed empty-net goal for the final score.Undrafted and regarded as undersized for a goaltender, he signed with the Wheeling Nailers, the ECHL affiliate of the Pittsburgh Penguins, in 2015 after his college career at the University of New Hampshire was halted due to legal problems. After performing well both in Wheeling and while being loaned to the American Hockey League's Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins later that season, he earned a promotion by signing an AHL contract in the summer of 2016.Also read: Florida Panthers forward Matthew Tkachuk is out of Saturday's game against Seattle Kraken due to a lower-body injury DeSmith, who had a league-best statistical performance in the 2016-17 AHL season, signed a contract with Pittsburgh in July 2017.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Champions Trophy: Shubman Gill identifies where India-Pakistan could be won or lost

DUBAI: Eight months after India pipped Pakistan in a thrilling, low-scoring group match of the T20 World Cup on a difficult pitch in New York, cricket's most storied but, of late more of over-hyped rivalry will present its latest installment when a red-hot India, eyeing a semifinal berth, play Pakistan, struggling for survival in their first ICC tournament as hosts in 29 years, on Sunday night at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium in game five of the 2025 Champions Trophy.Boosted by premier pacer Mohammed Shami 's five-wicket haul and a brilliant century (101 not out) by classy opener Shubman Gill-enjoying a purple patch in ODIs- India vanquished Bangladesh by six wickets in their lung-opener on Thursday.With Shami roaring back into form, the young Harshit Rana having impressed so far, and India's three-pronged spin attack, which conceded just 123 runs in 29 overs looking effective on this slow pitch which didn't seem to be too conducive for stroke-making, India's attack looks fairly decent and good enough for the job even without the talismanic Jasprit Bumrah . Left-arm spinner Axar Patil was unlucky to have missed out on the first hat-trick in the Champions Trophy since 2006, and while Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav went wicketless, they were economical.However, India's biggest USP at the moment seems to be Gill, currently the No 1 rated batsman in the ODIs. The Indian vice-captain has shrugged off his struggles in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy on the fast and bouncy pitches in Australia and looked in prime form.While Gill is yet to prove his mettle in Test cricket-his average after 32 Tests is a mere 35.05, in the ODIs, his numbers, as Indian captain Rohit Sharma said before the Bangladesh game, are ""crazy""-2688 runs in 51 matches@62.51, with eight hundreds and 15 fifties. Gill's scores in his last four ODIs are -87, 60, 112 & 101*. At the moment, Gill, whether he is dancing down the track to hit he bowlers inside out or flick and pulling them through the square leg, is finding the sweet spot of the bat and only seeing the gaps on the field. The two sixes that he smashed to mid-wicket off Tanzim Hasan Sakib on Thursday night will remain etched in the memory for long.India will also be encouraged by the way 'keeper-bat KL Rahul chipped in with a useful 41 not out to help Gill finish off the chase against Bangladesh.On Saturday, India's superstar bat Virat Kohli , in a bid to sort out his issues against spin, arrived three hours before the scheduled practice time at the ICC Cricket Academy, along with assistant coach Abhishek Nayar. He practiced against the top 20 bowlers of UAE-left-arm spinners and leg-spinners.With Indian captain Rohit Sharma showing glimpses of his vintage form in his 36-ball 41, India's sole worry will be the scratchy form of Kohli, who, after scoring 22 in the last match, succumbed to a leg-spinner for the third time in a row when he cut a Rishad Hossain delivery to backward point-twice in the ODI series against England at home, he succumbed to Rashid Khan.Perhaps, playing against Pakistan, against whom he enjoys a tremendous record-678 runs in 16 ODIs @52.15, with three hundreds and a highest score of 183 at Dhaka in 2012, will bring the best out of the former India captain. Pakistan leggie Abrar Ahmed, and even left-armer Khushdil Shah and off-spinner Salman Agha will fancy their chances against the ageing superstar.Meanwhile, Pakistan, who trained under lights at the ICC Academy here after arriving on Friday for this big-ticket clash, are already staring at the embarrassment of an early exit from the tournament after going down to an efficient New Zealand by 60 runs losing their opening match, outplayed as they were in all the departments at the National Stadium in Karachi. Perennial slow starters, their woes have been worsened after explosive opener Fakhar Zaman was ruled out of the event on Wednesday.Fakhar's enforced ouster has deprived the team of its second first-choice opener following the untimely injury to Saim Ayub in Australia. Eight years ago, at The Oval on June 17, it was Fakhar who played a stellar role in Pakistan's sensational 180-run victory over India in the final of the 2017 Champions Trophy in England.The man to have replaced Fakhar is another left-handed opener in Imam-ul-Haq, but unlike Fakhar, he isn't someone who can destroy a bowling attack. Another worry for Pakistan the strike rate these days of former captain Babar Azam, who took 90 balls to score 64 against the Kiwis the other day.Apart from current form, history too is stacked heavily against Pakistan, and in favour of India here. At ICC events, spanning both the white-ball formats, India own a 17-4 record against their arch-rivals, which means that they enter Sunday's contest as the overwhelming favourites. In the past two weeks, Pakistan have lost three ODIs to New Zealand at home. However, Mohammad Rizwan & Co can draw confidence from the fact that three out of Pakistan's four victories over India at ICC tournaments have come at the Champions Trophy, including the final in 2017. At the moment, though, the defending champions face the prospect of being eliminated from the tournament.With their backs to the wall, facing an in-form India in a must-win league game, Pakistan are drawing inspiration from two favourable results they have had against India at the DICS in recent times. They had beaten India here in October 2021 and September 2022, albeit in T20Is.""We have beaten India twice here in Dubai. We will aim to make it three and repeat those performances. We are confident, and it will be a great match,"" Pakistan pacer Harris Rauf said on Friday evening.Underlining the magnitude of the big game against India and the need to forget about the Kiwi defeat, Rauf said ""What's past is past. We are now focusing on the India game. We will address the mistakes we made in the previous game and try not to repeat them. For us, it's an important fixture; a do-or-die game. We need to win this to stand a chance of qualifying for the semifinals.""Rauf, who conceded 83-2 in 10 overs against New Zealand claimed that the morale of his side ahead of the must-win game was still upbeat. ""The morale is not down; all the boys will try hard and give their best. It is an important fixture, and we will aim to perform well in all departments - batting, bowling, and fielding. There is no extra pressure; we are relaxed. We will treat it as just another match,"" he said.While the form book favours India, Pakistan can be unpredictable and mercurial. It's pertinent to remember that Pakistan are at their most dangerous when they have their backs to the wall.The 'hosts' will once again bank on their pacers Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah, Rauf and Mohammad Hasnain- who can be terrific or erratic on a given day.",India take on Pakistan in Champions Trophy game five in Dubai. India beat Bangladesh by six wickets in their opening match on Thursday. Pakistan are struggling for survival in their first ICC tournament as hosts in 29 years. Fakhar Zaman was ruled out of the event following an early exit from the tournament.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118494022,imgsize-57940,width-400,resizemode-4/118494022.jpg"

Champions Trophy EXCLUSIVE: India, Pakistan prepare for blockbuster in Dubai

""We are different countries. We have different jerseys. But the game only knows the basics. You reap the rewards of hard work. It's the environment within the stadium that elevates your performance, and that's exactly the case when we play against Pakistan, more than any other team,"" says India great Virat Kohli - in a video released by the official broadcasters - while talking about the game against Pakistan on February 23 in Dubai.Political correctness isn't Kohli's forte. He doesn't hide behind 'it's-just-another-game' platitudes. He loves the hype and the big-game pressure whenever India play Pakistan. His numbers against Pakistan prove it: 16 ODIs, 678 runs, avg 52.15, strike-rate 100.29.Intensity? 10,000 units. Examples? Mirpur (2012), Adelaide (2015), Colombo (2023), Birmingham (2017). Clutch checklist? 23-10-22, T20 World Cup, Melbourne. Making the impossible possible? Over 18.5. THAT shot against Haris Rauf. T20 WC performance vs Pak? 6 matches, 312 runs, avg 156, strike-rate 132.Don't watch the stroke for its remarkable execution. Don't track the trajectory of the ball after its appointment with the middle of Kohli's willow. Zoom into the batter's eyes. Hear his heart pound.But before every act of heroism, there is misplaced early bravado. Pakistan were Kohli's first opponents in ICC events at Centurion in the 2009 Champions Trophy. And his inside-out shot against Shahid Afridi , which landed in the juggling palms of Umar Gul at long off, still haunts him since it derailed India's chase. He vowed to become a 'chasemaster' after that, ticking that bucket list innumerable times.However, two of India's three defeats to Pakistan in the Champions Trophy have come in Kohli's era. The last one was in 2017, a humiliating 180-run mauling in the final at the Oval when Kohli was captain. India were favourites but imploded against a freakish Fakhar Zaman, who scored a century, and an inspired opening burst with the ball from Mohammed Amir.Conspiracy theorists also attributed the loss to a revolt against the coach. It was also under Kohli's leadership that Pakistan broke their winless streak in World Cups against India, winning by 10 wickets in Dubai in the 2021 T20 World Cup.Kohli would want to set some records straight here. He also has some self-doubt to slay after his troubles in red-ball cricket and all the trolling he has endured.Clouds of apprehension have also circled around skipper Rohit Sharma's head. With his famed hand-eye coordination showing signs of slackening, the ability to judge length early has also vaporized. It has resulted in his form in Tests showing an alarming dip, triggering tame dismissals at home and in Australia.The red flag is up for him, especially in the longest format. But his form in white-ball cricket has been excellent. Ever since he adopted and communicated the need to embrace a high-risk, high-reward strategy in the Powerplay, Rohit has helped in giving the team a massive launchpad to go big while batting first. In pursuit of targets, he has managed to break the back of big chases and make the equation easier for the rest of the batters.Rohit has a fabulous record against Pakistan. In 19 matches, he has scored 873 runs, averaging 51.35 with two tons and eight half-centuries.The last time the two teams met in 50-overs cricket, in Dubai, he was leading in the 2018 Asia Cup and stroked an unbeaten 111. His 140 in Manchester on a gloomy Sunday in the 2019 World Cup was a masterclass in taking the game on. The slashed six off Hasan Ali over deep point evoked comparisons with the great Sachin Tendulkar 's storied upper cut off Shoaib Akhtar in Centurion in 2003.Rohit also belted a 63-ball 86 that demoralized the men-in-green in 2023 in Ahmedabad, putting on a tutorial in how to pull high-pace deliveries into the galleries.But he has fallen victim to left arm pace and the ball swinging in from over the wicket. Shaheen Shah Afridi got him LBW with a deadly yorker in the 2021 T20 World Cup. Mohammed Amir did the same in the 2016 Asia Cup in Mirpur and the 2017 Champions Trophy final at the Oval.The Cuttack hundred against England has enabled Rohit to keep the doubters away for a while. Another attacking and authoritative knock against Mohammed Rizwan and Co. could help him increase that distance.'RoKo' as a hashtag is popular but superficial and an attempt to hyphenate the careers and achievements of the two Indian batting superstars. A combined effort from the two veterans, though, may not just help India win another global trophy, but it may also enable toxic fans of Rohit and Kohli to co-exist respectfully and make the social media space more palatable.","India face Pakistan in the Champions Trophy final in Dubai on February 23. Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have stellar records against Pakistan. Kohli has scored 678 runs in 16 ODIs and has a strike-rate of 100.29.

Champions Trophy EXCLUSIVE: India, Pakistan prepare for blockbuster in Dubai

Sunday's game will be a grudge match for India. The wounds of the 2017 Champions Trophy final against Pakistan are still fresh. For India, a team that has dominated its arch-rivals in ICC tournaments across formats, the Champions Trophy has often been a banana peel. It's the only ICC tournament where Pakistan have got the better of India.Two of the three defeats came in England - in 2004 and 2017 - while the other defeat came in South Africa in 2009. The conditions offered substantial help to seamers and Pakistan showed why they were better than India on that front.Circumstances are a lot different going into Sunday's match. India have largely dominated Pakistan at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. Their only two defeats against Pakistan here have come in the T20 format. Revisiting the ODI face-offs at the venue, India didn't break a sweat in the two matches against Pakistan in the 2018 Asia Cup Going by early indications of the Dubai pitch, where India played Bangladesh and won, there won't be any exaggerated seam movement. India are loaded with competent spinners, while Pakistan have one 'mystery' spinner in Abrar Ahmed.As for Pakistan's pacers, their reputation of being a nursery for fast bowlers seems to have hit a roadblock after the exit of Mohammed Amir, the man responsible for triggering India's top-order collapses at Centurion and the Oval in 2009 and 2017.Shaheen Shah Afridi isn't the force he was while Naseem Shah is a work in progress. One of Afridi's best spells, however, came against India in the 2021 T20 World Cup in Dubai.Pakistan's batting too doesn't inspire much confidence at the moment. They seem to be playing an outdated brand of cricket. They don't have the depth or reputation to consistently dominate a world-class attack. However, India will still be wary of Pakistan's unpredictable nature.A lot has changed since 2017. For India, captain Rohit Sharma Virat Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja are in the last leg of their ODI careers. Hardik Pandya has grown in stature, but an unsettled middle order is still cause for concern in case of an early collapse.Going by form and conditions, Pakistan are the clear underdogs going into the match. India just need to mind their step.","India have dominated Pakistan at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. Their only two defeats against Pakistan here have come in the T20 format.

NEW DELHI: India's newly crowned world No.1 ODI batter, Shubman Gill , lived up to his billing with a magnificent century, steering India to a six-wicket victory over Bangladesh in their ICC Champions Trophy 2025 opener. His composed knock, his second consecutive ODI ton, reinforced his dominance in white-ball cricket and drew high praise from former Australian captain Ricky Ponting Speaking on The ICC Review, Ponting hailed the 25-year-old's rise to the top of the rankings, calling it a reflection of his class and consistency.""He thoroughly deserves to be the number one ranked batter in the world at the moment,"" Ponting said. ""It's a great sign for India that he's got his account underway early in the first game of a Champions Trophy.""While Gill has yet to make a significant mark in Test cricket, Ponting stressed that ODIs and T20s are perfectly suited to his style.""He's been a very, very good international player for a number of years,"" Ponting noted. ""He hasn't sort of transferred that over into Test Match cricket yet, but his white-ball cricket over the last three or four years has been outstanding. Look, he's a big-game player as well. He's played really well in IPLs over the last couple of years, obviously being captain of his franchise there.""Ponting particularly praised Gill's ability to score freely in ODIs, especially against fast bowling.""He can come out and be nice and aggressive early in the power play with the field up, get some boundaries away early by playing good, naturally aggressive cricketing shots,"" Ponting explained. ""He's not a big hitter, he doesn't try to do anything outside of his natural game, but he scores boundaries almost at will against fast bowling.""Beyond his batting prowess, Ponting also sees leadership potential in Gill.""He just seems like a really nice character, very driven for what he wants to achieve in the game,"" Ponting said. ""We've had a chance to catch up over the last couple of years, particularly around the IPL season. I just like his demeanor. He seems like a very driven guy that wants to be the best he possibly can with batting and also in leadership.""Gill's eighth ODI century, helping India chase down 229 against Bangladesh on a tricky pitch in Dubai, further solidified his reputation as India's premier white-ball batter.","Ricky Ponting hails India's world No.1 ODI batter, Shubman Gill.

Once upon a time, cobbling up your own combined India-Pakistan XIs over long afternoons used to be standard practice for cricket fans. That was the era of fierce cross-border rivalries, when the two teams regularly played each other in bilateral contests in addition to the desert derbies in Sharjah.Things have changed now. India and Pakistan are not allowed to play against one another often enough, but memories of those great ODIs through the 1980s and 90s - and into the first decade of the 2000s - still linger.Here is TOI's take on a fantasy ODI XI, from four decades of ODIs, comprising players from both teams. This XI is not just about players with the best numbers, but those who had the maximum impact in India-Pak ODIs. Apologies are in order to some greats who missed out.The obvious selection. His average of 40.09 in 69 head-to-head games is lower than many, but some of Tendulkar's most unforgettable ODI innings came against Pakistan. Tendulkar can walk into this XI only on the basis of the 98 he struck against a top-class Pakistan attack in the 2003 World Cup game in Centurion.Our pick will raise eyebrows, because it comes at the expense of another classy Indian opener, Rohit Sharma . But Anwar's average of 43.52 over 50 matches shows the kind of impact he had in ODIs against India. Anwar's flair and ability to take apart attacks made him one of the best openers of his generation. The 194 in Chennai in the 1997 Independence Cup against India is still the highest individual score in this epic rivalry.The modern master has played only 16 games against Pakistan, but it is impossible not to make him the No. 3. Kohli is arguably the greatest ODI batter of his generation, with the highest number of centuries in the format. His 183 in Dhaka in the Asia Cup match against Pakistan, on March 18, 2012, was ironically the last time Tendulkar featured in an ODI against Pakistan.The big man dominated India-Pak contests for more than a decade. An average of 43.69 and four centuries over 67 games underlines the effect he had on this rivalry. Ask any Indian captain of that generation and they would say that 'Inzy' was the best finisher of the game, not Michael Bevan. And who can forget the burly Inzamam's iconic attack, with bat raised, on an Indian fan in Toronto in 1997 for being taunted with 'Aloo' chants? This gentle giant sure had entertainment value!The 'street fighter' changed the course of this rivalry with his last-ball six off Chetan Sharma in the Australasia Cup final in Sharjah in 1986. Before that, for a few years, India had dominated the rivalry, but that one innings led to a complete change of momentum for almost a decade and a half. An average of 51.08 in 35 head-to-heads speaks volumes about the kind of impact Miandad had. For a generation of Indian cricket fans, his presence at the crease induced fear and awe.The greatest leader that sub-continental cricket has seen in the last 50 years. His 6-14 in Sharjah is still remembered as one of the finest spells in ODI cricket. It was under Imran that Pakistan became an unbeatable force towards the end of the 1980s, culminating in Imran leading Pakistan to their only ODI World Cup win in 1992.There simply hasn't been a better wicketkeeper-batter in India-Pak ODIs. Dhoni first made his mark in ODIs with a blistering 148 off 123 balls against Pakistan in Vizag, a performance that kept his career alive after a string of failures. He followed that up with a superb away series in Pakistan in 2006, which made president Pervez Musharraf his fan.The star allrounder was the heart and soul of the Indian attack when India were dominating this contest in the 1980s. It is impossible to forget his superb spell in the Benson and Hedges Final at MCG in 1985 that set up one of India's greatest moments in ODI cricket. Also, when India started losing ground later in the decade, Kapil never lost his verve and kept taking the attack to Pakistan, both with bat and the ball.The finest white-ball pacer of all time. Akram is the highest wicket-taker in this contest. In 48 games, the left-arm artist took 60 wickets at average of 25.15. Add to that some late-order cameos with the bat that used to change the course of the desert derbies in the late 1980s and 1990s. Till Akram was in business, India were never the favourites going into this contest. Things changed in India's favour only when after Akram retired in 2003.This is a rivalry that hasn't exactly been dominated by spinners, primarily because batters from these two countries, till a few years ago, used to be magnificent players of spin. Still, against the best in the business, Kumble held his own with 54 wickets from 34 games, including a 4-12 in the Sahara Cup in Toronto in 1996. That the likes of Miandad, Mohammed Younus and Inzamam never really took Kumble apart shows his greatness.The king of the doosra. With 57 wickets from 37 games, Saqlain was an enigma that the great Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly all struggled against. The beauty of Saqlain was that he could be as effective in the death overs as well, bamboozling batters looking for the big shots with his beautifully disguised other one, or doosra, which became one of the most difficult balls to face in that eraA batsman that Indian bowlers feared like no other in the late 1980s. His unbeaten 72 off 36 balls in the first ODI ever played at Eden Gardens, in 1987, still gives Indian fans from the era nightmares.A pacer with an uncanny ability to make a mark in India-Pak matches. Took a hat-trick in the tri-series final in Sharjah in 1991, where he finished with 7-37 -still the best figures in India-Pak ODIs. He probably would have made it, just that Kapil, Imran and Akram cannot be dropped.Walks into any ODI team, just that Anwar had a bigger impact for a longer period of time in this rivalry.The best pace bowler of the current generation doesn't have a big enough sample size when it comes to performances in India-Pak games.Older Pakistan fans won't recall his name with a lot of fondness. His 45 off 25 balls in the 1996 ODI World Cup quarterfinal is one of the most iconic cameos ever played in the history of the tournament.","Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, Ajay Jadeja, Imran Khan and Saqlain Mushtaq make the XI. India-Pakistan ODI rivalry dates back to the 1980s and 90s. India and Pakistan are not allowed to play against one another often enough.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118466981,imgsize-135510,width-400,resizemode-4/118466981.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In-form Shubman Gill etched his name into the record books with a composed, unbeaten 101 as India began their ICC Champions Trophy campaign with a six-wicket victory over Bangladesh on Thursday. Gill’s knock anchored India’s chase of a tricky 229-run target on a challenging surface, with the team reaching the finish line with 21 balls to spare.The 25-year-old vice-captain continued his sublime form, securing his eighth ODI hundred in just 51 innings — making him the fastest Indian to reach the milestone. He surpassed the previous record held by Shikhar Dhawan , who took 57 innings, while Virat Kohli (68 innings), Gautam Gambhir (98 innings), and Sachin Tendulkar (111 innings) followed in the list.""Definitely one of my most satisfying innings that I have played and my first century in ICC events,"" Gill said after receiving the Man of the Match award. ""Very happy with the way I performed.""India's captain Rohit Sharma lauded Gill's efforts, emphasising the young opener's consistency and class. ""Gill, we know the class that he has, shouldn't surprise anyone. It was good to see him bat till the end,"" Rohit remarked.Gill's remarkable ODI career has continued to flourish since his debut in 2019. In 51 matches, he has amassed 2,688 runs at an astounding average of 62.51, striking at 100.78. Alongside his eight centuries, he has registered 15 half-centuries, further cementing his reputation as one of India's most promising batters.Interestingly, Gill's century against Bangladesh was his slowest in ODIs, taking 125 balls to reach the three-figure mark. However, his measured innings proved vital in navigating India to victory on a testing pitch.Also See: India vs Pakistan Head to Head Records Having recently won the Player of the Series award in India's 3-0 sweep against England, where he scored 259 runs, Gill's red-hot form bodes well for India as they continue their pursuit of Champions Trophy glory.","Shubman Gill scores unbeaten 101 as India beat Bangladesh by six wickets.

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Sourav Ganguly believes KL Rahul 's ""fantastic numbers"" in ODIs may have given him the edge over Rishabh Pant as India's first-choice wicketkeeper-batter in the ongoing Champions Trophy.Head coach Gautam Gambhir backed Rahul to take on the wicketkeeping duties for the marquee ICC event, leaving Pant on the sidelines.""India are such a strong side, especially in batting. Pant is very good. But Rahul has fantastic numbers in ODIs. So, I think that's the reason Gautam Gambhir has backed Rahul,"" Ganguly said after he was announced as the brand ambassador of Vura, a construction chemical brand.""There's very little to choose between them (Rahul and Pant) because both are exceptional,"" he added.The former BCCI chief also backed Virat Kohli to overcome his leg-spin woes, while tipping India as favourites to bag the Champions Trophy title.""India have five Shubman Gills from one, two, three, four, five, six -- who can all score hundreds and win matches. When Axar Patel bats at five for India, can you imagine the depth?""Yesterday, India was in a spot of bother, but then they had KL Rahul coming in. They had Ravindra Jadeja, Hardik Pandya... There's batting after batting.""India have a house of talent because of the systems we have and the way we play our cricket.""Kohli once again fell to a leg-spinner but Ganguly was confident that the star batter will overcome this challenge.""The quality of cricketer Virat Kohli is ---I'm sure he will be able to sort this out. He has got 81 international hundreds, and I'm sure he scored runs against leg-spin also. So, it was probably just one of those days when he got out. He has to find a way to play it.""While India and New Zealand are Ganguly's picks from Group A, he said Australia could miss out on the semifinals due to the absence of key players.""New Zealand have beaten Pakistan. So, New Zealand is ahead. If India beat Pakistan, then Pakistan will probably be out of the competition. So, I see India and New Zealand progressing from this group.""""From the other group, I'm a little worried about Australia because there's no (Pat) Cummins, no Mitchell Starc, and no Josh Hazlewood. Their three best fast bowlers are missing.""Between South Africa, England, and Australia -- any two can qualify. You never count Australia out because of their pedigree and the quality of cricket they play. But I won't be surprised if England and South Africa make it.""The 52-year-old, who has a career best 239 in Tests against Pakistan, also remembered his on-field fights against the neighbours.""I've played an entire lifetime of India-Pakistan cricket, starting from the Independence Cup final in 1996. My first series as captain toPakistan in 2004, where India won the Tests and ODIs for the first time in history. So, I have lots of great memories of playing against Pakistan.""I've seen Javed Miandad's six sixes, and I've also seen the transformation of India after that -- how we started dominating Pakistan in every format.""I say that with respect. India have been a far, far superior team. Looking at this Indian team, it's also far, far superior in the last 20 years,"" he said.","Sourav Ganguly believes KL Rahul has the edge over Rishabh Pant as India's first-choice wicketkeeper-batter in the ongoing Champions Trophy.
