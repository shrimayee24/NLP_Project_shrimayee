Sarod player forced to flee Bangladesh hiding Indian identity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sarod-player-forced-to-flee-bangladesh-hiding-indian-identity/articleshow/126111929.cms,".

KOLKATA: A Kolkata-based sarod player with family roots in Bangladesh and an illustrious legacy in the world of music had to flee the neighbouring country when the venue was vandalised hours before his programme, leaving him shocked and his tabla player still stuck there.Shiraz Ali Khan had a concert scheduled at Chhayanaut in Dhaka on Dec 19. But hours before the scheduled programme, the culture hub was vandalised amid a nationwide spiral of unrest triggered by the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a radical leader who played a key role in last year's anti-Hasina protests.Shiraz managed to ""flee"" to Kolkata on Saturday evening, suppressing his Indian identity on the way. His tabla player is still stuck there and hoping to return on Monday.Shiraz's father is Ustad Dhyanesh Khan, son of Ustad Ali Akbar Khan and grandson of Baba Allauddin Khan. Although based in Kolkata, Shiraz's family has roots across the border. His great-grandfather, Ustad Allauddin Khan, was from Brahmanbaria. ""Some years ago, a college in Ustad Allauddin Khan's name (in Brahmanbaria) was attacked. But the attack on Chhayanaut is an unimaginable assault on our culture and shared values,"" Shiraz said.Shiraz arrived in Dhaka on Dec 16, in time for a jazz concert on Dec 17 in Banani. His major classical music recital was scheduled for Dec 19. ""Despite the small gathering of 17-18 people, the experience (in Banani) was heartfelt. I didn't expect that days later, tragedy would hit our musical community. On the morning of Dec 19, I learned about the attack on Chhayanaut. I couldn't believe the building where I was to perform was destroyed. Seeing the disturbing images was beyond belief, especially as someone who holds music and its sacredness in the highest regard,"" Shiraz told TOI.While trying to leave Dhaka, Shiraz was stopped at a checkpoint. ""I was asked if I had foreign currency. Fortunately, I didn't. For the first time, I didn't mention my Indian identity. Aware of anti-India sentiments, I spoke in the Brahmanbaria dialect. My mother, from Brahmanbaria, settled in India after her marriage in 1968. I learned the dialect from her,"" he said.Shiraz's Khan surname helped. ""People thought I was from Bangladesh, not India. I never thought I'd have to hide my Indian identity. I gave my Indian passport and phone to the driver, who kept them in the car's dashboard. I got them back at the airport. I don't know what would have happened if I hadn't concealed my identity. My mother is still in Bangladesh. My Hindu accompanists are also stranded in Dhaka. I won't reveal their names for their safety,"" he said, adding he ""won't return"" to ""Bangladesh until artists, music, and cultural institutions are respected and protected"".","Shiraz Ali Khan had a concert scheduled at Chhayanaut in Dhaka on Dec 19.

India T20Is vs New Zealand:

India T20 World Cup:

Chief selector Ajit Agarkar on Saturday announced India’s squads for the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup and the five-match T20I series against New Zealand. The T20I series will begin on January 21 in Nagpur and will serve as India’s final assignment in the format before the global tournament, scheduled from February 7 to March 8.India have been drawn in Group A for the T20 World Cup, alongside Namibia, the Netherlands, Pakistan, and the United States. The hosts will open their campaign against the USA on February 7 in Mumbai.Despite a lean run with the bat in the recently concluded T20I series against South Africa, which India won 3–1, Suryakumar Yadav has been entrusted with the captaincy for the marquee event. In 20 matches and 18 innings this year, Suryakumar has scored 213 runs at an average of 14.20, striking at just over 125, without registering a single half-century.Suryakumar Yadav (c), Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson (wk), Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah, Rinku Singh, Harshit Rana, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Washington Sundar, Ishan KishanSuryakumar Yadav (c), Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson (wk), Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah, Rinku Singh, Harshit Rana, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Washington Sundar, Ishan KishanIndia’s T20 World Cup squad sees some major changes. Notably, Shubman Gill , who was India’s vice-captain in the T20 setup, has been dropped, with all-rounder Axar Patel named as the new vice-captain.Gill had struggled to find form since opening the innings. Brought back into the playing XI as part of the management’s long-term leadership plan, his performances remained underwhelming. In 15 T20 matches since his comeback, Gill has scored 291 runs at an average of 24.25 and a strike rate of 137, failing to register a single fifty.Meanwhile, Sanju Samson, who had performed exceptionally well, including scoring three centuries as an opener, was moved down the order. His Asia Cup performance was mixed, though he finished as India’s third-highest run-scorer with 132 runs, behind Abhishek Sharma (314) and Tilak Varma (213). A solitary outing in Australia at No. 3 yielded little impact, after which Samson was dropped from the playing XI.In the last T20 against South Africa, Samson opened the innings again and scored a solid 37 off 22 balls, giving India a good start. The team management now plans to return to their original composition of playing a wicketkeeper at the top. Consequently, Jitesh Sharma has been dropped, and Ishan Kishan has been drafted as the second keeper.Ishan Kishan and Rinku Singh make the T20 World Cup squad, while Shubman Gill and Jitesh Sharma miss out. Kishan comes off a stellar domestic season in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, where he captained Jharkhand to their maiden T20 title. He finished the season as the highest run-scorer, amassing 517 runs in 10 games at an average of 57.44 and a strike rate of 197.","Ishan Kishan and Rinku Singh make the T20 World Cup squad, while Shubman Gill and Jitesh Sharma miss out.

Why the Mumbai Maidans are being ignored? | Bombay Sport Exchange

NEW DELHI: India all-rounder Hardik Pandya produced a blistering display of power-hitting to lead India to a commanding 30-run victory over South Africa in the fifth and final T20I in Ahmedabad on Friday, sealing the five-match series 3-1. Pandya’s explosive knock set the tone as India piled up a daunting 231 for 5.Pandya smashed a 16-ball half-century — the second-fastest by an Indian in T20 internationals — on his way to a stunning 63 off just 25 deliveries. His innings was laced with five boundaries and five towering sixes.The carnage was complemented by Tilak Varma, who continued his rich vein of form with a fluent 73. Together, the duo stitched a punishing 105-run partnership for the fourth wicket that completely wrested momentum away from the visitors.One of Pandya’s massive sixes led to an unexpected moment off the field when the ball struck a cameraman stationed near the boundary.Showing concern beyond the contest, Pandya immediately walked up to check on the cameraman’s well-being after his innings, ensuring he was attended to and even helping apply an ice pack.Pandya also hugged the cameraman, a gesture that quickly went viral and earned widespread praise from fans.In reply, South Africa began positively and remained in the chase as long as Quinton de Kock was at the crease. The left-hander scored a fighting 65, but once he was dismissed, the innings unravelled rapidly. Varun Chakravarthy spun a web around the middle order, claiming four wickets as South Africa lost seven wickets for 81 runs to finish on 201 for 8.Pandya’s all-round impact and match-defining innings earned him the Player of the Match award.""Winning games is what you play for and it’s always exciting when your contribution helps the team get over the line. No, I actually didn’t know (he has the second fastest fifty for India) until I got out and went back. Our social media guys told me I was the second-fastest,"" Pandya said.Watch the video here ""My first reaction was, “Ah, I missed the top spot!” But happy that Yuvi pa holds that record. Today I just felt it. I actually told my partner beforehand that I was going to step out first ball and try to hit it for six. I was confident it would come off,"" he said.""The situation suited my style; I backed myself and it worked. I took a calculated risk and thankfully it went my way. I’ve always enjoyed the challenge. No matter how many setbacks you face, the aim is to come back stronger, better, and make a bigger impact. When it all comes together, it feels satisfying. But the journey continues - the preparation, the planning, the hard work never stops,"" Pandya said.",India beat South Africa by 30 runs in the fifth and final T20I in Ahmedabad.

Mahayuti sweeps Phase 1 of Maharashtra local body polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mahayuti-sweeps-phase-1-of-maharashtra-local-body-polls/articleshow/126109839.cms,"Image: IANS

PUNE/NAGPUR: BJP-led Mahayuti delivered a sweeping verdict after two rounds of the first phase of Maharashtra's civic elections, winning presidents' posts in nearly 207 of 288 municipal councils and nagar panchayats, mirroring its assembly election performance just over a year ago. Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) was reduced to 44 posts.Results were declared on Sunday after polling on Dec 2 and 20.BJP emerged as biggest gainer with victories in over 117 local bodies, cementing the position of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis . Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena secured 53 posts, while Ajit Pawar's NCP won 37.""We have won 117 presidents' posts, and more than 75% posts are with our Mahayuti partners. This is a repeat of the assembly election,"" Fadnavis said.CM Devendra Fadnavis said, “Compared to 2017, our elected representatives have doubled… This is the biggest win in local elections in the last 25 years for any party.”Final results of the 6,859 councillor seats were not released by the state election commission till the time of going to press. But BJP claimed to have won over 3,000 of these seats.Despite emerging as a distant challenger statewide, Congress checked BJP advances in parts of Vidarbha.Western Maharashtra saw Mahayuti allies battling each other as Congress and NCP (SP) struggled to hold ground. Meanwhile, BJP made gains in Mumbai and Konkan, encroaching into traditional Shiv Sena, PWP and NCP pockets. Shinde expanded Sena’s footprint beyond Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), finishing second across the state.North Maharashtra backed BJP strongly, especially in Jalgaon under minister Girish Mahajan. In Marathwada, expected gains from leaders such as Ashok Chavan and Munde cousins failed to materialise. Congress won just 28 civic bodies statewide. Sharad Pawar-led NCP managed seven, while Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena secured nine.Vidarbha delivered a fractured verdict. Congress halted BJP in several councils from Chandrapur to Buldhana and Ballarpur to Wardha, while BJP retained dominance in Nagpur, Gadchiroli and parts of Bhandara.Ajit Pawar-led NCP won 35 of 41 seats in Baramati region, the same undivided NCP had won in 2017. NCP (SP), led by Sharad Pawar, managed to win only one seat, while BSP and Rashtriya Samaj Paksha (RSP) also won a seat each. Three seats went to Independent candidates while BJP failed to open its account.The outcome is seen as a curtain-raiser to municipal corporation polls due Jan 15 and comes amid anger over flood-hit kharif crops and opposition charges that funds were diverted to populist schemes such as Mukhyamantri Mazhi Ladki Bahin Yojana. Polls also marked first statewide civic exercise after Shiv Sena and NCP splits, consolidating Shinde and Ajit Pawar as undisputed leaders of their factions.Biggest beneficiary remains Fadnavis. After BJP’s poor 2024 Lok Sabha showing — nine of 48 seats — and his offer to resign, he led Mahayuti to an assembly landslide of over 230 seats, with BJP winning 132. Opposition allegations of “vote chori” and EVM manipulation resurfaced but lost traction after civic sweep.Analysts blamed MVA for failing to capitalise on farm distress. Former CM Prithviraj Chavan admitted Congress could not raise youth and farmer issues effectively.","Results were declared on Sunday after polling on Dec 2 and 20.

Congress — survival, not dominance

NEW DELHI: The ruling NDA led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had a lot to cheer in 2025 with decisive victories in Delhi and Bihar - the two states where assembly elections were held this year. For the opposition, 2025 was a year of disappointments. While the Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP was defeated in Delhi, the Mahagathbandhan of Congress, Lalu Prasad’s RJD and the Left was decimated in Bihar.But 2026 could be an opportunity for the opposition to bounce back as four states and one Union Territory – West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu , Assam and Puducherry — will vote to choose their new assemblies. Except Assam, which is ruled by the BJP, the opposition has a dominant presence in the other three states.With polls due between March and May 2026, parties have already begun calibrating strategies and sharpening their pitch to voters.In West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee ’s Trinamool Congress will be defending its fortress as it seeks to hold off a renewed BJP push, while the Congress and Left will make another effort to recover lost political ground.In Kerala, the CPM-led LDF is eyeing an unprecedented third consecutive term — a feat unheard of in the state’s traditional pendulum-like politics.Tamil Nadu is preparing for another round of the Dravidian duel, with the DMK and AIADMK once again anchoring the state’s political battlefield.In Assam, the BJP-led NDA under Himanta Biswa Sarma will fight to hold the state even as the Congress looks to stage a revival.Meanwhile, in Puducherry, N Rangasamy’s AINRC–BJP coalition faces the challenge of holding together a fragile alliance against a DMK seeking to widen its footprint and a weakened Congress attempting a comeback.A key undercurrent across these contests is the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, extended to several poll-bound states including West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. The 2026 elections will therefore unfold on updated voter lists — a factor that could change a lot of things.Buoyed by its sweeping win in the recent Bihar assembly elections, the BJP has made its ambitions clear: Bengal is the saffron party's next battleground.Ahead of the 2026 polls, the BJP is pushing hard to turn momentum into seats. Meanwhile, the TMC, which won 213 of the 294 assembly seats in 2021 with roughly 48% vote share, is back in full campaign mode, defending a fortress it has held for over a decade. With the Congress party struggling to regain its footing, the stage is set for a high-stakes political showdown.From a modest presence in 2016 with just 3 seats, the BJP surged to 77 seats and approximately 38% of the vote share in 2021. The 2026 elections will test whether this was a temporary surge or the beginning of a sustained challenge to the TMC's dominance in Bengal.With 213+ seats and 48% vote share in 2021, Mamata Banerjee enters 2026 as the incumbent with the widest lead. She has already begun mobilisation and outreach, but the real challenge is holding this high ceiling in the face of anti-incumbency and a more aggressive BJP than before.From being a dominant force pre-2011 to being almost wiped out in 2021, Congress is now battling for visibility. Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury’s removal and Subhankar Sarkar’s appointment hasn’t yet translated into a loud political message or campaign repositioning leaving Congress still searching for footing.With the future of the opposition's INDIA bloc uncertain and Mamata Banerjee repeatedly hinting that TMC will contest Bengal alone, Congress risks being caught between two compulsions: aligning nationally versus confronting TMC locally.""Bengal is ours, we will fight here alone,” the West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has already declared.Additionally, the 2026 elections will be conducted under a Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls. Changes in voter registrations, particularly in minority-heavy or urban constituencies, could significantly impact the margins in key swing seats.Tamil Nadu is gearing up not only for another showdown between Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), but also for a potentially game-changing third force.The entry of TVK under Vijay has made Tamil Nadu assembly elections in the state all the more interesting.The ruling DMK enters 2026 from a position of strength, having secured 133 seats on its own in the previous assembly election. However, the party faces a tougher political landscape this time, with the AIADMK–BJP alliance regrouped and better aligned than in 2021. Tamil Nadu chief minister Stalin has already announced that the party will contest the state polls as part of the INDIA bloc, calling it an ideological partnership built on shared goals.The real test, however, lies in whether DMK can overcome anti-incumbency pressures, defend its welfare and governance record, and manage voter expectations on issues like jobs, NEET exemption and power tariffs.The 2026 Tamil Nadu Assembly election is a high-stakes battle for the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), which is desperately looking for a comeback after two consecutive electoral defeats. The big question for 2026 is whether the renewed AIADMK–BJP partnership can translate into seats. In 2021, the AIADMK-led front won 75 seats, while the BJP remained a secondary force. However, together they remain the largest challenger bloc to the ruling DMK. Edappadi K. Palaniswami has already set the tone, vowing that the front will “shatter Stalin’s dream of winning 200 seats” and predicting that the alliance could cross 210.A key factor that complicates the opposition arithmetic is the entry of actor Vijay with his party, the Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK), whose decision to contest alone threatens to split the anti-DMK vote.The 2026 Tamil Nadu election is the crucial electoral debut for actor Vijay’s TVK, who has boldly declared the contest as a ""TVK versus DMK"" fight and positioned himself as the alternative to “Stalin uncle”. Vijay has massive youth following and has a potential surprise factor to disrupt the traditional bipolar contest. However, the tragic Karur stampede that claimed 41 lives during one of his pre-poll roadshows casts a significant negative shadow. The incident has been heavily leveraged by the opposition, forcing Vijay and the TVK to defend their competence and win public trust.In Assam, the BJP-led NDA under the leadership of chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. who has become one of the party’s most prominent regional faces, will fight to hold the state, aiming to secure an unprecedented third consecutive term.Despite the 75 seats won in 2021, anti-incumbency remains a major underlying challenge. Chief minister Sarma, however, has set an aggressive target, confidently claiming the NDA is capable of winning ""104 out of 126 seats"".The Congress, which won 50 seats in 2021, is desperate for a comeback, led by the newly appointed state chief, Gaurav Gogoi. The party is trying to leverage the ""10-year anti-incumbency"" against the BJP, with Gogoi stating, ""After 10 years of BJP's corrupt and authoritarian rule, the people of Assam want change.""This election is a personal test for Gogoi, who must prove he can translate his Lok Sabha victory into a wider assembly-level revival for the party.Badruddin Ajmal’s AIUDF won 16 seats in 2021, performing strongly in Muslim-majority pockets. A breakup with Congress or a solo contest could split the opposition vote — benefiting BJP in triangular fights.Kerala heads into 2026 with one of the rarest scenarios in its electoral history — a ruling front attempting to win a third consecutive term. The CPI(M)-led LDF broke the state’s alternating pattern in 2021, winning 99 of 140 seats while the Congress-led UDF slipped to 41, and the BJP once again failed to open its account.The LDF has never won three consecutive assemblies in Kerala’s democratic history. For the CPI(M), which leads the front, this election is critical as Kerala remains the only major state where the Left is currently in power on its own strength. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who will again lead the front, is campaigning on the theme of ""continuity for progress."" Senior CPI(M) leaders, like KN Balagopal, have publicly stated that ""continuity was vital to maintain the momentum"" of development and welfare policies. However, the LDF faces a significant anti-incumbency challenge, which the opposition is leveraging to counter the government’s claims of development.UDF dropped from 47 seats in 2016 to 41 in 2021, still holding a sizable vote share but struggling to convert it. 2026 is the coalition’s best opportunity to regain ground if anti-incumbency builds. A weak result could push UDF further into inertia, shrinking the Congress footprint in another southern state.BJP has contested aggressively for two cycles but holds zero MLA seats in Kerala. If it breaks that barrier in 2026 — even with 1–3 wins — it changes the dynamics of the House. If it fails again, Kerala remains one of the last major states outside BJP’s elected footprint.In Puducherry, N Rangasamy’s AINRC–BJP coalition faces the challenge of holding together a fragile alliance against a resurgent DMK seeking to widen its footprint and a weakened Congress attempting a comeback.The ruling NDA is led by the All India NR Congress (AINRC) and BJP. In 2021, the AINRC won 10 seats and the BJP won 6 seats. This coalition is under immense pressure due to internal discord and anti-incumbency. The internal rift was brought to the forefront by the resignation of a lone Dalit minister AK Sai J Saravanan Kumar, on the decision of the high command.The move triggered strong reactions and exposed deeper fault lines within the coalition and the local BJP unit.The DMK entered the 2021 Puducherry polls with limited ground presence but still emerged with 6 seats, overtaking the Congress to become the largest opposition party. For 2026, the main challenge for DMK would be to widen its footprint in the Union territory and convert influence into numbers.Like in many other states, the Congress is fighting for survival in Puducherry too. Once the ruling party here, it has slipped to the margins since the 2021 election. For Congress, 2026 is not about winning power; it is about preventing irrelevance. A tally of 5–6 seats keeps it alive; anything below that accelerates decline. The grand old party must survive before it can compete.The Election Commission’s SIR of electoral rolls has already raised the pitch in these states, with the BJP strongly backing the exercise while the opposition accusing the poll body of helping the saffron party gain an advantage over its political opponents. 2026 is clearly all set for interesting electoral contests.","The ruling NDA led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had a lot to cheer in 2025 with decisive victories in Delhi and Bihar. But 2026 could be an opportunity for the opposition to bounce back as four states and one Union Territory – West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Assam and Puducherry — will vote. Except Assam, which is ruled by the BJP, the opposition has a dominant presence in the other three states.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126105470,imgsize-1014539,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Three children help ego management

NEW DELHI: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday shared his views on live-in relationships while addressing a gathering in Kolkata.Speaking during the centenary celebrations of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Bhagwat said live-in relationships reflected an unwillingness to take responsibility. “You’re not ready to take responsibility. This isn’t right,” he told the audience.According to Bhagwat, those who do not wish to marry should choose a life of renunciation. “If you don’t want to get married, that’s fine. We can become sanyasis. But if you won’t even do that, and also won’t take responsibility, then how will things work?” he asked.Bhagwat also spoke about how many children a couple should have. ""The question of how many children a couple should have is a matter for the family, the bride and groom, and society. A formula cannot be given,"" he said.However, Bhagwat said he had discussed with doctors, psychologists, and demographers, who said that marrying early between 19 and 25 years of age, and having three children, was beneficial for health.""I've gained some knowledge by talking to doctors, etc and they say that if marriage takes place early, between 19-25 years of age, and there are three children, then the health of the parents and children remains good,"" Bhagwat said.He added that, according to psychologists, having three children also helps with ego management. ""Psychologists say that having three children helps people learn ego management,"" Bhagwat said.The RSS chief, however, also acknowledged that he was only sharing information he had received from others. “I am a preacher, unmarried. I don’t know anything about this matter,” Bhagwat said.","Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat said live-in relationships reflected an unwillingness to take responsibility.

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Saturday announced that it will contest the upcoming Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections alone, a decision confirmed by party leader Ramesh Chennithala while speaking to ANI news agency.“We are all ready for the BMC elections . I have come to attend the meeting… Congress has taken a decision to contest the elections alone,” Chennithala said.The announcement comes amid one of the most striking political developments in Mumbai ahead of the polls, the growing proximity between Sena UBT chief Uddhav Thackeray and his cousin, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena supremo Raj Thackeray .Once bitter rivals, the cousins now appear aligned in their belief that losing Mumbai would significantly weaken the broader Thackeray political legacy.For Uddhav Thackeray, winning control of the BMC may be the last major opportunity to reassert political relevance after the 2022 split in the Shiv Sena .

Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt says the 15-pound gain came from muscle, recovery, and long-term planning

Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt shares structured workouts, consistency advice, and public appearance at AmericaFest 2025

Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt is not playing into the optics game. She is controlling the message herself.Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt shared a candid breakdown of her 2025 fitness journey on social media this week, openly revealing that she gained about 15 pounds over the past year. The admission was not framed as a setback. It was framed as progress. Hunt said the change came from intentional training, metabolic reset, and a shift away from appearance-driven goals.Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt positioned the transformation as a long-term commitment to strength and sustainability. Her post focused on how her body performed, how her energy stabilized, and how patience replaced pressure.“My 2025 fitness goal was simple: become the strongest version of myself, inside and out,” she wrote.Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt made it clear that the year was not about restarting or chasing fast results. She said her approach changed once she prioritized training with intention and respecting recovery.“This year wasn’t about starting over. It was about getting smarter. Training with intention, thinking long-term, and learning that strength, balance, and longevity matter more than chasing quick results. I learned that recovery isn’t optional, it’s part of the work.”Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt later addressed the weight change directly and explained how it happened.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.“I reset my metabolism, fueled my body on purpose, and slowly recomposed, adding about 15 lbs of muscle since I began this journey.”She added that she stopped centering progress around appearance. Instead, she focused on how her body felt day to day, when to push, and when to pause. Hunt said the result was steadier energy and sharper focus as the year progressed.The post was paired with workout clips and set to music by The Weeknd, reinforcing the message without changing its tone. Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt closed the post by stating she ended the year stronger than she began it.Earlier in the week, Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt shared a separate post labeled “Training Tuesday,” showing an upper-body workout performed outdoors with dumbbells and a mat.“Upper body strength doesn’t have to be complicated. All you need is a set of dumbbells, a mat, and a commitment to show up,” she wrote.“Focus on controlled reps, strong posture, and breathing with intention,quality always beats quantity.”Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt also advised followers to keep workouts simple and repeatable, especially on busy days. She encouraged starting small rather than skipping sessions entirely.Later that week, Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt attended Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest in Phoenix. The event runs Dec. 18–21 at the Phoenix Convention Center and honors the legacy of Charlie Kirk, with programming led by his widow Erika Kirk. Hunt shared brief glimpses of the event on social media.While the Kansas City Chiefs continue to navigate an uneven close to the season under owner Clark Hunt, Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt ended 2025 on her own terms. She defined success by strength gained, habits built, and consistency maintained.“Finishing the year stronger than I started, and remembering that growth never really ends.”In other news, with injuries sidelining early picks, the spotlight shifts to rookie cornerback Nohl Williams as the Kansas City Chiefs face the Tennessee Titans. The third-round pick out of California has played in 14 games, handled a steady workload, and shown reliability as a tackler, even as his coverage remains a work in progress. With Trent McDuffie ruled out and Jaylen Watson nearing free agency, this matchup gives Williams a real chance to log heavy snaps and prove he can handle a bigger role when the stakes are low but the evaluation is very real.","Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt shared a candid breakdown of her 2025 fitness journey on social media.

Everything to know about Brittani, the woman keeping the Steelers QB grounded

For two decades, Aaron Rodgers has lived under a microscope where every throw, feud, and relationship was pulled into public view. Fame followed him everywhere, often blurring the line between his professional brilliance and personal choices. Yet this offseason delivered a surprise no one saw coming. The Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback quietly arrived at training camp wearing a wedding ring, setting off whispers and questions that even seasoned reporters did not anticipate.Rodgers confirmed the news himself. He was married. Not in a splashy ceremony or magazine reveal, but in the most Rodgers way possible, calm and guarded. The identity of his wife stayed mostly out of reach, though one name surfaced quietly. Brittani. And in a career filled with noise, this silence spoke volumes.Aaron Rodgers has made it clear that this chapter of his life is different. Older, more reflective, and more intentional, he no longer treats his private world as public property. During Steelers training camp, he explained how marriage reshaped his outlook, both on and off the field.“When you meet the right one, and you’re with the right one, your whole world changes in a second,” Rodgers told NFL Network’s Kyle Brandt at Steelers training camp this summer.“To have that person who unconditionally loves you behind the scenes, there’s no better feeling. I’ve got the most incredible wife. I just really love her. I’m so thankful to have her by my side at the end. When you have that stability and rock behind you at the house, you feel like you can do anything. ”That sense of grounding did not appear overnight. Rodgers’ past relationships played out loudly. From Olivia Munn to Danica Patrick to Shailene Woodley, each connection carried attention, speculation, and eventually pain. Patrick later accused him of being “emotionally abusive.” Woodley reflected on their breakup with quiet sorrow, saying, “I haven’t shared much about my relationship with Aaron because it always makes me cry. It was not right. But it was beautiful.”Rodgers has not dodged accountability. In his 2024 Netflix documentary, he admitted, “I didn’t do myself any favors with some of the girls I dated after that that were in the public eye.”With Brittani, the approach changed. She avoids the spotlight entirely. Rodgers explained the reason plainly on “The Pat McAfee Show.” “It’s a sick society, isn’t it? I lived in the public eye for 20 years. I had a public relationship. How did that work out? Now I’m with somebody’s who private, who doesn’t want to be in the public eye, didn’t sign up to be a celebrity.”That privacy seems to have unlocked peace. Teammates see a calmer leader. Coaches see focus. Fans see a quarterback who looks settled at last. As Rodgers enters what could be his final NFL chapter, Brittani’s quiet presence may be the steady force that keeps his world balanced, even as the stadium lights burn brighter than ever.Also Read: Who is Josh Johnson, the Commanders’ emergency QB whose NFL resume includes stops with nearly half the league","Aaron Rodgers has kept his wife out of the spotlight.

Patrick Mahomes’ injury, surgery, and the timeline Kansas City is now staring at

Randi Mahomes thanked supporters as Patrick Mahomes posted ‘why this had to happen’

Patrick Mahomes is already in rehab after a season-ending left knee injury, and his mom is making it clear she is reading every message that comes in. Randi Mahomes posted public thanks this week after the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback underwent surgery, telling supporters she and her family appreciate the prayers and the words of encouragement.The update lands at the worst possible moment for Kansas City. Mahomes tore his left ACL and LCL in Week 15 against the Los Angeles Chargers, and the loss pushed the Chiefs out of playoff contention for the first time in the Mahomes era.Athlon Sports reported Mahomes suffered the injury against the Chargers and later underwent surgery on Monday. The report said the procedure was performed by Dallas Cowboys head physician and orthopedic surgeon Dan Cooper. Kansas City placed Mahomes on injured reserve, and the quarterback has already begun rehab.The medical timeline matters because it shapes everything the Chiefs do next. Chiefs vice president of sports medicine and performance Rick Burkholder said the recovery expectation is nine months, though it could swing by a month or two in either direction, per USA Today. That puts Mahomes’ 2026 season availability at the center of every offseason decision, even if the team stays quiet publicly.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Mahomes’ injury also closes the book on a season where he still produced. Athlon Sports noted he recorded 22 passing touchdowns and five rushing scores in 2025 before the knee gave out. Now the conversation shifts from stats to survival: how Kansas City steadies itself without the player it has been built around, and how quickly Mahomes can get back to full strength.The Chiefs missing the playoffs is the loudest headline. Athlon Sports called the Chargers loss the final blow to Kansas City’s postseason hopes. It is also a rare swing in the Mahomes era. Andy Reid’s teams had been a January constant, and Athlon Sports noted Kansas City reached the Super Bowl five times in the last six seasons, winning three. That is the standard Mahomes and the Chiefs are judged by, and it is why this injury lands like a crisis instead of a routine rehab story.The emotional side of this hit the public right away. TMZ reported Mahomes posted a message on X after the injury report became public, and he did not try to dress it up.“Don’t know why this had to happen,” Mahomes wrote. “And not going to lie, it’s hurts. But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again.” He also addressed the fan base directly in the same TMZ report.“Thank you, Chiefs kingdom, for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I will be back stronger than ever.”TMZ noted Randi Mahomes shared his message with a heart and prayer emoji, and her own posts kept the focus on gratitude. Athlon Sports reported she wrote a public message while also sharing about her “Home for the Holidays” event for the Kansas City community.“Thank you all for the prayers and kind messages for Patrick. We truly appreciate every one of them,” she wrote.Athlon Sports also reported she added a second note on her Instagram Stories. “Thank you for lifting Patrick up in prayer. We’re so thankful for this community.”That is the cleanest read on the moment. The family is not selling false optimism. They are acknowledging reality, leaning on faith, and keeping the message tight: Mahomes has surgery behind him, rehab in front of him, and a fan base watching every step.For the Chiefs, the next part is not dramatic. It is practical. Mahomes’ rehab is the story now, and the rest of the roster gets judged by how it responds to life without him. The one piece of good news, per Athlon Sports, is that Mahomes is on track to return to full health when the 2026 NFL season comes around. The rest is patience, and nine months can feel like forever when you are Kansas City.Moreover, Travis Kelce addressed speculation about his future with Patrick Mahomes on Friday, Dec. 19, after reporters asked whether the two might no longer play together following Mahomes’ season-ending knee injury. The 36-year-old Kansas City Chiefs tight end called the idea hard to process, responding, “Oh man, that’s crazy,” before making it clear his focus remains on the team. Kelce acknowledged this is “a unique time” in his career but stressed that he is locked in on finishing the season strong, saying he wants the attention on winning games and supporting the locker room rather than discussing what comes next.What's interesting is that the Tennessee Titans host the Kansas City Chiefs on Dec. 21 at Nissan Stadium, still searching for their first home win in 413 days after last winning in Nashville on Nov. 3, 2024, against the New England Patriots. Tennessee faces a rare opportunity against a Chiefs team already eliminated from playoff contention and without Patrick Mahomes, who suffered ACL and LCL tears last week. Gardner Minshew is set to start at quarterback, leading most analysts to expect a close, low-scoring game with mixed predictions on whether the Titans can finally snap their home losing streak.Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is dealing with more than a standard ACL injury, and one overlooked detail could quietly shape how his recovery unfolds. Team officials revealed that Mahomes also suffered an avulsion injury to his LCL, meaning the ligament pulled a small piece of bone away with it, which required quick surgical repair. According to orthopedic surgeon Dr. Matt Anderson, this type of injury can actually be favorable because it allows for bone-to-bone healing and keeps the ligament itself intact, though it can slow the early stages of rehab. The added ligament damage may make the first few months more restrictive, but doctors do not expect it to significantly change Mahomes’ long-term outlook or his projected return timeline for the 2026 NFL season.",Randi Mahomes thanks fans for their prayers as Patrick Mahomes begins rehab after season-ending knee surgery.

Indian star batter Smriti Mandhana created history during the first Women’s T20I match against Sri Lanka in Visakhapatnam on Sunday. The left-handed opener achieved a major milestone and entered an elite list in women’s T20 international cricket.Mandhana became the first Indian woman cricketer to score more than 4,000 runs in T20Is. This is a huge achievement for Indian cricket Overall, she is only the second woman in the world to reach this landmark.New Zealand legend Suzie Bates is the only other player to do so and currently has 4,716 runs in the format.What makes Mandhana’s record even more special is the speed at which she achieved it. She reached the 4,000-run mark in just 3,227 balls, which is faster than Suzie Bates, who took 3,675 balls to get there.This shows how consistent and attacking Mandhana has been over the years in T20 cricket.In the match against Sri Lanka, Mandhana scored 25 runs off 25 balls. She was dismissed in the ninth over while chasing a target of 122 runs.Even though her innings was short, it was enough for her to reach the historic milestone.This was also her first international appearance since India’s famous win in the ODI World Cup final last month, where they defeated South Africa to lift their maiden title.Earlier in the match, the Indian bowlers delivered a disciplined performance and restricted Sri Lanka to 121 runs for six wickets.

Hasini Perera and Harshitha Samarawickrama also contributed with scores of 20 and 21 respectively.Sri Lanka captain Chamari Athapaththu started aggressively but was dismissed by young pacer Kranti Gaud, giving India an early breakthrough.India’s bowlers kept things tight in the middle overs despite the presence of dew, which made gripping the ball difficult.Deepti Sharma bowled economically, while debutant Vaishnavi Sharma impressed everyone with a calm and controlled spell and gave away very few runs.","Smriti Mandhana becomes first Indian woman cricketer to score more than 4,000 runs in T20Is.

Randi Mahomes’ message brings calm as the Chiefs face a rare turning point

It feels like a strange place for the Kansas City Chiefs to be in, and the emotions of this moment stretch far beyond the field. Patrick Mahomes' season-ending knee injury has changed everything from the Chiefs' outlook on making the playoffs to bringing attention toward how his family is handling such a difficult time.Brittany Mahomes has avoided addressing the public, but Patrick's mother, Randi Mahomes, has been a steady and reassuring voice for fans.Following surgery to repair torn ACL and LCL ligaments in his left knee, which abruptly ended his 2025 season, Patrick Mahomes formally started his rehabilitation.

Who is Chris Oladokun for the Kansas City Chiefs



Kansas City Chiefs fans did not expect this December twist, but the season has demanded fast answers. With Patrick Mahomes sidelined and Gardner Minshew unable to finish the Week 16 battle in Tennessee, the franchise has turned to a name few outside Kansas City know well. The moment arrived suddenly, under pressure, and with playoff urgency still hanging in the air.In a year shaped by injuries and improvisation, the Chiefs are now leaning on continuity rather than star power. The choice reflects trust built quietly over time. Chris Oladokun has lived inside this system, studied it, and waited for a chance that seemed unlikely to come. Now, with the final stretch ahead, the ball is in his hands and the spotlight is no longer avoidable.Chris Oladokun’s path to this moment is anything but ordinary. He spent seven seasons in college football, moving through South Florida, Samford, and South Dakota State. His breakthrough came in 2021 at South Dakota State, where he finally earned a starting role and delivered results. Oladokun guided the Jackrabbits to an 11–4 record, throwing 25 touchdowns against seven interceptions while showing command and calm in pressure moments.The NFL did not roll out a red carpet. The Pittsburgh Steelers selected him in the seventh round of the 2022 draft, but his stay was short. After final roster cuts, Kansas City offered him a quieter opportunity. Oladokun joined the practice squad, learned the playbook, and absorbed the culture of a championship locker room. That decision changed everything.He earned two Super Bowl rings with the Chiefs and built trust with coaches by staying ready even when game days passed without action. His first NFL snaps came in 2024 against the Broncos, a brief appearance that showed his mobility but offered little chance to throw.Sunday in Tennessee was different. When Minshew went down, Oladokun stepped in and delivered a composed performance. He completed 11 of 16 passes for 111 yards and posted an 88.3 passer rating. The stat line mattered, but the poise mattered more. He ran the offense, protected the football, and kept the huddle steady in a difficult road environment.Now, with injuries reshaping the depth chart, Oladokun stands as the likely starter. His deep knowledge of the system gives the Kansas City Chiefs stability at a time when chaos would be easy. On Christmas night at Arrowhead, the moment will test him fully. For Oladokun, it is not about proving he belongs. He has already stayed long enough to earn the chance.Also Read: Who is Aaron Rodgers’ wife Brittani: Everything you need to know as Steelers QB's marriage mystery deepens","Chris Oladokun is the likely starter for the Kansas City Chiefs.

His heartfelt comments describing her as “incredible” have fueled curiosity, especially with no photos or appearances to confirm her identity. Rodgers’ rare openness highlights a deeply private love story unfolding away from the spotlight.

Why Aaron Rodgers’ quiet love story continues to fascinate fans

Aaron Rodgers is not only a great quarterback in the NFL, he is also among the most discussed players of the league as he is controversial due to his frankness, individuality, and weirdness in his approach to fame.In early 2025, the Pittsburgh Steelers star stated that he was married but did not want people to know much about his wife. Her name is Brittani, but even after months of curiosity, she has not been seen. She has no photos, no appearances in the media, no social media posts. Such silence has only given people increased curiosity which has turned the personal life of Rodgers into one of the most confusing off-field stories of the NFL.Steelers star Aaron Rodgers shocked fans in December 2024 when he announced that Brittani was his girlfriend on The Pat McAfee Show. June 2025, the interest increased when he visited the Steelers facility wearing a wedding ring and this confirmed they were married although he had failed to announce it publicly but Rodgers offered no public details.However, during Steelers training camp in July, Rodgers opened up emotionally in an interview with NFL Network, offering his clearest insight yet into his marriage.“When you meet the right one, and you’re with the right one, your whole world changes in a second,” he said. “And to have that person that unconditionally loves you behind the scenes, there's no better feeling in the world, and I have the most incredible wife. I just really love her.”Rodgers did not talk a lot or idealize his relationship. He instead concentrated more on emotional foundation, support and personal development as Brittani proves that she maintains things in the background.Aaron Rodgers puts a stark contrast between his image in the public and his personal tranquility by maintaining the privacy of his marriage. When being seen can be a way of being proven correct, Rodgers has proven to be the best player in the game and has shown that sometimes being silent and not showing everything is best.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers’ mystery marriage raises questions after Olivia Munn reveals what she endured",Aaron Rodgers has confirmed he is married but has kept his wife Brittani out of the public eye.

Auston Matthews and the pressure point Toronto cannot ignore

The mood around the Maple Leafs has shifted from confidence to caution. Toronto entered the season expecting its captain to set the pace, yet nights now pass where the scoreboard stays silent for stretches that feel unfamiliar. Auston Matthews still generates chances, still competes hard in all three zones, but goals no longer arrive with the same inevitability. In a market that measures greatness shift by shift, that absence has grown louder than any cheer.What makes this moment heavier is timing. Toronto is not rebuilding or experimenting. This is a team built to win now. When production stalls at the center of that plan, anxiety spreads quickly. Conversations that once felt unthinkable are now whispered openly, not because Matthews has fallen off, but because expectations around him remain sky high.The tension spiked when Maple Leafs reporter Howard Berger suggested the organization will not move forward until Auston Matthews asks for a trade, possibly by this year’s trade deadline. That idea alone rattled the fanbase. Matthews has been the franchise constant for nearly a decade.Imagining Toronto without him feels like pulling a load-bearing wall from the house.On the ice, the frustration has roots. Auston Matthews continues to win faceoffs, backcheck, and handle defensive responsibility. Yet Toronto pays him to swing games offensively. At five-on-five, his line has not consistently owned shifts. On the power play, the dominance that once felt automatic has faded into predictability. The looks are there, but the finish has gone missing.That gap between effort and outcome feeds scrutiny. In Toronto, leadership is judged through goals when the stakes rise. When scoring dries up, every shift becomes a test of authority and legacy. Nick Kypreos tried to strike a more hopeful tone in the Toronto Star, but optimism struggles to breathe when results lag behind reputation.The coaching staff has searched for answers. Different wingers, altered looks, and tactical tweaks have come and gone. The puck still moves well, but the instinctive scoring touch that defined Matthews has not returned with consistency. There is also quiet talk of tension with coach Craig Berube, another layer that complicates an already delicate situation.Trading a captain in his prime is not standard practice. Neither is standing still while doubt grows inside a contender. Toronto management now faces a narrow path where action and inaction both carry consequences. Whether Berger’s report proves prophetic or premature, it captures how fragile this stretch feels.Matthews remains elite. Yet in this market, elite alone no longer settles the noise. The next few months will decide more than standings. They will define how this era is remembered, and whether Auston Matthews and Toronto find clarity together or part under pressure. Maple Lead's season has not been up to their mark and there will be few shake-up in near future.Also Read: Are Auston Matthews and Craig Berube drifting apart as Maple Leafs struggles spark tense locker-room speculation?","The mood around the Maple Leafs has shifted from confidence to caution.

How Seth Jarvis’ injury could impact the Carolina Hurricanes’ season



Seth Jarvis’ injury has sent a push through the Carolina Hurricanes’ season at a time when consistency and scoring depth were all that mattered. The forward went down hard in overtime against the Florida Panthers at Amerant Bank Arena, and the result is worrying for the team as he is set to be “out for a while,” as per the head coach Rod Brind’Amour.The moment unfolded quickly and brutally. Twenty seconds into overtime, Jarvis drove hard to the net while being pressured by Evan Rodrigues and crashed full speed into the left post. He could not get back to his feet on his own, needed support to leave the ice, and disappeared. Brind’Amour did not sugarcoat it afterward, calling the injury “not good,” leaving Carolina fans concerned about a significant absence.Before the injury, Jarvis was not just another piece of the lineup. He was one of the Hurricanes’ most productive forwards this season, sitting second on the team with 29 points from 19 goals and 10 assists in just 34 games. He also delivered two assists in that very game, helping Carolina race to a 3-0 lead before Florida fought back, forced overtime, and eventually won 4-3 in a shootout. Losing a player producing at that level is a major competitive blow.Beyond current form, Jarvis has been a central part of Carolina’s offense in recent years.The 23-year-old star has already established himself as a well-renowned name in the NHL with 240 points under his belt and a pattern of upping his game come playoff time with 43 points in 55 postseason games. This particular skill of his makes the injury particularly troublesome with a Hurricane franchise still seeking consistency.With no fixed time frame on when he would return, Carolina finds himself dealing with lineups that will need some changes, new roles, and new players being called on to provide the same level of point production that Jarvis brings. His absence changes matchups, special-teams decisions, and overall offensive rhythm. For a team built on depth and structure, this is a real test. As the Hurricanes navigate the coming weeks, every update on Seth Jarvis will matter because his health could shape not only their immediate stretch of games but also the direction of their season.Also Read: Seth Jarvis injury update: Andrei Svechnikov’s high stick takes Hurricanes forward out with upper-body setback","Seth Jarvis went down hard in overtime against the Florida Panthers.

In March 2025, Xavier Worthy showed off his new custom-built garage, almost a year after his expensive car was stolen

In May 2024, Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Xavier Worthy’s expensive car was stolen after it went missing overnight, the Kansas City Police Department told the Kansas City Star. The car was reportedly taken from a downtown parking garage at Two Light Apartments in the 1400 block of Grand Boulevard. A source for Mike Florio of NBC Sports said Worthy’s car was stolen from a residential garage by a professional group of criminals who “knew exactly what they were doing.” Xavier was not in the car when it was taken and was unharmed; there was no carjacking. Only a month had passed since the Chiefs drafted him in the first round when his car was stolen. As of late 2025, there have reportedly been no public reports indicating that Worthy ever recovered his stolen car. Cut to the present: through his TikTok pages, Worthy reportedly owns four cars costing over $1 million. Let’s find out which are those.According to Spotrac, Chiefs wide receiver Xavier Worthy signed a four-year contract worth $13.79 million in June 2024.

The US Sun reported in March 2025 that Worthy drove a Dodge Charger in college.On another TikTok page, he was seen posing in front of a shiny black Mercedes SUV.In March, Daily Athlete reported on Instagram that Worthy owns several other luxury cars, including a Bugatti. Xavier will make $800,000 after taxes in the 2025 season.J. Arturo Trujillo of Marca reported in March that instead of purchasing an expensive car, Worthy decided to customize his garage. He filled the place with key moments from his football career: huge photos of him with the Chiefs, time spent at the University of Texas, and a record-breaking performance at the NFL Combine. The garage floor had a striking bluish-black abstract art and featured “Chosen 1,” reflecting Worthy’s unique playing style. CH Customs helped with the customization. Xavier shared a video of his revamped garage on TikTok, and it quickly gained a lot of recognition.Also Read: Xavier Worthy: Rising Star, Super Bowl Hopes, Career Highlights, and More","Xavier Worthy signed a four-year contract worth $13.79 million in June 2024.

Montreal Canadiens bring back Phillip Danault from Los Angeles Kings in major trade move,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/montreal-canadiens-bring-back-phillip-danault-from-los-angeles-kings-in-major-trade-move/articleshow/126093118.cms,"Phillip Danault reunites with Montreal Canadiens (Image via: Getty Images)

The Montreal Canadiens’ strategy in bringing back Phillip Danault from Los Angeles Kings



The Montreal Canadiens have reacquired center Phillip Danault from the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for a second-round pick in the 2026 NHL Draft. Danault, 32, returns to the team where he played from 2015 through 2021, bringing familiarity, experience, and stability to Montreal’s lineup as the team looks to improve midseason.Danault’s return is straightforward: the Canadiens wanted to get better. Known for his defensive reliability and versatility, he can contribute at both ends of the ice. With one year remaining on his $5.5 million contract, Danault adds depth down the middle while mentoring younger players in Montreal’s roster.Danault was originally a first-round pick by the Chicago Blackhawks in 2011 and has since played 741 NHL games, scoring 399 points, including 125 goals and 274 assists. In 62 playoff games, he scored 28 points, proving his ability to perform in high-pressure scenarios.From 2015 to 2021, Danault recorded 194 points in 360 games with the Canadiens. He has five assists in 30 games this season with the Kings, but he does more than just score. He can handle challenging matchups against elite opponents and is a good defensive player who excels on penalty kills.Adding Phillip Danault to the lineup is also expected to bring some stability to the team's scoring lineup because Danault has extensive experience with the system used by the team.Danault’s experience with the Canadiens goes beyond the stats as well. He knows the locker room, the culture of the team, as well as the ability to mentor some of the young players. This will go a long way in maintaining some sort of balance, something the Canadiens would need as they make a push for the playoffs.In general, the Canadiens are doing what is required of them at this stage; this is because the team is looking for a trusted and seasoned center who can play the opposition from start to finish. The return of Danault is expected to boost the depth, veteran leadership, and overall performance of the Canadiens ahead of the playoffs.Also Read: NHL trade rumors: Phillip Danault linked with potential move from LA Kings as Montreal Canadiens, New Jersey Devils and Carolina Hurricanes emerge as top contendors","The Montreal Canadiens have reacquired center Phillip Danault from the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for a second-round pick in the 2026 NHL Draft.

Broncos defense faces a major test, but Jones’ message sets the tone

The Denver Broncos’ Week 15 win felt like a very strong promise to see and envision a strong playoff push. However, the mood shifted once news broke that Brandon Jones would miss the rest of the season. The Denver Broncos safety suffered an unfortunate pectoral injury, which has now severely impacted what had been one of his most impactful years in the NFL Jones’ spirit and determination seem to be intact despite the injury, as seen in his new post on Instagram. He put up an inspiring and confident message, updating everyone that he was mentally strong. His statement earned the respect of fans, with many of his NFL friends cheering him on.Soon after the injury became official, Jones shared a powerful Instagram post reflecting on his journey with Denver.

Anthony Davis powers through illness as Dallas Mavericks prepare for tough road test against Philadelphia 76ers

Anthony Davis’ long-term future in Dallas faces fresh doubt as trade talk grows louder

The Dallas Mavericks, who have an uncomfortable 11-17 record and are ranked 11th in the West, will play the Philadelphia 76ers tonight. Throughout the season, the Mavs have appeared disconnected from success. Cooper Flagg, their newest recruit, had a difficult rookie season, and Anthony Davis, Luka Doncic's successor, is probably going to be replaced shortly.Despite being in challenging physical condition, Davis performed admirably in a victory against the Detroit Pistons last time out. Despite having a damaged left calf and an illness, the Mavericks big man continued to play a lot of minutes and had a great influence despite missing a recent game due to the ailment.On Saturday night, the Philadelphia 76ers (15-11) will play the Dallas Mavericks (11-17) in the second half of a back-to-back game. The upcoming 25th Anniversary Celebration Game, which is sponsored by Crypto.com and has a retro Hardwood Classic theme, will begin at Xfinity Mobile Arena at 7 p.m. ET.Without Anthony Davis, Dallas defeated the Detroit Pistons 116-114 in overtime on Thursday. With 23 points and 10 rebounds, top choice Cooper Flagg—who turns 19 on Sunday—recorded his fourth NBA double-double.The last time out, Davis made a valiant attempt against the Detroit Pistons. Despite nearly missing the game, Davis played a significant amount of time and finished with an outstanding 15 points, 18 rebounds, and 3 blocks in an overtime victory.In 37 minutes of action, he ended with 15 points, 18 rebounds, and 3 blocks to help the Mavs win 116-114 in overtime on Thursday. Davis stated after the game that although he is still feeling under the weather, he did his best to support his team's victory.“Still feel under the weather,” Davis said. “I actually threw up twice during the game, but I’m just trying to compete. I’m just trying to do whatever I can to help the team win. Just leaving it all on the floor.”The Mavs will now travel to Philadelphia on Saturday to play the 76ers. Despite his illness, Davis is listed as probable for the forthcoming game. This season, Davis has made 12 appearances and averaged 19.6 points, 10.8 rebounds, 3.1 assists, and 1.8 blocks per contest.It's possible that Anthony Davis' future in Dallas won't be as unclear as the Mavericks would like. Despite Dallas's public indications that an extension might still be in the works, ESPN's Tim MacMahon stated this week that he anticipates Davis being dealt.“The Mavericks are telling people, ‘Oh, we still might extend him this summer,’” MacMahon said. “If you do that, that’s not gonna be good business for the Mavericks. I’m being told that and I don’t believe that.“I’ll put it like that. I think it’s a matter of when and not if Anthony Davis is traded. I just don’t know when.”Davis may be the most likely trade departure since he gives the Bulls the most opportunity to recover choices, according to Sam Quinn of CBS Sports.“A trade seemed certain the moment Nico Harrison was fired. Now, there’s a bit of uncertainty. The Mavericks are playing well. Kyrie Irving could return. Could Harrison’s dream be fulfilled by his successors? That’s the question mark here,” Quinn wrote.In August, Davis will be eligible for a four-year deal worth a maximum of $275 million. In addition to earning $54.1 million this season and $58.5 million the following year, he has a $62.8 million player option for 2027–2028.Also read: NBA injury update: Dallas Mavericks guard Dante Exum ruled out for entire season after knee surgery","The Dallas Mavericks, who have an uncomfortable 11-17 record and are ranked 11th in the West, will play the Philadelphia 76ers tonight.

Luka Doncic goes into Saturday night without a clear answer attached to his name. He is not listed as out or questionable for the Lakers’ December 20 game against the Clippers, which usually points toward availability. Still, the situation is not clean. The Lakers are short-handed, and Doncic has dealt with small interruptions this season that make any appearance worth monitoring.Since arriving in February 2025, Doncic has carried a heavy load. The Los AngelesLakers depend on him to organize the offense, control pace, and close games. With the roster thinned by injuries, his presence or absence matters more than usual.The Lakers and Clippers meet again at Crypto.com Arena, a matchup that rarely needs added context. Both teams are chasing position in the West, and games like this often matter later when tiebreakers surface. If Doncic plays, the Lakers lean on his steady production, around 35 points, eight rebounds, and nine assists per game, alongside LeBron James, who is not listed on the injury report.There is no official injury keeping Luka Doncic off the floor. That stands out after earlier absences tied to personal reasons and minor issues such as a finger sprain.He remains the focal point of the offense and recently finished with 29 points in a win despite an uneven shooting night. His conditioning work has helped him handle long stretches with the ball, and if he plays, the Lakers expect him to run the game.Los Angeles Lakers are missing several rotation players, which tightens the margin for error.With Reaves and Vincent unavailable, ball-handling duties fall even more heavily on Doncic and James.The Clippers are also dealing with absences across the lineup.If James Harden plays, he becomes a direct matchup concern in isolation.","Luka Doncic is not listed as out or questionable for the Lakers’ December 20 game against the Clippers, which usually points toward availability.

Sebastian Coe’s words fuel belief in Britain’s next middle-distance star Ben Hoggins



Sebastian Coe: The Record-Breaking Legend Behind World Athletics #shorts

Some athletic records seem untouchable. Sebastian Coe ’s British 800-metre record of 1:41.73, set in 1981, is one of them. For almost 50 years, it has stood as the standard for every British middle-distance runner. Now, the conversation is shifting as new talent emerges and belief grows that the mark could finally fall.That belief has been backed by Coe himself. The World Athletics President has publicly praised the 23-year-old Olympian Ben Hoggins. His comments have added serious weight to growing expectations around British middle-distance running. With Scotland producing world champions and confidence rising across the squad, the moment feels right for a challenge to one of the sport’s greatest national records.Sebastian Coe has rarely spoken so openly about a young British runner. His praise for Hoggins reflects more than talent. It highlights mindset and belief. Speaking to Athletics Weekly, Coe said, “He’s very talented, and you need to win things and with that comes an infectious confidence.”He then compared Hoggins to Britain’s current stars and said, “I’ve seen that with Jake (Wightman) and Josh (Kerr) as well. You need to get up onto pole position ,and sometimes the rest of your career just follows.It’s a psychological breakthrough as much as anything.”Britain is currently enjoying a golden era in middle-distance running. Wightman ended a 38-year wait for a men’s 1500m world title in 2022. Kerr followed by winning the world championship a year later. Both victories echoed the dominance of Coe’s own era.While Hoggins looks to the future, another British runner has already come close to Coe’s record. At the 2025 World Championships in Tokyo, Max Burgin ran a personal best of 1:42.29. That time was just 0.56 seconds away from the legendary mark.The race was described by Coe as a “proper, proper 800m race.” It was fast from the opening lap. The pace helped push Burgin to a new level. After the race, Burgin said he now feels “comfortable at that low 1:42” and added that it “makes sense next year to be pushing to those 1:41s.”That performance showed the record is no longer safe. With Burgin closing in and Hoggins earning Coe’s trust, British athletics may finally be approaching a historic run.Also Read: Adam Peaty and Holly Ramsay escape to Lapland for holidays ahead of wedding amid family drama and swimmer’s mom's 60th birthday","Sebastian Coe has publicly praised British middle-distance star Ben Hoggins.

VISAKHAPATNAM: Taking the field for the first time as the reigning ODI champions, India began their preparations for the next year’s T20 World Cup in style with a dominating eight-wicket victory against hapless Sri Lanka to take 1-0 lead in the five-match T20 series, at the ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium here on Sunday.Inviting the opposition to bat first, India rode on a collective bowling effort to restrict Sri Lanka to a below-par 121/6 in good batting conditions. Later, Jemimah Rodrigues provided a masterclass in chasing with an unbeaten 69 off 44 balls (10x4) to guide India home in 14.4 overs.Chasing the total, India lost Shafali Varma in the second over (9 off 5b; 2x4) when she was caught at mid-wicket off Kawya Kavindi. But Mandhana and Jemimah added 54 runs (42 balls) for the second wicket to lay the foundation. Mandhana and Jemimah found gaps with perfection.Both combined to hit the 17-year-old leftarm wrist spinner Shashini Gimhani for 16 runs to take India to 55/1 in powerplay.Mandhana (25 off 25b; 4x4) was dismissed against the run of play when she was caught at the extra deep cover off Inoka Ranaweera in the 9th over. At the other end, Jemimah used her deft touches, guiding the spinners to boundaries behind the wicket.She lofted Gimhani over mid-off to reach her half-century in 34 deliveries and reverse-swept and cut next hitting four boundaries in the 12th over. In the company of captain Kaur (15 not out), Jemimah ensured an easy win for the hosts.Earlier, captain Chamari Athapaththu (15 off 12b; 3x4) began well pulling and cutting Kranti Goud for two boundaries in the third over. But she was done in by a ball that moved in sharply to rattle her stumps in the same over.Vishmi Gunaratne (39 off 43b; 1x4, 1x6) and Hasini Perera (20 off 23b; 2x4) then chose caution over aggression taking them to 31/1 in powerplay. They added just 31 in 38 deliveries as the boundaries were hard to come by despite the bowlers struggling with the dew.",Jemimah Rodrigues scores unbeaten 69 as India beat Sri Lanka by eight wickets.
