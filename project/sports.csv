Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty set to face formidable Chia-Soh in Paris Olympics quarterfinals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/satwiksairaj-rankireddy-and-chirag-shetty-set-to-face-formidable-chia-soh-in-paris-olympics-quarterfinals/articleshow/112174812.cms,"NEW DELHI: In the upcoming quarterfinals at the Paris Olympics , the Indian men's doubles team, comprising Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty , is set to face the Malaysian duo of Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik , who secured a bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics.This match is highly anticipated, given the competitive history between the two pairs. Rankireddy and Shetty, previously ranked number one globally, advanced as the leaders of Group C, setting up their encounter with Chia and Soh, who were the runners-up in Group A, trailing behind the world's top-ranked pair from China, Liang Wei Keng and Wang Chang.The Malaysian team, which once dominated the head-to-head record against the Indian shuttlers with eight consecutive wins, has recently faced three consecutive defeats in their latest matchups.A victory in this quarterfinal would potentially pit the Indian pair against the tournament's top seeds, Liang and Wang, assuming the latter triumphs over the Indonesian team of Fajar Alfian and Muhammad Rian Ardianto in their quarterfinal match.The competition between the Indian and Malaysian pairs has always been fiercely contested, with both sides aspiring to clinch their country's first badminton gold medal in the Olympics.The Malaysian pair is recognized for their strategic prowess, precision, and fast-paced gameplay. In contrast, Rankireddy and Shetty are known for their aggressive playing style, which they will need to employ effectively from the start to overcome their opponents.Having previously experienced several defeats against Chia and Soh, the Indian pair managed to secure their first victory against the Malaysians at the Indonesia Open Super 1000 final in the previous year, followed by wins at the 2022 Asian Games individual event and the India Open.Elsewhere in the tournament, the second half of the draw features a match between the second-seeded Danish pair of Kim Astrup and Anders Rasmussen and the fourth-seeded Korean team of Kang Min Hyuk and Seo Seung Jae.Furthermore, Thailand's Supak Jomkoh and Kedren Kittinupong will compete against the Tokyo Olympic gold medallists Lee Yang and Wang Chi-Lin from Chinese Taipei, promising a series of compelling matches in the men's doubles category.","Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty to face Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik in quarterfinals.

"Paris Olympics: Two in the bag, super Manu Bhaker not done yet",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/paris-olympics-two-in-the-bag-super-manu-bhaker-not-done-yet/articleshow/112153753.cms,"Shooting star 1st Indian post-1947 to win 2 medals at 1 Olympic

CHATEAUROUX: ""No time to celebrate. My work is unfinished. There's a lot to play for,"" Manu Bhaker had said after winning her first Olympic medal on Sunday. There indeed was a lot more at stake. There was a date with history too. The belief that it was around the corner could be seen in the glint of her eyes, in the clenching of teeth when she smiled.Manu wanted another medal badly and she got it on Tuesday: a second bronze medal, which made her the first Indian after Independence to win two medals at the same Olympic Games.Norman Pritchard , a sprinter born in 1875 in then Calcutta, bagged two silver medals in the 1900 Games, which incidentally was also held in Paris . But that was 124 years ago, lost in the pages of India's Olympic history. While IOC lists him as an Indian, World Athletics credits his medals to Britain.Manu's second bronze came in the company of another 22-year-old, a first-time Olympian - the shy Sarabjot Singh - in 10m air pistol mixed team event.For Manu, it was a reward for believing in herself when she was going through a dark period. It was the karma thing she has been talking about here. ""Do your work - the hard yards - the result will come,"" she again said on Tuesday.The two medals… it is all sinking in, yes, but I must keep my emotions in check. I have one more event left to play,""Manu said. Two in the bag, but she is not done yet. Manu has been shooting well and a third medal one now looks a real possibility. The 25m pistol individual is her pet event.Manu showed her form again in the mixed battle for bronze. She looked composed when she walked in 30 minutes before the competition to set up her station. She did some shadow shooting, took a deep breath and walked out as if lost in thought. When she returned with Sarabjot for the competition, she looked ready. No sign of nerves. Sarabjot's face showed nothing, but he said later that he was feeling the pressure.The South Korean pair consisted of Lee Wanho and women's 10m air pistol individual gold medallist Oh Ye Jin. The way the Indians and the South Koreans shot was an interesting contrast to watch. Manu shot consistently. She had seven consecutive 10s. Sarabjot struggled a bit. Wanho shot like a dream, Jin had a night mare of a time. That made the difference.Manu started well with a 10.2. Sarabjot had a terrible 8.6. India was down 0-2. The winner needed to get to 16 first, which meant eight wins.Manu got 10.7 in the second try and Sarabjot shot a 10.5. The Koreans were way behind this time. 2-2. The Indians then hit a purple patch with both hitting 10s in their third and fourth tries to go up 6-2. Manu again shot a 10.5, Sarabjot managed just 9.6 but Jin's poor form helped. The Indians were up 8-2.That was when Wanho decided to find a rare zone. 10.8! It was 8-4 now. But the Koreans slipped again in the seventh shot and the Indians were cruising at 10-4.Then Manu had her first bad shot - 8.3. The Koreans had reduced the gap to 10-6. From there, it was 12-6 and 14-6. Jin's meltdown was surprising, not pretty to watch. The Indians were not complaining. They needed just two more points.Wanho staged a late comeback. He had not given up. He shot two consecutive 10.8s, which helped the Koreans reduce the gap again - 14-10. The 13th shot sealed the issue. Wanho shot a miserable 9. Manu had a 9.4, but Sarabjot shot 10.2. That was enough.India took two timeouts in between when the pressure seemed to mount. It helped them calm their nerves.Job done, Manu and Sarabjot stood on the stage with the Tricolour wrapped around their shoulders, and posed, as a small contingent of Indian supporters made quite some noise in the stands. It was the fans' time to get trigger happy.While the celebrations were on in the stands, Jaspal Rana was long gone. The medal assured, Manu's coach picked his bag, put on his shades and got up to leave. He accepted a hug and a handshake. ""Salute to you, Jaspal. You gave the girl confidence and courage."" He smiled, struggling to control his emotions and walked away swiftly.",Manu Bhaker becomes first Indian post-1947 to win 2 medals at 1 Olympic Games.

The scenes from India's training session at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Wednesday have been received by fans and the cricket fraternity as reassurance that former captain Virat Kohli and the Indian team's new head coach Gautam Gambhir have moved on from their past difference to achieve a common goal -- the success of Team India.Kohli, who arrived in Sri Lanka as part of India's ODI squad ahead of the three-match series, was seen having a long chat with Gambhir; and the laughter shared by the two conveyed that the former teammates have buried the hatchet and are comfortable in their reunion in new roles.The pictures were widely shared on social media, including by the Indian Premier League franchise Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) that Kohli represents and even the International Cricket Council.In a cheeky caption for the image where both Kohli and Gambhir are seen laughing, the RCB's post on 'X' read: Our seasoned right-arm quick convincing the gaffer to give him the new ball.""The Rajasthan Royals also couldn't stop themselves from sharing and reacting to the images of bonhomie between Kohli and Gambhir, both of who were part of India's 2011 ODI World Cup triumph.The RR post read: ""Can't unsee it"".The International Cricket Council also joined in via Instagram and captioned the image of Gambhir cracking up as: ""Why is Gautam Gambhir going"" followed by a laughing emoji.Like Kohli, Rohit Sharma has also returned from a well-deserved rest, as both had announced their retirement from the T20Is following India's T20 World Cup triumph last month. The tournament also marked the end of Dravid's tenure as India's head coach.Interestingly, after initial reports of Rohit and Kohli not likely to play the ODIs in Sri Lanka, the new head coach Gambhir had urged the seniors to make themselves available for the three-match series, after which both were named in the squad.Before the ODIs, the Suryakumar Yadav-led Indian team defeated Sri Lanka 3-0 in the T20Is.

NEW DELHI: In 1928, Indian hockey embarked on a journey that got written and rewritten in 'golden' words, where the team won medals for 10 Olympics in a row. The 44-year run of consecutive podium finishes included a period of 28 years that saw a couple of World Wars, India getting independence and six Olympic editions where the hockey team won six successive gold medals without losing a match.At the 1952 Helsinki Games, wrestler KD Jadhav won India's first post-independence individual medal, a bronze.It was the first occasion when the hockey team's medal had company. But what hockey kept waiting for, since winning its first medal on 26th May 1928, was an Indian 'team' from another sport to join it as an Olympic medal winner.That wait ended after 96 years on July 30th 2024, at the Paris Games when the shooting duo of Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh became the first Indian 'team' apart from hockey to win an Olympic medal.is how hockey legend and three-time Olympic medallist Harbinder Singh reacted in surprise when Timesofindia.com reached out to him over the phone for his reaction on the unique parallel of Manu and Sarabjot's bronze-medal win. The Indians defeated their South Korean opponents, Oh Ye Jin and Wonho Lee, 16-10 on Tuesday in the third-place playoff in the10m air pistol mixed team event.It was Manu's second medal of the Games, after she opened India's account in Paris with a bronze in the women's 10m air pistol individual event.""These two young kids have done well. Good for hockey to have company now with another team, as you pointed out. It never struck me,"" he added.""It still gives me goosebumps when I think of winning the gold medal by beating Pakistan in the (Tokyo) 1964 final, after we had lost to them in the final of the (Rome) 1960 Olympics,"" Harbinder recalled. ""I remember we landed at the Palam airport in Delhi and the entire airport was packed with fans who had come to welcome us.""Talking about similarities to hockey's 96-year wait for an Indian 'team' from another sport to win an Olympic medal, it took 44 years after KD Jadhav's 1952 bronze to have another individual Olympic medal winner from India.

Calcutta Boy

Football Hero

Hollywood Calling

Manu Bhaker made history as the first Indian athlete , post Independence, to win two medals in the same Olympic Games by securing a bronze medal in the 10m air pistol mixed team event with Sarabjot Singh. Two days earlier, she had claimed India's first medal at the Paris Olympics , becoming the first Indian female shooter to win an Olympic medal.Before that there was another ‘Indian’ who managed that task, even though the history records have a minor quibble over whether he qualified as British or Indian.What is not in dispute is that he won two silver medals at the Paris Games 1900, the same venue where Bhaker made history. He was also the first person to score a hat-trick in an official football match on Indian soil and also the first Olympian to become a star in ‘silent’ Hollywood. And he did it in Paris as well. Of course, pedantic folks could argue that Bhaker won her second medal in a mixed team event while Pritchard won his medals in individual events.Pritchard’s nationality also remained a prickly affair. In 2000, British Olympic historian, the late Ian Buchanan, had claimed that the silver medals Pritchard won (in 200m and 200m hurdles) should be awarded to Great Britain. While it’s true that Pritchard was chosen to represent Great Britain after competing in the British AAA championship, the International Olympic Committee credits India for the medals.Norman Pritchard, born on June 23, 1875, in Calcutta (now Kolkata), India, holds a unique place in the annals of Olympic history . He was the first Indian and Asian-born athlete to win an Olympic medal, achieving this feat at the 1900 Paris Olympics. He was also the first person to score a hat-trick in a professional football game, a founding member of the Indian Football Association and later the first Olympian to participate inPritchard was the son of George Petersen Pritchard, an Englishman who managed a family business in India. He grew up in a well-to-do family, which provided him access to excellent education and opportunities in sports. His athletic talents were nurtured at St. Xavier's College in Calcutta, where he excelled in sprinting and hurdling, quickly gaining recognition in regional athletic meets. His speed and agility were unparalleled at the time, setting the stage for his future successes.In 1900, Pritchard travelled to Paris to compete in the Summer Olympics, a groundbreaking moment as he became the first athlete from India to participate in the Olympics. He competed in the 200 meters, 200 meters hurdles, and 110 meters hurdles. His performance was outstanding; he won silver medals in both the 200 meters and 200 meters hurdles, marking the first time an athlete from India had won Olympic medals. In the 200 meters hurdles, Pritchard set a then Olympic record of 26.8 seconds in the semi-finals, and in the final, he clocked 26 seconds to win silver, behind USA’s Alvin Kraenzlein, who set a new Olympic record.Beyond his Olympic feats, Pritchard also had a notable football career. He is credited with scoring the first hat-trick in an open football tournament in India while playing for St. Xavier's College against Sovabazar in July 1897. He served as the Secretary of the Indian Football Association from 1900 to 1902, contributing significantly to the development of the sport in India.After his Olympic success, Pritchard moved to England and later to the United States, where he transitioned into a career in the entertainment industry. Even how he transitioned to Hollywood is a remarkable story.In December 1906, during a dinner in London, Norman Pritchard was asked to recount the grandeur of the 1899 durbar in Delhi, held to welcome Lord Curzon as the Viceroy of India. His vivid and dramatic description was so compelling that Sir Charles Wyndham, a prominent figure in theatre, mistook him for an actor and invited him to play a minor role in ""The Stronger Sex"" at the Apollo Theatre in 1907.Pritchard's performance was successful, prompting Sir Charles to encourage him to pursue acting seriously. Pritchard made his Broadway debut in the United States with ""The Elder Son"" at the Playhouse Theatre on September 15, 1914. In 1919, he played a significant role in a strike action at the Schubert Theater in Washington, leading a boycott as a member of the trade union, The Equity, to demand better wages for actors.Adopting the stage name Norman Trevor, he found a niche in Hollywood as a character actor. He appeared in numerous films and Broadway productions, gaining moderate success. His Broadway debut came with ""The Elder Son"" at the Playhouse Theatre in 1914. He went on to act in 26 plays and 27 movies, making his big screen debut in silent movies with ""After Dark"" in 1915 and ending with ""Tonight at Twelve,"" released in 1929, the year of his death.Pritchard passed away on October 31, 1929, in Norwalk, California, under tragic circumstances. His obituary stated that he died of a ""brain malady,"" and it is now speculated that he may have been suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Despite his relatively early death, his legacy endures, particularly in India, where he is celebrated as a pioneer in athletics. His accomplishments paved the way for future generations of Indian athletes, inspiring them to compete on the world stage.","Norman Pritchard was the first Indian and Asian-born athlete to win an Olympic medal, achieving this feat at the 1900 Paris Olympics.

On Thursday, Elon Musk dared Kamala Harris to speak up on the recent controversy where Italian boxer Angela Carini lost to Algerian fighter Imane Khelif who had failed a sex test last year. The bout last only 46 seconds after which Angela Carini withdrew saying she had never been hit like that and the pain from the punch was too much. A host of popular American politicos have weighed in on the debate, as did Elon Musk who saw it as an opportunity to attack Kamala Harris.An X user wrote: “Kamala Harris supports this… Vote accordingly.” To this, Musk replied: “True or let her deny it.”A host of others also criticised the event and the IOC. JK Rowling wrote: “Could any picture sum up our new men’s rights movement better? The smirk of a male who’s knows he’s protected by a misogynist sporting establishment enjoying the distress of a woman he’s just punched in the head, and whose life’s ambition he’s just shattered.”Meghan McCain wrote: “How soon until a biological woman is beat to death in a situation like this? This is lunacy. Save women’s sports.”Italian boxer Angela Carini broke down in tears after she decided to abandon her bout against Algerian fighter Imane Khelif just 46 seconds into the match, a fight that has sparked significant controversy at the Olympics.Khelif is one of two boxers allowed to compete at the Olympics despite being disqualified from last year's women’s world championships due to failing testosterone and gender eligibility tests.In emotional scenes at the North Paris Arena, Carini explained that she chose to stop the fight after being hit harder than she had ever experienced before. The first punch dislodged her chinstrap, and the second struck her chin, causing her nose to bleed.“I am heartbroken,” Carini said. “I entered the ring to honour my father. I've been called a warrior many times, but I had to stop for my health. I've never felt a punch like this.”The 25-year-old from Naples continued, “I didn’t give up, but the pain from the punch was too much, so I decided to end it. I’m leaving with my head held high. After the second punch, the pain in my nose was so strong that I couldn’t continue. It was better to stop.”Carini expressed her frustration, saying, “I am devastated because I’ve always been taught to be a warrior, to represent my country with honour and loyalty. This time, I just couldn’t continue. It wasn’t about who was in front of me; I simply wanted to fight and win.”When asked if it would have been better to withdraw before the fight, Carini said, “I’m not someone who gives up easily. Even if they had told me not to fight, I wouldn’t have accepted it. I have a warrior's mentality, but this time, the pain was too much. I had to say enough.”She added, “It’s not a defeat for me. Stepping into the ring is already a victory. I’m not here to judge whether it’s fair or not. I did my job and left with my dignity intact. I was convinced I would win, but those punches to the nose were too painful, and I had to stop.”In March 2023, Khelif was disqualified just before her gold medal match at the 2023 IBA Women's World Boxing Championships for failing to meet eligibility criteria. The Algerian Olympic Committee stated that the disqualification was due to medical reasons. It was later revealed that this was related to high testosterone levels. This led to false rumors suggesting that Khelif is transgender or transsexual, despite the fact that she is a biological woman.In Algeria, who Khelif represents, transgender identity is prohibited, and legal or medical transitions are not permitted. Khelif initially appealed the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport but eventually withdrew her appeal, making the IBA's decision final. In 2024, the IBA clarified that Khelif, and others had not undergone a testosterone examination but a different, recognized test, the details of which remain confidential.The International Boxing Association (IBA) noted that Khelif had initially appealed their decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport but withdrew the appeal, making the IBA's decision legally binding. Lin did not challenge the ruling.On Thursday, IOC spokesman Mark Adams addressed the controversy, stating, “All competitors comply with the eligibility rules. But it's important to remember that this involves real people, and this is not a transgender issue.” Concerns have been raised within the boxing and wider sporting community. Australia’s boxing captain, Caitlin Parker, voiced her fears about one of her teammates competing in the same weight category as Khelif, calling the situation “incredibly dangerous.”","Elon Musk dared Kamala Harris to speak up on the recent controversy where Italian boxer Angela Carini lost to Algerian fighter Imane Khelif who had failed a sex test last year.

NEW DELHI: Millions of Indian fans were left heartbroken when MS Dhoni was run out against New Zealand in the 2019 ODI World Cup semifinal at Old Trafford, Manchester on July 10.Chasing a 240-run target, India were 209/7 after 48 overs and had just lost Ravindra Jadeja who had played arguably his best ODI innings - a 59-ball 77-run knock that was studded with 4 sixes and 4 fours.Needing 31 runs off the last 12 balls, India still had the 'best finisher in the world' at the crease and still hopeful of victory.Lockie Ferguson bowled the penultimate over of the match and Dhoni hit the first ball of the over for a six over deep backward point. The second delivery was a got ball.It was the third ball of the over when hearts of millions of Indian fans skipped a beat as ironically, for a man who is so good between the wickets, was run out, in what turned to be his last ODI.Ferguson bowled a slower ball on a length and it popped up off the glove towards short fine leg as Dhoni got cramped on the pull.With Bhuvneshwar Kumar at the other end, Dhoni ran for two but there was a slight stutter on the second run and that cost Dhoni as he was just short of a direct hit at the keeper's end by Martin Guptill.Dhoni was run out after a 50-run knock that came off 72 balls and India lost the match by 18 runs and were eliminated from the World Cup.Now a video has surfaced online in which during an event, Dhoni is asked by a fan about that moment and how she dealt with it.Dhoni replies, ""It was a difficult one because I knew that this will be my last World Cup, so it would have been good to be on the winning side. It was heartbreak moment, so we accepted the result and we tried to move on.(It takes time and one gets some time after the World Cup. I haven't played any international after that, so I got a lot of time). So, yes, it was a heartbreak but at the same time you have to get out of it.

It is always nice to have problems like that while picking up the teams, so you know that there is quality in the squad. I look forward to these kind of problems till I am the captain,"" he said smilingly.Rohit emphasized that, regardless of who is selected, it's crucial for the player to express himself freely.The 37-year-old also mentioned that the management has already fostered a relaxed atmosphere in the dressing room, allowing players to focus on their game without any fear or hesitation.""The most important thing is to allow the freedom to players, so that they will be able to do that and it is our job to ensure that we create that environment.

We are here for three games, and the idea is to take something back from these three games, and learn how we want to play and what we want to achieve in ODI cricket.""Rohit did not focus excessively on the personality characteristics of Gambhir despite the latter's reputation for being a passionate individual.""Gauti bhai does a lot of fun things in the dressing room, cracks a lot of jokes. Otherwise, I don't think we should get into his personal space like whether he laughs or not. Everybody has their own way,"" he noted.Rohit emphasized that the team should be permitted to experience a few losses while striving to reach specific objectives.

You are still trying to do something different and you are not compromising on the standard.""We are a sports team, a cricket team, and we should also be allowed to lose while we are trying to do things differently,"" he elaborated.Rohit remained steadfast in his assertion that the team's focus would not shift from their objective of securing a victory in the ODI series against Sri Lanka.""We want to achieve something out of every series or game we play, but not at the cost of not showing intent or purpose. It (the series) is not a practice ground. It is an international game.""We want to play good cricket and achieve something out of this series. But sometimes, you have to understand that, when you want to play for the nation, the quality of cricket should remain the way it is.""","India captain Rohit Sharma has urged his team to focus on the challenges that lie ahead.

NEW DELHI: When India plays Sri Lanka in a three-match series starting in Colombo on Friday, the Gautam Gambhir-led Indian team management will have the chance to select between KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant as India's long-term first-choice wicketkeeper-batter in ODIs.After the recent T20 World Cup victory, there will also be a lot of excitement surrounding the first sighting of veterans Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , as per PTI.Gambhir will be monitoring Rohit and Kohli's performances, as he stated they will be crucial to the future.This will also be the pair's first ODI following that heartbreaking loss to Australia in the World Cup final in Ahmedabad last year, and they will be keen to celebrate the return of the 50-over format with a memorable match.In a season that features several major one-day events, such as the Champions Trophy, the think tank will attempt to block out that outside noise and concentrate on figuring out the combination.Given that, it is inevitable that this series would give special attention to the Rahul vs. Pant dispute.As the current wicketkeeper-batter, Rahul has been in that position since last year's Asia Cup, when he returned from a protracted injury layoff. Rahul was part of the previous team led by Rahul Dravid.Rahul has since carried out his responsibilities both in front of and behind the wicket with diligence.Rahul has amassed 834 runs at a magnificent average of 69.50 from 21 matches since the continental showpiece last year, including two hundreds. In addition, earlier this year Rahul led India against South Africa in the ODI series.The thirty-two-year-old has been a decent stumper as well.But now that Pant is back in the mix, would Gambhir go the same path?Although it has been nice to see Pant return to the Indian team for a string of Twenty20 Internationals following that terrible accident in 2022, his performances have not ignited the field.Over the past month or so, hopeful signs have appeared. Is that, however, sufficient to persuade the ruling class to select him over Rahul?Gambhir and captain Rohit will need to consider how to make room for Shreyas Iyer , another strong performer in the 50-over version, if they choose to pick both Rahul and Pant in the starting 11.Iyer scored 52 runs in his final ODI encounter in Johannesburg against South Africa. His 2023 record is equally remarkable, with 846 runs at an average of 53 in 20 matches, including three hundreds.Rahul, Pant, and Iyer may therefore share the two batting positions in a three-way tie because India will need to use five bowlers if all three are picked.India would not want to follow such strict route, especially because Hardik Pandya will miss this series due to personal matters.Therefore, India may wish to give Riyan Parag or Shivam Dube a run at No. 6.But giving Parag bowling responsibilities in the recently finished Twenty20 Internationals may have been a sign of things to come, as he may have a bigger part in the ODI series.The fact that Parag can switch between leg-spin and off-spin well also improves his chances, as the Impact Player rule prevented him from showing off this ability much in the IPL.However, the Assamese player has a very notable body of work in the Deodhar Trophy, the domestic 50-over competition.With a respectable economy of 4.8, he finished sixth last season with 11 wickets, behind Vidwath Kaverappa (13), Shams Mulani (12), Mayank Yadav (12), Shahbaz Ahmed (12), and R Sai Kishore (11).Dube, on the other hand, did not get called up to bowl in the series against Sri Lanka and only participated in one ODI appearance five years prior.Even though they had spells of domination in the T20I series, Sri Lanka, a team made up of both young and seasoned players, will want to prevent the batting collapse that ultimately proved to be their downfall.However, they will not have the services of pacers Matheesha Pathirana and Dilshan Madhushanka, who have been ruled out of the series with injuries.Rohit Sharma (C), Shubman Gill (VC), Virat Kohli, KL Rahul (WK), Rishabh Pant (WK), Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohd. Siraj, Washington Sundar, Arshdeep Singh, Riyan Parag, Axar Patel, Khaleel Ahmed, Harshit RanaCharith Asalanka (C), Pathum Nissanka, Avishka Fernando, Kusal Mendis, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Kamindu Mendis, Janith Liyanage, Nishan Madushka, Wanindu Hasaranga, Dunith Wellalage, Chamika Karunaratne, Maheesh Theekshana, Akila Dananjaya, Ehsan Malinga, Mohammed Shiraz, Asitha Fernando",India play Sri Lanka in a three-match ODI series starting in Colombo on Friday.

Sharma's partnership with head coach Rahul Dravid has been instrumental in this transformative journey.Sharma's exceptional captaincy extends to the Indian Premier League , where he has led the Mumbai Indians to an impressive five titles since 2013. While comparisons have been drawn between Sharma and MS Dhoni , Sharma has carved out his own unique legacy.""As a tactician, let's not forget that he's been an outstanding guy. He'll go down as one of the best captains ever alongside Dhoni. If you ask me who's better, I'd say both are on par when it comes to tactics in the white-ball game. I can't pay a bigger compliment to Rohit than that because you know what MS has done and the titles he has won,"" Shastri said on the ICC Review.Shastri specifically praised Sharma's performance during the 2024 T20 World Cup, commending his composure and strategic decision-making throughout the final against South Africa.""Rohit is not far behind and I thought tactically he was just outstanding in this year's (T20) World Cup. Just the calmness, the ability to get a (Jasprit) Bumrah or a (Hardik) Pandya, or even an Axar Patel at just the right time when needed was great to see,"" he added.Sharma's leadership played a crucial role in India's impressive comeback during the final, showcasing his ability to handle pressure and make important decisions.

NEW DELHI: In a startling incident that has reignited discussions on safety protocols in cricket , an on-field umpire was struck on the leg by a flying bat during a player’s celebratory outburst.The video of the incident has gone viral, drawing attention to the potential hazards faced by umpires.The incident occurred during a recent match when a batter, exuberant after hitting the winning six, threw his bat into the air as part of his celebration.The umpire, positioned at the opposite end of the pitch, was preparing to signal the six when the bat landed on his leg, causing visible discomfort. The batter’s celebration had commenced even before the umpire could complete the traditional signal for a six.Cricket, like many sports, involves inherent risks of physical injury, leading players to don extensive protective gear. Batters wear helmets, pads, gloves, arm guards, and thigh pads, while wicket-keepers use gloves to handle high-speed balls. Umpires, too, have begun adopting protective measures, a practice popularized by Australian umpire Bruce Oxenford .Oxenford designed an innovative arm guard, shaped like a lollipop, to shield his left arm. First introduced during a 2015 World T20 warm-up match and later seen in the IPL , the device features a black arm attachment and a transparent protective shield. Despite its utility for Oxenford, the contraption hasn’t gained widespread acceptance among other umpires. Some, like fellow Australian John Ward, prefer using conventional helmets for protection.However, incidents like the recent flying bat highlight the unpredictable dangers in cricket, suggesting that current safety measures may not be comprehensive enough. The unexpected nature of such accidents emphasizes the need for ongoing evaluation and enhancement of safety protocols for umpires.","Incident occurred during a recent match when a batter, exuberant after hitting the winning six, threw his bat into the air as part of his celebration.

Will support national team by developing players at Inter Kashi: Habas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/will-support-national-team-by-developing-players-at-inter-kashi-habas/articleshow/112029904.cms,"Last season, Habas guided Mohun Bagan Super Giant to the ISL Shield triumph

Panaji:

Antonio Lopez Habas was close to becoming the national team coach until he was pipped at the post by FC Goa ’s Manolo Marquez , who will now do a dual job of coaching club and country.Habas remains the most successful coach in the Indian Super League (ISL), the top-tier league in the country, and believed he had more than a decent chance of stepping into the boots of Igor Stimac, sacked last month for his failure to steer India to the third round of the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifiers.“I think I deserved the nomination (to coach the national team),” Habas told TOI after completing a surprise move to Inter Kashi in the I-League , Indian football’s second tier, on Thursday. “We won three (ISL) titles, played four finals and six semifinals. Within football (fraternity), I feel like another Indian. I have coached many players of the national team. I was not chosen, and I accept it. I will support the national team by developing players at Inter Kashi. It’s what I have done until now, and what I will continue to do.”Last season, Habas guided Mohun Bagan Super Giant to the ISL Shield triumph. But while title victories normally assure coaches of a contract extension, the experienced Spaniard was not considered, reportedly due to concerns over his health. Even while selecting the national coach, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) executive committee members made a mention of the 67-year-old’s age and health.Habas though said he has the same “strength and enthusiasm” as when he first arrived in India to take charge of Atletico de Kolkata and won the maiden ISL trophy in 2014.“I am very disappointed and saddened by the treatment that some journalists and others have given me, speaking about my health problems. Someone did it to justify my departure from Mohun Bagan, and at the same time, prevent me from training the national team. My medical tests are currently perfect,” said Habas.The serial trophy winner has won the ISL twice with ATK (2014, 2019-20) and the ISL Winner’s Shield with Mohun Bagan last season. Now, his focus is on ensuring that Inter Kashi – started last season – win the I-League and move to the ISL.Explaining his decision to take over Inter Kashi, Habas said the club’s “proposal is attractive, serious and ambitious.”“It offers me guarantees and seriousness to develop my work,” he said. “At the same time, it is a great responsibility to be able to have a great impact sportingly in such an important and fascinating region of India as Uttar Pradesh.”Besides winning trophies in India, Habas had a stint as Bolivia’s head coach and finished runner-up in the 1997 Copa America.Inter Kashi said Habas will spearhead a long-term project aimed at creating a sustainable football ecosystem in Uttar Pradesh. “This initiative will focus on the promotion of Inter Kashi to the ISL, ensuring the club competes at the highest level of Indian football.“Habas will also help Inter Kashi devise a concrete player pathway to Europe, collaborating with Inter Escaldes to establish a pathway for Indian players to gain opportunities in Andorra, providing them with invaluable international exposure and experience,” the club said in a statement on Thursday.","Antonio Lopez Habas was close to becoming the national team coach until he was pipped at the post by FC Goa’s Manolo Marquez.

However, Anees noted that the transfer window has seen seven of their players move to ISL clubs, presenting both a setback and an opportunity for other players to step up and fill the void.""Since the transfer window began, seven of our players have moved into ISL clubs. So we had a lot of players getting transferred to other clubs. It's a setback for us and a bit difficult for us to have the same quality of players to compete at the higher levels.
