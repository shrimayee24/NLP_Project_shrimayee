Country’s first blind Army officer in active service shoots to national award,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/countrys-first-blind-army-officer-in-active-service-shoots-to-national-award/articleshow/125755670.cms,"President Droupadi Murmu presents Lt Col C Dwarakesh with the National Award for Persons with Disabilities on Wednesday





PUNE: A basketball match at a military station in 2014 was one of the last things Lt Col C Dwarakesh saw before an accident left him blind. He would spend the next eight months in hospital, healing and adjusting to life without eyesight while his mind envisioned new possibilities.On Wednesday, President Droupadi Murmu presented the 36-year-old with the National Award for Persons with Disabilities, recognising an Army career that even disability couldn’t cut short, and one that now includes a world record in para shooting.Lt Col Dwarakesh is the first officer of the Indian armed forces to continue in active service despite total blindness. It’s an achievement made possible by the derring-do of a young officer who never gave up on himself despite no precedent.“As an Army officer, I was trained to have conviction, courage, willpower and tenacity. But blindness is an impediment I couldn’t have prepared for,” Lt Col Dwarakesh told TOI from Delhi. “I overcame this hurdle through academics and technology, clearing multiple competitive exams along the way. I now research para sports, especially for people living with blindness. I converted my disability into a power and found ways to express the way those with vision do.This mindset has helped me reach new heights.”Supported by AI tools and assistive technology, Dwarakesh performs his responsibilities with the same proficiency and precision as his colleagues. In paralympic sports, he is a national champion in swimming and shooting, ranked world No. 3 in the 10m air rifle event. His most recent achievement was a world record score of 624.6 at the Shooting World Cup in the UAE this Oct. As part of the Indian para shooting team, he trains at Army Marksmanship Unit in Mahou.Dwarakesh, who joined the Army in 2009, terms the national award a “full-circle moment”. “I remember being granted commission by the President,” he said. “And to be receiving an award from the President 16 years later for something that redefined me, that’s quite something.”The officer, a native of TN, has also qualified for the UGC NET, making him one of the few visually impaired academicians in management, human resources, labour law, and sports research.","Lt Col C Dwarakesh is the first officer of the Indian armed forces to continue in active service despite total blindness.

Smriti Mandhana & Palash Muchhal Add Evil Eye Emoji To Bios Amid Cheating Rumours!

NEW DELHI: Indian cricket star Smriti Mandhana and music composer Palash Muchhal continue to dominate headlines, not for their professional achievements but for the emotional rollercoaster surrounding their postponed wedding. The high-profile ceremony, originally scheduled for November 23 in Sangli, was abruptly halted after Smriti’s father, Srinivas Mandhana, suffered a sudden medical emergency and was rushed to hospital. Hours later, Palash too was admitted due to stress-induced health concerns. Both have since recovered, but the families have not announced a new date.On Tuesday, social media went into overdrive after rumours claimed that the couple would now marry on December 7, prompting widespread speculation. However, Smriti’s brother Shravan Mandhana has now firmly shut down the reports.Speaking to Hindustan Times, Shravan addressed the swirling chatter head-on. “I have no idea about these rumours. As of now, it (the wedding) is still postponed,” he said, dismissing the December 7 claims and making it clear that no fresh date has been finalised.The rumour mill intensified after fans noticed that Smriti had deleted all wedding-related posts from her Instagram account following the postponement — though casual photos with Palash remain.With no official communication from either family, the speculative frenzy only grew.Meanwhile, Palash’s mother Amita Muchhal had earlier shared that both families are still recovering from the emotional shock of the disrupted ceremony. She revealed that Palash had dreamt of bringing his bride home and that she had even planned a special welcome. Despite the heartbreak, she expressed optimism: “Everything will be fine, shaadi bohot jaldi hogi.”The situation has also drawn heartfelt support from the cricketing community. Veteran actor Suniel Shetty lauded Jemimah Rodrigues for withdrawing from the WBBL to stand by Smriti, calling it “the purest form of friendship.”","Smriti Mandhana and Palash Muchhal's wedding was postponed on November 23.

Still have doubts? Virat Kohli blows World Cup trumpet with another masterclass

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma appeared unfazed by the growing chatter around their futures, focusing instead on a demanding net session under the floodlights ahead of India’s second ODI against South Africa on Wednesday.Speculation has intensified over what lies ahead for the senior duo, especially with the road to the ICC ODI World Cup 2027 now part of the discussion.But fresh off back-to-back match-winning performances against Australia and South Africa, neither Kohli nor Rohit showed any signs of easing up during training on Tuesday.Kohli looked sharp and assertive, taking on throw-down experts Raghu (right-arm) and Nuwan Seneviratne (left-arm), who pushed the pace throughout the session. The battle was compelling to watch — Kohli found the middle of the bat repeatedly, though there were moments when Raghu’s extra pace beat him.Head coach Gautam Gambhir stood positioned between the two nets, observing the session closely.When Kohli wrapped up his batting, he rested both bats on his shoulders and walked past Gambhir without exchanging a word — a moment that would not go unnoticed considering the recent narrative surrounding Indian cricket.Rohit, who followed Kohli into the nets and then toward the dressing room shortly after, did pause briefly for a conversation with Gambhir before heading inside.While all eyes naturally gravitated toward the two senior players, training intensity remained high across the nets as India look to clinch the series after taking a 1-0 lead with Sunday's win in Ranchi.With the match to be played on a black-soil surface at the Shaheed Veer Narayan Singh Stadium, the batting group trained with intent, showcasing aggression from the outset.Yashasvi Jaiswal sent multiple deliveries soaring over the leg side boundary, and even rolled his arm over to bowl to Rishabh Pant — the last batter to take his turn in the nets.The second ODI is scheduled for Wednesday, 3 October. India will be hoping to win and seal the three-match series after taking the opening game.

This winter, Kamla is running again – but with a rope in her hand, digging her heels in the red soil as she practises the tug-of-war. Kamla, who laid down arms recently, will participate in the final round of Bastar Olympics, scheduled for later this month. “I surrendered this year. Now, every pull on this rope feels like I am pulling my life onto the other side,” she said.Podiyam Bhima, also known as Lokesh, was with the Maoist movement until early this year. He had heard that many of the surrendered Maoists were participating in the Bastar Olympics. “I used to think that one day when I surrender, I would take part too. Bastar Olympics was one of the big attractions for me in deciding to lay down arms,” Bhima said.Today he is training for the archery event. This is the second year of Bastar Olympics, having over three lakh registered participants ranging from block to district and divisional level across the seven districts of Bastar.Union home minister Amit Shah, who had attended last year’s event, will participate on the final day this year on Dec 13, coming close on the heels of his ministry’s call to end Maoist extremism in India by March 31, 2026.At a recent event in New Delhi, PM Narendra Modi cited the Bastar Olympics as a marker of change. He recalled a time when even journalists needed multiple permissions to enter Bastar. “Last year, about 300 surrendered cadres took part. This time, more than 500 rehabilitated ex-Maoists and over 600 participants under the Nuva Baat identity are in the fray, alongside Naxal-affected players with disabilities,” Chhattisgarh deputy CM Arun Sao said.Over 10,000 block-level winners have moved up to district events, and 3,000-3,500 athletes will now compete at the divisional and final stage in Jagdalpur from Dec 11 to 13. Players from all seven districts — Bastar, Kanker, Kondagaon, Bijapur, Dantewada, Sukma and Narayanpur — are competing in 11 disciplines: athletics, archery, kabaddi, kho-kho, football, hockey, badminton, volleyball, karate, weightlifting and tug-of-war.","This is the second year of Bastar Olympics, having over three lakh registered participants.

What is Liam Gleason’s cause of death?



Liam Gleason’s lacrosse legacy



Siena University confirmed the death of men’s lacrosse coach Liam Gleason, who passed away at 41 after suffering a severe head injury in an accident at his home. The incident happened Sunday afternoon, and he died Wednesday surrounded by family, players, and members of the Capital Region lacrosse community. His death closes a remarkable chapter for a coach who guided Siena back to championship form and built deep ties within the sport.Gleason had led the Saints for seven seasons and delivered a MAAC title in May, the program’s first in more than a decade. His life in lacrosse stretched from Long Island to Albany, and he remained a respected figure on and off the field. His passing leaves a significant void for the program, his players, and the wider community he shaped for nearly two decades.Siena University announced that Liam Gleason died from injuries he sustained after falling down the stairs at his home. Reports noted that he suffered a traumatic brain injury and was transported to Albany Medical Center after first responders administered CPR at the scene. The school later confirmed his death, and an “honor walk” was held in the hospital as Gleason, an organ donor, was taken to surgery.“A sudden, senseless loss carries a kind of pain that defies understanding,” Siena president Chuck Seifert said.“It’s hard to imagine anyone more universally loved and admired than Liam. Our community was blessed by Coach Gleason’s life.” The scene at the hospital illustrated that impact, with players in uniform, school staff, and members of the University at Albany athletic community lining the hallway to pay tribute.A public funeral service is scheduled for Saturday at 11 a.m. at the UHY Center on Siena’s campus. Gleason is survived by his wife, Jaclyn, and their three children, Kennedy, Penn, and Tate.Gleason’s connection to lacrosse began on Long Island before he played at Adelphi and later transferred to the University at Albany, helping the Great Danes reach the NCAA quarterfinals in 2007. His coaching career started at Siena in 2008 as a defensive coordinator, and he later worked at The College of Saint Rose before returning to Albany as an assistant coach.He became Siena’s head coach in 2018 and spent seven seasons building a competitive program rooted in discipline and community values. The Albany men’s lacrosse team said, “From a standout student-athlete to a dedicated member of the coaching staff, Liam poured his heart into the Capital Region lacrosse community and left an indelible mark on everyone he met.”Former high school coach Tom Rotanz remembered him as a “gentle giant” and wrote, “Not surprising that Liam is leading today’s ‘Hero’s Walk.’ That is who he was. Liam is my hero.” The university mourns Gleason’s untimely demise.Also Read: What is Tiger Woods' net worth in 2025?

Joe Burrow reacts to Lane Kiffin hire



LSU’s decision to hire Lane Kiffin has stirred a wave of reactions across the college football world, but few were more talked about than what came from Joe Burrow . The Cincinnati Bengals quarterback still carries the glow of LSU’s 2019 title run. His history with the school keeps fans looking toward him whenever big changes happen in Baton Rouge. This time was no different. When asked about the Tigers bringing in Kiffin, Burrow kept his response short, and it added a layer of intrigue to an already dramatic coaching move.Kiffin arrives at LSU with a strong record, leaving behind an Ole Miss team positioned for a playoff run. His departure created a storm, not just in Oxford but across the SEC. With LSU searching for a path back to national prominence after seasons of inconsistency, the hire marks a bold attempt to revive its championship identity. Burrow understands how difficult that climb can be, yet he avoided making any bold declarations about the move.At his weekly press conference, Burrow was asked about LSU’s decision. His words were brief but revealing. He said, “I think he’s a good coach. I guess we’ll see how it goes.Those are my thoughts.” The pause before he spoke circulated widely online, sparking speculation about what he truly felt. With the Bengals fighting to keep their season alive, he kept his focus on the NFL, but his measured tone showed the weight of the situation.Kiffin also addressed his exit from Ole Miss. He said, “After a lot of prayer and time spent with family, I made the difficult decision to accept the head coaching position at LSU.” He added that he wanted to finish Ole Miss’ playoff run but was denied the chance, explaining, “My request to do so was denied by Keith Carer despite the team also asking him to allow me to keep coaching them so they could better maintain their high level of performance. ” He closed that chapter by saying, “Unfortunately, that means Friday’s Egg Bowl was my last game coaching the Rebels.”LSU hopes Kiffin can restore the powerhouse atmosphere that defined Burrow’s championship season. With elite recruiting, proven success and a hungry fan base, the pressure is already intense. Whether Kiffin meets that standard will shape LSU’s future, and Burrow, from a distance, will watch like everyone else as the next era begins.Also Read: Travis Kelce’s unfiltered comments about Taylor Swift during their European vacation intensify speculation about their future","Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow was asked about Lane Kiffin joining LSU.

Who Wins the Trade?

Theare exploring a budget-conscious path to reinforce their rotation, withemerging as a leading trade target. The move gains relevance as Framber Valdez approaches his 2025 free agency and Houston continues searching for reliable innings behind Hunter Brown. The scenario, outlined by Bleacher Report’s Joel Reuter, frames a simple prospect-for-pitcher swap that fits both teams’ short-term and long-term goals. As Reuter notes, “the Astros could move No. 2 prospect Jacob Melton for a cost-effective mid-rotation arm like Singer.”The mechanics are straightforward: Houston acquires RHP Brady Singer, while Cincinnati receives OF Jacob Melton, Houston’s No. 2 prospect. Singer, now 29 and entering his final arbitration year at an estimated $12-14 million, has become a popular trade-chip candidate after being acquired by the Reds last offseason in the Jonathan India and Joey Wiemer package.Melton offers Cincinnati an intriguing long-term play. The 25-year-old speedster debuted in 2025 but struggled during his short MLB stay, posting a .157 average across 70 at-bats. His run tool and outfield range, however, remain standout attributes within scouting circles.Brady Singer’s profile checks every box for the Houston Astros. He threw 169.2 innings in 2025 while posting a 14-12 record and a 4.03 ERA across 32 starts. In a rotation disrupted by injuries throughout the season, his consistent workload becomes a significant selling point. His 3.1 WAR, 19 home runs allowed, and 1.24 WHIP reflect solid middle-rotation capabilities, while his career home ERA below 3.80 adds further comfort.• Stability behind Hunter Brown• An innings-eater who reduces bullpen strain• Affordable rotation depth with 2026 control• A practical hedge against losing ValdezCincinnati Reds benefit by flipping a near-expiring asset for a high-upside young outfielder. Melton’s 60-grade speed, defensive coverage, and flashes of power (10 Double-A homers) provide long-term value without inflating payroll. The Reds also regain prospect capital after last year’s India trade and avoid losing Singer for nothing should extension talks stall.Melton’s 2025 numbers reflect inexperience more than lack of potential.• Reliable mid-rotation arm at a manageable cost• Helps fill the innings gap created by injuries• Fits into a contending window without major financial impact• Adds a top Astros prospect with elite athleticism• Maximizes return on Singer before free agency• Builds depth in an outfield group that can develop at its own pace• Singer’s 4.03 ERA could inflate in Minute Maid Park• Limited long-term upside with no guarantee of an extension• Losing a top prospect could thin an already shallow farm system• Melton’s bat is still raw at the MLB level• Delayed impact if development stalls• Relies heavily on projection rather than proven productionHouston stands to benefit more immediately. Singer perfectly addresses the Astros’ need for durability without requiring a major financial commitment. For a team aiming to maintain postseason relevance, swapping Melton for a dependable starter fits their timeline.Cincinnati still comes out well, securing a high-upside athlete who strengthens their long-term core and complements their recent roster rework. If Melton’s tools translate at the MLB level, the Reds could later be seen as the bigger winners.Also read: Kyle Tucker spotted in Dunedin: Are the Toronto Blue Jays closing in on MLB’s biggest free-agent prize after massive $210 million Dylan Cease deal? With the Winter Meetings approaching, this deal has the ingredients to heat up quickly. Singer’s affordability, Melton’s upside, and both teams’ roster motivations align neatly, making this one of the offseason’s more logical trade paths. Should Houston pull the trigger, it would signal a decisive push to stabilize their rotation ahead of Valdez’s uncertain future.","The Houston Astros are exploring a budget-conscious path to reinforce their rotation.

NEW DELHI: India pacer Prasidh Krishna faced heavy backlash on social media after India slipped to a four-wicket loss against South Africa in the second ODI in Raipur on Wednesday.The pacer endured a forgettable evening, returning figures of 8.2-0-85-2, finishing with an economy rate of more than 10 runs an over.His struggles with line and length during crucial phases of the chase opened the floodgates for South Africa, who hunted down a stiff target of 359 with surprising comfort.Fans online did not hold back, with many mocking the right-arm quick for his expensive outing.One user wrote, ""If Pakistan has Haris Rauf, then India has Prasidh Krishna, both are Run-machines.""Another demanded a change in India’s pace attack, saying, ""It's high time the Indian team should drop Prasidh Krishna and bring back Siraj.""A third fan went even further, claiming, ""I will choose 50 year old Mohammed Shami over any version of Prasidh Krishna in any formats.""Another quipped, ""Prasidh krishna is man of the match.

Why Cincinnati Makes Sense for Buxton

Astros’ Motive: Rotation Stability

Twins’ Return: Prospects to Support a Transition

Why the Deal Still Feels Unlikely

The Cincinnati Reds may be approaching the offseason with several areas to evaluate, but one need sits clearly above the rest: adding more power to a lineup that struggled to produce consistent thump. A new trade concept from MLB.com’s Anthony Castrovince puts forward a dramatic solution - one that involves making a push for Minnesota Twins star Byron Buxton through a multi-team blockbuster. It’s an idea built around the Reds’ pitching depth and the possibility of acquiring a dynamic, game-changing outfielder without diving into the expensive end of free agency.But the proposal isn’t limited to a simple two-team exchange. Castrovince outlines a three-team structure involving the Reds, Twins, and Houston Astros, each addressing a different roster priority. For Cincinnati, it’s about landing a high-impact bat. For Houston, it’s securing a mid-rotation arm. And for Minnesota, it’s about collecting a group of prospects to support their transition. The concept may be unlikely to materialize, yet it brings together several logical elements that make it worth exploring.Castrovince’s concept revolves around the Reds leveraging their pitching depth, the Astros reinforcing their rotation, and the Twins securing a wave of prospects.Here is how the deal would look based on the proposal:Buxton, who has spent his entire career with Minnesota, is seen as an ideal fit for a Reds club that has been searching for a dynamic bat. As Castrovince wrote, “Buxton would be perfect for a Reds team that could use its pitching depth to address a lineup in need.”One of the major selling points is Buxton’s contract. He is owed roughly $15 million annually for the next three seasons, a number that sits well below what top free-agent hitters will command on the open market. That affordability naturally increases his appeal across the league, though Buxton previously declared himself “a Minnesota Twin for life,” a statement that could complicate any trade discussions.Houston’s inclusion centers on adding right-hander Brady Singer, who is entering his final year of arbitration. The Astros are facing the likely departure of Framber Valdez in free agency, leaving a gap in the middle of their rotation. Singer fits both their competitive timeline and their payroll.Castrovince noted, “Singer, who is entering his final year of arbitration, does not fit a Twins team in transition but does fit an Astros team that needs an affordable mid-rotation arm.” (H/t: Sporting News)Minnesota’s role in the deal is centered on long-term roster building. The Twins would receive four prospects, two from Cincinnati and two from Houston: Tyson Lewis, Mason Neville, Walker Janek, and Cole Hrtzler. The organization is navigating a transitional phase, and a multi-prospect return aligns with their broader strategy.Even with the pieces seemingly aligned, the proposal faces a major hurdle - Buxton’s ability to veto a trade. His long-standing connection to the Twins organization and his recent comments make any potential move difficult to finalize.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Yankees could bag $30 million Milwaukee Brewers 2x All-Star to improve title odds ahead of deadline Castrovince admitted that this is likely a trade that never happens, though he added that the framework hits several logical points for all involved clubs.

Tyson Foerster's upper-body injury update affects Philadelphia Flyers' season outlook



The Philadelphia Flyers are facing a crucial early-season test after news broke. About that Tyson Foerster will be unavailable for a prolonged period. The young forward has been one of the brightest offensive sparks on the roster. And losing him mid-season threatens to disrupt the momentum Philadelphia has carefully built so far.This development arrives at a delicate point in the schedule. Along with the Flyers grinding through a demanding stretch of NHL matchups. As part of the latest NHL news roundup, the injury has quickly become a focal point among league observers, with questions emerging about scoring depth, line combinations, and how the Flyers respond without one of their most reliable goal producers.According to the team, Foerster is expected to miss approximately two to three months after suffering an undisclosed upper-body injury. At just 23 years old, he had emerged as the Flyers’ leading goal scorer, posting 10 goals in 21 games. Skating regularly on a top line alongside Noah Cates and Travis Konecny, Foerster played a major role in driving five-on-five offense and providing timely scoring.The timing of this injury could not be more challenging. The Philadelphia Flyers currently sit just above the playoff cutoff.That too, in the Eastern Conference. With a record that keeps them barely inside the Wild Card conversation. Every lineup change now carries added weight. Removing a top scorer forces the coaching staff. In order to reshuffle lines and lean heavier on secondary contributors.From an NHL injury updates perspective, this absence places added pressure on Philadelphia’s middle-six forwards to elevate their scoring output.Ultimately, how Philadelphia responds over the next several weeks may define whether this injury becomes a temporary hurdle; or the start of a difficult slide in an unforgiving conference.Also Read: NHL Update: Brad Marchand and his family hosts Thanksgiving to comfort teammates missing home","Tyson Foerster is expected to miss approximately two to three months after suffering an undisclosed upper-body injury.

Inside Elden Campbell’s illustrious career and glorifying legacy

Elden Campbell' journey peaked in 1997 and later shaped Detroit’s 2004 title run

The Los Angeles Lakers have suffered an untimely death of another family member. Elden Campbell, the former center of the Los Angeles Lakers who was part of the NBA championship winning team of the Detroit Pistons in 2004, passed away at the age of 57.The ex-Lakers (1990-1999), Hornets, Pistons, Nets, and Pistons player was found dead due to unknown reasons. Elden Campbell, who took home over $69 million in his 15-year NBA journey, had a scoring average of 10.3 points and 5.9 rebounds. Moreover, he was also worth $20 million. Throughout his NBA career, Elden's salary alone was about $70 million.Elden Campbell, who played in the NBA for 15 seasons, from 1990 to 2005, was always a reliable and constant figure. He was a power forward and center, and his versatility, together with his defensive skills, shot-blocking, and scoring, allowed him to build a successful and long-term career with various teams, particularly with the Lakers, where he was the main man for most of his prime.Though never selected as an All-Star, Campbell played the “go-to guy” role in different teams and even took the ring home with the Pistons in 2004.The mix of his big body, great skills, and lots of experience counted a lot and thus his long stay in the league was made possible.The Lakers of Los Angeles picked Campbell as the 27th pick during the 1990 NBA Draft. In the beginning of his career, he was a backup for famous big guys like Vlade Divac and Sam Perkins, but slowly he got more playing time because of his fame as a shot-blocker and rebounder.Elden Campbell scored an average of 14.9 points per match for the Lakers in the season of 1996-97, while he was playing with two other stars, Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. The peak of Campbell's career was the time he spent with the Charlotte Hornets, where he posted averages of 15.3 points and 9.4 rebounds.Elden Campbell had only earned $69 million during his 15 years in the NBA. He had an average of 10.3 points and 5.9 rebounds.The best times of Campbell's career with the Lakers were in the 1990s middle to end. He was in the 1996-97 season already a steady starter and one of the most productive players in the interior of the team. His scoring and rebounding numbers were the highest in his career during the 1996-97 campaign.However, the arrival of Shaquille O'Neal in 1996 reduced Campbell's role, and he was finally traded to the Charlotte Hornets in 1999. After the Hornets moved to New Orleans in 2002 he was with the new New Orleans Hornets only a short time before getting traded to the Seattle SuperSonics. Campbell's life as a player took a major shift when in 2003 he inked a deal with the Detroit Pistons.He was a key backup player in Detroit's 2004 championship run, helping the Pistons overcome the strongly favored Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals. Following his championship win, Campbell briefly played for the New Jersey Nets then returned to the Pistons before retiring in 2005.Elden Campbell, an NBA champion with the Detroit Pistons, was involved in the mother of all basketball battles.

The impact of Daniel Jones’ fractured Fibula on the Colts’ offense



Daniel Jones Broke His Fibula and Wants to Play Through the Pain - Doctor Explains

What the Colts must do to stay competitive moving forward



The Indianapolis Colts entered the 2025 NFL season with high expectations, quickly rising to the top of their division standings. However, recent developments have slowed their momentum, as the team now sits in second place. Quarterback Daniel Jones ’ fractured fibula has emerged as a key factor affecting the Colts’ offensive efficiency and overall performance.While Jones remains active on the field, the injury has clearly limited his mobility, raising concerns about how sustainable the Colts’ early-season success will be. With Anthony Richardson on Injured Reserve, Indianapolis’ depth at quarterback is limited, leaving Jones as the primary option despite his compromised condition.According to ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler, Jones can technically play through the fractured fibula, but his movement appears restricted. “He’s clearly not 100 percent, and coaches who have prepared for the Colts or watched them closely say that his mobility appears compromised,” Fowler reported. Limited mobility affects a quarterback’s ability to escape pressure, execute designed runs, and maintain timing with receivers—all critical for maintaining an effective offense.During Indianapolis’ recent loss to the Houston Texans, Jones connected on several downfield throws when the pocket remained clean, demonstrating flashes of his skill. However, ESPN analyst Dan Graziano highlighted that the missing mobility made the offense appear constrained, reducing options and forcing the Colts to rely more heavily on short, safe passes. While injuries alone do not explain the Colts’ drop to second place, Jones’ health has been a central component in their performance challenges this season.With rookie Riley Leonard as the backup, the Colts’ options are limited. Indianapolis will need to maximize Jones’ contributions while minimizing risk, a balancing act that will be critical over the next stretch of games. How the coaching staff adjusts the offensive game plan around his limitations could determine whether the Colts reclaim the top spot in their division or face continued difficulties.Jones’ ability to perform under these conditions will remain a focal point for analysts and insiders, as the Colts navigate the rest of the 2025 season. The team’s success will depend on protecting their starting quarterback while maintaining offensive productivity, a challenge that could define Indianapolis’ season outcome.Also Read: Molly Qerim speaks out after shocking First Take exit, stands firmly by friend facing serious legal trouble","The Indianapolis Colts entered the 2025 NFL season with high expectations, quickly rising to the top of their division standings.

finally coming back?

Why Jayden Daniels’ possible Week 14 return has the NFL watching closely



actual

If there’s one question hovering over the NFL this week like a stubborn cloud, it’s this:Commanders fans have been refreshing their timelines nonstop, waiting for any tiny hint about their rookie star’s Week 14 status. His elbow injury shook the team’s momentum, and the vibes haven’t felt the same since he went down. Now, with the Vikings matchup days away, the suspense is very real and every update has turned this into one of the most-watched storylines of the week.Jayden Daniels’ availability for Week 14 all comes down to one thing: contact clearance. The rookie quarterback has been limited in practice but active enough to spark optimism. He’s reportedly gone through “functional contact drills,” the kind where you roll, dive, and take controlled hits without real defenders slamming into you. That’s encouraging but he still hasn’t been cleared forcontact against opponents, which is the one box the medical staff can’t skip.Washington coaches say they’ll decide on Friday, a classic “wait until the last second” move that shows how tight this call really is. Some insiders describe his chances as “realistic,” but still not guaranteed.Daniels dislocated his left elbow back in Week 9, a scary-looking injury that instantly raised questions about his season. Luckily, early reports confirmed he avoided ligament damage, meaning no surgery, no long-term reconstruction, and no season-ending label.But elbow injuries are weird. Even with good news, the recovery depends on strength, stability, and whether the player can absorb hits without flinching or risking re-injury. For a mobile quarterback like Daniels, who thrives on scrambling and taking off downfield, the elbow becomes even more crucial. This isn’t just about throwing, it’s about landing, bracing, and surviving chaotic plays.If Friday comes and the medical staff still isn’t sold, Washington will roll into Week 14 with Mariota again. That means another week of conservative play-calling, fewer big designed runs, and more emphasis on safe drives.It wouldn’t be ideal, but it’s better than throwing Daniels into chaos before his elbow is ready. A setback now could cost them far more than one game. Jayden Daniels may be inching toward a return, but Week 14 is still a tight race against time. The progress is real, the optimism is growing, and the practice participation is encouraging yet nothing is locked in until that final clearance lands.Also read - Justin Herbert injury update: Chargers QB listed day-to-day after hand surgery ahead of Eagles game","Jayden Daniels has been limited in practice but active enough to spark optimism.

Gilbert Arenas calls out Los Angeles Clippers for reportedly disrespecting legend Chris Paul

Lou Williams reveals why the Clippers parted ways with veteran Chris Paul

The NBA world was surprised when the Los Angeles Clippers abruptly parted ways with Chris Paul, sending the 40-year-old veteran home early this season. According to ESPN's Shams Charania, head coach Ty Lue and Paul were reportedly at odds for several weeks before Paul abruptly left the team on December 3.After the news broke, former NBA player Gilbert Arenas said that the Clippers should pack their bags and leave Los Angeles. He went on to say that he is upset with the organization for disrespecting Chris Paul by sending him home during his retired season.The Clippers parted ways with the 12-time NBA All-Star guard in the middle of the night, prompting Arenas to embark on a heated TikTok rant on Wednesday. He said:""Ooooooh, I done had it with the Clippers now.. Y'all gon' send the best Clipper y'all ever had home and not let him finish his last year?! Okay! We playin' games?! Take y'all a**es back home then! Go back to Buffalo! Yeah! We don't want you here!""Arenas continued:""Take y'all a**es back to Buffalo! We don't want you in Los Angeles! The only reason you have fans here is because you got 1980 s*x worker prices. We can take out the kids for $40!""For context, the Clippers were the Buffalo Braves in the 1970s. They relaunched as the San Diego Clippers in 1978, but then-owner Donald Sterling moved the team to Los Angeles in 1984.Meanwhile, the reason behind the rant was that the Clippers and Chris Paul have parted ways. Announcing the news, ESPN insider Shams Charania wrote on his X account:""Chris Paul and his leadership style clashed with the Clippers, sources tell ESPN. Paul has been vocal in holding management, coaches and players accountable, which the team felt became disruptive.Specifically: Ty Lue was not on speaking terms with Paul for several weeks.”Additionally, Clippers' president of basketball operations Lawrence Frank confirmed in a text message to ESPN Wednesday morning:""We are parting ways with Chris and he will no longer be with the team… Chris is a legendary Clipper who has had a historic career. I want to make one thing very clear. No one is blaming Chris for our underperformance. I accept responsibility for the record we have right now. There are a lot of reasons why we've struggled. We're grateful for the impact Chris has made on the franchise.""Former Paul's teammate Lou Williams provided insight into what may have prompted the decision. Williams stated that Paul's negative remarks about the Clippers' management office may have been the final straw in the team's decision to break up with him.This past offseason, Paul returned to the Clippers for what he eventually said would be his final NBA season before retiring. He posted on his Instagram Story that he was being sent home before the Clippers' road game against the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday.To move on from Paul, the Clippers would need to waive him and pay his $3.6 million contract, agree to a buyout, or transfer him after the December 15 no-trade deadline. Meanwhile, the Clippers are also is bad form.

Ortiz walks back her “woman hater” accusations after backlash intensifies

“weird”

“insane,”

“I love the FaZe guys, I didn’t say anything… I didn’t mean nothing.”





Wendy Ortiz is now walking back a major accusation she made during a heated livestream involving FaZe Clan member Stable Ronaldo and streamer Jasontheween. The controversy erupted after Ortiz, while defending fellow streamer Nina Lin, claimed that Ronaldo and Jason were, a statement that quickly spread across Twitch and social media. Fans of the FaZe star reacted strongly, and Ortiz soon found her comments resurfacing across Reddit’s LivestreamFail and X, fueling a wave of backlash against her.The feud traces back to criticism of Nina Lin over a recent Target livestream in which she was accused of shoplifting steak. On top of that, past controversies involving Lin, including damaging Ronaldo’s car during a stream and a disturbing allegation she reportedly downplayed, led to intense reactions from the streaming community. Ortiz, who appeared intoxicated at the time, dismissed the allegations and fired at Ronaldo and Jason instead, igniting the dispute further. What began as heated defense quickly turned into a larger community drama spotlighting accountability and online reputations.As the situation escalated, Stable Ronaldo publicly responded on stream, calling Ortiz’s claims false and damaging. He announced that he would no longer collaborate with her and encouraged other FaZe members to distance themselves to prevent further baseless accusations.

In viral snippets circulating online, she stated,Despite the apology, discussion around the incident continues to dominate community spaces, with creators like Asmongold openly criticizing Ortiz’s behavior and judgment. Fans have questioned why she continues to stand by Nina Lin despite the controversies surrounding her.While Ortiz has attempted to smooth things over, the fallout illustrates how quickly misstatements, especially made live on stream, can escalate into major conflicts. Her retraction may halt further damage with FaZe, but the drama leaves lingering questions about loyalty, accountability, and the pressure of public perception within the streaming world. Whether the relationships involved can fully recover remains uncertain, but this incident serves as a reminder, in livestreaming, every word can become a headline.Also Read: Twitch under fire as Asmongold demands Amazon intervention over Nina Lin controversy","Wendy Ortiz is walking back a major accusation she made during a heated livestream involving FaZe Clan member Stable Ronaldo and streamer Jasontheween.

Arvid Lindblad’s old exchange with Lando Norris comes true

Arvid Lindblad recalls meeting Lando Norris five years ago



Formula 2 champion Arvid Lindblad is all set to make his Formula 1 debut with Racing Bulls in 2026. The Indian-origin racer will also be the youngest F1 driver on the grid next season, as he joins Liam Lawson in the driver line-up. Lindblad has now shared a glimpse of his quick meet-and-greet with Lando Norris five years ago, and how their tiny, casual conversation ended up coming true. Norris is currently leading the championship, which will conclude this weekend in Abu Dhabi.Arvid Lindblad will not only be competing with Lando Norris but also with senior F1 drivers like Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton, who joined F1 even before Lindblad was born.A day after his F1 debut with Racing Bulls was confirmed, Lindblad shared a video from his brief meeting with Lando Norris, back when he was a fan and aspiring driver. In the video posted on his Instagram Stories, Lindblad tells Norris while shaking his hand — as the latter walks past surrounded by fans — “I want you to remember me. I'm going to see you in five years.” Norris responds, “Oh, that's nice to think of.”The video was originally posted by an Instagram page named Infour.A fan commented, “The fact he was spot on with the 5 years!! Kudos to him.” Another wrote, “Can’t wait to see this handshake again and Arvid saying, ‘I’m here 5 years later as promised!’” A fan called it “Manifestation at peak.”Arvid Lindblad had approached Lando Norris at an event after a friend challenged him, saying he didn’t have the guts to talk to the McLaren star. Recalling the incident, Lindblad told Motorsport, “I'd gotten a bit of inspiration from the Lewis Hamilton – Ron Dennis story, saying, ‘I'm going to drive one of your cars one day.’ I think he was a bit taken aback and said something like, ‘Oh, that's nice to think of.’ I'm sure there are lots of people who say those kinds of things, so it didn't really mean anything at the time. ”“But as I said, I had this belief that I would make it to F1. I had it when I said that to Lando, and I have that same belief today. It's a funny story to look back on because it has now become true. Five years later, it finally has,” he added.Arvid Lindblad is the son of a Swedish father and an Indian-origin mother. He became the youngest winner in Formula 2 history while racing for Campos Racing as part of the Red Bull Junior Team.Also Read: F1 2026: Isack Hadjar to partner Max Verstappen at Red Bull; Arvid Lindblad to debut with Racing Bulls","Formula 2 champion Arvid Lindblad will make his F1 debut with Racing Bulls in 2026.

When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows by Steven Pinker

Abundance by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson





Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close. Gates has recommended five books and he believes that all these titles spark curiosity and reflection during the quieter days of the winter season. “Each of these books pulls back the curtain on how something important really works: how people find purpose later in life, how we should think about climate change, how creative industries evolve, how humans communicate,” wrote Gates.In the blog post, Gates has also explained that holidays are the perfect tome to slow down and also catch up on reading. “There’s something about the quieter days around the holidays that makes it easier to sit down with a good book,” he wrote. His list on 2025 book recommendations reflects on his fascination with how the world works and how you can start a great conversation.The book belongs to the fiction genre and its a story of an aging janitor and a wise octopus captive hime with its empathy and storytelling. “Van Pelt's story made me think about the challenge of filling the days after you stop working—and what communities can do to help older people find purpose,” said Gates.The books explains about the climate challenges. The book structures 50 big questions on climate change, nuclear power and renewables. “ I’ve followed Hannah’s work at Our World in Data for years, and her new book is one of the clearest explanations of the climate challenge I’ve read. She’s realistic about the risks but grounded in data that shows real progress,” said Gates.It is a memoir which recounts the Diller’s extraordinary career in Hollywood, media, and technology, blending personal anecdotes with reflections on power, risk-taking, and the evolution of entertainment and digital industries. “He’s spent his life betting on ideas before they were obvious, and the industries he’s transformed show how much those bets can pay off,” said Gates.The book explains about the mysteries of human behaviour and how people communicate. “Although the topic itself is pretty complicated, the book is readable and practical, and it made me see everyday social interactions in a new light,” added Gate.The books offers a glimpse of at why America seems to struggle to build things and what it will take to fix that. The book argues that progress depends not just on good ideas but on the systems that help ideas spread.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close.

He shared this information right after the Dodgers advanced past the NLDS in 2025, and he reinforced it in several interviews, telling that he was aiming for just one more chance and explaining to Dodgers Nation that his loyalty to Los Angeles was worth more than any salary.At 36, after playing over 1,000 innings in 2025, he realized that the toughest part of the game is recognizing when your time is running out. What sets Rojas apart is that he decided to close that chapter on his own terms. He aimed to end his career where it all began, not as a declining player but as a purposeful leader. This honesty made his next move feel like a natural progression. When the Dodgers presented him with a one-year contract worth 5.5 million dollars on December 3, they weren't just bringing in a player for 2026. They were also gaining a mentor, a reliable defender, and a future asset for their development program.As we look forward, Rojas' comeback strengthens a team that's gunning for a three-peat. His stats from 2025, top-notch defense with a .983 fielding percentage and clutch hitting with 8 RBIs in the postseason show he can still make a difference in games. Beyond playing, his future role will help in developing players, using his experience from the Marlins where he guided prospects like Jazz Chisholm Jr.The agreement also highlights the Dodgers' player-friendly culture under president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman. By prioritizing Rojas' wishes, they foster loyalty in a star-driven market. According to the Los Angeles Times, ""Barely a month removed from Rojas' heroics in this year's World Series, he and the Dodgers agreed to a one-year, $5.5-million contract for next season.""Basically, it's a win-win situation: Rojas gets his fairy tale ending, and the Dodgers create a link between different eras. As baseball changes, moments like Rojas' ninth-inning miracle show us why veterans like him are still so important. With 2026 coming up, everyone will be watching to see if he can snag another ring for his collection before he hands over the baton.Also Read: Dylan Cease secures a seven-year $210 million contract from the Toronto Blue Jays",Miguel Rojas announced that the 2026 season will be his final one.

Leeds stun troubled Chelsea

Liverpool frustrated; Villa rise again

Arsenal tightened their grip at the top of the Premier League with a 2-0 win over Brentford on Wednesday, restoring their five-point cushion on a night that delivered shockwaves elsewhere. Chelsea slumped to a damaging 3-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Leeds, Liverpool were held again at Anfield, and Aston Villa’s remarkable rise continued with a 4-3 thriller at Brighton. Mikel Arteta ’s side were far from vintage at the Emirates Stadium but did enough to edge another step towards a first league title since 2003/04. Mikel Merino justified the decision to keep him in the starting XI ahead of a returning Viktor Gyokeres, powering in Ben White’s cross for his 11th goal of the season.“It’s unbelievable what he has done again today,” Arteta said. “The goal is magnificent — the movement, the quality, the finish… It’s phenomenal.”Bukayo Saka came off the bench on the hour mark to make sure of the win, delivering a fierce stoppage-time strike that Caoimhin Kelleher could not keep out.Leeds boss Daniel Farke entered the match under intense scrutiny after four straight defeats, but his side responded with a passionate, clinical display to climb out of the relegation zone. Jaka Bijol headed them ahead early, before Ao Tanaka lashed in a superb drive from the edge of the area.Pedro Neto offered Chelsea brief hope early in the second half, but a defensive calamity sealed their fate as Tosin Adarabioyo was dispossessed inside his box, allowing Dominic Calvert-Lewin to score. “A very poor night,” admitted Blues manager Enzo Maresca. “They deserved to win. They were better than us in all aspects.”Liverpool’s frustrations deepened as they were held 1-1 by Sunderland despite needing a late own-goal to salvage a point. Chemsdine Talbi capitalised on a Virgil van Dijk error before a deflected Florian Wirtz strike went in off Nordi Mukiele. Sunderland nearly snatched a famous win, only for Federico Chiesa to make a heroic goal-line clearance in stoppage time.

Auston Matthews’ captaincy questioned as former Leafs GM hints the team elevated the wrong figure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/auston-matthews-captaincy-questioned-as-former-leafs-gm-hints-the-team-elevated-the-wrong-figure/articleshow/125697194.cms,"Former Leafs GM slams current leadership and claims Auston Matthews was the wrong choice for captain (Getty Images)

Former Leafs boss criticizes leadership group and suggests Auston Matthews isn’t the captain Toronto desperately needs





The Toronto Maple Leafs find themselves in a moment of uncomfortable reflection. What began as a bold shift in leadership by handing Auston Matthews the captaincy has now become a topic of pointed criticism, sparked by a former executive who feels the team lost its compass. The question drawing attention across the hockey world is simple. Did the Leafs pick the wrong captain, and are they now paying the price through uninspired play and fragile identity?Former Leafs GM Gord Stellick spoke plainly about the heart of the issue. He believes leadership and talent are not synonymous. He said, ""There's nothing wrong if your best player isn't a leader. All I can say is last year, you couldn't be more of a team guy, a classy guy, the way he (John Tavares) handled the transition, and then the leadership meant nothing, it's not even a visible thing. It's almost like an award to wear the C. "" His words echo the sentiment of many frustrated fans who now look back at that decision with uneasy hindsight.Stellick did not stop at questioning Auston Matthews as captain. He revealed who he would have chosen. ""If you would have asked me a few years ago, I would've picked Morgan Rielly. He kind of strikes me as a captain, but its an important thing being the captain, and the leadership group is important.""Rielly has longevity and presence, but like Matthews, has never quite taken command of the locker room in that commanding way a captain must.Tavares remains the quiet constant. A professional who knows when to speak, when to deliver and when to let his play do the talking. Yet the captaincy shift forced him to take a step back in title, even if not in spirit. Stellick suggested the leadership change carried symbolism more than substance, raising the concern that the Leafs valued optics over intrinsic leadership dynamics.Still, accountability now rests on the current leaders. As Stellick put it, ""At some point you got to evolve to be the real leaders, and that's where we're going to find out now, a litmus test, about a team that has no business [being] where they are right now, and can this leadership group lead them?"" That test is already underway.If Matthews and his leadership group cannot steer this franchise back to identity and resilience, then the Maple Leafs may soon find John Tavares acting as the quiet stabilizing force once more. Captain or not, his presence still commands respect, even without the C sewn onto his jersey.Also Read: Connor Bedard’s fearless statement after Ducks game shows he’s ready to change the NHL narrative","Former Leafs GM Gord Stellick criticizes leadership group and suggests Auston Matthews isn’t the captain Toronto desperately needs.

South African opener Aiden Markram scored a magnificent 110 runs off 98 balls to lead his team to a successful chase of 359 runs against India in the second ODI at Shaheed Veer Narayan Singh International Stadium on Wednesday. The four-wicket victory helped South Africa equal the record for the highest target chased against India in ODIs, matching Australia's feat in Mohali in 2019.South Africa has now achieved three successful run chases of 350 or more in ODIs, joining India with the most such accomplishments.After receiving the Player of the Match award, Markram discussed his team's positive approach to cricket and their strategy to pressure opposition bowlers.""Yes, exactly. You've got to get through that initial period. We saw in the first game what the middle order did and from my side I did feel a bit responsible that we just came up short. If you kick on into the 70s, the outcome could easily be different.""Tonight, under lights, the wicket had a bit more pace and swing, so the plan was to get in, find some rhythm, and then push on from there.""I can't remember the exact over, but later in the innings we (himself and Bavuma) chatted and felt we were both set.That's normally when I try to play my shots. If one of us gets out, then you rebuild with the next batter. The partnership felt solid.""I'm proud of the boys for getting us over the line. It was tricky at the end, high-pressure moments, but the guys stayed calm and got the job done. It definitely helps (having a long batting line-up),"" Markram said.""When you've effectively got 8 batters and Kesh, who can also chip in, that gives you a lot of freedom. As a team we want to play a positive brand, take the game on and put bowlers under pressure. When you've got depth, you feel that freedom.""The middle order has really put their hands up over the past year. Now it's up to us at the top to set things up so they can entertain. It's tough to pick (opening or middle order). Everyone says opening is great because the field is up and the ball comes onto the bat nicely.""That's true but when it's swinging in and out, it can be a challenge. Still, I'm happy either way. It's only been a few innings at the top again, so I think once I settle in, I'll start enjoying it even more,"" Markram added.The series-deciding third match is scheduled for Saturday.",South Africa beat India by four wickets in second ODI.

Washington Wizards’ Bilal Coulibaly suffered an oblique right strain while facing the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday night. Wizards, who entered the contest with a 3-16 record, traveled all the way to the Wells Fargo Centre to face the Philadelphia 76ers, hoping for a change in the momentum.Instead, they faced another hurdle when the 21-year-old Frenchman, while making a jump shot, got fouled on leading to an abdominal injury in the third quarter. Bilal Coulibaly pushed through for the next eight minutes but was subbed out with the Wizards trailing by 20 points and 3:44 remaining on the game clock.The match-up against the Philadelphia 76ers brought another setback for the already struggling Washington Wizards when Bilal Coulibaly had to exit the game early in the third quarter after suffering an oblique right strain.With 87-67 on the scoreboard, the Wizards had no option but to sub out Coulibaly, who clocked in 25 minutes on the court, scoring 5 rebounds, 2 assists, and 2 points, with one field goal.

Vembu advocates for companies to remove degree requirements, citing Zoho's success with young, degreeless talent.

Sridhar Vembu asks Indian parents to reconsider their college-at-any-cost mindset

No college degree needed at Zoho corporation





Zoho founder and chief scientist Sridhar Vembu has thrown his weight behind a controversial trend sweeping through America's tech industry—high school graduates skipping college entirely and jumping straight into the workforce. In a strongly-worded social media post, Vembu declared this a ""profound cultural shift"" that Indian parents and students must urgently recognize.""Smart American students now skip going to college and forward-thinking employers are enabling them,"" Vembu wrote on X, responding to Palantir's unprecedented hiring experiment that recruited 22 high school graduates, bypassing traditional university education altogether.The Zoho co-founder framed this movement as authentic empowerment for young people. ""This is the real 'youth power', enabling young men and women to stand on their own feet, without having to incur heavy debt to get a degree and paying their own way,"" he emphasized, highlighting the crushing burden of student loans that has become synonymous with American higher education.Vembu’s message carried a direct appeal to parents. ""I would urge educated Indian parents and high schoolers, as well as leading companies to pay attention,"" Vembu wrote, signaling that this American trend holds important lessons for India's education-obsessed middle class, where college degrees—often pursued at significant financial and emotional cost—remain deeply entrenched as markers of success.The backdrop to Vembu's comments is Palantir's Meritocracy Fellowship, which attracted over 500 applications from high school students for just 22 positions. The program's messaging was deliberately provocative: ""Skip the debt. Skip the indoctrination."" Some accepted fellows turned down Ivy League admissions, while one walked away from a full Department of Defense-backed scholarship to join the tech giant instead.During their four-month paid internship, these teenagers worked on real national security and technology challenges alongside Palantir's full-time employees, while also studying U.S. history and Western civilization. Those who excelled received interviews for salaried positions, bypassing the traditional four-year university pipeline entirely.Palantir CEO Alex Karp has been vocally critical of higher education, arguing that universities have abandoned merit-based admissions and become ""breeding grounds for extremism and chaos."" He's stated bluntly that work experience at Palantir provides better credentials than elite university degrees.Vembu hasn't just endorsed this philosophy—he's implemented it. ""At Zoho, no job requires a college degree and if some manager posts a job that requires a degree, they get a polite message from HR to remove the degree requirement!"" he revealed.His commitment runs deep. ""In Tenkasi, I closely work with a technical team whose median age is 19. Their energy and can-do spirit is infectious. I have to work hard to keep up with them!"" Vembu shared, illustrating how young workers without degrees are thriving at his company.Vembu's warning to Indian parents comes as American sentiment toward higher education sours dramatically. Recent data shows 70% of Americans believe higher education is heading in the wrong direction, with 55% rating colleges poorly on preparing students for well-paying jobs. Meanwhile, Gen Z graduates face mounting debt—averaging over $94,000—while 58% struggle to find stable employment after graduation.""This trend will change the way they view the world and it will change culture and politics,"" Vembu predicted. ""I would urge educated Indian parents and high schoolers, as well as leading companies to pay attention.""","Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu champions American tech's trend of high schoolers skipping college for work.

A Manhattan judge on Monday reviewed key evidence in the murder case against Luigi Mangione , including a 911 call from the Altoona, Pennsylvania McDonald’s where he was arrested last year after a dayslong manhunt after he killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.Mangione has pleaded not guilty in both state and federal cases, with federal prosecutors seeking the death penalty.According to Gothamist, prosecutors played the 911 recording in which the McDonald’s manager told a dispatcher the man in the restaurant “looks like the CEO shooter,” adding that customers were “really upset.” Mangione was arrested there on December 9, 2024, five days after Thompson was killed outside the Midtown Hilton in Manhattan.At Monday’s hearing, prosecutors also showed widely circulated surveillance footage of a masked gunman firing at Thompson at close range. Mangione, appearing in court in a grey suit and checkered shirt, watched the footage without visible reaction and took notes, Gothamist reported.His defence team is seeking to toss evidence recovered during his arrest, including a handgun, a loaded magazine and a handwritten notebook found in his backpack.His attorneys argue police conducted an unlawful, warrantless search. Prosecutors say the arrest and search were lawful and that the backpack’s contents tie the 27-year-old to the killing. Much of the same evidence is also being challenged in the federal case.Testimony from a Pennsylvania corrections officer who said Mangione was placed on “constant watch” at SCI-Huntington before extradition because the prison “did not want an ‘Epstein-style’ situation.”The hearing drew unusually large crowds as Mangione’s supporters — some dressed as Nintendo’s Super Mario characters — gathered outside the court holding “Free Luigi” signs and calling for “no death penalty.” A new photo of Mangione from court went viral on social media, echoing the attention he has received since his arrest.The judge in the state case is expected to rule on the suppression issues and could set a trial date in the coming days.","Luigi Mangione, 27, is accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

Staff at a Virginia liquor store turned up for work on Saturday to find the aftermath of what looked like a small riot: smashed whisky bottles, liquor pooling across the floor and one very drunk raccoon passed out in the bathroom.The Ashland ABC store had been closed for Thanksgiving when it suffered what staff later dubbed a “Black Friday break-in”. When they opened up the next morning, they followed a trail of broken glass and spilled spirits to the lavatory, where the “masked bandit” was found spread-eagled between the toilet and the bin, having apparently helped itself to the bottom shelf.“He fell through one of the ceiling tiles and went on a full-blown rampage, drinking everything,” Samantha Martin, an animal control officer in Hanover County, told the. BBC News reported that among the wreckage was the animal’s apparent drink of choice: scotch.Only one blurry CCTV still exists of the boozy intruder, so no one knows exactly how much it managed to knock back before losing consciousness. Staff called Hanover County Animal Protection and Shelter, and Martin collected the “suspect” for what the shelter jokingly described as questioning.In a Facebook post about the incident, the shelter wrote: “On Saturday morning, Officer Martin responded to an unusual call at the Ashland ABC Store.Upon arrival, she discovered the ‘suspect’ had broken in, ransacked several shelves, and then… passed out in the bathroom. The suspect? A very intoxicated raccoon.”The shelter confirmed the animal was, indeed, drunk, but otherwise unharmed. “After a few hours of sleep and zero signs of injury (other than maybe a hangover and poor life choices), he was safely released back to the wild, hopefully having learned that breaking and entering is not the answer,” the post added. Martin later deadpanned that it was “just another day in the life of an animal control officer”.The Ashland ABC store thanked Hanover County Animal Protection and Shelter on social media for its professionalism and for giving the visitor “a sober ride home”.The Hanover shelter, which looks after rescued and unwanted animals, says on its website : “The shelter provides veterinarian care for homeless or unwanted animals until they are adopted or placed with an animal rescue organization.”Raccoons are, in many ways, built for this kind of misadventure. They’ve adapted so successfully to human environments that researchers are starting to see physical changes associated with early domestication. “Wherever humans go, there is trash,” Dr Raffaela Lesch, a biologist at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, recently told. “Animals love our trash. It’s an easy source of food. All they have to do is endure our presence, not be aggressive, and then they can feast on anything we throw away.”In Ashland, Virginia, one raccoon appears to have taken that principle a step further: skip the bin, go straight for the bar.","The Ashland ABC store had been closed for Thanksgiving when it suffered what staff later dubbed a “Black Friday break-in” When they opened up the next morning, they followed a trail of broken glass and spilled spirits to the lavatory, where the “masked bandit” was found spread-eagled between the toilet and the bin.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125752813,imgsize-1157838,width-400,resizemode-4/drunk-raccoon-middle-aged-recently-divorced-rough-week.jpg"
