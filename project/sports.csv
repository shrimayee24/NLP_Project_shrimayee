For some, fault-finding is not an occasional lapse, it is a way of life. They thrive on pointing fingers, for criticism offers a fleeting sense of control , a feeling of superiority that conceals inner insecurity.We often speak of Type A and Type B personalities. Type A is the perfectionist, structured, driven, precise. Type B flows with life, flexible, unhurried. To be a Type A person is not your choice, it is how you are made. Yet even for those who notice every flaw , there is a choice inyou point it out.I learned about this when I was part of the organizing committee of a ten-day workshop. Each day brought new participants and speakers. Amid the bustle, name tags were sometimes printed wrong. My friends and I devised what we called the ‘name tag test’When a name tag was incorrect, some smiled and said, “Not a problem.” There are others who would be wild. One such looked at us frostily and said, “You should be more careful. My name isnotThere are ‘correctors’ all around us. We sometimes learn from them, but often their intent is not to help, but to savour the small thrill of superiority that comes from finding an error.It reminded me of a meme. The devil was showing a newcomer to hell, the lake of fire and said, “This is the lava you’ll be spending eternity in.”The newcomer corrected him: “It’s. Lava is molten rock that erupted on the earth’s surface, magma is beneath it. We’re underground, so it’s magma.”The devil sighed, “This is why you’re here, you realize?”Correct a mistake, if you must. But be gentle. Instead of telling people they were wrong, Greek philosopher Socrates asked questions that led them to realize it themselves. Thispreserved dignity while revealing truth.Thiruvalluvar, who lived perhaps around the same time, offered something even nobler:This truth echoes in our epics too. One episode fromstill melts my heart.At Sita’s insistence, Rama sets out to capture the magical golden deer, despite Lakshmana’s warning. When the demon, disguised as the deer, falls to Rama’s arrow, it screams in Rama’s voice, “Hey Lakshmana! Hey Sita!”Terrified, Sita pleads with her brother-in-law to go save Rama. Lakshmana refuses to leave her alone. In her panic, Sita loses reason and utters something unthinkable: “Your brother is in danger, and you still wish to remain here by my side?”When Rama had slain the deer and saw Lakshmana, he asked why Sita was left alone. Lakshmana did not speak of the cruel words hurled at him by the very person he revered as a mother. He merely bowed his head and said softly that Sita was terrified, and so he came.Not once did he speak of her accusation. The words that had wounded him so deeply remained buried within him, sealed by affection and restraint.Later, when Sita sat imprisoned in Lanka, she wept in remorse. She recalled her abominable words against her innocent brother-in-law and feared that Rama, hearing of them, had turned away from her. But she never knew that those words had not travelled beyond Lakshmana’s heart.Like Lord Shiva who swallowed poison to preserve the world, Lakshmana swallowed pain to preserve peace. He chose silence, not because he was weak, but because he valued harmony more than vindication.In life too, there are moments when words are better swallowed, faults better overlooked, and forgiveness a greater act than correction.Thiruvalluvar calls such restraint ‘— greatness.For true greatness is not in catching another’s slip, but in having the grace to let it pass.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124632548,imgsize-57620,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/124632548.jpg"

Optics vs reality

""Not a sign of disintegration""

A bigger bloc, more arithmetic

Friendly fights and withdrawal loophole

Not the first messy start

NDA's campaign mode on

NEW DELHI: As nominations for Phase 1 of the Bihar assembly elections closed on Friday, the NDA appeared battle-ready, its candidate list finalised, campaign plan rolled out.Across the aisle, the opposition's Mahagathbandhan (or INDIA bloc), led by Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), continues to debate who fights where. Congress and RJD, which are still holding talks, have also declared a few of its candidates for the high-prestige contest.This, obviously, has given a big ammunition to the NDA which has claimed that the Mahagathbandhan has crumbled even before the contest.Yet, despite the optics of confusion, alliance leaders insist the delay signals expansion, not disarray.Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar, who has been part of the opposition bloc's discussions, said such coordination takes time. ""Coordination matters more than speed,"" he quipped, adding that the bloc’s final list would be announced soon.Congress leader Pawan Khera on Thursday also questioned why NDA was concerned about Mahagathbandhan's deal.Khera informed that candidates were filing their nominations and the procedure for seat distribution was under way. He affirmed clearance on the situation and mentioned that the Mahagathbandhan government will be formed in Bihar.""The work is going on very well, symbols are being distributed. Those who have to file nominations are also doing so. The process has started... Very soon, the entire situation will be clear to everyone. The Mahagathbandhan government is going to be formed. Why is the NDA raising questions? They should think about themselves,"" Khera told ANI.CPI(ML) Liberation general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya dismissed speculation of infighting within the opposition alliance.""People may feel there is chaos in the INDIA bloc. But the delay in announcing seats is because more constituents are on board this time. It’s definitely not a sign of disintegration,” he told PTI.Bhattacharya revealed that his party, which won 12 of the 19 seats it contested in 2020, would field roughly the same number this time.This year's Mahagathbandhan is more crowded than in 2020, when it included the RJD, Congress, and the three Left parties — CPI(ML), CPI, and CPI(M).Now, Mukesh Sahni’s Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) has joined the fold, while talks are under way with Hemant Soren’s JMM, which wants to contest a few border seats.Congress, meanwhile, has released its first list of 48 candidates even before the seat-sharing formula was finalised - a move that signalled both impatience and self-confidence. Among the key names are state chief Rajesh Ram (Kutumba), CLP leader Shakeel Ahmad Khan (Kadwa), and Youth Congress chief Prakash Garib Das (Bachhwara).In Bachhwara, however, CPI’s Awadesh Roy has also filed papers, creating what insiders call a ""friendly contest"", a common phenomenon in Bihar’s multi-party coalitions.Sources within the bloc told PTI said RJD has tentatively agreed to allot 61 seats to the Congress, with some negotiations still underway over high-stakes constituencies.In India’s electoral playbook, such overlaps between allies are common. When alliances negotiate till the last minute, parties often field 'friendly' candidates in the same seats, using the withdrawal window to clean up overlaps once the deal is sealed.The withdrawal window, which opens after nominations close, gives them room to tidy up overlaps once the final deal is sealed. Candidates in overlapping seats typically withdraw nominations at the last minute, leaving only the officially endorsed name in the fray.With the Phase 1 withdrawal deadline on Monday, and Phase 2 deadline on Thursday, several overlapping candidates are likely to quietly withdraw once the bloc finalises its list.This isn’t the first time Bihar’s opposition has walked into an election season with unresolved seat-sharing issues.In 2020, the RJD and Congress sparred till the eleventh hour over key constituencies, and yet, the alliance went on to deliver one of its strongest performances in years, falling just short of defeating the NDA. The Grand Alliance registered win on 110 seats out of 243. Tejashwi Yadav's RJD emerged as the single largest party in the assembly and he was election leader of opposition in the assembly.The Left parties contested as part of the alliance and performed notably well, especially CPI-ML(L) that won 12 seats. Congress secured 19 seats.That precedent might have made leaders more relaxed about the optics of delay.The NDA, by contrast, has its machinery in motion. The JD(U) and BJP are contesting 101 seats each, with allies LJP (Ram Vilas), RLM, and HAM covering the rest.The BJP’s 40-member star campaigner list, led by PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, signals a high-energy campaign. Chief minister Nitish Kumar, seeking his 10th term, is pitching continuity and stability, while the opposition bets on discontent, voter fatigue and anti-incumbency.The first phase of voting will be held on November 6, the second on November 11, and counting on November 14. For now, the NDA may have the early advantage in optics, but Mahagathbandhan's late start may not necessarily have an impact on the final results.","BJP fields Samrat Choudhary, Vijay Sinha in first list for Bihar polls.

Bihar Polls: UP CM Yogi Adityanath Accuses RJD, Congress of ‘Mischief’ Over Burqa Verification Order

NEW DLEHI: Janhit Janata Dal (JJD) chief and Lalu Yadav ’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav , who is set to contest from Mahua constituency in the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections , filed his nomination on Thursday accompanied by a roadshow and carrying a photo of his grandmother Marchiya Devi.Speaking to reporters, he said the occasion was significant for him as he had moved ahead with the blessings of his grandmother and parents.""I have moved ahead with the blessings of my grandmother and my parents. On this auspicious occasion, as I am required to file my nomination, I have brought my grandmother with me. She lives on in our hearts... People of Mahua will support whoever works for them. I worked to make Mahua a district and also give employment opportunities to the youth,"" Tej Pratap said, as quoted by ANI.Tej Pratap, who currently represents Hasanpur, had earlier served as Mahua MLA from 2015 to 2020. The seat is now held by RJD’s Mukesh Kumar Raushan.The JJD, which Tej Pratap floated after his expulsion from the RJD earlier this year, has announced 22 candidates in its first list for the assembly elections scheduled for November. His expulsion from the party followed a controversy involving a social media post where he claimed to be in a long-term relationship.Tej Pratap had later stated that his account was hacked.His strained ties with his family have played out publicly in recent months. On October 12, he unfollowed his younger brother and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on X. He had earlier unfollowed his sisters Misa Bharti and Hema Yadav. He now follows only five accounts, including his father Lalu Prasad Yadav, mother Rabri Devi, and sister Raj Lakshmi Yadav.Despite family tensions, Tej Pratap’s sister Rohini Acharya extended her support to him with a message on X: ""May you achieve all the success and happiness in the world, and may you always move forward like a shining light, brother. Wishing you all the very best... with love and blessings.""It makes an interesting twist in the Yadav family dynamics, as last month Rohini Acharya did something similar to his elder brother Tej Pratap when she unfollowed RJD, and Tejaswi Yadav from her social media accounts. The increasing rifts between family members playing out in public are often attributed to sudden importance given to Sanjay Yadav, a close friend to Tejaswi.On being asked about the grandmother and Acharya he said, ""I brought the photo of my grandmother Marchiya Devi in the nomination. With her blessing, I am going to win in Mahua. The Janshakti Janata Dal is going to win. Rohini Acharya called me, she extended her good wishes.""The Bihar Assembly elections will take place in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with counting scheduled for November 14. The main contest is expected between the NDA alliance led by BJP-JD(U) and the INDIA bloc led by RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav. JJD is among the new entrants in the fray, alongside Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj, which has announced plans to contest all 243 seats.",Lalu Yadav's elder son Tej Pratap Yadav filed his nomination for Bihar Assembly elections.

How a social media rumor spiraled out of control

Super Bowl SHOCK: Turning Point USA Plots Its OWN Halftime Show Amid Bad Bunny Drama

Adam Sandler remains focused on comedy and film, not politics

A bizarre viral rumor suggesting that Adam Sandler was set to perform at Turning Point USA’s All-American Halftime Show has officially been debunked. The claim, which spread rapidly across Facebook and X (formerly Twitter), alleged that the comedian would headline a rival event to the Super Bowl halftime show, but fact-checkers and sources close to Sandler have confirmed that the story is entirely fabricated.The rumor began earlier this week after a series of misleading Facebook posts claimed that “Adam Sandler will join Lara Trump at the Turning Point USA halftime show.” The posts racked up thousands of shares within hours, with users debating whether Sandler had shifted toward political performances. However, no reputable news outlet, nor Turning Point USA itself, ever announced his involvement.According to media watchdog Primetimer, the rumor stemmed from a manipulated headline that mixed genuine coverage of Lara Trump’s recent offer to perform at the event with false claims about Sandler’s participation. The viral graphic even used a photo of Sandler from his Netflix stand-up special, adding to the illusion of authenticity.Fact-checkers later confirmed that Sandler has no known ties to Turning Point USA or its founder Charlie Kirk , and he has never publicly expressed interest in performing at political events.In reality, Sandler’s current schedule is packed with promotional appearances for his upcoming Netflix sequel “Happy Gilmore 2” and a new family comedy project set for release in 2026.Sources close to the actor emphasized that he’s steering clear of politically charged platforms. “He’s focused on creative projects and touring, not partisan events,” one insider told Primetimer.This isn’t the first time Sandler has been the subject of viral misinformation. Earlier this year, fake posts alleged that he had exchanged texts with Charlie Kirk and criticized late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, both of which were later proven false.Also Read: Will Jennifer Lopez join Bad Bunny at the Super Bowl halftime show?

In this case, fans can rest assured: Adam Sandler won’t be trading jokes for political speeches anytime soon.","A viral rumor claiming Adam Sandler would perform at Turning Point USA's halftime show has been debunked.

The match ended in disqualification when Rhodes hit McIntyre with the Undisputed WWE title.

Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade open up about their surrogacy journey

Former NBA star Dwyane Wade and his wife Gabrielle Union have been married for over a decade. They celebrated their 11th wedding anniversary on August 30 and even shared a montage of videos on Instagram marking their special day. Despite showcasing the bright sunny side on social media, the Wade couple has been through one of the toughest times. Gabrielle Union revealed her biggest fear when the former NBA star was diagnosed with Cancer.During an interview with the reputed media outlet Marie Claire, Dwyane Wade’s wife, Gabrielle Union, opened up about one of the most toughest times in their life. While talking about the Miami Heat alum’s cancer diagnosis, Gabrielle Union shared one of her biggest fears. According to the Hollywood star, she would have to raise the kids alone. She revealed it was really difficult to navigate things in her public life while dealing with a major personal life crisis. Gabrielle Union revealed it became very difficult to process Dwyane Wade's cancer diagnosis as the Hollywood star felt that she would be left alone after her husband. She said,""It was hard to navigate publicly the things that were happening privately.Even though we all know plenty of survivors, immediately you go to death, immediately we all internalize his cancer. It's our cancer.""According to Union, she was scared, hopeless, and even worried that she would have to raise the kids in Dwyane Wade’s absence. The Bring It On star was overwhelmed with emotions, poured her heart out during the interview. She said,""I'll speak for myself when I say that the decisions that he was making hurt me about his cancer. It felt like, 'Oh, you're trying to kill me. And I'm going to be alone raising these kids. It's a very selfish response that I had, and it caused all kinds of problems, but [so did] his need for secrecy about his cancer decisions. It just starts sowing the seeds of distrust.""After coming across the life-threatening tumor in Wade’s kidney, Gabrielle Union felt as if the NBA icon was almost near to death. She explained that the Miami Heat's alum was trying to leave her behind all alone raising the kids herself. Gabrielle Union admitted that she had serious trust issues with her husband Dwyane Wade. The uncertainty of Wade's Cancer diagnosis left her in a mentally wretched state. She further elaborated,""It just felt like he was trying to leave us—not in a marital sense, but a life and death sense. By the time he got it removed, I felt like we were more on the same page.""Dwyane Wade underwent a kidney removal surgery in December 2023 which resulted in the removal of a certain percentage of his kidney. Reportedly, his 40% right kidney was removed due to the cancer diagnosis. During this particular period of time, Gabrielle Union-Wade and the Heat's alum went through a lot in terms of trauma and anxiety. After Wade's cancer diagnosis, the fear of never being able to see her husband again took a toll on Gabrielle Union's mental health. The Hollywood star started living with the thought that she would be left alone taking care of their kids.The abandonment trauma impacted her physical and emotional well-being. However, after leaving behind the tumor with a successful surgery, the Wades make the most of their time along with their daughter, Kaavia. Dwyane Wade and his wife, Gabrielle Union, have been through one of the darkest times of their lives while supporting one another like a rock.

Why This Trade Could Work for Both Teams

Key Trade Implications

Theare reportedly exploring a blockbuster move that could redefine the franchise’s future. According to Fansided’s Matt Moore, the team may consider parting ways with long-time defensive anchor Draymond Green to acquire- a player with a massive $175 million contract and generational talent.After a quiet offseason, the Golden State Warriors ’ biggest addition has been veteran forward Al Horford, making them one of the oldest teams in NBA history. Despite that, the front office remains confident that Stephen Curry can still lead the franchise to another deep playoff run.The organization is reportedly waiting until midseason to determine whether this current roster can keep pace with the Western Conference elite. If they prove competitive, major trade talks could intensify before the deadline.“You fundamentally reshape your entire future instead of trying to sneak out one more title. It buys you time to reconfigure and extend your success and avoid a post-Steph rebuild,” Matt Moore said Monday. (H/t: Sporting News)Moore’s statement highlights what could be a defining moment for Golden State - choosing between loyalty to its core and building for the next era.Moore’s trade scenario involves the Golden State Warriors sending several key assets to Milwaukee in exchange for Giannis Antetokounmpo This trade would mean Golden State parting with a franchise icon and its young depth - a steep price even for a two-time MVP. However, pairing Giannis with Curry could immediately catapult the Golden State Warriors back into title contention.The addition of stretch big men like Quinten Post and Al Horford gives the Golden State Warriors more spacing than in previous seasons, allowing Giannis to dominate inside without clogging the floor. His explosive playstyle could perfectly complement Curry’s perimeter shooting, creating one of the most dynamic duos in NBA history.For Milwaukee, the move represents a potential reset. The Bucks have struggled recently despite Giannis’s brilliance, and a package featuring young talents like Moody and Podziemski, along with multiple first-round picks, offers a clear path toward rebuilding.• For the Warriors: A chance to extend their championship window beyond the Curry era• For the Bucks: Long-term assets and flexibility to reshape their roster• For Draymond Green: The possible end of a legendary run with Golden StateTrading Draymond Green - a four-time champion and defensive cornerstone - would be one of the toughest decisions in franchise history. Yet as Moore points out, “You can’t justify moving one of your franchise icons for almost any player. Giannis is not just any player.”Should the trade be completed, it would both end an era and start a new one centered on Giannis Antetokounmpo and Stephen Curry. Additionally, it would be remembered as one of the most significant moves in NBA history.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors Could Limit $8.6 Million Star’s Minutes as Veteran Core Takes Priority in New Season The Golden State Warriors’ front office faces a defining test this season: stay loyal to a proven core or risk it all for a once-in-a-generation superstar.

San Francisco 49ers’ George Kittle set for Week 7 comeback after Hamstring injury

What George Kittle’s comeback means for 49ers

George Kittle excited to return from hamstring injury for 49ers-Falcons game | NBC Sports Bay Area

The San Francisco 49ers sit at 4-2, but they’ve been without star tight end George Kittle since Week 1. The Pro Bowler tore his right hamstring against the Seattle Seahawks and has missed five games. Recent updates, including medical clearance for practice, signal that Kittle could return soon, bringing hope for a much-needed boost to the 49ers’ offense.Harvard-trained sports surgeon Dr. Deepak Chona recently provided an encouraging update on George Kittle’s recovery, stating that both Kittle and Tampa Bay Buccaneers receiver Mike Evans are likely to return to pre-injury form within one to two weeks. However, Chona also warned that Kittle faces a “high re-injury risk given age and history,” which is a concern considering his previous injuries.Kittle’s injury occurred after 22 snaps in Week 1, with just over ten minutes left in the second quarter. He was immediately placed on injured reserve, forcing him to miss five straight games — his longest absence since 2020, when he missed eight games due to knee and foot injuries. According to NFL rules, players placed on injured reserve must miss a minimum of four games, which made Kittle eligible to return in Week 6.However, the 49ers opted to give him extra recovery time.This week, Kittle was cleared for a 21-day practice window, signaling his possible return against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 7. He participated in limited practice sessions on Wednesday and Thursday, showing promising progress. Speaking to reporters, Kittle sounded eager to rejoin the team: “I fully plan on playing on Sunday. As long as Kyle lets me. It’s up to him. But hopefully I’m out there.” Head coach Kyle Shanahan echoed that optimism, confirming that Kittle’s return is “the hope. ”Kittle’s comeback brings both excitement and tough decisions for the 49ers. His return energizes the locker room, with quarterback Mac Jones praising his leadership and infectious energy. However, it also forces San Francisco to reevaluate its offensive lineup, especially with ongoing injuries to key players like Fred Warner, Marquez Valdes-Scantling, and Ricky Pearsall.Kittle’s impending return presents a crucial decision for the 49ers — whether to accelerate his comeback to reignite their offense or adopt a cautious approach to prevent another setback. Either way, his presence could be the key to restoring balance and momentum as San Francisco enters the heart of the season.Also Read: CeeDee Lamb injury update: Cowboys’ Star WR on track for Week 7 against Washington Commanders","The San Francisco 49ers have been without star tight end George Kittle since Week 1.

Milwaukee Brewers 'Karen' Fired By Employer After 'Racist' Rant Against LA Dodgers Fan Goes Viral

Exploring Shannon Kobylarczyk's controversy



Did Shannon Kobylarczyk lose her job?



What did MLB say about the Shannon Kobylarczyk controversy?



The Milwaukee Brewers’ National League Championship Series clash with the Los Angeles Dodgers took a sharp turn off the field when a video from Game 2 went viral for all the wrong reasons. A heated exchange between Brewers fan Shannon Kobylarczyk and Dodgers supporter Ricardo Fosado turned into a national talking point after Kobylarczyk was seen making a racially charged remark. Within days, she lost her job, resigned from a charitable board, and was banned from American Family Field.Shannon Kobylarczyk, a Milwaukee-based attorney, worked at ManpowerGroup, a global staffing firm, and also served on the Make-A-Wish Wisconsin board of directors. Until last week, she was largely unknown outside professional circles. That changed during Game 2 of the NLCS on October 14, when she became the center of an online firestorm.The game, played in Milwaukee, had started as a typical postseason battle — the Brewers took an early lead before the Dodgers surged ahead. Amid the excitement, Fosado, a Los Angeles fan and U.S. Navy veteran, began recording the crowd’s reaction after a Dodgers home run.In his clip, Kobylarczyk can be heard mocking him, yelling, “Real men drink beer, p***y!” Moments later, she tapped another fan and said, “You know what, let’s call ICE. ”Fosado, calm but defiant, replied, “Call ICE. Call ICE. I’m a U.S. citizen, war veteran, baby girl. War veteran, two wars. ICE is not gonna do nothing to me. Good luck.”The exchange escalated, leading to Fosado’s removal from the stadium after Kobylarczyk reported him to security. However, the story didn’t end there, it was only beginning.The viral video, viewed more than 2 million times, quickly drew outrage online. Many criticized Kobylarczyk for using an anti-immigrant remark, especially toward a Latino veteran. The Brewers soon confirmed that both fans were banned from American Family Field due to “offensive statements” and “physical confrontation.”In a statement, the team said, “The Brewers expect all persons attending games to be respectful of each other, and we do not condone in any way offensive statements fans make to each other about race, gender, or national origin.” They emphasized their commitment to maintaining a “safe and enjoyable experience” for all fans.The fallout was swift. ManpowerGroup announced that Kobylarczyk had been placed on leave and later terminated. “As soon as we became aware of this video the individual was placed on immediate leave and we began an investigation,” the company said. “As a result of this process, the employee is no longer with the organization. We remain committed to maintaining a culture grounded in respect, integrity, and accountability. ”She also resigned from Make-A-Wish Wisconsin’s board. The nonprofit confirmed, “Shannon Kobylarczyk resigned from our board of directors this afternoon effective immediately. Make-A-Wish Wisconsin does not condone nor agree with Kobylarczyk’s words and actions.”Major League Baseball and the Brewers shared that such behavior violates league standards. The Milwaukee Police Department also became involved, citing Fosado for disorderly conduct and intoxication, though he wasn’t charged. Both fans, the Brewers said, are barred “from returning to the ballpark for future events.”Interestingly, Fosado himself showed grace toward Kobylarczyk despite the confrontation. Speaking to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, he said, “I don’t think it was like horrible or something that should get her fired. I feel bad for her. We cannot be judged on one mistake, and a lot of emotions were involved.”For Fosado, the night ended on a surprisingly positive note. “This is my first time at a Brewers game and I got kicked out, but you know what? I had a great experience and everybody was really friendly and welcoming,” he said.The viral moment dubbed Kobylarczyk “Brewers Karen” online.Also Read: Brewers 'Karen' fired after viral video identifies her as Shannon Kobylarczyk in racist rant at Dodgers supporter and U.S. war veteran","Shannon Kobylarczyk, a Milwaukee-based attorney, worked at ManpowerGroup, a global staffing firm.

Falcons’ wide receiver Ray-Ray McCloud’s sudden absence raises eyebrows

Insider claims McCloud’s benching may be tied to Ike Hilliard firing and locker room tension

“words were likely exchanged that probably shouldn’t have been said,”

What McCloud’s absence could mean for his Falcons future

Just when Atlanta Falcons fans thought they’d seen all the drama this season, wide receiver Ray-Ray McCloud has been sent home, and nobody knows when or if he’ll return. Head coach Raheem Morris confirmed Friday that McCloud’s absence is excused, calling it a “private matter”, leaving fans speculating about what’s really going on behind the scenes.McCloud’s departure from team activities comes amid a season of ups and downs. The 27-year-old was a healthy scratch in Week 6 against the Buffalo Bills, hinting at a reduced role in the Falcons’ offense compared to his career-best 2024 performance.HC Raheem Morris emphasized that the situation is unrelated to recent coaching changes, including the firing of former wide receivers coach Ike Hilliard. Still, the timing has sparked questions about McCloud’s role on the roster and whether the Falcons are prepared for his absence on special teams and in the passing game.The insider, who has previously leaked accurate Falcons information, claims McCloud’s recent benching could be linked to the firing of former wide receivers coach Ike Hilliard. Apparently, McCloud had a disagreement with Morris following the coaching shake-up, andwhich may have led to a disciplinary benching.Fans have already noticed McCloud looking less than thrilled celebrating in the locker room while his teammates cheered, adding fuel to the speculation that internal tension is at play.If true, this insider intel adds a new layer of drama to McCloud’s season.Analysts have also weighed in, noting that McCloud’s versatility as a slot receiver and special teams ace makes him a valuable asset, and missing him even temporarily could impact Atlanta’s short-term game plan.McCloud’s situation remains a mystery, and the lack of a clear return timeline keeps the speculation machine running. After a strong 2024 season, where he contributed significantly in both receiving and return duties, his future with the team is now uncertain.Between the private matter, insider claims about locker room tension, and the speculation surrounding his benching, McCloud’s absence has become one of the NFL ’s juiciest off-field stories. Fans, analysts, and teammates will be watching closely to see when or if he returns to the Falcons lineup.Also read - “They can’t do sh*t”: Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson caught trash talking in a leaked hot-mic","Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Ray-Ray McCloud has been sent home, and nobody knows when or if he’ll return.

Taylor Swift’s album release allegedly strains friendship with Ed Sheeran



Donna Kelce’s support comes as Swift balances fame and friendship drama



Donna Kelce, mother of Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce , showed up at Universal Orlando’s Halloween Horror Nights dressed head to toe in Taylor Swift merch. The 73-year-old posted photos on Instagram on Oct. 16, posing with friends in a “1989”-era Taylor Swift hat and shorts from Swift’s latest album, The Life of a Showgirl.“Universal Studios Halloween Horror Nights doesn’t disappoint,” she captioned her post. Fans flooded the comments with messages of support, calling her a “Super mother-in-law” and praising her for her loyalty to Swift.The shorts, featuring images from the singer’s new album, retail for $55 on Swift’s website. Donna Kelce has worn the same hat several times, including at a Kansas City Chiefs game earlier this month, where she paired it with Chiefs earrings and a jersey.Swift and Travis Kelce announced their engagement in August, and Donna has been proudly celebrating their relationship. A People report described her as “very sentimental,” saying she’s saving photos and keepsakes from the couple’s engagement.Travis told GQ that his fiancée and his mom share key qualities. “Their kindness, their genuineness, their ability to say hello to everyone in the room,” he said, crediting Donna’s work ethic as one of the reasons he admires both women.While Donna Kelce continues to support Taylor Swift, the singer’s friendship with Ed Sheeran has reportedly hit a rough patch.According to Daily Mail, Sheeran was “peeved” after Swift released The Life of a Showgirl just three weeks after his album Play. A music insider told the outlet, “Ed takes these things really seriously and carefully plans his album releases. He announced his album with four months’ notice, but then Taylor announced hers for just two weeks after. He was very much put out and understandably peeved.”The source added that it’s “not the first time Taylor has done something like this” and claimed that the move has “strained” their longtime friendship.Even though Play debuted at No. 1, it quickly fell out of the Top 10 when Swift’s record dropped. The overlap reportedly left Sheeran’s team rushing to promote his album before Swift’s overshadowed it.The pair have been close since 2012, collaborating on “Everything Has Changed” from Swift’s Red album. Swift has called Sheeran her “second brother” in past interviews, but their relationship appears to have cooled in recent months.During her Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon appearance on Oct. 10, Swift laughed off rumors of bad blood, saying Sheeran doesn’t even own a phone. “He doesn’t have a phone. When the news came out, I was like, ‘Oh my God, we forgot to call Ed!’ He’s like family. I love him,” she said.Between her engagement to Travis Kelce and ongoing friendship rumors, Taylor Swift continues to dominate headlines.Donna Kelce’s open admiration for her future daughter-in-law shows how close the families have become, even as Swift’s inner circle faces speculation about fractured friendships.Neither Swift nor Sheeran have commented further on the reported tension, but Swift’s recent appearances and family ties suggest she’s focusing on what matters most.","Donna Kelce showed up at Universal Orlando’s Halloween Horror Nights dressed head to toe in Taylor Swift merch.

Larry Williams’ faith, football legacy, and lasting impact across college athletics



Sports world reacts to the sudden death of Larry Williams

Larry Williams, a former NFL offensive lineman and athletic director at the University of San Francisco, died on Thursday morning during a workout on campus. He was 62.According to university president Salvador D. Aceves, Williams collapsed while exercising at the War Memorial Gym. “Our prayers go out to Larry’s wife, Laura, their children, Kristin, Sean, Scott, Eric, and Louis, their families, and his grandchildren,” Aceves said in a letter to the university community. “My thoughts and prayers also go to the university’s 250 student-athletes and all of the coaches and staff under Larry’s skillful watch.”Williams had been the school’s athletic director since 2022. No official cause of death has been released, though local reports cited a possible heart-related incident.Before becoming an administrator, Larry Williams built a strong football career rooted in faith and discipline. A California native, Williams was a two-time All-American at Notre Dame before being drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the 10th round of the 1985 NFL Draft. He went on to play 61 games with 44 starts over seven seasons, spending time with the Browns, New Orleans Saints, and New England Patriots.While playing professionally, he earned a law degree from the University of San Diego, later practicing law in Indianapolis before shifting toward leadership in college athletics.Williams became the athletic director at the University of Portland in 2004, then at Marquette University, followed by the University of Akron, and finally the University of San Francisco in 2022.When hired by USF, Williams said the role aligned perfectly with his beliefs. “USF represents to me the almost perfect combination of things I cherish,” he explained. “No. 1, it’s the Catholic identity. No. 2, it’s the deep educational mission. And No. 3, it’s athletic participation in an environment that very specifically includes 1 and 2. At this point in my career, there’s almost a vocational element to what I do here at USF. ”Tributes poured in across college and professional football. Notre Dame Football posted, “We are deeply saddened by the passing of Larry Williams. We send our condolences to his family and friends.”Marquette University described him as a “strong, committed leader whose passion for the holistic development of student-athletes left a lasting mark on collegiate athletics.”Journalist Pete Thamel called the news “crushing,” adding, “Larry was smart, engaging, and fun to talk with because he thought outside the box. He had great perspective as a former star player in college and the NFL.”Williams is survived by his wife, Laura, five children, and several grandchildren. Stephanie Shrieve-Hawkins has been appointed interim athletic director at USF.","Former NFL player and University of San Francisco athletic director Larry Williams died suddenly during a morning workout.

Where to Watch the Los Angeles Lakers vs Golden State Warriors Game Tonight (October 17, 2025)?

Theandwill meet for their final preseason matchup on October 17, 2025, at Chase Center - but both teams are entering this contest short-handed. With the regular season just days away, this game is more about rhythm and readiness than rivalry. Coaches Steve Kerr and Tyronn Lue are both prioritizing player health and rotation balance over final scores. Golden State Warriors ’ depth will once again be put to the test as they close out the preseason. Jimmy Butler, the team’s marquee midseason acquisition from last year, headlines the injury list after suffering an ankle injury during practice earlier this week. He’s been listed as doubtful for the matchup, though an MRI revealed no structural damage. The Golden State Warriors expect Butler to be ready for their regular-season opener against the Los Angeles Lakers on October 21.Before the setback, Butler averaged 10.5 points, 3 rebounds, and 2.5 assists while shooting 60% from the field in two preseason games. Kerr emphasized that there’s no rush to bring him back, noting Butler’s excellent conditioning and confirming that he’ll resume ramp-up workouts over the weekend.The Golden State Warriors will also be without Moses Moody, who continues to recover from a calf strain suffered earlier in the month. He hasn’t appeared since early October but should be available for opening night. Draymond Green is expected to rest, while Seth Curry remains listed as day-to-day for non-injury reasons.With several veterans sidelined, Golden State will rely on its younger players. Jonathan Kuminga, Brandin Podziemski, and rookie Alex Toohey - who missed the last game for rest - are expected to see expanded roles tonight.The Los Angeles Clippers , meanwhile, are managing their own absences. Head coach Tyronn Lue has confirmed that Kawhi Leonard and James Harden will not play, purely as a rest precaution before the regular season. Both stars have performed well in preseason action, and Lue’s decision is centered on preserving their fitness and avoiding unnecessary risk.Bradley Beal continues to sit out with knee soreness, while Bogdan Bogdanovic remains unavailable due to lower back tightness. These absences will open the door for young and fringe players to step up, including Amir Coffey and John Collins. Collins, a recent addition to the roster, has filled in admirably for Ivica Zubac in recent games.When healthy, the Los Angeles Clippers have looked sharp. Kawhi Leonard, in particular, impressed earlier this week with 17 points in the first half against the Denver Nuggets. Still, Coach Lue is keeping his focus on conditioning and chemistry rather than results.With several top names out, tonight’s game is expected to be a proving ground for bench players and young talent. For Golden State, the emphasis will be on assessing how Kuminga and Podziemski handle expanded offensive responsibilities and lead the second unit. The Los Angeles Clippers will likely turn to Zubac, Norman Powell, and Terance Mann to anchor their rotation and provide veteran stability.Fans shouldn’t expect a playoff-caliber showdown - instead, this will be a strategic tune-up for both sides, allowing coaching staffs to finalize rotations and ensure readiness for the 2025–26 regular season. The real victory for both teams will be emerging from this game healthy and prepared for opening night.With Jimmy Butler and Kawhi Leonard both sidelined, the spotlight shifts to the supporting casts. This preseason finale serves as a platform for role players and hopefuls to make one last statement before the real competition begins next week.The Los Angeles Clippers vs. Golden State Warriors preseason game on October 17, 2025, tips off at 10:00 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. IST on October 18) at Chase Center.

Marcus Mariota’s career earnings: From Titans to Commanders

Marcus Mariota has been in the spotlight since his first NFL snap. Back in 2015, the Oregon Ducks star stunned fans with a record-setting debut, throwing four touchdowns and finishing with a perfect passer rating of 158.3. That performance made him the first player since 1933 to hit that mark in his first game. Even with all the hype, Mariota downplayed the moment, saying, “We have to find ways to get better.” Now, after more than a decade in the league, the Washington Commanders quarterback is still collecting big checks.In 2025, Marcus Mariota’s net worth stands at $75,541,683. The number reflects his steady run of NFL salaries, bonuses, and endorsements. He once ranked 83rd on Forbes’ list of highest-paid athletes, pulling in $23.9 million in 2020 alone. That season, $20.9 million came directly from NFL salary and winnings, while $3 million came through endorsement deals.Fast forward to today, Mariota is in his second season with the Washington Commanders. After working as a backup to Jayden Daniels last year, he signed a fresh one-year, $8 million contract in March 2025.The deal includes a $5.5 million signing bonus, $7.39 million guaranteed, and carries an $8.08 million cap hit.

NEW DELHI: BCCI chief selector Ajit Agarkar has responded to Mohammed Shami 's recent criticism over being left out of India’s white-ball tour of Australia. Agarkar addressed Shami’s comments regarding his fitness and availability for Bengal in Ranji Trophy matches.Shami, who last represented India in the Champions Trophy and was the country’s joint highest wicket-taker alongside Varun Chakravarthy, has been managing ankle and knee injuries that required surgery following the 2023 World Cup.The fast bowler had voiced his displeasure over the selection snub, stating that his participation in the Ranji Trophy proved his fitness and that it wasn’t his responsibility to update the selection committee.Responding to Shami’s remarks, Agarkar said: “If he says that to me, I will probably answer that. I mean if he was here, I would probably do that. I am not quite sure what he said on social media. Maybe if I read that, I might give him a call but my phone is always on for most players. I have had multiple chats with him over the last few months, but I don't want to try and give you a headline here.”Agarkar further elaborated: “He has been an incredible performer for India.If he said something, maybe that is a conversation for me to have with him or him to have with me. But even before England, we said if he was fit, he would have been on that plane. Unfortunately, he wasn't. Our domestic season has just started so we will see if he is fit enough and we will see where it goes. This is the first round of Ranji games that is going on. We will find out in a couple of more games. If he is bowling well, why would you not want to have someone like a Shami. But what we have found in the last six-eight months to a year, even during the Australia tour, we were desperate to have him on, but unfortunately his fitness wasn't there. If he does stay fit over the next few months, the story might be different. But at this point, as far as I know, he wasn't fit enough for that England tour.”India’s upcoming tour of Australia, beginning October 19, features three ODIs and a five-match T20I series. The tour will also mark the return of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli to international cricket, their first appearance since the 2025 Champions Trophy final in March.", BCCI chief selector Ajit Agarkar has responded to Mohammed Shami's recent criticism over being left out of India’s white-ball tour of Australia.

NEW DELHI: Vaibhav Suryavanshi’s fan base is growing at an astonishing pace. Wherever the teenage sensation plays, crowds gather in anticipation of his batting fireworks — and the youngster rarely disappoints. He also makes sure to acknowledge the love he receives. A perfect example came during Bihar’s recent Ranji Trophy clash against Arunachal Pradesh at the Moin-ul-Haq Stadium in Patna.After Bihar’s innings-and-165-run victory, hundreds of fans waited eagerly near the stands, hoping to catch a glimpse of their hometown hero.

'Spartan mentality!': Varun Chakaravarthy reveals Gautam Gambhir's ruthless mindset with Team India

Poll Do you believe expensive luxury items can create guilt among individuals from a middle-class background? Yes, definitely No, not really

Indian spinner Varun Chakravarthy opened up about his relationship with money, revealing how he struggles with the guilt of spending on luxury items. He admitted that his typical middle-class mindset has made him acutely aware of money’s power.""I have had my struggle with money,"" he said on Breakfast with Champions.""The only investments I knew were FDs (fixed deposits). My typical middle-class mindset. I know how powerful money is. If something is very powerful, you will have to use it to its full potential.""""What I feel is, rather than just changing my lifestyle with money, you can change someone else’s life — that’s more powerful.""The 34-year-old spinner shared a story of buying an expensive watch.""I have this guilty feeling that if I spend so much, if I have a watch worth Rs 30 lakh or 40 lakh, that amount of money actually can change someone’s life for two or three generations.""One watch I bought, which was around three lakhs or something, that itself just killed me from within. I know there are people who buy more expensive stuff.""See, the guys I have grown up with, some of them are still delivering food and doing all those things.

Just days after suffering a devastating ankle injury, Warner and his wife, Sydney, shared some joyful news that instantly lifted spirits across the 49ers community — they’re expecting a baby girl.Fred Warner’s 2025 season came to a painful halt last Sunday after he fractured and dislocated his right ankle in a brutal collision against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Mark Sanchez Smelled of Alcohol Before Violent Knife Fight; Now Hit With Multiple Charges

Legal troubles mounting for Mark Sanchez





Former NFL quarterback and Fox Sports analyst Mark Sanchez is facing an uncertain future after his recent arrest in Indianapolis. Once one of the more promising voices in the NFL broadcast booth, Sanchez now finds himself sidelined indefinitely as Fox Sports moves forward without him.Fox Sports announced its Week 7 NFL broadcast lineup, and Sanchez’s name was notably absent. The network has made no public statement about his return since confirming that the 38-year-old was injured on October 4 during a violent altercation outside an Indianapolis hotel. Sanchez, who had been scheduled to call the Colts–Raiders game that weekend, was replaced by Brady Quinn on short notice.According to reports, Sanchez was arrested following an incident with 69-year-old truck driver Perry Tole. Police allege that the altercation began after a dispute over a delivery truck parked near the hotel loading docks. Witness statements and a police affidavit suggest Sanchez, who appeared intoxicated, entered Tole’s vehicle without permission and physically blocked him. Tole responded by using pepper spray and later stabbing Sanchez in self-defense. Both men were hospitalized after the fight, with Sanchez suffering stab wounds to his upper torso and Tole sustaining a deep gash to his face.Quinn, who filled in for Sanchez that weekend, later told Sports Illustrated, “Not much sleep and mixed emotions. Obviously concerned for Mark’s health and the well-being of all those involved, but at the same time excited for the opportunity to call a game.”What began as a shocking on-the-job incident has since evolved into a complex legal battle. Sanchez was initially charged with three misdemeanors — battery resulting in injury, public intoxication, and unlawful entry of a motor vehicle. Prosecutors have since added a Level 5 felony battery charge, which carries a potential prison sentence of one to five years. Sanchez has pleaded not guilty to all charges.Adding to his troubles, both Sanchez and Fox Corporation are being sued by Tole, who claims the network failed to ensure its employee behaved “in a reasonable manner.” The lawsuit accuses Fox of negligence, alleging it should have known of Sanchez’s “unfitness” and “propensity for drinking and/or harmful conduct.”Sanchez, who joined Fox Sports in 2021 after a decade-long NFL career, had been a familiar face in the broadcast booth alongside Adam Amin. However, as legal proceedings continue, his return appears distant. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for next week, but for now, one thing is clear — Mark Sanchez’s once-promising broadcasting career hangs in the balance.Also Read: The woman behind Taylor Swift’s engagement ring reveals if she’d design a Super Bowl ring in future","Former NFL quarterback and Fox Sports analyst Mark Sanchez is facing an uncertain future after his recent arrest in Indianapolis.

Fans speculate as Tom Brady hints at “another roast” moment

Could Tom Brady be pulling a LeBron James-style business reveal ?

NFL icon Tom Brady is back in the spotlight, not for a comeback, but for a cryptic teaser that has his fans, followers, and even sports insiders buzzing. On Friday morning, the seven-time Super Bowl champion posted an Instagram video that immediately set off speculation about what’s coming on October 21.In the video, Brady referenced his viral Netflix roast from May 2024, a comedic spectacle that featured everyone from former teammates to Hollywood celebrities poking fun at his storied career and personal life. At the time, Brady admitted he had some regrets, particularly because his family was uncomfortable with certain jokes.But now, the retired quarterback seems to be leaning back into that energy. “You know what, I think I’m ready for another roast,” Brady said with a smirk. “I think I can handle it… you don’t think I can?”Fans instantly flooded the comments with guesses. “Didn’t he say the roast was one of the things he most regretted doing?” one user pointed out, while another joked, “No shot, prob promoting a new grille company or cooking show.” Some even took the word roast literally, suggesting Brady might be teasing a food-related venture: “My money is it has something to do with roasted meats lol.”Many believe Brady’s announcement could mirror LeBron James’ “Second Decision”, which recently turned out to be a marketing ploy for a business deal rather than a career move. With Brady’s growing list of ventures, from his TB12 brand to BRADY clothing and his minority ownership stake in the Las Vegas Raiders, fans suspect the same playbook might be in motion.Whether it’s another self-deprecating comedy special or a clever branding move, one thing is certain: Brady knows how to stir curiosity.

Kindred Lubeck’s inspiring journey from law office to fine jewelry fame





When Kindred Lubeck designed Taylor Swift’s stunning engagement ring, she never imagined it would turn her life into a fairy tale. Now, the talented jeweler behind the dazzling diamond might be setting her sights beyond wedding bands — and possibly toward creating a Super Bowl ring worthy of champions.Appearing on the Today show on October 17, Kindred Lubeck opened up about the “incredible honor” of crafting Taylor Swift’s breathtaking old mine cut diamond ring. The moment, she said, was nothing short of “surreal.” When host Willie Geist playfully asked if she’d ever design Super Bowl rings — a nod to Swift’s fiancé, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce — Lubeck didn’t hesitate. “I would!” she exclaimed. “I would! Absolutely, yes. ”Swift had previously shared that she immediately recognized Lubeck’s signature craftsmanship when Kelce proposed. “I had shown him a video like a year and a half ago,” the singer told Heart Breakfast. “When I saw the ring I [gasped] ... I was like, ‘I know who made this,’ and also, you listen to me!”For Lubeck, hearing Swift identify her work was a career-defining moment. “The fact that she recognized my work, that is such an incredible honor,” she told Today.“When I heard her say that, I thought that was the most exciting thing. This is something that you only dream of happening to you.”Before becoming one of the most talked-about jewelry designers in the world, Lubeck’s path looked very different. A psychology graduate from Florida State University, she once worked at a law firm — until she realized her true passion lay elsewhere. “Out of desperation, I swallowed my pride and asked my dad if he would give me part-time work until I found another job,” she told Voyage Jacksonville.That temporary job turned into a life-changing career. When the family business, Jewels by Lubeck, shut down during the pandemic, she used the time to master engraving — a skill that would later define her style. By 2023, she launched Artifex Fine Jewelry, offering one-of-a-kind rings that can cost over $38,000, and opened a New York studio in mid-2024.Grateful for her newfound success, Lubeck thanked her supporters after Swift’s engagement went public. “If someone says you can’t do something, you should prove them 110 percent wrong,” she said in an Instagram video. “If you have a dream, you should never, ever quit.”From a small workshop to the world stage — and maybe soon, the Super Bowl — Kindred Lubeck’s story shines as brightly as her diamonds.Also Read: Jennifer Lopez opens up about Super Bowl drama, says co-headlining with Shakira was “the worst idea ever”","Kindred Lubeck designed Taylor Swift’s stunning engagement ring.

Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson video leak sparks outrage



Jordon Hudson Caught Sh*t-Talking with Bill Belichick on Hot Mic | PTFO

NFL Films distances itself from the leaked footage



A new controversy has erupted around legendary coach Bill Belichick and his girlfriend Jordon Hudson after a behind-the-scenes video from his 2024 NFL Films show Coach surfaced online. The unearthed clip captured the couple’s private criticism of production staff, adding fuel to a saga that has kept Belichick in the headlines for months.The leaked video, discussed by Pablo Torre on his Pablo Torre Finds Out podcast, dates back to the early days of the 2024 NFL season. At the time, Belichick was working on Coach, a football analysis project featuring Matt Patricia and Michael Lombardi. The series was meant to explore tactical matchups in depth—but what fans didn’t see was the growing tension behind the scenes.In the now-viral clip, Hudson is seen expressing frustration about the show’s quality, particularly its graphics and set design. She questions, “How can they have four full-time graphics people and still mess it up?” Belichick, visibly unimpressed, replies, “They can’t do sh-t.” The conversation continues with both criticizing the production team before Belichick concludes, “The whole thing is ridiculous.According to Torre, the exchange was never meant to be public. The couple’s microphones had been left on, transmitting their private conversation live to a control room at NFL Films. “It was truly listened to live by an entire control room of people at NFL Films,” Torre revealed.The incident sheds light on the influence Hudson had on Belichick’s media projects. Her involvement extended beyond appearances—she reportedly had a say in creative and production decisions for the show.After the video’s emergence, speculation quickly pointed toward NFL Films as the possible source of the leak. However, the company swiftly issued a statement on The Pat McAfee Show, making it clear they had no role in the show’s production.""When this footage was captured, NFL Films did not produce Coach with Bill Belichick. NFL Films did not edit this show, NFL Films did not shoot the show, NFL Films did not and does not own the show. As a matter of convenience to him... NFL films allowed Coach Belichick and the production team from Underdog to use the studio for his Coach show because he was already here in his capacity as talent on Inside the NFL.""NFL Films has a longstanding relationship with Bill Belichick based on trust and mutual respect built over many years of working together. We have absolutely no reason to believe this footage leak came from NFL Films or from any employee of NFL Films.""Despite the denial, questions remain about who leaked the footage and why. Torre also noted that Lombardi, one of Belichick’s longtime collaborators, might have spread rumors about Hudson’s involvement in football operations—something she may not have known before the episode aired.While the truth behind the leak remains uncertain, one thing is clear: the fallout has once again placed Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson under an unforgiving public microscope.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld’s unseen Cabo bachelorette party photos reveal wild pre-wedding celebrations without Josh Allen",A behind-the-scenes video from Bill Belichick's 2024 NFL Films show surfaced online.

Singer and actress Jennifer Lopez has opened up about her headline-making remarks on the 2020 Super Bowl halftime show with Shakira , a performance that remains one of the most talked-about in recent years. Speaking on The Howard Stern Show this Thursday, Lopez revisited her earlier comments from her Netflix documentary Jennifer Lopez: Halftime, where she had called sharing the stage with another artist “the worst idea in the world. ”Jennifer Lopez revealed that her frustration wasn’t directed at Shakira but at the situation itself. “When the Super Bowl came to me, they said, ‘Well, why don't you share the stage with Shakira and Gloria Estefan?’ And Gloria said no. For me, it was always a dream to do it. You know, like my idols, like Madonna, Diana Ross, Prince... You wait your turn,” Lopez shared.For Lopez, the offer raised questions about how the U.S. music industry perceived Latin artists. “When they said, 'You're going to do it with Shakira or Gloria,' it was almost as if they thought a single Latin artist couldn't do it alone. That was more the issue for me,” she said, noting that both she and Shakira deserved solo shows.At that time, Lopez felt her opportunity to shine alone had been compromised. ""Shakira deserved to have hers (Super Bowl), too. I wanted my moment, my chance to do what I'd always dreamed of.”However, with time, her perspective evolved. “In hindsight, it was perfect. It was absolutely perfect. And I'm so proud of that Super Bowl and of having shared that stage with Shakira, because we represented something important at the time,” she reflected. The pair showcased Latin excellence to a global audience, celebrating culture, motherhood, and resilience.Lopez also highlighted the deeper message of her performance, which included a symbolic protest about immigrant children detained at the U.S. border. “I made a statement with the cages and the children in cages. There was a lot going on at the time, and we were able to shed a beautiful light on that,” she said.Addressing ongoing debates about Latin artists headlining major shows, Lopez defended Bad Bunny’s upcoming 2026 Super Bowl performance. “Why the hell shouldn't I sing at the Super Bowl? It's absurd. It's all crazy,” she remarked, applauding the NFL ’s growing commitment to cultural diversity.“I'm an artist who's all about projecting love, being love, putting that out into the universe,” Lopez added. “I applaud the NFL for saying, ‘Let's put this artist out there for everyone to see,’ because he's probably the biggest artist on the planet right now. That, to me, is a win for all of us.”The 2020 Super Bowl performance—featuring hits like Jenny from the Block, Hips Don’t Lie, and Whenever, Wherever—drew over 100 million viewers worldwide. Despite some post-show controversy, it remains a defining cultural moment that elevated Latin representation on one of America’s biggest stages.Also Read: Will Jennifer Lopez join Bad Bunny at the Super Bowl halftime show?
