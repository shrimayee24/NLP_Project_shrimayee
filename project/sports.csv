NEW DELHI: The Nigerian national football team found themselves in a distressing situation as they were reportedly stranded at an airport in Libya , devoid of food and water, mere 24 hours before their crucial match against the host nation.Libya, however, expressed their discontent, alleging that they were subjected to 'poor treatment' during their visit to Nigeria.As tensions escalate ahead of the return leg, Nigeria 's players have been left exasperated by their current predicament, with Leicester City midfielder Wilfred Ndidi going as far as to suggest that they were being held 'hostage' by their hosts.In the previous encounter between the two sides, which took place in Nigeria as part of the African Cup of Nations qualifiers, the Super Eagles emerged victorious with a narrow 1-0 margin, thanks to a late goal from Fissayo Dele-Bashiru.According to media reports, the Nigerian players and team officials were virtually held hostage for over 12 hours at Al Abraq International Airport , which was about three hours away by road to Benghazi , the venue of Tuesday's match against Libya.The plane, carrying both players and officials, was unexpectedly rerouted from its original destination of Benghazi to Al Abraq, a smaller airport primarily used for hajj operations, while in mid-flight.Upon landing at Al Abraq, the Nigerian team found themselves stranded without any support from the Libyan Football Federation . The host team neglected to make the necessary arrangements to transport the team to Benghazi, leaving them in a difficult position.The vehicle arranged for the trip by the officials of Super Eagles was also not allowed to access the airport further compounding the challenges faced by the Nigerian team.As a result, the Nigerian team withdrew from their Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Libya on Monday, according to captain William Troost-Ekong.","The Nigerian national football team were stranded at an airport in Libya.

NEW DELHI: In the lead-up to Wednesday's first Test match between India and New Zealand at M Chinnaswamy Stadium , head coach Gautam Gambhir emphasized the value of bowlers and the necessity of breaking the ""obsessed"" mentality of batters.In the longest format of cricket, during the last ten years, there has been a gradual transition from batsmen who spend an excessive amount of time to bowlers who are very skilled.But the recent Test match in Kanpur between India and Bangladesh served as a timely reminder of how red-ball cricket has evolved.India took a tack rarely seen in a Test match, going all out from the first over, even though they lost more than two days of play due to rain and a soggy outfield.The spinners completed a historic triumph for India by slicing 20 wickets, shocking Bangladesh.Ahead of the first Test match against New Zealand, Gambhir noted that the era has changed.According to Gambhir, victory isn't assured even if the hitters score a lot of runs. However, if the bowling unit takes 20 wickets, that team's triumph is all but assured.""That era is past. This is the era of bowlers. Batters only set up matches. This batsman-obsessed attitude of ours needs to end. If a batter even scores 1,000 runs, it doesn't guarantee victory. But if a bowler takes 20 wickets, then there is a 99 per cent guarantee that we will win the Test match,"" Gambhir said at a press conference in Bengaluru on Monday.""So if it is a Test match or any other format, bowlers win you matches and tournaments. In this era, we will talk more about bowlers compared to batters, and I hope this mindset changes,"" he added.In most cases, matches between the 1950s and 1990s concluded in a tie, even though batters were able to stay on the crease for longer than a day or two. However, the results that have been generated throughout time point to a shifting pattern in cricket.Pakistan recorded a score of more than 550 on the scoreboard during the most recent Test in Multan. Nevertheless, England overcame the odds, smashing 823/7, declared their inning, and the bowlers completed the task to secure an innings and 47 runs triumph.The match between the bat and the ball in Bengaluru will undoubtedly be a sight to witness, as India has a bowling team that combines skill and experience.","India head coach Gautam Gambhir says bowlers are the future of Test cricket. Batsmen need to break the ""obsessed"" mentality of batters, he says. India take on New Zealand in the first Test match in Bengaluru on Wednesday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114212929,imgsize-43238,width-400,resizemode-4/114212929.jpg"

Aidan Hutchinson Receives Prayers and Support From NFL World After Gruesome Leg Injury



In a devastating blow to the Detroit Lions , defensive end Aidan Hutchinson suffered a season-ending broken tibia during their victory over the Dallas Cowboys . The injury occurred in the third quarter of the game, where Hutchinson was actively pursuing a sack. The injury has sent shockwaves through the NFL world, with players and fans alike expressing their condolences and wishing Hutchinson a speedy recovery.Also Read: ""He's going to be down a little while"": Lions Coach Dan Campbell Addresses Aidan Hutchinson's Fractured Tibia, Shares Emotional Message After Injury Despite the Lions holding a substantial 34-6 lead early in the third quarter, Aidan Hutchinson continued to display his relentless effort on the field. The injury occurred during a play where he successfully recorded a sack—his 7.5th of the season in just five games. This performance further cemented his status as one of the league’s top defensive threats. His dominance, however, came to an abrupt halt, and the injury was deemed severe enough that the NFL broadcast decided against replaying the incident.The loss of Hutchinson is particularly hard for the Lions to accept, as he had been living up to every expectation and more since being drafted second overall in 2022. He was on pace to surpass his previous career-high of 11.5 sacks set during his Pro Bowl season in 2023, a feat he was just four sacks shy of achieving before his injury.Beyond his exceptional play, Hutchinson’s contributions extended into the locker room and the local community, making his absence even more impactful. His injury sent shockwaves throughout the NFL, with fellow stars like Micah Parsons, Tyreek Hill, and J.J. Watt sharing their condolences and wishing him a swift recovery after he was carted off the field.Hutchinson’s rise to NFL stardom has been nothing short of meteoric. In less than three full seasons, he had solidified his reputation as one of the league’s premier defensive players. After being drafted by the Lions in 2022, he immediately made his presence felt, recording 9.5 sacks as a rookie. By 2023, he earned his first Pro Bowl selection, posting 11.5 sacks and three forced fumbles. This season, Hutchinson continued to dominate, racking up 7.5 sacks before his unfortunate exit from Sunday’s game.The Lions, now standing at 4-1, have playoff aspirations this season, but Hutchinson’s absence will be a significant challenge for the team to overcome. His contributions were particularly notable during Detroit’s playoff run in 2023, where he recorded three sacks over three games, helping the Lions advance to the NFC Championship Game.Moving forward, Detroit will need a collective effort from their defense to compensate for Hutchinson’s loss. Players like Alim McNeil and Levi Onwuzurike are expected to take on increased roles in an effort to maintain the team’s defensive pressure. While the victory against Dallas boosted the Lions' record, the loss of Hutchinson casts a shadow over their future prospects.Also Read: Historic Home Streak Ends as Dallas Cowboys Stunned by Detroit Lions in 47-9 Defeat, Their Worst Home Defeat Under Jerry Jones","Detroit Lions defensive end Aidan Hutchinson suffered a season-ending broken tibia.

An unmitigated disaster for the Detroit Lions in Week 6 as star defensive end Aidan Hutchinson suffered a season-ending injury during the team's stomping of the Dallas Cowboys .

At his beloved

Chinnaswamy stadium

, venue of his first fourth innings heroics in 2012 vs

New Zealand

,

working hard to rediscover his game vs spin

BENGALURU: The noise surrounding Virat Kohli's struggle against spin has been mounting, only getting shriller as his ordinary numbers against tweakers has burgeoned. In the past 28 Test matches, Kohli has been dismissed by spinners on 21 occasions, with off-spinners doing the bulk of the damage.Like always, Kohli may have chosen to ignore the clatter, but given his penchant for detail and work ethic, he perhaps has been hard on himself. It showed on Monday at the M Chinnaswamy stadium when the former India skipper spent considerable time facing spinners in the nets. There were the odd deliveries where he second-guessed himself, but there were plenty of assured cuts and hoists over the infield, all of them executed with impeccable footwork.While making his mark in red-ball cricket as a youngster, Kohli found comfort at this venue. Back in 2012 against New Zealand, he clobbered a century (103) and an unconquered 51, runs that eventually proved crucial in India's five-wicket win.Staying with back stories, over the past eight years, Kohli has played against New Zealand in four home matches and, barring Trent Boult and Neil Wagner , none of the pacers managed to dismiss him. But he has faltered against the Kiwis' assembly line of spinners - Jeetan Patel, Ajaz Patel, Mitchell Santner and Rachin Ravindra .The recent series against Bangladesh again underscored Kohli's woes against spin. In four innings, he returned 99 runs and fell to off-spin twice. The tendency to play early or play against the spin has done him no favours.If ever Kohli needed a comfort zone, then this venue must offer that. This, after all, is his 'home' ground with Royal Challengers Bengaluru and the odds are that it could help him rediscover his mojo against spin.As Kohli looks to climb back among the runs, he's found a staunch supporter in head coach Gautam Gambhir . Speaking on his stuttering top-order bat, Gambhir said on Monday, ""You don't keep judging people after every game. It's not fair on them. It's a sport. People fail all the time. Everyone doesn't have the best days every day. My job is to back players and select the best playing 11.""Another subplot to the Kohli story is milestones. The 35-year-old is 53 runs shy of 9,000 runs, yet the 10,000 landmark is already being spoken about.While Gambhir didn't take the milestone bait, he outlined Kohli's hunger to excel.""He is a world-class cricketer,"" Gambhir said. ""He has performed for such a long period. And he is as hungry as when he made his debut. That is what makes him a world-class cricketer. I am sure that he will be hungry to get runs in this series, and probably moving forward to Australia as well. Once he starts scoring, he can be very consistent. I'm sure that he will be looking forward to these three Test matches and the series in Australia.""","Virat Kohli has been dismissed by spinners on 21 occasions in past 28 Test matches.

The Pakistan women's team collapsed like a house of cards on Monday while chasing a victory and a place in the T20 World Cup semifinals, getting bowled out for just 56 against New Zealand in the penultimate group match of the tournament.After restricting New Zealand to a manageable 110 for 6, Pakistan first slipped to 28 for 5 and then crashed from 52 for 6 to 56 all out in 11.4 overs in an effort to win quickly to improve their net run rate and secure a semifinal berth.However, it's Australia and New Zealand who reached the semis from Group A, while India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka were eliminated from the race.The win upset former Pakistan players and cricket experts, including ex-batsman Basit Ali .""It seemed like Pakistan were playing badminton, not cricket,"" said the 53-year-old Basit. ""Pakistan women's cricket chairperson is a badminton player. Badminton ki player cricket ki chairperson.""Tania Mallick, the Head of Women's Cricket in Pakistan, is a former national badminton champion.""I haven't seen such a team. You may lose 10 out of 10 matches, but I haven't seen a team dropping catches like that,"" said Basit about the butter fingers of the Pakistan team.""Mashallah, 11-12 catches chhorey, easy. Dolly, dolly, dolly!"" he said in sarcastic tone in a video on his YouTube channel.Basit praised Pakistan captain Fatima Sana who had lost her father a few days ago and went on to contribute the most runs (21) in her team's embarrassing collapse.Basit criticised the team's shot-selection and the drastic changes in the batting order in an effort to score quickly to win at the earliest.""Who got out on a good ball? Muneeba (Ali) played a cross-batted shot. They were getting run-out, playing bad shots. Sana Fatima lost her father recently; she played the best knock,"" he said.Extending his sarcasm to Pakistan men's defeat in the first Test against England despite scoring more than 500 in their first innings, Basit said that defeat possibly shook the women's team also.""I think the way Pakistan lost the first Test, it shocked the women's team as well and they too couldn't play...We know our team is weak, everybody knows that. But to lose like that...56 all out in 11.4 overs. It hurt me, personally,"" he said.""The way they changed the batting order, it was beyond me to comprehend.""","Pakistan women's team collapsed like a house of cards on Monday while chasing a victory and a place in the T20 World Cup semifinals.

Rachin Ravindra made his Test debut in 2021 against India in Kanpur, but the first Test of the series beginning in Bengaluru on Wednesday will hold a special place for the India-origin all-rounder, as it's the city from where his family belongs.""I guess it makes it extra significant because of the family connection,"" said Ravindra, who will turn 25 in November.The promising start to his international career has seen Ravindra scoring 672 runs in 9 Tests at an average of 50.98, including one century, when he scored 240, and three half-centuries.He has also played 25 ODIs and 23 T20Is.""It's amazing and I am very proud of my Indian heritage and to be able to play where a lot of my family is based is something very special,"" he said at the pre-match press conference.""There will be a bunch of them (family members) in the crowd, and I know dad will be here watching.

NEW DELHI: What's India's greatest Test victory of all time? Every cricket fan has a personal favourite. Unlikely triumphs, wrenched out at Oval 1971, Port of Spain 1976, Kolkata 2001 , Brisbane 2021, and Kanpur 2024 too, for its audacity of imagination, are likely to figure in most lists.But for those of a certain vintage, India's nerve-jangling two-wicket win over Bobby Simpson 's Australia exactly 60 years ago-Oct 15, 1964 on Dussehra day-at Bombay's Brabourne Stadium ranks among the very best.""It was the most exciting Test seen in India since the 1948 (India vs West Indies in Bombay) one, some said the most exciting ever…Some Indians thought the Test compared with the tied Test (Australia vs West Indies in Brisbane, 1960),"" wrote Mihir Bose in his masterly chronicle, A History of Indian Cricket . The first line of The Times of India report summed up the national mood: ""Victory at last-And what a victory!""""It was a seesaw game,"" recalled Chandu Borde , regarded as the spine of India's middle-order in the 1960s. The pithy summary is precise. The Test, played on a freshly relaid pitch, wasn't about wildly fluctuating fortunes; it was a match of mini tremors and slow shifts. Nobody scored a century, nobody claimed a fiver in this Test won by collective enterprise and true grit.India had a bunch of notable performers. Captain MAK Pataudi entertained with 86 and 53. Vijay Manjrekar's 59 and 39 were vital. Leg-spinner BS Chandrashekhar, the other surviving member from the playing XI, scalped eight (4/50 and 4/73). And left-arm spinner Bapu Nadkarni's contributions with bat (34 & 0) and ball (2/65 and 4/33) were critical. But in the end, it was Borde and keeper KS Indrajitsinhji, who became heroes and were ""loaded with garlands"" and hoisted on shoulders by spectators.""The crowd rushed to the wicket, lifted and carried us to the pavilion,"" said Borde , now 90, on phone. He remained undefeated on 30 while forging a match-winning 32 run ninth-wicket stand with Indrajitsinhji. The keeper stonewalled the Aussie attack for 41 minutes contributing a priceless 3.In the post-match melee, someone filched Borde's brand new willow. ""One person took my bat and ran away. It was the bat I used to play in Lancashire (league). It was an English willow. That was stolen from me,"" Borde had told this reporter in 2020.The crowd's behaviour needs to be understood in the way the Test unfolded. Australia scored 320 batting first, India replying with 341. When the visitors were bowled out for 274 in their second knock, Pataudi's men-Dilip Sardesai, ML Jaisimha, Salim Durani , Hanumant Singh, among others-needed 254 to overhaul. India had never scored so many runs for a win in the fourth innings.All looked lost when six wickets fell for 122. Two of them were night watchmen, but even 50% of the target hadn't been reached yet. Then the improbable began to happen. Pataudi and Manjrekar put on 93 for the seventh wicket, before both fell within 10 runs of each other.Now it was left to Borde and Indrajitsinhji to take India home. ""There was a lot of tension on the ground. But I was okay on the pitch. And Indrajitsinhji gave me good support,"" said Borde.Every run was cheered. ""Though the faint-hearted could scarcely bear to look, Borde was playing his normal game. With seven runs wanted, offie (Tom) Veivers bowled an over-pitched ball which he off-drove for four, the next ball he drove wide of mid-on and India had won,"" wrote Edward Docker in ""History of Indian Cricket"".In 55 Tests, Borde scored 3,061 runs. He smashed five centuries, an unbeaten 177 against Pakistan in Madras being his highest. His leg-breaks fetched him 52 wickets. But it was the game changing cameo which earned him the adulation that every sportsperson dreams of.",Chandu Borde and KS Indrajitsinhji were hoisted on shoulders by spectators.

Indian coach

also wants bowlers to get their due

BENGALURU: Over the next nine months, India play 13 Test matches, starting with the series opener against New Zealand beginning Wednesday. While the focus will understandably be on workload management, Indian head coach Gautam Gambhir believes adaptability will play a huge role in the brand of cricket Rohit Sharma & Co. play.""We want to be a team that can make 400 runs in a day and bat for two days to draw.And that's called growth and adaptability. That's called Test cricket . If you play the same way, then it's not growth. We have a lot of individuals in the dressing room who can bat for two days. So, ultimately, the first motive is to win the match,"" said Gambhir, who began his red ball journey as a coach with a 2-0 series win over Bangladesh.India walked the talk against Bangladesh in Kanpur. With the first three days truncated due to rain, India pulled off a convincing seven-wicket win with plenty to spare.The former Indian opener also stressed on players being expressive on the field. ""We want players to go out there and play the natural game. If they can get 400-500 runs in a day, why not? We will play it that way. High-risk, high reward; High-risk, high failure. There will be days when we'll get bundled out for 100 and we'll take it. And we'll continue to back our players to play high-risk cricket. That's how we want to play and that's how we want to keep the game going forward,"" he elaborated.India, who are on an 18 Test match-winning spree at home since 2013, will start favourites against the struggling Black Caps , but Gambhir warned against complacency.""New Zealand is a completely different challenge. They're a very good team with high-quality players. They've got players who can hurt us and do the job for them as well. So, we respect them, but we don't fear anyone. We need to be switched on from ball one. And that is the responsibility of the support staff to keep the players switched on whether we are batting or bowling first,"" he added.Gambhir also called for a change in attitude toward bowlers and their contribution to a team.""This is the time of the bowlers. Batsmen only set up matches. Our batsman-obsessed attitude must end. If a batsman makes a thousand runs, there is no guarantee that he will win the Test match. But if a bowler takes 20 wickets, there is 99% chance of winning. So, I hope that this era or this time, we will talk more about bowlers as compared to batters. And I hope that this mindset will change in the future,"" said Gambhir.","India coach Gautam Gambhir believes adaptability will play a huge role in the brand of cricket Rohit Sharma & Co. play.

While his thoughts have been lauded by Basit Ali , the former Pakistan batsman also cautioned Zaman about the consequences he might face.Former captain Babar was dropped from the Test squad after another failure in the team's defeat in the first match of the three-Test home series against England.Pakistan scored over 500 runs in their first innings at Multan but still went on to lose the match by an innings and 47 runs. The defeat led to the exclusion of Babar, wicketkeeper Sarfaraz Ahmed and fast bowlers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah from the squad for the second and third Test.Talking about the development on his YouTube channel, Basit said: ""Fakhar Zaman has been served show-cause notice, which means that coming days are not going to be good for him because of the mafia that sits in the PCB.""The 53-year-old former batsman went on to advise Zaman. ""I think Fakhar should talk to chairman Mohsin Naqvi. Otherwise, these guys will create problems for him,"" he said.Following Babar's exclusion from the Test squad, Zaman related the situation to Virat Kohli's lean phase and that India didn't drop their star batsman despite him losing his high-scoring touch.""It's concerning to hear suggestions about dropping Babar Azam.

There is still time to avoid pressing the panic button; we should focus on safeguarding our key players rather than undermining them.""""Ladka toh boht bindaas hai, dil mein nahi rakhta baat, saaf bol deta hai (he is a brave guy, doesn't keep things inside, voices himself out clearly),"" said Basit about Zaman's comments.Zaman has been instructed to respond to the show cause notice by October 21, with his comments considered a breach of his player contract with the PCB.",Fakhar Zaman has been issued a show-cause notice by the Pakistan Cricket Board.

Pakistan's NRR is not very encouraging and at this stage it looks like India or New Zealand will advance.Indian cricketer Mona Meshram , who has played 26 ODIs and 11 T20Is for India so far, is confident that Pakistan will edge out New Zealand on Monday and help India reach the semifinals.""This will be the first time when India will be cheering for Pakistan.

Please, Pakistan, go and beat New Zealand,"" said Mona in an exclusive chat with TimesofIndia.com.""I want India to reach the semifinals. I am confident of a Pakistan win against New Zealand. Pakistan has a massive fan following in the UAE, and this will boost their confidence,"" she added.Chasing a target of 152 on Sunday, India fell short, finishing at 142 for 9. Captain Harmanpreet Kaur remained unbeaten on 54 off 47 balls but her late surge wasn't enough to overhaul the target. Despite the loss, India remains in second place on the points table with two wins and two losses, though their NRR has dropped to 0.322, still ahead of third-placed New Zealand.Australia, on the other hand, became the first team from the group to advance to the last four with an unbeaten run, registering four wins in as many games.Harmanpreet did press on the accelerator in the second half of the innings but didn’t receive enough support from the other end.""Again, I want to highlight that Deepti has the ability to rotate the strike really well. If Richa had batted ahead of Deepti, it would have made a big difference. Richa can accelerate the run rate, while Deepti can rotate the strike effectively. India needed a batter who could hit hard in that situation,"" explained Mona..""India is the only side that can give a fight to Australia. Both are strong teams, and India put up a very good fight against Australia. The only lapse I could see was that Richa Ghosh should have come in to bat ahead of Deepti Sharma . That move would have made a significant difference for India. But overall, India fought really well.""Harmanpreet played a captain's knock, but she didn’t get support from the other end.

Was intent missing from the Indian batters?""I don’t think the intent was missing. If you look at Shafali, she was playing the way she usually does. Australia planned really well for Smriti Mandhana . They knew that if Smriti settled in, she could destroy them. It seems like Australia had something specific planned against Smriti, and it looked like she was trapped by them.

BENGALURU: Back in 2021, they were the first World Test Championship winners. One of the highlights of that 2019-21 cycle was New Zealand 's consistency. A trait which has been missing from the Black Caps' campaign this season.In the current WTC cycle, which ends in June next year, New Zealand are placed sixth with three wins and five losses are already out of title contention.While the New Zealand bowlers bowled extensively during their 0-2 loss to Sri Lanka recently, the batsmen have made heavy weather of every challenge, stumbling miserably against spin in particular. Hence, it is hardly surprising that New Zealand's young gun Rachin Ravindra stressed on the need to negate spin twins Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja ""India have consistent bowlers who bowl in an area for a long period of time. You see the two spinners who play consistently -Ashwin and Jadeja-they are two very accomplished bowlers, and they can bat too,"" pointed out Rachin.Outlining India's dominance at home, the all-round said, ""They're consistent and good to battle, especially in this part of the world. Obviously, we know how good India are in their own conditions. It shows how hard it is for a team to come and win here. So, it's difficult,"" conceded Rachin.In the build-up to the series New Zealand suffered a huge blow with Kane Williamson out of the initial part of the series. ""We're not sure. I guess he (Williamson) will play it by ear. Some news will come out soon enough,"" is all Rachin had to offer on Williamson's availability.Although born and raised in Wellington, Rachin shares a special relationship with Bengaluru-his parents' hometown.On the 'home' Test, Rachin said, ""This Test is extra significant for me because of the family connection. I was born and brought up in Wellington I'm a Kiwi all the way, but I'm very proud of my Indian heritage. To play where a lot of my family is based is something special. There will be a bunch of them in the crowd. I know my dad will be here watching the game.""",Rachin Ravindra says New Zealand need to negate spin twins Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindr Jadeja.

Brief Scores (In Guwahati):

Looking down the barrel at the end of Day 3, hosts Assam did a wonderful turnaround on the final day of their Ranji Trophy Group D opener to stave off defeat at the hands of Jharkhand in Guwahati on Monday.Trailing Jharkhand’s first innings total by 51 runs at stumps on Sunday after following on, Assam batters pulled off a stunning comeback to reach 355 at tea on the day.In process, the home side set Ishan Kishan ’s boys a 175-run target for an outright victory, which looked to be tough task with only the last session left.Jharkhand, led by an explosive captain, tried their best to push for the win with Kishan (16 off 12 balls) coming out to open the innings with Nazim Siddiquie (3). But both were dismissed in quick succession in the third and fourth over, respectively. No. 3 Virat Singh (27* off 27) and Kolkata Knight Riders all-rounder Anukul Roy (24 off 16) put up 47 runs in six overs before the latter lost his stumps to Assam pacer Mukhtar Hussain in the first ball of 11th over with the scoreboard reading 74/3.This led the Jharkhand camp to shake hands with their opponents thinking the target – still 101 to get from there – is not reachable in the remaining overs of the day.Earlier, Assam’s batting was led by their captain Denish Das ’s fighting 75, Akash Sengupta ’s 92 and Mrinmoy Dutta ’s 47-run cameo at No. 10. Sibsankar Roy could add only two to his unbeaten score of 15 but Das carried on from his 29 to reach 75 off 149 balls. But it was Sengupta and Dutta’s 88-run stand for the ninth wicket that took the game away from Jharkhand, who were in an advantageous position till the third day.Jharkhand take home three points by the virtue of first innings lead while Assam had to be content with just one point, but avoiding loss would give them much solace before the next game.Jharkhand 361 & 74/3 (Virat Singh 27, Anukul Roy 24; Mukhtar Hussain 2/28).

If from Rajasthan no batsman accelerated the innings, from Pondicherry the bowlers were late to trigger a collapse on the final day of their Ranji Trophy 2024-25 opener at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium on Monday.The hosts, with a first innings lead of 43 runs, finished with three points while the visitors had to contend with a single point.Chasing a tricky 239 on the last day, Rajasthan opener Abhijeet Tomar (87 off 149 balls) and wicketkeeper batsman Kunal Singh Rathore (59 off 126 balls), who was promoted to the third spot, slowly but steadily took the team closer to the target. But that was not enough to win the game and the match ended when Rajasthan were 19 runs short of the target.Resuming at the overnight score of 207/6, Pondicherry finished at 281 all out with a major chunk of runs coming from Aman Khan’s (55 from 116 balls) bat.Rajasthan’s left-hand batsman Mahipal Lomror who looked off-colour with the bat, was effective with the ball and played his part in folding Pondicherry’s second innings. He recorded figures of 4.5-0-15-3.Coming out to bat for the second time, Rajasthan's Tomar and Rathore collaced 138 runs in 236 balls before Rathore stepped out and missed the ball completely and was stumped off left-arm spinner Sagar Udeshi.At that point of the match, Rajasthan were 178/2 in 50.3 overs, requiring 61 more but Pondicherry had triggered a collapse. In the subsequent over, off-spinner Fabid Ahmed with his double strike, cleaning up a well-settled Tomar and Mahipal Lomror (3 off 4 balls), pushed the hosts on the back foot.Nervousness was palpable on both sides. But after Rajasthan skipper Deepak Hooda (17 off 21 balls) was run-out, surviving the remaining overs of the day became a task. By the 60th over, the hosts were 220/7 and the match ended because of bad light.Effectiveness of spinners made Pondicherry sense victory, but given the situation, they were left to rue the poor visibility that stopped the game.Tomar, Rathore played well: Pondicherry captain Arun Kartik applauded Tomar and Rathore’s effort, but also rued the lost opportunity of winning the match. “When we came out to bat, we thought 220-230 was a winning total. But the way Rajasthan opener and No. 3 batter batted, they did a tremendous job. On the last day it’s never easy. When that second wicket fell, the next five wickets fell in no time. They both played a great game.”He then added, “I wanted to bowl the spinners but the light was not conducive and the match had to end.”","Rajasthan's Abhijeet Tomar and wicketkeeper batsman Kunal Singh Rathore took the team closer to the target.

However, a middle-order collapse saw them folding up for 311 after being placed strongly at 212 for two at one stage.While Gharami got 90, Shahbaz Ahmed played a useful knock of 44.

Coach Mauricio Pochettino made a successful debut in charge of the United States, leading them to a 2-0 friendly win over Panama on Saturday.Pochettino, who left Premier League side Chelsea in May after one season in charge, was appointed last month to replace Gregg Berhalter, following his dismissal after a humiliating early exit from the 2024 Copa America .The new boss spent much of the first half on the sidelines giving instructions to his team, who were unable to find the back of the net despite threatening chances, the closest coming from former Chelsea striker Christian Pulisic , whose shot after a quick breakaway was blocked by goalkeeper Orlando Mosquera.Pulisic, however, found his rhythm and showed glimpses of his scintillating start to the season with AC Milan when he delivered a fine cross for Yunus Musah to finish with aplomb four minutes after the break.Goalkeeper Matthew Turner helped the Americans maintain their advantage, denying efforts by Yoel Barcenas and Jose Rodriguez as Panama failed to equalise, and substitute Ricardo Pepi put the icing on the cake with a late goal in stoppage time.Having won his first game in charge, Pochettino will be looking to continue that streak when the U.S. travel to Guadalajara to take on Mexico on Tuesday.",Mauricio Pochettino made a successful debut in charge of the United States.

India are still without a win in 2024, Manolo Marquez is yet to taste success after three games with the national team, yet the 1-1 away draw against Vietnam in an international friendly on Saturday was one of its better games over the last year.Bui Vi Hao expectedly put Vietnam ahead after 38 minutes at the Thien Trưong Stadium in Nam Dịnh, but India fought back with a goal from Farukh Choudhary (’58) in the second session.The visitors were under pressure in the last quarter but held on for a morale boosting draw with two players -- Aakash Sangwan and Lalrinliana Hnamte – making their national team debuts.The last time both teams faced each other, India were thrashed 3-0.A major part of the credit for the draw should go to goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu . The India captain watched in disbelief as the ball hit his leg and sailed inside in the first half. But for most part, he was simply unbeatable. He proved it with multiple saves, including an early penalty, and a stunning reflex late in the game. When the ball did move past him, Anwar Ali – another impressive performer – came to the rescue with a goalline clearance towards the closing stages.Farukh, too, deserves appreciation. Left out in the cold after his last game in October 2021 for India, Manolo handpicked the Chennaiyin forward after his impressive showing in the first three games for his club in the ISL. He didn’t disappoint and was lively with his movements. The first attempt on goal came from his left foot, a powerful drive from outside the box that went straight to the keeper.Another attempt from an acute angle, after Brandon Fernandes had cleverly picked him inside the box with a no-look pass, forced a low save from the goalkeeper, using his legs.Higher-ranked and technically superior Vietnam were the better side in the first half and forced mistakes from the India defenders. The pressure finally paid off in the 38th minute, when a clearance off a Vietnam corner fell to Vi Hao, whose attempt deflected off Anwar, then Gurpreet’s leg, before rolling in, despite a desperate dive.India are not known for their comebacks, particularly when playing away, but this team hit differently in the second session. It was midfielder Suresh Singh who created the goal out of nowhere: he sent a long ball from India’s own half that evaded Vietnam captain Que Ngoc Hai and Farukh showed remarkable composure to lob the ball with his left foot, over the stranded goalkeeper.The last time Farukh scored was against Nepal in Sep 2021. A month later, he played his last international game.Vietnam had chances to register a win at a venue they have won their last two games. India’s defence at times was brittle and were saved the blushes by Gurpreet’s inspired form.Only if Liston Colaco thought and finished better, India could have killed it on the counter in stoppage time.",Bui Vi Hao expectedly put Vietnam ahead after 38 minutes. India fought back with a goal from Farukh Choudhary (’58) in the second session. Aakash Sangwan and Lalrinliana Hnamte made their national team debuts.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114177861,imgsize-63610,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/114177861.jpg"

Manolo Marquez will have to wait for his first win as India head coach as his team played out a 1-1 draw in an entertaining international football friendly match against Vietnam here on Saturday. Vietnam took the lead in the 38th minute through Nguyen Hoang Duc before Farukh Choudhary equalised in the 53rd minute at the Thien Truong Stadium , around 100 km from Hanoi.In Marquez's two matches as head coach so far, India drew against Mauritius and lost 0-3 to Syria in the Intercontinental Cup in Hyderabad last month.Ranked 116th, Vietnam are 10 spots higher than India (126th) in the FIFA rankings .In an eventful first half, India goalkeeper and captain Gurpreet Singh Sandhu stopped a penalty kick awarded to Vietnam in the 10th minute after Rahul Bheke fouled a home side attacker. Vietnam captain Que Ngoc Hai's shot, however, went straight to Sandhu.Two minutes before that, Choudhary was let free in an Indian attack but his left-footer from just outside the box was stopped by Vietnam goalie Nguyen Filip.Vietnam were on the ascendency as the match progressed and Nguyen Van Toan's shot in the 17th minute went just wide off the mark.In the 27th minute, India also got a chance but again Choudhary's left-footed shot from a difficult angle off a pass from Brandon Fernandes could not beat the Vietnam goalkeeper.Chau Ngoc Quans almost gave Vietnam the lead in the 32nd minute when he outsmarted an Indian defender with his turn and his left-footed curler beat Sandhu but the ball went wide of the post by few inches.Vietnam's goal eventually came six minutes later. Bui Vi Hao's volley from inside the box deflected from an Indian defender and Gurpreet's outstretched leg was able to touch the ball but not enough to send it out of harm's way.All Nguyen Hoang Duc had to do was just push the ball into the open net from the goal-line.India played much better in the second half. They had periods of dominance and also found the equaliser in the 53rd minute.Defender Anwar Ali sent a long aerial ball from near the centre line and Choudhary won an aerial duel with Vietnam captain Que Ngoc Hai rather easily and he chipped the ball over an onrushing goalie Nguyen Filip into the empty net.Ten minutes later, Lallianzuala Chhangte 's chip into the Vietnam box almost found Choudhary's feet but the home side goalkeeper was able to lay his hand on the ball.India called the shots in the initial period of the second half and the Blue Tigers rattled the home team's defence quite often. In the meantime, Choudhary was substituted by Edmund Lalrindika.In the 71st minute, Chhangte's shot took a deflection and went out for a corner.But from there on, Vietnam came back strongly and dictated terms in the last 15 minutes. They created a series of scoring chances but could not convert any of them.In the 79th minute, Sandhu made a brilliant reflex save to deny Van Vu's snap shot from inside the box.Three minutes later, central defender Anwar Ali made a goal-line save as he headed out a goal-bound shot.Originally, India were to play in a tri-Nation tournament but Lebanon pulled out, citing difficulties in flying out of the country due to the ongoing crisis at home. The tournament was planned in the FIFA international match window from October 7-15.India were earlier scheduled to play against Vietnam on October 9 and against Lebanon on October 12 before Lebanon's pulling out left them to play just one match.",Vietnam took the lead in the 38th minute through Nguyen Hoang Duc. Farukh Choudhary equalised in the 53rd minute at the Thien Truong Stadium. India goalkeeper and captain Gurpreet Singh Sandhu stopped a penalty kick awarded to Vietnam in the 10th minute.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114174489,imgsize-49818,width-400,resizemode-4/114174489.jpg"

Shanghai, Oct 13, 2024 -Novak Djokovic insisted Sunday that he plans ""to compete and play next season"" despite suffering another loss at the hands of world number one Jannik Sinner .The 37-year-old Serb, the holder of a men's record 24 Grand Slam titles , went down 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 to the Italian in the final of the Shanghai Masters .However, Djokovic said he has no intention of following career-long rival Rafael Nadal into retirement even though he endured by his own admission ""one of the worst-performing seasons in terms of results"".""I don't know what the future brings, I'll just try to kind of go with the flow to see how I feel in a given moment but I still plan to compete and play next season,"" he told reporters.Djokovic failed to add to his Grand Slam haul in 2024 as Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz , who claimed the French Open and Wimbledon titles, took possession of the sport's major honours.However, Djokovic was crowned Olympic champion , winning an emotional roller-coaster of a final against Alcaraz in Paris in August. That was his 99th career title.Sunday's loss left him frustratingly short of becoming just the third man after Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer to win 100 titles.""It's not a live-or-die type of goal for me, I think I've achieved all of my biggest goals in my career,"" he said.""Right now it's really about Slams and about still seeing how far I can kind of push the bar for myself.""Djokovic hailed Sinner who at 23 is 14 years his junior. His title in Shanghai was his seventh of the year.""He's very solid from the forehand and backhand, doesn't make too many mistakes, and just tries to take away the time from the opponent,"" said Djokovic.""That's something that reminds me of myself throughout my career, that's what I've done for so many years consistently, playing fast-paced tennis , taking away time from the opponent, kind of suffocating the opponent in a certain way.""","Novak Djokovic says he plans ""to compete and play next season"" The Serb lost 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 to Jannik Sinner in the final of the Shanghai Masters. The 37-year- old Serb is the holder of a men's record 24 Grand Slam titles.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114195001,imgsize-33394,width-400,resizemode-4/114195001.jpg"

The Paris Olympics champion beat No. 51-ranked Wang Xinyu 6-3, 6-4. Sabalenka will be bidding for her fourth title of the season, which includes the Australian Open andU.S. Open .The Belarussian's 16th straight victory at Wuhan ended Gauff's own recent win streak at nine, including the China Open title last week. But it looked anything but certain for Sabalenka as she crashed 6-1 in the opening set.""In the first set she was just crushing it,"" Sabalenka said. ""Whatever she was doing, everything was flying in. Everything was so aggressive. I didn't have much opportunities.""In a fight between the last two U.S. Open champions, Gauff led by a break early in the second but Sabalenka responded to pull level at 4-4 and saved a break point on serve to take a 5-4 lead.Serving to stay in the set, Gauff was broken as Sabalenka hit a lunging forehand volley to force a deciding set.The Belarussian carried her momentum into the third, extending her streak to seven games for a 3-0 lead. Gauff fought back to level at 4-4, but Sabalenka held strong to halt Gauff's run.Sabalenka broke once more after Gauff hit her season-worst 21st double fault on match point, ending the 2 1/2-hour match.""I know what she's going through. This is really difficult,"" said Sabalenka, who had issues on her serve in the past. ""But I know that if she'll be able to overcome this serve situation, I'm pretty sure she's going to be one of the greatest players.""","Jannik Sinner beats Novak Djokovic 7-6 (4), 6-3 to win Shanghai Masters.

Belarussian will face seventh-ranked Zheng Qinwen in the final.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114189121,imgsize-31594,width-400,resizemode-4/114189121.jpg"
