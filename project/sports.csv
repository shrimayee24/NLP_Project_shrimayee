Chilling 911 call details emerge as Cleveland Browns rookie Quinshon Judkins faces domestic violence charge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/chilling-911-call-details-emerge-as-cleveland-browns-rookie-quinshon-judkins-faces-domestic-violence-charge/articleshow/122532795.cms,"Photo by Nick Cammett/Getty Images

Police report and 911 audio allege Cleveland Browns rookie Quinshon Judkins punched girlfriend, leaving bruises and lasting pain

What the domestic violence allegations mean for Quinshon Judkins’ NFL future

“I still have visible bruises and evidence on my body of the event.” Those chilling words were spoken by the girlfriend of Cleveland Browns rookie running back Quinshon Judkins to a police dispatcher during a 911 call made on July 12 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The newly released audio paints a grim picture of pain and fear in the days following what authorities describe as a violent encounter. As the Browns’ second-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft faces a misdemeanor battery charge over the alleged domestic violence incident, questions swirl about his future in the NFL, the team’s response, and the broader issue of player conduct in professional sports.The incident that led to Quinshon Judkins’ arrest reportedly took place in the early hours of July 8, 2025, in Broward County, Florida, but it wasn’t until July 12 that police took him into custody. According to the police report, it all began at Fort Lauderdale International Airport, where Judkins, 21 years old and fresh off his second-round draft selection, allegedly lost his temper after reading text exchanges between his girlfriend and her family members.Police say Judkins confronted her, telling her, “Oh, wow, I can’t believe you” and “I’m so done with you,” before the situation escalated after they left the airport in a vehicle.The report alleges that while the woman tried to explain herself, Judkins “punched” her in the “mouth/chin area with a closed fist.” She later moved to the back seat of the car, but Judkins allegedly “turned around while he was driving and struck her additional times in the left arm and thigh. ”Their history added context for authorities: the couple had “resided together as if a family” from May through December 2024, separated in late 2024, and only rekindled their relationship in June 2025.The most striking details come from the woman’s own words in the 911 call, recorded on July 12 at the Fort Lauderdale Police Department’s temporary headquarters and released by TMZ. “I had a high-profile male that I was in a relationship with put his hands on me,” she told the dispatcher. “I still have visible bruises and evidence on my body of the event. … I am still in pain and I have a lot more of my story to tell.”Judkins had his first court appearance on Sunday morning, following his Saturday arrest. When asked for comment on the allegations, the Cleveland Browns issued a brief statement saying they are “aware and gathering information” on the matter, leaving his standing with the team uncertain as the legal process unfolds.As Quinshon Judkins faces these serious allegations, the spotlight is now on the Browns’ response and the NFL’s ongoing challenge in addressing domestic violence among its players. The detailed police report and haunting 911 audio highlight the woman’s continued pain and the gravity of the charges he now faces. Fans, team officials, and the league itself will be watching closely to see whether accountability and transparency guide the next steps in this disturbing case.Also Read: Kansas City Chiefs show out as Patrick Mahomes leads star-studded support for unbeaten current","Cleveland Browns rookie Quinshon Judkins faces a misdemeanor battery charge over the alleged domestic violence incident.

Duke celebrates the unbreakable bond between Cooper Flagg and Kon Knueppel at the Summer League



In a league full of competition and bright lights, one of the most heartwarming moments from the NBA Summer League came from a simple courtside interaction. When Cooper Flagg, the No. 1 overall pick of the Dallas Mavericks, reunited with his former Duke teammate and roommate Kon Knueppel before their teams clashed in Las Vegas, it was a brief but emotional exchange that left fans talking and Flagg’s mother, Kelly Bowman Flagg, smiling.Though Cooper Flagg was sidelined in street clothes, he still made his presence felt with a short, sincere moment before the Dallas Mavericks vs Charlotte Hornets tipoff. He approached Knueppel, now with the Hornets after being selected fourth overall, and the two shared a quick dap and a smile. The embrace was a callback to their days at Duke and a preview of the respect they’ll carry into their NBA careers.It was the first time the two had met in person since draft night, nearly three weeks prior. Kelly Bowman Flagg, Cooper’s mother, was quick to react on social media after seeing the clip.“Brothers forever,” she reacted.The bond between Flagg and Knueppel has always been evident, but seeing it continue to shine under the NBA spotlight brought a touching layer of humanity to the Summer League showdown.While Flagg didn’t suit up for the game, Dallas had decided to shut him down for the remainder of the Summer League, Knueppel made sure the moment still belonged to Duke. The Hornets’ rookie delivered his best performance of the summer, posting 16 points, 10 rebounds, and 4 assists in Charlotte’s dominant 87-69 victory. His hustle on both ends helped improve the Hornets to a 3-0 Summer League record.Despite being off the court, Flagg remained his former teammate’s biggest fan. Back on draft night, when Knueppel was selected fourth overall during Flagg’s live interview, the Dallas forward couldn’t hold back his excitement. “K Dot!! Let’s go! Oh my God! Let’s go!” Flagg shouted.“It’s surreal. Kon was my roommate last year, so just to see him have that moment with his family—it’s insane. That really just gave me chills. That was amazing.”The connection between Flagg and Knueppel was born during their standout freshman year at Duke, where both were pivotal in pushing the Blue Devils to the NCAA Final Four and winning the ACC Championship. Flagg led the team with 19.2 points per game and brought home a slew of national awards, while Knueppel added 14.4 points per game and was named ACC Tournament MVP.Now, on different teams, their paths will only cross twice during the regular NBA season— but if Summer League was any indication, their bond is just as strong as ever.

What can Malaki Starks do for the Baltimore Ravens?

Also Read:

The Baltimore Ravens are wasting no time getting safety Malaki Starks involved — and early signs suggest they made the right call drafting him in the first round, because based on just how things are going, he just might deliver. According to Jeff Zrebiec of The Athletic, the rookie out of Georgia has already earned a lot of praise from the coaching staff and looks like a perfect fit next to star safety Kyle Hamilton. The team believes that together, they could form one of the best safety tandems in the NFL.“Starks has wowed team officials with his leadership qualities, work ethic and intelligence. They believe he’ll be an impact player immediately”, Zrebiec wrote in a piece examining the Ravens’ offseason upgrades and concerns.The Baltimore Ravens have struggled to find a long-term partner for Kyle Hamilton in the secondary. Geno Stone showed promise last season but left in free agency. Marcus Williams didn’t work out as planned. So now, all eyes are on Malaki Starks to step in and solidify the position.Depth is also a concern after veteran Ar’Darius Washington tore his Achilles. He’s expected to miss most of the season. Zrebiec notes there’s hope in backup Sanoussi Kane stepping up if needed.But ideally, the Ravens won't have to rely too heavily on backups if the Hamilton-Starks duo stays healthy.Kyle Hamilton is already a two-time All-Pro in just three seasons. While he didn’t have as many highlight-reel plays last year, he still posted over 100 tackles, one interception, nine passes defended and forced two fumbles. With a reliable partner beside him, his impact could grow even more now.Malaki Starks, meanwhile, showed plenty of playmaking potential at Georgia, racking up six interceptions and six tackles for loss over three seasons. Lining up alongside elite talent like Kyle Hamilton and cornerback Marlon Humphrey could give him the freedom to make even more plays.There’s also an interesting backstory involving the Pittsburgh Steelers. Before the draft, they looked into several safeties — including spending time with Malaki Starks at Georgia’s Pro Day. That may have hinted at their decision to later trade Minkah Fitzpatrick, though the move didn’t come until months later. Instead of grabbing Starks, the Pittsburgh Steelers opted to draft defensive tackle Derrick Harmon, leaving the Ravens to grab one of the draft’s top defensive safeties.“If Starks is as good as the Ravens think he is, they’ll have significantly improved at this position”, Zrebiec further wrote. “It won’t take much to improve the safety play from the first half of last season,” he added.Statistically, the Ravens have room to grow. Last season, they ranked 31st in passing yards allowed, 19th in passing touchdowns given up, and 17th in interceptions. They were also 30th in pass attempts faced — meaning teams didn’t throw often but were still successful when they did.Baltimore believes Malaki Starks can help turn that around — and sooner rather than later.",Malaki Starks was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the first round of the NFL draft.

NHL Trade Buzz: Will Nazem Kadri team up with Auston Matthews again?

Leafs Fans Stir Rumors as Flames Star Responds (Imagn Images)

Leafs fans crave reunion, Nazem Kadri keeps his cool amid buzz



Kadri praises Calgary but leaves door ajar



With the Toronto Maple Leafs still quiet about their plans following Mitch Marner's trade, fans have started speculating about the possibility of another reunion — one that would bring Nazem Kadri back to where it all began. As the Maple Leafs assess their core, including franchise centerpiece Auston Matthews, the idea of rekindling their connection with Kadri has quickly caught fire in the hockey world, even if it's fueled more by nostalgia than negotiations.Nazem Kadri’s departure from Toronto in 2020 came during a turbulent time — the Maple Leafs had just faced yet another playoff heartbreak, and cap space pressures combined with his postseason suspension sealed his fate. It wasn’t the smoothest goodbye. But time has a strange way of softening sharp edges. While management has changed and faces have shuffled, Toronto’s hunger for playoff redemption remains the same. Kadri, known for his edge and energy, is now being seen by some as a piece that could help tilt the balance.Naturally, the rumors have only grown louder. The veteran center is still tied to a hefty $7 million contract in Calgary, and he holds a full no-movement clause — a powerful tool that puts the next move entirely in his hands.But despite no official word from either club, fans are doing what they do best — imagining what could be.Kadri, aware of the speculation, recently addressed the noise during an offseason interview, showing poise and even a hint of amusement.“Unless I live in a box, I think I would hear it. I’ve certainly heard lots of speculation for sure,” Kadri said via The Knight Shift. “Obviously, the rumor mill is pretty strong, especially around these parts. And a lot of the time, the rumors can catch some fire and that fire turns into bigger fires.”Kadri didn’t dismiss the talk outright, but neither did he stoke the flames. Instead, he embraced the chatter as part of the NHL offseason culture.“You know what? And why not? I mean, there’s not a whole lot in terms of sports going on right now,” Kadri continued. “I think it’s definitely a topic to talk about, and hey, why not talk about it?”Despite the buzz around Ontario, Kadri made sure to show his appreciation for Calgary, calling it an ideal place for his family and praising the Flames organization.“It’s been excellent. Calgary is such a great city, especially for the family and myself,” he said. “Very scenic and beautiful, and got some good players along the way. So I appreciate the C of Red for sure.”Still, his future remains an open question. For now, the ball is in Kadri’s court — and if there’s even a flicker of interest in a return to Toronto, the Maple Leafs will be watching closely.Also Read: Connor McDavid needs saving — and Oilers may look to Sidney Crosby's Penguins to rescue his NHL legacy",Nazem Kadri has been linked to a return to the Toronto Maple Leafs.

“I’m not picking…” – Paul George will not sign with LaMelo Ball’s team for a reason that could end his career,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/im-not-picking-paul-george-will-not-sign-with-lamelo-balls-team-for-a-reason-that-could-end-his-career/articleshow/122546332.cms,"Paul George.

Paul George revealed why he would not join LaMelo Ball’s team Charlotte Hornets



Paul George had a brutal season with the Philadelphia 76ers



Paul George’s injury setbacks continue as training camp looms



Paul George’s recent comments on why he won’t sign with the Charlotte Hornets left no room for speculation. The Philadelphia 76ers forward made it clear that a move to LaMelo Ball’s team is off the table— because, in his own words, it could be the final nail in the coffin of his NBA career. With his future already clouded by health concerns and an underwhelming season in Philadelphia, George's blunt honesty shows how critical every decision is at this point in his career.Would Paul George ever consider teaming up with LaMelo Ball and signing with the Hornets? George responded without hesitation.“I’m not picking Charlotte just because there’s no winning culture there. My career is over with if I go there,” George said.That harsh take isn’t just about the standings, but from his perspective, it is about self-preservation. At 35 and with his body clearly wearing down, George knows his next few years in the league are not about rebuilding. Mostly, it will be about survival. Charlotte, despite its exciting young core, has been stuck in a cycle of mediocrity and has yet to show real promise as a competitive franchise. For a player trying to revive his form and reputation, the Hornets simply don’t offer the right environment for him, at least in his own image of the franchise.George’s current situation with the 76ers hasn’t been smooth, either. After signing a massive four-year, $212 million deal in the summer of 2024, George was expected to be the final piece of Philadelphia’s championship puzzle. Instead, his first season was marred by injuries, inconsistency, and ultimately, disappointment.He played only 41 games, averaging 16.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 4.3 assists— his lowest scoring average since 2014-15, a season in which he played just six games following a major leg injury. His shooting numbers also dipped, hitting just 43% from the field and 35.8% from three.In March, the Sixers shut him down for the season following injections to treat a left knee issue and a groin injury. At one point, George even stepped away from his “Podcast P with Paul George” show to focus on healing.If the Sixers had hoped for a fresh start this offseason, those hopes were quickly dashed. According to Shams Charania of ESPN, George recently suffered another setback during a summer workout and underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee.“I’m told Paul George suffered the injury during an on-court workout last week, and it led to him visiting a doctor on Friday, and the decision was made to undergo arthroscopic surgery,” Charania reported. “The doctors felt like this would be an injury that would linger… now he starts rehab for this knee injury and he will be re-evaluated at the start of this upcoming training camp.”That cautious approach is necessary. The Sixers have too much invested in the nine-time All-Star, and they need him to be in peak form if they want to bounce back from a disastrous 24-58 season that ended with both George and Joel Embiid sidelined.Also Read: Paul George's successful knee surgery adds new challenge to Philadelphia 76ers' 2025 training camp plans","Philadelphia 76ers forward Paul George says he won't join LaMelo Ball's team Charlotte Hornets.

Will Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift attend Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco's wedding or dodge the spotlight?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/will-travis-kelce-and-taylor-swift-attend-selena-gomez-and-benny-blancos-wedding-or-dodge-the-spotlight/articleshow/122507052.cms,"Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco's upcoming wedding has everyone anticipating Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's attendance (Getty Images)

Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez’s bond runs deep—and wedding invites are no exception

Travis Kelce becomes the unexpected plus-one fans can’t stop talking about

Travis Kelce’s wedding preferences give insight into the timing

As Selena Gomez gears up to tie the knot with music producer Benny Blanco, all eyes are on the guest list—and one couple in particular is drawing more attention than the bride’s gown. Taylor Swift , Gomez’s longtime best friend, is expected to attend the high-profile wedding. But whether she’ll show up with NFL superstar Travis Kelce remains a hot topic of speculation.Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift have shared a famously close friendship for over 15 years. From red carpet moments to heartfelt social media tributes, their relationship has weathered breakups, career shifts, and industry drama. Naturally, Swift is rumored to play a major role in Selena’s wedding day. In fact, back in 2023, she jokingly volunteered for flower girl duties, saying she’d “do anything for her.”While fans are anticipating Swift’s attendance, her jam-packed schedule may complicate things. With recent moves like reclaiming her master recordings and keeping up with the Eras Tour, Taylor’s calendar is more stacked than ever. Still, insiders insist she’s doing everything she can to be there for Gomez’s big day.Enter Travis Kelce—Super Bowl champion, podcast host, and Swift’s high-profile boyfriend. The Kansas City Chiefs tight end has been by Swift’s side at major public events, from football games to star-studded dinners, including one in New York where the couple joined Gomez.Now, speculation is mounting that Kelce could accompany Swift to Selena’s wedding, making them the ultimate power couple on the guest list. A recently circulated wedding seating card reading “Taylor and Travis Kelce” briefly sent the internet into a frenzy, with rumors of a secret wedding swirling. But celebrity planner Ellie Nottoli quickly shut it down, noting it was simply a misinterpreted moment from another event.On his popular “New Heights” podcast, Kelce has previously weighed in on wedding dates, saying, “I actually don't know people who've gotten married in the fall. My friends always do it in the summer... I’m not sure if the fall is a good wedding season.” That sentiment bodes well for Gomez’s rumored summer wedding and adds fuel to the fire that Kelce may attend.This isn’t just a celebrity wedding—it’s a convergence of pop and sports royalty. Selena Gomez is embracing a new chapter with Blanco, while Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s evolving relationship continues to dominate headlines. Whether Swift and Kelce arrive hand-in-hand or send their regrets, their presence—or absence—will undoubtedly shape the narrative around what’s poised to be one of Hollywood’s most talked-about nuptials of the year.Also Read: Will Blake Lively ever cheer for Travis Kelce again?

In a stunning development that’s shaking up FS1’s on-air lineup, Joy Taylor has officially parted ways with Fox Sports. The move comes as the network embarks on a widespread reshuffle, axing multiple shows—including Speak, which Taylor co-hosted. Her exit also closely follows a months-long legal controversy involving allegations made against a former Fox Sports executive and Taylor’s name surfacing in the lawsuit. While Taylor’s departure was reportedly tied to the expiration of her contract, the timing has raised eyebrows across the industry.Taylor had been a key presence on Speak since 2022, sharing the desk with former NFL star Keyshawn Johnson and ex-NBA player Paul Pierce. But the show, along with Breakfast Ball and The Facility, is now being scrapped as part of Fox Sports’ latest cost-cutting and content realignment strategy. The Athletic first broke the news, revealing Taylor’s contract would not be renewed. The exit comes just months after serious allegations from a former Fox Sports hairstylist, Noushin Faraji, rocked the network.Faraji accused then-Fox Sports executive Charlie Dixon of groping her during a party held for Taylor in 2017.In a troubling twist, Faraji also claimed Taylor dismissed her accusation and was allegedly involved in an extramarital affair with Dixon—an affair Faraji claimed contributed to Taylor’s rise to her former Undisputed moderator role. Additionally, Taylor was accused of mocking Faraji’s accent and her PTSD-related behaviors.Taylor firmly rejected the claims, with a spokeswoman stating, “The claims set forth against Ms. Taylor are devoid of merit and appear to have been strategically framed to create unwarranted publicity rather than to seek legitimate redress.” Despite the public stir, Taylor kept her composure, opting for measured statements. “I know that the public has a lot of interest in this situation,” she told The Cut. “But I have to let the legal process play out. ”After a brief two-week absence from air earlier this year, Taylor returned, fueling speculation about internal deliberations over her contract. A report from Front Office Sports had earlier mentioned her deal was due to expire this summer, which now appears to have marked her quiet exit.The Internet is going crazy after her exit. Users have come up with different thoughts but a major portion of them already let others know what they think of about her future career.One user @coldcallsniper commented, ""Incoming OF."" A second one having username @Jerryjo58719446 added, ""Joy taylor onlyfans leaks would be fire."" Another named @0usports echoed the same by saying, ""She can take her career to onlyfans now.""In recent months, Taylor had become more outspoken beyond sports commentary. On her Two Personal Show, she made headlines by suggesting the legalization of sex work as a remedy for male loneliness. On The Truth After Dark podcast, she remarked that religious men were a dating red flag for her—despite identifying as a “person of faith” herself. These bold views have both intrigued and polarized her fan base, marking a noticeable shift in her public persona.As Fox Sports closes a chapter, the media landscape is now watching to see where Joy Taylor lands next—and whether the controversies surrounding her will fade or follow her forward.Also Read: Taylor Swift snubs Kamala Harris plea, but plays house entertainer for Travis Kelce’s NFL frat party","Joy Taylor has officially parted ways with Fox Sports.

Antonio Brown and the 2024 campaign connection

Tom Brady’s surprise appearance at the Chelsea vs. PSG Club World Cup final on July 13 didn’t just draw attention from soccer fans—it reignited a political firestorm. The NFL icon was spotted watching the high-profile match from none other than President Donald Trump’s private suite, alongside First Lady Melania Trump, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and FIFA president Gianni Infantino.While Tom Brady has long maintained silence on his political views, his presence in Donald Trump’s VIP box, flanked by Republican power players, has once again raised the question: is Tom Brady a Trump supporter?Brady’s alleged political leanings have stirred public curiosity since 2015, when a red “Make America Great Again” cap was seen in his locker during a media interview. At the time, he explained on WEEI radio: “He always gives me a call and different types of motivational speeches at different times. So now that he’s running for president, he sent me a hat, and he gave it to [Patriots owner Robert Kraft] a couple weeks ago. So it found its way to my locker.”Brady called Trump “a hell of a lot of fun,” but stopped short of explicitly endorsing him. Still, the moment marked the beginning of a long-running debate about where Brady stands politically.Fast-forward to 2022, Brady attempted to clarify his political image in a candid interview with Variety.“I think [the press] just mischaracterized a lot. And my personality isn’t ever one to insult anybody,” he said. “There are things that I agree with. There are things that I don’t… I’m really responsible for what I say.”Brady emphasized he hadn’t “talked to [Trump] in a lot of years,” signaling distance, if not disavowal. His nuanced response highlighted a desire to stay out of political polarization without fully severing ties.Former teammate Antonio Brown—never one to shy away from controversy—claimed on the Fearless podcast that Brady was involved in a call with Trump during the 2024 election run. Brown, who openly supports Trump, said of Brady: “Yeah, definitely,” when asked if the quarterback backed Trump.Despite these recent headlines, Tom Brady has never formally endorsed any candidate. His calculated ambiguity may be a reflection of his brand—one built on universal appeal. But with recurring proximity to Trump, questions around his political identity are unlikely to fade any time soon.Also Read: Sofía Vergara’s connection to Tom Brady deepens as reports claim she already met his daughter Vivian",Tom Brady was spotted at the Chelsea vs. PSG Club World Cup final with Donald Trump.

In a jaw-dropping segment from The Pivot Podcast, former NFL linebacker Channing Crowder tore into Hallie Aiono, the pregnant girlfriend of Los Angeles Rams star Puka Nacua, following her paternity petition filed in Los Angeles County last month. The 18-year-old wide receiver, known for his breakout rookie season, now finds himself in the middle of a growing controversy that extends far beyond the football field.Hallie Aiono, who began dating Nacua during his college days at BYU, filed a paternity suit on June 16, requesting legal confirmation of Nacua's paternity, full physical custody of their unborn son, and shared legal custody covering education, healthcare, and financial expenses.This follows her emotional Mother’s Day Instagram post, in which she wrote, “You were something we always dreamt of, but I have never been so afraid... I can’t wait to love you forever, my sweet boy.”The story took a turn after Crowder made his views clear, casting serious doubt on Aiono’s intentions and character during Saturday’s podcast episode.Crowder held nothing back as he speculated on Aiono’s behavior and what it could have meant for Nacua’s future.He even suggested that the Rams receiver was fortunate to escape long-term financial entanglement.“Congratulations, brother. You got out the spider’s web before it stung your ass,” Crowder said. “She helped him out with this...

Think about it. 18 years. If he had paid for this baby and did all this—18 years. 18 years,” he emphasized.Crowder also brought cultural context into the conversation, highlighting Polynesian values of family loyalty and the pressure Nacua might have felt to stay with Aiono had he believed the child was his.Former Pittsburgh Steelers safety Ryan Clark echoed the criticism, questioning Aiono’s commitment during her relationship with Nacua.“If you were in it for the money, you had one job,” Clark said. “Y’all were together all over the NFL sites... The one job you had was to not have sex with somebody else... and you couldn’t wait.” He ended his remarks by saying, “I pray that’s not your baby.”Also Read: “Cracker of the day”: Aaron Rodgers slammed for mocking kid at golf event as Antonio Brown fires off racially charged insult While Nacua has remained silent publicly, the fallout from this paternity battle is escalating—and judging by the voices now weighing in, it’s only just begun.","Former NFL linebacker Channing Crowder tore into Hallie Aiono, the pregnant girlfriend of Los Angeles Rams star Puka Nacua.

Jared Goff’s fatherhood journey begins as wife Christen Harper delivers baby girl ahead of NFL season



A journey of love, milestones, and fatherhood dreams fulfilled



Detroit Lions quarterback Jared Goff is entering a new and more personal chapter of his life — fatherhood. Goff and his wife, Christen Harper, joyfully welcomed their first child, a daughter named Romy Isabelle Goff. The couple shared the heartwarming news on Instagram with a series of black-and-white photographs, showcasing tender family moments. Their announcement, just weeks before the start of NFL training camp, has captured the attention of both fans and fellow NFL families.In a coordinated Instagram post on Tuesday, Jared and Christen introduced baby Romy to the world. The post included intimate moments — a tiny newborn hand clutching Christen’s finger, Jared cradling his daughter, and the new family of three sharing a peaceful moment in bed. Jared proudly wore a ""Girl Dad"" hat, already embracing his new role.Christen, overcome with emotion, shared in her Instagram Story, ""Heart is bursting into a million pieces!!!!!"" The background song she chose, “Green Eyes” by Coldplay, subtly hinted at one of Romy’s features, adding an extra personal touch to the reveal.Although they kept the exact birth date under wraps, the couple’s joy was unmistakable. NFL WAGs and friends rushed to the comments with congratulatory notes.Olivia Culpo, who recently welcomed a baby with 49ers star Christian McCaffrey, wrote, “Congratulations!!!” Camille Kostek, longtime girlfriend of Rob Gronkowski, added, “My heart 🥹🫶🏼 I love you guys and baby Romy 🎀.” Anna Kupp, wife of Cooper Kupp, also shared, “The most precious gift. So happy for you both! 🤍”The couple’s love story began in 2019 after meeting through the exclusive dating app Raya. Jared proposed in 2022 during a getaway with friends, and the two tied the knot in a scenic Ojai, California wedding on June 22, 2024. Just months later, their dream of starting a family became reality.Back in February, the pair revealed to PEOPLE during the NFL Honors that they were expecting. Jared shared, “I'm looking forward to becoming a dad,” while Christen added, “We're just excited to enjoy this special time together and just soak up every second.”Goff had long envisioned himself as a father. “I've always dreamt of becoming a dad. Now that it’s real, I know it'll add a new perspective to life, and it'll be great,” he told PEOPLE.As the NFL season looms, Goff has just enough time to enjoy his first days of fatherhood before returning to the field, where he’ll once again balance the roles of leader — both on the gridiron and now, at home.Also Read: So Long, London or so long, Bill?

Chandi Dayle becomes group leader but battles self-doubt and emotional scars behind the scenes

A Bahamas fling, mental health struggles, and her decision to retire spark controversy and reflection

In Season 2 of Netflix’s America’s Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, Chandi Dayle emerged as one of the most compelling and quietly resilient figures on the squad. A sixth-year veteran of the DCC, Chandi’s final season wasn’t defined by glamor or touchdowns—but by a deeply personal battle with trauma, leadership, and ultimately, the courage to walk away on her own terms.Although Chandi is a reserved presence compared to some of her more outspoken teammates, she was voted a 1st Group Leader by all 24 rookies—an incredible feat that speaks volumes about the quiet respect she commanded. In the words of DCC’s Senior Director Kelli Finglass, the group leaders “help with choreography, communication, and serve as mentors.” Yet for Chandi, stepping into leadership meant confronting internal struggles she had long buried.Chandi has a history of masking her pain. Her childhood was marked by abandonment—her father told her they didn’t need to see each other again—and later, a physically abusive relationship that left lingering fear. “I used to hide my past, afraid of judgment and shame,” she wrote during Domestic Violence Awareness Month. “As a survivor, I know I am more than my scars.”Her fellow DCC members, including mentor Judy Trammell, recognized her difficulty making big decisions and constantly seeking approval.“She craves her attention and approval,” Judy noted, seeing a younger version of herself in Chandi.Things came to a head after a fling with a man she met in the Bahamas following her breakup with boyfriend Ryan. Feeling emotionally vulnerable and alone, Chandi invited him back to her hotel room—a choice that sparked tension among teammates over security concerns. She soon took a mental health break, missing games and practices.During her absence, teammate KayDianna—who had temporarily stepped into Chandi’s leadership role—became entangled in controversy for vaguely referencing the Bahamas incident on TikTok. A screen-recorded clip ignited a firestorm online, leading to a bullying investigation. KayDianna was suspended and ultimately walked away from the team.In the season finale, Chandi hobbled into her final meeting in a hip brace and delivered a tearful goodbye: “There was a long time where I was scared to live without dance because that was my safe place.” Now retired, Chandi is focusing on healing, judging for her alma mater’s Pomline team, and embracing a new chapter beyond the sidelines.Also Read: Did Jada Mclean use the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders pay fight to launch her next career?

Outrage erupts as NHL prioritizes Blackhawks over champs for prime-time spotlight



Fans slam early puck drop and weak opponent choice



Fans slams the NHL (SS via Twitter)

Broadcast accessibility concerns continue to haunt NHL fans

The newly announced 2026 NHL season schedule has angered hockey fans, primarily over the Florida Panthers' opening game. Many are frustrated by the champions' early start time and their matchup against the Chicago Blackhawks, feeling it reduces the two-time Stanley Cup winners. Concerns also abide regarding broadcast accessibility for games.Significant frustration has ignited among the devoted hockey fans due to the initial release of the NHL’s 2026 season schedule. Much of the ire centers on the opening night plans, especially concerning the reigning champions, the Florida Panthers.Forward Matthew Tkachuk previously articulated his ambitions, phrasing, “Hopefully another best year ever,” and adding, “I don’t know. I think I want to get used to this, this whole winning thing. So, I guess it starts with coming out at the start of the year again.” Yet, the league’s choices for their October 7th opener have caused prevalent discontent.The decision to schedule the Panthers' banner-raising event and their game against the Chicago Blackhawks in an early 5 PM ET slot, rather than a prime-time slot, has drawn tremendous criticism. One upset fan @RyanWinsBets commented, “How is the FLA vs CHI game not the prime time game? Would love to hear the reasoning.”Another @McCant4Life echoed the sentiment, querying, “Do we have to three-peat to get some respect around here or what? TF is that puck drop time?” Beyond the timing, the opponent choice is also a flashpoint. Many craved a more exciting contest, with one fan @TakenKhariaYa conveying, “Who wants to see these games? Should be Florida vs Oilers on opening night, that would be something.”Adding to these resentments are persistent worries about broadcast access, highlighted by a fan’s concerned query: “Stanley Cup champs get a 5 p.m. start time, and I’m guessing the NHL will make it hard to watch unless you have the right subscription?”This echoes prior criticisms regarding the league’s complicated subscription landscape, with the Winged Wheel Podcast’s Ryan Hana mourning, “Best sport in the world and nobody can watch.”Also Read: Stanley Cup shame sparks Oilers' panic move—goalie coach out as franchise refuses to face roster truth As the complete season schedule approaches, these early choices and fan responses underscore the ongoing challenge of balancing league decisions with the ardent hopes of its loyal supporters.","NHL's 2026 season schedule has angered hockey fans, primarily over the Florida Panthers' opening game.

Anton Frondell delays NHL debut , chooses development year in Sweden

Blackhawks back Anton Frondell’s development path



Anton Frondell’s loyalty to Djurgarden shines through

Anton Frondell, selected third overall by the Blackhawks, will purportedly spend his rookie season in Sweden with Djurgarden rather than joining Connor Bedard in the NHL. This decision aligns with Chicago's developmental approach, allowing the young Finn to mature while training alongside two-time Stanley Cup champion Marcus Kruger.The most expected arrival of the exceptionally talented Anton Frondell to the Chicago Blackhawks' lineup won't happen just yet. Instead of heading straight for the bright lights of the National Hockey League alongside the likes of Connor Bedard, it seems the promising young Finn has opted for another year of development in his home country, with his cherished childhood team, Djurgarden, despite being a top-three pick in the NHL Draft.This decision appears to be a calculated move, understood and supported by both Frondell and the Blackhawks organization. They recognize that at just 18, he's still edging his craft and might not be entirely prepared for the rigorous pace and physical demands of North American professional hockey. Giving him more time to mature his game in a familiar environment is seen as a beneficial step, preventing burnout and fostering long-term success.Moreover, his time in Sweden offers a unique learning experience. He'll be hitting the ice with seasoned veteran Marcus Kruger, a familiar face to Blackhawks fans, having heaved the Stanley Cup twice with the Chicago club. Kruger's presence provides a priceless mentorship opportunity, allowing Frondell to glean insights into what it truly takes to win at the highest level—a spirit he'll eventually bring back to the very franchise he's fated to join.Frondell's deep bond with his Swedish squad is unmistakable. He passionately phrased, ""When I got the offer to stay, there was no doubt, no hesitation. Everyone who knows me knows that this is the club that I want to play for as long as possible. I have been a Djurgarden fan since the day I was born and I have always looked up to those who have worn Djurgarden jerseys.""Despite this heartfelt proclamation, Frondell is still expected to formally sign his initial contract with the Blackhawks. Reports affirm: ""Anton Frondell will sign an entry-level contract this upcoming week with the Chicago Blackhawks. The 18-year-old will sign for three years at $975,000 per year, which is the maximum allowed for an entry-level deal according to the CBA."" Captivatingly, this puts his initial contract value higher than Connor Bedard's current deal, though Frondell's contract won't officially begin until he joins the NHL roster.Also Read: Tom Brady and Wayne Gretzky’s FIFA Club World Cup Final cameo sparks political buzz in Donald Trump’s VIP suite This isn't a setback for Frondell, but a smart delay.

Could Tristan Jarry be Connor McDavid’s last hope?



Edmonton Oilers must choose its goaltending future carefully



After another disappointing playoff exit, Connor McDavid and the Edmonton Oilers may be forced to confront a hard truth: their championship window is shrinking. With each passing season, the pressure mounts—not only to deliver but to fix persistent weaknesses. This summer, the most glaring issue appears to be in the crease. Now, whispers around the league suggest the solution could come from an unexpected ally: Sidney Crosby’s Pittsburgh Penguins.In the wake of Edmonton’s playoff frustrations, NHL insider Jeff Marek floated an intriguing idea on Inside Sports—Pittsburgh’s Tristan Jarry might be the answer to the Oilers’ long-standing goaltending concerns. Jarry, who still has three years remaining on a $26.75 million contract, has had his ups and downs in Pittsburgh, but his talent is undeniable. The catch? Edmonton would need help absorbing the salary.“I think if the Penguins retain half, I think that there’s a shot,” Marek said via NHL Rumour Report on X. “Can Dubas move Jarry without retention? Probably not, but which team is gonna ask him to retain the least and maximize the return?”The Penguins, however, aren’t just a goalie shop. This is Sidney Crosby’s team, and trading away Jarry—his longtime teammate—could feel like a seismic shift.But with Pittsburgh quietly leaning toward a rebuild, they may be ready to move on. The recent addition of Arturs Silovs from Vancouver, coupled with the development of Joel Blomqvist, hints at a possible changing of the guard.For the Oilers, the need is urgent. While Calvin Pickard showed flashes of reliability, insiders like Rory Boylen believe he’s more likely to be on the move than Stuart Skinner. Edmonton seems more inclined to look for a stronger backup rather than replace Skinner outright—unless a goalie like Jarry becomes available under favorable terms.Still, the Oilers haven’t stood still. David Pagnotta recently revealed that the team explored the possibility of acquiring John Gibson from Detroit, only to be turned down. That attempt signals just how serious Edmonton is about resolving their goaltending issue this offseason.If Tristan Jarry does end up in Alberta, it won’t be without strategic maneuvering—and maybe a favor from Kyle Dubas and the Penguins. For McDavid, who is entering his prime with a ticking championship clock, every decision matters. And if Pittsburgh is willing to deal, this could be a rare win-win in a league where patience wears thin fast.Also Read: Can Jeff Skinner revive his old magic in the San Jose Sharks, or is this just a short stop on his journey?",Edmonton Oilers may be forced to confront a hard truth: their championship window is shrinking. whispers around the league suggest the solution could come from an unexpected ally: Sidney Crosby’s Pittsburgh Penguins.

Thehave chosen to stand pat this offseason, at least when it comes to trade activity. While minor moves were made—like signing Jake LaRavia and Deandre Ayton, re-signing Jaxson Hayes, and trading up in the second round to draft Adou Thiero—the front office has remained largely quiet.This silence recently gave rise to speculation about a possible trade involving ex- Golden State Warriors forward Andrew Wiggins. However, those rumors were short-lived. According to Dan Woike of The Athletic, speaking on The Lowe Post with Zach Lowe, there’s no truth to the Lakers’ pursuit of Wiggins: “They’re not interested in Andrew Wiggins. I think I can put that to bed.”Andrew Wiggins, who was recently acquired by Miami, was linked in trade rumors with L.A., sparking buzz among fans and insiders. Swapping Wiggins with Los Angeles Lakers forward Rui Hachimura was the most-discussed scenario. While Andrew Wiggins offers stronger perimeter defense, he’s several years older than Hachimura and brings questions about shooting consistency.The rumors—though now debunked—had potential implications for Rui Hachimura’s role with the Los Angeles Lakers . Being at the center of trade talk can often disrupt a player’s performance or team chemistry.With the speculation cleared, Hachimura appears safe heading into the 2025–26 season.This clarification might also signal that the Lakers’ offseason stillness is just that—no secret blockbuster deal brewing behind closed doors.While the Andrew Wiggins story quieted quickly, Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James remained at the center of offseason drama. Though LeBron never requested a trade, he made it clear he was keeping an eye on the team’s moves.That subtle pressure opened the door to widespread speculation, linking James to a variety of teams, from a nostalgic return to the Cleveland Cavaliers to potential moves to the Knicks or Mavericks. Yet throughout it all, both LeBron and his agent Rich Paul have held a consistent public stance—LeBron isn’t asking to be traded.Still, behind the scenes, interest was real. During NBA Summer League in Las Vegas, reports confirmed that four teams reached out to Rich Paul to explore trade possibilities for the 40-year-old superstar.While no official list was revealed, the following franchises were popularly tied to potential moves:- Cleveland Cavaliers- New York Knicks- Dallas Mavericks- [Unnamed fourth team]Despite not making a major trade splash, the Los Angeles Lakers have made a few calculated moves to reshape their roster:With trade talks for Andrew Wiggins dismissed and LeBron’s future looking stable—for now—the Lakers appear set on entering the season with their current core.

Goldberg reveals his future plans

Goldberg issued an apology to a senior WWE official. Charles Robinson was the referee for Goldberg’s last match. During the intense game at SNME, Robinson was on the receiving end of a spear. The veteran posted a picture of it on X. In the recent episode of the Ariel Helwani Show, Goldberg was asked if he was aware of the referee’s injury. The wrestler immediately issued an apology.Goldberg and Charles Robinson shared a bond since their WCW days. Robinson called several matches for Goldberg, even at WCW. In the episode of The Ariel Helwani Show, Goldberg made a revelation. It was he who had invited Robinson to call his final match at the Saturday Night Main Event. During the match, Robinson was hit by an accidental spear from Goldberg. The 61-year-old veteran revealed his injury via a post on Instagram. He wrote, “Thanks @goldberg95! Never fear…I am ALL MAN and I can’t be kept down! I will return for @wwe #smackdown next week in #SanAntonio! #wrestling #nofear”Reacting to the injury, Goldberg apologized to the WWE veteran. He stated, “Yeah, I mean. here’s the deal. I asked for Charles to be in there.Charles and I have a long history, and Charles has taken that before, and I might have broken a rib last time, and Charles is a freakin’. he is a, I don’t know, I’m not gonna say ‘Renaissance Man’”.He further continued, “That dude’s indestructible. I don’t know how old he is, but he’s taken that Spear a number of times, a lot of times, actually, and more power to him. Man, I love him to death, but I do apologize for the rib, but it’ll heal like the other one did.”Goldberg lost that match to Gunther. Despite the loss, he ended his career on a high note.It is unlikely for Goldberg to make a WWE appearance anytime soon. In the same episode of The Ariel Helwani Show, the wrestler opened up on his future plans. He straight up negated any possibility of him showing up in the promotion. At the same time he acknowledged the run he had in WWE.“I don't think I'm lingering anywhere around the WWE in the anytime future. Oh, man. Stretched imagination.” Goldberg stated, “It was a lot of fun. It told it taught me that I could do things that I never thought that I could do.”The wrestler continued to reveal his next plans, “I got August 29th, I think we got a home game against Georgia Tech at the University of Colorado at Gage. I'm going to be there and that's kind of what's next.” He further stated, “I mean, I'm jumping back into my cars and doing some TV show stuff in the automobile world and trying to put some smiles on kids faces and I'm going to have a little bit of fun, man. And I'm going to train my ass off and I'm going to get back in the gym. ”Goldberg seems to be full of content.

Popular NFL player Antonio Brown has recently expressed his sentiments regarding NBA player Klay Thompson's decision to make his relationship with Megan Thee Stallion public. The NBA player was recently criticized by the former athlete for his alleged relationship with the singer.

Why Shemar Stewart’s Texas A&M workouts could derail his Cincinnati Bengals NFL rookie deal

The legal battle that could define Shemar Stewart’s Cincinnati Bengals and Texas A&M football future

What’s next for Shemar Stewart as Cincinnati Bengals contract talks stall and Texas A&M return looms

Shemar Stewart was supposed to be the Cincinnati Bengals’ prized rookie this fall. Instead, he’s back in College Station, sweating it out at Texas A&M workouts while his NFL future hangs by a thread. Selected 17th overall in April’s NFL Draft, the defensive lineman now faces a high-stakes contract dispute that has left him with two risky options: negotiate with a team that currently holds all the power or fight for the legal right to play college football again. With millions in earnings and an entire year of development on the line, Stewart’s next move could shape the rest of his career—and everyone’s watching to see what happens next.While Shemar Stewart has yet to sign with the Bengals, this summer he’s been spotted working out with the Texas A&M football team. His presence in College Station has surprised many in the NFL and college football worlds, raising questions about NCAA eligibility rules and the leverage he actually has.Cover 3 podcast host Bud Elliott shared details about where and when these workouts have been happening, and who tipped him off about Stewart’s involvement.“He’s been at College Station. He’s been fully involved in workouts,” Elliott said on the show. He added, “A guy who has had some good (Texas) A&M stuff in the past, he hit me, he's like, 'Hey, Shemar might end up back here.'”Stewart’s contract standoff with the Bengals centers on default language in his rookie deal, a typical but often contentious part of NFL Draft negotiations. The Bengals selected him 17th overall in April, but no deal has been finalized, leaving him in limbo as training camps approach. Despite the tension, neither Stewart’s camp nor the Bengals have issued any new public statements updating the situation, deepening the uncertainty around when—or even if—a resolution will come.Even if Stewart hopes to suit up again for Texas A&M, that path is anything but simple. NCAA rules don’t currently allow him to play this season unless he wins a legal fight to restore his eligibility—a move that could trigger a lengthy court battle.Elliott underlined that uncertainty when he said on the podcast, “It may not be legal yet, but everything in the NCAA ecosphere is subject to litigation.”But there’s another catch: even if he did get a waiver to play for Texas A&M, the Bengals would still hold his NFL Draft rights. The only way Stewart can force his way back into next year’s draft and break from Cincinnati’s control would be to sit out football entirely this fall. That means missing an entire season of development—and risking millions in future earnings.For now, Stewart remains caught in a contractual maze that few rookies navigate successfully. He’s kept himself in top shape with his old team in College Station, but whether he’ll actually see the field for the Aggies—or the Bengals—any time soon is anyone’s guess.Shemar Stewart’s rookie journey is shaping up to be one of the NFL Draft’s most dramatic stories. Instead of preparing for his first pro training camp, he’s back at Texas A&M, clashing with Cincinnati over a contract stalemate that threatens to derail his career. With legal hurdles, NCAA eligibility rules, and his draft rights all in play, Stewart faces a defining choice: fight in court for a college return, compromise with the Bengals, or sit out and re-enter the draft next spring.What do you think? Should Stewart push for Texas A&M, hold out for the NFL, or find a way to settle with Cincinnati?

The growth path of Dylan Nolan: From Junior Kings to USHL stardom

Profile of Connor Brown : A skilled acquisition for the Tri-City Storm

A high-profile trade has resulted in Dylan Nolan, son of ex-NHL player Owen Nolan, entering a new environment by joining the Waterloo Black Hawks. After an exciting rookie campaign followed with some positive exploits in junior hockey, the young forward will now attempt to fit switching gears and aggressive styles of play while adding his scoring touch to a different system. Having been an instrumental move in his burgeoning USHL career, the ripples expanded to encompass both franchises.Dylan Nolan's local roots barely existed in junior hockey before he made the leap into the USHL. While with the San Jose Jr. Sharks, he made a great impact by scoring 50 points in his final season there. His transition to the LA Junior Kings only seemed to further Moe's cause, as back-to-back playoff appearances set the tone for his leadership on the ice. It's in his final year in LA that Nolan exploded onto the scene, delivering a jaw-dropping 80-point offensive season, netting 34 goals and assists to 46, firmly establishing his offensive presence.The breakout season produced an opportunity for a USHL career with the Tri-City Storm. Though his rookie campaign saw modest results, just two goals in 55 games, his playoff presence was notable. Ironically, one of his goals came against the very team he now joins: the Waterloo Black Hawks.Tri-City Storm receives Connor Brown, a calculated attempt at balancing youthful potential with proven college experience. Hailing from Florida, Brown was drafted by Waterloo in 2021 and proved to be a consistent playmaker with 21 goals and 42 assists during his stint. Although last season was sidelined due to injury, Brown spent time with Western Michigan University, which speaks to his versatility and future potential at the NCAA level.His inclusion in the deal gives Tri-City a forward who has technical skills complemented by solid playmaking instincts that would suit well in the Storm system as they try to bounce back from last year's early playoff outage.Also Read: Jordan Binnington and Cris Prosperi celebrate son Johnny’s first birthday with a sporty twist Dylan Nolan moving to Waterloo opens a plethora of opportunities for him as well as the Black Hawks, who are now eager to make the best of his energy and potential.

When Did This Happen Before?

How Can You Watch or Use This Event?

Why Does This Matter?

FAQs

Q: Why does the sun only align over the Kaaba twice a year?

Q: Can I see this from outside Mecca?

Q: What if it’s cloudy?





Twice a year, the sun lines up perfectly above the Kaaba, casting no shadows. Today is the second and final time this year. At 12:27 PM local time, the sun will be right above the Kaaba, making all shadows disappear. This moment is important because it helps Muslims everywhere check the exact direction to face during prayer, called the Qibla.This event happens because of how the Earth tilts and moves around the sun. As the sun moves south from the Tropic of Cancer, it aligns with Mecca’s latitude. When this happens, the sun reaches its highest point in the sky over the city, about 89.5 degrees above the horizon. Vertical objects won’t cast shadows during this time.The solar zenith is when the sun sits directly overhead at a specific location. For Mecca, this occurs twice a year. It’s linked to Earth’s 23.5-degree tilt and Mecca’s position at 21.4 degrees north latitude.When the sun hits this point, it lines up so perfectly that vertical objects, like the Kaaba and nearby poles, cast no shadows at all. This is not just a neat trick, it’s practical. Muslims can use this time to confirm the Qibla direction easily.This year, the first solar zenith over the Kaaba was on May 28, 2025. The next one will be on July 16, 2026. So today’s event is the last chance this year to see this alignment.Today, at 12:27 PM Mecca time (9:27 AM GMT), the sun will be directly above. If you want to check your prayer direction at home, find a sunny outdoor spot. Place a stick or any straight object upright on flat ground. When the sun reaches this point, the stick will cast no shadow.The shadow that does appear just before or after the exact time points exactly away from Mecca. That’s how you can find the Qibla from anywhere with sunlight.This event isn’t just for astronomers. It’s a natural way to confirm prayer direction without needing a compass or phone. It connects Muslims worldwide to Mecca in a simple, direct way.A: Because of Earth’s tilt and orbit, the sun passes Mecca’s latitude only twice annually, usually late May and mid-July.A: You won’t see the sun directly overhead unless you’re in Mecca, but you can use the shadow method anywhere with sunlight.A: You won’t be able to see shadows clearly if the sun is blocked by clouds. Try again next year or rely on other methods to find the Qibla.","Sunlight directly over the Kaaba eliminates shadows, marking a unique moment for Qibla alignment.

India vs England: India fall short at Lord’s, England lead series 2-1

Poll Should India change their batting order for the next Test? Yes, definitely No, they should stick with it

After India's heartbreaking defeat to England in the 3rd Test, several crucial moments and lapses were rued for potentially snatching the game away from the visitors. Ravi Shastri has identified two crucial moments that, in his view, cost India the third Test at Lord’s. In a tightly contested match that saw both sides push each other to the limit, India ended up falling short by 22 runs, bowled out for 170 while chasing 193.The former India head coach analysed the defeat, stating that the first big turning point came on Day 3, when Rishabh Pant was run out just before lunch.""The turning point for me in this Test match was, first of all, Rishabh Pant's dismissal (in the 1st innings),"" Shastri said. ""Ben Stokes, simply outstanding presence of mind to hit at the right end and pull it off on the stroke of lunch. Because India would have got a lead and they were in the driver's seat,"" said Shastri, speaking to Sanjana Ganesan on The ICC Review.Pant was batting confidently on 74, and his wicket shifted momentum back to England. India and England had both posted identical first innings totals of 387, and Pant’s dismissal denied India a possible edge.The second moment, Shastri said, came when Karun Nair misjudged a ball early in the second innings.""Having said that, again at 40/1 (in the 2nd innings), I thought that was a huge lapse in concentration from Karun Nair to leave a straight ball, a nothing ball, to leave it and open the door for England. I thought that the timing of that dismissal turned things around,"" said Shastri.""Because you saw when Siraj batted, when Bumrah batted, when Jadeja was batting, once the ball was 40 overs old, they hardly put a foot wrong. They were solid in defence and to bring that target down at lunch, 82 to get, you thought in the next 10 minutes it would be done and dusted. But to bring that 82 or 83 to 22 was a massive achievement. So it just goes to show that (if) the top order had just been a little tougher and mentally stronger on Day 4, towards the end, this game would have been India's,"" stated Shastri.Despite the loss, he praised England for stepping up when it mattered most.""You have to compliment England. When the going got tough, those moments they seized. And when they saw an opening in the door, they just banged their door down,"" he said.Shastri also reflected on how closely this match mirrored India’s win at Lord’s in 2021, calling the current series 'fascinating' with two matches left. India trail 2-1 in the five-match series and head to Manchester for the 4th Test, needing a win to stay alive in the series.","Ravi Shastri has identified two crucial moments that, in his view, cost India the third Test at Lord’s. The former India head coach analysed the defeat, stating that the first big turning point came on Day 3, when Rishabh Pant was run out just before lunch. The second moment, he said, came when Karun Nair misjudged a ball early in the second innings.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122552926,imgsize-520894,width-400,resizemode-4/122552926.jpg"

Indian men's and women's cricket teams met King Charles III at St. James's Palace in London on Tuesday, where the monarch displayed remarkable knowledge about the players' personal lives and recent matches. The meeting was attended by team captains Shubman Gill and Harmanpreet Kaur , along with team members, coaching staff, and BCCI officials.BCCI Vice President Rajeev Shukla expressed his delight at the historic meeting, noting King Charles's detailed knowledge about the players and their personal lives.""It was a very historic occasion that both our men's and women's teams were invited today by King Charles and met them very well in the Palace. Players are very happy because he asked all personal details of each player. He asked Saikia ji and me about whether Arun Jaitley is my friend, what happened to him, and when I told him that he had died, he asked me to pay condolences to his family. He also asked about Akash Deep's sister's illness,"" Shukla said.Shukla further emphasised the King's humility and knowledge of cricket, particularly regarding the third Test at Lord's.""He had found out so many details. He sounded like a gentleman, and it did not seem we were talking to the King of England.There is a lot of humility in him and team is very happy to meet him,"" Shukla added.The BCCI Vice President also addressed the performance of young captain Shubman Gill and the absence of veterans Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.""Even he noticed this fact. If we had another regular batter on the field, then we could have won easily. Our team has proven that our experiment is well done, as part of which we have sent a new team because we are looking forward to the future. The team has proven itself to be a fighter unit. We almost won here. We did well at Leeds. Our team is competing with England equally and will win the series as two matches are since left,"" he explained.During the meeting, Shukla gifted one of his books, titled 'Scars of 1947: Real Partition Stories' to the King. The book is a collection of firsthand accounts from the survivors of the partition in 1947.During the meeting, King Charles discussed the final moments of the third Test with Gill, specifically mentioning Mohammed Siraj's unfortunate dismissal.Gill shared his experience of the meeting with reporters: ""It was amazing. I think he was very kind and generous to be able to call us here, and it was a pleasure meeting the king, and we had some really good conversations.""The Indian captain elaborated on his conversation with the King: ""Yes, he did tell us that the way our last batsman got out was quite unfortunate. The ball was rolling on the stumps, and he was just asking us how we felt after that, and we told him it was an unfortunate match for us. It could have gone either way, but hopefully we will have better luck in the next games.""The Indian teams also met British actor Idris Elba before their royal encounter. Elba expressed his modest connection to cricket: ""I'd say I'm a fan, but I don't follow cricket as well as I should. I was just a little bowler, that's all.""Women's team captain Harmanpreet Kaur shared her experience of meeting the King: ""Uh, it was a very nice experience. Uh, we came to England so many times, but this was our first time when we met him, and he was very friendly. He asked us, like, how the travel was and all, and, um, it was really nice to meet him.""She added: ""Definitely, we have been playing good cricket, and I think with that we are getting a lot of opportunity to express ourselves, so really happy the way things are moving on.""Women's team head coach Amol Muzumdar expressed his gratitude for the opportunity: ""It has been a very humbling experience coming here to the royal house and meeting the king. It's been the first time, so we came all the way from Southampton, but it was really worth it, and the girls were really excited about this visit, and we are pleased that we are here.""The men's team is currently in England for a five-match Test series, while the women's team recently secured a historic 3-2 T20I series victory over England and is preparing for an upcoming three-match ODI series starting in Southampton.King Charles also interacted with other team members including vice-captain Rishabh Pant, Jasprit Bumrah, Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Ravindra Jadeja, and head coach Gautam Gambhir.
