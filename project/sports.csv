NEW DELHI: In Chennai Super Kings' commanding 78-run victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad, Tushar Deshpande's sensational bowling performance during the powerplay proved to be the game-changer. Ruturaj Gaikwad, the skipper, recognized Deshpande's pivotal role in shifting the momentum back in their favour, a momentum that had been elusive throughout the season.Deshpande's wholehearted effort reflected in his figures of 4/27 off three overs. Particularly impactful were his three wickets during the powerplay, which dismantled the formidable Sunrisers Hyderabad batting order, led by Travis Head.In terms of individual performances for IPL 2024 Purple Cap list, Mustafizur Rahman's exceptional bowling performance saw him claim two wickets, elevating him to the second position in the IPL Purple Cap List. Rahman now has 14 wickets in 8 innings, tying with Purple Cap leader Jasprit Bumrah of Mumbai Indians, who has taken 14 wickets in 9 innings. However, Bumrah retains the top spot due to his superior economy and average.Also See:Harshal Patel of Punjab Kings follows closely behind in third place in the Purple Cap race, also with 14 wickets in 9 innings, but his economy and average are not as impressive as Bumrah and Rahman's. Matheesha Pathirana of CSK also had a noteworthy performance in the match, claiming two wickets, bringing his total to 13 wickets in 6 innings, securing him the fourth spot on the purple cap list. T Natarajan is in fifth place, having taken 13 wickets in 7 innings, including the crucial dismissal of Ruturaj Gaikwad for 98.In the upcoming match between Mumbai Indians and Lucknow Super Giants, Jasprit Bumrah's track record against key LSG batsmen is notable. He has dismissed K.L. Rahul, Nicholas Pooran, and Devdutt Padikkal twice each in previous encounters. This statistic adds an interesting dimension to the contest between Bumrah and the LSG batting lineup.",The IPL Purple Cap 2024 will be the largest in the history of the Indian Premier League. The cap will be worth an estimated $1.2 billion. It is the largest cap in the league's history. It will also be the most expensive in the world.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109681945,imgsize-59894,width-400,resizemode-4/109681945.jpg"

Delhi Capitals' Rishabh Pant is on fifth place with 398 runs in 11 matches.Earlier, in match 48th of IPL 2024, Lucknow Super Giants secured a thrilling four-wicket victory against Mumbai Indians at the Ekana Cricket Stadium in the ongoing IPL 2024, thanks to yet another rescue act by Marcus Stoinis. Despite a shaky start and a middle-order collapse, Stoinis played a pivotal role, ensuring victory for the hosts.In the face of a challenging chase of 145 runs, LSG encountered early difficulties, but skipper KL Rahul and Marcus Stoinis steadied the ship with a crucial 58-run partnership. While Rahul showcased solidity with his 28-run contribution, Stoinis took charge, anchoring the innings with a well-compiled 62.KL Rahul's innings of 28 runs in the match helped him secure the fourth position in the IPL 2024 orange cap race. He crossed the 400-run mark for the season, currently tallying 406 runs in 10 innings. Rahul became the fourth batter in the season to reach the 400-run mark.Virat Kohli, continuing his scorching form, added another half-century to his tally against Gujarat Titans. He displayed a remarkable strike rate against their spinners and became the first player to surpass the 500-run mark for the season, further solidifying his lead in the orange cap race.Earlier, Ruturaj Gaikwad's exceptional knock of 98 runs almost saw him reaching another century and guided CSK to a crucial victory against SRH. This outstanding performance boosted him to the second place on the orange cap list, with a total of 447 runs in just 9 innings, trailing only behind Virat Kohli of RCB.Sai Sudarshan's composed half-century against RCB also keeps him in contention, closely trailing with 418 runs in 10 innings, securing the third spot in the highest run-scorers' list. Rishabh Pant's 27-run innings in his last match has propelled him to the fifth position in the race for the IPL 2024 Orange Cap, with a total of 398 runs in 11 innings.","The IPL Orange Cap is worth an estimated $1.2 billion. The team is made up of players from the IPL, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. The IPL is one of the richest teams in the world.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109761972,imgsize-40072,width-400,resizemode-4/109761972.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In today's IPL 2024 match, Mumbai Indians (MI) are set to face off against Kolkata Knight Riders KKR ) at the Wankhede Stadium. MI finds themselves struggling at the ninth spot on the IPL 2024 points table , having secured only three wins out of nine matches so far. On the contrary, KKR stands at the second position with six victories under their belt.KKR, led by Shreyas Iyer, is in a relatively comfortable position regarding playoff qualifications, with 12 points from six wins out of nine matches.However, they must address their recent inconsistency issues, especially after suffering three losses in their last six outings. Despite a setback against Punjab Kings, KKR displayed resilience by bouncing back with a convincing seven-wicket victory over Delhi Capitals.On the other hand, MI's hopes for a playoff berth seem bleak, even with five more games remaining in the league stage. Even if they manage to win all their remaining matches, they can only accumulate a maximum of 16 points, leaving them somewhere in the middle of the points table without posing a significant challenge to the consistently performing teams.The historical head-to-head record between MI and KKR heavily favours Mumbai, with a commanding 23-9 lead.

Conversely, the lowest total recorded is 125/9 by Mumbai Indians against Rajasthan Royals, indicating the variability of performances at the venue.Considering the pitch conditions , fantasy cricket enthusiasts should prioritize selecting batsmen in their XI, as the surface is expected to provide favourable conditions for stroke-making. Additionally, pacers can capitalize on the early assistance offered by the pitch, particularly those who bowl with the new ball, making them valuable picks for fantasy teams., representing Mumbai Indians (MI) in IPL 2024, has been a standout performer with the ball, scalping an impressive tally of 14 wickets in 10 matches.

Rohit Sharma's 20:20 spin vision: Indian skipper says he wanted four tweakers in T20 World Cup squad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/rohit-sharmas-2020-spin-vision-indian-skipper-says-he-wanted-four-tweakers-in-t20-world-cup-squad/articleshow/109800346.cms,"India's games start at 10 AM and dew will not play a major role

Dube for middle-order power

'In IPL, performances change daily'

MUMBAI: Keeping in mind the conditions in the Caribbean, where the wickets are likely to be low, slow and sluggish, the unusually early start timings for India's matches - 10 am local time - and perhaps also the ordinary form of their pacers barring Jasprit Bumrah , India have clearly devised a bowling plan for the upcoming T20 World Cup based around a heavy diet of spin.While Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel are the left-arm spinning allrounders in the squad, Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal are the two wrist spinners. On Thursday, captain Rohit Sharma , while trying to avoid giving out too much in terms of team strategy, justified the logic of having picked four spinners and just three pacers in the 15-member squad.""I don't want to go too much into details. I'm sure opposition captains are listening to this. I wanted four spinners. We've played a lot of cricket there (Caribbean). We know what the conditions are like. With a morning start at 10-10.30am, there's a little bit of technical aspect involved in this,"" Rohit said.""The reason for picking four spinners is something I won't reveal now. I wanted four spinners. With two of them being allrounders (Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja) and two attacking options (Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal), it gives you balance. Based on the opposition, we can decide who to play,"" the captain stressed.""Maybe when I do the first press conference upon landing, I'll give more details,"" he added.After India's failures in the last two T20 World Cups, it's clear that Rohit and the selectors wanted someone to do the heavy lifting in the middle overs against spinners, where acceleration has been a big problem.In that aspect, the skipper is banking on Mumbai allrounder Shivam Dube, who has been in sizzling form for the Chennai Super Kings in the last three IPLs now and has shown the ability to tonk the spinners.In the IPL so far, Dube has smashed 350 runs in 10 matches at a strike rate of 171.56 (average 50.00), in a tally which includes 26 sixes. In the three-match T20I series against Afghanistan at home in January, he carted 124 runs in three innings at a strike-rate of 158.97.""The one thing we really looked at was middle-overs hitting. The top-order hitting has been alright, hasn't been bad, but there are options there as well. In the middle overs, we wanted someone to come and play that role where he can play freely without worrying about who is bowling and who is not. We picked Shivam Dube based on the IPL and a few games before the IPL as well,"" Rohit said.The Indian captain expects Dube to chip in with the ball too, even though he has bowled just one over in this IPL. ""I know Shivam has not bowled much, but he's a seasoned cricketer who bowls a lot of overs in red-ball cricket. If we need Shivam to bowl a few overs, he will bowl. Hardik as well.""Rohit revealed that he had ""70-80%"" of India's World Cup-bound squad in his mind before the IPL.""You make the playing XI in your mind and work around it. The talk of what our final 15 started much before the IPL. In the IPL, performances change every day. Anyone will come and score a hundred or take five wickets.""",India's games start at 10 am local time and dew will not play a major role. Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel are the left-arm spinning allrounders in the squad. Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal are the two wrist spinners.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109800325,imgsize-56390,width-400,resizemode-4/109800325.jpg"
IPL 2024: RCB hope power-hitter Will Jacks leads from the front against Gujarat Titans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-2024-rcb-hope-power-hitter-will-jacks-leads-from-the-front-against-gujarat-titans/articleshow/109830403.cms,"|

BENGALURU: The scorching heat in Karnataka this summer has sent the mercury levels north and Friday afternoon rain brought huge relief to a parched Bengaluru. While the city rejoiced, the conditions will have Royal Challengers Bengaluru worried.Languishing at the bottom of the points table with three wins from 10 matches, the Bengaluru franchise is clinging to a flimsy thread of hope of making the playoffs.A rain-marred contest against a struggling Gujarat Titans at the M Chinnaswamy stadium will wash away even the mathematical chance Faf du Plessis and his men have of advancing in the competition.Having failed to come together as a unit, RCB have felt the heat this season. After six losses on the trot, they have belatedly found their footing with back-to-back wins with their last one - a commanding nine-wicket win against their Saturday night opponents Gujarat. The visitors have two points and a win more than the hosts, but find themselves in a similar position in the race to playoffs.Less than a week after losing to RCB on home turf, Shubman Gill and his men are here for the return fixture, hoping to cash in on RCB's wobbling fortunes at home - one win in five outings.Virat Kohli , the second highest run-getter of the season with 500 runs, is the only Indian player on either side to have made the T20 World Cup cut, and will look to continue with his consistent form. But the focus in the weekend gala will be on English all-rounderWill Jacks .Having remained in the dugout for five matches, Jacks made his IPL debut against Mumbai Indians but set the league on fire last week with his unbeaten 41-ball 100. The 25-year-old left GT's spin ace Rashid Khan and pacer Mohit Sharma scarred, milking the duo for 57 runs off 11 deliveries.RCB's loyal legion will hope for the youngster to replicate the form here. RCB's batting line-up which has been let down by inconsistency, will have to bring their act together.Gujarat too will hope for the batters to come good, especially in the Powerplay which has been a grey area for the team this season.

Five-time champions Mumbai Indians are all but out of the race to IPL 2024 playoffs. Going through one of their worst seasons in IPL history, Hardik Pandya & Co. faced their eighth defeat in 11 matches, losing to Kolkata Knight Riders by 24 runs on their home ground, Wankhede Stadium , on Friday.The defeat, which was MI's first against KKR at the Wankhede in 12 years, once again brought Hardik 's captaincy in focus.""This was such a good team on paper but was not managed well. The questions that were being raised about Hardik Pandya's captaincy were absolutely correct,"" said former India pacer Irfan Pathan, analysing the game in a video on social media.KKR put up 169 on the board, thanks to a half-century by Venkatesh Iyer (70 off 52 balls) and an equally crucial 31-ball 42 by Manish Pandey, despite MI having the visitors on the ropes at 57/5 in just the seventh over.""When you had KKR's five wickets for just 57 runs, there was no need to give Naman Dhir three overs in a row.

That allowed Venkatesh Iyer and Manish Pandey to put a partnership together....Where you could have bowled KKR out for 150, they went on to make 170, and that turned out to be the difference,"" added Pathan, raising questions on captain Hardik's decisions on the field.Mitchell Starc , the most expensive player in IPL history, finally did justice to his price tag with match-winning figures of 4/33 as Mumbai folded up for 145 in 18.5 overs despite Suryakumar Yadav's 35-ball 56. Varun Chakravarthy, Sunil Narine and Andre Russell took two wickets each.""KKR now looks like a 'khatarnak' (dangerous) team after Mitchell Starc's return to form. They had just one weak link in fast bowling, which was Mitchell Starc's bowling. The way he bowled to Tim David must be appreciated,"" analysed Irfan.The win took KKR to No. 2 on the points table with seven wins in 10 matches.Coming back to MI captaincy, which had changed hands from Rohit Sharma to Hardik before the start of this season, Irfan said MI is not playing as a unit under Hardik's captaincy.""In cricket, captaincy has a huge effect and it's very important to manage, which did not happen. Mumbai Indians isn't looking like a team that is playing as a unit, and this aspect needs to be looked at going forward for Mumbai Indians. Players need to respect the captain and also accept him appreciably, this is very important. That, I think, could not be seen on the field,"" the former cricketer cum commentator said.""Whatever the reason is, they have to think about it and improve.""",Mumbai Indians lose to Kolkata Knight Riders by 24 runs at Wankhede Stadium.

With their seventh victory in IPL 2024 at Mumbai Indians ' (MI) fortress Wankhede Stadium on Friday, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) not just got a foot inside the playoffs but also fixed the one weak-link they had so far in their campaign -- the form of fast bowler Mitchell Starc .The Australian spearhead, for whom KKR emptied their pockets at the IPL auction to make him the costliest player ever at Rs 24.75 crore, finally did justice to his price tag with a match-winning spell of 4/33 in Kolkata's 24-run win after putting up a below-par 169 on the board.Starc's spell broke the back of Mumbai Indians' run-chase, which folded up in 18.5 overs at 145 all out. The win is KKR's first in 12 years at the Wankhede Stadium.Before Friday, Starc had just seven wickets in 8 matches, and his patchy form was one of the major concerns KKR hoped to fix before the knockout phase of the tournament.""KKR now looks like a 'khatarnak' (dangerous) team after Mitchell Starc's return to form.

MUMBAI: With the Wankhede Stadium pitch holding up a bit, Kolkata Knight Riders were banking on spin duo of Sunil Narine and Varun Chakravarthy to tame the Mumbai Indians ' batters on their home turf.The combo didn't disappoint as they finished with combined figures of 8-0-44-4- both taking identical 4-0-22-2- to break the back of the MI chase and almost end their playoff hopes.KKR, with their 24-run win, moved to 14 points and a step closer to a knockout spot. MI's eighth defeat of the season leaves them second last on the table with six points. It was KKR's second win against MI at the venue in 11 games and the first since 2012.Defending a low total of 169 was never easy at the Wankhede which has small boundaries, but KKR bowlers stuck to their plans and crafted MI's downfall. It started with Mitchell Starc (4/33) cleaning up Ishan Kishan after he was hit for 10 runs off two balls. The spinners took over thereafter and made sure that MI's middle-order was kept in check.Not only did they bowl economically but kept taking wickets as well to put the home side under pressure.Narine accounted for Rohit Sharma (11, 12b; 1x6), who came in as an impact sub, and Nehal Wadhera (6, 11b; 1x4) while Chakravarty dismissed Naman Dhir (11, 11b; 2x4) and Tilak Varma (4, 6b). Skipper Hardik Pandya 's dismal run with the bat continued as he played a loose shot off Andre Russell (2/30) which left MI reeling at 71-6.Suryakumar Yadav gave MI a glimmer of hope with his 35-ball 56. He started sedately with wickets falling around him but once the spinners had finished their quota, he opened his shoulders and took on the KKR pacers. He took 20 runs off Vaibhav Arora in the 14th over to bring down the equation to 60 runs from 36 balls.But when it looked like he would take the match away from KKR, he skied a full toss from Russell, which was well caught by keeper Phil Salt, and with it MI's hopes ended.Starc rounded off the proceedings with three wickets in the 19th over to seal emphatic win. He had Tim David caught at long-off after being hit for a six, Piyush Chawla's chip could only find Narine at extra cover and the left-arm pacer put the icing on the cake by cleaning up Gerald Coetzee.Earlier, things looked grim for KKR when they could post just 169 on the board. The only solace for them was a 62-ball 83 partnership between Venkatesh Iyer (70, 52b; 6x4, 3x6) and impact substitute Manish Pandey (42, 31b; 2x4, 2x6) in a below-par batting effort.Either side of that association, there was carnage. MI reduced KKR to 57 for five by 6.1 overs and when it looked like the Iyer-Pandey combo was ready to launch, quick blows- four wickets to be precise-between overs 17 and 18 made sure that KKR couldn't end their innings with a flourish.First to depart was Pandey, playing his first match of the season, off the bowling of Hardik Pandya (2/44). In the same over the dangerous Andre Russell (7, 2b; 1x6) was run out after a mix-up with Iyer.",KKR move to 14 points and a step closer to a knockout spot. MI's eighth defeat of the season leaves them second last on the table with six points. It was KKR's second win against MI at the venue in 11 games and the first since 2012.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109830058,imgsize-102676,width-400,resizemode-4/109830058.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan got a three-year ban from the stadium for getting embroiled in an argument with security staff, the last time Kolkata Knight Riders won a match against Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede before Friday.And ending the 12-year drought after the infamous win, KKR finally breached Fort Wankhede -- for the first time since 2012 -- and put the hosts almost out of the reckoning of the playoffs race.As the Knights successfully defended 169, the team came together to break the jinx at the venue, putting a smile of the faces of principal owner Shah Rukh and mentor Gautam Gambhir.KKR's bowling unit fired in unison to win a battle of attrition against five-time champions.While the batters were guilty of not working out their game plan on the go in the first half to be bowled out for just 169 with Venkatesh Iyer contributing 70, Mumbai Indians' underperforming batters stood no chance on a tricky wicket which demanded both application and patience. They were all-out for 145 in 18.5 overs with IPL 's biggest buy ever Mitchell Starc (4/33) leading the way with his four-for.As KKR registered their 7th win of the season, taking another big leap towards playoffs and pushing Mumbai out of the knock-outs contention, several record were broken and rewritten in the game between the two heavyweights.First win for KKR in 12 years at Wankhede - only previous win over MI at Wankhede came back in 2012, with Sunil Narine returning 4/15 from 3.1 overs in a 32-run win.: 11: 2: 9The match was just the fourth instance in 33 head-to-head matches in which MI got bowled out against KKR.The game was also just the fourth in IPL where both teams got all-out, Nagpur, 2010, Kolkata, 2017, Mumbai (Wankhede), 2018, Mumbai (Wankhede), 2024MI pacer Jasprit Bumrah continued his IPL dominance with record-extending three-fer- Jasprit Bumrah (131 innings)- Yuzvendra Chahal (154 innings)- Lasith Malinga (122 innings)- Amit Mishra (162 innings)It was the fifth loss for MI while chasing this IPL season: 6: 1 (vs RCB): 5","First win for KKR in 12 years at Wankhede - only previous win over MI came back in 2012, with Sunil Narine returning 4/15 from 3.1 overs in a 32-run win.

NEW DELHI: Former India skipper Sourav Ganguly reassured Rinku Singh not to be disheartened by his exclusion from India's T20 World Cup squad, emphasizing that it was a tactical decision by the team management.Ganguly explained that India opted for an ""extra spinner"" considering the spinning conditions expected in the West Indies, which might have impacted the selection process.Rinku, known for his explosive batting and finishing skills with a strike rate of over 176 in 15 T20Is and as a key player for Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL, was likely edged out due to this strategic choice.""It's West Indies.

Runs continue to come off his bat in the ongoing Indian Premier League and the BCCI selectors had no second thoughts about including his name in India's T20 World Cup squad. Those two facts highlight that even in the twilight of his career, you discount Virat Kohli at your own peril.There was a lot of talk about his strike rate in T20 cricket before the announcement of India's squad for the T20 World Cup to be held this June, but all the cricket experts had him in their 15-member line-ups, which also firmly reflected in the official Indian squad that was revealed earlier this week.Irfan Pathan, former India pacer cum commentator, went a step ahead to predict that when time comes for a stiff chase during the T20 World Cup, it will be Virat Kohli who will be standing there till the end.""Jab waqt aata hai, yehi player akela khada hota hai, Virat Kohli (when it's required, he is the player who stands alone),"" said Pathan while talking on Star Sports (see video below).""Believe me, there will be a point during the T20 World Cup when there will be need, and the guy you will find chasing it till the end will be him, Virat Kohli.""Virat has already touched the figure of 500 runs in this IPL , which includes a century and four fifties, at a strike rate of 147.49, which can't be considered poor.To further stress on Kohli's proven track record while chasing, which also earned him the nickname 'chase master', Pathan mentioned the India vs Pakistan match in Melbourne during the T20 World Cup where Kohli famously hit Haris Rauf for two sixes to bring India back into contention.Virat's 53-ball 82 not out took India to a famous four-wicket win.""Pick all the big matches, especially when chasing, you won't find a bigger player than him in T20 cricket. He has a calculative mind. (He is like) 'You keep talking about strike rate, I will keep talking about chasing runs and the target.' Never doubt Virat Kohli,"" said Irfan.""I was saying the same thing even when the squad was not yet selected. He is a big-match player, a World Cup player. When the World Cup comes, he will have an impact.""The T20 World Cup runs from June 2 to 29 and will be jointly hosted by the West Indies and USA.India play their opening group match against Ireland on June 5 in New York, followed by the big game against Pakistan at the same venue on June 9.

NEW DELHI: Renowned Inter Miami star and eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi took a break from his football duties to attend the Miami Heat playoff game against the Boston Celtics on Monday night.Accompanied by his teammates Jordi Alba , Sergio Busquets , and Luis Suarez , who also played with him at Barcelona, Messi arrived at the arena just before tip-off.The group, with some wearing Heat attire and Busquets donning a Heat hoodie, entered through the players' parking garage and were escorted via a VIP entrance to their suite seats above the lower level.Although Messi had previously visited the arena for at least one other event, this marked his first arranged attendance at a Heat game since relocating to Miami last year.Inter Miami have been performing exceptionally well in the Major League Soccer (MLS) this season, boasting a 6-2-3 record and currently leading the Eastern Conference with the highest points tally in the league.Messi's contributions have been instrumental, with two goals and an assist in Inter Miami's recent 4-1 victory over New England on Saturday. He has achieved the remarkable feat of having multiple goal contributions in five consecutive matches, a first for any MLS player.Throughout his illustrious career, Messi has amassed over 800 goals for both club and country, solidifying his status as one of the greatest scorers in soccer history.His crowning achievement came in 2022 when he led Argentina to the World Cup title, scoring twice in the final against France. The match ended in a thrilling 3-3 draw, with Argentina ultimately triumphing 4-2 on penalty kicks.","Lionel Messi attended the Miami Heat playoff game against the Boston Celtics.

ISL: Mumbai see off Goa to set up final showdown with Bagan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/isl-mumbai-see-off-goa-to-set-up-final-showdown-with-bagan/articleshow/109703553.cms,"MUMBAI: Jorge Pereyra Diaz wanted to lap up every second of it. The Argentinian striker had just given Mumbai the lead in the second leg of their Indian Super League semifinal against FC Goa , putting the Islanders 4-2 ahead on aggregate, and he was in the mood to celebrate.Joining him were thousands of Mumbai City fans who made sure their delight was heard around the 7000-capacity Mumbai Football Arena.They had to wait until the 69th minute for that joyous moment, and it was to get even better seven minutes from the end of regulation time.This time it was Lallianzuala Chhangte who timed his run perfectly from inside his half to latch on to a sublime assist from Vikram Partap Singh, neatly take it past Goa goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh, and tap the ball into the net to make it 2-0. For the second time in five days, Goa were left crestfallen.They had been looking good to arrive here with a 2-0 lead from their first leg at Fatorda last Wednesday. But in a matter of six crazy minutes in the closing stages of that game, the Gaurs watched in agony as Chhangte and Vikram turned that lead into a 3-2 win in favour of the Islanders.Despite that slap in the face, Manolo Marquez's side, backed by around 250 travelling fans, would have come to Mumbai encouraged by their form on the road, having scored in their last nine away games. It's another matter that they were up against the league's meanest defence, and the latter eventually won.Mumbai's 2-0 victory on Monday and a 5-2 win on aggregate has earned them the right to take on Mohun Bagan Super Giant in Saturday's final. Petr Kratky's side will look at it as a chance to avenge their narrow defeat to the Kolkata giants a fortnight ago on the last day of the league stage which saw Bagan thwart Mumbai's hopes of becoming the first team to defend the League Winners Shield.For now though, the Islanders will cherish a win they had to work extremely hard for, against an opponent who has challenged them each time they have met this season.They may have endured a nightmare finish to the first leg of this semifinal but Goa managed to make a positive start here, looking clearly to their American winger Noah Sadaoui to launch attacks down the left channel.After his tremendous impact as a second half substitute in Fatorda, where he produced two sublime assists for the goals that contributed to Mumbai's jaw-dropping comeback, Jayesh Rane was duly rewarded with a starting spot on this occasion. But the midfielder struggled to get his teeth into the game for most of the first half.The home side soon settled and would come the closest to scoring in the opening 45 minutes when they struck the post twice, first through a Tiri header off a corner, and later when Chhangte wasn't able to curl his left-footed effort enough.In his pre-match press conference, Marquez had admitted that the Gaurs could well find themselves in a situation where they would have to take increased risks. That moment arrived in the second half when Mumbai captain Rahul Bheke saw his header off Yoel van Nieff's corner cleared off the goal line by Goa defender Nim Dorjee Tamang. But Pereyra Diaz was there, as he usually is, perfectly placed, to poke the ball home.Vikram has scored eight times for the Islanders in the league this season, including a hat-trick against NorthEast United in March, but the forward showed how well he can create opportunities too, releasing Chhangte with a delightful pass around Goa's defence, as Mumbai's number 7 got the home support going again with a fine finish.There are likely to be questions raised about the relevance of the ISL playoffs going forward, with the format now really holding no significance apart from the prize money on offer. What there can be little doubt about though, is the two best teams over the course of the 2023-24 campaign will clash for the trophy at Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday!","Mumbai City beat FC Goa 4-2 on aggregate to reach Indian Super League final.

She swiftly wrapped up the first set in just over half an hour against the 18th seed.The second set followed a similar pattern, with Keys unable to pose significant challenges to Swiatek.

""I wasn't really thinking about what happened last year. But repeating this result is a great thing.""I'll have a chance to play a nice match in two days. So it's really exciting. I'm happy overall with the whole tournament.""Swiatek, a four-times Grand Slam champion, is now the youngest player to reach 10 WTA level finals on clay since Swiss Martina Hingis in 2000.","Top seed Iga Swiatek cruised past Madison Keys to secure a spot in the consecutive finals of the Madrid Open.
