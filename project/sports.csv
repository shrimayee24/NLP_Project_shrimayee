Cricket holds a special place in the hearts of millions across India, with fans passionately following every move of their favorite cricketers. Legends like Sachin Tendulkar , Mahendra Singh Dhoni, and Virat Kohli enjoy massive fanbases, with their fame reaching almost mythical proportions within the country. However, this intense recognition doesn't always extend beyond India's borders, as a recent viral video highlights.A video recently surfaced on Instagram that caught the attention of cricket enthusiasts.The clip, shot in a foreign country, features a host stopping random passersby, asking them if they know who Virat Kohli is or if they've even heard of cricket. Much to the shock of Indian fans, the responses were overwhelmingly negative.In the video, the host begins by asking two men, ""Do you know who Virat Kohli is?"" Both men, without hesitation, admit they have no idea who the cricket star is. The host then turns to a woman and poses the same question, ""Have you heard of Virat Kohli?"" Initially confused, she too confirms that she’s unfamiliar with the name.The video continues as the host approaches more people, asking the same questions. Each time, the answer remains the same—none of the individuals interviewed had ever heard of Virat Kohli or cricket. This highlights the stark difference in the sport's popularity within India and globally. While Kohli is revered as a cricketing superstar in his homeland, cricket remains a relatively niche sport in many other parts of the world, where other sports like soccer or basketball dominate.Since being posted, the video has garnered over 1.6 million views on Instagram and sparked a flood of reactions. Thousands of users have liked, shared, and commented on the post, expressing everything from surprise to amusement.One user quipped, ""If you ask about Ronaldo, they'll know,"" referring to the global fame of football icons like Cristiano Ronaldo, whose recognition transcends borders. Another user called Virat Kohli ""the king"" in the comments, showcasing the immense pride Indian fans take in their cricket stars.A user named Suraj pointed out the obvious cultural divide, stating, ""When cricket isn’t famous worldwide, how will they know Virat Kohli?"" Another amused commenter asked, ""Brother, which country have you gone to?"" as others filled the comment section with shock emojis and disbelief.",Cricket holds a special place in the hearts of millions across India.

Ricky Ponting reveals reason behind split with Delhi Capitals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ricky-ponting-reveals-reason-behind-split-with-delhi-capitals/articleshow/113532825.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ricky Ponting , the former Australian captain, has been appointed as the head coach of the Punjab Kings (PBKS) in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Following his departure from the Delhi Capitals (DC), Ponting revealed that his availability had become an issue, leading the franchise to seek a full-time head coach.Ponting will take charge of PBKS starting from IPL 2025 , after ending his seven-year association with DC two months ago.His appointment marks the third head coach for PBKS within four seasons, as the team finished ninth in the 2024 IPL season and has not qualified for the playoffs since 2014.One of Ponting's primary tasks will be identifying players for retention ahead of the upcoming season, pending the finalisation of the IPL's retention rules, reported ANI.Ponting began his IPL journey as a player with the Kolkata Knight Riders in the inaugural 2008 season. He later joined the Mumbai Indians , stepping down as captain in 2013 to allow Rohit Sharma to lead the team to their first title. He continued with MI as an advisor in 2014 and then as head coach in 2015 and 2016.In 2018, Ponting took over as head coach of the Delhi Capitals, guiding the team to three consecutive playoff appearances from 2019 to 2021, including their first final in 2020.Ponting's stint with DC ended in July 2024, after which he led the Washington Freedom to a title-winning campaign in the Major League Cricket (MLC).""I felt like we created a really good family environment there. As I said, I understand what they want; they said to me that my availability was becoming an issue. And they wanted to pretty much have a full-time head coach. I could not commit to that, so I was disappointed that it ended, but I understand the direction they wanted to head going forward.""""Everyone that I have been there with, has had a great time. You have only to look at some of the social media posts that Delhi put out straightaway to understand that a lot of the people involved in the franchise were disappointed that I wasn't continuing as well. But the decisions were made.""Ponting acknowledged the pressure of winning a trophy as a coach but welcomed it.""That is the thing that makes coaching inviting to me. I like having that pressure. It is as close to getting back to playing as you can possibly get. From the moment I finished playing, when that competition stops in your life, it is really hard to replace that again. The closest thing I could find to playing was getting back in the cricket team's changing room being a coach and feeling like you are actually playing again. And coaching against guys that I might have played against and guys that are coaching that I played against--I want to beat them. Simple. A cricket changing room is where I'm supposed to be.""Reflecting on his IPL journey, Ponting called coaching MI an ""awesome experience"" and described the DC changing room as a ""special place"" despite not winning a trophy.""But we made a couple of big slip-ups in our mega-auction a couple of years ago [2022] and even probably our player retentions, and that set us back quite a way. And even this year [2024], little things went against us again, with Rishabh [Pant, DC captain] being suspended for a game that we had to win. We missed the playoffs on run rate. Little things like that add up. The results in T20 games are decided by really small margins. And then our season can be defined by really small margins as well. And we have been on the wrong end of those for a couple of years at DC.""Ponting noted that coaching in the IPL has evolved and is now more specific, with teams covering every aspect by appointing specialized coaches.""So you have a lot of the best coaches in the world there at once. And when you have the best coaches and the best players, you are guaranteed to have high-quality cricket. What the IPL has done by having all of these coaches is, I think, the reason that India are actually as good as they are. There has always been that talent in India, but to have that talent around the best coaches for two or three months every year has helped them become better players.""Ponting also mentioned that many IPL franchises are moving towards having a full-time coaching staff. He himself considered not taking such a role due to his other commitments and need for family time.Key performers for Punjab last season included Harshal Patel , who won the Purple Cap for the second time, and the uncapped Indian players Shashank Singh and Ashutosh Sharma.The squad also includes talents like left-arm fast bowler Arshdeep Singh, wicketkeeper-batter Jitesh Sharma, and leg-spinner Rahul Chahar. Notable overseas players in the team are England's Sam Curran, Liam Livingstone, Jonny Bairstow, and South African pacer Kagiso Rabada.With Shikhar Dhawan 's recent retirement, identifying a new captain will also be a priority for Ponting and the team management.","Ricky Ponting has been appointed as the head coach of the Punjab Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL) Ponting will take charge of PBKS starting from IPL 2025 after ending his seven-year association with Delhi Capitals.

NEW DELHI: Batting maestro Virat Kohli couldn't help but lighten the mood with a hilarious remark aimed at Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan during the second day of the first Test in Chennai.Kohli found himself at the crease early in the second innings, just like the first, as India lost two quick wickets in the form of skipper Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal within the first seven overs.Following the departure of the openers, Virat Kohli and Shubman Gill steadied the innings, helping India surpass the 50-run mark.

Kohli’s innings consisted of 37 balls, marking another early exit for the experienced batsman.The incident occurred during India's second innings when Kohli was at the non-striker's end. The stump mic captured Kohli humorously referring to Shakib Al Hasan as 'Malinga,' a nod to the former Sri Lankan pacer Lasith Malinga , who was famous for his exceptional yorkers .Kohli's remark came as Shakib consistently delivered a series of effective yorkers, showcasing his bowling prowess and adding a light-hearted moment to the match.Kohli joked, “Tu Malinga bana hua hai, Yorker pe Yorker de raha hai!” This playful comment not only showcased Kohli's wit but also highlighted Shakib's impressive bowling performance, reminiscent of the legendary Malinga known for his deadly yorkers.Shakib, who has been a standout player for Bangladesh, took the comment in good humour, reflecting the sportsmanship that characterises cricket.","Virat Kohli made a hilarious remark aimed at Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan during the second day of the first Test in Chennai.

The 45th FIDE Chess Olympiad in Budapest has been a showcase of India's rising dominance in the chess world, with both their men's and women's teams displaying exceptional performance. However, China's decision-making regarding their lineup has raised eyebrows among chess enthusiasts and analysts.India's open team has been the story of the tournament, maintaining a perfect 16/16 score after eight rounds.The team, led by young prodigies like Gukesh Dommaraju and Arjun Erigaisi , has not lost a single game out of 32 played. Their latest victory, a 3.5-0.5 win against Iran, further solidified their position at the top of the leaderboard.Gukesh's performance on board one has been particularly noteworthy. He leads the race for individual gold on the top board, ahead of even Magnus Carlsen. Arjun Erigaisi, playing on board three, has been equally impressive, winning seven out of eight games and reaching a live rating of 2792.While India soars, China's strategy has come under scrutiny. The defending world champion, Ding Liren , has been conspicuously absent from the Chinese lineup in recent rounds. This decision has perplexed many, especially considering the upcoming World Championship match between Ding and Gukesh.Speculation suggests that China is holding back Ding to prevent him from revealing his preparation for the World Championship. However, this strategy may be costing China valuable points in the Olympiad.In a crucial match against India, where China needed a win, they opted to field Wei Yi against Gukesh on the top board instead of Ding. This decision backfired as Gukesh managed to grind out a win in the endgame against Wei Yi. The absence of Ding, the incumbent World Champion, from board one in such a critical match goes against the usual norm and has been a topic of much debate.In the women's section, Poland has once again proven to be India's nemesis. Just as in the 2022 Olympiad, Poland handed India their first defeat, winning the match 2.5-1.5. This result has created a three-way tie for first place between India, Poland, and Kazakhstan, all with 14 match points.The match was a nail-biter, with Poland's victory secured by IM Alina Kashlinskaya's win over GM Harika Dronavalli on the top board. Despite IM Divya Deshmukh's win for India, a last-minute mistake by IM Vantika Agrawal allowed Poland to clinch the match.With three rounds to go, the tournament is wide open in both sections. In the open category, India will face a stern test against Uzbekistan in the next round, a rematch of their crucial encounter from the 2022 Olympiad. Uzbekistan, along with Hungary, is breathing down India's neck, just two points behind.In the women's section, the upcoming round will see Poland take on Kazakhstan, while India faces the United States - another team that defeated them in 2022.Several players have stood out with exceptional individual performances. In the open section, Arjun Erigaisi's dominant run has caught everyone's attention. In the women's section, 17-year-old Eman Sawan from Palestine has won all seven of her games, with her performance rating calculated at an impressive 2631.As the 45th FIDE Chess Olympiad enters its final stages, all eyes will be on India to see if they can maintain their perfect run in the open section and bounce back in the women's. Meanwhile, China's strategy with Ding Liren will continue to be a point of interest, especially as it may impact their final standing in the tournament.The Olympiad has once again proven to be a thrilling showcase of chess talent from around the world, with emerging stars and established champions alike contributing to a memorable event. As we head into the final rounds, the chess world eagerly anticipates the crowning of the new Olympiad champions.","India's open team has been the story of the tournament, maintaining a perfect 16/16 score after eight rounds.

India vs Bangladesh 1st Test: India end Day Two 308 ahead and firmly in control,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/bangladesh-in-india/india-vs-bangladesh-1st-test-india-end-day-two-308-ahead-and-firmly-in-control/articleshow/113539725.cms,"Akash Deep

leaves an impression

CHENNAI: Midway through the second session at the MA Chidambaram Stadium , a young crop of Bangladeshi journalists got busy in a discussion about the nearest tourist spots around Chennai. Much like the captain of the Bangladesh team, Najmul Hossain Shanto, this group of scribes had thought, leading into the Test, that Bangladesh could stretch India to five days.By the end of Friday’s action in Chennai, it was crystal clear that post lunch on Sunday, they are in for a mini-vacation before the Kanpur Test.The hint of fight that the Bangladeshi pacers showed on Thursday slowly dissipated into an abject capitulation of the batting unit against an Indian attack which didn't give an inch.The class of Jasprit Bumrah (4/50) has been way too much to handle for even the best batters in world cricket in recent times, and the brittle Bangladeshi batting lineup merely added a footnote to the long list.After being bowled out for 149 in their first innings, Bangladesh conceded a lead of 227, which left fans in Chennai with tickets for Saturday's play ecstatic. The party mood was sullied just a bit late in the day by the back-to-back failures of Rohit Sharma (5) and Virat Kohli (17).Kohli, though, had got an inside edge as he missed a flick off off-spinnner Mehidy Hasan Miraz to be adjudged leg-before, but strangely he didn't ask for a referral.At stumps, entertainers Rishabh Pant (batting 12) and Shubman Gill (batting 33) were at the crease, the lead already going to 308 with seven wickets still in play. While the first half of the morning session didn't go as planned for India, with Ravindra Jadeja (86) missing out on a deserved century, the rest of the day was a master-versus-novice mismatch.That Bumrah (4/50) would be dangerous was a foregone conclusion. What made it a difficult watch for those who were looking forward to some competition was the lack of application of the Bangladeshi batters.The procession started in the first session itself when left-hander Shadman Islam shouldered arms to Bumrah bowling around the wicket and was bowled. The bounce and the movement that Bumrah generated from good length accounted for Mushfiqur Rahim, who edged one to slip, while the tail was merely cannon fodder.While Bumrah was doing what he usually does, it was Bengal pacer Akash Deep's spell that left a mark. It's true that left-handers Zakir Hasan and Mominul Haque aren't exactly big-league material, but Akash Deep hit the right length from the word go. The 27-year-old — who is very much in the reckoning for a berth in the Test squad for the Australia series — got the ball to cut back enough and to dismiss Mominul and Zakir as Bangladesh were reduced to 22-3 before lunch.Bangladesh paceman Taskin Ahmed acknowledged that the batting left a lot to be desired. But he felt that the SG ball, too, played its part in the Bangladesh capitulation. “The Indian players are used to playing with the SG ball. It does quite a bit in the first 10 overs and we probably were unable to adapt. A better performance was expected from our batters,” he said.With the back of the Bangladesh batting well and truly broken in the first session itself, it was on Litton Das and Shakib Al Hasan to stage a comeback. Both have the experience of playing in India and for a while, the duo seemed to give them a bit of hope. But it's their tendency to sweep a little too much against spinners which brought about their downfall.","After being bowled out for 149 in their first innings, Bangladesh conceded a lead of 227.

Chepauk's pitch revolution: Pacers dominate in a spinners' paradise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/bangladesh-in-india/chepauks-pitch-revolution-pacers-dominate-in-a-spinners-paradise/articleshow/113532955.cms,"NEW DELHI: Close your eyes for a moment and think back to some of the great spells at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. The first two images that might come to mind could be young spinners – one bespectacled and another with a turban - mesmerizing batters like magicians. Narendra Hirwani bagged a 16-wicket haul against West Indies in 1986. In 2001, Harbhajan Singh took 15 wickets against Australia.Naturally, expectations were high for modern-day greats Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja to dismantle the Bangladesh batting line-up at Chepauk, in keeping with tradition.However, Jasprit Bumrah , Mohammed Siraj, and Akash Deep, the pacers, seized the spotlight, sharing eight wickets among them and defying historical expectations.Such dominance by pacers at this venue has been rare since the late 70s. In 1979, a trio of Kapil Dev, Karsan Ghavri, and Dhiraj Parsana took 11 wickets in India's three-wicket win over the formidable West Indians.Since then, Chepauk has typically been known as a spinner's paradise. Yet, a shift began earlier this year during the IPL when Chennai Super Kings played on a pitch with a touch of grass against Gujarat Titans.CSK defeated GT by 63 runs, with Matheesha Pathirana, Tushar Deshpande, and Mustafizur Rahman delivering noteworthy spells, while spinners like Jadeja and Rashid Khan had ordinary figures.""It was a call made by skipper Ruturaj (Gaikwad) in his effort to maximize the resources within the CSK setup. Anyways, it was a change from the long-standing, set strategy of preparing slow tracks and using spinners to win (under MS Dhoni),"" a source familiar with the move told PTI.The new red-soil pitch at Chepauk aligns with the Indian team's vision to give more practice to their pacers ahead of the crucial tour to Australia.Having a suitable pitch is one thing, but the ability to exploit it is another. Unsurprisingly, Bumrah led the way.Watching Bumrah set up Bangladesh's lower-order batter Taskin Ahmed was exceptional.After a series of short-length bumpers keeping Taskin on edge, Bumrah rattled his stumps with a fuller delivery.It was a brilliant mix of skill – delivering a toe-crusher after using the track to bowl unsettling short balls.Seasoned off-spinner Ashwin, who went wicketless, acknowledged the pitch's transformation, which Bangladesh pacers Hasan Mahmud and Taskin also utilized well.""Chepauk is a place that we know. So, it's always special for me to play here. But in the past, when I played in the U-19 matches here, the wickets were always like this,"" Ashwin said.""It used to be hard red clay, good bounce. I never saw that surface again. So, I'm really glad to see it back,"" he added.Bangladesh will now face a two-way challenge when they bat in their second innings.","Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, and Akash Deep, the pacers, seized the spotlight, sharing eight wickets among them and defying historical expectations.

An aggressive strokemaker, the flamboyant southpaw represented India in 12 ODIs, with a knock of 57 against Sri Lanka on debut being his highest.He was also part of India's 1999 World Cup squad but didn't get a game.The Madhya Pradesh batsman was a prolific scorer in domestic cricket, scoring 7,304 runs from 119 first-class matches while he accumulated 3,768 from 112 List A games.The 52-year-old is a qualified level 'C' coach from the National Cricket Academy (NCA) and has been coaching in the domestic circuit since 2004. He has been credited with the rise of pacer Avesh Khan , batter Rajat Patidar, and all-rounder Venkatesh Iyer.Though the final modalities of the contract with KCA are being worked out, Khurasiya is expected to take charge of the team soon. However, he will have his task cut out as Kerala's Ranji Trophy campaign begins against Punjab on October 11 at St Xavier's College ground, Thumba.With less than 20 days for the tournament to start, Khurasiya will have the challenge of getting a group of players, who have been playing a lot of T20 games in the inaugural Kerala Cricket League which concluded on Wednesday, ready for the rigours of the red-ball challenge.","Former Indian batsman Amay Khurasiya is all set to take over as the coach of the Kerala cricket team.

They lost three wickets within the first 10 overs, only managing to score 27 runs.""Overall, our batting was a little bit disappointing. Yeah, there is some help for the fast bowlers, but still, we could have done much better than that. So yeah, we are disappointed,"" PTI quoted Ahmed as saying at the press conference after the day's play.""We also lost too many wickets in the first 10 (overs), which cost us our game.""At stumps on the second day, India was at 81 for 3 in their second innings, amassing an overall lead of 308 runs.Ahmed, who secured three wickets in India's first innings and one in the second, mentioned that their limited experience playing with the SG balls did not help.Bangladesh players are accustomed to playing with Kookaburra balls, which have a flatter seam compared to SG balls.""Also, playing with the SG ball is a challenge. The Indians play with SG ball since childhood, so they know how to use it properly, giving them a huge advantage,"" said the 29-year-old right-arm pacer.""We also made some mistakes with the new ball. What I felt about the SG ball and this condition is that there were some challenges, especially for the first 10-12 overs.”""India is a formidable side against any opponent at home. And everyone tries to make the most out of the home advantage, the same as we will do when we play at home soon.""When it came to bowling, Ahmed believed his side performed well overall.""Yes, yesterday we started well, and at the end of the day, (Ravichandran) Ashwin and (Ravindra) Jadeja batted well. Also, this morning, we had a good session, and then we finished them all in 37 runs by taking four more wickets.”""So overall, we bowled well. Yesterday, there was more help than today.""Ahmed commended the Indian bowlers for maintaining consistent line and length.""No doubt they all are world-class. They were more consistent with their line and lengths, and there were plenty of variations in the Indian bowling attack,"" he said.Reflecting on their historic Test win in Pakistan, Ahmed stated, ""We played overall good cricket in Pakistan, and Test cricket is something you need to be good in your department in every session.”""But, conditions are different here.""Ahmed highlighted that his team is still a work in progress.""Everyone (in the team) is concerned about it and is working on it. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses, but there is no limit to getting better.""""While we are trying to improve on it by giving our utmost, at the end of the day, it all boils down to how we execute our plans,"" he concluded.","Bangladesh dismissed for 149 in 47.1 overs on the second day's play.

So gifted, so talented. He's found ways to maximise his potential. I wish I could be him, but I'm glad I am myself,"" PTI quoted Ashwin as saying to reporters during the post-day press meet in Chennai on Friday.Ashwin acknowledged that having Jadeja at the crease helped him build his sixth Test century.""He is an exceptionally good cricketer. I'm happy for him. Likewise, in so many ways, I think watching him bat over the last couple of years has also given me insight on how better I can be,"" he added.However, their approaches to bowling are distinct. Ashwin relies on a variety of tricks to deceive batters, whereas Jadeja focuses on maintaining tight and consistent lines to yield results. Despite their different styles, they've managed to complement each other to great effect.Together, they've become India's most successful bowling duo, surpassing the previous record held by Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh , who took 501 wickets together. Ashwin emphasized their mutual respect and the joy they share in each other's success.""He keeps it really simple. He can repeat it (bowling) day in and day out. So, both of us have grown together. Both of us have done some special things. We really value one another at this stage and both of us are enjoying each other's success more than ever before,"" Ashwin explained.The duo's job isn't finished yet, as they will need to bowl in tandem again in Bangladesh's second innings to secure a win for India. Ashwin has already strategized how to tackle the Bangladeshi batsmen, even though he went wicketless in their first innings, which ended at 149.""I think there's a bit more up-and-down bounce. I would say the carry is there still. It's probably quickened up a touch (today) and then it's again gone on the slower side. I really do think as this game pans out, if at all it gets to the fourth-fifth day, it will turn for certain.""Ashwin elaborated that the key challenge moving forward will be to handle spin effectively, as the pitch is expected to assist spinners in the later stages of the match.""But the challenge going ahead in this pitch would be to negotiate spin, as the surface in due course will be able to do its tricks on the batters,"" he said.Ashwin's insights reflect the duo's understanding of the game and their ability to adapt to different conditions, aiming to steer India to victory once again with their effective partnership.",Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja have redefined teamwork in Indian cricket.

So, I was trying to assess my options because when I tried to bowl a little fuller, there wasn't much deviation. I was just trying to think about how I could make run-scoring difficult. That's what I focused on, and luckily, I got the outside edge,"" Bumrah told JioCinema after stumps on Day 2.Bumrah also talked about the adjustments he needed to make in his variations because of the prevailing conditions.""I had no other option because when I tried to bowl a length ball, the ball wasn't doing anything, and the ball wasn't reversing either. So, I had to try something because, as a bowler, you have to experiment when there's not much happening. There was no grip on the wicket, so I used one of those tactics that I've used in domestic cricket as well. It worked today, and that experience helped me out.""He went on to share insights into his use of bouncers in the match, saying, ""In Test cricket, I don't usually bowl as many bouncers. Given the weather was harsh and I'm just getting back into Test cricket, I had to make adjustments. The ball had become wet because of sweat, and the seam was also wet. So, I had to use different options to get a wicket and make run-scoring difficult. These are things you learn as a lower-order batter too.""Bumrah then shared the discussions he had with captain Rohit Sharma about their tactical approach to the bowling attack for the day.""He understands the bowlers very well. The weather was harsh, and everyone is coming back after a while - we're playing a Test match after some time, so everyone needs to get into the groove. The chat was about short spells to make them effective. We have fast bowlers who want to bowl fast and spinners who can create an impact. When the ball is new, the seam is hard, and there is some lateral movement, so we wanted to capitalize on that,"" he said.""The plan wasn't necessarily to bowl fuller because there was no consistent swing. Some balls swung, and some didn't. So, we quickly adjusted angles, and I came around the wicket. But yes, with the new ball, there was some assistance, and we focused on that,"" the pacer said.At stumps on the second day, India stood at 81/3, boasting a substantial lead of 308 runs.

NEW DELHI: Amit Mishra , renowned for his spin bowling, surprised everyone with his exceptional batting performance, outclassing both Indian batters and England bowlers. In an innings where prominent players such as MS Dhoni and Gautam Gambhir got out for 3 runs each, Mishra partnered with Sachin Tendulkar to score 84 runs.The English team grew increasingly frustrated due to Mishra's steadfast batting and their missed opportunities to dismiss Tendulkar.The tension on the field was noticeable as English players struggled to capitalize on their chances.The frustration led to a breach of cricket etiquette, with England players walking across the pitch. This behavior prompted the umpires to issue an official warning to England captain Andrew Strauss for his team's repeated violations. Despite the warning, the damage was done.The footmarks on the pitch eventually favoured spinner Graeme Swann, who dismissed Mishra. Swann proceeded to take six wickets, contributing to India's batting collapse, with players like MS Dhoni, Suresh Raina , and Gautam Gambhir scoring in single digits.Mishra's batting performance overshadowed his struggles with the ball. He confidently handled the English attack, achieving his second Test half-century. His 50 off 103 balls displayed his skill against Swann and fast bowlers. In both the innings, Suresh Raina failed to open his account.In the first innings, Mishra, primarily in the team as a spinner, bowled 38 overs without taking a wicket. England declared at 591 for 6, with Mishra conceding 170 runs, making him the most expensive Indian bowler in that innings.However, he compensated with the bat, scoring 44 runs in the first innings and a half-century in the second. Rahul Dravid 's 144 not out in the first innings and Sachin Tendulkar's 94 in second innings was the major highlight of Indian batting.England secured a win against India by an innings and 8 runs.

When I play as a No. 10, I need to stay close to the striker. But against Punjab, I frequently dropped back to collect the ball, leaving the striker alone, making it easier for the opposing team to defend.

""Playing for India has always been a dream. Receiving an India camp call-up at a young age was a reward for my hard work. Unfortunately, I got injured at that time. I was upset then, and it took me some time to recover,"" he revealed.Vibin admits that there is a gulf in class between players like him and those who play in European leagues. ""I attended a proper football camp only when I was eleven. However, players in Europe start at the age of seven or eight.

Winning has become an addiction at Man City: Shaun Wright-Phillips,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/winning-has-become-an-addiction-at-man-city-shaun-wright-phillips/articleshow/113531544.cms,"Man City during your time and the Man City of today. Tell us about the turnaround.

How was the atmosphere in the blue side of Manchester when you were playing, and the club wasn't winning enough?

And now?

Can

Pep Guardiola

be the new Ferguson?

Currently, the fight for the European supremacy is between Man City and

Real Madrid

. Why do Real win more trophies?

Man City captain Rodri has spoken strongly about the congested schedule. Do you share his concerns?

How has Ian Wright shaped you as a person and a player?

Shaun Wright-Phillips has a favourite adage for life: If you fall from the bike, you get up and ride again. Honest in observations, chipping in with wisecracks, the former winger took time out from his Manchester City Trophy tour to talk to TOI. Excerpts...It happened gradually.Man City, in my first spell was a sleeping giant. It just didn't have the same backing as the other top clubs. When I rejoined in 2008, the take-over had happened. The new owner and his team have done a magnificent job. I think the biggest point is they didn't just win that first trophy and kind of sit back. It became an addiction.Quite like a roller-coaster ride. Sometimes we'd blow teams out and other times we'd play well and lose. But to beat Alex Ferguson's Man United was difficult. United had that power. When you have the likes of Paul Scholes, David Beckham, Andy Cole, Roy Keane, Wayne Rooney, Michael Owen, you generate formidable power. We couldn't financially get there.Now we're at par. But now United spend more money than us and it's just not working. We're here to stay. To win four Premier Leagues in a row, it is a summit that no one has ever scaled. In so many ways, United have kind of lost their way. I think if you look at Old Trafford, that was a place everybody was scared to go to. Now, not so much. And then things like the leaky roof, that's not Old Trafford. It was called a theatre of dreams for a reason. They need to get back there, but it isn't a quick fix.No, I don't think he can. I think Alex Ferguson was a phenomenal manager and a lovely human being, and made football seem completely different during his time. He made that team. He didn't start well but look where he ended up. Then Arsene Wenger comes and changes football completely again, with counter-attacking fast breaks. I remember playing at Highbury and it would take Arsenal three passes to put the ball in the back of the net. And now you've got Pep, who is completely different in his own right. He has influenced football, not just the Premier League , down to the grassroots. Now everybody wants to play out from the back. You go and watch Sunday league football. Goalkeepers are engaging in passes that didn't exist before. They've all changed and brought something unbelievable to the world of football.Real Madrid, for me, isn't the Real that I've seen, say, last seven or eight years ago. (Now) It's a completely different way of playing. Carlo Ancelotti knows how to win football matches. And if you watch them against us in the Champions League last year, Real had individual moments of brilliance. They just keep the ball away from their goal and score when they have a chance. That's how they play – they can be free in the blink of an eye. That is Real Madrid for you. And that's why they win trophies. They don't need to play well to win. They just need a split second of magic, and they have magic all over the pitch.It's hard on them. Not just physically, mentally as well. I think people forget that. There is no respite. And you want top players like Rodri and Kevin De Bruyne to play as long as possible. You don't want to lose players. I think this punishing schedule can shorten that. It will take its toll. In football you get wear and tear. So, when people like Kevin and Rodri talk about it, they're not saying it for no reason. They're saying it because they're feeling it. I can agree with a lot of what the players are saying.The special thing about our relationship is that Ian, my father, didn't try to shape me. He let me create my own path and play the way I wanted to play. He was a completely different player. He was a natural out and out goal scorer. There weren't many players like him. His tenacity, his edge, his sharpness, his pace, we don't have those anymore. I could never match that. I was more of a creator and an entertainer. Yes, I scored, and yes, I wish I scored more, and I wish I played in one of Pep's teams. But he didn't play football with me, just as I've never played football with my kids. He let me fall in love with the game myself, and that's when the passion grew for me. He allowed me to be me. And that is what I'm most thankful of. I couldn't be more proud of him for trusting me to take the right path.",Shaun Wright-Phillips has spoken to TOI about his time at Manchester City. The former winger believes the fight for European supremacy is between Man City and Real Madrid. He also reveals how Ian Wright shaped him as a person and a player.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113531628,imgsize-23470,width-400,resizemode-4/113531628.jpg"

Messi’s consistency over two decades in Europe has established him as one of the greatest players ever to grace the competition.Robert Lewandowski, a deadly striker from Poland, is third in the list, with goals for Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich, and Barcelona. Known for his clinical finishing, positional awareness, and lethal goal-scoring instincts, Lewandowski was instrumental in Bayern Munich’s 2020 Champions League victory.Karim Benzema, with 90 goals in the Champions League , has been one of the key players in Real Madrid's European dominance. The French striker’s longevity, intelligence, and ability to perform in crucial moments led Real Madrid to five Champions League titles, including the 2022 edition where he finished as the top scorer. Benzema is admired for his playmaking ability, leadership, and knack for scoring decisive goals, earning his place as one of the most influential forwards in Champions League history.Real Madrid legend Raul Gonzalez was once the all-time leading scorer in the UEFA Champions League, ending his career with 71 goals. Known for his consistency and lethal finishing, Raul played a crucial role in Real Madrid’s Champions League successes during the late 1990s and early 2000s, winning three titles.

Leverkusen's impressive performance came just months after their sole defeat in an otherwise remarkable season, which saw them clinch the Bundesliga title and the German Cup.Atalanta, the team responsible for Leverkusen's Europa League final defeat in May, was held to a goalless draw by Arsenal at home, with a penalty being saved during the match.In other fixtures, Atletico Madrid secured a 2-1 win against Leipzig, while Benfica emerged victorious over Red Star Belgrade with the same scoreline. Brest, making their European competition debut, celebrated a 2-1 triumph over Sturm Graz.These matches were part of the third evening of the revamped Champions League format, which has replaced the traditional group stage.The Champions League has undergone a change in format, with 36 teams now competing against eight different opponents until January. The teams are ranked in a single league table, which determines their progression to the knockout stage.Despite his young age, Lamal has already achieved numerous scoring records for both Barcelona and Spain. He played a crucial role in Spain's victory at the European Championship this summer, becoming the youngest goalscorer in the tournament's history.However, Lamal's goal in the Champions League was not a record-breaking achievement for him. At 17 years old, he became the second-youngest scorer in the competition, narrowly missing out on the record held by his teammate Ansu Fati, who was 28 days younger when he scored his first Champions League goal in December 2019.Lamal's impressive 28th-minute equalizer showcased his skill and precision. After cutting inside from the left, he expertly placed the ball between two defenders, finding the bottom right corner of the net. His goal canceled out Maghnes Akliouche's earlier opener for the opposing team.Barcelona faced a challenging match after Eric Garcia, their defender, was sent off within the first 11 minutes of the game. Monaco capitalized on this advantage when George Ilenikhena, an 18-year-old forward, scored an impressive goal in the 71st minute.The 21-year-old Writz maintained his goal-scoring streak on Thursday in Rotterdam. After Robert Andrich intercepted a misplaced Feyenoord pass, he played the ball through to Wirtz, who charged forward and struck the ball into the bottom right corner of the net.Leverkusen increased their lead to two goals at the half-hour mark. Victor Boniface made an intelligent pass from the edge of the penalty area to Jeremie Frimpong on the right wing. Frimpong then delivered a cross that Alejandro Grimaldo slotted in at the far post.Six minutes later, Wirtz volleyed in another cross from Frimpong to further extend Leverkusen's lead.Leverkusen hardly needed any help but it was given it on the stroke of halftime when a howler by Feyenoord’s German goalkeeper Timon Wellenreuther saw him turn the ball over the line following Edmond Tapsoba’s header.Antoine Griezmann, a seasoned player at 33 years old, stood out for Atletico despite the emphasis on youth. He scored in the Champions League for the 11th consecutive season and provided the assist for Jose Maria Gimenez's dramatic headed winner. Leipzig had initially taken the lead through Benjamin Šeško in the fourth minute.Arsenal's goalkeeper, David Raya, proved to be their savior by making a double save from a penalty in the 51st minute, which was awarded after Thomas Partey fouled Ederson. Raya first denied Mateo Retegui's spot kick, but the rebound fell back to the striker. However, Raya managed to claw Retegui's header off the line in a scrambling effort.Without the injured Martin Odegaard, their primary creative player, Arsenal found it challenging to create chances in attack. They relied on their characteristically resolute defense and Raya's heroics to secure a point in Bergamo. In the upcoming round, Arsenal will face Paris Saint-Germain at home.Brest's inaugural goal in European competition was netted by midfielder Hugo Magnetti at home, but not at their usual stadium.Due to Brest's stadium failing to meet UEFA's standards, the club's European home matches were played at Guingamp's Stade de Roudourou, situated approximately 114 kilometers (71 miles) away.Brest achieved an impressive third-place finish in the French league last season. Sturm is making its first appearance in the Champions League proper in 24 years, following their successful campaign to end Salzburg's decade-long dominance of the Austrian league.Under the guidance of new coach Bruno Lage, Benfica secured their second consecutive victory, courtesy of goals from Turkish internationals Kerem Aktürkoğlu and Orkun Kokcu.Kokcu's goal was particularly impressive, as he skillfully curled a free kick into the top right corner from a distance of 25 yards. Felicio Milson managed to score a late goal for the home side.","Bayer Leverkusen defeated Feyenoord 4-0 in their Champions League match. Atalanta were held to a goalless draw by Arsenal.

Wing-back Saviour Gama, who made his ISL debut in the last game, is also doubtful with the knock which made him go out in the 16th minute of the first match.Odisha, meanwhile, are winless in their last five ISL away games, and have lost their last three matches. They would surely aim to break that winless run on Friday evening by improving their performance on field.""We need to learn and improve, starting with myself as the coach. We need to analyse many things, but the players need to put their focus on the next game. We need to improve a lot of things if we want to be competitive and secure top positions in the ISL,"" Lobera said ahead of the encounter.Punjab, meanwhile, will find it difficult to quickly come to terms with the absence of their inspirational captain-forward Luka Majcen, who is set to miss the action for at least 6-8 weeks with fractured jaw.Admitting that their gameplan without Majcen in the setup will be crucial in shaping up their season, PFC head coach Panagiotis Dilmperis said on the eve of the match, ""We hope that Luka recovers quickly and joins the team. He is a fighter and would have been with the team even in this situation if it was possible.""However, the Dilmperis-coached side will hope to register their second win on the trot after beating Kerala Blasters in their away opener. And if Punjab managed to do so it would be their first against Odisha. Punjab lost both the league matches to the Juggernauts last season.Hugo Boumous showed his brilliance as the creative midfielder in his debut for Odisha in the last game and Lobera will need him to live up to the billing alongside experienced senior-pros like Roy Krishna, Diego Mauricio, Mourtada Fall and Ahmed Jahouh to deliver the goods in combination with the Indian youngsters in the Juggernauts' setup.",Odisha FC take on Punjab FC at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in New Delhi.

If you win, you will get this much as a bonus, and if the team wins this much extra.""The committee then decided to authorize the captain to discuss it with the player.""Rajpal refused to comment on the matter but another member of the executive committee who attended the meeting confirmed, without revealing details, that Nagal's request was agreed to.An AITA source familiar with the subject said, ""It ($50,000) is roughly Rs. 40-45 lakh for two ties in a year. So essentially, he has asked for Rs. 20 lakh per tie, which I think is fine. A (No. 1) player gets anywhere around Rs. 7 to 12 lakhs at the moment.""As a standalone figure it might seem exorbitant, but to put it in perspective, a player earned $100,000 simply for turning up in the singles first round at the US Open this year. At the French Open, a first-round appearance made a player richer by 73,000-euros.It is also understood that Nagal had requested for a change in support staff attached to the Indian Davis Cup team. It is not clear whether he wanted both Rajpal (as captain by Mahesh Bhupathi) and Zeeshan Ali (as coach by Somdev Devvarman ) to be replaced, or only the latter. Devvarman is Nagal's mentor.The AITA subsequently appointed Ashutosh Singh as coach after Ali resigned.Nagal issued a detailed statement on the subject while also responding to the attack from the AITA that he skipped the Stockholm sojourn despite being fit.""It was a difficult decision to withdraw from the Davis Cup, as playing for the national team is a moment I cherish deeply. However, after consulting with my medical team, it became clear that competing while carrying an injury could not only jeopardize my health but also adversely impact the team’s chances,"" said Nagal, who on Thursday pulled out of the ATP 250 event in Hangzhou.""In professional sports, injury management is a complex science. Sometimes, just a few days of rest and targeted rehabilitation can make the difference between aggravating an injury and being fit to play again.""Regarding compensation, I want to clarify that it is standard practice in professional sports for athletes to be compensated for their participation in events, even when representing their country.""This is not about personal gain.

NEW DELHI: Jannik Sinner , the Italian tennis sensation, has achieved a remarkable feat by winning his second Grand Slam title of the year at the US Open. The 23-year-old world number one defeated American Taylor Fritz in straight sets, with a score line of 6-3, 6-4, 7-5, to secure his maiden US Open crown.This victory comes on the heels of his triumph at the Australian Open earlier this year, making him the first Italian man to win the prestigious US Open title.Jannik Sinner has secured his sixth title of the 2024 season, reaffirming his status as the world number one. Sinner's stellar record this year includes 55 wins and just 5 losses.However, his journey to winning the US Open was not without issues. Before the tournament, an independent tribunal cleared him of any wrongdoing related to a case that had drawn significant public and player attention.Allegations suggested that tennis' anti-doping authorities treated Sinner differently from other players, leading to a divided locker room atmosphere.In March, Jannik Sinner tested positive for Clostebol, a banned substance, twice. However, it was determined that the presence of the steroid was accidental, caused by a massage from his former physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi.Naldi had unknowingly transferred Clostebol to Sinner while treating his own finger with a spray containing the substance, provided by Sinner’s ex-fitness trainer, Umberto Ferrara.

"Grievances, yes, you still play for the country: Nandan Bal tells players",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/grievances-yes-you-still-play-for-the-country-nandan-bal-tells-players/articleshow/113411831.cms,"PUNE: Nandan Bal , the chairman of the national tennis selection committee , has lamented players making themselves unavailable for national duty due to their disenchantment with the national federation.A depleted Indian team suffered a humbling 0-4 rout to Sweden in Stockholm over the weekend, and it came after top singles players Sumit Nagal and Mukund Sasikumar as well as leading doubles player Yuki Bhambri were not available for selection for different reasons.While Nagal cited a back strain he had picked up during the US Open, Mukund was apparently banned for two ties - which even the player was not aware of - whereas Bhambri's reasons were not known.Nonetheless, it is understood that the trio as well as a few other players are upset with the national association's ( AITA ) way of functioning, the key aspect being a lack of professionalism in the team set up.For instance, the team doesn't have a designated professional manager and instead a state association official or an AITA office-bearer travels with the squad. AITA secretary Anil Dhupar accompanied the team to Sweden, in the latest instance.Bal admitted the players' grievances were genuine but still believed that those factors should not come in the way of representing the country.""I don't agree when a player says that, because the team atmosphere is not good or they are not happy with the association, that he will not play,"" Bal said.""When I play, I play for my country, I am not playing for AITA. Maybe I am from a different generation or think differently, but even after all those arguments, I will still play for my country.""Bal also did not agree that the players didn't find it worth taking a break from their professional careers, only to find that professionalism of the personnel attached to the team were not upto the standard expected at the top level.""I was part of the squad picked for the 1982 Asian Games (in Delhi). We were called for six two-week camps that year. That's 12 weeks, and here we are talking about 12 days a year,"" he said.""We were also making a living out of playing tennis. As a result, one can check the records, my ranking was somewhere around (a career-high 309) at the start of the year (1981), and then it dropped (to 503 at the end of 1983).""And the next year, I still played for my country.""Against Sweden, both the team selection and match tactics have come under scrutiny.After Nagal withdrew, the selection committee opted to bring in 16-year-old Manas Dhamne - ahead of 21-year-old Karan Singh, who was also ranked higher - as reserve while 18-year-old Aryan Shah, previously the reserve, became part of the nominations.Eventually, Rajpal played doubles specialists Ramkumar Ramanathan (who has not won a singles match on the ATP circuit since May), Sriram Balaji in both singles and doubles.Bal said the committee chose to give Dhamne the exposure once it became clear that the captain was ""reasonably certain"" to play Ramkumar and Balaji, and to some extent Niki Poonacha.""As much as I agree (with fielding Aryan in singles with an eye on future), he is also ranked higher, as a captain you would go with a player who has the experience of 30-40 ties, how the surface is playing, all that would have made an impact (on Rajpal's decision),"" he said.""He has played a lot of tennis. He has travelled a lot, he knows his tennis.""Ram and Balaji knew what the battle was, what they were getting into. They were dignified and fought it out.""Asked to sum up his thoughts on India's performance in Stockholm, Bal said, ""Disappointing.""""When you are playing with a half deck, the way we crumbled, says it all. Even with Sumit, Sasi and Yuki in the mix, Sweden would have been tough to beat at home anyway,"" he added.""Don't know if we can blame the players, or the captain or the coach, when we have two doubles players playing singles, it had to happen.""Doubles could have been closer, but when you are 0-2 down it is not easy to fight back. You need extra-ordinary players who can say, 'let's take it one match at a time'.""We did it against Brazil (in Chennai in 2010) when we had the class of Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi .""",Top singles players Sumit Nagal and Mukund Sasikumar as well as leading doubles player Yuki Bhambri were not available for selection for different reasons.
