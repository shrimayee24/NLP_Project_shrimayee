PCB

deeply upset at BCCI's fresh demands

Poll Do You Support India’s Decision to Exclude Pakistan’s Name From Jerseys? No, Sports Should Be Free of Political Considerations Yes, The Team Should Represent National Pride

MUMBAI: A fresh controversy has erupted over Champions Trophy to be held in Pakistan and UAE in February-March.TOI has learnt BCCI doesn't want its players to wear jerseys with the name of Pakistan, the host nation, displayed on it.BCCI is also firm that skipper Rohit Sharma won't travel to Pakistan for the captains' press conference and photo shoot.According to a BCCI source, the board has requested ICC to shift the twin events, which take place just before the tournament takes off on Feb 19, from Pakistan to Dubai.""ICC has already accommodated India's request to not schedule its CT matches in Pakistan, so these are minor issues,"" the source told TOI on Tuesday.The decision by BCCI has left the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) peeved and it is hoping for ICC's intervention in the matter.""The BCCI is bringing politics into cricket, which is not at all good for the game. They refused to travel to Pakistan. They don't want to send their captain (to Pakistan) for the opening ceremony. Now there are reports that they don't want the host nation's (Pakistan) name printed on their jerseys. We believe that the world governing body (ICC) will not let this happen and support Pakistan,"" a PCB official told IANS on condition of anonymity.As per the rules, India not wearing the official logo of the hosts, in this case Pakistan, will be a breach of ICC's official clothing code.According to the tradition of ICC tournaments, it is customary for the participating teams to feature the host nation's name on their jersey even if the tournament is being held elsewhere.For example, Pakistan's jersey during the 2021 T20 World Cup featured India's name on it despite the tournament taking place in the UAE.Also, when Pakistan participated in the 2016 T20 World Cup and 2023 ODI World Cup in India, they had the host nation's name on their jerseys.BCCI's decision will add to the ongoing tension between BCCI and PCB. The former has already refused to travel to Pakistan and India will play their fixtures in the UAE.The eight-team tournament will commence on Feb 19 and will conclude on March 9. The 15 matches in the competition will be hosted across four venues - Dubai, Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi.","Champions Trophy to be held in Pakistan and UAE in February-March.

Jeff McNeil shared his take on Pete Alonso's unsigned offseason

“A little bit surprised he's still out there. He's my really good buddy on the team. I wish him all the best. He's my good buddy. He's a great player and any team would be lucky to have him.""

""[I] haven't spoken to him at all. Talked to him a little bit at the beginning of the offseason, but haven't really gotten to speak to him [during free agency]. Kind of let him have his space. I know it's a tough decision for him. He's earned the right to test free agency and max out his value. So I hope he's able to do that.""

Also Read:

""I'm pretty sure he's up there in the picking stats. He's good at digging balls out. I believe I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure he rates pretty solid as a first baseman. He's still a pretty good athlete, but I do think the modern-day first baseman is more athletic in general than before.""

""I'm not exactly sure what his numbers were last year, I think they were down a little bit from kind of his best years. But my guess would be he's holding out for more years or more money than some of these teams are willing to go to for whatever reason,""

Talking about how Alonso has been maximizing his market value, McNeil said:Even though Pete Alonso had multiple meetings with various clubs over the offseason, including the New York Mets, nothing fruitful came out of the meetings.

One of the questions that Hailee asked Josh was about the “last fun thing that he did” and his heartwarming answer had fans raving for days.Out of all the proposal related questions that Hailee asked her fiance, Josh, one of the questions was, “What was the last fun thing that you did?” To this, the NFL star, Josh spoke about his proposal. He said, “Got on a knee for my girlfriend who is now my fiancee”. Josh’s answer was quite unexpected since Hailee did not ask him anything directly about their proposal.A fan commented about Josh’s answer and wrote, “This is so sweet!!” while another fan commented on the love and respect they have for each other and wrote, “In the words of Phoebe from Friends "" you found your lobster"".❤️”Beau Society is a project of Hailee’s that is pretty close to her heart which she started back in August 2024.

But after Josh proposed to her in November last year, it seems like the couple has gotten comfortable with making their relationship public.Recently, as Josh’s team, the Buffalo Bills defeated the Denver Broncos, Hailee Steinfeld was spotted cheering him on as she wore a customised Buffalo Bills outfit. She is also expected to attend the AFC Championship this weekend.Hailee has also been spotted in and around Buffalo quite a lot and it might just be that she has moved to Buffalo at least temporarily.

“It’s going to be a heavyweight battle,” over-tells defensive tackle for the Kansas City Chiefs George Karlaftis

George Karlaftis on Chiefs’ “Heavyweight Battle” vs Bills in the AFC Title Game |The Rich Eisen Show

George talks about Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen

Chiefs head coach Andy Reid says 'it's an honor' to make it to postseason

“They demand your best every single day,” DE George talks about Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid

Andy Reid’s army, the Kansas City Chiefs , reached the AFC Championship game of the NFL playoffs following praiseworthy 21 wins. Just one match they lost in the last 22 games. And they lost it to the Buffalo Bills .This Sunday, 26th January 2025, the Chiefs are buckling up to take revenge for that one despicable loss. Amidst their stringent practice at the hands of Big Red, DE George Karlaftis found some time alone.George was on 'The Rich Eisen Show’, where he did what he should not have. Let’s uncover that.Rich Eisen inquired,“The Bills are the only team that’s beaten you this year in a game that (Patrick) Mahomes has started. How much does that stick in your craw going into this AFC Championship game?”George spills the beans and says,“They know us, and we know them. We’ve played them twice every year since I've been in the league. It’s going to be a heavyweight battle. We have a lot of respect for those guys, what Josh Allen , their running back, their receivers, and their o-line can do—they’re great. There’s a reason why they’re in the AFC Championship, so. We're gonna have to be on our A game because this is a dangerous squad.”Rich Eisen tickled the ‘Josh Allen’ question,“What is the challenge in trying to rush Josh Allen?”George expressed and innocently disclosed the Chiefs’ game plan against the Buffalo Bills. He said,“With Josh Allen, he’s got a great o-line. He’s a great athlete; he’s built like a tight end or a defensive end. He’s 6’5’’ and 250 pounds; he can really move. We got a lot of respect for such guys.You wanna do your best containing him, affecting him in any way you can. Each quarterback has their tendencies, what they like to do, so it’s on us to figure out those tendencies and do our best to try and stop them.”Eisen queried,“How has the coaching staff brought the best version of you out?”George explained,“Not just in me, but everybody. Just demanding our best every single day. Starting from coach Andy Reid to Joe Cullen, they demand your best every single day.”Eisen probed, “How do they do that?”George diplomatically handled the trick question and replied,“It’s a great interculture here. You kinda know what’s expected. There’s been a lot of continuity in the personnel staff here. We’ve trusted their coaching, and we know what they’re telling us is going to help us be successful as individuals and as a team. It’s a relationship out of trust and love with everybody.”Also Read : Travis Kelce breaks down Chiefs' dream seventh consecutive AFC Championship: ‘I know how to attack’","The Kansas City Chiefs reached the AFC Championship game of the NFL playoffs following praiseworthy 21 wins.

Stephen Curry

CELTICS at WARRIORS | FULL GAME HIGHLIGHTS | January 20, 2025

When and where to watch the Golden State Warriors vs Sacramento Kings game tonight (January 22, 2025)?

is expected to participate in his team’s upcoming game against the Sacramento Kings. This has been a weird season for Curry, as he has only been able to play in 34 of the Warriors’ 42 games. The 36-year-old has been dealing with knee issues that have forced him to rest at least one game of back-to-back fixtures. However, Steph has been going strong and is averaging 22.9 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 6.1 assists per game.Stephen Curry is also shooting 44.8 from the field and 40.9% from beyond the arc. The Warriors lost their last matchup against the Kings in a bad way. Sacramento was missing their best player, De’Aaron Fox but still managed to blowout the Dubs by 30 points. Since then the Dubs have only managed to win three of seven games. This inconsistency is a big reason behind the Warriors’ poor performance this season.The Dubs started their season with a record of 12-3 and have since been 9-18. They have lost their championship identity and struggle to compete with most teams if they can’t keep up till halftime. Stephen Curry has even voiced his frustrations with the team’s lack of competitiveness and hopes to instill more confidence in them. Curry himself has taken a step forward and his averaging 23.6 points, 6.2 assists and 5.0 rebounds over his last five games. However, with the way they’re set up, we doubt that the Warriors will be able to do much damage this season.Curry will be available against the Kings but head coach Steve Kerr will still have his hands full. Kerr will have to adjust for the absences of Brandin Podziemski, Draymond Green, Jonathan Kuminga, and Kyle Anderson who will all be missing for tonight’s game.It’ll be interesting to see what kind of game plan Steve Kerr has in mind with so many key players out with injury. It is also worth noting that while the Warriors are reeling with injuries, the Kings will come into this game with no players on their injury report.ALSO READ: Golden State Warriors vs Sacramento Kings (01/22): Starting five, injury report, start time, game prediction, betting tips, how to watch, and more The Golden State Warriors will visit the Golden 1 Center to take on the Sacramento Kings at 10:00 PM ET.

Kayla Nicole sends bold message to Eagles

Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs are readying for another AFC Championship after a win over the Houston Texans. Kelce's ex-girlfriend, Kayla Nicole, recently commented on a postseason team, not Kelce or the Chiefs. Instead, Nicole issued a warning to Jalen Hurts-led Eagles about the challenge that awaits them in the next week against Jayden Daniels-led Commanders.NFL playoffs mean everything to Travis Kelce's ex-girlfriend, Kayla Nicole, but there is nothing on the Kansas City Chiefs as much as the words on the Philadelphia Eagles after that divisional round win. Here, the Eagles are going head-to-head against the Washington Commanders with a rookie star named Jayden Daniels.Even though Philadelphia won 28-22, the Commanders looked disjointed on the field, threatening to be a major upset to Super Bowl hopefuls. Eagles are likely to take advantage of any weaknesses that the game might have.Nicole warned the Eagles on her Twitter about the challenge of their NFC championship game against Daniels-led Commanders. ""Eagles fans. Happy for you, real cute. But that’s not gone cut it next weekend. I’m telling you right now,"" she wrote.The Eagles relied heavily on Saquon Barkley for their offense, while Jalen Hurts' performance was limited, with a 126-yard completion average. The Los Angeles Rams also criticized Barkley's performance as they rushed for 205 yards and two touchdowns compared to his franchise record of 302 yards.Saquon Barkley's pressure might increase in the NFC Championship game because of concerns over Hurts' availability. Fans are already angry with his performance, and if he gets enrolled on injury reserve, things may get worse. The Pro Bowl signal-caller was cautious in responding to media post-game.Jalen Hurts, recovering from a head concussion in Week 17, suffered a knee injury in the third quarter of a divisional match against the Rams, limping and then being seen limping while walking to the locker room.Also Read: Jalen Hurts may miss the Eagles' NFC Championship game against the Commanders after being sacked seven times leaving him with knee problems The Philadelphia Eagles meet the Washington Commanders at Lincoln Financial Field on January 26 and advance to the Super Bowl if they win, as a result of the AFC Championship: the Buffalo Bills vs. Kansas City Chiefs.

Tony Romo blasted the refs during the CBS broadcast

In CBS broadcasting, former Dallas Cowboys player Tony Romo raised a query about an official's call, which occurred within the first quarter of the playoff game between Buffalo Bills and the Baltimore Ravens for the Divisional Round. On the teams' opening drive, both sides scored touchdowns as Buffalo's attacking drive was put to a screeching halt by a questionable holding call against left tackle Dion Dawkins; the replay ruled him not to have been holding. He made sure the criticism aired on the CBS broadcast,The Buffalo Bills played against the Baltimore Ravens in an AFC playoff match headlined by two of the NFL MVP favorites this season-Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen. Although the Bills were ahead on touchdowns after the first quarter, their drive ended abruptly when it was reduced to a junk situation due to a poor holding call that Tony Romo blasted during the CBS broadcast.The Bills left tackle Dion Dawkins was the lineman who drew the flag but the replay showed he didn't do anything wrong. ""Oh that is not a hold at all, Jim,"" Romo said. ""He just swipes his hands down, a little trap technique which is like when you try to put your hands on him you swipe it down. That’s a terrible call.”Fans agreed with Romo on social media but also shared their beliefs that the refs were purposely favoring the Ravens. ""So blatant. Refs are so cheating,"" one wrote. ""Clearly the NFL wants the Ravens to win. Refs not even hiding their favoritism,"" another commented. ""Refs are cheating for them early,"" a third added.The first half of the game was a reprise of Week 4, when two Lamar Jackson turnovers gave the Baltimore a third-quarter deficit of 21-10 after 30 minutes of football in Buffalo. The Bills limited the Ravens to 73 yards rushing and 28 offensive plays. Lamar Jackson was 6-10 passing for 123 yards, one touchdown, one interception, and a 97.1 rating.Jackson also had five carries for 31 yards, but his two turnovers played big. The MVP favourite in some expert's eyes, Josh Allen was 5-7 passing for 69 yards in the first half. Allen had 15 yards rushing in the first half. Baltimore had 182 yards in the first half compared to Buffalo's 156. The Ravens were 4-5 on third downs.Also Read: “Worst owner/joke of the NFL”: Fans brutally trolls Jerry Jones after the Cowboys' loss to the Commanders The Buffalo Bills punted the ball a few plays later, making each possession in this game very important, and a bad call may well determine the outcome of the game.","Tony Romo blasted the refs during the CBS broadcast of the Buffalo Bills- Baltimore Ravens playoff game.

Spytek’s Impressive NFL Resume



The Brady Connection



A New Era for the Raiders



What’s Next?



The winds of change are blowing through Las Vegas, and the Raiders are embracing them with gusto. In a bold move, the team is expected to appoint John Spytek , the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' assistant GM, as their new general manager. This decision comes on the heels of the Raiders parting ways with Tom Telesco, who served as GM for just one season.John Spytek isn’t just a new face for the Raiders; he’s a seasoned pro with nearly two decades of NFL experience under his belt. His career kicked off in 2004 as an operations intern with the Detroit Lions. From there, he climbed the ranks, working with the Eagles, Browns, Broncos, and Buccaneers. Along the way, he helped assemble championship-winning rosters, including Denver’s 2015 Super Bowl-winning team.Most recently, Spytek served as the right-hand man to Tampa Bay GM Jason Licht. Together, they constructed a team that brought home a Super Bowl victory in 2020, Tom Brady ’s first season with the Buccaneers.Speaking of Brady, the GOAT shares a unique bond with Spytek. They met in the University of Michigan, where Spytek was a freshman linebacker, and Brady was a senior quarterback. Again, their professional careers overlapped as they found themselves in Tampa Bay, resulting in their shared Super Bowl win.Now, as a minority owner of the Raiders, Brady's influence is seen in the recent moves made by the organization, including the selection of Spytek as GM.Spytek’s appointment is just the first piece of the puzzle. The Raiders are also in the market for a new head coach, following the departure of Antonio Pierce. Rumors are swirling about potential candidates, with names like Pete Carroll and Steve Spagnuolo reportedly in the mix.This isn’t just a leadership change; it’s a full-on reboot for the franchise. Spytek’s task is clear: rebuild the Raiders and return them to glory. With his proven track record and deep NFL roots, he seems poised to take on the challenge.For the Raiders, the focus now shifts to crafting a winning strategy for the future. With Spytek at the helm and a new coach on the horizon, the team’s fans have reason to believe that brighter days are ahead. One thing’s for sure: all eyes will be on Las Vegas as this new chapter unfolds.Also read - FanDuel x Spotify’s Secret Super Bowl Party (Invite-only): Blink-182, Megan Thee Stallion & Anderson .Paak to Perform","John Spytek, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' assistant GM, is expected to be appointed as the Raiders' new general manager.

NEW DELHI: The highly anticipated India vs England series kicks off at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on Wednesday, January 22, marking the beginning of a five-match T20I contest between two evenly matched sides. This white-ball series, which also includes three ODIs, serves as a crucial preparatory ground for both teams ahead of next month’s Champions Trophy.For India, the spotlight will be on the fit-again Mohammed Shami, who returns to the squad after recovering from an ankle injury that sidelined him following the ODI World Cup final loss to Australia in November 2023. His comeback, particularly in the absence of pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, who is nursing a back injury, holds significant importance for India’s bowling attack.India’s T20 squad, led by Suryakumar Yadav, features several players under scrutiny. Axar Patel steps into the role of vice-captain, rewarded for his impressive performances during India’s T20 World Cup triumph in the Caribbean last year. Sanju Samson, omitted from India’s Champions Trophy squad, will look to make a strong case for himself, especially after his record-breaking T20I performances against South Africa. Meanwhile, promising all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy, fresh off a maiden Test century in Australia, adds depth to the side.Skipper Suryakumar Yadav, showering plaudits on head coach Gambhir ahead of the firs T20I, said, ""I've had the privilege of spending a lot of time with him. I know how he works. Without saying a word, he can read your mind. His coaching style is very simple. He gives us a lot of freedom and allows players to express themselves. He keeps everything straightforward and understands what's going on in the minds of the players. He ensures a light, relaxed atmosphere in the dressing room, which helps players perform at their best. We're definitely moving in the right direction.""England, under the leadership of Jos Buttler and head coach Brendon McCullum, also aims to rebound after a disappointing T20 World Cup campaign.The series comes at a critical juncture for both teams. India are seeking redemption after a horror Test series in Australia, while England are embarking on a new era under McCullum’s guidance. With dew expected to play a significant role in Indian conditions, the bowlers will face a stern test in what promises to be a high-scoring series.","India vs England T20I series kicks off at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on January 22. The five-match series also includes three ODIs. ODI leg will begin in Nagpur on February 6, followed by games in Cuttack on February 9 and Ahmedabad on February 12.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117425078,imgsize-19660,width-400,resizemode-4/117425078.jpg"
Did Patrick Mahomes just admit to flopping? Chiefs QB breaks silence on NFL favoritism scandal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/did-patrick-mahomes-just-admit-to-flopping-chiefs-qb-breaks-silence-on-nfl-favoritism-scandal/articleshow/117466316.cms,"Did Patrick Mahomes just admit to flopping? Chiefs QB breaks silence on NFL favoritism scandal (Image via Getty)

Controversial calls during the Texans game

“Oh, come on — I mean, he’s a runner. I could not disagree with that one more.”

Mahomes' perspective on the favoritism narrative

“I‘ve kind of learned that no matter what happens during the game, that something’s going to come out about it if you win and you continue to win, so I don’t really pay attention to it.”

“At the end of the day, man, those guys are doing their best to make the best calls.”

“I would say that the only one I felt like I probably did too much was the one on the sideline… I probably shouldn’t have done that.”

Texans players voice frustrations

“We knew it was going to be us versus the refs going into this game,”

Patrick Mahomes isn’t shying away from the allegations of favoritism. The Kansas City Chiefs ’ quarterback addressed claims that his team has benefited from lenient officiating, particularly during their divisional-round win against the Texans.The Chiefs’ 23-14 win over the Texans raised eyebrows after two critical penalties led to ten points for Kansas City. One of the most talked-about moments was Will Anderson Jr. 's hit on Mahomes that nullified a third-down incompletion. Anderson made slight contact with Mahomes’ helmet after the ball was released, resulting in a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty. NFL Senior VP of Officiating Walt Anderson later explained, “if any contact is made with the head, referees are ‘probably’ going to throw a flag.”Another questionable call came during a critical fourth-quarter moment. The Texans appeared to sack Mahomes at his 30-yard line, but the referees flagged Houston for unnecessary roughness. The penalty erased the sack, and the Chiefs capitalized with a Travis Kelce touchdown , extending their lead. On the broadcast, Troy Aikman criticized the call, saying,ESPN’s Russell York agreed, saying it should not have been penalized.Mahomes downplayed the controversy, choosing to focus on the broader picture. Speaking to 96.5 The Fan, he said,He acknowledged being on both sides of questionable calls but defended the referees, stating,Regarding the accusations of flopping, Mahomes admitted fault for a sideline play where he exaggerated contact but didn’t draw a flag.Houston players were vocal about their frustration. Defensive end Will Anderson Jr. said,reflecting a sentiment shared by many fans. The Texans believed the officiating directly impacted key moments of the game, but Mahomes countered that the Chiefs’ performance, not the flags, determined the outcome.Despite the ongoing criticism, Mahomes remains focused. Kansas City will host the Bills in the AFC Championship , looking to secure their third consecutive Super Bowl appearance. As a slight favorite against Josh Allen and the Bills, the Chiefs will aim to prove their dominance, controversy or not.Also Read : “We could really use a Taylor Swift bump in the women’s sports space,” shares American Sports Anchor, Elle Duncan","The Kansas City Chiefs beat the Houston Texans 23-14 in the divisional round of the NFL playoffs.

MUMBAI: Going through a lean phase in the autumn of his career, India's Test and ODI captain Rohit Sharma , set to turn out in his first Ranji Trophy match in almost a decade, has received a huge 'thumbs-up"" from his old teammate and friend Ajinkya Rahane Asserting that Rohit doesn't need to be told what to do and he will get a ""big one once he gets in"" the Mumbai Ranji captain said that the Indian skipper is a ""relaxed character"" who won't get hassled due to poor form. All eyes will be on Rohit and his India opening partner Yashasvi Jaiswal when the Ranji defending champions take on Jammu and Kashmir here at the BKC Ground from Thursday.""See, Rohit is Rohit. We all know that. Aapko bhi pata hai Rohit ka character (You also know Rohit's character). I'm really happy to have both of them back in the Mumbai dressing room. I know Rohit. Rohit has always been relaxed. Even playing at the international level, his character is similar. His attitude is pretty much relaxed. He knows his game really well so, no one has to tell him what he needs to do. And Rohit knows his game really well. Once he gets in, I'm sure he will do well. He's always been relaxed, cool guy, on and off the field. He's never changed, which is a very good thing,"" Rahane told the reporters after Mumbai's training session here on Wednesday.Having himself gone through a prolonged form slump in his own long career which saw him dropped from India's Test team, Rahane is exactly aware of what Rohit is experiencing at the moment. The veteran batsman said that every player goes through ups and downs, and revealed that Rohit had a few good sessions in the Mumbai nets in the build-up to the match.""As a player, every player goes through that phase (and) that is part and parcel of any sportsman's career. What is important is (that) he is hungry, he is determined to do well. I am sure, once he gets in, he will get a big one. A player has to be confident and I feel Rohit is really confident. He batted really well yesterday (in) a couple of sessions so it's a part and parcel of a player's career. I am really confident about Rohit,"" Rahane said.When he last turned out for Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy, Rohit cracked 113 while batting at No 4 in a drawn game against Uttar Pradesh. Rahane believes that the 37-year-old's colossal presence in the Mumbai dressing room for this match will inspire the younger players and certainly benefit the team.""It's great to have Rohit back after so many years for Mumbai. Everyone can learn a lot from him. Personally, Rohit and I have played together since age-group cricket and for India, so his inputs over the next four days will be extremely important,"" Rahane said.While Rohit's return has draws attention, Mumbai's strong squad for the crucial fixture also features Yashasvi Jaiswal, who was the highest run-getter for India in the recently-held Border-Gavaskar Trophy (391 runs in five Tests). ""We're delighted to have Yashasvi back as well. He's been performing exceptionally well at the international level. Over the past couple of years, he's consistently delivered for the Indian team and earlier for Mumbai too. His hunger and determination to score runs will inspire the younger players in the dressing room,"" Rahane said.Quizzed if Rohit and Jaiswal would open for Mumbai, Rahane fired back, ""is this even a question?"", while adding that Ranji outing will help the two India players get useful match practice. ""For any cricketer, getting match preparation (and) game-time is really important. Obviously, there is no red-ball (Test) cricket at this moment. But they are going to play white-ball (competitions. BCCI has been saying this since the last one-two years that whoever is available, they should play domestic cricket. I'm really happy to have Rohit and Yashasvi back in the Mumbai dressing room,"" Rahane said.The match is vital for Mumbai considering that they are currently third in Group A with 22 points from five matches, trailing table-toppers Baroda (27 points) and second-placed Jammu and Kashmir (23 points).""They [J&K] are ranked second, but that's the beauty of red-ball cricket. This season has been challenging. After five league games, we shifted to white-ball formats for the Syed Mushtaq Ali and Vijay Hazare Trophies.

Hardik Pandya still key to leadership group: Suryakumar Yadav

NEW DELHI: Defending champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape showcased grit and determination to register a commanding 52-run victory over the Pretoria Capitals in the SA20 on Wednesday night. The win not only marked their third consecutive bonus-point triumph but also cemented their position as serious title contenders.With their impressive form, the Sunrisers remain in third position with 15 points, while the Capitals languish in fifth with nine. The victory reflected Sunrisers’ resilience, having recovered from a perilous 53/5 after an impressive start from Capitals seamers Eathan Bosch (3/33) and new recruit Jason Behrendorff Sunrisers skipper Aiden Markram played a pivotal role, anchoring the innings with a brilliant 68 not out off 55 balls, supported by vital cameos from Liam Dawson (25 off 11) and Marco Jansen (24 off 24), pushing the team to a defendable total of 149/7.Jansen then shone with the ball, delivering a sensational new-ball spell of 4/13, leaving the Capitals' top order in disarray at 28/4. Ably backed by Richard Gleeson (1/22), Jansen's heroics positioned him as a top contender for the SA20 Season 3 Most Valuable Player (MVP) award.Although rookie Keagan Lion-Cachet (22 years old) demonstrated potential with a gritty 28, and Marques Ackerman offered brief resistance, the Capitals struggled to mount a recovery. Liam Dawson (3/17) cleaned up the tail, ensuring the Sunrisers secured another crucial bonus point.Reflecting on the match, Marco Jansen praised his team’s effort, saying, ""I still felt like they had enough batters to pull it off. I felt when they were six down, then I started feeling a bit more comfortable. But even at that stage, they needed eight and a half runs an over, which is definitely doable on this wicket. Yeah, the brothers really did their job today.""Jansen also emphasised the team's mindset after rebounding from a slow start to the season, ""We're trying to keep it level because we lost our first three games. Now winning three games on the bounce, we just try and stay as level as possible because we know any team can beat any team on the day. Just lucky for us, we managed to do that three times as well.""Capitals head coach Jonathan Trott , meanwhile, acknowledged the stellar performance from the opposition and lamented his side’s missed opportunities.""I thought the way that Marco played was good. I thought he read the situation really well—the conditions, what was needed for his side at the time. And I think it would have been nice if our batters had recognized that and played accordingly as well, adjusting the way he did to the surface,"" Trott remarked.","Sunrisers Eastern Cape register commanding 52-run victory over Pretoria Capitals.

RAJKOT: The presence of Rishabh Pant in Delhi's Ranji Trophy side will garner all the attention as the Ayush Badoni-led side takes on two-time winners Saurashtra in a must-win Group D game here from Thursday onwards.Saurashtra too boast some star power of their own in Pant's India teammate Ravindra Jadeja , and the discarded India No. 3 batter Cheteshwar Pujara Delhi and Saurashtra are placed fourth and fifth respectively and have a lot of ground to cover.

With head coach Gautam Gambhir expressing a desire to see India players appear in the Ranji Trophy, Pant and Ravindra Jadeja are among a host of stars - including India's Test and ODI captain Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal - who will again experience the grind of multi-day cricket.The clash between Delhi and Saurashtra at the Niranjan Shah Stadium Ground C will also see former India pacers Jaidev Unadkat and Navdeep Saini.

The bowling duties will be shouldered by Unadkat, Hiten Kanbi, Jadeja and Dharmendrasinh Jadeja.

Their batting has been on and off this season and they will be looking for a complete performance.In the bowling department, Delhi will be banking on Simarjeet Singh, Siddhant Sharma and Saini. Right-arm medium pacer Money Grewal will look to improve on an underwhelming season while it will be interesting to see whether Hrithik Shokeen gets into the playing XI.With both teams needing a result to keep their qualification chances alive, all eyes will be on the Rajkot wicket.

Jimmy Butler had to let go a whopping $3.1 million after his reported 9-game suspension



Jimmy Butler is reportedly facing significant financial repercussions after his suspensions with the Miami Heat totaled nine games this season. According to a new report, the six-time All-Star has forfeited approximately $3.1 million from his contract due to missed games stemming from disciplinary actions. Butler’s absence, combined with the financial impact, raises concerns about his relationship with the franchise. The star forward has already missed key matchups in the season but his rift with the team continues ahead of the trade deadline. Miami Heat has reportedly added two-game suspension for Jimmy Butler following another disciplinary issue. Butler’s insistence to leave the Miami Heat is reportedly coming at a steep financial cost. As per Anthony Chiang of the Miami Herald, Butler’s latest two-game suspension brings his total missed games to nine this season. It will cost him $3.1 million in lost salary.Chiang further shared that, Butler ""could still get some (or even most) of that back depending on the result of grievances filed through the NBPA.""Despite losing $3.1 million in salary, Jimmy Butler is far from facing financial hardship. Playing on a $48.7 million contract this season, the Heat star already boasts career earnings of $312 million. If he opts into his $52.4 million player option for the 2025-26 season, that total will climb to $364.4 million. While the recent losses are significant, they won’t make a dent in Butler’s financial stability. Now, it appears that his bold approach may ultimately help him achieve his goal of forcing a trade, even if it comes at a hefty price.The NBA trade deadline is nearing and Butler’s recent actions indicate that he is all set to move out of the franchise. Fans expect before February 6, Butler will find another team considering his ongoing feud with the Heat. The rift has certainly grabbed several headlines but the tension is far from over as Butler is reportedly set to face two-game suspension after coming out of his infamous seven-game ban.ESPN’s Shams Charania reported that Butler missed the team flight ahead of their matchups with the Milwaukee Bucks and Brooklyn Nets. Although he planned to join the team later, the Heat sent him home. Charania also shared the growing tension in the team surrounding the 35-year-old. “There's an uneasy feeling in the air in Miami right now around Jimmy Butler and just an ugly way that this is really shaping up after five and a half seasons in Miami,” Charania said.Also Read: Jimmy Butler to be hit with another two-game suspension after latest conduct incident Previously, the Heat and Butler had a meeting where he reportedly asserted his stance to leave the franchise.

KOLKATA: The packed Eden Gardens went silent when India skipper Suryakumar Yadav announced the playing XI, with Mohammed Shami 's name conspicuously missing. Although questions were raised about the pacer's match fitness, much to everybody's surprise Shami was seen bowling at full tilt at the adjacent net when the toss was happening.There is no official word about his current fitness status and the reason behind the exclusion. Shami was sidelined after the lost ODI World Cup final against Australia in Nov 2023 due to an ankle injury that required surgery. The recovery from that was followed by a swelling on his left knee during the domestic comeback some weeks back. ""Selection is a good headache, we are sticking to our strengths,"" was all the captain said at the toss. India decided to go with just one specialist pacer in Arshdeep Singh and included three spinners in conditions where dew is expected to make its presence felt.Interestingly, Suryakumar himself expressed happiness at having Shami back in the fold. ""It's always good to have an experienced bowler in your side, and he is making a comeback after over a year. I am really excited to see him. It's great to see him fit and back in the side,"" Suryakumar had said on Tuesday.Shami himself was eager to make his international comeback after playing in all three domestic formats for Bengal - starting with the Ranji Trophy , followed by the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20s and the Vijay Hazare Trophy. He was also happy to start his journey again from Eden Gardens. ""Eden is my home where I have played so much cricket,"" he said.""The hunger to play for the country should never end. If you love it, you will always fight back, no matter how many injuries you face,"" Shami said during an event on Monday evening.The decision can be a tactical one, but the fact remains that the pacer has been kept waiting. So have his fans.'Had sense of fear during rehab, but crossed that phase'Meanwhile, Shami told bcci.tv he was gripped by a sense of fear when he began his rehabilitation after a long injury layoff, but managed to overcome that phase by training his mind.""I waited for an entire year and I worked very hard (to get back to full fitness). There was a sense of fear (of getting injured during rehabilitation) even while running,"" Shami said in a video posted by the board.""It is difficult for any player to get injured after being in full flow, go to the National Cricket Academy for rehabilitation and then make a comeback.

Earlier, the Indian spinners bowled out the rivals for 132 runs in 20 overs. Axar Patel, Ravi Bishnoi and Varun Chakravarthy bowled in tandem to run through a power-packed English batting lineup after Surya won the toss and decided to field first.India's only specialised pacer in the side, Arshdeep Singh, set the tone by removing both openers cheaply. The left-arm pacer induced England opener Phil Salt, caught off-guard both by the pace and bounce, to get a leading edge off the third ball of the match for Samson to take an easy catch behind the wicket. He struck in the very next over to dismiss Ben Duckett as Rinku Singh took a good running catch backward at cover. Finishing with 2/17 in his four overs, Arshdeep also entered the record books by becoming India's leading wicket-taker in T20Is, surpassing Yuzvendra Chahal's 96 wickets.Chakravarthy came in to bowl in the sixth over after Hardik Pandya , sharing the new ball with Arshdeep, went for 27 runs in two overs. The Tamil Nadu spinner struck hard, dismissing Brook and Liam Livingstone clean bowled off consecutive deliveries in his second over. Much was expected of Jacob Bethell after the youngster made blistering international debuts in all three formats of the game last year. But Bethell found it difficult to put bat on ball and Pandya finally had him caught by Sharma at deep mid-wicket on his return for a second spell.Only England skipper Jos Buttler stood tall at one end. Coming one down, he feasted on Pandya, hitting him for two fours in the pacer's first over and four more off his second. But once he was caught by Nitish Kumar Reddy at deep square leg while trying to pull a short one from Chakravarthy for a polished 66 off 44 balls, the end was a foregone conclusion.Samson and Sharma gave India a flying start, getting 10 runs an over. Although Jofra Archer picked up Samson and Surya in the same over, Sharma went berserk, hitting Mark Wood for a four and two sixes in the very next over. England's lone specialist spinner Adil Rashid dropped a caught and bowled chance off Sharma in his first over, but the left-hander replied strongly, hitting him for a four and two sixes to reach his half-century off just 20 balls. The 24-year-old Punjab batter eventually fell after hitting five fours and eight sixes.","India beat England by seven wickets in first of five T20I matches.

She titled the tribute ""advocating for pet adoption with a compilation of photographs and videos.""In 2015, I adopted a beagle from a dog rescue in Canada. He had been at a kill shelter in Kentucky and given a few days to live. I swooped him up….and fell in love. They referred to him as ‘the little guy’ because he was so small and frail, so I named him ‘Guy’. And he was the best guy any girl could have asked for,"" the mother-of-two said in her post.Meghan continued, ""He endured a terrible accident shortly before I moved to the UK which had him undergoing surgeries for several months and unable to leave the clinic. Doctors said he would never walk again, but Dr Noel Fitzpatrick said he could do it. He and I would drive late at night, after hours, to see Guy as he recovered in Surrey for months on end.""This marks her third Instagram post since launching her Netflix series on her new account,""If you followed me on Instagram back in the day, you saw a lot of him - and on The Tig too. He was with me at Suits, when I got engaged, (and then married), when I became a mom….he was with me for everything: the quiet, the chaos, the calm, the comfort,"" she said.""Thank you for loving him so much,"" she wrote, conveying her appreciation to Dr Noel and the team at Queen West Animal Hospital .""As many of you will see Guy in this new series, I hope you’ll understand why his loss has devastated me. I think you might fall a little in love with him too,"" she further emphasised.""I have cried too many tears to count - the type of tears that make you get in the shower with the absurd hope that the running water on your face will somehow make you not feel them, or pretend they’re not there. But they are. And that’s okay too. Thank you for so many years of unconditional love, my sweet Guy. You filled my life in ways you’ll never know,"" the Suits star added., the anticipated programme, launching on January 15, will showcase the Duchess sharing her expertise in cooking and gardening, the Daily Mail reported.Additionally, viewers might also have noticed a black Labrador in the brief promotional footage for Meghan's Netflix programme - Pula, who joined the family before Archie's arrival in 2019.","The Duchess of Sussex announced the passing of her beloved dog, Guy, in a heartfelt Instagram tribute.

No, The Team Management Made the Right Decision Yes, He Should Have Been Included

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

NEW DELHI: Mohammed Shami 's eagerly awaited return was further postponed as the Indian bowler was left out of India's starting eleven for the opening Twenty20 International match against England because the team management didn't think he would fit in with the lineup given the Eden Gardens track's characteristics.After 14 months, everyone was expecting Shami to return to the national team, but when captain Suryakumar Yadav revealed at the toss that he would not be playing, it stoked rumors that the national selectors were not confident in his fitness. Abhishek Sharma explained after the game that the veteran bowler was benched due to the circumstances and the combinations that the team management deemed suitable.""I feel it's the decision of the team management and they thought it's a better option keeping in mind of these conditions,"" Abhishek said at the post-match press conference in Kolkata.The fresh look of India The T20 team is entirely Gautam Gambhir 's creation, and it has performed remarkably up to this point by concentrating on role-specific conditions rather than celebrity culture conformity.'GamBall' against 'Bazball' was the result of not choosing a bowler of Shami 's caliber, assessing the track, and selecting three specialized spinners and one frontline pacer. It's safe to assume which philosophy won.T20Is haven't been his finest suit, as evidenced by his 11-year international career, in which he played 23 of them with 24 wickets and an economy rate of almost nine runs per over.Gambhir didn't want to put a veteran who had just returned from a 14-month forced international break in a situation where Jos Buttler and company could have considered his length to be cannon fodder.Ironically, the 34-year-old pacer, who appeared to be fully recovered, bowled for about 30 minutes at the side nets, aiming for stumps, while Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav chose to bowl at the toss and declared the playing XI without him.Shami had bowled full throttle at the India nets in every session, despite having a hefty strapping on his left knee.Although Abhishek, one of the younger players in the national team, discussed combination, it is still unclear if the senior pacer is still having issues with a swollen left knee following each demanding practice.Given that captain Suryakumar had voiced confidence in Shami's inclusion during the pre-match media conference, there didn't appear to be any serious concerns regarding his fitness.""It's always good to have an experienced bowler in your side, and he is making a comeback after over a year. I am really excited to see him. I have witnessed his journey-what he did at the NCA, how he focused on his bowling and recovery. It's great to see him fit and back in the side,"" Suryakumar said on Tuesday.Shami himself expressed his desire to make a comeback, highlighting the effort he made to demonstrate his fitness by representing Bengal in all three domestic formats, first with the Ranji Trophy , then the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20s, and ending with the Vijay Hazare Trophy.""The hunger to play for the country should never end. If you love it, you will always fight back, no matter how many injuries you face,"" Shami said at a Cricket Association of Bengal event.""No matter how many matches I play, it always feels like less. Once I leave cricket, I may never get this chance again,"" he added during CAB's felicitation ceremony for the victorious Under-15 women's cricketers at Eden Gardens on Monday.Since Sunday, when the camp started, Shami has also been bowling at full throttle after a demanding three-phase exercise that lasted more than an hour.He returned to bowling full force on the eve of the game on Tuesday without experiencing any discernible discomfort.Even though his left knee was always strapped, neither the strength and conditioning coach nor the physiotherapist needed to attend to him.There was only a faint trace of discomfort as he made his way back to the dressing room, taking slow, deliberate movements and appearing to be aware of his left leg.With star pacer Jasprit Bumrah facing a fitness cloud after suffering a back niggle during the fifth Test in Sydney, Shami's return has garnered a lot of attention in the run-up to the Champions Trophy. Ajit Agarkar , the chairman of selectors, also emphasized Shami's importance during last week's Champions Trophy selection announcement in Mumbai.""I don't think his fitness issues were related to white-ball cricket. We were trying to get him to Australia. Unfortunately, his knee didn't allow him to play four-day or five-day cricket.""With white-ball cricket, he has played most of the Syed Mushtaq Ali games and some of the Vijay Hazare games. With uncertainty around Jassi (Bumrah), if Shami is fit and playing regularly, his quality and experience are invaluable,"" Agarkar said.As India look to strike the correct balance before the Champions Trophy, Shami's next chance to demonstrate his preparedness is probably going to come later in the series.","Mohammed Shami was left out of India's starting eleven for the opening Twenty20 International match against England.

NEW DELHI: Abhishek Sharma led an outstanding effort and hit India's second-fastest fifty (in terms of balls faced) against England in the Twenty20 International format at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata.The love affair between Indian left-handers and English bowlers in the Twenty20 International format gained notoriety thanks to Yuvraj Singh 's performances during the 2007 T20 World Cup.Abhishek, who was coached by Yuvraj, demonstrated his power hitting prowess against the English tearaways in the first game of the series. India successfully chased down 133 with more than seven overs remaining thanks to his quick 79 from just 34 deliveries.Abhishek celebrated reaching 50 in just 20 balls during his blitzkrieg, which was the second-fastest score by an Indian during a Twenty20 International match against England.Yuvraj, Abhishek's mentor, is the record holder for the fastest fifty, having reached it in just 12 deliveries in Durban in 2007. During his exploits in Manchester in 2018, KL Rahul celebrated reaching fifty in twenty-seven deliveries.The 8 sixes hit by Abhishek, are the most the most by an Indian against England in T20Is, going past the seven hit by Yuvraj Singh in Durban on September 19, 2007.On Wednesday, Abhishek scored 79 runs at Eden Gardens, with 68 of those runs being boundaries. Striking at 232.35, he hit a staggering eight maximums and five fours.After being dropped twice during the game, he was undoubtedly fortunate. During his daring performance, he fired a barrage of boundaries and celebrated his fifty with a spectacular six.He was dropped a second time until his luck finally ran out. His spectacular innings of 79 (34 balls) came to an end when Harry Brook caught him at long-off as he tried to loft a delivery from Adil Rashid.India managed to chase down a meager 133-run mark with 43 balls remaining due to Abhishek's efforts. With the most balls left, this is India's fastest and most successful chase against England in men's Twenty20 Internationals.The fastest successful chase in India with the most balls remaining was in 2012, prior to the record-breaking performance in Kolkata.

Mohammad Amir 's four-wicket haul and Fakhar Zaman 's undefeated 71 helped the Desert Vipers sail to a decisive victory that solidified their top spot in the rankings.Alex Hales got the Desert Vipers off to a terrific start with a barrage of boundaries, and they wasted no time in their pursuit. Within the first two overs, the team sped to 20/0 after he hit Adam Milne for a maximum and then clobbered Tim Southee for three fours.With some clean hitting, Zaman stepped in, taking aim at Bangladeshi pacer Junaid Siddique in his opening over. He sliced him away for a boundary after crossing the stump, and then he hit a stunning pull shot for four more.Zaman appeared to have a straightforward goal: to prevent the bowlers from settling in.

NEW DELHI: India spinner Varun Chakravarthy was still eager to get better even after he played a game-winning effort against England in the first Twenty20 International.After being left out of India's Champions Trophy squad, Chakravarthy, the local hero of Kolkata, came back to Eden Gardens to reveal his enigmatic variants against England.By cheaply dismissing the opening combination of Ben Duckett and Phil Salt in the first innings, Arshdeep Singh created the ideal environment for Chakravarthy to express himself.He had plenty of time to con the hard-hitting English middle-order by using techniques from his mystery box. Chakravarthy quickly realized that bounce, not turn, was the key to success on a surface where he has bowled numerous times.""I am used to seeing such pitches in the IPL. I know that it is for the seamers, but I know there are certain lengths which are helpful for me. What I realised was I can't beat batsmen with a side-spin. The only way I can beat the batsmen is through bounce,"" Chakravarthy said after winning the Player of the Match award.His effectiveness was also attributed to keeping the ball away from the hitting arc in addition to removing bounce from the surface. Along with Harry Brook and Liam Livingstone, Chakravarthy caught the big fish during his successful outing: England captain Jos Buttler Chakravarthy performed a counterpunch flawlessly when England threatened with a partnership between Buttler and Brook that looked promising.Livingstone followed young sensation Brook in the dressing room with a two-ball duck in the same over after Brook was initially dismissed for 17.Only how long Buttler could stay on the crease would determine England's chances of reaching the 150-run milestone. Buttler knew he had to monitor the boundary rope as the first innings came to a head.Buttler's innings ended on 68(44) after Nitish Reddy charged in to make a wonderful catch when he attempted to draw the ball away towards deep square leg. Following the captain's dismissal, India easily overtook England, who had crawled up to 132.Chakravarthy returned with astounding figures of 3/23 from his four-over performance, with Buttler's wicket being his last wicket of the game. Despite his game-changing performance that helped India win by seven wickets, he believes more work needs to be done.""I am trying to keep it away from their arc, it was holding a bit. Every over, bowling in Eden is challenging. To bowl to batsmen like Jos and other guys is definitely challenging. The last over was very tricky and challenging, but by God's grace, I was successful.

Axar Patel hints at flexible middle-order ahead of England T20I series

NEW DELHI: Rising Indian batting star Tilak Varma is on the brink of rewriting cricketing history in the first T20I against England at Eden Gardens on Wednesday.Having struck back-to-back unbeaten centuries (107 not out and 120 not out against South Africa in November 2024), the 22-year-old could become the only player in T20I history to achieve three consecutive tons in the format.If successful, this feat will firmly establish Tilak as a rare gem in the world of cricket.The upcoming five-match series holds immense significance for India. Despite entering the contest as favourites, buoyed by a stellar T20I record, the team faces added pressure to maintain its dominance.With key veterans like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Ravindra Jadeja stepping away from this format, the responsibility falls on emerging players.Fortunately, newcomers like Abhishek Sharma, Nitish Kumar Reddy, and Tilak Varma have risen to the challenge, providing much-needed stability and firepower.Tilak, in particular, has become a dependable figure in the middle order. His clean hitting and ability to anchor the innings have eased the burden on captain Suryakumar Yadav , who continues to dazzle with his own match-winning capabilities.Another batter to watch is opener Sanju Samson , who has scored three centuries in his last five T20I outings and has a point to prove after being overlooked for the Champions Trophy squad.On the bowling front, India will bank on the experienced Mohammed Shami and the fiery left-arm pace of Arshdeep Singh to counter England’s formidable batting order, led by Jos Buttler and Phil Salt.England, under coach Brendon McCullum, boast a strong lineup, with returning bowlers like Jofra Archer and Mark Wood adding depth to their pace attack.","Tilak Varma could become the only player in T20I history to achieve three consecutive tons in the format.

NEW DELHI: The T20I series between India and England sees the return of Mohammed Shami to international cricket after more than a year.Ahead of the first T20I at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on Wednesday, the Indian cricket board (BCCI) shared a link of a video on their X handle that has Shami talking about his comeback and inspiration in life while flying a kite.The video starts with Shami saying that it has been a long time since he flew a kite because ever since he started playing cricket, he has had only the ball in his hand, but he can still fly the kite well enough and knows how to balance the kite.Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy Drawing a parallel between flying a kite and cricket Shami says, ""The balance of the kite is like lives in cricket, if you're set at the crease you will score runs and take wickets. The rhythm is very important, everything in life has a flow. Whatever it is, your fitness, mindset and skill is important for bowling. Same goes for the kite as well.""Since playing in the ODI World Cup 2023 final against Australia in Ahmedabad, Shami has not been a part of India's pace attack. After undergoing surgery for an ankle ailment, he missed a year of cricket action.Shami made a spectacular comeback to competitive cricket in the Ranji Trophy last year, helping Bengal win with an inspiring 7/156 against Madhya Pradesh.Shami continues in the video, ""Doesn't matter if it is flying a kite, bowling or driving a car, if you are strong and believe in yourself, then I don't think you will find any difference. Look, even after 15 years, I am able to fly this kite. Hence confidence is important for any task.""The Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and the Vijay Hazare Trophy helped Shami recover his rhythm and convinced the selectors to pick him back for India.Also See: Champions Trophy Schedule 2025 In the Vijay Hazare Trophy, Shami took five wickets in three games, and the seasoned pacer concluded SMAT 2024 with 11 wickets in nine games at an average of 25.36.Shami adds in the video, ""When you are scoring runs and taking wickets, everyone is with you. But the real test is to realize who is with you during your tough times. I waited for an entire year and I worked very hard. There was a sense of fear even while running. It's difficult for any player to get injured after being in full flow, go to the NCA for rehabilitation and then make a comeback. When you go through injuries, I feel you grow stronger as an athlete, because you have to repeat a lot of things while being mentally strong. Whatever is done, it is done. I have crossed that phase. If you work hard, you will get the result. That's what I believe in. Even if we fall, we have to get up and walk again, the same applies to sports too. If you get injured, you have to make a comeback, for your team and your country. So, fight and grow!""The video then shows Shami during a training session at the Eden Gardens, first warming up and then bowling full throttle ahead of the busy international cricket season ahead.",Mohammed Shami returns to international cricket after more than a year.

NEW DELHI: In light of India's declining performance, Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Snehasish Ganguly supported head coach Gautam Gambhir and believes he should be given more time.The Indian squad has been in ruins ever since Gambhir took over as head coach and started the era with his regime selections, particularly in the Test format.It all began when, for the first time in 27 years, India lost a bilateral ODI series to Sri Lanka. After defeating Bangladesh in the home series, India enjoyed a little breather, but things quickly deteriorated.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 When New Zealand arrived in India, they stunned the hosts with an incredible display. On paper, India was expected to easily defeat the Kiwis in red-ball cricket, particularly at home. However, the home citadel was breached, and India experienced a historic whitewash for the first time in 24 years.A further blow to India's already open wounds was the Border-Gavaskar Trophy . India suffered a 1-3 series loss and lost the coveted title for the first time in ten years.The current situation of the modern giants has gotten worse as a result of reports of the continuous rift inside the Indian team.Ganguly stepped in to support the struggling coach as the Indian team is in disarray and there is question over the future of the team's Indian stalwarts.""I feel happy because of his approach. As a coach, he got success for KKR after 12 years. We should give him some time. It has been some months since he has been handling the team after Rahul Dravid ,"" Ganguly told ANI.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 Fixtures The next test for Gambhir will be a five-match Twenty20 International series against England, which starts in Kolkata on Wednesday.The three One-Day Internationals (ODIs) that will follow the five-match contest will be the perfect platform to get ready for the Champions Trophy next month.Ganguly was also excited with Mohammed Shami 's comeback to the field. Shami will perform in front of an enthusiastic Kolkata crowd making his comeback after a year.When discussing Shami's comeback, Ganguly emphasized the pacer's recent exploits for Bengal, where he participated in six to seven games and showed outstanding form.""The most important thing is the whole Kolkata crowd will be watching Mohammed Shami,"" Ganguly said.""He came back after a year and bowled very well for Bengal. I was observing his bowling, and he seems to be in great shape. He looks like the old Mohammed Shami--fit and raring to go,"" Ganguly added.Ganguly said he was confident in Shami's potential to have a big effect because the bowler appeared sharp and prepared for the contest.""Overall, it will be a very good match,"" he noted, emphasizing the excitement surrounding Shami's return to Eden Gardens .",Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Snehasish Ganguly supports head coach Gautam Gambhir.

NEW DELHI: India's No. 1 Arjun Erigaisi suffered his third defeat during the fourth round of the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025 in Wijk aan Zee on Tuesday. With only 0.5 points out of the inaugural four rounds, Arjun finds himself at the bottom of the Masters leaderboard, alongside compatriot Leon Luke Mendonca.Playing with the white pieces against Russia’s Vladimir Fedoseev, Arjun opened with the Queen's Gambit Declined (QGD) in a Classical variation. Despite a strong start, Arjun lost the momentum on the 15th move with a costly blunder, Ne2, allowing Fedoseev to seize a pawn with fxg4.A series of three suboptimal moves from Fedoseev briefly gave Arjun hope of a comeback. However, Arjun’s decision to capture a pawn on f5 with his knight proved fatal, as Fedoseev countered with Qxf5, netting a decisive advantage. With 10 minutes still on the clock, Arjun resigned on the 39th move, with Fedoseev up a knight.While Arjun's poor run in the tournament continued at one end of the room, Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu showed no hints of slowing his impressive run, becoming the sole leader of the tournament with a dominant victory over Leon Luke Mendonca. This marked Praggnanandhaa's third win, all against his fellow Indians — Pentala Harikrishna, Arjun Erigaisi, and now Mendonca.In a game featuring the Ruy-Lopez (Spanish Opening), Praggnanandhaa displayed exceptional precision, playing with a remarkable 94.3% accuracy.In a daring sequence, he sacrificed his queen with Rxe4, decisively dismantling Mendonca's defensive setup. Leon eventually resigned on the 46th move as Praggnanandhaa's relentless play left him with no hope of recovery.With this win, and a draw between Nodirbek Abdusattorov and Wei Yi, Praggnanandhaa now leads the tournament standings with 3.5/4 and climbs to World No. 8 in the live rankings.Pentala Harikrishna had a quick and efficient day, finishing his game in just 23 moves against the Netherlands’ Max Warmerdam.Despite a misstep on the 21st move (Rf3+), which briefly handed the advantage to Max, a subsequent blunder by Warmerdam (Kg6) sealed his fate, allowing Harikrishna to claim the win. Harikrishna’s performance was nearly flawless, with a 92.9% accuracy score.In another encounter, World No. 2 Fabiano Caruana, playing white, and Dutch No. 1 Anish Giri battled to a subtle 36-move draw. Meanwhile, D. Gukesh played out a gruelling 70-move draw against Alexey Sarana in an intense battle.In the Challengers section, Vaishali Rameshbabu scored a comfortable victory against Nodirbek Yakubboev. Divya Deshmukh, playing with the white pieces, displayed her attacking acumen to secure her first win of the tournament against Ediz Gurel.After struggling in the initial rounds, this win raises the question of whether Divya can turn her campaign around in the upcoming games.Elsewhere, 15-year-old Miaoyi Lu held Irina Bulmaga to a draw, maintaining her position at the top of the table along with Thai Dai van Nguyen and Erwin l'Ami.",India's No. 1 Arjun Erigaisi suffered his third defeat during the fourth round of the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025 in Wijk aan Zee on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: India batter Sanju Samson came out all guns blazing in pursuit of 133 in the first T20I against England at Eden Gardens , unleashing a blistering assault on Gus Atkinson and scoring 22 runs off his first over with four fours and a magnificent six.The first delivery was short, and Samson was ready. He leaned back slightly, pulling it with finesse behind square for a boundary. The crowd erupted. Atkinson's next ball, a good length outside off, was met with a perfectly timed on-the-rise drive, racing through extra cover for another four.The third ball of the over was the only dot delivery, with Samson slashing hard for a cut but missing as the ball bounced over the blade.Atkinson, visibly under pressure, overcorrected his length on the fourth ball. Samson seized the opportunity, stepping forward and throwing his bat at the ball. The sound of the bat meeting the ball was crisp, and it soared over the covers for a magnificent six.Determined to recover, Atkinson tried a back-of-a-length delivery outside off. Samson slashed hard, but the ball zipped over his blade. Atkinson seemed to regain his footing for a moment.But Samson wasn't done. A fuller delivery followed, and Samson whipped it to the right of mid-on, showcasing his elegant wristwork as the ball sped to the fence. Atkinson's final delivery strayed onto the pads, and Samson glanced it delicately past short fine leg, leaving deep square leg with no chance.However, Samson failed to keep the momentum going as he perished for 26 off 20 balls.Earlier, India bowled out the tourists for 132 as England skipper Jos Buttler played a lone hand with his 68.Left-arm fast bowler Arshdeep Singh removed both openers early and spinner Varun Chakravarthy claimed three wickets after India elected to field first in Kolkata.","Sanju Samson scored 22 runs off his first over with four fours and a magnificent six.

Ruben Amorim has clarified his earlier controversial remark about his Manchester United team being ""the worst team"" in the club's history, while acknowledging his own accountability for the difficulties at Old Trafford .""I was talking more about me than the players,"" said the coach. ""I also talked in the same response (that) I was not helping my players and if you look around, every time I speak, and I speak a lot, every time you push that the players are not good enough, I never put the spot(light) on my players.""I'm frustrated sometimes, and sometimes I should not say it in those terms; but it is what it is and sometimes it's really hard to hide the frustration in some moments. But the good thing is that I said the same things in a different way in the dressing room five minutes before. The response was quite normal because I'm really blunt with my players"".Under Amorim's leadership since his November appointment following Erik ten Hag's dismissal, United have suffered six defeats in their previous nine Premier League matches, including a 3-1 loss to Brighton on Sunday.The club currently sits in 13th position in the Premier League standings.""We are more nervous playing at home (Old Trafford) than away because we lost a lot of games, like four games in five. So it's getting harder,"" he said.""But we can improve. I think if we don't suffer the first goal, like in the fourth minute, and I remember like it's fourth minute, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, and then it's really hard to calm down the team. The first thing in my mind is they (the opposition) cannot score. We need to score the first one. If we score the first one, I think that will change and we'll play better at home in the beginning.""","Manchester United coach Ruben Amorim has clarified his earlier controversial remark about his team being ""the worst team"" in the club's history.
