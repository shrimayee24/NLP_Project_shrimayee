NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad SRH ) are set to clash with Gujarat Titans at Hyderabad’s Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in match number 66 of the IPL 2024 season.SRH finds themselves in a pivotal position in the IPL 2024 points table , holding the reins of their destiny despite their inconsistent performance. Their powerful batting lineup will be the focal point as they aim for a playoff spot in the Indian Premier League.Securing another victory would cement their place in the playoffs, requiring just one point for qualification. Led by Pat Cummins, SRH also eyes the possibility of competing for the top two positions, buoyed by their impressive net run rate of +0.406 and an upcoming fixture post this match.Currently standing at 14 points from 12 matches, SRH has the potential to accumulate a maximum of 18 points, positioning them favourably for a top-two finish if other outcomes align in their favor.The team enjoys both physical and mental advantages ahead of the encounter with GT, having had a week's break and riding high on confidence following their record-breaking win against Lucknow Super Giants on May 8.In contrast, Gujarat Titans have struggled in this season's IPL, managing only five wins from 13 games, accruing 11 points and falling out of contention for the playoffs.In head-to-head clashes, Gujarat Titans maintain a 3-1 advantage over Sunrisers Hyderabad. While SRH claimed victory in their inaugural encounter during IPL 2022, the Titans have dominated subsequent meetings, securing clinical wins. Notably, led by Shubman Gill, Gujarat Titans also triumphed over SRH by seven wickets earlier in the current season.Regarding the pitch, Hyderabad’s Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium has favored batsmen significantly in recent times. While the average first innings total historically stands at 162 across all IPL matches at this venue, IPL 2024 matches have witnessed an upward trend, with averages creeping into the early 200s. This underscores the conducive conditions for high-scoring encounters. Given the recent track record, the toss-winning captain is likely to opt for fielding first.Examining the ground history of Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in IPL 2024, we find that in the five matches played so far, three have been won by teams batting first, while two have been won by teams chasing. The average first innings total stands impressively at 203, with the average second innings total slightly lower at 190. The highest total recorded on this ground in IPL 2024 is 277/3 by Sunrisers Hyderabad against Mumbai Indians, while the lowest total is 165/5 by Chennai Super Kings against Sunrisers Hyderabad.1. Given the high-scoring nature of the pitch, both captains are likely to opt for a line up packed with aggressive batsmen capable of exploiting the conditions.2. Including specialist spinners could prove beneficial for teams seeking to counter run-scoring onslaughts in the middle overs.In the IPL 2024 season, Sunrisers Hyderabad's opener Travis Head has been in stellar form, amassing an impressive total of 533 runs in just 11 matches. This places him third in the race for the prestigious ' Orange Cap '. Head's contributions have been remarkable, as he has notched three of SRH's top four fastest half-centuries this year. Notably, he smashed a scintillating 41-ball 102 against RCB, marking SRH's fastest century in history. With a strike rate of 201.89 in IPL 2024, Head boasts the highest among the top 10 batters, second only to his opening partner Abhishek Sharma, who holds the 14th position.Sunrisers Hyderabad's seam maestro, T Natarajan, has been a standout performer in IPL 2024, claiming an impressive tally of 15 wickets in just 10 matches. His contributions have been pivotal, including a match-winning spell against Rajasthan Royals in a thrilling encounter earlier in the season. Natarajan's brilliance was further exemplified when he dismantled Delhi Capitals with figures of 4-19 while defending a formidable total of 267 runs earlier in the tournament. (Here's a list of updated Purple cap list) Gujarat Titans' top-order batsman, Sai Sudharsan, has been a revelation in the IPL 2024 season, accumulating a total of 527 runs in 12 matches. This remarkable feat places him fourth on the 'Orange Cap' list. Sudharsan has displayed consistency and maturity, boasting an impressive average of 47.90. He has notched three half-centuries in his last four innings, showcasing his ability to perform under pressure and anchor the innings effectively.Abhishek Sharma, Travis Head, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Aiden Markram, Abdul Samad, Nitish Reddy, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins (c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat, T Natarajan, Mayank Markande, Umran Malik, Anmolpreet Singh, Glenn Phillips (wk), Rahul Tripathi, Washington Sundar, Upendra Yadav (wk), Jhathavedh Subramanyan, Sanvir Singh, Vijayakanth Viyaskanth, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Marco Jansen, Akash Maharaj Singh, Mayank Agarwal.Shubman Gill (c), David Miller, Matthew Wade, Wriddhiman Saha, Kane Williamson, Abhinav Manohar, B.

IPL playoff scenarios

:

|

NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad clinched their place in the IPL 2024 playoffs after their match against Gujarat Titans was abandoned without a ball bowled due to persistent rain at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Thursday. The washout resulted in both teams sharing a point each, propelling Hyderabad to third place on the points table with 15 points.Gujarat Titans, who had already been knocked out of the play-off race earlier in the week after their match against Kolkata Knight Riders was similarly abandoned due to rain, now find themselves out of contention entirely.With this outcome, the defending champions Chennai Super Kings , currently sitting in fourth place, and Royal Challengers Bengaluru are now leading the hunt for the final play-off spot. Both teams are gearing up for a crucial encounter that could determine their playoff fate.* KKR are already assured of sole top spot* If RR win their last game against KKR, they will be guaranteed sole second spot with 18 points. If they lose, they remain on 16 points, which means SRH can overtake them by winning against PBKS. They are sure to qualify, but need to win if they want the second spot* With 15 points, SRH have their fate in their hands. Win the last game and finish sole second or sole third with 17 points depending on the result of the KKR-RR game. If they lose the last game, RR will be ahead and CSK can get ahead by beating RCB. They will then finish fourth* CSK at 14 also have their fate in their hands. If they win against RCB, they finish on 16 points, and at worst fourth spot* RCB need to win against CSK to have a chance. That would take them to 14 points, level with CSK and DC behind KKR, RR and SRH. LSG too could tie at 14, but the good news for RCB is that they have a much better NRR than DC or LSG. Effectively, therefore, RCB need to close the NRR gap with CSK to beat them to the fourth spot. That’s not a tall ask. In a 200-run chase, they would need to win within 18.1 overs. If they bat first and score 200, they would need to restrict CSK to 182 or less.* DC are effectively out of it since KKR, RR and SRH are already ahead. If CSK win against RCB, they too will be ahead. If not, RCB will match DC’s 14 points with a superior NRR* LSG are not totally out of it, theoretically. If they beat MI and RCB beat CSK, they can tie for fourth spot on 14 points. But their NRR is so much worse than CSK’s and RCB’s that this is only a theoretical possibility* In short, KKR, RR and SRH are sure to qualify and one of CSK and RCB will join them in the last four (not necessarily the winner of the game between the two).","Sunrisers Hyderabad clinch their place in IPL 2024 playoffs after their match against Gujarat Titans was abandoned without a ball bowled due to persistent rain.

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals (RR) suffered their fourth consecutive defeat as Punjab Kings (PBKS) secured a five-wicket victory in their IPL match on Wednesday. Despite this setback, RR, with 16 points, are assured of a playoff spot. However, their chances of finishing in the top two are slim due to an inferior net run rate, especially since Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) can still reach 18 points.In the match, Punjab Kings restricted RR to a modest 144 for nine.Riyan Parag, a local favorite, top-scored for RR with 48 off 34 balls on a challenging pitch. Punjab's bowlers were effective, with skipper Sam Curran taking 2 for 24 in 3 overs, Harshal Patel 2 for 28 in 4 overs, Nathan Ellis 1 for 24 in 4 overs, and Rahul Chahar 2 for 26 in 4 overs.In their chase, Curran led from the front with an unbeaten 63 off 41 balls, guiding PBKS to victory with seven balls to spare. Despite the win being inconsequential for Punjab, it was a morale-boosting performance for the team.In the IPL 2024 Orange Cap race, RCB's Virat Kohli tops the leaderboard with 661 runs in 13 innings. He is closely followed by CSK's skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad, who has accumulated 583 runs in 13 innings. SRH's Travis Head, thanks to his unbeaten 89, has moved up to third place with 533 runs. Riyan Parag's impressive performance against PBKS has elevated him to fourth place with 531 runs. B Sai Sudharsan's maiden IPL century has placed him fifth with 527 runs. Sanju Samson rounds out the top six, having scored 504 runs for Rajasthan Royals.In the pursuit of the coveted Purple Cap in IPL 2024, Harshal Patel has surged to the top with 22 wickets, overtaking Jasprit Bumrah who trails closely with 20 dismissals. Varun Chakravarthy's consistent performances have earned him third place with 18 wickets in 12 innings. Yuzvendra Chahal, the spin maestro of RR, has entered the Purple Cap race, securing fourth position with 17 wickets. Khaleel Ahmed of DC also holds 17 wickets, with Chahal edging ahead due to a superior economy rate. As the IPL 2024 season unfolds, bowlers are poised for an intense battle in the race for the Purple Cap.","The Orange Cap is the cap of the Indian national football team.

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bangalore have staged a remarkable comeback in the IPL playoff race , overcoming their early-season challenges under the leadership of Faf du Plessis . Despite a rocky start with seven losses in their first eight matches, Bangalore has embarked on an impressive five-match winning streak.Sunday's commanding 47-run victory over Delhi Capitals propelled them to fifth place in the table with 12 points, edging past Delhi and Lucknow on net run rate .In a must-win encounter, Bengaluru overcame the early setbacks of Du Plessis and leading run-scorer Virat Kohli , as Will Jacks' brisk 41 off 29 balls and Rajat Patidar's aggressive 52 off 32 deliveries powered them to a challenging total of 187-9.Their bowlers then delivered a clinical performance, dismantling Delhi's batting line up to dismiss them for 140 in 19.1 overs. Pacer Yash Dayal starred with the ball, claiming three crucial wickets to seal Bengaluru's emphatic victory and reignite their playoff aspirations in the IPL.In the crucial match against CSK , with Will Jacks unavailable, all eyes will be on skipper Virat Kohli to lead the batting charge alongside Faf du Plessis. RCB fans are eager for Glenn Maxwell to rediscover his top form in this must-win encounter.After LSG lost to DC on Tuesday, RCB now need to secure a victory against CSK in their last league game by either:- Winning by 18 runs.- Chasing the target within 18.1 overs.This is necessary to surpass CSK's Net Run Rate (NRR).- If SRH (Sunrisers Hyderabad) loses both of their matches then both CSK and RCB have a chance to qualify.- RCB's qualification hinges on winning their last match, regardless of their Net Run Rate.","Royal Challengers Bangalore have staged a remarkable comeback in the IPL playoff race.

Football icon Sunil Chhetri to retire after India's match against Kuwait,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/football-icon-sunil-chhetri-to-retire-after-indias-match-against-kuwait/articleshow/110164661.cms,"WATCH CHHETRI ANNOUNCING HIS RETIREMENT

India's football icon Sunil Chhetri on Thursday announced his decision to retire from international football after the country's FIFA World Cup qualification match against Kuwait on June 6.The national team captain announced his decision via a video he posted on his social media accounts.The 39-year-old striker made his international debut against Pakistan on 12th June 2005 and scored his first goal for India in the same match.""It's not that I was feeling tired, not that I was feeling this or that,"" Chhetri said in the video. ""When the instinct came that this should be my last game, I thought about it a lot (and) eventually I came to this decision.""As of now, Chhetri stands tall with third most international goals (94 in 150 matches) among the currently active players, behind Argentine legend Lionel Messi (106 in 180 matches) at number two and the leader Cristiano Ronaldo (128 in 205 matches), the legend from Portugal.He is also the most capped Indian footballer.Chhetri's decorated career saw him winning the AIFF Player of the Year award on six occasions, besides receiving the Arjuna Award in 2011 and the Padma Shri in 2019.Looking back at his 19-year career, Chhetri said: ""You know the feeling that I recollect in the last 19 years is a very nice combination between duty, pressure and immense joy. I never thought individually, these are the many games that I've played for the country, this is what I've done, good or bad, but now I did it.""This last one and a half, two months, I did it and it was very strange. I did it because probably I was going towards the decision that this game, this next game is going to be my last. And the moment I told myself first, that yes, this is the game that is going to be my last, is when I started recollecting everything.""It was so strange, I started thinking about this game, that game, this coach, that coach, that team, that member, that ground, that away match, this good game, that bad game, all my individual performances, everything came, all the flashes came. So when I did decide that this is it, this is going to be my last game.""On the international stage, Chhetri has been part of the title-winning Indian teams in the AFC Challenge Cup in 2008, the SAFF Championship in 2011 and 2015, the Nehru Cup in 2007, 2009 and 2012, as well as the Intercontinental Cup in 2017 and 2018.Going into Chhetri's last international outing next month, India are currently second in Group A off FIFA World Cup qualifiers with four points, behind leaders Qatar. Kuwait are fourth with 3 points.He also shared the emotions of his family the moment he told them about his decision.""I told my mom, my dad and my wife, my family first, my dad was...he was normal, he was relieved, happy, everything, but my mom and my wife started crying...they couldn't express to me as to why they burst into tears.""",India's football icon Sunil Chhetri announced his decision to retire from international football.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians ' all-rounder Naman Dhir was among the young players given a chance to showcase their talent in the Indian Premier League 2024.However, Dhir had limited success in his debut season, scoring only 78 runs in six matches at a strike rate of 152.04. These modest figures did not make a significant impact.The 24-year-old batsman from Punjab on Thursday expressed that he has gained more from his failures than successes during IPL 2024 .He mentioned that the team will take the field for the last time at the Wankhede Stadium on Friday, aiming to conclude the campaign with a victory against the Lucknow Super Giants ""I think sometimes failures teach you more and I learned a lot this season, understanding how to remain calm when things are not going well for you, learning how one should approach various situations and try and build their innings,"" Dhir said in the pre-match press conference ahead of Mumbai Indians' clash with Lucknow Super Giants at the Wankhede.Dhir stated that Mumbai Indians will play for pride in Friday's match, aiming to conclude the campaign on a winning note.""We will play for our pride. We want to win this match and end the campaign on a winning note. It is an opportunity for youngsters to showcase their talent. It has not been a great season for us but we have always tried to give our best in each match,"" said Naman Dhir, who bowls potent off-breaks too.Dhir was picked by Mumbai Indians for his success at the domestic level. Dhir had scored two centuries for Punjab in eight matches of the 2023 Ranji Trophy season.According to the Mumbai Indians website, Dhir is a finisher, batting at the death and closing out games as he did in Punjab’s maiden Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy win last year.In IPL 2024, he was part of the MI middle order though on occasions, he was also sent one-down.Dhir said it was a learning experience for him as he picked on the brains of coaches Kieron Pollard and Mark Boucher and also learned from watching top batters like Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav from his team.He said he also observed the top batters from other teams but did not get to interact with any of the stars from opponent teams except Punjab Kings.Summing up the season and the lack of support for seasoned pacer Jasprit Bumrah who waged a lone battle for Mumbai Indians, Dhir said, ""“Sometimes we batted well or sometimes we bowled well. The coaches have also spoken with us that it was not our season, yet we worked hard. Yes, Jasprit bhai did not get enough support for his bowling in some matches, but we will learn from it.”Bumrah has taken 20 wickets in IPL 2024 so far and was the lone bright spot for Mumbai Indians.Overall, Mumbai Indians and Lucknow Super Giants have played four matches in the Indian Premier League (IPL) so far, with LSG winning three of them.",Naman Dhir scored 78 runs in six matches for Mumbai Indians in IPL 2024. The 24-year-old batsman said he has gained more from his failures than successes.

Virat Kohli: 'Open the innings or bat at No.3?': Debate intensifies over Virat Kohli's batting position for T20 World Cup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/open-the-innings-or-bat-at-no-3-debate-intensifies-over-virat-kohlis-batting-position-for-t20-world-cup/articleshow/110192548.cms,"NEW DELHI: The cricketing world is abuzz with speculation not only about Virat Kohli 's strike rate but also about his potential batting position for India in the upcoming T20 World Cup . The key question: Should Kohli open the innings or stick to his familiar No. 3 spot?While India's decision-makers, including captain Rohit Sharma , coach Rahul Dravid, and Kohli himself, may have already made their decision, the cricket community remains in suspense until Rohit addresses the matter in the pre-match press conference ahead of India’s fixture against Ireland.Several cricketing legends have weighed in on the debate. Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly had advocated for Kohli opening the batting. Supporting Ganguly's view, former Australian captain Tim Paine echoed similar sentiments on the 'Around the Wicket' podcast.""I certainly would [have Kohli open]. I think Virat Kohli has earned the right to bat wherever he wants, particularly when he's in this kind of form,"" said Paine. ""If I were part of the management, I would want my best player facing as many balls as possible.""""Virat is an experienced player, and I would want him at the top to face the maximum number of deliveries,"" Paine asserted. ""When a player of his caliber is in red-hot form, you want him to have the most impact on the game.""On the other side of the debate, former India cricketer Suresh Raina believes Kohli should continue at No. 3, a position where he has traditionally thrived.Aaron Finch , another former Australian captain, also supports Kohli batting at No. 3. Finch highlighted Kohli's impressive strike rate of 155 this IPL season, the highest of his career, and suggested that Kohli at No. 3 provides the stability needed for the team.""There was so much talk around it at the start of the tournament. Will he be in the World Cup squad? To be able to put that aside and go out there and do his job… striking at 155 is the highest he has struck throughout his career, so it's a great point,"" Finch noted. ""I would still keep him at 3. The stability he offers at No. 3 creates an environment for everybody else to play their natural game.""Finch also proposed that Yashasvi Jaiswal , with his aggressive style, should partner Rohit Sharma at the top.""You've got Jaiswal who can hit them out of the park. He can give them a flyer. I am just not sure whether Virat and Rohit at the top would create that dynamic approach that you need in the West Indies,"" Finch added.As the T20 World Cup approaches, the debate over Kohli's batting position remains a hot topic. Fans and experts alike await the final decision, hoping it will best serve India's ambitions on the global stage.",The cricketing world is abuzz with speculation about Virat Kohli's potential batting position for India in the upcoming T20 World Cup.

Expressing optimism that the Indian men's cricket team will win the 2024 T20 World Cup after suffering a loss in the final of the ODI tournament last year, BCCI secretary Jay Shah said the squad has a good balance between form and experience.""The selectors can't choose on the basis of IPL performance alone, as overseas experience is also necessary,"" he said.In an exclusive interview, Jay Shah, secretary and key mover and shaker at BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) spoke to Harsh Vardhan Goenka, industrialist and cricket aficionado, at the board's headquarters at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.Shah said the biggest achievement of his tenure so far was holding the 2020 IPL in UAE in the midst of Covid-19. ""Olympics, EPL and French Open had already been postponed or cancelled... We demonstrated to the world what BCCI could achieve,"" he said.Asked about the criticism of IPL's impact player rule by several former and present cricketers, Shah replied, ""It's a test case. We are consulting players, franchisees and all concerned. I feel the matches are getting more interesting, more Indian players are getting a chance to play. If our consultations reveal dissatisfaction, we will change it.""On whether he thought IPL pitches have become too batting friendly, he said, ""I do not quite agree. If you look at the game between LSG and SRH, LSG scored 165/4 in 20 overs. On that pitch, SRH chased the target in around 9 overs without losing a wicket. Pitches are very good, created transparently and overseen by BCCI's central curator.""When I took over, my first decision was to strengthen the National Cricket Academy. We have invested more than Rs 250 crore to improve it and we hope to open the world class, new facility this July or August. My biggest achievement in my tenure was holding the 2020 IPL in UAE in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.The Olympics, English Premier League and French Open had already been postponed/cancelled. We created an isolation bubble within which we conducted the tournament. We demonstrated to the world what BCCI could achieve. We also changed the IPL broadcasting bidding process, separating the TV and digital feeds into separate bids netting us an extra Rs. 5,000 crore (out of a total Rs 48,390 crore). As BCCI's representative in ICC, I also helped boost our revenue due from ICC. As per the new revenue distribution model (2023-27), BCCI will be allocated a share of 38.5%. In the previous cycle, BCCI's revenue share stood at 22.4%.To me, one of your greatest achievements is your encouragement to women's cricket.When I decided to create WPL (Women's Premier League), I had a lot of convincing to do. One of the arguments I used was that 51% of IPL viewership was female. When we had the women's series against Australia in Navi Mumbai, we made the entrance free and we got a full house. I also insisted on pay parity because this would encourage women to come out and play. After my decision, I am glad to inform you that ICC also announced pay parity in prize money for the Women's World cup. We have also introduced a sports psychologist for the women's team and hired Amol Mazumdar as a dedicated coach for them.We did really well at the last ICC Men's World Cup 2023, but the final victory eluded us. I am optimistic that we will bring home the T20 World Cup trophy this year.It has a good balance between form and experience. The selectors cannot choose on the basis of IPL performance alone, as overseas experience is also necessary.India, Australia, New Zealand and the hosts, West Indies, because they are good in T20.As an administrator, I leave the cricketing decision to the experts. In BCCI, we have appointed VVS Laxman to look after NCA and Rahul Dravid as the Indian team coach. So, my job really is to choose the best and support them. I have full faith in them, and I know they are doing a fantastic job.Roger Binny is the cricketing brain. He is involved in each and every cricketing decision while I look after the administration and finance part. But finally, we do everything together. We have a very transparent and consultative process.Yes, talents like Yashaswi Jaiswal and Rinku Singh were test cases for BCCI. We empower state associations and give them guidelines to develop infrastructure, and we are searching for talent in all states. If they feel someone can do well for India, we recruit them to NCA. Right now, we have a pool of 50 players. So, if we need to play bilateral cricket with three different countries, we are in a position to do that. In NCA we train them to have all-round development, including helping them in personality development and wealth management.It's a test case. We are consulting players, franchisees and all concerned. I feel the matches are getting more interesting, more Indian players are getting a chance to play. If our consultations reveal dissatisfaction, we will change it.I don't quite agree. If you look at the game between LSG and SRH, LSG scored 165/4 in 20 overs. On that same pitch, SRH chased the target in around 9 overs without losing a wicket. Pitches are very good, created transparently and overseen by BCCI's central curator.This time we have introduced the 'smart' replay feature wherein the third umpire has access to all broadcast cameras operated by dedicated operators. The decision making for umpires and players' reviews have been much more time efficient due to this. This year we have also added a fast bowling insurance clause in the contract. So, if somebody gets injured, like Mayank Yadav, he will be compensated. We have a mega auction every third year. This will give an opportunity for players to get shuffled, providing different teams the opportunity to win the trophy. Another thing we have introduced is video graphing the entire process of bidding for new teams. It used to be a closed bid. Now all the bids are opened by the bidders themselves, providing complete transparency.A large proportion is pumped into state associations to improve their infrastructure and facilities. The major stream of revenues for BCCI is media rights and sponsorship of BCCI and IPL. In the case of IPL, the additional stream is franchise fee from IPL teams. From the revenues that BCCI generates, 70% is given to state associations for grassroots programmes, development of Infrastructure, conducting various tournaments across age groups, junior and senior levels to tap the talent across the length and breadth of the country. Then 26% of revenues are utilised for payment to players by way of retainership and match fees to men's international players, women's international players and domestic players. In case of IPL, the revenues are split 50:50 between BCCI and the 10 franchises, while 70% of franchise fee received by BCCI is also given to the associations.I love tennis and football. My favourite tennis player is Rafa Nadal who I believe is unbeatable on clay.Sunil Gavaskar of course, Sachin Tendulkar and MS Dhoni. From the current crop it's Virat Kohli , Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya as well.As BCCI secretary, I need to remain neutral, but I'm proud of all IPL teams for their unique style and contribution to the league's success.Of course, the Narendra Modi stadium in Ahmedabad. It is the largest sports stadium in the world with great facilities. I took the responsibility and had the entire stadium built in two-and-a-half years.Put the right people to oversee the game and at the same time maintain transparency in financial matters. I am also inspired by Swami Vivekanand - 'Arise, awake and stop not till the goal is achieved'.","BCCI secretary Jay Shah spoke to Harsh Vardhan Goenka, industrialist and cricket aficionado, at the board's headquarters at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium. Shah said the biggest achievement of his tenure so far was holding the 2020 IPL in UAE in the midst of Covid-19.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110192423,imgsize-24874,width-400,resizemode-4/110192423.jpg"

It's not going to be easy for both teams. RCB has the momentum, a solid momentum. And if they win with this momentum and qualify for the playoffs, it will be a big danger for the other three teams in the playoffs as there is no more dangerous side than the one in strong momentum,"" Pathan remarked.RCB's recent performance surge positions them as a formidable opponent, but Pathan also underscored the enduring pedigree of CSK, despite their current struggles.""CSK bring in the pedigree of being the team who knows how to win crucial moments. But they have lots of issues at the moment. Injury issues, new captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni is no longer leading them,"" he noted.""You might have seen him occasionally setting the field, but he is not the captain.

CHENNAI: Cricket is at a crossroads with a part of the T20 World Cup in June taking place in the USA ahead of the sport's re-entry into the Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028.The world is waiting with bated breath to see how the public accepts cricket in the United States , which is a new market for the sport.For cricket in the US to be successful, the India-Pakistan game group league game on June 9 in the Nassau County Stadium, 35 kilometres east of Manhattan, must be a hit.And the ICC and United States Cricket have left no stone unturned to produce a stadium with a capacity of 34,000 in six months' time.The stadium, where eight matches will be played including three games featuring India, was inaugurated by legendary Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt on Wednesday.Ahead of the occasion, Chris Tetley, head of events, ICC, said that the ground meets international standards comfortably.""Whenever a new stadium comes up, there are a lot of questions about the size. But the Nassau County ground is not a token-sized ground - it is 75 yards east west and 67 yards north south from the centre. It is similar to the size of Wankhede . The drainage facilities, too, will be world-class,' Tetley said during an interaction.Not too long ago, it was just a municipality park and the ICC worked on war-footing to get the facility ready. Other than the four centre wickets, there are six practice pitches near the ground and drop-in pitches will be used for the tournament.The pitches have been prepared in Florida under the supervision of Damian Hough, head curator of Adelaide Oval, and have been brought to New York in trucks. Hough, who knows all about producing great wickets, says that it was a major challenge but they are happy with how things have shaped up.""The pitches will have pace and bounce and the ball should come on to the bat, something that the players prefer. The idea is to produce good pitches that will stay good throughout the tournament and the players will enjoy playing on,' Hough said.The galleries for the venue are makeshift. The temporary structure will be brought in from the Formula One track of Las Vegas and returned after the tournament is over.","Nassau County Stadium in New York will host the T20 World Cup in June.

However, despite their downward spiral towards the end of the league stage after a dream start to the season, Royals have booked a place in the Qualifiers.“Obviously, we are disappointed.It is never a great feeling when you are losing games in a row. Then your mind plays back to what if. What if we won against Sunriesrs? But you have to get some perspective too. Even with the four losses in a row, we are second (on the table), we have qualified. It just takes one better game to turn things around and I think we are the capable ones,” assessed the Kiwi.Heaping praises on their highest scorer of the game and the season, local boy Riyan Parag , Bond said, “Riyan has had an amazing season, hasn't he? His promotion to No. 4 really suited him. He’s had a number of years batting in a position that was pretty tough down the order and people forget how young he is. It just takes some time when you’re young. Obviously, I saw how well he played in the domestic tournaments this season, particularly in T20s.”“I’m proud of him the way he has played so far. I think the team is super excited for him. He’s borne the brunt of some criticism over the last few years in terms of performances and so to put that aside and come out the way he’s played this season, real credit to him for the work he’s put in,” added Bond.Meanwhile, the Impact player rule got Bond’s backing.“I like the rule, I like seeing sixes, I like seeing runs and I like seeing bowlers put under pressure. The beauty of the game of cricket is that you have to adjust and adapt. Even from last year the batters have done that, the scores have gone up. I love watching it and it still amazes me the quality of hitting in cricket. Bowlers haven’t caught up, they have to plan better, they have to think better and make better decisions,” Bond, himself a former pacer, said.Were playing for pride only, says Ellis: Punjab pacer Nathan Ellis , playing his first game of the season, said after the match, “Coming to the ground we didn’t really know what to do – bat or bowl.

NEW DELHI: Parthiv Patel 's assessment of Punjab Kings (PBKS) skipper Sam Curran 's performance in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 suggests that it was a season that Englishman would likely want to put behind him.Throughout the season, Curran's performance with the bat was below par, scoring 270 runs in 13 matches at a strike rate of 123.29. His inability to make significant contributions with the bat might have been a contributing factor to PBKS's mixed fortunes in the tournament.Similarly, with the ball, while Curran managed to pick up 16 wickets, his economy rate of 10.15 indicates that he struggled to contain the opposition's batting line-up effectively.This could have put additional pressure on PBKS during crucial phases of the game.Overall, Parthiv's assessment suggests that IPL 2024 was a challenging season for Curran, both in terms of his batting and bowling performances, and he would likely be looking to bounce back stronger in future seasons.Speaking at the JioCinema, Parthiv said Curran batted well against Rajasthan Royals (RR) on Wednesday. He further praised the English cricketer and said he helped the Punjab-based franchise win matches when they needed him the most.""This was a season to forget, but he batted well today. He played a great innings, took responsibility, and played 41 balls. He took his time at the start and whenever it seemed like he was getting stuck, he pulled out some big shots. He's experienced under pressure as an international cricketer, that is what we saw today. When Punjab needed him the most, he won them the match,"" Parthiv was quoted in a release from Jio Cinema as saying.Recapping the match, RR won the toss and chose to bat first. However, they encountered early setbacks, losing wickets at regular intervals. Despite this, valuable contributions from Riyan Parag , who scored 48 runs off 34 balls with six fours, and Ravichandran Ashwin, who added 28 runs off 19 balls, including two fours and a six, guided RR to a total of 144/9 in their allotted 20 overs.Punjab Kings (PBKS) showcased disciplined bowling, with skipper Sam Curran, Rahul Chahar, and Harshal Patel each claiming two wickets, conceding 24, 26, and 28 runs respectively.In the chase, PBKS found themselves struggling at 48/4 initially. However, a remarkable half-century from skipper Sam Curran, who remained unbeaten on 63 runs off 41 balls, comprising five fours and three sixes, steered the team to a crucial five-wicket victory with seven balls to spare.Avesh Khan emerged as the top bowler for RR, picking up two wickets for 26 runs.Despite RR's loss marking their fourth consecutive defeat, they maintain the second spot in the standings with eight wins and five losses, accumulating a total of 16 points.

NEW DELHI: After Rajasthan Royals (RR) suffered a five-wicket defeat against Punjab Kings (PBKS) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024, Mike Hesson , the former Director of Cricket and Coach for Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), didn't mince words in his assessment. He criticised RR's performance, suggesting they need to revisit the fundamentals of their game.In the ongoing IPL 2024 season, RR has been struggling, having lost four consecutive matches.Despite starting strong with eight wins out of thirteen matches, their recent form has raised concerns.With a total of 16 points, they currently occupy the second spot, but their recent string of losses has cast doubts on their ability to maintain their position.Hesson's comments likely reflect the frustration of watching a team with potential underperforming. Going back to basics often implies focusing on fundamental skills, strategies, and team dynamics, which might have been neglected amidst their recent struggles.RR may need to regroup, analyze their weaknesses, and make necessary adjustments to regain their winning momentum in the IPL.Speaking to Jio Cinema, Hesson said the same thing is happening for the Royals every year where they lose form at the end of the tournament.""It has happened every year. Every year when we are seven or eight games through, we are like, 'RR are the team to beat!' Every year for the last three years, they have got to that point and all of a sudden, they have gotten quite funky. They lose one, have a bit of a confidence drop, lose a couple, then they start to look over their shoulder and overthink things. I think that's the issue at the moment. They just need to go back to the basics and go back to everyone doing their job and standing up,"" Hesson was quoted in a release from Jio Cinema as saying.In the match, RR won the toss and opted to bat first. However, RR faced early setbacks, losing wickets at regular intervals. Despite this, contributions from Riyan Parag , who scored 48 runs off 34 balls, embellished with six fours, and Ravichandran Ashwin 's knock of 28 runs off 19 balls, including two fours and a six, propelled RR to a total of 144/9 in their allotted 20 overs.PBKS's bowling attack, led by skipper Sam Curran with figures of 2/24, supported by Rahul Chahar (2/26) and Harshal Patel (2/28), kept the RR batsmen in check and restricted their scoring opportunities.In the chase, PBKS found themselves struggling at 48/4 initially. However, a resilient half-century from skipper Sam Curran, who remained unbeaten on 63 runs off 41 balls, comprising five fours and three sixes, turned the tide in PBKS's favor. With contributions from Curran and other batsmen, PBKS secured a crucial five-wicket victory with seven balls to spare.Avesh Khan emerged as the top bowler for RR, returning figures of 2/26.

The unexpected outcome pushed SRH into the playoffs, while simultaneously eliminating the Delhi Capitals (DC) from contention.The spotlight now shifts to the Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) clash on Saturday, which has morphed into a high-stakes knockout game.The equation is simple yet daunting for the RCB: to secure a victory by a margin of 18 runs or chase down a target (assuming a first innings score of 200) within 18.1 overs. This scenario sets the stage for an electrifying contest, with both teams desperate to extend their campaign.Meanwhile, the Rajasthan Royals (RR) have their destiny in their own hands. A win against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) will not only seal their playoff berth but also ensure a second-place finish, granting them two shots at reaching the final.

'Really hope he gets the send-off he deserves at Lord's': Former England skipper Andrew Strauss on James Anderson,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/really-hope-he-gets-the-send-off-he-deserves-at-lords-former-england-skipper-andrew-strauss-on-james-anderson/articleshow/110186290.cms,"(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Andrew Strauss , former England captain and batsman, has praised his former teammate and pace stalwart James Anderson as ""one of the great bowlers of all time."" However, Strauss also emphasised the importance of planning for the future of England's bowling attack beyond Anderson's retirement.Anderson, England's leading pace bowler, is poised to retire from international cricket following an illustrious 22-year career.The 41-year-old, renowned for his exceptional fitness and pace despite his age, took to Instagram last week to announce that the upcoming Test match against West Indies on July 10 will be his final appearance in international cricket.Speaking about Anderson's retirement, Strauss was quoted as saying by ESPNCricinfo.""I really hope he gets the send-off he deserves at Lord's. People have been talking about this moment for years - in a way, we got lured into thinking it was never going to come. It has been an extraordinary career with extraordinary resilience and will to keep going. Playing sports at the highest level is not an easy thing, and bowling is even harder. He is one of the great bowlers of all time,"" said Strauss.Anderson played a crucial role in the England team's ascent to the number one position in the ICC Test Rankings during the early 2010s under the leadership of Strauss.Notably, Anderson was the leading wicket-taker in the 2010-11 Ashes series , which marked England's most recent victory in Australia. Additionally, he showcased his prowess by taking 21 wickets in four Tests against India the following summer, further solidifying his status as one of England's premier fast bowlers of all time.Recalling Anderson's fine run, Strauss said that he was ""utterly dependable"". He also lauded the bowler for rarely getting injured and expressed wonder how he himself made his debut after Anderson and retired before him too.""He was one of those bowlers that you knew what you were going to get, every time. He had a great competitive fire and instinct, and extraordinary skill. Any captain would love to have him in their team. The other thing is that he kept fit: he never - or at least, very rarely - got injured. It's quite depressing to think that he made his England debut before I did. I have been retired for 12 years now,"" he added.Strauss said that England has some certain number of fixtures, around 18 till the next Ashes series in Australia in 2025-26 and Anderson himself would admit that it would be a stretch if he plays the next Ashes series. He also said that it would be hard to replace Anderson and his partner-in-pace, Broad, who retired last year.""It is the right time to get some games into some new players and obviously a huge hole to fill. If you think about [Stuart] Broad going last summer and now Anderson, it is very hard to replace them overnight,"" said Strauss.""They were both utterly dependable and were senior bowlers, so you need to invest time and effort, and other people need to step up and take those leadership roles. So I think it is the right time. Often, you do not fully appreciate what you have lost until it is gone - but there has to be life after James Anderson,"" he concluded.","James Anderson is set to retire from international cricket after 22-year career.

'This is not the time to be flat': Shane Watson warns Rajasthan Royals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/this-is-not-the-time-to-be-flat-shane-watson-warns-rajasthan-royals/articleshow/110186126.cms,"(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Former Australian all-rounder Shane Watson criticized Rajasthan Royals for their lack of fight during their loss to Punjab Kings in the Indian Premier League game. He emphasized that this is not the time for the franchise to be ""flat"" but rather to focus on delivering strong performances and building confidence ahead of the playoffs.Despite securing a playoff spot, RR faced a further decline in momentum with a defeat against PBKS in Guwahati on Wednesday.PBKS' excellent bowling performance and a resilient half-century by skipper Sam Curran led to a five-wicket loss for RR.This defeat marks RR's fourth consecutive loss, leaving them in second place with eight wins and five losses, totaling 16 points. Meanwhile, PBKS is currently in ninth place with five wins, eight losses, and 10 points.Speaking to JioCinema after the game, Watson expressed surprise at how RR began the season strongly, peaking early and maintaining a solid performance through the middle of the tournament without any apparent weaknesses in the team. However, he noted that the team has since lost momentum, as evidenced by their lack of fight against Punjab.""I have been very surprised with how the Rajasthan Royals have taken off. They were flying high with no weaknesses in their team. They were able to just mix and match when they really needed to. They have certainly lost momentum and tonight, it seemed no one was up for the fight. Sanju Samson is the captain, he is willing everyone to be up for the fight. Avesh Khan, Riyan Parag did a job, but outside of them, everyone looked flat. This is not the time to be flat. They need to get a few good performances under them and build their confidence to hit the playoffs flying. They are going in the other direction. For the Rajasthan Royals fans and players, that's not what they want,"" he said.Notably, Watson himself played for Rajasthan Royals from 2008-15 and was a part of the title-winning team in the inaugural season back in 2008. In 78 matches for RR, he scored 2,372 runs at an average of 36.49 with a strike rate of 141.27, with two centuries and 14 fifties. His best score was 104*. He also took 61 wickets for the team.Coming to the match, Rajasthan won the toss and elected to bat first. RR lost their wickets regularly. Knocks from Riyan Parag (48) and Ravichandran Ashwin (28) took RR to 144/9 in their 20 overs.Skipper Sam Curran (2/24), Rahul Chahar (2/26) and Harshal Patel (2/28) were among the top bowlers for PBKS.In the run-chase, PBKS was 48/4 at one point, but half-century from skipper Sam Curran (63*) helped the team secure a five-wicket win with seven balls left. Avesh Khan (2/26) was the top bowler for RR.","Former Australian all-rounder Shane Watson criticized Rajasthan Royals for their lack of fight during their loss to Punjab Kings.

'They have to figure out the middle order': Varun Aaron after RR's fourth consecutive loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/they-have-to-figure-out-the-middle-order-varun-aaron-after-rrs-fourth-consecutive-loss/articleshow/110185932.cms,"(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Varun Aaron , former right-arm seamer, offered some advice to the Rajasthan Royals (RR) following their recent struggles in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024.After RR suffered their fourth consecutive loss against the Punjab Kings at the Barsapara Cricket Stadium in Guwahati, Aaron highlighted the need for the Royals to address their middle-order issues, especially during crucial stages of the game.Despite already securing a spot in the playoffs, RR's momentum has taken a hit with their recent string of losses. In their IPL 2024 fixture against PBKS, RR faced a defeat despite a commendable bowling performance, with PBKS skipper Sam Curran's fighting half-century leading them to a five-wicket victory.Currently, RR hold the second position with eight wins and five losses, totaling 16 points. Meanwhile, PBKS sit in the ninth spot with five wins, eight losses, and 10 points.Aaron's advice suggests that RR need to rectify their middle-order batting issues to regain their winning form as they head into the crucial playoff stages of the tournament.""I thought it is a blip and they would pick it up but now it is a worry. They should be worried, they have to figure out the middle order. In the pressure games, the middle order has to come to the fore and deliver. So they have to be worried especially of the middle order,"" Varun Aaron said on ESPNcricinfo TimeOut.In addition to the challenging playing surface, the Rajasthan Royals' sub-par total can be attributed to their struggling middle and lower-middle order. Since the beginning of May, RR's batsmen occupying positions 5 to 8 have averaged just 12.46 with the bat, which is the lowest among all teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL).The team has experimented with seven different players in these crucial positions, second only to the Chennai Super Kings, who have used eight players.Unfortunately, the absence of a settled combination in the middle and lower-middle order, exacerbated by Shimron Hetmyer 's injury and varied team tactics, has resulted in inconsistent performances for RR.These statistics underscore the importance of stability and reliability in the middle and lower order, and RR will need to address this issue promptly to regain their form and momentum as they progress further in the tournament.","Varun Aaron says Rajasthan Royals (RR) need to address their middle-order issues.
