3 Reasons why Brock Lesnar might return at the Netflix Premier of WWE RAW,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/3-reasons-why-brock-lesnar-might-return-at-the-netflix-premier-of-wwe-raw/articleshow/116505411.cms,"Is Brock Lesnar coming back? Image Credits-WWE.com

1. On

Paul Heyman

‚Äôs request

2. To avenge his defeat against Roman Reigns

3. To challenge Gunther

Netflix and WWE have joined hands and the first episode of WWE RAW on Netflix is going to air on 6th of January next year. Some mouthwatering contests and earth shattering surprises are in store for the WWE Universe and fans across the world, and one such shocking surprise could be the return of a yesteryear legend. Someone who has been equally successful and dangerous in his career, instilling fear in the eyes of his opponents, every time he entered the ring. Yes, you guessed it right. The ‚ÄúBeast Incarnate‚Äù Brock Lesnar might return at the Netflix Premiere of WWE RAW, if indeed WWE plans to take the breath of their fans away, during its Netflix debut.Here are three reasons whyAmong the many Paul Heyman guys, the Beast Incarnate Brock Lesnar has been the most prominent and successful one. The ten time WWE World Champion was a Paul Heyman loyalist until Heyman betrayed him to side with the ‚ÄúTribal Chief‚Äù Roman Reigns, back in 2022. But knowing Brock, if Heyman needs him at any point of time, say during the ‚ÄúTribal Combat‚Äù, when Roman Reigns is surrounded by the members of the new Bloodline and Solo Sikoa, Heyman can surely count on his old friend, and Brock wouldn‚Äôt deny him. Just like he did before the Survivor Series ‚ÄúWarGames‚Äù match, Heyman might again want to help his ‚ÄúOTC‚Äù against the Bloodline 2.0, during the Tribal Combat on the Netflix Premiere of RAW.While Lesnar was a Paul Heyman loyalist and could come back on Heyman‚Äôs request, we all know the scary nature of the Beast Incarnate. If he wants something, he would stop at nothing before capturing it and he does what he wants to do, without caring about anyone else in the world. Back in 2022, Brock was humiliated by Roman Reigns, the ‚ÄúOG‚Äù Bloodline and Paul Heyman and was defeated in the Last Man Standing match at SummerSlam. If he has revenge in his mind, he might come back to disturb Roman in his match against Solo Sikoa, which is popularly being called the ‚ÄúTribal Combat‚Äù on the Netflix‚Äô Premiere of RAW. If indeed Brock shows up on 6th of January, the roof would be brought down and the whole world would be shocked.Ever since Brock has left the WWE due to the sexual lawsuit levied on him and Vince McMahon by Janel Grant, the WWE Universe and fans across the world have dearly missed the burly country boy. Among the many matches that WWE fans wish for to take place in WWE, the most anticipated contest has been the Gunther versus Brock Lesnar match. It is one match that most of the fans would love to see and if indeed WWE manages to bring Brock back to WWE, this bout should be their number one priority. The ‚ÄúRing General‚Äù vs the Beast Incarnate, for the World Heavyweight Championship would be a blockbuster, going into WrestleMania 41.","Netflix and WWE have joined hands and the first episode of WWE RAW on Netflix is going to air on 6th of January next year.

Will Taylor Swift Cheer for Travis Kelce in the Texans Game?



The Kansas City Chiefs face the Houston Texans in Week 16 with the strong intention of continuing their winning streak. In addition to winning the AFC West title and qualifying for the playoffs, the Chiefs are now ready to secure the hotly contested No. 1 seed. This game carries extra importance for Kansas City because of an arduous march ahead, including three games within eleven days. Now, the bigger question in fans' minds is whether Taylor Swift will come to cheer for her boyfriend Travis Kelce for the game?The Chiefs will take on the Texans on Saturday, Dec. 21, at GEHA Field, following a decisive 21-7 win against the Cleveland Browns. After that, the Christmas Day face-off with the Pittsburgh Steelers at Acrisure Stadium will complete their regular-season home games against the Denver Broncos. However, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce plows on despite the tough schedule.""I‚Äôll play whenever, wherever,"" Kelce remarked on his ""New Heights"" podcast. ""I just know that I‚Äôm so fortunate to be able to play this game that I‚Äôm gonna cherish every time I get to play on this field.‚ÄùAlso making an addition to the excitement for this match is Taylor Swift, Kelce's girlfriend, and whether or not she will show up for the game. The presence of Swift, who has been spotted frequently at all Chiefs games this season, has seemed to add fuel to the fire in a blaze that her fervent support for Kelce has ignited through much media speculation and across sports and entertainment.While her appearances have met with moments of glory and accolades on the field, there is still no confirmation if Swift will attend Saturday's game. Fans have speculated as to whether she will be there to watch since this is Kansas City's last regular-season home game. Swift has just completed her record-breaking Eras World Tour and held an impromptu celebration for Kelce to mark the occasion.Swift's visits along with Brittany Mahomes, wife of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, have only added fuel to the fire of her association with the NFL. But given that Texans are on the road for this game, it may not be possible for her to join the team. According to a source who spoke to US Magazine, Swift's plans include visiting both her family as well as Kelce's this Christmas and having a ""very quiet New Year,"" leading to speculation about her whereabouts in the next few weeks.Also Read: Taylor Swift‚Äôs Eras Tour Party: Has Travis Kelce Completely Changed Her World?

Hurts Did Not Confirm Whether He Will Change His Shoes Before Facing The Commanders



Over the weekend, Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts ran afoul of the NFL rulebook with his choice of playing shoes. The NFL fined the Eagles QB $5,628 for violating the league‚Äôs uniform and equipment rules in Sunday‚Äôs win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, as per reports. Officially, Hurts‚Äô fine was for wearing a shoe colour that‚Äôs not one of the Eagles‚Äô ‚ÄúConstitutional team colours‚Äù.On Sunday‚Äôs match, Hurts completed 25-of-32 passing for 290 yards with two touchdowns through the air and another 45 yards and a touchdown on the ground.

However, he said that the fracture does affect his performance as a runner. ""I think about the run, I know for sure, I don't have my ball on the inside arm, I have it on the outside arm. If I felt comfortable doing it...but I'm not at that stage, so it's a game of adjustments and finding a way,"" Hurts explained.""It's on the up and up,"" Hurts said, adding, ""Breaks don't heal in a day.""Hurts also spoke about his stellar performance in the match and broke down some aspects for the fans. ""It was a team effort. I think the reality is, just because we don't [pass the ball] doesn't mean we can't,"" he said.

‚Äôs status for tonight‚Äôs match between theand the Cleveland Cavaliers is not going to make the Bucks fans happy. The Milwaukee Bucks had a profitable trip to Las Vegas, both on and off the court.

This win made them only the second team to claim the title, following LeBron James and the Lakers. Each Bucks player walked away $500,000 richer thanks to the win.

This is a significant blow to Milwaukee‚Äôs chances, as Cleveland currently boasts the best record in the league.according to the NBA‚Äôs official injury report.Lillard‚Äôs absence is a concern for the Bucks, but they‚Äôve shown they can manage without him. In the three games he‚Äôs missed this season, Milwaukee has posted a 2-1 record. However, those wins came against the Toronto Raptors and Detroit Pistons. These two teams are currently not regarded as top-tier contenders.The timing of Lillard‚Äôs injury is unfortunate, as he‚Äôs been in excellent form since recovering from a concussion that caused him to miss three games in mid-November. In his last 12 appearances, Lillard averaged 25.5 points on 45.5% shooting, alongside 8.3 assists, 4.4 rebounds, and 1.1 steals. The Bucks‚Äô fortunes shifted significantly during that stretch, with the team going 10-2 and climbing to fifth place in the Eastern Conference standings.With Lillard out, all eyes will be on Giannis Antetokounmpo. The two-time MVP has been nothing short of dominant lately, and his leadership has been a key factor that led the Milwaukee Bucks to their championship victory. After starting the season 2-8, there were rumors about potential roster changes and even the possibility of trading Antetokounmpo. But the Greek Freak stayed the course and took matters into his own hands. Over his last 14 games, he‚Äôs averaged an eye-popping 33.4 points, 10.6 rebounds, 6.7 assists, and 2 blocks per game.

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

Rohit Sharma press conference: On Ashwin, Gabba draw and his form

NEW DELHI: Ravichandran Ashwin 's wife Prithi Narayanan shared an emotional tribute on Friday following the cricketer's retirement. The accomplished Indian spinner made an unexpected retirement announcement post the Brisbane Test and promptly returned to Chennai, creating a significant void in Indian cricket.In his final appearance at the Adelaide Test, Ashwin managed to secure only a single wicket during India's substantial 10-wicket loss.""It has been a blurry two days for me. I have been thinking about what I can say.. Do I put this down as a tribute to my all time favorite cricketer ? Maybe I'll just take the partner angle? Or maybe a love letter from a fan girl? I guess this is a little bit of all of it.""When I saw Ashwins PC, I thought of small and big moments. Many many memories over the last 13-14 years. The big wins , the MOS awards, the quiet silence in our room after an intense game, the sound of the shower running for much longer than usual on some evenings post play , the scratch of pencil over paper as he scribbled thoughts down, the constant streaming of footage videos when he is making a game plan, the calm of meditative breathing before leaving for each game, certain songs playing on repeat while he unwinds.. The times we weeped in joy - after the CT final, after the MCG win, after the Sydney draw, The Gabba win, after making a comeback in T20s‚Ä¶the times we sat in silence and the times when we had our hearts broken.""Dear Ashwin, from not knowing how to put a kit bag together to following you to stadiums all over the world, rooting for you, watching you and learning from you, it has been an absolute pleasure. The world you introduced me to gave me the privilege to watch and enjoy a sport that I love from close quarters. It also showed me how much passion, hardwork and discipline is needed to keep your head above water. And sometimes even that is not enough.""I remember us talking about why you, R Ashwin, had to do all of this and a lot more to even stay relevant in the scheme of things. How awards, the best of stats, the POMs, the accolades, the records didn't matter if you didn't sharpen your skill sets constantly and did not put in the work. Sometimes, nothing is enough. As you end your wonderful international run, I only want to tell you that it's all good.It is all going to be good.It is time to set the burden of being you down. Live life on your terms, make space for those extra calories, make time for your family, make time to do absolutely nothing, share memes all day, create a new bowling variation, bug our kids out of their minds. Just do it all,""Ashwin finished his international career with 765 scalps across formats, the second-highest for India, only behind Anil Kumble (953). His tally of 537 wickets for India in Test cricket is also second only to Anil Kumble (619).","Ravichandran Ashwin's wife Prithi Narayanan pays tribute to her all-time favorite cricketer.

Birthday Bash Photos Stir Engagement Rumors with Travis Kelce",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/did-taylor-swift-just-say-yes-birthday-bash-photos-stir-engagement-rumors-with-travis-kelce/articleshow/116514989.cms,"Elle

Swifties spot the ""blurred"" truth



Engagement or Just a ""Reputation"" Moment?



Does this represent Taylor's authentic ""Love Story""?



Taylor Swift has once again left the internet spiraling, but this time, it's not about another record-smashing album or chart-topping single. The buzz? Swifties are convinced their queen is now engaged to Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce, thanks to one ""mysterious"" detail spotted in her recent birthday party photos.The celebration, marking Taylor's 35th, wasn't any mere casual soir√©e. Held at her football-playing beau's behest, the bash was dripping in opulence, with a reported $175,000 spent on gifts and flowers alone. (Let's be real, when your boyfriend's an NFL superstar and your own tour grosses over $2 billion, that's practically chump change.) But it wasn't the glitz and the glamour or even the guest list that read like the Who's Who of the industry that stole the limelight‚Äîit was Taylor's left hand.Eagle-eyed fans dug deep into snaps shared by Brittany Mahomes, wife of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, from the event. In one of the snaps, Taylor was spotted sipping a cocktail, posing with Lyndsay Bell and her BFF Ashley Avignone. Sounds innocent, doesn't it? Not when your fan base has Sherlock Holmes-level dedication.Some photos, they claim, show her left ring finger looking oddly. blurred. Cue the internet frenzy. The reigning theory? Taylor might have asked for an engagement ring to be ‚Äúedited out‚Äù of the pictures, sparking speculation that the pop sensation and the NFL champ are keeping their big news under wraps‚Äîfor now.""Blurred finger or blurred lines? Either way, she's keeping us guessing!"" quipped one fan on social media, capturing the general mood of Swifties everywhere.Now, before you begin mailing congratulatory cards, let's keep in mind Swift's streak of mystification. Can't the blur be coincidental? Taylor, remember, isn't exactly bashful in her Easter eggs and made moments that leave everyone playing guesswork and purchasing their merchandise.Of course, there's also the guy, Kelce-the machine that is currently laser-tunnel-visioned-in on the Chiefs' terrific 13-1 win-loss record and preparing his squad for the Houston Texans' game. The star football player might be no stranger to rings (with the Super Bowl wins notarized), but the Internet is having a panic with this one.If these rumors are true, then this could be the fairy-tale chapter in Taylor's very own ""Love Story,"" where Kelce plays the role of her knight in shining armor. However, knowing Taylor, she'll keep the big reveal for the least expected moment‚Äîand, of course, in a way that breaks the internet (again).Meanwhile, Taylor is out here, living her best life as the fans zoom in and dissect every pixel of every photo. It might be a blurry ring, it might be a strategic move, or just another reason for Swifties to theorize - but one thing is certain: Taylor Swift knows how to keep the world talking.Also read - When Taylor Swift thought it was a ""quiet dinner"", Travis Kelce surprised her with an unforgettable Eras-themed 35th birthday party","Swifties are convinced their queen is now engaged to Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce.

NEW DELHI: Five-time world chess champion and current world number one Magnus Carlsen has expressed his views on the classical chess format, claiming that the faster form of the game is ""pure sport"".He believes that classical chess is not the best way to determine the strongest player because it is ""too forgiving"" and allows players to mask deficiencies in their game.Carlsen argues that faster chess formats , such as rapid and blitz, require a more well-rounded game and better overall skills. He considers these formats to be more representative of a ""pure sport,"" while longer forms of chess, like classical, become more akin to ""science"" and ""art.""‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to say exactly what measures the best player overall. I would say that right now, if you want the kind of chess in which you need the most well-rounded game, classical chess is probably the worst way because it‚Äôs sort of too forgiving. It‚Äôs too easy to mask the deficiencies in your game. And I think if you‚Äôre able to handle both faster chess and freestyle, you have covered a lot of bases. You do have your basic pattern, and quick tactics,"" Carlsen told the Take Take Take podcast. ‚ÄúFaster chess, it is a sport. It‚Äôs sort of a pure sport kind of thing. But when you get to longer forms of freestyle, it becomes like more science, art.‚ÄùThe Norwegian GM recently criticised the quality of the 2024 World Chess Championship match between India's D Gukesh and China's Ding Liren , which Gukesh won with a 7.5-6.5 margin.Carlsen felt that the level of play did not meet the expectations of a World Championship match.‚ÄúThis does not look like a game between two World Championship contenders. It just looks like maybe the second round or third round of an open tournament. It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs the stage where you play somebody who is like decent with openings but then you just win with class,‚Äù he had earlier said.Despite not defending his title in 2023, Carlsen had previously won the 2021 World Chess Championship by defeating Ian Nepomniachtchi.Ding Liren, who finished second in the 2022 Candidates tournament, went on to face Nepomniachtchi and emerged victorious on tiebreaks to become the defending champion.Gukesh, who became the youngest-ever world chess champion, acknowledged Carlsen's superiority, stating that becoming the world champion does not make him the best player, and that Carlsen still holds that distinction.‚ÄúBecoming the world champion does not mean I am the best player, obviously that is Magnus,‚Äù Gukesh said at the post-match press conference in Singapore.","Five-time world chess champion Magnus Carlsen has expressed his views on the classical chess format.

Jimmy Butler trade rumor: The Suns are reportedly eying on the Heat star



The Phoenix Suns are reportedly eyeing Miami Heat star Jimmy Butler as the third cog to join Kevin Durant and Devin Booker . The current rumors say that the Suns have a timeline for bringing Butler on board to increase their chance of winning a championship. Durant and Booker have been one of the best duos in the league and on top of that, if added, Butler in the team would bring yet another advantage to the team. It appears that the Suns are going all-in to build a powerhouse that will compete for that highest level in the NBA.Rumors have linked the Phoenix Suns to a possible trade for All-Star forward Jimmy Butler, sparking plenty of conversation among fans and analysts. Although Butler‚Äôs agent, Bernie Lee, has dismissed the speculation, the chatter hasn‚Äôt completely died down.On Friday, radio host John Gambadoro shed some light on the Suns' potential timeline for making a move. Some believe Phoenix might consider acquiring Butler with an eye on letting him leave in free agency, which could ease the team‚Äôs financial burdens as they plan for the future. The situation remains one to watch.""There is not a scenario in which the Suns would trade for Jimmy Butler and not resign him,"" Arizona Sports' Gambadoro wrote on X.Gambadoro‚Äôs comment on the matter follows a report from ESPN's NBA insider Brian Windhorst, who confirmed that Phoenix's interest in acquiring Butler is genuine.""And by the way, I know the Suns have interest in Jimmy Butler. This is not a controversial statement. It is not some sort of secrecy. Jimmy would like $100 million, and I think the Suns might give it to him. There's only three players that the Suns can trade for Jimmy Butler. Kevin Durant, Bradley. Beal and Devin Booker. That's it. That's the player [Beal] that you'd want to trade in a vacuum,"" Windhorst said.Now, adding fuel to the discussion, the National NBA reporter for Forbes shared on X that the Suns are putting a hold on the decision to purchase Butler, at least, till mid-January. ""The Suns are going to wait until mid-January before deciding on whether to further pursue Jimmy Butler, per @Gambo987,"" Evan Sidery wrote on X. While he has reported Gambadoro‚Äôs message, the rumor has gained a lot of traction on social media.""Phoenix is tied for 8th in the Western Conference standings, but they want to see how their roster further jells together before making an aggressive trade,"" Sidery added.Also Read: Miami Heat ""open to listen to trade offers"" for Jimmy Butler; Golden State Warriors, Houston Rockets, and Dallas Mavericks are potential destinations It remains to be seen if the 35-year-old forward ends up in the Suns alongside Durant and co. But certainly, the discussion revolving around the star‚Äôs trade has been a subject of discussion among fans and NBA analysts alike.Butler is currently averaging 19 points, 6.1 rebounds, and 5.0 assists.","The Phoenix Suns are reportedly eyeing Miami Heat star Jimmy Butler as the third cog to join Kevin Durant and Devin Booker.

Milwaukee Bucks vs Cleveland Cavaliers

: Game summary

On Friday night, the Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks with a convincing score of 124-101. Star guard Donovan Mitchell led the game and shot 27 points for his team. The Cavs well exhibited all the depth and team chemistry they have. The Bucks, fresh out of winning the NBA Cup, did their best, and yet, could not survive any of the balanced attack and defense the Cavaliers brought onto the court. Although the Cavs failed to secure the NBA Cup this year, they are still very dominant in the league.The Cleveland Cavaliers put on their sharpest display on Friday when they devoured the Milwaukee Bucks: 124-101. The Bucks still had the taste of their NBA Cup victory in Las Vegas just a few days earlier but fell short on claiming the win against the dominant team. Cleveland's defense, especially toward Giannis Antetokounmpo, contributed to their success. While Antetokounmpo racked up a total of 33 points against them, the frontcourt trio of Dean Wade, Evan Mobley, and Jarrett Allen made Antetokounmpo work for every single basket he made against them. The pressure also kept Bucks to only 23 three-point attempts even though they had pulled their starters early in the fourth quarter.No less than that, the Cavs' shooting was the game-changer in the game. They managed to shoot 48.7% from three-point range, finishing at 19-39 three-pointers. Leading from the front was Donovan Mitchell, who had 27 points and 6 assists, all in 27 minutes. With 16 points and 5 assists to boot, Darius Garland also pitched in. Left with 15 points to show for his night's work as well as a blemished defensive effort against Antetokounmpo was Mobley. Dean Wade added 15 points.Also Read: NBA News Roundup: Warriors' blockbuster trade, NBA Cup champions, new All-Star Game format and more Max Strus made his season debut and was a little bit shaky at first but did rally up in the second half to finish with 9 points on 3-8 shooting. Overall, a solid and efficient game by the Cavs early on as they all took control of the game which proved to be too much for the NBA Champions.","Milwaukee Bucks vs Cleveland Cavaliers: Box Score, player stats.

NAVI MUMBAI: At a time when Smriti Mandhana has been in sensational form, laying claim for the best batter in the world in the women's game, India can consider themselves blessed to have found an ideal finisher in Richa Ghosh .On Thursday night at the DY Patil Stadium , Ghosh, giving the 47,204-capacity crowd plenty to cheer, smashed a world record-equalling fastest 50, reaching the milestone in just 18 balls while sending the hapless West Indies bowlers to the cleaners.The 21-year-old, who blasted 54 off 21 balls, including five sixes and three fours, joined an exclusive club that features New Zealand's Sophie Devine and Australia's Phoebe Litchfield.

Ghosh said she always has had the mindset to play attacking cricket and got inspired to play the big shots watching her father Manabendra Ghosh, a former cricketer who is also her coach.""The mindset to play aggressively is there in every game which comes from practice sessions. If we have done something in practice, it feels easier to do to it in a match. I had prepared in that manner and that helped me. I have always loved power-hitting. I have also seen my father hit big shots. I have worked hard on my fitness and in the practice sessions,"" Ghosh told reporters after her knock.She also credited her chats with renowned big hitters of the women's game like Devine and West Indies' allrounder Deandra Dottin and Indian women's team captain Harmanpreet Kaur for improving her hitting ability.","Richa Ghosh equals world record for fastest 50 in T20Is.

MUMBAI: The Mumbai Cricket Association is trying to revive the career of Prithvi Shaw , who was dropped by the Mumbai selectors from the squad for the first three matches of the Vijay Hazare Trophy .After a number of years during which he was playing international cricket, in the IPL and for Mumbai, the 25-year-old will feature in a local cricket tournament when he will lead the Mumbai Colts team in the Police Shield , which involves two-day matches at various venues around the city.""Shaw has been asked by Mumbai's senior selection committee chairman Sanjay Patil to play for the Mumbai Colts team in the Police Shield, which is starting from today. While he isn't available for the first match on Saturday, Shaw has agreed to play in the Police Shield from next Saturday.

Even though he was not part of the Ranji Trophy, I think the association took care of his practice, his fitness. There were routines given to him for the three weeks to be followed. I think that was pretty much taken care of by the association and the coaches from the academy. We were all very involved in it. And I think he came over there, he took that effort, he did his hard yards over there,"" Salvi had said.""And then he came over here in this format, from those preparations.

Micah Parsons Values Cowboys' Title Aspirations Over Market-Setting Contract Demands



Micah Parsons , the star pass rusher for the Dallas Cowboys , is now all set to look forward and entrench himself into the franchise's future. In a proactive measure, Parsons has voiced his understanding for a long-term extension before the window opens in March 2025. Parsons' stance is somewhat of a departure from how the team approached big deals with Dak Prescott and CeeDee Lamb : both contracts were signed just ahead of the 2024 campaign. Parsons has, at times, made headlines for speaking out against some of the things he thinks do not align with the goals of the team. Yet, it is a sign now that he is maturing in his role as leader and indeed is taking steps towards becoming part of the leadership flair that the Cowboys are looking for.Though speculation continues to circulate around his future, Micah Parsons on Thursday made it clear that he isn't seeking a contract squabble with the Dallas Cowboys and expects something to be done in time for training camp.Speaking to reporters, the two-time first-team All-Pro defensive end said that he would not look into a holdout scenario should the absence of a contract extension run into next season. Otherwise, he is eager to look at being fully prepared for the upcoming season, which, in his expectations, would include being present at camp.""I definitely think I need to be here in camp because, honestly, when so much of the defense is surrounded by your play and your presence, and others are getting lined up based off of you, I need to be here so that way I can get these guys accordingly,"" said Parsons, via the Cowboys' website. ""We can rush together, build that chemistry.""So I think it's of extreme importance that I'm back at OTAs, minicamp.""Parsons went further while explaining that when it comes time to sit at the table for a new deal, he isn't looking to break the bank. He knows the value in taking a little less than expected to help the Cowboys field a contender.""It would just be nice to be surrounded by good players, you know what I mean?"" Parsons said. ""Players that are going to help you win championships. To me, having $40 million and being chipped every play and slid two with three, four people ‚Äî I don't think that sounds too fun. So, to me, it's about people that can keep making a difference and, obviously, we're going to get Sam [Williams] back; and we're going get some of [others] back.""We'll see how it breaks down, but I want to keep as many guys as possible, however they're going to make the cap work.""The rookie deal currently held by Parsons will run out in the 2025 season after the Cowboys exercised their fifth-year option, and it will ultimately pay him something like just over $21 million, according to Spotrac. That means that by 2026, he could be an unrestricted free agent or could get the franchise tag for up to three additional seasons.""I don't need $40 million per year,"" Parsons said. ""I need to be somewhere where I can have a lake house.""Deadlines drive actions; it may not be holding the Cowboys to that time frame, but at least it lends urgency to both sides when the season finally ends. One final dash to get a deal that keeps the edge rusher happy.""I think I'm the best player in the world. I don't throw numbers out there like that,"" Parsons said. ""I'll see what they're willing to give me.""Also Read: ‚ÄúDon't draft him‚Äù: Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders has issued a strong message to NFL teams regarding Travis Hunter The very essence of the Dallas Cowboys defense , Micah Parsons, continues to prove that he is not only a top-notch player but even above that.

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

From Schoolmates to Life Partners

Why R Ashwin retirement was a last minute surprise for Ravindra Jadeja

Life in the Spotlight

A Legacy to Cherish

NEW DELHI: Ravichandran Ashwin , one of India's finest cricketers, stunned fans and the cricketing fraternity by announcing his retirement from international cricket following the third Test of the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Brisbane.The ace spinner brought the curtains down on an illustrious 14-year career, finishing as the second most successful Indian bowler with 537 wickets in 106 Tests, including 37 five-wicket hauls. Ashwin also proved his mettle with the bat, scoring six centuries and 3,503 runs at an average of 25.75.In an interview with 7Cricket, Ashwin and his wife, Prithi, shared personal anecdotes about their journey, giving fans a rare glimpse into their lives beyond the cricket field.Prithi spoke about their early connection: ""We kind of knew each other in middle school. We were classmates in school, that‚Äôs it. Nothing more than that.""Ashwin added humorously, ""That was not the era of cell phones, right? You have to call somebody on the landline. Every time I called her on the landline, her father would pick up. So, what are the odds you‚Äôll be in a relationship for such a long time?""Years later, the two reconnected during Ashwin‚Äôs early days in the IPL. ""When you are in the IPL, you end up doing some things. That‚Äôs when I met her for the first time after a long time. Then we started going out,"" Ashwin recalled.He also shared the story of his spontaneous proposal. ""One fine day, I proposed to her at Chemplast Cricket Ground. The intention was not to propose; I was just taking her out,"" he said.Prithi, laughing, described the moment as ‚Äúoff-guard,‚Äù saying, ""It was very early. Drop the bomb very early and kind of see what fell into place.""The couple opened up about the challenges of balancing fame and family life in India. ""Chennai by itself is not a very intrusive, curious crowd. They will not bother you too much,"" Prithi said. ""But it takes a lot of effort to just walk out because then you have to deal with people. You can‚Äôt have a quiet couple of minutes on the road. Go get a coffee and come back - that quietness is something we miss a lot.""Ashwin acknowledged the demands of fame but maintained a positive outlook. ""People love you. The worst thing that could happen? There might be five-six people gather around, and you just need to say, ‚ÄòYes, okay, I will smile and take a picture,‚Äô or ‚ÄòNo, give me some space.‚Äô That‚Äôs it,"" he said.Prithi added how their children sometimes long for normalcy: ""When your children come along, you don‚Äôt want to keep saying no to them all the time. Simple things like walking to the stationery shop, buying a packet of unicorn pencils, and coming back with their daddy - it‚Äôs game-changing for them.""Prithi further added, ""He‚Äôs the kind of guy who wants to keep doing something. He‚Äôs done it from the age of eight, constantly moving. As much as I tease you, you‚Äôve earned this. You‚Äôve sacrificed a lot over time - time with your parents, kids, me. Not so much me, but a little bit,"" she said with a smile.As the couple laughed and reflected on their shared experiences, Ashwin concluded with a grin, ""This doesn‚Äôt look like an interview; it looks like a message for me.""Ashwin‚Äôs retirement marks the end of an era for Indian cricket, but his legacy as a world-class spinner and a role model off the field will live on. With his characteristic humility and humor, Ashwin leaves the game richer than he found it, inspiring fans and aspiring cricketers alike.","Ravichandran Ashwin announced his retirement from international cricket.

LIVE: R Ashwin retires: Is India‚Äôs spin future in safe hands? | India vs Australia

NEW DELHI: Tributes have been flowing in ever since star Indian allrounder Ravichandran Ashwin announced his retirement from international cricket.Ashwin made the announcement on Wednesday at a hastily-called media conference following the drawn Test between Australia and India at the Gabba in Brisbane for the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy .Ashwin played 106 Tests for India since his 2011 debut, taking 537 wickets. He took more wickets against Australia than any other country, with 115 at 28.58 in 23 Tests against them.On Friday, the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) shared a heartfelt tribute to Ashwin who finished seventh on the all-time list for most wickets and second only to Anil Kumble (619) for India.The video shows Ashwin taking his first wicket in Test cricket and goes through with the spinner grabbing his 200th, 300th, 400th and 500th Test wickets apart from also reaching one of his six Test hundreds.Ashwin says in the video, ""Look I don't know here to begin honestly, I think I made myself a promise in 2012, we lost a series against England, a tricky one, it was very early in my career and I was just telling myself we are not going to lose another one. Ever. And that's what I promised myself.""Ashwin, the only Indian allrounder to score 3000 runs and take 500 wickets, formed a deadly combination with Ravindra Jadeja which was the cornerstone of India's decade-long Test domination at home. The duo became a nightmare for visiting teams on the turning tracks in India.A clip from 2016 has Ashwin saying, ""All I would like to do is to enjoy my game here, my name is announced to come out to bowl or bat, the way the crowd will erupt is something I really look forward to.""Ashwin ceased to be a regular feature in the Test XI overseas but ended with 154 away wickets.A clip from 2019 has Ashwin saying, ""I believe I need to keep improving as a cricketer. It's been a magical season and it's going to be pretty difficult to replicate this again.""Ashwin was more than a handy batter, scoring 3,503 runs with six centuries and 14 fifties.Cut to 2021 and Ashwin says, ""It's been a sort of a dreamy ride, it's been a fairytale I must say.""India's 12-year home supremacy and their 2020-21 Border-Gavaskar Trophy victory in Australia were both greatly aided by Ashwin.A clip from 2021 has Ashwin saying, ""How many ever wickets you take, how many ever runs you make, in ten years time you won't remember them, it's the memories that matters.""Ashwin shares the record for 11 Player-of-the-Series accolades with the legendary Muttiah Muralitharan of Sri Lanka and is one of only 11 all-rounders with 3000 Test runs and 300 wickets.Ashwin continues in the video, ""But if somebody had told me in 2011 that I would be getting so many wickets, I'd be retiring on 2024 December, the 18th, I wouldn't have believed them because I knew that this is the game that I love but I never did expect that I would get so much so love, so many wickets and so many runs as well. I'm very glad, deep sense of gratitude for everyone that supported me, everyone that's challenged me. So happy today. Thank you.""Ashwin also played 116 one-day and 65 Twenty20 internationals and was a part of the sides that won the ODI World Cup in 2011 and the Champions Trophy in 2013.","Ashwin played 106 Tests for India since his 2011 debut, taking 537 wickets.

Stadium Walkthrough series: Inside The Gabba

NEW DELHI: There's no denying the fact that the Aussies are in awe of India pace spearhead and vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah With 21 scalps from 3 Tests in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy , Bumrah is the top wicket-taker in the series against Australia.Talking to TOI, former Australia captain Allan Border expressed his admiration of Bumrah and his rare art.""Bumrah, these days, is on that pedestal. His wrists, his release points are different to other bowlers. Because of that hyperextension, he's releasing the ball a foot further down than other bowlers. He's got a unique shuffling run-up, and then the snap of these wrists, he's amazing. Being different, plus having that skill, it's a whole different level of difficulty for the batsman,"" Border said.Bumrah became India's top Test wicket-taker in Australia during the third Test in Brisbane, surpassing the great Kapil Dev , grabbing nine wickets to surpass the legendary pacer's record of 51 and reach 53 in Australia.Bumrah was the player of the match in India's 295-run triumph in Perth in the first Test.With 21 wickets in the series thus far at an almost unbelievable average of 10.90, he is the most prolific bowler on both sides.On a bouncing Perth wicket, Bumrah, who was captaining the first Test in the absence of Rohit Sharma , made life miserable for the Australian batters.Border added, ""Bumrah will do a very good job (as captain). In Perth, he used himself properly. Captaincy-wise, the way he set the fields, you couldn't fault him.""Australia were dismissed for 104 in Perth after Bumrah took 5-30 from 18 overs. In the second innings, he added 3-42 to help India win by 295 runs.On fast bowlers as captains, Border said, ""It's a tough one, because after your over, you need to go down to fine leg for a break and a drink! As captain, you can't do that. You need to be at mid-on, directing the field. But Bumrah did well, he's aggressive as a bowler, but not as aggressive as a person. He's always got that smile on his face. Cummins too.""",Jasprit Bumrah is the top wicket-taker in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series.

Top-order woes force Aussies to make big changes ahead of

Boxing Day Test

Stadium Walkthrough series: Inside The Gabba

MELBOURNE: There seems to be little cheer in the Aussie camp ahead of the Christmas weekend. After making all the right noises in support of their new opener, the George Bailey-led selection committee has made an about-turn and dropped the struggling Nathan McSweeney for the remainder of the series.McSweeney's continuing troubles against Jasprit Bumrah meant a call-up for 19-year-old Sam Konstas , who will now shoulder the team's opening burden at a crucial stage in the series. The other senior under-performing opener, Usman Khawaja , retains his place for now.Bailey cited ""the need to throw something different at India"" and Konstas, if he opens at the MCG, will get the chance to show he has the steel for the top rung after having been in fine form this season.The New South Wales opener was overlooked at the start of the series in spite of becoming the youngest player since Ricky Ponting to hit twin tons in a Sheffield Shield game-152 and 105 against South Australia in Sydney in Oct. He also scored a 107 for the PM's XI in the tour game against the Indians and an 88 against Western Australia earlier this month while averaging 55.83 this season.Konstas will become the fourth-youngest debutant for Australia in Tests if he gets a game at the MCG. Josh Inglis and Beau Webster have also been retained in the squad as reserve batters.""I acknowledge that it's a tough call on Nathan,"" Bailey said on Friday. ""It's been a challenge at the top of the order for both teams. I think Sam's method, his style, is different to Nathan's, providing the option of a different look and a different make-up for the XI come Boxing Day. We'd like the ability to throw something different at India.""Standing in the path of Australia's newest batting sensation will be Bumrah, who dismissed the 25-year-old McSweeney four out of six times in the series.McSweeney can be said to have got a raw deal, since he was thrust into the role of Test opener and had not opened at first-class level before this season. He now leaves with an average of 14.40 from three Tests, with the crucial 39 in Adelaide as his highest, but he hasn't been the only one struggling in the top order across both teams. The 38-year-old Khawaja has even less runs, averaging 12.6 with a highest of 21 in the first innings in Brisbane, and looked equally at sea against Bumrah. Jhye Richardson , meanwhile, has earned a recall in place of the injured Josh Hazlewood, though Scott Boland is expected to walk into the XI in the fourth Test. Speedster Sean Abbott is also back in the squad.Since David Warner's retirement, Khawaja has been paired with makeshift openers Steve Smith and McSweeney with little success. Australia's openers have contributed 243 runs at an average of 22 from 14 innings since saying goodbye to Warner, meaning Konstas has to now shoulder some big responsibilities on his teen shoulders.SQUAD: Pat Cummins (C), Sean Abbott, Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Sam Konstas, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Jhye Richardson, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Beau Webster",Nathan McSweeney dropped for remainder of series against India.

's greatest captain, talks to TOI about the perils of rapid chopping & changing, how aggressive batting has ruled in this series & the rare art of

...

Stadium Walkthrough series: Inside The Gabba

Excerpts from an interview...

In your playing days, you were one of the fittest around, playing 153 consecutive Tests.

You led in 93 Tests, second only to Graeme Smith's 109...

Your batting made Australia a powerhouse, but in that World Cup win (1987), it was your left-arm spin that caused Mike Gatting's brain fade.

When you see today's cricketers pulling off these extraordinary shots with such ease, what's your reaction?

Is T20 changing Tests, or do these shots just wow more when played in the longer format?

And you still need your openers to blunt the new ball‚Ä¶

Do you like what you see about

?

In the early days of your captaincy, Australia was in a period of tough transition. How did you go about the leadership at that point in time? The current Indian and Australian teams are facing a similar situation, with so many senior players who can't go on for too much longer. What's the best way to rebuild?

Define 'a bit'? How much time are you prepared to give that potential?

We no longer have a leg-spinner calling the shots in an Australian home summer. Wasn't Australia supposed to be the land of leg-spin with its hard, bouncy pitches?

So T20's idea of containment has seeped through to Test captains?

As a fielder, you always had a fantastic, fast throw that threw the batsman off.

The most difficult bowler you faced?

You spoke about Bumrah lighting up this series.

Bumrah captained in Perth, might captain India again in future...

How do you look at pacer-captains in general?

is another.

Modern batters talk a lot about the problems of having to adjust to different formats. Did you make too many technical adjustments on the fly?

How do you remember the tied Test (Madras, Sept '86)?

MELBOURNE: We are sitting at the rain soaked Gabba as the third Test drips away to meaninglessness. The legendary Allan Border, one of Australia's most durable captains, one of their most determined and prolific batsmen, is lounging on a sofa, staring at the TV screen. There was a time when it was hard to imagine an Australian team without Border as leader. He stepped up at a difficult time, adapted to the role and by the time he left, Australian cricket had metamorphosed into the relentless winning machine it is today.It's not for nothing that Australia's cricketer of the year gets to wear the Allan Border medal. Border is now 69, his memory still sharp as a razor's edge. He is concerned, though, when asked about his personal health. ""Oh, man,"" he sighs. ""I mean, you know I've got Parkinson's Disease. I'm not 100%. Luckily, I've got good medical help."" The talk moves on to cricketing matters, and Border is himself again.Alastair Cook has the most (159). I was very fortunate as far as injury is concerned. The times I did have injury was in the off season. I didn't ever miss games because of injury. That's luck. Occasionally I'd have an injury that I probably shouldn't have played with, but I did, like a broken finger.I just loved the game! So even if there was a little niggle, you tried and played if it wasn't debilitating. If you had sort of like a knee (issue), you could always field at slip.I'd probably have bowled more if I wasn't captain. It wasn't necessarily a plan to get 'Gat' out. He was batting well. He had taken to our spinner, Tim May. If you remember, he had hit a few boundaries and was starting to look comfortable. I didn't have another spin option. I thought, if I come on, 'Gat' might think, 'I don't want to get out to a part-timer.' So, he might change the way he plays. The way I set the field, I knew he was going to try and hit me through the offside. I bowled way outside leg stump, and he had predetermined to play the reverse sweep. It was just so wide, he had to really reach for it and got the top edge. It would have been called wide for sure!Those days, we hadn't seen the reverse sweep very often. The guys in England had started to play it in county cricket, because they used to have seven-two fields. That's how it started. I look at it positively. Even in this series, we've seen how Travis Head walks in and the game changes. All of a sudden, you've got a deep point, deep backward square. He's attacking the bowling, attacking even Jasprit Bumrah . I'm watching and thinking, 'It's amazing.'Head looks like he's batting on a different pitch because he's being aggressive. He's backing his ability to play the right shot to the right ball. He might still block a ball or let it go, but his mindset is to attack. Rishabh (Pant) is the same. All the players who seem to be having some success on these difficult pitches have this aggressive mindset. I'm not in awe, but I really respect that mindset. I know myself. I was probably the other way. I would go more defensive.The contest between bat and ball is better in Tests. In T20s, they're trying to take the ball out of the game. They want to see aggressive batting. The bowler is secondary. In Tests, the bowling has a big say. I'm a real fan of Tests for that reason. It's a better contest between bat and ball, a truer contest rather than a game set up purely for batting and power hitting. Just look at Bumrah. His presence has lit up this series. I like T20 for what it brings, but it's a different crowd. I don't think it has hurt Test cricket.That's why I say you've always had guys like Travis. You think back to different eras, we've had guys who've been attacking players. You've also had guys at the top of the order that take the shine off the new ball. Pujara, for example, from the last two series. It was fantastic the way he blunted the bowling. The rest of the players could bat around him. In T20, you can't have that.I like the backstory. We're talking about a really tough kid here. For him, with his struggles, to get to the Test team of a country with 1.2 billion people, it's unbelievable. He's got incredible talent, obviously that's come through. He'll have his moments because he's new. People haven't seen much of him. It'll take a while for bowlers to start working him out. He's going to be the sort of player who might go through a little (bad) patch, then work himself out and come back a better player. I think he's very good.All Australia's players are 30-plus. They have a rebuild that will have to happen over the next few years. What you don't want to do is push it. You want to try and do it gradually.When I think back to 1985, 1986, that period, and two years before that, with Greg Chappell, Dennis Lilee, Rod Marsh, they all went together in one Test (SCG, 1984). The next day we're playing, they're not there. Then we had guys going to South Africa, so they're not playing for Australia. It was a real difficult period in that you changed the whole side. It takes a while to build up.What we did wrong initially in that period was chop and change the side. Every time someone missed out once or twice, it was 'move on, move on'. Next, next, next. That's a totally wrong thing. You've got to try and identify players. Even if it's just potential, if you identify that, you can stick with that for a bit.You can't give someone a year, two years. You can give them a series. You can tell pretty quickly if someone is cut out for it over three Test matches. Two Tests are not enough, three probably is. And then you wait and watch and see their development. It took Steve Waugh a couple of years to find his mark. He ended up getting dropped and then coming back a very, very good player. Nearly everyone who has an international career has been dropped at some stage. Even Bradman. If it's happened to Bradman, you shouldn't worry about yourself.I'm surprised India haven't brought (Yuzvendra) Chahal or Kuldeep Yadav . It's hard to develop a leg-spinner. A Shane Warne doesn't come along every day. I don't think captains use leg-spinners very well. They want them to be like Warne, crowding men around the bat, on the attack. I see captains bring on a leggie and they've got bat-pad, two slips and a gully.Captains are very defensive. They need to realize it's going to take a while for a young leg-spinner to develop. You need to give him protection. He's going to bowl one half-tracker or a full toss. They don't necessarily get blokes out bat-pad or caught at slip. You've got to have the captaincy to bring the best out of a leggie. Finger spinners are tighter. It's a containment thing, and then you wait for the batsmen to get themselves out. Whereas with the leggie, the tendency is to be a bit loose. Warney was different because he was very accurate and could spin the ball. That just shows how hard that art is to master.Yes, but the best way to contain is to take wickets. In T20, guys are going to attack. You don't have to be over-attacking. If you spin a little bit and the guy can't pick you, that'd be a lot of T20 wickets!I was a baseballer in my younger days. Baseball is based on good throws. When I was a kid, baseball was a winter game, cricket was the summer game. I played both. It's a good complimentary game for cricket. These days kids pick their sport. In my day you could play three, four sports. I learnt how to get to the ball quickly and get rid of it quickly. That's baseball.Malcom Marshall. He wasn't very tall, but he skidded on a bit. He would drop his pace when he could swing it a little bit, but then he could bowl rapidly as well. All those West Indians were tough, but Marshall had a very fast arm and was tough to pick.Bumrah, these days, is on that pedestal. His wrists, his release points are different to other bowlers. Because of that hyperextension, he's releasing the ball a foot further down than other bowlers. He's got a unique shuffling run-up, and then the snap of these wrists, he's amazing. Being different, plus having that skill, it's a whole different level of difficulty for the batsman.He'll do a very good job. In Perth, he used himself properly. Captaincy-wise, the way he set the fields, you couldn't fault him.It's a tough one, because after your over, you need to go down to fine leg for a break and a drink! As captain, you can't do that. You need to be at mid-on, directing the field. But Bumrah did well, he's aggressive as a bowler, but not as aggressive as a person. He's always got that smile on his face. Cummins too.No. The One-Day game wasn't played differently, we'd just be more aggressive towards the end of the innings. We didn't really change our games too much. Whereas now, going from T20 to Tests is tough.Maninder (Singh) still says he got a little inside edge (laughs). Can they take out the old footage and do a 'Snicko' on it? I suppose not. We had a couple of heroes. One was Deano with his double hundred. But a lot of people forget Greg Matthews. He got 10 wickets. We declared at 574/7 in our first innings and we still should have lost the game. It just shows how long, drawn out periods in Test cricket can still produce a fantastic game. We should have lost in the last afternoon, but we just somehow hung in there.I was very worried about Ravi (Shastri). Ravi was someone who was just going to wait, wait, wait and then hit the last ball. But then he took that single, you know. Why? I've never asked him, I think I should! I think his theory was, if I took that single and tied the scores, then Maninder would somehow get bat on ball, perhaps.We didn't deserve to win, because we made two declarations, and India, to their credit, kept going for the win. That tactical to and fro, the way Ravi played, it was tremendous. Every time we got ahead, he would go boom boom and push the field back.Sunny (Gavaskar) played one of the best knocks I've ever seen. It was like a cover-drive clinic. I've never seen Sunny bat better. He made 90. I know he has bigger scores but in the context of this game, where you need 348 on the last day and he starts off at No. 1, makes 90 quickly, you're in the game then, aren't you?","Allan Border, Australia's greatest captain, talks to TOI about the perils of rapid chopping & changing, how aggressive batting has ruled in this series & the rare art of batting.

Australia squad:

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the Boxing Day Test against India, Australian selectors have called up uncapped teenager Sam Konstas , aiming to inject a fresh dynamic into their top-order batting. Selection chair George Bailey explained the decision, emphasizing the need for a different approach to counter India‚Äôs formidable pace attack.Bailey acknowledged that Australia‚Äôs current top three - Usman Khawaja Nathan McSweeney , and Marnus Labuschagne - have struggled to keep the scoreboard moving, with strike rates of 46.3, 33.9, and 33.2 respectively in the series.""You can say the way our top three have been playing has been reasonably similar, and we'd like the ability to throw something different at India,"" Bailey said. ""If you look more broadly, I don‚Äôt think necessarily the top six has functioned to the level that we need in this series as a whole.""By comparison, India‚Äôs top three - KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and Shubman Gill - have adopted a more aggressive approach, striking above 50 runs per 100 balls faced. This disparity in intent has highlighted the need for Australia to counterattack rather than merely survive against Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj‚Äôs relentless pace.Bailey noted that Konstas‚Äô batting style offers a point of difference: ""I think Sam‚Äôs method and style is different to Nathan‚Äôs... and different again to Beau (Webster) and Josh (Inglis) as the other batting options within that squad.""While Konstas is in contention for a debut, other options include reshuffling the order or promoting auxiliary batter Josh Inglis to open - a role he has filled in white-ball formats but never in first-class cricket.The selectors also bolstered the squad with all-rounder Beau Webster and pacers Sean Abbott and Jhye Richardson, considering the three-day turnaround between the Melbourne and Sydney Tests.""Looking forward, Melbourne-Sydney is clearly a quick turnaround. We‚Äôre just making sure we‚Äôve got options between those two Tests,"" he said.The Boxing Day Test at the MCG, with the series tied 1-1, promises to be a litmus test for Australia‚Äôs revamped lineup.Pat Cummins (c), Travis Head (vc), Steve Smith (vc), Sean Abbott, Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Sam Konstas, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Jhye Richardson, Mitchell Starc, Beau Webster","Australian selectors call up uncapped teenager Sam Konstas for Boxing Day Test.

Inside Australia's National Cricket Centre: Where the champions train!

NEW DELHI: Indian spin legend Harbhajan Singh has shared how his once-bitter feud with Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds evolved into a deep friendship, highlighting how one of cricket's most infamous scandals ended on a positive note.The 2007-08 Test series between India and Australia was marred by the ""Monkeygate"" controversy, where Symonds accused Harbhajan of racially abusing him during the Sydney Test. The allegation led to Harbhajan being handed a three-match ban, later reduced after appeals. The saga nearly derailed India's tour of Australia, with tensions flaring on and off the field.Despite the acrimony, the pair eventually reconciled after being teammates for the Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League IPL ). Harbhajan recounted how their friendship began when Symonds visited his home in Chandigarh with a bottle of Bundaberg Rum, a gesture that broke the ice between the two rivals.""We sat together for a long, long time and talked about it. At the end of the conversation, we had a long hug,"" Harbhajan said in an interview with Code Sports. ""The picture of the hug became very famous in our chat groups. A very ugly spat became a great friendship.""Reflecting on the incident, Harbhajan admitted the controversy should never have escalated to the level it did. ""That Sydney thing should never have exploded like it did. We did sort out everything. We left the controversy behind and went on to win the IPL championship together,"" he said.Harbhajan also expressed profound grief over Symonds' untimely death in a car crash in May 2022 at the age of 46.""When I heard the news of his accident, I just hoped it was false. I couldn't believe it,"" Harbhajan said. ""I was shattered. When I was in Brisbane last week, I thought if he were still alive, I'd have gone to his place that night, and we would have gone out. That's the bond we shared.""The two cricketers' journey from animosity to camaraderie serves as a testament to the transformative power of sports and mutual respect. Harbhajan concluded by emphasizing the enduring impact of Symonds on his life, saying, ""Andrew is missed every day.""","Indian spin legend Harbhajan Singh has shared how his once-bitter feud with Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds evolved into a deep friendship.

Amid talk of transition, the spotlight will be on India's underperforming middle order heading into the fourth Test. Australia share similar concerns, but it's their top order that's facing the heat

Rohit Sharma press conference: On Ashwin, Gabba draw and his form

MELBOURNE: Will the abrupt manner of Ravichandran Ashwin 's exit from the international arena affect India's spirit? Will Australia find all the negative talk about the top order overwhelming? These are the two major questions facing these era-defining teams as they go into the fourth Test facing identical issues about poor batting returns and inevitable change.For India, Ashwin's retirement could be a portent of things to come. For Australia, David Warner's last Test in Sydney against Pakistan at the beginning of the year kick started plans which have yet to come to fruition. Bluntly put, Australia have yet to find a proper replacement, showing the perils of forced transition.Australia's pace lineup too is ageing but is still formidable and has kept such questions at bay. The same can't be said of some of the senior batting stars on both sides, but they aren't the only ones under the microscope any more - some inconsistent youngsters too must share the blame.Both these teams are finding it hard to trust their batting lineups right now, but to what degree can teams contemplate alterations ahead of what is expected to be a series defining Test?As Ashwin told his teammates in the dressing room at the Gabba, ""Trust me, everybody's time comes."" Change may be inevitable, but Australia's canny skipper Pat Cummins is punting on being the enemy of change for now.Faced with a barrage of questions on sticking with the opening combo of Nathan McSweeney and Usman Khawaja, who haven't exactly set the series on fire, Cummins retaliated, ""There is so much more to picking a side than just looking at the Internet. (It's about) going on with really strong philosophies, working with players as a unit.""There is no dearth of conspiracy theories when it comes to Australian cricket. Former player and coach Darren Lehmann has even suggested chief selector George Bailey is too close to the team and hence unable to make ""hard decisions"". Cummins shot back, saying, ""The most important thing is you stay objective. They've made some really bold calls over the past couple of years in all formats. Probably bolder than I've seen other selectors make.""The ""bold call"" everyone wants now is to address Australia's struggling top three of Khawaja, McSweeney and Marnus Labuschagne, who have a combined average of 14.4, the lowest for Australia's top three in a home summer since 1887-88. Cummins feels there is no need to panic since some tough batting conditions have meant both teams have struggled to score.""Everyone's always hoping to score more runs. The trend in cricket, pretty much all around the world, is the top three is a really hard place to bat at the moment, particularly in Australia. The wickets are tough,"" Cummins said. ""I'd like them to score more runs, but they've made some important contributions that others have benefited from.""For India, the whole focus has been on the lack of runs from captain Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli 's unconvincing stays in the middle, apart from the century in Perth. But after a promising start, opener Yashasvi Jaiswal has fallen flat. No. 3 Shubman Gill and No. 5 Rishabh Pant too have been unable to convert starts. India, obviously, have the edge in the opening combine given KL Rahul 's good form, with the openers averaging 42.8 from 12 innings here compared to Australia's paltry 13.5.It's the middle order, from No. 3-6, that has been the real disappointment for India as a unit, averaging just 17.78 from a combined 20 innings to Australia's 31.95. India have clearly missed an in-form enforcer like Travis Head, a task entrusted to the likes of Pant.So, while both batting units have problems, they are different ones. Nos. 7-11 have performed similarly on both sides, Australia averaging 21.41 to India's 22.82, though India's last pair did heroically to avoid the follow-on in Brisbane to claim bragging rights.It appears the captains think alike about the batting issue. Like Cummins, Rohit too focused on the overall attitude instead of individual returns. ""It might appear that we lagged behind (in the third Test at the Gabba) but we take a lot from here. I'm immensely proud of the attitude we've shown because runs and wickets are one thing, but if your attitude and character are good then you can turn the impossible into possible,"" he said.Going into the MCG Test, only two things are clear on both sides. The younger batters will in all likelihood get a longer rope. And the veterans will be challenged to change themselves. How well they do so may decide which side comes out on top.",India and Australia face identical issues about poor batting returns and inevitable change. Ravichandran Ashwin's retirement could be a portent of things to come.

NEW DELHI: Indian women's cricket team vice-captain Smriti Mandhana delivered a record-breaking performance in the series-deciding third T20I against the West Indies on Thursday, cementing her status as one of the greatest batters in the shortest format. Her explosive knock of 77 runs, combined with Richa Ghosh 's whirlwind fifty, propelled India to their highest-ever T20I total of 217/4.Mandhana's innings was a masterclass in consistency and aggression. With this knock, she achieved multiple milestones, most notably breaking Suzie Bates‚Äô world record for the most 50+ scores in women‚Äôs T20Is.Mandhana now has 30 such scores in 148 matches, surpassing the New Zealand legend‚Äôs 29 in 171 appearances. She also overtook Bates‚Äô long-standing record for the most fours in women‚Äôs T20Is, taking her tally to 506 boundaries.Adding to her growing list of achievements, Mandhana also claimed the record for the most runs in a bilateral T20I series for India, amassing 193 runs in the three-match contest against the West Indies. This surpasses Mithali Raj ‚Äôs 192 runs scored in a five-match series against South Africa in 2018.Mandhana‚Äôs performance this year has been nothing short of extraordinary.

Australia squad:

Former Australian captain Michael Clarke has fiercely criticized the national selectors for dropping Nathan McSweeney midway through the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy against India. McSweeney, who was handed the opening role earlier in the series, has been replaced by Sam Konstas for the final two Tests.McSweeney's dismissal comes after a series of underwhelming performances, with scores of 10, 0, 39, 10, 9, and 4 across six innings. However, Clarke believes the selectors should have persisted with the young opener instead of making a hasty decision.""Nathan McSweeney has been dropped. I can't believe that,"" Clarke said on the Beyond 23 Cricket podcast. ""No matter who they picked in that opening position, they had to give them the series. I think the selectors have got this wrong.""Clarke was especially critical of chief selector George Bailey and questioned the logic behind McSweeney's omission, given the struggles of several senior players in the side.""We've got Usman Khawaja who is 38 years old, and he's made no runs. He's a senior player,"" Clarke pointed out. ""We've got Marnus Labuschagne , who before the series was under pressure and has made one decent score. Steve Smith batted like a genius to make a hard-fought hundred, but he's also been under pressure. Everyone apart from McSweeney is over 30 years of age, some in their high 30s.""Clarke expressed concerns about Australia's long-term plans for the opening position, particularly with Khawaja nearing retirement.""What happens if Usman Khawaja retires in two Test matches? Does McSweeney then come back in, or does he go to the back of the queue? They've got to come out and say, ‚ÄòWe made a mistake picking him,'"" Clarke remarked.Despite his reservations, Clarke wished Konstas well ahead of a potential debut at the MCG.""I hope he walks out there, lives his dream, makes a hundred on debut. Something like that would be amazing,"" Clarke concluded.The fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy is set to begin on December 26 in Melbourne, with the series currently tied at 1-1.Pat Cummins (c), Travis Head (vc), Steve Smith (vc), Sean Abbott, Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Sam Konstas, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Jhye Richardson, Mitchell Starc, Beau Webster",Nathan McSweeney has been dropped by Australia for the final two Tests against India.

Rohit Sharma press conference: On Ashwin, Gabba draw and his form

India skipper Rohit Sharma on Wednesday provided a key update on premium pacer Mohammed Shami ‚Äôs availability for the remaining two Tests against Australia.With two crucial matches remaining in the series, Shami's inclusion will surely strengthen India‚Äôs chances of clinching the series against the formidable Aussies.Speaking at a press conference after the drawn Gabba Test in Brisbane, Rohit categorically stated that it's high time someone from National Cricket Academy (NCA), where the ace pacer is undergoing rehabilitation after ankle surgery in November 2023, should talk about it as they are the ones who will give Shami green signal for the international cricket.""I think it's high time somebody from NCA talked about him. That's our national cricket academy where he is rehabbing. Those guys are the ones who need to come up and give us some kind of update. But look, I understand he's playing a lot of cricket back home, but there have been some complaints about his knee as well,"" Rohit said in the post-match press meet.""The last thing you want is the player coming here and then pulling out in the middle of the game. You know what happens when that kind of thing happens,"" Rohit quipped, referring to the disruption caused by mid-series injuries.Shami has been away from international cricket since participating in India's ODI World Cup Final in November 2023. His path back to competitive cricket has involved playing domestic tournaments.Following his surgery and comprehensive rehabilitation, the seasoned fast bowler resumed playing through the Ranji Trophy, and later delivered strong performances in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.The Indian cricket team's management remains cautious about Shami's return, insisting on definitive clearance from the NCA. Rohit emphasised that the team would only consider including him in the squad after receiving complete assurance regarding his fitness from the academy.""There's no way we want to take that chance unless we are like, not a hundred percent, 200 hundred percent sure. We're not going to take any risk. But yeah, like I said in the last press conference, the door is open. If those guys at the NCA feel that he's okay to go and recovered and play, I will be happy to have him,"" he added.The five-match series is currently tied at 1-1 after the third Test in Brisbane ended in a draw on Wednesday.

Pakistan secured an emphatic 81-run victory against South Africa in the second ODI at Newlands, Cape Town, clinching the three-match series with an unassailable 2-0 lead. While the contributions of veterans Babar Azam (73) and Mohammad Rizwan (80) were pivotal in setting a competitive total of 329, and the bowling heroics of Shaheen Afridi (4/47) and Naseem Shah (3/37) sealed the win, the match‚Äôs narrative was dominated by a heated on-field confrontation during South Africa‚Äôs chase.The incident occurred when South African batter Heinrich Klaasen , who scored a valiant 97, appeared visibly agitated after an exchange with Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf following the delivery of a ball. Klaasen‚Äôs discontent escalated into a verbal spat, involving teammate David Miller and Pakistan skipper Rizwan, who is typically known for his calm demeanor.It was a tense scene as Rizwan and Klaasen engaged in a finger-pointing argument, prompting the umpires to intervene and defuse the situation. Babar Azam, Pakistan‚Äôs star batter and team stalwart, ran over to mediate and prevent further escalation. His timely interjection calmed an approaching Haris Rauf, averting what could have become a larger altercation.Once tempers cooled, play resumed without further incident, but the moment left fans buzzing on social media, with opinions divided about the exchange's origins and implications.Despite the drama, Pakistan‚Äôs dominant performance shone through.

NEW DELHI: Ravichandran Ashwin , one of India's most celebrated spinners, announced his retirement from international cricket on Wednesday, marking the end of a 14-year career that established him as one of the finest bowlers in the game. Ashwin's 537 Test wickets and 765 international wickets place him as India's second-highest wicket-taker in both categories, behind only the legendary Anil Kumble The comparison between Ashwin and Kumble, two titans of Indian cricket, is inevitable, though challenging due to the different eras and conditions in which they played.Kumble's dominance is reflected in his 619 Test wickets and 953 international scalps, records that have stood the test of time. His career spanned nearly two decades, during which he delivered consistent match-winning performances. Known for his unrelenting accuracy and subtle variations, Kumble remains the highest wicket-taker in Indian cricket history.Ashwin, however, surpassed Kumble in terms of efficiency. He holds the distinction of being the fastest Indian bowler to reach every milestone from 50 to 500 Test wickets, achieving these feats in fewer matches than Kumble. With a bowling average of 24.00 and a strike rate of 52.6, Ashwin edges Kumble, who averaged 29.65 with a strike rate of 65.9 in Tests.Ashwin also holds the record for the most five-wicket hauls (37) by an Indian bowler. His dominance at home is unmatched as 383 of his 537 Test wickets came in India. His ability to outfox left-handers is particularly noteworthy; his 268 dismissals of southpaws are the most by any bowler in Test cricket history.Ashwin's prowess with the bat sets him apart from most bowlers, including Kumble. With 3,503 Test runs at an average of 25.75, including six centuries, Ashwin has contributed significantly down the order. In comparison, Kumble amassed 2,506 Test runs at an average of 17.77, with one century to his name.Ashwin's all-round capabilities are reflected in his rare double of 3,000+ runs and 500+ wickets in Tests, a feat achieved only by Shane Warne and Stuart Broad apart from him.While Ashwin's numbers suggest a slight edge in efficiency and versatility, Kumble's longevity and sheer volume of wickets underscore his unmatched contribution to Indian cricket. Both spinners were game-changers, single-handedly turning matches in India's favour.As Ashwin retires, cricket fans celebrate two extraordinary careers, each embodying excellence and redefining Indian spin bowling in their unique way. Both will remain etched in history as legends who raised the bar for generations to come.","Ravichandran Ashwin announced his retirement from international cricket on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai batter Prithvi Shaw has been on the wrong side of news lately, facing criticism over poor fitness, discipline and attitude.The 25-year-old recently drew flak from a Mumbai Cricket Association official, who brought to the notice that even seniors in the Mumbai side were complaining about his attitude.In the midst of the criticism, Shaw, late on Friday, shared a cryptic post on his Instagram, pointing out that many have been commenting on him without knowing full facts.""If you don't understand it fully, don't speak on it. Too many people have full opinions, with half the facts,"" Shaw wrote.Earlier, Shaw had voiced his frustration after being left out of the 16-member squad for the Vijay Hazare Trophy, despite playing a key role in the team's title-winning campaign in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.Responding to Shaw's outburst, an MCA official told news agency PTI that Shaw is 'his own enemy'""In the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, we were playing with 10 fielders as we were forced to hide Prithvi Shaw. The ball would pass near him and he would barely be able to get to it,"" the official said on conditions of anonymity.""Even while batting, we could see he was troubled reaching to the ball. His fitness, discipline and attitude are poor and it is pretty simple, there cannot be different rules for different players,"" he claimed.""Even the seniors in the team have started complaining about his attitude now,"" he added.Shaw burst onto the scene with great promise, making his Test debut as an 18-year-old in 2018 during a home series against the West Indies.He made an instant impact, scoring a century on debut, but has since played just four more Tests, the last of which was against Australia four years ago.Concerns over his on and off-field behavior have been voiced by several former players, adding to his struggles.A recent setback for Shaw came during the IPL auction, where he went unsold despite a modest base price of Rs 75 lakh.","Mumbai batsman Prithvi Shaw posts cryptic post on Instagram.

NEW DELHI: According to former Team India head coach Ravi Shastri , India's resilience on the final day of the third Test against Australia in Brisbane has been a defining moment in the ongoing series, providing the team with a psychological boost ahead of the Boxing Day Test at the MCG.Shastri highlighted the importance of India avoiding the follow-on at the Gabba, with the last pair of Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep setting the tone for the next phase of the game.‚ÄúYou should celebrate,‚Äù Ravi Shastri said. ‚ÄúIt required a lot of character from the last pair with 35-36 runs needed. That celebration showed, they knew the importance of that effort within the dressing room in the context of the series.‚ÄùShastri drew parallels with India's recent history, recalling the remarkable partnership between Bumrah and Mohammed Shami at Lord's during the 2021 series against England, which turned the game in India's favour.‚ÄúIt's one thing following on, it's one thing then again being 2-3 down as opposed to, you going ahead and rattling the Australian top-order. It is fully justified,‚Äù he added. ""It reminded me of the celebration, when in COVID times, when Jasprit and Mohammed Shami were involved in a partnership at Lord‚Äôs, which turned the game on its head.""‚ÄúEngland were odds on favourites on the final day to win the Test. And that partnership, I think of about 80 or 90, suddenly turned the game on its head and by the end of the day, India had won the Test match,‚Äù he added.He emphasized the significance of the tail-enders' stubbornness and resilience, citing instances like Ravichandran Ashwin and Hanuma Vihari's steadfast batting in Sydney, which has been handy for India in recent times.According to Shastri, such performances lift the entire team and provide a psychological advantage in high-stakes series. He believes that the fight shown in this Test could prove crucial for India as the series moves forward, with the series now tied at 1-1 ahead of the Boxing Day Test.‚ÄúThey've been kept in this series single-handedly by Jasprit Bumrah,‚Äù Shastri said. ‚ÄúIf the big boys wake up, and step up to the plate which I just get the gut feeling they will, then Australia has a problem on their hands.""‚ÄúYeah, they got out of jail but they are not on bail.

How Sri Lanka Could Surpass India?

Stadium Walkthrough series: Inside The Gabba

NEW DELHI: India‚Äôs hopes of making it to the World Test Championship (WTC) Final face a steep challenge as the Border-Gavaskar Trophy enters its final stretch.With the five-match series currently level at 1-1, any slip-up could have significant consequences on their qualification chances.In the weather-affected third Test at the Gabba, persistent rain denied both teams a result, with Australia setting India a target of 275 runs before rain forced play to be abandoned with India at 8/0.The drawn match leaves India needing strong performances in the remaining two Tests to maintain their WTC Final aspirations.However, if India lose the series either 1-2 or 1-3, they will finish the WTC cycle with a percentage points tally (PCT) of 51.75%‚Äînot enough to secure a place in the top two of the WTC standings.This scenario would eliminate India from contention, with Australia and South Africa cementing their positions above them.The equation becomes more complicated with Sri Lanka‚Äôs involvement. If Sri Lanka win their upcoming series against Australia 2-0, they will climb to a PCT of 53.85%, overtaking India and securing a place in the WTC Final.To avoid elimination, India must avoid defeat in the ongoing series. Stronger contributions from the top order, an improved spin strategy, and fitness clarity for key bowlers like Jasprit Bumrah are essential.With the WTC Final at stake, India not only need to focus on their own performance but will also rely on other results falling in their favour.
