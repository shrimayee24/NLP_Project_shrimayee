Argument For Lightness

So, your doctor is a man?” he asks, eyes on the road.“Yes,” she shrugs, head wrapped in a scarf.“The oncologist is a man. He was referred to me by my gynaecologist.”“Okay. She must be sure of his credentials then.”“He. My gynaecologist is a man.”“What? You mean he touches you?”₹Questionable questions, awkward puns, well-timed expletives and several unreciprocated high-fives animate ‘Breast of Luck’, a play whose protagonists choose to sing, dance and laugh their way through the grimness of cancer.Co-written and staged by Tannishtha Chatterjee — who was diagnosed with stage IV oligometastatic cancer last year — and Sharib Hashmi , whose wife has beaten mouth cancer four times, the musical comedy, directed by Leena Yadav, opened at the G5A in Mumbai recently to a packed house. The room included Naseeruddin Shah, Dia Mirza, Tanvi Azmi and Divya Dutta, apart from Chatterjee’s doctors and cancer survivors. At the end of the first show, Chatterjee turned to the room and said, “Honestly, I don’t know how I am doing except that I have stopped chasing certainty. ” Shah reassured her: “This is the most cathartic and best thing you could have done for yourself.”To be staged at the Kala Ghoda Arts Festival on Feb 4 to mark World Cancer Day, the script sees opposites distract before they attract.Sheila Roy is a cool, composed classical singer, while Arun Mohan is a goofy divorced stockbroker who punctuates dad jokes with high-fives. When she launches into her riyaaz every morning at 5, he winces and rings her up on the intercom, begging her to stop. Their heated exchanges morph into real-world meetings on a dating app. Just as Roy begins to enjoy Mohan’s company, the story swerves: she is diagnosed with stage IV oligometastatic breast cancer.She pushes Mohan away, convinced love will only expose her vulnerability. He refuses to leave, insisting on staying, his caregiving peppered with relentless puns. That refusal to surrender humour, intimacy or companionship to illness anchors the play’s emotional centre. Often reduced to a serious trope in movies, the Big C finds its funny bone in the drama. “Exactly. That is the USP,” Hashmi says. “Otherwise, it could easily have become a sad story. We chose to see it from a lighter side — with songs, jokes, laughter.”The play draws from a deep personal well. Interspersed through the second half are real hospital visuals — insurance IVRs (interactive voice responses), chemotherapy rooms, and injections. At one point, you watch Chatterjee singing through an injection. “The targeted medicine was extremely painful. But when I sing, those 10 minutes used to pass more quickly,” says Chatterjee, who had invited her friend, a documentary cinematographer, to shoot on the last day of her chemo.Music, laughter and community sustained Chatterjee through the medical journey. Incidentally, Chatterjee — best known for her performances in ‘Dekh Indian Circus’ (2011), ‘Gulaab Gang’ (2013), and ‘Angry Indian Goddesses’ (2015) — was supposed to meet Hashmi of ‘Family Man’ and ‘Filmistaan’ fame on the day her biopsy report arrived. Hashmi had been shooting for her film ‘Full Plate’ and had casually discussed a collaboration.“The day I got my report, I was supposed to meet Sharib for coffee. I almost cancelled,” she recalls. “I was devastated. But I thought if I go home, I’ll have to tell my mother and I’ll feel worse. So I went.”A year before Chatterjee was diagnosed, she had lost her father to cancer. “He died in my arms in the hospital ICU. He was so full of life. When I was diagnosed, my main concern was my mom, who’s 70plus. How would I give this news to her? Because it wasn’t stage one, or stage two, or even stage three — it was stage four.”When she confided in Hashmi, he called his wife Nasreen, who has lived with cancer since 2018. “She gave me a lot of strength,” Chatterjee says. “She said, ‘Look at me. I’ve relapsed four times. I’m here. I’m doing everything.’ After that call, I looked at Sharib and said, let’s write a play for her.”The script took shape during chemotherapy. Rehearsals were scheduled between hospital visits. Improvisations were shaped as much by pain as by laughter. “I was writing while going through treatment. I wanted to laugh constantly. I didn’t want to pull myself down,” says Chatterjee, who found humour in the mundane — doctors clinically debating silicone implants, nurses scolding her and her friends for laughing too loudly in hospital rooms.The rehearsals weren’t easy. “I had, and still have, terrible nerve damage in my shoulder and left arm. Everyone had to be careful while hugging me or touching me because it’s excruciating if it goes beyond a certain range of mobility.”Hashmi relates to Arun Mohan not only as a performer but as a caregiver. “After my wife’s diagnosis, our lives changed completely,” he says. “But she treated cancer like a fever — with courage, humour, incredible strength. We tried to bring that spirit into the play.”Medical professionals echo that sentiment carefully. Breast oncoplastic surgeon Dr Vani Parmar notes that a cancer diagnosis often arrives as a shock, particularly for younger women. “The treatments — radical surgeries, long chemotherapy sessions, hair loss, weakness — lead to immense physical, emotional, social and financial strain, along with a constant fear of recurrence and death,” she says. Changes to appearance, she adds, often trigger anxiety and depression. “‘Chemo brain’, or brain fog, is also part of the territory.”Chatterjee recalls days when she told her doctor she couldn’t do another chemo cycle. “He understood. He knew that in three days, I’d feel differently.” That reassurance — from doctors and fellow survivors — mattered enormously.While psychological counselling is not routinely integrated into many hospitals, it is increasingly being recognised as an essential part of cancer care. Priyadarshini Deo, counsellor at the Centre for Cancer and Palliative Care at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, points to studies showing that humour and movement-based activities can significantly enhance emotional health. “Humour and lightness reduce stress, ease anxiety, improve communication and strengthen relationships, especially with caregivers,” she says.A case for lightness arrives in actor Lisa Ray’s memoir Close to the Bone, in which she recalls the day she was diagnosed with cancer by a “jittery, rabbit-faced doctor”. “He spoke very slowly, pausing for a long time between each word, as if to gauge my reaction. You. Have. Multiple. Myeloma.” The doctor, Ray writes, reminded her of the rabbit in ‘Alice in Wonderland’. “As he kicked me down the hole, he never said the word ‘cancer’. ”“Oh,” Ray replied. “Do you want me to get you some water?”Her response, she writes, might seem strange. “But he did look parched. Also, it never occurred to me that I wouldn’t get better… I was framing it as just another adventure.”Apart from music, what sustained Chatterjee after her diagnosis was community. “I cried alone in my car with my reports,” she says. “My sister told me — you can’t save yourself alone.” Friends video-called her and joked about everything from Trump’s antics to local absurdities. “It helped me sleep. It made me feel light.”Why, we ask her, is cancer so often portrayed in popular culture only through despair and solemnity? “Because it usually comes from an external perspective, not lived experience,” Chatterjee says. “I think there’s a fear — how can I be sensitive (towards the topic)? I was fearless because it’s me.”The play does not trivialise her struggles, including her prolonged insurance battles. Her arguments with an automated voice convey her frustration. “The day my insurance refused me, I was at my lowest. The treatment is excruciatingly expensive. I’m not a commercial actor. I’m an alternative, arthouse actor. I’m not rolling in money. And I have a mother and a daughter to take care of,” says Chatterjee. Her daughter lived with the actor’s sister in the US during treatment.Care for the caregiver, too, is crucial, Dr Parmar reminds us. “There is emotional burnout, financial strain and disrupted routines. Clear communication, shared decision-making and emotional support make the biggest difference.” She urges the integration of psychological and financial support into standard cancer care. “Good healthcare at an affordable cost is a right.”“My doctors told me this isn’t just about cancer,” Chatterjee says. “In any illness, people should watch it — to see how art, music, laughter and community are therapeutic.”The audience response suggests the message has landed. Survivors have cried and laughed in equal measure. Caregivers have recognised themselves. Those who have lost loved ones have found something gentler than grief alone. Hashmi’s wife has seen the play three times. “She loved it,” he says.","‘Breast of Luck’ is a play whose protagonists choose to sing, dance and laugh their way through the grimness of cancer.

RAIPUR: A woman who chooses to live separately from her husband and in-laws without valid and sufficient reason is not entitled to a maintenance allowance, Chhattisgarh high court has ruled, upholding the order of the Bilaspur family court.The judgment came on Jan 27 on a petition filed by the wife of a Bilaspur resident, challenging the family court’s order refusing her maintenance.A bench headed by Chief Justice Ramesh Sinha held that the family court’s order showed no illegality or defect warranting interference by the HC.The HC noted that when the husband had filed a petition seeking restitution of conjugal rights, the woman could have returned to her matrimonial home to resume marital life. She did not, and in such circumstances, the court held, she cannot claim maintenance.The woman had also alleged harassment for dowry by her husband and his family members. She claimed that just four days after marriage, she was asked to bring a car and Rs 10 lakh, assaulted and subjected to verbal, physical and mental cruelty.","A woman who chooses to live separately from her husband and in-laws without valid and sufficient reason is not entitled to a maintenance allowance, Chhattisgarh high court has ruled.

Who benefits more?

Short term:

Long term:

Thetrading Roki Sasaki to theforis not tied to any confirmed talks, but the idea has gained attention this offseason. The scenario reflects two teams with different priorities. Los Angeles is built to compete for titles now, while Detroit is still shaping a roster for the future.If a deal like this were completed, both pitching staffs would change immediately. The Dodgers would add one of the league’s most reliable starters, and the Tigers would receive a younger pitcher who could anchor their rotation for years. It is a classic exchange of present value for long-term control.Most projections follow a similar structure.• LHP Tarik Skubal (29, entering his final pre-free-agency season in 2026).• RHP Roki Sasaki (24, signed in 2025 with multiple years of team control).• One or two high-level prospects, likely close to the majors.Since Skubal is approaching free agency and Detroit is not yet a clear contender, the Tigers would likely demand players who can contribute soon. Sasaki fits that requirement because he is already progressing toward a full major-league role.The Los Angeles Dodgers project strong depth with Blake Snell, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Sasaki, and additional options such as Bobby Miller, Gavin Stone, and Michael Grove. Adding Skubal, a two-time Cy Young winner with a sub-2.00 ERA across recent seasons, would further stabilize the group.A rotation led by Skubal, Snell, and Yamamoto would give Los Angeles several postseason-caliber starters even after trading Sasaki.Tarik Skubal is projected to earn around $32 million through arbitration before becoming a free agent after the 2026 season. For the Los Angeles Dodgers, that is a manageable one-year commitment if it improves their chances of winning.Tarik Skubal enters his age-29 season and could command a contract exceeding $300 million if his performance continues. For a team still building toward contention, that level of commitment carries risk.• A 29-year-old Cy Young winner nearing free agencyfor• A 24-year-old starter with several years of control.Roki Sasaki’s minor-league results and brief MLB appearances point to strong strikeout ability and upper-90s velocity, though he has yet to prove himself across a full season.Detroit Tigers’ reported asking price suggests the club wants multiple premium assets. A package centered on Sasaki would help rebuild organizational depth, remove a possible $30 million-plus arbitration salary, and align the roster with a later competitive window.• Add a proven frontline starter.• Avoid a long-term contract commitment.• Maintain rotation depth.• Lose a young pitcher with long-term upside.• Take on a large arbitration salary.• Risk losing Skubal after one season.• Gain a younger starter with team control.• Avoid a costly arbitration year and future contract.• Add additional prospects.• Trade one of the league’s top pitchers.• Depend on Sasaki’s development and health.• Possibly extend the rebuild timeline.The age gap explains the logic behind the proposal. Detroit would prioritize long-term value, while Los Angeles would focus on immediate results.The Dodgers would likely benefit first. A rotation featuring Skubal, Snell, and Yamamoto would raise their chances of another title.Detroit could come out ahead if Sasaki develops into a frontline starter while remaining cost-controlled through his prime.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Yankees potentially land $5 million Arizona Diamondbacks in a blockbuster deal to support Trent Grisham ahead of deadline Overall: The result would depend on performance and health. A championship would justify the Dodgers’ decision, while Sasaki reaching ace level would make the trade a key step in Detroit’s rebuild. Both teams could meet their goals, but on different timelines.",The Los Angeles Dodgers and Detroit Tigers could make a deal for Roki Sasaki. Skubal is a two-time Cy Young winner with a sub-2.00 ERA across recent seasons. Sasaki is already progressing toward a full major-league role. The Dodgers would add one of the league’s most reliable starters.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127850236,imgsize-71110,width-400,resizemode-4/colorado-rockies-at-los-angeles-dodgers.jpg"

Gabrielle Union responds to Kaavia James’ adorable query during GOAT movie promotions

Gabrielle Union reveals her experience of playing ‘Jett Fillmore’ in GOAT

Dwayne Wade’s daughter, Kaavia James, decided to steal the spotlight and ask Gabrielle Union an adorable question. It was during the promotional interview for the upcoming movie, GOAT. Gabrielle appeared on one of the episodes of Today with Jenna and Sheinelle when her daughter asked the question. Kaavia’s query was both simple and innocent at the same time. She wanted to know why her mother opted for the movie.The movie has been scheduled for release on February 13, 2026. Several noted figures from the world of basketball have lent their voices to the film. It includes Stephen Curry, Dwyane Wade and even WNBA stars like Angel Reese. As the release date comes nearer, the promotions are increasing and the public appearances of these stars have become more frequent.The love shared between Dwyane Wade, his wife Gabrielle Union and their daughter Kaavia James is incomparable. Often, their posts on social media have received immense love from the fans. Recently, Gabrielle experienced one such public gesture featuring her daughter Kaavia. It was during the promotional interview of the American actress in a recent episode of Today with Jenna and Sheinelle. Kaavia made a surprise appearance during the interview and posed a question for her mother.She said, “Hi, my name is Kaavia and I want to ask you some questions. Why did you want to be in GOAT, mommy? It is about animals but why?”Gabrielle got visibly surprised and emotional as she started her response. She stated, “Oh my gosh! Well okay, she knows I love animals. I forced her [Kaavia] to go to this farm that saves farm animals. It was like a farm animal rescue and she was like, ‘I hate it here.’” Gabrielle imitated Kaavia’s expression and further added, “I am an animal lover, but it’s also, you know, a take on basketball. But the game is called Roarball. And it's about underdogs and learning that you should never let anyone put a ceiling on your dreams. And anyone is capable of doing amazing things with their lives if just given a chance and a bit of encouragement.”In another interview, Gabrielle Union was asked about her experience of playing the character of Jett Fillmore in the upcoming GOAT movie. The American actress stated, “She is this big cat [Jett] and I am a dog person. So just like how she moves and how bigger entity taking up a different amount of space…it was very much of a challenge.” She further added, “I studied my husband, I studied Bron, I studied Teresa Witherspoon and I tried to get a lot of how they play. How to play bigger than they were.” Now we know where Gabrielle got the inspiration from to play a character totally opposite to her.","Kaavia James asked her mother why she wanted to be in GOAT.

Poll Do you support Pakistan's decision to boycott the T20 World Cup match against India? Yes No

As the status quo continues over Pakistan's boycott of the T20 World Cup fixture against India in Colombo on February 15, TimesofIndia.com has reliably learnt that the next 48 hours are very crucial on the matter and some movement can be expected.While the Pakistan government has cleared the national cricket team to travel to Colombo for the World Cup, the boycott of just one game against India is set to be highlighted as a violation of the contract co-signed by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).""PCB is violating a contract that itself is a co-signee of. It states that India and Pakistan agree to participate in ICC events and play against each other at neutral venues. There is no force majeure clause in that agreement,"" explains a source tracking developments.The International Cricket Council's (ICC) Terms of Participation state that a Full Member (FM) nation must make every effort to mitigate concerns, if any, cited by the government. This is likely to be mentioned when a dialogue happens between the ICC and PCB representatives in the coming days, and PCB could be asked to exhibit their efforts on the same.Additionally, since the Pakistan government singled out the game against India, ICC representatives could question whether this is a new policy applying to all sports.""As only one match has been singled out, there needs to be clarity whether the Pakistan government has said no to any sporting activity with India,"" added the source.It is learned that Pakistan could face sanctions because its government is interfering in the affairs of a sporting body affiliated with the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Nothing like this has happened before in cricket.On Sunday the Government of Pakistan had initiated the chain of events by issuing a statement which read: ""The Government of Islamic Republic of Pakistan grants approval to the Pakistan cricket team to participate in the ICC World T20 2026. However, the Pakistan cricket team shall not take the field in the match scheduled on 15th February, 2026 against India.""While the PCB had not communicated with the ICC on the matter, the global cricket body issued a statement questioning the ""position of selective participation.""""While the ICC awaits official communication from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), this position of selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule.""ICC tournaments are built on sporting integrity, competitiveness, consistency and fairness, and selective participation undermines the spirit and sanctity of the competitions,"" stated the release.",Pakistan could face sanctions because its government is interfering in the affairs of a sporting body affiliated with the International Olympic Committee.

Are India favourites to win 2026 T20 World Cup? | Greenstone Lobo makes a HUGE PREDICTION

NEW DELHI: Defending champions India will walk into the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup as firm favourites, and few voices carry more weight on the subject than Mahendra Singh Dhoni . The former India captain, who famously led the side to the inaugural T20 World Cup title in 2007, believes the hosts have all the ingredients required to go deep in the tournament, while also underlining the fine margins that can undo even the strongest teams in the shortest format.India, led by Suryakumar Yadav , open their campaign against the United States at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium on Saturday. The top-ranked side arrives on the back of a dominant 4-1 series win over New Zealand, extending their run to nine consecutive bilateral T20 series victories and reinforcing their status as pre-tournament favourites on home soil.Explaining why Team India stands out, Dhoni said: “It's one of the most dangerous teams. You know, they would have already started, batting or bowling. But what all is needed in a good team and everything is there. They have the experience. Especially when it comes to this format, the experience is vast. They have played under pressure. Whoever is playing, whatever roles they are playing in the team, they have been in that situation for a considerable period of time. ”However, Dhoni was quick to point out his biggest concern ahead of the tournament.“What worries me again, I hate dew. Dew changes a lot of things. So even when I was playing something that really scared me was dew where the toss becomes crucial and all of that,” he said. “If you are playing 10 matches with some of the best teams, we will come out as winners more often than not if the conditions remain, condition is neutral and all of that. ”Dhoni also highlighted the unpredictability that defines T20 cricket. “The problem is when some of your players have a day off and somebody from the opposition has a brilliant day. And it can happen in T20 cricket,” he said, stressing the importance of timing and luck. “Whether it happens in a league stage, whether it happens in the knockout stage, that's where all the prayings are needed. Nobody should get injured. Whatever roles are given, people should accomplish their roles for the team. ”He signed off with a familiar note of caution: “And if that's the case, I don't want to jinx it by saying anything but it's one of the most dangerous teams.”",Dhoni believes India have all the ingredients to go deep in the tournament.

Samson was picked to open alongside Abhishek Sharma, replacing Kishan at the top of the order.The New Zealand T20I series had presented Samson with a chance to cement his spot after returning to the opening role following a three-month gap. However, he managed just 46 runs at an average of 9.20. Kishan, in contrast, amassed 215 runs at an impressive average of 53.75 and a strike rate of 231.18, highlighted by a century in the fifth T20I.Reigning champions India will head into the T20 World Cup as strong favourites on home soil.Led by Suryakumar Yadav , India open their campaign against the United States at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium on Saturday.On paper, India look well placed to defend their title. Since lifting the 2024 T20 World Cup after defeating South Africa in the final, they have won 33 of their 41 T20Is, losing just six.Their recent 4–1 home series victory over New Zealand further showcased the team’s depth and adaptability in familiar conditions.Abhisehk Sharma, Sanju Samson, Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Rinku singh, Axar Patel, Varun Chakaravarthy, Jasprit BumrahSuryakumar Yadav (c), Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, Sanju Samson, Shivam Dube, Ishan Kishan, Hardik Pandya, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Harshit Rana, Varun Chakaravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Rinku Singh","Chahal opted for Sanju Samson over Kishan, even though Samson has been struggling for runs.

Poll How do you think Axar Patel's injury history will impact India's performance in the T20 World Cup? It will be a major setback. It will motivate him to perform better. It won't affect the team's performance. It will only affect his individual performance.

In April 2024, on the sidelines of a Delhi Capitals event in the national capital, Axar Patel was asked about his chances of making it to the T20 World Cup. “Aapko toh maloom hai ki main har World Cup se pehle injured ho jaata hoon (You guys know my history, I get injured before every World Cup),” pat came the reply from the India all-rounder. It brought a smile to everyone’s lips but after a while, when it sank in, one could sense the pain behind Axar’s comment.Axar’s childhood friend Keval Patel bursts into laughter while sharing the text he sent his buddy after the 32-year-old injured his bowling finger attempting a return catch in the first T20I against New Zealand.(laughs). I messaged him to be careful, the World Cup is ahead, and there is a lot of cricket,” Keval tells TimesofIndia.com from Nadiad in Gujarat.Behind the laughter, one could sense the tension that had gripped Axar’s close circle back home. Keval had seen a similar script unfold in 2023 when Axar got injured and missed the ODI World Cup at home. And he was not ready for another heartbreak.The absolute low of 2023 was followed by a dream run for Axar as he featured in the title-winning 2024 T20 World Cup squad, played a stellar knock in the final, and followed it up with a Champions Trophy title in 2025.In between, Axar became a father with the arrival of 'Chota Patel'. Axar and his wife were blessed with a baby boy in December 2024 and, in Keval’s words, the toddler is the heartbeat of the entire clan. A group that once spent its time playing PlayStation now spends it with Haksh.(We still sit the same way, but now Axar brings his son along and all the time goes there. We keep playing with him),” says Keval.While Axar’s close circle has watched many of his games from the stands, it will be a World Cup debut of sorts for his son. Keval plans to take 'Chotu' to the ground for one of the matches.(I have watched many matches. 'Chotu' has also watched a Delhi Capitals IPL game. But this time, it will be his first World Cup. We haven’t decided which match yet, but Axar knows we will be there together),” Keval shares.Axar flies under the radar most of the time, but his contributions with both bat and ball make him an integral part of the side. He remains the underrated cog in a star-studded Indian line-up. Brick by brick, the 32-year-old has grown in stature. He is the captain of Delhi Capitals and the deputy to Suryakumar Yadav in India’s T20I set-up.“Axar has been with us since 2019. He is an excellent reader of the game. He is a fun-loving character who keeps things light, but not many have noticed his game-reading skills and the way he thinks about cricket,” Venugopal Rao , Delhi Capitals’ director of cricket, tells this outlet.Rao also revealed how Axar won the captaincy race despite the presence of experienced campaigners like Faf du Plessis and KL Rahul.“When captaincy was discussed, Rahul was there and Faf was there, but everyone was convinced about Axar because even the Indian team had started taking note of his leadership abilities,” says Rao.Rao’s first meeting with Axar came when the all-rounder was making waves in the age-group circuit for Gujarat and was known as the “Jayasuriya of Nadiad” because of his strokeplay.He recalls a fascinating episode from the 2013-14 Ranji Trophy season, when Axar was thrown into the deep end in a crucial fixture against Delhi. Rao and then Gujarat captain Parthiv Patel , agreed on the need to include a left-arm spinner against a star-studded Delhi batting line-up featuring Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Mithun Manhas and Rajat Bhatia.“I remember discussing it with Parthiv. We knew Axar from the age-group circuit and felt a left-arm spinner was essential. I scored a hundred, Parthiv got a half-century, but it was Axar who stood out. He took six wickets in the first innings and made vital runs to give us the first-innings lead,” Rao recalls.The performance did not go unnoticed. Axar was picked by the Punjab Kings at the IPL auction and soon earned a national call-up. Months later, he made his ODI debut for India against Bangladesh in June 2014.“He made an immediate impact. He did well against a strong Delhi side and got his rewards. There was no looking back after that,” Rao adds.From the teenager Rao saw in 2013 to the match-winner he has worked with at Delhi Capitals, much has changed. Yet, much has remained the same. Axar has matured significantly, but his mantra of keeping things simple remains intact.“With the greatest cricketers, it’s about how simple they keep things. Axar has mastered that and has only matured with time,” explains Rao.Back in Nadiad, little has changed. He is still the same Axar Keval grew up with. Having lived through the highs and lows of his childhood friend’s career, Keval says one thing has never changed: Axar’s humility.(He is very down-to-earth. Nothing has changed. Outside the cricket field, he is still the same Axar as before),” says Keval.During the 2023 ODI World Cup, Axar was confined to watching matches on television. His friends sensed the turmoil he must have been going through. Their plan was simple: PlayStation, card games and plenty of laughter to keep his spirits up.(We knew he was sad on the inside. It was a huge stage. We would sit everyday and distract him),” Keval says.Axar carries the air of someone who has endured more than his share of misfortune. For over a decade, he has lived in Ravindra Jadeja’s shadow and missed major tournaments due to injuries. Yet, his tenacity has kept him going. A self-made cricketer, he has squeezed every ounce of his talent.He has won ICC titles, but this time, he will have a new supporter in 'Chota Patel' cheering from the stands. Axar now has the task of making his son’s first World Cup memorable by helping India lift the trophy once again.",Axar Patel's injury history will motivate him to perform better. It won't affect the team's performance. It will only affect his individual performance. Keval had seen a similar script unfold in 2023 when Axar got injured and missed the ODI Cup at home. He was not ready for another heartbreak.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127898028,imgsize-52072,width-400,resizemode-4/axar-patel-3.jpg"
Reports: Giannis Antetokounmpo hesitant on Warriors move due to ‘Durant effect’ concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/reports-giannis-antetokounmpo-hesitant-on-warriors-move-due-to-durant-effect-concerns/articleshow/127891252.cms,"Giannis Antetokounmpo and Kevin Durant

Giannis Antetokounmpo doesn’t want to become the second Kevin Durant

Warriors aging roster puts off Giannis Antetokounmpo

As the February 5 trade deadline approaches, everyone’s eyes are fixed on the deteriorating relationship between Giannis Antetokounmpo and Milwaukee Bucks. While rumours are flying around about Golden State Warriors’ interest in acquiring the two-time NBA MVP, but a recent intel from The People's Insider, Jake Fischer, suggests that the picture of Giannis walking on the Chase Center hardwood in Warriors’ jersey is far from certain. Fischer indicated that, as per some inside sources, the Greek Freak shows hesitation in joining a team with an aging roster and the heavy dependence on a single player.Reporter Jake Fischer shared that a significant hurdle in the potential Giannis Antetokounmpo deal involves the looming shadow of Warriors’ former superstar, Kevin Durant. During Durant’s three seasons with Golden State (2016–2019), he secured two championships and two Finals MVPs, with an average of 25.8 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 5.4 assists per game while shooting with an efficiency of 52.4% from the floor and 88.3% from the free throw line. But other than the ring-chasing criticism, the internal conflicts led to his leaving the team in 2019 while nursing an ACL injury.Understanding the stature and presence that Stephen Curry carries on the court Fischer stated, “League sources say that Golden State is aware of recent rumblings that Antetokounmpo can't be assumed to be as eager as he was once perceived to be to relocate to Stephen Curry's town and team.How credible are such rumblings? Presumably only Giannis knows for sure. Yet I have heard from sources briefed on the situation that some in the know suspect Antetokounmpo could be turned off by the idea of joining an older team and/or facing the sort of criticism that Kevin Durant continues to absorb to this day about teaming up with Curry. ”Antetokounmpo, who averaged 28.0 points, 10.0 rebounds and 5.6 assists in 30 games he played this season, reportedly values a career path that prioritizes leading instead of playing under a shadow. And with Warriors, Stephen Curry remains the undisputed cultural icon and the focal point of their playmaking.Playing under Curry’s legendary stature is just one of the problems. The Golden State Warriors’ aging roster has turned off Giannis. The team is currently 8th in the Western Conference with a 27-23 record. In their last 10 games, they have only managed to win 6 of those contests. With a playing core that is past hitting the late 30s: Stephen Curry (37), Jimmy Butler (36 and sidelined due to ACL), Draymond Green (35) and Al Horford (39), Warriors championship dreams are based on players approaching Father Time.Despite Milwaukee’s struggling at 18-29, Giannis, who is currently sidelined after a self-diagnosed calf-strain in late January, is seeking a championship window that won't slam at least shut within the next 24 months. For a player who just turned 31 this season, the idea of a veteran-heavy roster may not be the favor he’s looking for.",Giannis Antetokounmpo doesn’t want to become the second Kevin Durant to leave the Golden State Warriors.

Pro Bowl selections raise eyebrows

How the Pro Bowl has changed over time

Justin Fields has reportedly declined an invitation to the Pro Bowl Games, choosing instead to focus on offseason training after a difficult year with the New York Jets. According to reports, hie was asked to join the AFC roster after several quarterbacks ahead of him opted out. However, the 26-year-old decided not to participate, saying he wanted to concentrate on improving his game ahead of the 2026 season.His numbers this past season were unexceptional. He played nine games, throwing for 1,259 yards and seven touchdowns, with one interception. He also added 383 rushing yards and four scores on the ground. The Jets went 2-7 in games he started, and he was eventually benched.Fields’ reported invitation has sparked debate among fans about the current value of the Pro Bowl. Several top quarterbacks were originally selected, including Josh Allen of the Buffalo Bills, Justin Herbert of the Los Angeles Chargers and Drake Maye of the New England Patriots. However, availability issues meant replacements were needed.Among the AFC quarterbacks set to represent the conference are rookie Shedeur Sanders, Joe Burrow and veteran Joe Flacco. Sanders threw more interceptions than touchdowns in limited action this season, while Flacco split time between teams.Burrow returned late in the year after injury.With several players declining to take part, the selection process has come under criticism. Many fans have questioned whether the Pro Bowl still reflects true on-field performance or if it has become more about availability.In recent years, the Pro Bowl has shifted from a traditional full-contact game to a mix of skill challenges and a flag football matchup. While the format aims to reduce injury risk and increase entertainment, it has also changed how the event is viewed.For some supporters, the idea that Fields after a tough season was even considered highlights how much the event has changed. Others believe his decision to focus on training was the right move, especially as his future with the Jets remains uncertain.He is still under contract, but reports suggest New York could explore other quarterback options this offseason. With limited standout prospects in the upcoming draft, the franchise faces key decisions.For now, Fields has chosen preparation over participation. Whether that decision helps him revive his career next season remains to be seen but it has once again put the Pro Bowl under the spotlight.","Justin Fields has reportedly declined an invitation to the Pro Bowl Games.

Jalen Brunson's Latest injury report vs Washington Wizards (February 3, 2026)

Why his availability matters for the New York Knicks

How to track the final decision

Jalen Brunson is expected to play for the New York Knicks against the Washington Wizards on February 3, 2026, though his availability is not certain. He is listed as questionable with an illness, but most pregame projections suggest he will play unless there is a late change before tip-off.The questionable tag usually signals a short-term issue rather than a serious health concern. In this case, there is no indication of a long-term injury, and the current expectation is that Brunson will be in the starting lineup if he feels well enough to play.The newest Knicks-Wizards injury report shows Jalen Brunson dealing with an illness instead of the right ankle sprain that kept him out earlier in January. That injury forced him to miss two games, but he has already returned and resumed normal minutes.He looked comfortable in his most recent appearance against the Los Angeles Lakers on February 1, recording 12 points and 13 assists. The performance suggested the ankle is no longer limiting him.The shift from an ankle injury to an illness points to a day-to-day situation. Players are often labeled questionable when they are under the weather but still have a chance to play.If Jalen Brunson plays, he will continue to run the offense as New York Knicks’ primary ball-handler.He is averaging 27.2 points and 6.1 assists this season while shooting 47.2 percent from the field and 38.2 percent from three-point range.That production is important against a Wizards defense that has had trouble containing scoring guards. Brunson has also performed well against Washington in previous matchups.With him on the floor, the Knicks can operate their pick-and-roll offense more effectively, especially with Karl-Anthony Towns. His passing also helps create open shots for players like Landry Shamet and Josh Hart.If Brunson is ruled out, the Knicks would likely rely more on Hart and Miles McBride to handle the ball. That change could slow the offense and increase the scoring burden on Towns, while giving Washington’s younger guards a chance to push the pace.Since Jalen Brunson is officially questionable, the final update may come close to game time. The New York Knicks typically release their final injury report about 90 minutes before tip-off, and team reporters usually confirm active players shortly afterward.If Brunson is active, he is expected to start at point guard. If he cannot play, New York will need to adjust its guard rotation. Current information suggests Jalen Brunson is likely to play against the Wizards, though his illness leaves some uncertainty. Unless there is a late change, the Knicks should have their lead guard available.","Jalen Brunson is expected to play for the New York Knicks against the Washington Wizards on February 3, 2026.

Artemi Panarin Trade Rumors Heat Up as Tampa Bay Emerges as Potential Destination Ahead of Roster Freeze,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/artemi-panarin-trade-rumors-heat-up-as-tampa-bay-emerges-as-potential-destination-ahead-of-roster-freeze/articleshow/127890451.cms,"Artemi Panarin with the Rangers (Via Getty Images)

Roster freeze for Olympic break temporarily halts Artemi Panarin sweepstakes.

Artemi Panarin continues to remain one of the hottest would-be free agents in the league right now. Multiple teams have already made it clear that they would like the Rangers forward among their lineup, and the Russian superstar’s agent is already in conversation with many clubs.But his demand for a $50 million contract has made it complicated for all six teams interested in the sweepstakes. Each brings something or the other to the table that the 34-year-old would prefer. But all teams would have to wait till 22nd February if they want anything done.With tomorrow's 3 p.m. roster freeze closing in ahead of the Olympic break, time is running short for teams to finalize a deal that could reshape the playoff race. The Athletic's Vincent Z. Mercogliano outlined the landscape surrounding Artemi Panarin's potential trade from the Rangers.""Maybe there's a team I'm missing, but I've got a list of 6 who seem to be in it, to varying degrees and for varying reasons,"" Mercogliano wrote. “Panarin's top choices if they can swing the extension: FLA, TBL. Best cap situation to offer the extension: CAR, LAK. Most appealing assets to offer in return: SJS, WAS.""Florida and Tampa Bay represent Panarin's preferred destinations if either can navigate the significant financial hurdles involved. Panarin's close friendship with Sergei Bobrovsky makes the Panthers particularly attractive, though how either Florida team could accommodate his reported $50 million extension demands remains unclear.Carolina and Los Angeles possess the cleanest cap situations to offer the long-term extension Panarin is seeking before approving any trade. San Jose and Washington bring the most compelling prospect packages and draft capital to entice Rangers GM Chris Drury.Mercogliano noted growing speculation around the Lightning specifically, despite their cap challenges. ""If either Florida team can hit his $ ask, a big if, it's hard to think he wouldn't pick one of them,"" he wrote. ""FWIW, I've heard from a couple of people whose Tampa antennas are inching up.""The Lightning's interest carries particular significance given their championship pedigree and ability to navigate complex cap situations in the past. Panarin holds a full no-trade clause and wants an extension in place before approving any deal, giving him significant control over his destination.The 34-year-old forward has 57 points in 52 games this season for the Rangers, who sit last in the Eastern Conference at 21-22-6. Rangers management has held Panarin out of the lineup as they work to facilitate a trade before the Olympic roster freeze takes effect.The March 6 trade deadline looms beyond the Olympic break, but teams hoping to include Panarin in their playoff push need to act before Monday afternoon.",Artemi Panarin is one of the hottest would-be free agents in the league right now.

Grizzlies traded their defensive anchor Jaren Jackson Jr.

Memphis prioritizes draft capital



The Memphis Grizzlies have reportedly agreed to trade their defensive cornerstone, Jaren Jackson Jr., to the Utah Jazz while keeping their window open for any potential offers for the flying machine, Ja Morant. According to ESPN’s Shams Charania, the sweeping eight-player deal, finalized just 48 hours before the February 5, 2026, trade deadline, marks a turning point for both teams.Memphis is sending Jackson Jr., along with John Konchar, Jock Landale, and Vince Williams Jr., to Salt Lake City, in exchange for Jazz’s Walter Clayton Jr., Kyle Anderson, Georges Niang, and Taylor Hendricks, along with three future first-round picks.Jared Jackson Jr. is a 2-time NBA ALL-Star (2023, 2025) and NBA Defensive Player of the Year for 2022-23. His acquisition by the Utah Jazz shows their approach towards a more win-based model. Despite Grizzlies' struggling 15-35 record, Jared has proven his productivity. He’s currently averaging 19.2 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks per game while shooting 47.5% from the field and 35.9% from the arc. The 26-year old is also known for his elite rim protection, and is averaging 4 averaging 4.8 defensive rebounds and 0.9 offensive rebounds.He also led the league in blocks for two consecutive seasons (2022, 2023)In July 2025, Jaren Jackson Jr. agreed to a 5-year, $205 million contract as per Spotrac. But this deal begins next season, 2026-27, and will give him an annual salary of $49 million. He's set to earn $35 million under his current $104.7 million rookie extension contract.With Jackson’s addition to the roster, the Jazz would be aiming for next season’s playoff contention.For the Grizzlies, trading Jaren Jackson Jr. comes with the intention of a full-scale roster reset as the deal brings in essential draft capital. It includes Lakers' unprotected 2027 first-round pick, the most favorable 2027 pick from a pool of Cleveland, Minnesota, and Utah, and a 2031 Phoenix Suns first-round pick.Memphis also gained promising young talents like Taylor Hendricks and rookie Walter Clayton Jr., with Kyle Anderson returning to the franchise for a second stint.From the financial point of view, through the trade Grizzlies get a record-breaking $28.8 million trade exception, which gives the front office flexibility to negotiate future deals. The Memphis Grizzlies management now holds 13 first-round picks over the next seven years.","Jared Jackson Jr. is a 2-time NBA ALL-Star (2023, 2025) and NBA Defensive Player of the Year for 2022-23.

Denver has reached the playoffs more consistently in recent years, but Detroit’s current record reflects its progress this season.Detroit’s rebounding numbers and slightly higher offensive rating reflect a physical style built around Stewart and Harris. Denver’s offense continues to run through Jokić’s passing and Murray’s two-man actions.Denver’s chances depend on Jokić controlling the interior, Murray creating scoring chances, and the team converting open outside shots. Detroit Pistons is expected to focus on rebounding, use its frontcourt strength inside, and limit driving lanes to force tougher attempts.The Pistons are favored by about 3.5 to 4 points. The projected total is around 228 points, suggesting a game with steady scoring from both teams.Also read: Is Nikola Jokic playing tonight vs the Detroit Pistons?

Josh Allen’s post surgery photo with fan ignites fresh injury concerns in Buffalo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/josh-allens-post-surgery-photo-with-fan-ignites-fresh-injury-concerns-in-buffalo/articleshow/127893945.cms,"Image via Getty

What Josh Allen said about the surgery

Josh Allen is still recovering from foot surgery, but a recent photo with a fan has already created fresh concerns among Buffalo Bills supporters.Allen had surgery on his right foot after the 2025 season. He suffered a small fracture, known as a fifth-metatarsal avulsion, late in the year. The injury first showed up in Week 16 and got worse in the final games. Doctors expect him to need about eight to ten weeks to fully recover.The issue began when a Buffalo fan shared a picture with Allen online. In the photo, Allen did not appear to be wearing a protective boot. Some fans quickly questioned whether he was being careful enough during his recovery.The fan later explained what really happened. He said Allen had just stepped out of his car and was not walking around without protection for a long time. The quarterback signed his hat, took a photo and had a short conversation before leaving. The fan made it clear that Allen was not ignoring medical advice.Allen later spoke about the procedure. He said doctors removed a small broken bone and cleaned up the area. He described it as painful but not a major surgery. He also said that if he had to play a game that week, he would have found a way to do it.Even so, the Bills are expected to be careful with his recovery.He is the most important player on the team, and his health will be key for next season.Last year, he threw for 3,668 yards and 25 touchdowns despite dealing with injuries. The Bills had strong moments but once again failed to reach the Super Bowl. Fans are hoping next season will finally be different.The viral photo may have created noise, but insiders believe Allen remains on track for a full return during offseason workouts. The projected recovery window suggests he should be ready for organized team activities.For Buffalo fans, the bigger picture remains clear. Allen is the centerpiece of the franchise, and his health is critical if the team hopes to finally break through in the postseason.For now, a single photo has fueled online debate. But if recovery goes as planned, the focus will soon shift from injury concerns to another run at championship contention.","Josh Allen had surgery on his right foot after the 2025 season.

Pro Bowl 2026 payouts revealed: How much NFL stars really earn for playing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/pro-bowl-2026-payouts-revealed-how-much-nfl-stars-really-earn-for-playing/articleshow/127894245.cms,"NFL (Image Via Getty)

NFL Pro Bowl payouts put in perspective using Sam Darnold salary example

Making the Pro Bowl still means something in the NFL, even if the shine is not what it once was. In 2026, fans have noticed more players skipping the event or treating it like a bonus rather than a badge of pride. Still, one part of the Pro Bowl has not lost its value. The money is real, and for many players, it matters.So how much do players actually get paid for showing up? The answer depends on whether their team wins or loses. While stars with massive contracts may barely feel the difference, younger players and backups often see the Pro Bowl check as a meaningful boost. For them, it is a solid payout for a short appearance after a long season.For the 2026 Pro Bowl, every player who takes part earns money. Players on the winning side receive $92,000 each. Those on the losing side still walk away with $46,000.That is payment for a few days of practices and one game that avoids full contact. To understand what that really means, it helps to look at regular NFL pay.The minimum NFL salary for the 2025 season was set at about $840,000 for rookies. Spread across an 18-week season, that works out to a little over $46,600 per week.That means even players on the losing Pro Bowl team earn more than a typical week’s pay for minimum-salary players.Now compare that to higher earners. Sam Darnold, the quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks, earns roughly $92,000 per day based on his contract.For players at that level, a Pro Bowl win pays about the same as one regular workday. It is nice, but not life-changing.Darnold will not be part of the Pro Bowl this year anyway, since the Seahawks are playing in the Super Bowl. Still, his case shows why some veterans feel indifferent about the event.The risk of injury can outweigh the reward. That said, the Pro Bowl still makes financial sense for many players.Role players, young starters, and first-time selections can see the check as a strong bonus at the end of the season. Even without the old prestige, the Pro Bowl continues to pay well for the time required.","NFL Pro Bowl payouts put in perspective using Sam Darnold salary example.

Rumors suggests Dallas Stars target Calgary Flames’ Nazem Kadri after Jeremie Poirier trade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/rumors-suggests-dallas-stars-target-calgary-flames-nazem-kadri-after-jeremie-poirier-trade/articleshow/127885479.cms,"Nazem Kadri (Image Via Twitter)

Dallas Stars reportedly eye Calgary Flames’ Nazem Kadri for trade



The Dallas Stars made a small but intriguing move earlier this week, acquiring 23-year-old defenseman Jeremie Poirier from the Calgary Flames in exchange for Gavin White. While both players have primarily played in the AHL, NHL insiders suggest this minor transaction could be a precursor to a much larger deal.Nazem Kadri, a veteran center for the Calgary Flames, is at the center of trade rumors. He has reportedly said he would be open to joining a contender before the NHL trade deadline. Kadri has three years left on his contract and a $7 million cap hit. His ability to score and toughness make him a good target for teams like the Stars that want to add depth to their top-six forwards.After Monday's 4-2 loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs, rumors about Nazem Kadri have reached a fever pitch. The center, who is 35 years old and was the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NHL Draft, has scored 316 goals and 745 points in 1,039 career games. Kadri has a minus-61 rating since joining Calgary before the 2022–23 season, but his proven scoring ability and playoff experience make him a player that teams want to have if they want to go deep in the playoffs.The Montreal Canadiens are said to be less interested, but the Dallas Stars, Carolina Hurricanes, Detroit Red Wings, and Minnesota Wild are still possible places for him to land. All four teams want to improve the depth of their top six forwards, and Kadri's style could fit in with any of these teams. The recent deal between Stars GM Jim Nill and Flames GM Craig Conroy could be a model for a future Kadri trade. This suggests that the Stars are quietly getting ready for a big roster change.But with trade rumors swirling, the NHL world will be watching closely to see if Dallas makes its move for Nazem Kadri before the deadline, potentially reshaping the team’s offensive strategy down the stretch.",Dallas Stars reportedly eye Calgary Flames’ Nazem Kadri for trade.

Barry Trotz Steps Down as Predators GM | Frankly Hockey

Barry Trotz steps down as Nashville Predators general manager



After nearly three decades in professional hockey, Barry Trotz has decided to step down as general manager of the Nashville Predators. Known for his meticulous approach to building competitive teams, Trotz informed majority owner Bill Haslam of his decision last December. While his choice is motivated by a desire to focus on family, he will remain with the organization until a successor is found, ensuring a smooth transition.In 2023, Trotz became the new general manager, taking over for David Poile, who had been in charge for a long time; Trotz made big moves in free agency, signing Stanley Cup winners Steven Stamkos and Jonathan Marchessault. As well as defenseman Brady Skjei, the team had a rough season in 2024–25 with 52 losses and not making the playoffs. He has always wanted to put together a team that can win the Stanley Cup, not just make it to the playoffs.Even though Trotz is about to retire, he will still be making decisions for the Nashville Predators until the NHL trade deadline on March 6. He will also be thinking about the futures of Steven Stamkos, Jonathan Marchessault, and Brady Skjei, all of whom have contracts that last for more than one year but are getting older.Trotz is confident that the team can stay competitive with new leadership because the core of the organization, which includes captain Roman Josi, top forward Filip Forsberg, and goaltender Juuse Saros, is still strong.Predators CEO Sean Henry praised Trotz's work to make Nashville a model NHL franchise both on and off the ice. Trotz’s legacy includes turning the expansion-era Predators into a respected team and winning a Stanley Cup with the Washington Capitals in 2018.

Patriots coach with a clear outlook

Team reflects Mike Vrabel’s winning mentality

With Super Bowl LX just days away, all eyes have been on the New England Patriots as they prepare to face the Seattle Seahawks in Santa Clara, California. But it wasn’t a game plan or injury update that grabbed the most attention during Patriots media day; it was one simple answer from head coach Mike Vrabel that quickly made headlines.When a reporter asked Vrabel a straightforward question about whether the Super Bowl was a “must-win” game, his response was short, direct and confident: “A must-win? Yeah. I think every time we go out, it’s a must-win game.” The comment, delivered without hesitation, resonated with fans by capturing his competitive mindset on football’s biggest stage.Vrabel’s comment was shared widely after media day. It reminded everyone that the Super Bowl is never just another game. For a coach in his first season with the Patriots, reaching the Super Bowl after a 14-3 regular season is already a big achievement.His words also reflect how he approaches the job. In the NFL, every game requires full preparation and focus. Vrabel has spoken many times about staying disciplined and treating each game seriously. The Patriots’ rise from a four-win season last year to a Super Bowl appearance this year has been one of the biggest turnarounds in the league.His direct style seems to connect well with his players. Quarterback Drake Maye, who threw for more than 4,300 yards this season, spoke confidently at media day about his health and preparation.Running back Rhamondre Stevenson and rookie TreVeyon Henderson also talked about adjusting to the NFL and preparing for their first Super Bowl. Their comments showed that the team understands the importance of the moment and is fully committed.There have been practices, press conferences, and media events all week leading up to Super Bowl LX. The Patriots are getting ready to play a tough Seahawks squad by being very conservative.Vrabel's answer may have seemed simple, but it meant a lot. People think the Patriots are the underdogs, but their coach isn't backing down from the battle. He makes it apparent that every game is a must-win when you're fighting for a title.","The New England Patriots are preparing to face the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl LX.

Ann Michael Maye Super Bowl week spotlight grows in Foxborough



Ann Michael Maye is making headlines as Super Bowl week arrives, blending fitness, fandom, and star power as New England prepares for its biggest night. With the Patriots set to face the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl 60, Maye marked the moment publicly, sharing a snapshot that captured both the mood of the week and her growing cultural presence around the team.The image, posted on her Instagram Story on Monday, showed Maye seated on a pilates reformer in a gray sports bra and matching leggings, her toned physique drawing instant attention. She captioned it, “Happy Super Bowl week!!! 🤍🤍“ The timing mattered. New England had just arrived in Santa Clara, where the Patriots will wear all white as the designated home team, while Seattle lines up in all college navy.The post was more than a fitness check in. It reflected how closely Ann Michael Maye has become woven into the Patriots’ Super Bowl narrative. She was present at the team’s send off rally at Gillette Stadium on Sunday, later sharing moments from the event on TikTok. A week earlier, she traveled to Denver to support Drake Maye during New England’s gritty 10 to 7 AFC Championship win over the Broncos.Her visibility has followed the quarterback’s breakout season. Drake Maye’s rise into MVP conversations pushed the Patriots back into the Super Bowl for the first time since 2019, and Ann’s profile rose alongside it.Fans in Foxborough quickly embraced her during the 2025 regular season, where her posts felt personal rather than polished, building a loyal following that now stands at 512,000 on TikTok.That audience first came for her baking. Ann became a viral hit through her “Bakemas” holiday series, which later opened the door to a bigger opportunity. Earlier this month, she announced “Beyond Bakemas,” a new show with NBC Sports Boston. The debut episode featured Barstool Sports founder and longtime Patriots fan Dave Portnoy, signaling her smooth crossover from social media to regional sports media. Represented by Creative Artists Agency, her brand now stretches well beyond the sidelines.Through it all, her support for Drake Maye has remained constant. She stood by him on draft night in 2024 when New England selected him third overall, a moment that capped a journey that began long before the NFL. The couple have been together since they were 12 years old and attended UNC together, a rare continuity in a league defined by change.Whether or not they attend NFL Honors later this week remains unclear. What is certain is that Ann Michael Maye has already set the tone for Super Bowl week, balancing spotlight moments with genuine connection as New England chases another title.",Ann Michael Maye is the wife of New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye.

‘No Dog in the Fight’: Tom Brady Refuses To Root for Patriots in Super Bowl LX: Here’s Why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/no-dog-in-the-fight-tom-brady-refuses-to-root-for-patriots-in-super-bowl-lx-heres-why/articleshow/127889073.cms,"Tom Brady discusses his Super Bowl LX rooting interest on the ‘Let’s Go!’ podcast with Jim Gray.

Tom Brady’s ‘no dog in the fight’ line lands like a gut punch for Patriots fans

Raiders ownership and Klint Kubiak ties make neutrality Brady’s safest play

Tom Brady has a 17-foot statue outside Gillette Stadium, six Super Bowl rings with the New England Patriots, and a fan base that still treats him like a religion. Days before Super Bowl LX, he made it clear he is not riding with them.On this week’s episode of the “Let’s Go!” podcast with Jim Gray, Brady said he will not be rooting for either the Patriots or the Seattle Seahawks when they kick off on Sunday. Instead, he is publicly choosing the safest and most awkward possible lane for the greatest Patriot of all time.Brady did not leave any room for spin when Gray asked where his allegiance sits for Patriots vs. Seahawks.“I don’t have a dog in the fight in this one. May the best team win,” Brady said on “Let’s Go!” “And in terms of the Patriots, this is a new chapter in New England, and I’m glad everyone’s embraced the Mike Vrabel regime, all the amazing players that have worked so hard to get their club to this position. We did it for 20 years. There was a little bit of a hiatus in there, but the Patriots are back and it’s a very exciting time for everyone in New England. ”For a fan base that just watched the team build a six-ton statue of Brady outside Gillette in the summer of 2025, that answer hits different. Patriots fans have every reason to expect their guy to lean publicly toward New England in its first Super Bowl trip since he left. Instead, Brady is drawing a hard line between his past and his present.He did not talk about payback, legacy, or “one more for the old team.” He talked about aesthetics and execution.“I just wanna see good football. I wanna see good plays, good throws, good strategy, good decisions,” Brady said.That is a very broadcaster answer, which fits where he is now. Brady is a lead analyst for FOX, a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, and the unofficial face of the modern NFL product. Sliding into neutral, at least in public, keeps him clean with everybody.The part that will still sting in New England is that this is not coming from some distant alum. Brady just had his Patriots Hall of Fame induction last year and saw that statue go up outside the stadium he helped turn into a Super Bowl factory. Those ties are still fresh.Brady’s explanation makes it clear he sees those years as a closed book, not an ongoing obligation.“I think there’s always different chapters in your life and you have different chapters and moments that you go through where you’re affiliated with a certain team,” Brady said. “At Michigan, and then I was with the Patriots for 20 years. I was with Tampa for three amazing years. I’ve been in broadcasting. Now I’m an owner of the Raiders.”Once he runs through that résumé, the rest of his stance makes more sense.“So those memories that I have are forever ingrained in me, and I’m indebted to all the people who worked so hard to help make our team successful,” Brady added. “And now in a different phase in my life, I really root for people and the people I care about, the people who I know the work that goes into what they’re trying to accomplish. So I really wanna sit back as a fan and enjoy the game, enjoy the moment.”He is not rooting for laundry anymore. He is rooting for relationships. For a lot of Patriots fans, that is exactly the problem.Brady’s stance is not just about “good football.” It is also about the job he holds now and the job someone else is about to bring into his building.Brady is a minority owner of the Raiders. That alone makes it tricky for him to go on a national platform and declare, on the record, that he is backing the Patriots over the Seahawks. His business brand is now tied to Las Vegas, not Foxborough.Layer on what is expected to happen next for Seattle’s offensive coordinator, and his neutral line starts to look less like fence-sitting and more like damage control.Multiple outlets have reported that Klint Kubiak is expected to leave the Seahawks after the Super Bowl to become the next head coach of the Raiders. If you are part of the ownership group that signed off on that move, going on the record and publicly cheering against your soon-to-be coach days before he walks into your locker room is not smart business.Brady did not say that explicitly, but the logic is obvious. If the Seahawks win, Kubiak walks into Las Vegas with a fresh ring and a little more authority in front of a roster that has not seen a Lombardi since the early 1980s. If the Seahawks lose, Brady does not wear any of that on his face. Either way, staying neutral keeps his hands clean with Raiders players, coaches, and fans.At the same time, he still found space to publicly back the people he knows best in New England. Brady praised new Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel, who won three Super Bowls with him as a linebacker in New England, and longtime offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, who helped steer three of Brady’s title runs.“Josh McDaniels, who’s been a great friend of mine as well,” Brady said. “And again, you root for people and you want them to have great performances.”He is threading a needle here. Brady is telling Patriots fans he still loves the people in the building, telling Raiders fans he is not cheering against their incoming coach, and telling the league office he is above the tribal noise now.The quote that really sums up where he is in 2026 is not the headline line. It is this one.“I really root for people, and the people I care about,” Brady said. “I really want to sit back as a fan and enjoy the game, enjoy the moment and I always think, ‘May the best team win.’”","Tom Brady said he will not be rooting for either the Patriots or the Seattle Seahawks when they kick off on Sunday. “I don’t have a dog in the fight in this one.

With spring training just around the corner, ESPN has released its boldest projections for the 2026 MLB season. The list highlights the AL and NL prospects that are most likely to take a major step into the big leagues to compete for Rookie of the Year honors and climb the industry rankings. After recently publishing new Top 100 lists and farm-system evaluations, the analysts at ESPN have now condensed their thinking into specific player-by-player predictions, in a picture that presents an unusually talent-rich class of rookies.Evidenced to be an everyday player by midseason after having split time between shortstop and third base. According to ESPN, Buster Olney lauded him as the guy who is really good at so many things: command of the strike zone, bat speed, and baserunning. His triple slash line in the AFL hinted at greatness: .362/.500/.710.On track for a big league debut at 19 with the slashing of .281/.359/.551 in Double A as an 18-year-old. The switch-hitter's long-term role may be changing from shortstop to third base, but according to ESPN, a clear future exists for Vries in Oakland's developing lineup.Viewed as an October contributor in the MLB season if Seattle accelerates its timeline.Jesse Rogers compared his rise to that of Paul Skenes, calling for a four-pitch mix that is near major-league ready.Projected to be the best hitter in Cincinnati, with a good .860 OPS in late-season action and hits the ball hard (51.3% at 95+) and at the right angles (16.5° on 95+), making his numbers elite in terms of contact data in the minors and a staple in the middle order.Schoenfield expects Griffin to make the Opening Day Roster and have a rare 3-WAR rookie season, which sets him up as a frontrunner for Rookie of the Year.According to ESPN Prediction, Aidan can take the 3rd base job in Philadelphia by Memorial Day, and potentially force a trade of Alec Bohm after a projected .280, 20-HR, 25-SB stretch run.Another NL Rookie of the Year pick after flashing in the latter part of 2025, including winning four times in seven appearances, excluding a rocky start at .1.57 ERA.JJ Wetherholt, with his infield versatility, polished bat, and 20-20 upside that should translate to the majors quickly. ESPN analyst McDaniel added that now teams often choose between breaking camp with elite prospects or not calling them up until September in order to set up a Rookie of the Year push the following season.ESPN’s Jeff Passan predicts a leap into the Top 10 prospects, citing his centre-field defence, Corey Seager-like swing, and 35 steals in Low-A.Tipped to be this year's Cam Schlittler after a 3.53 ERA and 33.4% strikeout rate, with a chance of joining the bullpen in New York late in the season. ESPN's Tristan Cockcroft said better control will be critical to his success at the big league level, but noted Schlittler made similar adjustments in 2025.If these projections bear out, the 2026 season may shed one of the most interesting classes of rookies that baseball has seen in years, with multiple prospects set to reshape big league rosters well before the autumn months.","With spring training just around the corner, ESPN has released its boldest projections for the 2026 MLB season.

New York Rangers forward Matt Rempe opens up about mental struggle during thumb injury recovery,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/new-york-rangers-forward-matt-rempe-opens-up-about-mental-struggle-during-thumb-injury-recovery/articleshow/127888994.cms,"Matt Rempe with the New York Rangers (Via Getty Images)

Matt Rempe keeps himself in control, but he wants to get better soon

The New Rangers have been among the teams with the worst records this season. And three weeks back, during their home game against the visiting Buffalo, the franchise suffered yet another blowout loss. But one forward wasn’t satisfied with his efforts that night.Matt Rempe sat on the bench as he saw his side get beaten 5-2. With chances of a comeback looking uncertain and frustration, the forward seriously considered dropping his gloves and thought about taking a swing at the Sabres. But he didn’t, and on February 3, he finally revealed why.Rempe stopped himself on January 10, but the 23-year-old winger's admission reveals just how dark things became during his recovery from a broken thumb that threatened to derail his season with the Rangers. ""I was going to lose my mind,"" Rempe said of his mental state during the 10-2 loss to the Bruins. ""That wasn't a good place mentally.""The 6-foot-9 forward had returned to the lineup 12 games earlier after a nearly two-month absence, but his thumb still prevented him from gripping his stick properly. Smaller players out-battled him for pucks. He couldn't play the physical, menacing style that made him effective in a bottom-six role.After the team returned to New York, Rempe and coach Mike Sullivan had a frank conversation about his situation. They agreed he would continue practicing with the team but sit out games while his thumb healed further. It was a necessary step back.Rempe initially suffered the injury in an October fight with San Jose forward Ryan Reaves. His thumb got caught in Reaves' jersey during their bout and broke in ""many places,"" requiring surgery. He still has metal in his thumb from the operation and doesn't have full mobility despite constant efforts to bend and stretch it throughout each day.The mental toll of that first stint back from injury proved demoralizing. The Rangers managed only 50 percent of the five-on-five expected goal share with him on the ice, down significantly from his previous rates. Sullivan reduced his ice time from an average of 10:48 before the injury to just 8:52 per game.""I (couldn't) win battles and be a menace or anything at all,"" Rempe said. After receiving an injection to reduce pain and improve mobility following the Boston blowout, Rempe remained out two weeks for conditioning skates with healthy scratches.His thumb improved during the Rangers' recent California road trip, and he told Sullivan and team doctors he felt ready to be himself again. He returned to the lineup Jan. 26 against Boston, bringing nerves but also relief when he discovered he could protect pucks effectively again.""Now I can have confidence that I'm not going to just bobble a puck or drop my stick or feel like I'm skating on the ice with a hand grenade,"" said Rempe, who remains not cleared to fight. His four games back have shown mixed results, including being on ice for two Penguins goals Saturday in Pittsburgh.But Rempe is focused on finishing strong, hoping to bookend his season with quality play despite the difficult middle chapter. ""Then I can have a great start and great end,"" he said. ""Just a bump in the middle.""",The New York Rangers have been among the teams with the worst records this season.

Drake Maye leads Patriots to Super Bowl LX

Super Bowl LX Opening Night 🎙️ New England Patriots QB Drake Maye 🏈 NFL on FOX

What did Tom Brady's advice mean to Drake Maye?

The New England Patriots are back in the Super Bowl, and quarterback Drake Maye is leaning on advice from franchise legend Tom Brady ahead of Super Bowl LX.Speaking during Super Bowl Opening Night, Maye revealed the most important lesson he learned from the seven-time champion. “One of the best things he said was there’s no shortcuts to it,” Maye told reporters. “There’s no shortcuts to putting in the work. The proof’s in the pudding.” For a 23-year-old quarterback preparing for the biggest game of his life, the message is simple success only comes with hard work.Super Bowl LX will be played at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. The Patriots will face the Seattle Seahawks, renewing a rivalry that dates back to their dramatic meeting in Super Bowl XLIX, when Brady led New England to a 28-24 win.This time, the spotlight is on Maye. After a tough 4-13 rookie season, he has led a stunning turnaround in just his second year. The former North Carolina standout threw for 4,394 yards and 31 touchdowns in the regular season, helping the Patriots finish 14-3 and reach the championship game. His performances have made him an MVP finalist and sparked comparisons to Brady.However, Maye is not trying to copy Brady. Instead, he is focused on following the work ethic that made Brady great.“Getting the most out of what you put into it,” Maye said. “He’s been great at that and showed it throughout his career.”While Maye confirmed that he has not yet spoken to Brady since reaching the Super Bowl, he said it would mean a lot if the former Patriots star reached out. Brady has publicly praised Maye during the season, calling him humble and team-first qualities that defined his own career in New England.Brady won six Super Bowls with the Patriots and added another title with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He remains the gold standard in Foxborough, and any young quarterback stepping into this role will face comparisons.But Maye appears calm under pressure. As the Patriots chase what could be their seventh Super Bowl title, Maye understands the moment. With Brady’s advice in mind, no shortcuts, only hard work he now has a chance to write his own chapter in franchise history.",New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye reveals Tom Brady's advice ahead of Super Bowl LX.

Mike McCarthy and Aaron Rodgers plans take hit after Scott Tolzien decision

Things are not moving smoothly for the Pittsburgh Steelers right now. Just as Mike McCarthy settles into his new role, the team has hit an unexpected roadblock tied to its future quarterback plans. A coaching decision that seemed minor on the surface has now raised real questions about whether Aaron Rodgers ’ return to Pittsburgh can move forward as hoped.The issue centers on the Steelers’ search for an offensive coordinator. One name stood out early, and many around the league believed that hire could quietly help shape the quarterback room. That hope faded quickly this week. According to a trusted league source, the coach the Steelers wanted is no longer leaving his current team. That news has shifted the mood around Pittsburgh’s offseason plans.NFL insider Jordan Schultz reported that Scott Tolzien will stay put with the New Orleans Saints. Tolzien, who coaches quarterbacks in New Orleans, interviewed for the Steelers’ offensive coordinator job but decided not to make the move.Schultz shared the update on X, writing, “Sources: Saints QBs coach Scott Tolzien plans to remain in New Orleans after interviewing for the Steelers OC job.He was viewed as a top candidate for the job, but will remain with Kellen Moore to continue developing Tyler Shough.”For Steelers fans, that news landed hard. Tolzien’s past connection to Aaron Rodgers was seen as important. Some believed his presence in Pittsburgh could help smooth talks around Rodgers’ future and possibly an extension.With Tolzien staying in New Orleans, that link is now gone, and the path feels less clear. There is another layer to this situation.New head coach Mike McCarthy has already said he plans to call offensive plays himself. That choice limits how much control any offensive coordinator would have on game day.Around the league, that kind of setup can turn away experienced coaches who want a bigger voice. As a result, the Steelers may face a smaller pool of candidates willing to accept the role.That could slow down other decisions, including what happens next at quarterback. Nothing is final yet, but this setback has added pressure to an already delicate offseason in Pittsburgh.","NFL insider Jordan Schultz reported that Scott Tolzien will stay put with the New Orleans Saints.

Russell Wilson’s next landing spot could be as bridge quarterback for Kansas City Chiefs behind Patrick Mahomes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/russell-wilsons-next-landing-spot-could-be-as-bridge-quarterback-for-kansas-city-chiefs-behind-patrick-mahomes/articleshow/127861044.cms,"(Image via Getty: Russell Wilson)

Seattle Seahawks legend Russell Wilson should consider his post playing career

Worst landing spot would be Cleveland Browns

Russell Wilson wants to continue playing in the NFL

Not long ago, Mike Luciano of GMEN HQ shared that the New York Giants will focus on their now-no-longer-a-rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart for the 2026 season. Lior Lampert of GMEN HQ also stated that the Giants learned the hard way that nothing good comes from trying to squeeze the last bit of value out of veteran signal-caller Russell Wilson Long story short: New York wants Dart. Wilson’s one-year contract is over, and he is reportedly looking for another NFL team for 2026. With the Giants out of the picture, one team, according to Bleacher Report’s Kristopher Knox, is perfectly suited for the 37-year-old playmaker: Patrick Mahomes ’ Kansas City Chiefs. Let’s find out how.Knox shared that after losing a playoff spot with the Pittsburgh Steelers and struggling with the New York Giants, Wilson should consider moving to his “post-playing career.” This is where the bridge quarterback status comes in.A bridge quarterback is a veteran NFL player, often called a journeyman or former starter, who temporarily starts for a team while it develops a young rookie or builds its roster for future big games.For Andy Reid’s Chiefs, Mahomes is recovering from a torn ACL, and Gardner Minshew or Chris Oladokun are not under contract for 2026. Wilson could be a bridge QB for Kansas City.This would give the Chiefs a resurgence after a failed 2025 season [missed playoff appearance for the first time since 2014] and let Russell Wilson shift from a starting role to a backup phase of his career.Knox adds that if Wilson thinks he can secure a starting role and avoid a team like Kansas City, the worst place for him would be the Cleveland Browns.Cleveland may give Deshaun Watson a final chance to prove himself after missing the 2025 season or simply use him since he is being paid regardless. Wilson visited the Browns last offseason, but that was before Cleveland drafted two rookies: Shedeur Sanders and Dillon Gabriel.There would be a lot of QB competition for him this season. If he makes the roster, Knox says Wilson could be a short-term starter on a struggling team in Cleveland. At worst, “he’d be a camp arm who fails to make one of the worst offensive rosters in the NFL.”The ten-time Pro Bowler accumulated 831 passing yards, three touchdowns, and three interceptions in the six games played for the New York Giants in the 2025 season. He is a Super Bowl XLVIII champion and counted as a member of Seattle Seahawks' Top 50 Players.Wilson played in Super Bowl 49 as a Seahawk against Tom Brady's New England Patriots. He threw a pass to wide receiver Ricardo Lockette instead of running back Marshawn Lynch, and Patriots rookie cornerback Malcolm Butler intercepted it. New England won Super Bowl XLIX by a score of 28-24.“Oh, yeah, I’m not blinking,” Wilson said via Giants Videos. “I know what I’m capable of. I think I showed that in Dallas, and I want to be able to do that again. Just be ready to rock and roll, and be as healthy as possible, and be ready to play ball.I played that [Week 2] game. I tore my hamstring on Friday in practice, on the last play. I had a Grade 2 [tear]. I couldn’t tell anybody. I had to play on it because I knew the circumstances.No matter what, I ended up going to the Dallas Mavericks’ facility to train.

Khabib Nurmagomedov on Usman Nurmagomedov ’s growth and readiness for Ilia Topuria and Arman Tsarukyan





Khabib Nurmagomedov does not speak lightly. When he talks about fighters, the MMA world listens. This time, the former UFC champion has turned attention toward a new Dagestani name. Khabib believes this fighter is already at the level of the very best.The UFC lightweight division is stacked. Fighters like Ilia Topuria and Arman Tsarukyan sit near the top of a roster that includes more than 500 fighters. They are fast, skilled, and proven inside the Octagon.But now, Khabib says an undefeated fighter from Dagestan has reached that same level. According to him, the gap has closed. The statement is bold, but it comes from someone who helped build the Dagestani legacy in MMA.The fighter Khabib is talking about is his cousin, Usman Nurmagomedov. Usman is unbeaten and currently competing outside the UFC. He holds the PFL lightweight title and is in the strongest phase of his career.Speaking to MMA Team Gorilla Fighting, Khabib explained his view carefully.“I have my own opinion about this, but I think it would be inappropriate, as a UFC fighter, to speak about his strengths. If you look at it statistically, I think that over the past year, considering what happened with Usman, how much he has grown and gotten stronger… I work with him one-on-one,” Khabib said.Usman won the PFL lightweight title in October after defeating Paul Hughes in their rematch. Before that loss, Hughes was the Bellator lightweight champion and had defended his belt three times. The win added weight to Khabib’s words.Khabib continued, “From their side, I believe Usman has grown a lot. At least at this level. I think Usman is already at this level. A year ago, I would have said we needed to wait, but right now, I believe he is at this level. Time will tell.”Still, history shows that success outside the UFC does not always carry over. Fighters like Patchy Mix and Kai Asakura entered the UFC with big reputations but struggled against elite competition. The UFC remains the hardest test in MMA.Dagestan has produced champions before. Khabib passed the torch to Islam Makhachev. Umar Nurmagomedov has also risen. Now, Usman may be next. Whether he reaches the UFC or not, Khabib’s words have already changed the conversation.","Khabib Nurmagomedov believes his cousin, Usman, is already at the level of the very best.

Former NHL player Paul Bissonnette slams league schedule amid wave of Olympic-related injuries to top stars,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/former-nhl-player-paul-bissonnette-slams-league-schedule-amid-wave-of-olympic-related-injuries-to-top-stars/articleshow/127893456.cms,"2026 Milan Winter Olympics (Via Getty Images)

Paul Bissonnette blames NHL for this string of injuries

The NHL is facing a mounting injury crisis just days before the Olympic break begins. Players across the league are dropping with injuries at an alarming rate, forcing multiple teams to make roster adjustments as they prepare to send their stars to represent their countries in Milan.The situation has drawn sharp criticism from hockey media personalities, with former NHL player and current analyst Paul Bissonnette leading the charge against the league's scheduling decisions. Bissonnette did not mince words when addressing the issue on social media.The Spittin' Chiclets podcast host questioned the wisdom of maintaining a full 82-game regular season schedule during a year when NHL players are participating in the Olympics for the first time since 2014. ""Making these guys play 82 games in an Olympic year is a joke,"" Bissonnette said. ""Guys are getting injured every game.""The former Coyotes forward offered a specific solution to address the problem. Bissonnette suggested reducing the regular season to 76 games in Olympic years, with teams playing four games against conference opponents and one game against teams in the opposite conference.He also proposed reverting to a 1-8 playoff seeding format rather than the current divisional structure, arguing the change makes sense for Olympic seasons even if implemented temporarily.""Go back to 1-8 seeding in those years because it's the way it should be anyway but at least we get it every four years,"" Bissonnette said.The criticism comes as several Olympic roster members deal with health issues heading into the tournament. Team Canada has already lost Anthony Cirelli to injury after the Lightning forward was hurt during Sunday's Stadium Series game, with Sam Bennett stepping in as his replacement.Tampa Bay teammate Brayden Point remains week-to-week with a lower-body injury and his Olympic availability remains uncertain. Florida Panthers forward Brad Marchand and Washington Capitals goaltender Logan Thompson are both dealing with day-to-day injuries heading into the break.Sweden has been hit particularly hard, with Boston forward Elias Lindholm and Colorado defenseman Devon Toews both sidelined. Team USA has concerns about defenseman Jaccob Slavin, who has been limited to seven games this season due to injuries.The men's Olympic hockey tournament begins February 11, with Canada opening against Czechia on February 12. The mounting injury concerns have raised questions about whether the NHL schedule needs adjustment during Olympic years to protect player health heading into international competition.",NHL is facing a mounting injury crisis just days before the Olympic break begins.

What the full Memphis Grizzlies and Utah Jazz trade package looks like

Why Memphis would move a franchise cornerstone like Jaren Jackson Jr.

What Jaren Jackson Jr. brings to a Utah Jazz team looking to level up

The NBA world just got hit with one of those trades that makes you reread the headline twice. The Memphis Grizzlies have officially moved star big man Jaren Jackson Jr. to the Utah Jazz in a massive multi-player, multi-pick deal that feels like more than just a roster tweak. This move signals a serious shift in direction for Memphis.Let’s start with the clear breakdown, because this is a big one.The Grizzlies receive:Walter Clayton Jr., Kyle Anderson, Taylor Hendricks, Georges Niang, and three future first-round draft picks.The Jazz receive:Jaren Jackson Jr., John Konchar, Jock Landale, and Vince Williams Jr.That’s a lot of names but the headline piece is obvious. Memphis is sending out one of its franchise cornerstones in Jaren Jackson Jr., while Utah is loading up on established talent to strengthen its core. Anytime an All-Star level player gets moved in a package this large, it’s a sign that both teams are thinking long term, not just about this season.This is the part that really makes fans pause. Jaren Jackson Jr. wasn’t just another starter. He’s a former Defensive Player of the Year, an All-Star, and one of the best rim protectors in the league. For years, he was viewed as a key piece of Memphis’ foundation alongside Ja Morant.So why move him now?The answer likely comes down to flexibility and timeline. Memphis gets multiple players and, more importantly, three future first-round picks. In today’s NBA, draft capital is gold. Picks can turn into young stars, cheap rotation players, or be flipped later in another big trade. By making this deal, the Grizzlies are giving themselves options. Whether that means a retool around Morant or a bigger reset down the line, Memphis now controls more of its future.From Utah’s side, this is a bold win-now style move. Jaren Jackson Jr. instantly becomes one of the most impactful defenders on the roster. He protects the rim, switches onto smaller players, and can space the floor offensively. That combination is rare.The Jazz have been building patiently with young talent and draft assets but adding a proven two-way star suggests they’re ready to speed things up. Jackson gives Utah a defensive anchor they can build around, especially in a Western Conference loaded with elite guards and scoring wings. His presence alone could lift the team’s defensive ceiling in a major way.While Jaren Jackson Jr. is the biggest name in the deal, those first-round picks might end up being just as important.Zooming out, this move doesn’t just affect two teams. The Western Conference playoff race is always tight, and adding a player like Jaren Jackson Jr. to Utah changes matchups. His defense alone can swing games in a seven-game series.","The Memphis Grizzlies have officially moved star big man Jaren Jackson Jr. to the Utah Jazz in a massive multi-player, multi-pick deal.

Miami Heat curates a massive trade package for Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/miami-heat-curates-a-massive-trade-package-for-bucks-superstar-giannis-antetokounmpo/articleshow/127893989.cms,"Miami Heat prepares a massive trade package for Giannis Antetokounmpo (Images via Getty)

Miami Heat assembles an impressive trade package for Giannis Antetokounmpo



Tension simmers between Giannis Antetokounmpo and Milwaukee Bucks



The Miami Heat have reportedly prepared a massive proposal for Giannis Antetokounmpo . The Heat’s front office has shown strong interest since the trade rumours started swirling around the Greek Freak, and with their latest offer consisting of crucial players with multiple first-round draft and swap picks, they are going for an all-in approach.With the ongoing trade chaos, nobody knows where Bucks’ Giannis Antetokounmpo will fit as the last puzzle piece. The February 5 trade lines loom over the league, yet Giannis, who has shown some strong intention to leave the Bucks after their inconsistent performances this season, remains untraded.On the latest episode of NBA Countdown, Milwaukee head coach Doc Rivers showed a strong stance and said, “Giannis is gonna play. He loves playing as a Bucks. I think Giannis is going to come back and play at some point. We just don't know when that point is. He's progressing. I've been here through two playoff series so far, and I've yet to have a healthy team. Giannis wants to be healthy.”Despite this, the relationship between River and Antetokounmpo hasn’t been seen on the best of terms as the latter was seen avoiding Doc during a timeout in one of the Bucks’ recent matches.Adding to the ongoing whirlpool of trade madness, the Heat have taken an aggressive step by offering a package consisting of Tyler Herro, Kel'el Ware, Terry Rozier, young players, 2 1st-round picks, and 3 pick swaps for the Bucks’ cornerstone.This matches what the Bucks’ front office has expected with Giannis’ trade. With the inclusion of Tyler Herro, who averaged 21.9 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 2.7 assists while shooting 49.7% from the field before getting injured, and 2nd-year Kel’el, who is putting up an impressive average of 11.4 points, 9.3 rebounds, and 53.9% efficiency from the floor, the Bucks would get a boost of young talents to nurture into superstars.For the Heat’s salary cap, Terry Rozier’s $26.6 million expiring contract and Tyler Herro’s $31 million salary will be used to match Antetokounmpo’s $54.1 million cap hit for this season.The urgency of Giannis' trade stems from the intensifying tension between him and the front office, along with the team’s disappointing performances on the court. The Bucks are currently placed 12th in the Eastern Conference with an 18-29 record. To call the 2025-26 season challenging would be an understatement, as they have struggled on both ends of the court with 111.1 points per game (27th this season) and a 117.4 defensive rating (22nd this season). And, the 2 time NBA MVP doesn’t want to put up with his low-tier performance anymore.After a self-diagnosed calf-strain in against the Nuggets last month, Antetokounmpo walked off the stage and has been sidelined since then. The Bucks are not rushing to a decision, as they want to maximize this trade if it is to happen. Otherwise, they’ll target the summer when additional draft assets from their opponents will become eligible for trade.",Miami Heat have reportedly prepared a massive proposal for Giannis Antetokounmpo.
