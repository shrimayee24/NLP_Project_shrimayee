Writing from middle, not end



Moments over milestones



Power of the ordinary



Once the preserve of people who had lived long, complicated lives — ageing film stars, war survivors, Nobel laureates — memoirs now follow a different timetable. From bookstore front tables to literary fest panels across India, writers in their twenties and thirties are redefining what a memoir looks like, and who gets to tell it.These are not tales of epic achievement or reflections after retirement, but lives still in motion with millennials and GenZs sharing their tales of growing up queer or disabled, surviving political violence, navigating family expectations, illness, ambition, and the ordinary challenges of becoming an adult, somewhere mid-journey.One such writer is K Vaishali, who was just 24 when she first thought of writing her life story. Growing up as a lesbian and dyslexic person in India, her life had been a tug of war between secrets and confessions — at home and on university campus — navigating double marginalisation. Even as the urge to pen her story grew, so did the hesitation.“I thought hiding under the garb of fiction would be easier. It was my editor who pushed me to make it a memoir,” says the author, now 33. While working on the book, Vaishali discovered queer memoirs by Western writers but struggled to find Indian reference points.“I wanted young people to know there is hope. I didn’t have that growing up,” she says.While many writers wrestle with questions about the relevance of their life story, Sanjana Ramachandran never did. Growing up in a Tamil Brahmin family, she was just 17 when she knew her “filmy” life had to be written about. Ramachandran never climbed Everest or entered the Limca Book of Records, but did something many women of her generation would recognise: appeared for competitive exams, pursued engineering followed by an MBA, clashed with a strict father, and explored her politics and sexuality. Titled ‘Famous Last Questions’, the memoir came out last year. She was 31.“There was no way to not write it,” she says. While working on the book, Ramachandran realised how closely her experiences mirrored those of other ’90s kids in India who lived double lives at home and struggled to be themselves. “I knew it would be helpful to me and to some others, no matter how small or large the number.”A similar zeal defined Tarini Mohan’s ‘Lifequake’, which traces how the young development professional’s life was turned upside down after an accident that led to a traumatic brain injury at 23. A decade later she began writing the book, eager to capture the details in case they became blurry later. “I didn't want it to be inspiring or a success story about ‘overcoming’ limitations, just a normal girl’s journey,” she says. “I hate that word. You don’t overcome disability. You live with it.” In the book, Mohan is vulnerable as she talks about not just slipping in and out of coma, but everyday things she took for granted. “Like going out dancing.”While personal stories are the staple of memoirs, some writers are also trying to find a balance between the political and the personal. Zara Chowdhary’s ‘The Lucky Ones’ recounts her 16-yearold self navigating the Gujarat riots of 2002 with family, and how that violence changed their lives.“I was always keenly aware of the lapses and voids. Memory, whether my own or that of survivors within my household or the larger community, is pliant. The gaps often tell a more profound story. Different versions only reveal how all nonfiction is also ultimately fiction,” she says.In the memoir, which was recently awarded the Shakti Bhatt Prize, the writer not only documents her family’s story but also braids it together with other witness accounts, and how the aftermath of the violence was navigated over generations. “It’s about keeping one’s conscience at the centre of one’s writing,” she adds, “and asking what is still urgent or relevant.”Tara Khandelwal, editor and founder of storytelling agency Bound, says such examples show that the definition of ‘memoir’ is finally changing in India. “There’s a growing awareness that a memoir doesn’t have to be the chronological story of your life from point A to Z. It can be about a year or a particular episode in one’s life,” says Khandelwal.To tap into this curiosity, Bound recently launched a new imprint, ‘Moments’. The submissions so far range from grandchildren writing about grandparents to a young cybercrime specialist documenting their cases. “Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction,” Khandelwal says. “That’s what makes it tick.”Another is “personal branding” in an age of algorithm-driven social media platforms, points out Karthika V K, publisher at Westland Books. “There’s a change in the way that personal experience rubs up against public expression. It’s no longer only the very senior or obviously successful person whose lives are worth sharing,” she says.This, of course, means that there are shallow narratives and vanity projects alongside many more courageous and inspiring attempts to articulate lived experience of conflict, growth, achievement and failure. From startup CEOs and social media influencers to therapists and young parents.“Selective or partial memoirs are now far more popular than the conventional autobiography,” she says. “And where readers are interested, publishers will follow.”","From bookstore front tables to literary fest panels across India, writers in their twenties and thirties are redefining what a memoir looks like, and who gets to tell it.

Toothpick! Twiggy! Why does thin-shaming get a free pass?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/toothpick-twiggy-why-does-thin-shaming-get-a-free-pass/articleshow/127442841.cms,".

“How are you a Bengali girl if you don’t have a round chubby face?”

“Careful on the terrace or the wind may blow you off…”

“Do you need a belt, or will a rubber band do?” “Sure it’s not anorexia?”

Over the years, I’ve heard them all. Sometimes, all in the same afternoon. Usually delivered with a laugh. Always a laugh. Which seems to make it acceptable.Being thin comes with a peculiar licence for casual body policing. Despite a culture that idolises skinny bodies plastered across popular media, thinness turns out to be desirable in theory and rather suspect up close. We celebrate it on runways and screens, then mock it in real life.Let me clarify. I never quite fitted the Bengali stereotype of women with soft, rounded curves or the cherished idea of looking visibly ‘well-fed’ on ‘maach bhaat’. I was born thin, stayed thin, and now in my forties, still thin. Not because I’m trying to “maintain” myself, as many assume but because my metabolism has perhaps always done its own thing.Contrary to popular belief, I eat. Well. Often. With enthusiasm. I’ve never dieted, chased size-zero, or feared carbs. I binge on cheese and fries when the mood strikes and accept second helpings of samosa-jalebi from well-meaning friends determined to “fatten me up”.I am also routinely informed that lean women are objects of envy. So far, so good.Except that this is where the compliments end and the comments begin.It started before I was old enough to register it. Standing out in a family of rounded figures, relatives wondered aloud if something in my genes had gone astray. In my teenage years, someone called me a “toothpick”. It took me twenty years to realise this had a name: thin shaming. At the time, it was just one of many things said casually, jokingly, even affectionately. “Bag of bones”, “matchsticks”, “twiggy”, “walking X-ray”.Even after ‘skinny shaming’ entered public vocabulary, the repertoire merely evolved. “Are you ill or something?” “How long will you diet?” And occasionally, for variety, “Trying to become a model?” said aloud at family gatherings, classrooms and later, offices.Because here’s the thing. You wouldn’t call someone fat to their face anymore. We’ve been trained out of that, at least socially. But calling someone “too thin” is still fair game.I’d usually let these jokes land. But once, a distant relative surveyed me at a family dinner and announced, with the solemn air of a doctor, that I resembled a skeleton, apparently concerned that I wasn’t eating enough. I smiled sweetly and suggested she looked rather like a baby elephant. She was offended. I was lectured on sensitivity.What surprised me though was when she apologised later. It had finally occurred to her how casually offensive her own remark had been.Pray, why are there bodies you protect, and bodies you’re allowed to comment on freely?And sometimes, it doesn’t stop at words. A woman at a party I was acquainted with conducted a quick inspection of my midriff, tugging at the band of my dress to check if I was wearing a body shaper. When her investigation yielded nothing, she laughed and asked if I even had a stomach.Another time, a consulate official insisted on carrying my plate at a reception. I mistook it for old-school courtesy until he winked at how “tiny” I was. I stood there plate-less, weighing whether to thank him, laugh along, or recoil.Complete strangers — at a train station, during a spa therapy, in a theatre loo — have offered meal plans I never asked for. People also feel entitled to audit what you eat, when you eat, and how much makes it from plate to mouth. If you’re having a salad, there must be an eating disorder. If you skip dessert, someone will insist you fear calories. If you go for it, it’s followed by a triumphant, “Good, you need it.”Strangely, after all that caring, thin is automatically deemed fit. And fine. Lucky, even. Any health complaint is dismissed as exaggeration or attention-seeking. “Just eat more,” they say, because any anomaly is self-inflicted or worse, imaginary.Once, an undiagnosed allergy spiralled because my symptoms were dismissed as a side effect of being skinny and “not eating enough”. I was handed a food chart. The allergy worsened. What makes this harder is that it’s rarely acknowledged as harmful.Popular culture hasn’t helped either. I have a yawning dislike for that cheerful body-positive Meghan Trainor song that announces it’s “all about that bass” while swatting skinny women as fake, silicone stick figures no man should possibly want.Which brings me to the deeply irritating ideal that ‘real women have curves’. I’ve always found this baffling. Since when did fat percentage become a qualification for womanhood?By now, I’ve also learnt that no one steps in when thin-shaming happens openly right in the middle of a dinner table or a group chat. Not because people are brutal but because they don’t think it’s unkind. Skinny shaming survives because it doesn’t sound like an insult. It sounds like banter, teasing or a backhanded compliment from someone “only joking” or “just worried about you.”The irony is relentless. This is what pop culture has long sold as “the goal”. The XS silhouette is what runways are built for and AI churns out by the million, and now the Ozempics and Mounjaros promise. And yet, I’ve spent a lifetime feeling awkward inside a body everyone assumes I must love. I do — quite unapologetically — even as I’m habitually guilt-tripped for it.A new AIIMS -ICMR study has finally put numbers to what many like me have lived. Conducted among 1,071 young adults aged 18-30 attending AIIMS outpatient clinics, it found that 47% of underweight participants reported moderate to severe body image distress, almost as high as the 49% reported by those with obesity.I’m outside that age bracket now and don’t get angry anymore. Mostly, I get tired. Tired of explaining my metabolism, justifying my appetite, reassuring people that my blood reports are excellent, of hearing “I wish I had your problem” from people who don’t see it as a problem at all.I’ve even curated a bagful of skinny jokes over the years and now ask folks to get more creative when they reach for the hackneyed gags about being blown away by a chance breeze. Somewhere along the way, I reclaimed my right to decide what my body is and is not.But not everyone can. And that’s the part we don’t talk about.","Being thin comes with a peculiar licence for casual body policing.

Raising children in a changed world

For many who grew up in India’s urban and metropolitan households, there was a time when forgetting to remind your father about bringing a chart paper or a political map of India meant a sleepless night of fear. The realisation would strike around 11 pm — too late, of course — followed by the certainty of what the morning would bring: anger, scolding, and a silent walk to school. You would run for your life if your mother caught you hiding test papers, instantly transform into an Oscar-worthy performer furiously finishing notebooks the moment you heard your father’s scooty pull in, or feel a familiar knot in your stomach before a parent-teacher meeting — one where the dreaded remark would glare back across the table:A casual greeting from a classmate in the market could be just as unsettling, inviting raised eyebrows and quiet questions later at home. For those disallowed from using mobile phones before their Class 12 boards, messages were typed secretly on keypad phones, the beep muffled so it wouldn’t be heard — sending elephant jokes or whispered secrets to friends like a thief.These memories are largely rooted in urban, middle-class childhoods — shaped by nuclear families, school-centric lives, and early exposure to rules, routines, and discipline within the home.Parenting experiences across India are far from uniform, but it is within these urban belts that the shift from authority to dialogue is most visible today.Today, phones are so firmly glued to hands that parents often become background noise, their presence acknowledged only when they call you for dinner or scold you for missing chores — an ironic reversal from the days when children moved quietly to avoid detection. And there were always two food choices on the dinner table: one, eat the green vegetables mom cooked; or two, don’t.Today, the same situations play out very differently. A child might suggest a 10-minute delivery app, and parents might laugh instead of scold. Friends are no longer viewed with suspicion but accepted as a natural part of growing up. From parents as unquestioned authority figures — stern, guarded, and rule-bound — to parents who attempt to balance discipline with dialogue, the parent–child dynamic has evolved significantly.Where once there was unspoken hesitation between parent and child, certain music, movies, or topics were strictly off the table. Today, children often assure their parents that such things are “not a big deal,” reflecting a more open, negotiable space where dialogue has replaced silent compliance.There exists one generation that largely obeyed and followed the route map carefully curated by their parents. Another listens, responds, and sometimes rebels — demanding to be understood, not merely permitted. Tech-savvy and exposed to the world far earlier than children once were, today’s young people often see beyond their years, assert their individual needs, and understand their own boundaries with remarkable clarity. It is within this generational shift that parenting styles diverge and relationships are reshaped.To be a parent, after all, is not a task for the faint-hearted.It involves raising, teaching, understanding, and eventually befriending a human being — one who can at times be stubborn, questioning, and who ultimately grows into a person of their own temperament.Parenting is a test most are never fully prepared for, a daily examination governed by an unending list of don’ts and dilemmas. This evolution is not a judgment on any generation of parents; most only want the best for their children, often even what they themselves could not achieve — not to burden them, but to build them for the world.Parenting, in essence, can be seen as a negotiation of fear, affection, aspiration, and trust. It is about guiding a human through the unknown while learning to let go, adapting as the child grows, and discovering that the rules of yesterday may no longer apply to the realities of today. The arc from strict discipline to dialogue, from unquestioned authority to mutual respect, reflects not just a change in homes, but a transformation in the very way we imagine childhood, the transition into adulthood, and the delicate dance in between.Parenting today has evolved significantly from the rigid, authority-driven approach of the past. Parents we spoke to shared nuanced views on balancing discipline, guidance, and modern realities, emphasizing the importance of empathy, communication, and trust.One mother explained how she navigates the realities of technology with her 15-year-old daughter: “While I remind her to study, I cannot ignore that phones have become a part of life. I try to balance this by not only allowing social media but also being tagged in reels my children share. What could be a distraction becomes a way to connect with them.”Another parent highlighted the risks of overly strict discipline: “If we are too firm, our children might trust outsiders before coming to us. We ought to be the first ones they share with.” Similarly, patience and empathy were emphasized by another parent: “We try to handle differences calmly. Anger often makes children fear rather than respect, but bad behaviour still needs to be called out.”Parents today increasingly favour guidance and understanding over rigid enforcement. One parent reflected on how the approach to parenting has shifted over generations:“Earlier, parents were strict, and children dealt with that strictness. Today, children prefer supportive guidance and warm communication. They enjoy interactive learning through activities. Children catch on quickly and need parental involvement. I focus on love, care, empathy, and independence when needed, balancing affection with healthy development.”Another parent raising three children, including a Class 10 student, shared how she balances guidance and independence:“We consciously try not to be as authoritative and strict as our parents were. Instead, we try to give our child a safe and comfortable space. Earlier, parenting focused on strictness and outcomes, while emotional support was often ignored. Today, communication matters more.”She added that while friendship in parenting is desirable, balance remains crucial:“Friendship is important, but it must be balanced with firmness. We listen and allow our children to share freely, but rules are also made clear. Boundaries help children feel supported while learning responsibility.”Reflecting on his own upbringing, one parent noted that fear-based discipline often leads to secrecy rather than responsibility. “My reaction to my son’s mistakes has always been a hug, followed by a calm discussion. If children see their parents as a safe space, they are more willing to confide.”Hari Shankar Soni, a media educator and father of two daughters, emphasized how parenting must adapt to modern realities: “I had my share of strict discipline from my father once. But, I have never raised hand on my children; I cannot imagine doing that with my kids. I don’t believe punishment works for this generation. I want to be a friend, not an authority they fear.”To understand parenting from the children’s point of view, we spoke to students across age groups. Their voices reveal how guidance, boundaries, and emotional support play out daily.Rubal, a Class 10 student in Delhi, shared: “My parents usually listen to my opinions, even if they don’t fully agree. They support me when I make mistakes. I wish they trusted me more on issues like career and mobile use, and understood that mistakes are part of growing up.”A Class 11 student echoed similar feelings: “My parents are supportive and provide solutions, but we differ on issues like marriage. They value security, while I think differently. I wish they understood my personality better.”A Class 6 student said: “My opinions are considered, and my parents explain things calmly. But sometimes I feel distant when they are strict about friends or social media.”A Class 9 student added: “I enjoy fun banter with my parents, but comparisons with others sometimes bother me. I try to voice it out.”Together, these voices suggest that children today seek understanding without absence, freedom without neglect, and boundaries without fear.Seema Kundra, a teacher with over 25 years of experience, says classrooms today reflect changing parenting styles, especially after Covid. “Many parents speak to teachers without filters, believing their authority is absolute. This attitude shows in children, who are far more casual with teachers.”She added that excessive screen time has widened the gap. “Parents sometimes criticise teachers in front of children, which undermines authority. Compared to five years ago, parental involvement has reduced.”Palak Sharma, a young educator, said the contrast is “worlds apart.” “Parents are present, but often transient due to work. Discipline and emotional support are pushed onto teachers.”While supporting gentle parenting, she cautioned against misinterpretation. “Gentle parenting has become an excuse to avoid discipline. Children need freedom, but also guidance and boundaries.”Whereas, Gauri Chandna Budhiraja, as a teacher noted that while parents are more engaged, “this sometimes crosses into over-protection and pressure.” Feedback that was once accepted, she said, is now often negotiated.Dr. Rajiv Mehta, Vice-Chairperson (Psychiatry) at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, stressed that the emotional climate at home plays a critical role.“Over-interference, hostility, and constant criticism create a damaging cycle. Parents pass anxiety to children, who then struggle emotionally.”He added: “Today’s helicopter parenting limits children’s independence. Earlier generations allowed more freedom to explore.”Psychologists commonly classify parenting into four styles, first outlined by Diana Baumrind and later expanded by Eleanor Maccoby and John Martin:• Authoritarian: High control, low warmth• Permissive: High warmth, low structure• Authoritative: Balanced boundaries and emotional support• Neglectful: Low responsiveness and guidanceWhat emerges today is a shift away from rigid authoritarianism. Most families attempt authoritative parenting, though many struggle to find balance amid technology, time scarcity, and rising anxiety.Parenting is never one-size-fits-all. Styles evolve with social realities, work pressures, culture, and mental health. Authority has softened into dialogue, fear into negotiation, and silence into openness. Yet closeness without boundaries can be as unsettling as discipline without empathy.Children today are more aware and expressive, but also face heightened emotional pressures. Parents, meanwhile, are caught between doing better than the generation before them — and fearing they may be doing too much, or too little.","Parenting is a test most are never fully prepared for, a daily examination governed by an unending list of don’ts and dilemmas. From parents as unquestioned authority figures — stern, guarded, and rule-bound — to parents who attempt to balance discipline with dialogue, the parent–child dynamic has evolved significantly.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127400722,imgsize-1136293,width-400,resizemode-4/image-2026-01-24t192102599.jpg"
"2,241 Army JCOs get honorary officer ranks for long, selfless service",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2241-army-jcos-get-honorary-officer-ranks-for-long-selfless-service/articleshow/127420154.cms,"PTI file photo

NEW DELHI: To honour junior commissioned officers (JCOs) with a record of long and distinguished military service, the Central govt has approved ahead of Republic Day the conferment of honorary commissioned ranks on 2,241 JCOs of the Indian Army.At least 437 JCOs have been elevated to the rank of honorary captain, while 1,804 JCOs have been conferred the rank of honorary lieutenant, recognising their decades of selfless military service, according to an official notification.Among those elevated to the rank of honorary captain is Subedar Major and honorary Lieutenant Sanjay Kumar, a Param Vir Chakra recipient, whose name resonates far beyond military circles. Kumar is a legendary Army officer (13 JAK Rifles) who was awarded India’s highest gallantry honour for his heroics in the 1999 Kargil War. On July 4, 1999, he single-handedly captured Flat Top, Point 4875, by neutralising enemy machine-gun posts despite severe injuries.Honorary ranks in the Indian Army are conferred on JCOs with impeccable service records who have displayed professional excellence and sterling leadership qualities at unit level.While these ranks — honorary lieutenant and honorary captain— do not alter command structures, they carry deep symbolic value within the armed forces. The number of those conferred the honour this year highlights the oft-neglected contributions of Subedars and Subedar Majors, who form the bedrock of the Army’s functioning. They train young soldiers, preserve regimental traditions, enforce discipline and provide continuity in some of the most challenging operational environments in the world.In addition to the honour and protocol status, these ranks can result in a modest enhancement in pensionary benefits, depending on the applicable rules, an aspect that assumes importance for personnel retiring earlier than most govt employees. The honorary ranks are a formal acknowledgement by the nation that exceptional service rendered within a shorter career deserves to be recognised and respected.","The Central govt has approved ahead of Republic Day the conferment of honorary commissioned ranks on 2,241 JCOs of the Indian Army.

Silver lining: Woman lives 25 yrs with a donor heart,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/silver-lining-woman-lives-25-yrs-with-a-donor-heart/articleshow/127428528.cms,".

If you want life, take risks, says recipient



.

NEW DELHI: Preeti Unhale, 51, completed 25 years with a donor heart on Jan 23, 2026, becoming India's longest-living heart transplant survivor - a landmark considering that heart transplants were rare, donor awareness was limited and long-term survival remained uncertain when she underwent the procedure.Originally from MP, Unhale came to AIIMS in 2000 after exhausting treatment options at home and in Mumbai. She was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy - a condition in which the heart muscle becomes weak and enlarged, reducing its ability to pump blood effectively and leading to heart failure. She was told a heart transplant was her only chance. At AIIMS, she met cardiothoracic surgeon Dr P Venugopal and cardiologist Dr K K Talwar. ""For the first time, I heard the words, 'You will be fine',"" she recalled. She stayed in Delhi for treatment - and has since lived here.Dr Talwar told TOI that Unhale had arrived in an extremely critical condition. ""She had married barely two and a half years earlier and came to us with hope after being refused everywhere else,"" he said. With little clinical guidance available at the time, doctors evaluated her extensively before a donor heart became available.""For end-stage heart failure, transplantation is the definitive answer. Survival is around 85% at five years. She has completed 25,"" he said. The transplant, performed in Jan 2001 by using the heart of a brain-dead teenage donor, happened at a time when outcomes were uncertain.""There was no guidance then. Success rates were low, and there were hardly any survivors to talk to. People discouraged us, saying transplants don't last long. But there was no other option,"" Unhale said.""If you want life - and a good quality of life - you take that risk."" Her husband, an Indian Forest Service officer, sought a transfer to Delhi so that the family could stay close to AIIMS. ""Family support was critical,"" she said.Life after transplant meant lifelong discipline. Unhale takes daily immunosuppressants and has faced multiple rejection episodes, including a major one in 2006-07 when she had to be rushed to AIIMS late at night.Over the years, she developed kidney problems, steroid-related bone damage, vascular necrosis and facial paralysis - each managed with sustained medical care. ""This survival isn't mine alone,"" she said. ""It belongs to doctors, nurses, technicians and even sanitation staff. It takes a system to save one life,"" she said. Preeti Unhale has counselled heart transplant patients across India, helping bridge the information gap she once faced. Her message is unequivocal: ""If doctors advise a transplant, there is no other option. Donors are rare - if you get one, say yes immediately. Live fully, but with discipline. We have been given a second chance.""","Preeti Unhale, 51, completed 25 years with a donor heart on Jan 23, 2026.

Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. I was at the wedding ceremony of a relative. One of those rare weddings with an early morning muhurtham , where brunch is still an hour away. Relatives who otherwise communicate only through forwarded messages on WhatsApp, slowly formed a circle. There was genuine warmth, laughter and enquiries . Then a teenager murmured an alert, almost like a warning: “Manju aunty.” Half the teenagers vanished with remarkable coordination. Manju aunty is, by all accounts, a loving and well-meaning person. The problem is volume—of words. Excessive talking would be an understatement. It is as though God, while assembling her, forgot to install a filter between thought and speech. She joined the circle, entirely unmindful of the sudden stillness. Her eyes landed on a teenage girl who had not escaped in time. Turning to the girl’s mother, she asked loudly, “Did you forget to feed her? Why is she so thin? Does she think this is some fashion?” Without waiting for an answer, she launched into how well she had fed her own daughter—and how that, naturally, led to a smooth ‘ normal delivery’ . The women who had undergone caesarean sections shifted uncomfortably, eyes lowered, dignity bruised in silence . Her gaze then fell on a Class IV boy and asked his rank in class. When the boy replied there was no ranking system anymore, she smiled indulgently and explained how her son always stood first though, thanks to her strict control. As her words poured out, relentless as autumn leaves falling from a tree, the gathering began to dissolve. Someone urgently needed the restroom. Someone else had to check on their child. A phone rang. Soon, only Manju aunty remained, speaking uninterrupted, and an elderly grandmother who could not hear a word anyway. We have all met Manju aunties in our lives. People who love to talk. When they call you, you immediately panic. If you pick up, your next 20 minutes is gone. If you don’t, you will have to hear about the habit of not answering calls the next time you meet. One thing often common among such persistent speakers is judgement. An unspoken “I know better” . What they lose—without realising it—is the chance to learn. Listening is not merely waiting for one’s turn to speak; it is an act of humility. Wisdom often arrives softly. It does not shout to be heard. Silence, contrary to popular belief, is not emptiness. It is strategy. The silent observer learns far more about the one who speaks without pause than the speaker ever learns about the listener. That is why Plato observed, “Wise men speak when they have something to say; fools speak because they have to say something.” The world today celebrates constant expression—opinions aired instantly; reactions broadcast without reflection. Yet the power lies not in saying everything, but in knowing what deserves to be said. Thiruvalluvar captured this with disarming simplicity: “Solluga sollir payanuḍaiya; Sollarka Sollil payanillach chol.” If speak you will, speak words that are fruitful; If speak you will, speak never fruitless words. The Kural does not glorify silence blindly. It demands responsibility from speech. Words must justify themselves. If they wound, belittle, inflate ego, or merely fill space, silence would have served better.","The Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127363054,imgsize-74308,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/127363054.jpg"

NEW DELHI: A pair of abandoned slippers and a gap in a broken stone wall leading into a forested ridge helped police crack the case of a 10-year-old girl’s sexual assault in central Delhi’s Prasad Nagar. The child was allegedly abducted, raped and left unconscious in the secluded area by an e-rickshaw driver.In the absence of a name or registration number, investigators said they relied entirely on the visual identification of a red e-ricks-haw with a white roof. TOI had earlier reported the incident, which took place on Jan 11, and the arrest made on Jan 14. Fresh details have since emerged about the investigation that led police to the suspect. The survivor has since been discharged following medical treatment and counselling.The investigation began on Jan 11, when the girl — who supports her family by selling flowers at traffic signals — was brought to a hospital with injuries. She told police she was lured by an e-rickshaw driver on the pretext of being offered tea and taken to a forest patch. Despite being disoriented, she recalled fragments of her surroundings—a “blue-painted room” and a “broken entry point”—providing police with their first lead.DCP (Central) Anant Mittal formed three teams to crack the case. They scanned a 20-sq-km radius, manually inspecting 22 locations with similar features and analysing CCTV footage.The breakthrough came when police examined CCTV footage from Professor Ram Nath Vij Marg, which matched the details shared by the girl. On a deserted stretch of the ridge, officers found a broken stone wall leading to a small structure. The recovery of the girl’s slippers confirmed the crime scene, allowing forensic teams to reconstruct the route taken by the accused between 11 pm and 1 am.“Alongside the ground search, a second team scanned footage from over 100 CCTV cameras. A key lead emerged when a camera recorded a red e-rickshaw with a white roof carrying the minor. Based on this visual, a third team searched e-rickshaw stands in Karol Bagh and Rajendra Place,” a senior officer said.Photographs of suspected drivers were circulated among investigators until the vehicle was traced near a petrol pump in Rajendra Place. Police later spotted a man matching the victim’s description approaching the vehicle. He attempted to flee on noticing the police presence but was chased down and apprehended.The suspect, identified as Durgesh, 25, from Farrukhabad in Uttar Pradesh, later led police to the recovery of blood-stained clothes.","A pair of abandoned slippers and a gap in a broken stone wall helped police crack the case of a 10-year-old girl’s sexual assault in central Delhi.

‘Grand master’ banners hail CM Devendra Fadnavis after BJP’s record 57 corporators in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/grand-master-banners-hail-fadnavis-after-bjps-record-57-corporators-in-chhatrapati-sambhajinagar/articleshow/127324988.cms,"Devendra Fadnavis Says BJP Created History in Maharashtra Civic Elections







CHHATRAPATI SAMBHAJINAGAR: Riding high on its best-ever performance in the Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar Municipal Corporation elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has signalled a decisive shift in the region's political landscape.Across the city, banners have appeared projecting chief minister Devendra Fadnavis as a political ""grandmaster,"" celebrating the party's newfound dominance.The BJP clinched 57 seats, its highest-ever tally in the city — a result party leaders are calling a landmark moment for its expansion into the Marathwada region.The banners, largely credited to BAMU management council member Basavraj Mangrule, feature a stylised, likely AI-generated image of Fadnavis against a backdrop of chess pieces. In the visual, Fadnavis is shown making a winning move by holding the king, symbolically suggesting a ""checkmate"" of his political opponents. The creative messaging has sparked widespread discussion in political circles, underscoring the surge of confidence within the BJP camp.The victory is strategically significant. Currently, the BJP holds two of the three assembly seats within city limits: Atul Save (Aurangabad East), who serves as the minister for OBC welfare and housing, and the party's growing grassroots network.While the Shiv Sena (Shinde faction) holds the Aurangabad West seat via district Guardian Minister Sanjay Shirsat and the Lok Sabha seat via Sandipan Bhumare, the civic poll results suggest the BJP is gaining significant ground on its ally.Historically, the Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar civic body was the fortress of the Shiv Sena. For decades, the Sena positioned itself as the ""big brother"" in seat-sharing arrangements, routinely contesting and winning the lion's share of seats while the BJP played a secondary role. However, this election — the first since the Shiv Sena split — upended that traditional hierarchy.Negotiations for a pre-poll alliance between the BJP and chief minister Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena collapsed after several rounds of talks, forcing the allies to contest independently. The outcome proved sobering for the Shinde-led Sena; despite contesting 97 seats, it secured only 13. The result was a major jolt for the party, which had entered the fray confident of emerging as the single largest force.The setback was even more severe for the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT). Contesting 99 seats, the party managed to win only six — its worst performance in the region since it first entered the municipal corporation in 1988 with 28 seats.By contrast, the BJP's jump to 57 seats has firmly established it as the single largest party, fundamentally reshaping the city's political equations ahead of future assembly and general elections.","The BJP clinched 57 seats, its highest-ever tally in the city.

Shivam Dube press conference: On Ishan and Surya’s knock & his role with the ball

After a difficult year with the bat in T20 Internationals and the added responsibility of captaincy weighing heavily during that phase, Suryakumar Yadav opened up on how patience, time in the middle and stepping away from social media helped him find his groove again.Suryakumar managed just 218 runs in 21 T20Is across 2025, raising concerns as India prepared to defend their T20 World Cup title next month. Those doubts, however, have eased during the ongoing series against New Zealand. He began with a measured 32 off 22 balls in the opening game before switching gears with a blistering 82 off 37 deliveries in the second.“There’s a coach sitting at home as well, to whom I am married. She keeps telling me, ‘I think you should take some time (in the middle)’,” Suryakumar said while speaking to Ishan Kishan in a BCCI video. He added that his wife’s close understanding helped him recalibrate his approach. “She reads my mind. I decided to take some time… and I have got a better feeling.”He admitted that net sessions alone were not enough. “I was anyway telling everyone that I was batting well. I was trying in the nets. But no matter how much you do in the nets, until you score runs in the match, you don't get confidence,” he said.A break away from the game and social media also played a key role. “I got a good break of 2–3 weeks. I went home and cut off all social media… I practiced well in the last three weeks and I came in with a good (mental) space,” he explained.Kishan chipped in, saying, “… and it’s very important to stay happy,” a thought Suryakumar fully agreed with. “Cricket is a fantastic leveller… it is very important to have humility,” he said.Suryakumar also joked about breaking the narrative that India only wins when Abhishek Sharma scores big. “… we also had to end this conversation in front of the world,” he said. “If Ishan gets runs, we can win the match too… It's a team game.”Praising Kishan’s explosive 76 off 32 balls, which included the fastest T20I fifty by an Indian against New Zealand, Suryakumar said, “I have never seen anyone bat like this in my life in T20 cricket.” Kishan responded by saying confidence was the key. “I was seeing the ball really well… even on a good ball, I felt like I would either hit it or take a single,” he said.","Suryakumar managed just 218 runs in 21 T20Is across 2025, raising concerns as India prepared to defend their T20 World Cup title next month.

NEW DELHI: Music composer Palash Muchhal has once again found himself in the spotlight amid renewed cheating allegations, following fresh claims by actor-producer Vidnyan Mane, a close friend of Indian cricketer Smriti Mandhana . In the middle of the controversy, Muchhal has quietly removed several Instagram posts that featured Mandhana, which were still visible as recently as January 24, 2026.A scan of Muchhal’s social media account shows that multiple photos and moments shared with Mandhana have disappeared.These included affectionate birthday wishes, festive messages and snapshots from various public and private occasions, all of which had earlier offered glimpses into their relationship.Muchhal and Mandhana were reportedly scheduled to tie the knot on November 23, 2025. However, after pre-wedding functions were completed, the main ceremony was unexpectedly postponed when Mandhana’s father had to be rushed to hospital, bringing the celebrations to an abrupt halt.The controversy resurfaced after Mane alleged that Muchhal was caught in a compromising situation with another woman, further claiming that Mandhana’s friends confronted him physically.Mane, who has also accused Muchhal of cheating him of Rs 40 lakh, told Hindustan Times, “I was at the wedding celebrations (November, 23, 2025) when he was caught red-handed with another woman in bed. Bhayanak scene tha, he was beaten up by the Indian female cricketers.The entire family is chindi chor. I thought he’d get married and settle in Sangli, but it has completely backfired on me.”In response to the accusations, Muchhal has approached the court, initiating legal action against Mane.The composer announced the move through a statement on Instagram, saying, “A legal notice of defamation of ?10 crore has been sent by my lawyer Shreyansh Mithare to Sangli based Vidnyan Mane for his false, outrageous and highly defamatory accusations made with the deliberate intent to malign my reputation and character,”With both sides holding firm to their versions, the episode continues to unfold in public view, drawing attention to the personal turmoil behind the headlines.","Vidnyan Mane, a close friend of Indian cricketer Smriti Mandhana, has made fresh cheating allegations against music composer Palash Muchhal.

Cleveland Cavaliers vs Orlando Magic Key Matchups (January 24, 2026)

Thevisit theon January 24, 2026, at the Kia Center in a matchup that matters for Eastern Conference standings. Cleveland comes in at 26-20, while Orlando is 23-20, with both teams trying to stay in the playoff mix.Injuries are shaping this game on both sides. Rotations are thinner than usual, and several key players are unavailable. That puts more pressure on the starters and shifts the focus toward interior scoring, rebounding, and half-court execution.Cleveland is on the second night of a back-to-back and will be without several perimeter players. Darius Garland is out with a right great toe strain. Sam Merrill is sidelined with a right hand sprain. Max Strus continues to recover from left foot surgery (Jones fracture). Chris Livingston and Luke Travers are unavailable due to G-League two-way assignments.Orlando could get Jalen Suggs back, with his status listed as probable after missing three weeks with a right knee MCL contusion. Franz Wagner remains out with left ankle soreness. Colin Castleton is unavailable on a G-League assignment. With these absences, both teams are expected to lean heavily on their frontcourt players.Both teams are likely to play through the paint more than usual given the depleted backcourts.Cleveland leads the all-time regular-season series 67-62 across 129 games, though Orlando has traditionally performed well at home against them. This season, the Cavaliers hold a 2-1 edge, outscoring the Magic by an average margin of 10 points per game. Cleveland has averaged 120.0 points in those matchups, while Orlando has scored 110.0. Rebounding has been a key factor so far. The teams will meet again on January 26, March 11, and March 24.Cleveland holds a slight edge on offense, while Orlando has been more consistent defensively, even with recent lineup changes.Donovan Mitchell remains the engine of Cleveland’s offense, averaging a career-high 28.9 points per game and posting a strong on-court net rating. His matchup with Jalen Suggs, if Suggs plays, will be central, especially given Suggs’ impact on defense.In the frontcourt, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen carry much of Cleveland’s interior workload, while Paolo Banchero and Wendell Carter Jr. anchor Orlando’s attack. Orlando averages 54.0 points in the paint per game, which could test Cleveland’s interior defense. Mobley is coming off a strong performance with 29 points and 13 rebounds.Orlando has played well at home, while Cleveland enters on a two-game win streak. With both teams short-handed, this game is likely to come down to execution, rebounding, and who controls the paint late.","The Cleveland Cavaliers host the Orlando Magic on January 24, 2026.

Meaning of the quote of the day Microsoft co-founder by Bill Gates



Staying humble in a world of constant wins



Why failure is actually the better instructor



Bill Gates and the danger of overconfidence in 2026



Final thoughts on the Gates philosophy







Success is a concept we are all taught to chase from the moment we can understand the word. We see it in the headlines, on our social feeds, and in the lives of the people we admire. But Bill Gates, a man who has lived at the absolute peak of global influence and wealth for decades, has a different take on it. He famously said, ""Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose."" It’s a bit of a reality check, isn't it? Coming from someone who co-founded Microsoft and spent years as the richest person on the planet, you’d expect him to be success’s biggest cheerleader. Instead, he’s warning us that the very thing we want can actually be the thing that trips us up. He’s talking about that dangerous mix of ego and comfort that creeps in when things are going well.When Gates says success is a lousy teacher, he’s cutting through the fluff of typical motivational speeches. The core meaning here is about the psychological trap of ""winning."" When you fail, you’re forced to look in the mirror. You have to take apart your process, find the cracks, and figure out exactly where you messed up. That’s where the real learning happens. But when you succeed? You usually just pat yourself on the back.You assume that because you won, every decision you made along the way was the right one. This creates a blind spot.The second part of the quote—the idea that success ""seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose""—is even more pointed. Smart people are often the most vulnerable to this. If you’ve spent your life being right, it’s easy to start believing that you are inherently better or smarter than the market or the competition. Success makes you feel invincible. It lulls you into a state of complacency where you stop looking for risks because you don't believe they apply to you anymore. For Gates, this wasn't just a theory; it was a lesson he lived through at Microsoft during the rise of the internet and later the mobile era, where past dominance sometimes made it harder to see the next big shift coming.It’s hard to stay grounded when everyone is telling you how great you are. In today’s culture, we celebrate the ""win"" so loudly that we forget to check if the win was actually repeatable or just a stroke of luck. Bill Gates’ current work in 2026 shows he’s still trying to apply this logic. Despite his massive net worth—which still sits comfortably over $100 billion—he’s moved far beyond the world of software. He’s currently knee-deep in high-risk, high-reward projects like the ""Horizon 1000"" initiative.Just this month, in January 2026, the Gates Foundation partnered with OpenAI, committing $50 million to bring AI-driven healthcare to 1,000 clinics across Africa, starting in Rwanda. This isn't the move of someone who thinks they've already ""won"" everything. It's the move of someone who knows that the challenges of global health and climate change are much harder than building an operating system. He’s putting his resources into areas where failure is a very real possibility, which keeps that ""lousy teacher"" of success at a distance.If success is a bad teacher, then failure is the strict professor you hated in college but realised later taught you everything you know. Failure doesn't let you off the hook. It demands an explanation. When a project falls apart or a business goes under, the pain of that loss acts as a powerful motivator to never let it happen again. You become more observant. You look at the data more closely.I remember a time when I put everything into a project that I was certain would be a ""slam dunk."" I didn't even have a backup plan because I was so convinced of my own brilliance. When it inevitably tanked, I was crushed. But looking back, that failure taught me more about risk management and humility than any of my previous successes ever did. It stripped away the ego and made me a better strategist. I think that's what Gates is getting at. You have to be willing to be wrong to eventually be right in a way that actually lasts.Even now, as we navigate 2026, the tech landscape is shifting faster than ever. With AI moving from a buzzword to a fundamental part of our infrastructure, the risk of overconfidence is huge. Companies that were the kings of the hill five years ago are finding themselves scrambling. Gates has always been a student of history, and he knows that the graveyard of business is filled with ""smart people"" who thought they couldn't lose.Look at his recent investments in nuclear energy through TerraPower. On January 21, 2026, it was reported that South Korean energy giants are taking major stakes in his Natrium nuclear plant project in Wyoming. This is a sector where success is incredibly difficult to achieve and the regulatory hurdles are massive. Gates isn't playing it safe. He’s deliberately stepping into arenas where he has to prove himself all over again. He's avoiding the ""seduction"" of his past achievements by constantly starting new, difficult chapters.At the end of the day, Bill Gates isn't saying we shouldn't strive for success. He’s just saying we shouldn't trust it. Success is a temporary state, not a permanent trait. If you want to keep growing, you have to treat your wins with a bit of suspicion. Ask yourself: ""Did I win because I’m a genius, or did I just get lucky?"" Most of the time, it's a bit of both. By staying curious and keeping a bit of that ""loser’s hunger,"" you can avoid the trap of thinking you’re untouchable. It’s a tough way to live—always looking for the hole in your own boat—but it’s the only way to keep from sinking.","Bill Gates famously said, ""Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose"" The core meaning here is about the psychological trap of ""winning"" When you fail, you’re forced to look in the mirror and figure out exactly where you messed up.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127271649,imgsize-32814,width-400,resizemode-4/bill-gates-image-source-reuters.jpg"

Lara Trump shares viral golfing photos with Donald Trump and granddaughter

Bill Maher Clashes With Lara Trump After She Downplays Trump’s ‘Piggy’ Insult On Air Force One

Social media responds with warmth and nostalgia

How a shared family moment cut through public tension





Lara Trump has recently bestowed upon social media participants a rare treat with a glimpse into the less familiar, more personal side of the Trump family. Through the sharing of just a few images on X, she has reached the hearts of many with this intimate family picture involving her young daughter's fun-filled golf game with her grandfather, US President Donald Trump himself, with whom she gets to spend quality time while playing their favourite game, golf. This is one instance where the family, known for its political fervour, has been accepted with such fervour not for their political ideology but for this common family experience that speaks volumes about their humanity despite their fame and power, resonating widely with audiences who cherish authentic, tender moments beyond politics.The photographs depicted Donald Trump behind the wheel of a golf cart, with his granddaughter sitting alongside him, looking happy and carefree. Moreover, there were no signs of poses or dramatic settings, only a serene capture of moments spent with each other. The informal nature of this post was a major factor that led to its success. The post was not meant for any particular message or statement, but only for a casual share by Lara Trump. The post succeeded in gathering tens of thousands of views, not because it was political or held any significance, but because it was something that was widely understood.The online response was largely positive, with many people describing the photographs as “wholesome” and “heartwarming”. Several users reflected on the special bond between grandparents and grandchildren, sharing how the images stirred personal memories and emotions. One user wrote, “What a great moment for her! My kids miss their Gramps,” while another commented, “Core memory unlocked!”, capturing the sense of nostalgia the post evoked. Others reacted more light-heartedly, with remarks such as, “Awww, I was wondering what Grandpa Trump was up to today!” and “Cutest thing I have seen all day.”Part of the post’s impact lay in its timing and tone. At a moment when public discourse is often polarised, the photographs presented a version of public life stripped of commentary and conflict. They highlighted how figures who dominate global headlines also occupy familiar family roles, such as grandparents enjoying simple moments with their loved ones.","Lara Trump has shared intimate family photos on social media.

'Indian cricket no less than Bollywood abroad' | Bombay Sport Exchange

Shahid Afridi has strongly criticised the International Cricket Council following Bangladesh’s removal from the 2026 T20 World Cup, accusing the governing body of applying different standards to different teams. The former Pakistan captain pointed to what he described as the ICC’s “inconsistency”, referencing how India’s concerns during the 2025 Champions Trophy were handled very differently.Afridi aired his views on social media platform X, highlighting what he believes is unequal treatment of member nations. He recalled how India had cited “security threats” to avoid travelling to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy, after which the ICC arranged for India’s matches to be played at a neutral venue in Dubai. India eventually progressed to the final, denying Pakistan the opportunity to host the title clash.“As a former international cricketer who has played in Bangladesh and in ICC events, I’m deeply disappointed by the ICC’s inconsistency. It accepted India’s security concerns for not touring Pakistan in 2025, yet appears unwilling to apply the same understanding to Bangladesh,” Afridi wrote.Calling for a level playing field, Afridi emphasised that cricket’s global administrators must treat all nations equally.“Consistency and fairness are the foundation of global cricket governance. Bangladesh’s players and millions of its fans deserve respect — not mixed standards. The ICC should build bridges, not burn them,” he added.The ICC confirmed on Saturday that Scotland will take Bangladesh’s place in the upcoming T20 World Cup, describing it as a “difficult decision” after concluding that relocating Bangladesh’s matches to Sri Lanka was not practical with the tournament just weeks away. The Bangladesh Cricket Board had refused to allow its team to travel to India, citing security concerns following Mustafizur Rahman’s exit from the IPL.Despite those claims, the ICC reiterated that its assessments found no credible or verifiable threat to Bangladesh players, officials or supporters in India, and therefore ruled out any change to the published schedule. Scotland’s inclusion from February 7 brought an end to prolonged uncertainty, during which the BCB had remained firm on its stance and even floated the idea of exchanging its group with Ireland.During Wednesday’s ICC Board meeting, Bangladesh’s proposal to move fixtures was rejected by a decisive 14–2 vote, with Pakistan the lone supporter.Announcing the outcome, the ICC said, “Bangladesh will no longer compete in the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, after the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) refused to participate in the tournament per the published match schedule.” It added, “The decision follows an extensive process undertaken by the ICC to address concerns raised by the BCB regarding the hosting of its scheduled matches in India.”Later, the BCB acknowledged the ruling, admitting there were no further options available. Media committee chairman Amjad Hossain said in Dhaka, “We have tried our best. We fully respect the ICC Board, and the Board’s majority decision was that the match cannot be relocated.”He continued, “Even after that, we tried in our own way and made requests. Since they will not do it or do not want to, there is nothing more we can do,” before reiterating, “We have accepted the ICC Board’s decision, as the ICC has said that we will not be able to go and play, nor can our match be shifted to Sri Lanka.”Hossain also confirmed that the board would not pursue further remedies. “In this case, we cannot go to India to play, and our stance remains the same. We are not going into any separate arbitration or any other process here.""Sources indicated that senior ICC officials, including chairman Jay Shah, were in Dubai on Friday, with an email later sent to BCB chairman Aminul Islam Bulbul formally conveying the decision. The ICC reiterated, “The ICC’s assessments concluded that there was no credible or verifiable security threat to the Bangladesh national team, officials or supporters in India.""In light of these findings, and after careful consideration of the broader implications, the ICC determined that it was not appropriate to amend the published event schedule,"" the statement added.The ICC also revealed it had given Bangladesh a 24-hour deadline to confirm participation. “As no confirmation was received within the deadline, the ICC proceeded in line with its established governance and qualification processes to identify a replacement team.”Scotland, ranked 14th in T20Is, were next in line. “Scotland are the next-highest ranked T20I team that had originally missed T20 World Cup qualification. They are currently ranked 14th, which in fact is ahead of competing teams Namibia, the United Arab Emirates, Nepal, USA, Canada, Oman and Italy.""Scotland has been called up to take Bangladesh’s place in Group C, joining England, Italy, Nepal and the West Indies.""Scotland will face West Indies on February 7, Italy on February 9 and England on February 14 in Kolkata, before meeting Nepal in Mumbai on February 17.Behind the scenes, Bangladesh Sports Ministry advisor Asif Nazrul had advised against travelling to India despite repeated ICC assurances. In a last-ditch effort, the BCB also approached the ICC’s Dispute Resolution Committee, only to discover it could not hear appeals against decisions made by the ICC Board. Although independent security assessments rated the threat level as “low to moderate”, Nazrul, representing the interim government, directed that the team would not travel. A subsequent meeting with players was described as one-sided, with Nazrul informing the squad that they would not be allowed to take part in the tournament.",Shahid Afridi has criticised the International Cricket Council.

Triple talaq-halala FIR puts focus on legal grey area,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/triple-talaq-halala-fir-puts-focus-on-legal-grey-area/articleshow/127206877.cms,".

NEW DELHI: When police in UP registered an FIR on Dec 9, 2025, it was not just another complaint under the 2019 Triple Talaq law. The allegations were shocking and went further, into a grey zone the law has never squarely addressed: What happens to women after talaq is pronounced.According to the FIR filed in Amroha’s Said Nagli, the woman, after being divorced through instant triple talaq, was pressured by her husband, her brother-in-law and clerics to undergo “ halala ” multiple times so she could be returned to the marriage. An exception that permits a divorced Muslim couple to remarry, the practice of halala often involves planned, short-term marriages — even arranged one-time encounters — to facilitate consummation of the woman with another man, enabling the former couple to reunite.The woman’s complaint detailed the ordeal. She said she was “gang-raped under false pretenses of halala carried out under threats, intimidation and coercion”.Police have invoked the law banning instant triple talaq — sections 3 and 4 of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019. Multiple provisions and relevant sections of BNS that deal with rape, aggravated hurt, criminal intimidation and criminal conspiracy, have also been added.In the initial FIR, there are three accused: Her husband, his cousin and a hakim (traditional healer.) Since then, police have added more accused to the list.Amroha police told TOI that one accused — her husband — had been arrested so far. “The FIR has been registered on the basis of a written complaint. Further action will depend on corroboration and evidence,” SHO Vikas Sahrawat said. Amroha police are on the lookout for others on the run, he added.This week, based on Zubaida’s (name changed) age at the time of her marriage, police added multiple provisions of the Pocso Act to the FIR, expanding its scope. (The move, incidentally, also brings into focus an unresolved legal grey area, as Muslim personal law is not codified and does not prescribe a minimum age, instead linking marriageability to puberty. The issue remains unsettled by the Supreme Court so far, with courts in different states taking conflicting positions. )The FIR covers several years of alleged abuse, assault and rape. Zubeida told police she was forcefully married off in 2015 at the age of 15, and subjected to pronouncements of instant triple talaq twice — once in 2016, and again in 2021, followed by three coerced reconciliation attempts through halala.“I felt like I was being handed over every time. I was too ashamed to come out with what had happened to me. I didn’t want my daughter to grow up reading about it,” Zubaida told TOI. A former student of one of Aligarh’s top schools, Zubaida comes from a family with a history in public service — her grandfather was DSP in UP police and her father a lawyer.After the first triple talaq in 2016, she said she was told she could return to her husband only after undergoing halala, a process that, according to her complaint, involved sexual assault by someone introduced as an “intermediary”.In Feb 2025, she said she was told she would need to follow the halala process twice as her marriage had broken down twice by then. Zubaida’s complaint said after years of being a single mother and financial difficulties, she had once again fallen for the accused’s false promise of remarriage. “It was after a long time that I realised what had happened to me was wrong,” Zubaida said.With her husband now behind bars, Zubaida said she was struggling to keep life going for her daughter.Her husband, meanwhile, has alleged that he was harassed and threatened by Zubaida and her relatives. In his written complaint, dated Nov 26, 2025, he claimed that Zubaida “tried to forcibly enter his house and threatened him with false criminal cases”.Earlier in 2021, according to documents, Zubaida’s divorce was finalised through a family court’s decree, with the court placing the daughter’s custody with the father at the time.Halala finds no mention in Indian statutory law. The 2019 Muslim Women Act criminalised instant triple talaq, making its pronouncement a punishable offence, but it did not — and does not — recognise halala.According to activists, halala cases rarely leave a paper trail. Fear of stigma, economic dependence and concerns about children often keep victims silent.“In many cases, women don’t even know that what is being done to them is wrong,” said Zakia Soman, Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan founder. “Halala is not mentioned in the Quran. It survives through misinterpretation, patriarchal control and silence. There is a hush-hush around it. For a woman to come forward takes extraordinary courage.”Soman added that the practice survived in pockets, operating through informal and largely invisible set-ups. “Triple talaq was criminalised on paper, but the ecosystem that sustained it was never dismantled. Without regulations, halala survives as an unpoliced, underground arrangement,” she said.Soman cited cases where clerics themselves offered to “perform” halala, and others where women were passed between men to settle personal disputes, family feuds or even debts — arrangements that remain largely hidden unless a woman breaks ranks and approaches the police. Soman said practices such as halala, child marriage and puberty-as-marriage-age thrive in a legal grey zone.Experts point to structural gaps that make such cases hard to prosecute. One is the absence of mandatory registration of Muslim marriages and divorces. “Nikahs are largely undocumented,” said Naish Hasan, a Lucknow-based activist who has worked with halala survivors for over two decades. “When there is no paper trail, the burden of proof falls entirely on women.”She said the practice remained alive, particularly among poor and marginalised women. “For years, cases kept surfacing before we even had language for it,” she said.Hasan said her fieldwork included around 40 detailed case studies from Lucknow district alone. “Justice should reach every last woman,” she added. Petitions challenging the practice of halala, including one filed by Hasan in 2021, have been pe-nding before Supreme Court.","Police in Amroha, UP, have invoked the law banning instant triple talaq.

Tristan Stubbs was full of jokes on the eve of the fourth SA20 final against Pretoria Capitals. That is not just the fourth final of South Africa's T20 competition, but also for the Sunrisers Eastern Cape (SEC). No team has had a more jaw-droppingly good record in franchise cricket than the SEC. They've now been to all four finals and won the silverware twice.With Capitals skipper Keshav Maharaj joining him for media duties, Stubbs joked he would reveal their strategy only after the final at Newlands. He also elicited a chuckle upon revealing he had far too many requests for tickets. (Alas, Newlands is sold out for the SA20 final!)The 25-year-old was casual and calm even as his team took the longer route to their 'usual' place in the SA20 calendar. Having finished top of the league table, they lost to the Capitals in the first qualifier. During the second chance, they romped past Paarl Royals at the Wanderers.A few hours later, they were in the Western Cape, back in their usual territory -- preparing for the final, the skipper posing next to the trophy and taking questions at a swanky five-star hotel.And the skipper here, Tristan Stubbs, has plenty to prove going into the final. As the only new leader in the SA20 Season 4, Stubbs had giant Aiden Markram-shaped shoes to fill. So far, he's learnt the pressures of the job as things go along but hasn't shied away from seeking help from seniors like Quinton de Kock when stumped.“The most challenging has been some days you feel like you know exactly what needs to be done and then other days I'm like I have no clue what to do,” Stubbs said.“But I've had good senior players. We've pretty much bounced everything off each other, but it's just when some days you're so decisive and you know what you want to do and other days you get a gut feeling and some days it doesn't rock up,"" continued Stubbs who has contributed 129 runs from 11 matches this season at an average of 43 and produced a best score of an unbeaten 47.Therein lies the problem with most cricketers who take on captaincy duties - their free-flowing cricket goes for a toss. Having come into South Africa's T20 World Cup squad as an injury replacement for Donovan Ferreira, the pressure is on Stubbs to find form.Having been acquired by the SEC in 2022 for R9.2 million, Stubbs has been part of the franchise since the very beginning. He, alongside Marco Jansen and Jordan Hermann, have been to all finals now. Except the 2023/24 season, where Stubbs scored 301 runs at an average of 60.20 and strike rate of 168.15, the Knysna-born batter has not fulfilled his promise. Not yet at least.Stubbs, who is scoring at a disappointing strike rate of 119.44, is a shadow of the player who reached the highs of 378 runs in 14 innings in IPL 2024. The fall also cost him his place in the Proteas setup, which he regained only due to injuries.""He's got the experience and we do know that he's got the power game and the touch game and the complete package when he's firing,"" South Africa coach Shukri Conrad had said this week of Stubbs.“I think it's up to us to be able to unlock all of that again. And it might just be one little switch somewhere.""Both Stubbs and SEC would be hopeful that the switch gets flicked on Sunday evening -- when it all matters.When the SEC and Capitals met in the first qualifier, played at Kingsmead, the Sunrisers looked to be ahead at one point before Capitals got the job done with ease. That broke the SEC's three-match winning run over the Capitals, which stretched back to the previous season.Is revenge on his, and the team's, mind going into the final? Stubbs smiled slightly before saying, ""No no! There's no revenge! We start nought-for-nought, We'll plan like we do for most games,"" he explained.“The important thing I guess is not getting too far ahead of yourselves. I think that's the key in a final.“You don't look too far ahead. You play the current or in the moment. You never really try and put your foot off the pedal. If you've got a team on top, you try and, as best as you can, keep the pressure on as much as possible,” stated Stubbs.In their second SA20 final appearance, Pretoria Capitals chase their maiden success. In the 2023 season, Capitals had finished runners-up at the Wanderers. In the two seasons that followed, they didn't even qualify for the playoffs. A much-changed squad later, with Keshav Maharaj at the helm, and a legendary combination of Sourav Ganguly and Shaun Pollock running the show from the sidelines, they'd be keen on turning the tide this time.Speaking ahead of the final, Ganguly revealed he had met Dewald Brevis and Maharaj when the South African team were in India. He continued to stay in constant touch with the unit, as much as a month before start in late December.“It’s been good in the last 40 days. So, it’s been a good relationship. It’s not about the coach, it’s about the players. I’ve always tried to help these young boys, but it’s their intensity and their want to become better that is the reason that we’ve played so well,” he said during the JioStar Press Room.The likes of Brevis, Bryce Parsons and Sherfane Rutherford have benefitted from Ganguly and Pollock's presence in the dugout.""Ganguly is very excited.

How cool were Emmanuel Macron's sunglasses?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/how-to-buy-emmanuel-macrons-sunglasses/articleshow/127298460.cms,"‘What The Hell Macron’: Trump Mocks French President’s ‘Aviators’ During World Economic Forum

For sure. For sure

.





Albert Camus wrote in the opening lines of The Myth of Sisyphus, a must-read for anyone who feels low, or can read English: “There’s only one serious philosophical problem and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy. All the rest—whether or not the world has three dimensions, whether the mind has nine or twelve categories—comes afterwards.”It pains me greatly to disagree with the absurdity enthusiast, but there’s one question even more important than that: how cool were Emmanuel Macron’s sunglasses at the World Economic Forum? Say what you want about the French, they always know how to do things with style. Revolutions, republics, beheadings, exiles. Even their authoritarians have style. When Jean-Paul Sartre was arrested, Charles de Gaulle asked him to be released immediately, saying in a rather bathetic style: “One doesn’t arrest Voltaire.”All of which brings us to the current head of the Fifth Republic, Emmanuel Macron, who delivered a masterclass in French oratory with his emphasis on rule of law, standing up to bullies, and languid delivery (for sure, for sure).Yet the words coming out of his mouth were hardly as captivating as what he had on his face: a pair of Henry Jullien aviators worth 650 euros (US$750) or Rs 68,000.Even Donald Trump noticed, using his favourite words to describe them: “I watched him yesterday with those beautiful sunglasses—what the hell happened?”Macron’s office claimed it was to protect his eyes from a blood vessel; others wondered if it was another domestic tiff with his former teacher.But let’s cut to the chase. As Camus pointed out in the same essay, Galileo abjured the truth as soon as it endangered his life, because philosophical pursuits matter less than real-life questions, like: where can you get those glasses?Well all you have to do is head over to the company's temporary website.The glasses were crafted by Henry Jullien, a company founded in the Jura region of France—the Champagne region of French eyewear—that has been designing and producing high-end eyewear for a century, and like all French folks want to raise even utilatarian processes to philosophical pursuits.The company uses a technique called “doublé or” gold-laminate technology, a difficult and almost lost process where layers of pure gold are bonded to metal frames. It’s not mere plating; the gold becomes integral to the structure.Each frame is made through a rigorous artisanal process involving 279 individual steps.The impact showed up immediately in the markets. iVision Tech SpA, the Milan-listed parent company that owns Henry Jullien, saw its shares surge by nearly 28% in a single session after Emmanuel Macron’s sunglasses went viral at Davos, adding roughly €3.5 million (about $4 million) to its market capitalisation. The stock initially jumped around 6% before trading was briefly halted due to heavy volumes, and then continued climbing once trading resumed.But once Macron debuted them, the internet went berserk, crashing Henry Jullien’s website—perhaps undercutting Macron’s argument about Europe’s robust predictability. Thankfully, the French company found a workaround, setting up a temporary page and writing: “Following the significant visibility of the Pacific by Henry Jullien model, worn by President Emmanuel Macron at the Davos Forum, our eShop website is experiencing an exceptional volume of visits and enquiries. To ensure stable and secure access for everyone, we have enabled this official temporary page dedicated to purchasing the model.”So anyone who is part of the European Union can order them. If you are in any other part of the world, like the Americas or even post-Brexit UK, you will have to figure out some way to get your hands on them. Currently, the website says it will take seven days for them to be shipped.In his speech, Macron said: “…having a place like Europe, which sometimes is too slow, for sure, and needs to be reformed for sure, but which is predictable, loyal, and where, well, you know that the rule of the game is just a rule of law, it’s a good place. And I think this is a good place for today and for tomorrow.”We are not sure we agree with all that, but we do want those sunglasses.Because we imagine we would be as happy as Sisyphus wearing them.",Emmanuel Macron wore a pair of Henry Jullien aviators at the World Economic Forum.

Riyadh Metro witnessed a rare moment, not marked by a train’s arrival, but by the birth of a new baby on the platformThe incident took place at Al Andalus Station, where a baby was born, marking the first childbirth recorded on the Riyadh Metro network. What began as a routine day of travel quickly turned into an emergency that required swift action from staff on duty.According to Riyadh Public Transport, the operating team handled the situation with professionalism, composure and a strong sense of humanity. Female staff members supported the mother during the delivery and stayed with her until ambulance crews arrived, ensuring both mother and child were cared for in a calm and controlled environment.Officials said the incident underscored the team’s readiness and commitment to passenger safety, pointing to the coordinated and steady response during an unexpected and highly sensitive situation. The smooth handling of the birth was described as a reflection of the training and preparedness of frontline staff across the metro network.To commemorate the rare moment, Riyadh Metro presented the parents with a special gift that included two first-class Darb cards, each valid for one full year. A message of appreciation was also issued to recognise all staff members involved in the incident, acknowledging their role in turning a challenging situation into a safe and memorable outcome.The birth has since been viewed as a symbolic moment for Riyadh’s growing public transport system, highlighting that beyond moving passengers across the city, it also serves as a space where extraordinary human moments can unfold.","Riyadh Metro witnessed a rare moment, not marked by a train’s arrival, but by the birth of a new baby on the platform.

Qatar is set to experience unsettled weather at the start of the week, as strong northwesterly winds sweep across the country, raising dust levels, reducing visibility, and bringing a sharper drop in temperatures, the Qatar Meteorological Department has warned.According to the department, fresh to strong northwesterly winds are expected to affect most parts of Qatar on Sunday, January 25, and Monday, January 26. The winds, advancing from the northern Arabian Peninsula, are likely to create dusty conditions in several areas, which may at times lead to reduced horizontal visibility, particularly during periods of stronger gusts.The Qatar Meteorological Department also forecast a further fall in temperatures during this period, warning that residents may feel an increased sense of coldness, especially during the early morning and evening hours.Authorities have urged the public to remain cautious, particularly motorists who may be affected by poor visibility due to dust. Those heading outdoors are advised to take the changing weather conditions into account.Marine warnings will remain in effect around Qatar on both days, as strong winds are expected to impact sea conditions, making maritime activities more challenging during this period.","Strong winds will sweep Qatar on Sunday and Monday, bringing dust, low visibility, cooler temperatures.

Penguins in Greenland? The story behind the viral ‘Nihilist Penguin’ meme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/penguins-in-greenland-the-story-behind-the-viral-nihilist-penguin-meme/articleshow/127367596.cms,"Denmark To Cede Greenland To Trump? ‘Angers’ Putin & Xi, Backs Permanent NATO Presence In Arctic

What’s the buzz about?

Penguin, Depressed...

Social media reacts

Penguin, Depressed...

A psychological explanation





US President Donald Trump’s renewed focus on Greenland has taken an unusual turn, with the White House sharing an AI-generated image featuring the President walking alongside a penguin toward the Arctic island.The post, captioned “Embrace the penguin,” quickly drew attention online, not least because penguins do not live in Greenland or anywhere in the Northern Hemisphere.The image is now going viral on social media, triggering criticism and mockery from users who pointed out the geographical error, and others who were simply livid over Trump’s repeated assertion.The post came amid Trump’s continued rhetoric around Greenland, even as he has paused tariff-related tensions with Europe, and was seen by many as another symbolic assertion linked to his long-standing interest in the strategically located territory.However, the White House post was not the starting point of the internet’s sudden fascination with penguins. Even before Trump’s image went viral, penguins were already trending online, driven by a resurfaced documentary clip that has spawned millions of memes and sparked widespread debate over its meaning.A short clip showing a lone penguin walking away from its colony toward distant Antarctic mountains has gone viral, earning the nickname “Nihilist Penguin.”Netizens have cast the animal as a symbol of existential crisis, rebellion and self-discovery.The footage originates from ‘Encounters at the End of the World’, a 2007 documentary by filmmaker Werner Herzog.In the scene, an Adélie penguin leaves its coastal colony and heads inland toward icy mountain ranges roughly 70 km from the sea — a direction that offers no food or breeding grounds for the species.Adélie penguins typically remain close to the coastline, where they breed and hunt. Long, purposeful inland treks are rare and not considered normal survival behaviour. The clip’s stark visuals and solitary subject have helped it gain renewed traction online nearly two decades after it was filmed.On social media platforms, users have overlaid the video with captions such as “The penguin knows” and “heading toward oblivion,” projecting human emotions and philosophical meaning onto the animal’s movement. Wildlife experts caution against such interpretations.Scientists say there are several possible explanations for the penguin’s behaviour. These include disorientation, particularly among younger or inexperienced birds; illness or injury affecting navigation; or rare instances of exploration or dispersal.“Well, I've never seen a penguin bashing its head against a rock,” says seabird ecologist Dr David Ainley in the documentary. However, he adds, “They do get disoriented.”He went on to say further that “even if they would have brought that lone penguin back into his colony, he probably would have again gone back towards the mountains.”Many stress that deviations from typical animal behaviour do not imply intent or awareness. In wildlife biology, such actions are usually attributed to individual variation, environmental stressors or health-related factors rather than conscious decision-making.The big question is – Why did that penguin do so? Though there could be several permutations and combinations that could be brought together to present an explanation, one of them could be:In 1920 Sigmund Freud wrote a book – ‘Beyond the pleasure principle’ – in which he went on to divide human behaviour into two parts.One ‘Eros’ – the life instinct. This is the force that keeps us alive, pushing for survival and reproduction.Second ‘Thanatoos’ – the death drive. And this is the more dangerous of two.Freud argues life is full of chaos and tensions and Thanatoos being the force of repulsion and destruction pushes to put that chaos to end and return to silence. He makes the point that when one everyday wakes up and goes about daily life they push away Thanatoos.Probably that penguin didn’t have consciousness and couldn’t push away the Thanatoos.While the internet has turned the clip into a cultural symbol, scientists view it as an isolated and scientifically interesting observation — a reminder of the limits of human interpretation when applied to animal behaviour.","US President Donald Trump’s renewed focus on Greenland has taken an unusual turn.

Player 58 Jack McKenna’s smart move in Beast Games Season 2 cubes challenge has fans divided,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/player-58-jack-mckennas-smart-move-in-beast-games-season-2-cubes-challenge-has-fans-divided/articleshow/127435186.cms,"Image Via Instagram

Jack McKenna proves he’s the smart player in Beast Games Season 2 cubes challenge





Player 58, named Jack McKenna, gained acclaim from Beast Games viewers during its second season after displaying an intelligent and strategic maneuver during the cube challenge round. During the cube competition, teams consisting of three players had to stay inside a giant cube until one of the players chose to self-eliminate from the competition. As a member of the smart team, consisting of players Sue, Tyler, and himself, Player 58 decided to manipulate the cards to ensure that the next card pulled from the cube was the lowest card for Sue, securing passage to the next round for both him and Tyler while evoking some controversy among gamers questioning if such an act was unfair.The show, which streamed on Prime Video, focused on aspects of strategic gameplay, luck, and psychology that Beast Games is known for, especially in cube challenge tests, in which participants could opt-in for a method of determining who would eliminate themselves. Jack's strategic gameplay, planning, and execution of his second deck of cubes demonstrated his reputation as an intelligent player of this game. Even Sue, a former Survivor contestant, admitted she had hoped to go far in the game, which made Jack’s tactic even more impressive and sparked online debates about strategy, trust, and its impact on future rounds.Jack McKenna later explained to MrBeast how he prepared for the challenge. He said he prearranged the cards to know where the highest ones were and used this knowledge to his advantage. Although Sue tried to shuffle the deck, Jack had a backup deck ready, showing foresight and planning. The moment illustrated not only his clever thinking but also his understanding of human behavior and teamwork. Tyler admitted he didn’t know about the second deck, proving how much Jack’s strategy influenced the outcome.While the fans on Reddit and Instagram were split between views on the decision made by Jack, some believed that the action might convey a disadvantage if he were to participate in further rounds due to the need to have trust in the game. However, there were others who felt that he demonstrated intelligence because the rules stated that the teams were given the chance to choose the way they were going to self-eliminate.Jack, a Christian Brothers Academy graduate from Albany, and a current junior majoring in electrical and computer engineering from Purdue University, has already shown that he has what it takes to blend brains with brio under challenging circumstances. Be sure to check back with Beast Games Season 2 later to see whether Jack’s clever approach will get him to the finale or whether lapse of trust will get him expelled from the race.","Player 58, named Jack McKenna, gained acclaim from Beast Games viewers during its second season after displaying an intelligent and strategic maneuver during the cube challenge round.

She claimed that while these messages were being shared, Kai was still with her, and Brianna was sending him supportive texts without knowing the full situation. Gigi also accused Kai’s friends of celebrating the breakup while previously trying to flirt with her during the relationship.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Gigi addressed rumors linking her to NBA YoungBoy directly, denying that she ever cheated with him.

Candace Owens ' claims about Charlie Kirk's death





Controversial social media personality Andrew Tate has refuelled theories on the assassination of right-wing political activist, Charlie Kirk . In a recent podcast appearance, Tate claimed that he knew ""who killed Charlie Kirk"", despite Tyler Robinson having been charged with for the crime in September 2025.On January 23rd, 2026, he appeared in an episode of Jack Neel's podcast where he was asked if Kirk's death was a result of ""feminism"". ""Let's talk as professionals here. Sorry for the pause. I'm just scanning what’s going to keep me alive,"" he said while looking to the side and taking a breath.""So I know who killed him. And the only person who is overtly giving theories as to who killed him publicly is Candace [Owens]."" According to the 39-year-old former professional kickboxer, Owens is being ignored because people are putting it ""down to Black female hysterical actions.""""And the people in charge have thought, they’ve concluded, 'You know what, let a Black woman scream.' Most people will — even if they listen to her — it’s a Black chick, and we’re just gonna let her scream into the air, and we’ll just put it down to Black female hysterical actions. We’ll just put it down to that,"" he added.He also claimed that the culprits are trying to push the narrative that ""she's nuts with paid influencers.""He added that ""even if she gets it perfectly right,"" they were going to convince everyone that she wasn't.Tate who seemed visibly determined to address the incident, also added that Owens would have been taken more seriously if she were a man. ""If you're a man in a sharp suit... there still is that degree of misogyny in the world where a man is taken a bit more seriously with some things,"" he said. ""And then if you get it right on the money with a different tone, and they can't really call you crazy... if you don’t give them the second life, if you don’t give them an easy layup, well, then, you pay the price. ""Owens, who is a popular political commentator and theorist has made numerous claims about her late friend Charlie Kirk's death. According to her Robinson wasn't the only one behind the planned assassination. Instead, people from Kirk's own foundation Turning Point USA are the ones to blame.""I received information last night that put the final pieces together for me,"" she stated on a December 2025 episode of her podcast. ""I now can say with full confidence that I believe Charlie Kirk was betrayed by the leadership of Turning Point USA and some of the very people who eulogised him on stage.""While she also announced that she will be ""naming names and providing evidence for my claims"" she has yet to do so. Owens, however, has launched a targeted attack on the slain activist's widow, Erika Kirk. According to her, TPUSA has been conducting what she dubbed ""witch trials"" against employees under Erika's new leadership. They are being questioned, terminated or intimidated over perceived loyalty to the new CEO.","Controversial social media personality Andrew Tate has refuelled theories on the assassination of right-wing political activist, Charlie Kirk.

During a Kick livestream, Ross admitted he had not showered in two days and argued that daily bathing only makes sense after swimming or heavy activity. His blunt remarks quickly divided viewers online.

Adin Ross sparks online debate after calling daily showering a lie





The culture of the Internet works on exaggeration, but here and there a remark, an unworthy of any seriousness, can strike a chord. This is precisely what transpired when Adin Ross made a viral discussion about hygiene, the truth, and habits that humans overrate on the internet through a confession on a casual livestream. What started as a joke of grooming soon turned into an abrupt comment that left the viewers in an argument long after the stream was over.Ross has constructed his brand on raw views and this time was not an exception. His remarks pierced influencer polish and zapped into something strange and easy to relate to. To what extent is what people say on the internet really the case and to what extent is it acting?During a Jan. 21 Kick livestream, Ross admitted he had not showered in two days, then doubled down when viewers pushed back. He dismissed the idea that most people bathe daily, calling it unrealistic rather than admirable.“There’s no f*****g way that you guys shower every f*****g day,” he said around the 30-minute mark. “There’s no way. I don’t believe it. I’m sorry. That, to me, is the biggest lie ever. Because I get it — you’re on stream, and you’re six foot five with eight packs. But the reality is, you don’t shower every day.”Ross argued that daily showers only make sense under specific conditions.“The only time I believe you shower every day is if you’re, like, getting in the ocean, or you are getting in a chlorine pool. But if you’re just outside or in bed, you’re not showering every day.”This was not the first time Ross shared such habits. He has previously said he went three days without showering, and on another occasion admitted to stretching it to four. Fans see these moments as part honesty, part provocation.The streamer also stirred controversy elsewhere in the same broadcast cycle. Responding to criticism after comments about Doechii, he lashed out at Joe Budden, saying, “Also, Joe Budden, you’re a p****y, f**k you. Let’s link up, you know where I’m at. I got police with me, too. … I got police with me, and I’m in your city, what’s good? What you wanna do?!”Whether viewers agree or cringe, Ross keeps proving one thing. Saying the quiet part out loud still grabs attention, especially when it makes people question their own everyday claims.","Adin Ross sparks online debate after calling daily showering a lie.

The backlash around Kai Cenat’s fashion debut has exposed a familiar fault line in creator culture. The moment a streamer steps outside the lane that made them famous, the internet sharpens its knives. Cenat’s new clothing brand, Vivet, was meant to mark personal growth and creative risk. Instead, it became a lightning rod for critics who dismissed the project before it ever reached consumers.That response did not sit well with DDG. Watching the conversation spiral into mockery, he chose to speak loudly and publicly. His defense was not polished or restrained. It was emotional, blunt, and rooted in frustration with what he sees as selective outrage within the same community that celebrates legacy brands without question.On a livestream, DDG made it clear that he plans to support Cenat with his wallet, saying he would buy the full Vivet collection when it drops. He then turned his focus to what he views as hypocrisy among critics who line up for decades old sneaker releases while tearing down a peer trying something new.“Quit hating on my dog, man. But y'all buy these random, random-ass white man shit, and you would just buy it and buy it and buy it and stand outside for Jordans and all this other shit,” DDG said.“But when you see a young n***a trying to do something different and change the motherfucking trajectory of fucking content creators and get into this fashion shit, y'all want to hate on it. But you would walk your same stanky ass in Foot Locker and set up a f***ing tent for some fucking J's that dropped 20 f***ing years ago.”He did not stop there.“Can't stand this goddamn community, n***a. You don't even know who the fuck made them goddamn J's. And you don't know who the fuck made them damn whatever the f**k you got on right now. You don't know who made that shit.""If your ass gonna spend your money on it, you ain't never write no f*****g hate comment or tweeted bad about them nas. But since you know the na that's making this shit, and you watch the na and all this other shit, now it's a fucking problem. Can't stand you nas.”“Every n***a that's successful, when they try to do something different, you always hate on them.”Despite the noise, Cenat has stayed focused. From unveiling his Vivet journal to showing up at Paris Fashion Week, he continues to push forward, betting that long term vision will speak louder than early hate.","DDG publicly defended Kai Cenat after backlash over his new clothing brand, Vivet. He criticized fans for celebrating legacy sneaker brands while tearing down creators who try something new. DDG argued that successful creators are often attacked for growth.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127359282,imgsize-35944,width-400,resizemode-4/127359282.jpg"

What began as an effort to challenge mainstream narratives now draws concern over tone, intent, and impact on private individuals. The controversy has sparked debate about responsibility, ethics, and accountability in independent media with large, loyal audiences.

From Viral Clip To Trust Crisis: Erika Kirk Faces Mounting Backlash | WATCH

Critics say Candace Owens’ investigative focus has crossed a troubling line





The latest wave of backlash surrounding Candace Owens is not about a single clip or a fleeting online spat. It reflects a deeper unease among former allies and observers who believe a once-curiosity driven project has drifted into something far harsher. What began as an attempt to challenge official narratives now feels, to critics, like a campaign fueled more by grievance than truth.The main focus of the tension is the increasing worry about power and responsibility. Intent is important when a personality in the media has a loyalty and monetizable audience. There is a criticism that there has been a blurred line between the investigation and personal targeting particularly when ordinary citizens are the subject of a speculation in the media. That change has caused unease even among those who were previously espoused to the greater cause.The criticism is not rooted in disagreement alone. It is about tone, direction, and consequence. Observers say the messaging no longer feels like a search for clarity but a sustained pressure campaign that invites followers to draw damaging conclusions. The worry is less about lawsuits or optics and more about what happens when influence outpaces restraint.The unease intensified after Owens openly discussed potential new content tied to Erica Kirk, framing it as an extension of past projects. While Owens maintains she is filling a void left by mainstream outlets, detractors argue that repeating this model risks amplifying rumors instead of resolving them.They also question whether invoking investigative language justifies placing a grieving family member under a spotlight they never sought. Here is the full statement that reignited the debate:""We need an Erica Kirk series, just like the Brigitte Macron series. Well, I do want to do perhaps not an entire series, but a couple of episodes dedicated to that, which we have been working on in the background to give everybody something solid. There's a lot of, like I said, innuendo online, some things that are true, some things that are not true, but I do think given the size and scale of this company, the public does deserve, and since the media is never going to do it, the mainstream media apparatus is never going to do it, something that is solid and backed by facts and documents that tells you about who this new CEO is. ""For now, Turning Point USA has remained publicly restrained. Whether that patience holds may depend on whether this project returns to transparency or continues down a path critics describe as unnecessarily dark.","Former supporters and observers question the direction of her latest investigative plans. What began as an effort to challenge mainstream narratives now draws concern over tone, intent, and impact on private individuals.

Who was Sebastian Charles?

Academic Dedication: He was known for making his Year 4 lessons engaging and accessible to all.

Warm Personality: A ""steady presence"" who was deeply valued by his peers for his kindness and strong character.

Community Connection: He had already become a recognizable and loved figure around the school grounds, known for his welcoming smile and positive energy.

Impact





A beloved Year 4 teacher at Durham School Dubai tragically lost his life in a road accident over the weekend, sending shock waves through the school community. Principal Kieran McLaughlin confirmed the sad news in a message to parents, explaining that Sebastian Charles, who had joined the school only recently, was well-liked by pupils and staff alike and had quickly made a positive impact.Although he hadn’t been at the school long, Charles’s caring nature and professional dedication made him a favourite among the children, and his sudden passing deeply saddened the entire community.In his letter to parents, Principal McLaughlin expressed how devastating the loss is for a community built around learning and hope. He wrote that such moments are particularly hard because schools symbolise future aspirations, and losing a respected member of staff affects everyone deeply.To help students cope, the school has arranged for a grief counsellor from a private hospital to be available for any pupil needing emotional support. Parents were asked to communicate with their child’s class teacher if they think additional help is needed.McLaughlin also encouraged families to talk openly with their children about the tragedy, noting that every child may react differently and that extra care and understanding are important during such a difficult period.Sebastian Charles was more than just a teacher; he was described by the school leadership as a popular educator who ""quickly established himself"" and won the hearts of the children in his class. Colleagues and parents alike noted his infectious enthusiasm and the genuine care he showed for every student under his wing.The school's principal highlighted that even in his brief tenure, Mr. Charles had left an indelible mark:In recognition of the somber mood and to show respect for Charles’s memory, the school decided to postpone its planned sports day events for EYFS and Key Stage 1 that had been scheduled for the following Wednesday. These activities will now take place next week, allowing the community time to grieve.The principal asked the school community to honour Charles respectfully and avoid speculation, especially on social media, during this sensitive time. He assured parents that in due course the school will find an appropriate way to remember Mr Charles.The loss of an educator is a loss for the entire city. In a transient city like Dubai, teachers often become a ""second family"" for expat children, making such tragedies feel deeply personal for everyone involved. As the school prepares to honor his memory with a formal service, the outpouring of love from parents and former colleagues across the UAE serves as a testament to the fact that it is not the length of time one spends in a role, but the depth of the heart they bring to it.","Sebastian Charles, a Year 4 teacher at Durham School Dubai, died in a road accident.

She passionately spoke of his unwavering dedication amidst adversity, battling both racism and physical hardships to forge a better future for his family.

Social media reactions:

Your dad and your mam are heroes Narinder I know what you mean I worked in the shipyards on the Tyne , and I’m sure they would be proud of you , your also a hero fighting against racism , I for one salute you

Good for you Narinder that your Dad was so honest and hard working.

I've said a 100 times on here... The ""Immigrants"" living near me are all bloody hard working and conscientious.

Beautifully put, and on top of that supporting extended family members as well as looking after their own families. They were hard workers, hard graft, in a tumultuous time for the country.

You don't have to prove anything Narinder. It's bloody awful that you have to give people your background, it's ridiculous. People can be so weird and downright nasty with it.





British broadcaster and television personality Narinder Kaur has called for immigrants to be given fair chances as the UK enters 2026, sharing a personal story about her father’s life and hard work.In a post on X, Kaur wrote that she normally would not share a photo and the early life of her father as a poor immigrant, but this time made an exception only to speak out against growing anti-immigrant rhetoric. “My dad came from India in the early 60s and went straight into hard labour. No help. Not a penny given. Double shifts at the steel foundry for YEARS. The kind of work that ruins your body and shortens your life. Heat, noise, pain, exhaustion—day after day. He didn’t get a choice,” she said.Kaur described how her father and uncles endured racism and hardship in the British land but survived, saving money and building a life in a foreign place. “Every shift he worked went into that shop in Newcastle. That shop didn’t come from luck, talk, or ideas. It came from steel work, double shifts and pain… Earned with his body,” she wrote, adding that the whole family contributed to the business, including Kaur and her siblings.Kaur explained that so much physical labour can take a toll on any person, and said that her parents and uncle died young because of it. “No—the generation of immigrants back then weren’t different to the new. The new immigrants ALSO are desperate to work and make a life for themselves,” she said.Kaur concluded by urging a change in how immigrants are viewed in 2026. “This narrative must change and we must give others a chance,” she said. She highlighted every instance of resilience, dedication, and contribution of immigrant families to British society.","British broadcaster and television personality Narinder Kaur has called for immigrants to be given fair chances as the UK enters 2026.

A 12-year-old boy has died after attempting to replicate a scene from the South Korean Netflix series Squid Game as a prank.An inquest ruled that the boy, Sebastian Cizman, died by hanging, with reports suggesting he was trying to jokingly imitate a character who died in the same way on the show. Earlier that day, Sebastian, described as a “prankster,” had shared an image of the scene in a WhatsApp group, as reported by The Telegraph.Sebastian’s search history also showed that he had viewed a YouTube video on ‘surviving choking alone.’ His parents, Marcin and Katarzyna, described him as a happy child with no known mental health issues.The Wakefield inquest heard that the “star” schoolboy had been playing with his cousins in the garden before going inside, saying he was tired. He was later found unresponsive on the staircase by one of his cousins after his father, Marcin, returned home from work with ice cream.Despite resuscitation efforts by his parents and paramedics, Sebastian was pronounced dead at the hospital. The inquest also noted that he enjoyed making friends laugh and had previously pretended to be unconscious while play-fighting.Philip Dore, headmaster of St Wilfrid’s Catholic High School in Featherstone, described Sebastian as a popular, happy, and humorous student.Detective sergeant Paul Bayliss suggested that the boy’s “prankster nature,” interest in Squid Game, and the image on his phone offered a possible explanation for his death.“It’s hard what I’m going to say, but I hope that the loss of my child is going to help some other children to understand. And for the people that run these social media platforms to do something, to stop it from happening.How many kids have to die until they do something? My message to other parents is check your children’s phones before it is too late,” Katarzyna Cizman was quoted as saying by the Telegraph.","Sebastian Cizman, 12, died after attempting to replicate a scene from the South Korean Netflix series Squid Game as a prank.
