NEW DELHI: The Indian men's cricket team is aiming to break a 17-year trophy drought at the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup 2024, to be held in the West Indies and the United States in June. The team, led by Rohit Sharma and vice-captain Hardik Pandya , includes notable players like Virat Kohli and Suryakumar Yadav.India, the inaugural T20 World Cup champions in 2007 under MS Dhoni's captaincy, haven't won the title since. They last reached the final in 2014, losing to Sri Lanka, and were semi finalists in 2016 and 2022, losing to West Indies and England.In the upcoming tournament, India is placed in Group A alongside hosts USA, Canada, Ireland, and arch-rivals Pakistan. Their campaign kicks off against Ireland on June 5 in New York, followed by highly anticipated matches against Pakistan and the USA at the same venue. Their final group stage match against Canada will be played in Florida.In the context of their history, India has maintained a strong record against Ireland in T20 cricket, winning seven out of eight matches, with one game being abandoned due to rain.With lateral movement early on and spin coming into play later in the game, scoring runs might be difficult. This indicates that bowlers will have a significant role in determining the outcome of the match.Considering the ground stats from the T20 World Cup 2024, where the team batting second won the only match played so far, it might be beneficial to consider bowlers and technically sound batters who are willing to patiently build their innings without taking unnecessary risks for fantasy contests.The conditions at the Nassau County Cricket Stadium, as observed from the Sri Lanka vs. South Africa match, suggest a challenging pitch for batsmen. Additionally, picking Indian bowlers could offer rewards, but it's also wise not to overlook Irish bowlers, as they could also make an impact.Virat Kohli enters the T20 World Cup 2024 brimming with confidence following an outstanding IPL 2024 season, where he finished as the highest run-scorer. Known for his exceptional performances in T20 World Cups, Kohli is poised to be a crucial player for India. His form and experience make him a prime choice for fantasy contests in the tournament.Jasprit Bumrah's performance will be pivotal to India's success in the T20 World Cup 2024. His wicket-taking prowess, demonstrated in the IPL 2024, will be crucial on a pitch that favors bowlers. Bumrah's ability to exploit the conditions makes him a reliable pick for fantasy contests.The Nassau County Cricket Stadium pitch showed tendencies to aid spin as the ball aged, as seen in the match between Sri Lanka and South Africa. Kuldeep Yadav's spin bowling could be a decisive factor in such conditions. His performance could significantly impact both the match outcome and fantasy contests, making him a valuable addition to any fantasy team.Rohit Sharma (C), Hardik Pandya (VC), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant (WK), Sanju Samson (WK), Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed SirajPaul Stirling (captain), Mark Adair, Ross Adair, Andy Balbirnie, Curtis Campher, Gareth Delany, George Dockrell, Graham Hume, Josh Little*, Barry McCarthy, Neil Rock (wk), Harry Tector, Lorcan Tucker (wk), Ben White, Craig Young.Wicketkeepers: Rishabh Pant, Lorcan TuckerBatters: Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, George DockrellAll-rounders: Mark Adair, Curtis Campher, Hardik PandyaBowlers: Jasprit Bumrah, Kuldeep Yadav, Arshdeep SinghIn summary, focusing on bowlers and resilient batters who can handle tricky conditions will be key to fantasy success for the India vs. Ireland match at the T20 World Cup 2024.","India are aiming to break a 17-year trophy drought at the ICC T20 World Cup 2024.

Be it the ICC World Test Championship final, the ODI World Cup final, or T20s, Travis, you are a man for every format of the game...

What was the IPL experience like with Sunrisers Hyderabad?

Australia lost the first two matches of the ODI World Cup but made a remarkable comeback to win the title.

Will Rohit Sharma be under any sort of pressure in the T20 World Cup, especially after losing the ODI World Cup at home?

How about another India vs Australia final?

How would you describe the Australian aggressive brand of cricket?

How would you describe Pat Cummins as a captain and as a player?

Can you describe the sports docuseries ""The Test"" on Amazon?

NEW DELHI: The memories of Travis Head 's onslaught in last year's ODI World Cup final at the packed Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad remain vivid in the minds of Indian cricket fans. After Australia restricted the Rohit Sharma-led team to a modest 240, Head had different plans. He unleashed a ferocious attack, sending the Indian players on a leather hunt and securing Australia's record sixth ODI World Cup title.India, whose last ICC triumph was the 2013 Champions Trophy under Mahendra Singh Dhoni , once again failed to clinch an ICC trophy on home soil.As India prepare to kick off their World Cup campaign against Ireland on Wednesday at New York's Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, all eyes will be on Rohit to lead the Men in Blue to the elusive ICC title.With stars like Rohit Sharma , Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant, Jasprit Bumrah, Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya , and Ravindra Jadeja in the squad, India enter the tournament as one of the favorites.What if another India vs Australia final happens at the T20 World Cup?Head, who dashed India's ICC title hopes twice last year with his explosive batting in the ODI World Cup final and the ICC World Test Championship final, would relish another showdown against Rohit's men in the ICC T20 World Cup. Head has also expressed his excitement about watching ""The Test,"" the Amazon sports documentary on the Australian men's cricket team's dominance.If both teams reach the final, they will face off again on June 29 at the Kensington Oval in Barbados.caught up with Head and spoke about the ODI World Cup final, the pressure of winning an ICC trophy on Rohit, Australia's dominance, Pat Cummins ' leadership, and much more...It's been something that I've been working on for a while. It's something that comes naturally, I guess. It's nice to be able to switch between formats, though it's tough to do. The challenge will come again in the summer, especially after a lot of IPL cricket, to make sure I've done the work to get ready for the Test matches. So, my mind's already working on some things that I want to accomplish before that time. It comes naturally, I guess. Ronnie (Andrew McDonald) and Pat (Cummins) have instilled the confidence in me to go out and play the way I see it. And that's all I try to do.It's been enjoyable. It's been seven years since I've been back. It was very nice to have Pat and Dan (Daniel Vettori) with me—familiar faces. I loved my time with Abhishek; he's an exceptional talent. We're in a good mindset, and the guys know what they need to do.It was an amazing campaign. I missed the start of it and came in halfway through. We had to piece everything together and fix all the issues, but it was incredible. Winning the World Cup was a career-defining moment for me. We've had a couple of those moments, honestly, including the Test Championship, so yes, a couple of really nice moments.I don't think Rohit has too much to worry about. He's been an exceptional leader for a period of time and is an exceptional player as well. So, I don't think there's any issue from that side of things. India is in good hands. I think you could probably name four or five teams that are going to be in the mix. Playing an attacking brand of cricket is crucial for them. With Rohit and Virat, and their exceptional bowling led by star bowler Bumrah, who has also been outstanding in the IPL, their chances are high. Their chances are probably similar to the three or four other teams that are in contention.(Laugh) It would be nice. It would be nice to be in the final. I think everyone in India would love that, especially considering what's happened in the last two finals. So, I'm sure India wants some revenge at some point. There would be good theater around it if that were the case. Let's hope that we're in it, and let's hope you're in it, and we'll see what happens.I feel it comes with the continuity of the team. The team's been together for four or five years now, and everyone's had moments where they've been able to perform and play well. So the confidence within the team is about backing each player to do the job. In big moments in some of the games, someone has always been able to stand up, and it's not always the same person. It's someone different each time. I think that's what makes a really good and creative team. It's not always going to go right, and we're not always going to win every single game, but in tough situations and tough moments, you know that hopefully you're that person, but if not, the person next to you can stand up in that moment.Pat (Cummins) really enjoys his time away from the game. Not just with his family, he also spends time with his mates, talks about big goals, has food and drinks. I think that brings a human aspect to it. The dressing room environment is relaxing and enjoyable. I like that he and Andrew McDonald (head coach) have established a great dynamic in terms of consistency in messaging, which has been steady for the last couple of years.He's probably evolved over the years and is now a lot more relaxed. He maintains a relaxed environment but also has a hard-nosed approach. He engages more with each player individually and discusses game plans, etc. It’s actually tough to pin down his style. He is very laid-back and relaxed, but in the background, he is very particular. He goes through a lot of stats and holds meetings. He's very calm and to the point, so there aren't too many long meetings or big team talks.Yeah, it's exciting. I think it provides a good perspective of what we're like on and off the field. The first two series have been received pretty well, with everyone back home and around the world enjoying it. And I think this one will be much the same.","Travis Head spoke to TimesofIndia about India's chances at the T20 World Cup. Head also spoke about the Australian aggressive brand of cricket.

Uganda secured their first-ever T20 World Cup win with a thrilling three-wicket victory over Papua New Guinea (PNG) at Providence Stadium on Wednesday. The match was a low-scoring but tense affair.Uganda bowled out PNG for a mere 77 runs; and despite a shaky start to their run-chase, which saw them slipping to 26 for 5, they reached the target in 18.2 overs, thanks to Riazat Ali Shah's knock of 33 runs.A crucial sixth-wicket partnership of 35 between Riazat and Juma Miyagi (13) turned the tide in favour of the tournament debutants. However, PNG will regret the moment when Riazat, on eight runs, was dropped by Charles Amini, who misjudged a straightforward catch.Defending such a low total was always going to be challenging for PNG, and they were further hindered by loose bowling, conceding 15 wides.After his catch was dropped, Riazat played a disciplined and focused innings. With just three runs needed for victory, he was caught by John Kariko at third man.The Ugandan team celebrated their historic win with dancing at the edge of the field. This victory, after surpassing the more established cricketing nation Zimbabwe to reach the tournament, marked their first points on the board.""That's a pretty special win for us. You know, first win at the World Cup,"" said Uganda skipper Brian Masaba. ""It doesn't get more special than this. I'm super proud of this group of guys. I mean, they've put in the work, they've put in such a shift. And to get a win for their country at the World Cup is very, very special.""Masaba won the toss and elected to field, a decision that paid off immediately as Alpesh Ramjani trapped PNG captain Assad Vala lbw with the second ball of the innings, completing a wicket-maiden opening over.Sese Bau attempted to drive Juma Miyagi but was caught by Roger Mukasa, who made an excellent catch running back from mid-off.Tony Ura followed in similar fashion, his attempted drive off Cosmas Kyewuta resulting in a straightforward catch for Mukasa at mid-on, leaving PNG in trouble at 19 for 3 in the fourth over.Lega Siaka appeared confident, scoring 12 off 17 balls, but a poorly judged attempt at a second run led to his run-out. When Charles Amini was bowled by Frank Nsubuga, PNG's focus shifted to damage control.Despite efforts from Hiri Hiri (15) and Kiplin Doriga (12), no other batsmen reached double figures, and the Pacific Islanders were bowled out with five balls remaining in their allotted 20 overs.","Uganda secured their first-ever T20 World Cup win with a thrilling three-wicket victory over Papua New Guinea.

Virat-Rohit combo stutters

NEW YORK: A hint of cloud, nip in the air, and a pitch with a bit of assistance. The Indian bowlers couldn't have asked for anything more as they looked to make their New York debut a memorable one at the Nassau International County ground on Wednesday.The fans might have preferred a slightly more competitive game, but as long as India win, no one cares. An eight-wicket win gave the favourites opportunity to flex their muscles. It was a toss that India wouldn't have liked to lose and once that fell in place, the four-man pace attack of Arshdeep Singh , Mohammed Siraj , Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya did all the damage. Of course, on a pitch where there was up-and-down bounce, the Ireland batters didn't have the knowhow to stretch the game deep.While Arshdeep (2-35) did the early damage, the most heartening aspect of the bowling display came from Hardik. It was absolutely crucial that the allrounder finds his bearings early on. The conditions were just right and Hardik shifted slightly from his normal style and looked to bowl a bit fuller. It paid off dividends as Lorcan Tucker got bowled. Hardik (3-27) did bowl a few slightly short as well and it kept getting difficult for the Irish batters.In the middle of all this, Bumrah (2-6) went about his business, hitting the right spots and looking virtually unplayable at times. With the variable bounce on offer, one could see that there was a fear-factor around Bumrah's bowling that made him all the more difficult to play.The opening combination of Virat and Rohit, who were doing the job together for the first time since March 20, 2021, was one of the prime attractions of this game. It would have been great for the partisan fans to see the two firing, but they only got aRohit show.Rohit survived a few close calls but the skipper buckled down and decided that in a chase of 97, he wouldn't miss out on some vital batting practice. Rishabh Pant , batting at No. 3 showed that all the hard work he had put in was paying off. Rohit and Pant's 54-run partnership sealed the game for India. But there was a small cloud of worry at the end.Just after Rohit had completed his half-century, a rising ball hit his shoulder, and the skipper quite clearly didn't want to aggravate the pain. At 76-1, Rohit walked off retired hurt. It was just the perfect day for the Men in Blue, but the fans would hope that the skipper is back to full fitness for the Sunday bash against Pakistan.",India beat Ireland by eight wickets in New York. Virat and Rohit scored 54 runs each. Rohit retired hurt at 76-1 after a rising ball hit his shoulder.

You have to be proactive, you can't pre-empt things.""You realise how the wicket is and then go back to what works for you. Once the seam goes down the pitch does settle down.

NEW DELHI: India captain Rohit Sharma scored 52 runs before retiring due to an arm injury during the team's opening match of the T20 World Cup against Ireland in New York on Wednesday.Despite the injury, Rohit reassured fans that it was not a serious concern. India secured a commanding eight-wicket victory in the match.The Indian bowling unit put on a stellar performance, restricting Ireland to a mere 97 runs. Arshdeep Singh, the left-arm fast bowler, set the tone by claiming two wickets in the third over, leaving Ireland reeling at 9-2 after Sharma had won the toss and elected to field.All-rounder Hardik Pandya further dented Ireland's hopes by taking two wickets in consecutive deliveries, finishing with impressive figures of 3-27.However, it was Jasprit Bumrah who stole the show, conceding only six runs in his spell and picking up two wickets, earning him the player of the match award for his outstanding bowling display.""Just a little sore,"" said Rohit at the presentation ceremony. ""New ground, new venue, wanted to see what's it like to play on. I don't think the pitch settled down, there was enough there for the bowlers.""Ireland, dismissed for a paltry 96, required flawless fielding to have any chance of causing an upset against India.However, in the first over of India's innings, Rohit Sharma, on just two runs, was dropped at second slip by Andrew Balbirnie off the bowling of Mark Adair.Adair managed to remove Virat Kohli for a single run, caught at deep third man, but India had already taken control of the match. The 2013 Champions Trophy winners were determined to begin their campaign for a major title with a dominant performance in Group A.Rohit capitalized on Ireland's missed opportunity, smashing 52 off just 37 balls, including four boundaries and three impressive sixes. He shared a partnership of 54 runs with Rishabh Pant, setting the foundation for India's commanding victory.Returning to international cricket after a horrific car crash in December 2022, the wicketkeeper finished unbeaten on 36, sealing the match with a flamboyant reverse-scooped six off Barry McCarthy as India won with nearly eight overs to spare.Rohit, however, was not alongside him at the end, having been struck on the arm by Josh Little earlier in the match. Despite the injury, Rohit managed to hit the next two balls from the paceman for resounding sixes.India, the inaugural 2007 T20 World Cup champions, had all but secured victory by dismissing Ireland cheaply on a drop-in pitch with variable bounce at the Long Island ground built specially for the tournament, which proved tough for batting.India's joy was tempered by the thought that they too might have to bat first on a similar surface when they return to the ground on Sunday to play arch-rivals Pakistan in the showpiece match of the group phase.""I don't know what to expect against Pakistan, we will prepare like the conditions are going to be like that,"" said Rohit.Bumrah, however, had few qualms, with the fast bowler saying: ""Coming from India, when you see the ball seaming around (here), I would never complain when there's help for the bowlers.""Only four Ireland batsmen reached double figures, Gareth Delany top-scoring with 26 before he was run out as the innings ended in the 16th over.""A tough one,"" said Ireland captain Paul Stirling. ""The toss played a really important part in overcast conditions and then the pitch offered all sorts.""We weren't quite up to that challenge and India bowled really well to put us under pressure.""","India beat Ireland by eight wickets in opening match of T20 World Cup in New York.

NEW DELHI: India captain Rohit Sharma was not pleased with the disconcerting bounce on the new drop-in pitch at Nassau County ground, which left him with a bruised right bicep ahead of the crucial T20 World Cup game against Pakistan in New York on Sunday.However, key pacer Jasprit Bumrah might appreciate such conditions, which are rarely found back home in India.Rohit scored 52 off 37 balls before being forced to retire hurt after a delivery from Ireland pacer Josh Little bounced unexpectedly high, causing him to miss a pull shot and get hit on the bicep of his right arm.""Yeah, just a little sore (the arm). I said it at the toss as well. Quite unsure of what to expect from the pitch. Not aware of what it is to play on a pitch that's five months old,"" Rohit said with a straight face at the presentation ceremony.But, the irritation caused by the variable bounce, resulting in the ball kicking from length, did indeed seem to bother him.""I don't think the wicket settled down even when we batted second. There was enough for the bowlers,"" the Indian skipper said as his pace quartet had Ireland bowled out for 96 in 16 overs.With three out of his four pacers having ample Test experience, the conditions were just what the doctor ordered.""Try to hit those lengths consistently. That's pretty much what you have got to do. All these guys have played a lot of Test cricket. Arshdeep is the only guy who hasn't. His two wickets upfront set the tone for us.""Bringing four spinners, Rohit isn't certain if they will be needed in New York, at least for the upcoming match.""Don't think we can play four spinners here (laughs). When we picked the team, we wanted to have the balance. If conditions are there for seamers, we wanted to have that. Spin will play a part later on (West Indies).""Today was a four-seamer pitch and we still managed to get two spinners who are all-rounders.""However, the Indian skipper isn't certain about what will be on offer during Sunday's game against Pakistan.""I don't know what to expect from the pitch to be honest. We will prepare as if the conditions are going to be like this (for the Pakistan game). This is going to be a kind of game where all of us will need to contribute.""Regarding his own innings, he was pleased to begin the tournament on a positive note.""It was scratchy, but good to spend some time in the middle and understand what kind of shots to play there.""Bumrah, who recorded figures of 2/6 in 3 overs, understandably has no complaints about the conditions.""Coming from India, with the ball seaming around, I wouldn't complain when there's help for bowlers.

You always want to cover all the bases in these conditions. You got to be prepared, very happy with the outing today.""Ireland skipper Paul Stirling acknowledged that the Indian team's performance left little opportunity for his side to take risks and play aggressive shots during the match.""We needed to put a bit of pressure back on the Indian bowlers.

The biggest enemy of France is France itself: Patrice Evra,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/the-biggest-enemy-of-france-is-france-itself-patrice-evra/articleshow/110744731.cms,"Excerpts:

Can France overcome their World cup loss by winning the Euro?

Do you think multiculturalism has worked well for France? Are things improving since your time as a player?

Do you think

Kylian Mbappe

is too young to be burdened with the responsibility of France’s captaincy?

Do you remember the day when you were made the captain of France in 2010?

How do you look at the other contenders at the Euros?

What about

Jude Bellingham

’s England?

Do you think he can finally help England land a trophy?

(Patrice Evra is the expert panellist on Sony Sports Network's studio show Football Extraaa for UEFA EURO 2024.)

Trust Patrice Evra to speak the harshest truth with an infectious smile across his face. The former captain of France and a Manchester United legend is as brutal in addressing issues of racism and politics in France as he was guarding the left flank at Old Trafford.No holds barred is Evra’s way. “It all started in 1998 after France won the World Cup. Dating a black player became a fashion,” he said about the constantly changing dynamics in France’s social fabric.Evra spoke to TOI on the upcoming European Championship and football’s impact on France and society at large.I think they are two completely different competitions. If you ask me if France, my country, is my favourite, I will say yes. But the biggest enemy of France is France itself. If you name all the squads in this tournament, no national team has a better squad than Les Bleus. We have a better bench as well. But sometimes we get too arrogant, we get too confident. It is in the French people’s DNA. And the last example is what happened in the last Euros when we were knocked out by Switzerland. We were up 3-1 till the 80th minute. We started dancing too early. They equalised and we lost in the penalties.But I’m confident this time, because this is the only trophy Didier Deschamps hasn’t won as a manager. In 2016, when I was playing, unfortunately we were beaten by Portugal in the final. I don't think the World Cup final loss will have any bearing because we played a great game.Racism is not about football, it’s about society. But football provides an amazing platform from which you can spread the message to counter the malaise. You remember what happened after the 2020 Euro final after Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka missed their penalties against Italy? Suddenly they stopped being English players. They become, you know, Jamaican or whatever. Similar things happened in France, too. When you lose, you become Senegalese.Since 1998, I can see this racist trend. When France won the World Cup suddenly it was okay to date a white woman because it was fashionable to be seen with a footballer, no matter if he was an Algerian or French or from Senegal or Congo.Of course, we are improving but issues are there. To stay silent is a crime. Let’s not put too much pressure on the footballers because this is a societal problem, and the government has to solve those issues. Punishment is not the solution. Education is the way forward.It’s politics. Let’s be very clear there. I’ve been captain of the national team and when things go right, everyone says you are a great leader. When things go wrong, trust me, everyone wants to destroy you. Mbappe too must face this. I think Mbappe’s age doesn’t matter anymore. If you got the quality and the personality, you could do the job. You saw the way Mbappe handled his transfer situation (to Real Madrid). He scored even in his last game for PSG.But yes, if France don’t win the tournament, the politicians and the people will dump the blame on the captain. If you play good or bad, they’re going to blame the captain. They’re going to say he didn’t lead the team to win the trophy. It happened to me. So, it’s a massive responsibility. But saying it’s too early or not, I don’t believe in that. You know, when I was named the captain of Manchester United, I couldn’t believe it because there were players like Rio Ferdinand, Ryan Giggs , Gary Neville, but Alex Ferguson made me the captain. The job of a leader is to create other leaders around yourself.It was a surprise. It was crazy because for all the pre-season and the World Cup qualification games, it was either William Gallas or Thierry Henry who were leading. I remember it was before a friendly before the World Cup in South Africa. We were scheduled to play against Costa Rica. I got down from the bus and had my headphones on when manager Raymond Domenech said, “Patrice, you’re the captain today.” And I said, “No, the captain is Gallas or Henry.” He said, “No, no, you are the captain.” At first, I was very proud. But I was also worried because the coach didn’t inform Gallas and Henry first. I did not want this decision to spoil our friendship. In fact, before the 2010 World Cup, there was a lot of turbulence in the dressing room. One part of me was happy, and on the other side I was worried that I would lose my friends.Germany is also a favourite because of their history. When you host the tournament, normally you get to the semifinal, or you win the tournament because you get pushed by all the home support. The players give their maximum. And especially for Toni Kroos, who will be playing his last tournament with the national team.Croatia too, I think, is a strong team. Luka Modric may also be playing his farewell tournament. Portugal has Cristiano Ronaldo, and he has another chance to win the Euro again. He won the last one against me and I wasn’t happy with that.What a fantastic season this young man has had with Real Madrid! England can be full of surprises. But some players had a long season and will be tired. So it is on their fitness coach, the doctor, to manage them well and make sure they are like 100% for the first game.The best thing about Jude is his personality. He had an amazing first season in Madrid. I think England will have one of the best midfields with Jude, Declan Rice, Phil Foden and Bukayo Saka. How they’re going to handle pressure will decide how far England can go in the tournament. Playing for your club is completely different than playing for your national team. But Jude can be the key because when you come out from a season winning everything, you bring along that winning aura. You want to win more. He will have a major role, but don’t forget their captain, Harry Kane. He will also have to score a lot of goals. He joined Bayern Munich and they failed to win the league. I feel he will have a point to prove.",Patrice Evra is the expert panellist on Sony Sports Network's studio show Football Extraaa for UEFA EURO 2024.

Wish India get more players like Chhetri: Kuwait coach

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: India's head coach, Igor Stimac , believes that a victory against Kuwait in the upcoming match on Thursday will essentially secure the nation's first-ever progression to the third round of the World Cup qualifiers . This achievement, according to Stimac, has the potential to transform the landscape of Indian football.The Croatian, who was part of the 1998 World Cup bronze-medal winning team, emphasised that India's advancement to the third round, where direct slots for the 2026 World Cup will be determined, would be the pinnacle of his entire career both as a player and a coach.""This can change the future of Indian football. Although I'm a foreigner in this country, I feel more like an Indian,"" Stimac said at the pre-match press conference in Kolkata.""Honestly this is the biggest game altogether in my playing and coaching career and the simple reason is that we have a chance to make 1.5 billion Indians happy tomorrow.""We need to do everything to make it happen. That's the reason this is the biggest game of my career together in the coaching and playing days,"" the 56-year-old said.India are presently holding the second position in their group, having accumulated four points. A victory against Kuwait would solidify their standing.Afghanistan, also with four points, will face off against the reigning Asian champions, Qatar, concurrently on Thursday.The goal difference is likely to be the determining factor in which team progresses to the third round as the second-place finisher in the group. India's goal difference stands at minus three, while Afghanistan's is significantly lower at minus 10.In their previous encounter in November last year, India emerged victorious against Kuwait, securing a 1-0 win in Kuwait City.Stimac mentioned he was feeling sad as Sunil Chhetri will be retiring after the match. However, he added that he might still give the ace striker one ""last call"" to play for India.""Of course as a coach I'm sad that Sunil is leaving us. I'm still not sure if I'm going to send him another call, if I feel we need him and he plays well for Bengaluru FC. I'm still thinking about it,"" he said in a lighter vein.Senior goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu had a sloppy outing against Afghanistan, resulting in India's shocking 1-2 loss, as his foul handed the opponents the winning penalty.However, head coach Igor Stimac has backed Gurpreet, naming him in the playing XI against Kuwait ahead of Amrinder Singh and Vishal Kaith.""Gurpreet is starting the game tomorrow. I don't question at this level and at such a high important level my goalkeeper who is number 1.""I hope he will prove himself again tomorrow and how crucial he is for the national team. Yes, he didn't do well but that doesn't mean as a coach I will go with radical changes between the post because experience at international level is a huge factor,"" he said.Stimac also mentioned that he might consider giving ""minutes"" to exciting I-League players David Lalhlansanga and Edmund Lalrindika on Thursday.India have some promising youngsters from the I-League, including David from the triumphant Mohammedan Sporting and Edmund Lalrindika from Inter Kashi. If either of them makes the cut, it will be the first time in five years that an I-League player debuts in the national jersey.""They are great assets for Indian football. Both of them have adapted to the squad, to the drills, to the environments in a very, very good way. They became an essential part of the 25-27 squad. They will be competing for their minutes,"" Stimac said.The Croat emphasised that the team's disappointing results in the recent World Cup qualifiers and Asian Cup were largely attributable to the sub-par performances of the substitute players. He insisted that the players coming off the bench delivered ""terrifying performances"" that significantly impacted the team's overall performance.The coach called upon the reserve players to elevate their game and make a positive contribution when called upon in upcoming matches. He stressed the importance of having a strong and reliable bench, capable of maintaining the team's level of play and competitiveness throughout the entire duration of a match.""All of us have noticed since the Kuwait win that we didn't have any positive impact from any player coming from the bench. That was terrifying for me as a coach,"" Stimac said.""I've pointed out to the boys because many times the bench players are more important than those who start the games.""Rui Bento, the head coach of Kuwait, acknowledged the formidable task that lies ahead when his team faces India. However, he emphasized that they have learned from their previous defeat and have made significant improvements in their preparation for the upcoming match.""Football is an ongoing process and now we are better than before. So expect better performance to win the game. We are confident about our players.""On retiring Chhetri, he said: ""I know him very well, a historical player for Indian football. All the best to him.""Football needs players like him. It's not for good Indian football. Maybe in future you will have more players like Chhetri.""",Igor Stimac believes India can qualify for third round of World Cup qualifiers. India face Kuwait in Kolkata on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Sunil Chhetri , the icon of the Indian football team , has shifted the spotlight from his final international match to the team's critical FIFA World Cup Qualifier against Kuwait . With a victory on Thursday, India would be on the brink of securing a berth in the third round of the qualifiers, leading towards the 2026 FIFA World Cup finals in the USA, Canada, and Mexico.Chhetri recently declared that the upcoming second-leg match against Kuwait would signal the conclusion of his remarkable 19-year international career. ""It's not about me and my last match. I don't want to dwell on it repeatedly. Our primary focus is winning this game. It won't be easy, but we're prepared. We'll have tremendous support,"" stated the 39-year-old striker ahead of the crucial fixture.Chhetri, who has already planned his immediate future post-retirement, emphasized the significance of the match. ""If we win tomorrow, we almost qualify. Five top games home and away, I am going to wear nice suits and watch the match wherever the team travels. Every day I talk to the boys about this dream. The longer camp helps because we come from different mentalities. It gives you much more time to work on details. It's not life-changing, but it helps to focus on the finer points.""When asked if he would reconsider his retirement , Chhetri firmly responded, ""No sir, suits are made and I am going to watch the boys play. I have thought about it a lot. I had a great ride all these 19 years. I will go as a fan and support the team wherever they go.""The game against Kuwait is critical, especially after India's surprising 1-2 loss to lower-ranked Afghanistan in Guwahati in March, a result that drew heavy criticism from fans and analysts. Indian team head coachIgor Stimac commented on the upcoming match, stating, ""We need to take care of these players; they don't have their best striker. We are also without Sandesh (Jhingan). They impressed me with their last performance against Qatar; they raised their game. But I'm in absolute peace with the way our preparation has gone. It's only a game of football and we should enjoy it.

NEW DELHI: Portugal defeated Finland 4-2 in a friendly match held in Lisbon on Tuesday ahead of the upcoming Euro 2024 tournament. Despite a late surge from the non-qualifying Finnish team, Portugal maintained control for the majority of the game, showcasing their attacking prowess and providing valuable experience for their evolving squad.With captain Cristiano Ronaldo rested ahead of the tournament, manager Roberto Martinez took the opportunity to experiment with his lineup, fielding a significantly altered team compared to previous outings. This tactical decision proved effective, with Portugal dominating possession and creating numerous scoring opportunities from the outset.The Portuguese dominance materialized into an early lead when defender Ruben Dias expertly headed in a corner kick in the 17th minute. Their advantage was further solidified just before halftime when Diogo Jota confidently converted a penalty earned by Francisco Conceicao , who was fouled inside the penalty area.The second half saw Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes enter the fray as part of a five-player substitution. The change injected fresh impetus into the Portuguese attack, with Fernandes making an immediate impact by curling a beautiful shot into the top corner from the edge of the box, extending the lead to 3-0.Finland, however, refused to be completely overshadowed. Substitute Teemu Pukki capitalized on a brief lapse in concentration from the Portuguese defence, netting two goals in quick succession and bringing his team back into contention.Despite the unexpected Finnish resurgence, Portugal weathered the storm and regained control of the game. Bruno Fernandes, once again proving his worth, sealed the victory with a close-range finish in the 84th minute, securing a 4-2 win for Portugal.This friendly served as a valuable exercise for Portugal, allowing them to fine-tune their tactics and provide game time for players who may feature prominently in the upcoming tournament. The match also highlighted the team's attacking depth, with Fernandes in particular demonstrating his ability to influence the game from midfield.Portugal will now face Croatia and Ireland in their final two warm-up matches before commencing their Euro 2024 campaign against the Czech Republic on June 18th. These upcoming matches will provide further opportunities for Martinez to solidify his lineup and strategy as they aim to make a significant impact in Group F, which also includes Turkey and Georgia.",Portugal defeated Finland 4-2 in a friendly match held in Lisbon on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Real Madrid have announced the signing of France forward Kylian Mbappe on a five-year contract as a free agent, bringing an end to a transfer saga that lasted for years. The move sees the European champions secure their newest "" Galactico ,"" adding a formidable talent to their squad.""Real Madrid C. F. and Kylian Mbappe have reached an agreement whereby he will be a Real Madrid player for the next five seasons,"" the Spanish champions said in a statement, fresh off their 15th European Cup triumph.The 25-year-old captain of the French national team had announced he was leaving Paris St Germain in a video posted on social media platform X on May 10.Mbappe will officially join Real Madrid in July after his PSG contract expires on June 30. However, before joining the club, he will be unveiled as a Real Madrid player, and then he will join up with the France squad for the European Championship in Germany.Mbappe joins a star-studded side in Madrid, featuring Ballon d'Or favorites Vinicius Jr. and Jude Bellingham, under the management of Italian Carlo Ancelotti, the most successful coach inChampions League history with five titles.Despite winning numerous trophies at PSG, including domestic doubles and trebles, Mbappe has yet to clinch the Champions League, the only major honor missing from his impressive resume.After seven years at PSG, during which he won six Ligue 1 titles and four French Cups, Mbappe leaves the club as their all-time top scorer with 256 goals.Mbappe surprised PSG last year when he informed them he would not take up the option of a one-year contract extension, leading to a standoff with the club before eventually being reinstated to the first-team squad.By allowing Mbappe to run down the final year of his contract, PSG was unable to recoup any of the 180 million euro ($195.95 million) transfer fee they paid in 2017 to sign him from AS Monaco.Mbappe became the second-most expensive player of all time after his former PSG teammate Neymar, who was signed for 222 million euros from Barcelona in 2017.Real Madrid had previously attempted to sign Mbappe but failed to do so, with Mbappe opting to sign a contract extension with PSG in May 2022 after Real Madrid's bid was rejected.With Mbappe finally joining their ranks, Real Madrid aims to consolidate their dominance in LaLiga , having won the title by 10 points last season with only one loss, and remaining unbeaten in the Champions League.","Kylian Mbappe joins Real Madrid on a five-year contract as a free agent.

On this surface, there are some more key moments.’Sinner added, “ It's good to struggle a little bit.”Alcaraz, 21, compared playing Sinner, to running a marathon, that analogy works particularly well on the clay.“ You have to run like it is a marathon, you know, side-to-side. He holds nothing back,” the Spanaird said. “Everything he does, he does it perfectly. The way that he hit the ball is unbelievable. The way he moves, it's really, really good. He pushes you to the limit in every ball, in every point. I think it is the hardest thing (in the sport) to face Jannik.”Alcaraz, unbelievably gifted himself, whose grunt can sometimes go over his follow through, and whose coach Juan Carlos Ferrero, appears to be locked in a talkathon with Apostolos Tsitsipas, enjoys playing Sinner.“I love these kind of matches.
