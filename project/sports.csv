Team India gears up for Champions Trophy final with practice in Dubai

'Rohit Sharma-led Team India will clinch the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 title': Astrologer Greenstone Lobo's huge prediction

New Zealand are working on aspects of their game that they feel India may look to exploit when the two teams meet in Dubai on Sunday for the ICC Champions Trophy final , and the Kiwi plans have been laid bare by a net bowler.India started using a four-pronged spin attack from the third game onwards in the group stage of the tournament. Incidentally, that match was against New Zealand, who could only score 205 in response to India's 249 and succumbed to the pressure exerted by the spinners.To prepare for that eventuality once again, the Kiwi batters are training specifically to counter spin, which was revealed to ANI by net bowler Shashwat Tiwari.According to the report, Tiwari said the New Zealanders are probably wary of the threat by Indian spinners, who played a key role in beating New Zealand in the group fixture as well as Australia in the semi-finals.Mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy took seven wickets in those two matches, including a five-for (5 for 42) against the Kiwis.""They are preparing for left-armers,"" Tiwari told ANI. ""I won't say they are struggling. Of course, our Indian team has top-class spinners, but I don't think they will be able to cope with them.""India have the old war horse Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav as their three left-arm spinners. Chakravarthy and Washington Sundar are the other two spinners in the squad.""Today, I fortunately got to bowl (in the nets),"" Tiwari said further.""At one point in time, he (name not revealed in the ANI report) asked me to bowl from 18 yards just to prepare for Ravindra Jadeja. It is because of the kind of pace he (Jadeja) has. He was expecting that kind of speed. We (net bowlers) bowled from that point, and we did it nicely. But when he realised the ball was coming too quickly, he asked me to bowl from 22 yards,"" Tiwari added.India topped Group A by winning all three matches and went on to beat Australia by four wickets in the semifinal. New Zealand, meanwhile, defeated South Africa by 50 runs in the other semifinal.",Net bowler Shashwat Tiwari says New Zealand are working on aspects of their game that they feel India may look to exploit.

Christian McCaffrey's Wife Olivia Culpo Faces Scary Fire Incident at Her Rhode Island Barn



A peaceful day at the barn quickly turned into a nightmare for Olivia Culpo, the wife of NFL star Christian McCaffrey . While visiting her family home in Rhode Island, Culpo found herself in the middle of a frightening fire incident that required the immediate intervention of the local fire department. What started as a routine visit to check on the barn and its animals soon escalated into an emergency.Culpo began her day with a visit to the barn, where she shared an update about the rescued cats her mother had taken in. She mentioned there were eight of them, although only a few were visible in the photos she posted. Curiously, the cats were seen lounging around with a large rat beside them, seemingly indifferent to its presence—an amusing deviation from the classic cat-and-mouse dynamic.Among the barn's residents, one cat stood out—George. Culpo introduced George as a ""failed barn cat"" but also as her favorite, despite his apparent habit of ""barking orders."" She went a step further in her playful commentary by declaring, ""George is the real King of the Castle,"" humorously bestowing him the royal title of ""George I, the King of Rhode Island.""However, the lighthearted moments were short-lived. Soon after, Culpo found herself in an alarming situation as a fire broke out at the barn. Initially, she shared a post with a seemingly controlled scene, where water hoses were being used to douse the flames. She captioned it, ""Truly never a dull moment on the farm!!!!!""But the severity of the situation became apparent when she later posted an image showing thick smoke engulfing the entire area. Flames had spread rapidly, and the once-calm farm was now at serious risk. Despite the alarming visuals, Culpo reassured her followers with the message, ""Everything ended up ok."" However, the images told a more dramatic story.Fortunately, the quick response of the South Kingstown fire department ensured that the fire was contained before causing further damage. In her final update, Culpo expressed her gratitude, saying, ""Thanks to the amazing fire department,"" as she shared a photo of two firetrucks parked outside the barn.Had it not been for the prompt action of the firefighters, the situation could have escalated into a devastating disaster. The incident likely brought back memories of another fire-related scare that Culpo had previously encountered in Los Angeles. This time, though, with the help of the first responders, the outcome was much less catastrophic.Also Read: ""Trump Loves Fisherman"": Jordon Hudson’s political allegiance becomes clear as Bill Belichick’s girlfriend celebrates a big win Thanks to the brave firefighters, Culpo’s barn was saved, and she could breathe a sigh of relief—though it’s safe to say that this is one farm visit she won’t forget anytime soon.","Olivia Culpo, wife of NFL star Christian McCaffrey, was visiting her family home in Rhode Island.

Off a career-best season with 32 points in 50 games, the defenseman spoke to the media following Saturday's practice regarding his excitement for the change.With a year remaining on his $10.2 million contract, Walman recognized the difficulty of adapting to a new team but is excited to help Edmonton succeed. He's excited to play with his new teammates and make an impact on offense and defense. While the change is uncertain, he sees it as an exciting new challenge.""Working on a little bit of excitement and nerve,"" Walman said. ""So be ready to go. It's exciting time.” Walman described the experience as a dream, feeling compelled to ""pinch himself,"" and was pleased to see familiar faces, including Edmonton captain Connor McDavid .""I mean, it's, I guess you can compare it to like a dream,"" Walman said. ""Kind of you walk in, you seen things for the first time. Yeah, I got to pinch myself a little bit. It's cool for me being back seeing Connor. Know a bunch of guys familiar, bunch of guys on the team, and bunch of new faces. So I'm excited to get going. And, yeah, just really excited.”Edmonton Oilers strengthened their blue line in the offseason after picking up defenseman Jake Walman from the San Jose Sharks on Friday. In return, the Sharks got a conditional first-round pick in the 2026 NHL Draft, along with young forward prospect Carl Berglund. The draft selection has conditions—the Edmonton 2026 pick within the top 12, its 2027 first-rounder can be sent instead. But if the Oilers make that 2027 choice prior to the 2026 NHL trading deadline, then the initial 2026 choice will instead go to the Sharks.Also Read: “Disguising Don Sweeney”: Bruins fans thrashed the team's GM for trading their captain, Brad Marchand Walman, who was once a third-round selection of the St. Louis Blues in the 2014 NHL Draft, has constructed a respectable NHL career.

Even with all the time he has spent in the league, his playoff experience only consists of a single Stanley Cup playoff game.

NEW DELHI: India are set to face New Zealand in a bid to win the Champions Trophy after a 12-year hiatus, confronting their historical difficulty in overcoming the resilient Kiwis in ICC tournaments, where New Zealand leads with a 10-6 record and a 3-1 advantage in knockout matches.Despite criticisms regarding India's extended preparation time in Dubai, such arguments are diminished as New Zealand is also well-acquainted with the conditions. India's strategy likely involves leveraging their spin quartet, which has proven effective on the Dubai International Cricket Stadium pitch, against New Zealand's batting lineup.Spinners Varun Chakravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, and Axar Patel have been key in India's bowling success, potentially challenging New Zealand's top batters, including Kane Williamson and Rachin Ravindra.New Zealand's spinners, however, have previously succeeded against India and aim to replicate that performance. The match also carries emotional weight for India, with veterans Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma potentially playing in one of their final ICC tournaments.Kohli's recent form includes a century and two fifties, while Sharma aims to contribute more significantly. India hopes for impactful performances from the rest of the team, including vice-captain Shubman Gill, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, and Hardik Pandya, to secure a collective victory.This final presents an opportunity for both teams to claim the ICC ODI title, with India looking to add to their trophy cabinet and New Zealand seeking their first since 2000.The match will be live-streamed on JioHotstar and broadcast on Star Sports Network.The match is scheduled to begin at 2:30 pm IST, while the toss will take place at 2 pm on March 9, Sunday.Rohit Sharma(c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul(w), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Washington Sundar, Arshdeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Rishabh PantWill Young, Rachin Ravindra, Kane Williamson, Daryl Mitchell, Tom Latham(w), Glenn Phillips, Michael Bracewell, Mitchell Santner(c), Matt Henry, Kyle Jamieson, William ORourke, Nathan Smith, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway, Jacob Duffy","India face New Zealand in the Champions Trophy final on Sunday.

Both teams have taken contrasting routes to the summit clash, but history suggests that this could be yet another classic Indo-Kiwi encounter.India, led by Rohit Sharma , have dominated throughout the tournament, relying on their balanced attack, which features a four-pronged spin force and a dependable top order. They breezed past Pakistan, Bangladesh and New Zealand in the group stage before overcoming Australia in the semi-finals.New Zealand, always punching above their weight in ICC tournaments, have had to fight through a more challenging road. They lost to India in their final group game, after victories against Pakistan and Bangladesh booked them a spot in the semis. They then defeated South Africa in the semi-finals. New Zealand will be confident in their ability to break India’s dream of reclaiming the Champions Trophy after 12 years.New Zealand have been a thorn in India’s side in ICC knockout matches. They lead the head-to-head record 3-1 in ICC knockouts, including wins in the 2019 ODI World Cup semi-final and the 2021 World Test Championship final. Despite India’s recent group-stage win over New Zealand by 44 runs, history suggests that the Kiwis thrive under high-pressure situations.For India, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma remain key figures, but the team will also look towards Shubman Gill, Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul to shoulder the batting responsibility. New Zealand, on the other hand, will bank on their all-round strength, with Rachin Ravindra and Kane Williamson pivotal in their semifinal triumph against South Africa.India's spin attack — featuring Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Varun Chakravarthy — has been their trump card throughout the tournament. However, New Zealand boasts an equally potent spin quartet of Mitchell Santner, Michael Bracewell, Rachin Ravindra and Glenn Phillips, making the battle of spin the defining factor in this final.The Dubai International Stadium has provided low-scoring thrillers throughout the tournament, and the final will be played on the same surface that hosted India’s clash against Pakistan in the group stage. The Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) has ensured a two-week rest period for all wickets, but the pitch is expected to be slow and gripping, favouring spinners.India’s spin quartet could have the edge in these conditions, but New Zealand’s slower bowlers will also be a major threat. Expect a low-to-mid-scoring contest, with 270-280 being a competitive total.","Champions Trophy 2025 final will see India and New Zealand lock horns at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday, March 9.

The Los Angeles Lakers are making strategic moves as they gear up for the playoffs, with reports indicating that Jordan Goodwin ’s two-way contract will soon be converted into a standard NBA deal. This decision comes as the team continues its impressive run, winning seven straight games and 18 of their last 21. To make room for Goodwin, the Lakers are likely to waive either Cam Reddish or Alex Len, with Reddish being the more probable candidate.Jordan Goodwin, a 26-year-old guard, has quickly become a valuable asset for the Los Angeles Lakers since joining the team in early February. Over eight games, he has averaged 6.1 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 1.0 assist in 16.9 minutes per game. Goodwin's achievements have not gone unnoticed, even though a recent ailment to his right ankle has slowed his progress. He has received numerous compliments from head coach JJ Redick, who has referred to him as a vital rotation player.Jovan Buha of The Athletic reports that in order to optimize financial flexibility, the Los Angeles Lakers are anticipated to convert Goodwin's deal as late as feasible. ""I do expect him to be converted at the end of the season as late as possible, and then be on the playoff roster. ... He's kind of become the 9th man, and you could argue that depending on the night and depending on the matchup, he should be like the 8th man,"" Buha said on his podcast . He also hinted at a potential multi-year deal for Goodwin in the future, stating, ""I think he's going to get a multi-year contract, longer-term later in the season.""Jordan Goodwin’s journey to the Lakers began after they waived Armel Traore to open a roster spot. A four-year NBA veteran, he has previously played for Washington, Phoenix, and Memphis, holding career averages of 6.4 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 2.6 assists across 128 games.

LeBron James snubbed by Ric Bucher’s Los Angeles Lakers greatness criteria



'LeBron isn’t an all-time Lakers great!’: Ric Bucher sparks heated debate | SPEAK

Do Ric Bucher’s standards exclude Los Angeles Lakers icons like Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, and Wilt Chamberlain from all-time great status?

On Tuesday, Fox Sports analyst Ric Bucher sparked debate on the latest episode of SPEAK by claiming that LeBron James does not qualify as an all-time Lakers great. Bucher argued that to earn that distinction, a player must spend at least 10 years with the franchise and win a minimum of three championships. Bucher’s comments immediately sparked backlash, with O'Shea Jackson Jr. , son of rapper Ice Cube , leading the charge. Taking to X, he passionately challenged Bucher’s criteria, questioning its fairness and historical accuracy.O'Shea Jackson Jr. didn’t hold back in his criticism of Bucher’s criteria, taking to X on Thursday to highlight how many Lakers legends wouldn’t meet those same standards. ""Someone tell Jerry West’s family. Wilt Chamberlain ’s family. Gail Goodrich. Pau Gasol. Elgin Baylor’s family. Bob McAdoo and Jamaal Wilkes that Ric Bucher says they aren’t Laker greats,"" he wrote. His post struck a chord with fans who believe that greatness isn’t just about longevity and championships but about impact, legacy, and contributions to the franchise.Since joining the Lakers in 2018, LeBron James has been a game-changer for the franchise, guiding them to an NBA Championship in the 2019-20 season—their first in a decade. Year after year, he has put up stellar numbers, averaging 26.8 points, 8.1 assists, 8.0 rebounds, and 1.1 steals per game while shooting an impressive 51.4% from the field. Despite these accomplishments, Bucher insists that James doesn’t qualify as a true Lakers great due to his tenure and championship count.However, many fans and analysts strongly disagree, noting that some of the most legendary players in Lakers history also fail to meet Bucher’s strict criteria. This has led to widespread debate over what truly defines greatness within one of the NBA’s most storied franchises.If Bucher's definition of a Lakers great were applied across history, some of the most celebrated figures in the franchise’s past would not qualify. Jerry West , despite being the inspiration behind the NBA logo and spending 14 seasons with the Lakers, only won one championship—falling short of Bucher’s three-title benchmark. Similarly, Elgin Baylor , a 10-time All-NBA forward, was a dominant scorer but never secured a championship ring.Gail Goodrich, another Lakers Hall of Famer, played nine seasons in Los Angeles and contributed to the 1972 championship but also fails to meet Bucher’s 10-year standard. Even Wilt Chamberlain , a towering presence in Lakers history, played only five seasons with the team and won just one title, making him ineligible under Bucher’s rules.Also Read: LeBron James scales the historic peak of 50,000 points in NBA Ric Bucher’s criteria for defining a Lakers great has sparked heated debate, as it leaves out some of the biggest names in franchise history. While championships and longevity matter, many believe that impact, leadership, and overall contributions to the Lakers’ legacy are just as crucial. LeBron James has already proven himself as one of basketball’s greatest, and whether he fits Bucher’s definition or not, his mark on the Lakers is undeniable.This debate also underscores the changing expectations of modern athletes. With players like LeBron James, who consistently break records and adapt their game, the traditional criteria for greatness may no longer suffice. The new era of basketball emphasizes a player’s ability to impact the game across multiple dimensions, not just through championships and tenure. The debate over what defines greatness will always spark discussion.","Fox Sports analyst Ric Bucher claimed that LeBron James does not qualify as an all-time Lakers great.

""His three-point shooting addresses a key need, and his ability to play multiple positions offers flexibility. If he improves defensively and becomes more consistent on offense, he could become a solid contributor for a championship contender.""

""With the Toronto Raptors envisioning a frontcourt of Scottie Barnes and newly extended Brandon Ingram along with former lottery pick Gradey Dick at shooting guard, where does that leave current leading scorer RJ Barrett’s future?""

""Based on conversations before the deadline, RJ Barrett could be a trade candidate to monitor this summer.""

The Los Angeles Lakers are reportedly considering a bold move this summer to bolster their roster, potentially trading rookie forward Dalton Knecht to acquire former New York Knicks star RJ Barrett from the Toronto Raptors . This comes as the Lakers continue to ride the wave of success following their acquisition of Luka Doncic , who has been instrumental in their recent seven-game winning streak, propelling them to a 39-21 record and the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference. Luka Doncic ’s partnership with LeBron James has been a game-changer for the Los Angeles Lakers , driving their offense to a No. 12 ranking with a 117.3 offensive rating over the last seven games. However, their defensive performance has been equally impressive, boasting a league-leading 106.2 defensive rating during the same stretch. This resurgence has sparked speculation that the Lakers might be willing to part ways with Knecht to secure a proven talent like RJ Barrett.Heavy Sports' David Grubb noted.The Los Angeles Lakers previously attempted to trade Knecht during the deadline in a deal for Charlotte Hornets center Mark Williams, which ultimately fell through. This time, they could package Knecht, along with Gabe Vincent and Jarred Vanderbilt’s salaries, and draft capital to pursue RJ Barrett. The Raptors, who are reportedly open to moving Barrett, might find this offer appealing as they look to reshape their roster around Scottie Barnes and Brandon Ingram.HoopsHype’s Michael Scotto questioned.Barrett, who was traded to Toronto from the Knicks during the 2023-24 season, has been a consistent performer, averaging 21.7 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 5.7 assists in 49 games this season. His versatility and scoring ability make him an attractive target for the Los Angeles Lakers, who could see him as a perfect fit alongside Luka Doncic and James.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angele Lakers might reunite with $3 million shooting guard before playoffs to support LeBron James and Luka Doncic As the offseason approaches, the Lakers’ pursuit of RJ Barrett could signal their commitment to building a championship-caliber team for the 2025-26 season.

When and where to watch the Charlotte Hornets play tonight against the Brooklyn Nets (March 8, 2025)?

The Charlotte Hornets are set to host the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday, March 8, at the Spectrum Center, but all eyes are on the Hornets’ injury report, particularly the status of star guard LaMelo Ball. Ball, the team’s leading scorer averaging 25.8 points per game, has been a bright spot in an otherwise challenging season for the Hornets, who hold a 14-48 record. However, his recent performances have raised concerns about his health and availability moving forward. LaMelo Ball will be playing tonight against the Brooklyn Nets. He is not listed in the team’s injury report and is in the projected starters. In the last 20 games, Ball’s numbers have been decent, with averages of just 22.3 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists.The Hornets are already dealing with a lengthy injury list. Grant Williams (ACL), Tre Mann (back), and Brandon Miller (wrist) are all out for the season, while Josh Okogie (hamstring) remains sidelined. Mark Williams (foot) is listed as day-to-day, leaving the team thin in key areas. Ball’s potential health concerns could further complicate matters for a team already battling to stay competitive.On the other side, the Nets come into the game with their own injury woes. De’Anthony Melton (ACL) and Cameron Johnson (knee) are out, while Noah Clowney (ankle) is day-to-day. Despite their 21-41 record, the Nets have shown flashes of resilience, led by Nic Claxton and Keon Johnson, who have been consistent contributors.The Hornets’ struggles extend beyond injuries. They rank 28th in the league in scoring (105.4 points per game) and 14th in points allowed (113.1 per game). Their -483 scoring differential highlights the uphill battle they face nightly. Miles Bridges has been a standout, averaging 23.8 points and 8.5 rebounds in the last 20 games, but the team’s success heavily relies on Ball’s ability to perform at his usual elite level.As the Hornets prepare to face the Nets, fans and analysts alike will be watching Ball closely. His health and performance could determine not only the outcome of this game but also the trajectory of the Hornets’ season.

His ability to dominate on both ends of the floor has been instrumental in Boston’s success, as they currently rank fifth in the league in scoring (117.0 points per game) and third in defense (108.3 points allowed per game).While Jayson Tatum appears to be in good health, the Celtics are dealing with other key injuries. Jrue Holiday (hand), Sam Hauser (ankle), and Kristaps Porzingis (illness) are all listed as questionable for the marquee matchup. Their potential absences could put additional pressure on Tatum and Jaylen Brown to carry the offensive load against a Lakers team that boasts its own star power.On the Lakers’ side, LeBron James (foot) and Luka Doncic (knee) are both listed as probable, though Doncic’s status is particularly noteworthy. The Slovenian guard, now with the Lakers, has been a dynamic addition to the roster, averaging 11.9 points, 4.1 rebounds, and 4.1 assists in his last 20 games. His presence on the court could create a thrilling duel with Tatum, provided both stars are healthy.The Boston Celtics-Lakers rivalry is one of the most storied in NBA history, and this matchup promises to deliver another chapter of intensity. With Tatum’s status looking favorable, Boston will rely heavily on his scoring and leadership to secure a crucial win. However, the team’s depth will be tested if Holiday, Hauser, or Porzingis are unable to suit up.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers vs Boston Celtics game prediction, betting odds, best pick, spread, and more (March 8, 2025) Fans can catch the action live on ABC and ESPN+ or stream the game on Fubo.

Despite not being an active player in the locker room, Hyde helped establish a foundation for the team, which he believes will eventually become a Super Bowl team in the coming years.

Bill Simmons Opens Up on Why Tom Brady’s Raiders Ownership Could Spell Trouble



Bleakest NFL Teams, QB Draft Drama, and Sunny Washington Times | The Bill Simmons Podcast

Amid the process of NFL picking, the Los Angeles Raiders are making preparations to be in an important place: Green Bay and steer the ship by none other than Tom Brady. This ""seven-time"" world-beater will be the major factor in securing a good franchise quarterback to the club. An enthusiast for Brady like Bill Simmons gets excited by all this, but even he is concerned about Brady's role in the franchise.The Las Vegas Raiders' decision to bring Tom Brady on board as a minority owner has sparked immense excitement among fans. The move, approved by the league in October 2024, not only connects the franchise to a seven-time Super Bowl champion but also fuels speculation about Brady’s potential influence in shaping the team’s future—especially when it comes to finding their next franchise quarterback. However, while many are thrilled about his involvement, not everyone is convinced that Brady’s greatness on the field will translate to success in the front office.Media personality and longtime New England Patriots fan Bill Simmons has raised concerns about Brady’s ability to evaluate quarterbacks. As reported by Awful Announcing, Simmons addressed the topic on The Bill Simmons Podcast, pointing out that legendary players don’t always make great decision-makers.“This is a dangerous thing where you have him running a football team thinking he knows what’s best with quarterbacks because he was a great quarterback,” Simmons remarked. He further emphasized that history has shown how former elite players often struggle in management roles. “Because all of the evidence with the great players we’ve had, name the sport, mostly they’re not good at this. They think they’re seeing things that other people don’t see, and it’s not actually rational.”Simmons’ concerns stem from a common issue in professional sports: the assumption that elite players naturally excel at talent evaluation. Many former greats have struggled when transitioning to front-office roles, with John Elway’s tenure as the Denver Broncos’ general manager serving as a prime example.One of the biggest questions surrounding Brady’s involvement with the Raiders is how much influence he will have on their quarterback selection in the 2025 NFL Draft. With Las Vegas potentially looking for a long-term solution at the position, having Brady’s input might seem like a huge advantage. However, Simmons argues that his presence in the decision-making room could create complications.“I’m just saying it’s not a slam dunk. Part of the problem is if you and I are in that room with Tom Brady and we were like, ‘yo man, we think Darnold, look…’ and he’s like, ‘I’m out. I watched that game and he doesn’t have it, I’m out,’” Simmons said. “Are we gonna argue with Tom Brady? It’s just now — it’s this one voice that sees what he wants to see.”This raises a critical point: Will Brady’s opinions be too influential, even if they aren’t always correct? His unmatched playing experience could give him valuable insight, but it also comes with the risk of bias—seeing the game through the lens of his own greatness rather than an objective evaluator.Brady’s presence in the Raiders’ ownership group guarantees that all eyes will be on the team’s quarterback decisions moving forward. His involvement could be a game-changer if he successfully helps the franchise land its next star signal-caller. But as Simmons pointed out, history suggests that not all legendary players thrive in this kind of role.Also Read: Kelly Stafford might have accidentally revealed Matthew Stafford’s remaining years in the NFL While some may take pleasure in seeing if Brady struggles in his new position, the NFL will ultimately determine whether his transition from the field to the front office is a success. Whether his impact leads to triumph or proves to be a cautionary tale remains to be seen, but one thing is certain—his influence on the Raiders is just beginning.",The Las Vegas Raiders' decision to bring Tom Brady on board as a minority owner has sparked immense excitement among fans.

McDonald's Canada has named Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid ' Canadian of the Month ' for his heroics at the 4 Nations Face-Off .

The fast food chain chose to honor McDavid's contributions rather than naming him employee of the month.Edmonton Oilers star Connor McDavid continues to reap the accolades for his game-winning play at the 4 Nations Face-Off, with McDonald's Canada getting into the act in a special fashion. The burger chain went further than the norm in offering appreciation and made a special announcement Thursday on social media, touting McDavid's heroics in international competition.The Team Canada phenom came through in the tournament's ultimate moment, hitting the championship goal just more than eight minutes into overtime to secure a dramatic 3-2 win over Team USA in Boston last month. His game-deciding goal not only entrenched Canada at the top of the tournament but reaffirmed his standing as one of the sport's all-time best."".Instead of merely saluting McDavid as an exceptional athlete, McDonald's Canada went the extra mile by jokingly declaring him ""Canadian of the Month"" rather than the usual ""Employee of the Month."" The act was a tongue-in-cheek but apt tribute to a player who keeps his nation proud with his lightning-fast displays on the ice.“Employee of the month? Nah. @cmcdavid97 is Canadian of the month,"" McDonald's wrote on Twitter. McDonald's Canada fulfilled its promise to rename a location in Edmonton if McDavid brought a Stanley Cup , following his game-winning goal against the USA in February.The tribute to McDavid included new signage, promotional deals like $0.97 fries, and the ""Big Mac-David"" burger.

Inter Milan extended their lead over Napoli at top of Serie A to four points after they were made to work hard at home by Monza before winning 3-2 on Saturday.Despite being heavily favoured against last-placed Monza with only 14 points this season, Inte found themselves trailing by two goals in the opening half.Marko Arnautovic scored just before half-time to narrow the gap, and while Inter dominated possession afterwards, they didn't level the score until the 64th minute, when Hakan Calhanoglu made it even.The winning goal came in the 77th minute when Lautaro Martinez's header took a slight deflection off Monza's Greek defender Giorgos Kyriakopoulos before finding the net.Despite their struggles, Inter's victory increased pressure on Napoli, who have managed just one point from their previous five matches ahead of their clash with seventh-ranked Fiorentina.Meanwhile, AC Milan faced a challenging away match against struggling Lecce, mirroring a similar situation to their city rivals.

Max Verstappen Calls Out Drive to Survive for Misrepresenting His Emotions After Miami GP



Formula 1: Drive to Survive - Season 7 | First Look | Netflix

Max Verstappen has once again taken issue with Drive to Survive , the Netflix docuseries that has played a significant role in expanding Formula 1 ’s global appeal. During a recent Twitch stream, the four-time world champion addressed the way the show depicted his reaction to the 2024 Miami Grand Prix , claiming it falsely portrayed him as being ""upset"" after the race.The Miami GP turned out to be a historic moment for McLaren’s Lando Norris, who secured his maiden Grand Prix victory at the Miami Dolphins Stadium. A well-timed safety car allowed the British driver to execute a perfect pit stop, keeping him ahead of Verstappen. Meanwhile, the Dutchman found himself struggling with the handling of his RB20 on the circuit’s tight corners. His frustrations were evident over the team radio: “I can’t get the car to turn, it’s a disaster.” However, despite his difficulties, Verstappen remained composed post-race, finishing second, 7.6 seconds behind Norris.Norris, elated with his first win, soaked in the moment. “I might have more than just a scratch on my nose tomorrow!” he joked, referring to an infamous moment highlighted in Drive to Survive Season 7 . “I don’t care. But I’ll enjoy my time, this only happens once when you’re taking your first win, it’s nice to do it here in Miami. I was kind of hoping it was going to be at Silverstone, but I’ll try to do it there as well. So tonight is going to be a good night.”Despite the celebratory atmosphere, Drive to Survive took a different approach in its narrative. Known for amplifying drama for entertainment value, the show crafted a storyline where Verstappen appeared dejected after failing to overtake Norris. However, Verstappen was quick to dismiss this version of events. “Apparently I was very upset after Miami,” he said, laughing. “I literally had the best time ever Sunday night, so I don't know what I was upset about.”Verstappen has been vocal about his concerns with the docuseries in the past. While acknowledging its importance for Formula 1’s popularity, he has criticized its tendency to manipulate footage and storylines. “Of course, I understand when you create a show, there needs to be drama, it needs to be exciting. But I'm a guy who finds it also very important that you're portrayed well, and that they do not start to copy comments on the different kinds of footage while it didn't happen like that,” he stated in 2023.Also Read: ""I think McLaren is the favourite"": Four-time world champion Max Verstappen does not think Red Bull can win Australian GP While Drive to Survive has revolutionized F1’s reach, drawing in new audiences, Verstappen’s comments highlight the ongoing debate about authenticity versus entertainment.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

A plea for mercy—too late

A return to the old ways

Brad Sigmon sat strapped to a metal chair, his hands bound, a thick black hood covering his face. The room was silent, save for the steady hum of the prison lights. Across from him, three anonymous marksmen stood behind a curtain, their rifles loaded, their sights fixed on the red bullseye stitched to his chest. There was no warning. No countdown. Just the sudden, deafening crack of gunfire. The target disappeared in blood.The 64-year-old convicted murderer jolted violently as the bullets tore through him. Blood bloomed instantly where the target had been, a jagged wound the size of a fist opening on his torso. His chest heaved two, maybe three times. Then—nothing.This was the first execution by firing squad in South Carolina’s history and only the fourth in the US since 1960—and one that left seasoned Associated Press reporter Jeffrey Collins shaken. The state revived the brutal practice as part of its aggressive push to resume capital punishment after a 13-year hiatus, forcing condemned inmates to choose between electrocution, lethal injection, or the firing squad. Sigmon, convicted of the 2001 bludgeoning murders of David and Gladys Larke, had picked bullets over electricity—fearing that the state’s untested lethal injection drugs could lead to a slow, agonizing death.Collins, who has covered executions for more than two decades, was among those who watched the death. He had seen men die by electrocution. He had watched the slow, clinical drift into death by lethal injection. But this—this was something else.“You think you can prepare yourself,” he wrote later, “but it’s impossible to know what to expect when you’ve never seen someone shot at close range, right in front of you.”Collins had spent days reading about firing squads, studying the damage that bullets do to a human body. He had pored over autopsy reports from Utah’s last execution by gunfire in 2010, trying to brace himself. But nothing could compare to the raw violence of the moment itself.“My heart started pounding as Sigmon’s lawyer read his final statement,” Collins wrote. “Then the hood came down. A prison employee yanked open the black shade shielding the shooters. And two minutes later, it was over.”Sigmon’s last words were not of protest, nor of defiance. Instead, they were a plea—one not for himself, but for an end to the system that was about to kill him.“I want my closing statement to be one of love,” he wrote in a message shared by his attorneys. “An eye for an eye was used as justification to the jury for seeking the death penalty. At that time, I was too ignorant to know how wrong that was.”His legal team had fought to stop the execution, arguing that forcing inmates to choose their own method of death was “barbaric.” They had demanded more transparency about the drugs used for lethal injections, fearing that botched executions could leave prisoners writhing in agony. The courts disagreed.Sigmon had no more appeals left. No more time. Only the red target on his chest, waiting.The revival of South Carolina’s death penalty has ignited a national debate over capital punishment. After years of delays due to the state’s inability to obtain lethal injection drugs, lawmakers passed a bill in 2021 that made the electric chair the default method of execution but also gave inmates the option to choose the firing squad.Sigmon was the second man executed under the new law in just six months. The first, James Terry, had chosen the electric chair in December—a method many argue is even more brutal than the firing squad.But even as the state pushes forward with executions, activists continue to fight. “We are sliding backward into an era of barbarism,” said one human rights advocate after Sigmon’s death. “The world is watching.”For those who witnessed Friday’s execution, the debate is no longer theoretical. It is real. It is visceral. And it is something they will never forget.“I won’t forget the crack of the rifles,” Collins wrote. “Or the way Sigmon mouthed something to his lawyer—trying to let him know he was okay—just before the hood came down.”","Brad Sigmon, 64, was executed by firing squad in South Carolina on Friday.

The Steelers are considering Russell Wilson

Russell Wilson , who had been a promising prospect in Pittsburgh, is set to enter free agency next week. Despite a five-game losing streak, Wilson's performance in his first seven starts was impressive, with 16 touchdowns, five interceptions, and a 95.6 passer rating. The Steelers are considering retaining Wilson or Justin Fields , who went 4-2 for them and will also be a free agent.The Pittsburgh Steelers are determining their starting quarterback, while Russell Wilson and Justin Fields are being considered by other NFL teams.

The New York Jets are interested in Wilson, while the Seattle Seahawks are targeting Fields, a Super Bowl champion and 36-year-old veteran.Pittsburgh quarterback Brett Wilson has expressed his desire to stay with the team, but reports suggest the Black & Gold organization may offer an extension to quarterback Josh Fields before free agency. However, Wilson is said to refuse the offer and will be free to play for the Jets or another team. Russ, along with teammate Fields, will become an unrestricted free agent next week, raising interest from other teams in the NFL, with rumors suggesting he may be interested in an NFC East franchise.Other than the Steelers, the New York Giants are reportedly interested in signing quarterback Wilson during free agency, alongside the Steelers, according to NFL insider Jordan Schultz.

With the Seahawks, Wilson was named to the Pro Bowl nine times and helped Seattle win their first Super Bowl championship in Super Bowl XLVIII. He is regarded as one of the greatest dual-threat quarterbacks of all time.Also Read: “This is my mating call "": Russell Wilson can’t get enough of Ciara’s Carnival look, joking about another baby on the way The Steelers are assessing options for their new quarterback, with both Wilson and Fields potentially receiving offers from the Pittsburgh franchise.

Mohun Bagan Super Giant seal it in style,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/mohun-bagan-super-giant-seal-it-in-style/articleshow/118813445.cms,"Molina's team lifts ISL shield with 2-0 win over

and records galore

KOLKATA: It was an evening Mohun Bagan Super Giant made their own with a sense of inevitability. A record run at home, record points tally and winning the biggest prize in Indian club football in back-to-back seasons - Jose Molina 's brigade brought quite something to the party on Saturday.They celebrated their Indian Super League Shield-winning show in grand style, defeating second-placed FC Goa 2-0 at the Salt Lake Stadium here and finishing their group stage with a slice of revenge against the visitors.FC Goa - supervised by India head coach Manuel Manolo - came into the match as the only other team after Bengaluru FC to have been able to conquer Molina's brigade this season. But they lost the plot in the reverse fixture, conceding two goals born out of individual blunders.On the first occasion, Boris Singh much to everyone's horror saw his back-pass with a header off an ambitious but misdirected long ball from Bagan defender Tom Aldred roll into an empty net with the Goa goalkeeper Hrithik Tiwari also leaving his place with the intention of claiming it in the 63rd minute.As if that dreadful defensive miscommunication was not enough, Bagan became the beneficiary of another clanger deep into the stoppage time. This time, India's defensive mainstay Sandesh Jhingan messed up big time in controlling the ball under pressure from Jason Cummings and Greg Stewart pounced on it to beat the goalkeeper with consummate ease.Mohun Bagan finished the league stage with the highest number of points (56), record number of wins in a ISL season (17) and an unbeaten run at home (11 wins and one draw). Goa's late chase for the Shield fell eight-point short.Long before the kick-off, thousands of Bagan fans made it an occasion to remember. They unfurled tifos highlighting the team's legacy and supremacy; they carried out Mexican waves and turned on the flashlight on their mobile phones to set light to the team's ambitions.Despite having clinched the Shield with two games to spare, Molina opted for a strong side giving only goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh his first game. It's, however, Goa who scored in all their matches in the group stage before Saturday and came close to scoring early on, Iker Guarrotxena missing the target by a whisker while Udanta Singh seeing his goal-bound attempt blocked by Aldred.However, the highlight of the first half came in the injury time when Manvir Singh did find the back of the net but Goa vehemently protested and referee Rahul Kumar Gupta eventually disallowed it after consultation with fourth official Harish Kundu, judging that Dimitri Petratos had touched the ball with his hand in the build-up of the move.Goa got a reprieve. But then came two individual mistakes, leading to their downfall in an uncharacteristic way.Bagan were already into the party mood. They brought the house down with another win; they rang the curtain down on the league stage by breaking new ground.",Mohun Bagan beat FC Goa 2-0 to win Indian Super League Shield.

Elon Musk's Grok: India is a strong favorite

As of today, March 9, 2025, the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 final is set to take place later today in Dubai between India and New Zealand. Predicting the winner involves looking at current form, key players, and tournament progress so far, but no definitive outcome can be stated until the match concludes.

India has been a dominant force in the tournament, reaching the final after defeating Australia in the first semi-final on March 4 in Dubai. Their batting lineup, featuring stars like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, has been in top form, while their bowling attack, led by Mohammed Shami and supported by spinners like Kuldeep Yadav, has been highly effective. India’s consistent performance in ICC events and their unbeaten streak in Dubai during this tournament make them strong favorites according to many experts and betting odds prior to the knockout stages.

New Zealand, on the other hand, secured their spot in the final with a clinical victory over South Africa in the second semi-final on March 5 in Lahore. Known for their tactical approach and resilience, the Kiwis have relied on players like Kane Williamson and Matt Henry, the latter leading the wicket charts with 10 scalps. Their ability to perform under pressure in knockout matches adds to their credibility as contenders, though they face a formidable challenge against India’s depth.

Given the information available:

India’s form, depth, and historical success in the Champions Trophy (winners in 2013 and joint winners in 2002) tilt predictions in their favor.

New Zealand’s consistency in reaching ICC finals and their balanced squad make them a serious threat, but they are often seen as underdogs against powerhouses like India.

While I can’t predict the future with certainty, based on current tournament dynamics and expert sentiment, India appears to have the edge heading into the final. However, cricket is unpredictable, and New Zealand’s knack for upsets could turn the tide. The result will be clear by the end of March 9, 2025—check back after the match for the confirmed winner!

Champions Trophy final: Clinical India wary of old bugbear New Zealand amid talk of captain Rohit Sharma's ODI farewell,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-champions-trophy-2025/champions-trophy-final-clinical-india-wary-of-old-bugbear-new-zealand-amid-talk-of-captain-rohit-sharmas-odi-farewell/articleshow/118813117.cms,"Team India gears up for Champions Trophy final with practice in Dubai

Team India, currently in scintillating form, will look to clinch their third ICC Champions Trophy title when they face a determined New Zealand in the final at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday.India's previous triumphs came in 2002 and 2013, and this final offers them a chance to settle some old scores against the spunky Kiwis.The clash for the 'mini-World Cup' pits two of the most consistent yet underachieving teams in ICC events against each other. Both sides will be desperate for glory after enduring heartbreaking losses in recent ODI finals - India in the 2017 Champions Trophy and the 2023 World Cup, and New Zealand in the 2015 and 2019 World Cups.This time, India's campaign has also been slightly marred by accusations of ""unfair advantage"" due to all their matches being scheduled at a single venue.A key point of interest will be whether India captain Rohit Sharma uses this stage to bid farewell to his international career, or at least his ODI career, following the example of Australia captain Steve Smith and former Bangladesh skipper Mushfiqur Rahim, who recently retired after their teams' exits.Similarly, New Zealand's Kane Williamson, who has been in fine form with 189 runs in four matches at 47.25, including a century in the semifinal, may also see this as an opportunity to bow out of ODIs in style.Rohit, 37, has been instrumental in setting the tone for India, despite not producing a big individual score. His cameos of 41, 20, 15, and 28 in India's four consecutive wins have earned praise from head coach Gautam Gambhir. ""If your captain bats with such intent, it sends a strong message to the dressing room about being fearless and courageous. We evaluate impact, not just runs,"" Gambhir said.The final also offers Rohit and Virat Kohli , who has found form with an unbeaten century against Pakistan and a crucial 84 against Australia in the semifinal, a chance to relive the glory of India's T20 World Cup triumph in the West Indies last year.For India, this match presents an opportunity to avenge a defeat New Zealand inflicted on them nearly 25 years ago. On Oct 15, 2000, Chris Cairns' century guided New Zealand to a four-wicket victory over Sourav Ganguly's India in the Champions Trophy final in Nairobi, securing their maiden title. In recent years, New Zealand have emerged as India's bogey team in ICC events.The Black Caps defeated India in the 2019 World Cup semifinal and the 2021 World Test Championship final. However, India broke the jinx with a 70-run victory in a high-scoring semifinal in Mumbai earlier in this tournament, thanks to centuries from Kohli and Shreyas Iyer , and a seven-wicket haul by Mohammed Shami India's journey to the final has been marked by dominant performances, including a clinical win over Australia in the semifinal and victories in all three group matches against Bangladesh, Pakistan, and New Zealand.Bouncing back from an ordinary Test tour of Australia, vice-captain Shubman Gill has batted like a dream, scoring 157 runs in four matches at 52.33, while Kohli, Iyer and KL Rahul have given the Indian middle order the look of a well-oiled machine, with Hardik Pandya providing the perfect finishing touches.India's decision to field a four-pronged spin attack in their last two matches has paid off handsomely. Axar Patel, Ravindra Jadeja Kuldeep Yadav , and Varun Chakravarthy have been instrumental, with Chakravarthy's five-wicket haul against New Zealand in the group stage proving decisive.","Team India face New Zealand in the ICC Champions Trophy final on Sunday. India have won the tournament twice before, in 2002 and 2013. New Zealand defeated India in the 2000 final in Nairobi, their first ever ODI title. Both sides have endured heartbreaking defeats in recent ICC finals.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118813100,imgsize-49840,width-400,resizemode-4/118813100.jpg"

'Rohit Sharma-led Team India will clinch the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 title': Astrologer Greenstone Lobo's huge prediction

Gautam Gambhir hits out at critics after India beat Australia to reach Champions Trophy final

In their two meetings in the final of an International Cricket Council (ICC) tournament, New Zealand got the better of India; but the current brand of white-ball cricket India have been playing under Rohit Sharma's captaincy is at a different level. However, former India opener Aakash Chopra warns that the ""process-driven"" Kiwis always manage to present a stiff challenge, which could happen in the Champions Trophy final as well on Sunday in Dubai .In 2000 and 2021, New Zealand defeated India in the finals of the Champions Trophy (then known as ICC KnockOut) and World Test Championship, respectively. With that track record, the Kiwis will fancy their chances of a hat-trick; but the Indian team will be keen to win the fourth ICC title for their stalwarts Rohit and Virat Kohli.""Rohit and Kohli are vying for their fourth ICC title. I am trying to remind myself that we don't know when the next time (India in an ICC tournament final) will come,"" said Chopra on a Star Sports show.Many believe that the final could be the swansong for the two icons, after the duo announced their retirement from T20Is following the T20 World Cup triumph last year. But there've been no such feelers from the Indian camp.Chopra said India's prowess shows in their recent record in ICC tournaments.""This is the third (ICC tournament final) for India in two years after 2023 (ODI World Cup), 2024 (T20 World Cup) and now 2025 (Champions Trophy). So India have played three finals in the last 18 months,"" Chopra recalled.Besides, India also qualified for the final in the first two editions of the World Test Championship and missed out on another final narrowly in the 2023-25 cycle of the red-ball tournament.The former batter added that India have every reason to be wary of the threat Kiwis pose.""The opponents India face are very process-driven (in) how they tackle problems posed to them...They have their roles well defined. It may not appear as a battle of equals against India's pedigree and experience, but New Zealand always punch above their weight,"" he concluded.",India face New Zealand in the Champions Trophy final in Dubai on Sunday. The Kiwis have beaten India in two previous finals of an ICC tournament. Aakash Chopra warns that the Kiwis always present a stiff challenge. India are vying for their fourth ICC title.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118812768,imgsize-47824,width-400,resizemode-4/118812768.jpg"
