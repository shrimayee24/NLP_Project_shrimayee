'Realised what I had done when I found TV channels reporting Fauja Singh's death'

JALANDHAR: The driver who fatally struck iconic marathoner Fauja Singh on Jalandhar-Pathankot national highway on Monday turned out to be a Canada-returned man who sped away after leaving the 114-year-old to die, Punjab police said on Wednesday.The suspect, Amritpal Singh Dhillon (26), was arrested from his home in Dasupur village, 20km from Jalandhar, on Tuesday. The vehicle, a borrowed white Fortuner bearing a Punjab registration number, was seized. According to Jalandhar Rural SSP H S Virk, Dhillon said he did not know it was Singh he had struck, and that he had fled the scene because he was scared.Police have charged him with culpable homicide and rash driving. The police FIR says the vehicle was speeding, and that Singh's life could have been saved had the driver taken him to the hospital rather than fleeing.Singh's son, Harbinder, said the driver should have stopped to help his injured father. ""We would not have pursued a complaint against him had my father survived. But he should have stopped,"" he said. Dhillon told police that Singh was crossing the highway and he could not stop in time as the vehicle was going fast, said Virk. tnnDhillon was returning home from Bhogpur, a 16km drive that passed via Beas Pind village.As reported by TOI on Wednesday, the marathoner was walking towards his family dhaba across the road when he was struck.During questioning, Dhillon revealed that it was only at night, when TV channels started reporting Fauja Singh's death, that he realised who he had hit and run, said the SSP.According to police officers, Dhillon claimed he felt very guilty after that. However, he did not come forward to take responsibility for the death that was mourned by the world.It took meticulous detective work to track down the vehicle and the driver.At a press conference on Wednesday, SSP Virk said an eyewitness told police that the vehicle that hit Fauja Singh could have been an Innova or a Fortuner. ""We recovered a damaged part of a headlight and when we checked with Toyota agencies, we were told that it could be an old Fortuner from the 2009, 2010, or 2011 models. Then, from CCTV footage, we zeroed in on a Fortuner and also found a damaged headlight from one particular CCTV. We found the registration number from CCTV footage. Investigations revealed that the vehicle had been sold a couple of times,"" he said.By Tuesday, police felt sure they had the right suspect. And the same night a police team arrived at Dhillon's doorstep.The SSP said Dhillon had gone to Canada on a tourist visa eight years ago and stayed back on getting a work permit. His sisters live there, too. He was in the construction business and has a work visa until 2027. He had come to India on June 23 on an emergency certificate as he had lost his passport. Three weeks into his homecoming, he is now behind bars, accused of killing a legend who seemed to outpace time. Dhillon was produced in a local court on Wednesday and remanded in jail.","Amritpal Singh Dhillon, 26, was arrested from his home in Dasupur village, 20km from Jalandhar, on Tuesday.

Maple Leafs slammed for mishandling Mitch Marner trade to Vegas

Mitch Marner’s impressive regular-season statistics

The Toronto Maple Leafs encountered harsh criticism for their handling of Mitch Marner's sign-and-trade to the Vegas Golden Knights. Analyst Bryan Hayes labeled the move ""significant malpractice,"" inquiring the front office's awareness of Marner's intentions. The deal, which sent Marner to Vegas for Nicolas Roy, has drawn scrutiny regarding Toronto's timing and trade value.Mitch Marner’s recent departure from the Toronto Maple Leafs has ignited a fiery debate among hockey pundits and fans alike, centered mainly on the management's decision-making. One prominent NHL analyst, Bryan Hayes, didn't mince words, publicly criticizing the front office's strategy in what he described as ""significant malpractice.""This strong critique stems from the Maple Leafs' decision to secure only Nicolas Roy, and in return executing a sign-and-trade deal that sent Marner to the Vegas Golden Knights. The timing of this transaction, just as Marner was on the verge of free agency, has become a focal point of argument.Hayes, showing up on TSN’s ‘OverDrive’, analysed the complexities of the situation, pondering a crucial question: “I am curious.I would love to get an answer on what Shanahan and Treliving knew this time last year.”He went on to elaborate, “Did they know he was out? You’re hearing stories of ‘everyone knows, everyone knows he’s going to Vegas.’ If they knew that, then that is significant malpractice.” The implication here is that if the Leafs' leadership was aware of Marner's desire to leave well in advance, they missed a critical window to optimize their return for the star winger.Marner's tenure in Toronto, while marked by impressive regular-season statistics—741 points in 657 games—was particularly devoid of deep playoff runs, with the team never advancing past the second round in his nine playoff appearances. Hayes further challenged the player's role in the situation, inquiring, “If you’re so unhappy, why don’t you go ask for a change?”He added, “Why is it on the Leafs to force your way out?” This signifies a belief that Marner himself could have commenced a trade request earlier, potentially giving the Maple Leafs more authority. Marner, a 2015 draft pick, leaves behind a mixed legacy, celebrated for his regular-season prowess but scrutinized for the team's postseason struggles.Also Read: Bobby Orr blasts Ron MacLean over controversial claims about Don Cherry’s health and ‘exit strategy’ from Coach’s Corner This major move marks a fresh start for both Marner and the Leafs, leaving everyone wondering how Toronto's management will bounce back and rebuild their team for a real shot at the championship.","Maple Leafs slammed for mishandling Mitch Marner trade to Vegas.

Luka Doncic could walk away in 2026 and leave the Los Angeles Lakers

Luka Doncic could rethink after watching the Los Angeles Lakers moving past LeBron James

It looks like the Los Angeles Lakers could be on the verge of losing one of their top talents — Luka Doncic. Rumors are flying that the Slovenian superstar might bail on the team, and this possible exit seems linked to the way the Lakers have managed LeBron James , a legend whose treatment has caused some tension in the organization.Luka Doncic, a remarkable talent hailing from Slovenia, is currently facing a significant moment with the Lakers. He’s in the fourth year of a five-year, $215 million deal that he inked in [insert year], featuring a player option for the 2025-26 season. This means Doncic could potentially become a free agent as early as next summer if he chooses to opt out and forgo an extension.Starting August 2, 2025, Doncic will be eligible to sign a huge four-year, $229 million extension that would keep him with the Lakers until the end of the 2029-30 season. But earlier this offseason, ESPN’s Bobby Marks had a different perspective. He suggested that Doncic might opt for a shorter, three-year contract instead. Why would he do that? This strategy would allow him to renegotiate a year sooner, with 10 years of NBA experience under his belt—a key milestone that raises the maximum contract limit. Marks provided this analysis in an ESPN piece, emphasizing Doncic’s tactical choices.If Doncic decides not to take the extension at all, he might play through the 2025-26 season and then explore free agency next summer. ESPN’s Brian Windhorst highlighted the importance of this — “This is a stress max right now for Luka. The Lakers are a little bit stressed out about it. If he signs it, relief for the Lakers. … If he does not sign it, he can be a free agent next summer when there are going to be 10-plus teams with cap space.” Windhorst pointed out that various teams in the league are going to start making moves to go after Doncic, which puts more pressure on Los Angeles to keep him content.At the center of this drama is LeBron James, the Lakers' seasoned superstar since 2018. James is in the last year of his contract and will be turning 41 in 2025. The Lakers' management has indicated a move towards a future focused on younger players—specifically Doncic. This change, however, has sparked debate about the way James is being treated.Fox Sports’ Nick Wright pointed to this tension on July 16, suggesting the Lakers’ actions could be alienating Doncic. “I think the way the Lakers are not so subtly dissing LeBron James about how excited they are to be done with [him] — I can’t imagine Luka is happy about that,” Wright said on his show. He argued that the franchise’s apparent eagerness to move on from James, a mentor and teammate to Doncic, might erode the younger star’s trust in the organization. Posts on X, like one from [insert handle], echo this sentiment, noting, “LeBron James feels sidelined as Lakers prioritize Luka Doncic in secret meeting amid trade rumors.”Following the Buss family's sale of the Los Angeles Lakers to Mark Walter, the team is prioritizing Luka Doncic as their franchise star. Doncic can sign a 4-year, $229 million extension, while LeBron James' future remains uncertain as the Lakers manage cap space for 2026 signings. LeBron James wasn't aware about the deal between Buss family and Mark Walter but on the other Luka Doncic knew what was going on.LeBron James and Luka Doncic have a solid connection, with the veteran frequently mentoring the younger player both on and off the court. The Lakers not extending James' contract—or at least not giving him the respect that Wright thinks he should get—might be sending a signal to Doncic about how the team views its star players.Also Read: Jalen Williams plans retire his Parents after bagging the $287 million contract and championship season Keeping Doncic isn’t just about having a superstar on the team—it’s about safeguarding their legacy and staying competitive. To make this happen, they’ll have to fix some issues, starting with how they deal with James.","Luka Doncic is in the fourth year of a five-year, $215 million deal that he inked in [insert year], featuring a player option for the 2025-26 season.

John Shannon shuts down Sidney Crosby trade talk on Sekeres & Price

“I do not see it, period.”

John Shannon: Canucks business continuing deep into the summer. Would Crosby ever leave Pittsburg?

Rumors swirl amid Penguins’ declining playoff hopes

A legend likely to stay in Pittsburgh

Veteran NHL analyst John Shannon has weighed in firmly on the swirling trade rumors involving Pittsburgh Penguins captain Sidney Crosby. Appearing on the Sekeres & Price podcast, Shannon made his stance crystal clear: he does not believe a Crosby trade is on the table. As speculation grows around the Penguins’ future, Shannon’s words carry significant weight.When asked directly about the possibility of Sidney Crosby being traded, John Shannon responded unequivocally:His strong denial came during Episode of the Sekeres & Price podcast, a trusted source for NHL commentary. The veteran broadcaster and former Hockey Night in Canada executive emphasized that despite ongoing rumors, there is no realistic scenario where Crosby is moved.Shannon’s dismissal of the trade chatter is a major statement given the growing uncertainty in Pittsburgh. With the Penguins missing the playoffs for a second straight year and entering a transitional phase, many speculated that the franchise might part ways with its longtime captain to begin a full rebuild. But according to Shannon, that’s simply not happening.Trade speculation has picked up steam this offseason, fueled by the Penguins’ recent struggles and Crosby’s age, he is turning 38 this year.Reports from multiple outlets have linked him to potential suitors such as the Montreal Canadiens and Colorado Avalanche. Some insiders even suggested that Crosby could waive his no-move clause if the Penguins were fully rebuilding.However, team executives have consistently denied those claims. Both Crosby’s camp and the organization have remained quiet, preferring to let speculation play out in the media. Shannon’s authoritative voice, though, offers a reality check for those expecting a blockbuster move.Crosby has spent his entire NHL career with the Pittsburgh Penguins since being drafted first overall in 2005. He’s won three Stanley Cups and remains the face of the franchise. While changes could come to the team’s roster, it appears Crosby will stay put.John Shannon’s strong words provide a firm rebuttal to Sidney Crosby trade rumors. As the offseason progresses, fans and analysts may continue to speculate, but for now, it seems clear: Crosby isn’t going anywhere.Also Read: Carter Bear inks entry-level deal with Detroit Red Wings after strong WHL season",John Shannon says he does not believe Sidney Crosby will be traded.

From AHL playoff hero to NHL hope: Jake Leschyshyn’s gritty journey to Buffalo Sabres



Why Jake Leschyshyn’s playoff pedigree makes him a smart bet for the Buffalo Sabres

When your season is on the line, you want a player who thrives under pressure. The Buffalo Sabres announced Tuesday that they’ve signed 26-year-old forward Jake Leschyshyn to a one-year, two-way contract, adding clutch playoff scoring and leadership to their organizational depth.Jake Leschyshyn isn’t just another waiver-wire pickup. He’s a player who has built his career on seizing opportunities—even when they come with high stakes. From scoring the inaugural goal for the Henderson Silver Knights to netting series-winners in Hartford’s playoff run, Leschyshyn has proven he can step up when it matters most. Now he’s set to bring that grit and determination to Buffalo, looking for another shot in the NHL while anchoring the Rochester Americans if needed.Originally a second-round pick by the Vegas Golden Knights in 2017, Jake Leschyshyn’s path to Buffalo Sabres has been anything but linear. His early pro years were spent grinding in the AHL with Chicago and then Henderson, where he even made history by scoring the first-ever goal for the Silver Knights in 2020–21.Reflecting on that milestone in Henderson, Leschyshyn said at the time: “It’s special to be part of something new. I just wanted to set the tone for our group.”It was a glimpse of the leadership and poise that would define his career.He finally cracked the NHL roster in 2021–22, getting his debut on October 14 after injuries sidelined Mark Stone and Max Pacioretty. Leschyshyn didn’t waste time making an impact, recording his first NHL goal during a 7–4 win over the Vancouver Canucks on November 13.But consistency at the top level was elusive. He tallied two goals and four assists in 41 games with Vegas that season before a tough stretch in 2022–23 left him scoreless in 22 games. Vegas waived him in January 2023, and within 24 hours, the New York Rangers claimed him off waivers—a move that sent him from the desert to the bright lights of Madison Square Garden.Despite the new start, roster moves—including the blockbuster trade for Patrick Kane—forced the Rangers to waive him again, sending him to their AHL affiliate in Hartford. Instead of sulking, Leschyshyn turned adversity into opportunity, racking up 15 points in 18 games during the spring of 2023. That surge helped the Wolf Pack secure their first Calder Cup playoff berth since 2015.The 2023–24 season was another testament to his clutch ability. Though he logged just one NHL appearance—a six-minute stint against the St. Louis Blues—he delivered in Hartford when it mattered most. He scored the series-winning goal against the Providence Bruins, pushing the Wolf Pack into the division finals for the second straight year and finishing the playoffs as the team’s top goal scorer.“Playoffs are when you find out who wants it more,” Leschyshyn said in Hartford after that decisive goal. “I just wanted to help us keep playing.”The Buffalo Sabres see clear value in that kind of resilience, leadership, and big-game instinct. With this one-year, two-way contract, they’re betting on Leschyshyn’s ability to push for NHL minutes while serving as a proven, veteran presence for the Rochester Americans. For Leschyshyn, it’s yet another chance to prove he belongs on hockey’s biggest stage—a challenge he’s shown time and again he’s ready to embrace when the moment calls for it.Also Read: Chicago Blackhawks sign Anton Frondell to $2.9 million deal as Swedish ‘tank’ eyes NHL future","The Buffalo Sabres signed 26-year-old forward Jake Leschyshyn to a one-year, two-way contract.

Connor McDavid free agency sparks NHL frenzy as Oilers insider reveals he's likely staying in Edmonton,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/connor-mcdavid-free-agency-sparks-nhl-frenzy-as-oilers-insider-reveals-hes-likely-staying-in-edmonton/articleshow/122601310.cms,"As Connor McDavid's contract nears its 2026 expiry, speculation swirls about his potential move (Getty Images)

Gene Principe says Connor McDavid’s heart is still in Edmonton despite Stanley Cup heartbreak

The Golf Fight Heard Round The World w/ Nick Tarnasky + Gene Principe - Ep. 573

Leafs, Kings, and Rangers are preparing—but Connor McDavid might call the shots

Oilers front office makes re-signing their mission

As NHL teams gear up for a potential free-agent frenzy in 2026, the league’s eyes are firmly locked on one name—Connor McDavid. With his current contract set to expire on July 1, 2026, rumors are flying about whether the Edmonton Oilers captain could bolt for a big-market franchise like the Toronto Maple Leafs, New York Rangers, or Los Angeles Kings. But according to longtime Oilers broadcaster Gene Principe, the signs point toward McDavid staying right where he is.During a July 15 appearance on the Spittin’ Chiclets podcast, Gene Principe confidently pushed back on the speculation. When asked how likely he thought it was that Connor McDavid would stay, Principe said, “You know, I’m really confident.” He attributed that to the emotional toll McDavid has endured after two straight Stanley Cup Final losses to the Florida Panthers.“I just saw a guy who’s given everything and then some,” Principe said, describing McDavid as “gutted” following the 2025 loss. Even in that heartbreak, McDavid didn’t lash out or hint at leaving. Instead, he told fans, “Stick with us, because for all of us, it’s going to pay off.” That, said Principe, “was kind of better than ‘I love you.’”There’s no denying other franchises are circling. Toronto, in particular, has made no secret of its dream pairing of Auston Matthews and McDavid. As NHL insider Chris Johnston put it, “If McDavid becomes a free agent, of course, the Leafs (would try to sign him)—they’ve been nuts.”But McDavid holds all the leverage. As Johnston added, “He’s going to pick his terms.”McDavid has made his intentions clear: “I’m not in a rush to make any decision… If I feel that there’s a good window to win here over and over again, then signing is no problem.”General Manager Stan Bowman affirmed the franchise’s commitment, declaring, “He’s the best player in the league and a no. 1 priority.” While insiders believe an eight-year extension is unlikely, shorter-term deals worth $16–18 million annually are on the table. The message from Edmonton? They’re all-in on keeping McDavid—and right now, it seems he just might be all-in on staying.Also Read: Stanley Cup shame sparks Oilers' panic move—goalie coach out as franchise refuses to face roster truth","Gene Principe says Connor McDavid’s heart is still in Edmonton.

Mitch Marner's absence isn’t doomsday for the Maple Leafs



The Maple Leafs can survive without Mitch Marner—and possibly even thrive



The NHL’s 2025 schedule release brought immediate anticipation as fans circled two key dates: January 15 and January 23. Mitch Marner, now wearing Vegas Golden Knights colors, will face his former team twice – first in Las Vegas, then in a highly emotional return to Toronto. The move, part of a sign-and-trade that sent Nicolas Roy to the Leafs, marked the end of an era in Toronto. But despite the exit of one of their brightest stars, the Maple Leafs aren't folding under pressure.Drafted fourth overall in 2015, Marner was one of the Leafs’ offensive anchors for nearly a decade, racking up 741 points in 657 games and sitting among the franchise’s all-time leaders in both points and assists. His skill and playmaking helped Toronto reach the postseason every year during his tenure. Still, criticism followed him closely, particularly during the team’s playoff shortcomings. His final moment in a Leafs jersey came with boos during a Game 7 loss to the Florida Panthers—an ending that felt unceremonious for a player of his stature.Brad Treliving, Toronto’s GM, acknowledged the emotional weight of parting ways with Marner, stating, “When a player of Mitch’s magnitude moves away, that’s never a fun day.”Yet, he expressed confidence in what the Leafs got in return, especially with Roy’s ability to contribute meaningfully to Toronto’s depth.Losing Marner is no small blow, but suggestions that the Leafs are now destined for a rebuild or draft lottery seem exaggerated. The Leafs' foundation remains solid, especially in net with Joseph Woll and Anthony Stolarz forming what many consider a top-five goaltending tandem. On defense, Toronto boasts a physical, smart group that can dominate games — and possibly get even stronger depending on the future of Morgan Rielly.While the offense may lack the same firepower without Marner’s 102-point contributions, additions like Matias Maccelli and Nicolas Roy bring different, valuable dynamics. Treliving still has cap flexibility and may not be done bolstering the roster. If young talents like Matthew Knies or Easton Cowan step up, and veterans like Auston Matthews and William Nylander remain healthy, the Leafs could very well find themselves leading the Atlantic again.Yes, the Atlantic Division will be a battle. But Toronto has too much experience, depth, and organizational stability to collapse. So while January will be all about Marner’s homecoming, don’t overlook what the Leafs are quietly building. This is still a team with big-time aspirations—and the tools to back them up.Also Read: Could Sidney Crosby leave the Penguins if Evgeni Malkin gets traded?

Procedure and Hart's Recovery Outlook

A Fan Favorite with Unmatched Grit

swingmanhas undergone surgery on his right ring finger, the team confirmed this week, following an injury sustained during the franchise’s intense 2025 playoff push. Fortunately for the Knicks and their fans, Hart is expected to make a full recovery and return to basketball activities later this summer — well ahead of the 2025–26 NBA season.“Josh Hart underwent a procedure to his right ring finger due to an injury sustained in the playoffs. He will resume basketball activities later this summer,” the New York Knicks announced. Josh Hart ’s injury dates back to the Eastern Conference Finals, where he dislocated the finger in Game 6 against the Indiana Pacers . But in true Hart fashion, he didn’t let that — or the laundry list of other injuries he endured — stop him from playing. The 30-year-old appeared in all 18 playoff games, starting 14 of them, and averaged 11.6 points, 8.8 rebounds, 4.4 assists, and 1.1 steals in nearly 36 minutes per game.His toughness was emblematic of the New York Knicks’ postseason grit. From absorbing a brutal elbow to the face against Boston that left him bloodied, to leaving the floor in pain with abdominal soreness in the series-clinching game versus Indiana, Hart never backed down.His resilience and energy helped fuel the team’s deepest playoff run in over two decades.Throughout the 2023–24 regular season, Josh Hart proved to be one of the NBA’s most durable and productive players. He led the league in minutes per game (37.6) and started all 77 games for the New York Knicks . His season averages — 13.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 5.9 assists, and 1.5 steals per game — were all career highs. Shooting 52.5% from the field, Hart’s contributions were vital to New York’s success on both ends of the floor.From crashing the boards to locking down opposing scorers and initiating offense, Hart was the engine that kept the Knicks running. His ability to do a bit of everything made him one of the league’s most valuable utility players and a cornerstone of the team’s playoff surge.The surgical procedure focused solely on repairing the dislocation in Hart’s right ring finger. According to the New York Knicks, the operation went as planned, and he’s on track to resume full basketball activities later in the summer. The timeline puts him in a strong position to be fully fit for training camp and the start of the new season.There’s no indication the injury will linger or limit his availability, making this more of a short-term bump in the road than a long-term concern.Josh Hart’s comeback will coincide with a new chapter for the New York Knicks, as they usher in head coach Mike Brown following the departure of Tom Thibodeau. Known for his heavy reliance on starters, Thibodeau’s coaching style likely contributed to Hart’s league-leading workload last season. With Brown’s arrival, the team could look to distribute minutes more strategically, potentially preserving Hart’s energy deeper into the season.Having signed a four-year, $80.9 million extension in 2023, Josh Hart is firmly locked into the New York Knicks’ long-term plans. His leadership, versatility, and toughness make him a foundational piece for a team hoping to build on last year’s Conference Finals appearance.If anyone still questioned Josh Hart’s heart, the 2025 playoffs answered them loud and clear. Whether playing through a dislocated finger, a bloodied face, or nagging pain, Hart never let up. His hustle plays, relentless defense, and rebounding tenacity electrified Madison Square Garden and became a rallying point for fans.Now, as he rehabs and prepares for another grind of a season, Hart remains a symbol of the New York Knicks’ fight. And when he returns to the court — perhaps with all ten fingers taped for good measure — you can bet he’ll be ready to go.Also read: LeBron James' Future in Los Angeles Lakers Guaranteed Amid Trade Speculations After Latest Confirmation from the 4x Champion Bottom line: Josh Hart’s finger surgery won’t keep him down for long.

Golden State Warriors’ Roster Strategy Taking Shape

While much of the NBA has been active in reshaping rosters, thehave taken a different route — calculating, patient, and focused. Now, that patience seems poised to pay off. The Warriors are reportedly in serious talks to bring in veteran forward-center, a move that signals more than just a roster tweak.NBA insider Marc Stein recently shared his expectations on The Willard & Dibs Show, saying: “My expectation is that one way or the other, the Golden State Warriors are going to end up with both Horford and Melton on their roster. [And] they still have interest in Bradley Beal.” (H/t: Sporting News)While the Warriors have yet to finalize any of these deals, Horford’s name has repeatedly surfaced in conversations surrounding the franchise. His potential addition could fill a much-needed void at the center position, allowing Golden State to rest defensive anchor Draymond Green more often during the regular season.Despite turning 40 next season, Al Horford remains a valuable asset — particularly for a team that emphasizes floor spacing and high-IQ basketball. Though he may no longer have the agility or endurance of his prime years, Horford still holds immense strategic value.- Stretch Five Ability: Horford is a proven floor spacer with a career 36.4% shooting rate from beyond the arc.- Veteran Leadership: With years of playoff experience, Horford can mentor younger players and provide a calming presence.- Frontcourt Depth: His presence would reduce the physical toll on Draymond Green, especially through the grind of an 82-game season.While his three-point accuracy dipped last season, Al Horford had shot over 40% from long range in the two seasons prior. With Stephen Curry commanding defensive attention, Horford is expected to receive high-quality catch-and-shoot opportunities.If the Golden State Warriors succeed in acquiring Horford, they are likely to use him as a regular-season starter at center, preserving Green for high-leverage moments and postseason battles. In addition to Horford, the franchise continues to pursue De’Anthony Melton — a gritty two-way guard — and reportedly maintains interest in Bradley Beal.These potential acquisitions would strengthen both the starting lineup and the bench unit, reinforcing Golden State’s ambitions to return to championship contention.Although no deals have been made official, the expectation is that the Warriors will finalize at least one high-profile signing before the offseason wraps up. Horford appears to be the most likely target to arrive first, followed possibly by Melton.As Jeremy Kruger reported, “The Warriors and Al Horford have been linked since the beginning of free agency,” underscoring the persistent buzz surrounding the veteran’s potential arrival in the Bay Area.Also read: NBA Free Agency Rumors: Golden State Warriors predicted to re-sign #12.8 million veteran guard to support Stephen Curry and improve championship odds With the clock ticking and the Western Conference reloading across the board, the Golden State Warriors can’t afford to remain passive.

Instead, several ESPN analysts accepted it on her behalf ahead of the ceremony.ESPN’s Ari Chambers, speaking on Clark’s behalf, underlined just how important her presence has been for the league. “I see just exponential growth of the game, right?” Chambers said during the pre-show. “She brings eyes to the game so that the next generation can come out and thrive.Just a dynamic player, just exciting to watch.”Despite being a first-year player, Clark has brought unprecedented attention to the WNBA, on and off the court. Her averages of 16.5 points, 8.8 assists, and 5.0 rebounds per game, combined with her leadership, made her an obvious candidate for the prestigious award.The excitement of the ESPY recognition came just 24 hours after Clark’s night ended in pain. In the final minute of Indiana Fever’s 85-77 win over the Connecticut Sun on July 15, Clark appeared to re-aggravate a groin injury that had already sidelined her earlier this season.She limped back up the court after a late-game assist and eventually hit the stanchion under the basket in frustration before heading to the bench in tears, covering her head with a towel.Clark had only recently returned after missing five games with a similar injury to her left groin. This time, it appeared to be the right side causing discomfort. Before the setback, she had tallied 14 points, eight rebounds, and seven assists— nine of those points coming in a clutch fourth-quarter push.Head coach Stephanie White offered a measured but confident update following Clark’s injury. While the team awaited more medical evaluations, White emphasized the Fever’s preparedness in facing adversity.“I mean, I think we just take it one step at a time. We'll get some food and get on the plane and start talking about New York,” she told reporters.When asked about Clark’s status for upcoming games, including the All-Star weekend and three-point contest, White added:“She’s being evaluated. We’ll see where we are with that. And certainly, we’ll have another evaluation, probably in conversation in the morning, see where we are. But this group has played without her. At least we’ve got experience in that.”White also addressed the physical toll that Clark continues to face as a high-profile target in the league:“Yeah, I mean, there's a level of physicality that they're able to play with against her,” she said. “I knew it as an opponent, and I see it as her coach. And I'm not exactly sure why, but it just is what it is... We've got to find some ways to make it a little bit easier for her.”Also Read: Caitlin Clark frustrated with refs again during heated exchange in Fever-Sun game at TD Garden Clark’s ESPY win is certainly a reason for celebration for the Fever guard.

The honor came just 24 hours after she was forced to leave a game due to a groin injury.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122606304,imgsize-43136,width-400,resizemode-4/122606304.jpg"

Brian Urlacher believes Aaron Rodgers can win big in 2025

“I’m an Aaron Rodgers fan, people can get mad if they want to.

I like the way he plays, I like what he stands for, I like what he says.”

“They got a great defense, they got DK Metcalf, they got some guys on offense that can play.”

Aaron Rodgers faces pressure and doubts as he enters age 41 season

As the 2025 NFL season approaches, some fans are unsure about how much Aaron Rodgers has left in the tank. At 41, and coming off an Achilles injury, many believe his best days are behind him. But one NFL legend isn’t ready to count him out yet. And what he said might surprise Rodgers’ biggest critics.On Wednesday, July 16, 2025, NFL Hall of Famer Brian Urlacher appeared on Chicago sports radio station 670 The Score and made a bold statement about Aaron Rodgers. Urlacher said he believes the veteran quarterback could lead the Pittsburgh Steelers to 11 or even 12 wins this upcoming season.Urlacher, who spent his entire career with the Chicago Bears, said,He also praised the Steelers’ current roster and Rodgers’ potential fit.Rodgers joined the Pittsburgh Steelers after recovering from a torn Achilles tendon. He missed most of the 2023 season and had a limited comeback in 2024, but Urlacher thinks the 2025 season will be different.Rodgers turned 41 in December and is now entering a critical season in his career. He’s no stranger to criticism, but the doubts have only grown louder since his injury. Despite flashes of his old form last year, many still believe Rodgers is near the end.But if he leads Pittsburgh to 11 or 12 wins, as Urlacher predicts, it would be the team’s best record since 2020. That season, the Steelers also won 12 games under Mike Tomlin.Rodgers’ connection with wide receiver DK Metcalf, along with support from the team’s strong defense, could make a real difference. Urlacher, a former rival of Rodgers in the NFC North, believes the veteran still has what it takes.“If Aaron comes back the way we think he will, I think they’ll have a good season,” Urlacher added.For now, fans and analysts will have to wait and watch. But one thing is clear, Brian Urlacher hasn’t given up on Aaron Rodgers, and he’s not afraid to say it.","NFL Hall of Famer Brian Urlacher believes Aaron Rodgers can lead Pittsburgh Steelers to 11 or 12 wins in 2025 season.

The New York Liberty secured a strong 98-77 win against the Indiana Fever at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. The reigning WNBA champions displayed their strength and depth, taking an early lead and maintaining it throughout the game. For the Fever, missing star rookie Caitlin Clark due to a right groin injury was a significant setback, particularly on the second night of a back-to-back. Here’s all the info you need about the game, including major highlights, essential context, and player reactions.The New York Liberty set the pace right from the beginning, increasing their lead to 26 points by the third quarter. Breanna Stewart was phenomenal, putting up 24 points, grabbing 11 rebounds, dishing out seven assists, blocking four shots, and stealing the ball once. Five players from the Liberty reached double figures, demonstrating the team's diverse scoring options. Sabrina Ionescu contributed 15 points and seven assists, just shy of a double-double.The Indiana Fever had a tough time on offense without Clark, hitting only 36.8% of their shots from the field, this was their fourth-worst performance of the season.

'Pretty cooked': Ben Stokes after leading England to Epic Lord’s triumph

Poll Do you think the shape of the Dukes ball has affected the outcome of the series? Yes, it's a significant factor No, it's just an excuse

In the ongoing five-match Test series between India and England, the Dukes ball has emerged as an unexpected subplot. Across the three matches played so far, there have been repeated discussions about its shape and condition, with the Indian side visibly frustrated during the third Test when their request for a ball change was denied on Day 2.Following England’s thrilling win at Lord’s, former skipper Alastair Cook weighed in on the debate and also took a humorous swipe at bowlers. Speaking on BBC Sport, Cook joked about how bowlers often look for excuses when things don’t go their way.""I just love how bowlers are always moaning. It's like they bowl a bad ball and it's never their fault. They’ve scraped the footmark... If they bowl a bad ball, they look at the ball and blame the shape,"" said the England legend.While he did not seem too convinced that an out-of-shape ball is a genuine concern for bowlers, Cook also shared his take on what impact it has on batting. ""I think a batsman would much rather hit some slightly harder ball. Nothing worse than playing a lovely cover drive like I used to and it going nowhere,"" he added.Earlier in the 3rd Test, England legend Nasser Hussain did not mince his words when he called out the Indian side for their persistent ball change requests and expressed his surprise at the same. ""I cannot work out why you’d want to change a ball that was doing this much. I thought it was one of the most bizarre decisions,” said Hussain.As the debate around the ball continues, attention now shifts to the fourth Test at Old Trafford, starting July 23. With England leading 2-1, India face a must-win situation to keep the series alive.","The shape of the Dukes ball has emerged as an unexpected subplot in the ongoing five-match Test series between India and England.

Golden Knights enter the Connor McDavid conversation amid growing uncertainty



NHL heavyweights circling as McDavid holds the cards



In the months ahead, Connor McDavid will face a career-defining decision that could ripple through the entire NHL landscape. While the Edmonton Oilers are hopeful of locking him in for the long term, McDavid's eligibility for an extension has fueled massive speculation. With his current contract expiring after the 2025–26 season, the hockey world is watching closely to see whether he stays loyal to Edmonton or sparks a seismic shift by testing free agency.The Oilers, despite consecutive Western Conference titles, haven’t been able to finish the job when it matters most. The Florida Panthers have outshone them on the biggest stage, leaving many to question whether Edmonton is truly built for championship success. For a player like McDavid—widely considered the face of the league—winning is paramount.As rumors swirl, the Vegas Golden Knights have surprisingly emerged as a potential suitor. While signing McDavid might seem far-fetched given their current financial commitments—including the recent acquisition of Mitch Marner and the need to extend Jack Eichel—NHL insider Chris Johnston didn’t rule them out.“Like, Vegas has to probably think about it.I don’t know how they do it. I’m imagining. They’ve already signed Marner. I’m imagining they’re going to extend Eichel,” Johnston noted, hinting that creative cap maneuvering could make the impossible possible.The Golden Knights are known for their aggressive moves in pursuit of titles. If McDavid hits the market in 2026 without an extension, Vegas could explore drastic options to build a star-studded lineup around him, Marner, and Eichel.As of now, McDavid remains under contract with the Oilers, thanks to his eight-year, $100 million deal signed in 2017. But with no extension in place yet, the silence has only heightened speculation.According to Johnston, McDavid’s decision could hinge heavily on how the Oilers perform in the 2025–26 campaign. “Obviously, there are 31 teams that would like to have him but there are probably 10 teams that think they’d be in the running if they ever got a chance,” Johnston said.Those top contenders reportedly include the Toronto Maple Leafs, Boston Bruins, Chicago Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens, Los Angeles Kings, Tampa Bay Lightning, Vegas Golden Knights, and New York Rangers. If Edmonton falters, these franchises will be ready to pounce.For McDavid, the next move could shape not just his legacy—but the entire future of the NHL.Also Read: Even without Mitch Marner, the Toronto Maple Leafs’ playoff hopes remain strong",Connor McDavid's contract expires after the 2025–26 season.

Detroit Red Wings sign 13th overall draft pick Carter Bear

WHL success makes Carter Bear a top draft pick

Next steps: NHL or another WHL season

The Detroit Red Wings have officially signed one of their top draft picks, forward Carter Bear, to a three-year, entry-level contract. Selected 13th overall in the 2025 NHL Draft, Bear made a strong case for himself with an impressive two-way game and consistent production in the Western Hockey League. His signing adds another promising piece to Detroit’s rebuilding puzzle.On Wednesday, the Detroit Red Wings announced the signing of Carter Bear, the 13th overall pick from the 2025 NHL Draft. The 18-year-old forward earned his selection thanks to his strong all-around game and ability to contribute at both ends of the ice. Bear brings versatility to Detroit’s system, with experience playing both center and wing, making him a valuable asset in multiple roles.Despite being listed at 6 feet and 176 pounds, Carter Bear stood out thanks to his relentless motor, hockey IQ, and competitive edge. Daily Faceoff’s Steven Ellis ranked him as the 14th overall prospect and 10th among forwards heading into the draft. While an Achilles injury sidelined him late in the season, his strong body of work throughout the year ensured his stock remained high, prompting the Detroit Red Wings to select him 13th overall.Bear spent the past two seasons with the Everett Silvertips in the WHL, emerging as one of the league’s top young players. He recorded 57 points in 67 games during his rookie season in 2023–24, followed by a breakout year in 2024–25 with 40 goals and 42 assists for 82 points in just 56 games. Although his season was cut short due to injury, his offensive production and two-way play helped solidify his status as a first-round talent.While Bear lacks major international experience, playing just one game for Team CHL in the CHL USA Prospects Challenge, his play in the WHL was more than enough to garner attention from NHL teams.As per the NHL-CHL agreement, Bear will either start the 2025–26 season with the Detroit Red Wings or return to Everett for further development. His performance in training camp will likely determine his short-term future, but long-term, Bear is seen as a key piece in Detroit’s prospect pipeline.Carter Bear’s entry-level contract marks a significant milestone in his hockey journey. Whether he starts in the NHL or returns to junior hockey for one more year, the Red Wings have secured a promising young forward with the potential to make a big impact in the seasons ahead.Also Read: Dustin Wolf gets shoutout from Shania Twain after Calgary Stampede appearance","The Detroit Red Wings have signed forward Carter Bear to a three-year, entry- level contract.

“These are nothing more than rumors at this point,”

“But all the crying from Columbus is making me feel like it’s Thanksgiving Day weekend again and Michigan is pounding a hapless Buckeye team into the mud for the billionth straight year.” 😂😂😂

So is the Fox-Barstool deal happening or not?

If the deal goes through, it still has major implications

Final word: He says “just rumors,” but Portnoy’s already acting like he’s on set



What started as a bombshell report has quickly turned into a full-blown Twitter circus with Dave Portnoy right in the center, doing exactly what he does best. Earlier today,reported that Fox Sports is nearing a deal with Barstool Sports that would bring Portnoy onto Big Noon Kickoff and add Barstool content to FS1’s lineup. The report made immediate waves, sending the sports internet into a frenzy.Just when the news spread, Dave Portnoy tweeted.he wrote.So no denial. No confirmation. Just maximum trolling, especially at the expense of Ohio State.As of now, the deal is reportedly still in the discussion phase.said it would be “expansive,” involving:But Portnoy’s tweet has slowed the hype train at least temporarily.He didn’t deny any meetings or discussions outright. Instead, he did what he always does: downplayed the news while making himself the story.Even if it’s not official yet, the idea of Portnoy joining Big Noon Kickoff is already generating buzz.With ESPN stacking its pregame show with Pat McAfee, Fox bringing in Portnoy would mark a clear counter-move aimed at younger, digital-first fans.And since Fox is also a major NFL broadcaster, this deal could ripple across both college football and NFL coverage especially if Barstool starts dominating FS1 time slots during the week.So maybe it’s not a done deal. Maybe it’s early talks. Or maybe it’s all just master-level trolling by Dave Portnoy, who managed to throw Ohio State under the bus, fuel media speculation, and go viral, all with one tweet.One thing’s for sure: if Fox wasn’t sold on signing him yet, the internet just made their decision a whole lot easier.Also read - Fans call Caleb Williams “gay” again after new photos show him rocking blue nail polish","Dave Portnoy calls Fox Sports deal “nothing more than rumors,” takes shot at Ohio State anyway.

There is no need for asking directions these days thanks to the numerous navigation apps but the traditionalist in me loves the personal touch, the adventure of following an individual's unique way of drawing you a map.

When you come back from a little tour checking the jerseys, caps, socks and other collectibles, Phil is still there.""Is any cricket happening here?,"" he asks. When informed about the ongoing Test series, he shares a very disinterested look and claims, ""when the roads are jammed, that's when we know there is cricket happening. I don't think both Old Traffords have had matches on the same day. Not sure but it will be a nightmare for sure.

When Did This Happen Before?

How Can You Watch or Use This Event?

Why Does This Matter?

FAQs

Q: Why does the sun only align over the Kaaba twice a year?

Q: Can I see this from outside Mecca?

Q: What if it’s cloudy?





Twice a year, the sun lines up perfectly above the Kaaba, casting no shadows. Today is the second and final time this year. At 12:27 PM local time, the sun will be right above the Kaaba, making all shadows disappear. This moment is important because it helps Muslims everywhere check the exact direction to face during prayer, called the Qibla.This event happens because of how the Earth tilts and moves around the sun. As the sun moves south from the Tropic of Cancer, it aligns with Mecca’s latitude. When this happens, the sun reaches its highest point in the sky over the city, about 89.5 degrees above the horizon. Vertical objects won’t cast shadows during this time.The solar zenith is when the sun sits directly overhead at a specific location. For Mecca, this occurs twice a year. It’s linked to Earth’s 23.5-degree tilt and Mecca’s position at 21.4 degrees north latitude.When the sun hits this point, it lines up so perfectly that vertical objects, like the Kaaba and nearby poles, cast no shadows at all. This is not just a neat trick, it’s practical. Muslims can use this time to confirm the Qibla direction easily.This year, the first solar zenith over the Kaaba was on May 28, 2025. The next one will be on July 16, 2026. So today’s event is the last chance this year to see this alignment.Today, at 12:27 PM Mecca time (9:27 AM GMT), the sun will be directly above. If you want to check your prayer direction at home, find a sunny outdoor spot. Place a stick or any straight object upright on flat ground. When the sun reaches this point, the stick will cast no shadow.The shadow that does appear just before or after the exact time points exactly away from Mecca. That’s how you can find the Qibla from anywhere with sunlight.This event isn’t just for astronomers. It’s a natural way to confirm prayer direction without needing a compass or phone. It connects Muslims worldwide to Mecca in a simple, direct way.A: Because of Earth’s tilt and orbit, the sun passes Mecca’s latitude only twice annually, usually late May and mid-July.A: You won’t see the sun directly overhead unless you’re in Mecca, but you can use the shadow method anywhere with sunlight.A: You won’t be able to see shadows clearly if the sun is blocked by clouds. Try again next year or rely on other methods to find the Qibla.","Sunlight directly over the Kaaba eliminates shadows, marking a unique moment for Qibla alignment.

Poll How do you rate KL Rahul's chances of outscoring Shubman Gill over the next 10-15 matches? Very high Moderate Low

Former England cricketer Owais Shah has lauded KL Rahul , predicting that the stylish Indian batter is set to thrive now that both Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have stepped away from the Test setup. Taking on the responsibility of opening, Rahul has already made a strong impression, compiling 375 runs in six innings at an average of 62.50, including multiple centuries.With a more prominent position in the batting order, Rahul has taken on the challenge of guiding the innings and offering consistency at the top. Shah feels that Rahul, who often played in the background while Kohli was leading the charge, now has the chance to emerge as India’s primary batting pillar — even ahead of the in-form Shubman Gill ""I think he's been in the shadow of Kohli. With Kohli at the crease, he was always going to be your main batsman and Rahul was under the radar. But this is his time to flourish. This is the first series without Virat Kohli. Look at the batting order, yes Shubman Gill has done really well, I wasn't expecting it. I did not think he had it in him to do what he's done so far,"" Shah remarked on the Beard Before Wicket podcast.He also emphasised Rahul’s strengths — his technique and mental fortitude — and believes Rahul is now ready to fulfill his potential.""But I still feel KL Rahul is the best batsman in the batting line-up who you should be able to rely on.And it is time for him to deliver the sort of numbers his technique and temperament promise. I feel KL, over 10-15 matches, may just outscore Shubman Gill. I think we will see him really come about in the next 12 months,"" Shah continued.Rahul's recent century at Lord's wasn’t just significant in match terms; it etched his name into history, making him only the second Indian — after Dilip Vengsarkar — to be listed more than once on the Lord’s honours board.Nevertheless, despite Rahul’s performances, India currently trail England 1-2 in the five-match Test series.","Former England cricketer Owais Shah has lauded KL Rahul.

Vaibhav Suryavanshi

At 14, Vaibhav Suryavanshi has the world at his feet.While commentating in the second Test of the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, former India coach Ravi Shastri and ex-wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik unanimously predicted that the teenager is destined to play for the Indian senior team. Former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara, who is the Director of Cricket at Rajasthan Royals – the franchise Suryavanshi represents in the Indian Premier League (IPL) – revealed how the teen prodigy is already flooded with endorsement deals.Jos Buttler, who had the best seat in the house when Suryavanshi smoked a 35-ball 100 in a six-fest against Gujarat Titans in April, was floored by his bat swing and compared it to Yuvraj Singh and Brian Lara.Indeed, the teenager, who hails from Bihar's Samastipur district , is special.While the Indian men's team – led by Shubman Gill, once a prodigy himself – has cornered England's Bazballers in the ongoing five-match Test series , India’s women’s team has won a historic T20I series against England . And then there is the India U19 team, who are also making quite some noise on English soil.Suryavanshi played a crucial role in India U19's 3-1 series win over England U19 in the Youth ODIs. The swashbuckling opener amassed 355 runs at a strike rate of 174 while smashing 27 sixes . He then scored a crucial second-innings half-century in the Youth Test Daniel Peacock, a cricket analyst and statistician for the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), who has been covering the U19 series, shares how the teenager has already become a crowd-puller.“The first time I watched him in the flesh though, I do remember a real air of excitement at Northamptonshire for the second one-dayer – more photos, more press, the BBC had even come to see him play,” Peacock tells TimesofIndia.com.“I knew I was watching a serious star talent. He hit 86 from 31 in a 40-over game [reduced due to weather], which included six fours and nine sixes [match 3 at Northants]. He got a standing ovation after pulling the pacer Sebastian Morgan to backward square leg. The PA announcer, when announcing his score after the dismissal, said: ‘I think we will be seeing a lot more of this boy play.’”“Then at New Road, home of Worcestershire, in a near-perfect all-round performance, he strutted comfortably to 143 off 78 balls. By the time he walked off after being caught in the deep to spin, I think everyone inside the venue had long realised they had just witnessed something really special.”In the ongoing series, there are plenty of youngsters from both sides who are tipped to play for the senior teams in the future. Suryavanshi is at the top. His opening partner, Ayush Mhatre, who had a tough outing in the ODIs, scored a beautiful century in the Youth Test.On the opposite side are Archie Vaughan and Rocky Flintoff – sons of former England captains Michael Vaughan and Andrew Flintoff, respectively, who are touted to be the next big things in English cricket.Suryavanshi’s IPL franchise Rajasthan Royals shared images of fans who drove six hours just to meet the youngster , and Peacock vouches for it, saying the current U19 series is getting more media attention only because of him.“People are starting to make noise about him here. Cricket fans already know who he is – even if they can’t all pronounce his name. These games usually attract a few die-hards, but there’s certainly been a little extra media attention (we’ve had the likes of BBC, The Athletic, Getty, etc.), and a lot of British-Indians have come to watch Vaibhav play in the flesh for the first time,” he said.“I’m sure it won’t be too long until he’s playing at the highest level – Test and international cricket. When he does make his debut and starts scoring big, everyone in the world will know who he is.”There’s already plenty of hype around the youngster, with some calling him the next Sachin Tendulkar or Virat Kohli . But, absurdly, is it plausible that he can achieve even bigger things?“The people I’ve spoken to in the game – I think we all have the same feeling. We’ve watched and witnessed a young star in the making, something very special. I would go as far as to say he’s probably the best 14-year-old in any sport that I’ve seen live. I think the sentiment in England is that we are watching a very special young boy playing cricket – and the expectancy is Tendulkar-Kohli-level, or even beyond,” said Peacock.",14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi shot to fame by becoming the youngest player and century-maker in the Indian Premier League earlier this year.

They were asking me, ‘Is he throwing it or is this a correct action?’ They thought he was throwing it. I observed his action closely for three days. It was absolutely fine — there was nothing ‘chuck’ about it.“It’s an odd action, so the boys were confused. But I was also surprised at how much speed he could generate at 16.""His run-up was 10 or 12 yards, but he generated so much speed that the boys were afraid to face him because the ball was bouncing so much.And already, he could bowl a very good yorker.”Trivedi also shared what he told a young Jasprit, which proved to be a turning point in his career.“I said to Jasprit: ‘You should not change your action. That is your weapon. Don’t change anything about it. You can change your line and length, where you aim the ball. But this is your original action — it’s natural. And you never change natural,’” he said.",Jasprit Bumrah is currently the best fast bowler in the world. He is the only Test bowler to have taken more than 200 wickets at an average below 20.

Lamine Yamal has done just that, as he took over the number 10 shirt at Barcelona, previously worn by club legend Lionel Messi. The 18-year-old winger, already a key player for the Catalan side, made the switch official at an event held at the club shop at Spotify Camp Nou.""Messi made his path and I will make mine,"" said Yamal.

""I am grateful for what they gave the club and I will try to continue this legacy.""The youngster also responded to recent scrutiny over his birthday celebration: ""In the end I work for Barca, I play for Barca, but when I'm away from (the club) I enjoy my life, and that's all.""The player has been the center of attention for reportedly hiring people with dwarfism as entertainers for his 18th birthday party.
