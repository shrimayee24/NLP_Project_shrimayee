The “Cruel Summer” singer spoke to TIME about her relationship with Travis Kelce and the reason behind their public romance.Taylor Swift said, “When you say a relationship is public, that means I’m going to see him do what he loves, we’re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don’t care…”The billionaire pop star added, “The opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you’re seeing someone.

A mother's instinct kicks in as symptoms spark a race against time

Inside the emergency room where doctors worked swiftly to stabilise baby Capri

Family turmoil, NFL commitments, and the one update fans needed to hear

Global fanbase rallies around the family as messages of support pour in

A late-night dash to the emergency room turned into a wave of relief for Miami Dolphins star Tyreek Hill’s family when his eight-month-old daughter, Capri, was admitted with sudden alarming symptoms. The little girl, shared with Hill’s estranged wife Keeta Vaccaro, had grown unusually warm, lethargic, and “not herself.” Quick-thinking calls and faster medical hands helped her bounce back, with doctors now calling her recovery a ‘positive turn’.Keeta Vaccaro shared the moment every parent dreads — the instant one knows something isn’t right. In her Instagram update, she described noticing Capri’s heavy eyes and warm skin before rushing to phone pediatrician Dr. Jared Friedman. Within minutes, hospital doors swung open and nurses had her baby hooked up for tests. “Last night was scary,” she admitted, her words carrying the weight of those anxious hours.Hospital photos showed Capri, wrapped in a light orange gown, clutching her blanket like a shield. Keeta thanked Dr. Friedman for calming her in the chaos, recalling his text: “We got this. We are a Team!” Blood work and viral panels were done swiftly, each step explained gently so a worried mother could breathe.By sunrise, Capri’s temperature had settled, and she was responding to treatment with more alertness and strength.The scare comes just months after Keeta filed for divorce in April, with Capri’s November 2024 birth marking a bright chapter in an otherwise turbulent year. Hill, sidelined from a Dolphins practice by an undisclosed injury, has not confirmed if he was at the ER. Still, Capri’s life has been well documented on Keeta’s feed — from six-month milestones to Sunday church visits — proof that love can remain the anchor when life turns rough.As Keeta’s post spread, thousands of followers jumped in to comfort her. “Glad she is ok!” one wrote, while another shared, “Oh no!!! I’m glad she is feeling better!” A third simply said, “Thank God she’s ok.” For many parents, it was a story that hit home — that late-night terror, the helpless waiting, the relief of seeing your child smile again.From a panic-filled midnight to a hopeful morning, Capri’s quick recovery has become the only headline that matters for the Hills. And for those who have followed Keeta’s journey, the sight of her daughter resting peacefully is more than news — it’s a shared moment of gratitude. In times like this, the power of family love and the kindness of a supportive community feel more real than ever. Across the globe, fans continue to send prayers and warm wishes, reminding the young family they're not alone in this fight.Although Tyreek Hill and Keeta Vaccaro are separated and navigating a difficult divorce, their shared love for Capri remains the unbreakable bond that keeps them connected as family above all else. In every whispered prayer and hopeful glance toward the future, that love shines through- reminding us all that even in hardship, family endures.And for Keeta, that night will forever be proof that a mother's strength rises highest when her child needed her most. For Tyreek, it was a quiet remainder that fatherhood's truest measure came in moments of presence and care. Capri's smile the next morning was perhaps the clearest sign yet that brighter days were on their way- and that both her parents, despite everything, would always stand guard over her heart. In that shared love, they found a fragile but unbreakable hope that would guide them through whatever lay ahead.Also read: Disney’s ESPN strikes landmark deal to buy NFL Network — league grabs 10% stake in blockbuster swap","Tyreek Hill's eight-month-old daughter, Capri, was rushed to ER.

Poll Has Mohammed Siraj proven himself as a leading pace bowler for India in Test cricket? Absolutely No Jasprit Bumrah is still the leader

Former Pakistan fast bowler Wasim Akram has stated that Mohammed Siraj has evolved beyond being just a support bowler to Jasprit Bumrah and is now capable of leading India's pace attack in Test cricket.Siraj demonstrated this by taking nine wickets in the recent Oval Test against England, helping India secure a six-run victory and level the five-match series, particularly with his crucial performance on the final day where he claimed three of the remaining four wickets when England needed just 35 runs.Siraj played all five Tests in the series against England, bowling over 185 overs and maintaining his intensity throughout the matches.""Siraj was full of hunger and passion – it was an incredible effort. To bowl nearly 186 overs across five Tests and still be that fiery on the final day shows remarkable stamina and mental strength. He's not just a support bowler anymore,"" Akram said in an interview with Telecom Asia Sport.The Indian pacer showed resilience after a setback when he had miscalculated Harry Brook 's catch, stepping onto the boundary rope off Prasidh Krishna 's bowling, which allowed Brook to score 111 runs.""He's leading the attack and doing it with heart. Even when a catch went down– that of Brook – he didn't lose focus. That's the mark of a fighter. Test cricket is alive and kicking,"" Akram added.Akram revealed his engagement with the final day's play at the Oval, highlighting the compelling nature of the match.""I rarely watch cricket when I'm not working, but I was glued to the last day,"" said Akram.""I gave India a 60 per cent chance on Day 5. They just needed that first breakthrough. With Woakes injured and India sensing blood, it was game on. Siraj made that possible,"" said Akram.The former Pakistan captain also commended India's strategic decision to rest Bumrah for the series decider.""It takes a brave team to rest their best bowler. But India had the bench strength, and the plan worked perfectly,"" he said.""With the Asia Cup in 2025 and the T20 World Cup in 2026 coming up, this kind of foresight is essential. Bumrah is vital across formats, and managing him well is key,"" he added.The match at the Oval showcased Siraj's evolution as a frontline bowler for India, with his performance helping the team achieve a memorable victory despite the absence of Bumrah. His ability to maintain intensity throughout the series and deliver crucial breakthroughs has earned him recognition from cricket experts like Wasim Akram.This performance has established Siraj's credentials as a leading pace bowler for India in Test cricket, capable of shouldering responsibilities in crucial matches and delivering under pressure situations. His growth from being a support bowler to leading the attack marks a significant development in India's pace bowling resources.","Wasim Akram believes Mohammed Siraj is now capable of leading India's pace attack in Test cricket.

Fortnite has recently announced its highly awaited collaboration with the Power Rangers. In this crossover, we will see The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers take action against the Kraken-borne bugs in Chapter 6 Season 4 in Fortnite.From the Mighty Morphin Megazord to themed weapons like the Swarmstrike Launcher and the OG “Go Go Power Rangers” theme song, this collaboration will have everything it it. However, the highlight of this collab has to be the Power Rangers costume, which fans can get early even before its actual release.Just like players were able to notch up the Fantastic Four skins early before their release by participating in the Fantastic Four Cup in Fortnite, now there is another couple of tournaments which can grant two Power Ranger skins early - Red Ranger Cup and Pink Ranger Cup.Both the cups are going to take place on August 6, 2025. These are going to be solo tournaments, where players will take part in standard Battle Royale matches. Players need to check out the in-game Compete tab to know the exact timings of these tournaments as they will vary depending upon different locations and time-zones.The Red and Pink Rangers Cup will be available for only three hours. In this short span, players can enter a maximum of 10 matches per cup.If you are thinking about maximizing your chances by taking part in both the cups, then keep in mind that they will become live simultaneously and will expire at the same time. So, it is advised to the fans to only focus on one cup at a time.As the name suggests, these two cups will grant the Red Ranger and Pink Ranger outfits respectively. But how to get them? In order to obtain these skins for absolutely free, players need to be on the top spots for different regions in these tournaments. Players can score points to be in the leaderboards by winning matches and eliminating opponent players. Here is the region wise breakdown and top spots to secure the skins:Another interesting fact about these cups are that, these aren't region locked. So, if you are facing difficulties to be in the leaderboard in your native regions, then you will always have the option to change your server to any location for a favorable condition.However, those who fail to be in the top spots in these two cups, don’t need to be disappointed at all. If any player manages to score 8 points in either of the tournaments, then he will be rewarded with the Jason’s Mark Spray (Red Ranger Cup) or the Kimberly Was Here Spray (Pink Ranger Cup) or both.Usually players get their rewards from such tournaments immediately after these end. But the Red Ranger and Pink Ranger outfits will be available to the tournament winners at the start of Chapter 6 Season 4.Apart from the two tournaments, the Season 4 Battle Pass has also featured two different power ranger skins as well - the Green Ranger and the White Ranger.","Red and Pink Power Ranger Cups will grant players Power Ranger skins.

Ask Dubey: Coaching Decisions and Carter Hart Expectations

NHL eligibility hurdle looms despite growing Oilers buzz

Former NHL goaltender and current analyst Devan Dubnyk believes Carter Hart’s road back to the league could lead straight to Edmonton. Speaking on Oilers Nation, Dubnyk didn’t just throw out Hart’s name as a possible fit — he explained why the Oilers’ environment could finally allow the 26-year-old netminder to deliver on the potential many saw in him early in his career.Devan Dubnyk skated with Carter Hart over the summer and was impressed by both his conditioning and mentality. “Carter Hart has all the tools to be a top NHL goalie. Philadelphia hasn’t been the easiest place for long-term goalie success, but he’s still young and in his prime years. I’ve skated with him, and he’s been training the entire time. He looked great,” Dubnyk said.The Edmonton Oilers, who have long been searching for playoff reliability in net, could see Hart as both a competitive push for current starter Stuart Skinner and a potential successor if needed. Dubnyk stressed that while Hart might show “some rust at first,” the risk would be minimal compared to the possible reward. With Edmonton’s offensive firepower, a confident and focused Hart could flourish.There’s one major obstacle: Hart remains ineligible to play in the NHL “until further notice” due to league restrictions following the now-closed Hockey Canada sexual assault investigation. While Hart and others were cleared of criminal charges, the NHL has not yet granted him the green light to return.That uncertainty hasn’t stopped the speculation mill. Edmonton’s need for stability in goal, combined with Hart’s upside and potential affordability, keeps them at the center of the conversation. If the league reinstates him, Dubnyk isn’t the only one who believes several teams — not just the Oilers — will make their pitch.Also Read: Matthew Tkachuk injury update: Panthers star’s torn adductor leaves surgery decision looming and season start in doubt For now, the Oilers’ front office can only watch and wait.

NBA insider Jake Fischer of The Stein Line recently claimed that when free agency opened on June 30, the Chicago Bulls made Josh Giddey an offer of a four-year, $80 million contract. The team was hoping to hold onto the guard who is now a restricted free agent, going into the 2025 NBA offseason. However, Josh Giddey has asked for a salary of around $30 million a year, more than double the Chicago Bull's offer of $20 million.NBA great Josh Giddey had the best year of his career with the Chicago Bulls in 2024-25. However, as per Jake Fischer, the Chicago Bulls and the restricted free agent are currently at odds over a contract.The guard is still a restricted free agent. He has been negotiating a deal with the Chicago Bulls, but they have not been able to come to an agreement. There have been rumors recently that he is being pursued by other teams as well. The Golden State Warriors are said to be one of those teams.Jake Fischer, the NBA insider, recently shared the news as he wrote:""League sources say that the Bulls made an offer of $80 million over four years to restricted free agent Josh Giddey when the offseason commenced on June 30.. Giddey, of course, is seeking an annual salary in the $30 million range.Chicago has been anchored in the $20 million range in annual value ever since its original offer.""He further wrote:“Sources say Giddey has managed to attract some external interest from rival teams since free agency began, with multiple Eastern Conference teams contacting Giddey’s representation to register sign-and-trade interest.. Yet it’s likewise true that more than one rival front office has indicated a reluctance to try to engage the Bulls in sign-and-trade discussions, sources say, with Chicago having messaged for some time that it is not eager to discuss such scenarios. ”The Golden State Warriors , who have Jonathan Kuminga as a restricted free agent, have expressed interest in Josh Giddey. Stating the same, Jake Fischer wrote:“I’m told that the Warriors continue to value Giddey’s skillset and have communicated their interest to the Australian point guard’s representation. There simply does not appear to be a feasible pathway to such a trade … not right now.”The Chicago Bulls may be able to arrange a sign-and-trade that would bring them Jonathan Kuminga from the G.S. Warriors. With Jonathan Kuminga , the team has been experiencing a similar circumstance.

Connor McDavid trade proposal sparks Wayne Gretzky flashbacks among hockey fans



Connor McDavid’s contract clock is ticking



Connor McDavid’s name is dominating NHL conversations - not for his on-ice brilliance, but for the uncertainty surrounding where he might play next. With his contract clock winding down and no extension in sight, fans and analysts are left wondering if the Edmonton Oilers could face a decision as seismic as the one that sent Wayne Gretzky to Los Angeles decades ago. The possibility has ignited debates, fueled rumors, and stirred memories of the league’s most legendary trade.When NHL analyst Dan Powers floated the idea on the Empty Netters podcast that Edmonton should consider trading McDavid before he reaches free agency, he didn’t hold back on the drama. “I have said so many times — and this is not because we live in LA. — if we saw the King’s Ransom Part 2 and he got traded to LA, it would be the greatest thing to happen to the NHL in 50 years. It would be the greatest story of all time,” Powers said.The idea instantly rekindled memories of August 9, 1988, when the Oilers traded Gretzky, fresh off leading the team to four Stanley Cups in five years, to the Kings. The move was driven by financial strain on owner Peter Pocklington and sent shockwaves across Canada. Edmonton received Jimmy Carson, Martin Gelinas, three first-round picks, and a then-unprecedented $15 million in cash.Beyond the outrage, it transformed hockey in Southern California and sparked the NHL’s rapid expansion into U.S. markets once considered improbable.McDavid’s current eight-year, $100 million deal, signed in 2017, carries an annual $12.5 million cap hit and expires after the 2025–26 season. If no extension is reached, he’ll hit unrestricted free agency in the summer of 2026 — a prospect that sends chills through Oilers fans and excites rival franchises.While Edmonton’s management insists re-signing their captain is their “number one priority,” the lack of a signed extension has fueled endless speculation. Could the Oilers face a future where they must choose between holding onto their generational star or cashing in for a package that could redefine the franchise?For now, the echoes of Gretzky’s departure serve as both a warning and a tantalizing possibility. History has shown that one blockbuster move can reshape the entire NHL landscape — and McDavid might just be at the center of the next one.Also Read: Sidney Crosby earns unlikely fan as Snoop Dogg praises Penguins legend in unexpected revelation","Connor McDavid’s contract clock is ticking and no extension in sight.

The only scenario that could reignite Sidney Crosby trade talk



The NHL rumor mill has been buzzing this summer with speculation about a potential Sidney Crosby trade, but those whispers appear to be losing steam. Despite wild fan theories linking the Pittsburgh Penguins captain to the Montreal Canadiens or Colorado Avalanche, reliable sources say there’s no imminent move in the works.On his 32 Thoughts podcast, respected NHL insider Elliotte Friedman addressed the chatter head-on, making it clear that Crosby’s immediate future is set: “Crosby will be in a Penguins uniform to start the season.”For Penguins fans, that statement aligns with the reality many have expected all along. Crosby’s situation is very different from other legendary veterans like Ray Bourque, who left Boston late in his career to chase an elusive Stanley Cup. Crosby already has three championships under his belt, and his bond with Pittsburgh — both on and off the ice — runs deep.His leadership, consistency, and loyalty have made him the face of the franchise for nearly two decades. Moving on from that kind of legacy is far from typical in the NHL, especially when the player still produces at an elite level.While a trade remains highly unlikely, the rumor mill might spark back to life under certain circumstances.If the Penguins stumble early in the 2025–26 season and find themselves well outside the playoff race by Christmas, the conversation could shift.A prolonged slump could prompt discussions between Crosby and team management about his future. In that scenario, the possibility of moving him to a contender — even if remote — would make headlines again.For now, though, the Penguins and their captain are locked in for another run. With a refreshed roster and Crosby still leading the charge, Pittsburgh’s focus is firmly on competing in a stacked Eastern Conference.Also Read: Biden administration secretly plotted kicking Alex Ovechkin and Russian NHL stars out of U.S. to punish Vladimir Putin over Navalny Penguins fans can exhale — at least for this season, the heart and soul of the franchise isn’t going anywhere.",Elliotte Friedman says Sidney Crosby will start the season with the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Trade speculation cools as insider says Connor McDavid isn’t leaving

Oilers focused on securing Connor McDavid before final contract year

Connor McDavid’s future with the Edmonton Oilers has been a hot topic all offseason, but fresh reports suggest the speculation may be coming to an end. Despite chatter that the NHL’s top player might explore opportunities elsewhere, insiders say McDavid is much more likely to remain in Edmonton for the long term.With two years left on his eight-year, $100 million contract — carrying a $12.5 million annual cap hit — McDavid is inching toward unrestricted free agency in 2026. The Oilers’ recent Stanley Cup Final loss only fueled speculation that he might consider a fresh start. Rival franchises were rumored to be preparing aggressive offers, with uncertainty over both term length and annual value for his next deal.However, respected NHL insider Jason Gregor has thrown cold water on the rumors. “The relationship between Connor McDavid and the Edmonton Oilers is much stronger than some want you to believe,” Gregor stated. “You’ve likely read or heard numerous claims as to why he might leave. He isn’t leaving. An extension was always happening, and the only uncertainty is what the AAV and term of his new deal will be.”Gregor’s comments have shifted the conversation from trade talk to championship aspirations.The Oilers are reportedly prioritizing a deal that will keep their captain in Edmonton before he enters the final year of his current contract. A long-term commitment would not only secure McDavid’s leadership but also reinforce the franchise’s status as a perennial Stanley Cup contender.The main question now is whether the extension will mirror his massive eight-year pact from 2017 or take on a shorter, more flexible structure suited to the modern NHL landscape. Either way, it appears the Oilers and their superstar are aligned on the ultimate goal — bringing a Stanley Cup back to Edmonton.Also Read: “Ready to win our scramble”: Connor McDavid and Lauren Kyle join Leon Draisaitl’s wedding celebrations with stylish St. Tropez getaway If the extension is finalized soon, it could silence one of the league’s most persistent rumor mills and allow McDavid to focus entirely on chasing hockey’s biggest prize.",Connor McDavid’s future with the Edmonton Oilers has been a hot topic all offseason.

Mike Tomlin finally tells the inside story of his offseason talks that brought Aaron Rodgers to the Steelers



Aaron Rodgers finds his fit in the Steel city



The Pittsburgh Steelers’ 2025 offseason was a whirlwind of change: roster overhauls, key departures, and the complete reshaping of the quarterback room. Yet, in the middle of this turbulence, a story quietly unfolded behind the scenes. While fans speculated for months about whether four-time MVP Aaron Rodgers would join Pittsburgh, head coach Mike Tomlin already knew the answer. And he knew it well before the announcement came just days before mandatory minicamp.Aaron Rodgers, released by the New York Jets after two injury-marred seasons, was weighing retirement when Pittsburgh entered the conversation. Other teams circled, but it was the March 21 visit to the Steelers’ facility that planted the seeds for a deal. Though he left without a contract, the direction was clear to Tomlin.On The Pivot podcast, Tomlin admitted that Rodgers’ signing was never in doubt for him—even before the NFL Draft. That confidence played a role in passing on quarterbacks like Jaxson Dart or Shedeur Sanders with the 21st pick, opting instead for defensive lineman Derrick Harmon.“You know, this dude’s been doing it 21 years,” Tomlin said. “Man, four-time MVP, all of that stuff.I just wanted to know why. Why does the fire still burn? What is his agenda? … All he wants to do is win. All he wants to do is have fun within the game. … I believed him when he said it, but it’s fun to watch it play out. And you’re right, I knew something.”Aaron Rodgers’ decision came after personal considerations delayed his choice, but since joining, he’s been effusive about his coach. On The Pat McAfee Show, he called Tomlin “the man,” adding, “From Day 1 that we talked on the phone in the offseason, I was never talking to a head coach. I was talking to a friend. I respected the hell out of that.”For Rodgers, who endured a frustrating stint with the Jets—including a torn Achilles in 2023—Pittsburgh offers a chance to play without the shadows of past disappointments. Training camp has been marked by his visible engagement with young players, an attitude he promised Tomlin back in spring.While it’s likely the 41-year-old is entering his final NFL chapter, Rodgers hasn’t shut the door on 2026. For now, both he and Tomlin appear locked in on making the most of 2025, aiming to turn a well-timed gamble into a season worth remembering in Steelers history.Also Read: ""He didn't want my jersey"": Shilo Sanders’ NFL debut sees mom Pilar’s awkward Bucs jersey gift after coach dad refuses Buccaneers jersey","Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin reveals what convinced Aaron Rodgers to choose Pittsburgh over other NFL destinations.

Sanders family spotlight - On and off the field



It was a lighthearted twist after a milestone moment for Shilo Sanders. Fresh off an impressive NFL debut with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in their 27-9 win over the Tennessee Titans, the 25-year-old rookie wanted to share the moment with a sentimental gesture — handing his game-worn jersey to his dad, NFL legend and Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders. The response? A polite but clear “no.”“He didn’t want it,” Shilo laughed, adding, “Cause, you know, he’s a Hall of Famer. He expects like 30 times more… I’m gonna give it to my mom, though.” True to his word, he presented the jersey to his mother, Pilar, who proudly showcased it online.Shilo couldn’t help but praise her dedication. “Shout out to my mom for coming. She went all the way to North Carolina for Shedeur’s game, and then went to my game. So, you have my jersey.”While Shilo joked about needing “three picks” for his father to accept the gift, Pilar’s reaction left no doubt about its value to her. On Instagram, she wrote, “WOW! ❤️ @shilosanders first NFL GAME JERSEY! So Grateful, Speechless and deeply touched… we never had a conversation about this, so for him to do this all on his own is 💣💥🤯… moms you understand! 🥲❤️ l LOVE HIM SOOOO MUCH!!!”The Sanders household has been buzzing with NFL energy lately.Shilo’s younger brother, Shedeur, 23, has been turning heads in Cleveland as a potential long-term answer for the Browns at quarterback. Ironically, the Browns’ current struggles have come after parting ways with Baker Mayfield — now Tampa Bay’s starter and fresh off back-to-back Pro Bowl seasons.Pilar, 50, also drew attention at Shedeur’s game for her game-day look — a crop-top No. 12 shirt representing her son. While many celebrated her enthusiasm, a few critics voiced disapproval on social media. One comment read, “I would be embarrassed if my 60-year-old mom was conducting herself like that,” sparking minor online debate.Coach Prime himself, at 58, expressed pride in all his children. Sharing a family photo on Instagram, he wrote, “These last few days have been a blessing.”For Pilar, the jersey wasn’t just fabric and thread — it was a piece of her son’s journey, a testament to his hard work, and a gift straight from the heart. In her words, “moms will understand.”Also Read: Josh Allen spotted on romantic Buffalo date night with Hailee Steinfeld after missing Bills' pre-season opener loss","Tampa Bay Buccaneers rookie Shilo Sanders gave his game-worn jersey to his mom, Pilar.

Zach Bryan sparks feud with Chiefs fans after vowing never to perform in the city again

Past controversies with Chiefs culture and Taylor Swift

Country music star Zach Bryan is once again stirring the pot with Kansas City Chiefs fans — this time by declaring he will “never play in Kansas City” again. The 29-year-old “Something in the Orange” singer, a proud Philadelphia Eagles fan, reignited his rivalry with Chiefs supporters on Aug. 8 through a string of fiery X posts.The tension began when Bryan took a jab at Kansas City fans still reeling from the team’s loss to the Eagles in the 2025 Super Bowl, ending hopes of an unprecedented three-peat. “Where are all the three peat people from last year:/,” he wrote, prompting mixed reactions online. When a user pointed out he was alienating a fanbase that sells out his shows, Bryan doubled down: “Please understand I will never play in Kansas City. ”Bryan’s back-and-forth didn’t stop at concert boycotts. A fan sarcastically told him to “take us off your live album too,” referencing his track “Fifth of May - Live from Kansas City.” Without hesitation, Bryan replied, “Done brother.” As of Aug. 10, the track remains on Spotify, but the exchange fueled the online frenzy.In another jab, Bryan quipped, “I’ll be about to finish my show and then get a taunting call if I play at that stadium,” poking fun at NFL officiating.He later joked about how easy it was to get under the skin of Chiefs fans: “Bro all u have to do to piss off a chiefs fan is play a fair game of football.”This isn’t Bryan’s first run-in with Kansas City’s football culture. In September 2024, he made headlines after comparing Taylor Swift to Kanye West in a now-deleted post that read, “Eagles > chiefs. Kanye > Taylor.” He later apologized, blaming drunken tweeting and clarifying he respected Swift’s music.Also Read: “Cry about some dumb sh*t”: Cardi B refuses to apologize for fat shaming fan joke as Stefon Diggs romance heats up For Bryan, trash talk seems to be part of his NFL fan persona. “Guys it’s okay to talk trash to each other about football [y’all] are weird as hell,” he wrote in his latest round of posts.

Hailee Steinfeld joins Josh Allen for cozy Buffalo date night



The Super Bowl goal that still burns bright



The Buffalo Bills opened their preseason campaign against the New York Giants on August 9, but all eyes were on Josh Allen—despite the quarterback never taking a snap. Head coach Sean McDermott opted to rest his franchise star, leaving backups Mitch Trubisky, Mike White, and Shane Buechele to handle the offense in a 34-25 exhibition loss. While the result meant little, the night offered a glimpse into the mindset—and life—of one of the NFL ’s most determined competitors.Hailee Steinfeld and Josh Allen were seen casually eating dinner downtown in Buffalo on August 10. Though sidelined, Allen still ran out of the tunnel, warmed up with teammates, and soaked in the energy at Highmark Stadium. Off the field, the reigning MVP is stepping into a new chapter. Just over two months ago, he married Oscar-nominated actress Hailee Steinfeld in a picturesque Santa Barbara ceremony. “I got to marry the woman of my dreams, my best friend. I get to play football for a living, that’s my favorite thing to do,” Allen said during training camp.Steinfeld’s presence in Buffalo wasn’t confirmed for the opener, but fans spotted the couple enjoying a dinner date the following evening. The buzz didn’t stop there—Allen debuted a mustache earlier in camp, prompting playful ribbing from Bills Mafia. The team’s official account christened it “Stache season,” while former teammate Mitch Morse joked, “That’s a married man if I’ve ever seen one.Watch him go bald soon. ” For supporters, Allen’s evolving look was just another sign their quarterback is embracing life’s changes.Marriage may have brought Allen personal happiness, but his professional fire remains relentless. Despite multiple playoff runs, the Bills have yet to break through to a Super Bowl appearance during his tenure. “We are constantly telling ourselves that we still haven’t got there yet,” Allen told CBS Sports. “We’ve had good teams, but for whatever reason, we have not done it.”That hunger fuels his approach this season. Allen speaks of “turning over every stone and leaf” to find the missing piece, relying on both hard work and faith. “I keep telling myself to trust God’s timing because it’s never wrong. The only thing we can do is give ourselves another opportunity to get there.”As the Bills prepare for their next preseason test against the Chicago Bears on August 17, Allen’s absence from the opener wasn’t about rest—it was about preservation. For Buffalo’s leader, the journey to football’s ultimate prize is far from over, but now, he’s chasing it with both a ring on his finger and unfinished business on his mind.Also Read: “Kanye > Taylor”: Zach Bryan reignites Taylor Swift feud while taunting Chiefs fans and blacklisting Kansas City shows","Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld were spotted out on a date night in Buffalo.

From Taylor Swift's inner circle to ghosted contact

Where Travis Kelce fits into the buzz

For years, Taylor Swift and Blake Lively were one of Hollywood’s most unexpected yet adored celebrity friendships — from cozy holiday hangouts to glitzy red carpet moments. But according to new reports, things may have turned sour between the pop superstar and the Gossip Girl alum, and insiders claim Lively is bracing herself for the ultimate Swiftian fallout: becoming the subject of a song.Per Rob Shuter’s #ShuterScoop, a source alleges, “Taylor’s been distancing herself since the legal stuff started blowing up.” Lively, who has been involved in a legal dispute with her It Ends with Us co-star Justin Baldoni, is reportedly “terrified she’ll be the subject of a song… and not the flattering kind.”Another insider painted a starker picture, claiming the actress “went from being Taylor’s inner-circle icon to a ghosted contact” — adding the ominous warning, “And with Taylor, when you’re out… you’re a verse away from being dragged.”A mutual friend reportedly quipped that Lively is “smart enough to know the lyrics before they drop” and fears “they might rhyme with betrayal.” While neither Swift nor Lively has addressed the speculation publicly, their absence from each other’s recent public appearances hasn’t gone unnoticed by fans.As Swift’s romance with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce continues to dominate headlines, some fans have connected the dots between her personal relationships and her songwriting.Swift has a long history of drawing on her real-life experiences in music, and with Kelce now a major part of her public image, even her platonic friendships are getting pulled into the narrative.Social media debates suggest that Swift’s fiercely protective fanbase — and her high-profile romance — could intensify the fallout if Lively does end up in a lyric. Kelce, though uninvolved in the alleged rift, is seen by some as part of the “Taylor bubble” that defines who’s in or out of her close-knit world.Also Read: “Karma is a relaxing thought”: Swifties celebrate C.J.

The WNBA is having the worst kind of problem recently, what with s*x toys dying around the arenas during game time. Sophie Cunningham, who had previously posted a tweet asking fans to stop throwing these s*x toys in the court, actually got hit by one of them during her latest game. After the incident, remembering her mother’s warning before the game, Cunningham had the best response to the incident. But all that does not mean she is not going to enjoy her time while all this is going on.Sophie Cunningham, after her game against the Los Angeles Sparks, is having an excellent time, while also enjoying her games. She recently showed up twinning alongside teammate Lexie Hull, and fans couldn't help but be in awe of the two.She also took to her X (formerly Twitter) to quote-tweet one of her previous tweets. Previously, after the second time a s*x toy was thrown during a WNBA game, she had tweeted ""stop throwing d*ldos on the court… you’re going to hurt one of us.” After the latest game against the Sparks, she quoted that same tweet, writing, ""this did NOT age well.""She also took to her Instagram stories later to say, “No way that thing actually hit me.I knew I shouldn’t have tweeted that,” referring to the incident in court. Hopefully, those who have been throwing these things at the players can stop, and such incidents won't happen again.Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham was up against the Los Angeles Sparks in her latest game, when yet another s*x you came flying in, and hit the WNBA star on her leg. The toy grazed her leg, and the play was halted for a short while to remove the offensive object from the court before things could resume. After the game, Cunningham sat for her new podcast show, Show Me Something, where she shared a hilarious warning he got from her mother.“The funny thing is my parents and my sister, they literally text me before every game saying, like, ‘good luck.’ My mom, instead of my ‘good luck’ text she goes, ‘Watch out for flying d*ldos tonight. And then the other one said, ‘Did you really just post the d*ldo tweet? It got some legs.’ She goes, ‘It’s funny a lot of others think so too. Did you see the d*ldo hit the court?’ I never thought that I’d be talking about this with Momma P. ”Instead of the usual ""good luck"" or ""all the best"" texts that her mother sends her before games, this time around, senior Cunningham had a different text sent, to warn her daughter. And watching ""out for flying d*ldos"" was the way to go, not that the Indiana Fever guard had much luck with trying to watch out for the mean greens.Also Read: “All because they are women”: Fans outraged over s*x toy being thrown at Sophie Cunningham again despite her lighthearted posts","Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham was hit by a s*x toy during her latest game.
