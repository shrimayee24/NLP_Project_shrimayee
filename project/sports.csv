Team India are set to pocket a record-breaking sum from the International Cricket Council (ICC) following their historic victory in the Women’s World Cup 2025 final against South Africa at the DY Patil Stadium on Sunday.With the win, India not only lifted their maiden Women’s World Cup title but also secured the highest-ever prize money in the history of cricket - a whopping USD 4.48 million (Rs 39.78 crore).The amount is part of a total tournament pool of USD 13.88 million (about Rs 123 crore), which was announced by the ICC ahead of the event. This was a whopping 297 per cent increase from the USD 3.5 million purse at the 2022 edition in New Zealand.The winners’ prize of USD 4.48 million represents a 239 per cent jump from the USD 1.32 million that Australia received for winning the last edition, while runners-up South Africa will earn USD 2.24 million (Rs 19.88 crore).Each losing semi-finalist is entitled to USD 1.12 million (Rs 9.94 crore), while all eight teams were guaranteed USD 250,000 for participation, plus an additional USD 34,314 for every group-stage win.According to a PTI report, the BCCI is also considering matching the prize and bonuses that the men’s team received after their T20 World Cup 2024 win.A senior BCCI source told PTI, “The BCCI supports equal pay for men and women and hence there are lot of discussions that if our girls win the World Cup, the reward won't be anything less compared to the men's global triumph. But it isn't nice to make an announcement before they win the Cup.”The Rohit Sharma-led men’s team was awarded ₹125 crore for their T20 World Cup victory last year, a figure that could now serve as a benchmark for the women’s side following their landmark success.As the celebrations continue in Navi Mumbai, India’s triumph, and the record prize it brings marks a defining moment for women’s cricket and reflects the ICC’s stated goal of “a world-class Women’s Cricket World Cup” and “a clear commitment to long-term growth.”The final saw Team India women defeat Laura Wolvaardt's South Africa by 52 runs in Navi Mumbai.","India women secured a historic win at DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai to secure a record sum in prize money from the ICC.

Gayle didn’t flee: Rasool slams memes mocking star after Kashmir cricket fiasco,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gayle-didnt-flee-rasool-slams-memes-mocking-star-after-kashmir-cricket-fiasco/articleshow/125095639.cms,"Photo/Agencies

SRINAGAR: Former India all-rounder Parvez Rasool condemned Tuesday social media memes mocking West Indies star Chris Gayle after the abrupt collapse of Indian Heaven Premier League (IHPL) in J&K, calling the portrayal “irresponsible and harmful for Kashmir’s cricket”.Rasool said Gayle did not flee but left after completing his three-match commitment. “When he left the hotel, everyone greeted him warmly. People must show respect to such a great cricketer,” he said, adding that Gayle’s presence encouraged local players and promoted tourism. Gayle was seen last week enjoying a Shikara ride on Dal Lake, smiling and waving to fans.“An international cricketer of great repute, Chris Gayle, was here. He praised one of our boys and said he played well. It was a rare moment for us,” Rasool said. “He interacted with local players, visited Dal Lake to promote tourism, and now people are making memes saying he ran away. That’s unfair and not good for us or for cricket.”The T20 tournament organised by non-profit Yuva Society collapsed Saturday night after organisers allegedly fled a Srinagar hotel without paying players, staff, or umpires.Turning to the controversy, Rasool said the league was “poorly managed” but not a scam. “I was the biggest sufferer and they didn’t pay me anything,” he said. “The idea was to give local players a chance to share the field with international cricketers. Unfortunately, lack of sponsors and poor crowd turnout ruined it.”","Former India all-rounder Parvez Rasool condemned Tuesday social media memes mocking West Indies star Chris Gayle.

Charlise Springer’s words remind fans what baseball truly stands for

A season that tested every ounce of heart, faith, and resilience

Looking ahead as the Blue Jays promise to ‘run it back’

When the Toronto Blue Jays’ dream run came to a heartbreaking end in Game 7 of the World Series, it wasn’t just the players who felt the pain—it was their families, the fans, and an entire nation that had believed in their story. After leading the series 3–2 and returning home to Rogers Centre with hopes of ending a 32-year title drought, the Blue Jays watched their fairytale slip away. Costly missed chances in Game 6 and a gut-wrenching ninth-inning home run by Miguel Rojas sealed their fate, leaving the stadium heavy with silence and disbelief.A day later, while the city was still nursing its heartbreak, George Springer’s wife, Charlise Springer, stepped forward with a message that struck deep emotional chords. Her heartfelt words, filled with gratitude, pride, and grace, reminded everyone that baseball is more than just wins and losses—it’s about resilience, connection, and moments that outlast the scoreboard. “I’m so proud of my husband, this team and every single family that poured their hearts into this season,” she wrote. “The highs, the late nights, the travel, the memories. Baseball doesn’t promise fairytale endings, but it gives you people and moments that last a lifetime.Feeling nothing but gratitude for the chance to represent Canada’s team and be part of something so special🇨🇦 💙 Until next season🐎#RunItBack.”Charlise’s post quickly spread across social media, not for its glamour, but for its sincerity. Thousands of fans flooded the comments, calling her words “beautiful,” “real,” and “exactly what the city needed to hear.” In a moment of collective heartbreak, her message brought perspective—it wasn’t about the loss, but about the love, loyalty, and shared memories that baseball creates. Her reflection reminded everyone that behind every player’s jersey is a family that lives every win and loss just as deeply.For the Blue Jays, this wasn’t just another playoff push—it was a season that redefined their identity. From battling injuries and midseason slumps to clawing their way into the postseason spotlight, Toronto defied every odd stacked against them. Charlise’s words, “This group showed nothing but heart, humility and resilience from day one and it was an honor to watch them chase this dream together ,” perfectly echoed what fans had witnessed all season long—a team that played for each other and carried the weight of a nation on their shoulders.George Springer, one of the veterans who has become the emotional heartbeat of the clubhouse, embodied that spirit of fight. Through every late-night comeback and pressure-packed inning, he stood as a symbol of belief and leadership. And while the final chapter didn’t end in celebration, it unfolded with the kind of grit that defines lasting legacies.Though the pain of this loss may linger through the winter, the message of hope remains loud and clear. With their core still intact and a fanbase unwavering in belief, the Blue Jays are already turning the page with one mantra: Run it back. As Charlise Springer so beautifully expressed, baseball may not always deliver fairytales—but it always delivers moments that stay forever. And for Toronto, that story is far from over. Because every heartbreak in this city, only fuels a stronger comeback. And when the lights shine again next season, the Blue Jays will be ready to write the ending they've long waited for.Also read: Shohei Ohtani’s rare Game 7 moment sparks fiery exchange as Toronto Blue Jays’ manager John Schneider confronts umpire in World Series showdown","The Toronto Blue Jays lost to the Houston Astros in Game 7 of the World Series.

Brittany Mahomes felt the line was crossed and she wanted the public to know it

As Patrick Mahomes returns to Buffalo, the stakes are different — but emotions are always present





For most NFL spouses, game week tends to mean travel, schedules, childcare adjustments, and a flood of national attention, but for Brittany Mahomes, there’s history attached to Buffalo. And not the fun, competitive kind. Before this weekend’s Chiefs-Bills showdown, an old incident involving a Bills supporter is circulating again online, reminding fans that not every rivalry moment lives only inside the stadium walls.Brittany, who has been in the public eye alongside Patrick Mahomes since college, once publicly reacted to a fan display that crossed a major line. Now, with yet another high-stakes meeting on the schedule, the memory of that moment is once again part of the conversation.Ahead of a previous Chiefs vs Bills matchup, Brittany Mahomes addressed what she considered to be one of the ugliest fan moments she had ever seen involving her family. A Kermit the Frog puppet, wearing a Patrick Mahomes No. 15 jersey, was hung publicly in Buffalo.Brittany's reaction was immediate, emotional, and blunt. “Do we remember this, Buffalo? Absolutely disgusting,” she posted. She also followed that with a pointed reminder about basic decency in sports culture, writing, “So as you go home tonight, I pray we become better people.”Those words weren’t just about trash talk. They were about human respect and they still land heavily today.Sunday's meeting wasn't just another regular season date. Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen have developed the kind of on-field rivalry that dictates national windows, defines postseason eras, and fuels nonstop football debate. Kansas City enters with momentum. Buffalo enters with swagger. Both enter with pressure.And on the periphery of all that football energy sits a memory from November 2024, a moment Brittany Mahomes hasn’t forgotten, and clearly never wanted normalized. It proves one thing: rivalries can be electric. But respect still matters, especially when the entire world is watching.Also Read: “A sad, pathetic, nobody loser”: Swifties unleash fury on Kayla Nicole after Halloween stunt reignites drama with Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift","Brittany Mahomes publicly condemned a disrespectful Kermit the Frog puppet mocking Patrick Mahomes, urging for basic decency.

The Bigger Picture: Sending a Message to Tarik Skubal

As the 2025 MLB season officially comes to an end, the focus quickly shifts toward the offseason - a period that promises major shakeups across the league. With a long list of stars expected to test free agency, front offices are already weighing their options between blockbuster signings and strategic trades. For the, one of the biggest storylines centers on their uncertain infield situation and the possible departure of Gleyber Torres.This offseason features a loaded market with names like Kyle Schwarber, Cody Bellinger, Alex Bregman, and Pete Alonso potentially switching uniforms. While many clubs are expected to make aggressive pushes in free agency, others will look to bolster their rosters through the trade market. The Tigers may fall into the latter group, especially if they decide to replace Torres with an established All-Star talent.This winter’s free-agent market is stacked with talent. Stars like Kyle Schwarber, Cody Bellinger, Alex Bregman, and Pete Alonso headline a group of players who could redefine the league landscape. However, while many franchises will dive into free agency, others - like the Detroit Tigers - may prefer the trade route to strengthen key areas.Expect some clubs to move aggressively early in the market, while others play the waiting game to gauge player values. Either way, there’s a sense that this offseason will spark considerable movement, with several marquee names possibly finding new homes.The Detroit Tigers face a crucial decision regarding Gleyber Torres, who is now an unrestricted free agent. Losing him would be a significant blow to the team’s lineup. Torres played in 145 regular-season games in 2025, producing a .256/.358/.387 slash line with 16 home runs and 74 RBIs. His consistency and presence were vital to Detroit’s overall success, making him a priority - though re-signing him may prove difficult given market competition.According to Bleacher Report’s Joel Reuter, the Tigers could make a blockbuster move by trading with the Toronto Blue Jays for two-time All-Star Bo Bichette. Reuter wrote, “Bo Bichette does not turn 28 years old until March 5, and after a down year in 2024, he returned to elite form offensively this season with a .311/.357/.483 line that included 44 doubles, 18 home runs and 94 RBI in 139 games.”Here’s a quick look at how Bichette compares to Torres in 2025:Bichette’s offensive resurgence makes him an ideal candidate for Detroit’s infield. Although his defensive metrics at shortstop suggest limitations, a shift to second base could maximize his strengths while filling Torres’ vacancy.A move for Bichette would carry broader implications beyond filling a positional gap. It would also signal Detroit’s commitment to building a legitimate championship contender. As Reuter noted, “It would also represent a significant move to show Tarik Skubal the front office is serious about building a title contender, as the Detroit Tigers try to hammer out a long-term extension with their ace before he hits the open market after the 2026 season. ”By bringing in an All-Star-caliber talent like Bichette, the Tigers could demonstrate to Skubal - and the rest of the roster - that the organization is intent on competing for a World Series.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Philadelphia Phillies potentially eyeing $190 million star amid Alec Bohm uncertainty The Detroit Tigers’ front office faces a defining offseason.

What happened to Zion Williamson? Pelicans star forward receives heartbreaking injury update,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/what-happened-to-zion-williamson-pelicans-star-forward-receives-heartbreaking-injury-update/articleshow/125099823.cms,"Zion Williamson.

Zion Williamson’s latest hamstring injury halts strong start



The New Orleans Pelicans’ winless start to the 2025 NBA season just took another painful turn. Star forward Zion Williamson has suffered a Grade 1 left hamstring strain, the team announced Tuesday, sidelining him for at least seven to ten days. The 25-year-old will be re-evaluated after that period, but no official return date has been set.The timing couldn’t be worse for New Orleans, which sits at 0-6 after a rough opening stretch. Williamson had been one of the few bright spots, leading the team in scoring, rebounding, and assists. His latest setback adds another chapter to a career that’s been defined as much by injuries as by his explosive talent.Before his injury, Zion Williamson was averaging 22.8 points, 6.8 rebounds, and 4.6 assists per game, proving once again why he’s the centerpiece of the Pelicans’ offense. In Sunday’s loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder, he led the team with 20 points, nine rebounds, and six assists, displaying the versatility that made him the No. 1 overall pick in the 2019 NBA Draft.But just days later, the Pelicans confirmed the news fans dreaded. “Zion Williamson has been diagnosed with a grade 1 left hamstring strain. He will be re-evaluated in 7-10 days and further updates will be appropriately provided.,”the team’s statement read. The announcement sparked concern, given Williamson’s long history of lower-body injuries, particularly hamstring issues that have sidelined him repeatedly in recent seasons.Since entering the league, Williamson has played in just 219 of a possible 478 regular-season games, missing more time than he’s been available. He appeared in only 30 contests last season before a back injury ended his campaign early. Despite these interruptions, his efficiency remains elite, averaging 24.6 points on 58.6% shooting for his career.The setback is particularly disheartening considering Williamson’s efforts to start the season healthy. He told reporters during training camp, “It feels good to feel good. I haven’t felt like this since college or high school.” His improved conditioning and dominant preseason performances had reignited hope that he might finally play a full season.Now, that hope is once again on pause. The Pelicans, desperate to turn their season around, must regroup without their franchise cornerstone.Also Read: Kawhi Leonard’s name dragged once again as 11 Aspiration investors filed lawsuit against LA Clippers owner Steve Ballmer","Zion Williamson has been ruled out for at least seven to ten days with a hamstring strain.

New York Mets Exploring Power Options in the NL East

Braves Adopting a New DH Philosophy

Why Marcell Ozuna Fits Perfectly in New York

Player Current Team Awards Estimated Contract Potential Role with Mets Marcell Ozuna Atlanta Braves 3× All-Star, 2× Silver Slugger, Gold Glove $65 Million (existing deal) Power bat, DH/OF option

Theare entering a crucial offseason, and all eyes are on the uncertain future of their franchise slugger, Pete Alonso. With Alonso potentially heading toward free agency or a trade, the Mets could be forced to find a new power bat to anchor their lineup. One intriguing - and surprising - name emerging as a potential target is Atlanta Braves veteranOzuna, a three-time All-Star, two-time Silver Slugger, and Gold Glove winner, has been a central figure in the Braves’ offensive success in recent seasons. Now, as Atlanta reportedly looks to shift its approach to the designated hitter position, Ozuna’s future with the team appears uncertain - and the Mets could take advantage of that situation.With Alonso’s future hanging in the balance, New York Mets’ front office is expected to explore every avenue to maintain offensive firepower. Ozuna could offer a proven, right-handed power bat capable of driving in runs and keeping pressure on opposing pitchers. The 34-year-old slugger remains a formidable threat at the plate, known for his ability to produce consistent power numbers and handle high-leverage situations.Last season, the Braves reportedly attempted to trade Marcell Ozuna at the deadline, but multiple deals fell through. The veteran, who holds 10-5 rights (10 years in MLB, 5 with the same team), was said to have vetoed three separate trade proposals. Despite that, the expectation heading into 2026 is that Atlanta could revisit potential moves involving him as they adjust their roster strategy.Reports suggest that Braves general manager Alex Anthopoulos and his staff are leaning toward a more flexible approach for the designated hitter role. Instead of relying on a full-time DH, the team plans to rotate players like Ronald Acuña Jr., Jurickson Profar, Sean Murphy, and Matt Olson through the position to keep them fresh. This marks a strategic shift that could make Ozuna expendable as Atlanta focuses on lineup versatility for the 2026 campaign.If Alonso departs, the New York Mets will need an established veteran presence to fill the void in the middle of their order.

“I don’t have any interest…”: Joe Alwyn’s old comments about Taylor Swift resurfaces and fans claim Travis Kelce is the total opposite,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/i-dont-have-any-interest-joe-alwyns-old-comments-about-taylor-swift-resurfaces-and-fans-claim-travis-kelce-is-the-total-opposite/articleshow/124992561.cms,"Taylor Swift's love life has shifted from a private romance with Joe Alwyn to a public spectacle with Travis Kelce. While Alwyn offered quiet devotion, Kelce brings an open, expressive joy. Friends say Swift is glowing, embracing this new chapter with confidence and living her love story out loud, on her own terms.

Joe Alwyn once called being Taylor Swift’s muse “flattering”

From Joe Alwyn’s quiet loyalty to Travis Kelce’s bold devotion





Before Taylor Swift ’s high-profile romance with NFL star Travis Kelce captured the world’s attention, the singer experienced a very different kind of love with British actor Joe Alwyn . Their six-year relationship was built on privacy, calm, and quiet devotion, a stark contrast to the spotlight-fueled excitement surrounding her current relationship.Joe Alwyn’s composed attitude toward fame and his ability to protect their bond from media noise once defined Swift’s most peaceful chapter. Now, years later, Swift appears to have found joy in a more open and expressive love with Kelce. From game-day appearances to public displays of affection, she seems more confident and carefree than ever, embracing happiness on her own terms while rewriting what love looks like in her world. ..In a 2019 interview with The Sunday Times, Hollywood actor Joe Alwyn was asked about the experience of having some of pop sensation Taylor Swift’s biggest love songs inspired by him. His response was characteristically grounded and gentle. “No, not at all. No. It’s flattering,” he said with a calm smile..At the time, Taylor Swift had just released Lover, an album filled with romantic anthems like “London Boy” and “Cornelia Street”, both widely believed to be about Alwyn.Even on her previous record Reputation, songs such as “Call It What You Want” and “King of My Heart” hinted at their growing bond. Swift once described that era as one of emotional safety, telling fans she had found “stability” away from chaos.What made Joe Alwyn stand out during their six-year relationship was his ability to tune out the noise. He told The Times he simply ignored media speculation: “I don’t have any interest in tabloids. I know what I want to do, and that’s this, and that’s what I am doing.”Taylor Swift echoed that sentiment in an interview with The Guardian, explaining, “I’ve learned that if I do [discuss my relationship], people think it’s up for discussion, and our relationship isn’t up for discussion.”Today, as Swift navigates a far more public love story with Travis Kelce, one often unfolding under stadium lights and social media frenzy, some fans can’t help but look back at her time with Alwyn as the quiet before the storm.However, Taylor Swift has never looked happier than she does with Travis Kelce. Friends close to the couple say she’s “glowing” and genuinely enjoying a new sense of freedom she didn’t always have in past relationships. Unlike her quieter years with Joe Alwyn, Swift seems to thrive in this more public love story, cheering from VIP boxes, holding hands after games, and embracing the spotlight with confidence.Those close to her note that Kelce’s openness and playful energy have brought out her fun, carefree side, describing their bond as “easy, supportive, and real.” For Swift, this chapter feels less like hiding from fame and more like finally living out loud, on her own terms.Also Read: Plans for kids already in motion as Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce plan their 2026 nuptials Earlier in 2024, insiders told People that Joe Alwyn had turned the page on his relationship with Taylor Swift and begun seeing someone new. The sources added that the actor was content with where he was in life, balancing a healthy personal life with a strong professional focus. They also noted that Alwyn has always spoken respectfully about Swift, acknowledging that while he deeply cared for her, their relationship simply ran its course.","Joe Alwyn once called being Taylor Swift’s muse “flattering” Friends say Swift is glowing, embracing this new chapter with confidence and living her love story out loud, on her own terms.

Charlotte Hornets

LaMelo Ball’s availability remains uncertain

Latest Injury Update: Charlotte Hornets Monitoring LaMelo Ball Closely

LaMelo Ball’s Season Performance So Far

What It Means for Charlotte Hornets Fans

Themay have to make a crucial decision tonight asahead of their matchup against the New Orleans Pelicans. The 23-year-old guard has been dealing with a right ankle impingement that kept him out of Sunday’s game against the Utah Jazz. His recovery progress is being closely watched, and his presence - or absence - could play a major role in shaping the Hornets’ chances on the road.Ball’s injury has drawn significant attention given his importance to Charlotte’s offense. As one of the league’s premier playmakers, his ability to control tempo, create scoring opportunities, and rebound effectively makes him indispensable to the team’s success. The Hornets’ medical staff has listed him as questionable on the latest injury report released on November 4, 2025, indicating that his final game-time status will likely depend on how his ankle responds during pre-game warmups.The Charlotte Hornets confirmed that LaMelo Ball missed Sunday’s contest versus the Jazz due to his ongoing ankle issue, and while his condition has improved slightly, there’s still caution surrounding his return.He is listed as ""questionable"" for tonight's game vs the New Orleans Pelicans. The team’s official report categorized his status as questionable, suggesting that they’re weighing the risk of aggravating the injury against the need for his leadership on the court. Charlotte’s coaching staff has emphasized that Ball will undergo further evaluation before tip-off in New Orleans.The right ankle impingement has limited Ball’s ability to pivot and drive effectively - both critical parts of his dynamic playstyle. Although the Charlotte Hornets have managed without him in short stretches, his absence has been felt, especially in transition plays and late-game execution. Given how early it is in the season, the team is expected to prioritize long-term health over short-term gains, but a surprise return tonight remains a possibility if Ball clears medical checks.Before this setback, Ball had been delivering another impressive season, averaging 23.3 points, 9.8 assists, and 7.8 rebounds per game across six appearances. Those numbers highlight his all-around impact, not only as a scorer but also as a facilitator and rebounder. His chemistry with young teammates like Brandon Miller and Mark Williams has been a bright spot for the Charlotte Hornets’ developing offense.If he takes the court tonight, Ball could immediately tilt the momentum in Charlotte’s favor. His court vision and rebounding ability have been key to keeping the Hornets competitive, and his playmaking presence helps stretch defenses, giving shooters more open looks.Also read: Is Joel Embiid playing tonight vs the Chicago Bulls? Latest update on the Philadelphia 76ers star's injury report (November 4, 2025) With the Charlotte Hornets sitting at 3–4 and aiming to even their record, Ball’s availability could be the deciding factor in their performance against a Pelicans squad still searching for its first win of the season. Fans and bettors alike will be watching closely for the team’s final update before tip-off. While uncertainty lingers, optimism remains that LaMelo Ball may suit up tonight and continue his strong start to the 2025-26 campaign.","LaMelo Ball is listed as ""questionable"" for tonight's game vs the New Orleans Pelicans.

From gold medals to rival clubs, Jordyn Huitema’s heartfelt reaction shows the bond that still shines through

It’s a big win for Chicago — and an even bigger one for Canadian soccer star Julia Grosso. On Tuesday, the midfielder, who is also the girlfriend of Houston Astros shortstop Jeremy Peña, signed a long-term extension with Chicago Stars FC that will keep her with the club through the 2028 NWSL season. The team confirmed the news on Instagram, posting, “✶ From Canada, for Chicago ✶ Julia Grosso re-signs with Chicago Stars FC through 2028! "" Within hours, the announcement sparked a wave of reactions from across the sports world, including a warm and emotional response from Grosso’s Olympic teammate Jordyn Huitema — who happens to be dating Seattle Mariners outfielder Julio Rodríguez.Huitema quickly reshared the club’s post on her Instagram story, adding a heartfelt caption that fans couldn’t stop talking about. “She’s there to stay,” she wrote, followed by another line that said, “You’ve got a good one, Chicago,” tagging Grosso. The moment went viral within minutes, with fans praising the genuine friendship and sportsmanship between the two athletes, both of whom have balanced elite football careers with life alongside MLB superstars.Huitema’s reaction wasn’t just about club loyalty — it came from a place of shared triumph and years of mutual respect.The two have been inseparable teammates for years, first linking up as part of the Canadian women’s national team that captured the country’s first-ever gold medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. It was Grosso who etched her name into Canadian sports history that day, calmly converting the decisive penalty in the final against Sweden after a tense 1-1 draw through extra time.Huitema, a rising star then, played a crucial role in that same campaign, and their shared Olympic journey cemented a friendship that has lasted well beyond national duties. Today, even as they represent rival NWSL clubs — Huitema with Seattle Reign and Grosso with Chicago Stars — their support for one another remains strong and sincere, as reflected in Huitema’s viral post.For Chicago Stars FC, re-signing Grosso represents more than a simple extension — it’s a statement of intent. Since joining the club (then called the Chicago Red Stars) in 2024 after a successful stint with Juventus, Grosso has become the heartbeat of their midfield. Her composure under pressure, technical precision, and leadership have made her one of the most dependable players in the NWSL.Extending her contract through 2028 signals Chicago’s confidence in her as a foundational piece of their rebuild and future success. It also solidifies Grosso’s role as one of the league’s top international stars, bringing both experience and visibility to the franchise.Huitema’s message — “She’s there to stay” — summed up the sentiment perfectly. And as fans continue to celebrate the moment, it’s clear that this was more than a signing; it was a celebration of friendship, legacy, and belief that greatness lasts when built together.Also read: ""No fairytale ending"": George Springer’s wife Charlise breaks silence after Toronto Blue Jays’ devastating World Series loss","Julia Grosso has signed a long-term contract extension with Chicago Stars FC.

"Gisele Bündchen implied that prioritizing Tom Brady for years took a personal toll: “When you love someone, you don’t put them in jail”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/gisele-bndchen-implied-that-prioritizing-tom-brady-for-years-took-a-personal-toll-when-you-love-someone-you-dont-put-them-in-jail/articleshow/125033119.cms,"Supermodel Gisele Bündchen, in a candid interview, shared insights into her marriage with Tom Brady, describing their split as a 'death and rebirth.' She detailed her journey of shifting from supporting her partner's career to rediscovering her own dreams and defining personal success. Bündchen emphasizes her graciousness towards Brady, highlighting her focus on authenticity and fulfillment in her new chapter.

The shifting balance between support, career and self-fulfillment

Moving from high-stakes partnership to reinventing life on her own terms





In her March 2023 interview with Vanity Fair, supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, how their lives evolved, and what she discovered in the space that followed. While details of their split had played out in headlines, Bündchen offered fresh context and a more nuanced perspective.Bündchen admitted that “It’s like a death and a rebirth,” and described her own shift from supporting a partner’s career to rediscovering her personal dreams. Her reflections reveal not just a high-profile breakup, but a woman reclaiming her voice and defining success on her own terms.When Bündchen met Brady at age 26, she said she was “so ready” for family and partnership. Traditionally one of the world’s highest-earning models, she gradually scaled back her runway work after 2015 to support the family life they were building.Bündchen describes relocating to Tampa without ever having lived there before: “When we moved to Tampa, I actually had never been there before. I just arrived and that was my life.” Yet despite her enormous success, much of the public narrative painted her as “against football” or overshadowed by Brady’s career, a portrayal she calls “very hurtful” and “the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”She underscores that marriage didn’t unravel overnight. “That takes years to happen.” As she puts it: “Sometimes you grow together; sometimes you grow apart … When you love someone, you don’t put them in a jail and say, ‘You have to live this life.’ You set them free to be who they are.”Her message: supporting someone doesn’t mean losing yourself, and that truth became clearer to her as her kids grew and her dreams quietly changed.Today, Bündchen speaks of her next act in Costa Rica, building a home, raising her children, and exploring wellness and nature far from red carpets. She asserts, “I have my own dreams.”While Brady continued his historic career, Bündchen’s focus shifted inward. She embraced spiritual practices, daily rituals, and the idea that success is not just professional acclaim but authenticity and fulfillment. She says the breakup felt like both a loss and a liberation, “I believed in fairy tales when I was a kid. I think it’s beautiful to believe in that.”Bündchen's reflection on Brady is remarkably gracious. “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever … If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him.”In doing so, Bündchen rejects reductive headlines and stereotypes, choosing instead to present a fuller picture of love, change and self-discovery. As she said, “What’s been said is one piece of a much bigger puzzle. It’s not so black and white.”In the end, this isn’t a story solely of one of fashion’s biggest icons stepping aside. It’s the story of a woman stepping forward, redefining what a chapter ends and a new one begins.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s post divorce evolution raises question: did Tom Brady underestimate what letting her go would cost him?","Supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady.

How Stephen Curry became the final trigger that led to Steve Nash retire

Stephen Curry joined LeBron James and Steve Nash for the latest episode of their Mind the Game podcast, and it was an absolute hoot. From exchanging hilarious stories to showcasing the respect and admiration they have for each other, the episode gave fans a lot to cover. But one of the best bits came when Steve Nash revealed the reason behind his retirement from the game of basketball.Nash started his playing career with the Phoenix Suns back in 1996 - a team he played for the majority of his career. Then after 15 years, he left the playing cleats behind in 2015 after his last tenure - 4 years with the Los Angeles Lakers. Many believed it was due to his health issues, but as recently revealed by Nash himself - while they definitely did play a part, one major reason for his retirement was none other than Stephen Curry.Stephen Curry was 21 years old when he joined the NBA as a player for the Golden State Warriors back in 2009. But it wasn't until 2013-2014 that he finally came into his being, showcasing his talent on the court as one of the top players to ever grace the league. And it was in 2015, when Steve Nash retired after playing in the league for 15 years. He was already having some back and knee problems before his last season started, and during the Mind the Game episode, he reminisced about a preseason game when he and his LA Lakers team faced the Warriors with Curry running the game.""I'm guarding Steph... he's running everywhere, I'm like back is broke... I think it's time. If you can't beat 'em...""Nash spoke of how Curry's game style and the way he had the point guard running all over the court, and feeling like he was going to break his back, made him finally think that maybe it was time to consider the possibility of retirement. Bron could be heard cackling while Nash was making the admission, saying, ""I don't like to talk about this in public,"" to which the Lakers star said, ""We got a Mind the Game exclusive,"" in response.LeBron James had once said, during one such episode of Mind the Game, that Steph Curry was a player whose influence on the game has been one of the biggest on the game. He named Curry and Allen Iverson as two players who had the biggest impact on the game ever, since he started watching the game, which is high praise for the Warriors star. But who knew he was also the reason behind his friend and teammate retiring from the game as a player.Also Read: “I'm pulled in a lot of areas"": Stephen Curry’s heartfelt confession about striving to be a ""better husband"" resurfaces as Ayesha Curry faces heat","Stephen Curry joined LeBron James and Steve Nash for the latest episode of their Mind the Game podcast.

Arthur Kaliyev's off-ice narrative is turning into something that sounds more like a headline than a hockey statistics sheet. The Ottawa Senators forward is now caught in a several accusations that including gambling, deceit, and a confusing financial situation. His ex-girlfriend, model Lauren Mochen, told the New York Post that her three-year relationship with Kaliyev resulted in losses of over $50,000, leading to questions about the true extent of his issues.She talked about bounced checks, bank accounts that closed out of nowhere, and late-night calls that went from arguments to sheer desperation. Although the claims haven't been validated in court and no charges have been brought up, the pattern she outlines seems like a red flag. Issues like gambling, addiction, and financial problems aren't unfamiliar in professional sports, but the depth of her narrative, along with the surrounding silence, has changed one player's personal life into one of the league's most awkward subjects of discussion.Mochen stated that the more than $50,000 loss was part of a recurring issue connected to Kaliyev's gambling. She pointed out that he transitioned financial conversations to Snapchat to use disappearing messages and refused to watch anything but sports on TV, obsessively checking his phone and switching between games, as if he had bets on every result.She told Walker, “He behaved as if he had bets placed on every single game that was on my TV. He would sit there checking his phone, checking and flipping back and forth between games.”In October 2024, while they were in the process of opening a joint account at Chase Bank, a banker informed them that Kaliyev was banned from the main branches. This was due to someone using his Social Security number under his father Vadim Simakov's name to take out loans and credit cards. They opted to open an account at BMO instead, with assistance from Kaliyev's agent, Ian Pulver, to block his parents from accessing it.Kaliyev shared a screenshot showing transactions on sites like Crypto.com and FanDuel, along with an associate who was placing bets on his behalf. Mochen traced PayPal transfers back to Bovada, an offshore betting site that is illegal in the U.S. and California, where they lived most of the time.Mochen asserted that Kaliyev owed roughly $50,000 to his teammates on the Los Angeles Kings for various fines, fees, group bets, and pools, according to a text from his best buddy, Igor Larionov II, who referenced Kings defenseman Drew Doughty. Another player from the Kings confirmed via Snapchat that the debts were still there.In January 2024, just before his waiver, Kings GM Rob Blake held off on processing until Kaliyev cleared his outstanding trainer fees; Kaliyev texted Mochen on January 2, “Stuff like this makes me boil,” owing to cash shortages. Mochen supplied him with cash, channeled through her friend Krissy Spaulding, who confirmed the setup but noted that repayment never occurred. Kaliyev was also allegedly kept out of practice because of unpaid tips.According to Mochen, the discussions about gambling escalated quickly. Following his injury in February 2024, Kaliyev made threats of suicide during lengthy calls that lasted three hours. She and Larionov reached out to Pulver, who noted the possibility of NHL/NHLPA support on March 11, 2024.Mochen proposed the Player Assistance Program on March 14, but Kaliyev turned it down, “No, don’t even start with the program, don’t even start. Please. Just take off the board right now.” He supposedly made physical threats towards her during their arguments, “I’m going to end you, I’m going to hurt you,” though never acted on it.Mochen described the pattern to the Post, “Every single time I brought up gambling, it was a freak-out... He’s screaming at me, ‘I’m a scumbag, I’m f–ked up. He hopes I die. He hopes I get hit by a car.’ Over me just saying, ‘Do you gamble?’”The claims revolve around a scheme that Mochen says Kaliyev orchestrated in the summer of 2023, just about a month before a birthday trip to the Bahamas. Kaliyev supposedly told her he had ""accidentally"" taken money from her PayPal account to pay workers at his family's shipping company, and that his mother, Rumiya Kaliyev, had given him a $400 check to repay her. He sent her a photo of the check, which Mochen deposited via mobile. He claimed his bank account was frozen due to family issues and asked her to send him the $400 through Apple Cash, promising to pay her back shortly.Things got out of hand fast. In the following week, Kaliyev supposedly handed over more checks from the family business $1,500, two checks for $2,300 each, and another for $1,000 adding up to $7,500 and requested Mochen to deposit them and transfer the money online.When Mochen got to Miami for her vacation, she checked her bank account and discovered it was overdrawn by $7,000. Her bank reached out to her, saying the checks were fake and insisting on repayment to prevent her account from being closed.Mochen recounted the panic to the Post: “The bank calls me and says, ‘You cashed three fraudulent checks, who did these come from? Why did you do this?’ And right away, I panicked and was like, ‘No, no, no, I don’t know what’s going on.’ And I was like, ‘Can you guys double check? There’s just no way this is happening.’ The bank was like, ‘No, you need to pay the difference. Your account is negative, and once you do, we’re going to close your accounts. You can’t have an account with us anymore.’”Mochen accused Kaliyev of using her personal details and a different phone number to open another PayPal account, stealing an additional undisclosed sum beyond the $14,114.88 she had tracked from her original account. She provided evidence for her claims through bank statements, text messages, and PayPal records that were examined by the Post.Mochen reported an incident to the police in Saginaw Township, Michigan, concerning larceny tied to the fraud dispute. She told the Post that she is contemplating pressing charges, but as of November 3, 2025, no charges have been made.Also Read: Conor Geekie gets jumped by Hendrix Lapierre and Trevor van Riemsdyk as 3rd period brawl shakes up Capitals vs Lightning showdown","Arthur Kaliyev's ex-girlfriend traced over $50,000 lost through offshore betting links to Bovada, an offshore betting site that is illegal in the U.S. and California.

Australia has named uncapped opener Jake Weatherald in their 15-man squad for the first Ashes Test against England, along with Brendan Doggett and Sean Abbott as backup fast bowlers. The squad announcement came on Wednesday in Sydney, with Steve Smith set to captain in place of injured Pat Cummins for the series opener in Perth on November 21.The 31-year-old Weatherald could become Usman Khawaja's sixth opening partner since David Warner's retirement last year, following unsuccessful trials with Steve Smith, Nathan McSweeney, Sam Konstas, Travis Head, and Marnus Labuschagne.Chief selector George Bailey has not confirmed Weatherald's place in the starting eleven. ""No, not confirmed in the XI. Obviously we've got 14 of our 15-man squad playing round four (of the Sheffield Shield). Still some information to gather out of that. Cameron Green, being one, returning to the bowling crease, that'd be good,"" Bailey said.Cameron Green's bowling fitness remains a key consideration, having only bowled minimal overs since returning from back surgery 13 months ago.If Green can bowl sufficient overs, he will likely bat at number six, with Weatherald opening and Labuschagne at number three.The team might alternatively position Labuschagne to open with Khawaja, moving Green to number three and Beau Webster to sixth position if Green's bowling remains limited.""We are looking forward to the squad connecting and preparing in Perth leading on from a busy domestic and white ball schedule to kick off the Test summer,"" Bailey added.Regular captain Pat Cummins, who has been sidelined with a lower back injury since facing the West Indies, will travel with the squad to Perth and aims to return for the day-night second Test in Brisbane from December 4.Scott Boland will lead the pace attack alongside Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood in Cummins' absence.Spinner Nathan Lyon enters his 140th Test needing just two wickets to surpass Glenn McGrath and become the sixth-highest wicket-taker in Test history.The five-Test series will proceed from Perth to Brisbane, Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney.England, who managed a 2-2 draw in the 2023 home Ashes series, haven't won in Australia since 2010-2011.The Australian squad consists of Steve Smith (captain), Sean Abbott, Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Brendan Doggett, Cameron Green, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Starc, Jake Weatherald, and Beau Webster.",Jake Weatherald named in Australia's 15-man squad for first Ashes Test against England.

'Not on the same level with 1983': Sunil Gavaskar’s bold take on India women’s World Cup win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-womens-world-cup-2025/not-on-the-same-level-with-1983-sunil-gavaskars-bold-take-on-india-womens-world-cup-win/articleshow/125099462.cms,"Harmanpreet Kaur of India lifts the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup trophy (Photo by Pankaj Nangia/Getty Images)

India women's cricket team leave hotel, likely to meet PM Narendra Modi next

The Indian women’s cricket team finally had their fairytale moment when they beat South Africa by 52 runs in the final to lift the Women’s World Cup for the first time. After falling short twice in 2005 and 2017, Harmanpreet Kaur and her team rewrote history, ending years of heartbreak and bringing home the biggest prize in the game.The win sparked memories of India’s famous 1983 men’s World Cup victory under Kapil Dev, when a young team stunned the mighty West Indies. Many drew parallels between the two triumphs, but legendary opener Sunil Gavaskar believes the achievements, though both iconic, should not be seen on the same scale.Writing in his column for The Sportstar, Gavaskar said, “The win once again emphasised, if ever it was needed, that sporting intelligence wins trophies, not fancy degrees from universities. It also proves that it will invariably be Indian coaches who get the best results since they know the players – their strengths, weaknesses, and temperament – and understand the nuances of Indian cricket better than any foreigner, however accomplished he or she may be. ”Gavaskar went on to explain why he does not see the 2025 victory as identical to the men’s triumph in 1983. “There were some who tried to compare this win with the men’s team winning the World Cup in 1983.The men had never progressed beyond the group stage in earlier editions, and so everything from the knockout stage onward was new to them, while the women already had a better record, having been in two finals before this magnificent triumph. ”His point carried weight. While the 1983 team was a complete underdog, the Indian women had already shown their potential in global tournaments, reaching the ODI finals in 2005 and 2017 and the T20 World Cup final in 2020. Yet, Gavaskar acknowledged that Harmanpreet’s team had achieved something monumental.“Just as the '83 win galvanised Indian cricket and gave it a voice that was heard around the world, this victory will make the countries that started women’s cricket long before India did realise that their era of domination has been shaken. The ’83 win also encouraged parents of aspiring cricketers to let their children take up the game,” he added.Gavaskar further highlighted how this victory could change the landscape for women’s cricket in India. “Similarly, this win will give new wings to women’s cricket, bringing more girls into the game from the remotest parts of India. The WPL has already begun that process, as parents now see the sport as a genuine career option for their daughters and are more willing to support them.”While the men’s 1983 win created a cricketing revolution, Gavaskar believes Harmanpreet Kaur’s World Cup-winning side has lit a similar spark for women’s cricket in India, one that could inspire the next generation of young girls to pick up the bat and ball.","India women's cricket team won the Women's World Cup for the first time.

Honours and recognitions:

There are athletes who play the game, and then there are those who redefine it. Virat Kohli belongs to the second kind. As he turns 37, the boy from Delhi who once carried the hopes of a nation now represents a phenomenon that goes far beyond cricket. His story is no longer just about runs, records, or chases. It is about consistency, conviction, and a brand built on the same intensity and discipline that drive his trademark cover drives.From the streets of West Delhi to global arenas, Kohli ’s rise has been a masterclass in dedication.

NEW DELHI: Social media was abuzz with criticism after India's shocking four-run capitulation against England in their Women’s World Cup 2025 group-stage match. The hosts meekly surrendered despite needing 36 runs off 30 balls with six wickets in hand, crumbling to an all-too-familiar choke against Nat Sciver-Brunt’s side. The defeat brought back unpleasant memories of India’s loss in the 2017 World Cup final against the same opposition, where they lost their last seven wickets for 28 runs in 6.5 overs.Experts questioned the lack of intent, highlighting it as a major concern in case of a high-pressure face-off against big-hitting sides like Australia during the tournament’s knockouts. In stepped Richa Ghosh just when the Indian team needed a game-changer — during the semifinal against Australia and the final against South Africa — smashing the ball fearlessly on the biggest stage. The 22-year-old wicketkeeper-batter struck 26 off 16 balls in the semifinal, a knock comprising two fours and two sixes, helping the hosts gain a sizeable edge while chasing 339. Richa further stepped up in the final when the team needed big hits following the dismissals of Shafali Verma and Harmanpreet Kaur, scoring 34 off 24 balls, which included three fours and two sixes.While the Bengal cricketer’s heroics were on full display, what made the feats even more impressive was the pain barrier she pushed through to perform for the national team.Richa battled through a hairline fracture in the middle finger of her left hand, as revealed by Bengal fast-bowling coach Shib Shankar Paul, who has coached her since the age of 13.""Richa suffered a broken finger but smashed massive sixes despite that, which showcases her willpower. I told her, 'Don't get scared. All pain will go away, but the World Cup cannot get away from our grasp. Come back after winning the tournament.' She responded, 'Yes, I have lost out on an opportunity to win the World Cup in 2022. I have to pull it off this time,’"" said Paul in an exclusive interaction with TimesofIndia.com.Richa scored 235 runs in eight innings at an average of 39.16 during the recently concluded World Cup, with a strike rate of 133.52 — the highest in the tournament. The Bengal cricketer also led the way in hitting sixes, smashing 12 of them. Richa’s high-impact gameplay especially shone through in the group-stage match against eventual finalists South Africa, where she scored 94 off 77 balls in a knock comprising 11 fours and four sixes. This success has been the result of a fearless yet structured training programme, built on immense discipline and dietary control.""Richa started off as a big-hitting opener, but I told her to bat at number five and finish matches. She bats from morning till evening daily, facing 100–150 balls of each shot with a specific focus on power-hitting. The training sessions are conducted with boys. Richa doesn’t wear a thigh pad even if I ask her to, and she won’t leave the field despite an injury. She once hit a six during practice that shattered a car’s glass. I told the owner, 'Take a picture with her. You can share this incident after Richa helps India win the World Cup,’"" said Paul.Richa’s significant success has also stemmed from improved mental clarity about which deliveries to capitalise on. Her Siliguri-based former coach, Gopal Saha, highlighted a conversation following a T20 match that transformed her approach to shot selection. ""I told her to respect the good deliveries rather than attempting to hit every ball for a six. That conversation changed her mindset, making her more watchful while facing deliveries,"" said Saha.The 22-year-old big-hitting wicketkeeper-batter idolises MS Dhoni and has interacted with the legendary cricketer a few times. Former India captain Sourav Ganguly also guides Richa, urging Paul to focus on her fitness levels.""She is very particular about her diet and has stopped eating chocolates and outside food. Richa’s fitness levels have improved a lot. There’s a specific cook who prepares chicken when she comes for training sessions and avoids rice. Richa’s only indulgence is drinking tea. Being part of the Indian team has been a major game-changer in her fitness journey, providing clarity on the high standards necessary to stay in contention. Richa has faced a lot of struggle over the years, travelling from Siliguri to Kolkata frequently for practice sessions, despite coming from a financially modest family. Her ultimate goal is to play three more World Cups — which is definitely achievable,"" stated Paul.","Richa Ghosh scored 235 runs in eight innings at an average of 39.16 during the recently concluded World Cup.

Alex Vesia’s absence from Dodgers parade tied to private family matter



The Los Angeles Dodgers’ World Series victory parade on November 3 drew thousands of fans eager to celebrate the team’s second consecutive championship. Streets were filled with blue and white as players waved from open-top buses, marking another historic triumph for the franchise. Yet, one name was missing from the celebrations. It was relief pitcher Alex Vesia.Vesia, who has been a key contributor to the Dodgers’ bullpen, was notably absent from both the World Series and the parade. His absence was not due to injury or contract issues but something far more personal. In the days leading up to the Fall Classic, the Dodgers confirmed that Vesia and his wife, Kayla, were stepping away from baseball to handle a deeply personal family matter.The 29-year-old pitcher was last seen with the team during the National League Championship Series. Since then, he has remained out of the public eye as he and his wife face an undisclosed family situation. The Dodgers announced on October 23 that the couple would be taking time away, adding, “The entire Dodgers organization is sending our thoughts to the Vesia family, and we will provide an update at a later date.”Alex and Kayla had previously shared joyous news earlier this year when they announced they were expecting their first child, a baby girl.The couple, who often documented their journey on social media, have not posted since October 18 — the day after the Dodgers secured their World Series spot. Fans quickly noticed the silence, offering messages of love and support in the comments.During the World Series, the Dodgers’ clubhouse showed unwavering solidarity. Pitcher Will Klein told reporters, “We’ve all messaged him. We just want him to know that he’s in our hearts, and we did this all for him.” The team even found support from their rivals, as several Toronto Blue Jays pitchers honored Vesia by writing his number “51” on their caps.Dodgers manager Dave Roberts praised the tribute, calling it a reflection of “the brotherhood of athletes.” Kiké Hernández echoed that sentiment, saying, “For those guys to do that, it’s incredible. Regardless of what happens tonight, we appreciate what they did.”While Alex Vesia missed the parade but his absence was felt during the celebration.Also Read: ""No fairytale ending"": George Springer's wife Charlise breaks silence after Toronto Blue Jays' devastating World Series loss"," relief pitcher Alex Vesia was notably absent from the Los Angeles Dodgers' World Series victory parade.

Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin’s emotional connection runs deeper than hockey



More coverage on NHL:

For twenty years, Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin have been the heart and soul of the Pittsburgh Penguins. They’ve shared locker rooms, lifted three Stanley Cups, and faced the highs and lows of hockey side by side. Yet, despite their shared history, emotions rarely surface between the two publicly—until now.In a recent Amazon Prime feature promoting Monday Night Hockey, fans saw a rare glimpse into the deep personal bond that has defined one of the NHL ’s greatest duos.The feature peeled back the curtain on a relationship built on respect, trust, and quiet admiration. During the segment, Evgeni Malkin shared a touching detail about his home—he has nesting dolls of Crosby displayed proudly, a symbol of how much the Penguins’ captain means to him. When asked what Crosby represents to him and his family, Malkin offered a sentiment that instantly resonated with fans everywhere. He said, ""I hope my son thinks of him as family. I do.""It was a statement that silenced the room. For Crosby, who had no idea Malkin felt this way, the moment hit hard. The usually composed captain visibly fought back tears, reflecting just how much the words meant to him. It wasn’t just about hockey—it was about brotherhood.Two men from different worlds, united by the game they love, had built something that transcends ice and competition.Their journey began two decades ago when Crosby, the young phenom from Nova Scotia, waited eagerly for Malkin’s arrival from Magnitogorsk, Russia. He dreamed of greatness, and together, they achieved it—reviving a struggling franchise and etching their names into hockey history. They pushed each other not just to win but to become legends.As Malkin approaches free agency at the end of the season, fans can’t help but feel the weight of what could be their final year together. But no matter where their careers lead, Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin’s bond will forever stand as one of the most remarkable partnerships in NHL history—built on loyalty, respect, and genuine love beyond the rink.","Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin have been the heart and soul of the Pittsburgh Penguins.

The front office faces a defining decision - stick with its aging icon or build a new dynasty around Doncic, who looks to be entering his prime.Speculation surrounding a possible major trade has only grown louder after 11-year NBA veteran Austin Rivers publicly suggested that the Los Angeles Lakers should move on from LeBron and build around Doncic. His comments have fueled debate across the league, with some fans agreeing it’s time to plan for the future, while others argue that LeBron’s value on and off the court remains too great to walk away from.NBA veteran Austin Rivers recently voiced a controversial opinion that has sparked intense debate among fans and analysts. Speaking on his Off Guard with Austin Rivers podcast, Rivers suggested that the Los Angeles Lakers should move on from their legendary forward.“I would like to move off from this guy and, first off, I’m talking about LeBron,” Rivers said. “I think LeBron James is arguably one of the best players of all time. We don’t need to run through the resume.” (H/t: Sporting News)Austin Rivers emphasized that while James remains an incredible talent, the direction of the team should now be focused on Doncic.“I think for him to continue to do these things, he has to have the ball in his hands a lot. I don’t know if you’ve watched Luka (Doncic), I want the ball in that guy’s hands. I’m building for the future.”When Los Angeles acquired Doncic from the Dallas Mavericks back in February, it was viewed as a forward-thinking move. The 26-year-old superstar is entering his prime, and his dynamic playmaking has already reignited the Los Angeles Lakers’ offense. Meanwhile, LeBron James - now 40 years old and recovering from a sciatica issue - has yet to make his season debut.This situation raises tough questions about the team’s long-term strategy. While James’ resume and influence are undeniable, his age and physical limitations make him less central to the Los Angeles Lakers’ future. Austin Rivers went as far as to suggest that trading James could yield a strong return package.LeBron James currently has a contract valued at approximately $101 million, making any trade involving him a blockbuster by default. However, the Los Angeles Lakers would need to move quickly if they plan to execute such a deal before the 2025-26 trade deadline on February 5.If Los Angeles were to follow Austin Rivers’ recommendation, the franchise could target multiple young players or future draft capital in exchange for James’ services.Rivers also highlighted the business and branding element James brings to any franchise. “The business he brings in, the money, everything he brings in, I’m sure you could get two to three good players, young players for LeBron James,” he said.For the Los Angeles Lakers, the discussion isn’t just about basketball - it’s about identity. LeBron James has been the face of the franchise since 2018, leading the team to a championship in 2020 and cementing his legacy in Los Angeles. But with Doncic now in purple and gold, the organization could be envisioning a smooth transition into a new era.If the Lakers do decide to trade James, it would mark the end of one of the most iconic chapters in NBA history while officially passing the torch to Luka Doncic, a generational player ready to lead the next wave of Lakers basketball.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers predicted to cut ties with $33 Million guard to make room for roster upgrade ahead of deadline As of now, nothing is official. But with trade rumors heating up and the clock ticking toward February, it’s clear that the Los Angeles Lakers’ front office will soon have to decide between honoring the past and investing fully in the future.","NBA veteran Austin Rivers suggested that the Los Angeles Lakers should move on from LeBron James and build around Luka Doncic.

The Matchup: Golden State Warriors vs Phoenix Suns

Why Stephen Curry’s Presence Matters

What to Expect Tonight

The latest update as of November 4, 2025, brings relief and excitement forfans -The two-time MVP, who was notably absent from the Warriors’ injury report, is cleared and ready to return to the floor at the Chase Center. This update comes at a crucial time for the Warriors, who have struggled recently and are in dire need of a spark from their franchise cornerstone.Curry’s availability instantly changes the tone of tonight’s matchup. With his elite shooting and veteran leadership, his return adds momentum to a Warriors squad that’s eager to rebound from recent losses. The anticipation is palpable, as fans are ready to see the “Baby-Faced Assassin” light up the scoreboard once again - especially against a Suns team currently riding a two-game winning streak.Stephen Curry remains one of the most consistent offensive threats in the NBA, averaging 26.6 points per game this season along with 4.4 assists. His shooting accuracy has been remarkable, sitting at 46.5% from the field. Importantly, there are no current injuries impacting his performance or availability. This clean bill of health is good news for the Warriors, whose official injury list features Al Horford (left toe) and De’Anthony Melton (left ACL) as inactive for tonight’s contest.While those absences could test the Warriors’ depth, Curry’s presence ensures that Golden State will retain its offensive rhythm. His return signals confidence from the medical staff and reassurance for fans that he’s physically fit to lead the charge once again.The Golden State Warriors host the Phoenix Suns at the Chase Center in San Francisco, setting the stage for one of the night’s most intriguing NBA matchups. The Suns enter the contest in strong form, having secured back-to-back wins, while the Warriors aim to stop their skid and regain control of their season’s early momentum. Curry is expected to be a focal point of the game plan, especially from beyond the arc where he averages between 4.3 and 4.5 made three-pointers per game.For Phoenix, players like Devin Booker will pose a serious challenge defensively, but the Suns’ perimeter defenders must brace themselves for Curry’s quick release and off-ball movement. The battle between the two Western Conference contenders promises to deliver fireworks on both ends of the court.Having Stephen Curry back on the floor means much more than just scoring. His leadership, vision, and ability to create plays elevate the Warriors’ offensive tempo and overall morale. After consecutive losses, his presence alone injects renewed confidence into the locker room and the fan base. With the Western Conference standings tightening early in the season, every game counts - and having Curry healthy could make the difference in keeping the Warriors competitive.The Chase Center crowd will undoubtedly be buzzing with excitement.

Beyond his scoring, his chemistry with teammates like Klay Thompson and Draymond Green will be key in restoring balance and rhythm to Golden State’s attack.Also read: Phoenix Suns vs Golden State Warriors: Full injury report, who’s out, and Game Outlook (November 4, 2025) All signs point to an entertaining clash filled with highlight-reel moments.

Petition to replace Bad Bunny with George Strait at Super Bowl halftime surges past 100K signatures as culture war intensifies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/petition-to-replace-bad-bunny-with-george-strait-at-super-bowl-halftime-surges-past-100k-signatures-as-culture-war-intensifies/articleshow/125098999.cms,"The Super Bowl halftime show has ignited a cultural debate, with a petition to replace Bad Bunny with George Strait gaining traction. Critics argue the performance should embody tradition and family values, while supporters see it as a political statement. This controversy highlights a broader national discussion about identity and representation on a massive cultural stage.

The petition signals a deeper clash about identity, not just halftime playlists

More coverage on NFL by Barsha Dutta:

The Super Bowl halftime conversation, normally a celebration of spectacle and celebrity, has turned into something far heavier this year. What was supposed to be a slam–dunk entertainment moment in February has instead become a flashpoint for identity politics, generational divides, and arguments about what “American culture” even means in 2025.After Bad Bunny was officially announced as this season’s halftime performer, a petition demanding he be replaced by country legend George Strait cleared 100,000 signatures and that number is climbing by the day. What’s happening now isn’t just about musical preference. It’s become a referendum on who gets to define the biggest shared event in American pop culture, and who feels included, or even represented, on that stage.Critics argue this show should center nostalgia, patriotism and familiar tradition. In their petition, supporters claim, “The Super Bowl halftime show should unite our country, honor American culture, and remain family-friendly, not be turned into a political stunt,” before adding, “Bad Bunny represents none of these values; his drag performances and style are the opposite of what families expect on football's biggest stage. ”Political voices are now amplifying it. Donald Trump told Newsmax, “I don't know who he is.I don't know why they're doing it. It's, like, crazy. And then they blame it on some promoter they hired to pick up entertainment. I think it's absolutely ridiculous.”Yet the NFL hasn’t wavered. Commissioner Roger Goodell responded, reinforcing the league’s stance: “He's one of the leading and most popular entertainers in the world… We're confident it's going to be a great show. He understands the platform that he's on, and I think it's going to be exciting and a united moment.”And then there’s Turning Point USA, reportedly planning a competing event on the same day, which shows how this halftime debate has become weaponized far beyond fan forums.This isn’t a music argument anymore. It’s America arguing over who gets the mic, at the very center of the most-watched night of the year.","The Super Bowl halftime conversation has turned into something far heavier this year.

More coverage on NFL:

Kayla Nicole has just confessed what everyone knew: it was Taylor all along. After her Halloween costume and video went viral this weekend, the model and i nfl uencer admitted that behind all her efforts was a Taylor—but not the one everyone assumed. The revelation came after a weekend filled with online debates, Swiftie reactions, and speculation linking her video to her ex-boyfriend, NFL star Travis Kelce , and his fiancée, global superstar Taylor Swift Hours before Halloween, Nicole captivated her Instagram followers with a striking recreation of Toni Braxton’s iconic music video, “He Wasn’t Man Enough.” The production was polished, bold, and instantly controversial. Many viewers believed the post was a subtle jab at Kelce and Swift’s relationship. The lyrics—“Don’t you know that he was my man? / But I chose to let him go”—only fueled the fire. To the public, it seemed like a deliberate message aimed at the high-profile couple.Nicole decided to set the record straight during a recent episode of her Pre-Game podcast. “I had a white best friend. Her name was Taylor,” she said. “She had the only house I could go over to as a kid because my mom didn’t play those types of games.”She went on to describe a vivid memory from childhood: “I specifically remember driving home from private school in my uniform in the back of a paddy wagon with Taylor, and her mom was playing this song.”That, Nicole said, was the moment she realized, “Wow, white people listen to Black people’s music as well.”However, not everyone was convinced. The internet reacted swiftly, with many questioning whether Nicole’s explanation was genuine. One user commented, “Like, even if it’s true, some things are just better left unsaid, because it’s starting to feel like harassment.” Another wrote, “Even if she did have a friend named Taylor, that little anecdote had no relevance to anything.”Despite the backlash, Nicole received a surprising nod of approval from Toni Braxton herself, who praised the Halloween tribute. Still, the controversy overshadowed what could have been a pure creative homage.In the age of viral speculation, Nicole’s every move remains under a microscope—especially with Kelce and Swift’s relationship dominating pop culture headlines. Her Halloween post may have been inspired by nostalgia, but it reminded the world that in celebrity life, intention often takes a backseat to perception.","The model and i nfl uencer admitted that behind all her efforts was a Taylor.

Trevor Penning’s versatility instantly becomes the story in L.A

More coverage on NFL by Barsha Dutta:

The Los Angeles Chargers’ offensive line situation has shifted from “thin” to “emergency mode,” and this week’s Trevor Penning trade underscores how serious that reality has become. With both Joe Alt and Rashawn Slater sidelined for the season, the franchise had no choice but to find playable experience, not a developmental body and Penning fits that profile at a moment when the AFC West still feels wide open.The 26-year-old arrives from New Orleans in exchange for a 2027 sixth-round pick, pending his physical, and what matters far more than the low-cost compensation is that Penning has logged legit snaps at both tackle and guard. That flexibility is currency in November, especially for a team that has lost both bookends.Trevor Penning’s résumé is far more layered than just “first-round pick who never fully settled at one spot.” Yes, he was selected No. 19 overall in the 2022 NFL Draft, and yes, he’s played through different roles. But this specific moment in Chargers history isn’t about projection, it’s about survival.He has now played everywhere from left tackle to right tackle to left guard, with Pro Football Focus grading him as a legitimate run contributor, “allowed just one sack since Week 5” and a “70.1 PFF run blocking grade”.That alone makes him more valuable than the average midseason emergency trade acquisition.The Chargers need a lineman who can survive, right now, not three months from now.Depth matters even more because Trey Pipkins III, Austin Deculus and Jamare Salyer now have to operate in rotation rather than carrying full-time responsibility. Penning can be plugged in instantly and the tape suggests he won’t drown.In a league where late-season offensive line desperation usually comes with panic signings, Los Angeles instead bought versatility at bargain price. And that may be the difference between drifting into a wasted season, or staying breathing in the AFC picture long enough for December to still matter.","Trevor Penning's versatility instantly becomes the story in L.A.

Tom Brady dog cloning story stirs debate among fans and celebrities



More coverage on NFL:

With wealth, fame, and influence, Tom Brady has lived a life most can only dream of. But his latest revelation has left fans in disbelief. The NFL icon confirmed that his beloved dog Junie is actually a clone of his late dog Lua, who passed away in December 2023. The seven-time Super Bowl champion, known for defying age on the field, seems to have extended his winning streak into science — literally bringing his pet back to life.According to reports, Colossal Biosciences, a biotech company Brady has invested in, used blood that he collected before Lua’s death to clone her. “Tom Brady revealed that his current dog Junie is a clone of his late dog Lua, who died in December 2023, per @baileykrich 🤯,” Bleacher Report wrote on X. “The dogs were cloned by Colossal Biosciences, a biotech company that Brady is an investor in, using blood collected prior to Lua’s death. ” The revelation stunned fans, sparking both fascination and ethical debate across social media.While some found the news heartwarming, others were unsure what to make of it. Many fans joked that instead of cloning his dog, Brady should consider cloning himself to make an NFL comeback.After all, this is the man who seemingly fought off aging for two decades, dominating football well into his forties.Interestingly, Brady’s story even caught the attention of sports fans familiar with ESPN analyst Kirk Herbstreit, who lost his dog Ben to cancer last year. Some followers humorously pleaded that Herbstreit shouldn’t “see” the news, fearing he might be tempted to do the same.Cloning pets has long been a controversial subject. Once confined to science fiction, it now sits at the crossroads of emotion, technology, and ethics. Yet, it’s Brady’s name that has reignited this discussion for a new generation. Whether people see it as a touching tribute or a scientific overreach, one thing is certain — Tom Brady’s decision to clone his dog has once again made him the center of a debate no one saw coming.In the end, it’s not just about science or celebrity privilege. It’s about love, loss, and the extraordinary lengths one man went to keep a piece of his heart alive.","Tom Brady revealed that his dog Junie is a clone of his late dog Lua.

This low-key outing, captured by fans and highlighted by Donna's social media posts, showcases the Kelce family's authentic, consistent presence amidst their public lives. Their return to Disney emphasizes real-life moments over celebrity spectacle.

Donna Kelce’s sunrise clip becomes another subtle moment in the “Kelce family era”

More coverage on NFL by Barsha Dutta:

Jason Kelce may be retired, but his family calendar isn’t slowing down and fans are eating it up. Ahead of his 38th birthday on Nov. 5, the former Philadelphia Eagles center was spotted back at Walt Disney World with wife Kylie and mom Donna, continuing a pattern that feels less like a vacation and more like a Kelce family tradition.Over the weekend, guests in Magic Kingdom claimed they briefly crossed paths with the couple in Tomorrowland, grabbing snacks and browsing merch before moving along like any other parent with a stroller and a to-do list. For a family that’s lived half the last decade in headlines, from Jason’s documentary era, to Swift/Kelce family mashups, to the NFL goodbye, the image of this trio quietly roaming Orlando hits differently.This latest getaway gained momentum after Donna posted a peaceful sunrise clip from the Grand Floridian, writing: “Waking up overlooking [the] Magic Kingdom over the lake from the Grand Floridian… ahhhhh.” She zoomed in on Space Mountain and Tron, two details that Disney fans instantly knew meant she wasn’t exaggerating.Donna doesn’t have to address controversy or commentary (and there’s always some around a Kelce), she just posts what she sees and that subtle, steady presence has become part of why this family remains publicly likable in a celebrity climate that’s become hyper-performative.But this trip isn’t new and that’s the story that matters. The Kelces don’t treat Disney as a press moment. They simply keep going back. February. November. Pro Bowl years. Girls trips. Chip ‘n Dale. Elsa stop-ins. Matching ears. The pattern proves consistency and online consistency is authenticity.And that may be why fans still respond more to Jason and Kylie offline, even now, with their orbit permanently tied to the most dissected entertainment-sports crossover in the world, because their most viral moments still come from moments like this: Parents. A stroller. Magic Kingdom. A sunrise. A birthday week. Real life.","Jason Kelce, wife Kylie, and mother Donna were recently spotted at Walt Disney World.

Fans accuse Kayla Nicole of taking direct aim at Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce

More coverage on NFL by Barsha Dutta:

The internet doesn’t need much to explode when the names Travis Kelce Taylor Swift , and Kayla Nicole land in the same sentence, but this time, the gasoline was poured by Nicole herself. The former girlfriend of the Kansas City Chiefs tight end posted a Halloween video dressed as Toni Braxton and lip-syncing the iconic breakup anthem “He Wasn’t Man Enough.”Within minutes, Swift fans, already hypersensitive about anyone shading Taylor or Kelce’s engagement, framed the entire thing as a personal attack. And Kayla didn’t exactly pour water on the raging speculation either. On her “Pre-Game” podcast, she offered a childhood backstory that only made the controversy messier, more confusing, and far more viral.Kayla Nicole said the song was meaningful because she had a white childhood friend named Taylor who listened to it in the school pickup line, an explanation that Swift fans immediately labeled delusional. One tweet went straight for the jugular: “the white girl’s name was what now? this is mental illness and I’m being so serious. this woman needs an intervention from loved ones.” Another piled on by writing, “WHITE FRIEND NAMED TAYLOR. Oh she’s haunted.”Some fans didn’t bother softening anything at all. “She can’t go one second without embarrassing herself!!! Girl, you’re over 30… Go back to chasing rich men, it suits you better,” one critic blasted.And what really escalated everything wasn’t Kayla, but her own circle. Her choreographer, Shaun Andru, confirmed on TikTok that the post was a dig at Kelce and Swift. One of her close friends, Tatiana Elizabeth, also hinted the same.Meanwhile, Kelce and the Chiefs sit at 5-4 heading into a Week 10 BYE, with Kelce’s production still crucial for Kansas City’s playoff path. But for a few days, the internet didn’t care about numbers, touchdowns, or Denver. They cared about Toni Braxton and whether Kayla just used her to throw gasoline at Taylor Swift’s fan army.","Kayla Nicole's Halloween video, lip-syncing Toni Braxton's ""He Wasn't Man Enough,"" sparked accusations of a dig at Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift.

Hailee’s Beau Society not only saved her sanity — it unexpectedly became a window into her relationship with Josh Allen

More coverage on NFL by Barsha Dutta:

Hailee Steinfeld has lived the kind of life most actors dream about, Oscar-nominated as a teenager, multiple major film roles, an Emmy-recognized Marvel character, red carpets, brand power, global visibility, and now married to Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen. Yet in her newest interview, the actress admitted the one chapter she wasn’t prepared for was the 2023 SAG-AFTRA shutdown.While the world saw union negotiations, celebrity walkouts, and halted premieres, Steinfeld herself actually saw something more personal: a total creative freeze. With no sets to step onto and no roles to shape, she felt “lost,” stuck, and desperate for a new outlet. And that crisis became the seed of a new project, one that unexpectedly became a weekly publishing powerhouse.Hailee Steinfeld told Bustle, “I felt so lost and so creatively stunted. I needed something, a form of connection. What do I do?” That’s where Beau Society, her newsletter, was born. What started as a private outlet eventually exploded to nearly 87,000 weekly readers. She even told the outlet, “My creative drive is through my newsletter.”And because Beau Society isn’t filtered through talk shows or Hollywood PR, one of the most viral entries remains the intimate Q&A she did with Allen, including his now-famous retelling of her proposal-spoiling moment.Allen remembered her jumping on the bed one morning in Malibu and blurting out, “Can we get married already?! What are you waiting for?!”Allen laughed in response ,because, as he reminded her later in the newsletter, he was literally days away from proposing. The moment ultimately foreshadowed the real thing, he popped the question that November, and they officially tied the knot in California this year.","Hailee Steinfeld's newsletter, Beau Society, gained nearly 87,000 readers during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA shutdown.

Mitchell Robinson's involvement in trade rumors over the past few months has a purpose. The former second-round choice is a useful backup who knows how to position his body for both offensive and defensive rebounds. However, he has recently become a frontcourt presence plagued by injuries.Robinson has already been declared out for the New York Knicks ' next game against the Washington Wizards, meaning his injury problems will continue throughout the 2025–2026 season. Robinson is a game-time decision for Friday, according to coach Mike Brown. Brown recognizes the potential, even though the center's availability will probably continue to be a recurring part this season.Mitchell Robinson finally made his season debut on Friday night against the Chicago Bulls , which was fantastic news for the New York Knicks. Due to a left ankle injury, the center had missed the first four games. He is now ready to be back on the court, contributing to the improvement and strength of the Knicks defense.However, Robinson, who is still dealing with a sore ankle, might make his debut after practicing on Thursday for the first time since the regular season started. Talking about it, the coach said:“Mitch brings a lot to the table. Obviously, he hasn’t played in a while too.So he’s not going to be Mitch Robinson in the next five games probably, no matter when he plays or how much he plays..”He further said:“But his length, his versatility, in terms of being able to guard one through five, his ability to offensive rebound, defensive rebound, he just brings a lot to both ends of the floor. You get a vertical threat offensively and an anchor defensively, that it’s hard to replace because he’s a special player at that position.”Robinson had not exercised or played since the third preseason game, when he was inexplicably benched for ""left ankle injury management."" His ankle seems to be getting better enough for him to continue playing.He is labelled as questionable for today's game, but he should play 20 to 25 minutes against the Bulls. Whatever the cause, there has been a push for his comeback. A source claimed that Robinson even took part in the morning shootaround prior to Tuesday's Milwaukee game.At any point, getting Robinson back into the starting lineup would be considered a victory for New York. It doesn't, nonetheless, alter the truth that the team is reportedly getting tired of his injuries.In 13 minutes during Sunday's 128-116 victory over Chicago, Robinson recorded zero points (0-3 FG), five rebounds, one assist, and two blocks. His workload was extremely light on Sunday as the Knicks continued to exercise utmost care.Robinson's load management was the subject of numerous concerns prior to the season, and this seems like a problem for his team. His availability for the Wizards game on Monday is still up in the air.He has averaged 5.6 points and 8.5 rebounds in 2023–24 and 5.1 points and 5.9 rebounds in limited time last season. He also played in three preseason games with the Knicks this season. However, right now, he is in a precarious position.Also read: Tyrese Haliburton injury update: Indiana Pacers star's health status against Milwaukee Bucks revealed (11-03-2025)","Mitchell Robinson finally made his season debut on Friday night against the Chicago Bulls.

How new experiences and self-awareness unlock the brain’s creative power; Steve Jobs reveals



Practical steps to cultivate Steve Jobs’s success skill



Set clear, actionable goals: Writing down a specific goal increases accountability and focus. Jobs believed in clarity of purpose, which fuels direction and innovation.

Try something new regularly: Whether it’s learning a language, volunteering, or exploring a new hobby, novelty keeps the brain engaged.

Network beyond your circle: Talking to people from different backgrounds sparks new perspectives and ideas.

Reflect daily: Take 10 minutes each day to evaluate what you learned, what surprised you, and how it connects to your goals.

The visionary co-founder of Apple, Steve Jobs, over four decades ago, offered a timeless lesson about what truly sets successful people apart. During his 1982 speech at the Academy of Achievement , Jobs challenged the traditional definition of intelligence. He argued that being “smart” isn’t about how much you know or how quickly you think, but it’s about how you connect ideas that others overlook.Jobs believed that true intelligence lies in creativity and perception, not just raw intellect. The ability to connect seemingly unrelated experiences to generate new ideas, products, or perspectives defines innovation. His message still resonates today, especially in a world dominated by artificial intelligence and fast-paced technology, where the ability to think differently remains the ultimate advantage, inspiring individuals to embrace curiosity, challenge conventions, and blend art with science to create meaningful change.According to US Chamber of Commerce, in one of his most quoted reflections, Jobs said, “You have to not have the same bag of experiences as everyone else or else you’re going to make the same connections.” This simple yet powerful idea forms the core of creative problem-solving.Jobs explained that people who achieve remarkable success often do so because they have a wide variety of life experiences. These experiences, whether travelling, studying different disciplines, learning new skills, or meeting people from different cultures, act as raw material for innovative thinking.When faced with challenges, such individuals can draw from this mental library to approach problems in unique ways.This concept is sometimes referred to as “cross-disciplinary creativity,” the practice of borrowing ideas from different fields to create new solutions. Jobs himself applied this philosophy throughout his career. His interest in calligraphy, for example, inspired the elegant typography used in Apple’s early computers.Jobs once said that creativity is simply about connecting the dots but to have dots to connect, you must first collect them through diverse life experiences.Modern neuroscience supports Jobs’s belief that diverse experiences stimulate creative intelligence. When the brain encounters new information or environments, it forms new neural pathways. These pathways make it easier to see patterns, link ideas, and think abstractly.People who stay in repetitive routines often fall into mental rigidity, where their thinking becomes predictable and limited. By contrast, those who constantly learn, explore, and experiment develop cognitive flexibility, which enhances creativity and problem-solving abilities. Jobs’s message is therefore more relevant than ever in a rapidly changing world; those who explore beyond their comfort zones adapt faster and outperform those who stay static. Jobs’s approach to creativity also involved deep self-awareness. He understood that the mind’s default mode is to repeat familiar behaviours. To achieve breakthroughs, one must first recognise mental and behavioural patterns that prevent progress.This involves honest reflection: identifying procrastination, fear of failure, or reluctance to take risks. These are the habits that make individuals feel trapped in routine and unable to innovate. Recognising them requires stepping back taking time to observe your life from a distance rather than simply moving through it.In 2019 X (formerly Twitter) post, revealed how the success mantra lesson by Steve Jobs shaped and helped him as a life lesson.To master the skill Steve Jobs described, one must actively seek new and meaningful experiences. Small but consistent steps can reignite creativity and open new neural connections.","Jobs believed that true intelligence lies in creativity and perception, not just raw intellect.

India’s World Cup Win Fuels Plans for a Women’s TNPL,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/indias-world-cup-win-fuels-plans-for-a-womens-tnpl/articleshow/125100972.cms,"Over the past couple of years, women’s cricket in Tamil Nadu has been on the rise, and with the World Cup win, support is now tremendous.

India’s title win in the ICC Women’s World Cup is having a ripple effect here in Tamil Nadu, with news that a women’s edition of the Tamil Nadu Premier League ( TNPL ) may be launched in 2026.

India Women's cricketers to become CROREPATIS after World Cup win!





“It’s definitely under consideration,” said TJ Srinivasaraj, new president of the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA). “We plan to start with just four or six teams before we can expand it into a fullfledged TNPL event. It’s definitely on the cards.”Srinivasaraj added that to hold a player auction, at least 500 to 600 players of quality are needed. “But there is definitely enough to start with a four or six-team league. The sport is coming up in districts such as Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram as well.”U Bhagwandas Rao, TNCA secretary, said that there has been a call for a women’s league for a while now. “We were planning a launch this year, but it did not happen. Over the past couple of years, women’s cricket in Tamil Nadu has been on the rise, and with the World Cup win, support is now tremendous. We may even begin with just two teams, but we are looking to promote women’s cricket.” Srinivasaraj said that while there are about 150 men’s cricket clubs in Tamil Nadu, there are none for women. “Hopefully, that too will change.”Among those pushing for a women’s state league for the past couple of years is Sudha Shah, a former India cricketer and currently an apex council member of the BCCI . “I believe we have the potential for a full-fledged women’s TNPL much sooner than we think,” said Sudha, who lives in Chennai. The state association currently hosts the ‘Freyer Cup’ for women and under-16s, organised in partnership with Freyer International Logistics. The cup includes both one-day and T20 formats. “We have eight teams,” said Srinivasaraj.","Women’s cricket in Tamil Nadu has been on the rise, and with the World Cup win, support is now tremendous.
