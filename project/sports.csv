India and Australia are set to face each other in the Champions Trophy semi-final in Dubai on Tuesday, with India looking to overcome their historical struggles against Australia in knockout matches.Australia, despite missing key players Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, and Mitchell Starc, recently demonstrated their resilience by successfully chasing 352 runs against England in Lahore.India's last victory against Australia in an ICC knockout match was in the 2011 World Cup quarter-final. Since then, India have lost to Australia in the 2015 ODI World Cup semifinals, 2023 ODI World Cup final, and the 2023 World Test Championship final.The Indian team's strategy of including five spinners in their squad, initially criticised, has proven effective on Dubai's slow pitches.India's advantage stems from their experience playing all matches in Dubai and their ability to adapt their bowling approach to local conditions.The Indian spin quartet of Varun Chakravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, and Axar Patel claimed nine New Zealand wickets on Sunday, bowling 128 dot balls in 39 overs.Australia's spinning options are limited to Adam Zampa as their primary spinner, with Glenn Maxwell and Travis Head serving as part-time options.Matthew Short's withdrawal due to a calf injury has further reduced Australia's spinning alternatives.The Australian bowling unit has struggled recently, conceding 352 runs against England and 273 against Afghanistan.Australia's batting strength remains formidable, as evidenced by their recent successful chase of over 350 runs without significant contributions from Travis Head and Steve Smith. India will be particularly focused on dismissing Head early, given his recent success against them.The match presents an opportunity for India to overcome their recent loss to Australia in the 2023 World Cup final in Ahmedabad.The ICC Champions Trophy match between India and Australia will take place on Tuesday, March 4.The ICC Champions Trophy match between India and Australia will be played at Dubai International Stadium.The ICC Champions Trophy match between India and Australia is scheduled to begin at 2:30pm IST, with the toss at 2:00pm IST.The ICC Champions Trophy match between India and Australia will be broadcast on Star Sports Network and live-streamed on JioHotstar.The India vs Australia match will begin at 1pm in Dubai.Viewers in the USA can watch the upcoming India vs Australia Champions Trophy match on Fubo TV.Canadian cricket fans can access the crucial Group A encounter between India vs Australia through Fubo TV's service.You can follow live updates of the ICC Champions Trophy match between India and Australia on TimesofIndia.com.Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohd.

'Being attacked for no reason'

BJP’s hits back

NEW DELHI: Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed on late Sunday questioned the leadership of Indian men's national cricket team captain Rohit Sharma . Reacting to India's match against New Zealand in the ongoing Champions Trophy, Shama labelled Rohit ""fat"" and called him a ""mediocre captain"".""Rohit Sharma is fat for a sportsman! Needs to lose weight! And of course, the most unimpressive captain India has ever had!"" the Congress spokesperson wrote in a social media post. After facing backlash, the Congress leader deleted her post.She went further in another post, questioning Sharma’s abilities compared to past cricketing legends. ""What is so world-class about him when compared to his predecessors like Ganguly, Tendulkar, Dravid, Dhoni, Kohli, Kapil Dev, Shastri & the rest? He is a mediocre captain as well as a mediocre player who got lucky to be the captain of India.""Following the backlash, Shama defended her remarks questioning Rohit's decision to promote himself to the opening spot during India's Test match against Australia, a match that the Men in Blue ultimately lost.""Didn't he move KL Rahul to bat at number 3 at the MCG Test & put himself at number 1 which backfired totally ! Wasn't that a selfish move ? Because of that Shubam Gill was out of the XI . Didn't we lose the last World Cup which took place in Ahmedabad? I have compared him to our previous captains,"" she wrote in another post.Speaking to the news agency ANI, Shama clarified that her remarks were ""generic"" and were not intended to shame the captain of the Indian men's cricket team. Further defending her comments, she said that, in her opinion, ""sportspersons should be fit,"" and added that she was being ""attacked for no reason"" over her statements.""It was a generic tweet about the fitness of a sportsperson. It was not body-shaming. I always believed a sportsperson should be fit, and I felt he was a bit overweight, so I just tweeted about that,"" she said.""I have been attacked for no reason. When I compared him with previous captains, I put in a statement. I have the right. What is wrong in saying? It is a democracy,"" she added.BJP’s Shehzad Poonawalla was quick to respond, taking a dig at the Congress party's electoral failures. ""Those who have lost 90 elections under the captaincy of Rahul Gandhi are calling the captaincy of Rohit Sharma unimpressive!"" he remarked.Poonawalla also defended Sharma’s track record, referencing his recent achievements. ""I guess six ducks in Delhi and 90 election losses is impressive, but winning the T20 World Cup isn’t! Rohit has a brilliant track record as captain, by the way!""Meanwhile, on the field, India secured a crucial victory over New Zealand, winning by 44 runs to top Group A. Shreyas Iyer’s composed 79 and Varun Chakravarthy’s five-wicket haul helped India set up a semifinal clash against Australia in the Champions Trophy.","Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed questioned the leadership of Indian men's national cricket team captain Rohit Sharma.

Oscars 2025: Host Conan O'Brien gives Adam Sandler a hard time over his choice of outfit

Timothée Chalamet and Adam Sandler: A Knicks Bromance at the Oscars



“Chalamet!”

The 97th Academy Awards, hosted by Conan O’Brien, had all the usual glitz and glamour. Hollywood’s elite showed up in their finest, the red carpet brimming with designer gowns and sharp tuxedos. But then there was Adam Sandler , who, true to form, looked more ready for a pickup game than a black-tie event. In a sea of polished looks, Sandler’s laid-back vibe and unapologetic Knicks fandom were a refreshing twist, proving yet again why he’s one of Hollywood’s most relatable stars. Adam Sandler ’s love for the New York Knicks is no Hollywood act. He’s a real fan—the kind who can be spotted courtside at Madison Square Garden or shooting hoops at a neighborhood park. His passion for basketball is woven into his work, from his gritty role into his love letter to the sport in. And at the Oscars, he didn’t switch gears. He showed up in a teal Aviator Nation sweatshirt, baggy purple shorts, andCurry 11 sneakers—basically, classic Sandler.Host Conan O’Brien couldn’t resist ribbing him for it:he quipped, earning a big laugh from the audience.Sandler, as unbothered as ever, played along:he shot back, mock-offended and grinning.And of course, the Knicks love didn’t end with his outfit. At one point, Sandler even invited everyone to a midnight basketball game at Veteran Park. It was peak Sandler—equal parts comedy and genuine offer. He’s the kind of guy who might actually show up, sneakers in hand, ready to shoot around with whoever took him seriously.One of the night’s best moments came when Sandler spotted fellow Knicks fan Timothée Chalamet . Their friendship, built on a shared love of basketball, has been brewing for a while. Back in 2023, they even played a casual pickup game together. At the Oscars, Sandler’s loudshout across the room and the bear hug that followed were as real as it gets—just two guys, more pumped about hoops than Hollywood.Chalamet, always a fashion wildcard, showed up in a bold yellow suit. But when Sandler wrapped him in that hug, he could have just as easily been back in New York, two fans geeking out after a game. It was a raw, unfiltered moment in a night often built on polished performances—a reminder that, behind all the Hollywood magic, genuine friendships and real fandoms still thrive.Also Read: NBA fines Ja Morant $25K for tossing ball into stands during Memphis Grizzlies’ loss to New York Knicks Adam Sandler didn’t need to take home a trophy to steal the show at the 2025 Oscars. He brought humor, heart, and a slice of New York realness to the ceremony. In a room full of stars, his mix of casual charm and die-hard Knicks loyalty was a breath of fresh air. It wasn’t just the jokes or the outfit—it was the feeling that if you bumped into him on the street, he’d be the exact same guy. And that’s what made Sandler’s presence at the Oscars feel like a win—for him and for anyone who’s ever loved a team as much as he loves the Knicks.","Adam Sandler's love for the New York Knicks is no Hollywood act.

Edmonton Oilers Eye Game-Changing Trades Amid Playoff Race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/edmonton-oilers-eye-game-changing-trades-amid-playoff-race/articleshow/118712248.cms,"Images Via Getty Images

Alex Tuch: Edmonton’s Potential Game-Changer in Trade Talks

Shaking Ground with Evander Kane and Stuart Skinner

Although the Edmonton Oilers broke their five-game losing streak, the pressure to qualify for the playoffs is still high. On the verge of the NHL trade deadline , the team is exploring possible transactions to improve their lineup. The front office will likely make bold moves towards the playoffs supporting Connor McDavid as a leader on the ice. The coming few days could change everything for this team and their playoff path.While speaking of potential trades for the Oilers, Branden Escott alluded to this point: “I think [the #Oilers] are looking for a forward with speed and size…a D too…it’s dollar in, dollar out, but if they can create some cap room, we’ll see what else can happen here.” According to this statement, there is an ongoing rumor that a possible target for the Oilers might be Buffalo Sabres forward Alex Tuch.The forward leader for the Buffalo Sabres, Alex Tuch, has now risen to be possibly the hot commodity for trade relationships between the Oilers and the rest of the NHL. The 27-year-old winger has 22 goals and 24 assists in 58 games this year. His speed, size, and offensive prowess make him a perfect mix to go with either McDavid or Draisaitl. In another piece of a moving puzzle, Tuch has a history with the skinniest Oilers winger Jeff Skinner from their time together in Buffalo that could reunite.But making this move is going to be hard. Tuch, in fact, is in the final season of his seven-year deal, and the Oilers had to clear cap room to fit him in. If that were to happen, though, that could signal the type of playoff spark they were looking for.While some new names are likely to make their way onto the Oilers' roster, others are rumored to be on borrowed time. In fact, according to reports, the team is said to be exploring potential trading options for Evander Kane, who is dangling despite having a no-trade clause. He is one of the names said to be called into the new center. His injuries this season have not helped, meaning the Oilers have one of their tough decisions ahead of them.Another name circulating in the rumor mill is goaltender Stuart Skinner. Recent erratic performances have opened up the gates to Calvin Pickard, who came up big in a stellar performance versus the Hurricanes. Trading Skinner could clear up needed cap space for other Oilers' moves, allowing them to add both forwards and defensemen.Also Read: Are the Anaheim Ducks actually in the mix for Mikko Rantanen, or is this just deadline noise? The playoff lights are on, and the Oilers are at a crossroads. Connor McDavid's saber comments suggest either his disappointment or his hope that management will make the right moves. Be it Alex Tuch, Brock Nelson, or someone to fill the gap in defense, the Oilers have to act swiftly and efficiently to strengthen their lineup. The next couple of days might end up being a playoff decider, if not one that makes history- if not for the Oilers, then surely for playoff hockey. All eyes are on the Oilers now with the deadlines fast approaching, as fans pray for that piece that will finally tip the balance and allow Edmonton into a deep postseason run.",The Edmonton Oilers broke their five-game losing streak against the Hurricanes.

Taylor Swift is reportedly coming under more pressure to keep her personal life separate from her professional image. Some, according to insiders, think that her very public romance with Travis Kelce might be having a detrimental impact on her reputation. The debate was heightened after she received boos at the Super Bowl—a moment that some waved off as friendly ribbing, while others interpreted it as a sign that her involvement in the NFL universe isn't welcomed by everyone.Taylor Swift is said to be increasingly being urged to keep her personal and professional brands separate. Sources claim that certain advisers of hers are of the view that her celebrity romance with Travis Kelce might be damaging her carefully crafted persona.Disapproval mounted after she was booed at the Super Bowl, but others interpreted as definitive proof that her growing presence within the NFL community isn't for everyone. Since Swift is arguably one of the most powerful entities in the music industry, a few insiders fret that her visibility with the world of sports would bring unnecessary turmoil to her profession.At the same time, Travis Kelce is also receiving flak, especially from fans of the Kansas City Chiefs questioning if his priorities on football have been diluted. His disappointing outing in the last game of the season against the Philadelphia Eagles only added fuel to the fire, with some of them positing that his life outside the football field, including his relationship with Swift, might be affecting his performance.Once regarded as an untouchable leader on the field, Travis Kelce is now under scrutiny for possibly letting distractions interfere with his play. Since the couple continues to be in the spotlight, both Swift and Kelce find themselves at the center of discussions regarding whether their romanceTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce, formerly the epitome of power couples connecting music and sport, now face a reversal of public perception that could be hard to discount. Rumors of a possible wedding later in the year only served to heighten debate, with some industry sources warning that cross-pollinating their brands to such an extent might prove to have unforeseen effects. With the couple's relationship making up-page news every day, the test is to keep their romance alive while keeping their respective careers intact.“This whole situation is creating a weird tension between her and Travis, especially since this is their first real bump in the road,” a source told Radar Online. “Until now, it’s been nothing but good times! You can only imagine the awkward discussions happening behind the scenes about when it’s appropriate for them to be seen together and how they’re supposed to act. Definitely not the romantic vibe they were hoping for!”Also Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce losing their popularity as Super Bowl loss shifts spotlight away Taylor Swift has been pulled into a surprise legal battle with her close friends Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and former co-star of Lively's Justin Baldoni. Court papers indicate that Baldoni was pressured when Lively mentioned Swift and Reynolds as her ""dragons"" in a creative dispute over the It Ends With Us movie.Although Taylor Swift was reportedly not involved, her perceived power was being used as leverage. Fed up with the unwanted connection, she perceives it as a possible threat to her image. Consequently, part of the insiders is now calling on her to distance herself from Lively, just as she's being advised to do regarding her affair with Travis Kelce.",Taylor Swift is said to be increasingly being urged to keep her personal and professional brands separate.

NBA drama just hit a gut-wrenching plot twist. Forget reality TV feuds, this is a real-life sports soap opera, and it’s got us all reaching for the tissues. Imagine if a Marvel movie villain, say, a Thanos-level front office, decided to snap their fingers and erase all the good vibes. Well, that’s basically the Dallas Mavericks ’ season. And just when you thought the script couldn’t get any darker, Kyrie Irving goes down.In a moment that felt like a sports equivalent of a Red Wedding scene, Irving tore his ACL against the Kings, effectively writing him out of this season's narrative and likely a hefty chunk of the next. It’s a tragic pause button on what was shaping up to be a redemption arc worthy of a Rocky Balboa montage. But amidst the wreckage, a beacon of brotherhood shines through. Luka Doncic , the Slovenian sensation who’s basically the NBA’s equivalent of a perpetually online meme lord, took to Instagram to send a message of support. ""You will come back stronger mi hermano,"" Doncic posted, a simple yet powerful declaration of solidarity. Forget the trade rumors, forget the questionable roster decisions; this is pure, unadulterated sportsmanship, a moment that reminds us that even in the cutthroat world of professional basketball, human connections matter.ALSO READ: Did Luka Doncic Just Pull Off the Pettiest Delay of Game Ever? Here’s What Happened And let’s not forget, Irving was balling out. Before the injury, he was reminding everyone why he’s a walking highlight reel, a maestro of the hardwood. An All-Star return, nearly 25 points a night, and keeping the Mavericks ’ playoff dreams flickering like a neon sign in a Texas dust storm, he was doing it all. He was like the protagonist in a sports anime, finally unlocking his true potential, only to be sidelined by a cruel twist of fate. Now, his road to recovery will be long and arduous, a real-life training montage. But with friends like Doncic in his corner, and the unwavering support of fans, Irving will undoubtedly write his own comeback story.","NBA drama just hit a gut-wrenching plot twist.

The Milwaukee Bucks are cautiously optimistic as Giannis Antetokounmpo appears on the injury report ahead of their March 4 matchup against the Atlanta Hawks. The two-time MVP is listed as probable due to a calf issue, raising questions about his availability for the game at State Farm Arena. Giannis Antetokounmpo might be absent from the court tonight. If all things go well, we might see him play tonight against the Atlanta Hawks. Giannis’ potential absence would be a significant blow for the Bucks, who are already dealing with multiple injuries.

Despite these setbacks, the Bucks remain competitive, sitting at 34-25 in the Eastern Conference.The Hawks, on the other hand, are grappling with their own injury woes. Jalen Johnson and Kobe Bufkin are out for the season with shoulder injuries, while Larry Nance Jr. and Vit Krejci are sidelined with knee and back issues. Georges Niang is day-to-day due to illness. Atlanta, currently 28-33, will rely heavily on Trae Young, who leads the team with 23.6 points per game.Antetokounmpo’s impact on the Bucks cannot be overstated. He leads the team with 30.9 points and 12.1 rebounds per game, ranking second and fifth in the NBA, respectively. His presence on the court is crucial for Milwaukee’s offense, which averages 114.4 points per game. If he plays, the Bucks will look to exploit Atlanta’s defensive struggles; the Hawks allow 119.6 points per game, the fourth-worst in the league.The game tips off at 7:30 p.m. ET and will be broadcast on FDSSE and FDSWI. Fans can also stream the matchup on Fubo, though regional restrictions may apply.As the Bucks aim to solidify their playoff positioning, all eyes will be on Antetokounmpo’s status.

Auston Matthews’ “Poor” Performance Sparks Speculation Among Fans Regarding His “Decline”





Stay tuned for the IND vs AUS Live Score and follow real-time match updates. Get the latest Cricket Live Score and stay ahead with every ball.



Auston Matthews, one of the most talented players in the NHL and the captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs, has been in the centre of controversy as fans believe he has not been able to perform well in this season. Recently, hosts of Sportsnet’s Leafs Talk, JD Bunkis and Sam McKee, discussed about Auston Matthews’ performance, and fans have certain opinions about it.In the recent episode of Sportsnet’s Leafs Talk, JD Bunkis says, “The big thing for me in this game…a big takeaway..there is just something about Matthews’ body language that’s not there for me this year”. His co-host, Sam McKee, seems to agree with this and says, “Yeah we talk about this a lot…I’m out of theories”.JD Bunkis then does acknowledge how Auston Matthews is injured and that might play a big role in his “poor performance” this season but he also questions the reason for Auston Matthews to be playing if “he is that injured”.JD Bunkis says, “...the aura is not the same” and it seems like fans agree with this opinion.A fan wrote, “Body language is horrible. Showed up Nylander twice when he didn’t feed him on the PP. He’s barely bending his knees while skating and he’s just stick checking instead of taking the body. If this is what we’re gonna get come April, see you on the golf course May 8th.”Another fan wrote, “Look at all the different guesses in this thread as to what’s wrong with him. Could it be that we are seeing the decline of Matthews and it’s happening faster than we imagined? I really hope it’s just an off year but my guess is it’s not.

Seth Jones shines in Florida Panthers as a debut Panthers player

Seth Jones Traded To Florida Panthers In BLOCKBUSTER | Instant analysis

Seth Jones says, ""I wanted to play for a contender and Florida was obviously at the top of my list,""

Few Panthers know Jones better than Bobrovsky, who played alongside him in Columbus from 2015 to 2019

Seth Jones made an electrifying debut for the Florida Panthers , instantly proving why he was a key trade acquisition. While he impressed on the ice, the bigger question looms; when will star forward Matthew Tkachuk return to action? As the Panthers push forward without one of their biggest playmakers, Jones’ arrival couldn’t have come at a better time.In his debut, Jones logged nearly 23 minutes of ice time and came close to netting a goal in the Panthers’ hard-fought 2-1 victory over their in-state rival, the Tampa Bay Lightning .“He’s an unbelievable skater, a great guy,” said goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky, who made 28 saves to help extend Florida’s winning streak to four games. ""Played well both sides of the puck. I'm excited to have him. He's a great addition to our team.""While Jones made an immediate impact, the Panthers confirmed earlier Monday that Tkachuk has been placed on long-term injured reserve due to a lower-body injury. That means Florida’s star forward will be sidelined for several weeks, possibly until the postseason.""Matthew's going to be out for an extended period of time,"" Panthers general manager and president of hockey operations Bill Zito said at Jones’ introductory press conference. ""We hope to get him back for the playoffs. You have a projection, you have a diagnosis and a rehab course of action. How and where and in what manner is the progress of that rehab is yet to be determined."" (via: ESPN)Tkachuk’s absence is a tough setback for the Panthers, but the addition of Jones, an elite defenseman acquired in a weekend trade with the Chicago Blackhawks, brings a much-needed boost.""I wanted to play for a contender and Florida was obviously at the top of my list when it came to that,"" said Jones, who hasn't appeared in a playoff game since 2020. ""I want to fit in with this team, be a part of the system, come and bring my game, play hard defensively, help a little bit offensively, really just fit into the system and bring what I can, whatever's asked of me.""Panthers fans embraced Jones before he even hit the ice, giving him a roaring ovation when he was introduced in the starting lineup at Amerant Bank Arena. The excitement only grew when he nearly scored in the second period.Initially, the plan was to ease Jones into the lineup as he adjusted to a new system and conference. But in a heated matchup against a bitter rival, he found himself in key moments, particularly on special teams, helping Florida successfully kill off seven penalties.“He’s going to be really good for us,” head coach Paul Maurice said. ""Moves the puck clean, and he's got a set of hands on him. So I thought for flying in yesterday to get here, and then everything [being] brand new, mostly he's playing on instinct out there. ... I was really pleased.""""He still was amazing,"" Bobrovsky said. ""And, you know, he was an amazing skater. He was smart. It was a privilege to play with him. And I'm so, so happy to reunite with him again.""The Panthers also made another move between the pipes. With Spencer Knight sent to Chicago in the Jones trade, Florida recalled veteran goaltender Chris Driedger from their AHL affiliate. The 30-year-old brings NHL experience, including 31 career wins, and now serves as Bobrovsky’s backup moving forward.","Seth Jones made an electrifying debut for the Florida Panthers.

The Philadelphia Eagles are making major changes to their secondary, signaling a shift in their defensive approach. According to multiple reports, the team is releasing veteran cornerback James Bradberry. The move comes after a disappointing 2024 season, during which Bradberry was sidelined due to injury. Now fully recovered, the 31-year-old is eager to return to the field in 2025. Meanwhile, more changes in the Eagles' defensive backfield appear to be on the horizon.Bradberry will be designated as a post-June 1 release, a decision that will save the Eagles $2.1 million in cap space for the 2025 season. The veteran corner suffered a torn Achilles during a preseason practice, forcing him to miss the entire 2024 campaign. Despite this setback, Bradberry recently confirmed that he has fully recovered and is determined to play cornerback next season.Before his injury, Bradberry was a key figure in Philadelphia’s defense. In 2023, he played a pivotal role in the secondary, recording 13 passes defensed, one interception, and a fumble recovery while starting all 16 games. His experience and skill set made him a valuable asset, but with the Eagles looking to retool their roster, the decision was made to move on.Bradberry isn’t the only veteran defensive back on his way out. Reports from Monday indicate that longtime cornerback Darius Slay is also expected to be released in the coming days. Slay has been a cornerstone of the Eagles' secondary since joining the team in 2020, and his potential departure further underscores Philadelphia’s commitment to reshaping its defense.The Eagles’ secondary struggled at times during the 2023 season, and injuries played a major role in the unit’s inconsistency. Now, the front office appears focused on revamping the defensive backfield with younger, fresher talent. With free agency and the 2025 NFL Draft approaching, Philadelphia will likely target new additions to fill the void left by Bradberry and Slay.Also Read: Throwback: When Charissa Thompson took a bold stand on marriage and motherhood and how Kylie Kelce reacted With two experienced cornerbacks potentially leaving, the Eagles must find reliable replacements to maintain competitiveness in 2025.

Ottawa Senators captain Brady Tkachuk is making headlines again — but this time, it’s not for dropping gloves or scoring clutch goals. The fiery forward found himself at the center of a heated off-ice moment after fans at the Canadian Tire Centre booed the American national anthem on Saturday, March 2, 2025, ahead of the Senators' 5–3 win over the San Jose Sharks .While the Senators celebrated a solid victory, the crowd's reaction to ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" struck a nerve with Brady Tkachuk — an American who recently shined for Team USA at the 4 Nations Face-Off . The boos didn't sit well with the captain, whose frustration was clear as he skated onto the ice.Former NHLer and ""Spittin' Chiclets"" co-host Ryan Whitney didn't hold back his thoughts on the incident. He took to X (formerly Twitter) to deliver a blunt message to the Ottawa fanbase:Whitney posted, suggesting that continued disrespect for the US anthem could push Brady Tkachuk to reconsider his future with the team.This isn’t the first time fans have jeered anthems at NHL games. The back-and-forth between Canadian and American crowds has become a growing trend. Just last week, boos echoed through Madison Square Garden during the Canadian anthem before the New York Rangers faced off against the Toronto Maple Leafs.Many believe these displays are fueled by ongoing geopolitical tensions between the two countries — a rivalry that seems to be spilling over onto the ice.Brady Tkachuk's reaction is hardly surprising given his recent success with Team USA. He played a pivotal role in their journey to the 4 Nations Face-Off final, reinforcing his pride in representing his country.However, the star forward’s heart remains with the Ottawa Senators, a team he’s fiercely loyal to both on and off the ice. His spirited play, whether through scoring goals or standing up for his teammates — as seen in his recent fight against Tom Wilson — proves his commitment to the Sens.Despite the off-ice controversy, Brady Tkachuk remains focused on the Senators’ playoff push. Ottawa currently sits just one point shy of a wild card spot in the Eastern Conference. Their next challenge? A matchup against the Chicago Blackhawks on Wednesday — a crucial game as they battle to secure a postseason berth.As for the anthem drama, it’s clear Tkachuk won’t let the noise in the stands distract him from his mission. But Ryan Whitney’s warning lingers — will Senators fans dial it back, or will the tension between the crowd and their captain continue to simmer?One thing's for sure: Brady Tkachuk's fire — both on and off the ice — is keeping everyone on their toes.Also read - Brady Tkachuk's Net Worth in 2025: NHL Contract, Endorsements, and Career Earnings","Brady Tkachuk is the captain of the Ottawa Senators.

NFL legend Rob Gronkowski backed Burrow over Patrick Mahomes for the All-Dude First Team QB, although Julian Edelman eventually kept Mahomes as the Second-Team QB.

Joe Burrow Gets the Nod Over Patrick Mahomes as Rob Gronkowski’s ‘All-Dude’ First Team QB



Gronk & Jules All-Dude Team: Quarterbacks | Dudes on Dudes

Joe Burrow 's 2024 season might not have dominated the headlines like those of Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, and Patrick Mahomes , but his individual brilliance was undeniable. Despite putting up All-Pro-worthy numbers, Burrow's efforts largely went unnoticed due to the Cincinnati Bengals missing the playoffs with a 9-8 record. However, his statistical achievements—4,918 passing yards, 43 touchdowns, nine interceptions, a 70.6% completion rate, and a 108.5 passer rating—paint a different picture. While accolades such as the Comeback Player of the Year award and a Pro Bowl nod came his way, many believe he was deserving of even higher recognition.One of his biggest supporters in this debate is NFL legend Rob Gronkowski, who firmly backed Joe Burrow over Patrick Mahomes for his All-Dude First Team. During the latest episode of the Dudes on Dudes podcast, Gronk and Julian Edelman played the role of general managers, drafting their own First and Second Team All-Dude offenses. While Edelman initially leaned toward Mahomes for First-Team QB, Gronk passionately disagreed.“I’m going to put Joe Burrow as the First Teamer here in this situation. That guy balled out for the Cincinnati Bengals this year. I know they didn’t make the playoffs but that doesn’t matter. He balled like he was a First-Team All-Pro guy. He came through,” Gronkowski said.His argument was convincing enough for Edelman to change his mind, ultimately naming Burrow the First-Team QB over Mahomes. The former Patriots wideout acknowledged that Burrow’s numbers were elite, especially for a quarterback whose team failed to reach the postseason. However, when it came to the Second-Team selection, Edelman stood firm, keeping Mahomes in that spot despite Gronk’s consideration of another MVP-level QB, Josh Allen.Mahomes, by contrast, had a statistically underwhelming year compared to his previous seasons, finishing with 3,928 passing yards, 26 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. However, he showcased his signature ability to adapt and lead the Chiefs to a dominant 15-2 record, proving that numbers don’t always tell the full story. Edelman emphasized Mahomes’ postseason brilliance, citing his ability to step up when it mattered most, as the key reason for keeping him in the Second-Team QB spot over Allen.Even though Allen secured his first MVP award with 4,300 total yards, 40 touchdowns, and just eight turnovers while carrying a depleted Bills roster to a 13-4 finish, his postseason shortcomings played a major role in his omission from Edelman and Gronkowski’s rankings. “Ya, Patrick Mahomes Second-Team for sure. What about Josh Allen though? He was the MVP of the league,” Gronk asked, only to see Edelman stick with his choice.Also Read: Travis Kelce's decision of playing his 13th season next year might affect his future with Taylor Swift The debate over Joe Burrow’s exclusion from AP First-Team and Second-Team All-Pro honors remains open. With numbers that outshone Mahomes’ and a season that deserved more acclaim, it’s fair to ask whether postseason performance should dictate All-Pro selections—or if individual excellence should be the deciding factor.",NFL legend Rob Gronkowski backed Joe Burrow over Patrick Mahomes for the All- Dude First Team QB. Julian Edelman eventually kept Mahomes as the Second-Team QB. Burrow's exclusion from AP All-Pro honors remains debatable.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118665916,imgsize-69620,width-400,resizemode-4/118665916.jpg"

When and where to watch the Golden State Warriors play against the New York Knicks tonight (March 4, 2025)?

The Golden State Warriors face a critical matchup against the New York Knicks on Tuesday, March 4, at Madison Square Garden, but all eyes are on Stephen Curry ’s status as the team navigates injury concerns. The Warriors’ injury report lists Curry as day-to-day with an undisclosed issue, raising questions about his availability for the high-stakes game.Stephen Curry, the Golden State Warriors’ leading scorer and one of the NBA’s most prolific three-point shooters has been instrumental in keeping Golden State competitive this season. Averaging 24.5 points, 3.3 rebounds, and 6.1 assists over the last 20 games, his presence on the court is vital for the Warriors’ success. However, his day-to-day designation leaves fans and analysts speculating about his potential absence and its impact on the team’s performance.The Golden State Warriors ’ injury report also includes Gary Payton II (day-to-day, nose) and Jonathan Kuminga (day-to-day, ankle), further complicating their lineup decisions. Payton’s defensive versatility and Kuminga’s athleticism are key components of Golden State’s rotation, and their potential absences could stretch the team’s depth.On the other side, the Knicks are dealing with their own injury challenges. Karl-Anthony Towns is listed as questionable due to personal reasons, while Ariel Hukporti remains out with a knee injury. Despite these setbacks, New York boasts a strong roster led by Jalen Brunson, who averages 27.3 points over the last 20 games, and Towns, who contributes 19.1 points and 13.4 rebounds per game.The Warriors, currently 33-28, are fighting to secure a playoff spot in a tightly contested Western Conference. Stephen Curry’s availability could be the deciding factor in this crucial game. Golden State averages 113.1 points per game, ranking 15th in the league, but their defense, allowing 111.2 points per contest (ninth in the NBA), has been a bright spot.Also read: Will Jimmy Butler play tonight against the New York Knicks?

Fans Can’t Believe What Luka Doncic Did Before Tossing the Ball to the Referee

NBA 's latest episode of ""As the Basketball Turns"" is serving up drama hotter than a Steph Curry three-pointer from the logo. Forget Succession, this is real-life court-side theater! We've got Luka Doncic channeling his inner slime monster, LeBron James inching closer to a milestone that'll have historians dusting off their ""GOAT"" encyclopedias, and the Lakers climbing the Western Conference like they're auditioning for a Mission: Impossible sequel.Let's start with the sweat-soaked elephant in the room: Luka Doncic. During a heated clash with the Clippers , amidst the tension of James Harden's free throws, our Slovenian sensation decided to give the basketball a… personal touch. Picture this: Harden's at the line, the ball finds its way to Luka, and instead of a casual toss back to the ref, he proceeds to give it a full-on, sweaty massage. It wasn't just a dab, folks, it was a full-blown, ""I just ran a marathon in a sauna"" level of moisture transfer. The female referee's reaction? Priceless. A mix of shock, disgust, and ""Did I just witness that?"" could rival any meme-worthy moment. The result? A delay of game warning, and social media exploding with debates about sportsmanship, hygiene, and whether Luka's channeling his inner Space Jam Monster.A fan said, ""Lmao no wonder Tom Brady said NBA players have it easy. Can't even sweat on the ball. Meanwhile receivers literarily spit on their gloves for extra grip,"" while another wrote, ""She ain’t emotional. That shit is just disrespectful and dirty as f**k. Somebody would whoop yo ass doing that in a pick up game."" A fan noted, ""So everyone who is saying players do this to the ball all the time. Show me one clip where they did it to the degree that Luka did? Yes, players do certain things subtly. But not to this degree.."" A fan commented, ""😂😂😂😂 that was disrespectful… Luka wanted the ball to go to Harden.""Meanwhile, in the land of Lakers, something special is brewing. Despite a roster looking more like a medical chart than a starting lineup, they're surging. Dalton Knecht's stepping up, LeBron's defying Father Time, and they've just delivered a double whammy to their city rivals. And speaking of LeBron, he's now a single point away from 50,000 combined career points, a feat so monumental, that it's like watching a real-life superhero level up. It's the kind of achievement that makes you wonder if he's secretly powered by kryptonite-infused Gatorade.ALSO READ: How Is 40-Year-Old LeBron James Outperforming His Prime?

Forget the multiverse of madness, we're living in the ""LeBron-verse"" right now, and it's absolutely bonkers. It's like watching Thanos snap his fingers, but instead of half the universe disappearing, LeBron's age does. We're talking about a 40-year-old dude defying gravity and Father Time like he's got cheat codes straight from the Space Jam sequel. Seriously, is he powered by the secret stuff from Lola Bunny's water bottle?Let's rewind to LeBron's ""prime,"" the 2012-13 season. Picture this: a young King James, a basketball deity, dropping 26.8 points, shooting 51% from the field, 35% from downtown, grabbing 7.5 boards, and dishing 7.4 assists. Now, fast forward to LeBron, pushing 40, and he's basically saying, ""Hold my Gatorade."" He's averaging 26.5 points, nailing 55% of his shots, splashing 43% of his threes, pulling down 8.3 rebounds, and dropping 8.1 assists. It's like he's aged backward, Benjamin Button style, but with more dunks and fewer diaper changes.But wait, there's more! LeBron is now a single point away from a milestone so monumental, it might as well be carved onto Mount Olympus. We're talking 50,000 career points, combining regular season and playoff totals. He nearly hit it against the Clippers, battling through a depleted Lakers lineup. Sure, he went 6-of-17, but that clutch three-pointer? Pure LeBron magic. He's already the NBA's all-time leading scorer, surpassing Kareem, and the playoff points king, leaving Jordan in his dust.ALSO READ: Los Angeles Lakers Move to No. 2 in West: JJ Redick Issues Strong Statement This isn't just about stats, though.

He's not just playing; he's rewriting the rules of aging in the NBA. He's showing us that even at 40, you can still drop bombs, grab boards, and run the show like you own the place.

LaMelo Ball’s Time in Charlotte Coming to an End? Here’s What We Know



Stay tuned for the IND vs AUS Live Score and follow real-time match updates. Get the latest Cricket Live Score and stay ahead with every ball.



Charlotte Hornets fans, grab your popcorn and your conspiracy theory bingo cards, because the LaMelo Ball saga is heating up faster than a trending TikTok dance challenge. Is he staying? Is he going? Are we entering the Succession of NBA trades? The buzz is louder than a Taylor Swift surprise album drop, and everyone's got an opinion. Forget Ted Lasso, this is real-life drama, folks.According to hoopshype , the whispers are getting louder: LaMelo Ball’s name is likely to be swirling in trade rumors come offseason. It’s a bit like when your favorite superhero gets a villainous twist: shocking, but potentially inevitable. Remember when the Dallas Mavericks, like a jilted lover, moved on from Luka Doncic due to concerns about his conditioning and injury history? Well, Ball’s injury record is starting to look like a Game of Thrones character list, long and complicated. And just like those plot twists, Charlotte might be ready to pivot. Fourteen wins in 60 games? Ouch. Ball, despite his flashy passes and highlight-reel plays, hasn’t exactly been a winning elixir. One winning season in five? That’s less Space Jam and more Space Jam 2, a bit of a letdown. And with Hornets GM Jeff Peterson already showing he's not afraid to shake things up (remember the Mark Williams near-Lakers deal, a plot twist worthy of a soap opera?), the writing might be on the wall.Ball’s availability is the elephant in the room. In today's NBA, durability is king, and he's only crossed the 60-game mark once. Selling high while the stock is still hot? It's a tempting move. A 23-year-old, 6'7"" point guard with elite playmaking? That’s a trade asset that could make any GM’s eyes light up.If Ball is traded, it’s a domino effect. Suddenly, everyone's on the table. Mark Williams could find himself back in the trade spotlight, and Miles Bridges, who’s been shining in Brandon Miller's absence, could be a hot commodity for contenders. Essentially, everyone except maybe Miller could be on the block. The Hornets could then build around Miller, a two-way wing with serious potential. A retooling rather than a rebuild. The assets gained could fill the gaps, and the NBA Draft could bring in fresh talent. It's time to act, not wait, like a Netflix binge-watcher diving into a new series.ALSO READ: New Orleans Pelicans vs Los Angeles Lakers Game Preview (04/03): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and More Potential landing spots are already being whispered about. If the Hornets don’t see Ball as a winning piece, a trade makes sense. But, they could also stick with the young core, add some veteran leadership, and hope for a playoff push. After all, Bridges is only 26. Look at the Detroit Pistons, adding veterans to their young core, and seemingly setting themselves for the playoffs. Will Peterson be patient, or will he hit the reset button? Only time, and a few more trade rumors, will tell.","LaMelo Ball's injury record is starting to look like a Game of Thrones character list.

The Cleveland Cavaliers (50-10) are set to face the Chicago Bulls (24-37) at the United Center on Tuesday, March 4, at 8 p.m. ET, with both teams navigating significant injury concerns. While the Bulls have seven players on their injury report, the Cavaliers’ injury list remains relatively light, with star guard Donovan Mitchell fully available to play. Donovan Mitchell , who has been a cornerstone for the Cavaliers this season, continues to deliver stellar performances. Over the last 20 games, he has averaged 24.8 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game, solidifying his role as the team’s leading scorer. His ability to knock down 3.6 three-pointers per game, ranking fourth in the NBA, has been crucial for Cleveland’s offensive success.The Cavaliers’ only injury concern is Evan Mobley, who is listed as out for rest. Mobley’s absence is a strategic move by the team to manage his workload, especially with the playoffs approaching. Despite this, Cleveland remains a dominant force, averaging 123.1 points per game, the second-highest in the league, while holding opponents to 111.6 points per game.On the other side, the Bulls are grappling with a lengthy injury report. Key players like Patrick Williams (knee), Ayo Dosunmu (shoulder), and Nikola Vucevic (calf) are ruled out, while Josh Giddey (quadricep) is listed as questionable. Giddey’s potential absence would be a significant blow, as he has been a consistent contributor with averages of 16.2 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 6.4 assists over the last 20 games.The Bulls’ leading scorer, Coby White, is probable despite a thumb injury. White, averaging 18.3 points per game, will need to step up if Chicago hopes to compete against the Cavaliers’ high-powered offense.As the Cavaliers aim to extend their impressive season, Donovan Mitchell’s availability provides a significant boost.

NEW DELHI: Loaded with world-class talent but often labeled as underachievers in major ICC events, New Zealand and South Africa will face off in an evenly-matched second semifinal of the Champions Trophy in Lahore on Wednesday.Both teams have won the tournament once, with South Africa emerging victorious in 1998 and New Zealand in 2000, when it was known as the ICC Knockout Trophy.While South Africa aims to shed their ""chokers"" tag in big tournaments, the Kiwis are equally desperate to claim a major title after finishing as runners-up twice in the ODI World Cup (2015 and 2019) and once in the T20 World Cup (2021).Led by Mitchell Santner, New Zealand finished second in Group A, while South Africa topped Group B ahead of Australia.The two sides are evenly matched in most departments, but South Africa hold a slight edge in bowling due to their variety. Both teams boast formidable batting lineups and quality fielders, but the contest is expected to be decided by the spinners on the slower pitches in Lahore.New Zealand will draw confidence from their recent tri-series win over South Africa and Pakistan in Lahore, where they successfully chased down 305 against the Proteas. Senior batter Tom Latham believes these experiences will hold them in good stead.For New Zealand, Latham has been the standout performer with 187 runs, while Kane Williamson's return to form with an 81 against India is a positive sign. Matt Henry leads the bowling attack with eight wickets, supported by Will O'Rourke's six scalps.South Africa boast a prolific squad, with Ryan Rickelton in ominous form with a century under his belt. Their bowling attack, featuring the likes of Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi, and Keshav Maharaj, looks impressive.However, their recent form, with eight losses in their last 13 ODIs, raises concerns despite their formidable lineup.The match will be live-streamed on JioHotstar and broadcast on Star Sports Network.Temba Bavuma (C), Ryan Rickelton, Aiden Markram, Rassie van der Dussen, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), David Miller, Marco Jansen, Keshav Maharaj, Wiaan Mulder, Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi.Will Young, Rachin Ravindra, Kane Williamson, Tom Latham (wk), Daryl Mitchell, Glenn Phillips, Mitchell Santner (c), Michael Bracewell, Matt Henry, William O’Rourke, Kyle Jamieson.The match is scheduled to begin at 2:30 pm IST, while the toss will take place at 2 pm on March 5, Wednesday.","New Zealand and South Africa face off in second semifinal of Champions Trophy.

NEW DELHI: New Zealand and South Africa, both previous Champions Trophy winners in 1998 and 2000 (then known as the ICC Knockout Trophy), are set to compete in the semifinal of the tournament.Despite their talent, both teams have struggled to secure major ICC titles in recent years, with New Zealand finishing as runners-up in the last two ODI World Cups (2015, 2019) and the T20 World Cup (2021), and South Africa aiming to overcome their reputation for faltering in crucial matches.Under the leadership of Mitchell Santner, New Zealand placed second in Group A, while South Africa, led by their strong performance, topped Group B.The two teams are closely matched across various aspects of the game, though South Africa may have a slight edge in bowling diversity.The outcome may hinge on the performance of the spinners, given the slower pitch conditions that have not favored spin as much as other venues.New Zealand, despite a recent loss to India, has shown resilience and capability, notably in their recent victory over South Africa in a tri-series.Tom Latham, New Zealand's top scorer so far, along with Kane Williamson's return to form, boosts their batting lineup.South Africa's team, displaying formidable form, has shown depth in both batting and bowling, with key players in good form.However, their recent one-day international record shows a series of losses, adding an element of unpredictability to their performance. The semifinal promises a closely contested match between these evenly matched sides.The South Africa vs New Zealand match on March 5 will be played under ideal weather conditions. With a high of 24°C and plenty of sunshine, players can expect a pleasant day with no rain interruptions. The northwest wind at 17 km/h, with gusts up to 41 km/h, might slightly affect swing bowling. Evening conditions will be cooler at 10°C, with clear skies and a light breeze of 9 km/h. With 0% precipitation and minimal cloud cover, the pitch is expected to remain dry, favoring batting-friendly conditions. Spin might come into play later under clear night skies.",New Zealand and South Africa are both previous Champions Trophy winners in 1998 and 2000.

Don Sweeney is under fire following the Bruins’ struggles

Boston Bruins supporters have had enough, and their discontent is louder than ever. Calls of ""FIRE HIM! "" rang through TD Garden, indicating that tolerance has expired. General Manager Don Sweeney finds himself in the crosshairs, with most pointing to his roster moves—or lack thereof—for the team's woes. In a city where expectations are perpetually high, the heat on Sweeney remains intense. If the Bruins do not get their act together soon, the organization will have to do something.Boston Bruins fans are finally at their breaking point, and they're making sure everyone is aware of it. The anger simmering below the surface for months has now boiled over into outright anger, and they're no longer even attempting to conceal it. When the sea of people inside TD Garden are yelling at the top of their lungs, ""FIRE HIM!"" in perfect harmony, it's obvious that patience has fully run out.General Manager Don Sweeney, the mastermind behind the team's roster moves—or, to many fans, the lack of them. His management decisions, or alleged inactions at critical times, have made him the focal point of Boston's ire. The Bruins faithful are calling for change, and their voices are growing louder. With feelings running high and expectations always sky-high in a hockey town such as Boston, the pressure on Sweeney has boiled over.If things don't turn around quickly, the organization might have no other choice but to answer the calls for his firing.Lauren, a dedicated Bruins fan, expressed the entire fanbase's sentiments in a heartfelt Twitter post on March 4th. “Bruins untouchables imo: Marchand, Pastrnak, McAvoy, Swayman, Lohrei, Poitras. Emotional support players I will cry if moved: Carlo, Zacha, Coyle, Bruins we must get rid of: Neely and Sweeney.”The Boston Bruins are currently ranked 26th in scoring offense with 111 goals all season, and 31st in power play with only 12.4% conversion rate, which is not acceptable for a team that still claims to be a contender. Bruins fans are demanding Don Sweeney's departure due to embarrassing home losses and lifeless performance. They blame Sweeney for a boring roster, mid-trades, and clinging to a team identity that expired in 2019.Bruins fans aren’t holding back, and their frustration is showing. One fan joined the Garden crowd, chanting “SACK SWEENEY” loud and clear, while another took it even further, posting, “Trade Sweeney for a team dog.” Given the team’s struggles, some might agree—a golden retriever with a stick could probably run a better power play. The stats don’t lie: Boston went 0-for-2 on the power play against Edmonton, managing just three total shots. With an average of 27.9 shots per game, the offense is struggling, and fans have had enough.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Canucks insider Rick Dhaliwal recently broke down the trade rumors involving Brock Boeser and Carson Soucy","Boston Bruins fans are finally at their breaking point, and they're making sure everyone is aware of it.

DUBAI: It was a six which revived the sweet memories of the maximum that MS Dhoni struck at the Wankhede Stadium in the final to deal India's victory over Sri Lanka in the 2011 World Cup.Skipping down the track to Glenn Maxwell, KL Rahul finished off India's memorable 265-run chase against mighty, but depleted Australia , which came with 11 balls to spare, in style, sending the ball over long-on in the 49th over. Letting out a celebratory shriek, Rahul, often under the lens for being preferred over Rishabh Pant in India's ODI side as a 'keeper-batter, Rahul proved his worth when it mattered, stroking a quickfire 42 not out (34b, 2x4, 2x6) that hastened India's charge, along with Hardik Pandya 's wonderful cameo (28, 24b, 1x4, 3x6) that saw the allrounder smash back-to-back sixes off Adam Zampa in the 47th over, and a 106m giant hit off Tanveer Sangha.The main hero of India's memorable five-wicket win over Australia in the semifinal of the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy at the Dubai International Stadium on Tuesday night was, of course, Virat Kohli , who, reserving his best for the big occasion, slammed a magnificent 84 (98b, 5x4) Having made it to their third Champions Trophy final in a row and fifth overall, India will thus play the winner of the second semifinal between South Africa and New Zealand at Lahore on Wednesday, in the summit clash here on Sunday.Does the occasion present either of the two Indian batting titans-Kohli and captain Rohit Sharma , with the perfect occasion to draw curtains on their international career? We will wait and see.The victory, to some extent, erased the pain of millions of Indian cricket-lovers after Australia had downed Rohit Sharma & Co by six wickets in the final of the 2023 ODI World Cup at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Just like India, Rahul, who had crawled to a 107-ball 66 that day, too deleted the bad memories of that day on Tuesday night.Even as there were the usual straight drives, pulls and cuts, the hallmark of this Kohli innings was his ability to rotate the strike and swift running between the wickets, which kept the scoreboard moving. The 36-year-old enjoyed being on the right side of lady luck too, as he was let off on 51 in the 26th over by Glenn Maxwell, usually a brilliant fielder, at short mid-off off left-arm spinner Cooper Connolly, playing in place of injured Matthew Short.Giving wings to India's innings, Kohli put on 91 in 111 balls for the third wicket with Shreyas Iyer (45, 62b, 3x4), before the Mumbaikar was bowled while trying to cut an Adam Zampa delivery. Kohli then added 44 in 52 balls for the fourth wicket with Axar Patel (27, 30b, 1x4, 1x6) and 47 in 46 balls for the fifth wicket with Rahul to take India closer to the final.Kohli walked in after India lost Shubman Gill (8) in the fifth over when the in-form batter was bowled, getting an inside edge while trying to pull left-arm pacer Ben Dwarshuis. Soon, skipper Rohit Sharma's (28, 29b, 4x4, 1x6), luck ran out-he was dropped twice-when the 37-year-old was trapped lbw while missing a sweep off left-arm spinner Cooper Connolly, brought in by Australia for injured opener Matthew Short.Earlier, skipper Steve Smith (73, 96b, 4x4, 1x6) and 'keeper-bat Alex Carey (61, 57b, 8x4, 1x6) slammed sublime half-centuries, but another fine bowling performance by India, led by veteran pacer Mohammed Shami (three for 48 in 10 overs) helped them bowl out Australia to a below par 264 in 49.3 overs.While there were many small partnerships during Australia's innings, the world champions paid for some poor shot selection by their batters and lacked that one big stand, which meant that finished 20-25 runs short on what looks to be a batting paradise. Travis Head (39 off 33 balls, 5x4, 2x6), Marnus Labuschagne (29, 36b, 2x4, 1x6) and Josh Inglis (11) all frittered away good starts and were out against the run of play. Had any of them got going, India would've been staring at a 300-plus total.Electing to bat first on a good batting wicket, Australia suffered an early jolt when opener Connolly was caught superbly by 'keeper KL Rahul off Shami in the third over for a nine-ball duck. Dropped by Shami off the latter's own bowling in the first legal ball of the match, Head gave India's cricket fans some early jitters in the match by unleashing some delightful shots which reminded you of his blistering 137 off 120 balls in the 2023 World Cup final. India's old nemesis, the opener launched a counterattack to put the Aussies, flicking Hardik Pandya for a six in the fourth over and hitting three successive fours off Shami in the fifth over, before coming down the track to dispatch Kuldeep Yadav for a six over the bowler's head to put the Aussies in the driver's seat.However, just as the left-hander looked set for another big knock against his favourite opponents, having added 50 in just 32 balls for the second wicket with Smith, 'mystery' spinner Varun Chakravarthy , coming off a match-winning five for 42 in the last match against New Zealand at the same venue, netted the big fish off his first ball in the match, having him caught by Shubman Gill, who sprinted from long off to pull off a good grab. Collectively, the whole of India heaved a sigh of relief!Shami eventually removed Smith, who had a brain fade as he charged at the bowler, looking to tonk a quick full toss, but was castled in the 37th over. Glenn Maxwell did what Maxwell does-thrashed a six off Axar Patel to mid-wicket, before the bowler had his revenge in the same over, as the batter was bowled while trying to a big shot. Still Australia would have made a bigger score if not for a brilliant direct hit by Shreyas Iyer, which resulted in Carey falling short of his crease while going for the second run.Mixing the pace of his deliveries and being pinpoint accurate with his yorkers, Shami, who had taken five for 53 in the first match of the tournament at this venue against Bangladesh, was the best of the Indian bowlers.",India beat Australia by five wickets in ICC Champions Trophy semifinal. Virat Kohli top scored with 84 while KL Rahul hit 42 not out. India will play South Africa or New Zealand in Sunday's final in Lahore. Australia bowled out for 264 in 49.3 overs.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118722910,imgsize-41002,width-400,resizemode-4/118722910.jpg"

During a drinks break in the 40th over of India's chase, KL Rahul spoke with Virat Kohli , appearing to encourage him to stay at the crease until the end. With India requiring 65 runs from 60 balls against Australia on Tuesday, KL Rahul took on the role of aggressor in this Champions Trophy semi-final in Dubai.Rahul quickly scored a four and a six in his next five deliveries to ease the pressure on Kohli. He then rotated the strike to Kohli when India needed 40 runs from 45 balls, with Kohli 16 runs away from his 52nd ODI century.Kohli, despite being in control throughout the chase, attempted an unnecessary slog sweep against Adam Zampa and was caught at long-on. This uncharacteristic dismissal visibly frustrated KL Rahul at the non-striker's end.""Main maar raha that naa (I was going after the bowling),"" Rahul told Kohli as he walked past him.In the dressing room, coach Gautam Gambhir was also left visibly upset and mumbled something to the support staff and players seated alongside him.After the match, KL Rahul revealed his conversation with Kohli. ""When I walked in and when I played 10-12 balls I told him that you're the batter that needs to go on and be there till the end. And let me try and hit or let me try and take one chance an over. Because like you said we only needed 6 runs and over. But 6 runs and over on that wicket seemed like 8-8.5. So, you had to take one chance and over, one boundary or one six,"" Rahul told Star Sports.""So, I told him that I will do that and why don't you just rotate the strike and be there because you're the set batter and it might be harder. If you get out another set batter comes it becomes a lot more harder. But yeah, he felt like it was in his range to hit and yeah he didn't time it well.""Rahul maintained his composure and finished unbeaten with 42 runs from 34 balls, securing the victory with a six in the 49th over's first ball. This win advanced India to their fifth Champions Trophy final. Hardik Pandya contributed with a quick 28 runs from 24 balls before his dismissal.Despite the one mistimed shot, Kohli's performance was exceptional. He formed a crucial 91-run partnership for the third wicket with Shreyas Iyer, who scored 45 runs, after the early dismissals of Rohit Sharma (28) and Shubman Gill (9).Although Australia were missing key players, India hadn't defeated them in ICC tournament knockouts since the 2011 World Cup quarterfinal.Kohli effectively handled leg-spinner Adam Zampa, who had previously troubled him. He utilised pull shots and drives between sweeper cover and mid-wicket for consistent scoring.After losing both Iyer and Axar Patel (27) in quick succession, Kohli reached his fifty in 53 balls. Glenn Maxwell dropped a catch when Kohli was on 51 off Cooper Connolly's bowling.Kohli's innings ended when India needed 40 runs to win, as he hit the ball to Ben Dwarshuis at long-on off Zampa's bowling.","Virat Kohli was 16 runs away from his 52nd ODI century.
