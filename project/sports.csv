The average first innings score stands at 177, while the average second innings score is 159.

Despite Kohli's consistent performances and leadership, RCB 's pursuit of an IPL title remains unfulfilled.Following the match, former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen suggested that it might be time for Kohli to consider moving to another franchise to fulfill his dream of winning an IPL trophy.Speaking on Star Sports, Pietersen emphasized that great athletes in various sports have changed teams to achieve their goals, and Kohli might need to do the same.""I have said it before and I will say it again — the greats of the game in other sports have left teams to go and seek glory somewhere else. When he has tried and tried so hard — won the Orange Cap yet again and done so much yet again, and the franchise fails again. I understand for the brand of the team and the commercial value he brings to the team... But Virat Kohli deserves a trophy. He deserves to play in a team that could help him to get that trophy,"" Pietersen remarked.Pietersen further pointed out Kohli's roots in Delhi and suggested that he should consider joining Delhi Capitals . He drew parallels with sports icons like David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo , Lionel Messi , and Harry Kane , who switched teams to achieve greater success.""I actually think it should be Delhi. Delhi is the place where Virat needs to go. Virat can go away and stay at home most of the time, I know he has a home in Delhi. He has a young family. He can spend more time there. He is a Delhi boy. Why can't he go back? Delhi are as desperate as Bengaluru,"" he added.With this victory, Rajasthan Royals advance to Qualifier 2, where they will face Sunrisers Hyderabad for a spot in the IPL 2024 final against Kolkata Knight Riders. Meanwhile, RCB and Kohli are left to reflect on yet another season that ended in disappointment, despite flashes of brilliance from their star player.","Royal Challengers Bangalore were eliminated from IPL 2024 after losing to Rajasthan Royals.

""It would have been nice if he had gotten an outing in the first match at Headingley but we remain confident that he will continue to maintain an upward trajectory in the coming matches.""The first T20I between Pakistan and England at Headingley was called off due to inclement weather conditions.Pakistan, being the final team to reveal their squad, has been diligently working to find the right combination of players since their previous series against New Zealand ended in a 2-2 draw on their home turf last month.Babar Azam will lead the squad in the World Cup, his third T20 World Cup as skipper.The tournament will run from June 1 to June 29 and be jointly hosted by the United States and West Indies.Teams are divided in four groups of five with the top two teams qualifying for the Super Eight Stage in which all matches will be played in the West Indies.Pakistan's Group A includes arch rivals India as well as Canada and Ireland.Pakistan will face United States in their first match in Dallas on June 6.Fast bowler Hasan Ali , as well as batters Agha Salman and Muhammad Irfan Khan were left off the squad.Fast bowler Mohammad Amir -- the only survivour of Pakistan's 2009 Twenty20 World Cup triumph -- is meanwhile staging a comeback after coming out of retirement two months ago.He is part of a strong pace attack spearheaded by Shaheen Shah Afridi, Rauf, Naseem Shah and Abbas Afridi.Pakistan lost in the semi-final of the 2021 Twenty20 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates and in the final in Australia in 2022.Babar Azam (captain), Mohammad Rizwan, Saim Ayub, Fakhar Zaman, Usman Khan, Azam Khan, Iftikhar Ahmed, Imad Wasim, Shadab Khan , Mohammad Amir, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah, Abbas Afridi, Haris Rauf, Abrar Ahmed.",Pakistan retain fast bowler Haris Rauf in their 15-man squad for the Twenty20 World Cup.

NEW DELHI: Fear and pressure are two very important things to have as without them an individual can never be courageous, feels legendary MS Dhoni Stressing on the importance of having fear and pressure, Dhoni highlighted it helps you make right decisions.In a recent video post by Chennai Super Kings , Dhoni said that the two are important for development of an individual and without them decisions are made in a reckless manner.""Fear is very important. You need to have that fear because unless, if I don't have fear, I can never be brave. I can never be courageous, you know. So I always felt that fear is important, that the pressure is important because that helps me take the right decision, keeping everything in mind. If I have fear, you know, a lot of people talk about I'm fearless.""If you are fearless, then you will be reckless. Because if I don't have fear, I won't respect the normal thing. If I don't have fear of height let's say nothing. So, it hardly matters when I am walking on the road, when I am walking on the rope, you know. So I felt all these things are important for the development of an individual,"" Dhoni said.Dhoni, who led CSK to a record five Indian Premier League titles, stepped down as the skipper before the start of the ongoing season, handing the responsibilities toRuturaj Gaikwad , who led the team to a fifth place finish.Speculations have been rife that this could be Dhoni's final season in the tournament but CSK CEO Kasi Viswanathan said that it was completely up to the former India captain to take a final call on his future. Viswanathan also said he is 'very, very hopeful' of Dhoni featuring in IPL 2025 as a player.""I do not know. It is a question which only MS can answer. The question for us, we have always respected the decisions taken by MS. We have left it to him,"" he said to a question on CSK's YouTube channel.""As all of you know, he has always taken his decisions and announced them at the appropriate time. We do expect that we will get a decision as and when he decides.""But we are very, very hopeful that he will be available for CSK the next year. That is the view and expectations of the fans and mine.""Dhoni, who underwent surgery to treat a knee injury issue last year, scored 161 runs in 73 balls at a strike rate of 220.55 this season. He was also good behind the stumps.A mega IPL auction has been scheduled later in the year and if Dhoni continues, CSK will undoubtedly be retaining him.However, the number of players allowed to be retained still needs clarity.Viswanathan said that discussions are yet to take place on the same with the BCCI.""It is too early because we have still not heard from BCCI on the kind of retentions which are going to be part of the next cycle of auction.""So we are expecting that the BCCI would discuss with all franchise owners before they take a decision on retention.""","MS Dhoni says fear and pressure are important for development of an individual.

NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad skipper Pat Cummins expressed on Friday that it was a gratifying experience to witness the team's remarkable turnaround and secure a spot in the IPL final after a disastrous 2023 season.In 2023, SRH had finished at the bottom of the standings, but with Cummins brought in for a staggering Rs 20.50 crore, he orchestrated a sensational revival for the franchise.This transformation culminated in a 36-run victory over Rajasthan Royals in Qualifier 2 on Friday, propelling the team to the final.""The boys have been fantastic all season. There's a great vibe in the squad as you can see and the final was the goal at the start of the season and we made it,"" Cummins said at the post-match presentation.""It is for the whole franchise, probably 60 or 70 of them who put their heart and soul into this. It is really gratifying and hopefully one more left.""Sent in to bat, SRH put up a total of 175 for nine, propelled by Heinrich Klaasen 's brisk 50 off 34 deliveries, along with valuable knocks from Travis Head (34) and Rahul Tripathi (37).The spin contingent then came to the fore, with Shahbaz Ahmed claiming 3 wickets for 23 runs andAbhishek Sharma chipping in with 2 wickets for 24 runs.Their efforts restricted RR to a modest 139 for 7 in their allotted 20 overs. Additionally, Cummins (1/30) and T Natarajan (1/13) secured a wicket each to bolster SRH's bowling performance.""We knew our strength was our batting and we wouldn't underestimate the experience we have in this squad, it's a dream having Bhuvi, Nattu and Unadkat, makes my job easy.On Abhishek's bowling, Cummins said: ""That was a surprise, tried to stick one out of him with a couple of right-handers and he bowled beautifully and those two won it with their bowling in the middle overs.""170 was a tough chase and had we got a couple of wickets we knew we had a chance.""Rajasthan captain Sanju Samson rued that his batters couldn't find a way to tackle the spinners.""It was a big game. I am really proud of the way we bowled in the first innings. We were found short of options in the middle overs against their spin, that's where we lost the game,"" he said.""It's very hard to guess actually when we are expecting some dew or when we are not. The wicket started behaving differently in the second innings, the ball started turning a bit, they used that advantage really well.""They bowled their spin in the middle overs against our right-handed batsmen, that's where they were one-up against us.""Samson said the batters could have tried something different to upset the spinners.""Against their left-arm spin, when the ball was stopping, we could have tried a bit more reverse-sweep or maybe use the crease a bit more. They also bowled really well.""On Sandeep Sharma, who bowled beautifully on the slow track in the middle overs, Samson said: ""I am really happy for him. From not being picked in the auctions and coming back as a replacement, the way he bowled, he has definitely delivered.""If we look at the numbers, Sandeep Sharma in the last two years, he will be the next guy after Bumrah. He has done a great job.""He also lavished praise on the young players of his side.""We have had some brilliant games not only this season but from the last three years, it has been a great project for our franchise. We have found some really great talent for the country.""Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel and a lot of them are looking really exciting not only for RR but definitely for the Indian cricket team.

"Who'll replace Rahul Dravid? As clouds clear, Gautam Gambhir emerges front-runner in hunt for new coach",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/wholl-replace-rahul-dravid-as-clouds-clear-gautam-gambhir-emerges-front-runner-in-hunt-for-new-coach/articleshow/110411521.cms,"CHENNAI: KKR 's magnificent run into the IPL final has made former India opener Gautam Gambhir the hot topic in the national team's hunt for a new head coach.BCCI secretary Jay Shah's statement on Friday saying the board never approached any Australian for the job and that they ""are focused on identifying individuals who possess a deep understanding of the Indian cricket structure and have risen through the ranks"" have only added fuel to the speculation that Gambhir could be the frontrunner.Shah's words indicate that if the new coach is not VVS Laxman , who is in charge of the National Cricket Academy, then it has to be an Indian who knows how the system works. Sources close to the development indicated there hasn't been any formal proposal from the board to Gambhir yet but if it comes along, the former India opener ""may not be averse to taking it up"". The source added: ""He is that kind of character who never shies away from a challenge.""Gambhir is currently KKR mentor and the obvious question will be whether the franchise will let him go after this season's success. The feeling is ""it will be decided in a private conversation between Shah Rukh Khan and Gambhir, if it comes to that"".That brings us the question, what exactly makes Gambhir such hot property? He hasn't done any junior (or domestic) coaching but is known for his plain speak, which may not always be music to the ears of the superstars in the Indian dressing room.Those who know Gambhir insist whatever the former Delhi cricketer says, it is always ""on your face"". He was the same as captain when he revived KKR's sinking ship in 2011 to make them champions twice in a space of four years. From a lackluster seventh-place finish last year, this season KKR have topped the table with the same nucleus and start as favourites in the final.""The beauty of Gauti as a captain, and maybe as a coach also, is that he is not obsessed with numbers. He always rewards small contributions. Once as KKR captain, he gave away his Man of the Match award to (Bengal player) Debabrata Das for a cameo against CSK. The players felt empowered under him. They knew if he had a strong word with them, there must be for a reason,"" former India pacer Lashmipathy Balaji, who was one of Gambhir's chief lieutenants in the KKR team of 2011-13, told TOI.Gambhir, in a recent interview with R Ashwin, also stressed on that point. ""We get too caught up with headlines. But it is important to remember the building blocks. No one talks about Zaheer Khan 's first spell in the 2011 ODI final when he gave away six runs in five overs. Those are the contributions that we need to remember,"" Gambhir told Ashwin.As mentor of KKR too, he has stuck to this philosophy. While the likes of Sunil Narine, Phil Salt or Andre Russell have hogged the limelight for big performances, Gambhir always has a lot of time for the likes of Venkatesh Iyer, Vaibhav Arora or Harshit Rana.There's another element of Gambhir's captaincy and coaching that deserves a special mention. In the build-up to the 2012 IPL final against two-time champions CSK, when Balaji got injured, Gambhir dropped a superstar opener like Brendon McCullum to draft in little-known wicketkeeper batter Manvinder Bisla so that an experienced foreign pacer in Brett Lee could play.""Imagine the immensity - Bisla for Brendon in a final - and the repercussions of that move backfiring. But Bisla played one of the best knocks of an IPL final. That's what you call instinct and it all happened because Gauti was courageous enough to stick his neck out,"" Balaji said.Gambhir showed similar instinct as mentor when he broke the bank to draft in Mitchell Starc for Rs 24 cr in the auction this year. The move was criticized, the Aussie paceman didn't do too well in the first phase, but nothing could stop Gambhir from sticking with the left-armer, just the way MS Dhoni did with a faltering Shane Watson in the 2018 IPL.Starc's class finally showed in the all-important Qualifier 1, when he removed Travis Head off the first ball to set up the win, which brought back visions of Watson's ton in the 2018 final.",Former India opener Gautam Gambhir is the hot topic in the national team's hunt for a new head coach.BCCI secretary Jay Shah's statement on Friday said the board never approached any Australian for the job.

Abhishek Sharma had bowled only three overs in 14 matches until Friday in this IPL season, before he rolled over his arm to deliver a winning spell of left-arm spin in the most crucial game for Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in Chennai.Until the Qualifier 2 , it was Abhishek's bat making most of the noise, as 470 runs came off the SRH opener's willow in 14 innings at a strike rate of 207.75, including the season-highest 41 sixes.But it was his bowling spell of 2 for 24, which included wickets of Rajasthan Royals' skipper Sanju Samson (10) and Shimron Hetmyer (4), that took SRH into the IPL 2024 final.Chasing SRH's 175 for 9, Rajasthan could only muster 139 for 7.The 2016 winners SRH will now take on the 2012 and 2014 champions Kolkata Knight Riders in the title clash on Sunday in Chennai.Offering a rare combination of an opening batsman who is more than a useful bowler, former Australia all-rounder Tom Moody termed Abhishek a ""serious package"" for the future of Indian cricket.""He backs himself 100%. Yes, he doesn't bowl as much as he needs to bowl in domestic cricket for whatever reasons, but for the future of Indian cricket, he needs to be bowling because he is a serious package to be reckoned with. (He bats) at the top of the order, someone who can bowl left-arm spin whatever the format, he's going to be a real asset going forward,"" Tom Moody said on ESPNcricinfo.Moody then compared Abhishek with Australia's off-spin legend Nathan Lyon in terms of how the Indian youngster's ball lands and dips in flight.""The reason that makes him unique as a spinner is he tosses it up and what he tries to do is get overspin on the ball, so the ball comes down like that (seam upright), Nathan Lyon style, it dips. So he doesn't bowl side spin, he bowls overspin and he's got that clever carrom ball he's been working on, which is the one Hetmyer got and was an absolute peach,"" said Moody.Abhishek, who could score only 12 runs on Friday to take his tally to 482, said he wasn't sure his bowling will be required in Qualifier 2.""To be honest, I didn't know I will bowl in this match, but I was very much ready with my bowling because I've been working really hard on my bowling,"" Abhishek said after SRH's 36-run victory. ""The last two years it's been really good with my batting, so I wanted to work on my bowling with my dad.

Samson's failures on big days have been his biggest undoing and Royals expected a much better effort from their skipper.It was imperative after Sandeep Sharma, the master operator on tacky surfaces, put his skill-sets to optimum use while restricting Hyderabad to a decent yet manageable 175 for 9.The Royals bowling could be segregated into three distinct parts despite Heinrich Klaasen's half-century (50, 34b) that had four maximums.Trent Boult (3/45) started the slide in the Powerplays, Sandeep choked the 'Orange Army' batters in the middle overs while Avesh Khan 2.0 was asmenacing at the death (3/27) as he has been throughout the tournament.But it was the canny Sandeep (2/25 in 4 overs), who took pace off his deliveries as Sunrisers batters were literally 'Short Third-Manned' with four batters failing to clear the fielder stationed at the edge of the 30-yard circle.Chahal manning the slot took three catches while Ashwin also got one at the same position.The problem SRH batters, including the in-form Travis Head (34 off 28 balls), faced was the lack of pace in the surface that became a hindrance while using it for the traditional T20 ramp scoops.Abhishek (12) at the start became indiscreet when he played one shot too many off Boult and was holed out.The ploy to use Ashwin (0/43 in 4 overs) with the new ball because of his familiarity with Chepauk didn't work as Rahul Tripathi (37 off 15 balls) hit the senior off-spinner out of the attack.Just when it seemed that he was taking control on a day when Head wasn't getting his timing right, his poor shot selection while trying to hit Boult over short third became his undoing.Aiden Markram's re-entry in playing XI didn't pay dividends as he was out slashing at short third-man. However with Klaasen for company, SRH were clawing back at 99 for 3 when Head paid for his profligacy with Sandeep rolling his fingers over.Klaasen understood that the ball wasn't coming onto the bat and only went for the jugular to the deliveries that were in his arc as he got one of his better half-centuries in difficult conditions before a slower delivery on the blockhole rattled the furniture.With Klaasen's departure, the chances of getting past 200 also went through the window.(With inputs from PTI)","Sunrisers Hyderabad beat Rajasthan Royals by 36 runs in IPL Qualifier 2.

But Shahbaz had no idea of what was coming next as one of his teammates took a big chunk from the cake and smeared it on Shahbaz's face, much to the amusement of the rest of the squad watching on.Besides that fun, skipper Pat Cummins, Klaasen and Shahbaz also connected with the fans from the SRH dressing room after the win.",Sunrisers Hyderabad beat Rajasthan Royals by 36 runs in Qualifier 2.

NEW DELHI: India's top-ranked singles player, Sumit Nagal , faces a challenging opening round at the French Open as he prepares to take on world number 18, Karen Khachanov of Russia, on Sunday.

Nagal, ranked 94th in the world, earned direct entry into the Grand Slam 's main draw due to his consistent performances on the tour. This makes him the first Indian male player to qualify for the French Open main draw since Prajnesh Gunneswaran in 2019.

Despite this milestone, Nagal has struggled with form leading up to the clay-court Grand Slam. After a third-round loss to Holger Rune at the Monte Carlo Masters, Nagal missed the Madrid and Rome Masters. His recent outings have also been disappointing, with first-round exits at both the Bordeaux Challenger and the Geneva Open earlier this month.

In contrast, Khachanov, the 18th seed, comes into the tournament with a strong record. He reached the quarterfinals of the French Open last year and won the Qatar Open 250 in February. Khachanov boasts an impressive 21-7 record this season, highlighting the formidable challenge Nagal will face in the opening round.

Nagal's match against Khachanov is set to be a significant test of his resilience and form as he aims to make a mark at the French Open.
