Rishabh Pant's dismal Indian Premier League (IPL) season continued as the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) captain scored a 17-ball 18 against Punjab Kings at the HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala on Sunday.LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka couldn’t hide his disappointment after Rishabh Pant’s failure and looked visibly upset.Pant stepped down the track, made room, and threw the kitchen sink at it, but by doing so, he lost his shape. The bat flew off his hand and landed near the square leg umpire, while the ball flew towards the deep point region, where Shashank Singh took a comfortable catch. Azmatullah Omarzai got the wicket for Punjab.Pant has endured a disappointing run with the bat, registering six single-digit scores for a total of 128 runs in 11 matches with a below-par strike rate of 99.22. His only noteworthy knock this season has been a 63 against Chennai Super Kings. Of the 70 batters who have faced at least 60 balls this season, only Pant has a sub-100 strike rate.Earlier, Punjab Kings produced a superlative batting display, led by Prabhsimran Singh, to post 236 for five against LSG in their crucial IPL match.Sent in to bat, Prabhsimran smashed a 48-ball 91 and shared a 78-run stand with skipper Shreyas Iyer (45) to lay the foundation before Nehal Wadhera (16), Shashank Singh (33), and Marcus Stoinis (15) chipped in to take PBKS to the imposing total.For LSG, Akash Maharaj Singh (2/30) and Digvesh Singh Rathi (2/46) took two wickets each, while Price Yadav (1/43) accounted for a wicket. Mayank Yadav, in fact, conceded 60 runs in his four overs, without taking a wicket.The LSG batting unit, which has performed well below par after the first stage of the tournament, will need to bat out of their skins to chase down the target. But at the end of 10 overs, LSG were reeling at 74 for 5.","LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka couldn’t hide his disappointment after Rishabh Pant’s failure.

Punjab Kings climbed to second place on the IPL 2025 points table after their dominant 37-run win over Lucknow Super Giants at the HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala on Sunday. This victory marked PBKS’ seventh win of the season from 11 matches, taking their points tally to 15. With three losses and one no-result, they now sit just behind table-toppers Royal Challengers Bengaluru, who have 16 points from 11 games.RCB continue to lead the pack with 8 wins and 3 losses, boasting a healthy net run rate (NRR) of +0.482. While Punjab Kings also have only three defeats, their NRR of +0.376 places them narrowly below RCB.Mumbai Indians, with 7 wins and 4 losses from 11 matches, are third with 14 points, but their impressive NRR of +1.274 — the best among all teams — gives them a strong edge if points get tied later in the tournament.Gujarat Titans follow closely in fourth with 14 points from 10 games, thanks to their consistent form and a solid NRR of +0.867.Delhi Capitals are holding the fifth spot with 12 points from 10 matches and remain in the hunt for a top-four finish.Kolkata Knight Riders, with 11 points from 11 matches, are still in the playoff race but need a strong finish.Lucknow Super Giants’ defeat to PBKS hurt their playoff chances, leaving them on 10 points from 11 games and a negative NRR of -0.469, which could be crucial in a tight finish.Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings have been eliminated from playoff contention. RR have just 3 wins from 12 matches, while CSK, surprisingly, sit at the bottom with only 2 wins from 11 games and a poor NRR of -1.117.Sunrisers Hyderabad are also struggling with 3 wins from 10 games and an NRR of -1.192, making their path to the playoffs extremely difficult.",Punjab Kings climb to second place on the IPL 2025 points table after their dominant 37-run win over Lucknow Super Giants.

In-form opener Prabhsimran Singh continued his splendid form with another match-winning 91 runs as Punjab Kings (PBKS) defeated Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) by 37 runs at the HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala on Sunday.Prabhsimran Singh's explosive 91, studded with six fours and seven sixes, set the stage for a high-scoring affair. It was Prabhsimran's third consecutive fifty. Shashank Singh's late cameo of 33 off 15 balls further bolstered Punjab's total to 236 for 5.If Prabhsimran shone with the bat, then left-arm seamer Arshdeep Singh picked up three wickets in the powerplay to put Punjab on top. Arshdeep, in his opening bursts, removed Mitchell Marsh, Aiden Markram, and Nicholas Pooran to knock Lucknow out of playoff contention.Chasing 237, LSG managed 199/7. For LSG, Ayush Badoni was the lone ranger, scoring 74 off 40 balls.Earlier, Prabhsimran's impressive innings came to an end when he attempted an ambitious switch hit off Digvesh Rathi, falling nine runs short of what would have been his second IPL century.The match began with LSG making an early breakthrough when Priyansh Arya was dismissed for 1 run, caught by Mayank Yadav at deep backward point off Akash Singh's bowling.Josh Inglis initiated the Punjab Kings' assault with three consecutive sixes against Mayank Yadav, whose bowling speed has reportedly decreased by approximately 15 kmph following his rehabilitation at the BCCI's National Cricket Academy.After Inglis's departure, Prabhsimran partnered with captain Shreyas Iyer, who scored 45 off 25 balls, to take control of the innings. Their partnership was aided by poor fielding from Avesh Khan.Prabhsimran particularly targeted Avesh Khan, hitting him for consecutive sixes over mid-wicket. Khan's figures were disappointing, conceding 57 runs in four overs, with additional runs leaked through misfielding.The partnership between Prabhsimran and Iyer yielded 78 runs in 7.5 overs before Rathi became the first spinner this season to dismiss the Punjab Kings captain.LSG's bowlers struggled throughout the innings, consistently bowling to Prabhsimran's strengths and allowing him to capitalize on scoring opportunities.","Punjab Kings defeated Lucknow Super Giants by 37 runs.

NEW DELHI: Prabhsimran Singh lit up the picturesque HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala with a blistering knock at the top of the order for Punjab Kings . After settling in early, the opener unleashed a flurry of powerful strokes, taking the attack to the Lucknow Super Giants bowlers. He brought up his half-century in just 30 balls, continuing a rich vein of form.This was Prabhsimran’s third consecutive fifty in IPL 2025—an achievement that places him alongside Punjab Kings legends Chris Gayle and KL Rahul. He’s now only the third PBKS opener to score three successive 50-plus innings in a single IPL season.Earlier in the day, LSG skipper Rishabh Pant won the toss and opted to bowl first.

Punjab Kings (PBKS) co-owner Preity Zinta was left stunned after Shashank Singh smacked Mayank Yadav for a six that sailed outside the HPCA Stadium on Sunday.On the fourth ball of the 17th over, bowled by Mayank Yadav, Shashank Singh sent the ball over deep backward square-leg, hitting the roof of a building and going over.The shot elicited an epic reaction from Preity Zinta, who could be seen shouting ""oooohhhhhhhhhhh!""The umpire had to ask for a new ball as the ball landed outside the stadium.Prabhsimran Singh's 91 off 48 powers Punjab Kings to 236/5.Earlier, LSG skipper Rishabh Pant won the toss and opted to field first.

Looks like it will stop a bit, a little loose on the top. Still, a good wicket. It is going to be a good match. Bowling first, we will have the advantage and see how the game unfolds, and that's the kind of advantage we were looking to have. Just trying to be simple more often. You want people to have a conversation when you are losing. Good to see youngsters stepping in,” he said.PBKS captain Shreyas Iyer said they had made one change – seam-bowling all-rounder Marcus Stoinis comes into the playing eleven. “We would have bowled first as well. The wicket was covered for a while, and it was pouring yesterday and the day before. It was under the sheets, and you know the moisture it adopts. The grass is thicker.”“I don't want to predict how the wicket is going to be. We are up for the competition. You've got to take positives from the game. You can't dwell on how bad you have done in a particular game. It haunts you every now and then.”“We need to be in high spirits and keep motivating each other and see to it that we are enjoying each other's success. That's the culture and camaraderie in the team. Just keeping things simple. I know it is tough, but that's the mantra,” he said.PBKS are fourth on the points table with six wins from 10 games and are very much in the reckoning to enter the playoffs.

NEW DELHI: Rinku Singh delivered a match-defining fielding performance as Kolkata Knight Riders edged Rajasthan Royals by just one run in a dramatic finish at Eden Gardens on Sunday, keeping their IPL 2025 playoff hopes alive.With Royals needing three runs off the final ball, Shubham Dubey hit the ball to long-off and called for two. But Rinku, patrolling the boundary, sprinted in, picked up cleanly, and fired a one-bounce throw to Vaibhav Arora, who calmly removed the bails to catch a diving Jofra Archer short of his crease.

NEW DELHI: Just days after setting the cricket world ablaze with a breathtaking century, 14-year-old Rajasthan Royals prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi is now experiencing a dry patch with the bat. The young sensation from Samastipur, Bihar — who smashed 11 sixes in a whirlwind knock at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur to become an overnight star — has since struggled to replicate that form. After being dismissed for a duck against Mumbai Indians , he managed just 4 runs against Kolkata Knight Riders .Suryavanshi began promisingly, opening his account with a stylish cover-driven boundary. However, his stay was short-lived. On the very next delivery, Vaibhav Arora bowled a short ball that Suryavanshi attempted to pull, only to miscue it towards mid-wicket. Ajinkya Rahane ran in and took a brilliant catch to send the teenager back to the pavilion.Notably, Suryavanshi’s stunning century came against a bowling attack comprising veterans like Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Washington Sundar, Rashid Khan, and Karim Janat — making his achievement even more impressive. It was also the second-fastest century in the tournament’s history.Rajasthan Royals bowling coach Shane Bond recently revealed that the team management is being cautious with the teenage talent.“The coaching staff haven’t tried to complicate things too much with Vaibhav. He’s sort of got a bit of a license to go out and just play, which he’s done an amazing job so far, really, for a 14-year-old. So look again, he missed out in the last game, but for us, you don’t really want to panic with someone so young, you just come out and plug in tomorrow,"" Bond said at the pre-match press conference.“I know Vikram (Rathour) talks about his game plans and the type of bowlers that he’s going to come up against and he’ll do that again for this match, but outside of that, he’s a pretty young kid, so I’m just happy for him to get out there and keep swinging. It’ll be that again,"" he added.Bond emphasised the importance of patience when nurturing a player so young.“He’s (Vaibhav) obviously a seriously talented player, but he’s also still a kid. So, he’s sort of learning on the go, we’re going to be really patient with him because you have to be. And the other part of it is just all the off-field stuff, the travel (and such), you can’t expect a 14-year-old to be a professional. Like I’ve got a 16-year-old son and he’s a teenager, so we’re just trying to educate him on the things around and look after him, shield him a little bit from the social media stuff and all the trappings that come with the way he started, but he’s a lovely kid,"" Bond said.","14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi is experiencing a dry patch with the bat.

Mikko Rantanen’s Game 7 heroics for Dallas leave Colorado fans branding him a 'traitor’

Mikko Rantanen ’s return to Colorado as a playoff opponent couldn’t have been more dramatic—or divisive. In a high-stakes Game 7 showdown, the former Avalanche star scored a hat trick and notched four points to lead the Dallas Stars to a 4-2 comeback win, knocking his old team out of the Stanley Cup Playoffs . While Rantanen delivered a clutch performance on the ice, the emotional aftermath has left Avalanche fans anything but forgiving.The Finnish winger, once beloved in Denver, was dealt to Carolina briefly before landing in Dallas. His departure was controversial, sparked by failed contract negotiations with the Avs. Though Rantanen claimed he wanted to stay—“At the end of the day, I always wanted to stay in Colorado”—many fans believe his decision to leave was driven by financial ambition. “Cheap ass. Could have stayed in Denver on the same contract. Douche,” one fan wrote, highlighting the growing resentment.Despite the venom, Rantanen’s performance was nothing short of spectacular. After trailing 2-0 in the third, Dallas stormed back with Rantanen leading the charge. His Game 7 heroics capped off a dominant series in which he recorded 12 points—including back-to-back four-point games in Games 6 and 7.Still, even his post-game comments acknowledging his emotional connection to his former team couldn’t salvage goodwill. “They’re my brothers. I still love every one of them,” Rantanen said. “We were enemies in the series on the ice, but they’re my dear friends off the ice.” Another wrote, “Isn’t this guy kind of a little bitch or do I have that wrong?” But for many fans, the sentiment rang hollow.Colorado, who finished just behind Dallas in the Central Division standings, hadn’t missed the second round since 2023. Now, with their season cut short by a familiar face, many are questioning whether the front office should have fought harder to keep their former star. “Should have paid that man his money,” one fan lamented. Another added, “Should never traded a player like this… now Colorado will suffer.”Also Read: Steve Yzerman hints at parting ways with Vladimir Tarasenko and Erik Gustafsson in major roster shakeup As Rantanen moves on with Dallas, his legacy in Denver may be forever altered—one clutch performance and one bitter fan base at a time.","Mikko Rantanen’s Game 7 heroics for Dallas leave Colorado fans branding him a ‘traitor’ “Cheap ass.

Gujarat Titans aim to recover from the blow dealt by young sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi when they face a struggling Sunrisers Hyderabad in an IPL match tonight (May 2).Suryavanshi stunned GT with his incredible performance, hitting the season’s fastest century in just 35 balls and becoming the youngest IPL centurion at only 14 years and 32 days old.Despite an eight-wicket loss — post a strong 209/4 score — the result hasn't altered GT's position in the league. The Titans remain one of the most consistent teams this season, boasting a balanced squad with strengths in both batting and bowling.Led by Shubman Gill, they sit comfortably with six wins out of nine matches (12 points). Just two more wins from their last five fixtures would secure a spot in the playoffs, reaching the 16-point threshold.GT's in-form top order gives them confidence, especially with standout Sai Sudharsan, who is second in the Orange Cap race with 456 runs and five fifties. Gill (389 runs) and Jos Buttler (406 runs) also rank among the season’s top batters, making a formidable trio despite recent challenges.Earlier this season, GT defeated SRH convincingly in Hyderabad by seven wickets, thanks largely to Mohammed Siraj's impressive 4/17 spell. They’ll be hoping for a similar performance this time.Meanwhile, SRH find themselves in a critical position, needing wins urgently. The runners-up last season have struggled — just three wins in nine matches — and sit ninth on the points table.

Poll Do you think Yash Dayal's performance has improved since joining RCB? No, it has worsened No, it has remained the same Yes, slightly Yes, significantly

NEW DELHI: It must have been déjà vu for Yash Dayal when he was handed the final over by skipper Rajat Patidar on Saturday. It was the same scenario he faced in IPL 2024: same team ( RCB ), same opponent ( CSK ), same venue (M. Chinnaswamy Stadium ), and the same batter on strike ( MS Dhoni ).In 2024, Dayal had to defend 17 runs; this time, it was 15. Back then, despite being hit for a massive six off the first ball by Dhoni, Dayal held his nerve, pulling things back and leading RCB to a thrilling win that secured their playoff spot while sending CSK packing.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! On Sunday, Dayal once again found himself entrusted with the crucial task by his captain, with the legendary Dhoni on strike. The atmosphere in the stadium was tense, but Dayal remained ice-cold.The final over was a spectacle of nerves and drama. CSK needed 15 runs to salvage some pride in what had been a dreadful campaign. Dayal gave away a single to Dhoni on the first ball and another single to Jadeja on the second. Then came the turning point: on the third ball, Dayal dismissed Dhoni and shifted the momentum in RCB’s favour.Also See: IPL Live Score KKR vs RR Shivam Dube entered with CSK needing 13 from 3 balls.Then, chaos. A waist-high no-ball gave Dube a free hit, which he smashed for six. The equation suddenly changed — 6 needed off 3 balls.With just six required from three, Dayal kept his composure. He bowled a single to Dube on the fourth ball, and Jadeja couldn’t make an impact on the penultimate ball, also taking a single.Now, it was down to 4 runs needed from the final ball. Dayal exchanged a brief word with Patidar. The tension was palpable, but Dayal calmly took his run-up and delivered a low full-toss. Dube connected hard, sending the ball to long-on, but only managed two runs.RCB dugout, players on the field and thousands in the stands erupted. Not only did the win lift them to the top of the points table, but it also marked another clutch finish from Dayal — his calmness under pressure proving decisive once more.A unique stat: In both the 2024 and 2025 instances, Dayal dismissed Dhoni.Despite the no ball and the six, another person who remained cool under pressure was his father, Chanderpal Dayal, watching from Allahabad. At no point did he doubt the outcome, knowing full that Yash would pull through.""It’s never over till the last ball is bowled in cricket. Yash is more mature now. I’m sure even the fans had given up — my family did too. But I was confident that Yash would pull it off. And he did. His calmness was the key in this match,"" Yash Dayal's father told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.""I was watching the 2024 match — he was in the same situation, and Dhoni was there too. When Patidar handed him the last over this time, I was literally smiling. The skipper knows Yash well. The management has shown a lot of trust in him. Virat has supported him immensely since he joined RCB. He’s the reason Yash is performing so freely, without any baggage on his shoulders""Virat hamesha bolte hain usko darr ke nahi, bindas khel, khul ke khel [Virat always tells him to not play with fear, but to play freely and with confidence],"" the father said.Dayal has burried the 2023 nightmare a long back. While playing for Gujarat Titans, Dayal had to defend 29 off the final over against Kolkata Knight Riders. KKR's hard-hitting batter Rinku Singh hit five consecutive sixes off Yash Dayal to give his team a dramatic victory.Dayal became the butt of jokes on social media. He was released by Gujarat Titans ahead of IPL 2024 Auction. But, RCB showed faith in him and bought him for Rs 5 crore. He was also retained by RCB prior to the 2025 season.“I would like to thank RCB for showing faith in me and for retaining me. I couldn’t have asked for a better team to play for. RCB believed in me even in my lowest moments. That is very special for me,” said Dayal on social media ahead of the season.Dayal's father Chandrapal revealed how Kohli helped Dayal in tough times.""He always said 'Papa bhul jao uss episode ko, mai yaad nahi karna chahta. Bahot aage jana hai [Papa, forget that episode. I don't want to remember it. Have to go a long way]'. He was never down, even after getting hit by Rinku Singh. I am really thankful to RCB for showing trust in him and supporting him,"" the father said. Virat Kohli has supported him a lot. When Yash joined RCB, Virat would often call him to his room — and sometimes, he would go to Yash’s room himself. They discussed that over [from 2024], and Virat told him one thing: ‘Keep working hard, toofan macha de. Main hoon tere saath. Chinta mat karna. Mehnat karna mat chhodna. Galtiyan karna, par seekhna aur aage badhna.’ (Keep working hard, create a storm. I’m with you. Don’t worry. Never stop putting in the effort. Make mistakes, but learn and move forward).

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

Sachin Tendulkar at 52: Power, Pride, and a Nation’s Pulse

NEW DELHI: There was a wave of excitement and anticipation after Punjab Kings (PBKS) announced their lineup for the opening IPL 2021 clash against Rajasthan Royals (RR). West Indian superstar Chris Gayle and his big-hitting countryman Nicholas Pooran were set to feature together, sparking discussions on how many sixes the duo might smash. However, the scenario turned out to be quite an anticlimax, as former South African cricketer Chris Morris dismissed Pooran for a golden duck. The 29-year-old's fortunes further worsened from that point, as he managed to score just 28 runs in seven matches, recording four ducks. Pooran, who had entered IPL 2021 with the reputation of someone who smashes sixes for fun, managed to hit just one six during that period.The wicketkeeper-batter failed to turn things around in the remaining matches, ending IPL 2021 with 85 runs in 12 outings. Pooran smashed just five sixes throughout the campaign, recording a strike rate of 111.84 and an average of 7.72. PBKS opted to release the West Indian cricketer at the end of the season, raising questions about his future in the IPL.However, the 29-year-old has pulled off a sensational comeback—one that very few can boast of—emerging as a genuine game-changer. Pooran currently leads the tally for most sixes in IPL 2025 , smashing 34 in 10 matches. MI batter Suryakumar Yadav is second on the list with 26 sixes in 11 games. Pooran has been the top run-getter for Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), amassing 404 runs at a strike rate of 203.01.Ex-West Indies cricketer Adrian Barath, the youngest player from his country to score a Test century, even stated that it's very possible for Pooran to become the first cricketer to score 250 in a T20 match.""Pooran can achieve anything he wants across every format. He is capable and has great strength and hunger to excel as much as possible. Pooran is also exceptionally hard-working and keeps grinding it out in the nets throughout the day till he has perfected his strokes,"" said Barath in an exclusive interaction with TimesofIndia.com.""Talent alone gets you nowhere. He has found that sweet spot with regard to mixing talent and hard work, which we've witnessed in the case of top players like Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara. At the same time, he also has a very strong base. Pooran's legs are very powerful, like a horse. His head stays still, which helps him connect well. In short, he has all the ingredients for six-hitting. The first time I saw Pooran was when he was 14 years old. I was impressed with the way he fielded with great intent, throwing his body around. I knew he was destined for success as a cricketer that very moment,"" he added.One of the major factors behind Pooran's transformation after the IPL 2021 debacle has been the support of West Indian cricketers Kieron Pollard and Sunil Narine , with whom he shares a close bond.""Pollard and Narine have backed him through thick and thin. I am very sure that they would have had discussions with Pooran following the conclusion of IPL 2021. Pollard and Narine have constantly guided, motivated, and helped him improve his game and take it to the next level,"" said Pooran's former coach David Furlonge.""Pooran also has a great deal of respect for them. I remember a match where all the Trinidadian as well as West Indian cricketers were in contention for selection. I went to Pollard and told him to drop somebody in this tricky situation. He called Pooran and said, 'Go and run three laps. You're not playing today.' Pooran simply said okay rather than creating a fuss,"" he added.Another significant reason behind Pooran's dominance, especially in IPL 2025, is the decision to promote him to the number three position. The West Indian cricketer has thrived in the role, making the most of the freedom the slot provides.""Pooran is best suited to bat at number three. Whosoever took the call to send him to that position deserves an award. It has changed his batting style. Pooran is now more responsible. When you go in to bat at number five, six, or seven, it doesn't help you develop as a batter,"" said former Cricket West Indies (CWI) director Baldath Mahabir, whose academy Pooran trained at during his early years.""Pooran has a great amount of confidence, and giving him a limited number of balls to face deprives him of the opportunity to express himself. I recollect an interaction between him and his first coach Dashrath Maharaj, who asked Pooran to hit the ball only if it falls in his zone. He simply replied, 'Coach, I have plenty of zones.' That is an indication of his confidence levels,"" added Mahabir.""Pollard and I would always discuss that Pooran should be batting at number three, especially in T20s. We used to try and send him up the order at number three or four to give him quality time in the middle,"" shared Furlonge.Former PBKS batting consultant and power-hitting coach Julian Wood termed the clarity Pooran has received regarding his batting position—and his consistent run at number three—as a tactically brilliant move.""He now has clarity with regard to his role after being played at every slot from number one to seven previously. With clarity comes confidence and trust in your technique, enabling Pooran to simply focus on hitting the ball in the best possible manner. Confidence plays a massive role in cricket. Pooran has also simplified his process and worked it all out with regard to rhythm and timing, resulting in his consistency going through the roof. He is a pure striker of the ball, just like Sachin and Virat Kohli,"" stated Wood.Pooran has been praised for his determination and dedication, often pulling off match-winning performances in difficult situations. However, no on-field challenge compares to the near-fatal road accident he survived in 2015.""I was in so much pain. I just wanted them to knock me out,"" Pooran had once shared while discussing the collision.Doctors were uncertain if he would ever play again, even suggesting that walking might be difficult. But Pooran defied the odds.""I visited him in the hospital. He was always very confident. I feared that he wouldn't be that strong following the accident and was also worried about the weight he had put on. He lost it easily and overcame all the physical and mental challenges—just like Rishabh Pant,"" said Mahabir.While most players would ease back into the game after such trauma, Pooran returned hungrier than ever—with Furlonge playing a key role in his comeback.""Pooran came back with purpose and complete focus, becoming even stronger despite the accident. Pollard, Narine, and Dwayne Bravo helped him by pushing him to achieve his goals. Coming back from an injury like that shows the character Pooran has,"" said Furlonge.""He always made himself available for practice and worked on his fitness extensively. Pollard and Narine used to approach me to let Pooran play—they knew his talent and wanted him to make full use of it. Pooran had his own personal trainer who guided him with a fitness programme that he followed religiously,"" he added.Though widely popular on social media for his humorous reactions, Pooran is fiercely competitive and brutally honest when expectations aren’t met.""Pooran's team lost the final of a tournament where he had helped the team sail through every stage, carrying them on his shoulders. He didn’t score in the final because he was mentally tired. Pooran wasn’t happy with his teammates’ performance and expressed his frustration in an outburst. He is extremely competitive and wants to win at any cost,"" said Furlonge.""No match is over till Pooran is at the crease. He once walked out to bat when his team was down and out with 200 runs needed. We won the match very comfortably in the end. Pooran is highly impactful—just like Chris Gayle—but more of a 360-degree player than him,"" he added.","Nicholas Pooran is the top run-getter for Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) The West Indian cricketer has scored 404 runs at a strike rate of 203.01. Pooran currently leads the tally for most sixes in IPL 2025, smashing 34 in 10 matches.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120870077,imgsize-47362,width-400,resizemode-4/Pooran-0405-BCCI.jpg"

?

NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) won the toss and elected to bowl first against Punjab Kings (PBKS) in Match 54 of IPL 2025 , being played at the HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala on Sunday. This marks PBKS’ first home game at their second venue of the season, having played four previous matches in New Chandigarh.PBKS currently sit fourth on the points table with six wins from 10 matches and remain firmly in the playoff race. LSG, returning to action after a week-long break, are placed sixth with five victories from 11 games. A win today is crucial for them to stay in the hunt for a playoff spot.After calling correctly at the toss, LSG captain Rishabh Pant explained his decision to bowl first, citing possible early assistance for bowlers. ""We feel it's a bowling-first pitch. Not sure how it's going to behave, but it looks like the ball might stop a bit. It's slightly loose on the surface, though still a good wicket. Bowling first gives us an edge,” Pant said.With conditions having been wet over the past two days, LSG handed a debut cap to left-arm pacer Akash Singh and named leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi among their impact substitutes, indicating a preference for seam in the early stages.On the other hand, PBKS skipper Shreyas Iyer revealed one change in the playing XI, with seam-bowling all-rounder Marcus Stoinis included. “We would’ve bowled first too. The wicket has been under covers due to rain over the last two days, and there's some moisture beneath. The grass is a bit thick,” Iyer said.The PBKS captain emphasised the importance of staying positive. “We’re up for the challenge. You can’t dwell on poor performances; they tend to haunt you. It's about maintaining high spirits, motivating one another, and enjoying each other’s success. That’s the culture we’ve built.”Born on April 26, 2002, in the quiet village of Nagla Ram Ratan in Bharatpur, Rajasthan, Akash Singh's journey to professional cricket is a testament to grit and raw talent. Hailing from a modest family—his father a farmer and his mother a homemaker—Akash took his first significant step towards a cricketing career at the Shardul Sports School in Bikaner.His potential quickly became evident, earning him a place at the prestigious MRF Pace Foundation, where he trained under the watchful eyes of legends like Glenn McGrath. The stint refined his control, rhythm, and swing—qualities that would shape his identity as a new-ball bowler.Akash made his domestic T20 debut for Rajasthan in the 2019 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, making an immediate impact with a two-wicket haul. His impressive performances led to selections for India’s Under-19 squads in both the 2019 ACC Asia Cup and the 2020 ICC U19 World Cup. In the latter, he emerged as India’s strike weapon with the new ball, finishing with 11 wickets in six matches and playing a vital role in guiding the team to the final.His domestic career has seen him don the jerseys of Rajasthan, Nagaland, and Baroda—demonstrating his adaptability and hunger for opportunities. In red-ball cricket, especially in the Ranji Trophy, Akash has impressed with his ability to generate movement off the seam and dismiss top-order batters, including notable performances against powerhouse teams like Mumbai.The IPL journey began when Rajasthan Royals picked him in the 2020 auction, though he had limited exposure initially. He made his IPL debut in 2021 and later caught attention during his stint with Chennai Super Kings in 2023, where he played four matches, took five wickets, and showcased his sharp pace and deceptive angle. Mentorship under MS Dhoni proved to be a pivotal experience in his development.In 2024, Akash was roped in by Sunrisers Hyderabad, although he didn’t feature in a game that season.Known for his natural ability to swing the ball and hit the deck with intent, Akash Singh remains one of the most promising left-arm seamers in India’s fast-bowling pipeline—a young pacer with the tools to shine across formats and conditions.","Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) won the toss and elected to bowl first against Punjab Kings (PBKS) in Match 54 of IPL 2025, being played at the HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala.

Nikola Jokic responds on greeting DeAndre Jordan with 3 kisses

Nikola Jokic led the Denver Nuggets to a 120-101 win over the Los Angeles Clippers in Game 7 of the first round of the NBA playoffs , but it wasn’t exactly his performance on the court that made headlines hours later. The Denver Nuggets center drew attention for greeting teammate DeAndre Jordan , who was sitting in the stands, with 3 kisses, which he called “a Serbian thing.”Nikola Jokic’s 3-kiss gesture was enough for the TNT brigade to grill The Joker. TNT host Charles Barkley asked Jokic after the game, “Is that the ugliest person you’ve ever kissed in your life?” Jokic took some time to process the question and responded, “No… Actually. Hmm.” The pause in itself was enough to add to the kissing topic and left his fans laughing over it on social media.The incident went on to become a topic of discussion on Reddit as fans had their own reactions to Nikola Jokic’s explanation: “Yes, it's a Serbian thing, he wants to be a Serbian, so... I gotta let him have a little peace.""Reacting to it, a Reddit user wrote, “The facial expression after the pause was money. Prime comedic timing.” Commenting on the 3-kiss greeting, another said, “Might actually be the cutest thing I’ve ever seen on the court.” Sharing a suggestion on Jokic’s hilarious response, a fan wrote, “Leave it alone, Jokic! Your family is watching you! Hahaha.” “Goddamn, this is funny, lol,” wrote another. A comment also read: “Are the Inside Guys just now noticing this? Those guys have done the greeting kiss for years...”After their win over the Los Angeles Clippers, the Denver Nuggets move to the second round to play against the Oklahoma City Thunder, which are the number 1 seed in the West. After the win over the Clippers, Jokic told the media, “In the playoffs, we know that everybody needs to step up — offensively, defensively, whatever, energy-wise. And everybody who plays needs to contribute something. It was special today; the guys did that.”Also Read: What is Nikola Jokic's ethnicity?

Giannis Antetokounmpo and Tyrese Haliburton’s father’s altercation stole the spotlight at Gainbridge Fieldhouse



Fans reacted to Giannis Antetokounmpo’s confrontation with Tyrese Haliburton’s father

The Indiana Pacers edged out a dramatic 119-118 overtime victory against the Milwaukee Bucks . While Tyrese Haliburton 's game-winning shot over Giannis Antetokounmpo lit up Gainbridge Fieldhouse, the postgame headlines were stolen by a courtside altercation between Giannis and Haliburton's father, John. Fans online are not happy with John’s move, as many are asking the NBA to ban him from the playoffs.Giannis Antetokounmpo was making his way off the court when John Haliburton approached him, waving a towel with his son's face on it and allegedly yelling, “This is what we do.” The bold move did not sit well with the two-time MVP, who interpreted the act as a blatant show of disrespect. Giannis responded, and the two ended up in a tense face-to-face standoff that required players and staff from both benches to intervene.Giannis later addressed the confrontation: “I believe in being humble in victory. That’s who I am,” he said in his postgame comments. “Some people will say when you win the game, you can talk s___ and say it’s a green light for you to be disrespectful. I disagree. I’ve won a championship, they haven’t.”The Bucks star added, “I feel like that’s very, very disrespectful.”Tyrese Haliburton didn’t shy away from the issue either. Addressing the incident in his postgame press conference, he took accountability for his father’s actions. “As far as the incident between Giannis and my pops, I had no idea until I got to the back and was shown the video. I don’t agree with what transpired... I don’t think that my pops was in the right at all there.”Fans online quickly shared their thoughts on the matter. Many demand a ban on John Haliburton from the NBA games as a form of punishment.“Better be banned for the rest of the playoffs for this dumb s*it,” one fan wrote on X.“Father should be banned for rest of playoffs,” another echoed the same.“Father a bad example of sportsmanship,” another wrote.“I’m glad i saw this angle cause Hali dad was deff in the wrong for taunting Giannis after a big loss like that,” another shared.“What a clown,” one fan condemned the action of John.“Why is he seeking out a 7 foot Greek god like that. Super inappropriate and stupid,” another wrote.Also Read: What happened between Giannis Antetokounmpo and Tyrese Haliburton’s father?

Kobe Bryant’s humbling journey from NBA icon to girl dad



Kobe Bryant's Kids Ignore His Hall of Fame-Worthy Basketball Tips

Kobe Bryant’s six-year coaching plan for daughter Gianna Bryant that was tragically cut short



Kobe Bryant's Come Up with Darius Miles and QRich | Knuckleheads S2: Ep 1 | The Players' Tribune

For a man who earned five NBA titles, an MVP, and global admiration for his basketball IQ, you’d think Kobe Bryant ’s advice would be gospel, especially in his own home. But when it came to teaching the game to his daughters, Kobe discovered that legendary status didn’t always carry weight under his own roof. In a throwback to 2017, the late Lakers icon opened up about his lighthearted struggles convincing his daughters to trust their dad’s on-court wisdom.Back in 2017, during a lighthearted appearance on ‘ The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon’, Kobe Bryant reflected on the early days of trying to coach his daughters, Natalia and Gianna , in basketball. He wasn’t just a dad with some playing experience—he was Kobe Bryant. But that didn’t stop his girls from brushing off his advice in favor of their coach’s.“When both of my daughters, Natalia and Gianna, started playing, I’m like, ‘Maybe, you should shoot like this,’” Kobe shared with Fallon. “They’re like, ‘No, I got this.’” Even funnier was the reason behind their defiance. “But the coach said…” was a common response Kobe heard when he tried to guide them through moves he’d perfected over two decades in the NBA.In a home full of love and laughter, it was a humbling and humorous reminder that being ‘Dad’ sometimes outweighed being a basketball genius. “You don’t know anything” isn’t what you’d expect someone like Kobe to hear when discussing hoops, but the proud father wore it with a smile.That dynamic changed over time, especially with Gianna, affectionately known as Gigi. As she began to fall deeply in love with the sport, Kobe transitioned from the ignored advisor to her full-time coach, and it became something truly special.Years later, speaking on the ‘Knuckleheads Podcast’ hosted by Darius Miles and Quentin Richardson, Kobe gave a deeper glimpse into how seriously he took coaching Gigi. The conversation took place before the tragic helicopter crash on January 26, 2020, which claimed both their lives and sent shockwaves through the basketball world.“I write practice plans every day. And it’s like a 6-year plan, and we’re in year 2,” Kobe revealed on the podcast. “So you can patiently teach them every little aspect. Teach them how to use screens, teach them how to be patient, teach them how to anticipate on defense. It’s awesome, man.”Gigi was just 13 when she began emulating her father’s footwork, perfecting his fadeaways, and mastering the up-and-under. Those around her saw Kobe’s fierce spirit mirrored in her approach, her focus, and her love for the game. Kobe himself often said she was WNBA-bound, and few doubted that.Also Read: “Mommy loves and misses you”: Vanessa Bryant’s heartfelt tribute to Gianna Bryant on what would have been her 19th birthday Kobe Bryant wasn’t just shaping a basketball player; he was nurturing a bond through a shared passion. What began as playful defiance from two young girls turned into a father-daughter basketball journey rooted in mutual respect, love, and legacy. Though their time was tragically short, the story of Kobe and Gigi remains a powerful reminder of how even legends can be humbled, and how greatness often starts with simple moments at home.","Kobe Bryant opened up about trying to coach his daughters, Natalia and Gianna, in basketball. “But the coach said…” was a common response Kobe heard when he tried to guide them through moves he’d perfected over two decades in the NBA.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120876617,imgsize-1380580,width-400,resizemode-4/Kobe-Bryant-with-his-wife-Vanessa-and-daughters-Natalia-and-Gianna-Bryant.jpg"

“It has already been their strength for a while, so sometimes on a track where the deg is a bit lower of course you might not see it as much, but on a track like this with thermal degradation it’s of course bigger.”

Poll Should CSK continue investing in young talent? No, they need experienced players. Yes, absolutely!

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 4: Prof. Ratnakar Shetty on BCCI, cricket politics & Indian cricket's growth

BENGALURU: The curtain may have been drawn on Chennai Super Kings ’ campaign much earlier than they are known to this IPL season, but the future appears bright. Branded ‘Dads’ Army’ not long ago, CSK now have a sprinkling of youngsters, a mixture of teenagers and players in their 20s just raring to go.Evidence of this came over the weekend against Royal Challengers Bengaluru . Chasing 214 for victory, CSK appeared on target until the final over — indeed the final delivery — before agonizingly falling short.The photo finish was down largely to one man — or rather, boy — 17-year-old Ayush Mhatre . Displaying maturity far beyond his years and the four IPL matches he has featured in so far, Mhatre was a veritable pocket-Hercules, the youngster looking more comfortable and confident than most of the senior pros in the line-up.Consider this: Of the fourth delivery he faced — a flighted one, from finger-spinner Krunal Pandya — Mhatre stepped out and casually lofted it down the ground. That was just the teaser for the blockbuster show that followed. He finished with a 48-ball 94, an impressive statistic in a game in which CSK were under the cosh right from the start.Mhatre made his domestic debut for Mumbai last season and was roped in as an injury replacement for CSK skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad . He joined the five-time champions more than three weeks after the tournament began and had notable scores of 32 (15b) and 30 (19b) against Mumbai Indians and Sunrisers Hyderabad.Against RCB’s bowling line-up, he was in a zone, particularly destroying Bhuvaneshwar Kumar’s numbers by plundering 26 runs in boundaries in the fourth over.Mhatre came in for high praise from head coach Stephen Fleming , who, while outlining the abilities of the Mumbaikar, said, “He’s got talent. He’s got hand-eye coordination. He’s got a beautiful, silky swing. He’s aggressive. Everything that we like about a modern-day T20 player.”But diminutive Mhatre’s biggest strength, said the New Zealander, was: “To me, it’s the temperament and being able to execute in a trial and then on the big stage. That’s what I’m most impressed with.”On the teenager’s execution on field, Fleming said: “It’s one thing to have a lot of shots, but to be able to execute that game plan on a big stage in front of some of the biggest players in the world is what I admire. While his innings did not result in a CSK win, it ensured the franchise has a player for the future.”Fleming revealed Mhatre’s transition from the Mumbai dressing room to the CSK dugout has been seamless. “We have a pretty relaxed camp, which has always been our style,” the former Black Caps captain said. “He has some teammates (from Mumbai) like (Shivam) Dube, who he has seen a fair bit of. Again, it comes back to his maturity. He fitted in seamlessly. It’s often not what the team around him does, but it’s just the way that he behaves. He was very comfortable right from day one and the team was very comfortable with him. Hopefully, it’s the start of a long relationship.”",Chennai Super Kings have a sprinkling of youngsters in their squad. 17-year-old Ayush Mhatre has impressed in his four IPL matches so far.

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

HYDERABAD: With the Indian Premier League (IPL) season nearing its business end, it is not where the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) want to be. They are second from bottom on the table with six points and are virtually out of the playoffs race, as not even four wins in their remaining matches can guarantee their progress.And when they host an equally desperate Delhi Capitals (DC) here on Monday, the hosts look to stay alive in the competition, even if marginally.The visitors have a lot at stake. With 12 points from 10 games, DC are fifth in the table and a win here will put them in the top-four bracket. Capitals were off to a fine start, winning four of their opening fixtures. But their campaign fizzled out, suffering four losses in their next six games, including back-to-back losses to KKR and RCB in their two previous games.KL Rahul (371) has been their leading run-getter, but DC will look for more from Faf du Plessis, who signalled a return to form with his 62 against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). In Abhishek Porel, Karun Nair, Axar Patel, Tristan Stubss and the dangerous Ashutosh Sharma and Vipraj Nigam, their batting has enough firepower to put SRH bowling to the test.Abhishek Porel, Faf du Plessis, KL Rahul, Karun Nair, Axar Patel, Tristan Stubbs, Ashutosh Sharma, Vipraj Nigam, Mitchell Starc, Dushmantha Chameera, Mukesh Kumar, Kuldeep Yadav.Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Heinrich Klaasen, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Aniket Verma, Kamindu Mendis, Pat Cummins, Harshal Patel, Mohd Shami, Zeeshan Ansari, Abhinav Manohar.","Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) host Delhi Capitals (DC) on Monday.

Exit comes with frustration over creative direction

WWE star Shotzi has confirmed that her time with the company is coming to an end. While she has not been formally released like several other names in WWE’s recent roster cuts, her contract will not be renewed when it expires in July. In a now-deleted post on X (formerly Twitter), Shotzi wrote, “Just to clarify, I still have a good amount of time on my contract. But come July I will be full time balls to the walls!”Shotzi’s profile has already been moved to the Alumni section of WWE.com, signaling her eventual departure from the promotion. The 32-year-old performer has been with WWE since 2019 and gained popularity in NXT before making her way to the main roster.While Shotzi expressed gratitude for her time in WWE, she also took a parting shot at how her talent was utilized. Quote-posting her final match on WWE Speed from February 2025, she wrote, “Can’t wait to wrestle for a lot longer than 3 minutes.”The post referenced her bout against Zoey Stark, which ended in a short loss - symbolic of what she implied was limited screen time during her WWE run.Responding to a fan who accused her of only caring now that the checks have stopped, Shotzi fired back, “I never gave a sh*t about the money and that’s the truth.”Her comments reflect a wider sense of frustration that has become common among wrestlers who feel underutilized in a crowded roster.Looking ahead, Shotzi is already teasing her next move. She asked fans for suggestions on their favorite independent wrestlers and promotions, stating, “I want to wrestle EVERYONE!”The message was well-received, with AEW star Abadon responding with an in-character GIF, seemingly hinting at a potential feud.Meanwhile, TNA’s AJ Francis extended an open invitation for Shotzi to join his faction ""First Class"" alongside other recently released stars like Dakota Kai and Oro Mensah.Whether she heads to AEW, TNA, or the global indie scene, it’s clear Shotzi is ready to start fresh on her own terms.While she has a few months left under WWE contract, the countdown has begun. Her departure adds to the growing list of major changes in WWE’s women’s division and raises questions about how the company manages its deep talent pool.For Shotzi, however, this seems less like an ending and more like the beginning of an unfiltered, unapologetic return to her wrestling roots.",WWE star Shotzi has confirmed that her time with the company is coming to an end.

LONDON: Over 30 years after Britain's elite Magic Circle expelled a woman for posing as a man to gain admittance, the formerly male-only society is to welcome her back as a full member.The London-based international magic organisation ejected Sophie Lloyd after she masqueraded as a male in 1991 to win membership.But after her story came to light last year, the society's first female chair Laura London launched a search to track down Lloyd and apologise.She was eventually located living abroad and will later on Thursday be presented with a membership certificate at a special ceremony at the organisation's London headquarters.""It is so exciting after all these months tracking Sophie... I can't tell you how happy we are as a society to welcome her back into the fold,"" London told BBC radio.Lloyd posed as Raymond Lloyd for 18 months before unmasking herself as a woman.But members, who voted to admit women in September 1991, were so angered by her ""deliberate deception"" that they went ahead with her expulsion.The deception was in fact a two-person act involving the late magician Jenny Winstanley, who recruited Lloyd to help her prove that women magicians were just as good as men.""I did a 20-minute show in front of 200 people, three examiners, and spoke to the examiner for an hour-and-three-quarters afterwards,"" Lloyd said, recalling how she managed to pull the wool over everyone's eyes.After the Magic Circle changed its stance on allowing women in, Winstanley, who died in 2004, phoned the society to explain.""Two days later we got a letter to say Raymond's been expelled,"" said Lloyd.""We couldn't get our heads round it. We just thought, 'come on it's funny, it's amusing' but they didn't think so and Jenny was completely snubbed, unfortunately.""After the expulsion, Lloyd continued to perform magic for 11 years in an anti-bullying variety show before eventually moving overseas.She said the Magic Circle had changed out of all recognition in the 30 years since she was thrown out, adding: ""This is for Jenny really, Jenny would have loved it.""London said Thursday's ceremony would also be a chance to recognise Winstanley both for her contribution to magic and her audacious trick at the Magic Circle's expense.""I just think she's a wonderful woman and I know she'd have loved to be here and I just wish more than anything I could have met her myself,"" she said.The Magic Circle was founded in 1905 by around 20 magicians at a restaurant in London's Chinatown district.Members must vow never to give away the secrets of magic.Although women have now been admitted to the Magic Circle for over 30 years, they still make up only around five percent of the society's 1,700 membership.The body says, however, that increasing numbers are now coming through in the 10-18-year-old age group.","Sophie Lloyd was expelled from the Magic Circle after posing as a man to gain admittance.

SRH vs DC IPL 2025, Hyderabad weather prediction

Delhi Capitals will aim to revive their playoff hopes and arrest a two-match losing streak at home when they face a struggling Sunrisers Hyderabad in a must-win IPL 2025 clash on Monday. Axar Patel’s side, currently fifth with 12 points from 10 games, have relied heavily on away wins but will need to find form in familiar conditions to stay in the top-four race.Axar, who bruised his left hand in the previous game against KKR but still smashed a valiant 43, remains a fitness concern. His full bowling involvement could be key, especially against an SRH side all but out of playoff contention after a 38-run loss to Gujarat Titans.While KL Rahul and Abhishek Porel have led DC's batting, their inability to accelerate at crucial moments has been costly. However, Mitchell Starc and Mukesh Kumar form a potent attack, with Axar's presence adding balance.SRH, despite big names like Pat Cummins, Mohammed Shami, Travis Head, and Heinrich Klaasen, have failed to click. Pacer Jaydev Unadkat pointed to inconsistent bowling and pitch conditions as major hurdles.With both teams desperate for points, the match promises high stakes and intensity at Arun Jaitley Stadium.A scorching day in Hyderabad, and the pitch is an absolute belter. Dry, hard, and full of runs, it promises a high-scoring contest with a par score expected around 220–230. The dimensions offer some imbalance — 63 meters to the right, 70 to the left, and 77 down the ground — giving batters plenty to target. While the surface heavily favours batters, both sides possess quality seamers who could make early inroads. The only grass lies behind the stumps, offering no real help to bowlers. Dew hasn't played a major role at this venue, so the toss is unlikely to be decisive.Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Aniket Verma, Kamindu Mendis, Pat Cummins (c), Harshal Patel, Jaydev Unadkat, Zeeshan Ansari, Mohammed ShamiImpact Player – Travis HeadFaf du Plessis, Abishek Porel (wk), Karun Nair, KL Rahul, Axar Patel (c), Tristan Stubbs, Vipraj Nigam, Mitchell Starc, Kuldeep Yadav, Dushmantha Chameera, Mukesh KumarImpact Player - Sameer RizviPat Cummins (c), Ishan Kishan (wk), Atharva Taide, Abhinav Manohar, Aniket Verma, Sachin Baby, Smaran Ravichandran, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Travis Head, Harshal Patel, Kamindu Mendis, Wiaan Mulder, Abhishek Sharma, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Mohammed Shami, Rahul Chahar, Simarjeet Singh, Zeeshan Ansari, Jaydev Unadkat, Eshan Malinga.Axar Patel (c), Jake Fraser-McGurk, Abishek Porel, Karun Nair, KL Rahul (wk), Tristan Stubbs, Ashutosh Sharma, Vipraj Nigam, Mitchell Starc, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohit Sharma, Mukesh Kumar, Sameer Rizvi, Darshan Nalkande, Donovan Ferreira, Tripurana Vijay, Dushmantha Chameera, Faf du Plessis, T Natarajan, Ajay Jadav Mandal, Manvanth Kumar L, Madhav Tiwari.Played: 25SRH wins: 13DC wins: 12Hyderabad will see mostly sunny conditions through the day following late-night showers.

Poll What do you think was the biggest factor in LSG's defeat against PBKS? Strong PBKS Batting Poor Batting Performance Misjudged Conditions Dropped Catches

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 4: Prof. Ratnakar Shetty on BCCI, cricket politics & Indian cricket's growth

NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) find themselves in a precarious position in the Indian Premier League IPL ) 2025 after succumbing to a 37-run defeat against Punjab Kings (PBKS) at the HPCA Stadium on Sunday.The loss marks LSG’s sixth of the season, leaving them seventh on the points table with 10 points from 11 games. With just three league matches remaining, they now face a must-win scenario to stay alive in the playoff race.Following the high-scoring clash, LSG skipper Rishabh Pant did not mince words as he pointed to dropped catches as the turning point of the game. “Definitely too many runs. When you're gonna drop crucial catches at the wrong time, it is going to hurt you badly,” Pant said in the post-match presentation.Pant further reflected on the match, highlighting that LSG had misjudged the conditions early on and failed to adapt swiftly. “We thought it was going to do more.

Despite late fightbacks from Ayush Badoni (74) and Abdul Samad (45), LSG managed only 199/7 in reply.Pant acknowledged lack of support to the top order. “In every match, you can't hope they will come off nicely… We need to take the game deep. Every time, they can't do the heavy job for us,” he said.With PBKS rising to second place with 15 points, LSG will need to fix their fielding lapses and deliver flawless performances in their final three games to remain in the hunt.","Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) lost to Punjab Kings (PBKS) by 37 runs on Sunday.

""Yes it could have been dealt with better, we suffered a bit, but it's a nice victory.""""We had a very good first half (but)... we fell apart, these things can't happen, it's happened to us a lot,"" Real Madrid midfielder Fede Valverde said on the club's television channel.

NEW DELHI: Just days after lighting up the cricket world with a jaw-dropping 35-ball century, 14-year-old Rajasthan Royals prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi has once again stunned fans — but this time, not with the bat.The young sensation from Samastipur, Bihar, who smashed 11 sixes in a whirlwind knock at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur, became an overnight star. His innings, against an attack featuring the likes of Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Washington Sundar, Rashid Khan, and Karim Janat, was the second-fastest century in tournament history.Now, ahead of Royals' IPL 2025 clash against Kolkata Knight Riders on Sunday, Suryavanshi turned heads again — but this time during a net session with the ball in hand.In a stunning moment, the teen bowled to a batter in the nets and produced massive turn, shattering the stumps clean in half. Teammates and staff were left in disbelief at the sheer skill and impact of the delivery.From a batting sensation to a potential all-rounder in the making, Suryavanshi’s talent continues to amaze — and he's only 14.RR bowling coach Shane Bond had revealed that the team management is ‘protecting’ the young star.“The coaching staff haven’t tried to complicate things too much with Vaibhav. He’s sort of got a bit of a license to go out and just play, which he’s done an amazing job so far, really, for a 14-year-old. So look again, he missed out in the last game, but for us, you don’t really want to panic with someone so young, you just come out and plug in tomorrow,"" Bond said at the pre-match press conference.“I know Vikram (Rathour) talks about his game plans and the type of bowlers that he’s going to come up against and he’ll do that again for this match, but outside of that, he’s a pretty young kid, so I’m just happy for him to get out there and keep swinging. It’ll be that again,"" he added.“He’s (Vaibhav) obviously a seriously talented player, but he’s also still a kid. So, he’s sort of learning on the go, we’re going to be really patient with him because you have to be. And the other part of it is just all the off-field stuff, the travel (and such), you can’t expect a 14-year-old to be a professional. Like I’ve got a 16-year-old son and he’s a teenager, so we’re just trying to educate him on the things around and look after him, shield him a little bit from the social media stuff and all the trappings that come with the way he started, but he’s a lovely kid,"" Bond said.","14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi has once again stunned fans with the bat.
