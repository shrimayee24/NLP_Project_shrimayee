"Rishi Sunak: For Sunak, a trip to Mumbai not complete sans game of cricket",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-sunak-a-trip-to-mumbai-not-complete-sans-game-of-cricket/articleshow/117867732.cms,"MUMBAI: Former UK prime minister Rishi Sunak visited Parsee Gymkhana at Marine Drive in Mumbai on Sunday morning to play tennis ball cricket . The landmark gymkhana, the first such community sports club to come up on the city's coast in the late 19th century, celebrates its 140th anniversary this month.History turned a full circle as Sunak went to the crease. In 2022, when he became the first person of Indian origin - indeed the first non-white person - to occupy the post of Britain's PM, headlines around the world screamed: 'The Empire Strikes Back'. More on that theme played out on Sunday when he faced local boys on land that was acquired by the gymkhana from the colonial govt at the height of its power.""Great to be here at the Parsee Gymkhana club (to mark its) 140th year anniversary celebrations. What extraordinary achievement. So much history here and so much exciting stuff to come. I managed not to get out too many times this morning. Thanks for having me and I look forward to coming back,"" said Sunak, who met gymkhana members and interacted with boy scouts.Khodadad Yazdegardi, gymkhana vice-president and its cricket secretary, said, ""When we heard that Sunak was going to the Oval Maidan, a common friend arranged his visit to the gymkhana. We gave him a brief history of the gymkhana and how the land was acquired from the British govt. We told him about the first Indian cricket team, all Parsis, that went to play in England in 1886.""Sunak spent about 45 minutes at the gymkhana and also met boys from the 16th East Zoroastrian Bharat Scout group, who assemble on the grounds on Sundays. ""His batting stance showed that he must have been a cricket player in his youth,"" Yazdegardi said about Sunak.""No trip to Mumbai would be complete without a game of tennis ball cricket,"" Sunak posted on X. He proceeded to CCI at Churchgate for breakfast and was scheduled to watch the India-England T20 match at Wankhede Stadium on Sunday evening.Born to parents of Indian descent who emigrated to Britain from East Africa, Sunak was the youngest PM of the UK in over 200 years. His term lasted nearly two years until Nov 2024 when the Labour Party swept the elections. He remains a Conservative MP, having stepped down as leader of the opposition.","Rishi Sunak visited Parsee Gymkhana at Marine Drive in Mumbai on Sunday morning.

Shilo Sanders Embraces Criticism, Compares Himself to Donald Trump Amid NFL Draft Scrutiny



Colorado safety Shilo Sanders has never been one to shy away from controversy, and his recent response to criticism proves just that. Following the East-West Shrine Bowl , where clips of his struggles in practice surfaced online, Sanders took a unique approach to defending himself—by drawing a comparison to former President Donald Trump.In an interview addressing viral footage that highlighted his coverage missteps, Sanders pushed back against the negativity, suggesting that the criticism he faces is part of a broader pattern seen in public figures. “If you just hate me or want to hate me ... paint me in a bad picture; they do that to our President,"" Sanders said. ""They do that to everybody. So I’m not going to be safe from it. But it does get aggravating whenever you put in that work, and you’re working on your craft, and there’s people just steadily destroying you.”Despite the viral clips painting a less-than-ideal picture of his performance, Sanders remained steadfast in his confidence, attributing the negativity to selective editing. “According to Shilo, the negative plays were merely ‘cherry-picked’ in an attempt to discredit his ability.” He emphasized that his focus remains on the evaluations of NFL scouts, his family, and his father, Deion Sanders.His resilience isn’t surprising, given that his father, Deion, has also drawn bold comparisons in the past. Following a loss to Nebraska last season, the elder Sanders made headlines when he likened his experience to that of Jesus Christ. “When you lose, you're going to be ridiculed, you're going to be prosecuted and persecuted and I'm good,” Deion said. “I've been on the cross for a long time and I'm still hanging.”Shilo, much like his father, seems to embrace the idea that scrutiny comes with the spotlight. His response to criticism, however, is not just about defiance—it also underscores his belief that he has put in the work to succeed.Shilo Sanders’ journey to the NFL has been anything but conventional. After starting his college career at South Carolina, he transferred to Jackson State to play under his father before ultimately following him to Colorado. Over his collegiate career, he started 25 games, recording 99 tackles, six passes defended, and one interception.His performance in the actual Shrine Bowl game was solid, with six tackles and a pass defended, even as his team suffered a 25-0 loss. However, his draft stock remains uncertain, as he continues to train for the NFL Combine with hopes of running a 4.40-second 40-yard dash. While his younger brother, Shedeur Sanders , is expected to be a top pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, Shilo is projected as a late-round selection.Also Read: Travis Kelce received a $11,255 fine from the NFL for taunting during the AFC championship game Despite the skepticism surrounding his draft stock, Shilo remains focused on his goals. He understands that his name alone won’t secure him a spot in the league, but his determination and work ethic may yet prove his critics wrong. Sanders is projected to be a Day 3 pick in the 2025 NFL Draft.","Colorado safety Shilo Sanders responded to criticism of his performance at the East-West Shrine Bowl.

Tom Brady fires back at Greg Olsen’s criticism of his $375M FOX deal in two words,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tom-brady-fires-back-at-greg-olsens-criticism-of-his-375m-fox-deal-in-two-words/articleshow/117837684.cms,"Tom Brady (via: pinterest.com)

A new era for FOX Sports - Olsen’s fall and Brady’s rise



Greg Olsen Opens Up about Getting Demoted for Brady - Barstool Rundown - January 30th, 2025

Is Greg Olsen holding any grudges against Tom Brady? Absolutely not



Greg Olsen’s sudden fall from FOX Sports ’ top analyst role has raised eyebrows. After FOX signed Tom Brady to a massive $375 million deal, Olsen was bumped down to a secondary role. While it makes sense to make room for the GOAT, Olsen had already established himself as one of the sport’s leading voices, making his demotion all the more painful.Greg Olsen’s surprising fall from the top analyst spot at FOX Sports to a secondary role is stirring up tension in the broadcast booth. Shocking? Not quite. After FOX handed Tom Brady a jaw-dropping $375 million contract to become their lead analyst, Olsen was sidelined. Sure, making room for the GOAT seems fair, but here’s the twist: Greg Olsen had already solidified himself as one of the top voices in the game.You can see why this would sting. After all the hard work, proving his worth, Olsen suddenly finds himself outshined by a seven-time Super Bowl champ stepping in to take his spot. Understandably, Olsen wasn't thrilled about the shakeup.Meanwhile, Brady is playing it cool, classic TB12. Instead of engaging in drama, he subtly let his Instagram do the talking. Sharing a quote that said, “Maybe you don’t notice your progress because you’re always raising your bar,” he added a simple “Love this” caption. In other words, “I’m here, I’m working, and I don’t care about the noise.”But here's the kicker: during Brady's debut as an analyst in Week 1, fans weren’t exactly impressed. Many criticized his commentary as “amateurish” and his delivery as “colorless.” Meanwhile, Olsen, who had been a fan favorite and a ratings magnet, found himself on the sidelines.Olsen, however, hasn’t been shy about his future goals. “I’m going to call big-time games again; I’m going to call Super Bowl games again,” he told The Athletic. He’s confident, and with good reason.The real question: Is there tension between Olsen and Brady? The heat is on, but does Brady want the job long-term? He knows football, but can he deliver captivating commentary? If he falters, will FOX reconsider? With Brady’s role as a minority owner of the Raiders, this is more than just competition, it’s a subplot that has everyone watching.Greg Olsen has every reason to be frustrated. After working hard to earn his spot, he watched it snatched away by none other than Tom Brady. It’s the harsh reality of the business.In 2023, Olsen was named Outstanding Emerging On-Air Talent, covered Super Bowl LVII, and won an Outstanding Event Analyst award at the 2024 Sports Emmys. His transition from player to analyst was seamless, fans loved his insightful, natural delivery with Kevin Burkhardt. But when Brady arrived, Olsen was relegated to the No. 2 team by FOX.He’s not exactly angry, but it’s clear the situation stings. “I don’t think resentment [towards Tom Brady] is probably accurate, but I also think it’s not too far off if I’m being honest,” he admitted. While still close with Burkhardt and Erin Andrews, watching someone else take his Super Bowl spot hurts.FOX’s recent Super Bowl LIX announcement only added salt to the wound, Brady, Burkhardt, and Andrews in New Orleans, and Olsen left out. But Olsen and Brady aren’t enemies. The two have had several personal conversations, with Olsen offering support: “I told him, ‘Dude, I’m here to help in whatever way I can… I understand the transition you’re making because it’s the same transition I did.’” (via: EssentiallySports)The difference? Olsen nailed his transition. Brady? The verdict’s still out. Olsen is confident he'll call Super Bowl games again. The only question is where. FOX? Another network? That part remains to be seen.",Greg Olsen was demoted from the top analyst spot at FOX Sports to a secondary role. Tom Brady was signed to a $375 million contract by the network.

Could Aaron Rodgers join Tom Brady's Raiders?

Critics argue that the Raiders’ acquisition of Aaron Rodgers will only help in short-term goals

Las Vegas Raiders sit at a crossroads with their quarterback situation: two current options in Gardner Minshew and Aidan O'Connell, but neither being considered good enough. They are considering acquiring Aaron Rodgers, but the experts have already made it known that accepting a move to Raiders might not serve him well, thus negatively impacting his legacy. Success may not be quick to come in this competitive AFC West division; thus, the Raiders must be careful in their decision-making.According to reports, Jets and quarterback Aaron Rodgers are discussing the possibility of a split in 2025. Although there is a speculation of him landing with the Raiders, NFL analysts do not see the move as making much sense for them because he would be an upgrade and the best short-term option.Critics argue that the acquisition of Aaron Rodgers will only help short-term goals, while the overall vision for his legacy will be thwarted by the move, although it will surely strengthen the present roster. According to Mike Florio, an NFL analyst, the Raiders need a quarterback upgrade, but Aaron Rodgers has limited work ahead.""While he'd be an upgrade over who they currently have — and possibly the best short-term option they'll find — the move makes little sense for Rodgers,"" Florio wrote as per NBC Sports.Florio predicted an 8-9 record for the Raiders with Rodgers as center but warned of fierce competition for a playoff spot. He suggested better options for the four-time NFL MVP include the Tennessee Titans, Pittsburgh Steelers, and New Orleans Saints. The Saints would help him avoid playoff matches with Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, or Joe Burrow.Rodgers played 17 games in 2024 despite playing only four snaps last season. He led the Jets to five victories and threw for 3,897 yards with 28 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. Even without Davante Adams, Rodgers won only one more game than the rebuilding New England Patriots.The Raiders have to assess their roster and strategy in the offseason regarding such a possible Aaron Rodgers trade or cut towards being a competitive team to win in the playoffs.

Noah Lyles Fires Back at Tyreek Hill After 60m Victory



After clinching victory in the 60-meter final at the New Balance Indoor Grand Prix on Sunday, Olympian Noah Lyles sent a playful message to Miami Dolphins' Tyreek Hill . The rivalry between the two, which began months ago when they exchanged taunts about who would win in a race, reignited with Lyles taking another shot at the star receiver. Lyles made sure Hill knew the ""beef is back,"" further fueling their friendly competition. The track star's lighthearted trolling keeps the race between the two as thrilling as ever.Noah Lyles has sparked yet another round of friendly banter with NFL star Tyreek Hill after dominating the 60-meter final at the New Balance Indoor Grand Prix. Lyles, always ready to stir the pot, pulled out a sign post-race that read, ""Tyreek could never,"" a direct jab at the Miami Dolphins wide receiver. Hill, never one to shy away from a challenge, responded quickly on social media with a laughing emoji and the words, ""Get a load of this guy.""This playful feud between Lyles, an Olympic sprinter, and Hill, nicknamed “the Cheetah,” has been going on for months. Hill, who is known for his incredible speed on the football field, has repeatedly claimed that he could outrun Lyles in a race. However, many, including Lyles himself, believe Hill is simply seeking attention with these bold claims. During a post-race interview with NBC Sports, Lyles fired back, saying, ""When you’re ready to actually put some words down and you’re actually ready to race, see me. I’m right here. I ain’t going nowhere. But all I know is, your football season’s over. You ain’t got no excuse now.""The back-and-forth between the two is far from new. Last August, Lyles appeared on the ""Nightcap Show"" with Shannon Sharpe and Chad Ochocinco, where he said, “Tyreek is just chasing clout. Anytime somebody fast comes up, he says he wants to race them. If he really wanted to race people, he would have showed up like DK Metcalf.” The tension has only grown since then, with both Lyles and Hill challenging each other to a race following Lyles’ triumph at the 2024 Paris Olympics.For Lyles, the challenge is more than just personal bragging rights. ""I’m trying to transcend the sport,"" he told NBC Sports on February 2. ""And my first job is to make sure everybody knows that even though I won the medal, I go everywhere, and I’m going to win because I’m the world’s fastest man."" His personal best of 6.43 in the 60m, compared to Hill’s 6.70 at the 2023 USA Track and Field Masters Indoor Championships, adds further fuel to the fire. If this race ever happens, it would surely draw a massive audience, as fans eagerly await to see who can truly claim the title of the world’s fastest.Also Read: ""I found my deeper well"": Joe Burrow’s ex-girlfriend Olivia Holzmacher opens up about their breakup after long silence The ball is now in Hill’s court to answer Lyles' challenge.","Olympian Noah Lyles and NFL star Tyreek Hill have been feuding for months.

What does Shubman Gill's horoscope say about his captaincy future

NEW DELHI: MI Cape Town secured a dominant bonus-point victory over the Pretoria Capitals on Sunday, reinforcing their position as the SA20 table-toppers for Season 3.The win at Newlands completed a flawless home record for Robin Peterson 's side, making them only the second team after the Paarl Royals to remain unbeaten at home.Their emphatic 95-run win over the Capitals ensured MI Cape Town finished the league stage with a record 35 points. Despite making six changes to their lineup, the home side controlled proceedings from the outset. A blistering 133-run opening stand between Sediqullah Atal and Connor Esterhuizen showcased MI Cape Town’s incredible batting depth.Esterhuizen smashed 69 off 43 balls, including six fours and three sixes, while left-hander Sediqullah dazzled the Newlands crowd with a stunning 77 off 46 balls, featuring four fours and six sixes. A quickfire 15-ball 26 from Delano Potgieter propelled MI Cape Town to 201/5—the highest total at Newlands this season.The Capitals’ chase suffered an immediate setback when off-spinner Dane Piedt removed Will Jacks with the first ball. Playing his first SA20 game for his hometown franchise, Piedt celebrated with a euphoric sprint towards the Railway Stand. He finished with figures of 3/28, earning the Player of the Match accolade. Leg-spinner Thomas Kaber (3/21) and left-arm spinner George Linde (2/11) completed a commanding spin performance, as MI Cape Town’s trio combined for 8/60, bundling the Capitals out for just 106 in 14 overs.Speaking after the match, MI Cape Town head coach Robin Peterson emphasised the team’s aggressive batting philosophy. “Conditions have been challenging, but I feel that sometimes, as bad as they can be, you might limit yourself a little. Even though the conditions can be tough, you have to find ways to put big totals on the board. What we’ve tried to do is aim for a strong total rather than play too conservatively—we set our sights on a match-winning score with the bat. That’s something the batters have fully bought into.”Reflecting on their struggles, Pretoria Capitals’ Keagan Lion-Cachet admitted, “We all know how cricket works. It’s one of those sports where it’s so unpredictable, you never know what’s going to happen. Unfortunately, this tournament didn’t go our way, so we’ve got a lot to learn, and hopefully, we can improve individually and as a team next year.”MI Cape Town will now face the Paarl Royals in Qualifier 1 at St George’s Park on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: India's head coach, Gautam Gambhir , praised his team for using ""high-risk, high-reward cricket"" to win the series against England 4-1 while laying out the plan to routinely score 250-plus runs in Twenty20 Internationals.The previous three Twenty20 Internationals between India and England demonstrated the country's philosophy of playing aggressive cricket regardless of the circumstances.England pacer Saqib Mahmood destroyed India in Pune by taking three wickets and adding a maiden in the second over.India's batsmen maintained the pressure and assaulted the English bowlers to finish their innings with a valiant score of 181/9, which was too much for the tourists to handle.Despite wickets falling from the other end on Sunday in Mumbai, Abhishek Sharma went all guns blazing, leading the hosts to a record-breaking 247/9, which is India's fourth-highest total in the format.""That's the kind of T20 cricket we want to play. We don't want to fear losing a game of cricket. We want to play high-risk, high-reward cricket and these guys have adopted that ideology, that policy really well. And I think the ideology of this T20 team is based on selflessness and fearlessness. And I think in the last six months, these guys have done it day in, day out,"" Gambhir told the host broadcaster.""We want to try and get to 250-260 regularly. And in trying to do that, there'll be games where we'll get bundled out for 120-130. And that is what T20 cricket is all about. And unless and until you don't play that high-risk cricket, you won't get those big rewards as well. Most importantly, I think we're on the right track. Come those big tournaments, we want to still continue playing this way, and we don't want to fear losing anything,"" he added.The failure of England to understand Varun Chakravarthy 's spin was a major factor in India's victory. The English batsmen were still baffled by the Indian mystery spinner.With a staggering 14 wickets at an average of 9.85 and an economy rate of 7.66, he concluded the series at the top of the wicket-taking rankings.""I think his transformation from IPL to international T20 cricket has been phenomenal. And this series was probably the benchmark as well because England is a high-quality side. They've got some really quality cricketers and the kind of surfaces we've played on - I think they were fantastic batting wickets, and the way he's bowled those tough overs has been phenomenal,"" Gambhir said of Varun.","India coach Gautam Gambhir praises his team for playing ""high-risk, high-reward cricket"" India beat England 4-1 to win the series in Twenty20 Internationals.

Career and personal life

Bonnie Blue , a 25-year-old OnlyFans creator from Derbyshire , claims to have set a world record by having sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours, reports Daily Mail.The event took place in London, allegedly surpassing the previous record of 919 men in 24 hours set by adult actress Lisa Sparks in 2004, with Bonnie claiming she ""bedded 1,057 in 12 hours.""In a video shared on TikTok, Bonnie thanked those who participated, saying, “Thank you to all the barely legal, barely breathing and the husbands.”She added that her skin looked better after the event and described the experience: “The room was absolutely full. We did groups of five, like one after the other. It was a rotating circle.”Her PR team confirmed the tally, stating, “She slept with 1,057 people. As she hit 1,000, there were still 57 left in the queue who Bonnie wanted to pleasure before ending the 12-hour day.” Calculations suggest she averaged 41 seconds per partner.The stunt sparked outrage online, with comments such as “How embarrassing” and “Sad that men would want to do that too—all for fame and money.” Bonnie is no stranger to controversy, having previously defended her claims of sleeping with “barely legal” 18-year-olds and encouraging men to cheat on their wives.Bonnie's real name is Tia Billinger , who says she earns up to £750,000 a month from her OnlyFans content. Despite criticism, she insists her work is educational. “I can’t think of one situation where an 18-year-old has had sex where they’ve had to bring a passport, sign consent forms, and do a breathalyser,” she said on ITV’s This Morning.She also addressed criticism for sleeping with married men, arguing, “If wives aren’t going to pleasure husbands, let them go elsewhere. It’s just an act; the husbands mean nothing to me.”Bonnie transitioned to sex work after moving to Australia in 2022 with her now ex-husband, Oliver Davidson. Formerly a recruitment professional, she launched her career as a cam girl and later joined OnlyFans.She claims her family now supports her career, with her mother even assisting her business by booking appointments and handing out condoms for marketing. “It’s changed their life completely for the better,” she said.Bonnie defended her actions, stating, “These 18-year-olds can go to the army, they can drive, they can drink… If they want to use their own bodies to come and sleep with me, that is their decision.”","Bonnie Blue, 25, claims to have had sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours.

However, they both managed to maintain their joint-leading position with 5.5 points apiece.In the opening game of the tiebreak, Praggnanandhaa met Benoni in reverse colors, and it appeared that he had easily equalized in the middle game. But Praggnanandhaa made a mistake that cost him a full rook, and Gukesh had other ideas as he continued to try and prevailed.Praggnanandhaa used the Trompowsky opening in the second game of the tiebreaker, which Gukesh had to win, and this time he had a small edge with his black pieces.By simply holding his position, Praggnanandhaa calmly waited and took advantage of an unintentional mistake made by his opponent to first knock down a pawn. His technical skills were subsequently sufficient to win the typical blitz games 1-1.Praggnanandhaa drew white as a result, and Gukesh once again outplayed him with some creative play on the queen side, winning him a pawn. This put the match in sudden death.Praggnanandhaa attempted to defend a weaker ending despite the sudden-death having a time limit of two minutes and thirty seconds for white and three for black.Gukesh lost total control in the battle of nerves and lost a piece and then his lone knight just as the position appeared to be absolutely drawn and another game was imminent.With flawless technique, Praggnanandhaa won his first Masters title and the entire point.Gukesh lost the tiebreaker after tying for top place for the second consecutive year.

NEW DELHI: The Dubai Capitals defeated the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders by an incredible 26 runs on Sunday at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, thanks to David Warner 's brilliant batting, which sent them into the ILT20 Season 3 playoffs. The Dubai Capitals secured their playoffs berth with the victory, making them the fourth and final team to do so.In his season-opening game, Warner was the game-changer, leading the Dubai Capitals to their sixth victory in seven games against the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders with an incredible undefeated 93.The Knight Riders had a difficult time chasing a high total of 218 because they needed to win the match outright to be in the running. Their batters started off cagey, but once they got going, they were unstoppable. At the conclusion of the powerplay, Andries Gous led his team to 50/0 after smashing six boundaries in 11 deliveries. Kyle Mayers put some clutch boundaries after setting the pace for the chase.The Knight Riders appeared well-positioned at 89/0 at the midway point, with both batters blazing, and Gous and Mayers formed the cornerstone of their pursuit. But Gulbadin Naib outwitted Mayers with a brilliant bowling change, giving the Capitals a way back into the match. Naib bounced back from being struck for a huge six in the previous ball to deceive Mayers with a slower delivery, preventing the West Indian from reaching 50 after falling for an incredible 42 off 29.Gous was on 55 when Joe Clarke joined him, and the American stepped it up. The Knight Riders reached 122/1 in 13 overs and required 96 runs from the last 42 deliveries when he hit two consecutive sixes off Ahmad, the first over long-on and the second straight over the bowler's head.The big-hitting Andre Russell took Clarke's place after he retired injured shortly after smashing an incredible 91-meter six over long-on. But following a brilliant 17th over from Dushmantha Chameera , the Knight Riders unexpectedly had two fresh batters at the crease, and the momentum shifted in the Capitals' favor. The first player out was Gous, who was caught at mid-wicket for a 78 off 47 while attempting to reach a maximum. The West Indian was out on his first ball, proving that the Knight Riders' plan to retire Clarke and bring on Russell was a failure.The Knight Riders were stuck at 153/5, requiring 65 runs in 18 balls, and David Willey was dismissed after making only one run, giving the Capitals even more cause to celebrate. The Dubai Capitals won by a resounding 26 runs, proving that it was too huge a target to pursue. At the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, this was the first time in seven games that the team batting first had won.Shai Hope and Warner, the Dubai Capitals' openers, both appeared to be in excellent form as they got off to a fast start. Despite Willey's incredible stretch in which he conceded just 11 runs in three overs, the Capitals rushed to 43/0 inside the powerplay as the pair alternated in hitting the boundaries.When Warner holed out in the seventh over, the Knight Riders came very close to winning, but Russell was unable to hold onto the catch. To get underway, Warner took advantage of the reprieve by smashing Gudakesh Motie for four boundaries in the following over. After that, Hope hit two sixes before being bowled by Roston Chase, ending the opening wicket stand at 82 runs.Warner went on to reach his half-century in 33 deliveries, surpassing all other batters in the world with the 116th 50+ score of his career in Twenty20 cricket. The Capitals had 111 runs after 12 overs when the daring Australian attacked the opposition spinners, striking Sunil Narine for a huge six. They were headed for a 200+ total with a good 9+ run rate.Naib raced to 27 runs off 15 deliveries with a couple of huge hits, keeping the scorekeepers busy. Due to poor fielding by the Knight Riders, Alishan Sharafu dropped Naib in the fifteenth over. The Afghan player then hit two huge sixes off Jason Holder to help his team approach a huge total.Naib was removed for an incredible 47 off 25 balls as Narine immediately returned to the attack. After only two deliveries, Rovman Powell was replaced by Dasun Shanaka, who helped the Capitals score even more runs. The Sri Lankan made a spectacular cameo, scoring 17 runs off of only seven balls before destroying Holder in the last over to help the Capitals to a huge 217/4. The Capitals scored the best total in the history of the competition in Dubai, and Warner remained undefeated at 93.","Dubai Capitals defeated the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders by an incredible 26 runs on Sunday at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.

Playing with the white pieces, the Indian youngster opened with a King’s Pawn, leading to a classic Italian Game. The early exchanges were sharp, with both players castling by move five.A major turning point came when Gukesh sacrificed Wei’s queen with Qxd8, forcing an immediate response (Rfxd8) from the Chinese grandmaster.As the game approached the endgame phase, both players had a rook each — Gukesh relied on his bishop, while Wei Yi looked to create complications with his knight.However, neither could break through, leading to a handshake and a draw.With this result, Gukesh maintained his position at the top of the Masters standings as the sole leader with 8/11 points.The biggest shock of the round came when Praggnanandhaa outplayed top-seed Caruana in a masterful display. Playing with the black pieces, Pragg responded to Caruana’s English Opening with the Agincourt Defense, gradually seizing control of the board.The battle remained evenly poised until Caruana’s misstep on move 32 (Qe3), which allowed Praggnanandhaa to unleash a devastating knight manoeuvre.Within just five more moves, Pragg had sealed a stunning 37-move victory, handing Caruana another shocking defeat in what has been a topsy-turvey tournament so far for the American.With the aforementioned results on Friday, Gukesh overtook Caruana in the live ratings, securing the World No. 3 spot with 2793.2 Elo points, while Caruana slipped to 2792.4.One of the day’s most intriguing results saw Leon Luke Mendonca secure his first win of the tournament by toppling Vladimir Fedoseev of Slovenia.Fedoseev, having gained popularity as the ""giant killer"" after beating Arjun Erigaisi, Caruana, Vincent Keymer, and Pentala Harikrishna, found himself on the receiving end this time.

'One of the worst rules in the game': Sunil Gavaskar on concussion substitute rule,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/england-tour-of-india-2025/one-of-the-worst-rules-in-the-game-sunil-gavaskar-on-concussion-substitute-rule/articleshow/117854690.cms,"NEW DELHI: The selection of Harshit Rana as a concussion substitution for Shivam Dube during the fourth Twenty20 International in Pune, according to legendary Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar , was not like-for-like and detracted from the hosts' victory.Harshit, who is mainly a pacer, took Dube's place after the all-rounder had a concussion while batting in the last over after Jamie Overton struck him on his helmet.Rana, who made his T20I debut, took 3-33 in his four overs and was instrumental in India defending 182 and taking unbeatable series lead. The England captain, Jos Buttler , too voiced his displeasure with the Dube-Rana swap.""In the Pune game, Dube batted right till the end after having got hit on the helmet earlier, so clearly, he was not concussed. So, allowing a concussion substitute itself was not correct. Yes, there could have been a substitute in case he had strained a muscle while batting, but that would have been only for fielding and he could not have bowled.""Even by the most generous stretching of the like-for-like term, there was nothing such between Dube and Rana. With tongue firmly in cheek, one can say that they are the same height and have the same standard in fielding.""Otherwise, there's nothing like-for-like as far as they are concerned. England have every reason to feel done in. This Indian team are a superb team and doesn't need its wins to get tarnished by such acts,"" wrote Gavaskar in his column for mid-day on Sunday.India will look to win the series 4-1 against England in their fifth and final T20I at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.""The recovery from a dire situation to a match-winning score with that partnership between Hardik Pandya and Dube showed why this team are one which will never give up and keep fighting till the end.""If Rana had not taken three wickets and England had gone on to win even then the substitution was wrong and should never have been allowed. It has taken the gloss off the win and India must win in Mumbai to show that they are indeed the better team,"" added Gavaskar.The rule 1.2.7 of ICC's Men's T20I playing guidelines says, ""the ICC Match Referee should ordinarily approve a Concussion Replacement Request if the replacement is a like-for-like player whose inclusion will not excessively advantage his/her team for the remainder of the match.""Sub-sections, 1.2.7.4 and 1.2.7.5, further say, ""in assessing whether the nominated Concussion Replacement should be considered a like-for-like player, the ICC Match Referee should consider the likely role the concussed player would have played during the remainder of the match, and the normal role that would be performed by the nominated Concussion Replacement.""""If the ICC Match Referee believes that the inclusion of the nominated Concussion Replacement, when performing their normal role, would excessively advantage their team, the ICC Match Referee may impose such conditions upon the identity and involvement of the Concussion Replacement as he/she sees fit, in line with the overriding objective of facilitating a like-for-like replacement for the concussed player.""Gavaskar signed off by saying the concussion substitute is 'one of the worst rules in the game'. ""The concussion substitute, which allows teams to bring on a like-for-like replacement on the field, is one of the worst rules in the game. It rewards ineptitude.""If a batter can't play a bouncer and gets hit on the helmet and goes off the field and the team doctor thinks he needs to rest because of concussion, then someone else who is not in the XI who does pretty much what the concussed guy does can replace him. Firstly, if you can't play the bouncer then don't play at the highest level.""Play weekend club cricket and smash the bowlers all round the park to your heart's content. Secondly, if someone breaks a finger or a wrist and obviously cannot take any further part in the game is not allowed a like-for-like replacement, then why allow one for some guy who gets hit on the helmet,"" he concluded.","Harshit Rana took 3-33 in his four overs and was instrumental in India defending 182 and taking unbeatable series lead.

NEW DELHI: Team India on Sunday rewrote the record books by registering their highest-ever Powerplay total in T20Is, smashing 95/1 against England during the fifth and final match at the Wankhede Stadium .The blistering start surpassed their previous best of 82/2 against Scotland in Dubai during the 2021 T20 World Cup.England skipper Jos Buttler won the toss and put India into bat as the tourists look for a consolation win in the fifth T20 international.Right from the first over, Indian openers, Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma , came out with an aggressive intent, taking full advantage of the batting-friendly conditions.The English bowlers had no answers to Abhishek's onslaught, as boundaries flowed freely in all directions. Despite losing Samson (16) early, India kept the momentum going, ensuring their most dominant six-over performance in T20I history.Abhishek's blistering 58 runs off 21 balls in the Powerplay is now the highest by an Indian batter in a T20I, surpassing Yashasvi Jaiswal 's 53 against Australia in Trivandrum in 2023.With the modern T20 game evolving rapidly, such high-scoring starts are becoming a crucial factor in determining the outcome of matches. As Team India continues to dominate the shortest format, their ability to make the most of the Powerplay overs will remain a key strength.Earlier, the visitors made one change in the playing XI following their previous loss, which handed India an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match T20I series.Speedster Mark Wood replaced Saqib Mahmood, despite Mahmood’s impressive performance in the last match, where he took three wickets in his first over without conceding a run.India also made a single change, bringing in fast bowler Mohammed Shami in place of left-arm quick Arshdeep Singh, as they aim to end the series on a high before heading into the three-match ODI series.","Team India register their highest-ever Powerplay total in T20Is, smashing 95/1 against England during the fifth and final match at the Wankhede Stadium.

MUMBAI: Abhishek Sharma isn't yet the darling of corporate companies in terms of endorsements, but his T20 batting graph has risen so sharply since the last IPL that someone will soon queue up at his door step. One just hopes it's an insurance firm, who can secure his sublime hands and quick eye.The Punjab southpaw's rasping bat speed that aids the delicious flow of his willow was on full show on Sunday as a packed Wankhede was treated to surreal batsmanship in the fifth T20I against England.Abhishek's thrill-a-second 135 (54 balls, 7x4, 13x6), the highest by an Indian in T20Is and his second in the format, ensured that hosts, who were put into bat by Jos Buttler got a substantial 247 for 9, despite a wobble in the middle-order.He later came on to bowl and tormented the visitors with a double strike to dismiss Brydon Carse and Jamie Overton as the scoreboard pressure was just too much and England collapsed to 97 all out in 10.3 overs to give India victory by 150 runs, their second biggest in terms of runs in T20Is.During England's chase, Varun Chakravarthy struck twice to end with 14 wickets and be the Player of the Series. The lone spark with the bat for England was provided by Phil Salt , who belted 55 (23 balls, 7x4, 3x6).But it was Abhishek who was the show-stealer. Mentored by one of India's greatest white-ball match winner, Yuvraj Singh, Abhishek has picked up several traits of the former World Cup winner.He times the ball well, picks up length quickly, maintains a steady base and doesn't know the meaning of inhibition. One wonders whether anyone in this Indian T20I team does. Fearlessness runs through their veins. Sanju Samson showed that when he deposited Jofra Archer into the mid-wicket stand off the first ball of the game and repeated the dose three balls later. But the pull shot has been Sanju's bane and Mark Wood got him out to the pull for the fifth time in the series. Rinse and repeat!Abhishek then took over and owned the stage. The faster England bowled, the faster it seemed to ping off the lefthander's bat, especially through the off side.He charged at both Archer and Wood as if they were bowling medium-pace when in reality they were hurling 145-plus rockets.He laced them through cover and point and even lofted them over those regions for maximums. They focused on getting the other batters out after Abhishek blazed away to a 37-ball ton, the second fastest for India.","India beat England by 150 runs in the fifth T20I at Wankhede. Abhishek Sharma scored 135, the highest by an Indian in T20Is. Varun Chakravarthy took 14 wickets and was Player of the Series.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117873761,imgsize-63900,width-400,resizemode-4/117873761.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Falcon Risers Hyderabad secured a thrilling victory in their recent match, thanks to the exceptional performance of their costliest player and renowned death-over specialist , Irfan Umair .Despite facing financial hardships and living at train stations in his pursuit of a cricketing career, Irfan's resilience and hard work paid off as he restricted the opposition to just three runs in the final over, sealing a dramatic win and sparking celebrations in the Hyderabad camp.Irfan's brilliant spell of 2 overs -- 2 wickets for 12 runs earned him the prestigious Gully to Glory Award, helping the Falcons secure their third win in the second edition of the Indian Street Premier League ( ISPL ). Hailing from Ranchi, Jharkhand, Irfan worked odd jobs, including waiting tables and being a sushi chef, to support himself while chasing his cricketing dream.Despite missing ISPL Season 1, Irfan secured a Rs 16.5 lakh contract on his debut in Season 2 after refining his death-over skills during the lockdown while playing tennis-ball cricket for financial stability. Vishal Kalyankar , Falcon Risers Hyderabad's Assistant Coach, discovered Irfan's talent while attending the Delhi Dhamaka Tournament as a Chief Guest, continuing the team's tradition of identifying and elevating tennis-ball cricketers to the top stage at the ISPL.Reflecting on his match-winning final over, Irfan said, ""I am known as a death-over specialist in my team, and my strength remains the same. I trust my game, and I was confident that if my wide-yorker lands well, it's hard to hit. I had full confidence in defending 10 runs. I thank my owners, my team, and the entire performance staff for placing their trust in me. I'm grateful for the opportunity and will continue to give my best in the upcoming matches. As a team, we don't focus on individual performances but on winning together and carrying that momentum forward. Lastly, thanks to my family for their support. To the fans—stay disciplined, work hard, and believe in yourself. There are no shortcuts to success.""A frequent net bowler for MS Dhoni in the past, Irfan now aims to cement his place in professional cricket, proving that resilience and hard work always pay off.After being asked to bat first, Hyderabad overcame a shaky start to post a competitive 84/9, anchored by Vishwajit Thakur's resilient 26 off 19 and Jonty Sarkar's steady 15 off 16. The duo steadied the innings with a crucial 46-run stand after Hyderabad stumbled to 10/4 within the first two overs. Skipper Bablu Patil added late fireworks, ensuring a fighting total.Chetan Padiyar, Head Coach of Falcon Risers Hyderabad, asserted, ""Irfan showed exactly why he is one of the best in high-pressure situations. His ability to execute wide yorkers consistently makes him a game-changer. The way he defended 10 runs in the final over speaks volumes about his mental strength and skill. This win was a total team effort, and we are looking forward to keeping the momentum going.""Vishwajit Thakur, during the post-match presentation after earning his second consecutive Man of the Match award, said, ""I'm really pleased with my performance tonight. The turning point came from Vicky Bhoir's precise bowling, and opting for the 50-50 over in the 7th over was the right call. We never felt the match was slipping away, as we had complete confidence in Irfan to defend those final 10 runs.""","Falcon Risers Hyderabad secured a thrilling victory in their recent match, thanks to the exceptional performance of their costliest player.

Dejected fans leave the stadium after Virat Kohli's early dismissal

NEW DELHI: Abhishek Sharma 's extraordinary performance of 54-ball 135 set new benchmarks, achieving the second-fastest century and highest score by an Indian in T20Is, as India overwhelmed England by 150 runs in the fifth T20I, securing the series 4-1 on Sunday. After England chose to field, Abhishek's aggressive batting propelled India to their highest T20I total against England at 247/9. England collapsed for a mere 97 in 10.3 overs.This victory margin of 150 runs stands as India's second-largest in T20Is, following their 168-run victory over New Zealand in 2023.Despite Phil Salt 's aggressive 23-ball 55, featuring seven fours and three sixes, England's batting lineup faltered at the Wankhede Stadium.Key England batsmen performed poorly, with Ben Duckett (0), Buttler (7), Harry Brook (2) and Liam Livingstone (9) collectively scoring just 18 runs on an excellent batting surface.The lower order offered little resistance. Abhishek continued his dominance by claiming two wickets (2/3) in his sole over, removing Brydon Carse (3) and Jamie Overton (1).Mohammed Shami secured 3/25, Shivam Dube took 2/11, Varun Chakravarthy claimed 2/25, and Ravi Bishnoi finished with 1/9.Abhishek dominated the match with exceptional batting against both pace and spin, establishing multiple records. The 24-year-old achieved his century in 37 balls, making it the second-fastest for India, after initially reaching his fifty in 17 balls.He surpassed the Indian record for most sixes in a T20I innings, hitting his 11th six off Brydon Carse (3/38) in the 17th over, ultimately finishing with 13 sixes.His remarkable innings of 135, including seven fours, surpassed Shubman Gill's previous Indian record of 126 not out against New Zealand at Ahmedabad in 2023.Abhishek's contribution helped India post their highest T20I score against England, exceeding their previous best of 224/2 at Ahmedabad in 2021.This total ranks as India's fourth-highest in T20Is.The left-handed batsman displayed excellent off-side play, consistently finding gaps in the field.He confidently faced Jofra Archer (1/55), playing aggressive shots while maintaining control throughout his innings.A notable moment came when he reached his fifty with a six off Overton's full toss, contributing to India's highest powerplay score of 95/1.Overton's fifth over proved costly, conceding 25 runs including three sixes and a four to Abhishek.While Sanju Samson (16) and Suryakumar Yadav (2) struggled, Tilak Varma (24) and Shivam Dube (30) provided solid support to Abhishek.Varma supported Abhishek in a 115-run second-wicket partnership off 43 balls, while Dube contributed to a quick 37-run fourth-wicket stand off 18 balls.Samson began promisingly, hitting two sixes off Archer in the first over, scoring 14 runs.However, he fell to a short ball from Mark Wood, attempting a pull shot for a 6-ball 16, caught by Archer at backward square leg.Team captain Suryakumar's homecoming at Wankhede Stadium proved disappointing, as he was caught by Phil Salt while attempting his signature leg-side shot.","India beat England by 150 runs in the fifth T20I at the Wankhede Stadium.

Five-star Arsenal crush woeful Manchester City to keep title bid alive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/five-star-arsenal-crush-woeful-manchester-city-to-keep-title-bid-alive/articleshow/117872856.cms,"NEW DELHI: With a 5-1 thumping of a miserable Manchester City on Sunday, Arsenal maintained their hopes of winning the Premier League title, while the struggling champions suffered yet another setback in their terrible season.Following Liverpool's 2-0 victory over Bournemouth on Saturday, which put them nine points ahead of the Gunners, Mikel Arteta 's team had no room for mistake in the title fight.After 103 seconds at the Emirates Stadium, Martin Odegaard's first goal emboldened them to go on a spectacular display.Shortly after halftime, Erling Haaland scored his 25th goal of the season across all competitions to tie the score for City.However, when Thomas Partey took advantage of Phil Foden's shoddy pass to put Arsenal back ahead, the thoughtless errors that have plagued City over a lackluster season proved to be the difference.Kai Havertz and Ethan Nwaneri's late goals and Myles Lewis-Skelly's debut goal for Arsenal completed a brilliant performance that saw the Gunners get within six points of Liverpool.Although Arsenal's strong performance increased their undefeated streak to 14 games and demonstrated their desire to fight the Reds to the end, Liverpool's game in hand maintains them comfortably in charge of the title race.City's six-game winning streak in the top tier came to a cruel end, and they have now lost all four of their league encounters with Arsenal.After their miserable season, City's hopes of winning a fifth straight crown were long since dashed, and now Pep Guardiola's fourth-place team is concentrating on making it to the Champions League However, unless Guardiola can address the glaring gaps in his defense and the lack of energy in his midfield, even that might be beyond them, let alone defeating Real Madrid in this season's playoff round.Abdukodir Khusanov, a former Lens defender who made a clumsy start against Chelsea last weekend, was replaced by John Stones by Guardiola.Stones, however, was a part of the disastrous defense that gave Arsenal the lead in the second minute.Stones put his fellow defender in a tight spot with a pass to the marked Manuel Akanji.Leandro Trossard robbed Akanji right away, and with City's defense in disarray, Kai Havertz picked out Odegaard, who then slotted home from ten yards out.Guardiola marched thunderously back to the bench, already fearing the worst.The frustrated Guardiola made a variety of furious gestures as a result of City controlling possession but being toothless for extended periods of time.During the tempestuous 2-2 draw earlier this season, Haaland infuriated Arsenal by instructing Arteta to ""stay humble"" and hurling the ball at Gunners defender Gabriel Magalhaes.Unsurprisingly, Haaland scored City's equalizer in the 55th minute.Haaland had the opportunity to sneak in front of William Saliba and bury his close-range header after Savinho's excellently weighted cross.However, it only took Arsenal two minutes to make Haaland stop smiling.After Partey intercepted Foden's pass, the Ghanaian midfielder launched a strong long-range shot that struck Stones with a deft deflection.In the 62nd minute, Lewis-Skelly went for the kill as Arsenal smelt blood.The 18-year-old left-back cut inside the City area and curled a beautiful finish into the far corner with elegance that belied his inexperience.Lewis-Skelly mimicked the City star's contemplative celebration by sitting down with his legs crossed to mark the goal in a playful jab at Haaland.The much-maligned Havertz scored in the 76th minute, adding to the suffering of shell-shocked City.After stomping through City's flimsy defense, Gabriel Martinelli set up Havertz for a clinical 10-yard finish.Nwaneri, a young forward, struck the final punch deep into stoppage time with a brilliant goal into the far corner from a sharp angle.For the second time in a humiliating day, City had no answer to the taunts of ""you're getting sacked in the morning"" from Arsenal supporters directed at Guardiola.","Arsenal maintained their hopes of winning the Premier League title with a 5-1 thumping of a miserable Manchester City.
