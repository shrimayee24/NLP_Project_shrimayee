“He’s tired”: Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr is looking for ways to rest Stephen Curry for a while amid a loss to the Denver Nuggets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/hes-tired-golden-state-warriors-coach-steve-kerr-is-looking-for-ways-to-rest-stephen-curry-for-a-while-amid-a-loss-to-the-denver-nuggets/articleshow/119165157.cms,"<p>(Image Credit: Stephen Curry/Instagram)<br></p>

Stephen Curry needs rest to bounce back for upcoming matches



Stephen Curry recently celebrated his 37th birthday after reaching 25,000 points in his successful NBA career. The Golden State Warriors point guard is now fatigued and needs rest to recover from the strain he's been feeling on the court during back-to-back games. Coach Steve Kerr is aware of this and wants to give him a short break to regain the energy he's known for, in order to bounce back for the playoffs.Speaking about Curry’s recent struggles, Kerr told the Associated Press, “He’s tired. Steph’s been carrying us for a month, he’s been amazing. He’s tired, so we’ve got to get him some rest. You can see it, he just doesn’t have his energy right now.”He added, “He’s exhausted right now. We’ve got to absolutely consider giving him a night and getting him rejuvenated for the sake of him and the remainder of our games. We’ll see. But I think he’s been tired the last few games so we’ve got to find a way to get him his juice back.” AP reports that the coach will speak with Director of Sports Medicine and Performance Rick Celebrini about the same.Golden State Warriors guard Gary Payton II mentioned that the team will pitch in to give Curry the rest he deserves. “We try to take the pressure off him as much as we can. He has a guy on his hip 48 minutes of the game. I’m pretty sure he’s a little gassed,” he said.Curry definitely has reasons to feel worn out. Just days before his subpar performance against the Denver Nuggets, he made history by becoming the first NBA player to hit 4,000 three-pointers in his remarkable 16-year career. However, in the game that followed, he struggled, making just 6 of 21 shot attempts. His turnovers were particularly costly, allowing the Nuggets to score 24 points off his mistakes. Despite his efforts, the Warriors fell short and lost the game.Also Read: NBA Offseason Rumors: Golden State Warriors might sign $48 million Milwaukee Bucks star to support Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler On his birthday, Curry shared a glimpse of his busy life and milestones. “4K!!! New milestones added. A very nice bday present. Thankful for all the messages and love today and always! 37. A reminder to Never Limit God!” he wrote.","Stephen Curry recently celebrated his 37th birthday after reaching 25,000 points in his successful NBA career.

Best 2025 NFL Free-Agent Signings: Top deals that could reshape Season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/best-2025-nfl-free-agent-signings-top-deals-that-could-reshape-season/articleshow/119167536.cms,"Davante Adams (via: Getty Images)

Free-Agent Signings to change 2025 NFL landscape



Grading the Big 2025 NFL Free Agent Signings So Far

5. Mekhi Becton, OG, Los Angeles Chargers – A powerhouse in the trenches



4. Drew Dalman, C, Chicago Bears – The protector Caleb Williams needed



3. Jevon Holland, S, New York Giants – The defensive chess piece



2. Josh Sweat, Edge, Arizona Cardinals – A high-stakes gamble that could pay off



1. Davante Adams, WR, Los Angeles Rams – The superstar signing that can change everything

Final Take: How these bold moves will shape 2025 NFL Season



The 2025 NFL free agency period wasn’t packed with blockbuster deals, as many teams prioritized retaining their stars. The Bengals locked in Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, while the Chiefs secured Trey Smith with a hefty franchise tag. However, a few game-changing moves still shook up the league. Here are the top five signings that could reshape the NFL landscape this season.Mekhi Becton’s road to NFL redemption has been a rollercoaster. Once plagued by injuries and inconsistency with the New York Jets, the 25-year-old offensive lineman proved his worth with the Philadelphia Eagles, helping pave the way to a Super Bowl victory. Yet, concerns about his durability kept his price tag reasonable.That’s where the Chargers swooped in, signing him to a two-year, $20 million deal—an absolute steal compared to other offensive linemen this offseason. With rookie phenom Joe Alt at right tackle, Becton will have the perfect setup to thrive, bulldozing defenders for Najee Harris and giving Justin Herbert the protection he desperately needs.Caleb Williams took a brutal 68 sacks in his rookie season, making offensive line reinforcements the Bears’ top priority. Enter Drew Dalman, the former Atlanta Falcons center who has been a model of consistency. His run-blocking skills and ability to hold the pocket make him a critical addition to Chicago’s revamped offensive line.Signing Dalman to a three-year, $42 million deal gives the Bears an anchor in the middle, pairing him with newly acquired guards Jonah Jackson and Joe Thuney. If Chicago wants to take the next step offensively, Dalman’s presence will be key.While the Giants remain in quarterback limbo, they didn’t hesitate to bolster their defense. Jevon Holland, formerly of the Miami Dolphins, has emerged as one of the league’s most versatile safeties. His ability to play multiple positions in the secondary makes him a game-changer for New York.On a three-year, $45 million deal, Holland joins a defense that already features stars like Dexter Lawrence II, Brian Burns, and Kayvon Thibodeaux. After losing Xavier McKinney last season, the Giants made sure they weren’t making the same mistake twice. With Holland’s playmaking skills, this defense could become one of the NFL’s elite units.Finding a dominant edge rusher in this free-agent class was a challenge, but the Cardinals weren’t willing to settle. They went all-in on Josh Sweat, signing him to a four-year, $76.4 million deal. While some critics question the investment in a player with just one double-digit sack season, Arizona coach Jonathan Gannon knows exactly what Sweat brings to the table.The two worked together in Philadelphia, where Sweat thrived under Gannon’s defensive schemes. Now, the Cardinals are banking on him to be the centerpiece of their pass rush alongside Dalvin Tomlinson and first-round pick Darius Robinson. If Sweat can replicate his 2022 form, this deal could be a game-changer for Arizona’s defense.The Rams have never been afraid to make bold moves, and signing Davante Adams is another statement that they’re going all-in. The 32-year-old wideout inked a two-year, $46 million contract, proving that Los Angeles sees themselves as legitimate contenders once again.Despite his age, Adams showed last season that he’s still one of the NFL’s elite receivers, posting 85 catches for 1,063 yards and eight touchdowns. His arrival not only gives Matthew Stafford a top-tier perimeter threat but also takes pressure off breakout star Puka Nacua. Defenses can no longer key in on Nacua, making the Rams’ passing attack even more dangerous.Also Read: After jumping to rival Steelers, Juan Thornhill breaks silence on Browns While some teams played it safe, these five franchises made bold free-agent moves that could redefine their seasons. Whether it’s Adams elevating the Rams’ offense, Becton solidifying the Chargers’ trenches, or Holland bolstering the Giants’ secondary, these signings have the potential to shape the 2025 NFL landscape. Keep an eye on these impact players as they look to justify their contracts and lead their teams to success.","The 2025 NFL free agency period wasn’t packed with blockbuster deals, as many teams prioritized retaining their stars.

“What's going on with the disrespect?”: Connor Bedard’s NHL treatment sparks debate among analysts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/whats-going-on-with-the-disrespect-connor-bedards-nhl-treatment-sparks-debate-among-analysts/articleshow/119148417.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Controversy grows over Connor Bedard’s misconduct calls

Chicago Blackhawks analysts are frustrated with the way Connor Bedard is being treated in the NHL. Their concerns grew after he received back-to-back 10-minute misconduct penalties in recent games, which they found unusual for his normally composed play. Analysts from The Chicago Lead questioned the officiating, feeling that Bedard is not getting the respect he deserves.Connor Bedard’s recent penalties have sparked debate over whether the issue lies with him or NHL officiating. Analysts pointed to past incidents, questioning the league’s treatment of the young star.After Connor Bedard's consecutive misconduct penalties, analysts from The Chicago Lead raised an important question, “Is this more so a Bedard issue or an official issue? Because I’m trying to make it make sense,” said one among the trio of CHSN analysts. However, none of them had the answer. “I don't know what is going on with the disrespect in the NHL for Conor Bedard,” responded the co-host.This wasn’t the first time Bedard faced such treatment. Analysts pointed out a previous incident when Colorado Avalanche’s Ryan Lindgren cross-checked him during a game in Colorado. “I’d be frustrated too. He’s 19 years old. He’s barely raised his voice in two years in Chicago,” added the analyst.Connor Bedard couldn’t remember exactly what he said, but he acknowledged the need to be more careful. He admitted, “I gotta be smarter with my words there. I’m supposed to deal in the situation,” during a locker room interview. NHL insider Frank Seravalli had also shared a similar opinion. “He needs to be smarter, and he needs to keep his emotions in check better,” said the analyst.Blackhawks interim coach Anders Sorensen sees Bedard’s struggles as temporary, despite his up-and-down season.The Swedish coach pointed out that even NHL legends faced challenges early in their careers. He mentioned, “I remember Sidney Crosby went through that a lot. I remember Peter Forsberg came into the league mild-mannered off the ice, but on the ice, it happens, right?” to emphasize that Bedard’s struggles are not unusual.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky is suing his ex-business partner over weight loss gum claims Despite the criticism and challenges, Connor Bedard continues to prove his talent and resilience. With support from his coaches and the experience of NHL greats to learn from, his struggles seem to be just a stepping stone in his promising career.","Chicago Blackhawks analysts are frustrated with the way Connor Bedard is being treated in the NHL.

Brooklyn Nets injury report for tonight’s game against the Boston Celtics (March 18, 2025)

When and where to watch the Boston Celtics play tonight against the Brooklyn Nets (March 18, 2025)?

The Boston Celtics are gearing up for a crucial matchup against the Brooklyn Nets on Tuesday, March 18, at TD Garden, but all eyes are on star forward Jayson Tatum’s injury status. Tatum is listed as questionable due to a knee issue, casting uncertainty over his availability for the game. Jayson Tatum , who leads the Celtics with 27.1 points per game (fifth in the NBA), has been a cornerstone of Boston’s success this season. His potential absence could significantly impact the team’s performance, especially with Jaylen Brown already ruled out due to a back injury. Over the last 20 games, Tatum has averaged 25.5 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.3 assists, showcasing his all-around dominance.The Celtics, currently sitting at 49-19, have been one of the league’s top teams, outscoring opponents by 8.4 points per game. Their offense ranks seventh in the NBA, averaging 116.6 points, while their defense is third, allowing just 108.2 points. Tatum’s contributions extend beyond scoring; he leads the team in rebounds (8.7 per game) and three-pointers made (3.6 per game), both critical to Boston’s success.If Jayson Tatum is unable to play, the Celtics will rely heavily on Derrick White and Payton Pritchard to step up. White has been solid, averaging 17.2 points and 4.8 assists over the last 20 games, while Pritchard has provided a spark with 13.7 points and 3.3 three-pointers per game during the same stretch.On the other side, the Nets (23-45) are dealing with their own injury woes. Cameron Thomas and De’Anthony Melton are out for the season, while Noah Clowney and Ziaire Williams are probable. Brooklyn has struggled offensively, ranking 29th in the league with 105.6 points per game, and will face an uphill battle against Boston’s stout defense.The game tips off at 7:30 p.m. ET and will be broadcast on NBA TV, NBCS-BOS, and YES. Fans can also stream the action on Fubo, though regional restrictions may apply.As the Celtics aim to maintain their momentum in the playoff race, Jayson Tatum’s status remains the biggest storyline. His presence on the court could be the difference-maker in what promises to be a competitive showdown.","The Boston Celtics face the Brooklyn Nets on Tuesday, March 18, at TD Garden.

“Gafford doesn’t receive enough praise for his stable play on both ends,”

The Los Angeles Lakers are reportedly considering a bold move to bolster their frontcourt by trading star rookie Dalton Knecht for Dallas Mavericks ’ center Daniel Gafford. This potential trade, as suggested by Bleacher Report’s Eric Pincus , could address the Lakers’ ongoing struggles in the low post.Despite commendable efforts from Alex Len and Jaxson Hayes, the Los Angeles Lakers’ frontcourt has shown noticeable limitations this season. Gafford, an underrated but impactful player, could provide the stability and energy the team desperately needs. The 26-year-old big man has been a consistent performer for the Mavericks, averaging 12.3 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 1.9 blocks per game this season while shooting an impressive 69.9% from the field.However, Daniel Gafford’s recent knee injury, which may sideline him for the remainder of the 2024-25 campaign, adds a layer of uncertainty to the trade. His contributions to the Mavericks' march to the NBA Finals the previous season cannot be understated, albeit this setback. Gafford shot 63.4% from the floor and averaged 9.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks per game in 22 postseason games. Dallas' success was largely attributed to his rim-running prowess, defensive presence, and contagious intensity.Pincus noted. While he may not be the most skilled center in the league, his reliability and hustle make him a valuable asset for any team.For the Los Angeles Lakers, trading Knecht, a promising rookie, for Daniel Gafford represents a calculated risk. Knecht has shown flashes of potential, but the Lakers seem willing to part with him to address their immediate needs. Daniel Gafford’s $40 million contract, while significant, could be a worthwhile investment if he returns to full health and replicates his previous form.This potential trade could reshape both teams’ rosters. The Mavericks would gain a young talent in Knecht, while the Los Angeles Lakers would acquire a proven big man to strengthen their frontcourt. As the offseason approaches, all eyes will be on whether this deal comes to fruition.Also read: NBA Offseason Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could sign $11,128,042 Sixers shooting guard to support Luka Doncic and LeBron James Let us know in the comments if you feel getting Daniel Gafford during his free agency would be a smart move from the Los Angeles Lakers front office.

The Washington Capitals Seek to Keep Extending Their Control while Alexander Ovechkin Chases the Record

Capitals' Alex Ovechkin Tips Home Number 887, Sits Eight Goals Back Of NHL Record

On March 19, 2025, at Capital One Arena, the Washington Capitals will find themselves embroiled in a heavyweight title fight against the Detroit Red Wings . Such an event occurs at this juncture between both teams but with totally different motivations. Washington thrives atop the Eastern Conference with sole play-off ambitions, while Detroit must put up with the desperation of playoff contention. The drama is made more interesting by the fact that Ovechkin is fast closing in on Wayne Gretzky's all-time record of scoring goals.At the top of the Eastern Conference where the Washington Capitals are, they have currently totaled 96 points from 67 games in superb form this season. Their last seven matches have seen them reiterating why they are seen as a powerhouse, winning six of them. A comprehensive 5-1 hammering from the San Jose Sharks only made it sure, and the crowning moment of this night for Ovechkin was his goal and an assist, bringing his all-time career tally to 887 goals, just seven behind Wayne Gretzky's legendary record of 894.Ovechkin's pursuit of history has been one of the main plots in the story of this season. Every time he scores, he approaches one of the ground-breaking milestones in National Hockey League history. On top of that, it just makes this Washington team even stronger against any opponent on account of their well-known firepower on the offensive end. In that respect, this setback wasn't that bad. The Capitals lost to the Los Angeles Kings, 0-3, but bounced right back against San Jose.Meanwhile, the Red Wings are desperately trying to keep slim hopes of playoff contention alive. Right now, the Wings sit 11th in the Eastern Conference with 70 points through 67 games too erratic performance has hurt their progress. Their ability to compete with the best was further exhibited by their ability to shut out the Vegas Golden Knights 3-0. That game was huge for goaltender Petr Mrazek, but big questions still remain regarding that team's overall defense.History makes it worse for Detroit within this matchup since they won seven of the last ten of these meetings, including one more recently by 5-2. Supreme Washington claimed too much from the Red Wings, had a home court, and so were the huge favorites in the meetings. The betting odds also favor Washington, suggesting it would be a high-scoring affair, possibly going over 6.5 goals.Also Read: Alex Ovechkin Ties Jaromir Jagr for Most Game-Winning Goals in NHL History This match between the Washington Capitals and the Detroit Red Wings tells much about the future of Ovechkin in the text.

Oilers goalie gets surprise tribute amidst criticism



Pizza 73 pays tribute to Stuart Skinner



Connor McDavid's speedy fast-food tribute is the trendsetter



Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender Stuart Skinner has been in the spotlight, although not for the reasons a goalie might wish. Though he guided the Edmonton Oilers to victories over the Montreal Canadiens and Dallas Stars, Skinner came under scrutiny following the team's shocking loss to the Buffalo Sabres—a team that had not recorded a victory since February.Oilers fans took to social media to express their frustration, with one particularly scathing post reading, “The Sabres were on a 6-game losing streak... then they played Stuart Skinner’s Oilers.”Despite the backlash, Skinner remains unfazed and is receiving a level of recognition that puts him alongside none other than Connor McDavid .Although some people doubt his recent play, Stuart Skinner is winning citywide admiration in a manner few anticipated. In an unusual show of respect, Pizza 73 is briefly changing its name to ‘Pizza 74’ to pay homage to the hometown goaltender's jersey number.Not content to end at the name change, the company is also introducing a limited-time offer in the form of the ‘ Skinner Dinner ,’ a big two-topping pizza, and three beverages for $18.99. The campaign will be very visible, as the new Pizza 74 branding will be found at Oilers games, and an official website launch will soon follow.‘Same number. New outfit. Excited to be partnering with Pizza 74’, Stuart Skinner shared on his Instagram handle.Stuart Skinner isn’t the first Oilers player to receive such an honour. Back in February, Connor McDavid saw his name take over McDonald’s locations following a clutch overtime goal that secured Canada’s 4 Nations Face-Off victory against the United States.McDonald's had turned two of its restaurants—one in Edmonton and one in Newmarket—into ‘McDavid's’ for an entire week, honouring a commitment they'd made years earlier that depended on the Oilers defeating the Florida Panthers in the Stanley Cup championship.That title never materialized, but McDavid still earned his due adoration. Stuart Skinner's next moment of unveiling is up next, proof positive that in all the criticism he took, his legacy for Edmonton is still etched in stone.","Stuart Skinner has been in the spotlight following the Edmonton Oilers' shocking loss to the Buffalo Sabres.

SHILLONG: India’s friendly international against Maldives here has gathered more firsts than it promised. When the schedule for India’s matches in this FIFA international window was announced, Wednesday’s friendly was marked as the first time that the senior national team will play in Meghalaya’s capital, ahead of their more important 2027 AFC Asian Cup Qualifier against Bangladesh next week.More than the match being the first of its kind in Shillong, however, is Sunil Chhetri ’s comeback in national colours. As the 40-year-old is ready to play his 152th international game, after being coaxed out of retirement by the India head coach Manolo Marquez earlier this month, all focus and talk around the game has been around Chhetri.On Tuesday, Marquez confirmed that India’s all-time leading scorer, who has been training with the team here since Saturday, will have a part to play against Maldives.“For sure, he will play some minutes. I don’t know whether as a starter or from the bench. We can use six substitutions, so 17 players can play, Sunil will be one of them,” said Marquez. “Sunil is the Indian player with the most goals this season. It doesn’t matter if a player is 20, 40, or my grandfather at 87. If they are in better shape, they will be here,” the Spaniard asserted.“The national team is not about developing players. Developed players have to arrive here. The main team needs to win games. And if we need to win games, we need to call players who are in better shape.”With his first competitive game since becoming India coach in July last year just a week away, Marquez is banking on the Maldives friendly as an opportunity to take stock and assess his combination before the March 25 Asian Cup qualifier.“It’s a friendly game to prepare for the Asian Cup qualifier. We knew that the target during the previous FIFA windows was to arrive in the best possible condition against Bangladesh next Tuesday. I don’t think we will play with the same team against Bangladesh that will play tomorrow. Obviously, you can’t change all 11. Some will repeat. It has to be a good game and a good preparation for Bangladesh,” said the coach.Maldives, who had reportedly requested to shift this match out of Shillong due to logistical issues earlier, will be using the friendly to prepare for their Asian Cup qualifier against Philippines next Tuesday.",India face Maldives in a friendly international in Shillong on Wednesday. It is the first time that the senior national team will play in Meghalaya’s capital. The match is also Sunil Chhetri's 152th international game.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Daniel Cormier talks about the negative impression left behind by Conor McGregor after his last fight against Dustin Poirier

Daniel Cormier & Ben Askren on Conor McGregor at White House, Jon Jones NOT READY, Pereira-Ankalaev

Former American mixed martial artist and freestyle wrestlercurrently fulfills his role as an expert commentator at the UFC. He was one of the greatest fighters of all time, who by the end of his career stood with an MMA stat of 22-3-0. Cormier’s last bout was against Stipe Miocic at the UFC 252 . This was the third rematch between the fighters, which favored Miocic. Known for his honest opinions and transparent analysis, Cormier, in his recent interview with Ben Askren, talked about how he is quite skeptical about the upcoming political venture of Conor McGregor and wishes how the end of McGregor’swould have been different.Conor McGregor’s venture into combat sports had a promising future, considering he has faced and won against fighters like Eddie Alvarez, Nate Diaz, Maz Holloway and others. However, his leg injury against Dustin Poirier at the UFC 264 has put a halt in the fighting career of the Irishman. After this fight in 2021, McGregor was scheduled to face Michael Chandler at the UFC 303, and even that didn’t pan out, owing to the former’s toe injury. Even though, McGregor claimed that he would be stepping back into the Octagon soon, however, till today, there has been no such announcement. Chandler, who was waiting for quite sometime, decided to move on and now has his fight scheduled at UFC 314 against Paddy Pimblett.Away from the ring, McGregor is still on the news now and then, for all the wrong reasons. At least most of it. Accusations like sexually assaulting a woman after NBA finals, spitting at a fan’s face, trash talking about his opponent and the opponent’s wife are some of the instances that have overshadowed his achievements within the Octagon.Daniel Cormier, in this talk with Ben Askren, speaks about a fighter of McGregor’s capability who should have instead been seen in the ring fighting and not in any other form.“For me, it’s kinda sad because it is. It’s like, when a guy comes, and he’s that successful, and he’s that good, you hope that the last time you see him in the octagon, is him fighting. Even if it’s him losing. You don’t want the last memory is him sitting in the octagon with a broken leg, yelling at Dustin Poirier’s wife.”Cormier explained how the entire visual was rather a sad one. He went on to add, “When he broke his leg, he was sitting on the ground screaming and yelling. It was like he was a rich guy who didn’t get his way and there is nothing he could do about it and he was acting out because of it.”Despite McGregor appearing in the Octagon only four times in the last few years, Cormier is still hopeful that the 36-year-old might just be back for his future bouts. Contrary to Cormier’s belief, Askren thinks that the Irish fighter is now done for.Also read: Bryce Mitchell vs. Jean Silva UFC 314: Date, venue, how to watch and more Regardless of what the fighting community and veterans like Cormier believe, it seems like McGregor is far from coming back to the Octagon owing to his rising interest in the political venture.

NHL Trade Rumors: Should the Chicago Blackhawks consider moving Connor Bedard?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-should-the-chicago-blackhawks-consider-moving-connor-bedard/articleshow/119189711.cms,"Image via Imagn Images

Is Connor Bedard really underperforming?

Why a trade doesn't make sense—yet

The Chicago Blackhawks second season under news center Connor Bedard did not follow the original plan. A 19-year-old center who earned savior status with the franchise now battles a poor period of play which has many fans considering his long-term place with the team. Recent misconduct penalties suffered by Bedard in back-to-back games have ignited frustrated fan reactions that some fans consider trading him off.While Connor Bedard’s numbers have dipped slightly from his rookie campaign—17 goals and 52 points in 67 games this season compared to 22 goals and 61 points in 68 games last year—it’s important to consider the context. The Blackhawks are one of the worst teams in the NHL, sitting near the bottom of the standings with a dismal 20-38-9 record. Bedard is often left carrying the offensive load with little support, making it difficult for him to thrive.Despite his struggles, Bedard remains a key piece of Chicago’s offense. As Phil Thompson of the Chicago Tribune noted, ""Bedard is still the engine that drives the offense and draws the most attention from defenses, even if other players have been putting up the statistics lately. When the Hawks acquire more legitimate offensive threats, likely through the free agent market or trade, then it’ll be fair to scrutinize how he performs next to better talent.""Some angry Blackhawks supporters are doubting if Bedard acts as the next superstar talent but moving him as trade merchandise remains hasty. Searching for such a similar player would prove virtually impossible. The Chicago Blackhawks should put the key emphasis on bringing more superior talent into the team to help Bedard develop organically.The Blackhawks should investigate moving Bedard to winger position which would enable him to concentrate on getting goals rather than defensive work required at center. The 37.2% faceoff win percentage demonstrates his potential to succeed from such a move both individually and for the team.Also Read: “What's going on with the disrespect?”: Connor Bedard’s NHL treatment sparks debate among analysts The city of Chicago has experienced continuous failure in its development of elite athletes since its inability to produce quality quarterbacks in NFL history. The Blackhawks need to prevent any scenarios where Bedard experiences similar setbacks such as these. The front office needs to obtain better supporting players and experienced leaders who will enable Bedard to maximize his potential before making major changes to his position. As the current franchise focal point Bedard needs suitable steps to achieve success from the entire organization.",Connor Bedard's numbers have dipped slightly from his rookie campaign. The 19-year-old center has scored 17 goals and 52 points in 67 games this season compared to 22 goals and 61 points in 68 games last year.

“Things are happening and I don’t have a lot of control over it” - Stuart Skinner opens about backlash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/things-are-happening-and-i-dont-have-a-lot-of-control-over-it-stuart-skinner-opens-about-backlash/articleshow/119105895.cms,"Stuart Skinner (via: Getty Images)

Stuart Skinner under fire: Can he handle the pressure?



Stuart Skinner's Best Saves Of The 2023-24 NHL Season

Stuart Skinner’s struggles: Breaking down the numbers



The game that sparked the backlash: Loss to the Sabres



The Edmonton Oilers just proved why they’re a force to be reckoned with, taking down the New York Rangers in a commanding 3-1 victory at Madison Square Garden. Leon Draisaitl extended his incredible point streak to 18 games with another assist, while Connor McDavid continued his own streak, now sitting at 11 games. But amid all the celebrations, one storyline refuses to fade; Stuart Skinner ’s performance under the spotlight.The goaltending debate is nothing new for Oilers fans, and lately, it’s been all about Skinner. Despite the swirling criticism, he delivered when it mattered most, standing tall with 21 saves against the Rangers. While Edmonton keeps stacking wins, Stuart Skinner ’s play remains under constant examination, with fans and analysts dissecting every goal conceded.The backlash has only intensified, and Stuart Skinner himself is well aware of it. In a candid video posted by the Oilers, he addressed the noise, admitting that things haven’t gone exactly as he’d hoped. “Yeah, I think just how I want to show up even though that things aren’t maybe going as well as I’d like.” Skinner remarked. He knows the ups and downs of the game are inevitable, adding, “things are happening and I don’t have a lot of control over it.” Instead of dwelling on frustrations, he’s focusing on his effort and response to adversity.While Skinner’s mindset remains resilient, the numbers tell a different tale. His save percentage has dipped to .896 over 45 games far from the lockdown presence the Oilers were banking on. His performance has fluctuated throughout the season, showing moments of brilliance followed by struggles that put his reliability into question. March has been a mixed bag with five wins and three losses, but February was downright brutal, with Edmonton dropping six of eight games.Things reached a boiling point after a particularly painful loss to the Buffalo Sabres. The Sabres had not won a game since February 2025, enduring a six-game losing streak—until they faced Edmonton. The Oilers’ inability to capitalize on 34 shots against Buffalo’s Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen left fans frustrated, and Skinner took the brunt of the criticism.Social media didn’t hold back, with one fan summing up the disappointment: “The Sabres were on a 6-game losing streak… then they played Stuart Skinner’s Oilers.” Ouch. While Coach Kris Knoblauch defended the team’s effort, pointing out their dominance in possession and chances, the reality remains: results matter.Also Read: Inside Toronto Maple Leafs' group chat: How team bonding fuels unity during struggles Skinner is no stranger to pressure, but as the Oilers push for playoff positioning, the question looms, can he silence the critics when it matters most?

If Skinner hopes to solidify his role as Edmonton’s go-to netminder, he’ll need to rise to the occasion and deliver when the stakes are highest.","Edmonton Oilers beat the New York Rangers 3-1 at Madison Square Garden.

May 30, 2008. Venue: The Wankhede Stadium. Event: First semifinal of the inaugural IPL between Rajasthan Royals (RR) and Delhi Daredevils (DD). RR had just finished the warm-ups. Their captain Shane Warne walked towards Yusuf Pathan and without saying a word, looked deep into his eyes, placed a hand on his shoulders and just stood for a minute. Pathan, hypnotized, stared back. Despite playing blistering knocks consistently, Pathan had endured a couple of failures, especially against pace bowling. The Royals had lost the toss on a sticky Wankhede pitch and Daredevils had Glenn McGrath, Mohammad Asif and Farveez Maharoof to exploit conditions. Warne’s silent gesture suggested, “Yusuf, I’m backing you. Smash them.” Pathan went on to carve a 21-ball 45, with four sixes which included an audacious smear off McGrath over mid-wicket.One can’t fathom how much that gesture from Warne triggered Pathan, but it showed trust. RR always knew what they wanted when they signed up the sheikh of tweak as captain and coach for essentially a ‘Moneyball’ team.Warne was a poster boy who put bums on seats. And boy, could he bowl and lead! For an inaugural edition, he was perfect. But as the IPL turns 18, how have franchises evolved in terms of choosing captains? Do they look only for a brand? Or do they eye a leader with pedigree?Sanjay Bangar, former India allrounder and ex-head coach of Punjab Kings and RCB who has strategized during numerous auctions, says, “If there are proven captaincy candidates, teams devise their auction strategy around getting a captain first. But if captaincy candidates are not available, the plan is to build a team and find a candidate later.”Previous IPL editions have seen retired greats like Warne, Anil Kumble, Rahul Dravid and Adam Gilchrist excel as leaders. They had limited or no T20I experience. Last year, Shreyas Iyer, despite being away from India’s T20I set up, won the IPL with KKR and commanded a huge price from PBKS this year. What explains that?Bangar says, “Players in leadership roles are preferred even though they are not part of current T20I teams because of their tactical acumen and rare ability to strategize on the go.”Former India batter Pravin Amre, ex-batting coach of Delhi Capitals and Mumbai Indians, concurs with Bangar.“T20 is the most challenging format for captains since a bad move could result in a bad 10 minutes and a loss. A captain has to be switched on for 120 balls,” he said. “When franchises pick a captain, they look at him as someone who can single-handedly win two games out of 14. Also, a captain in such an intense tournament must have a 24/7 open-door policy for players.”Both Bangar and Amre stressed that branding around a captain is not important as all IPL teams now make money through revenue sharing. Bangar and Amre’s points are worth noting. Teams like CSK, PBKS, GT, RCB and KKR are all led by players who are not in the present Indian T20I team.“Ruturaj Gaikwad, Shreyas Iyer, Shubman Gill, Rajat Patidar and Ajinkya Rahane are men who let their performance talk. Gill, of course, is a popular brand, but others are not. Today, pedigree matters more. When picking a captain, we pick someone who is an automatic choice in the playing XI,” says a support staff member of a former championship-winning side.The choice of Rahane to lead KKR, for example, was an interesting one. He hadn’t led in the IPL since captaining RR in 2019. His face doesn’t jump out of screens during breaks. He last played for India in 2023. The franchise doesn’t expect him to break into a ‘korbo lorbo jeetbo re’ jig with team owner Shah Rukh Khan. How can they?Rahane celebrated arguably India’s greatest ever overseas Test triumph at the Gabba in Jan 2021 as a captain with just a quiet hug with Rohit Sharma. But between 2019 and 2024, for Mumbai, he was loaded with trophies. He won the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 as captain at the Eden in 2022. He top-scored in the tourney in 2024 when Shreyas led Mumbai to the title, and won the Ranji and Irani double as skipper in 2024.Another support staff member of a franchise that has contested finals, stresses, “In the auctions, we shortlist players for captaincy options. But you have to alter plans when that player gets sold. Of course, it’s an advantage if your captain is also a star and is playing for India.”In 2025 though, that doesn’t seem necessary.","Shane Warne led Rajasthan Royals to the inaugural IPL title in 2008.

NEW DELHI: It’s been 17 years since Virat Kohli lifted the U-19 World Cup trophy. From that team, only Ravindra Jadeja, Manish Pandey and Kohli are still active in the IPL. This season, they will be reuniting with one more of their teammates when Tanmay Srivastava makes his debut as a BCCI-qualified umpire.Incidentally, Srivastava was India’s top-scorer in the U-19 World Cup final against South Africa in 2008, which earned him a contract with Kings XI Punjab. Srivastava has been fast-tracked as an umpire by the BCCI after clearing the Level 2 course in two years. At 35, he is set to earn the distinction of becoming the first player to have both played and officiated in the IPL.For now, he hasn’t been given on-field duties this season. While most players from the batch have recently retired or are no longer active in top-level cricket , Srivastava decided to retire as a player in 2020 while he was captaining Uttarakhand after moving from UP at the age of 30.“I understood that was the best player I could be,” Srivastava told TOI. “I was nowhere close to playing the IPL. I had to decide if I wanted to prolong life as a player or have a longer successful second innings.”Srivastava admits it was about swallowing his ego. “I am still in touch with Virat, but I had to decide for myself and have a practical outlook,” he added.It was an honest discussion with current BCCI vice-president Rajiv Shukla, a UP cricket mainstay, that gave him clarity.“I told Shukla sir that I wanted to do something else in cricket other than playing. He was a bit taken aback since I was still just 30. Then we discussed what the options could be. I did my Level 2 course in coaching in NCA, but I knew the best I could become was fielding coach. I decided to focus on umpiring,” Srivastava said.In 2020, when he was preparing for the umpiring exams, Srivastava juggled cricketing jobs, a talent scout for RCB and fielding coach for U-16s at NCA and for Jammu and Kashmir.“Studying for umpiring is tough. I used to stay up at nights. You have to study a lot to understand the laws and its implications,” he said.Srivastava credits the BCCI’s umpiring programme, which has a players’ quota.“There is certain relaxation for players irrespective of the level of cricket they’ve played. The board is encouraging young players to take up umpiring rather than heavily depending on older people with bookish knowledge,” he said.",Tanmay Srivastava will make his IPL debut as a BCCI-qualified umpire. The 35-year-old was India’s top-scorer in the U-19 World Cup final against South Africa in 2008. He has been fast-tracked as an umpire by the BCCI.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119188024,imgsize-122460,width-400,resizemode-4/119188024.jpg"

IPL: How will GT, LSG, DC, PBKS, RR fare? Greenstone Lobo predicts

Punjab Kings are chasing their first IPL title under new skipper, Shreyas Iyer. What are your thoughts on the team’s chances this season?

Shreyas Iyer has led Mumbai to domestic titles and guided KKR to an IPL title after almost a decade. Do you see him as a ‘lucky charm’ for Punjab Kings?

Ricky Ponting is known for his aggressive, Australian-style cricket, and Punjab Kings also have players like Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis. What approach can we expect from the team this season?

Have you had any interactions with overseas players like Maxwell or Stoinis so far?

Arshdeep Singh has come a long way, winning an Under-19 World Cup and now two senior ICC titles—T20 World Cup 2024 and Champions Trophy 2025. How would you describe his rise in international cricket?

Yuzvendra Chahal brings a wealth of experience to Punjab Kings. What’s your take on his inclusion, and do you see IPL 2025 as a stepping stone for his India comeback?

Who do you think will be the two key players for Punjab Kings this season?

You were retained by Punjab Kings. How much does that mean to you, and can we expect a similar performance from you this season?

What were the discussions like before the IPL Auction when Punjab Kings decided to retain you?

Have you made any technical adjustments to your game? Also, has there been any conversation regarding your batting position for the upcoming season?

Will you miss your partnership with Ashutosh Sharma, who will be playing for Delhi Capitals this season?

NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings are still in pursuit of their maiden Indian Premier League ( IPL ) title. Since the tournament's inception in 2008, they have reached the final only once— in 2014—where they fell short against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). Their only other notable campaign came in the inaugural edition (2008) when they made it to the semifinals. Barring these two instances, Punjab Kings have never reached the playoffs.As IPL 2025 approaches, Punjab Kings will feature several new faces, including captain Shreyas Iyer and head coach Ricky Ponting , who is known for his aggressive style of cricket. The team has also added three dynamic Australian players—Josh Inglis, Glenn Maxwell, and Marcus Stoinis . Meanwhile, they retained players Shashank Singh and Prabhsimran Singh who will provide stability to the batting lineup. The bowling unit will be strengthened by the likes of Arshdeep Singh, Lockie Ferguson, Harpreet Brar, and Yash Thakur.caught up with Shashank to discuss the upcoming season, Shreyas Iyer’s leadership, Ponting’s influence, the impact of all-rounders Maxwell and Stoinis, Yuzvendra Chahal ’s role, and much more ...Obviously, with Shreyas and Ricky sir (Ricky Ponting) in, it's a huge confidence booster. Having known Shreyas for so many years, I know he's a very smart captain who works in a very strategic way. And from whatever I've heard about Ricky sir and the sessions I’ve had with him so far, I've really enjoyed them. He's someone who gives you the freedom, and that's the best thing a cricketer needs. Hopefully, we can turn the tables around this year. And like you said, we are chasing our first title, and hopefully, on the 26th of May, we'll get it.He has won so many trophies this year, which is a huge achievement. People crave even one or two trophies in a year, and he has won five. Obviously, luck plays a role, but his intelligence, hard work, and dedication towards the game are what truly matter.The way he’s bringing his work ethic to the Punjab franchise is amazing. He had multiple discussions with us even before the camp began, and now that he has joined, he is extremely eager to contribute—both individually and for the team. I know him well, and he’s an exceptionally smart captain. If all the stars align, he could win his sixth trophy and maybe even bring Punjab Kings their first title.The team is really strong, and the best part is that everyone is in form. If you look at Maxwell, the way he performed in the Big Bash, or Azmatullah Omarzai’s all-round contributions for Afghanistan. Then there's Josh Inglis, who scored a hundred in the Champions Trophy, Marco Jansen’s impressive bowling, and the way Shreyas is batting—it’s all coming together.It’s just about winning those crucial moments. If we perform as a unit and seize those moments, nothing can stop us. Off the field, too, it’s going to be an exciting experience. With players like Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, and others around—some of the best in world cricket—I’ll learn a lot. It’s not just about playing matches; it’s also about making memories off the field. It’s going to be a great experience.The players are still arriving, but most of them are here. I met Stoinis—he’s a very down-to-earth and chilled-out person. I also had a few conversations with Ricky Ponting sir again. He’s extremely talented, gives players a lot of freedom, and is very aggressive on the field but completely relaxed off it. That’s the best part about him. He creates a great atmosphere for us, and we’re all looking forward to playing under his mentorship and coaching.Arshdeep is someone who gives his all every time. I met him yesterday for the first time since last year’s IPL, and he’s becoming smarter—both on and off the field. His approach to the game has evolved, and we can see that in his bowling for the national team. Winning the ICC award was a huge achievement for him. The way he bowled in the T20 World Cup, especially in the Caribbean, in both the powerplay and the death overs, was incredible. His growth has been phenomenal, and it’s all down to his hard work—his dedication in net sessions and fitness training. He’s cool-headed, fun to be around in the dressing room, and always joking. But on the field, he remains calm under pressure, which is one of his biggest strengths.I’m very happy for Yuzi. He is one of the smartest bowlers I’ve faced. I have played against many quality bowlers in my career, and Yuzi stands out. I’ve spoken to him in the nets—he’s a thinking cricketer, and his skill level is top-notch. He has done exceptionally well for both the national team and in franchise cricket. There’s no doubt in my mind that he’ll continue to perform. He will be a key asset, especially in the middle overs for Punjab Kings. Watching him bowl in the nets, I can see how eager he is for the upcoming season.We all know about Maxwell’s power. On any given day, he’s a nightmare for bowlers. His innings against Afghanistan in the 2023 ODI World Cup was a prime example, along with several other performances. In the middle overs, Maxi can completely change the game on his day. Bowling-wise, Yuzi’s form has been outstanding, and if the Mullanpur wickets assist him, he’ll be lethal. Having experienced players like Maxi and Yuzi is crucial in the IPL. Young talent is important, but experience at this level makes a big difference. On their day, these two can single-handedly win matches.Last year, with God's grace and everyone's blessings, things went well. This year, it's a fresh season. So, when you step onto the field, your aim is always to win matches for your team, and that’s what I'll try to do. Sometimes you succeed, sometimes you don’t, but you always learn. I’ll give my best for the team—it’s not about any individual or personal goals, it's about taking the team across the line.Off the field, at times, things do affect you. But on the field, whether you're a Rs 30 crore player or a Rs 10 lakh player, it doesn’t matter. It’s just your bat, your ball, and your game. Off the field, people do talk, and sometimes, it can get to you. But as a professional, you need to handle it. Once you step onto the field and enter match mode, all these things hardly matter. The only thing that counts is how you contribute to your team’s victory.Last year, I was at base price, but my intensity will remain the same this year. Obviously, I’ll try to be smarter—learn from my mistakes, reduce them, and improve. I won’t say I'll be perfect, but I’ll work on minimising my errors and focus on winning games for the team.The retention process didn’t take much time. To be honest, I was busy with the domestic season, and there were just two or three calls. It was never about money. They knew the role I wanted, and I knew what they had in mind for me. The discussion was more about my role in the team rather than the financial aspect. I have an emotional connection with the franchise because of the trust they showed in me last year. They gave me opportunities, and I was extremely happy. Now, with the IPL just a week away, I’m really excited to be back in an environment where I feel comfortable. My goal remains the same—to give my best and win games for the team.T20 cricket is unpredictable, and your batting position can change based on the situation. Anywhere between No. 4 and No. 7, I have to be ready. Technically, I have worked on a few shots, but I’m not sure if I’ll start using them from game one. The IPL is a long tournament, with 14 league matches and knockouts, so I’ll first focus on settling in before experimenting. T20 is all about adapting. Some situations demand high-risk shots, while others require calculated cricket. Some wickets are suited for boundaries, others for six-hitting. It depends on multiple factors. Ultimately, my main goal is to win games for the team. I’ll work on avoiding the mistakes I made last season, especially in the IPL, and aim to improve my game.Ashu did really well for Punjab Kings, but now he’s with a new franchise, and I wish him all the best. However, when you look at our middle order this year, we have players who can step into his role. Someone like Suryansh Shedge, and even Priyansh Arya in the top order. There's a lot of talent in our team, and I’m looking forward to building partnerships with them. It will be great to share the dressing room with such talented players.","Punjab Kings are chasing their first IPL title under new skipper, Shreyas Iyer.

How much distance will teams travel in

New Delhi: During the recently concluded Champions Trophy , current and former players were left miffed by the fact that India played all their matches in Dubai. The team were stationed at one hotel, practiced at single facility, played at one venue and eventually, went on to win the tournament.The situation arose after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) didn't get the permission to travel to designated hosts Pakistan due to safety reasons. After talks between BCCI, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and International Cricket Council (ICC), a hybrid model was agreed upon with India's matches taking place in Dubai while rest played their fixtures in Rawalpindi, Lahore and Karachi.As it panned out, India, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa were all in Dubai ahead of the semi-final as Group A went down to the wire. With India beating New Zealand in the final group game, South Africa and New Zealand returned to Pakistan for the semi-final.The scheduling and logistics meant South Africa flew to Dubai the morning after their last round robin fixture, reached the UAE in the afternoon and after ascertaining their fate, were preparing for flight back less than 12 hours after landing.David Miller highlighted this travel nightmare after their exit. ""It's only an hour and 40 minute flight, but the fact that we had to do that was not ideal,"" Miller said after South Africa's 50-run defeat to New Zealand.""It's early morning, it's after a game and we had to fly. Then we got to Dubai at 4:00 pm. And at 7.30 am we had to come back. It doesn't make it nice. It's not like we flew five hours, and we had enough time to recover and recuperate, but it was not an ideal situation still.""Over the course of next eight weeks, cricketers will do much of that during the Indian Premier League (IPL). All 10 IPL teams will play 14 games - seven at home and seven away. In effect they will play at eight different venues. The exceptions to this are Delhi Capitals, Rajasthan Royals and Punjab Kings, who will play at nine venues. DC, RR and PBKS have second homes venues in Visakhapatnam, Guwahati and Dharamsala.DC, who will be chasing their first IPL title, now led by Axar Patel, will travel the second-shortest distance of the 10 teams. Where Royal Challengers Bengaluru, another maiden title chasers, will travel over 17,000 kms in the league stage alone, DC will fly 9,270kms around the country - second only to Sunrisers Hyderabad (8500-plus kms.)As Miller's recounting of the events can suggest, life of an IPL cricketer is taxing beyond the regular challenges of the cricket field. It involves playing a match, packing, flying the next day, practice and then getting ready for the next fixture with very little turnaround time.""This is all mental. If you look at it in a toxic way, it will look toxic. If you enjoy it, you'd consider it a daily routine,"" said DC's Abhishek Porel to a query by TimesofIndia.com. ""You need to know when to enter game mode, to switch on and when to enter chill mode.""""For us, it is a practice that we undertake throughout the year. It is normal. There's a match, then travel and then match again. It happens all the time.""His teammate Karun Nair, who played a starring role in Vidarbha's Ranji Trophy title success, concurred with Porel.""I think all of us are playing the game that we love. I don't think we should have any complaints about travel. All of us have played enough to understand these things come with playing cricket at this level.

IPL mega auction: Finally! R Ashwin returns to Chennai Super Kings

In a pre-season promotional ad, Sanju Samson is seen telling MS Dhoni that a new 13-year-old boy in the Rajasthan Royals squad will win an IPL title before the Chennai Super Kings legend retires! The tongue-in-cheek comment will resonate with fans.“Will this be Dhoni’s last IPL?” That’s a question around which a cottage industry has sprung up over the last few IPL seasons. There’s no definitive answer to that question yet. No one exactly knows when it’s going to happen. And by now, Dhoni himself has started enjoying this cat-and-mouse game. He loves to come up with cryptic comments about his “last few years in cricket” here and there, sending everyone in a tizzy.After his international retirement way back in Aug 2020, the 43-year-old’s batting prowess has been understandably on the wane. His body, quite clearly, struggles to take the wear and tear of the two-month grind that is the IPL. In the last two years, he mostly restricted himself to 10-ball cameos, in which he looked to clear the fence.While he has struggled to manoeuvre the strike against spinners in the middle overs, his knees are not good enough to go for those super-quick singles that he was a master of in his prime.But then, that’s just part of the narrative. The IPL is not just about batting, bowling or fielding skills. Dhoni, though, remains a magnificent wicketkeeper. His experience and subtle fielding changes play a massive role. There’s absolutely no doubt nobody understands the on-field dynamics in an IPL game better than Dhoni.The topic of Dhoni’s restricted game-time often comes up in conversations with Chennai Super Kings officials. Their standard reply is, “You can never buy experience in the market. It’s up to Dhoni to decide when he wants to go.”There’s one thing, however, that needs to be made clear — Dhoni doesn’t allow himself to be a liability on the field. If we look at his IPL 2024 stats, we will see that he has scored only 167 runs in 14 games, but his average is 53.66 and strike-rate a ridiculous 220.54.In fact, the fear factor that Dhoni still generates at the back-end of an innings is unmatched. If we go back to CSK ’s last game against RCB in 2024, Dhoni almost pulled off a miracle chasing a huge score, until the ball had to be changed when a six that he hit off left-arm pacer Yash Dayal in the 20th over vanished outside the ground. The new ball was dry and hard, Dayal got some extra bounce and induced an edge off Dhoni’s bat that finished CSK’s hopes of qualifying for the playoffs.Had CSK made the last-four stage, there was a possibility that it could have been Dhoni’s final IPL outing. The qualifier and the final were in Chennai and Dhoni would have got a chance to keep a promise that he had made to his fans a few years ago: “I will play my last IPL match at the MA Chidambaram Stadium.” Dhoni doesn’t always make promises, but if he does, he tries to keep them.The IPL management, too, has played its part to ensure Dhoni gets a shot at fulfilling his promise. They tweaked a retention rule, allowing a player who retired from international cricket five years ago to be retained for Rs 4 crore ahead of the big auction. The beneficiary, obviously, was CSK and Dhoni.The legend, though, is trying his best to be in the best shape for this IPL. He was one of the first to arrive in Chennai about a month ago and has been training hard. The news that filters out of the camp suggests that his body is in better shape than where it was last year. The batting, too, isn’t going badly.New CSK captain Ruturaj Gaikwad , too, has settled in well and there seems to be a core in place for the next few years. Still, Dhoni remains the ‘super boss’ of the team. Come the 19th over of a tight game, it will still be MSD making those field changes and Gaikwad will probably man the long-off boundary.Not that the CSK diehards will mind one bit. It’s a love story that they don’t want to end, come what may.","MS Dhoni's batting prowess has been understandably on the wane.

CSK SQUAD FOR IPL 2025

NEW DELHI: When discussing title contenders in the IPL, the name Chennai Super Kings (CSK) inevitably rises to the top, thanks to their on-field dominance and a record five titles. With IPL 2025 set to commence on March 22 and CSK kicking off their campaign against fellow five-time champions Mumbai Indians on March 23 at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, all eyes will be on the Yellow Army and their iconic leader Mahendra Singh Dhoni.CSK's dominance can be attributed to the legendary Dhoni, under whose captaincy the team has secured five titles, reached the final ten times, and advanced to the playoffs on 12 occasions.After finishing as runners-up in the inaugural 2008 season, CSK made it to the semifinals in 2009. The following two years, 2010 and 2011, saw them clinch back-to-back titles, establishing their supremacy.In 2012 and 2013, CSK reached the finals but fell short, losing to Kolkata Knight Riders and Mumbai Indians, respectively. In 2014, they missed out on the final after being defeated by Punjab Kings (then Kings XI Punjab) in Qualifier 2.CSK's resurgence came in 2015 when they reached the final once again, only to lose to Mumbai Indians. However, the team faced a major setback when they were suspended from the IPL for two years (2016 and 2017) due to the 2013 IPL spot-fixing and betting scandal.The suspension did not diminish CSK's spirit. They returned triumphantly in IPL 2018, winning the title. In 2019, they narrowly missed out on the championship, losing to Mumbai Indians by just one run in a thrilling final.In 2020, CSK experienced their first failure to qualify for the playoffs, exiting after the league stage. However, they rebounded strongly in 2021 to claim their fourth title.The 2022 season saw another setback as CSK once again failed to reach the playoffs. Yet, they staged a remarkable comeback in 2023, clinching their fifth title.The 2024 season marked a significant change as Dhoni handed over the captaincy to Ruturaj Gaikwad . Unfortunately, the transition did not yield the desired results, as CSK faced an early exit, finishing fifth in the league stage with seven wins and seven losses, amassing 14 points.As IPL 2025 approaches, the burning question remains: Can CSK add a sixth trophy to their decorated cabinet?CSK have consistently checked all the boxes heading into tournaments, which explains their sustained dominance over the years.With the strategic brilliance of Dhoni still in the squad, CSK boast a formidable top-order lineup featuring New Zealand batting stars Rachin Ravindra and Devon Conway, along with the experienced Rahul Tripathi. Staying true to their tradition of prioritising all-rounders, CSK have once again picked a solid side, including Shivam Dube, Deepak Hooda, Vijay Shankar, Ravindra Jadeja, Sam Curran, and Ravichandran Ashwin.CSK's bowling attack also appears well-balanced, with the likes of Jamie Overton, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Khaleel Ahmed, Shreyas Gopal, Matheesha Pathirana, Mukesh Choudhary, Nathan Ellis, and Noor Ahmad.The only chink in CSK's armour seems to be their captaincy.Ruturaj Gaikwad, who was entrusted with the leadership role in IPL 2024, fell short of expectations as CSK finished fifth in IPL 2024 with seven wins and as many losses.CSK will be hoping that Ruturaj can put the 2024 disappointment behind him and lead the team with fiery determination to secure their sixth title.Devon Conway/Rachin Ravindra*, Ruturaj Gaikwad (capt), Rahul Tripathi, Deepak Hooda/Vijay Shankar, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Sam Curran*, MS Dhoni (wk), R Ashwin, Noor Ahmad/Nathan Ellis*, Matheesha Pathirana*, Khaleel Ahmed (*denotes overseas player)Devon Conway, Rachin Ravindra, Ruturaj Gaikwad (capt), Rahul Tripathi, Deepak Hooda, Vijay Shankar, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Sam Curran, MS Dhoni (wk), R Ashwin, Noor Ahmad, Nathan Ellis, Matheesha Pathirana, Khaleel Ahmed, C Andre Siddarth, Vansh Bedi, Shaik Rasheed, Ramakrishna Ghosh, Shreyas Gopal, Anshul Kamboj, Gurjapneet Singh, Mukesh Choudhary, Kamlesh Nagarkoti","Chennai Super Kings (CSK) have won a record five IPL titles.

Will Rohit Sharma win 2027 World Cup? Astrologer Lobo predicts after getting Champions Trophy bang on!

NEW DELHI: India cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has praised the incredible depth of Indian cricket following the team's unbeaten run to the 2025 Champions Trophy title, achieved even without ace pacer Jasprit Bumrah . Reflecting on the triumph, Gavaskar made a bold claim that no individual player is indispensable in the current Indian lineup — not even veteran batters Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma Writing in his column for Mid-Day, Gavaskar remarked, ""The triumph in the Champions Trophy and that too without Bumrah also emphasises that nobody is indispensable in this game. In the past too, India has won without Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, but there’s not the slightest doubt that their presence in the team gives the team an even more invincible look.""Gavaskar lauded Team India ’s resilience after bouncing back from a dismal Test series defeat against Australia to clinch victory in the England T20Is and ODIs, followed by the Champions Trophy. He noted how the team’s ability to triumph without their key players showcased the immense talent pool in Indian cricket.""Very seldom has a team depended on one individual like the Indians depended on Jasprit Bumrah in Australia, and his absence from the bowling attack to defend the small target set by India tilted the scales Australia’s way,"" Gavaskar said. ""For the Indian team to bounce back the way they did with comprehensive wins in the ODI and T20 series against England that were played on the team’s return to India tells volumes of the talent that Indian cricket has.""The cricketing great also acknowledged the support from overseas players, who admitted that India would have emerged victorious regardless of the location, dismissing claims that the Dubai setting played a decisive role. ""It is good to see so many overseas cricketers now coming up and saying India would have won anyway wherever they played and not only because they were stationed in Dubai,"" Gavaskar added.Gavaskar’s remarks reflect a sense of confidence in the current Indian setup, asserting that while legends like Kohli and Rohit undeniably elevate the team, the core strength lies in the depth and talent of the entire squad.","India cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has praised the incredible depth of Indian cricket following the team's unbeaten run to the 2025 Champions Trophy title.

Can Shreyas Iyer and Ricky Ponting finally bring PBKS their maiden IPL title?

NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings have experienced a rollercoaster journey in the Indian Premier League (IPL) since the tournament's inception in 2008. Despite boasting star-studded squads over the years, consistency has been their biggest challenge.The franchise, formerly known as Kings XI Punjab, delivered their best performance in 2014 when they reached the final but lost to Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) by three wickets in the title clash.Since then, the team has struggled to progress beyond the league stage.Determined to change their fortunes, Punjab Kings made bold moves in the IPL 2025 Mega Auction where they splurged on marquee players like Shreyas Iyer, Marcus Stoinis, Marco Jansen, Glenn Maxwell, Lockie Ferguson and Yuzvendra Chahal.The franchise has now handed the captaincy to Iyer, hoping his leadership will guide them to their first-ever IPL title .

He often says, ‘Always give your team a good start,’ and I always follow that,"" the right-hander said.""In IPL, I will do my best to provide my team with strong starts.

There have been phases in my career where my focus wasn't necessarily on winning but on surviving and holding my ground,"" Hardik said while talking to 'JioHotstar' ahead of the IPL starting March 22.""I realised that no matter what was happening around me, cricket would always be my greatest ally...I kept pushing through, and when all the hard work finally paid off, it was beyond anything I could have scripted.""The six-month phase where we won the (T20) World Cup, and then the kind of love and support I received upon returning -- it was a complete 360-degree turnaround for me,"" the 31-year-old Hardik added.""I didn't know exactly when that would happen, but as they say, destiny had its plan, and in my case, everything changed within two and a half months.""He had a message for the youngsters, urging them to be patient with themselves whatever the situation.""...Believe in yourself...the biggest challenge at this stage is self-doubt. Sometimes, players start questioning whether they belong at this level, and that doubt can take away from their skill set. Managing that mental aspect is crucial,"" he said.""In this game, there will be highs and lows. The key is to remain balanced, not just for one season but throughout their careers.""Hardik made significant contributions alongside Mohammed Shami, particularly with the new ball, during India's successful Champions Trophy campaign, while Jasprit Bumrah was unavailable.Despite MI's disappointing performance in the 2024 IPL season, Hardik expressed confidence in the team's prospects. He believes that MI managed to assemble a balanced squad at the mega auction last November.""Having played in the IPL for almost 11 years now, each season brings new energy and fresh positivity. The 2024 season was undoubtedly challenging for us as a group, but it also provided invaluable lessons,"" the MI captain said.""We analysed those learnings and applied them while building our team for 2025. This time, we have assembled an experienced squad -- players who have played a lot of cricket at the highest level. That in itself is exciting.""Playing in the IPL in Mumbai, particularly at Wankhede, can be intimidating due to the high-scoring nature of the pitch. We wanted bowlers with experience, pace, and the ability to generate swing and bounce. I believe we have put together a well-balanced team, one that meets all our requirements from top to bottom. Now it's about turning up and delivering on the field,"" he added.","Hardik Pandya has been named in India's triumphant T20 World Cup and ICC Champions Trophy teams. The all-rounder is the captain of Mumbai Indians in the upcoming Indian Premier League IPL season. MI finished bottom of the league table in 2024, with Hardik receiving jeers from fans.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119107009,imgsize-44302,width-400,resizemode-4/119107009.jpg"

His previous stint with RCB yielded 7 wickets across eight matches in three seasons.Akash Deep hasn’t joined the LSG practice sessions yet, though he was spotted at a preparatory camp a month ago. The team management has maintained silence on his fitness status.LSG acquired him for Rs 8 crore during the mega auction in November last year.Mohsin was seen in practice sessions but was missing in practice matches, indicating his ongoing recovery phase. Meanwhile, Avesh Khan and Mayank Yadav continue their rehabilitation programme at the National Cricket Academy (Bengaluru), explaining their absence from team sessions.Encouraging news emerged from NCA for LSG when footage of their premier pacer Mayank Yadav bowling at nets surfaced on social media. Regarded as one of India’s most promising players, injuries have impeded his progress. Yadav, out of action since October 2024, is expected to miss the initial phase of IPL 2025 .LSG retained him for Rs 11 crore ahead of IPL 2025.Notably, Indian all-rounder Shardul Thakur was spotted at LSG camp on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Premier League (IPL) has been a launchpad for many of today’s cricketing superstars, particularly in Indian cricket. Each season introduces fresh talent eager to make a mark, and IPL 2025 is no exception. Several uncapped players will be aiming to seize their opportunities and take their careers to the next level.Robin Minz was set to make his IPL debut last season with Gujarat Titans, but a road accident delayed his dreams. Now, the 22-year-old Jharkhand wicketkeeper-batter gets a fresh start with Mumbai Indians, who secured him for Rs 65 lakh—more than double his base price of Rs 30 lakh. Minz has shown glimpses of his explosive batting, boasting a staggering T20 strike rate of 181. Though he has only played six innings so far, his hard-hitting ability makes him a player to watch.One of India’s breakout domestic stars in 2024, Suryansh Shedge announced himself on the big stage with a match-winning knock in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy final. Mumbai, chasing 175 against Madhya Pradesh, were in trouble at 129/5 when Shedge turned the game around with a blistering 36* off 15 balls, including three fours and four sixes. He also dismissed Venkatesh Iyer in the same match.Shedge finished the tournament with 131 runs in nine innings at an astonishing strike rate of 251.92, averaging 43.66. He also took eight wickets at an average of 23. With solid performances in the Vijay Hazare Trophy and Ranji Trophy, he now has a golden opportunity to impress in the IPL. Punjab Kings acquired him for his base price of ?30 lakh.One of the biggest surprises at last year’s IPL mega auction was Rajasthan Royals signing 13-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi for Rs 1.1 crore. The Bihar-born prodigy became the youngest-ever IPL player and already boasts several records at the junior level.He made his first-class debut for Bihar in January 2024 at just 12 years and 284 days old. Last year, he made headlines by scoring a 58-ball century for India U-19 against Australia U-19 in Chennai. He was also the seventh-highest run-getter in the ACC Under-19 Asia Cup 2024-25, scoring 176 runs in five matches, including a top score of 76*. While he is still at the start of his career, Suryavanshi’s raw talent makes him a fascinating prospect.Nephew of Tamil Nadu stalwart S Sharath, 18-year-old C Andre Siddarth has already made an impression in red-ball cricket. He was one of the standout performers in the Ranji Trophy, amassing 612 runs in 12 innings at an impressive average of 68.00, with one century and five fifties.Though he has yet to play an official T20 match, Siddarth has featured in the Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL), where he displayed his all-round skills. It remains to be seen if he can replicate his Ranji Trophy success in the fast-paced format of the IPL.The only overseas player on this list, Bevon Jacobs, is a Pretoria-born cricketer who has represented New Zealand domestic sides Auckland and Canterbury. Despite having played just six T20 innings when Mumbai Indians signed him for Rs 20 lakh, his strike rate of 189 at the time caught the franchise’s attention.In 20 T20 matches, Jacobs has accumulated 423 runs in 17 innings at an average of 32.53 and a strike rate of over 148, with two fifties and a highest score of 90*. His ability to score quickly makes him an exciting addition to Mumbai Indians' power-packed lineup.","The Indian Premier League (IPL) has been a launchpad for many of today’s cricketing superstars.

His century was the fastest ever recorded by an Indian in youth Tests and the second-fastest overall.Suryavanshi had already made history by debuting in the Ranji Trophy for Bihar at just 12, becoming the youngest player in India’s premier first-class tournament. He also became the youngest-ever cricketer to represent India at the U-19 level.His talent was on full display at the ACC U19 Asia Cup 2024, where he scored a blazing 67 off 36 balls in the semifinal, following up on his unbeaten 76 off 46 balls against UAE.The records kept tumbling as Suryavanshi became the youngest Indian to play List-A cricket during the Vijay Hazare Trophy 2024-25, surpassing the previous record held by Ali Akbar, who debuted at 14 years and 51 days in 1999-2000.Delhi's explosive opener Priyansh Arya earned a Rs 3.8 crore contract with Punjab Kings after a stellar run in the inaugural Delhi Premier League (DPL), where he topped the run charts with 608 runs in ten innings for South Delhi Superstarz.Arya turned heads when he smashed six sixes in an over during the tournament, cementing his reputation as a destructive batter.He was also Delhi’s leading run-scorer in the 2023-24 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, accumulating 222 runs in seven innings at an average of 31.71 and a strike rate of 166.91. Despite being shortlisted for the IPL 2024 auction, he went unsold—a situation he has now turned around with his performances.New Zealand’s uncapped batting sensation Bevon Jacobs joins Mumbai Indians after a remarkable 157-run knock for Auckland against Central Districts in the Plunket Shield 2024-25.Jacobs made an instant impact on debut, scoring a blistering 42 off 20 balls for Canterbury in the Super Smash 2023-24 curtain-raiser.

Punjab Kings secured him for Rs 2.6 crore in the mega auction.Inglis made waves with a century on his ODI debut, guiding Australia to a thrilling chase of 352 against England in the Champions Trophy. He followed it up with a Test century on debut in Galle, joining an elite group of Australians with international centuries across all three formats.One of his two T20I centuries came against India in 2023, where he tore through a bowling attack featuring several IPL stars, including his new teammate Arshdeep Singh.Inglis has played 29 T20Is, amassing 706 runs, with a career-best score of 110.One of the surprise signings of the mega auction, English all-rounder Jacob Bethell was picked up by Royal Challengers Bengaluru for Rs 2.6 crore. The left-handed batter, who also bowls left-arm orthodox spin, is seen as a potential replacement for Glenn Maxwell and Will Jacks, who were not retained after IPL 2024.Bethell has an explosive T20I strike rate of 167.96 and has been utilized in various batting roles, from opening to middle-order and even as a finisher in ODIs.His rapid rise in 2024 saw him make his T20I and ODI debuts against Australia, followed by a Test debut against New Zealand in Christchurch.Performances in the T20 Blast for Warwickshire and The Hundred for Birmingham Phoenix earned him England caps across all formats. His form also caught the attention of T20 franchises worldwide, leading to stints with Melbourne Renegades, Paarl Royals, and now RCB.Bethell registered his maiden Big Bash League half-century for Melbourne Renegades against Hobart Hurricanes in January, adding to his growing reputation as a dynamic all-rounder.","The 2025 Indian Premier League (IPL) kicks off on March 22 and will feature 74 matches across 13 venues.

Punjab Kings, one of the founding franchises of the Indian Premier League (IPL), continue their quest for a maiden title since their debut in 2008. Punjab have consistently struggled to find success in the league, only reaching the final once (in 2014) in their 17 attempts so far.Last season was yet another disappointment as they finished ninth, just ahead of Mumbai Indians. However, the franchise has made significant changes in a bid to finally claim the coveted trophy.The most notable change comes in the form of a new leader at the helm — Shreyas Iyer. Acquired for a staggering Rs 26.75 crore, Iyer takes over the captaincy after an impressive title-winning stint with Kolkata Knight Riders last season. His leadership qualities and proven record as a middle-order rock make him the ideal choice to spearhead Punjab’s campaign. Iyer’s presence in the batting lineup adds stability, while his ability to anchor and accelerate will be crucial for the team. They have also brought in Ricky Ponting as their new head coach.Punjab Kings have chosen to hit the reset button by retaining only two players from the previous season — dynamic wicketkeeper-batter Prabhsimran Singh and dependable all-rounder Shashank Singh. The franchise has assembled a balanced squad, blending explosive batting firepower with potent bowling resources. Glenn Maxwell , brought back to Punjab after stints with other franchises, will add firepower to the middle order, while Josh Inglis, the Australian wicketkeeper-batter, will provide flexibility in the batting unit.In the bowling department, Punjab boast one of the most well-rounded attacks in the league. Indian speedster Arshdeep Singh will lead the pace battery, joined by the express pace of Lockie Ferguson and the versatile Marco Jansen. The spin department is equally formidable, with veteran leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal and left-arm spinner Harpreet Brar offering control and wicket-taking ability. All-rounders like Marcus Stoinis and Azmatullah Omarzai further strengthen the lineup, providing depth in both batting and bowling.Prabhsimran Singh, Priyansh Arya, Shreyas Iyer (Captain), Shashank Singh, Azmatullah Omarzai, Glenn Maxwell, Marco Jansen, Arshdeep Singh, Lockie Ferguson, Yuzvendra Chahal, Harpreet BrarWith a rejuvenated squad and an inspirational leader in Shreyas Iyer, Punjab Kings look poised to challenge for the IPL title. The balance between explosive batting and lethal bowling makes them a force to be reckoned with. If they can overcome the perennial inconsistency that has plagued them in past seasons, this could be the year they finally break their title drought.","Punjab Kings are one of the founding franchises of the Indian Premier League (IPL) Punjab have consistently struggled to find success in the league, only reaching the final once (in 2014) in their 17 attempts so far.

Crossing 30 in India is considered like a crime: Sachin Baby,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/crossing-30-in-india-is-considered-like-a-crime-sachin-baby/articleshow/119168484.cms,"Sachin Baby (Image credit: X)

IPL: How will GT, LSG, DC, PBKS, RR fare? Greenstone Lobo predicts

Kerala captain and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) batter Sachin Baby , who is set to feature in the IPL after four years, believes that crossing 30 is often treated as a crime in India, with sportspersons being written off too soon. He criticised this mindset, pointing out that in countries like Australia and England, many cricketers start playing professional cricket after turning 30.""If you look at football, we don’t call Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi veteran footballers. Instead, they are seen as sources of motivation. However, in India, players are branded as veterans far too easily,"" said the 36-year-old batter in an interaction with TOI.""I used to feel shy about revealing my age. If I was 34, I would say 33 instead. But that changed after I observed how MS Dhoni and 45-year-old Indian tennis star Rohan Bopanna carry themselves. Bopanna believes he is at 'level 45' rather than worrying about being 45 years old. He continues to dominate world tennis and achieve success without letting age bother him. Now, I proudly share my age. If any youngster can outmatch me in terms of fitness, they are welcome to call me a veteran. It all comes down to self-belief,"" he added.Baby described his four-year absence from the IPL as ""very difficult"" and felt his return to the tournament was long overdue.""I did things that nobody else did. I would start training at 5 AM and continue until 8. In the evening, I would focus on strength and running sessions. I worked extremely hard, scored big runs, and always believed that I just needed one opportunity to prove myself. So, this call-up is no surprise,"" said the SRH batter.Baby also credited Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni for pushing him beyond his limits and guiding him towards the right mental approach. The SRH batter played alongside Kohli in IPL 2016, 2017, and 2021.""Kohli made me believe that work ethic is everything. You have to be willing to make sacrifices. Due to his influence, I started training for five to six hours a day instead of just three. In IPL 2016, I batted at No. 6 for RCB—a position where you can either be a hero or a zero. To ensure more success in such situations, I kept working on my skills, and I am confident about giving my 120% if a similar situation arises,"" he said.""Dhoni, on the other hand, taught me to follow the process rather than obsessing over the outcome. Many cricketers make it to the IPL and immediately start chasing success, ignoring the process. However, to truly succeed, you need to dedicate yourself to long hours of practice, get proper rest, and avoid distractions,"" Baby added.",Sachin Baby is set to return to the IPL for the first time in four years. The 36-year-old believes that crossing 30 is often treated as a crime in India. Baby also credited Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni for pushing him.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119169916,imgsize-41442,width-400,resizemode-4/119169916.jpg"
