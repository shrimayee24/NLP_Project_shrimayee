Is Rodgers headed for a coaching role in San Francisco?



Aaron Rodgers Caught Deeply Contemplating His Future On Beach | Pat McAfee Show

Why the 49ers and Why now?



Aaron Rodgers’ future in the NFL remains one of the biggest talking points in football. While teams like the Pittsburgh Steelers and New York Giants are rumored to be in the mix, a surprising alternative has emerged—coaching. Reports suggest Rodgers may step away from playing in 2025 and join the San Francisco 49ers ’ staff, potentially setting the stage for a major leadership role in the future.Rodgers has repeatedly dismissed the idea of coaching post-retirement, but circumstances change. As one of the most intelligent quarterbacks in NFL history, he possesses the strategic mind that could make him a successful coach. With insiders predicting that he may not suit up in 2025, some believe he could step into a coaching role with the 49ers, possibly positioning himself as Kyle Shanahan ’s eventual replacement.""While Kyle Shanahan is safe for the 2025 NFL season, there is a real chance that his future in 2026 is not,"" Marissa Myers noted. ""With that in mind, it presents the perfect opportunity for Rodgers to take the next step in his career, and enter the realm of coaching."" (via: Sporting News)Also Read: Steelers set to sign veteran QB in 2025 Free Agency, but it’s not who you think Shanahan has guided San Francisco to multiple deep playoff runs, but his tenure has also been marked by inconsistency. With four playoff misses in eight seasons, concerns about his long-term viability continue to grow. Critics argue that his inability to adapt is holding the 49ers back. Rodgers, a four-time MVP, could bring a fresh perspective and serve as a mentor for young quarterback Brock Purdy, helping the team transition into its next phase.Adding to the intrigue, Rodgers’ California roots make this move even more compelling. A lifelong 49ers fan, he once dreamed of being drafted by them. If he transitions into coaching, leading his hometown team would be a full-circle moment in his storied career.Rodgers remains unpredictable, keeping fans and analysts on edge. But if he decides to swap his helmet for a headset, the 49ers could be his next big move, one that shakes up the NFL landscape and redefines his legacy.","Aaron Rodgers may step away from playing in 2025 and join the San Francisco 49ers ’ staff.

Donna Kelce’s health struggles highlight importance of support systems



Travis Kelce, the NFL's most well-known star, has been the subject of debate regarding his future in football. While fans wonder if he will retire, fresh reports indicate that personal reasons, such as his mother Donna Kelce's health issues, are taking center stage in his decision-making.The Kansas City Chiefs tight end, Travis Kelce has never been shy about his tight-knit relationship with his family, especially his mom, Donna Kelce. She recently shared about a difficult health condition that has touched their family deeply. Though details are not made public, it's clear that her condition has given Kelce's already grueling career an added emotional burden.Her fight is a harsh reminder of the need to put both physical and emotional health first. The NFL has come a long way in advancing health awareness, from pushing regular medical check-ups to developing mental health programs. Kelce, through his own experiences, is also increasing the call for these conversations.Travis Kelce's retirement has become a burning issue, particularly following another Super Bowl win with the Chiefs. Whereas his physicality in the sport has been questioned extensively, now his mental and emotional health become important factors.Balancing the constant demands of professional football with personal issues is no simple matter. Kelce's case highlights how deeply personal issues can drive an athlete's career choices. Whether it's injuries, family obligations, or mental exhaustion, these issues weigh heavily in deciding how long to remain in the game.Mental health activism in sport has gained pace over the past decade, with great numbers of athletes openly discussing their dilemmas. Kelce's case further reiterates the need for support mechanisms, both team-based and family-based, to allow players to make choices that promote their well-being.Kelce's impact is felt off the field as well. As a vocal mental health advocate, he has contributed to mainstreaming discussions on emotional resilience and psychological well-being in high-stress settings.

""Denver was adamant about retaining Porter amid NBA trade rumors this season,""

The Los Angeles Lakers are reportedly considering a major roster shakeup as they weigh the possibility of parting ways with Austin Reaves to pursue Denver Nuggets star Michael Porter Jr. The move, which could significantly bolster the Lakers' three-point shooting, comes amid their push to solidify their position in the Western Conference playoff race.Since acquiring Luka Doncic in a blockbuster trade on February 2, the Lakers have shown flashes of brilliance but have struggled recently, losing their last three games. Despite the setbacks, the team remains in contention for the No. 2 seed in the West. However, their three-point shooting has been a glaring weakness this season, with the team shooting just 35.7% from beyond the arc under head coach JJ Redick.This has led to speculation that the Los Angeles Lakers may target Michael Porter Jr., a proven three-point specialist, in the offseason. Porter, who signed a $179 million contract with the Nuggets, has been one of the league's most consistent long-range shooters since entering the NBA. As a rookie, he shot an impressive 42.2% from downtown and has maintained a high level of efficiency, connecting on at least 39.7% of his three-point attempts in four of his last five seasons.This season, the 2023 NBA champion is averaging 18.2 points and 6.9 rebounds per game while shooting 50.6% from the field and 39.9% from three-point range. His ability to move without the ball and deliver a flawless release makes him an ideal fit for a Los Angeles Lakers team in need of reliable perimeter shooting.While Austin Reaves has been a versatile and valuable asset for the Lakers, Porter's elite shooting could provide the team with a significant upgrade. Reaves has been a key contributor, but his skill set may not be enough to address the Lakers' most pressing needs.However, acquiring Porter won't be easy. The Nuggets have consistently expressed their commitment to keeping him, especially after his crucial role in their championship run.making it unlikely they would part with him unless he experiences a decline in performance.Also read: NBA Offseason Rumors: Golden State Warriors eyeing $90 million Los Angeles Clippers star to push Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler's championship aspirations As the playoffs approach, the Los Angeles Lakers are expected to keep a close eye on Porter's situation.

PANAJI: Whenever Diego Godin closes his eyes and thinks of that magical night of May 17, 2014, at the Camp Nou, the former Atletico de Madrid defender remembers every scene almost perfectly.The frenzied start by hosts Barcelona , a lightning strike from Alexis Sanchez to put the home team ahead and the inspirational half-time talk from his team’s manager, Diego Simeone.It was the concluding clash of La Liga , and having lost the chance to wrap up the Spanish league title earlier, Atletico needed at least a point at the Camp Nou with Barca also chasing the title. Both Diego Costa and Arda Turan were taken off injured in the first 45 minutes. Then, as ends were changed, Godin powered a header from Koke’s corner to put Atletico level and eventually end the duopoly in Spanish football .It was their first league title in 18 years and the first time in ten years anyone outside Barcelona and Real Madrid had had a taste of it.“It wasn’t easy for us to win that championship at the Camp Nou,” Godin, now retired, said during a global media call arranged by La Liga on Saturday. “There were so many emotions, so much joy. If I have to handpick my best memory from my time at Atletico, the key moment was clearly that goal.”Since that 2014 triumph, Atletico have won La Liga just once, with Barcelona and Madrid taking turns to become champions. Now they have another chance as Barcelona visit the Wanda Metropolitano on Sunday. The Catalans are currently just one point ahead of the two Madrid clubs, with a game in hand.Defeat at Getafe last week put a massive dent in Atletico’s own title bid.“I wouldn’t say it’s a decisive clash but it’s an important one in the title race. If Atletico win, it will help the team a lot and lift their morale after their elimination from the Champions League (against rivals Real Madrid on penalties). Another defeat will be very hard to take,"" said Godin.“The (Champions League) defeat was very painful. It hurts more because Atletico were really enthusiastic and excited about going through (to the next stage). When you are eliminated from a competition where you’re so excited, you feel very empty (after a defeat).”Under Simeone, the former Uruguay captain and the country’s most capped footballer turned himself into a leader and the force around whom the team revolved. For nine years, he made close to 400 appearances, winning La Liga, two Europa Leagues, one Copa del Rey, one Spanish Super Cup and three UEFA Super Cups.Atletico also made it to the final of the Champions League twice, only to lose both times to bitter rivals Real Madrid.“When I joined, Atletico were a long way from Barcelona and Real Madrid but now it’s a team that can compete on equal terms. We’ve won leagues against them. We’ve got to the finals of Champions League, of Copa del Rey, the Super Cup.“So, you can imagine how the club has grown, and how the club continues to grow. It’s got better quality players, young players. The very equal competitiveness in sporting terms with Real and Barca is important. We cannot compete with them in terms of their finances, but in terms of sport, we can give them a fight,” said Godin.",Diego Godin won the La Liga title with Atletico de Madrid in May 2014. Godin scored the winning goal against Barcelona at the Camp Nou. Atletico have won La Liga just once since that triumph. Barcelona visit Atletico on Sunday in the final game of the season.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119065419,imgsize-91406,width-400,resizemode-4/119065419.jpg"

Will Rohit Sharma win 2027 World Cup? Astrologer Lobo predicts after getting Champions Trophy bang on!

NEW DELHI: Star Indian batter Virat Kohli dropped a major hint about his cricketing future on Saturday, admitting that he ""might not have another Australia tour in him."" Kohli made the candid revelation while speaking at the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) Innovation Lab after arriving in Bengaluru ahead of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025.Reflecting on his recent struggles on Australian soil, Kohli stated, ""I might not have another Australia tour in me, so I am at peace with whatever happened in the past."" The statement has sparked speculation among fans about whether the cricketing icon is considering stepping away from Test cricket in the near future.Despite the speculation, Kohli clarified that he is not mulling retirement at the moment, emphasising that he still loves playing the game. ""Don't get nervous. I'm not making any announcements. As of now, everything is fine. I still love playing the game,"" he reassured his fans. The prolific batter added that he no longer aspires to achieve milestones, instead focusing on playing for the ""pure joy"" of the sport.""It pretty much comes down to just the pure joy, enjoyment, competitive streak, and love for the game. And as long as that is there, I will continue to play. As I said today, I am not playing for any achievement,"" Kohli said.Kohli also shared insights into the challenges of finding the right moment to retire, recalling a conversation with former Indian captain Rahul Dravid. ""The competitive streak doesn't allow you to find the answer [for retirement]. I had a very interesting conversation with Rahul Dravid. He said you always have to stay in touch with yourself. Figure out where you are placed in your life, and the answer is not that easy,"" he explained.The 36-year-old acknowledged that advancing age has made it tougher to maintain peak performance. ""Now, it takes much more effort as people who have played the game for a long period of time understand. You can't do so many things in your mid to late 30s that you can in your mid-20s. I'm at a bit of a different place in my life as well,"" Kohli admitted.Despite recent struggles, including a lackluster performance on the most recent Australia tour, Kohli has come to terms with his ups and downs. ""You have to make peace with whatever's happened in your life. Like in 2014 [against England], I still had the chance to go in 2018 and do what I did. It might not have been the case this time,"" he said.Kohli also touched on his mental approach to failure, emphasising the importance of blocking out external pressure. ""Once you start thinking of the disappointment from the outside, then you start burdening yourself way more. That’s something I've surely experienced in Australia as well,"" he noted.Beyond his own future, Kohli expressed his optimism about Indian cricket and the evolving landscape of women's sports, particularly the Women’s Premier League ( WPL ). He also looked forward to cricket being part of the 2028 Olympics, expressing hope for India to secure a medal.The RCB icon, who remains the highest run-scorer in IPL history with 8,004 runs in 252 matches, is set to join the RCB camp shortly as the team prepares for the new season under new captain Rajat Patidar.","Virat Kohli admits he ""might not have another Australia tour in him"" Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) star says he is not mulling retirement at the moment.

Come and score so many runs so that everyone is shaken,"" Chopra said.Pant, who has been an explosive and fearless batter for India in Tests and ODIs, has struggled to cement his spot in T20Is, where Sanju Samson has established himself as the first-choice wicketkeeper-batter. Chopra believes that Pant must carefully choose his batting position to maximise his impact.""Where he would bat would be a question. There are a lot of discussions that he would open as keepers are batting there. You don't have to compete with Sanju. You have to make your own place properly. I would say there is no need to bat above No. 3 or No. 4. If you get a great start, come at No. 3, or else keep all three left-handers at four, five and six, and hit everyone,"" Chopra advised.Chopra further noted that the current Indian T20I team might undergo significant changes before next year’s T20 World Cup , hinting at the dynamic nature of the squad. ""There are two things. Firstly, take the team forward. Then you get recognised more as a captain. Secondly, if you score runs, you return to India reckoning. I am still not convinced that the T20 team playing currently will play next year as well. The T20 selections are going to be very dynamic,"" Chopra remarked.As captain of LSG, Pant also carries the responsibility of leading a new franchise, which adds to his challenge of making a statement with both the bat and his leadership. Chopra concluded, ""So this IPL will play a huge role in terms of who is moving forward and able to make his place again. So I see a huge opportunity for Rishabh Pant as a captain with a new franchise and as a batter.""With the T20 World Cup on the horizon and intense competition for spots, all eyes will be on Rishabh Pant to see if he can rise to the occasion and make a strong case for his return to India’s T20I squad.",Former India cricketer Aakash Chopra believes that the 2025 Indian Premier League (IPL) could be a turning point for Rishabh Pant as he eyes a comeback to India's T20I squad. Pant has a golden opportunity to prove his mettle while playing for the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) Chopra emphasised that Pant’s performances in the upcoming season could make or break his chances.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119073446,imgsize-84152,width-400,resizemode-4/119073446.jpg"

Champions Return: Rohit, Hardik, Shreyas, Gambhir return after India's title triumph

NEW DELHI: Jasprit Bumrah and Sanjana Ganesan celebrated their fourth wedding anniversary on Friday, March 15, 2025, with a heartfelt exchange of love. Marking the special day, Sanjana shared a touching message featuring song lyrics that encapsulated her deep bond with the Indian pace spearhead .Sanjana marked her fourth wedding anniversary with Jasprit Bumrah by sharing heartfelt lyrics from the song ""Tu Hai Toh"" on Instagram.""Tu hai toh dil dhadakta hai/Tu na toh ghar ghar nahi lagta/Tu hai to darr nahi lagta/Happy 4,"" wrote Bumrah's wife.The couple, who tied the knot in an intimate ceremony in Goa in 2021, welcomed their son, Angad, on September 4, 2023.While the celebration was all about love and togetherness, Bumrah’s absence from the field has been a topic of discussion.The Mumbai Indians pacer has been recovering from a lower back injury sustained during the fifth Test against Australia in January. The injury sidelined him from bowling in the second innings of the Sydney Test, which India lost by six wickets.As a result, Bumrah also missed India’s victorious Champions Trophy campaign, where the Men in Blue lifted the title without their premier fast bowler.His absence was a major blow, but the team management opted to give him ample time to recover, with an eye on the upcoming Test series against England in June.""His recuperation is going well. But at this stage, it’s better to give him more time to return to peak fitness,"" a source told PTI.The BCCI medical team has not provided a definitive timeline for his return, but he has been gradually increasing his workload in the nets. Chief selector Ajit Agarkar had earlier advised five weeks of ""off-loading"" to manage stress on his back, considering his history of similar injuries.With IPL 2025 around the corner, Mumbai Indians will be hoping for Bumrah’s return, especially after their disappointing tenth-place finish last season. However, his availability for the initial games remains uncertain.","Jasprit Bumrah and Sanjana Ganesan celebrate their fourth wedding anniversary.

A routine check-up turned into a fight for his life



Dwyane Wade Reveals Cancer Diagnosis Led to Kidney Surgery | E! News

The toughest challenge yet—Physically and Emotionally



Dwyane Wade- A legacy that extends beyond Basketball

Basketball icon Dwyane Wade has never shied away from tough battles, but his latest opponent was one he never saw coming. The three-time NBA champion, known for his explosive plays and leadership on the court, recently revealed a personal health scare that left fans stunned. At just 41 years old, Wade was diagnosed with cancer, leading to a life-altering surgery that removed nearly half of his kidney.Since retiring from the NBA in 2019, Dwyane Wade has built a thriving post-basketball career, becoming a co-owner of the Utah Jazz and the WNBA’s Chicago Sky while also making strides in television and podcasting. But despite his busy schedule, the former Miami Heat superstar knew something was off when he started experiencing unusual symptoms like abdominal discomfort and weak urine flow.Initially, Wade didn’t think much of it. However, given his father’s recent health struggles, he decided to get a full-body scan, a choice that would ultimately save his life. During a candid episode of his podcast, The Why with Dwyane Wade, he shared the moment doctors discovered a tumor in his right kidney, an outcome he never expected.“I didn’t go in for my kidneys, but because I did the full-body scan, they saw something,” Wade explained. The shocking revelation led to a crucial decision in December 2023, when surgery became the only option to determine whether the tumor was malignant. (via: Daily Express U.S.)For an athlete who built a career on resilience, Wade’s battle with cancer was a test of an entirely different kind. The surgery took a significant toll, not just physically, but emotionally.“I think it was the first time my family, my dad, my kids, they saw me weak,” Wade shared. “That moment was probably the weakest I’ve ever felt in my life. One thing you never want to do as a man? You never want your family to see you weak. ”As a father of five and husband to actress Gabrielle Union , Wade’s health scare was a stark reminder of how unpredictable life can be. It also underscored the importance of regular health screenings, a message he hopes to pass on to others.Also Read: JJ Redick takes the blame after Dalton Knecht’s scary fall complicates Lakers' vs. Nuggets Wade’s impact on the game is undeniable—three NBA titles, a Finals MVP, and 13 All-Star appearances but his story extends far beyond basketball. His willingness to speak openly about his health battle adds another layer to his legacy, inspiring fans to prioritize their well-being, break the stigma around personal struggles, and embrace resilience in the face of adversity.As he continues his post-NBA journey, Wade remains a symbol of strength, perseverance, and advocacy. Whether mentoring young athletes, championing important causes, or sharing his personal challenges, he proves that even legends face battles. Sometimes, the most important victories happen not in the spotlight, but in life’s quietest, most defining moments.","Three-time NBA champion Dwyane Wade recently revealed a personal health scare that left fans stunned.

NEW DELHI: With eight days to the start of IPL 2025 , the lineup for captains in the tournament was completed when Delhi Capitals announced star all-rounder and the men’s team’s longest-serving player Axar Patel as captain.Axar, 31, who had initially joined the Capitals in 2019, has played 82 matches across six seasons for the franchise where he took 62 wickets and scored 967 runs.Axar is a veteran of 150 IPL matches in which he scored 1653 runs and picked 123 wickets, including a hat-trick in 2016 when he took four wickets in five balls for Punjab.Pant, who had been DC's long-term captain, moved to Lucknow Super Giants after the Delhi franchise opted against retaining him. LSG acquired his services for Rs 27 crore during the auction and have gone on to appoint him as captain.Before Axar, Kolkata Knight Riders had named veteran Ajinkya Rahane as captain in what came as a surprise move considering the defending champions had splashed big on Venkatesh Iyer.One of the biggest appointments going into the IPL 2025 season is that of Rajat Patidar to try and lead Royal Challengers Bengaluru to their first IPL title. Patidar was one of the two contenders for the leadership role with ex-skipper Virat Kohli the other option. The franchise, however, went for the long-term vision by appointing the 31-year-old.Patidar, known for his solid batting, now shoulders the responsibility of leading RCB in their pursuit of IPL title. His appointment continues the rich legacy of leadership at the franchise, following in the footsteps of legends such as Rahul Dravid, Kevin Pietersen, Anil Kumble, Daniel Vettori, Virat Kohli, and Faf du Plessis.(TBA - To be announced)",IPL 2025 captains announced.

On the WPL and growth of the women’s game:

BENGALURU: Virat Kohli on Saturday made it clear that retirement is not on the immediate agenda but the star batter admitted he may not be around when India tour Australia next in four years’ time. In a tongue-in-cheek response to the possibility of coming out of retirement for the 2028 Olympics, the 36-year-old former India skipper, speaking at the RCB Innovation Lab’s Leadership Summit here on Saturday, quipped, “I just might sneak in for one game, if we are playing the gold-medal match!”Excerpts...I’m not playing for achievement. It pretty much comes down to just the pure joy, enjoyment and love for the game. And as long as that is intact, I’ll continue to play the game. I have to be honest about that with myself, because the competitive streak doesn’t allow you to find the answer. I had a very interesting conversation about this with Rahul Dravid when he was coach. He said you always have to stay in touch with yourself, figure out where you are placed in your life. And the answer is not that easy, because you might be going through a lean phase, and you (may) feel like this is it, but it might not be. When it is time, he said my competitive streak would not allow me to accept it. Maybe one more. You just have to pray and hope for clarity when it comes.The only thing that we as a team have tried to do is create an environment of fun and involvement. When you go to a practice session, you’re looking forward to being at the training ground with your friends. It doesn’t feel like a drag, it doesn’t feel like I have to get off the bus and go for another session. It’s like, when are we going to get together with the boys again? Because we have so much talent today. And I think it came out beautifully. The guys adapted well to what was in front of them. We ended up winning because we adapted to the conditions much better than the others.I’m happy about the inclusion. The amount of cricket has increased, so have the number of teams. Leagues are being played all over the world. The IPL has played a massive role in that as well. It’s a great opportunity for our guys. To be Olympic champions would be a magnificent feeling.I can’t pinpoint one lowest point. If you ask me the intensity of how disappointed I’ve been, for me the most recent Australia tour would be the one that’s most fresh, or for a long period of time the tour of England in 2014 was the thing that bothered me the most. But I can’t look at it that way. I might not have an Australia tour again in me in four years’ time. I don’t have the chance to correct it. So, you have to make peace with whatever’s happened in your life. How do I cope? It’s just about the acceptance.There was a time when I realized that I need to change the way I'm preparing as an athlete. Motivation was something that came from within. No one had to force me to do it. India had a couple of very difficult overseas tours. And I figured out that the reason that we were falling short is because the other team was physically way fitter than us. And they were able to hold their plans and skills in pressure situations for way longer periods than we could. And that’s what Test cricket is all about, who’s able to stay in the battle for longer periods of time.After I became captain, we started to bring in this kind of culture into the team as well. It eventually became a fabric that went into the culture of the Indian cricket.The perception (about women’s cricket) has changed massively. I think what the Indian women's cricket team has done over the last few years is that they are the ones who were the catalyst to kind of put the attention onto themselves. I literally saw it happening in a time span of 6-7 years. The way they started playing, you could see that belief and then people started engaging a lot more. And eventually it got to a place where commercials became better. Money was being infused into the women's game. And then you have the WPL. We have all seen the number of people that come and watch the games. And the standard of the games as well, be it power-hitting or skill levels and everything. This is what happens when you take a sport or even a part of a sport to that level of competition and equality.","Virat Kohli says he may not be around when India tour Australia next in four years’ time.

'Not going anywhere': Rohit Sharma on retirement from ODIs after winning the Champions Trophy

Pakistan cricket has experienced significant turmoil in recent years with frequent changes in leadership, management, coaches, and selectors showing no improvement. These constant changes have negatively impacted many careers, including that of Babar Azam , one of Pakistan's most talented cricketers.Babar's performance has declined significantly, and he has been removed from captaincy positions twice. His recent performance in the Champions Trophy drew criticism from various former cricket players.Former Pakistani spinner Saeed Ajmal has defended Babar Azam against criticism from former cricketers.""Aapke paas ek hi toh star hai. If you degrade him also, then how will your cricket run? These are the big issues. Our former cricketers should keep their mouths shut,"" told Sportstar.""As a cricketer, one must realise that bad patches are part of a player's career. You can't play cricket the same way all your life. Even if you were Sachin Tendulkar, you couldn't score 100 runs in every match.""Following Pakistan's poor performance in the Champions Trophy, the board made immediate changes. Mohammad Rizwan was removed as T20I captain, and both he and Babar Azam were dropped from the team.""Look, the way you've removed them is wrong. It's not like they are the only ones who haven't scored while others have. That's not the case. Ideally, the selectors should sit down with Babar and discuss rest so that he can come back stronger.""""Babar and Rizwan are great players. Their stats are as good as anyone's, but the only difference is that they don't bat aggressively, but they still score runs. Our guys have suddenly realised that in international cricket, everyone plays aggressively.""""Come on, what aggression are we talking about? If they are your proven match-winners, you don't need aggression. Even legends like Virat often pace their innings slowly before attacking, that's his style.""","Former Pakistani spinner Saeed Ajmal has defended Babar Azam against criticism from former cricketers.

Mirra Andreeva , 17, defeated world number one Aryna Sabalenka with a score of 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 at Indian Wells on Sunday to win her second WTA 1000 title.Andreeva, who became the youngest player to win a 1000-level tournament in Dubai last month, overcame her previous difficulties against the Belarussian. This victory will elevate her to a career-best world ranking of sixth on Monday.After recovering from first set challenges, Andreeva managed to break Sabalenka's serve three times in the final set. She now holds the most wins among women on the WTA tour in 2025 with a 19-3 record.""I would like to thank myself for fighting to the end,"" Andreeva said. ""I was running like a rabbit today because Aryna she was sending bullets and it was really hard to keep up.""The match saw multiple momentum shifts before Andreeva took control in the final moments. She secured a match point on Sabalenka's serve with a defensive lob and won with a forehand winner.""The match point I just really tried to just put the return in, it doesn't matter how,"" she told Tennis Channel.

What was the result of the Cain Velasquez vs Brock Lesnar final ?

Кейн Веласкез vs Брок Леснар | Полный бой

23rd October, 2010, a day when two American bigwigs,, locked horns in the Final of the UFC Heavyweight championship , which not only led to an enthralling encounter but also left behind rare memories of immense appreciation and mutual respect between the two wrestlers.It is not very often that one comes across the winner showering heaps of praises upon the loser, following such intense bouts. However, on this particular day, Velasquez did not shy away from giving Lesnar his dues and crediting his own team for the backend preparation that ended in Velasquez successfully getting the better of Lesnar.In an interview with retired MMA artist Tim Kennedy, Velasquez recalled how he was wonderstruck by the sheer appearance of Lesnar. He admitted to having been in awe of the wrestler's size and referred to Lesnar as ""a big human"".""His size, his power, and knowing how good of a wrestler he is. Again, OK, dangerous, can be dangerous, especially with a certain style, for sure. But his massive size is like, ""Wow, it's a big human,"" Velasquez was quoted as having said.Velasquez further acknowledged his team's efforts in preparing him for the big match. Notably, his team comprised future UFC Hall of Famer, Daniel Cormier as well.""I probably weighed in at, like 240-something going in. My strong suits with him, I was very good at getting off on the bottom. We did this in college wrestling a lot. I was just very good at getting up from the bottom, so I knew if I were to get struck there, then it could be a long night for me, but we worked on that over and over again with DC (Daniel Cormier),"" said Velasquez, revealing insights into his training regimen.“We started in the worst positions, whatever [coach] Bob [Cook] said, in the middle of sparring, I had to lay down on my back with 16-ounce gloves and had DC lay on top of me and that’s where we started from multiple times a round. So I was very good at getting up from the bottom, especially for that camp, and I knew I just had to keep it on the feet with strikes. Just the pressure of everything, but it didn’t matter for me. My mentality was I didn’t care if I lost or won, I’m just going to give you what I have. That’s it. That’s all I could do,"" he added.Cain Velasquez vs Brock Lesnar was a battle between Velasquez's intense strike power and Lesnar's superb grappling skills. Riding on the back of two heavyweight titles, the second of which had come just months ago in July, Lesnar was being deemed as the obvious favourite. However, Velasquez had other plans.As the fight began, Velasquez was actively in the game at all times, responding to the intimidating Lesnar with rapid movement and explosive punching prowess. He soon started overpowering Lesnar with his incessant punches, and to everyone's surprise, took him down to submission. Thus, with persistent grit and determination, Velasquez was able to dethrone Lesnar from the zenith and help himself get crowned as the reigning heavyweight champion.Also Read: Top 5 best and highly popular MMA moves that win fights Interestingly, years later, Lesnar was able to avenge this loss in 2019 when he defeated Velasquez in only 88 seconds, when the latter made his WWE debut on the first episode of Friday Night SmackDown on Fox.","Cain Velasquez was left amazed by Brock Lesnar's size.

Deshaun Watson and Jilly Anais take the next step with a heartfelt engagement



Deshaun Watson ’s future with the Cleveland Browns remains uncertain, but one part of his life just became more secure — his relationship with longtime girlfriend Jilly Anais . The couple recently announced their engagement, signaling a joyful new chapter despite the challenges Watson faces on the field.Watson and Anais shared the news on Sunday, March 16, through a heartfelt joint Instagram post. The post featured a series of romantic photos of the couple, with Anais proudly displaying a large diamond ring as Watson embraced her. The caption read, ""Mrs. Watson loading..."" while Watson commented ""MORE GLORY"" with a prayer emoji, capturing the couple's excitement.The couple’s relationship began in 2019 when Watson, then playing for the Houston Texans, connected with Anais through Instagram. Since then, they have stood by each other through significant ups and downs. Anais, a successful singer, actress, and cookbook author with nearly 2.5 million social media followers, has been a constant source of support for Watson. Her latest single, ""I Must Really Love You,"" released in 2024, reflects her artistic success. Anais also manages a YouTube channel, a perfume line, and has authored two cookbooks, showcasing her diverse talents.Their relationship faced intense public scrutiny when Watson was accused by more than two dozen women of sexual assault and harassment during massage therapy sessions in Houston between 2021 and 2022. Although two grand juries declined to indict him, Watson settled all but one civil lawsuit. The controversy led to a significant setback in his career. After being traded from the Texans to the Browns, Watson was suspended for the first 11 games of the 2022 season and fined $5 million for violating the NFL’s personal conduct policy.Watson’s struggles continued on the field. He played only six games in 2023 before a shoulder injury sidelined him, and just seven games in 2024 before rupturing his right Achilles tendon for the second time in three months. The injury, sustained in an October 20 loss to the Bengals, could force him to miss the entire 2025 season.In response to Watson's injuries and inconsistent availability, the Browns have been making strategic moves. His $230 million fully guaranteed contract has been restructured twice in recent months to create financial flexibility. Cleveland could receive cap relief from the NFL if Watson remains out for the 2025 season, thanks to contract insurance protections.Meanwhile, the Browns are preparing for the future. After a disappointing 3-14 season in 2024, Cleveland holds the second overall pick in April’s NFL Draft. The team recently hosted top quarterback prospects Shedeur Sanders from Colorado and Cam Ward from Miami. Additionally, the Browns have acquired Kenny Pickett from the Philadelphia Eagles and hosted free agent Russell Wilson for a visit, indicating that the team is exploring options at the quarterback position.Despite the uncertainty surrounding his NFL career, Watson’s engagement marks a personal milestone. In January, Watson celebrated Anais’ birthday with a heartfelt Instagram post, writing, ""Happy Birthday To You Queen! 4ever love you ma! Grateful to celebrate with you! Continue to smile and inspire! 💯."" Anais responded, ""Thank you to the love of my life! I love you with all of my being! 💛🤞🏽.""Also Read: Travis Kelce's ex-girlfriend Kayla Nicole stuns fans with bold announcement about finding the love of her life While Watson’s professional future remains unclear, his personal life appears to be on solid ground. As the Browns navigate their options for the upcoming season, Watson and Anais are set to embark on a new journey together — one that promises love and stability beyond the football field.","Deshaun Watson and Jilly Anais announced their engagement on Sunday, March 16.

‘Wanted my 100th Test to be my last’

India's former ace spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has seen it all – multiple Indian Premier League IPL ) teams, the growing corporatisation of the league, and the evolution of franchises. Yet, as he returned to the Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ) camp after nearly a decade, one thing stood out: the unchanged atmosphere of the team itself.“It feels like it’s 2011 again,” said Ashwin, who was felicitated by Krishnamachari Srikkanth on Sunday at the book launch of ‘Leo – The Untold Story of CSK’, written by PS Raman.Ashwin made his IPL debut in 2009 with CSK and was part of the team’s title-winning campaigns in 2010 and 2011. After stints with franchises like Punjab Kings, Rising Pune Supergiants (now defunct), Delhi Capitals, and Rajasthan Royals, the 38-year-old Tamil Nadu cricketer is back home at CSK for his 16th IPL season.“It was nice to go around and get a flavour of what it is like everywhere. You learn a lot, but one thing that really stands out is that CSK has remained a team that’s evolved, yet at the same time, remained an archive,” Ashwin said.“Today, in the world of cricket corporatisation, there’s nobody who runs a business to make a loss – I understand that. But things have evolved, and teams have changed so much. Coming here (to CSK) again, I realise it hasn’t changed one bit since I left in 2015. The fact is, it is organically cricket. The best way to run a cricket team and achieve success is to keep it cricket-oriented,” he added.For Ashwin, his comeback to CSK is not about returning as a seasoned star, but as someone who wants to “enjoy” playing cricket again.“Destinations are not reached just like that; you need to go through milestones. My comeback to CSK is not as the person who’s achieved all those things, but as someone who’s gone through the entire circle and wants to come back and enjoy the same moment, I experienced all those years ago. It’s a wonderful place to be,” Ashwin said.At the book launch event, CSK legend MS Dhoni was also present, and Ashwin couldn’t help but reflect on the special bond that he shares with the former captain.Recalling a moment from his 100th Test, Ashwin spoke of inviting Dhoni to hand over the memento during the match in Dharamshala (in March last year against England), a moment he had hoped would mark his final appearance in Test cricket.“I invited MS for my 100th Test to hand over the memento. I wanted to make that my last Test. Unfortunately, he couldn’t come, but I didn’t think you’d hand over the gift of getting me back to CSK. It’s a much better one, so thank you MS,” Ashwin said.","Ravichandran Ashwin made his IPL debut in 2009 with CSK and was part of the team’s title-winning campaigns in 2010 and 2011.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Will Rohit Sharma win 2027 World Cup? Astrologer Lobo predicts after getting Champions Trophy bang on!

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently shared his thoughts on the intense cricket rivalry between India and Pakistan, emphasising India’s remarkable record against their arch-rivals in international competitions. Modi’s comments came during his appearance on the Lex Fridman podcast , where he touched upon various aspects of sports and their unifying power.Reflecting on the India-Pakistan cricket rivalry, Modi emphasised the power of sports to connect people.""I think sports have the power to energise the entire world. The spirit of sports brings people across nations together. That's why I would never want sports to get discredited. I truly believe sports play a major role in human evolution. They're not just games; they connect people on a deeper level,"" said the Prime Minister.When asked about determining the best team or players, Modi maintained a humble stance, acknowledging his lack of technical expertise but pointing out that results often speak for themselves.""Now coming to the question of who's better or not. When it comes to the techniques of the game, I'm not an expert. Only those who specialise in it can be the judge of it. They can only decide which team is the best and which players are the best. But sometimes, the results speak for themselves. Just a few days ago, India and Pakistan played a match and the result revealed who was the better team. That's how we know,"" he remarked.During the podcast, Modi was also asked about the greatest football players of all time. He acknowledged the rise of football culture in India and paid tribute to two Argentine legends.""It is absolutely true that many regions in India have a strong football culture. Our women's football team is performing really well, and our men's team is progressing really well. If we talk about the past, in the 1980s, one name that always stood out was Diego Maradona . For that generation, he was seen as a true hero and if you ask today's generation, they'll immediately say Lionel Messi ,"" he added.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke on the Lex Fridman podcast.

CHENNAI: Delhi Capitals left-arm medium-pacer T Natarajan will have a tough job on his hands in the upcoming IPL season, because of different contributing factors.Firstly, Natarajan will head into the 18th edition with little gametime under his belt; he last featured in the Tamil Nadu Premier League in July-August, being away from the grind of competitive cricket for many months due to a shoulder injury .Secondly, the 33-year-old is no longer in the familiar confines of Sunrisers Hyderabad, where he was quite successful during his seven-season stint. Next is the price-tag pressure that he will have to handle, after being snapped up for Rs 10.75 crore at the mega auction.While Natarajan is set for a challenging IPL campaign, he is optimistic about navigating difficult times by relying on his experience.“I have been part of the IPL for the last eight years, so I am able to manage situations better. What I have been doing, I want to do better. That is what I have been thinking about,” Natarajan, currently in the Capitals pre-season camp, told TOI.“Irrespective of what happens, I will never lose my confidence. Even when things do not go my way, I believe that I will be able to make a comeback. The support-staff members at DC have been motivating me, they have been taking good care of me. I have a support system that I can bank on. When the coaches say some nice words during my tough times, it helps me recover faster,” added Natarajan, who had 19 scalps in 14 appearances in IPL 2024.Returning to action after a lengthy spell on the sidelines, the Tamil Nadu bowler admitted that it may take time to get back to Natarajan of old, but he is positive about finding his groove again.“There will be some doubts considering that I will be playing after a long time. It will be running in the back of my mind. It will depend on how confident I am (on whether he has got his rhythm back). We will get a clear picture after I play a few practice matches. Things will get better after I attend more training sessions and play practice games.”In a bid to become the force that he was, Natarajan has been leaning on head coach Hemang Badani.“I have known him for quite a few years now, but this is the first time I am playing under him. He knows how to extract the best from his players. He stresses mainly on one thing – do whatever you are doing with confidence. He emphasises on the need to work and correct our mistakes,” said Natarajan, a death-overs specialist.‘Hoping to learn some new tricks from Mitchell Starc’Natarajan is eagerly awaiting the arrival of left-arm pace colleague Mitchell Starc, whose brains he wishes to pick.“Every bowler will have something new up his sleeve, so I am looking forward to learning from Starc. I have a lot of expectations, and I hope that I can pick up something different from him. I have not spoken to him yet, I am waiting to meet him,” said Natarajan.",T Natarajan is looking forward to playing in the 18th edition of the IPL.

What the f*ck can I say, bro?

NEW DELHI: Karun Nair is back in top-flight cricket with Delhi Capitals this IPL season. It’s been five years since he last played an IPL game. Incidentally, when his career hit its peak with a Test triple century in 2016, he was a part of the Delhi franchise.“Only thing that has changed since then is that I am a lot older now, besides it’s no more Delhi Daredevils now,” Nair said with a modest smile.At 33, Nair has become a hot topic in Indian cricket with nine centuries this domestic season. He has managed to resurface after being dropped by his home state Karnataka a few years ago -- there’s something cold about the smile on his face now.Nair’s career started unravelling three Tests after he became the only the second Indian to score a triple century. From being one of the hottest properties in Indian cricket, he was consigned to the cold storage in six months. He was out of sight and almost out of mind till the 2024-25 domestic season happened with Vidarbha. And now, he may well be pushing his case to make a comeback in India’s rather fragile Test middle order if he is picked for the India ‘A’ tour ahead of the England Test series.“I have been playing cricket for a while, I have seen ups and downs and it’s all about how you come back from the downs and treat the ups. I have learnt how to react to those situations,” Nair said on Sunday. “Obviously it has been tough times. It is something that helped bring myself to this stage, push me for more motivation and have hunger all the time.”When most players fall by the wayside, he managed to find the motivation to go through the entire process all over again — performing in domestic cricket, earning an IPL spot and pushing for an India ‘A’ selection before getting back in national reckoning. But he doesn’t want to believe that he has reattained his peak yet.“I think I am closer but don’t know how close. That’s not my focus but it’s at the back of the mind,” he said.Nair saw dizzy heights and hit rock bottom in no time. Does that make him careful about the highs now?“No. You should be able to enjoy the highs. That’s what you work for,” was Nair’s curt reply. But it’s been a long time since he played such high intensity cricket. He is aware that it will take some more work to get used to this environment.“I will find my process and rhythm as soon as I can. I’ll like to start well early and try to get better as the tournament goes on. The only thing that I have done is play according to the situation, added a few shots and built the confidence to execute them when needed. I also now try to stay relaxed,” he claimed.He may have gone through the journey all over again, but this is not unfamiliar territory. That he will have his long-time mate KL Rahul by his side at Capitals will ease the process for him.“It is exciting to be back with KL. We have played together since our childhood. He has done well in the IPL and had a great Champions Trophy. I am happy to be back with him,” Nair said.",Karun Nair is back in top-flight cricket with Delhi Capitals this IPL season.

Will Rohit Sharma win 2027 World Cup? Astrologer Lobo predicts after getting Champions Trophy bang on!

New Zealand spinner Ajaz Patel has thrown his weight behind Indian cricket legends Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli , stating that both icons have the right to decide their own ODI futures amid growing speculation over their potential retirements following India's recent Champions Trophy triumph.Patel, who is currently in India as part of New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon's delegation, acknowledged the immense contributions of the two batting greats and stressed that their decision should be respected.""They're the greats of the game. To be honest, I think they can decide when they want to stop playing. They're well within their rights to go for as long as they want,"" Patel told IANS. ""They've both got phenomenal records and they're both phenomenal players, and I know as a bowler it's always worrying to be able to bowl to either of them.""Virat Kohli was in sublime form throughout India's title-winning campaign in Dubai, scoring 218 runs from five matches at an average of 54.50. Kohli's consistent performances played a pivotal role in India claiming their third Champions Trophy title.Meanwhile, Rohit Sharma further cemented his legacy as a captain by becoming the second most successful Indian skipper in terms of ICC titles. Under Rohit's leadership, India clinched their second ICC silverware in less than nine months after winning the 2024 T20 World Cup.Patel acknowledged India's dominance in the final, saying, ""India just played good cricket on the day, I guess. New Zealand performed really well throughout the tournament and we played some phenomenal cricket. I think the conditions obviously made it tougher as well, but at the end of the day, India played very good cricket and unfortunately we lost on the day.""With the 2025 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) set to kick off on March 22, Patel also spoke about the tournament's significance for New Zealand cricketers.""IPL is a massive tournament around the world and it's a highly lauded tournament, so it's always exciting to watch. You get to see some of the best cricket, some of the best players, and obviously the way that it's run and structured is quite impressive,"" he said. ""It's been fantastic for New Zealand players to be able to come over here, challenge themselves, and get exposure on the world stage as well.""",Ajaz Patel says Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma can decide when to retire.

"WPL: Nat Sciver-Brunt has been Mumbai Indians’s MVP, rivals’ envy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/wpl/wpl-nat-sciver-brunt-has-been-mumbai-indianss-mvp-rivals-envy/articleshow/119030527.cms,"Nat Sciver-Brunt (PTI Photo)

MUMBAI: ""Form goes up and down,” says Nat Sciver-Brunt , so she wants to make the most of it as the “feeling when you are not so confident isn’t that nice.”It’s a captain’s delight to have someone like the England allrounder on the roster. The 32-year-old has unlocked her beast mode for Mumbai Indians this season, topping the Orange Cap list with 493 runs in nine games at an average of 70.42, with the help of five fifties. She already became the first player to score 400-plus runs in WPL history and is just seven runs short of crossing the 500-run mark in a season. She also has nine scalps in her kitty, putting her in the driver’s seat to take the Player of the Tournament award.She also played a stellar role in MI’s title run in the inaugural edition in 2023, scoring 332 runs and taking 10 wickets.A trait of top players is that they always find a way to improve their game consistently, and Sciver-Brunt is among those. During this campaign, she has impressed with her ability to score at a brisk rate through the middle overs. Her career strike rate in T20Is is 118.12, while in WPL it is 143.24, but in this edition, her strike rate stands at 156.50.Other MI batters have benefited from it, as well as her calm approach while batting, which has given the likes of Hayley Matthews and Harmanpreet Kaur the time to build their innings.Sciver-Brunt stressed that she didn’t try anything different in the lead-up to the tournament. “I haven’t done anything different in terms of my preparation or how I go about my innings. I have stuck to my strengths quite a lot and have played what is in front of me,” she said.Besides scoring briskly, what has made her more dangerous is her ability to score all around the park. Fuller lengths have been dispatched down the ground or through the covers, while anything slightly wide or short has been sent to the boundary with ferocity.Sciver-Brunt and Matthews have developed a nice understanding between them, which has seen them stitch match winning partnerships for MI. Like the 71-ball 133-run association against Gujarat Giants in the eliminator on Thursday, which was also their second 100-plus stand of the season. They also put on a 133-run association against UP Warriorz (UPW), besides two 50-plus stands—92 and 57 against UPW and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), respectively. She has also taken on the lead role while mentoring the West Indian, who at times has found it difficult to construct her innings.“Apart from this tournament, I haven’t really batted with Hayley, but we seemed to click well from the first year. (Against Giants) she wanted to go off after a quicker start, but it was good she stayed out there and didn’t give her wicket away. I was just reassuring her that you only need to time the ball, you don’t need to whack it,” reasoned Sciver-Brunt.","Nat Sciver-Brunt has scored 493 runs in nine games for Mumbai Indians.
