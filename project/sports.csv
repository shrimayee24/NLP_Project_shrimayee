NEW DELHI: Vaibhav Suryavanshi etched his name in IPL history by becoming the youngest crorepati in the league's history. The promising young talent was sold to Rajasthan Royals for a staggering Rs 1.1 crore sum from his base price of Rs 30 Lakh at the IPL 2025 auction on Monday (November 25).RR made the first move for Vaibhav, followed closely by Delhi Capitals.As the bidding intensified, the price quickly surpassed the Rs 1 crore mark. DC hesitated at Rs 1.10 crore but ultimately decided to back out, allowing Royals to secure the young talent for Rs 1.10 crore.Vaibhav rose to prominence when he played in the Vinoo Mankad Trophy for Bihar at the age of 12, accumulating around 400 runs in just five matches.He recently shot to limelight by becoming the youngest batter to score an international century. He achieved this milestone in a Youth Test for India Under-19 against Australia U-19 in Chennai, smashing 104 off 62 balls.His 58-ball century was the fastest by an Indian in Youth Tests and the second-fastest globally.Vaibhav, who was picked for the India B U-19 team for the Under-19 quadrangular series in Mulapadu, Andhra Pradesh, in November 2023, continued to make strides in his young career.The series, which also featured India A, Bangladesh, and England U-19 teams, served as a trial for the ICC U-19 World Cup 2024.

Out of the national team setup for over two years, Bhuvneshwar Kumar’s experience found high demand among IPL franchises, with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) securing his services for Rs 10.75 crore on Monday.The second day of the mega auction turned out to be lucrative for several Indian pacers, while some big names, including Shardul Thakur, Prithvi Shaw, Ajinkya Rahane, Kane Williamson, and Glenn Phillips, went unsold.Set to turn 35 before the start of the next IPL season, Bhuvneshwar boasts an impressive record of 300 wickets in 287 T20 matches with an economy rate under eight.Other notable deals included Deepak Chahar, who fetched Rs 9.25 crore from Mumbai Indians despite his injury history, and Mukesh Kumar, retained by Delhi Capitals for Rs 8 crore through the RTM card. Lucknow Super Giants also invested heavily, signing Test pacer Akash Deep for Rs 8 crore.Among the all-rounders, Krunal Pandya earned Rs 5.75 crore from RCB, who were in need of an experienced spin-bowling all-rounder. Rajasthan Royals made significant bids for Tushar Deshpande (Rs 6.50 crore) and Nitish Rana (Rs 4.20 crore), while Delhi Capitals secured former RCB skipper Faf du Plessis at a bargain base price of Rs 2 crore. Gujarat Titans acquired Washington Sundar for Rs 3.20 crore in another smart move.The scarcity of quality Indian seam-bowling all-rounders worked in favor of South Africa’s Marco Jansen, who secured a Rs 7 crore deal with Punjab Kings.Meanwhile, the auction reflected the high demand for Indian talent despite the limited options, ensuring lucrative deals for even fringe players.On Sunday, the first day of the auction, most of the high-profile names raked in the moolah as the franchises virtually emptied their pockets to bag the priority players in their respective shortlist.Led by Rs 27 crore Lucknow Super Giants spent to buy star wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant, the sum of money splurged by the franchises came to a whopping INR 467.95 crore.Pant edged past Shreyas Iyer, who fetched Rs 26.75 crore from Punjab Kings, as teams went all out for marquee Indian stars. Venkatesh Iyer took home a whopping Rs 23.75 crore from KKR.A total of 84 players from the roster of 577 were presented on the opening day at the Abadi Al Johar Arena. Out of these 68 got sold, while four were retained through the Right-to-Match card.Among other big buys, leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal attracted Rs 18 crore from Punjab Kings, who also used the Right-to-Match card to bring back paceman Arshdeep Singh for Rs 18 crore. KL Rahul was picked up by Delhi Capitals for Rs 14 crore.Meanwhile, the BCCI has taken a significant step by announcing the schedules for the IPL for the next three seasons. This is a departure from the usual practice of releasing schedules closer to the tournament.The 2025 IPL will commence on March 14 and conclude on May 25.","Rishabh Pant, Shreyas Iyer, Venkatesh Iyer and Arshdeep Singh sold on Day 2 of the IPL 2025 auction. Rovman Powell sold for 1.50 crore, Washington Sundar for 2.20 crore and Marco Jansen for 7.25 crore.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115666289,imgsize-87934,width-400,resizemode-4/115666289.jpg"
Border-Gavaskar Trophy: 'Perth-etic Humiliation': How Australian media reacted to India's sensational victory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/perth-etic-humiliation-how-australian-media-reacted-to-indias-sensational-victory/articleshow/115677527.cms,"The one-sided match has left the cricketing fraternity in Australia reeling. (Photo by Paul Kane/Getty Images)

NEW DELHI: 'Perth-etic Humiliation' and 'Monster Loss' were the titles used by the Australian media on Monday to describe up their team's 295-run thumping to India in the first Test match.The one-sided match has left the cricketing fraternity in Australia reeling and former players demanded that Marnus Labuschagne be dropped after the match.The Sydney Morning Herald called the disaster ""a sight of one-way traffic,"" casting doubt on the team's preparedness and mentality.""Australia, a team that prided itself on composure and clear thinking, has looked lost throughout, essentially from the moment Jasprit Bumrah destroyed their top order on the first evening of the game,"" the report read.""It was hard to discern whether Labuschagne, Steve Smith and Usman Khawaja , to name the three senior batters, were undercooked, overcooked or both,"" it added.The headline 'Perth-etic Humiliation' by Herald Sun summed up the thrashing, while nine.com.au headlined, 'Aussies dealt reality check in monstrous loss).The SMH gave youthful opener Yashasvi Jaiswal and India's star player Jasprit Bumrah a perfect score of ten.""Gave nightmares to Australia's batters with his awkward bowling action and brilliant control of the seam to move the ball both ways. Grew visibly with the responsibility of captaincy,"" it wrote.On Yashasvi, the report said: ""Looked a class above anything the Australian bowlers could serve up.""Additionally, it stated that Virat Kohli had the ""platform for a big series"" after ending his century drought, while Mohammed Siraj had ""regained the hostile edge.""""They had awoken Kohli from his batting slumber, an ominous sign of things to come,"" wrote foxsports.com.au.SMH rated Labuschange a perfect score of 1/10, noting that ""Bumrah is living inside Labuschagne's head right now.""Steve Smith, an Australian batting mainstay who was dismissed for his second golden duck of the season, received a grade of 2.5. According to SMH, the former captain must negate Bumrah if they want to have a chance.""One of the game's best problem-solvers (Smith) will have to nullify Bumrah if Australia is to stand a chance in this series,"" it added.After scoring 2 and 3 in the match, Labuschagne took the brunt of the criticism.Before playing in the second Test match in Adelaide next week, the Australian No. 3 needs to go and find some form in grade cricket, according to former England captain Michael Vaughan, who made this statement on Fox Cricket.Experts have also advocated for the inclusion of new players in the starting lineup.Josh Inglis of Western Australia, who has amassed 297 runs at an average of 99 this season in the Sheffield Shield, and Sam Konstas, a rising sensation, are being mentioned as possible additions.The top four, which included Steve Smith, Nathan McSweeney, Marnus Labuschagne, and Usman Khawaja, also received advice from David Warner ""They need to get together, have a conversation, work out between themselves what can we do differently? How do we approach it? Do we be braver?,"" he said on Fox Cricket.""Wipe it out of your memory,"" was Mark Waugh's advice to the floundering Aussies.""It's a disaster, a one-off disaster at this stage,"" wicket-keeping great Ian Healy said on SEN.""A scrambled mind"" and ""lost technique"" were the indicators, according to SEN commentator Gerard Whateley.","The one-sided match has left the cricketing fraternity in Australia reeling.

Anthony Edwards Net Worth, salary, Endorsement



Beyond the Court



Anthony Edwards, affectionately called ""Ant-Man"" by his fans, has become a household name in the NBA since being drafted first overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2020. With a remarkable journey from his football roots to basketball stardom, Edwards has solidified himself as a versatile and dynamic player in the league.Growing up in Atlanta, Edwards initially showcased his athletic prowess on the football field, playing for the Atlanta Vikings.Recognized as one of the top running backs in the nation at just 10 years old, he exhibited remarkable versatility by excelling in multiple positions. However, his passion for basketball ignited after observing his brother play, leading to a pivotal switch in his athletic journey. By the ninth grade, he was under the mentorship of Justin Holland, an Atlanta-based basketball trainer who played a crucial role in shaping his skills.At Holy Spirit Prep in Atlanta, Edwards quickly rose to prominence, averaging an impressive 29 points and nine rebounds per game during his senior year. His college debut with the Georgia Bulldogs was equally electrifying, with a 24-point performance that marked the highest scoring output for a Georgia freshman debut. He later set a season-high record of 37 points, becoming the first Georgia freshman to achieve this milestone. His dominance on the court earned him collegiate honors and established him as a leading scorer nationwide among freshmen.Anthony Edwards's financial trajectory reflects his on-court success. In 2024, per Marca, his net worth stands at $40 million, bolstered by his rookie contract worth $44 million and a subsequent five-year extension with the Timberwolves valued at $204.45 million. Notably, his salary for the 2023/24 season jumped 26% to $13.5 million, emphasizing his rising stature in the NBA.His endorsement deal with Adidas, signed in 2020, positioned him among elite NBA players associated with the brand, such as James Harden and Damian Lillard.

Dallas Cowboys lists Cooper Rush on the injury report ahead of the mid-week matchup against the New York Giants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/dallas-cowboys-lists-cooper-rush-on-the-injury-report-ahead-of-the-mid-week-matchup-against-the-new-york-giants/articleshow/115678652.cms,"Image via Imagn Images

Cooper Rush is listed as a limited participant on Monday

In Week 12, the Dallas Cowboys outlasted the Washington Commanders, 34-26, with plenty of aid from Rico Dowdle in both rushing and receiving, just as he was in Week 5 versus the Steelers in trying to be more consistent in its running game. Tyler Smith and Trevon Diggs return to work at The Star after missing Sunday. Zack Martin and Jake Ferguson didn't make it.And Cooper Rush is listed as ""limited'' with a knee issue.The Dallas Cowboys will have a short week of rest heading into Week 13 ahead of their annual Thanksgiving game against the New York Giants. An estimated injury report was released Tuesday, detailing a group of players with knee injuries, including quarterback Cooper Rush. His status for Thursday's game is in question due to his recent takeover of the starting role, after Dak Prescott was out. Coach Mike McCarthy said of Rush, playing in place of Dak Prescott, who is injured and out for the year, “He’s got some work to do but I think we’re going to be fine.”Monday's practice was a walk-through, so Rush's playing status was a best guess at his normal practice skills. His status for Tuesday's practice will be watched. Should Rush not be able to play because of a knee, it will likely be Trey Lance taking snaps under center for Dallas. Lance played in two games this season and didn't try a pass in Week 12's victory over the Washington Commanders. Rush threw two touchdown passes and zero interceptions, completing 75% of his passes.Rush was 24-for-32 for 247 yards and two scores, effectively managing the game and targeting key playmakers, including tight end Luke Schoonmaker on a 22-yard touchdown catch. The Cowboys' offense finished with 332 total yards, including 241 through the air, overcoming inefficiencies on third down (2-for-11) to secure the win.Also Read: Giants owner John Mara Giants owner John Mara responded with a two-word non-answer after a disappointing loss to the Buccaneers Cooper Rush needs three straight wins to replace injured Dak Prescott for discussion of postseason to get at all realistic. The Cowboys (4-7) are likely to be favored in two of their remaining games, and already lead by four points as an annual Thanksgiving Day host to the New York Giants (2-9). The Cowboys could make something of their improbable 34-26 win at Washington, ending a five-game losing streak.","Dallas Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush is listed as a ""limited participant"" in Monday's practice.

The smile on Jasprit Bumrah 's face as he addressed the media in Perth was almost as big, if not bigger, than India's victory margin of 295 runs.Fittingly named Player of the Match, Bumrah had said on match-eve that even as a child he enjoyed doing difficult things and loved being a problem-solver.In Perth, India had many problems. They were fielding two debutants, allrounder Nitish Reddy and pacer Harshit Rana, a seemingly out of-form batting legend in Kohli, a struggling opener in KL Rahul, a first timer in Australia in Yashasvi Jaiswal . They were also battling the wounds of a 3-0 humbling to the Kiwis at home.But Bumrah rose to the challenge. ""We're a new side so I wanted to put myself in tough scenarios when we needed to do something, to make the job a bit easier for the new guys,"" he said. And do something he did.His opening evening spell of 6-3-9-3 broke open the game after India were bowled out for 150 and also showed the younger bowlers the way to bowl on bouncy wickets. An impressive 93 of Bumrah 's 181 Test wickets are either bowled or leg-before.In Australia, he has 40 wickets at an obscene average of 18.80 and 22 of his 40 sticks are bowled or leg-before. At the Optus he got three leg-befores. Contrast it to the Aussie bowlers. Their pitch map suggested that only 6.4% of the deliveries in the 134.3 overs they bowled were hitting the stumps. His message to the inexperienced attack was, ""target the stumps"".""In Perth there could be a scenario when you come from India where the bounce is not as prominent, and you bowl short because you get excited by the bounce and don't find the length. It looks good when you bowl a back-of-length delivery and the batter is beaten, but he is still there. We knew that if we make them play more there's enough in the wicket to give us assistance,"" Bumrah said.One of Bumrah's great skills is the ability to read conditions and situations and that is something he tried to convey to the bowlers on the first evening. ""Sometimes when you're bowled out for a lower score you can be too desperate and go pole-hunting. When you try too much over here it doesn't help and run-scoring goes high.""Hailing debutants Reddy and Rana, Bumrah said, ""The biggest positive was that they were not nervous. It didn't feel like they were playing for the first time in Australia.""Bumrah also praised opener Jaiswal. ""If I had to choose a man of the match, it would be Jaiswal. This was his best Test knock. He has an attacking nature but in that second innings, he left certain balls, he took his time and batted deep. He showed that he has patience and that he's ready to adapt and change,"" said Bumrah.",Jasprit Bumrah named Player of the Match for India's 295-run win over Australia.

Harbaugh brothers reunite on the Gridiron



The NFL spotlight turned to a sibling rivalry Monday night as John and Jim Harbaugh met at midfield before the Baltimore Ravens clashed with the Los Angeles Chargers . It marked the third professional meeting between the brothers as head coaches, with their last face-off etched in history during Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, where the Ravens triumphed over the San Francisco 49ers with a score of 34-31.The first regular-season encounter between the Harbaughs happened on Thanksgiving night in 2011, a game where the Ravens secured a 16-6 victory over Jim’s then-49ers.Since leaving San Francisco after the 2014 season, Jim Harbaugh has spent nearly a decade leading the University of Michigan, where he achieved remarkable success, including a national championship last year. His transition back to the NFL came as he was named head coach of the Chargers.Before Monday’s game, the brothers shared a moment, chatting briefly and posing for photos. Despite the familial warmth, the competition remained intense. Jim emphasized his unwavering approach to the game, stating, “I love my brother. I’d lay down my life for my brother, but I would not let him win a football game. And he would not want it that way, so it just feels cool, we’re ready to have at it.”John, echoing the sentiment, acknowledged the unique challenge of coaching against his sibling. Speaking ahead of the game, he remarked, “There’s all the things we love about each other. Then there’s all the things we know about each other that we have to overcome in a game like this. He’s a great coach, he’s a great man, a great leader. And he’s got a great football team, so that makes it complicated.”This emotionally charged matchup carried an added layer of significance as their parents, Jack and Jackie Harbaugh, celebrated their 63rd wedding anniversary on the same day.

But generational pace-bowling talent Jasprit Bumrah led a young Indian side that had all those attributes as they humbled Australia by 295 runs on Day Four of the first Test at Perth's Optus Stadium on Monday.Leading by example, the captain took a match-haul of 8/72 that included dreamy first spells in both innings as India cleaned up the hosts for 238 in 58.4 overs to take a 1-0 lead in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .Australia, who were chasing a potentially insurmountable target of 534, had started the day at a precarious 12/3.Even their eventual score of 238 did not seem possible when Usman Khawaja skied a catch to Rishabh Pant after miscuing a pull off the reincarnated Mohammed Siraj off just the second ball of his first over to leave Australia at 17/4. But Travis Head 89 (101 balls, 8x4) and Mitchell Marsh 47 (67 balls, 3x4, 2x6) produced counter-attacking knocks to delay the inevitable.Siraj produced a wonderful leg-cutter to send back Steve Smith for 18 and who else but Bumrah orchestrated a wonderful one-two punch like a boxer to set up Head and break the stand of 82 for the sixth wicket between him and Marsh.Bumrah brought himself on for a short spell after lunch from the Members End to allow his more junior bowling colleagues the benefit of using the uneven bounce while operating from the Justin Langer End.After bowling a set of four balls pitched on off-stump that Head either defended or glided to third man, a rapid bouncer sailed over the batter's head for four wides. The next delivery, from round the stumps, came in, pitched on a length and moved away. Head's poke nestled into Pant's gloves, invoking a rare in-your-face celebration from Bumrah, followed by a vocal ""come on"" from Virat Kohli at slip.Marsh was cleaned up by the impressive debutant Nitish Kumar Reddy. That chop-on took place almost immediately after the broadcasters showed a split screen comparing Reddy's bowling action to the great Dennis Lillee's, which would have tempted Reddy to use it as a permanent wallpaper on his phone. Dhruv Jurel, who had endured a quiet game, then produced a moment of magic at short-leg in the final over before tea when Mitchell Starc's flick off Washington Sundar was magically pouched when the ball was almost behind India's reserve wicketkeeper.Nathan Lyon was castled by a drifter by Sundar two balls later, a delivery which Lyon would have been proud to bowl himself. Rana then cleaned up Alex Carey with a wonderfully disguised slower one which the Aussie keeper-bat missed to cap a monumental win. It was India's second biggest victory Down Under. Their innings and two-run triumph in Sydney in 1977-78 achieved under Bishan Singh Bedi takes pride of place at the top.Conversely, it was Australia's second heaviest defeat at home. The earlier humbling also came in Perth in 2012-2013 when South Africa walloped them by 309 runs at the WACA to sour Ricky Ponting's farewell. Only once have Australia bounced back to win a series after losing the first Test - against West Indies in 1968-69.The victory, probably among India's top five in overseas Tests, also puts them back on top of the World Test Championship standings with 61.11 percentage points. That it comes with key personnel like regular skipper Rohit, No. 3 batter Shubman Gill and seamer Mohammed Shami absent, will make it seem sweeter.Coach Gautam Gambhir and the think tank would also be happy to see that some of their bold selection calls paid off.Australia had never lost a Test at the Optus in four previous visits. India on Monday spoilt that record. Australia were on a run of 16 consecutive Test victories twice in 2001 and 2008. It was India again who ended both those streaks in Kolkata and Perth respectively. Australia's unbeaten record at the Gabba in 2021 after not losing a Test there since 1988 was also ended by India.Having had so many of their perfect records broken by India, they would be wary of protecting their 7-0 record in Adelaide pink-ball Tests. That is where hostilities resume come the second Test on December 6.","India beat Australia by 295 runs on Day Four of the first Test in Perth.

A street-smart T20 bowler who can make the ball talk with his classical swing, Deepak Chahar will be donning the Mumbai Indians (MI) jersey in the next Indian Premier League (IPL) season, after the franchise bought him for Rs 9.25 crore at the IPL mega auction in Jeddah on Monday. Deepak will, thus, no longer be part of MS Dhoni 's Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and said that he will miss the icon's company.MI outbid Punjab Kings, who withdrew just before the bid crossed the Rs 8 crore mark, and CSK to get the swing bowler in their ranks on the second day of the auction.Deepak's base price was Rs 2 crore.In an interaction during the auction's live broadcast with Suresh Raina , his former teammate at CSK, Deepak said that his skills will be useful on the pacer-friendly Mumbai pitches, as compared to Chennai where spinners get more assistance.""Everytime I talk to (cousin) Rahul (Chahar), I say you are playing for the team (MI) I should be playing and I am playing for the team (CSK) you should be playing, skill-wise. Because in Chennai, there is help for the spinners and in Mumbai for fast bowlers. He couldn't come to Chennai, but I am going to Mumbai. So I will get that advantage,"" said Deepak.Rahul, meanwhile, has moved to Sunrisers Hyderabad, who bought the leg-spinner for Rs 3.20 crore.Further during their live interaction, Raina asked Deepak on a lighter note: ""Dhoni bhai ko miss toh karoge (will you miss Dhoni)?""Deepak's reply was obvious. ""Unko kaun nahi miss karega (who won't miss him),"" the right-arm pacer said.Deepak made his IPL debut in 2016 for the now-defunct Rising Pune Supergiants and was bought by CSK before the 2018 edition of the IPL and stayed with them until this auction.His best performance in an IPL season came in 2019 when he picked up 22 wickets in 17 games.He has been part of CSK's three title-winning campaigns -- 2018, 2021 and 2023.","MI outbid Punjab Kings, who withdrew just before the bid crossed the Rs 8 crore mark, and CSK to get the swing bowler in their ranks on the second day of the auction.

India's massive 295-run victory in Perth after being bowled out for just 150 in their first innings is being celebrated as one of the best Test victories on the Australian soil, as stand-in captain Jasprit Bumrah started a turnaround before Yashasvi Jaiswal and Virat Kohli took over.

NEW DELHI: When Sanjiv Suryavanshi sold his farm land to fund his 10-year-old son Vaibhav's cricketing aspirations, little did he know that within three years the boy would be scripting history. During the second and final day of the IPL mega auction in Jeddah, Vaibhav, at 13 years and eight months, became the youngest cricketer ever to be picked by a franchise as Rajasthan Royals bought him for Rs 1.10 crore.Sanjiv, who owned farm land in his native Motipur village which is 15kms from Samastipur town in Bihar, was lost for words.""Woh ab sirf humra bituwa nahi pura Bihar ka bituwa hai (He is not just my son now but entire Bihar's son),"" Sanjiv told PTI over phone as his son is currently in Dubai for the U-19 Asia Cup.""My son has worked hard. At the age of 8 years, he excelled at U-16 district trials. I would take him for his cricket coaching to Samastipur and then take him back,"" he recalled the days of hardships.So were his finances in place as cricket is an investment?""Not just investment, it's big investment. Aapko kya bataye humne toh apna zameen tak bech diya. Abhi bhi halat pura sudhra nahi (I have sold my land. Financial issues are still there).""When asked about the controversies regarding Vaibhav's actual age which many believe is 15 years, the father was quick to clarify.""When he was 8 and half years old he first appeared for BCCI bone test. He has already played India U-19. We don't fear anyone. He can again undergo age test,"" he sounded defiant.Sanjiv said that Bihar Cricket Association president Rakesh Tiwary's ""blessings"" have always helped Vaibhav in his journey.""Rakesh ji ka ashirwaad raha hai bahoot (Rakesh ji's blessings are there).""His base price in the auction was Rs. 30 lakh and Delhi Capitals made the opening bid. RR entered the fray at Rs. 35 lakh and eventually got the better of DC to get the player on board.So how did this bidding war happened?""Rajasthan Royals had called him for trials in Nagpur. Vikram Rathour sir (batting coach) gave a match situation where he had to score 17 in an over. Bituwa ne 3 chakka mara. Trials mein aat chakka aur char chauwaa mara (He smashed three sixes. At trials, he hit eight sixes and four fours),"" the father claimed proudly.For a 13-year-old, it can be very difficult to understand what it means to earn a crore. So how does he plan to keep his young son away from monetary discussions?""He just wants to play cricket and nothing else. A few years back he loved Doremon, not anymore,"" Sanjiv said.BCA president Tiwary was all praise for the prodigy after his 1.10 crore bid for RR."" Vaibhav Suryavanshi 's incredible achievement at such a young age fills us with immense pride,"" Tiwary said in a statement.""His journey from Bihar to the IPL is a reflection of his talent, hard work, and determination. The Bihar Cricket Association has always believed in nurturing young talent, and Vaibhav's success highlights the cricketing potential in our state.""We are confident he will continue to shine and inspire aspiring cricketers across Bihar and beyond.

NEW DELHI: Prithvi Shaw faced a major setback at the IPL 2025 mega auction as the opening batter went unsold, with no franchises showing interest in acquiring him.Shaw's struggles with form and fitness have significantly impacted his value, leading to his exclusion from the bidding process.This development marks a significant blow to Shaw's efforts to reignite his career, especially after being released by Delhi Capitals ahead of the auction.With this disappointment, questions loom over Shaw's future in both the IPL and international cricket.Following disappointing performances in the first two rounds of the 2024 Ranji Trophy , he was dropped from Mumbai's squad for the third round.Reports indicate that the decision was influenced not just by his poor form but also by disciplinary concerns, including missed training sessions, adding to his struggles.Shaw's journey has been a rollercoaster of highs and lows. In 2018, he was named by the ICC as one of the top five breakout stars in men's cricket, showcasing immense potential.However, his career hit a stumbling block in 2019 when he received a doping ban from the BCCI, ruling him out of action until November that year.Also See: IPL Auction 2025",Prithvi Shaw went unsold at the IPL 2025 mega auction.

NEW DELHI: Team India skipper Jasprit Bumrah inspired a spirited group of Indian cricketers to their most commanding Test victory on Australian soil, securing a resounding 295-run win in a remarkable turnaround that will forever shine among India's golden moments in international cricket .The stand-in captain, who also got the Man of the Match award, set the tone with an outstanding performance, claiming a match haul of 8/72.India bowled out the hosts chasing a daunting target of 534 for just 238 in 58.4 overs on the fourth afternoon of the opening Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .However, following the win against Australia, Bumrah heaped praise on Kohli, who notched up a well-deserved century in the second innings of the first Test. Virat Kohli doesn't need us, we need him. He knows what he needs to here, the best. He has batted in touch scenarios all his life..he is in great space. He got a good delivery in the first innings. We needed an experienced batter in the second innings and he delivered,"" said Bumrah in the post-match press conference.""Really happy and proud of the win. To go 1-0 up. Lots of positives to take away,"" he added after his first win as Team India's Test captain.""When you get out on a low score, sometimes bowlers get desperate. The message was clear to stick to the plans. Very happy to get first Test win as captain. Even when I am not captain, I look to contribute as much as possible,"" he added. ""Yesterday was almost as good as you want. Batters played long, bowlers got rest. Yesterday was perfect. We wanted to bowl in the evening.

It wasn't a bowling paradise but very happy with how the wicket was,"" he further told the reporters.""KL Rahul was one of the big positives from the first Test win. ""Very happy for KL Rahul. Batted well in the first innings even in the second innings. An ideal Test innings. Jaiswal, it was his best Test knock. He took his time and batted deep. He has patience. That's a positive side that a batter is able to adapt early in his career,"" Bumrah said.""Biggest positive for me was no one was down after we got out for 150.
