India, Afghanistan, South Africa and England — the four survivors of the 'Super 8s' have finally been spotted. This has been a rare, collector’s edition of a T20 World Cup where the ball, for once, has mostly dominated the bat. We have also witnessed a clutch of humdingers, and it’s likely more nerve-racking encounters are in store in the two semifinals on Thursday.June 27, 8 pm ISTVenue: Providence, GuyanaChances of Rain: 88% (no reserve day)India have won 12, or 52%, of 23 T20 games.In T20 WC, both teams have won two matches each out of four, though the last meeting in 2022 saw England hammering India by 10 wicketsFormbook: Red hot, undefeated.

Pandya’s return to runs (average 58, team’s highest) and wickets (8) has added depth and value to the unit. Will enjoy crowd supportConcerns: Kohli’s run shortage. Lack of form of all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja. Dube’s inability to up the tempo (strike rate 107). Arshdeep taking wickets (15) but shows lack of control under pressure.

Leg-spinner Adil Rashid is the trump cardConcerns: Australia showed England’s bowling can be clobbered; South Africa proved their batters can be checkmated.

The decision to play a high-risk shot, especially when Pant possesses a wide array of conventional shots, was the crux of the frustration.""The man who has so many good shots in the front of the wicket in his repertoire should try and avoid such a shot. Telling a player like Pant to show some patience would not be ideal, but maybe Kohli might try to tell him,"" he added.According to Manjrekar, while advising patience to a naturally aggressive player like Pant might not be the most practical approach, there could be an expectation for him to exercise better judgment in shot selection, particularly in crucial phases of the game.Despite Pant's dismissal and Kohli's subsequent frustration, India moved closer to a T20 World Cup semifinal berth with a commanding 50-run win over Bangladesh in a Super Eight match.

Indian bowler ne cheating ki | inzamam ul haq latest on India vs Australia T20 world cup match

NEW DELHI: Responding sharply to former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq 's accusations of ball tampering by Team India during the Super 8 match against Australia, skipper Rohit Sharma emphasised that if it won’t reverse swing here, then where it will, as the Men in Blue are not playing in conditions like those in Australia or England.Rohit's remarks followed Inzamam's assertion that it's unlikely for the ball to reverse swing as early as in the 15th over of the game, hinting at suspicions that ""serious work had been done"" on the ball."" Arshdeep Singh , when he was bowling the 15th over, the ball was reversing. Is it too early (for reverse swing) with the new ball? This means the ball was ready for reverse swing by the 12th or the 13th over. Umpires should keep their eyes open (to spot) these things...If it was Pakistani bowlers (reverse swinging the ball) this would have been a big issue. We know reverse swing very well and if Arshdeep can come in the 15th over and start reversing the ball, it means some serious work had been done before,"" Inzamam had said on Pakistani news channel.Addressing the media, ahead of India's semifinal clash against England, to be played on Thursday, Rohit said: ""What can I say. Don’t you see the rough surfaces and the heat here? This isn’t Australia or England. Here the conditions will result in the ball reverse swinging in 12-15 overs. It’s happening for all teams and not us alone. Sometime people need to open their mind and think"".Not only Inzamam, but former player Saleem Malik also suggested that officials often overlook issues when it comes to India.""Inzy, I always say this, eyes are kept shut when it comes to some teams, and India is one of those teams.

NEW DELHI: The wounds from the T20 World Cup semi-final loss in Adelaide to England are still fresh for Team India. Following their impressive victory over Australia in the last group stage encounter, India have already avenged their 2023 ODI World Cup defeat at home and now seek redemption against the Three Lions. They face England in the T20 World Cup semi-finals at the rain-threatened Providence Stadium in Guyana on Thursday.The marquee clash between India and defending champions England is under serious threat from continuous rain over the past 12 hours in Guyana.Currently, the temperature hovers around 25 degrees Celsius with complete cloud cover and high humidity at 91 percent.According to accuweather.com, Thursday morning in Guyana carries an 88% chance of rain and an 18% chance of thunderstorms.

WWE Money in the Bank 2024: Six man tag team match between team Cody and The Bloodline confirmed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/wwe-money-in-the-bank-2024-six-man-tag-team-match-between-team-cody-and-the-bloodline-confirmed/articleshow/111264228.cms,"In recent weeks, The Bloodline has been wreaking havoc, and with Jacob Fatu's debut, things have taken an even darker turn. Last week on SmackDown, Jacob Fatu made a powerful statement by crashing through the announce table onto WWE Undisputed Champion Cody Rhodes, signaling his intent to dismantle Rhodes, Randy Orton, and Kevin Owens . Now, Rhodes, Orton, and Owens will have the opportunity to settle their score with The Bloodline in a Six-Man Tag Team match, officially set for Money in the Bank 2024.Here’s everything you need to know about the Six man tag team match between team Cody and The BloodlineFans are currently confused because the six-man tag team match seems unfair. The Bloodline has four members, while Cody Rhodes, Randy Orton, and Kevin Owens are just three. There's a high chance that The Bloodline might overpower Team Cody, as the non-competing Bloodline member will likely interfere in the match. This kind of interference is a tradition for The Bloodline.Additionally, the match might change to a Street Fight Six-Man Tag Team Match, given The Bloodline's history of ignoring rules and using chairs, kendo sticks, backstage areas, and the announce table to punish their opponents. However, Orton, Owens, and Rhodes are aware of The Bloodline's tactics and have their own strategies to counter them.Following the chaotic debut of Jacob Fatu, who took down Orton and Owens with a Samoan Drop on the steel steps and splashed through the announce table onto Rhodes from the top turnbuckle, it seems increasingly likely that the match at Money in the Bank 2024 will be a no-DQ or Street Fight style tag team match.Initially, Orton and Owens were the only victims of The Bloodline's assaults. However, at Clash at the Castle, Cody, while celebrating his victory over AJ Styles, was ambushed by The Bloodline. Orton and Owens quickly arrived to rescue Cody from the attack.In a recent episode of SmackDown, The Bloodline targeted CM Punk and were on the verge of striking him down. Cody rushed to the scene with two baseball bats, keeping one for himself and handing the other to Punk.Later that night, a main event match between Cody Rhodes and Solo Sikoa was announced. Cody dominated Sikoa in the beginning, but Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa attacked Cody, leading to Sikoa's disqualification. Orton and Owens promptly intervened, subduing Tama and Loa and preparing to strike Sikoa. Suddenly, Sikoa gave a devilish smile, and moments later, Jacob Fatu entered the ring, causing absolute chaos.Following Wrestlemania 40, this will be Cody's first non-title match at an event. Previously, he competed for his Undisputed title at Backlash, King and Queen of the Ring, and Clash at the Castle, where he successfully defended his title against AJ Styles and Logan Paul . Now, he will face the Bloodline in a tag team match. It will be intriguing to see Rhodes compete in a tag team match against those closely associated with Roman Reigns .","Cody Rhodes, Randy Orton, and Kevin Owens will face The Bloodline in a Six-Man Tag Team match at Money in the Bank 2024.

The way that they've approached it in the last couple of years is certainly taking the game on extremely hard in the power play,"" said Mott, as quoted by PTI.The coach anticipates a high-scoring encounter, stressing the challenge posed by India's new-found aggression and suggesting they might aim to post a daunting total, potentially pushing it beyond England's reach.""Rohit (Sharma) with the bat has led the way extremely well and shown leadership in that department, as has Jos Buttler for us. But I think it presents a really unique challenge for us. It's a venue we don't know well. We've obviously been armed with a lot of information and we think we've got a squad to cover it, but there's a little bit of unknown about what we're going to get,"" he said.Despite being the defending champions, England enter the match with a point to prove following their disappointing performance in the recent ODI World Cup. Mott, however, exudes confidence in his team's ability to peak at the right time.""When we go back to that semi-final, obviously on a good pitch in Adelaide, we put India in and that was a risk. But I thought we felt that they weren't sure what a good score was. I think the approach now is they would come at us hard and try and maximise that, maybe try and put it out of our reach. You've got two great batting line-ups. The bowlers are all class as well. So, it's going to come down to on the day,"" Mott remarked.Mott admitted India's consistent presence in the knockout stages of ICC tournaments, attributing it to the team's quality and experience.""What India has done incredibly well over the last few years is put themselves in semi-finals contention and the flip side to that is when you don't win people look at that as a negative. But I think the consistency that they've shown over a length of time shows what a great group of players they are. And like anyone, when you get to the semi-final stage, every team, and the four teams out here, all think they're in with a chance to win it. And there's small margins. So, if you take those key moments at the right time, you get over the line, if you don't, you go home. So, our tournament really starts tomorrow, we're excited by - we know their players well, they know us well,"" added England's head coach.The coach, however, downplayed England's inconsistent run in the tournament, underlining their focus on the present and the belief that their best cricket is yet to come.""There's a general feeling that our best cricket is in front of us. I think we've been pretty good in patches, we've done some really good stuff over here, but we haven't put together that perfect game. So, with a bit of luck that happens against India. It's certainly going to be a great occasion,"" concluded Mott.",England coach Matthew Mott hails India's new-found aggression. England face India in the T20 World Cup semi-final on Thursday.

'I was so furious that ...': Yuvraj Singh recalls his iconic 6 sixes in 2007 T20 World Cup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/i-was-so-furious-that-yuvraj-singh-recalls-his-iconic-6-sixes-in-2007-t20-world-cup/articleshow/111294040.cms,"Inside the mind of Yuvraj Singh: The legend behind famous six sixes | T20WC 2007

NEW DELHI: Former India all-rounder Yuvraj Singh 's iconic six sixes still remain fresh in everyone's memory after 17 long years, and the man himself hasn't forgotten an inch of that epic moment when he smacked England pacer Stuart Broad half a dozen times out of the park.While recalling that historic feat in a video interview with ICC , Yuvraj said, ""In the last couple of innings I didn't do well so I was very keen to get out there and get some big hits and some kind of form. It was the 19th over and I had to swing everything.Freddie ( Andrew Flintoff ) bowled two really good balls actually and on the last ball of the 18th over I took a single. (Few words were exchanged between the two of them). And I was just like. I am sorry, what did you say? Obviously I was angry then the umpire came in. Anyways I was furious. I was so furious that I just wanted to hit every ball out of the ground. The first ball went out of the park. I remember hitting this one without even realising how big that hit is.""When the anchor asked Yuvraj that after hitting four sixes to Broad, do you have six sixes in mind at that point? To which he replied after taking a big breath,"" No, I have actually five sixes in my mind since I was hit for five sixes by Dimitri Mascrenahas in the final over of the 2007 Oval ODI. It was very demeaning as well. You don't want to get hit for five sixes. I had been in this place and getting hit for 5 sixes is not a good feeling.I was like Dimitri was standing at deep mid-wicket and Flintoff was at deep square leg. I know where he was standing. Here what happened was Broad actually switched to over the stumps at the last moment. When he did that, in my mind I was like I knew where he was going to bowl. I was ready that it was going to be a full yorker towards my legs, and I just wanted to get my bat on it.""On being nervous before the sixth and final six, Yuvraj said, ""I was not nervous at all. He (Broad) was the one who was nervous as I can see his body language. If you will see there was a smile on my face at that moment, and that smile was for Dimitri. I normally bat at No. 4 and MS Dhoni at No. 4 and after I hit the final six, MS said to me that everytime you come out to bat after me your strike rate is double.The great thing about Freddie is he talked about it after the game and shook hands, and that is why I have a lot of respect for Flintoff. (On Broad) I think that was a big moment of his career because he knew from here on he had to add more variety in his bowling. He just can't come and bowl yorkers. He has to bowl slower balls, bouncers. Obviously he was young and learning as well. And from there on he went on to take 600 Test wickets. I don't think without this moment, he would have ended up with 600 wickets. This moment probably made him work harder and realise how important it is to succeed. Definitely this is the moment that made him a legend.""""Ya, this was one of the iconic moments and I cherish it but if we wouldn't have won the World Cup, it wouldn’t have been that special I guess,"" concluded Yuvraj.Yuvraj's blistering innings came to an end when he was caught at long-on off the penultimate delivery of the final over, having amassed a stunning 58 runs from a mere 16 balls. His explosive performance proved decisive, as India went on to secure a 20-run victory.","Yuvraj Singh hit Stuart Broad for six sixes in the final over of the 2007 Oval ODI.

The wait has felt endless.Last year, India had a significant opportunity to claim an ICC trophy on home soil. However, Rohit Sharma 's team fell short in the ODI World Cup final against Australia, missing a crucial chance to add to their elusive collection of trophies.At 36, Rohit is determined to secure an ICC title for India, a feat that has eluded them since their ICC Champions Trophy victory in 2013, came under the leadership of legendary Mahendra Singh Dhoni.India's last T20 World Cup victory was in the inaugural edition in 2007, where Dhoni led the team to a five-run win over Pakistan in the final. This remains India's only title in the tournament's history. Since their 2007 triumph, India have reached the final only once in eight editions, finishing as runners-up in the 2014 tournament in Bangladesh after losing to Sri Lanka by six wickets.Team India has advanced to the semifinals of the T20 World Cup 2024 with an unbeaten streak, including a magnificent win over Australia. They are set to face England in the semis at the Providence Stadium in Guyana on Thursday.The last time these two teams met at this stage, it was a one-sided affair as England outplayed an outdated India in the semifinal of the 2022 edition.Can Rohit lead India to an ICC title this time?Former India pacer S Sreesanth, who was part of India's two ICC title wins — the 2007 T20 World Cup and the 2011 ODI World Cup — is confident that the 36-year-old will succeed this time.""Rohit Sharma has all the capabilities of a winning captain. He's got that experience, so I don't see any reason why he can't go all the way and win the World Cup. We spoke about Rashid Khan and how, with brotherhood, he has kept the team as a unit. Similarly, Rohit Sharma has also done it many times in franchise cricket. He knows every player individually,"" Sreesanth, who is a cricket expert and commentator, told TimesofIndia.com on Star Sports Press Room.""We wouldn't be surprised if Rohit Sharma lifts that trophy on 29th June,"" he said.Sreesanth also praised India's all-rounder Hardik Pandya , who has been in outstanding form with both bat and ball in the mega tournament.Despite not having a great season as a player and captain for the Mumbai Indians in the IPL 2024, Pandya has scored 116 runs in 6 matches, averaging 58.00, and has taken 8 wickets in the ongoing T20 World Cup.""Despite the speculations going on throughout the week, in the last press conference, he spoke about Hardik Pandya being a key player in the team. Just like Yuvraj Singh in the 2011 World Cup as an all-rounder with bat, ball, and fielding, I think Hardik Pandya is very much capable of doing that in this World Cup,"" Sreesanth said.","Team India has advanced to the semifinals of the T20 World Cup 2024 with an unbeaten streak, including a magnificent win over Australia.

Robinson conceded an astonishing 43 runs in a single over, setting a new record.Sussex had set a daunting target of 464 runs after declaring their second innings on 296-6. Leicestershire were struggling at 144-6 when Kimber entered the crease and started hitting boundaries, quickly reaching his half-century.During the 59th over, bowled by Robinson, Kimber unleashed a barrage of shots, smashing 'two sixes and six boundaries' while Robinson overstepped three times. In County Cricket, no balls result in a two-run penalty, leading to an expensive nine-ball over, reported Reuters.Kimber reached his century with a boundary, and even when Robinson tried to change his angle by coming around the wicket, the batter remained unstoppable.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq has sparked a fresh controversy, accusing the Indian team of ball tampering during their T20 World Cup 'Super 8s' game against Australia on Monday.Inzamam's claims came after India's convincing 24-run victory over Australia at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium in St. Lucia.T20 World Cup: Schedule The 1992 ODI World Cup winner's allegations centre on the unusual reverse swing extracted by left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh , who was brought back for his second spell in the 16th over.Reverse swing typically occurs with an older ball, and Inzamam questioned how the Indian bowlers managed to achieve it with a ball that remains relatively new for the duration of an innings in a T20 game.""When Arshdeep Singh was bowling the 15th over (16th), he was getting reverse swing. With a (relatively) new ball, is it too early to get reverse swing? Was the ball ready for reverse swing by the 12th or 13th over? Because when he came to bowl, the ball started reversing. Umpires ko aankhein khuli rakhni chahiye (the umpires should keep their eyes open),"" Inzamam said while talking on a Pakistani TV channel.India posted a formidable total of 205-5 in their 20 overs, thanks to captain Rohit Sharma 's blistering 92 off 41 balls, and Suryakumar Yadav 's rapid 31. Contributions from Shivam Dube (28) and Hardik Pandya (27 not out) further bolstered India's innings. Australia's bowlers, led by Mitchell Starc (2-45) and Marcus Stoinis (2-56), struggled to contain the Indian batsmen on a batting-friendly pitch.Chasing 206, Australia managed 181-7 in their 20 overs. Travis Head top-scored with 76. However, the Indian bowlers, particularly Arshdeep, who took 3-37, and Kuldeep Yadav , who claimed 2-24, kept the Australian batsmen in check. Jasprit Bumrah and Axar Patel also chipped in with crucial wickets, ensuring India maintained their grip on the match.With a strong all-round performance, India once again showcased their potential as tournament favourites and secured a place in the semi-finals, where they will take on defending champions England on Thursday at the Providence Stadium in Guyana.",Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq accuses India of ball tampering.

Former Australian cricketer specifically pointed out the ineffectiveness of Mitchell Starc , the pace bowler, who struggled to contain Rohit Sharma 's onslaught during the T20 World Cup Super Eights encounter in Saint Lucia.In a remarkable display of batting prowess, Rohit unleashed a blistering 41-ball 92, which included an over where he plundered 29 runs off Starc's bowling. This explosive innings propelled India to an imposing total of 205 runs.India's formidable score proved to be too much for Australia , as they fell short by 24 runs in their chase. With this victory, India secured their place in the semifinals, where they are set to face England in what promises to be an exciting clash.""I thought they weren't prepared. This is a worry with Mitchell Starc. If the ball is not swinging, he doesn't change his length quickly enough. And he didn't change his length quickly enough to Rohit Sharma as well when he got hit for 29 runs there,"" PTI quoted Hogg, a veteran of seven Tests, 123 ODIs and 15 T20Is for Australia, as saying on Star Sports Press Room.""There was one moment where Rohit Sharma came out of the wicket. And then you saw Starc turn around. And I don't know whether he said Rohit's hitting with the wind or there's no swing there. That was a moment where I thought Australia were in a lot of trouble,"" he said in his critical analysis of the former champions.Hogg pointed out that in addition to Rohit's explosive batting performance, the subpar fielding display by the Australian team also played a role in their loss against India.As a consequence of their defeat to India and Afghanistan 's victory over Bangladesh, Australia's journey in the World Cup came to an end, resulting in their elimination from the tournament.""(I knew) They're not going to come back because they were starting just to look at what's going wrong rather than looking for the solutions. So, that's probably where it went wrong.""And also, dropping Hardik Pandya, it was an easy catch there for Mitchell Marsh, the skipper, with a couple of overs to go. And I think Hardik scored 22 off the next 10 balls. You can't afford to drop Hardik Pandya when you've just bought your way back into the game. That was also crucial,"" Hogg said.Hogg, at 53 years old, expressed his belief that South Africa, often labeled as chokers, are finding their rhythm at the crucial stages of the T20 World Cup. He praised Aiden Markram 's team, calling them ""amazing,"" and suggested they have the potential to overcome their historical struggle of never securing an ICC trophy.Despite consistently being considered one of the top contenders in ICC tournaments, South Africa has repeatedly fallen short due to lackluster performances and misfortune. They have yet to claim a title in these prestigious events.In the 2021 T20 World Cup, the Proteas narrowly missed out on a spot in the semifinals, losing the opportunity to England based on a lower net run rate. The 2022 T20 World Cup saw them suffer an unexpected loss against the Netherlands, further extending their disappointing record.But Hogg feels the Proteas have just started to blossom.""They are just spawning from here. It's amazing. I regard (opener Reeza)Hendricks as well, I really like him as a player. And then you've got to build a wall, they can build a nice spin with especially (Heinrich) Klassen. I expect him to do really well against Afghanistan and get to the finals,"" said Hogg.Given their history of strong performances, Hogg is confident that South Africa has what it takes to overcome the challenge posed by Afghanistan and advance to the championship match.""I think it is going to be South Africa and we have got a really strong squad, good spin with (Tabraiz) Shamsi and (Keshav) Maharaj. I don't plan on the big nations now, and I think they'll have to go out there and play it out again instead and just have that confidence to go with the final side.""For me, if I get past that semifinal right, South Africa is going to win the final this year. I just think I've got the team balanced and I've got the aggression as well. I really like Markram as the captain. He is correct and very composed. And I also think, we are going to win as a very well-composed team, not panicking and just setting the right conditions,"" added Hogg.Hogg also slammed the Australian team's fielding performance in their match against Afghanistan during the Super 8s stage. He described their efforts on the field as ""terrible,"" expressing his disappointment with their subpar display.In a stunning turn of events, Afghanistan managed to secure a 21-run victory over Australia, defying expectations. The Afghan team then proceeded to defeat a resilient Bangladesh side, securing their spot in the semifinals. This remarkable achievement sent the people of Afghanistan, a nation afflicted by conflict, into a state of euphoria and celebration.""Australia took Afghanistan too lightly. They rocked up. They weren't at their best. They were terrible in the field. They were terrible with the ball. And at the end of the day, Afghanistan deserved to be there rather than Australia.""Talking about (captain) Mitchell Marsh, he is probably the bro of the team. He's like Andrew Symonds. He has a lot of fun. If there's a little bit of division in the camp, or there's a bit of argy-bargy, he generally lights the load. So, he's that bro. But the other thing is, Pat Cummins probably wasn't a certainty to play in the playing XI of this World Cup,"" he said.","Former Australian cricketer Brad Hogg criticised the Australian team's lack of preparation for their match against India.

Despite facing a Portugal side that fielded many of their reserve players, having already qualified for the next round, this triumph is considered Georgia's most significant achievement since gaining independence in 1991.Georgia's journey to Euro 2024 was not straightforward.

Mikautadze's successful penalty not only secured the win but also made him the tournament's leading scorer at that point.The match saw Ronaldo, visibly frustrated, receive a booking for dissent and later express his disappointment by kicking a water bottle following his substitution.

The conclusion of the match was marked by Alan Minda's goal in the 91st minute, following a swift counter-attack, sealing Ecuador's triumph.Jamaica managed to reduce the margin early in the second half, marking their first goal in Copa America history after participating in eight matches. This goal came after a corner kick, with Michail Antonio successfully converting a rebound into a goal, despite Ethan Pinnock 's initial attempt being blocked by Ecuador's defence.A potential penalty for Jamaica was reviewed in the 73rd minute for a handball by Alan Franco, but after consultation with the video assistant referee (VAR), the decision was made not to award the penalty.This victory was pivotal for Ecuador, providing them with their first points in Group B of the tournament, following a loss to Venezuela in their opening match.

The 26-year-old also scored five goals and created a number of chances.His good show helped the team enter the last-four stage of Kalinga Super Cup where they eventually went down to SC East Bengal. However, the team’s lacklustre showing continued in ISL where they finished second from the bottom in the league stage despite being in contention for a playoffs spot for much of the season.Khlaid will now be hoping for a much improved showing from the Japanese, who has more than impressed the coach after he took over the managerial duties midway into the season.Speaking of Tachikawa’s signing, Khalid said, “Tachikawa has proven himself to be a technical and high-tempo player who not only scores goals but also creates numerous opportunities for his teammates. Retaining Tachikawa is adding steel to the squad with his versatility and competitive spirit being an asset.

Messi may skip Argentina's Copa America game against Peru to rest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/messi-may-skip-argentinas-copa-america-game-against-peru-to-rest/articleshow/111288515.cms,"STAGE SET?

Lionel Messi , who recently celebrated his 37th birthday, might be absent from Argentina 's upcoming Copa America match against Peru due to a thigh injury. The team has already secured a spot in the next round after winning their first two games.During Argentina's narrow 1-0 win over Chile in the tournament hosted by the United States, Messi needed short-term medical attention for his thigh. However, he managed to play the entire game, nearly scoring with a long-range effort that hit the post and being instrumental in Argentina's offensive plays.With Argentina's qualification for the next stage already confirmed, the team may decide to rest Messi against Peru to allow his sore thigh to recover, considering the muscle discomfort he has been experiencing lately.""It bothers me a bit, but I was able to stay on until the end. I hope it's nothing serious ... I wasn't able to move properly because of the bother,"" Reuters quoted Messi , who acknowledged it might be wiser to sit out the Peru game on Saturday.""Let's see how the next few days go, how I recover. We've taken an important step to qualify and be relaxed. It's a lot of games, a lot of travelling,"" added Messi, saying he had also suffered from a sore throat and fever before the Chile game.Argentina, the reigning world champions and top contenders for the Copa America title, have secured a solid start to the tournament, despite not performing at their peak level. Their 2-0 triumph over Canada, coupled with their previous win, has placed them in a commanding position.With six points, Argentina sit atop Group A, while Canada trail behind with three points following their success against Peru.The Argentinian team is relieved to have commenced the Copa with straightforward victories, a stark contrast to their previous major tournament experience.In the World Cup held in Qatar, they suffered a shocking 2-1 loss to Saudi Arabia in their opening match, which went down as one of the greatest upsets in football history.Lautaro Martinez's late goal at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Tuesday helped Messi overcome one of his most difficult career moments at the same venue eight years prior.His missed penalty in the shootout contributed to Argentina's heartbreaking defeat to Chile in the 2016 Copa America final, leaving a devastated Messi pledging to retire from international football following another disappointment with his national team.Lionel Scaloni , the coach, declined to confirm whether he would give Messi a rest against Peru to ensure his fitness for the quarter-finals, but Argentine football pundits presumed he would.Despite achieving numerous accolades at the club level with Barcelona from a young age, it was only in the latter stages of his career that Messi finally succeeded in winning a major international tournament with Argentina, matching Diego Maradona 's godlike status in his football-obsessed homeland.He led Argentina to victory in the previous Copa America in 2021 and the Qatar World Cup in 2022.As fans ponder whether this is his last international tournament, Scaloni has encouraged them to savor watching Messi play rather than speculating about his future plans.The conditions seem to be in place for another potential Messi fairy-tale ending. Brazil, their rivals, are in poor form and could only manage a 0-0 draw with Costa Rica in their opening match, and the Copa final on July 14 will be held in Florida, where Messi plays for Inter Miami .","Lionel Messi may miss Argentina's Copa America match against Peru due to a thigh injury.

Chile failed to clear a dangerous in-swinging corner from Messi, allowing Lautaro Martinez to pounce on the loose ball and secure a dramatic late victory for Argentina.The result sees Argentina progress to the quarter-finals of the Copa America, maintaining their pursuit of a record-extending 15th title.

This incident, which led to a brief altercation between players, turned the match in Canada's favour, allowing them more freedom to attack.Canada capitalized on their numerical advantage in the 74th minute.
