Bryan Braman, the fearless ex-Eagles linebacker famed for his helmetless tackles, has died at 38 after battling a rare and aggressive brain cancer. A Super Bowl LII champion, Braman spent his final months surrounded by his two young daughters, Blakely and Marlowe, and his devoted mother, Tina. His fight off the field was as fierce as any on it—marked by surgeries, cutting-edge treatment, and unwavering family support. At his death, Braman left behind a legacy of grit, fatherhood, and an estimated $2 million net worth.Diagnosed in early 2025 with a fast-moving brain cancer, Braman underwent multiple surgeries and CAR-T cell therapy in Seattle. Despite state-of-the-art treatment and support from the NFL community — including a GoFundMe that raised over $88,000 — the disease advanced rapidly. NFL players like J.J. Watt contributed significant donations as Braman’s story rallied fans nationwide.Throughout his treatment, Braman was never alone. His daughters, Blakely (11) and Marlowe (8), stayed close, and his mother Tina handled his care and public updates. Though not publicly known to have a spouse, Braman was described by many as a “girl dad” whose life revolved around his children.Undrafted in 2011, Braman made his mark with the Texans and then the Eagles.His most iconic moment came during his rookie year: a viral helmetless tackle that embodied his all-out style. He earned a Super Bowl ring with the Eagles in 2018, helping them defeat the New England Patriots.After retirement, Braman focused on family and gave back to his Texas community through youth coaching and outreach programs. At the time of his death, his fortune was estimated in the seven-figure range, providing stability for the family he held dearest.Bryan Braman is survived by his two beloved daughters — Blakely, 11, and Marlowe (sometimes reported as Harlowe), 8 — who were his constant source of strength during his cancer battle. His mother, Tina Braman-Fields, played a crucial role in his final months, helping manage his care, fundraisers, and updates. Though he was not publicly linked to a spouse, his family unit was close-knit, with Tina stepping into a co-parenting role after his separation from his daughters' mother.While never a household name in the NFL, Bryan Braman quietly built a strong financial base through his years with teams like the Houston Texans, Philadelphia Eagles, and New Orleans Saints. His career earnings were estimated at over $4.7 million, and at the time of his death, his net worth was reportedly between $1.5 and $2 million. He also invested in community youth programs, especially in Texas, ensuring his legacy went beyond the gridiron.Braman passed away at age 38 after battling a rare and aggressive form of brain cancer. Diagnosed in February 2025, he underwent multiple surgeries and received advanced CAR-T cell therapy in Seattle. Despite the best medical efforts and over $88,000 raised through crowdfunding — including a generous $10,000 donation from J.J. Watt — the illness progressed quickly. His death has shaken both fans and former teammates who rallied around him during his final fight.Bryan Braman’s story wasn’t just about tackles and championships — it was about fighting for family, living with heart, and leaving behind more than stats ever could. As fans mourn his loss, they also celebrate a man who gave everything he had — on the field, and more importantly, off it.

Everytime, there's news about Commanders QB Jayden Daniels and any rumored relationship angle, more than him, it is his mom Regina Jackson who steals the show. Daniels' mom, who is very protective about his son and what way his life should take, believes it is all for her son's well-being only. But fans of the QB think otherwise. The same happened when Daniels walked out with USC superstar basketball player JuJu Watkins at her massive birthday party this week.Jayden Daniels and USC basketball star JuJu Watkins have had fans speculating about their relationship for months now, and the latest twist only adds fuel to the fire. Though neither of the two young stars has confirmed anything romantic, the internet can’t help but react—especially when Daniels was spotted at Watkins’ recent birthday bash.What truly sent social media into overdrive wasn’t just Daniels’ appearance but his mom, Regina Jackson, once again sliding into the spotlight. As one fan hilariously put it, “Jayden momma was right behind ’em holding both they hand.” While clearly an exaggeration, it’s not too far from what fans have come to expect from the ever-present Mama Daniels.One fan @TyronMcDaniel commented, ""Bro escaped from his moms grip, she prolly made him wear a wire 🤣🤣🤣"" While another named @rankit4mesports was however got surprised thinking that his mom was not there by saying, ""Surprised Ma Dukes wasn’t there.""

Buffalo Bills' Josh Allen embraces greener lifestyle with Hailee Steinfeld as new season looms



Josh Allen credits wife Hailee Steinfeld for giving him moral support



Buffalo Bills’ Super Bowl aspirations depend on Josh Allen's leadership— and new mindset



Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen is making a new noise on and off the field in 2025 by eliminating butter and dairy from his diet and creating a disciplined lifestyle with his actress wife, Hailee Steinfeld. Coming off a 2024 NFL MVP-winning season and a very public wedding in May, Josh Allen is zeroed in on his next goal: bringing the Buffalo Bills their first-ever Super Bowl championship.Entering NFL training camp, Josh Allen is demonstrating the same commitment to recovery and nutrition as he does to his game-day performance. During a recent interview with GQ, the Buffalo Bills star announced that he has eliminated butter and dairy from his diet, opting instead for lean proteins and nutrient-dense foods such as sushi in order to remain in top condition.""Honestly, right now, it’s probably the best it’s ever been, partly because I wanted to look good for some recent events in my life.” Josh Allen said.Josh Allen, 29, claims that the adjustments started with preparing for his wedding with Hailee Steinfeld—and he's remained on the routine since. With health and hardware in mind, he has moved toward a lighter meal plan, typically avoiding breakfast and relying on steak, chicken, and fish to power through his grueling workouts.""I was making sure that I was staying fit and slim so I could fit in the clothes. My diet consists of a pretty light breakfast or light lunch. Sometimes I don’t eat breakfast, and I don’t follow the intermittent fasting diet. When I wake up, I’m not extremely hungry. A lot of protein, whether it’s steak or chicken. I’ve really just dove into fish. Sushi is like my favorite food right now, so it’s helped me with diversifying my proteins and what carbs I’m taking in,” Allen shared. ""But I’m not sitting here counting calories. And when I’m back in Buffalo, we have a chef who cooks for us at least two times a week. I’m also taking the butter and dairy out, trying to eat very clean.”When he's home in Buffalo, Allen said the team's in-house chef is instrumental in keeping meals performance-driven. This enhanced focus on fitness comes as no surprise to his elite-level play. The quarterback has played in just four fewer games throughout his career, even with his high-contact style of play, and has continued to refine himself as a passer and as a runner.In addition to the physical change, Allen admitted to the emotional aid he's had from his wife, Pitch Perfect and Hawkeye star Hailee Steinfeld. Allen said last year, ""She’s been a huge part. The morale, the support. When I get home, she’s my biggest fan, my biggest supporter. She’s just the best.""The Buffalo Bills are again one of the top competitors in the AFC, joining the Kansas City Chiefs, Cincinnati Bengals, and Baltimore Ravens. For Josh Allen, however, this season is not about stats or MVPs—it's about getting over the hump and finally bringing a championship to Buffalo.Also read: Josh Allen gives up oceanfront mansion after secret wedding—did Hailee Steinfeld want him out of L.A.?

To recover from a recent groin injury, Caitlin Clark declared Thursday afternoon that she will not be playing in the All-Star Game or the three-point competition. Both the 3-point competition and the actual All-Star Game were scheduled to feature the WNBA legend, who is a captain. She also helped assemble one of the All-Star teams. However, she disclosed on Thursday that she will be sidelined and not competing in either event.The Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark was set to appear at Saturday's WNBA All-Star Game, but the event will have to continue without her. In a statement released by the team on their official Instagram page, Caitlin Clark stated:“I'm so excited for Indy to host WNBA All-Star this weekend. I want to thank the Indianapolis Host Committee and all of the people that have put endless work in over the past year to put this event together. I know this will be the best All-Star yet…”Then, expressing her regret, she further added:""I am incredibly sad and disappointed to say I can't participate in the 3-Point Contest or the All-Star Game. I have to rest my body.. I will still be at Gainbridge Fieldhouse for all the action, and I'm looking forward to helping (New York Liberty coach) Sandy (Brondello) coach our team to a win.""During Tuesday's 85–77 victory over the Connecticut Sun , she sustained a groin injury. This season, it was the third time she had to miss due to an injury. She was not present during Thursday's crushing defeat of Indiana by Liberty as well.The WNBA's ratings have suffered greatly as a result of the Iowa product's absence, and this weekend's game would be no exception. The Indiana Fever's home arena will host the WNBA All-Star Game on Saturday, July 19.The day before, the 3-Point Contest will take place.During the fateful match, just before the injury, Caitlin Clark helped Kelsey Mitchell make an easy layup with a bounce pass. She then walked carefully back up the court while gripping the inside of her right leg. Then, in fury, she slammed her head into the basket's cushioned back stanchion.On the other hand, the Indiana Fever are 5-5 without Caitlin Clark this season, despite having won three straight games to move up to 12-10.

Could Jake Briningstool be Travis Kelce’s long-term replacement?



Andy Reid and Kansas City Chiefs cannot overlook Jake Briningstool’s long-term potential value



A new era in Kansas City?



Jake Briningstool is becoming a credible threat to supplant Travis Kelce—on the field and in fantasy football—based on evaluators' tracking the Kansas City Chiefs' camp development. The young tight end, who was signed on as an undrafted free agent, has made the experts and fans take notice with his impressive play at the Kansas City Chiefs' latest minicamp. Analysts now wonder if Travis Kelce may still be a Kansas City legend.Jake Briningstool is fast on his way to becoming the most hyped young player in the Kansas City Chiefs' preseason organization. The ex-Clemson Tigers standout has been making waves during minicamp, which has NFL analyst Lance Zierlein giving the rookie's skill set and his place in the team some serious thought.“What Briningstool lacks in mass, he makes up for with toughness in both phases. He’s a possession-based tight end who majors in zone-beaters but will struggle to separate against man coverage. He operates in space with good body control and strong hands at the catch point and does an adequate job of keeping defenders on his hip. Despite a high pad level, he can help as a run blocker both connected to the line and in space.He’s not a true “Y” or “F” tight end but is capable enough in all areas to become a factor in two-tight-end sets,” wrote NFL analyst Lance Zierlin.As the Kansas City Chiefs prepare for another Super Bowl run, head coach Andy Reid and his staff may have discovered something greater than a depth chart option in Briningstool. With Travis Kelce nearing the end of his career, the team could be quietly planning for the next era at tight end.Fantasy owners are already paying attention. Jake Briningstool provides long-term potential value, particularly in dynasty formats where insight into player growth is important. If he becomes a key part of Kansas City's passing game, his value could mushroom—maybe even to the point of rivaling that of Travis Kelce.Nobody is counting out Travis Kelce just yet—far from it, fantasy football grizzled veterans—but Jake Briningstool's emergence does indicate that Kansas City might be looking to the future. If he keeps impressing throughout training camp and preseason games, Jake Briningstool might find himself as a key element of the Chiefs' offense sooner rather than later.Also read: “He’s in the sunken place”: Travis Kelce’s post-Taylor Swift transformation has fans spiraling Only time will reveal if he'll drape himself in the crown Kelce's possessed for almost a decade.

MVP pressure meets roster shake-ups and rising expectations

More than touchdowns: Josh Allen must carry the locker room and the city

Josh Allen must lead like a wolf, not just a star



As the 2025 NFL season looms, Josh Allen finds himself under a microscope bigger than ever before. He may be the reigning league MVP, but the weight of expectation hanging over the Buffalo Bills quarterback is far more than what a trophy can shoulder—and not even Hollywood star Hailee Steinfeld , his partner, can carry it with him.Josh Allen’s stellar 2024 campaign solidified him as one of the league’s elite, but success comes with a price. As Athlon Sports bluntly puts it, “Allen has now officially entered a space where the bar is nothing short of excellence.” That means one thing—anything less than a Super Bowl appearance will likely be deemed a disappointment.The Bills’ roster has undergone a significant transformation in the offseason. With star receiver Stefon Diggs out of the picture and new weapons like Keon Coleman, Curtis Samuel, and Mack Hollins stepping in, Allen isn’t just throwing passes—he’s responsible for building chemistry, leadership, and momentum. The pressure to unify this revamped offense falls squarely on his shoulders.Off the field, Allen and Steinfeld have become one of the NFL’s most-watched couples. But as Athlon Sports points out, “The burden Allen faces is less about the glitz of stardom and more about the grind of leadership.” In Buffalo, fans aren't dazzled by red carpets—they want a championship parade down Delaware Avenue.So far, Allen’s career has delivered thrilling plays and highlight reels, but no Super Bowl appearance.With time ticking and the roster shifting, 2025 could define how he’s remembered: as Buffalo’s MVP icon or just another almost-great quarterback.The Bills' offense can’t just function—it needs to click. New players must feel like family, and Allen is the one responsible for that emotional glue. “The Bills need people that will fight for the team like a wolf does for its pack,” one report stated. That leadership can’t be faked; it must be earned every week, every drive.Even with Steinfeld cheering from the sidelines, the pressure Allen faces is his alone. The city of Buffalo is hungry for more than promise—it’s craving results. And in 2025, Josh Allen must deliver.Also Read: Josh Allen can't beat Patrick Mahomes — and fans are starting to blame Hailee Steinfeld for the slump","Josh Allen is the reigning NFL MVP.

Surprisingly warm encounters with Swifties off the field

C.J. Gardner-Johnson isn’t backing down from his headline-grabbing feud with Taylor Swift and her devoted fanbase. From mocking Travis Kelce’s ex to wearing a vulgar anti-Swiftie shirt at the Super Bowl parade, the NFL star reignited the drama on The Pivot Podcast—and fans are once again debating whether he went too far for attention.Months after the Super Bowl parade confetti settled, NFL safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson is back in headlines—and once again, it involves Taylor Swift and her fiercely loyal fanbase. During a recent appearance on The Pivot Podcast, the former Eagles and current Super Bowl champion revisited the viral controversy that pitted him against the pop icon’s followers, the Swifties.What started as a locker room joke turned into a full-blown cultural clash between the NFL world and Swift’s global fan empire. At the center of the storm? An NSFW shirt, a post aimed at Travis Kelce’s ex Kayla Nicole, and a wave of backlash that spilled far beyond social media.The controversy began when Gardner-Johnson took to Instagram after Super Bowl LIX, seemingly mocking Kelce for dating Swift by suggesting he’d have won a ring had he stayed with Kayla Nicole. Just days later, he amped up the feud by wearing a sweatshirt at the Eagles’ parade that read, “Swifties can LIX my b----.”According to the safety, the shirt wasn’t his idea. “It was left in my locker by one of Big Dom DiSandro’s friends,” he explained, describing it as a locker room joke that unfortunately made its way to national headlines.The fallout was swift—literally. Taylor Swift’s fans didn’t just unfollow or unfavor him; they review-bombed his mother’s Florida restaurant on Yelp, unleashing waves of one-star ratings and snide remarks.Despite the chaos, Gardner-Johnson said some fans of Swift later approached him with a mix of criticism and kindness. “We don’t like what you did, but I’m a fan of you,” he recalled one Swiftie saying during a surprisingly pleasant chat in a Target aisle. Even amid controversy, moments of unexpected civility surfaced—hinting that not all fandom feuds are beyond repair.Still, the incident reignites conversations about boundaries between pop culture and sports trash talk.

has long been admired for his dominance on the court, but new information reveals just how much he has endured to stay there. Recently, former teammate Nicolas Batum shed light on the full extent of Embiid’s health challenges—offering a sobering account of pain, perseverance, and the physical sacrifices behind the scenes. The picture that emerges is one of extraordinary endurance in the face of adversity that was largely hidden from public view.Injuries have shadowed Joel Embiid’s entire career, starting with a stress fracture in college that delayed his NBA debut by two full seasons. Over the years, the list has only grown longer: meniscus tears, bone bruises, shoulder sprains, orbital fractures, tendinitis, and most recently, a battle with Bell’s Palsy—a condition that can cause facial paralysis, vision issues, and debilitating migraines.The 2023–24 season marked a low point. A torn meniscus required surgery in February 2024, yet Embiid rushed back for the playoffs—far from full strength and clearly laboring. He managed just 19 appearances in the 2024–25 season, falling well short of his MVP standard.The full extent of Joel Embiid’s physical condition was kept mostly under wraps—until Batum spoke with ESPN’s Dotun Akintoye. His firsthand account was striking.“I saw his knee before every game, after every game,” Batum revealed. “I have no idea how he could even walk.” The repeated astonishment in Batum’s words emphasized that Embiid’s condition wasn’t just painful—it was nearly unplayable.Beyond the knee, Embiid dealt with blurry vision, headaches, and chronic insomnia due to his left eye failing to close at night. His swollen knee required relentless care, and insiders suggest the true scope of his suffering went well beyond public reports. “It’s his knee, it’s his eye, it’s his whole system,” a Sixers team therapist explained, highlighting how the superstar’s body was struggling on multiple fronts.Despite the severity of his condition, Embiid rarely spoke about it. His silence masked ongoing grief, sleep deprivation, and moments where he considered whether he could continue at all.Embiid’s compromised health had immediate consequences. The Sixers finished with just 24 wins in 2024–25—missing the playoffs for the first time in eight years. Embiid’s individual stats (23.8 points and 8.2 rebounds per game) were still impressive by league standards, but far from the dominance fans had come to expect.Despite the grim details, there is cautious optimism within the Sixers organization. Team president Daryl Morey recently confirmed that Embiid is progressing well in rehab and is expected to be ready for training camp in September 2025. With the return of Tyrese Maxey and the addition of Paul George, Philadelphia hopes to reignite its championship ambitions—if Embiid can stay healthy.Also read: Damian Lillard Returns to Portland Trail Blazers on Three-Year, $42 Million Deal Featuring No-Trade Clause Joel Embiid’s journey is now defined not just by stats or accolades, but by the sheer resilience he’s shown in the face of relentless adversity.

From Portland Star to Milwaukee Setback

Why It Makes Sense for Both Sides

Damian Damian Lillard’s Perspective

Trail Blazers’ Perspective

Looking Ahead: A Comeback in the Works

Lillard by the Numbers

is officially coming home. The nine-time All-Star guard has agreed to a three-year, $42 million contract with the Portland Trail Blazers , marking a dramatic and heartfelt return to the franchise that launched his NBA stardom. The deal, first reported by Shams Charania, instantly reignites a deep bond between Lillard and the city of Portland — one built on loyalty, legacy, and unforgettable moments.The structure of the contract is telling. While Damian Lillard is coming off a max-level deal that earned him over $60 million annually in Milwaukee, this agreement reflects a clear mutual respect between player and team. It also gives Lillard rare power with a no-trade clause — a privilege currently shared only with LeBron James. Damian Lillard was selected sixth overall by the Blazers in the 2012 NBA Draft. Over 11 seasons, he carved out an iconic career in Rip City, leading the team to eight playoff appearances and establishing himself as its all-time leading scorer. His time in Portland included signature moments like his 37-foot buzzer-beater to eliminate the Thunder in 2019 — a defining shot in modern playoff lore.In 2023, Lillard was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in search of a championship. While the pairing with Giannis Antetokounmpo held promise, the stint was rocky.Injuries, chemistry challenges, and internal changes hampered Milwaukee’s success. A torn Achilles during the 2025 postseason further derailed Lillard’s campaign, casting uncertainty over his future.- Emotional Return: Portland is more than a team to Damian Lillard — it’s where he built his career and earned lifelong admiration from fans.- Legacy Focus: After a turbulent chapter in Milwaukee, returning offers him a shot at redemption and the chance to retire on his terms.- Controlled Comeback: The deal allows Lillard to prioritize recovery without external pressure, thanks to the built-in player option and no-trade clause.- Guiding Leadership: Lillard’s leadership will be crucial for mentoring the franchise’s young core and re-establishing a winning culture.- Fan Connection: His return energizes a fan base that never stopped supporting him, giving the franchise an emotional boost.- Cap-Friendly Investment: A $14 million salary for a franchise legend — even one rehabbing — is a smart financial play.All signs point to Damian Lillard sitting out most, if not all, of the 2025–26 season as he rehabs from the Achilles injury. But if history is any indication, Lillard’s dedication and work ethic could set the stage for one of the most compelling comebacks in recent memory. And with full control of his future, he’s positioned to write the ending his career deserves.- Career Points Per Game: 25.1- Assists Per Game: 6.7- Franchise Leader: Points, three-pointers made, and playoff heroics- Iconic Moment: 2019 buzzer-beater vs. Thunder — a shot still echoing through NBA historyDamian Lillard’s return isn’t just a basketball move — it’s a cultural moment for Portland. It’s a testament to the rare, enduring relationship between a player and the city that embraced him. As Rip City awaits the next chapter, one thing is certain: the heartbeat of the franchise is back.Also read: Dwyane Wade Compares Angel Reese to “A More Aggressive Draymond Green” in Powerful Statement on Her WNBA Breakout Season Welcome home, Dame.

Leadership Beyond the Numbers

A Symbolic Shift in the Game

When a basketball icon likedraws a parallel between two players, it commands attention—and his latest comparison is no exception. The three-time NBA champion and part-owner of the WNBA’s Chicago Sky recently heaped praise on rookie sensation, boldly calling her “a more aggressive Draymond Green.”Draymond Green has long been the NBA’s blueprint for defensive versatility and emotional leadership. Though not a traditional scorer, Green’s impact lies in his ability to defend multiple positions, rebound ferociously, set the tone with his voice, and keep the locker room energy alive. His IQ and ability to initiate fast breaks with quick, intelligent passes have made him an indispensable part of the Golden State Warriors dynasty. Angel Reese , a standout rookie for the Sky, has already shown that she’s more than just a promising young talent—she’s a game-changer. Known for her physical play, relentless rebounding, and fierce competitiveness, she’s become a defensive force in her first WNBA season. Wade took note of her rapid growth and rising confidence, saying: “Angel Reese is hooping, dog. Her game is opening up, her bag is opening up, her confidence is getting even higher.She’s playing the game like a more aggressive Draymond Green.”Through the early part of her debut season, Reese has made headlines with multiple double-digit rebounding performances. While her scoring is still coming into form, her ability to influence games on both ends of the floor mirrors the multifaceted role Draymond Green plays in Golden State. She’s a defensive anchor who thrives on second chances and gritty hustle plays—exactly the kind of attributes that don’t always show up in highlight reels but make coaches and teammates take notice. Dwyane Wade ’s emphasis on Angel Reese being “more aggressive” highlights her go-all-out mentality. She:- Fights relentlessly for rebounds- Throws herself into loose ball situations- Fires up her teammates with energy and attitude- Isn’t afraid of physicality or confrontationIt’s the kind of edge that has won her both praise and criticism—just like Green. Interestingly, even Green recently called out the Sky’s physical style of play, perhaps indirectly acknowledging the very energy he’s long been known for.But Dwyane Wade’s comparison goes deeper than gameplay. It’s also about leadership. Draymond Green has served as an emotional compass for the Warriors, inspiring teammates through his fire and passion. In a similar vein, Reese is emerging as a cornerstone of the Sky’s identity—someone whose hustle and emotion are contagious. She’s quickly become a rallying point for the team, setting the tone despite her rookie status.Wade’s words don’t just validate Reese’s early impact—they point to a larger narrative shift. As the WNBA continues to gain momentum and visibility, comparing rising stars like Reese to established NBA figures bridges the gap for broader audiences. It’s a recognition that the women’s game features the same grit, emotion, and star power—and Reese may be leading that charge with her unrelenting style.Also read: Bradley Beal’s Quiet Exit from Phoenix Sends NBA Into Emoji-Fueled Frenzy As the season unfolds, all eyes will be on Angel Reese.

Dakota Joshua's comeback after cancer battle tells a lot



Leafs’ offseason overhaul continues with familiar face



The Toronto Maple Leafs have brought forward Dakota Joshua back into their fold after acquiring him from the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for a fourth-round pick in the 2028 NHL Draft. The 29-year-old, who was initially drafted by Toronto in 2014, is returning to the franchise after a winding journey through the league, highlighted by resilience, growth, and a strong two-way presence on the ice.Dakota Joshua's return to Toronto comes after one of the most emotional years of his professional career. Despite missing the early part of the 2024–25 NHL season due to surgery and recovery from testicular cancer, Joshua managed to make a solid impact upon his return. He posted seven goals and 14 points over 57 games and ranked second on the Canucks in hits with 193, proving his physicality never wavered even after a life-altering diagnosis.“Dakota went through a lot last season before the year even started and we were very impressed in how he handled such a difficult off-ice situation,” said Canucks general manager Patrik Allvin. “Once healthy, he tried hard to help the team in many ways, and we want to wish him the best moving forward in Toronto.”Joshua had signed a four-year, $13 million contract with the Canucks in June 2024, carrying a $3.25 million AAV through the 2027–28 season. His 2023–24 season had already seen career-high performances in goals (18), assists (14), and points (32) across 63 games, setting the tone for what Toronto hopes to be a productive chapter in his career.The Dakota Joshua trade marks the latest in a series of bold moves by the Maple Leafs this offseason. The team recently acquired Matias Maccelli from the Utah Mammoth, Nicolas Roy from Vegas in a blockbuster deal involving Mitch Marner, and defenseman Henry Thrun from San Jose.While Joshua never played a game for Toronto after being drafted in the fifth round in 2014, his return signifies a full-circle moment. He went on to debut in the NHL with the St. Louis Blues in the 2020–21 season and has since amassed 78 points in 241 career games, alongside 8 points in 14 Stanley Cup Playoff appearances.Now back where it all started, Joshua arrives in Toronto with unfinished business—and a chance to redefine his story in blue and white.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumor: Could the Golden Knights really land Connor McDavid after Mitch Marner’s shocking trade?",The Toronto Maple Leafs have acquired Dakota Joshua from the Vancouver Canucks.

Wayne Gretzky’s 400-goal season as a kid drew the attention of the media

Walter Gretzky tried to tone down the hype, but the nickname stuck

Long before Wayne Gretzky dominated NHL record books and became a global icon, his legendary nickname — The Great One — was already following him around the rinks of Ontario. But as Gretzky recently revealed ahead of Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Final, the origin of that iconic moniker goes back to when he was just 10 years old, lighting up minor league hockey in Brantford.Speaking candidly, Gretzky shared how a mind-blowing 400-goal season as a 10-year-old caught the attention of a reporter from the London Free Press. The journalist, impressed by the young prodigy's scoring spree, wrote a feature story that would unknowingly set a cultural moment in motion.“I was 10 years old,” Gretzky said. “A reporter from the London Free Press came down and did a story on me — I scored 400 goals that year.“At the end of the article, he said, ‘NHL guys have one nickname — Mr. Hockey, the Golden Jet. And he said, ‘We should just call him The Great One.’”The nickname, intended as a compliment from a local reporter, had staying power. But not everyone was on board at first — especially Gretzky’s father, Walter, who was hesitant about the title being attached to his son so early.“Well, my dad tried to kill that right away,” Gretzky recalled.“And it just kept coming back and coming back.”Despite his father’s initial resistance, the name became inescapable. And as Wayne continued to grow into the sport — eventually scoring 894 NHL goals, collecting 2,857 career points, and winning four Stanley Cups — the nickname proved prophetic.“Finally, I just was like, ‘Well, we’re going to have to live with it,’” Gretzky added with a laugh.Also Read: Anton Frondell snubs Blackhawks and Connor Bedard to stay in Sweden with childhood club In hindsight, the reporter’s intuition was spot-on. “The Great One” didn’t just describe Gretzky’s potential — it defined a career that would go unmatched in hockey history.","Wayne Gretzky's iconic nickname, ""The Great One,"" originated when he was just 10 years old.

The 2025-26 NHL season will feature no shortage of drama, but one of the most emotionally charged matchups will come when Mitch Marner steps back onto the ice at Scotiabank Arena—this time, wearing a Vegas Golden Knights jersey. The former Toronto Maple Leafs star is scheduled to return to Toronto on January 23, 2026, marking his first game back since being traded in a blockbuster sign-and-trade deal earlier this offseason.After spending nine seasons with the Leafs and becoming a core pillar of the franchise, Marner’s departure was as heartbreaking as it was inevitable. Drafted fourth overall in 2015, he racked up an impressive 741 points in 657 games, ranking fifth all-time in Leafs franchise history. Despite his consistent performance, Toronto’s inability to make a deep playoff run led to increasing scrutiny—and ultimately, his exit.Marner’s first meeting against the Leafs will actually take place January 15, 2026, in Vegas. But it’s the January 23 return to Toronto that fans have circled in red. This isn’t just another regular-season game—it’s a reunion, a reckoning, and for many, a reflection on what could have been.While Marner's exit drew mixed reactions across the league, one of his former teammates, Ryan Reaves, came to his defense during a candid appearance on the ""Cam & Strick"" podcast.“Mitchie earned the right to go wherever he wants. He's dedicated a lot of his career — his whole career — to Toronto. A hometown guy. He's poured everything he had into it. Sometimes it's just time to move on,” Reaves said.He also didn’t shy away from pointing fingers at the Toronto fanbase, hinting that the pressure may have pushed Marner out: “I think they can be a little ruthless to him. I guess just because he's the hometown guy, and sometimes fans want to point fingers at somebody.”Also Read: Mathew Tkachuk injury fallout: Panthers face major setback as star may need surgery and miss 2026 opener As the Leafs gear up to face Marner and the Golden Knights, one thing is clear: January 23 won’t just be about points in the standings—it’ll be about closure, reflection, and the ever-evolving relationship between a city and its fallen hockey hero.","Mitch Marner is scheduled to return to Toronto on January 23, 2026.

Damian Lillard

is heading back to where it all began. After a dramatic roster shakeup in the Milwaukee Bucks, the nine-time All-Star guard has rejoined the Portland Trail Blazers on a three-year, $42 million contract. The move comes after the Bucks made the unexpected decision to waive and stretch the remainder of Damian Lillard’s $113 million deal to free up cap space—paving the way for a major signing of center Myles Turner on a four-year, $108.9 million deal. Giannis Antetokounmpo , who shared the court with Lillard for just two seasons, was quick to show support. While the Bucks’ star forward hasn’t made a public statement, he did like Lillard’s Instagram post announcing his return to Portland—a subtle but meaningful gesture recognizing their brief partnership.Milwaukee’s decision to let go of Lillard stunned many around the league, especially given the high hopes that followed the 2023 blockbuster trade that brought Damian Lillard to the Bucks. Despite the hype surrounding the pairing of two future Hall of Famers, the experiment fell short. The Bucks were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs in consecutive seasons, with injuries hampering their ability to compete at full strength.As the Bucks move forward, they’ve focused on adding depth and versatility. Alongside Turner, Milwaukee has signed Cole Anthony and Gary Harris, while retaining several core contributors. The franchise appears committed to maximizing Giannis Antetokounmpo ’s prime years with a reloaded roster.Meanwhile, Damian Lillard, now 35, returns to Rip City as a veteran presence. Although he is expected to miss most—or potentially all—of the 2025–26 season due to a torn left Achilles tendon, his leadership is seen as crucial for a Portland squad seeking its first playoff berth since 2021.During his time in Milwaukee, Lillard averaged 24.6 points, 7.0 assists, and 4.6 rebounds across 131 games. While the partnership with Giannis didn’t yield the desired postseason results, it was a memorable chapter in both players’ careers—and the quiet nod from Giannis Antetokounmpo suggests mutual respect remains intact.Also read: Former 76ers star uncovers brutal truth about Joel Embiid's Injury Ordeal - ""I have no idea how he could even walk!""

Why Matthew Tkachuk would trust TJ Oshie over Wayne Gretzky in a do-or-die shootout



Shootouts weren’t part of Wayne Gretzky’s era



In a recent conversation that sparked debates across the hockey world, Florida Panthers star Matthew Tkachuk made an eyebrow-raising revelation. If his life were on the line and one player had to take a shootout shot, he wouldn't go with “The Great One. ” Instead, he’d trust TJ Oshie—a decision rooted in one unforgettable Olympic moment that still gives hockey fans chills.During an appearance on Jon “Stugotz” Weiner’s podcast at the American Century Championship celebrity golf event, Tkachuk didn’t hesitate much before making the bold call. “That’s so tough… I feel like I saw somewhere once Gretzky said he didn’t like breakaways, which I find that’s not true, but one of my favorite moments in sports history was watching Oshie in the four-shootout-goal game, so I’m going to take Oshie. ”Tkachuk’s choice stems from the now-iconic 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics performance where Oshie, then 27, practically became a national hero. With nerves of steel, he netted four shootout goals in Team USA’s dramatic group-stage win over Russia. The display wasn’t just impressive—it was unforgettable. It became a masterclass in poise, execution, and resilience under pressure.It’s not just nostalgia talking, either.Statistically, Oshie has been one of the NHL’s most lethal shootout performers. With 49 shootout goals over 16 seasons, he’s tied for third all-time in league history—a testament to his consistency and skill in high-stakes moments.While Wayne Gretzky’s legacy as hockey’s most prolific scorer is unquestionable, it’s important to note that the shootout format didn’t even exist during his NHL career. Introduced in 2005, nearly six years after his retirement, the shootout became a whole new dimension of pressure and technique—one Oshie mastered while Gretzky never faced.Sure, Gretzky thrived in breakaways and even converted a penalty shot, but the dynamics of a modern shootout require a unique kind of mentality. For Tkachuk, Oshie represents that rare mix of calm and cold-blooded execution. In a life-or-death scenario, that’s exactly who you’d want.And with that pick, Tkachuk not only gave Oshie a massive nod—but also reminded fans that greatness can look different, depending on the moment.Also Read: NHL Trade: Toronto’s acquisition of Dakota Joshua hints at bigger plans for the upcoming season",Matthew Tkachuk said he would trust TJ Oshie over Wayne Gretzky in a do-or-die shootout.

Will the Golden State Warriors Pull the Trigger?

In a bold trade scenario gaining traction, theare projected to acquire defensive specialist, along with Jett Howard and Mo Gueye, in a three-team deal involving the Orlando Magic and Atlanta Hawks. The proposed move, originally detailed by Sports Illustrated’s Rohan Raman, aims to fortify the Warriors’ aging defensive core and provide much-needed size on the wing.Here’s a look at the specifics of the hypothetical trade:The Golden State Warriors have long leaned on the versatility of Draymond Green at the center spot, a strategy that has helped them win four championships in the last decade. However, with Green turning 35 and the NBA moving toward bigger lineups again, the need for a legitimate frontcourt defender has grown.Jonathan Isaac, a 6-foot-10 forward with elite defensive metrics, offers a potential solution. Despite his inconsistent offensive production and persistent injury issues, Isaac’s impact on defense is undeniable.According to Raman, “Jonathan Isaac would give them insurance… although Isaac’s limited offensive game and injury history make him a difficult player to roster on a contender, his defense is still very useful.” Draymond Green Load Management: With Isaac in the mix, Green can be rested or preserved for key moments during the season.- Defensive Versatility: Isaac’s length and mobility allow him to guard multiple positions, from power forwards to larger wings.- Rebounding Boost: Isaac’s elite rebounding numbers could help a Golden State Warriors team that has struggled on the glass in recent seasons.For Orlando, flipping Isaac—who has struggled to stay on the court—for younger talent like Moses Moody and Gui Santos aligns with their timeline and helps add offensive upside to their developing roster.Meanwhile, Atlanta acquires Goga Bitadze for frontcourt depth and secures a 2027 first-round pick, giving them flexibility for future moves.While this trade remains hypothetical, it reflects the kind of creative restructuring the Golden State Warriors may need as they transition from dynasty to contender once more. The addition of Jonathan Isaac, even with injury concerns, could pay off handsomely if he stays healthy and fits into Steve Kerr’s system.Also read: NBA Free Agency Rumors: Veteran insider predicts the Golden State Warriors might bag $19,500,000 star to shake up roster and bolster title push As the offseason continues, fans and analysts alike will be watching closely to see if this potential deal—or a version of it—becomes a reality.","The Golden State Warriors have long leaned on the versatility of Draymond Green at the center spot.

Why the Portland Trail Blazers Acquired Damian Lillard



Damian Lillard is officially headed back to where it all began. After a brief and turbulent stint with the Milwaukee Bucks, the nine-time NBA All-Star is returning to the Portland Trail Blazers on a new deal. Lillard, who was waived earlier this offseason after suffering a major injury, will rejoin the franchise that drafted him in 2012. While several top contenders showed interest, the veteran point guard expressed feelings with a short message for the franchise.Damian Lillard reacted to his return to the Portland Trail Blazers with a two-word message. Lillard, who began his NBA journey in Portland as the sixth overall pick in the 2012 Draft, has found his way back to the city where he became a legend. In an emotional post on X, he shared a video that ended with a close-up of a locker bearing his name and the words “Together Again.” The full caption: “RipCityyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!! @trailblazers”ESPN's Shams Charania broke the news of Lillard's deal, stating, “BREAKING: Nine-time NBA All-Star Damian Lillard is finalizing a three-year, $42 million contract to return to the Portland Trail Blazers, sources tell ESPN. The deal is expected to include a player option in 2027-28 and a no-trade clause. A storybook reunion home for the 35-year-old.”Lillard played just 58 games for the Bucks due to various injuries, including a blood clot and eventually a torn left Achilles tendon during the playoffs. While his comeback may be delayed, the symbolism of his return is not lost on fans or the franchise. He was quick to make it clear there’s no bad blood between him and Portland after last year’s trade, as he had always expressed a desire to return someday.The three-year contract with Portland is worth $42 million, but Lillard’s financial situation is more layered. He is still owed $113 million by the Bucks, a sum they’ve chosen to stretch over five seasons. Charania revealed that, “Lillard now will have a 2025-26 set salary of $70M between his Portland and Milwaukee deals, and a salary of $141M over the next two years ahead of an opt-out in 2027.”Bringing back Lillard was more than a nostalgic gesture, as it was strategic for Portland. GM Joe Cronin and head coach Chauncey Billups held multiple meetings with the veteran guard to explore a possible reunion.The Trail Blazers are in a rebuild phase, focusing on young stars like Scoot Henderson and Shaedon Sharpe. Still, Lillard’s leadership and bond with the fanbase make him an essential figure. His presence in the locker room— even while sidelined— offers unmatched experience and cultural stability.Also Read: Giannis Antetokounmpo Reacts as Damian Lillard Returns to Portland in Surprising NBA Shakeup Additionally, despite the injury, his value remains high.

The NBA community, especially his fellow players, responded with a mix of laughter, sarcasm, and understanding:- Kevin Durant, now with the Houston Rockets, replied with a simple “😂”.- Bam Adebayo followed suit with the same laughing emoji.- Trae Young joked: “Not the deuces ✌️😂”- Tyus Jones added: “Aye man 🤣🤣”- Andre Drummond summed up the sentiment with: “Lmaooo your sick”The minimalism struck a chord—one emoji carried more weight than any formal statement. Bradley Beal ’s time in Phoenix never lived up to the hype. Hampered by injuries, he averaged just over 50 games per season. Despite the combined star power of Beal, Durant, and Booker, the Suns failed to win a single playoff game during Beal’s tenure.Their 2025 campaign ended in a first-round sweep, followed by an outright playoff miss.Statistically, Bradley Beal produced solid numbers—around 17 points per game on efficient shooting—but critics argued his performances lacked meaningful impact. The much-hyped trio couldn’t generate consistent offense together, and the chemistry never materialized on the court.Following a mutual buyout, Beal is now set to join the Los Angeles Clippers , giving him a fresh opportunity to reestablish himself in a new system. He also reportedly gave up $14 million in the process. Meanwhile, Phoenix clears significant salary cap space and pivots toward building around Devin Booker.Yet, for many, it’s not Beal’s next step that’s memorable—it’s how he exited. That single emoji symbolized the disbanding of what was once envisioned as the NBA’s next great superteam.The responses from Durant, Adebayo, and others weren’t just jokes—they reflected the deeper culture of the league:- A sense of fraternity: NBA players often poke fun at one another in ways only insiders understand.- Shared frustration: Many stars, including Durant, had experienced the same disappointing ride in Phoenix.- An unspoken message: Beal’s peace sign may have said more than words could—about the chaos, the exit, and maybe even relief.Bradley Beal’s exit from Phoenix won’t be remembered for a teary tribute or a media circus. It will be remembered for its quiet finality and the wave of reactions it triggered. His time in the desert will likely go down as one of the NBA’s biggest “what-ifs”—but at least, in true NBA fashion, it left the league entertained.Also read: Joel Embiid Addresses Leadership Criticism in the Highly Demanding NBA League: ""You Can’t Expect Me to Be Part of That Again"" Now headed to the Clippers, Bradley Beal turns the page.

"41st anniversary of The Times of India, Bengaluru: Bong Bangalored!",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/41st-anniversary-of-the-times-of-india-bengaluru-bong-bangalored/articleshow/122726408.cms,"Despite Those Oodles And Oodles Of Puddles, My Love For The City Keeps Growing By The Month





Standing on the balcony of our hotel room near Langford Gardens, the ‘beat’ emanating from those heavy-duty loudspeakers on St Joseph’s College campus was unmistakable. Chart-busting Eurodance group Vengaboys was performing live, and my sister and I were thrilled that those Rotterdam guys were closer than we thought – ‘right here, right now’!For, until then, the closest bond we struck with such foot-stomping stuff as‘Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom’, or ‘We’re Going to Ibiza’ was only through the medium of the ubiquitous audio CD. And here they were – playing live.That was the winter of 2000, and I was on my first visit to Bengaluru, then Bangalore.Coming from Calcutta, now Kolkata, a city better known for staging the venerated annual Indian classical music fest, The Dover Lane Music Conference, than playing host to western pop soirees, what struck me that January night was the large number of youngsters making a beeline for the concert venue at the college ground.Their energy, verve, tenor were so steeped in an inescapable urgency to live life to the fullest that it reminded me of what one of my JNU classmates had once told me. Knowing full well that I’d invariably be booking my Rajdhani ticket to Calcutta to respond to the allure of that autumnal zest that Bengalis love to refer to as ‘Pujo’, Jeesha Menon, a true-blue Bangalorean and diehard fan of Mahesh Dattani’s theatre, told me: “Skip the ‘Pujo’ once, Das, and come to Bangalore.Promise you a cracker.”Jeesha’s invitation was politely turned down because being in Delhi had already made me too homesick to look for greener pastures other than Calcutta, but standing on that Langford Gardens hotel balcony on a chilly night in Bengaluru and watching those youngsters turn up for the Vengaboys concert made me realise what she had probably meant many moons back.Jump cut to the summer of 2023. I return to Bengaluru, this time with a new job at TOI. Lo and behold. The conceptual construct of a quaint, chic, stylish city -- based on what I had seen, heard and felt almost a quarter of a century ago -- was jolted by a reality check marked by potholed roads, abrasive driving, rush-hour road rage, all-too-frequent power cuts, dry taps and never-ending infra work pushing Bengaluru’s brand equity as a ‘Garden City’ to the backburner, with invisible ‘work-in-progress’ boards hung all over.Worse still, on the very first weekend after I landed here, my run-in with an auto driver off Brigade Road, who roundly abused me with expletives in Hindi, made me wonder whether it’s the same city that had so impressed me with its sobriety and sophistication back in 2000 or, for that matter, the metropolis that Jeesha would go ga-ga about over umpteen cups of tea at JNU’s ‘intellectual hotbed’ called Ganga Dhaba.Yet, beyond the hustle bustle and the rough and tumble of this many-splendoured and often-misunderstood city lies the wider canvas of a melting pot, an ‘existential angst’ that shocks and enamours in equal measures. If you opt to be numbed by the ‘shock’, then you’d certainly miss out on the finer points of life that this city offers.And, if you prefer to only gloss over the endearing factors and live in denial of the squalor, you’d probably be denying yourself the other half of a lived experience – an experience that rolls detachment and engagement, love and indifference, agony and ecstasy into one composite whole like a Roman Polanski film.Remember ‘Bitter Moon’? Quite like the 1992 Hugh Grant classic, present-day Bengaluru makes you feel that you are the victim and the torturer – all at once.Retribution can only come through accepting the fact that given those millions who have descended upon this city from all over the country to call this place their second home, self included, Bengaluru has been stretched to its maximum to make us all feel welcome and wanted. The collaterals are concomitants.The ‘existential angst’ was all too palpable when those 11 RCB fans lost their lives, trying to accord a heroes’ welcome to the 2025 IPL champions. Many would question: ‘Is this Bangalore? Whither Bangalore?’ Personally speaking, those deaths, unfortunate as they were, perhaps bore one of the surest signs of a city having far extended its reach and appeal beyond its immediate geo-cultural template and emerge a lodestone for a much wider, varied audience – an audience bent on soaking up life even in all its frailties and perils.Having spent two years in this city now, I can say this without a modicum of doubt that the abusive auto driver off Brigade Road, for me, is an islet of aberrance, an air-pocket of turbulence, but certainly not an apocalyptic wind system that would knock the daylights out of me.Better still, I’d root for that auto captain who agreed to drop me to Richmond Circle from Garuda Mall for Rs 90, but as I was about to scan the QR code upon reaching the destination, said out of his own volition, “Sir, 80 de do” (give me just 80), realizing that the evening traffic down Richmond Road wasn’t all that bad.As I mentioned earlier, Bengaluru for me is a melting pot of cultures, of identities, of a shared sense of belonging – much like what I had experienced in Dubai during my nearly two decades of living and working there. Quite like that charming UAE emirate, the Karnataka capital continues to roll out the red carpet to all those who keep streaming into this ‘IT hub’ in search of a better way of life and, perhaps, for more love per square foot.Add to that the city’s culinary delights, its vast patches of green that are unparallelled anywhere in India, its vibrant, pulsating nightlife, and, most of all, a god-gifted weather that doesn’t punctuate conjugal bliss with the threat of ‘kinetic action’ unleashed over whether the room AC should be set at 18 or 24 at bedtime! On a more personal note, did I tell you that I’ve rekindled my love for vinyl after moving to this city? That record store on MG Road is such a treasure trove that I ended up buying a vinyl player, breathing new life into a childhood fascination – quite like revisiting those yellow, worn-out pages of a long-forgotten Scrap Book.Though I continue to be a Bong at heart who’s not ready to trade his ‘mishti doi’ for a plate of ‘obbattu’ – not yet, that is – I must still confess I’m besotted by Mysore Pak and delectable, slicky masala dosas, washed down with fresh filter coffee at some of those iconic Bengaluru eateries.For me, this city is as much about its pain pit-stops as it is about its pleasure points. So, I’ll continue to fret and fume behind the wheel as I negotiate oodles and oodles of puddles on a rain-soaked, bumpy drive down Bannerghatta Road, but quietly assuaging the frustration with this hope that the next visit to my favourite lounge bar atop World Trade Center or the next play at Rangashankara is just a weekend away.Quantum of solace. Life’s good.","Bengaluru is a melting pot, an ‘existential angst’ that shocks and enamours in equal measures. Bengaluru has been stretched to its maximum to make us all feel welcome and wanted. The collaterals are conitants who are lost at once – all at once. The present-day Bengaluru makes you feel that you are the victim of torture.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122726474,imgsize-40904,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/122726474.jpg"

IND vs ENG: Team India's plan, practice schedule and weather forecast in Manchester

After Lord’s heartbreak, Team India start training for Manchester, in London!

NEW DELHI: With India trailing 1-2 in the five-match Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, veteran batter Ajinkya Rahane has issued a stirring call to the team management ahead of the crucial fourth Test in Manchester: ""You’re going to win a Test match or a Test series by getting 20 wickets.""Rahane’s comments come after India’s narrow 22-run loss at Lord’s, despite packing their XI with all-rounders like Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, and Nitish Kumar Reddy - all of whom made useful contributions. The strategy, rooted in head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s preference for batting depth, has yielded mixed results in the longer format.“We all know that Day 4 and 5 get slightly difficult to bat on. It’s not easy to score runs,” Rahane explained on his YouTube channel. “Yes, England bowled really well. But I felt India missed an opportunity to get that big score on the board in the first innings. Also, going forward, India should look to add one extra bowler - because you’re going to win a Test match or a Test series by getting 20 wickets.”India’s selection dilemma is now sharper than ever. With the batting-heavy strategy not delivering wins, Rahane’s call to bolster the bowling attack presents a critical decision point for captain Shubman Gill and Gambhir.Rahane also praised Ben Stokes for a pivotal fielding moment that turned the tide at Lord’s. “It’s very easy for the fielder to get relaxed when you see only two or three balls left before lunch. But his attitude towards the ball, his intensity, and getting that run-out - that’s where I felt England came into the game.”At the time, India were 40 for 1 and cruising, but the run-out followed by Karun Nair’s LBW dismissal shifted momentum. “That was a turning point,” Rahane noted. “England’s bowling tightened up, their fielding intensity increased, and they showed great character.”Despite a strong fightback from India later, Rahane admitted they were “75–100 runs short” in the first innings. He singled out KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant’s partnership as a highlight, but emphasised that without taking 20 wickets, victories will remain elusive.",Ajinkya Rahane says India should look to add one extra bowler to their attack.

"41st anniversary of The Times of India, Bengaluru: How KSLTA hit a fierce forehand",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/41st-anniversary-of-the-times-of-india-bengaluru-how-kslta-hit-a-fierce-forehand/articleshow/122725729.cms,"



If tennis has a home in Karnataka, it is thanks in no small measure to SM Krishna , the late chief minister who helped shift gears and move the game along into the new millennium in his two-decade tenure as president of the state body.Krishna, for whom tennis was an emotion, once consoled himself after an electoral loss with a game played between chalked lines. He was president of Karnataka State Lawn Tennis Association from 1999 to 2019.Sunder Raju, a tennis enthusiast, knocked on Krishna’s door at the turn of the millennium with a line that’s now a part of folklore in tennis circles. “Sir, tennis needs you, KSLTA needs you,” Raju had said.The KSLTA Stadium nestled in Bengaluru’s green bed Cubbon Park was completed in 1976. It had five clay courts -- four in the stadium and one just outside the main facility -- with unfin- ished stands at one end. That’s how it stayed for almost 25 years until the SM KrishnaSunder Raju team took over the space armed with a rubric document titled Vision 2000. Sunil Yajaman, joint secretary of KSLTA and a regular at the stadium as a player, says the place was a favourite hangout in his younger days.“I remember when India played Sweden in the Davis Cup in 1985, the clay courts were converted to grass courts,” Yajaman said.“Even then I thought this place had so much potential.”Yajaman was one of the three people, along with Raju and RT Narayan, who had reached out to SM Krishna in the lead-up to the 1999 assembly elections. Raju had asked Krishna to lead the state body. “It will be a pleasure, tennis is in my heart always,” Krishna had said.By the time the new committee took over the KSLTA, SM Krishna was chief minister. The first order of business for the new committee at the stadium was to host a big international event. The aim was to use the championship to raise funds to improve the unkempt facility.Some 12 months later, in December 2000, a new-look KSLTA stadium hosted the ATP World doubles championship.Yajaman, who was coaching at the time, had shifted to Delhi as All India Tennis Association’s talent development officer. When he returned, the stadium wore a whole different look: the stands were finally complete and had bucket seats. The tightly lined clay courts had given way to three synthetic match courts in addition to the one outside.“Krishna’s love for the sport was the foundation for the growth of tennis in Karnataka,” Yajaman said. “The way I see it, it was Sunder’s vision and Krishna’s leadership, with RT Narayan working tirelessly behind the scenes to pull off mega events. At that time, KSLTA went through a transformation that many of us who played on those courts in the 1980s could only dream of.”The last five years has seen the facility -- now eponymously called the SM Krishna Tennis Stadium -- take on club status. The tennis venue, spread over two acres, has a multicuisine restaurant, a mini pool and rooms for lodging.It is among the better -- if not the best -- of club houses among sporting facilities in the state. Yajaman underlined that the most significant contribution of the SM Krishna-Sunder Raju team was to take the game to Tier two sectors.“It started in Kalaburagi in the early 2000s, Tumakuru, Chikkamagaluru and Davanagere. Now we have tennis in some 12 districts,” Yajaman noted. Rohan Bopanna , the former doubles No.1 and evergreen pro, applauded Krishna’s contribution. “I was 19 when the ATP World Doubles was held in Bengaluru. To watch so many international players here was a huge inspiration to me,” he said.“Under Krishna’s leadership, tennis went to so many districts in Karnataka,” Bopanna added. “I was one of those players who went to all these districts, played tennis there and enjoyed the atmosphere, playing in front of spectators who were enthusiastic about the sport. A lot of youngsters give up tennis because it’s too difficult to travel, getting visas is not easy, hosting this level of tournaments is a huge help to the players. ”Raju said Krishna’s leadership was the key.“Not only in Karnataka but tennis in India was routed through SM Krishna. There was an opportunity to host the ATP World Doubles Championship and within a month of his election as the President of KSLTA in 1999-2000, he promptly said, “Yes.” India was the last venue to host an independent ATP World Doubles Championship.”The KSLTA followed up the World Doubles Championship with an assembly of international events – including the Legends Tour that brought the incomparable Bjorn Borg to the city, and WTA tournaments that saw American rockstar pros Serena and Venus Williams grace the Cubbon Park facility.It is only fitting that the KSLTA will have an additional state-of-the-art facility in the next five years. Located in Yelahanka, 20km from the Cubbon Park set-up, the new stadium will be on a seven-acre plot. The plan is two have two show courts and 12-14 additional all-weather courts.“We want to make it a facility that will host a couple of Tour-level events in a year, along with Challengers and Futures tournaments,” Yajaman said, “Most of all, we hope that it will serve as a tennis hub for Indian players.”Making Bengaluru a base for tennis in the country would, perhaps, be the best way to thank SM Krishna for his leadership, underscoring his love for the sport with more of the same emotion.",Krishna was president of Karnataka State Lawn Tennis Association from 1999 to 2019. He helped shift gears and move the game along into the new millennium in his two-decade tenure as president of the state body.

A chaotic outing for sure!Roll got the opportunity to host the Wednesday episode along with Orton, after which the duo recapped Saturday Night’s Main Event, where the 14-time world champion was able to take out McIntyre with Roll in his corner. This is when McIntyre interrupted them and tackled Orton through the show’s swinging doors.The Grammy-winning artist attempted to de-escalate the situation by calling for a commercial, but was interrupted by Paul. The former United States Champion quickly got into Roll’s face and slapped him as hard as he could. After holding his face for a while, Roll bounced back with a thunderous chokeslam through the talk show desk.This isn’t the first time that Roll has had a physical altercation with a WWE star. In fact, the country music star appeared at SummerSlam last year and hit Austin Theory with a chokeslam in the middle of the ring.

They come in and they go 'Hey, we just want to watch for a minute. Just kind of chill. Is that cool?' I was like 'Yeah, for sure!' This is who he is as a human. The entire three-hour session, him and his wife stood on those ropes and just gave me pointer after pointer.”The country music star added, “Kevin Owens, Jacob Fatu came in and wrestled with me the other day for like three or four hours. These dudes are pouring into me because they see that I'm trying to take it as seriously as I can.""Also read: WWE: Unreal is ready to pull back the curtain on the world of wrestling with its newest docuseries",Jelly Roll will make his in-ring debut at the first-ever 2-night SummerSlam PLE in August later this year.

Bronny James catches fire late but can’t erase early damage



Boston Celtics ride Jordan Walsh, Kenneth Lofton Jr. to comfortable victory



The Los Angeles Lakers' slow second quarter, injuries worsen Vegas woes



The Boston Celtics put an emphatic stamp on their 2025 Las Vegas Summer League campaign with a controlled 87-78 win over the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday night. While Bronny James lit up the second half with a game-high 18 points, his performance was heavily shadowed by a staggering eight turnovers and a scoreless opening half. For the Lakers, it marked their third Summer League loss, with James’ flashes of brilliance again weighed down by inconsistency.Bronny James looked disjointed through the first half, struggling to find his rhythm and coughing up six turnovers before the break. The Lakers held a 26-21 lead after the first quarter, but their offense collapsed in the second. They went nearly seven minutes without a field goal and scored just nine points in the period, allowing Boston to flip the game’s momentum with a 16-0 run.James, however, came to life in the second half. The 6-foot-2 guard dazzled the Vegas crowd with a Euro step past Kenneth Lofton Jr., a slick ""jelly"" finish through contact, and a corner three. His final bucket came off an offensive rebound, completing a much-needed bounce-back half. He finished with 18 points, 5 assists, 3 rebounds, 1 steal, and 8 turnovers.The Celtics, now 3-1 in Vegas, showed their rising talent with a sharp two-way effort.Jordan Walsh returned from a previous ejection to post 17 points on 6-of-11 shooting, adding 4 rebounds and 2 steals. His third-quarter dunk off a jump ball and a showtime windmill slam off an inbound sealed the momentum swing Boston needed.Kenneth Lofton Jr. dominated the paint with 12 points, 7 rebounds, and 5 assists. Hugo Gonzalez chipped in 13 points and 5 boards, drilling corner threes and showing improved decision-making.Even with Charles Bassey absent, Amari Williams and Miles Norris filled the void with solid contributions, rounding out a balanced Celtics attack that exploited the Lakers’ defensive lapses and turnover-prone backcourt.Los Angeles opened strong, but their collapse in the second quarter, marked by turnovers, misfires, and a lack of urgency, proved fatal. DJ Steward’s 14 points and Cole Swider’s 12 offered some resistance, but the Lakers could never fully recover from the Celtics’ surge. Christian Koloko stood out with 12 points, 5 rebounds, and 6 blocks, offering a defensive silver lining.The night also took a toll physically. Darius Bazley exited the game in a wheelchair after a knee injury in the second quarter, ending his night with 8 points and 4 boards. Dalton Knecht’s shooting slump continued, going 3-for-12 and just 1-for-6 from deep.Also Read: Houston Rockets vs Portland Trail Blazers (07/17): Box score, player stats, game summary and more Despite Bronny James showing offensive strides, the Lakers’ inability to control tempo or value possessions left them outmatched.

Kyle Schwarber hits three monster home runs to erase American League lead

Poll Should the swing-off format be adopted in regular-season extra innings? Yes, definitely! No, keep it traditional.

Fans celebrates Kyle Schwarber’s MVP moment on social media

Philadelphia Phillies star Kyle Schwarber made a name for himself at the 2025 MLB All-Star Game, becoming the first Phillies player to win the Ted Williams All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award presented by Chevrolet since Johnny Callison back in 1964. In a tense 7-6 triumph for the National League over the American League, Schwarber’s remarkable showing in the game’s first swing-off tiebreaker locked in the win and earned him the esteemed MVP accolade.In the regular game, Schwarber was 0-for-2 with a walk, but he really shined during the swing-off. Chosen by National League manager Dave Roberts from the Los Angeles Dodgers, Schwarber took on pitches from Dodgers' third-base coach Dino Ebel. The American League jumped ahead early in the swing-off, with Brent Rooker, Kyle Stowers, and Randy Arozarena hitting three home runs, making the score 3-1 for the AL.Then came Schwarber's moment. With the fans roaring and his teammates cheering him on, he stepped up and put on a stunning display. Schwarber hit three back-to-back home runs on his three swings, measuring 428 feet, 461 feet, and 382 feet, flipping the score to 4-3 in favor of the National League.""It was incredible,"" Schwarber said to reporters. “The guys were really into it. They were yelling, screaming, cheering me on every swing. When that last one goes over, they were all pumped. It was a lot of fun.”Jonathan Aranda, the final batter for the American League and a player for the Tampa Bay Rays, was unable to match Schwarber's hitting power, missing out on a home run. Meanwhile, Pete Alonso, who was supposed to bat next for the National League, didn't even need to step up to the plate—the game had already ended, and Schwarber had taken the victory.Philadelphia Phillies fans gave all sorts of reaction to their start winning the MVP spot and commented on X, “The MVP crown fits Kyle Schwarber perfectly after that SCHWARBOMB. 👑💣” The Phillies’ official X account echoed the sentiment: “KYLE SCHWARBER IS THE 2025 MLB ALL-STAR GAME MVP! #RingTheBell.”Fans and analysts alike lauded the swing-off format’s debut. One X user wrote, “We needed this swing-off format a decade ago,” while another called it “ELECTRIC.”MLB’s official X account joined in, posting, “The 1st Swing-Off in All-Star Game history was ELECTRIC. Great job, baseball 👏.” While another user commented saying, ""With the MLB's new swing-off format debuting in the 2025 All-Star Game after a 6-6 tie, it’s clear they’ve officially turned the midsummer classic into a home run derby audition""The format’s success has sparked discussions about adopting it in regular-season extra innings, with one fan pleading, “Dear Rob Manfred, replace the ghost runner in extras with a home run swing-off.

Luka Doncic might walk from the Los Angeles Lakers and it all started with how they treated LeBron James,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/luka-doncic-might-walk-from-the-los-angeles-lakers-and-it-all-started-with-how-they-treated-lebron-james/articleshow/122589519.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Luka Doncic could walk away in 2026 and leave the Los Angeles Lakers

Luka Doncic could rethink after watching the Los Angeles Lakers moving past LeBron James

It looks like the Los Angeles Lakers could be on the verge of losing one of their top talents — Luka Doncic. Rumors are flying that the Slovenian superstar might bail on the team, and this possible exit seems linked to the way the Lakers have managed LeBron James , a legend whose treatment has caused some tension in the organization.Luka Doncic, a remarkable talent hailing from Slovenia, is currently facing a significant moment with the Lakers. He’s in the fourth year of a five-year, $215 million deal that he inked in [insert year], featuring a player option for the 2025-26 season. This means Doncic could potentially become a free agent as early as next summer if he chooses to opt out and forgo an extension.Starting August 2, 2025, Doncic will be eligible to sign a huge four-year, $229 million extension that would keep him with the Lakers until the end of the 2029-30 season. But earlier this offseason, ESPN’s Bobby Marks had a different perspective. He suggested that Doncic might opt for a shorter, three-year contract instead. Why would he do that? This strategy would allow him to renegotiate a year sooner, with 10 years of NBA experience under his belt—a key milestone that raises the maximum contract limit. Marks provided this analysis in an ESPN piece, emphasizing Doncic’s tactical choices.If Doncic decides not to take the extension at all, he might play through the 2025-26 season and then explore free agency next summer. ESPN’s Brian Windhorst highlighted the importance of this — “This is a stress max right now for Luka. The Lakers are a little bit stressed out about it. If he signs it, relief for the Lakers. … If he does not sign it, he can be a free agent next summer when there are going to be 10-plus teams with cap space.” Windhorst pointed out that various teams in the league are going to start making moves to go after Doncic, which puts more pressure on Los Angeles to keep him content.At the center of this drama is LeBron James, the Lakers' seasoned superstar since 2018. James is in the last year of his contract and will be turning 41 in 2025. The Lakers' management has indicated a move towards a future focused on younger players—specifically Doncic. This change, however, has sparked debate about the way James is being treated.Fox Sports’ Nick Wright pointed to this tension on July 16, suggesting the Lakers’ actions could be alienating Doncic. “I think the way the Lakers are not so subtly dissing LeBron James about how excited they are to be done with [him] — I can’t imagine Luka is happy about that,” Wright said on his show. He argued that the franchise’s apparent eagerness to move on from James, a mentor and teammate to Doncic, might erode the younger star’s trust in the organization. Posts on X, like one from [insert handle], echo this sentiment, noting, “LeBron James feels sidelined as Lakers prioritize Luka Doncic in secret meeting amid trade rumors.”Following the Buss family's sale of the Los Angeles Lakers to Mark Walter, the team is prioritizing Luka Doncic as their franchise star. Doncic can sign a 4-year, $229 million extension, while LeBron James' future remains uncertain as the Lakers manage cap space for 2026 signings. LeBron James wasn't aware about the deal between Buss family and Mark Walter but on the other Luka Doncic knew what was going on.LeBron James and Luka Doncic have a solid connection, with the veteran frequently mentoring the younger player both on and off the court. The Lakers not extending James' contract—or at least not giving him the respect that Wright thinks he should get—might be sending a signal to Doncic about how the team views its star players.Also Read: Jalen Williams plans retire his Parents after bagging the $287 million contract and championship season Keeping Doncic isn’t just about having a superstar on the team—it’s about safeguarding their legacy and staying competitive. To make this happen, they’ll have to fix some issues, starting with how they deal with James.","Luka Doncic is in the fourth year of a five-year, $215 million deal that he inked in [insert year], featuring a player option for the 2025-26 season.
