saptha pathi

Thirukkural

Book of Ethics

Book of Wealth

Book of Love

Those who have virtuous children, that none reproach, can escape from the touch of evil in the maze of seven births

Friends who wiped our tears will be fondly remembered all through our seven births.

One generation blessed with learning will benefit seven generations to come.

He who avoids deeds praised by the wise will be despised in seven births.

A fool may, in a single birth, create a hell he must endure for seven births.

He left only yesterday, yet it feels as if seven days have passed.

Thankkuvamai illadhaan thaal serndharkku allaal

Manakkavalai matral aridhu.

Unless you surrender to His feet, to whom none compare,

No anxiety of the mind can be removed.

There are numbers we count with, and then there are numbers we live with.The number seven belongs to the latter.It hums quietly in the background — seven swaras that shape every melody, seven colours of a rainbow, seven days that cradle a week. It shapes the wonders we marvel at, the seas we dream of crossing, and even the bones that hold our heads high.In Tirupati, the Lord resides on seven hills. In Christianity, the divine trinity and earthly elements together add upto seven. In Islam, pilgrims circle the Kaaba seven times. In Hindu weddings, seven steps —— bind the two souls for life. Even in unseen realms, there are seven heavens above and seven worlds below.Did Valluvar , too, feel the pull of this number? Seven is hidden, almost like a secret signature, in the very architecture of the. Each couplet is made up of exactly seven words. The epic itself has 133 chapters. 1 + 3 + 3 = 7. Total couplets: 1,330. Again, 1 + 3 + 3 + 0 = 7.The three divisions of the Kural whisper the same pattern.: 34 chapters. 3 + 4 = 7.: 70 chapters. 7 + 0 = 7.: 25 chapters. 2 + 5 = 7.This was no accident. Valluvar’s structure was his shield. In an age when poems were easily interpolated, he made sure no stray verse could slip into his work without disturbing the harmony of his sevens.Kural 62:Kural 107:Kural 398:Kural 538:Kural 835:And then there is the tender ache of separation. Kural 1269 and 1278 speak of a woman waiting for her lover:My favourite is the seventh couplet itself:Life is fragile. Nature rages, wars scar the earth, grief stalks the living, and we stumble, uncertain of our script. And yet, there is one moment of clarity: the moment of surrender.For in surrender, the burden shifts. I place my anxieties in His keeping and find myself free.Who am I, but a drop in the ocean of His kindness? And yet — a drop that belongs. Perhaps that is the true secret of seven: not that it completes the count, but that it reminds us we are already whole.The wheel turns again.Seven births, seven days, seven colours, seven notes;each cycle returning us to where we began, reminding us that wholeness is not reached at the end of the journey, but in every step along the circle of seven.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

Connor McDavid’s next deal could be historic, but it comes with conditions



Loyalty now, but exit still on the table



FAQs:



1. Why were Connor McDavid's contract talks delayed?

2. Is Connor McDavid committed to staying in Edmonton long-term?

3. What makes Connor McDavid’s next contract so significant?

After weeks of mounting speculation, Connor McDavid is reportedly ready to open contract discussions with the Edmonton Oilers. This long-anticipated move comes after a brief silence that sparked rumors of a possible exit. However, recent developments suggest the franchise’s cornerstone is still committed - for now. The reigning best player in the NHL may stay loyal to Edmonton, but the fine print of his next deal could shape the future of both McDavid and the team.Connor McDavid isn’t just negotiating any contract- he’s expected to ink a deal that would make him the highest-paid player in NHL history. NHL insider Frank Seravalli weighed in, noting, “I don’t think $20 million is unreasonable given what he provides and how significant of an impact he has as the best player in the world. If I were looking at the Connor McDavid situation, as best I can handicap it at this point in time, my guess is somewhere between $16 and $17.5 million in AAV. Those are just ballparks. That’s the best that I can glean at this moment in time.” Seravalli estimates the ballpark figure to be between $16 million and $17.5 million in average annual value (AAV).Yet, despite the optimism surrounding a massive contract, it’s not just about the money.McDavid is likely weighing more than just figures—he’s considering legacy. The Oilers have repeatedly fallen short of lifting the Stanley Cup, including a bitter playoff exit to the Florida Panthers last season. If that trend continues, the superstar’s patience might wear thin.While rumors about Connor McDavid potentially heading to the Toronto Maple Leafs made waves recently, those talks have cooled. He remains expected to sign an extension with Edmonton. However, Seravalli provided a warning rooted in McDavid’s immense leverage: “If he decides after four years or three years or whatever that the Edmonton Oilers aren’t getting it done...the best player in the world just raises his hand and says: ‘I want out. ’”This isn’t just hypothetical. McDavid has been eligible to extend his contract since July 1, but personal matters reportedly delayed the process. Now, discussions are finally set to commence—but for how long will Edmonton be enough? The specter of a late-career switch, especially to his hometown Maple Leafs, still looms.The Oilers need more than just a signature. They need to prove to McDavid that Edmonton is where champions are made. Because if the promise of the Stanley Cup continues to fade, even the most loyal star might look elsewhere for glory. However, no matter to what extent trade rumors appear, it is Connor McDavid, who will decide his future. Will he become the highest paid player in league? Fans and critics will be watching very closely.Contract discussions were delayed due to personal matters, but they are now expected to begin soon.He is expected to sign an extension, but could leave if the Oilers fail to deliver results in the coming years.His upcoming deal is projected to make him the highest-paid player in NHL history, reflecting his elite impact on the game.Also Read: Without Mitch Marner, can Auston Matthews still carry the Maple Leafs to a Stanley Cup?","Connor McDavid is reportedly ready to open contract discussions with the Edmonton Oilers.

Carter Hart and Hockey Canada Five NHL ban updates

Brian Lawton on Stan Bowman and Edmonton Oilers second chances

“Canada feels divided over this. Half think the players did something horrible, half think they were cleared and should move on with their lives.”





FAQs



Are the Edmonton Oilers interested in signing Carter Hart?

Why are Carter Hart and the Hockey Canada Five not allowed to play in the NHL?

Have the Edmonton Oilers given second chances to players before?

Carter Hart may not be getting a chance with the Edmonton Oilers. NHL insider Frank Seravalli said on July 28, 2025, that the team is not interested in signing the goalie. Hart and four other players were part of the Hockey Canada Five case. Although they were found not guilty in court, the NHL has said the five players cannot play for now. Seravalli called Hart a “non‑starter” for the Oilers and said the league will review the case before making a final decision.Justice Maria Sarroccia ruled last week in Ontario’s King’s Court that Carter Hart and four teammates were not guilty in the Hockey Canada Five case. The players had faced sexual assault charges from a 2018 incident in London, Ontario. The judge said the complainant, known as E.M., gave consent and that parts of her story were not credible.Despite the verdict, the NHL told teams the players remain ineligible to sign until the commissioner’s office finishes its review. Frank Seravalli discussed this on TSN in Toronto on July 28. On the same day, Bob Stauffer, who hosts the Oilers Now show in Edmonton, asked fans and guests if the Oilers should sign any of the cleared players.Stauffer has raised this question several times since the ruling.On July 29, Stauffer invited former NHL agent and GM Brian Lawton to the show. Lawton said,He added that the players may find it easier to sign with a U.S. team where hockey is less in the public eye.Also Read: Edmonton Oilers Face Uncertainty As Connor McDavid Eyes Short-Term NHL Contract Extension At Potential Record Salary The Oilers have a history of second chances. Last summer, Edmonton hired Stan Bowman as GM even though he had served a three‑year NHL suspension for mishandling a sexual assault case in Chicago in 2010. The team also signed players like Craig MacTavish, Zack Kassian, Evander Kane and Corey Perry when they faced serious problems. Many of those players rebuilt their careers and image in Edmonton.Now, with Carter Hart and the other four players, fans are wondering if the Oilers are changing their approach. NHL sources say the team has no current plans to sign any of them.Now, with Carter Hart and the others cleared in court but still banned by the NHL, fans wonder if Edmonton will stick to its history of second chances or shift course entirely.Despite past patterns of forgiveness, the Oilers appear cautious now. Public opinion, league pressure, and reputation risks may force a pause, suggesting this case marks a turning point for Edmonton.No, NHL insider Frank Seravalli said the Oilers have no plans to sign Carter Hart right now.The NHL has kept them ineligible until the commissioner’s office finishes its review of the 2018 case.Yes, the Oilers have signed players like Stan Bowman, Evander Kane, and Corey Perry after past issues.","Edmonton Oilers have a history of giving second chances to players.

Former NBA star Danilo Gallinari’s wife had a shocking encounter near the shore



Gallinari’s New Chapter Overshadowed



A tropical escape quickly turned traumatic for former NBA forward Danilo Gallinari and his pregnant wife, Eleonora Boi. The couple, who recently relocated to Puerto Rico ahead of Gallinari’s upcoming season with Vaqueros de Bayamón, found their beachside bliss interrupted by a frightening shark attack that left Boi hospitalized and recovering from surgery. Thankfully, both mother and unborn child are safe, though the emotional shock still lingers.On July 31, 39-year-old Eleonora Boi was swimming at Carolina Resort beach, a typically busy stretch of sand in Puerto Rico, when the unthinkable happened.

The real parallels:

Critical Differences: NBA vs. MLB Money Moves

Ownership, Power, and the LA Sports Landscape

The city of Los Angeles thrives on spectacle - whether it's Oscar night or the next blockbuster sports deal. And today, as the Lakers circlein franchise-shaping negotiations, all eyes are on them not just for the basketball but for how much this deal reminds the city of another record-breaking move:’s $700 million contract with the Dodgers. The stakes, stories, and showmanship are all here - making LA the epicenter of sports drama once again.Starting August 2, 2025, the Lakers are positioned to offer Luka Doncic a massive four-year, $229 million extension - the ultimate endorsement of his future as the face of the franchise in a post-LeBron James era. Insiders expect Doncic’s camp to pursue a three-year, $160.8 million extension with a player option, structuring it to maximize his earnings potential when he qualifies for an even bigger “supermax” contract down the road. This strategic approach isn’t just about the present - it’s Luka laying the groundwork for both flexibility and potential historical earnings.But Luka’s message to the Lakers is clear: win now, or else. The Slovenian superstar has made it known that every year he dons the purple and gold, he expects to chase championships, not just headlines. For LA, this is about more than numbers - it’s a legacy-defining moment, with title hopes and global relevance on the line.When Shohei Ohtani signed with the Dodgers in a jaw-dropping $700 million deal, it wasn’t just a baseball story - it rewrote the rules for how LA sports franchises approach superstardom. In fact, Lakers legends and current ownership haven’t shied from the comparison. Both Ohtani and Luka Doncic are global sensations: one ruled the baseball diamond, the other commands the hardwood, and each brings legions of fans from far beyond U.S. borders.- Global Superstar Status: Both arrived in LA as international megastars, carrying the weight of global expectations.- Franchise Changers: Their arrivals instantly shifted their teams’ outlooks from hopeful to championship-or-bust.- Business and Branding: Ohtani's deal was about more than his play - it was a seismic event for ticket sales, sponsorships, and turning the Dodgers into a worldwide brand. The Lakers anticipate a similar windfall with Doncic, given his marketability and reach.Even Dodgers management and cross-town sports figures have commented on the significance of these moves. The common thread: these deals aren’t just about winning now, but cementing LA teams as perennial world-stage contenders.While Ohtani’s $700 million contract made headlines for its size, the fine print was even more fascinating - most of his earnings are deferred, giving the Dodgers payroll flexibility baseball’s system allows. In contrast, the NBA’s hard salary cap means every cent the Lakers commit to Luka Doncic is tightly regulated. This means the Lakers’ front office must be even more creative to build a contending team around their new superstar, adding intrigue to every roster decision.The connection between these two stories runs even deeper. Dodgers owner Mark Walter is now also the majority owner of the Lakers , turning the city’s two most glamorous teams into sibling juggernauts under his financial stewardship. Social media has run wild with images of Ohtani in Lakers gear, and LA sports fans are awash in dreams of dual championships.From ownership suites to late-night TV segments, the negotiations for Luka have become as much about LA’s identity as the roster. Comments from managers to basketball legends highlight just how interwoven LA’s sports legacy has become - with Luka Doncic and Ohtani as the leading men.Signing Luka isn’t only a bet on basketball. It’s a declaration that the Lakers don’t just chase stars - they set the standard for how a global franchise is run. With Ohtani now in Dodgers blue and Doncic potentially in Lakers gold, LA is cultivating an era where the stakes - and the swagger - have never been higher.In Hollywood, spectacle is tradition. And as the parallels between Luka Doncic’s and Ohtani’s deals captivate fans, it’s clear these megastars aren’t just playing for championships - they’re playing for the history books, and for the city’s next great moment in the spotlight.Also read: LeBron James Shuts Down Doubters with Gym Selfies After Fresh Criticism of His 2020 NBA Title Because in LA, it’s never just about sports.

Why the Los Angeles Lakers Are Not Done Yet

The’ offseason revamp has addressed several key areas, but the franchise appears far from finished. With an eye on bolstering their frontcourt depth even further, the Lakers are reportedly monitoring the buyout market closely—particularly the situation surrounding two-timeof the Chicago Bulls According to a recent report by ClutchPoints’ Anthony Irwin, the Los Angeles Lakers are “closely monitoring” the situation involving Nikola Vucevic, who could become a buyout candidate later in the season.“This does leave a few interesting free agents still, not even including eventual buyout candidates like Chicago’s Nikola Vucevic. As they did with Smart, the Lakers are closely monitoring that situation.” — Anthony Irwin, ClutchPointsVucevic has been the subject of multiple trade rumors this offseason, yet no substantial interest has materialized. The Bulls, facing a roster that lacks clear direction, are now reportedly open to a midseason buyout if no trade suitors step forward.At 34, Nikola Vucevic remains a capable and highly versatile big man. Last season, he averaged:Despite his age, his ability to operate as both a traditional post player and a floor-spacer makes him a rare commodity. At 6’10”, Vucevic could thrive in a second-unit role, giving the Lakers offensive stability off the bench without disrupting Deandre Ayton’s position in the starting lineup.The Lakers have already made waves this offseason by acquiring Deandre Ayton and Marcus Smart. These moves filled some key gaps on the roster—interior presence and perimeter defense—but the frontcourt still lacks depth.Here’s how the rotation might look with Vucevic added:With Ayton’s game centered around athleticism and paint presence, Vucevic could complement the second unit by offering offensive versatility and shooting from the outside.One major hurdle in acquiring Vucevic lies in the Lakers’ limited financial flexibility. The team might only be able to offer him a veteran minimum contract, which may not be enough to compete with cap-rich franchises like the Golden State Warriors or the Detroit Pistons.Vucevic could opt for a larger role and more money elsewhere, making the Lakers’ pursuit somewhat uncertain despite their interest.The Western Conference remains stacked, and while the Lakers have improved, they’re not yet a lock for championship contention.

Hailee Steinfeld flexes her fitness grind in latest photos before Bills’ big year



Hailee Steinfeld embraces balance by letting go of guilt and finding joy in her wellness journey



While Josh Allen ramps up intensity in his second week of training camp with the Buffalo Bills, his wife Hailee Steinfeld is quietly building her own routine — one rooted not in football, but in fitness, mindfulness, and discipline. The Oscar-nominated actress, who stunned fans in three elegant gowns during their wedding weekend at the picturesque San Ysidro Ranch, has been making wellness a personal priority off the red carpet.Even with a demanding schedule, Hailee Steinfeld remains deeply committed to taking care of her body and mind. In her recent Beau Society newsletter, she described emerging from a whirlwind trip to New York City, yet still ensuring her workouts weren’t sacrificed. “I work out to stay fit, but it's almost the last reason I do it anymore,” she wrote candidly. “I love it because it's the only time of day that I can check out entirely. ”Her approach isn't simply about staying camera-ready — it’s about emotional resilience and self-care. The 28-year-old actress, who starred in Sinners, emphasized the mental clarity her workouts provide. “We often work out early so we finish before the rush of the day sets in.But I feel like I've gotten to that place where I move for my mental health.”Her commitment has been supported, both emotionally and physically, by her father Pete Steinfeld — a personal trainer and a key figure in her health journey. In Beau Society’s August 1 issue, titled “The Movement Issue,” Pete was interviewed, offering insight into their shared passion. Hailee wrote, “I never get tired of hearing my dad talk about the thing he loves most in this world: wellbeing.”The actress also opened up about her past struggles with body image and the guilt that used to accompany indulging in snacks with friends. That mindset has shifted with wisdom and time. “I don't do that anymore because I enjoy sweets and snacks, and the company,” she admitted. But a quote from her father helped anchor this change: “You can't change your body overnight, and you can't mess it up overnight either.”That philosophy — one of balance, consistency, and kindness toward oneself — now defines her outlook. As Josh Allen pursues greatness on the gridiron, Steinfeld is quietly setting her own example of strength: one that doesn’t always show up on a scoreboard, but matters just as much.Also Read: Deion Sanders kept his cancer battle quiet - Brett Favre calls him a true fighter after finding out: ""He's a grinder""","Hailee Steinfeld has been making wellness a personal priority off the red carpet.

Chris Jones- Life beyond the breakup



Kansas City Chiefs defensive star Chris Jones , known for his explosive presence on the field, is revealing a far more vulnerable side off it. Just months after a public and painful breakup with his longtime girlfriend Sheawna Weathersby, Jones appears to be yearning for something deeper than Super Bowl rings—companionship and love. During a lighthearted training camp interview, the 31-year-old defensive tackle shared a surprisingly heartfelt goal from his bucket list: “I just wanna be married, I just wanna be loved.”Jones’ tender revelation was posted on the Chiefs’ official TikTok account, drawing attention not just for its sincerity but also for its timing. The video surfaced four months after Weathersby’s Instagram post accused Jones of infidelity and confirmed their nine-year relationship had ended “months ago.”“I’m choosing to focus on the positive as I close this chapter on a 9-year relationship,” she wrote. “Ultimately Chris’ infidelity with the woman he’s recently been pictured with led to my decision to end our relationship months ago.”The alleged incident referenced was a now-deleted Instagram photo of Jones with a woman licking his face, which further fueled the breakup narrative. Jones never publicly addressed the accusations.However, he did declare his single status via a string of tweets back in January—just weeks before signing a mammoth five-year, $158.75 million contract extension that includes $101 million guaranteed.Weathersby’s post also described unsettling harassment from the other woman, claiming, “This is especially troubling given her history of harassment, stalking and disrespect towards me… This behavior has forced me to change my number and has forced Chris to ask her multiple times to please leave me alone and respect our coparenting dynamic.”Despite the personal upheaval, Jones continues to dominate on the field. Last season, he recorded 75 pressures, 29 quarterback hits, and 10.5 sacks—proving why he's a cornerstone of the Chiefs’ defense.Jones and Weathersby, who had been together since at least 2015, share two young children, 6-year-old Christopher and 2-year-old Carson. Weathersby was a familiar presence at games and developed close bonds with other Chiefs WAGs, including Taylor Swift , who is currently dating tight end Travis Kelce Now, with fame, fortune, and football already under his belt, Jones seems to be seeking something far more elusive—someone to stand beside him when the crowd fades and the lights go dim.Also Read: Who is Jimalita Tillman?

Rumors linking pop icon Katy Perry and former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have stirred a firestorm of controversy, drawing sharp criticism from ex-NHL player Jay Rosehill and even NFL star George Kittle. As celebrity culture and politics collide, public backlash and disturbing fan behavior are putting this narrative under fire.Former NHL player Jay Rosehill didn’t mince words when asked about the swirling rumors linking pop superstar Katy Perry and former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

No, you can't do that.No Rahul, we should not go that way.”But Rahul stood firm: “What do you want us to do? Just bat and ball and go home?”The umpire concluded the argument by saying, “We'll discuss that at the end of the match. You can't talk like that.”India were clearly fired up after lunch, and the tension on the field reflected their aggressive mindset.

Poll What did you think about the on-field exchange between Prasidh Krishna and Joe Root? It was just banter It was unprofessional It shows competitive spirit

India pacer Prasidh Krishna downplayed his on-field exchange with Joe Root, calling it “just good banter” after a fiery second day in the fifth and final Test at The Oval on Friday, where India clawed their way back into the contest thanks to an inspired bowling performance.Krishna, who returned to the playing XI, starred with figures of 4 for 62 as India bowled England out for 247, restricting their lead to just 23 runs after the hosts were cruising at 129/1. Mohammed Siraj also chipped in with 4 for 86, helping India take back control of a match they must win to level the series 2-2.Among the key moments was a heated exchange between Krishna and Root, who uncharacteristically had to be separated by the umpires. ""It was a small thing, a competitive edge. Good banter… we are good friends off the field,"" Krishna clarified at the end of play.Krishna also addressed questions about the absence of Jasprit Bumrah and his own role in the side. “Jasprit Bumrah playing or not playing… we know what our roles are,” he said. “I have been picked here because I can do the job. Me not playing games can make me go to the drawing board. Here to do the job for the team.It’s a process, not a performance for me.”England had earlier made a flying start, with Zak Crawley (64) and Ben Duckett (43) adding 92 in just 13 overs. But the momentum shifted quickly after Akash Deep dismissed Duckett.Root was eventually trapped lbw by Siraj for 29, while Krishna’s spell accounted for Crawley, Jamie Smith, and Overton in quick succession. Brook’s enterprising 53 ended when Siraj bowled him to wrap up the innings. Woakes, nursing a shoulder injury, did not bat.India ended the day at 75/2 in their second innings, leading by 52, with Yashasvi Jaiswal unbeaten on 51.","India pacer Prasidh Krishna downplays on-field exchange with Joe Root.

Poll What do you think is Mohammed Siraj's greatest attribute as a bowler? Skill and technique Heart and determination Fitness and stamina Tactical awareness

TimesofIndia.com in London: "" Mohammed Siraj has one muscle that's bigger than anyone else... his heart.""These were the words of Varun Aaron during commentary but these were the sentiments of everyone watching from the stands at The Oval or home. Another lion-hearted spell, another outing of honest effort and Mohammed Siraj showed why he continues to be a rare breed.It wasn't a spell where you would stand up and applaud a delivery for sheer skill or work of art. It wasn't a spell where the seam position after release would become muse for the photographers. And, it clearly wasn't a spell where the mischief from the pitch came to his support. It was, however, another spell from the maverick playing his fifth consecutive Test, which had intent written all over it.When he hits the rhythm, like he did during that eight-over burst post Lunch, he turns into a different beast and the ball behaves differently than it had done all day, even from the same spot. That extra effort, even in the fifth Test of the series where he has already sent down over 150 overs, is not just a reflection of his skill but a testament of his character, which he wears on his sleeve.Those three wickets in the second session ran through the opposition middle-order and allowed India to fight their way back into the game after a very ordinary start with the new ball.But the moment the ball lost its shine, the 31-year-old looked in far more control and kept pinging the right areas, and the effort took care of the rest.Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Jacob Bethell didn't survive the frentic period of play. While the first two were undone by sharp inward movement and those extra yards after pitching, Bethell had no clue about the inswinging yorker which trapped him right in front. That yorker was fired in his seventh straight over of the spell but he had his tail up and the spring in the stride continued for one more over before captain Shubman Gill got him off the attack.It was another unreal effort by the bowler who has given it his all in different conditions and situations throughout the series. He has been the workhorse for the Indian team in their second consecutive five-Test series and served another reminder of why he needs to be celebrated, and appreciated even more. Siraj is one player who shouldn't be judged on just wickets, strike-rate and other numerical readings.He puts his heart and soul every time he steps onto the field for the team, and there clearly are no half-measures. He had thanked the almighty for blessing him with good fitness but more than the blessings, it's his will, drive and energy which keeps him going. And kept him going on an overcast afternoon at The Oval. In a series where bowlers from both teams have been rotated, managed and preserved, Siraj has remained an exception who has run in hard every single time.The right-armer is a proper team man, captain's dream and opposition's nightmare as he doesn't give an inch as far as effort is concerned. There are off days, erratic spells, lack of rhythm but no dearth of intent. While others keep their biomechanics in check for these marathon outings, Siraj doesn't need to complicate. For him, it's all about putting his heart behind the ball every time he stands on top of the bowling mark. He has already done it on 932 occasions in the series, and looks ready to go all in one last time in the second essay.","Mohammed Siraj took three wickets in the second session of day two of the 5th Test against England at The Oval. Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Jacob Bethell didn't survive the frentic period of play.

After parting ways with star winger Mitch Marner in a blockbuster sign-and-trade with the Vegas Golden Knights, the Toronto Maple Leafs find themselves in a period of transition. While they've added depth through trades, one name creating buzz is 2023 first-round pick Easton Cowan. The 19-year-old forward is determined to turn heads at training camp and stake his claim on the Leafs’ opening night roster.With Marner’s departure freeing up cap space and creating a void in Toronto’s top six, the Maple Leafs have retooled by acquiring Matias Maccelli, Nicolas Roy, and Dakota Joshua. But Cowan, the 28th overall pick in the 2023 NHL Draft could be the most intriguing addition to the offensive mix. Known for his speed, two-way play, and high-pressure performance, Cowan is expected to seriously challenge for a roster spot this fall.Cowan starred with the OHL’s London Knights, scoring 83 goals and 218 points in 168 games over three seasons. His playoff numbers were even more impressive: 94 points in 55 games, including key performances in two OHL championships and a Memorial Cup victory this past season. His coach, Dale Hunter, recently endorsed his NHL readiness on The FAN Morning Show, stating:Despite his standout junior résumé and growing confidence, Cowan faces an uphill battle. Toronto already has 14 forwards on one-way NHL deals for 2025–26, not including restricted free agent Nicholas Robertson, whose future with the team remains uncertain amid trade speculation.If Robertson stays, Cowan’s route to the NHL becomes narrower, but there could still be opportunities. He may need to outplay veterans like Calle Järnkrok or Michael Pezzetta to earn a bottom-six role, with the possibility of moving up the lineup as the season progresses. Cowan has publicly stated that he thrives under pressure and welcomes the challenge of high-stakes environments like Toronto.Easton Cowan’s NHL readiness is becoming hard to ignore. With a strong development camp and training camp ahead, he has the tools, confidence, and timing to make a serious push. As the Maple Leafs shift into a post-Marner era, Cowan’s rise could become one of the most compelling storylines of the season.Also Read: Connor McDavid contract update: Edmonton Oilers GM Stan Bowman ‘encouraged’ by early NHL extension talks with superstar forward","Easton Cowan was the 28th overall pick in the 2023 NHL Draft.

"""Micah wanna be an Eagle"": A.J. Brown’s comment blows up amid Micah Parsons and Cowboys fallout",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/micah-wanna-be-an-eagle-a-j-browns-comment-blows-up-amid-micah-parsons-and-cowboys-fallout/articleshow/123051564.cms,"(Image credits: IG/X)

A.J. Brown says Micah Parsons “wanna be an Eagle”and it might not be just talk



Million Dollaz Worth of Game

“Micah wanna be an Eagle. He loves Philly.”

Micah Parsons calls out Cowboys in emotional goodbye post, says he “no longer wants to be here”



“Unfortunately I no longer want to be here.”

Dez Bryant backs Parsons for standing his ground: “Much bigger than football”



“I respect that you are standing on business... What you are doing is much bigger than the game of football.”

Is Micah Parsons really headed to Philly? It’s not just a fantasy anymore



What started as a tense offseason for the Dallas Cowboys just took a spicy, NFC East-shaking turn and the Eagles might be the ones laughing. After Micah Parsons’ emotional statement blasting Cowboys management, Eagles star wideout A.J. Brown previous comment is making rounds on the internet.Now with Cowboys legend Dez Bryant backing Parsons and Parsons himself looking fed up with Dallas, fans are wondering, is this how the NFC’s biggest rivalry gets even more personal?On one of the episodes of thepodcast, A.J. Brown didn’t hold back. He said exactly what Philly fans wanted to hear:And here’s the thing, it actually makes a lot of sense. Parsons is a Pennsylvania native. He grew up in Harrisburg. He went to Penn State. His roots run deep in the Keystone State. With his Cowboys situation imploding, Philly might not just be a random name-drop, it might be a real possibility.And let’s not forget, Micah Parsons and A.J. Brown are both represented by powerhouse agents and are well aware of how public perception shapes career leverage. Brown saying that out loud? That’s not an accident.That’s a message.Micah Parsons posted a long, heartfelt note to Cowboys fans. In it, he made it clear: he’s tired of the front office drama, failed negotiations, and feeling like he’s risking everything for a team that won’t commit.He revealed that his agent reached out to the Cowboys multiple times to start contract talks and they were met with silence. No texts. No emails. No effort. Instead, Parsons says the team let media narratives spin while he stayed quiet, hoping something would get done.But now? He’s done being quiet.Cowboys legend Dez Bryant wasted no time chiming in. He reposted Micah’s statement and gave him full support:Translation: Dez knows how ugly things can get with the Cowboys front office. He’s been there. He sees Parsons not just as a player taking control, but as a new-generation athlete refusing to play the same games past stars did. The respect is real.Micah Parsons in midnight green would send shockwaves through the league. He’s one of the most explosive defenders in the NFL, and pairing him with that Eagles front seven would be terrifying for the rest of the NFC.While there’s no official trade talk (yet). Whether it’s posturing or a genuine shift, one thing is clear: the Cowboys-Eagles beef just got a whole lot more personal.Also read - Antonio Brown trolls Shannon Sharpe saying he now has less money than his OnlyFans accuser",A.J.

There is still no end in sight to the Jonathan Kuminga drama. However, he is now receiving some intriguing offers from the Golden State Warriors and the Sacramento Kings. Devin Carter, Dario Saric, and second-round choices were the initial reported offer from the Sacramento Kings, but it was not going to be enough. According to reports, Sacramento Kings now want the player for Malik Monk and a first-round pick.The initial offers for a Jonathan Kuminga sign-and-trade have not impressed the Golden State Warriors . However, the most fascinating offer so far has reportedly been made. The Sacramento Kings, on the other hand, are looking to add some young players to their squad.Now, he is the target of their attention. By giving the NBA player a big role and the opportunity to thrive in ways the Golden State Warriors haven't been able to, they think they can maximize his potential.Hence, the Sacramento Kings have made a fresh offer for Jonathan Kuminga's trade, according to Sam Amick of The Athletic. He recently said:“The Kings have offered Malik Monk and a lottery-protected 2030 first-round pick to the Warriors for Jonathan Kuminga. Unlike the Suns’ four-year, $90 million proposal, Sacramento is only offering Kuminga a three-year contract.”He continued:“As for the Kings, which last spoke with the Warriors earlier this week, team sources say they’ve offered a three-year, $63 million deal for Kuminga in a proposal that would send veteran guard Malik Monk and their 2030 first-round pick (lottery protected) to the Warriors…”He then concluded:“If that pick didn’t convey, then the Warriors would get the least favorable of the Kings or San Antonio’s first-round pick in 2031. Those protections have been the primary sticking point, team sources said, as the Warriors have insisted that the first-rounder be unprotected. Thus, the stalemate…”This is a substantial offer. When the Sacramento Kings first tried to trade for Jonathan Kuminga, they offered a far lesser package.

Fans praise Scheffler’s values as Brady gets dragged for preaching success at all costs

FAQs:

Q1: What advice did Tom Brady give to Scottie Scheffler?

Q2: What did Scottie Scheffler originally say?

Q3: How did fans react to the debate?

Tom Brady may be the undisputed GOAT on the football field, but when it comes to giving life advice? Let’s just say the Internet isn’t handing him a trophy. The seven-time Super Bowl champ recently offered some unsolicited wisdom to golf star Scottie Scheffler and it seriously backfired. In a now-viral moment, conservative sports commentator Jason Whitlock absolutely torched Brady’s remarks, calling them “elite idiocy” and suggesting Brady’s the last guy who should be preaching about family values.This all started with Scheffler humbly saying that if golf ever interfered with being a good husband or dad, he’d walk away from the game. Enter Brady, who interpreted that as a little too soft and tried to coach him into chasing greatness instead. Big mistake. Because fans and analysts alike weren’t buying what Brady was selling.On his “Change the Game” newsletter, Brady decided to drop a take about Scheffler’s viral family-first remarks. The quarterback praised the golfer’s humility but pushed back on the idea of quitting for family, saying:He followed it up with a line about how pursuing greatness is also how you provide for your family. But this Brady-branded wisdom didn’t exactly land the way he hoped, especially given his very public divorce from Gisele Bündchen, which was allegedly sparked by him un-retiring from football.Jason Whitlock did not hold back. On his YouTube, the outspoken host unleashed a savage takedown of Brady’s statement.On hispodcast, Jason Whitlock ripped into Brady’s advice to Scottie Scheffler, calling it out as hypocritical and lacking in self-awareness. He argued that Scheffler’s faith-first approach makes him a better role model than Brady, who once prioritized greatness over family.Social media quickly picked sides and Scheffler became the fan favorite. Many praised the golfer’s humility, saying it was refreshing to see a top athlete openly prioritize marriage and fatherhood over fame and legacy.Meanwhile, Brady got dragged. Critics said he should’ve just sat this one out, especially considering how his “greatness above all” mindset may have cost him a marriage. Some even said he’s still out of touch with where culture is heading where emotional intelligence, values, and faith are increasingly part of the conversation around masculinity.Tom Brady may have meant well, but his attempt to mentor Scottie Scheffler turned into a viral misstep. Fans aren’t canceling the GOAT, but they’re making it clear: today’s athletes are rewriting what greatness really looks like and it doesn’t always come with a ring.Brady told Scheffler that chasing greatness often comes with personal sacrifice and suggested not to abandon career success in favor of family balance.Scheffler said in an interview that if golf ever interfered with his ability to be a good husband or father, he would walk away from the sport without hesitation.Fans overwhelmingly supported Scheffler and criticized Brady for being out of touch. Many praised Scheffler for prioritizing faith and family.Also read - Shannon Sharpe officially out at ESPN just weeks after $50M sexual assault lawsuit settlement",Tom Brady gave unsolicited advice to golf star Scottie Scheffler.

Who is Sha'Carri Richardson’s boyfriend, Christian Coleman?



Christian Coleman’s girlfriend, Sha’Carri Richardson, arrested after airport altercation



As headlines swirl around Sha’Carri Richardson’s recent arrest, much attention has turned toward her boyfriend, fellow sprinter Christian Coleman. He has made his status in the sprinting world as a towering figure in American track and field. Coleman’s athletic prowess is undeniable. But who is the man at the center of this controversy, and what’s the context surrounding the incident that briefly rocked the world of elite sprinting?Christian Coleman is one of the fastest sprinters in the United States. The 29-year-old from Atlanta holds the world record in the 60 meters with an eye-watering time of 6.34 seconds, set in 2018. That mark remains untouched. He was also a key part of the U.S. 4x100m relay team that clocked 37.10 seconds in 2019, a national record.Though his name has sometimes flown under the radar compared to his flashier peers, Coleman’s speed off the blocks is widely regarded as the best in the sport. In the current 2025 season, he ran 10.06 in the 100m, not his personal best, but still enough to place him among the top-tier sprinters globally, currently ranked 11th in the world.His 100m PR is 9.76 seconds, which places him firmly in the all-time elite.But recent headlines haven’t focused on lane times or podium finishes. They’ve centered on something personal, even involving him.Sha’Carri Richardson, the reigning 100m world champion and Olympic gold medalist in the 4x100m relay, was arrested on Sunday at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. According to a police report, the 25-year-old got into an argument with Coleman, whom she’s been dating for two years. The officer claimed that surveillance footage showed Richardson shoving Coleman multiple times and throwing what appeared to be headphones as he attempted to walk away.The altercation was labeled a fourth-degree domestic violence assault, but the case was quickly cleared. Coleman reportedly refused to press charges and “declined to be a victim.”Despite the dramatic turn of events, both athletes were back on the track within days. Richardson posted her season-best time of 11.07 in the 100m prelims, while Coleman ran 10.08 in his heat.Though Richardson later withdrew from the 100m final — for which she already holds a bye into the World Championships — she has decided to run the 200m after initially saying she wouldn’t.In an interview after her heat, Richardson seemed unfazed. “Right now I’m cruising under the radar,” she said. “But when it’s time to hit — it’s gonna be a bang where y’all see my name.”Also Read: US sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson arrested after fight with boyfriend Christian Coleman at Seattle airport As for Christian Coleman, who kept his composure amid the unfolding media storm, this episode may have rattled the quiet consistency he’s known for.

Former Australian cricket captain Ricky Ponting criticised Indian pacer Akash Deep for his post-wicket gesture towards England's Ben Duckett during the fifth Test match at The Oval, stating he would have responded with physical aggression if faced with similar behaviour during his playing career.The incident occurred in the 13th over of England's innings when Akash Deep dismissed Duckett and subsequently wrapped his arm around the batter's shoulder with a smile.The dismissal came after Duckett had scored an aggressive 43 runs off 38 balls, including four boundaries and a six against Akash Deep. This was the fourth time Akash Deep had claimed Duckett's wicket in the series, but the first instance followed a period where the English batter had dominated the bowler.During a Sky Sports Lunch break show, presenter Ian Ward questioned Ponting about the incident, asking, ""I can think of a few batsmen down the years that would take umbrage at this, and I'm looking very much in your direction. That would have been a Ponting right hook, wouldn't it?""Ponting responded affirmatively, stating, ""Probably yeah, probably.""The former Australian captain later softened his stance, acknowledging Duckett's composed reaction to the incident.""Although I mean, when I saw it, I just thought they must have been mates or played against each other somewhere or together. I would like to have something like that. I mean, you don't see that every day, maybe in a local park game or not in a test match that's been played as fiercely as this series has been played. I love the way that Ben Duckett plays his cricket. I think I like him more now to not to be able to react to that,"" Ponting said.The incident was part of a dramatic second day at The Oval, where 16 wickets fell on a pitch with unpredictable bounce. India, starting at 204/6, were bowled out for 224.England's innings began explosively, reaching 92 runs in just 13 overs. However, they eventually collapsed to 247 all out, securing a narrow 23-run lead.By the end of the day's play, which was cut short due to bad light, India had reached 75-2, with Yashasvi Jaiswal scoring an unbeaten 51 off 49 balls despite being dropped twice.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers player Desmond Watson is in a very challenging position due to his weight. Here, July 2025, the team's training camp is already well under way in Tampa, Florida. At around 450 pounds, Desmond Watson is still not allowed to participate in team activities. You can almost feel how much he wants to play as he walks laps under the hot sun.

Natasha Archer has been by the Princess of Wales’s side since 2010. She selected outfits for overseas tours, was even on hand at the hospital for royal baby photo calls, ready with spare outfits and supplies and was promoted to Senior Private Executive Assistant in 2022. Last week Kensington Palace confirmed Archer, now 37, is leaving to start a private “luxury consultancy.”Soon after the news broke, Archer switched her long-private Instagram profile to public. Royal watchers noticed two quick moves. She stopped following Meghan Markle , the Duchess’s lifestyle label As Ever, and several friends in Meghan’s circle, including makeup artist Daniel Martin and polo player Delfina Blaquier.The timing set off fresh speculation because the royal family is quietly trying to ease tensions with the Sussexes. Palace sources say aides for King Charles and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex held an informal meeting in London this month to explore next steps toward better relations. Prince William’s team did not attend, leaving doubts about how far any thaw can go.Commentators see Archer’s “unfollow” spree as a public hint that fences remain unmended. The Blast, citing insider chatter, called the move a “controversial stunt” that risks undercutting reconciliation plans said to be backed by Princess Kate herself.People who have worked with Archer stress her loyalty to the Wales household. She received the Royal Victorian Order in 2019 for personal service and is married to royal photographer Chris Jackson. Friends say her new consultancy will advise private clients on travel logistics and event styling, skills honed during fifteen years on royal duty.Neither Kensington Palace nor the Sussex office has commented on the social-media changes. Online, opinions split quickly. Some see the unfollows as a harmless reset before Archer’s career move. Others view them as a subtle show of support for Kate during a sensitive phase in family diplomacy.What happens next will likely unfold off camera. Kate is said to be focused on her children’s summer break and on a fuller return to public engagements later in the year. Meghan remains in California, preparing for new launches under her As Ever brand. Behind the scenes, advisers on both sides are expected to keep talking, while Archer steps into private life with new clients and fewer royal handles in her feed.For royal watchers, the small click of an unfollow button has added one more twist to a story that shows no sign of fading from the spotlight.","Natasha Archer has been by the Princess of Wales’s side since 2010.

The catalogue entry refers to signs of restoration to tears in several places.Leighton met Gandhi when he visited London in 1931 to attend the Second Round Table Conference.At the time, Leighton was in a relationship with political journalist Henry Noel Brailsford, who was a passionate supporter of Indian Independence. It was through this connection that she was introduced to Gandhi and was one of the few artists admitted to Gandhi’s office to sit with him to sketch and paint him.In November 1931, Leighton showcased her portraits in an exhibition at the Albany Galleries in London.Journalist Winifred Holtby attended the opening and wrote: “The little man squats bare-headed, in his blanket, one finger raised, as it often is to emphasise a point, his lips parted for a word that is almost a smile… the statesman who knows just how to play on the psychology of friends and enemies alike.”","“Portrait of Mahatma Gandhi’ by British artist Clare Leighton sold for triple its estimate of £50,000-£70,000 (Rs 57 lakh to Rs 80 lakh) It was the top lot in the Travel and Exploration online sale and the first time this portrait has been sold at auction.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122542027,imgsize-22548,width-400,resizemode-4/122542027.jpg"

Former Nike chief executive John Donahoe has been appointed as Stanford University’s new athletic director, taking over from Bernard Muir, who stepped down earlier this year.Donahoe, a Stanford Business School alumnus, will officially assume the role on September 8, becoming the university’s eighth athletic director.“Stanford occupies a unique place in the national athletics landscape,” said school president Jon Levin in a statement, cited by AP.“We needed a distinctive leader — someone with the vision, judgment, and strategic acumen for a new era of college athletics, and with a deep appreciation for Stanford’s model of scholar-athlete excellence. John embodies these characteristics.”Donahoe led Nike as CEO from 2020 to 2024, following stints at several high-profile companies including ServiceNow and eBay. He also served as chair of the board at PayPal from 2015 to 2025, and spent nearly two decades at Bain & Company, where he rose to become the firm’s worldwide CEO.“Stanford has enormous strengths and enormous potential in a changing environment, including being the model for achieving both academic and athletic excellence at the highest levels,” Donahoe said. “I can’t wait to work in partnership with the Stanford team to build momentum for Stanford Athletics and ensure the best possible experiences for our student-athletes.”He takes charge of one of the most successful collegiate athletic programs in the United States. Stanford has won at least one NCAA title every year since 1976–77, racking up a record 137 NCAA team championships overall.However, under Muir’s tenure, the Cardinal struggled in marquee sports such as football and men’s basketball. In response, Stanford brought in former NFL and Stanford star Andrew Luck to serve as general manager of the football programme.The Cardinal are now looking to recover their footing on the gridiron. After reaching three Rose Bowls under former coach David Shaw early in Muir’s tenure, the team slumped. Shaw stepped down in 2022 following back-to-back 3–9 seasons. His successor, Troy Taylor, posted the same record in two consecutive years before being dismissed in March, following reports that he had been investigated twice over allegations of staff mistreatment. Frank Reich, a former NFL coach, was later appointed interim coach by Luck.Men’s basketball has also faltered, having missed the NCAA Tournament every year since 2013–14, Muir’s second season. Johnny Dawkins, head coach at the time, was dismissed in 2016 and succeeded by Jerod Haase, who never led the team to the tournament in his eight-year tenure. Kyle Smith, hired by Muir last March, guided the Cardinal to a 21–14 record, their best in a decade.On the women’s side, longtime head coach and Hall of Famer Tara VanDerveer retired last year. Kate Paye, appointed as her replacement, oversaw a difficult 16–15 season in which the team failed to qualify for the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1987.Muir also played a key role in navigating Stanford’s transition to the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), following the collapse of their former home, the Pac-12.","Former Nike chief executive John Donahoe has been appointed as Stanford University’s new athletic director.
