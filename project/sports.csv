Yuvraj Singh's video of him saying 'my father has mental issues' goes viral after Yograj Singh's tirades against MS Dhoni,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/yuvraj-singhs-video-of-him-saying-my-father-has-mental-issues-goes-viral-after-yograj-singhs-tirades-against-ms-dhoni/articleshow/113015214.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Yograj Singh , father of legendary all-rounder Yuvraj Singh , recently criticized MS Dhoni , accusing him of negatively impacting his son's cricket career. Yograj's remarks highlight a longstanding grievance, alleging that Dhoni's influence curtailed Yuvraj's career, despite his crucial contributions to Indian cricket, particularly in the 2007 T20 World Cup and the 2011 ODI World Cup under Dhoni's captaincy.After the recent remarks by Yograj, a video of his son Yuvraj has gone viral, in which the World Cup-winner was saying that his father has ‘mental issues'.Yuvraj, India's 2011 World Cup hero, expressed concern over his father's various statements, suggesting that his father has ""mental issues"" and is unwilling to accept it. Yuvraj made these comments during a podcast, signaling his discomfort with his father's persistent accusations.""I think my father has mental issues and he just doesn't want to accept it,"" Yuvraj had said in a podcast.Yuvraj's cricket career, spanning 17 years, was marked by significant achievements, including pivotal roles in India's victories in the 2007 T20 World Cup and 2011 ODI World Cup.However, after 2014, his appearances for the national team diminished, with his final international match being in 2017 against the West Indies. Yograj attributes this decline to Dhoni's influence on the team's selection decisions.In a recent interview on the Zee Switch YouTube channel, Yograj expressed his deep resentment towards Dhoni, stating: ""I won't forgive MS Dhoni. He should look at his face in the mirror. He is a very big cricketer, but what he has done against my son can never be forgiven in life. I have never forgiven anyone who has wronged me, and I never will, even if they are family. That man (MS Dhoni) destroyed my son's career, which could have lasted four to five more years.""Yuvraj is widely regarded as one of the most illustrious cricketers in Indian history, having amassed nearly 12,000 runs and scored 17 centuries in 402 matches across formats. His all-round performance in the 2011 World Cup, where he scored 362 runs at an average of 90.50 and took 15 wickets, earned him the Player of the Tournament award.","Yuvraj Singh's father Yograj has accused MS Dhoni of negatively impacting his son's cricket career.

Pegula secured a convincing victory with a score of 6-2, 6-4, advancing to her maiden Grand Slam semifinal.Playing on the iconic Arthur Ashe Stadium, the sixth-seeded Pegula showcased her prowess and determination.As she clinched the match point to secure the biggest win of her career, Pegula celebrated by throwing her hands into the air, much to the delight of the enthusiastic home crowd. This triumph marked her seventh appearance in a major quarterfinal.""I've been (to the quarters) so many freaking times - I just kept losing,"" she said. ""Finally I can say (I am a) semi-finalist.""Top-ranked Swiatek seemed to be struggling from the beginning of the match, dealing with difficulties in her serve and committing numerous unforced errors that benefited her opponent. The Polish star, who had pulled out of the Canadian Open last month due to exhaustion, made a total of 41 unforced errors throughout the encounter.Despite not having been broken since the tournament's first round, Swiatek lost serve in the opening game and once more in the third, with a double fault contributing to her struggles.In the second set, Pegula appeared to be in complete control, breaking Swiatek's serve again in the third game. However, the 2022 champion showed some resilience by breaking back with a well-executed forehand winner in the fourth game, hinting at a potential comeback.Pegula, determined to maintain her advantage, refused to let her opponent seize control. In the seventh game, which went to four deuces, she sustained the pressure from the baseline. Swiatek, visibly frustrated, struck her thigh after misdirecting a forehand on break point.As the final game began, Pegula found herself with a 40-0 lead. However, she required the support of the home crowd to secure the victory, as Swiatek showcased her skills with two impressive winners, refusing to concede easily.It was only when Swiatek's shot sailed beyond the line on match point that Pegula could finally revel in her hard-fought triumph.""Thank you to the crowd,"" she said. ""You carried me through the last game.""Pegula will be facing Karolina Muchova in the semis.

Draper won in straight sets, 6-3, 7-5, 6-2, becoming the first British man to reach the final four at Flushing Meadows since Andy Murray's triumph in 2012.In the other match on Arthur Ashe Stadium, Czech player Karolina Muchova overcame a ""bug"" to defeat Brazil's Beatriz Haddad Maia.The grueling nature of playing five rounds on New York's hard courts was evident, as all four players faced challenges related to injury or illness, causing delays in both matches.Despite the setbacks, Draper maintained his impressive form, remaining the only player in the tournament who has not dropped a set.""I think I played a solid match. I feel the best fitness-wise I've been in a long, long time and I think that's where Alex has sort of got me in the past,"" Draper was quoted by Reuters from his on-court interview. ""I also think he was struggling a little bit today with something, which may have helped me.""From the outset, De Minaur struggled to find his rhythm, committing numerous unforced errors while Draper's serve proved effective, resulting in an early break that set the course of the match.The second set saw a brief interruption as both players faced injury concerns. De Minaur, who had previously withdrawn from Wimbledon due to a hip injury, appeared to be moving uncomfortably, while Draper required a timeout to have his right thigh strapped.Upon resumption, De Minaur managed to break back and level the set at 4-4. However, Draper responded with a break in the 11th game and consolidated his advantage to establish a commanding 2-0 lead in the match.In the third set, Draper's impressive power and accuracy took their toll on De Minaur, ultimately leading to his fourth defeat in a Grand Slam quarter-final throughout his career.""The way he can spread the court, being a lefty and really move you around the court, it takes a toll on the body. Accumulation of matches takes a toll, as well,"" De Minaur said.Muchova, participating in just her sixth tournament since sustaining a wrist injury at the 2023 U.S. Open, advanced to the semifinals of the event for the second year in a row by defeating Haddad Maia 6-1, 6-4 in the early match of the day.In the first set, Muchova displayed excellent form, quickly establishing a 4-0 lead with a double break. She held her serve to love and despite Haddad Maia managing to get on the scoreboard, Muchova closed out the set on her own serve.Haddad Maia's performance improved in the second set, with both players trading breaks. Muchova, after receiving attention from the physio and doctor at her chair, held serve to reach 5-3. Taking advantage of new balls, she sealed the victory on serve with an ace.""I think I played good in the key points, meaning when I had a breakpoint or I was serving for a game, I always pulled out a good shot, I think,"" Muchova said. ""I'm happy that I managed it in two sets again.""""I'm fighting (a) bug a little bit. I'm a little sick. I hope it didn't disturb anyone,"" she said.Haddad Maia, who became the first woman from Brazil to reach the quarterfinals at the US Open since Maria Bueno accomplished the feat in 1968, needed medical attention near the end of her match due to apparent breathing difficulties.""In the night session, top seeded Iga Swiatek will look to reach her seventh Grand Slam semi-final as she takes on sixth seeded American Jessica Pegula, who has not advanced beyond a Grand Slam quarter-final in six tries.""","Jack Draper defeats Alex de Minaur in straight sets to reach US Open semi- finals.

Pakistan's continuous nosedive in world cricket and their first ever Test series defeat against Bangladesh has led to scathing criticism of both the players as well as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) by former players and fans alike, with ex-wicketkeeper Rashid Latif putting fingers on the role of individuals who have held the position of PCB chairman in the recent past.""Jitne bhi chairman aaye hain, woh tabah kar rahe hain last four years se (whoever became the chairman in the last four years has demolished Pakistan cricket),"" Latif said on his show 'Caught Behind'.Bangladesh's six-wicket victory in the second Test at Rawalpindi followed their 10-wicket triumph in the first match at the same venue. It earned the visitors a historic first ever Test series win over Pakistan, and the way they dominated a team they had never beaten before in red-ball cricket led to a lot of disappointment for the Pakistani experts and fans.""Who brought him (Shan Masood) as (Test) captain? Who removed Babar Azam (from captaincy)? Who divided the Paksitan team?"" Latif questioned.All these moves happened when Zaka Ashraf was the PCB chairman.""So what is he doing at this juncture? Giving interviews?"" Latif continued to put Ashraf under the scanner.Doubts are being raised if the team is united at all, especially after the captaincy fiasco that saw Babar being removed as skipper after the ODI World Cup, Shaheen Shah Afridi's appointment lasting just one series and Masood's elevation to Test captaincy.Babar returned as captain for the T20 World Cup, but the team failed miserabaly, bowing out in the group stage of the tournament.""There were no differences between Babar Azam or Shaheen even after I decided to have the latter as the T20 captain,"" Ashraf claimed in his latest interview with a local Pakistan channel. ""No, the unity didn't end (after removing Babar as captain). In fact, the unity improved. When we told him to play as a player, which is his talent, but as a captain his performance is not good, he agreed.”Despite the team's poor show across formats under various captains, Ashraf refused to admit that swapping captains was a mistake.""He (Masood) was a very good captain. He is still a very good player. He is still a captain in England's counties. And, I made Shaheen Shah the captain of the T20I team. That was also a very good decision,"" Ashraf further said.""Team banana kis ka kaam hai. Zaka Ashraf ka ya Misbah ka? (whose responsibility is it to make the team - Ashraf or Misbah's)"" said Latif, questioning the role of former captain, coach and chief selector Misbah-ul-Haq who returned to PCB as advisor to Ashraf and also headed a cricket committee.""When he (Ashraf) was doing everything, making team and appointing captains, who is he blaming then - Babar?"" Latif further said. ""You forcibly made Babar resign. The team started disintegrating from there itself. It was you who made Shan the captain for your own benefit, to break the team. So your team is broken now.""The victory for Bangladesh, which once again brought the knives out in Pakistan, was significant for the fact that the visitors could come back from being 26 for 6 in their first innings of the second Test and limit Pakistan's first-innings lead to mere 12 runs.It inspired their rookie pacers Hasan Mahmud and Nahid Rana, who combined to take nine wickets between them and bowl out the hosts for 172, which set the visitors a target of 185 to win. They achieved it with ease on the final day of the match.""Those who did the damage and left, how will they be held accountable? Chairman-ship should never be honorary. These guys are not audited. It should be written in the (PCB) Constitution that you (chairman) can't appoint a captain, can't form a selection committee,"" Latif continued.""You have given the entire power into the hands of a chairman. They know nothing about cricket.""Mohsin Naqvi is the curent chairman of the PCB. He was appointed in February 2024.",Bangladesh beat Pakistan by six wickets in the second Test at Rawalpindi. It was the visitors' first ever Test series win over Pakistan in red-ball cricket.

Jadhav ends 5th in shot put

Archer Pooja's campaign ends in quarters

NEW DELHI: India achieved its best ever medal haul in the Paralympics , surpassing the previous edition's tally, thanks to an outstanding performance by its track and field athletes in Paris on Tuesday.India's medal count rose to 20, including 3 golds, 7 silvers, and 10 bronzes, breaking the previous record of 19 medals set at the Tokyo Paralympic Games three years ago.On a remarkable day for Indian para sports, the country secured five medals, bringing the total to 20 and placing India at the 17th spot by the end of day six of the quadrennial event. The impressive performance included two silver medals and three bronze medals in track and field events.India had achieved five golds, eight silvers, and six bronzes at the Tokyo Paralympics. This year, the javelin throwers stood out, with Ajeet Singh and world record holder Sundar Singh Gurjar winning silver and bronze, respectively, in the F46 category with throws of 65.62m and 64.96m. The F46 category is designated for field athletes with moderately affected movement in one or both arms or the absence of limbs.High jumpers Sharad Kumar and Tokyo Paralympics gold medallist Mariyappan Thangavelu each gave commendable performances, earning silver and bronze in the T63 finals with jumps of 1.88m and 1.85m. The T63 category is for high jumpers with moderately affected movement in one leg or the absence of limbs above the knee.World champion sprinter Deepthi Jeevanji added to India's medal tally with a bronze in the women's 400m (T20) event. The 20-year-old clocked 55.82 seconds, finishing behind Yuliia Shuliar (55.16 seconds) of Ukraine and world record holder Aysel Onder (55.23 seconds) of Turkey. It was Jeevanji’s debut at the Paralympic Games.Daughter of farm laborers from Kalleda Village in Telangana's Warangal district, Jeevanji was identified with intellectual impairment by a teacher at a school athletics meet. Despite facing societal challenges due to her disability, she achieved significant milestones, including a gold medal at last year's Asian Para Games and setting a world record at the Para World Championships in May.The T20 category is intended for athletes with intellectual impairments. Jeevanji benefited from the guidance of national badminton coach Pullela Gopichand after starting her training with her initial coach, Nagpuri Ramesh.Shooter Avani Lekhara missed out on another medal at the Games, finishing fifth in the women's 50m rifle 3 positions SH1 competition in Chateauroux. The 22-year-old, who has been paralysed waist-down since age 11 due to a car accident, shot a total of 420.6 across the three stages of kneeling, prone, and standing in a highly competitive eight-woman field.Despite not securing another medal, Lekhara has reason to celebrate. She recently made history as the first Indian woman to win consecutive gold medals at the Paralympics, following her top finish in the 10m air rifle competition last week.In the women's 50m rifle 3 positions SH1 competition, Germany's Natascha Hiltrop won the gold with a total score of 456.5.

Pakistan lost both Tests, with a 10-wicket defeat in the first match and a six-wicket loss in the second, marking their first-ever Test defeats to this opposition.Masood has faced criticism for both his leadership and scoring only 105 runs in four innings, extending his losing streak to five Tests as skipper.At a post-match press conference, Gillespie asserted that the team's performance, rather than Masood's leadership, was the issue. ""Shan, I feel, has led the side very well. We just haven't played well as a team and that's the reality. We need to sharpen up on certain areas and we will sharpen up. I want to back and believe in these players, they are good enough,"" he stated.Masood responded to the criticism, emphasizing his commitment to long-term improvement. ""I am not worried for my job security. I took this job to make the changes we believe will help this team.

""There was a very good Indian spinner who was making a comeback after he was dropped from the previous tour.""Javed was psychologically a very strong player. He knew that this bowler could prove dangerous on that pitch, which was turning a lot. So he thought of making the bowler a bit nervous, which could benefit him and his team,"" he added, without revealing the name of the bowler.Miandad, who fashioned many victories for Pakistan during his legendary 124-Test career, was known for his aggression and knack of getting under the skin of the opposition.Gavaskar continued.""Javed would defend the ball and when the ball rolled back towards the bowler, he would ask: 'Eh, tera room number kya hai, room number? (wht is your room number)'. Every other ball, he would do the same and ask the bowler the weird question,"" said the former India skipper, imitating Miandad's lisping.During those days, Syed Kirmani used to be India's wicketkeeper, while Gavaskar accompanied him behind the wickets as a slip fielder.""Kirmani looked at this happening and asked me, 'Yeh kya ho raha hai?

I replied, 'Kiri, Javed ne shuru kiya hai, Javed hi khatam karega, hum thoda intezar karenge (Javed has started this, he will finish it, let's wait),"" Gavaskar narrated.""The bowler eventually got frustrated and asked Javed, 'Kyu, room number kyu chahiye?

"Duleep Trophy: Performance, the focal point",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/duleep-trophy-performance-the-focal-point/articleshow/113079124.cms,"Season opener will be more about individual brilliance than team spirit

BENGALURU: Rarely has a domestic tournament stoked interest in India in recent times. But the focus on the season opener - the Duleep Trophy -is hardly surprising, given the high stakes. Between September 19 and January 7, 2025, India will play five Test matches at home and an equal number-all in Australia -away.At the beginning of the Test run, the slots up for grabs in the Indian squad are few and far between -a middle-order slot here, a toss-up between wicketkeepers there, and a couple of backups.But the World Test Championship is gruelling. Ten Test matches spread over 117 days, two countries and varied venues is bound to be taxing on the players. Hence, it is imperative that head coach Gautam Gambhir and the think-tank look at a strengthened bench.Across two venues in Bengaluru and Anantapur, four star-studded teams will vie for the prestigious trophy but with an eye on the bigger prize - a Test call-up or a return to the Test side.While the fringe players will look to stake claim for a place on the bench, there are plenty of others who will want to move from their position of being contenders to the 11 who walk out after the toss. KL Rahul is one such player. The 32-year-old, who returned to national duty in the One-Day International series in Sri Lanka last month, will eye a middle-order slot with Sarfaraz Khan and Devdutt Padikkal in the mix.While the youngsters' experience is not a patch on the 50 Tests matches Rahul has played, Sarfaraz and Padikkal have given a good account of themselves in their short red-ball international careers. Not to forget the likes of Shreyas Iyer, out of favour during the England series at home earlier in the year but with experience under his belt. Rishabh Pant may well stroll into the team with his skills behind the wickets. The 26-year-old last played a Test in December 2022 in Bangladesh before being involved in the ill-fated road accident. In his absence, KS Bharat, Ishan Kishan and Dhruv Jurel have held fort. Kishan, who was to feature in India 'D', will miss the opening-round due to a hamstring niggle.The assembly line of spinners will be keenly watched. While R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav are the flavour, especially at home, Axar Patel has been the first-choice replacement in the past. But Washington Sundar, Sai Kishore, Saurabh Kumar and rookie Manav Suthar will be keen to make a statement of intent. Also on offer will be a gamut of pace bowling option.Karnataka's Prasidh Krishna is out of the race for now. He will miss the first match for India A as he is still recovering from injury. Also, there is no clarity on the availability of Nitish Reddy (India B), who was picked subject to fitness clearance.Two youngsters - Shubhman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal- pitted in opposite teams offer an interesting subplot as India A face India B at the M Chinnaswamy stadium here from Thursday. Both have made impressive contributions in their blooming Test cricket careers but are yet to come out of the shadow of the illustrious batters around them. This fact is hardly lost on Gill, the India A skipper.""I've not been up to my own expectations,"" he said on Wednesday. ""But we have ten Tests coming up. Hopefully, after these Tests, I'll be up to my expectations or more.""Jaiswal, 22, who is set to continue opening alongside skipper Rohit Sharma, said: ""I'm working hard at the nets. It's not about setting personal goals. You have to be consistent and keep working on your skills. Domestic tournaments are very important games, they give me a lot of confidence and help me prepare for the international games.""",The Duleep Trophy is India's season opener.

Travis Head slays Scotland in rapid Australia T20I win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/travis-head-slays-scotland-in-rapid-australia-t20i-win/articleshow/113071583.cms,"NEW DELHI: Australia delivered a dominant performance in their T20 international against Scotland at Edinburgh, chasing down the target of 156 in a mere 9.4 overs. The victory was fueled by a record-breaking opening partnership and a relentless display of power hitting.Travis Head emerged as the star of the show, smashing a blistering 80 runs off just 25 deliveries.His innings was a masterclass in aggressive batting, peppered with five sixes and twelve fours.Head's onslaught, coupled with captain Mitchell Marsh 's rapid 30 off 11 balls, propelled Australia to an unprecedented 113/1 in the powerplay, setting a new T20 international record for the highest score in the first six overs.The chase began with a minor hiccup as opener Jake Fraser-McGurk was dismissed for a golden duck in the first over.However, this proved to be a minor blip in Australia's otherwise flawless performance.

Stokes believes that having McCullum at the helm across all formats will benefit the team and help maintain consistency in their approach to the game.""I think it's an unbelievable move for English cricket to go back to having one coach in charge of all the teams.

""We've seen the impact he's had on us as a Test team and as individuals, which I think he can then transfer into the white-ball stuff as well. He brings the best out of each other.

They will be able to prove themselves. Of course there will be mistakes but chances need to be given.”Interestingly, ISL has taken steps this year to make sure Indian coaches get their due share of importance. As per the new ISL rules, all teams must have an Indian assistant coach, holding the AFC Pro License (or equivalent) and if the head coach is relieved from his position or suspended, the Indian assistant coach will take over all the duties of the head coach.While many Indians have been caretaker head coaches of several ISL teams over the years, only Thanboi Singto is the other Indian who has been the head coach in the tournament last season and will continue to guide Hyderabad FC this season too.As for Khalid, he was more than pleased with the fact that he has been given the huge responsibility and is now looking forward to begin the season on a high away at FC Goa on Sept 17.“Pressure will be there.

But Jamshedpur’s Spanish recruit Javier Siverio believes a top-six finish is possible.“To get to the playoffs we have to play our game and do what the coach wants.

Also, Lobera is a great coach who has worked well with many players and teams in the past, so I hope this will be a great learning curve for me under him.”A player who can play both as a centre forward and a winger, Ali, however, left it to his new coach to decide his new playing position.“I love to play as a forward but I am comfortable playing at both positions.

HYDERABAD: Manolo Marquez 's journey as the national team coach began on a drab note as defending champions India were held to a goalless draw in the opening fixture of the Intercontinental Cup at the GMC Balayogi Stadium on Tuesday. Lower-ranked Mauritius proved a tough nut to crack.India, ranked 124th against Mauritius', ranked 179, were expected to coast home but the absence of a now-retired Sunil Chhetri was never so badly felt.Despite coming close to finding the goal through Nandha Kumar, Liston Colaco, Aniridh Thapa and others on different occasions, the hosts faltered when it came to the finishing touch. Mauritius came out a much happier side at the end. Marquez will have plenty on his plate when India take on Syria next on Sept 9.Mauritius started on a positive note by making their way into the Indian box in the very first minute before captain Rahul Bheke cleared it in front of goalkeeper Amrinder Singh. India looked rusty to start with but once they settled in, they started creating chances. Sana Singh nearly headed home Anirudh Thapa's corner in the sixth minute.Colaco and Asish Rai tried to find their way through the rival defence but without success. Lallianzuala Chhangte and Anirudh Thapa too made a few runs in vain.The visitors had a clear chance in the 37th minute when Emmanuel Rudy Vincent Jean caught the Indian defence off-guard and took the shot at the post from the edge of the penalty box. But the shot hit the top of the goalpost.Marquez substituted midfielders Colaco and Thapa with Nandha Kumar and Sahal Abdul Samad at the half-time. Chhangte made an impressive solo run along the right flank before his shot was cleared. Nandha's inclusion provided pace on the left flank with a few solo runs but the Mauritius' defenders Jean Jordan Rayenne Francois and Dylan Joao Raymond Collard were up to the task. Indians tried hard to break the deadlock in the final minutes but in vain.Marquez termed it a fair result. ""They didn't give us too many chances. We finished very tired. It is clear that we didn't train. It is a good game in terms of not conceding a goal and I am happy with the effort of the players. We can't play worse than this,"" he said.""We know that Indian players have a problem when it comes to physicality. We need to keep going. We need to improve in all areas.

Asked what he would discuss if he meets the legendary footballer in the future, Monteiro replied: ""I will ask him how he feels being a father, the roles we have are different compared to the last time we met.

Moments later, another opportunity arose for Mauritius, but Jay Shah managed to clear the danger.Mauritius, with their aggressive style, appeared more threatening and generated more opportunities than the home team.In the 34th minute, Indian striker Manvir Singh received a through ball from Anirudh Thapa and struck it with his left foot, but Mauritius goalkeeper Kevin Obrian made a critical save.India also had some near-misses.

takes on former champ

Medvedev

in QF blockbuster

The Jannik Sinner-Daniil Medvedev US Open lasteight clash has Grand Slam final vibes. The sizzle and storyline of a heavyweight title bout. Mental muscle versus cerebral heft, power versus persistence, speed versus staying might. Reined in rockstar against a mercurial chess master. A box office draw.The world No.1 takes on the fifth seed in the match of the tournament.Sinner and Medvedev - among the top players in the men's draw on this surface, where speed is true and the bounce assured -have history, having already played 12 times.Medvedev leads the head-to-head 7-5, but that is because Sinner only managed to crack the 2021 US Open champion's dominance for the first time in their seventh meeting. The 23-year-old won five successive matches, topping the charge in the semifinals in Miami, where Sinner dropped just three games to the 28-year-old. Medvedev broke that run in July at Wimbledon , where he got the better of the Italian in five sets.Sinner, who has lost just five matches this year, has reached at least the quarterfinals at all four majors this season, becoming just the eighth men's singles player since 2000 to accomplish the feat. ""I will try to think more about Wimbledon than the Australian Open,"" Medvedev said, smiling. ""Against Jannik, we had some tough matches, we know each other's game, maybe I will try and surprise him.""Their play is not hugely different, given that they both like to dictate action from the baseline. The Italian is emphatic in his ball striking while Medvedev, lanky build and laconic style, looks at a strike here and a slap there, outthinking the opponent rather than outhitting him.Medvedev stands so far behind the baseline when returning serve, he might as well be positioned in Times Square, whereas Sinner is always looking to step in and take charge.The only two Grand Slam winners left in the draw, Sinner, winning in Melbourne Park in January, and Medvedev emerging triumphant at Arthur Ashe three years ago, are looking to add to their tally.Medvedev, who is 1-5 in Grand Slam finals, enjoys playing in New York, where he has wooed spectators after a salty exchange early in his run in 2019 when he made the final. Medvedev said, ""In tennis it's important to know that there is always a second chance."" The next week and the week after. ""It's important to continue pushing. Every week we practice, we push forward,"" he said. ""For me sometimes it's not easy. The tougher it becomes in your mind, usually the more matches you lose, the more tournaments you lose in a row. Like we saw some players after the Olympics, it's tough to push nonstop.""Medvedev, who has struggled with his shoulder early in the season, which resulted in a slower serve, has improved with every outing in New York. Sinner, who has looked set from the word go, scored a straight set 7-6, 7-6, 6-1 win over American Tommy Paul to make the last-eight stage.""I had those periods where I lost more tiebreaks. I mean, it's normal, but you try to learn from that,"" Sinner said. ""I come from skiing, where when you make one mistake the race is over. In tennis, it's a bit of a different mentality."" Paul, who got a taste of Sinner's steel, applauded the world No.1. ""He plays a super fast-paced tennis game. Today he clutched up on serves on the big points,"" Paul said of Sinner. ""He does what all the best players in the world do, step it up.""He's unreal out of the corners. Hits a quality ball every time the ball is on his racquet. Sinner is probably the best ball striker on tour. That's kind of what separates him."" Tennis awaits the Medvedev counter.",Daniil Medvedev takes on Jannik Sinner in the US Open quarterfinals. World No.1 has won the head-to-head match 7-5.
