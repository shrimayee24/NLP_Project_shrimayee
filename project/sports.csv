What the letter said



Moquim’s past controversies



NEW DELHI: The Congress party on Monday expelled former MLA Mohammed Moquim from the party days after he wrote to Sonia Gandhi urging the removal of party president Mallikarjun Kharge on the grounds that “age is not on his side. ” Congress cited ""anti-party activities"" as the reason behind his expulsion, however, it refrained from specifying such acts.""This is for the information of all concerned that AICC has approved the proposal for the expulsion of Sri Md. Moquim from the primary membership of the party, due to anti-party activities,"" the notice issued by Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee (OPCC) said.Moquim had written to Sonia, urging her that the party should consider bringing forward ""young leaders"", adding that the Grand Old Party was going through a ""difficult phase"".""I have written a letter to Sonia Gandhi stating that the party is going through a difficult phase and needs her advice and new leadership... Age is not on AICC President Mallikarjun Kharge's side... We should bring forward young leaders. I know that Sonia ji and the CWC members will definitely discuss this.... Nuapada by-elections were concerning,"" he had said.The 60-year-old received criticism for the letter as OPCC chief Bhakta Das went on to equate his remarks as one aligned with the BJP.“Those who challenge the party leadership should immediately join the BJP,” he said on Sunday.Addressed to Sonia Gandhi, Moquim’s letter pointed out party’s recent electoral defeats in Bihar, Delhi, Haryana, Maharashtra and Kashmir and blamed a ""series of wrong decisions, misguided leadership choices"".""The recent outcomes in Bihar, Delhi, Haryana, Maharashtra, and Kashmir, where our defeats were by staggering margins, are not just electoral setbacks; they reflect a deeper organisational disconnect,"" the letter said.""A series of wrong decisions, misguided leadership choices, and the continued concentration of responsibility in the wrong hands have weakened the Party from within. Rather than correcting these errors, we appear to be repeating them and the consequences are now visible to the entire nation,"" the letter added.The letter further questioned whether the ""responsibilities being entrusted to the right people"".""Painful questions are being raised: Are decisions being made with seriousness? Are responsibilities being entrusted to the right people? Does the leadership fully grasp the gravity of this crisis, or are we allowing the Party's decline to continue unchecked, with decisions remaining in the wrong hands?"" he questioned.The Bharatiya Janata Party was quick to react to the ""internal rift"" with Shehzad Poonawalla saying, ""Team Priyanka vs team Rahul out in the open now Internal rift in Congress out! Senior Congress leader from Odisha Writes to Sonia Gandhi: Says Kharge Hatao ,Priyanka Lao;Hits out at state and central leadership Odisha leader Mohammed Moquim has questioned the leadership crisis nationally and called for deep structural, organisational and ideological renewal for the party’s revival. He notes a “deep and growing disconnect” between the Congress leadership and Indian youth, saying that under the current leadership of Mallikarjun Kharge, who is 83, the party has been unable to resonate with the youth.""This was not Moquim’s first brush with controversy. He was suspended on July 15, 2023, for questioning Pattanaik’s leadership, a decision that was later withdrawn on January 23, 2024, ahead of the simultaneous Assembly and Lok Sabha elections.Earlier, he had received a show-cause notice for cross-voting in support of NDA presidential candidate Droupadi Murmu in July 2022. The former Barabati–Cuttack MLA, who was elected for the first time and whose seat is now held by his daughter Sofia Firdous, was disqualified from contesting the 2024 elections after being convicted in a state vigilance case on September 29, 2022.","Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee (OPCC) expelled former MLA Mohammed Moquim from the party on Monday.

Dwyane Wade reflects on LeBron James in Year 23





Dwyane Wade and LeBron James memories from the Heat era





The bond between Dwyane Wade and LeBron James has always been special. As James steps into Year 23, Wade no longer speaks as a former teammate alone. He speaks as a fan who understands what the league is slowly preparing to lose. Recently, Wade commented on James’ 23rd NBA season comes contemplating who shared championships, pressure, and history with James at the highest level.Wade’s words arrive at a time when every appearance by LeBron feels meaningful. The milestones keep coming, yet the uncertainty lingers. For Wade, that reality has shifted how he watches the game now. There is admiration, reflection, and a sense of time closing in on an era few believed possible.Speaking candidly, Dwyane Wade did not hide the emotion tied to watching James still perform at an elite level. His appreciation felt personal and honest.“I’m like you guys, I’m a fan. I know it’s like, ‘he’s old, he should retire’. But at the same time, I’m gonna miss him… He’s just taking these moments in, we don’t know when the last one is coming.”Wade’s praise for James is not a one time thing. Previously, in episode of Wy Network by Dwyane Wade, the Heat legend shared his candid thoughts.“I have the greatest body of work of anybody that’s ever put a Miami Heat jersey on,” Wade said.“If you wanna be honest, LeBron James is the greatest player to ever put a Miami Heat jersey on… I’m the greatest player in the history of the Miami Heat for the body of work I had wearing that jersey, but I’m not the greatest player to ever put on a Miami Heat jersey.”Dwyane Wade retired from the NBA in 2019 after 16 seasons, mostly with the Miami Heat. He admitted his burst was fading and the joy was gone, even as a Hall of Famer. Since retiring, Wade thrives as a businessman, media voice, and NBA owner, while proudly supporting his daughter Zaya.Wade recently revisited another iconic chapter with humor while recalling the famous Big Three introduction. His memory of that moment revealed both restraint and foresight.“Let’s run that tape who was it again. It’s one voice and look at the one in the middle laughing like young boy over here was talking… he was feeling the moment… look I look put my head down, look I put my head down, ‘I’m like hey man look now I’mma supportive teammate.'”“I’m my rubbing my knee I’m like ‘Oh I don’t know if I got that much… He trippin’, look I ain’t said a word… That was that supposed to have been a moment that was just for our fans and it should not have been the world should not have seen.”“That’s something that you say internal, you know what I mean? We going to win every year but really you know how hard it is to win one year. I don’t care what kind of talent you have so that’s why I was sitting there like oh my man don’t know yet.”“But he did go to the Finals 10 years in a row though. He damn sure didn’t like about how many opportunities. He almost did it, he ain’t lie… Listen, we went 4, he went 10.”In September this year, the 2025 Basketball Hall of Fame weekend carried special meaning for LeBron James and Dwyane Wade. While Wade was inducted in 2023 and James awaits retirement, both attended to honor the 2008 Team USA “Redeem Team.” The group’s induction marked a defining chapter in USA Basketball history.LeBron James is not stopping despite recent injury setbacks.

Who attended the Chiefs vs Chargers game in NFL week 15?



It was a must-win game for Kansas City Chiefs against the Los Angeles Chargers to keep the playoff hopes alive. But at the end of the day, it was Justin Herbert's team that made sure that Patrick Mahomes' team misses the NFL playoff picture after 11 years, something the Chiefs are not used to.Many celebrities from Chiefs side came to cheer for the team but it all went in vain. A star-studded stand also could not help Travis Kelce and co from a defeat that would surely take some time to digest. Chargers beat Chiefs by 16-13. Here's all the celebrities who attended the game.Taylor Swift does not need a spotlight to steal attention. Sometimes, the quietest presence says the most. On a cold night at Arrowhead Stadium, with playoff implications hanging in the air, Swift slipped back into a familiar setting. She was there for football, family and a moment that felt strikingly normal despite the global fame attached to her name.Swift was seen sharing a suite with Kylie Kelce and Jason Kelce’s young daughters, bundled up in a chunky gold, brown and orange jacket against the cold. In one clip, she gently lifted one of her soon to be nieces and held the child on her hip, smiling as the game played on. In another moment, her mother Andrea watched alongside Donna Kelce, turning the night into a rare snapshot of blended family time inside one of the NFL’s loudest venues.This low key approach has become a pattern. Just a week earlier, Swift attended the Chiefs game against the Houston Texans without drawing attention. She arrived unnoticed and barely appeared on the broadcast, a sharp contrast to previous seasons. Fans only realized she was there after spotting her in a suite with Selena Gomez and Lena Dunham, long after kickoff.There is intention behind the discretion. A source told Us Weekly in October that Swift chose to stay more out of sight because the attention had become “too excessive.” Since then, she has avoided being photographed arriving at Arrowhead Stadium, keeping the focus on the game rather than the gates.The night also included familiar Chiefs faces. Brittany Mahomes was present with son Bronze, wearing a custom white Mahomes Chiefs outfit while cheering from the stands. Though the season has been uneven, Brittany remained a style standout, from her symbolic denim looks to coordinated outfits with baby Golden. On this night, however, fashion took a back seat as she watched Patrick Mahomes endure a scary injury, a reminder that even glamorous game days can turn tense in seconds.At Arrowhead, the cameras missed the arrival, but they caught something better. A superstar blending into family, football and the cold Kansas City night.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes's wife Brittany's game-day fashion ages badly as Chiefs’ disastrous defeat overshadows her attention-grabbing fit",Kansas City Chiefs lost 16-13 to Los Angeles Chargers at Arrowhead Stadium.

Edwin Diaz wife Nashaly reflects on family warmth and a welcoming start in Los Angeles



The first signs of change in Edwin Diaz’s life did not come through baseball announcements or bold statements. They came through his family. On Saturday, his wife Nashaly shared a quiet but meaningful Instagram post that captured what this move to Los Angeles actually feels like, not for a player, but for a household learning how to settle into something new.The images told their own story. Blue balloons filled the room. Jerseys with the names Jahel, Sebastian and Lucas hung beside Diaz’s No. 3. It was simple and personal, the kind of detail that does not ask for attention but earns it. The message was clear. This move was not only about a new team. It was about carrying their family forward together.One of the photos showed the family standing together, relaxed and comfortable. Diaz and his sons wore Dodgers jerseys, looking more excited than overwhelmed. Nashaly stood beside them in a blue designer dress, understated and calm, letting the moment speak for itself rather than styling it into something louder.Her caption expressed exactly where they are right now. ""24 hours in Los Angeles 💙✨ So happy and deeply grateful for the amazing welcome we received from our new Dodgers family. Thank you for so much love from the first moment.This is just getting started⚾💫,"" Nashaly wrote.The reaction in the comments followed the same tone. Messages of welcome poured in from fans and familiar faces alike.The comments were not about numbers or pressure. They were about welcome. About belonging. About settling in faster than anyone expected. She framed it as gratitude. That choice matters. Especially in a city where change often feels rushed.As Edwin Diaz prepares for his first moments in Dodger blue, this glimpse into family life adds a softer layer to the story. It is not loud. It does not need to be. It simply shows a family arriving, taking a breath, and beginning again routines and the quiet comfort of feeling welcomed from the very start.Also read: Kiké Hernández’s wife Mariana Vicente gives fans a warm glimpse into their life together with a quiet Instagram Story","Edwin Diaz's wife Nashaly shared a quiet but meaningful Instagram post on Saturday.

How do Connor McDavid and Kris Knoblauch view Edmonton Oilers’ Goaltending trade?

Edmonton Oilers Trade Skinner + Kulak For Jarry + Poulin Thoughts | Quinn Hughes To Wild

On Saturday, the Edmonton Oilers' locker room was filled with a combination of feelings and expectations as the team prepared for a huge roster change before their game against the Toronto Maple Leafs. The exchange that sent goalie Stuart Skinner and defenseman Brett Kulak to the Pittsburgh Penguins was a drastic change for a team that had trusted both players during their long playoff runs. The names of Connor McDavid , Kris Knoblauch, Tristan Jarry, and Spencer Stastney were soon among the top talks of Edmonton, looking ahead to the future.The move was meant to tackle the goalkeeping issues, but the human aspect of the decision could not be overlooked. Skinner had been with the Oilers for parts of six seasons and had helped the team reach the Stanley Cup Finals twice in a row. Kulak was also a dependable player on the defense. After the morning skate, McDavid talked about how hard the moment was, and he made it clear that the loss of the familiar faces weighed on the team, even as they were getting ready for a new chapter.McDavid called the trade a tough decision that the team had to make, and at the same time pointed to the positive side of the situation by saying how much the group would miss Skinner and Kulak.Head Coach Kris Knoblauch was equally supportive, stating that both players had been very dependable over the years, contributing not only on but also off the ice. Another ex-Oilers defenseman, Troy Stecher, who now plays for Toronto, offered his insight into the situation, too. He referred to the trade as part of the business and wished his ex-colleagues nothing but the best in their new home, Pittsburgh.The focus was then directed towards the newly recruited players. Knoblauch showed trust in Tristan Jarry and mentioned his experience and the good results he had in the past, despite a hard previous season. Jarry, who got the call against Toronto, shared that the last day and a half had been full of emotions but added that getting to play with superstars like McDavid and Leon Draisaitl was a thrill. At the same time, the rapid development of Spencer Stastney, who has been skating and moving the puck well, caught the coaching staff's attention, which believed that such a skill would bring the team more balance.The Oilers are taking change with a careful and optimistic attitude. The loss of reliable teammates is painful, but Edmonton is convinced that this kind of change will help the team to be better and thus to navigate through the season.Also Read: NHL Injury Update: Evgeni Malkin sidelined as Pittsburgh Penguins face playoff pressure",Edmonton Oilers traded goalie Stuart Skinner and defenseman Brett Kulak to the Pittsburgh Penguins.

The NFL legend highlights John Cena’s influence beyond titles as his final match approaches

Tom Brady was not part of John Cena’s world, at least not on paper. Different sports, different crowds, different stages. Yet as Cena moves toward his final match, Brady’s words found their way into the moment, offering something quieter than praise and heavier than nostalgia.Retirements often arrive with long speeches and rehearsed emotion. This one felt different. Cena’s career has stretched across eras, pressure, and constant reinvention. Brady did not talk about wins or fame. He pointed to impact, to the people reached along the way, and to a kind of influence that stays after the lights dim.Brady’s tribute did not try to sum up Cena’s career. It did not need to. The message stayed focused on something deeper than records, something harder to measure. Impact. The kind that reaches people who never step into the ring but still feel connected to what happens there.“Hey John, Congratulations on an incredible career. You have impacted lives, so many people inside the rain and outside the rain. Good luck in your last match.”The line stood out because Brady knows how endings work. He has lived through them, stepped away, returned, and finally closed the door on his own terms.That perspective gives his words weight. By pointing to Cena’s influence both inside and outside the ring, Brady acknowledged the work that rarely gets attention. The discipline. The consistency.That kind of visibility carries weight. It asks more than performance. It demands consistency, patience, and restraint, year after year, even when the attention does not slow down.For Cena, influence was never limited to titles or scripted moments. Fans watched how he handled responsibility, how often he showed up for causes that mattered, and how he stayed accountable in public. Brady’s message reflected that side of the story. It hinted that success is not only about what you collect along the way, but about the people who feel seen because of you.As Cena approaches his final match, the exchange feels understated, not sentimental. Two long careers brushed past each other through mutual respect. No shared arena. No rivalry. Just an understanding shaped by pressure, longevity, and the cost of staying relevant for so long. The kind, that lasts long after the final bell rings. Some legacies never need an encore.Also read: Brittany Mahomes & Patrick Mahomes vs Travis Kelce & Taylor Swift combined Net Worth: Who truly reigns supreme?","The NFL legend highlights John Cena’s influence beyond titles as his final match approaches.

Their financial journey feels measured, not flashy, and that is why it has lasted.Justin Verlander’s net worth (according to Celebrity Net Worth) in 2025 is estimated at around $200 million, earned almost entirely through his Major League Baseball career. Contracts with the Houston Astros and New York Mets placed him among the highest-paid pitchers of his era. Those salaries rewarded consistency, leadership, and postseason performance.What separates Verlander from many stars is timing. He stayed effective well into the later years of his career, allowing him to maximize earnings when experience mattered most. With career earnings projected to pass $400 million by 2026, his financial legacy reflects durability more than hype.Kate Upton’s net worth (according to Celebrity Net Worth) in 2025 is estimated between $20 million and $30 million. Her rise began with iconic Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue appearances that turned her into a global fashion name. High-profile campaigns followed, bringing steady income during her peak modeling years.Acting roles in films such as The Other Woman expanded her reach, but her recent focus has shifted toward beauty, fitness, and brand partnerships. Today, her earnings come from influence, ownership, and staying selective about where her name appears.Together, Justin Verlander and Kate Upton have a combined net worth estimated at around $220 million in 2025. The number reflects balance rather than extravagance. Verlander brings long-term stability through baseball salaries. Upton adds flexibility through fashion, media, and business ventures.Their shared wealth is built on careers, that grew steadily and evolved with time. In a world of short attention spans, their financial story stands out for its staying power. In the end, their story shows that lasting success comes not just from talent, but from knowing when to grow, adapt, and protect what truly matters most.Also read: Also read: Inside the fairytale life George Springer shares with his wife Charlise Castro who built her own path before the spotlight","Justin Verlander and Kate Upton have a combined net worth estimated at around $220 million in 2025.

The NFL fined T.J. Watt, and the timing is brutal

Pittsburgh’s margin gets thinner without Watt

T.J. Watt just had a scary medical week. The Pittsburgh Steelers star also got hit in the wallet.The NFL fined Watt $11,593 for a late hit from Pittsburgh’s Week 14 win over the Baltimore Ravens, days after he underwent surgery to repair a partially collapsed lung suffered during a dry needling session at the team facility.The league issued Watt a $11,593 fine for a late hit on a play with 2:12 left in the second quarter against Baltimore, when he jumped onto a moving pile as the Ravens tried to finish a Derrick Henry run. Watt did not draw a flag on the play, but the NFL still fined him ahead of Week 15.Multiple reports noted it was Watt’s first fine of the season and the only fine handed out from the Steelers-Ravens game.The fine landed as Watt recovers from an injury that put him in the hospital for three days. His brother, J.J. Watt, confirmed the surgery and shared an update that included: ""Yesterday TJ had successful surgery to stabilize and repair a partially collapsed lung suffered Wednesday after a dry needling treatment session at the facility,"" and ""Recovery timeline is still TBD, but all went well and he is being released from the hospital today. ""Watt’s wife, Dani Watt, also posted a statement after the procedure: “Yesterday TJ completed successful surgery to stabilize and repair a partially collapsed lung suffered early Wednesday after a dry needling treatment session at the facility.It has been a very long hard couple of days but he will be home soon to recover,” she wrote. “Thank you all for the incredible outpouring of love, prayers, and support the past couple of days. And praise God for the amazing medical teams at both hospitals! 🙏🏼❤️”On the football side, Pittsburgh ruled Watt out for the Week 15 game against the Miami Dolphins on Monday Night Football, per head coach Mike Tomlin’s Friday update in the report you shared.This is where it stops being just “news” and starts being a problem for Pittsburgh.The Steelers still control their playoff destiny, with a slight lead in the AFC North and four games left in the regular season. But the schedule does not soften up: Dolphins, Detroit Lions, Cleveland Browns, and Ravens.And the stat that matters most is ugly. Pittsburgh is 1-11 all time without Watt on the field, per the dump you provided. If you’re looking for why this fine is already irritating Steelers fans, it’s because the team cannot afford distractions, missed snaps, or anything that turns into a story bigger than the next opponent.With Watt out, Pittsburgh’s edge rotation shifts fast. The Steelers are expected to lean on Alex Highsmith and Nick Herbig at outside linebacker, with Jack Sawyer working in. The piece you shared also noted DeMarvin Leal could be elevated from the practice squad as another option in the front.Meanwhile, the fine itself is already getting pushback in Steelers circles. Steelers Depot’s Joe Clark called it: “It’s a really ticky-tack definition of a late hit, as Watt jumped on a pile of players trying to bring down Derrick Henry while the Ravens RB was still up,” and added: “It really doesn’t look like a play that rose to a level of a fine.”The Steelers can complain. They can laugh it off. None of that helps if Watt misses more than one week. If he comes back quickly, this becomes a weird footnote in an already wild week. If he does not, Pittsburgh’s biggest “must-have” piece turns into a weekly question, and that is how seasons slip.","Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker T.J.

Stephen Curry’s wife, Ayesha Curry, reveals the NBA legend fails to understand that a woman is trying to pursue him



Stephen Curry’s wife, Ayesha Curry’s recent comments has raised eyebrows



Stephen Curry and his wife, Ayesha Curry , have been together for a very long time, even before the star player started playing in the NBA.While both Stephen Curry and Ayesha Curry have built a beautiful life for themselves and their four children, she had opened up about how the NBA legend is unable to understand when a woman is trying to pursue him.A couple of years ago, in 2019, Stephen Curry’s wife, Ayesha Curry, made an appearance on the now discontinued show, Red Table Talk, which was hosted by Jada Pinkett Smith.As Stephen Curry’s wife, Ayesha Curry, reflected on her life, she opened up about women pursuing her husband.Stephen Curry’s wife, Ayesha Curry, said, ""But there have been a couple of times, where I've wanted to punch somebody in the face for sure…”The popular chef added, “He can't see it coming, I see it from a mile away.""Stephen Curry’s wife, Ayesha Curry, continued, ""Stephen is very nice by nature…Everything is always very friendly, sometimes to the point where, 'I'm a grown woman,' so, I'll just insert myself and be like, 'Hello, how are you doing?'""Despite the attention that Stephen Curry has reportedly received from other women over the years, the Golden State Warriors’ star player has remained committed and faithful to his wife, Ayesha Curry, and their children.While Stephen Curry is praised for this, his wife, Ayesha Curry, attracted a lot of criticism over the last few months.A few months ago, in August 2025, Stephen Curry’s wife, Ayesha Curry, appeared on the Call Her Daddy podcast where she revealed that she had many different plans for her life in her younger days.This includes not wanting to get married and not having children.Stephen Curry’s wife, Ayesha Curry, said, “No. I didn’t want kids.

NEW DELHI: Tilak Varma's rise in Indian cricket has been swift, but on Sunday in Dharamshala it crossed a symbolic milestone. The 23-year-old left-hander went past Virat Kohli — long regarded as the gold standard in run chases — to become the batter with the best average in T20I run chases in the world, underlining his growing reputation as one of India's most dependable performers in the shortest format.Batting at No.3 in the third T20I against South Africa, Tilak played a knock that was uncharacteristic in tempo but rich in significance. His unbeaten 25 off 34 balls, with just three boundaries, was not eye-catching, but it steered India calmly to a modest target of 118 in 15.5 overs. More importantly, it nudged his numbers into elite territory.With that innings, Tilak's average against South Africa in T20Is rose to 70.50 — the highest by an Indian batter against a particular opponent, surpassing Kohli's 70.28 against Pakistan (minimum 300 runs). The bigger landmark, however, came in run chases. Tilak now averages 68.0 in T20I chases (minimum 500 runs), overtaking Kohli's celebrated mark of 67.1 and topping the global list among batters from Test-playing nations.*Min 300 runs scoredLike Kohli before him, Tilak is carving a niche as a chase specialist. So far, he has scored 543 runs in 16 T20I innings while batting second, with a highest score of 72 not out, blending composure with shot-making when the pressure is on.Kohli, by comparison, amassed 2013 runs in 48 T20I chases at an average of 67.10, with a best of 94 not out — numbers that defined an era.Tilak's effectiveness is amplified by his consistency at No.3. In that position, he has piled up 468 runs in 14 innings at an average of 58.5 and a strike rate of 160.27, including two hundreds and two fifties — a rare combination of volume and impact in T20 cricket.The ongoing five-match series against South Africa has further showcased his form. Tilak has scored 113 runs in three matches, beginning with 26 in the opener and a fluent 62 off 34 balls in the second T20I.Overall, Tilak Varma now has 1110 runs from 39 T20Is at an average of 48.26 and a strike rate of 142.49, with two centuries and five fifties. At just 23, the numbers suggest India may already have found its next great finisher of chases — one who has now edged past the ‘Chasemaster' himself.",Tilak Varma becomes the batter with the best average in T20I run chases in the world. The 23-year-old left-hander went past Virat Kohli in Dharamshala.

NEW DELHI: India’s left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh attributed his impressive showing in the third T20I against South Africa to keeping things simple and making the most of the favourable conditions in Dharamsala.Arshdeep finished with figures of 2 for 13 from his four overs, laying the foundation for India’s seven-wicket victory over South Africa in the third T20I at the HPCA Stadium on Sunday, an effort that also earned him the Player of the Match award.“Nothing changed. I just pitched the ball in the right areas and tried to get as much help from the wicket. There was some help in the wicket, the conditions were cold as well, so there was enough swing and seam. I just tried to keep it simple, hit the right areas, and got the reward,” Arshdeep said after the match.The left-armer also expressed satisfaction at bouncing back strongly after an off day in New Chandigarh. “When I walked onto the ground, everyone was telling me this is also your home ground. So the first thing I told them was, no, this is not my home ground - so that felt better.”“After that, just sticking to the basics, doing the basics right, and trusting my skill set.When you play at this level, there are some days when you won’t execute the things you want to do. It was one off day (last game), so it feels nice to do this (bowl well in this game).”Speaking about the review taken against Reeza Hendricks, Arshdeep said, “It was Surya bhai who wanted to get some suspense in there. The moment it hit the pad, I knew it was out. When I got the approval from Jitesh as well, we knew we were going for the review. He just wanted to wait, chat for a bit, and then take it.”On the review call involving Dewald Brevis, which was eventually not taken, Arshdeep said, ""As a bowler, you want to take every review possible (and burst into laughter). I felt it hit the pad twice, so that was the confusion. Next time, I’ll take care of that.""Meanwhile, wrist spinner Varun Chakaravarthy returned figures of 2 for 11 and became the second fastest Indian to reach 50 men’s T20I wickets. He admitted the biting cold made things difficult but credited the team’s preparation. ""I actually wasn’t aware of the milestone, so thank you for telling me. It was doing a bit early on when the fast bowlers were bowling, there was some seam movement.”“But overall, the conditions were very tough. I’ve never played at a ground this cold, so I did find it quite challenging. No, not at all. This (chilly weather) can never happen in Chennai.”Reflecting on what changed after the defeat in New Chandigarh, Chakaravarthy said, “We had a proper bowling meeting and some very honest conversations. We identified where we went wrong and focused on the right approach. Credit has to go to the management and the bowlers. It was a two-way discussion, and it worked really well.”Asked about his approach, the spinner added, “I was just trying to stick to my strengths. Today, the ball was skidding more than turning, so my focus was on skidding the ball on to the batter rather than trying to force too much turn. It feels really good (second fastest to 50 T20I wickets). As long as I’m playing for India and contributing with wickets, I’ll always feel good.""",Arshdeep finished with figures of 2 for 13 from his four overs. Varun Chakaravarthy became the second fastest Indian to reach 50 men’s T20I wickets.

NEW DELHI: Ace all-rounder Hardik Pandya reached a major milestone on Sunday by taking his 100th T20I wicket during the India vs South Africa 3rd T20I in Dharamsala. With this wicket, he became the first Indian cricketer to record both 100 wickets and 1,000 runs in T20 internationals.Pandya returned to India colours in the opening T20I in Cuttack after being out of action since September 26, 2025. He marked his comeback with an unbeaten 59 off 28 balls, hitting six fours and four sixes.He also took one wicket for 16 runs in two overs, helping India secure a 101-run win and earning the Player of the Match award.In the last game, however, India faced a heavy defeat, with South Africa levelling the series 1-1.With India's early domination in the third T20I, it seems as if they are on their way to take the lead back in the five-match series.By completing 100 wickets, Pandya joined pacers Arshdeep Singh and Jasprit Bumrah as only the third Indian bowler to reach the milestone in the format. Arshdeep has 107 wickets from 69 matches with best figures of 4 for 9, while Bumrah has 101 wickets in 81 games with best figures of 3 for 7.Before this game, Pandya had 99 wickets in 122 T20Is at an economy of 8.22, with a best of 4 for 16.Worldwide, only four all-rounders, Shakib Al Hasan, Mohammad Nabi, Sikandar Raza and Virandeep Singh, had previously achieved the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in T20Is. Pandya is now the fifth to join this select group.","Hardik Pandya takes 100th T20I wicket during India's win over South Africa.

Ashish Nehra interview: Gujarat Titans head coach backs out of form Shubman Gill

Poll Do you believe Suryakumar Yadav is capable of regaining his form in upcoming matches? Yes, he's a talented player. No, he seems out of form. It's hard to say.

NEW DELHI: Suryakumar Yadav may be short of runs, but India’s T20I captain remains firm in his belief that form is not the issue. After another modest outing in India’s seven-wicket win over South Africa in the third T20I on Sunday, Suryakumar acknowledged the lean patch but insisted it was only a matter of time before the runs returned.Suryakumar scored 12 off 11 balls before falling to Lungi Ngidi, extending a difficult run that has seen him struggle for consistency. Barring a fluent 75 against Bangladesh in Hyderabad on October 24 and an unbeaten 47 against Pakistan in the Asia Cup in September, runs have been hard to come by. The sequence has now dragged on for 21 innings and has pushed his T20I average in 2025 down to 14.20, with two matches still left in the series.Yet, the skipper struck an optimistic note at the post-match presentation. “I've been batting beautifully in the nets. When the runs have to come, they'll come. Not out of form, definitely out of runs,” Suryakumar said, brushing aside concerns over his personal returns.More than individual numbers, Suryakumar underlined India’s response after their defeat in the second T20I. “I think this sport teaches you a lot of things.How you come back into the series is more important,” he said. “We wanted to go back to basics, do the same things we were doing in Cuttack, and the results were on our side.” He added that lessons from the loss in New Chandigarh were addressed collectively. “The bowlers sat together, we had a good team meeting as well. ”India’s bowlers set up the victory, led by player of the match Arshdeep Singh , who returned to his “tried and tested basic methods” after an ordinary previous game. “It was one off day… so it feels nice to do this,” Arshdeep said, dedicating the Man-of-the-Match award to his 10-month-old niece watching from the stands.South Africa skipper Aiden Markram credited India’s pacers for dismantling the top order early, while also acknowledging Abhishek Sharma ’s brisk 18-ball 35 that put the chase beyond reach. Varun Chakravarthy, who struck twice in the middle overs, said honest conversations after the last match helped India regroup.","Suryakumar Yadav says he is not out of form, just out of runs. India captain scored 12 off 11 balls in third T20I win over South Africa.

Former India cricketer Manoj Tiwari launched a scathing attack on the organisers and authorities after chaos marred Lionel Messi’s much-hyped appearance at Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday, saying a global icon like the Argentine superstar “deserved better”.“I am speechless of what happened today in my city! This is shambolic! Me, being an international sportsperson can feel how embarrassing it was for Messi today. We all love him and the craze was well anticipated! Organizer Satadru has already been arrested and I thank the police department for the prompt action. The way Satadru played with the hard-earned money and emotion of the football-loving people of Bengal today at the Salt Lake Stadium, deserves an alarming punishment. .. Another case of False promise and complete mismanagement by Satadru! Thankfully I was not present today... I always had doubt if he had the credibility of pulling off an event like this in Kolkata. A legend like Leo Messi deserved better. I am sure the Government will take strict action against Satadru and management.. Kolkata didn't deserve this!” Tiwari wrote on X.Messi’s much-anticipated visit lasted just 22 minutes, enough to turn what was billed as a historic celebration into a spectacle of mismanagement.More than 50,000 fans, many of whom paid between Rs 4,000 and Rs 12,000, and even higher in the black market, were left frustrated after failing to get a clear glimpse of the World Cup winner.The situation deteriorated rapidly as Messi was surrounded by politicians, VVIPs and security personnel, effectively blocking the view of the paying public.Despite repeated appeals from promoter Satadru Dutta over the public address system to clear the ground, the crowding worsened, forcing Messi’s early exit.Angry fans reacted by throwing bottles and chairs, vandalising canopies and damaging stadium property, prompting police intervention.The unrest lasted over an hour, though police largely showed restraint to prevent a stampede.Messi’s second visit to Kolkata, part of his India tour, was meant to inspire football lovers. Instead, it exposed glaring gaps in planning and crowd control, leaving behind disappointment, damage and serious questions about governance and accountability.","Messi’s second visit to Kolkata, part of his India tour, was meant to inspire football lovers.

The story of Luthra Empire

Goa Club Owners Saurabh & Gaurav Luthra Arrested in Phuket After Deadly Fire

It was a spectacle. A magnet for travelers

The fallen empire

GOA/NEW DELHI: Investigators have discovered a corporate web spanning 42 companies and LLPs, many sharing a single Delhi office address—classic signs of corporate layering and potential money laundering.Agencies are preparing for deeper scrutiny.According to documents and GST details, brothers are linked with 42 firms, some of which are suspected to be shell entities.The findings have been communicated to agencies concerned for actions, sources said. This pattern of multiple entities sharing a single address and directors is a classic indication of corporate layering & potential money laundering,” a sleuth said.It began a decade ago in a quiet corner of Delhi’s Hudson Lane. A small, casual café called 'Mama’s Buoi' drew college students seeking cheap bites and music.It was unassuming, but for brothers Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, it was the first step into a world they would soon dominate.They were engineers by training—Saurabh, the self-styled “gold medallist,” bold and flamboyant; Gaurav, precise, methodical, the quiet architect behind the accounts.Together, they would build a brand that lit up nightlife. The turning point came with Romeo Lane.A modest success in Delhi’s Civil Lines, it became something else entirely when the brothers opened in Goa’s Vagator after the post-Covid tourism boom.Cliffs kissed by the Arabian Sea, fire performers leaping through the night, Bollywood beats pounding across open terraces—Romeo Lane was no longer a nightclub.A brand that malls fought to host, paying steep fees, agreeing to strict franchise contracts, eager to cash in on the Luthras’ magic.From Delhi to Indore, Nagpur, Agra, Dehradun—and even Dubai—the empire expanded at a breakneck pace. Birch by Romeo Lane and Caha joined the roster.Over 25 outlets now operate across India, with nearly 25 more reportedly in the pipeline. Few hospitality brands had ever grown this fast.But behind the glamour lay cracks.Franchisees sometimes thrived, sometimes struggled. Investors complained they were abandoned despite paying hefty fees. Consultants were chased, meetings went unanswered. Rapid growth had outpaced oversight.And then, the tragedy struck. March 2024 saw the opening of what the brothers called India’s first island bar—an ambitious outpost in Arpora, Goa.But safety rules were often ignored. Basements turned into kitchens.Local panchayat violations went unchecked. On a fateful December night, fire ripped through Birch by Romeo Lane, claiming 25 lives.The empire that once dazzled with lights, music, and spectacle now faces an uncertain future.Franchisees speak of abandoning the Romeo Lane name, running outlets independently. The glamour is gone. The empire, built in a decade, teeters on the edge.From a quiet café in Hudson Lane to the cliffs of Goa, the Luthra brothers’ story is one of ambition, excess, and tragedy. In the wake of the blaze, one question remains: can the empire survive its own fire?","Investigators have discovered a corporate web spanning 42 companies and LLPs, many sharing a single Delhi office address.

Kiké Hernández wife Mariana Vicente Instagram Story reflects a family tradition shaped by time



(Image via: Mariana Vicente's IG Story)

Mariana Vicente did not try to make a moment out of her Instagram Story. That is what made it land. Kiké Hernández’s wife shared a glimpse of her Christmas season without dressing it up or turning it into something performative. Just a tree. Just a question. Just a thought shared in passing.The Story felt like something posted late in the day, when the house is calm and the noise settles. No big message. No push for attention. It was the kind of post people pause on because it feels familiar, not impressive.Mariana used Instagram’s question sticker and asked, “What is a christmas tradition you started with your family ?” Her answer followed without explanation or flourish.“Getting a new ornament every year. I haven’t put them up this year yet. I also love hosting Christmas Eve but this year I’m letting our friends take over”It was the kind of response that did not try to sound meaningful, yet carried meaning anyway. One ornament a year is not about decoration. It is about marking time slowly. About remembering where you were when that ornament came home. Over years, those pieces turn into memory markers more than holiday decor.What stood out even more was what she admitted next. The ornaments were not up yet. Hosting duties were passed on this year. There was no apology in her words. Just honesty. Life shifts. Traditions adjust. That does not make them weaker.There was also no effort to tie the moment to baseball or schedules or public life. Kiké Hernández was not the center of the post. The home was. That choice mattered.Fans responded because the Story felt like something they could have posted themselves. Many know the feeling of wanting to do things a certain way and realizing it does not always happen. Of loving traditions while letting them breathe.Mariana did not try to define Christmas. She did not need to. She simply showed what it looks like when it grows naturally, year by year, without pressure to be perfect.Also read: Kiké Hernández’s wife Mariana Vicente gives fans a warm glimpse into their life together with a quiet Instagram Story","Kiké Hernández’s wife Mariana Vicente shared a glimpse of her Christmas season without dressing it up or turning it into something performative.

Lionel Messi India trip: Mumbai out in numbers for the superstar

Poll How do you feel about Lionel Messi's visit to Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium? It was a magical experience! It brought the city together. I wish I could have attended.

MUMBAI: For once, Sachin Tendulkar may have known what it felt like to be on the other side of the noise at a packed Wankhede Stadium.The ground that once rose in unison to his name — his bastion, his theatre — surrendered itself on Sunday evening to another chant entirely. “Leo… Messi… Leo… Messi.” It rolled across the stands, bounced off the blue seats, and lingered in the warm Mumbai air, refusing to fade.At exactly 5.52 pm, Lionel Messi walked out onto the Wankhede turf alongside Inter Miami teammates Luis Suarez and Rodrigo De Paul, and for the next hour, the decibel level barely dipped . You couldn’t call it frenzy or chaos, but rather something closer to reverence.Even those meant to be the evening’s entertainers — Indian football stars and celebrities playing an exhibition match — became spectators in their own right. Sunil Chhetri , Rahul Bheke, Bala Devi, Jayesh Rane, actors Dino Morea, Jim Sarbh and others wore expressions that betrayed their excitement. For once, the spotlight was irresistible.Messi’s presence needed no embellishment. He took a penalty — Mumbai defender Ashutosh Mehta stood no chance — and then, in a moment that summed up the awe of the evening, ISL midfielder Jayesh Rane instinctively bent down to touch Messi’s feet. The gesture felt spontaneous, almost reflexive.Jayesh later told TOI that, being a fan of Messi, he just went for it. “His aura was on a different level.In our culture, we touch the feet of our idol. That’s what I did. I don’t know if he liked it or not, but it was one of the best memories of my life,” he said.Soon after, Messi, Suarez and De Paul began their slow walk around the stadium, gently lofting footballs into the stands. Some in the crowd had paid lakhs for a ticket, others far less, but in that moment it didn’t matter. Just a nod, a wave, a ball kicked just right was enough to send a section into rapture.Perhaps the most enduring images came when Messi joined children from Project Maha-Deva, Maharashtra’s grassroots football programme, on the pitch. One-touch passes, quick laughs, a game of ‘donkey in the middle’. For the kids, it was a memory that will likely shape their relationship with the sport forever.Then came the moment that quietly bridged two sporting worlds.Messi handed Sunil Chhetri, India’s all-time leading goalscorer, an Argentina jersey. Once, not so long ago, Chhetri had been chasing Messi in the international goals chart. Today, Messi sits on 115 goals, second only to Cristiano Ronaldo’s 143, while Chhetri, with 95, has slipped to fourth. Numbers aside, the exchange carried mutual respect.Tendulkar, watching it all unfold, later addressed the crowd.“The way you have welcomed Leo, Luis and Rodrigo — thank you. I have spent some incredible moments here.“As we call it, Mumbai is a city of dreams. And a number of dreams have seen the finish line here at this very venue. And today, having all three of them here is indeed a golden moment for Mumbai, Mumbaikars and India,” said Tendulkar, member of the Indian team that claimed the 2011 ODI World Cup title here.“When it comes to Leo, what does one talk about him? He has achieved everything. We really admire his dedication, determination and commitment. And above all, his humility.”Tendulkar then presented Messi with his 2011 World Cup jersey — ‘Tendulkar’ emblazoned on the back, No. 10 beneath it. Two greats, the same number.Tight security, smooth organisation and a clear understanding of scale ensured that Wankhede handled the magnitude without losing control.For this Sunday evening, the Wankhede, so steeped in cricketing memory, spoke a different language. And for once, Mumbai listened — loudly and gladly.","Messi handed Sunil Chhetri, India’s all-time leading goalscorer, an Argentina jersey. Tendulkar: “As we call it, Mumbai is a city of dreams.

DHARAMSHALA:

Shivam Mavi opens up on IPL snubs, lonely domestic grind, confidence before auction

Usually on match eves, Jasprit Bumrah prefers to go through the paces. More often than not, he is one of the seniors in the team who chooses to skip these optional sessions. On Saturday evening, though, he turned up at the HPCA stadium, set up his own practice nets on the centre square and went through a rigorous session of bowling, focusing much on getting the yorker right.He didn’t bowl to any of the batters. It was just Bumrah, a camera stationed right next to where an umpire would be standing, a pair of boots and cones on either side of the crease at the other end, stumps and bowling coach Morne Morkel . For a good 45 minutes, he went full throttle. It was a solo act—one which will be a masterclass in perfecting yorkers. These drills are usually carried out when one starts out bowling yorkers. In essence, he has gone back to the drawing board.Right from the time he burst on to the scene, Bumrah and toe-crushing yorkers became synonymous. Over a period of time, he has mastered the all-round art of fast bowling so well that he has always been in control of proceedings. Hence, unnerving Bumrah is one of the toughest jobs for opposing teams. Yet, he has managed to identify what has been lacking in bowling.In the second T20I against South Africa in New Chandigarh, Bumrah failed to execute his yorkers. Interestingly, since he resumed his T20I duties in the Asia Cup in Sept after a gap of 14 months, he hasn’t looked incisive enough. In 12 preceding matches, his economy rate has been under control. He conceded over 11 runs per over twice and only once his economy rate has gone beyond seven. What would be a tad disconcerting is the fact that he has managed to take just 12 oversIt also could be that the opponents have decided to play Bumrah out more cautiously, preserving wickets to target the other bowlers.“I think on a night when he’s off, you've got to take what you can get because I don't know when you're going to get it again. We don’t plan too much around the matchups. Whatever it allows us on the night. If the batters are in, we obviously want to take on the aggressive options,” South Africa coach Shukri Conrad replied to a query on how they prepare for Bumrah.“I’m sure he’ll be back to his best again tomorrow night or maybe later in the series we hope. You have to factor in the conditions. Maybe the ball was a little bit wet side,” he added, choosing his words very carefully, probably not wanting to poke the bear.Bumrah, by his own lofty standards, would know he hasn’t been able to make an impact as consistently as he was used to. Conditions or not, the assault carried out on him by the South African batters two days ago must have stirred him up.","Jasprit Bumrah went through a rigorous session of bowling, focusing much on getting the yorker right.

Poll Did Isharani Baruah have a chance against Unnati Hooda in the final? Yes, she could have won No, Hooda was dominant

Isharani Baruah’s dream run eventually came to an end as she went down to top seed Unnati Hooda in the women’s singles final of Odisha Masters in Cuttack on Sunday.Hooda, who dropped only one game in the entire tournament during her semifinal against Tasnim Mir, grabbed a 21-17, 21-10 win against Baruah in just over half an hour.As for the men’s singles title, No. 2 seed Kiran George won it after he beat Indonesia’s Muhamad Yusuf 21-14, 13-21, 21-16 in a hard-fought battle.Earlier, Hooda dominated the match throughout to earn her only title this year at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium. It was also her third triumph in a BWF Super 100 tournament — which also includes the 2022 Odisha Masters.Coming into the tournament after making it to the semifinals of Syed Modi International, Hooda had no trouble in the final as Baruah kept making errors after the first game was locked at 15-15. As a result, it soon became 20-15 for Hooda and she took the game with ease.In the second game, Baruah, whose both knees were heavily strapped, failed to keep up with Hooda as she stayed calm and made immaculate placements across the court.Irrespective of that Baruah’s fighting spirit helped her to make it 9-11 at one stage. But from then onwards, Hooda completely took control of the game and won it 21-10.This has been an incredible year for Hooda as she also made it to the semifinals of Taipei Open and Hylo Open. She also made a huge breakthrough when she beat PV Sindhu in the pre-quarterfinals of China Open and became the youngest Indian woman to reach a Super 1000 quarterfinal.Moreover, Hooda also played a huge role in helping India win a historic bronze in BWF World Junior Mixed Team Championships in Guwahati.Meanwhile, the men’s singles final saw a tight contest where George took the first game with ease after winning a series of points from 13-12 onwards. Yusuf did fight back to take the second game, but George upped the ante in the third to grab the win in just over an hour.As for the doubles events, Indonesian pair Marwan Faza and Aisyah Pranata won the mixed doubles title.

Planning your year around UAE holidays





Local authorities may add extra holidays

Public holidays are not carried forward if they fall on weekends or overlap with another holiday

Islamic holidays depend on moon sightings, so slight adjustments are possible





Residents of the UAE have much to look forward to in 2026, with several public holidays promising opportunities for long weekends and family time. From Eid celebrations to the National Day, a mix of fixed Gregorian dates and Islamic lunar holidays will shape the holiday calendar. Here is a detailed guide to all predicted public holidays, how they are determined, and tips to plan your time off.UAE public holidays are a combination of fixed Gregorian dates and Islamic lunar calendar dates. Gregorian holidays, such as New Year’s Day and National Day, occur on the same date each year. Islamic holidays, including Eid Al Fitr, Eid Al Adha, Islamic New Year, and Prophet Muhammad’s Birthday (PBUH), shift each year based on moon sightings.The UAE Public Holiday Law, established in April 2024 and implemented from January 2025, allows certain holidays to be shifted to the start or end of the week to create long weekends, except for Eid holidays. Cabinet Resolution No. 27 of 2024 also permits local governments to declare additional holidays for special occasions.Holidays that fall on weekends or coincide with another public holiday are not carried forward, but 2026 predictions indicate no overlap between Islamic holidays and Gregorian holidays.Residents in the UAE can expect at least 12 public holidays in 2026. While final dates depend on moon sightings and government announcements, current predictions give a clear picture of the likely schedule:Transferable holidays: Islamic holidays such as Eid Al Fitr and Eid Al Adha are not typically transferable. Other holidays, including the Islamic New Year, Prophet’s Birthday, and National Day, may sometimes be moved to create long weekends based on Cabinet resolutions.2026 promises several opportunities for extended breaks:Residents are advised to plan ahead, as Islamic holidays depend on moon sightings, which may adjust official dates.Public and private schools in the UAE align their breaks with national holidays, though exact dates differ by curriculum and school authority:This schedule helps families coordinate holidays and make the most of predicted long weekends.Understanding the mix of fixed and lunar-based holidays allows UAE residents to strategically plan their annual leave. For example, taking just a few days off around Eid or National Day can significantly maximize time away from work. While the UAE government confirms official dates closer to each holiday, these early predictions serve as a reliable guide for 2026.Residents should note:With this guide, UAE residents can look forward to a year of well timed breaks, long weekends, and ample family and leisure time.","UAE public holidays are a combination of fixed Gregorian dates and Islamic lunar calendar dates.

"Sophie Kinsella, author of the millions-selling ‘Shopaholic’ novels, dies at 55",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/sophie-kinsella-author-of-the-millions-selling-shopaholic-novels-dies-at-55/articleshow/125900892.cms,"-

LONDON:





Sophie Kinsella, the author of “Confessions of a Shopaholic” and a series of millions-selling rom-com sequels, died Monday, her family said. She was 55 and had been diagnosed with brain cancer. The family posted on Kinsella’s Instagram account: “We are heartbroken to announce the passing this morning of our beloved Sophie (aka Maddy, aka Mummy). She died peacefully, with her final days filled with her true loves: family and music and warmth and Christmas and joy. “We can’t imagine what life will be like without her radiance and love of life.”Kinsella, who also published under her real name, Madeleine Wickham, announced in April 2024 that she had been diagnosed in late 2022 with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. “I did not share this before because I wanted to make sure that my children were able to hear and process the news in privacy and adapt to our ’new normal,’” she said at the time.Starting in 2000 with “The Secret Dreamworld of a Shopaholic”, titled “Confessions of a Shopaholic” in the US, Kinsella published 10 “Shopaholic” novels, along with other fiction. Her books have sold more than 45 million copies worldwide and have been translated into dozens of languages.The first two “Shopaholic” books were adapted into the 2009 film “Confessions of a Shopaholic”, starring Isla Fisher and Hugh Dancy. Kinsella did not grow up intending to be a writer. One of three girls born to teachers in London, she played piano and violin as a child and also composed music. She told authorpublisher Zibby Owens on her podcastthat the idea of writing never crossed her mind.Kinsella enrolled at Oxford University to study music but switched to the politics, philosophy and economics program after one year. While at college, she fell in love with musician Henry Wickham. The couple had four sons and a daughter.After graduating, Kinsella began working as a financial journalist and spent her commute reading. The idea to write fiction herself began to take shape on the train. She published her debut novel, “The Tennis Party”, in 1995 when she was 24, as Madeleine Wickham. Soon after, she left her journalism job to focus on writing. Six other books, including “The Gatecrasher” and “Sleeping Arrangements”, followed.An otherwise normal shopping excursion sparked the idea for writing her first “Shopaholic” novel. “I remember looking around me and thinking... “We all shop... We talk about it. We do it. We rejoice in it. We make bad decisions. Why hasn’t anybody written about this?” Kinsella said in 2019.Kinsella also wrote “The Undomestic Goddess”, “Remember Me?” and “Twenties Girl”. A young adult novel, “Finding Audrey”, was released in 2015, followed by the children’s book series “My Mummy Fairy and Me.”Her novel “Can You Keep a Secret?” was adapted into a film starring Alexandra Daddario and Tyler Hoechlin in 2019. Her last novel was “The Burnout,” released in 2023.After her diagnosis, she wrote a novella, “What Does It Feel Like”, about a woman with five children who has brain cancer. “I thought people might be curious to know what it’s like to go through this,” Kinsella said in an interview with TV personality Robin Roberts . “I hope it’s full of optimism and love most of all.”","Sophie Kinsella, author of ""Confessions of a Shopaholic,"" dies at 55.

LONDON:





Scientists in Britain say ancient humans may have learned to make fire far earlier than previously believed, after uncovering evidence that deliberate fire-setting took place in what is now eastern England around 400,000 years ago.The findings, described in the journal Nature, push back the earliest known date for controlled fire-making by roughly 350,000 years. Until now, the oldest evidence had come from Neanderthal sites in what is now northern France dating to about 50,000 years ago.The discovery was made at Barnham, a Paleolithic site in Suffolk that has been excavated for decades. A team led by the British Museum identified a patch of baked clay, flint hand axes fractured by intense heat and two fragments of iron pyrite, a mineral that produces sparks when struck against flint. Researchers spent four years analysing to rule out natural wildfires. Geochemical tests showed temperatures had exceeded 700°Celsius, with evidence of repeated burning in the same location. That pattern, they say, is consistent with a constructed hearth rather than a lightning strike.Rob Davis, a Paleolithic archaeologist at the British Museum, said the combination of high temperatures, controlled burning and pyrite fragments shows “how they were actually making the fire and the fact they were making it.”Iron pyrite does not occur naturally at Barnham. Its presence suggests the people deliberately collected it because they understood its properties. Ash is easily dispersed, charcoal decays and heat-altered sediments can be eroded. At Barnham, the burned deposits were sealed within ancient pond sediments, allowing scientists to reconstruct how people used the site. Researchers say the implications for human evolution are substantial.","Scientists in Britain say ancient humans may have learned to make fire far earlier than previously believed.

TOI Correspondent from London:





A nurse of Indian origin has been sentenced to seven years and nine months in jail in Scotland for raping a colleague and sexually assaulting two others whilst working as a care home manager.Naijil Paul (47) was charged with the offences in 2018 but fled to Kochi, in Kerala, the day before his trial was due to begin on Dec 4, 2019, claiming his father was ill. The offences happened in 2018 when he was manager of Acorn Park Care Home in Glasgow. The care home was later forced to close following a damning report by the care watchdog.Paul, a British national originally from Kerala, was arrested in India in February and extradited to Scotland after six years evading justice.He pleaded guilty to rape and two charges of sexual assault at Glasgow high court in Oct and was sentenced on Monday.Paul will be on the sex offender list for life and is banned from going near any of the victims.The court heard how a 26 year-old colleague had returned from sick leave in April 2018, saying being in debt had been a “significant factor” in her coming back.A week later, Paul entered her office while she was alone and told her that she was at risk of losing her job due to the amount of time she had off.He told her that her job would be safe if she performed a sex act. Prosecutor Brian Bell added: ""He said that if she refused, it would be her fault that the kids would be homeless."" He then raped her and told her not to tell anyone as ""no one will believe you”.He also placed his hands on the hips of a 19-year-old colleague and tried to kiss her, saying, “I know you want this.” He later molested her.He also asked a 21-year-old care assistant if she was “serious” about her boyfriend and said, “I know you want it”, and tried to kiss her and molested her.Sentencing Paul, Lord Renucci said he had failed to take responsibility for his crimes and, on one occasion, had claimed he was doing the woman a favour.","Naijil Paul (47) was charged with the offences in 2018 but fled to Kochi, in Kerala, the day before his trial was due to begin.

A British Sikh man who founded the UK’s first memorial to Sikhs who served during World War I has received an OBE from the Princess Royal at St James’s Palace for services to the commemoration of Commonwealth soldiers who served Great Britain.Capt. Jay (Jagjeet) Singh-Sohal, who founded the WW1 Sikh Memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire in 2015, received the award from Anne, Princess Royal, at an investiture ceremony on Friday.Birmingham-born Sohal, an army reservist, founded the memorial to ensure that the sacrifice of Sikh soldiers in WWI was remembered at the 150-acre site, which has over 400 memorials.Sohal (42), a strategic communications expert from Royal Sutton Coldfield, attended the ceremony in uniform to be admitted as an officer into the Order of the British Empire. His wife, Sukhmani, and children watched as his name was called and he went up to Princess Anne and she pinned the OBE medal on him. He had earlier received a roll of parchment announcing the order from the King and Queen.“I told the Princess Royal how much it means to Sikhs to have a memorial where we can reflect on the Sikh contribution to both world wars and help tell that story. It’s humbling because it’s a rare occurrence for someone of my socio-economic background to receive such an accolade.My hope is it inspires more people from diverse backgrounds to serve our country,” he said.His paternal grandparents immigrated to Britain from Sang Dhesian in Phillaur, Jalandhar, and his maternal grandparents came from Kapurthala.“I don’t think they would ever have imagined their grandchild would enter such a British order,” Sohal told TOI. “They came to a Britain in the 1960s still rebuilding after the Second World War and to a community in industrial Birmingham that needed them. They were humble, hard-working people with strong faith-based values who earned an honest living whilst remembering God and giving what they could to help others. Their example instilled strong Sikh values in me. I take pride in dedicating this award to Sardar Maha Singh and Mohinder Kaur Sohal,” Sohal said.","Capt.

'Andrew sees himself as the victim'

Andrew's list of demands

Andrew wants to ensure his right to move around the estate freely, instead of being trapped within the bounds of whichever property he agrees to take.

Andrew wants to make sure he has an appropriate number of staff to cater to his needs.

Andrew wants a cook, housekeeper, gardeners, a butler, a driver and police security.

The house should be a substantial six or seven-bedroom house as he is already downgrading from his 30-room mansion, Royal Lodge.





Disgraced former prince Andrew Mountbatten Windsor whose royal title has been taken away because of his association with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is fighting it out with his brithe King Charles and made a bold demand of a six-bedroom mansion with full staff, police protection, as he is now moving out of the Royal Lodge Home. British broadcaster Helena Chard revealed to Fox News that Andrew does not believe he did anything wrong as he, since the beginning, denied the allegations of Virginua Giuffre who claimed Andrew raped her when she was a minor.Chard revealed that Andrew feels frustrated and now demanding a six- or seven-bedroom house on the Sardingham estate. “He feels he is entitled to all the staff he is accustomed to, including a cook, housekeeper, gardener, driver and police security.”“He may now be viewed as a commoner, but he has never lived like one,” Chard said. “If left to his own devices, I imagine he wouldn’t know how to look after himself. It’s probably easier for King Charles to privately pay for his brother to be looked after at this point, monitoring his whereabouts and preventing Andrew from causing further possible havoc.”Royal commentator Meredith Constant explained that Andrew sees himself as the victim because nothing has been proved against him; his titles were snatched because of the continued accusations against him, not because he was found guilty.","'Andrew sees himself as the victim' says British broadcaster Helena Chard.

Watch: Belgian skydiver Magali Folkner Braff’s daring swing above Dubai’s skyline,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/watch-belgian-skydiver-magali-folkner-braffs-daring-swing-above-dubais-skyline/articleshow/125946340.cms,"Belgian skydiver Magali Folkner Braff performed a world-first swing stunt 1,000 feet above Dubai’s skyline/Image: X

The stunt in focus

Skydiving, love, and a shared mission





Designing the red dress





Legacy and inspiration









Imagine sitting on a swing 1,000 feet above a bustling city, the wind rushing past, skyscrapers stretching below, and the sunrise painting the skyline in gold. This is exactly what Belgian skydiver Magali Folkner Braff did over Dubai, turning a breathtaking stunt into a celebration of skill, courage, and 15 years of skydiving history in the city.The 15th anniversary of Skydive Dubai provided the perfect backdrop for a world first stunt. Braff perched on a minimalist wooden swing attached to a powered airship, soaring over Dubai’s iconic skyline. Wearing a flowing red dress she designed herself, she alternated between sitting and standing while passing major landmarks, including the Burj Al Arab.A video of the stunt was shared by Dubai’s Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, showcasing Braff’s daring feat and the city’s breathtaking skyline.“Fifteen years ago, I was there when the first skydiving ever happened in Dubai. So, it was really emotional when they asked me to join them for the 15th anniversary stunt. I first couldn't believe it because there are a lot of other women in the sports. I'm super grateful that they offered me this opportunity,” Braff told Khaleej Times.The stunt required immense physical and mental focus. Standing on the swing engaged her arms and legs constantly, and soreness was inevitable.Yet her preparation and experience allowed her to maintain balance and grace throughout the performance.Magali Folkner Braff’s journey into skydiving began with love. She met her husband, Steve, through the sport, and the duo famously performed a skydiving stunt in their wedding attire in 2011. Since then, they have established an indoor skydiving facility in Belgium and run a consultancy that works with multiple skydiving centers worldwide.“It has always been a mission of mine to bring more women into the field. When I started out, there were very few women. But once you get the experience of floating in the air, you will love it. The indoor diving facility has been the first step for many women to then take up skydiving. Even in my stunt in Dubai, I wanted to bring a feminine touch to it. I hope it inspires more women and girls to take up the sport.”“I saw things that nobody has seen before. I was hanging there all alone on the swing. I think every little girl dreams of sitting on a swing hanging above in the sky. When I was up there, I felt like I was living in a postcard.”“It was magical because you're flying between the sea and the skyline of Dubai, and you see the sun rising between the buildings. Every second the light and the buildings are changing. The first landing, when I landed next to the Burj Al Arab, was emotional. I will never forget the relief and excitement I felt that everything went well.”“It was a technical, physical and emotional stunt. Mentally, I was prepared. Physically it was tough because standing on the swing requires a lot of muscle engagement. So, my arms and legs would get tired, but when you're on the swing, your focus takes over, and your body forgets the tired feeling.”The red dress Braff wore during the stunt was entirely her creation. She spent days selecting the right fabric and working closely with Skydive Dubai to balance style, functionality, and cultural respect.“I wanted to work with a dress designer, but they might not necessarily understand the requirements of skydiving, so I decided to design it myself. I drew a mood board and worked with Skydive Dubai. They finalised the red colour.”She carefully tailored the dress to her needs: “I wanted to respect the local culture and ensure that I wore a long sleeved and covered dress. I made it a little shorter on the right side so that it was easier for me to pull my parachute. I made it longer on the back so that the dress would create movement in the air.”Fabric choice presented a unique challenge. “You never know how the fabric will react to the airflow. That's a big challenge, and it's something that you won’t know until you're doing it. You can test it in the wind tunnel, but it always behaves differently when you're in those kinds of situations.”Beyond the stunt itself, Braff’s story is one of passion, dedication, and a desire to inspire others. Through her indoor skydiving facility and consultancy, she has made the sport accessible to women and encouraged them to pursue skydiving safely, gradually building confidence before tackling outdoor jumps.Her stunt over Dubai was not just a feat of skill but a statement: that skydiving can be elegant, daring, and inclusive, and that women can take their place in the world of extreme sports.","Belgian skydiver Magali Folkner Braff performed a world-first swing stunt 1,000 feet above Dubai’s skyline.

You accept that there are some sacrifices and there are some very good things that come along with it, too.

It’s not even worth the trip to run back upstairs. So we actually have a little bit of fun with it. And we thought that whole viral social media cycle was kind of funny.”“There are certainly ways in which it’s difficult on the family,” Vance said. “I’m not going to pretend that it isn’t. But it’s the sacrifice that we signed up for,"" he said.","JD Vance responded to a viral photo that claimed to be from a restaurant where JD was publicly fighting with his wife Usha Vance.
