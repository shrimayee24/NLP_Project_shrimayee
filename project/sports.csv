How time changes everything,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-time-changes-everything/articleshow/126077954.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. I once encountered an incident in an interview given by Thiru Waleswaran, the late son of V O Chidambaram Pillai — one of India’s greatest freedom fighters. In the interview, Waleswaran spoke of a visit to a govt office where he was asked to pay a bribe. He wished to challenge it legally, but he did not. He could not afford even the court fee. The irony was piercing. A system demanding a bribe from the son of a man who had sacrificed everything for the freedom of that very system. Martyrs are tested not only by their enemies, but by time itself. Their intentions are questioned, their sacrifices measured anew. History, like a ceaseless river, carries within it blood and compassion, rage and reconciliation, heroism and humility. When we scoop a single moment from its waters, we see only a fragment. But when we step back and watch the river flow across generations, history begins to speak in a deeper, humbler voice. Another incident I came across belongs to that deeper current. On the morning of June 17, 1911, at Maniyachi railway station, Vanchinathan, a young Tamil revolutionary, shot and killed Robert Ashe, the British collector of Tirunelveli. Moments later, Vanchi took his own life. One man fell as a representative of imperial authority; the other died as an embodiment of fierce resistance. Ashe’s wife Mary returned to her country with her four children — two daughters and two sons. Empires receded, flags changed, and the fury of that morning slowly settled into the footnotes of history. More than a century passed. Then, quietly, history curved back on itself. While researching the life of V O Chidambaram Pillai and the upheaval in Tirunelveli following his arrest, historian A R Venkatachalapathy came across records of the Ashe murder trial. His research led him not only to documents, but to people — Robert Ashe’s descendants: a grandson named after him, a granddaughter and other members. During a meeting, they raised a toast in memory of both Ashe and Vanchinathan. Later, they wrote a letter to the family of Vanchinathan and sent it through Venkatachalapathy. It was not a letter of accusation. Nor was it an attempt to rewrite the past. It was a letter of reconciliation. “On this day of sad but proud remembrance,” they wrote, “we extend a message of reconciliation and friendship to the Vanchi family. Vanchi was an idealist political campaigner whose zeal for the freedom of his beloved India sent Robert to his early grave. Moments later, he took his own young life… All who act fervently in the political arena, both ruler and oppressed, risk making mortal mistakes. We who are fortunate enough to live on must forgive and live in peace together.” Across a hundred years, the descendants of the ruler and the rebel reached out — not to justify, but to understand. It is here that a Kural quietly enters the river of thought. Valluvar writes: EnnaIMun NillanMin Thevveer PalarEnnaI MunNindru KalNin dravar. (Kural 771) Foes! Do not oppose my chief. Those who did so before, now are entombed. At first glance, it sounds like a cry of martial pride — a warrior hailing an unconquerable leader. But as writer Jeyamohan has reflected, who could such a chief truly be? No human ruler remains undefeated. No ideology escapes erosion. Perhaps the chief Valluvar speaks of is not a king or a commander, but time itself. Time alone defeats all — the tyrant and the martyr, the victor and the vanquished. It buries rage, exposes arrogance, humbles power, and sometimes ripens forgiveness. And yet, some acts endure: the courage of Vanchinathan, the sacrifice of Chidambaram Pillai, and a letter written by the descendants of Robert Ashe.","Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text.

NEW DELHI: India ended the T20I series against South Africa on a high by winning the fifth and final match and sealing the five-match series 3-1 on Friday at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.With this win, India have managed to extend their unbeaten streak. They are now on a streak of 10 consecutive series wins (including major tournaments).With the 4th T20I in Lucknow being abandoned earlier because of heavy fog, everyone wanted to see a full game, and the players didn't disappoint at all.India put up a big total of 231 for 5 after South Africa won the toss and chose to bowl.The batting effort was led by Tilak Varma and Hardik Pandya . Tilak played a steady and attacking knock, scoring 73 runs off 42 balls.Hardik provided the late surge with a quick 63 off just 25 balls, hitting five 4s and five 6s. Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma also gave India a strong start at the top.Chasing 232, South Africa began well. Quinton de Kock was in fine form and attacked the Indian bowlers from the start. South Africa matched India’s Powerplay score and stayed in the hunt.When Dewald Brevis joined de Kock, the visitors picked up momentum. The pair played freely and took South Africa to 118 runs at the halfway mark, putting pressure back on the Indian side.At that point, the match seemed evenly balanced. That is when India captain Suryakumar Yadav turned to his most trusted bowler, Jasprit Bumrah . Bumrah made an immediate impact by dismissing de Kock with a sharp return catch. That wicket changed the game.South Africa suddenly lost their rhythm. From 120 for 1, they slipped to 135 for 5 in a short span.The middle order could not recover from the collapse. Varun Chakaravarthy added to South Africa’s problems with an impressive spell, picking up four wickets and breaking key partnerships.While Varun took the wickets, Bumrah’s spell stood out in a high-scoring match. He finished with excellent figures of 2 wickets for just 17 runs in his four overs, controlling the game when it mattered most.South Africa eventually finished on 201/8 in their 20 overs, falling 30 runs short of the target.With this victory, India won the match by 30 runs and closed the series 3-1.

NEW DELHI: India all-rounder Hardik Pandya produced a blistering display of power-hitting to lead India to a commanding 30-run victory over South Africa in the fifth and final T20I in Ahmedabad on Friday, sealing the five-match series 3-1. Pandya’s explosive knock set the tone as India piled up a daunting 231 for 5.Pandya smashed a 16-ball half-century — the second-fastest by an Indian in T20 internationals — on his way to a stunning 63 off just 25 deliveries. His innings was laced with five boundaries and five towering sixes.The carnage was complemented by Tilak Varma, who continued his rich vein of form with a fluent 73. Together, the duo stitched a punishing 105-run partnership for the fourth wicket that completely wrested momentum away from the visitors.One of Pandya’s massive sixes led to an unexpected moment off the field when the ball struck a cameraman stationed near the boundary.Showing concern beyond the contest, Pandya immediately walked up to check on the cameraman’s well-being after his innings, ensuring he was attended to and even helping apply an ice pack.Pandya also hugged the cameraman, a gesture that quickly went viral and earned widespread praise from fans.In reply, South Africa began positively and remained in the chase as long as Quinton de Kock was at the crease. The left-hander scored a fighting 65, but once he was dismissed, the innings unravelled rapidly. Varun Chakravarthy spun a web around the middle order, claiming four wickets as South Africa lost seven wickets for 81 runs to finish on 201 for 8.Pandya’s all-round impact and match-defining innings earned him the Player of the Match award.""Winning games is what you play for and it’s always exciting when your contribution helps the team get over the line. No, I actually didn’t know (he has the second fastest fifty for India) until I got out and went back. Our social media guys told me I was the second-fastest,"" Pandya said.Watch the video here ""My first reaction was, “Ah, I missed the top spot!” But happy that Yuvi pa holds that record. Today I just felt it. I actually told my partner beforehand that I was going to step out first ball and try to hit it for six. I was confident it would come off,"" he said.""The situation suited my style; I backed myself and it worked. I took a calculated risk and thankfully it went my way. I’ve always enjoyed the challenge. No matter how many setbacks you face, the aim is to come back stronger, better, and make a bigger impact. When it all comes together, it feels satisfying. But the journey continues - the preparation, the planning, the hard work never stops,"" Pandya said.",India beat South Africa by 30 runs in the fifth and final T20I in Ahmedabad.

'Letter drafted with BJP mindset': Why Congress should not ignore message of sacked Odisha leader Mohammed Moquim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/letter-drafted-with-bjp-mindset-why-congress-should-not-ignore-message-of-sacked-odisha-leader-mohammed-moquim/articleshow/126060393.cms,"Letter To Sonia Gandhi Costs Ex Odisha MLA Moquim Party Post As Congress Cites Anti Party Activities

“The party's presence is shrinking geographically, organisationally, and even emotionally.”

“The party is losing its legacy not because of external opponents but due to decisions taken within.”

""A series of wrong decisions, misguided leadership choices, and the continued concentration of responsibility in the wrong hands have weakened the party from within. Rather than correcting these errors, we appear to be repeating them and the consequences are now visible to the entire nation.”

“The booth workers, block presidents, district-level leaders, who are truly the backbone of the party, feel ""unseen and unheard"" and this ""alienation"" makes electoral conversions nearly impossible.”

“There has been a growing distance between the leadership and the grassroots workers. Despite being an MLA, I was unable to meet Shri Rahul Gandhi ji for almost three years"".

NEW DELHI: The Congress has once again crushed dissidence with an “iron hand.” The expulsion of Odisha leader and former MLA Mohammed Moquim, after he went public about a letter he had written to Sonia Gandhi against the party leadership, was a given. The fact that the Congress justified its action and accused Moquim of operating with “BJP mindset” and working for the “interests of the saffron party” was also not a surprise.We have seen the grand-old-party go through this drill many times in the last 11 years as its political fortunes declined across the states. Several Congress leaders, both at the national level and at the state level, have openly targeted the top leadership and faced action. We all remember the group of 23 Congress leaders (G-23) who had in 2020 written a letter to Sonia Gandhi demanding “collective and inclusive leadership” in the party. While some of these dissidents were expelled, others voluntarily left the party but nothing changed in the way Congress functioned.This time, while the Congress may be perhaps right in questioning the intent of Mohammed Moquin, it would do well by not ignoring the message of the former MLA-turned-rebel by labelling him a BJP stooge. “Giving a letter to Sonia ji is acceptable, but releasing it to the press is not. This clearly indicates that he does not want to stay in the Congress,” Odisha Congress chief Bhakta Charan Das said justifying the party action.Ironically, Bhakta Charan Das was one of the targets of Moquim’s letter. The expelled MLA had questioned Das’s appointment as state party chief and his capability to deliver results in the state citing his past electoral performance. Moquim’s other targets were Rahul Gandhi and party chief Mallikarjun Kharge .So, what was Moquim’s communication? Here are some of the stinging statements that Moquim made in his letter:Well, a lot of what Moquim said in his letter have been raised before by many leaders who have parted ways with the grand old party in the past. Ironically, his remarks against the national leadership, especially on Rahul Gandhi’s inaccessibility and Kharge’s age, masked his pointed attacks on the party’s leadership in Odisha.Moquim highlighted the fact that the Congress had lost 6 consecutive elections in Odisha and expressed concern over the party's recent electoral performance in the Nuapada by-elections, where BJP defeated Congress by a huge margin despite the fact that Nuapada fell under the constituency of the present state Congress chief.“Under the leadership of Das, in the Nuapada by-election, his own parliamentary segment, the Congress lost by an unprecedented margin of nearly 83,000 votes. When a leader cannot secure trust in his own constituency, workers naturally lose confidence in his leadership and raise concerns in his ability to guide the party in Odisha,” the former MLA wrote in his letter.He also pointed out the failures of the Bhakta Charan Das’s predecessor Sarat Pattanayak: “Having lost six consecutive Lok Sabha elections, sometimes forfeiting his deposit, his appointment weakened morale at all levels. Under his leadership, the 2024 elections witnessed the lowest vote share in our history — just 13%. He again lost his own election, once more forfeiting his deposit,” he wrote questioning the party’s decision to appoint state chiefs who could not secure their own victories.Odisha, like many other states, has seen the Congress gradually decline to oblivion. The last time Congress won in Odisha was in 1995. Since then, it has been a story of decline. In 2000 it won 26 seats, 38 in 2004, 27 in 2009 and 10 in 2014. In 2019, the Congress tally in Odisha was reduced to single-digit 9 seats and could win 14 in 2024. The grand-old-party that ruled Odisha for several years, first ceded space to regional party Biju Janata Dal and then to the BJP - a story which has defined its existence in the last 10 years. The Congress has remained on the sidelines - doing little to revive the party’s lost glory in the state.The Congress in Odisha at present is perhaps in no position to challenge the ruling BJP. However, if the grand-old-party makes a sincere effort, it could make forays into the support base of the BJD, which took an unprecedented beating in the 2024 assembly elections and now depends heavily on an aging Naveen Patnaik for its revival. Unfortunately, there seems to be no Congress roadmap for revival. The state leadership could do better than holding protests over the court order on National Herald case if they want to pose any real challenge to the BJP or the BJD.The story of Congress decline is similar in several other states where the grand-old-party was first relegated to the sidelines by regional parties and then decimated to oblivion by the BJP. In Bihar, West Bengal, the Congress is struggling to stay relevant in electoral politics while the BJP has successfully made deep inroads.While Moquim is dumped, the Congress should not dump his message. The points raised by him merits attention - if the Congress hopes to revive.","Mohammed Moquim, a former Odisha MLA, was expelled from the Congress. He wrote a letter to Sonia Gandhi criticising the leadership of the party. The letter also criticised the Odisha Congress chief, Bhakta Charan Das. The party has been in decline since 1995.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126077395,imgsize-1220033,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"

"In Obama's 2025 playlist, a 13th-C Marathi prayer",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-obamas-2025-playlist-a-13th-c-marathi-prayer/articleshow/126085756.cms,"Ganavya’s rendition features on her 2025 album ‘Nilam’

Pilgrimage to YouTube: 'Pasayadan' enters global consciousness



From Pandharpur's pilgrimage trails to a former US president's 2025 playlist, a 13th-century Marathi prayer for universal brotherhood has leapt across time and tide to find a place in Barack Obama's annual music recommendations.Between international pop, hip-hop, and Afrobeats, Obama's playlist also features 'Pasayadan', a contemplative modern rendition by New York-born and Tamil Nadu-raised vocalist Ganavya, available on YouTube.Composed by Sant Dnyaneshwar, 'Pasayadan' is traditionally sung at the conclusion of the wari, the annual Varkari pilgrimage.Unlike many devotional compositions that emphasise personal salvation, the abhang casts its net wide, praying for the well-being of all beings, say cultural experts. Drawing from jazz, ambient textures, and South Asian classical traditions, Ganavya's rendition features on her 2025 album 'Nilam', co-produced by Nils Frahm at Berlin's Funkhaus studio. Viewed widely after Obama's nod, the track's YouTube music video, directed by Vali Chandrasekaran and featuring dancer David Adrian Freeland Jr, mirrors its contemplative spirit.In her 'Nilam' press statement and interviews around the release, Ganavya explained that 'Pasayadan' ""is an abhang from the pilgrimage tradition...one of the last prayers we'd sing... where the young saint prays for the sun to rise in all cold hearts..."" Describing it as a meditation on wisdom, compassion, and mutual sanctuary amid suffering, she had added that 'Nilam's' central theme is 'doing what we need to do to keep carrying on'.Marathi literary experts say the early lines of the abhang establish its moral vision: 'Je khalanchi vyankati sando, taya satkarmi rati vadho' - a plea for cruelty to dissolve and wisdom to grow. Its most enduring line, 'Bhootan paraspere pado, maitra jivanche', expresses a wish that all beings be bound in friendship. Another verse, 'Duritanche timir javo, vishva swadharma surye paaho', calls for darkness of suffering & ignorance to be dispelled and for world to be illumined by ethical light.For Marathi scholar Aparna Bedekar, who has a doctorate on sant sahitya, 'Pasayadan' represents the philosophical culmination of the Dnyaneshwari, the foundational text of the Bhagwat tradition. ""Pasayadan has emerged as its supreme prayer,"" she says. ""Through this prayer, the Varkari pilgrimage in Maharashtra came to embrace people across 18 communities, dissolving distinctions of caste, sect, modes of worship, and social hierarchy. "" Saints such as Gora Kumbhar, Sena Nhavi, Savata Mali, Narhari Sonar - and even Kanho Patra, a courtesan - became part of the pilgrimage, she notes, finding spiritual upliftment within its fold.Written in the spoken Marathi of the people, abhangs travelled not through texts alone but through memory, footfall, and voice. Satish Joglekar, author of 'Window to Ancient India', describes 'Pasayadan' as a prayer that transcends 'dharma, creed, and time', surpassing even the Upanishadic idea of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' because it urges individuals to actively become a refuge for others.The message resonates in the present day. ""The world is going through war and strife, so it is deeply relevant,"" says Prasad Kambli, director of acclaimed play 'Sangeet Dev Bababhali', which features abhangs by 17th-century poet-saint Sant Tukaram. 'Pasayadan' is about universal brotherhood. For Dnyaneshwar, this was the crux of Bhagavad Gita. What was articulated eight centuries ago is being heard again today in a different form, he adds.According to Siddha Yoga Path website, 'Pasayadan' is offered as a gift of divine grace meant for 'upliftment and benefit of all people', reflecting Dnyaneshwar's wish that compassion and joy reach every human life. The abhang, meaning 'unbroken', lies at the heart of Varkari tradition, which rejected ritual hierarchy and Sanskrit exclusivity in favour of lived ethics and communal devotion, say cultural experts.In modern times, the prayer entered public consciousness through Hridaynath Mangeshkar's composition, Now, Ganavya's version propels it into global spotlight.","'Pasayadan' is a 13th-century Marathi prayer for universal brotherhood.

NEW DELHI: Rancour and blame game inside Parliament made way for conviviality and cordiality at a customary post-parliamentary session get-together of govt functionaries, including PM Narendra Modi , and opposition MPs at Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla's chamber over tea on Friday.Congress and other opposition parties, which had skipped the meeting in a few previous sessions to convey their protest with happenings inside Parliament, were present in full force in an informal setting marked by Modi's wit and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's relaxed and easy presence.Sources said Priyanka made polite enquiries from Modi about his foreign trip, setting the tone for a rare convivial setting involving govt & opposition members, some of whom nudged for a longer session as the 15-day sitting of winter session, which was adjourned sine die, was one of the shortest ever.With her brother Rahul Gandhi, leader of opposition in LS being in Germany, first-time MP Priyanka was the main Congress voice in the meeting. Her confidence but easy manner was a change from Rahul's more aggressive and confrontational approach, a source said.Modi, sources said, asked opposition MPs about the session and praised RSP MP NK Premachandran, a Congress ally, for his diligence in parliamentary business.Several others too echoed the positive view of the seasoned parliamentarian. The PM made some light comments, evoking smiles from everyone.Sources said that Priyanka spoke about the health benefits that she got using a herb from her constituency Wayanad in Kerala.Modi used the Tamil greeting 'Vanakkam' for Manickam Tagore, and Priyanka quipped that she too has learnt a line in the language which means 'Vote for Congress', eliciting smiles from everyone, sources said. There was all-round laughter when a vocal opposition MP's pitch for a longer session drew a quip from govt side that a short sitting might have given his throat some rest.Birla, sources said, emphasised the opportunity given to so many of the members from different parties to speak on bills and different issues despite the relatively short session. This was acknowledged by members at the meeting. Lok Sabha's productivity was 111% in this session.Defence minister Rajnath Singh was among the ministers present at the meeting, which was also attended by Kumari Selja, Mohammad Jawed, from Congress, SP's Dharmendra Yadav, DMK's A Raja and NCP(SP)'s Supriya Sule, besides several BJP allies.After returning last night from his three-nation tour, Modi joined LS as Vande Mataram was played to mark the session's end moments after it convened at 11am. This Parliament session was headlined by the passage of VB-G RAM G bill to replace the UPA-era MGNREGA amid fierce opposition protest. The session marked by high productivity ended with govt and opposition benches trading punches.As Birla read out his valedictory statement in LS, opposition raised slogans of ""Mahatma Gandhi ki jai"" to highlight their protest against removal of Gandhi's name from the rural job guarantee scheme. A debate listed on air pollution, which was jointly moved by Priyanka, DMK's Kanimozhi, did not take place due to what a govt functionary described as ""bad atmosphere"" inside the House.","Congress and other opposition parties, which had skipped the meeting in a few previous sessions to convey their protest with happenings inside Parliament, were present in full force.

Craig Berube sends blunt message after Leafs’ collapse



Craig Berube does not hide behind polite answers. From his first day in Toronto, the Maple Leafs coach made it clear that accountability would not be optional. That approach collided with reality after a humbling night against Washington, when Toronto delivered its most lifeless performance of the season. The scoreboard told part of the story, but the body language told the rest. A proud roster looked disconnected, flat, and short on urgency when it mattered most.The loss also arrived at an uncomfortable moment. The Atlantic Division has offered no mercy, and Toronto’s recent stumble pushed the team toward unfamiliar territory. Expectations remain sky high, especially with a core built to contend now. When the Leafs failed to score for the first time since the spring playoffs, frustration spilled over. Berube did not soften the message, choosing honesty over comfort.After the final horn, attention quickly turned to the effort level of the team’s leaders. Berube’s response was brief, sharp, and impossible to ignore. “Ask those guys, not me,” he told reporters when questioned about the lack of passion, via Sportsnet on X. The comment landed like a slap of cold water. It was not dramatic, but it was deliberate. Berube shifted responsibility squarely onto the room, where it belongs.Auston Matthews sits at the center of that conversation. Through 28 games, his production has been respectable but not commanding. Fourteen goals and nine assists would satisfy many players, yet Toronto expects dominance from its captain. With a $15.2 million salary comes the burden of driving results, not just contributing. Being the fourth-highest point producer does not align with that standard.Still, context matters. Matthews has flashed his usual brilliance in stretches, reminding everyone why he is considered one of the league’s most dangerous scorers. The numbers underline his impact. Toronto owns a strong record when he scores and struggles badly when he does not. His presence shifts momentum, opens space, and fuels belief across the lineup.Berube’s message was not a condemnation. It was a challenge. The coach trusts his stars to respond, and history suggests Matthews will. When he finds his rhythm, the Leafs tend to follow. The season is far from lost, but moments like this often define it. Toronto’s response, starting with its captain, will determine whether this wake-up call sparks a rise or deepens the slide.Also Read: Maple Leafs fans on edge after reporter claims Auston Matthews trade talks may be closer than believed","Maple Leafs coach Craig Berube sent blunt message after humiliating 4-0 loss to Washington.

Travis Kelce needs some help with pronouncing Pokémon names while Jason Kelce was nailing the names right off the bat

In the latest promo of the New Heights podcast, Travis Kelce shows off his Pokémon Gold Pack. The Kansas City Chiefs star quietly opens the pack and waits for others to be patient. However, his older brother, Jason Kelce, immediately quips, “Wait, timeout. This is legitimately a Pokémon? You weren’t [----] around? You weren’t a big Pokémon fan. I was the Pokémon fan!” The H-back looks up and defends himself, saying, “Bro, I would out-Pokémon you in a [-----] Pokémon.” The older brother does not give up: “You don’t even know how to play!” Taylor Swift ’s sweetheart slipped into childlike wonder, cutely looking at the card and exclaiming, “What are you talking about? Oh look, Jason,!” Jason, unfamiliar with the name, shrugged and said it must be a new one. “If it’s not in the original 151,” he declared, it doesn’t count. Travis then unveiled a “.” Jason agreed, “That’s an original.” The energy continued as the 35-year-old enthusiast delightedly produced “,” then “.” A few more cards appeared, including “,” which Travis admired, calling it a “sweet card.” With a wave, another card, “,” was shown, encouraging Jason to exclaim, “That’s nice!”Later in the episode’s snippet, the 10-time Pro Bowler presents “” and comments, “Looks like she’s got the BBL going.” BBL stands for Brazilian Butt Lift, a cosmetic surgery that transfers fat from areas like the stomach or thighs to the buttocks for a fuller, rounder, hourglass look. When Travis callsa Pokémon card that looks as if she’s had a BBL, everyone bursts out laughing. The promo ends there. How did the fans react to this promo? Let’s find out.An X user quickly expressed the desire to have this episode every week: “I really do like this segment 🤣 now I need you guys to keep it up every week.” A fan spoke for everyone: ""I'm just flattered that Travis wanted to show us his pokemon s."" Another user suggested an interesting game: “I’d love for them to take up Pokemon Go for awhile and talk about all the random places they go to catch Pokémon.Like around stadiums and such.” A third user focused on how the Kelce brothers pronounced the Pokémon names: “🤣🤣🤣 Trav needs some help with the pronunciation but A for effort. Jason on the other hand was nailing the names right off the bat. Would like to see them play that Whose that Pokémon game and see how many they each get right 🤣🤣🤣. ”The Pokémon names are tricky to pronounce because they blend Japanese linguistic rules, such as adding vowels, with English-friendly sounds. This creates unique compound words from different concepts. For example, PIKACHU = PIKA + CHU. “PIKA” comes from the Japanese word “pikapika,” meaning an electric spark or flash, and “CHU” comes from “chuchu,” the sound a mouse makes. Another example: ARCANINE comes from “arcane” means mysterious and “canine” means dog.Also Read: Kylie Kelce reveals her girls weren’t interested in their first Chiefs home game despite having Taylor Swift beside them",Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce shows off his Pokémon Gold Pack.

Ryan O’Reilly’s comeback could be exactly what the Avalanche need to strengthen their Stanley Cup chances,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/ryan-oreillys-comeback-could-be-exactly-what-the-avalanche-need-to-strengthen-their-stanley-cup-chances/articleshow/126079611.cms,"Ryan O’Reilly linked to Avalanche return (Image via: Getty Images)

Key qualities Ryan O’Reilly offers that could transform Colorado’s championship outlook



Ryan O'Reilly & Dallas Green Talk Music and More Inside Toronto's Massey Hall | After The Horn

The Colorado Avalanche look like a team built for another deep Stanley Cup run, but in a Western Conference that punishes complacency, standing pat is rarely the best option. Even with an incredible 24-2-7 start, Colorado knows its margin for error shrinks the closer the playoffs get. Every contender searches for that one piece that pushes them from “dangerous” to “almost unstoppable,” and Ryan O’Reilly might be that missing piece.Dallas is already breathing down Colorado’s neck despite key injuries, proving how quickly the standings can tighten. That reality makes depth, experience, and playoff composure more valuable than ever. It is exactly why the Avalanche exploring a reunion with O’Reilly makes so much hockey sense.Head coach Jared Bednar wants another reliable center, someone who can anchor tough minutes when the postseason intensity spikes. Jack Drury has worked hard, and Ross Colton has filled gaps when needed, but neither brings the proven playoff pedigree O’Reilly offers. The Nashville Predators veteran knows how to control games, win battles, and step up when it matters most. That is not hype; it is backed by his 2019 Stanley Cup run and Conn Smythe-winning presence with the St.Louis Blues.O’Reilly’s history with Colorado only adds intrigue. Drafted by the Avalanche in 2009, he developed into a respected two-way force before moving on and shaping an impressive career. Now 34 and still productive with 27 points in 33 games, he remains a competitive, responsible, high-IQ player. His recent frustrations in Nashville don’t change that; if anything, they reveal his competitive edge and accountability.Financially, his $4.5 million cap hit and lack of a formal no-trade clause make him a realistic target. Nashville general manager Barry Trotz would likely respect O’Reilly’s input, but the fit is hard to ignore. Colorado gets leadership, faceoff strength, penalty-kill reliability, and a player who elevates when pressure peaks. O’Reilly gets a legitimate shot at another Stanley Cup with the franchise that launched his career.If Colorado truly wants to maximise a championship window that remains wide open, adding Ryan O’Reilly could be the move that transforms a great team into the one everyone else fears to face in hockey.Also Read: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-new-jersey-devils-linked-to-ryan-oreilly-while-edmonton-oilers-show-interest-in-tristan-jarry/articleshow/125920766.cms",Ryan O’Reilly has been linked to a return to the Colorado Avalanche.

Puka Nacua controversy and Hallie Aiono selfie dominate headlines



Hailee Aiono (Instagram)

Puka Nacua spent the past week living in two very different spotlights. One belonged to football, where he delivered a performance that usually defines careers. The other belonged to chaos, controversy, and the unforgiving speed of social media. By the time the Rams walked off the field Thursday night, the conversation around their Pro Bowl receiver had little to do with route running or box scores.The noise grew louder off the field. Viral clips, deleted posts, fines, and personal history collided into one messy news cycle. By Friday morning, another unexpected moment added fuel. A selfie from his former partner sent the internet buzzing, proving again how quickly personal lives can eclipse professional brilliance.The storm began earlier in the week during an online interview with popular streamers Adin Ross and N3on. What started as casual banter quickly spiraled. One clip showed Nacua practicing a celebration that drew criticism for being offensive to Jewish people. The backlash was swift, and he issued an apology before the Rams even kicked off.Other remarks from the same session kept circulating. He spoke about avoiding marriage because “they all cheat,” and even dragged pop culture into the mix by blaming Taylor Swift for the Kansas City Chiefs’ struggles this season.None of it helped his image as game day approached.Then came Thursday night. Nacua was dominant, hauling in 12 catches for 225 yards and two touchdowns against Seattle. Still, frustration boiled over. After criticizing officials in the interview, he doubled down following the narrow loss, posting sharp comments aimed at referees. The post disappeared quickly, but the league did not ignore it. A $25,000 fine arrived Friday.As that unfolded, Hallie Aiono stepped into the spotlight. She shared a selfie wearing a shirt that read “GOOFY FOR YOU,” instantly grabbing attention. The timing felt deliberate to fans who remembered their breakup earlier in 2025. The split ended a three-and-a-half-year relationship and included a public paternity test confirming Nacua as the father of their son, Kingston.Despite the past, there have been signs of peace. Aiono was spotted at his recent game, and Nacua later shared a tender moment with his son. Even so, one week of headlines showed how easily personal moments and public missteps can overshadow excellence on the field.Also Read: Puka Nacua gesture explained: Rams star breaks silence with apology after antisemitic controversy goes viral","Rams receiver Puka Nacua has been in the spotlight this week.

Madison Beer explains why online hate hits harder on bad mental health days

Madison Beer balances vulnerability, new music, and public life with Justin Herbert

Madison Beer is not sugarcoating it anymore. Justin Herbert’s girlfriend used an Instagram Q&A this week to speak plainly about how online hate affects her mental health, and her words landed hard with fans who are used to seeing polished photos instead of personal fallout.The singer did not frame it as a one-off bad day or a celebrity complaint. She described a recurring struggle, one that changes depending on her emotional state and one that still cuts deep, even after years in the public eye.Beer addressed the topic after a follower asked how she deals with bullying online. She said her response depends on how grounded she feels that day and whether life outside social media feels stable.“If I'm feeling good in my personal life, having a good day etc, it's much easier for me to brush it off and focus on what's really in front of me these days, which is growth I'm really proud of,” Beer wrote. “But we all know the truth is most days aren't perfect like that. I struggle with my mental health a lot, so it is really painful to go online and read so much negativity about yourself, for anyone. But especially when you are already struggling.She also pushed back on the idea that public figures should simply accept cruelty as part of the job. Beer asked people to think about the weight of what they post and reminded followers that everyone is dealing with something unseen.“It shouldn't matter if someone is struggling or not / wish people were kinder. It's so easy to think but just do really wish people would take the weight of their words, that we've all just human beings living life for the first time and not every opinion u have needs to be shared. Everyone is dealing with something and I don't personally wanna take part in just attacking or ripping others apart just because I could.”Beer added that grounding herself in her own identity and leaning on people who know her personally helps, even though the judgment never fully disappears.The Q&A came just one day after Beer posted photos teasing her upcoming album, Locket, which is set to release on Jan. 16. She captioned the post, “My album comes out in one month,” signaling a major professional moment running parallel to a very personal admission.Beer has previously spoken about feeling supported in her relationship with Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert. On the “Call Her Daddy podcast” on Dec. 10, she described the stability she feels behind the scenes.“I feel like taken care of in a way that I can break down and like I have someone to lean on,” Beer said. “And I think that’s important.”The couple publicly confirmed their relationship on Oct. 5 with a sideline kiss during the Chargers’ game against the Washington Commanders. Since then, Beer has appeared at games and shared glimpses into Herbert’s life away from football, including a recent visit to his family’s animal farm in Oregon.The timing matters. Beer is preparing to release deeply personal music while also navigating the scrutiny that comes with dating a franchise quarterback. Her comments suggest that public visibility does not dull the impact of online cruelty. If anything, it amplifies it.For fans who consume celebrity lives in clips and captions, Beer’s message cuts through that distance. The hate does not stay on the screen. It follows people offline.","Justin Herbert’s girlfriend used an Instagram Q&A this week to speak plainly about how online hate affects her mental health.

C.J. Nitkowski believes market depth is shaping Bo Bichette’s free agency



Blue Jays Trade Rumors: Who’s In, Who’s Out?

C.J. Nitkowski has spent years inside major league clubhouses, and he knows when a quiet market is part of a plan rather than a problem. The former MLB pitcher believes teams this offseason are operating with patience, shaped by depth and long-term thinking. Speaking on Toronto Sports Rush, Nitkowski framed the current free-agent landscape as one defined by options, not urgency.His remarks gained attention because they offered context to a situation that has puzzled many observers. Among the players affected is Bo Bichette, coming off a productive 2025 season. While Bichette’s numbers speak for themselves, Nitkowski’s view suggests the slower pace around his free agency reflects how teams are reading the broader market rather than reassessing the player himself.""The one thing about teams that are looking at Bo Bichette as a second baseman that they know they can keep in mind, is that next year, the second base market is pretty flush,"" Nitkowski said.From Nitkowski’s perspective, that awareness changes how teams behave. Clubs are not just reacting to what is available now. They are weighing what is coming next.""There are some really good options. Nico Hoerner is going to be a free agent.(Brandon) Lowe is going to be a free agent next year.There's a pretty long list.""That expected depth gives teams confidence. When front offices believe alternatives will be available, the need to move quickly fades.""Ozzie Albies, potentially, could be a free agent. There's some pretty good ones. Gleyber Torres out there as well."" With those names in mind, Nitkowski suggested teams may feel comfortable waiting rather than stretching budgets or timelines.""For the teams looking at Bo as a second baseman, I don't think they're going to necessarily overextend themselves, because if they feel like they have another solution, at least short term for 2026, they know there's a really good market out there for 2027.""The takeaway from Nitkowski’s comments is measured but clear. There is little doubt about Bichette’s production with the Toronto Blue Jays. The slower pace has more to do with the market than the player. Teams believe they have alternatives coming, and that belief has allowed them to hold off. Nitkowski views the situation as a matter of timing, not talent.Also read: Why Bo Bichette remains unsigned as the Toronto Blue Jays, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Boston Red Sox make their moves","C.J.

Career night ends in frustration for Rams star

Sean McVay stands by Puka Nacua

Also Read:

Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua once again found himself at the center of controversy following Thursday night’s dramatic loss to the Seattle Seahawks, as frustration over officiating spilled onto social media before being quickly walked back.Despite producing the best game of his young NFL career, Nacua’s postgame reaction overshadowed what should have been a headline performance.Nacua was nearly unstoppable against Seattle, finishing with 12 receptions for 225 yards and two touchdowns. The second-year receiver repeatedly torched the Seahawks’ secondary and played a key role as the Rams built a commanding 16-point lead.However, Los Angeles watched that advantage disappear, eventually falling 38-37 in overtime. A late officiating decision that went against the Rams became a major talking point, drawing visible frustration from players on the sideline and fans watching at home.Shortly after the final whistle, Nacua took to X (formerly Twitter) and appeared to take a jab at NFL officials. “Can you say I was wrong,” he wrote, adding, “Appreciate you stripes for your contributions. Lol.”The post was deleted within minutes, but screenshots spread rapidly, ensuring the message reached a wide audience.The timing and wording were widely seen as a direct reference to a controversial late-game call that helped Seattle extend the contest and ultimately secure the win.When asked about the tweet after the game, Nacua acknowledged that emotions got the better of him. “It was just a lack of awareness and frustration after a tough, intense game,” he said.The wide receiver admitted that while players often feel inconsistencies in officiating, those thoughts should remain internal. “There are comments that I should definitely say in the locker room,” Nacua explained. “My job is to focus on my technique so there’s no issue with the call.”Rams head coach Sean McVay was initially unaware of the deleted post during his postgame press conference, declining to comment on something he had not yet seen. However, McVay has already publicly backed Nacua earlier in the week following separate controversy stemming from a livestream appearance.“I know this guy’s heart,” McVay said previously. “He’s a great kid who’s continuing to learn about the platform that he has. We’re going to put our arm around him and help him grow.”Public criticism of officiating has historically drawn fines from the league, and Nacua’s latest comments could again put him on the NFL’s radar. The situation comes at an awkward time, as the receiver had only just issued an apology earlier in the week for unrelated remarks.For the Rams, the priority remains correcting late-game execution after another painful loss. For Nacua, the message is becoming clearer: his elite on-field performances are undeniable, but staying out of controversy off the field will be just as important as the season progresses.","Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua took to Twitter after Thursday night's loss to the Seattle Seahawks.

As Christmas 2025 approaches, New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs finds himself enjoying the festive season on and off the field. Known for his elite production and larger-than-life personality, Diggs has had a busy year that blends football, family, philanthropy, and holiday cheer.As of Christmas 2025, Stefon Diggs’ net worth is estimated to be around $60 million, built through a combination of NFL contracts, performance incentives, and endorsement deals. Diggs continues to earn millions annually from football alone, with his 2025 salary reported at approximately $2.9 million, excluding bonuses and off-field income.Beyond the NFL, Diggs has strengthened his financial portfolio through brand partnerships, most notably with Jordan Brand, further cementing his status as one of the league’s most marketable wide receivers. His longevity, consistency, and strong personal brand have helped him remain financially secure deep into his NFL career.This Christmas, Diggs appears to be embracing a more grounded, family-focused celebration. His partner, Cardi B, recently shared on social media that their daughter Kulture’s Christmas wish list featured affordable fashion items rather than luxury brands, a moment that resonated with fans online.Despite Diggs’ immense wealth, the couple has shown a willingness to keep certain aspects of family life refreshingly simple. That said, Cardi B is also known for going all out during the holidays, often decorating multiple Christmas trees and gifting extravagant surprises to her children, making their celebrations a mix of modest requests and grand traditions.While Diggs has not publicly confirmed a major international vacation for Christmas 2025, reports and social media glimpses suggest a relaxed holiday period split between family time and light travel. With the NFL season demanding both physical and mental focus, Diggs has typically opted for warm-weather getaways or quiet luxury retreats during brief breaks, prioritising recovery and quality time over flashy trips.Any extended vacation plans are expected to come after the post-season, depending on the Patriots’ campaign and Diggs’ on-field commitments.Off the field, Diggs has continued to invest time in community initiatives through his Diggs Deep Foundation, which focuses on youth empowerment and community wellness. Earlier this month, he hosted a holiday wellness event for mothers and children at Gillette Stadium, underlining his growing role as a community leader.At home, Diggs is balancing fatherhood, philanthropy, and professional football, while navigating life in the spotlight alongside Cardi B. As Christmas 2025 unfolds, the Patriots star appears financially secure, personally fulfilled, and focused on what matters most: family, health, and legacy.With his net worth steady and his personal life evolving, Stefon Diggs enters the holiday season not just as an NFL star, but as a figure redefining balance beyond the game.","New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs' net worth is estimated to be around $60 million.

Patrick Mahomes’ injury, surgery, and the timeline Kansas City is now staring at

Randi Mahomes thanked supporters as Patrick Mahomes posted ‘why this had to happen’

Patrick Mahomes is already in rehab after a season-ending left knee injury, and his mom is making it clear she is reading every message that comes in. Randi Mahomes posted public thanks this week after the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback underwent surgery, telling supporters she and her family appreciate the prayers and the words of encouragement.The update lands at the worst possible moment for Kansas City. Mahomes tore his left ACL and LCL in Week 15 against the Los Angeles Chargers, and the loss pushed the Chiefs out of playoff contention for the first time in the Mahomes era.Athlon Sports reported Mahomes suffered the injury against the Chargers and later underwent surgery on Monday. The report said the procedure was performed by Dallas Cowboys head physician and orthopedic surgeon Dan Cooper. Kansas City placed Mahomes on injured reserve, and the quarterback has already begun rehab.The medical timeline matters because it shapes everything the Chiefs do next. Chiefs vice president of sports medicine and performance Rick Burkholder said the recovery expectation is nine months, though it could swing by a month or two in either direction, per USA Today. That puts Mahomes’ 2026 season availability at the center of every offseason decision, even if the team stays quiet publicly.Mahomes’ injury also closes the book on a season where he still produced. Athlon Sports noted he recorded 22 passing touchdowns and five rushing scores in 2025 before the knee gave out. Now the conversation shifts from stats to survival: how Kansas City steadies itself without the player it has been built around, and how quickly Mahomes can get back to full strength.The Chiefs missing the playoffs is the loudest headline. Athlon Sports called the Chargers loss the final blow to Kansas City’s postseason hopes. It is also a rare swing in the Mahomes era. Andy Reid’s teams had been a January constant, and Athlon Sports noted Kansas City reached the Super Bowl five times in the last six seasons, winning three. That is the standard Mahomes and the Chiefs are judged by, and it is why this injury lands like a crisis instead of a routine rehab story.The emotional side of this hit the public right away. TMZ reported Mahomes posted a message on X after the injury report became public, and he did not try to dress it up.“Don’t know why this had to happen,” Mahomes wrote. “And not going to lie, it’s hurts. But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again.” He also addressed the fan base directly in the same TMZ report.“Thank you, Chiefs kingdom, for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I will be back stronger than ever.”TMZ noted Randi Mahomes shared his message with a heart and prayer emoji, and her own posts kept the focus on gratitude. Athlon Sports reported she wrote a public message while also sharing about her “Home for the Holidays” event for the Kansas City community.“Thank you all for the prayers and kind messages for Patrick. We truly appreciate every one of them,” she wrote.Athlon Sports also reported she added a second note on her Instagram Stories. “Thank you for lifting Patrick up in prayer. We’re so thankful for this community.”That is the cleanest read on the moment. The family is not selling false optimism. They are acknowledging reality, leaning on faith, and keeping the message tight: Mahomes has surgery behind him, rehab in front of him, and a fan base watching every step.For the Chiefs, the next part is not dramatic. It is practical. Mahomes’ rehab is the story now, and the rest of the roster gets judged by how it responds to life without him. The one piece of good news, per Athlon Sports, is that Mahomes is on track to return to full health when the 2026 NFL season comes around. The rest is patience, and nine months can feel like forever when you are Kansas City.",Randi Mahomes thanked supporters as Patrick Mahomes posted ‘why this had to happen’ Mahomes tore his left ACL and LCL in Week 15 against the Los Angeles Chargers.

Maple Leafs fans on edge after reporter claims Auston Matthews trade talks may be closer than believed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/maple-leafs-fans-on-edge-after-reporter-claims-auston-matthews-trade-talks-may-be-closer-than-believed/articleshow/126059895.cms,"Auston Matthews trade rumor (Getty Images)

Auston Matthews and the pressure point Toronto cannot ignore

The mood around the Maple Leafs has shifted from confidence to caution. Toronto entered the season expecting its captain to set the pace, yet nights now pass where the scoreboard stays silent for stretches that feel unfamiliar. Auston Matthews still generates chances, still competes hard in all three zones, but goals no longer arrive with the same inevitability. In a market that measures greatness shift by shift, that absence has grown louder than any cheer.What makes this moment heavier is timing. Toronto is not rebuilding or experimenting. This is a team built to win now. When production stalls at the center of that plan, anxiety spreads quickly. Conversations that once felt unthinkable are now whispered openly, not because Matthews has fallen off, but because expectations around him remain sky high.The tension spiked when Leafs reporter Howard Berger suggested the organization will not move forward until Auston Matthews asks for a trade, possibly by this year’s trade deadline. That idea alone rattled the fanbase. Matthews has been the franchise constant for nearly a decade.Imagining Toronto without him feels like pulling a load-bearing wall from the house.On the ice, the frustration has roots. Auston Matthews continues to win faceoffs, backcheck, and handle defensive responsibility. Yet Toronto pays him to swing games offensively. At five-on-five, his line has not consistently owned shifts. On the power play, the dominance that once felt automatic has faded into predictability. The looks are there, but the finish has gone missing.That gap between effort and outcome feeds scrutiny. In Toronto, leadership is judged through goals when the stakes rise. When scoring dries up, every shift becomes a test of authority and legacy. Nick Kypreos tried to strike a more hopeful tone in the Toronto Star, but optimism struggles to breathe when results lag behind reputation.The coaching staff has searched for answers. Different wingers, altered looks, and tactical tweaks have come and gone. The puck still moves well, but the instinctive scoring touch that defined Matthews has not returned with consistency. There is also quiet talk of tension with coach Craig Berube, another layer that complicates an already delicate situation.Trading a captain in his prime is not standard practice. Neither is standing still while doubt grows inside a contender. Toronto management now faces a narrow path where action and inaction both carry consequences. Whether Berger’s report proves prophetic or premature, it captures how fragile this stretch feels.Matthews remains elite. Yet in this market, elite alone no longer settles the noise. The next few months will decide more than standings. They will define how this era is remembered, and whether Auston Matthews and Toronto find clarity together or part under pressure.Also Read: Are Auston Matthews and Craig Berube drifting apart as Maple Leafs struggles spark tense locker-room speculation?","The mood around the Maple Leafs has shifted from confidence to caution.

How Matthew Tkachuk and Brady Tkachuk built their net worth through NHL contracts



Matthew Tkachuk's Lifestyle IS NOT What You Think! (2025)

Everything You Need to Know About Brady Tkachuk Lifestyle Net Worth 2025

To Matthew Tkachuk's net worth 2025, Brady Tkachuk's net worth, NHL salary, contracts, endorsements, and earnings discussions have become prominent among hockey aficionados who want to keep track of the financial rise of the Tkachuk brothers. Being two of the most renowned power forwards of the NHL, Matthew and Brady Tkachuk are not only determining the outcomes of the games on the ice but also making huge amounts of money through their long-term contracts and, of course, the high-profile brand partnerships they have across North America.Even though both brothers are characterized by the same competitive spirit, their financial paths look different in terms of magnitude and configuration. Matthew Tkachuk has earned superstar-level money with the Florida Panthers, while Brady Tkachuk still has to build his financial profile being the face of the Ottawa Senators. The two of them, along with their contracts and endorsements, show how the modern NHL star maximizes his value not just through goals and assists.In the year 2025, Matthew Tkachuk’s net worth is expected to be around $60 million, which will mainly come from the eight-year, $76 million contract he signed with the Florida Panthers in 2022.The agreement has a lot of bonuses upfront, with about $68 million being paid through signing bonuses, which gives him long-term financial security. His value per year is $9.5 million, which makes him one of the top-paid forwards in the league.

As per the reports from sources like NHL.com and ESPN, he has managed to get endorsements from companies such as BODYARMOR, Perry Ellis, CarShield, Amerant Bank, Tim Hortons, and Sherwood. Such collaborations not only contribute millions to his net worth but also play a big role in the formation of his off-ice image, consisting of leadership and intensity.Conversely, Brady Tkachuk’s net worth in 2025 is predicted to be around $10 million, with a strong upward trend. His financial backing is the result of a contract with the Ottawa Senators in 2021 for seven years at $57.5 million, which he signed that year. This deal guarantees an average yearly salary of around $8.2 million, and his base salary has been climbing to $10.5 million in the past few seasons.

While Matthew has amassed a $60 million jet set, Brady is gradually reaching the same pocket. Both of them will be displaying how top-notch NHL professionals turn out to be very large money legacies in 2025 through their skill, right moment, and wise deals.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumours: Phillip Danault, Ryan Strome, Mason Marchment linked to potential trades","Matthew and Brady Tkachuk are two of the most renowned power forwards of the NHL.

Why three-time Super Bowl champion Michael Irvin compares Cowboys’ performance to a ‘failing grade’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-three-time-super-bowl-champion-michael-irvin-compares-cowboys-performance-to-a-failing-grade/articleshow/126083937.cms,"Here's what Michael Irvin said about the Dallas Cowboys.

Why three-time Super Bowl champion thinks the Dallas Cowboys are failing



The Cowboys are having a rough season. After a brutal loss to the Minnesota Vikings, the Dallas Cowboys' playoff hopes have been drastically slashed. It’s not impossible for them to be in the playoffs but at 6-7-1, their chances sit at just 1 per cent. Dak Prescott remains hopeful, though Dallas would need an unlikely late-season surge to reach the postseason.Hall of Fame wide receiver and three-time Super Bowl champion Michael Irvin recently spoke about the Cowboys and didn’t hold back when discussing his former team. He appeared on the Dan Patrick Show and offered a blunt assessment of the Cowboys. Dan Patrick asked him to grade the 2025 version of Dallas, and Irvin responded hilariously.“There is no grade to give outside of a failure grade,” Irvin responded. “... I don’t want to hear how many records you broke this year, I don’t want to hear what you did in statistics. I want to hear wins and losses, and are you in the playoffs with a chance to win a ring—and they are not. That’s a failing grade.”Michael Irvin himself of course, has had a legendary run with Dallas Cowboys. He was known as ""The Playmaker,"" and won three Super Bowl rings with the team in the 1990s, as part of ""The Triplets"" with Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith, in ‘93, ‘94 and ‘96.The Cowboys’ postseason isn’t exactly a shock for the fans. The team’s woes have hung over them for nearly 30 years. Dallas hasn’t advanced beyond the divisional round since its last Super Bowl win in 1995. Cowboys veteran Dak Prescott himself has led the team to the playoffs six times, but the tricky postseason run always seems to get in the way of the team’s ultimate victory.Irvin noted that Dallas has made progress in certain areas this season, and he reminded fans of certain upgrades like the addition of George Pickens and a stronger defensive line. But he still believes the Cowboys should be more proactive and strategic about approaching playoffs and function more cohesively as a team.","The Dallas Cowboys are 6-7-1 and have a 1 per cent chance of making the playoffs.

Curious case! Why Ajit Agarkar & Co. continue to ignore Ishan Kishan

NEW DELHI: With just 50 days to go for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka, Team India’s numbers no longer scream dominance, even if recent results offer some comfort.As defending champions, India began their post 2024 title run in ruthless fashion, winning 17 of their next 20 T20Is. Nine scores crossed the 200 mark, five of them were 220 plus and three breached 245 mark, underlining a batting unit operating well ahead of the curve. That curve has flattened since the 2025 Asia Cup. India’s overall strike rate has dropped to 141.64, a worrying decline for a side that had redefined intent at the top of the order.Since the Asia Cup, Abhishek Sharma remains the only Indian batter striking above 145. Everyone else has slowed down, and the biggest talking point has shifted to the new opening combination. The Sanju Samson–Abhishek Sharma partnership set the tone for India’s surge after the 2024 World Cup. Across 13 innings, the pair scored at a run rate of 10.05 and averaged 25.38. That early momentum allowed India to sustain a strike rate of 154.56 through the middle overs and 169.39 at the death.The dynamic shifted when Shubman Gill returned to the playing XI as part of the management’s long-term leadership plan. Samson, who amassed 417 runs in 12 T20Is at a strike rate of 183.70 with three centuries at the top, was pushed down the order.His Asia Cup returns were mixed, though he still finished as India’s third highest run-getter with 132 runs, behind Abhishek Sharma’s 314 and Tilak Varma’s 213. A solitary outing in Australia at No. 3 ended without impact, after which Samson was dropped from the playing XI.Gill’s own returns since his comeback have been underwhelming. In 15 matches, he has scored 291 runs at an average of 24.25 and a strike rate of 137, without a single fifty. The numbers point to a batter searching for rhythm at a time when India’s top order needs clarity more than caution.Speaking at the JioStar Press Room ahead of the upcoming T20 World Cup, former India batter Robin Uthappa , who was part of the 2007 World Cup winning squad, was clear about the balance he wants to see. “I would not personally like to tinker with the opening combination,” JioStar expert Uthappa said. “What I would like is to see Sanju bat at No. 3, Tilak at No. 4 and Surya at No. 5. Suryakumar Yadav plays his best cricket outside the powerplay. Tilak Verma needs a pivotal role in this team and that is why No. 4 suits him.”Uthappa explained that placing Tilak Verma at No. 4 and Suryakumar Yadav at No. 5 would free up the top order. “This gives the openers and the No. 3 position the authority to go hard,” he said.He then addressed Gill’s role directly. “You can have someone like Shubman Gill play that sheet anchor role that India desperately need right now, so everyone else can play aggressively around him. India can still use the hyper aggressive batting template that has worked for them, while Gill bats at a 140 to 150 strike rate, which is where he thrives. It is similar to the role Virat Kohli played in the last T20 World Cup. ”The concerns, however, extend beyond Gill alone. India’s intent has also dipped due to Suryakumar’s prolonged lean patch. In 2025, the captain has scored just 213 runs from 20 matches at an average of 14.20 and a strike rate of 125.29. With both captain and vice-captain struggling for form, pressure has inevitably shifted on to the middle order.At the same interaction, former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan stressed that the phase of experimentation must now come to an end. “There has been a lot of talk about chopping and changing,” JioStar expert Pathan said. “I think the team management was trying to understand who can play different roles, but this is not the time to experiment. When the World Cup starts, it has to be very clear who is batting at what position.”That experimentation has been evident. In the last two T20I series against Australia and South Africa, India tried multiple options at No. 3, including Sanju Samson, Shivam Dube, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma and even Axar Patel.Pathan also did not hide his concern over Suryakumar’s form. “As a captain, you need to bat well and be in form going into a big tournament like the World Cup,” he said. “The concern is not just that he is not scoring runs, but that his strike rate is also going down. His strike rate is generally around 166, but over the last year it has come down to around 119.”Referring to Abhishek Sharma’s high risk approach at the top, Pathan said that such a style will inevitably lead to occasional early dismissals and that is acceptable. “He does not need to change,” Pathan said. “That is why he has been successful. But then the pressure comes on the middle order. When you have an in-form Suryakumar Yadav, it becomes a completely different game. Hopefully, he finds a way to stay a bit longer at the crease and get those runs before the World Cup. ”What Team India needs right now is certainty of roles. With the World Cup fast approaching, rediscovering tempo, fixing roles and getting their leaders back among the runs may matter far more than any tactical tweak.","Team India's numbers no longer scream dominance, even if recent results offer some comfort. India’s overall strike rate has dropped to 141.64, a worrying decline for a side that had redefined intent at the top of the order. The biggest talking point has shifted to the new opening combination.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126079854,imgsize-117706,width-400,resizemode-4/ind-vs-sa-5th-t20i-match.jpg"

Fans throw objects, vandalise stadium after Messi leaves early | Hyderabad next

Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has taken legal action against Uttam Saha, the president of the Argentina Fan Club of Kolkata, by filing a defamation case seeking Rs 50 crore in damages. The move follows allegations made by Saha linking Ganguly to the controversy surrounding the chaotic Yuva Bharati Stadium event during Lionel Messi ’s visit to Kolkata on Saturday, December 13.The complaint, lodged at Lalbazar, states that Saha’s public remarks were baseless and caused serious damage to Ganguly’s reputation. Ganguly has termed the accusations “false, malicious, offensive and defamatory”, alleging that they were made with full knowledge of the harm they could cause to his public image.Currently serving as the president of the Cricket Association of Bengal, Ganguly clarified in his complaint that he had no official role in organising or managing the Messi event. He maintained that his presence at the stadium was strictly as an invited guest and that he had no involvement in the planning or execution of the programme.The legal action adds a new dimension to the fallout from Messi’s much-hyped visit to Kolkata, which descended into disorder and sparked widespread criticism.Ganguly’s complaint specifically challenges claims made by Saha that he acted as a middleman in the management of the event, which was overseen by its main organiser, Satadru Dutta.“Serious allegations are being made publicly without any factual basis,” Ganguly stated in his filing. His legal representatives have since issued a notice to Saha, demanding a retraction of the statements and compensation for the alleged damage caused.Following the chaos at the venue, event organiser Satadru Dutta was detained for questioning by authorities. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee later issued a public apology on X, expressing regret over the mismanagement of the event and apologising to Lionel Messi as well as football fans in Kolkata who were unable to see the Argentine star properly.During the event at Yuva Bharati Stadium, Ganguly was present in a separate area of the venue. As the situation in the stands deteriorated, he was seen exiting the stadium, visibly disappointed by the turn of events.The Messi programme was widely criticised for poor planning and crowd control, leaving fans frustrated after paying hefty ticket prices in anticipation of a memorable experience. Instead, scenes of disorder dominated coverage, drawing national and international attention to shortcomings in the organisation of high-profile sporting events in India.The incident also revived debates around VIP culture at major sports functions. Reports and videos highlighted limited fan interaction with Messi, while officials and invited guests occupied the field area, further fuelling anger among supporters and adding to the backlash surrounding the event.",Sourav Ganguly has filed a defamation case against Uttam Saha.

Poll Should Bumrah participate in ODIs before the 2026 T20 World Cup? Yes, he should play ODIs. No, focus on T20Is.

Since the 2025 edition of the Asia Cup , India' spearhead Jasprit Bumrah has missed just three T20Is. While he was rested for the final group game against Oman and dead rubber versus Sri Lanka in the multi-nation tournament, Bumrah didn't feature in the third T20I versus South Africa due to personal reasons. Apart from these three games, he has been on the park for 13 T20Is and even played four home Tests against West Indies and South Africa, respectively.The 50-day countdown to India's title defence at 2026 T20 World Cup has begun and the biggest priority for the thinktank right now is to keep their Most Valuable Player (MVP) fresh and fit for the tournament. There are five more T20Is against New Zealand next month before the focus shifts to the World Cup and the management has made up their mind to not make the bowler play the three ODIs starting January 11. It is understood that the coaching group has already had discussions in this regard and don't want to compromise on the player's readiness for the multi-nation tournament to be held in India and Sri Lanka during February and March.""The management is very clear with regards to Bumrah. People outside can create all sorts of fitness theories but it's very simple - you prioritise the formats and matches you want Bumrah to feature in.It was important from a team's perspective that he plays maximum T20Is in buildup to the World Cup and he has been on the park since the Asia Cup in the format. Bumrah playing was not just important for his continuity in the format but also for the captain and coach to figure the bowling combination alongside Bumrah. These games have given a clearer picture to selectors also and now the five T20Is vs New Zealand will be just about firming up plans,"" a well placed source tells""So the three ODIs against New Zealand serve no purpose. You will see more of Bumrah in ODIs when the team shifts focus to 2027 World Cup. That's how coach Gautam Gambhir plans to use his premier fast bowler,"" adds the source.The discussions have just not been restricted to Bumrah as the think tank will be following a similar approach with Hardik Pandya . It is understood that this was the prime reason he wasn't rushed for the ODI series against South Africa and was asked to skip the third Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy games for Baroda. He made two appearances for his state before joining the team in Cuttack for the first T20I of the five-match series against South Africa.The all-rounder, after getting injured in the Asia Cup and missing the white-ball series in Australia and ODIs at home against South Africa, featured in all four T20Is against the Proteas and will have some time to rest and recover before turning up for the T20Is against New Zealand next month. It is further understood that Pandya could be asked to play one or two Vijay Hazare Trophy games for Baroda but it's not been decided which ones he would play.""The approach will be the same for Hardik. Both Bumrah and Hardik are the most important players in the T20I set-up right now and the series vs South Africa showed that. There is a possibility of Hardik playing some domestic games for Baroda just to keep his body ready but no final decision has been taken in that regard,"" explains the source.In the team's last international match of the year, Hardik was adjudged player of the match for his destructive 25-ball 63 and Bumrah was at his best in the run-fest as he returned with figures of 2/17. The two players served another reminder of their abilities in the format and why they should be handled with utmost care in the build-up to the 2026 T20 World Cup.The selectors will pick the squad, and possibly standbys, for the tournament on Saturday, and it’s likely to be along expected lines. The team has opted for continuity since the Asia Cup, leaving little room for surprises when chief selector Ajit Agarkar addresses the media in Mumbai.Rinku Singh was picked for the Asia Cup and the T20Is against Australia, but the left-hander only played the final against Pakistan due to Hardik Pandya’s injury, and featured just once in the five T20Is Down Under. The game in which he made the XI was unfortunately washed out in Brisbane.Washington, who wasn’t part of the Asia Cup squad, has been given outings in the format and even bowled his full quota of overs against South Africa in Ahmedabad. His all-round abilities could help him pip a specialist batter, as his off-spin allows the think-tank to use match-ups against left-handers, if the need arises.",Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya are set to be rested during the ODI series against New Zealand.

Sebastian Coe’s words fuel belief in Britain’s next middle-distance star Ben Hoggins



Sebastian Coe: The Record-Breaking Legend Behind World Athletics #shorts

Some athletic records seem untouchable. Sebastian Coe ’s British 800-metre record of 1:41.73, set in 1981, is one of them. For almost 50 years, it has stood as the standard for every British middle-distance runner. Now, the conversation is shifting as new talent emerges and belief grows that the mark could finally fall.That belief has been backed by Coe himself. The World Athletics President has publicly praised the 23-year-old Olympian Ben Hoggins. His comments have added serious weight to growing expectations around British middle-distance running. With Scotland producing world champions and confidence rising across the squad, the moment feels right for a challenge to one of the sport’s greatest national records.Sebastian Coe has rarely spoken so openly about a young British runner. His praise for Hoggins reflects more than talent. It highlights mindset and belief. Speaking to Athletics Weekly, Coe said, “He’s very talented, and you need to win things and with that comes an infectious confidence.”He then compared Hoggins to Britain’s current stars and said, “I’ve seen that with Jake (Wightman) and Josh (Kerr) as well. You need to get up onto pole position ,and sometimes the rest of your career just follows.It’s a psychological breakthrough as much as anything.”Britain is currently enjoying a golden era in middle-distance running. Wightman ended a 38-year wait for a men’s 1500m world title in 2022. Kerr followed by winning the world championship a year later. Both victories echoed the dominance of Coe’s own era.While Hoggins looks to the future, another British runner has already come close to Coe’s record. At the 2025 World Championships in Tokyo, Max Burgin ran a personal best of 1:42.29. That time was just 0.56 seconds away from the legendary mark.The race was described by Coe as a “proper, proper 800m race.” It was fast from the opening lap. The pace helped push Burgin to a new level. After the race, Burgin said he now feels “comfortable at that low 1:42” and added that it “makes sense next year to be pushing to those 1:41s.”That performance showed the record is no longer safe. With Burgin closing in and Hoggins earning Coe’s trust, British athletics may finally be approaching a historic run.Also Read: Adam Peaty and Holly Ramsay escape to Lapland for holidays ahead of wedding amid family drama and swimmer’s mom's 60th birthday","Sebastian Coe has publicly praised British middle-distance star Ben Hoggins.

Maple Leafs' power play ranks third-last in NHL after loss to Washington Capitals

NHL Highlights | Maple Leafs vs. Capitals - December 18, 2025

Head coach Craig Berube isn’t happy with the performance against Washington Capitals

The Toronto Maple Leafs suffered a humiliating 4-0 shutout loss to the Washington Capitals on Thursday night. The defeat exposed numerous flaws throughout the lineup, but none more glaring than the power play.Head coach Craig Berube didn't mince words when addressing his team's performance on the power play. Toronto entered Thursday's game sitting 30th in the NHL with a power play operating at just 15 percent.After failing to convert on five opportunities against Washington, that number dropped to 14 percent. Only the Calgary Flames rank lower at 13.8 percent. The Maple Leafs have scored a league-worst 12 goals on 85 power play opportunities this season.No other team in the NHL has scored fewer goals with the man advantage despite Toronto's elite offensive talent. The franchise that once operated one of the deadliest power plays in hockey now looks completely lost when given an extra skater.Back in the 2022-23 season, opponents feared taking penalties against Toronto. The Maple Leafs made teams pay consistently with their lethal combination of skill and execution.Now, the opposite holds. When Toronto goes to the man advantage, their opponents become almost immortal.The Leafs struggle to generate shots on net, and half the time they can't even gain entry into the offensive zone. Berube delivered a scathing assessment of the power play following Thursday's shutout""The power play has actually been getting better, but tonight it was god-awful, in my opinion,"" the coach said bluntly. He acknowledged the second unit created some chances but reserved his harshest criticism for the top unit.""Our top unit didn't execute, didn't win any battles when they needed to, just couldn't make plays,"" Berube stated. The numbers tell a damning story. Toronto tallied just five shots during five power play opportunities throughout the entire game.The lack of offensive zone time and quality chances made Washington's penalty kill look effortless. When asked whether personnel changes might be necessary, Berube didn't rule anything out. ""Yeah, it could be. Yeah, for sure. That's something we'll definitely look at,"" he confirmed.The admission signals potential shakeups could be coming to a unit that features former Rocket Richard Trophy winner Auston Matthews, runner-up William Nylander, and 38-goal scorer John Tavares. Matthew Knies, Morgan Rielly, and Oliver Ekman-Larsson round out the options.For a team with that much firepower, power-play goals should come easily. Instead, Toronto's man advantage has become a liability that opponents no longer fear. Unless something changes dramatically, the Maple Leafs' championship aspirations will continue being derailed by their inability to capitalize on the most basic advantage in hockey.",Maple Leafs' power play ranks third-last in NHL after loss to Washington Capitals.

Popular Kick streamer Asmongold is weighing in on the recent controversy regarding Wendy Ortiz's sister, Evelyn Ortiz’s recent encounter with a waitress. The controversy began after a short clip from Ortiz’s IRL livestream spread rapidly across X and Reddit. The video showed a waitress confronting Ortiz for leaving a $5 tip on a $250 bill. Despite Evelyn trying to prevent any unnecessary conflict, the waitress was less than impressed at the act.Asmongold addressed the whole awkward situation, criticizing tipping culture as a whole. The streamer called it a side effect of slavery and a form of abuse that should not be entertained. Ortiz also reflected on the incident, calling out how one should not be upset at the amount they got tipped.Reacting to Evelyn’s video, Asmongold wrote on X, “Tipping, a side effect from slavery, is a psyop created by the business ruling class to pit the middle class against the working class. Engaging in tip-shaming or forms of social compliance to continue tipping works solely to continue this abuse. Never tip if you don't want to.""Wendy Ortiz later addressed the situation directly, offering a more personal perspective shaped by her own experience.She pushed back on the idea that tips should be expected or demanded, saying, ""As a waitress/waiter, I don't think you can expect a tip and be, like, upset at what they got tipped.""At the same time, she made it clear she does believe in and advocate for the need to tip when services are good and even often reminds others to do so. Wendy also pointed out how unusual the US tipping culture can feel compared to other countries, where people get offended and become unnecessarily rude when they are not tipped.This latest news comes in light of Wendy Ortiz’s recent public clash with FaZe Clan member Rani “Stable Ronaldo” earlier this month, where she called him a woman-hater.

The Florida Panthers are set for a big matchup tonight as they take on the Carolina Hurricanes, and a lot of attention is on one key question: Will Brad Marchand be in the lineup? The Panthers are trying to keep their rhythm going during a busy stretch of the season, and that makes Brad Marchand’s status a pretty important talking point heading into tonight’s December 19 matchup against Carolina.Since joining Florida, Marchand has stepped right into a major role, delivering experience, energy, and reliable production. He’s been a difference-maker in crucial moments, helping the Panthers maintain their attacking rhythm while also bringing leadership and intensity every time he hits the ice. Against a disciplined and tough Hurricanes team, having him available could be a major boost for Florida tonight.It is expected that he is playing, and all signs suggest that the Florida Panthers’ left winger will be available for tonight’s game against the Carolina Hurricanes. Marchand has quietly had a strong season so far, appearing in 32 games while putting up 19 goals and 18 assists. Those numbers alone show how much he means to this Panthers team, but it’s also the timing of his plays, the calm he brings in tight situations, and the way he lifts the offense when needed that really stand out.If he’s out there as expected, Florida isn’t just getting a goal-scorer back. They’re getting a forward who’s been through big moments, knows how to slow a game down when needed, and has the instincts to create chances when things get tight. Against a Hurricanes team that plays fast, structured hockey, having someone like Marchand on the ice could make a real difference in how this game unfolds.Friday, December 19, 20257 p.m. ETAmerant Bank Arena, Sunrise, FloridaESPN+Tonight’s meeting between the Panthers and Hurricanes has the feel of a real heavyweight NHL matchup.

The NBA has undergone a radical financial metamorphosis, evolving from a traditional sports league into a global wealth-generating machine. We are currently witnessing an era where elite talent is compensated not just for their nightly box scores, but for their massive cultural influence and the soaring value of league media rights. The NBA’s 11-year media rights deal with Disney, the NBA and Amazon is worth $76 billion. Go on and count the zeros.Modern NBA is just not about players on the hardwood, it is about how bigger they have built themselves as a brand using the digital world. This shift has created a new hierarchy where longevity and brand power dictate a player's standing on the all-time earnings list. With salary caps hitting an all time high, the traditionalistic view of professional basketball is getting redefined.This financial revolution is best personified by five men who have mastered the art of the ""Supermax"" era. Here is how they built their staggering empires:The undisputed king of the balance sheet, LeBron has amassed over $581.3 million in on-court salary. His position at the top is the result of over two decades of sustained excellence and dominance of the hardwood. Across all the teams he represented in the NBA, LeBron James earned $169.88M with the Cavaliers, $64.01M with Heat, and so far with the Lakers, the amount is at $347M.By pioneering the strategy of shorter, high-value contracts early on to capitalize on cap jumps, he turned his physical longevity into a half-billion-dollar masterclass in career management.Through the 2025-26 season, Kevin Durant will sit at career earnings of $501 million. With career earnings approaching $400 million, Durant is a beneficiary of his own lethal efficiency. Whether in Golden State, Brooklyn, or Phoenix, ""The Slim Reaper"" has always commanded the highest market rate. His ability to remain an All-NBA caliber scorer into his late thirties has ensured his earning potential hasn't dipped a single cent.Durant is set to earn a salary of $53.2 million this season with the Rockets. He has also signed a two-year veteran extension with the Rockets, through 2027-28, worth $90 million with an average annual salary of $45 million.Stephen Curry is set to earn $59.6 million through this season, which brings his career earnings to $470.1 million. The one-year veteran extension signed in the summer of 2024 will officially push Stephen Curry’s NBA career earnings above $500 million and make him the only player to earn more than $60 million in a single season in 2026-27. The contract is the Warriors’ way of honoring Curry’s loyalty and the prestige he brought to them. He is a generational player who has revolutionized the modern NBA.James Harden signed a 2-year, $81.5 million deal with the Clippers that guarantees an annual pay of $40.75 million.

Jason Kelce goes in on the ‘home alone’ parents during a holiday podcast moment

New Heights

Home Alone

Is Home Alone a Top 5 Christmas Movie? ft. Kylie Kelce | New Heights Film Club

Home Alone

Every holiday season, Home Alone slides back into our lives like clockwork. The traps are iconic, Kevin McCallister is a legend, and the movie is basically untouchable Christmas cinema. But this year, Jason Kelce decided to do what most of us have only thought about quietly, he picked apart the plot, and he did not hold back. During a recent episode of the New Heights podcast, the retired Eagles center went off on what he called the “ridiculous” behavior of Kevin’s parents, and once you hear his argument, it’s hard to unsee it.The rant came up casually on, Jason Kelce’s wildly popular podcast with his brother Travis. While chatting about holiday movies,entered the conversation and that’s when Jason zeroed in on the McCallister parents.According to him, the biggest issue isn’t the burglars, the traps, or even the fact that a child survives on mac and cheese for a week. It’s THE PARENTS. Jason questioned how two adults could realize their kid was left behind and then… just kind of accept it. No extreme measures. No frantic plan B. Just vibes.Jason’s main argument was really simple, there’s no world where real parents would react like that. He pointed out how unrealistic it was that Kevin’s mom didn’t immediately contact neighbors, friends, or literally anyone with a house key to go check on him.Instead of escalating the situation, the movie has the parents stuck overseas, waiting days to physically return while their child is completely alone. Jason didn’t just call it unrealistic, he called it one of the most unbelievable parenting decisions in holiday movie history.And yes, he fully acknowledged that it’s a kids’ movie. That didn’t stop him from tearing into the logic anyway.Jason Kelce didn’t invent this debate, but he definitely reignited it. Every holiday season, fans rewatch Home Alone with adult brains and realize the same thing, the parents’ response is… questionable at best.His rant landed because it sounded like something everyone has said while half-watching the movie in December. The difference is, Jason said it out loud and with the confidence of someone who has absolutely overthought this before.To be clear, Jason wasn’t trying to cancel. He made it obvious that he still loves the movie and understands why it works. The chaos, the humor, the nostalgia, it’s all part of the magic.He even joked about family dynamics and admitted that, in a very unserious way, he understands why Kevin wished his family would disappear. The rant wasn’t angry, it was peak dad energy mixed with holiday humor.Also read - Rams WR Puka Nacua apologizes after controversial livestream gesture and backlash","Jason Kelce goes in on the ‘home alone’ parents during a holiday podcast moment.

Brandon Lowe headline piece in Rays, Astros, and Pirates trade talks

“If completed, outfielder Jacob Melton and right-hander Anderson Brito would head to the Rays.”

Brandon Lowe could be on the move soon. The Tampa Bay Rays are in active talks on a possible three-team trade with the Houston Astros and the Pittsburgh Pirates, according to reports on Wednesday from The Athletic. The deal is still being discussed, but it could change all three rosters before the MLB offseason moves forward.The talks involve power, pitching, and young talent. If completed, the trade would send Brandon Lowe out of Tampa Bay after several strong seasons. It would also give Houston pitching help and allow Pittsburgh to add a much-needed bat to its lineup.According to The Athletic reporters Chandler Rome and Ken Rosenthal, the current framework sends Brandon Lowe from the Tampa Bay Rays to the Pittsburgh Pirates. Lowe is 31 years old and has been one of Tampa Bay’s top hitters when healthy.In the 2025 season, Brandon Lowe hit .256 with 31 home runs and 83 RBIs. He remained one of the best power-hitting second basemen in baseball.Since 2019, only Marcus Semien and Jose Altuve have more home runs at the position. The Pirates are looking for offense after struggling to score runs last season.Brandon Lowe would give them power in the middle of the order right away.Pittsburgh would also receive Rays outfielder Jake Mangum and left-handed pitcher Mason Montgomery if the deal goes through.Lowe’s contract runs through the 2026 season, which makes this a key decision point for Tampa Bay as it looks to balance payroll and long-term planning.In the same deal, the Pittsburgh Pirates would send right-handed pitcher Mike Burrows to the Houston Astros.Mike Burrows is 26 years old and posted a 3.94 ERA during the 2025 season. Houston is looking to add pitching depth after dealing with injuries and workload issues.Tampa Bay would receive Astros outfield prospect Jacob Melton and right-handed pitcher Anderson Brito. Ken Rosenthal reported,Jacob Melton is viewed as a strong young outfield prospect with upside. Anderson Brito gives Tampa Bay another arm to develop. The Rays are known for building depth through trades like this.There is still work to be done. Talks are ongoing, and nothing is final yet. Tampa Bay has also been linked to Arizona Diamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte, which suggests backup plans are in place if this deal falls apart.Also Read: MLB Trade Rumors: White Sox Eye Power Upgrade In Munetaka Murakami As Experts Predict Bo Bichette 2B Transition","The Tampa Bay Rays are in active talks on a possible three-team trade with the Houston Astros and the Pittsburgh Pirates.

Macklin Celebrini breaks Wayne Gretzky’s teenage points record, now eyes Sidney Crosby ’s mark



Macklin Celebrini has officially stepped into rare NHL territory, and he has done it in a way that feels both ruthless and inevitable. The San Jose Sharks’ 19-year-old sensation has moved past Wayne Gretzky in the NHL record books for teenage scoring before Christmas, and that alone tells you the scale of what he is doing this season. This is not hype; it is production backed by consistency.With two more assists on Thursday, Celebrini climbed to 18 goals and 35 assists through 35 games, pushing his tally to 53 points before the holiday break. Gretzky, back in the 1980-81 season, had 51 points as a teenager. Passing a name like Gretzky is never a casual headline in the NHL, but Celebrini has made it feel like part of his natural progression.Celebrini’s surge does not sit in isolation. He has stacked 10 points in his last four games, which speaks to rhythm, confidence, and a clear command of the NHL pace. He is closing in on another benchmark too. Sidney Crosby owns the modern mark with 55 points before Christmas as a teenager, and with two games left for San Jose before the break, Celebrini has a very real shot to leap past that as well. The opportunity begins Saturday when the Sharks meet the Seattle Kraken, and at this stage, it hardly matters who the opponent is. Celebrini has shown he can control games against anyone.After posting 63 points in 70 games as a rookie, Celebrini has accelerated sharply in year two with 53 points in just 35 games. That is star-level efficiency. It signals growth, maturity, and an offensive ceiling that continues to stretch higher. Watching him now, it feels less like a breakout and more like a player settling into who he is supposed to become: one of the best forwards in the league.Breaking Gretzky’s teenage pace would be enough to define a season for most players. For Celebrini, it looks like another checkpoint. With this trajectory, it is difficult to imagine this being the last historic mark he pushes aside.","Macklin Celebrini has broken Wayne Gretzky’s teenage points record.

Jerry Jones downplays Trevon Diggs exit speculation

The Mavs & Stars Both Picked Up Wins Last Night; Previewing Cowboys/Chargers | FAN CAM 12/19/25

Coaching stability remains Jerry Jones’ priority

Also Read:

Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has finally addressed two of the most pressing questions surrounding the franchise: Trevon Diggs’ uncertain future and the team’s coaching direction, as the Cowboys limp toward the end of a disappointing season.With playoff hopes nearly extinguished and internal tensions surfacing, Jones’ comments offer rare clarity on where the organization currently stands.Speaking on 105.3 The FAN, Jones pushed back against growing speculation that Trevon Diggs may have played his final snap in a Cowboys uniform. The Pro Bowl cornerback has not featured since Week 6 and remains on injured reserve, despite recent claims that he is healthy enough to return.“I think that’s a stretch to put that thing that far out,” Jones said, attempting to cool the narrative surrounding Diggs’ long-term future. “On my basis, looking at his situation, I don’t have that kind of attitude about him.”Diggs’ absence has been layered with complexity. While the team has cited health and practice performance as factors, Diggs himself has publicly expressed frustration, stating that the decision to keep him sidelined is no longer in his control.Reports of behind-the-scenes tension, particularly related to scheme fit and rehabilitation preferences have only fueled uncertainty.With a looming deadline to activate Diggs off injured reserve, Dallas must decide whether to bring him back for the final stretch or shut him down for the season. Regardless, Jones’ remarks suggest the Cowboys are not yet prepared to close the door on the All-Pro cornerback.While Diggs’ situation remains fluid, Jones was far more definitive when discussing the Cowboys’ coaching outlook. Despite the team’s struggles and a record hovering around .500, Jones voiced strong confidence in head coach Brian Schottenheimer’s leadership.“He’s had an outstanding year,” Jones said. “He’s technically as sound as you can draw up. We like his philosophy of how to play football.”Jones highlighted the adversity Schottenheimer has faced from injuries to roster instability, and praised his ability to manage multiple responsibilities, including play-calling duties. The endorsement signals continuity rather than upheaval, even as fans clamor for major changes.Jones’ comments underline a broader reality in Dallas: the Cowboys are not planning a dramatic reset just yet. Instead, the franchise appears committed to internal evaluation rather than sweeping change.However, unresolved questions remain. Diggs’ relationship with the coaching staff, defensive scheme compatibility, and overall roster health will shape the offseason narrative. Meanwhile, Schottenheimer’s long-term security may depend on how convincingly Dallas finishes the year.For now, Jones’ message is clear, patience over panic. Whether that approach resonates with fans or yields results on the field is a different matter entirely.",Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones downplays Trevon Diggs exit speculation.
