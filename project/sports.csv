In 2023, Khelo India Para Games, I had won bronze. This time, I have won two gold medals. They are delighted with my growth. My family have always been without big supporters, including my wife. Without them I could not have won a single medal,"" he noted.""They are allowing me to fulfil my dreams. I want to be selected for the Paralympics and win gold there to make my nation proud.""",Ramesh Shanmugam is a 30-year-old para-athlete and a MS Dhoni fan.

Top 5 George Foreman Knockouts | Big George Foreman Now Playing Exclusively in Movie Theaters

Former heavyweight boxing champion George Foreman passed away at age 76 on Friday, as announced by his family.Foreman's family shared the news through a statement on his official Instagram page, confirming his peaceful departure on March 21, 2025, while surrounded by his loved ones.""With profound sorrow, we announce the passing of our beloved George Edward Foreman Sr, who peacefully departed on March 21, 2025, surrounded by loved ones. We are grateful for the outpouring of love and prayers, and kindly ask for privacy as we honour the extraordinary life of a man we were blessed to call our own.""Foreman was born in Texas on January 10, 1949, and grew up in Houston with J.D. Foreman, who was often absent and struggled with alcohol. He later discovered that J.D. was not his biological father when his real father, a decorated World War II veteran, contacted him after his heavyweight title victory.His teenage years were marked by trouble, leading him to drop out of school at 16.""At 13-years-old, George was about 6-foot-2, 200 pounds and the terrorist in the neighbourhood. And when you're bigger and stronger and think you're better than everyone else, you take things,"" his younger brother Roy told the BBC in 2024.He began boxing at age 16, which would change the course of his life.""I wanted to a football player. I tried boxing just to show my friends that I wasn't afraid. Well, 25 fights and one year later, I was an Olympic gold medallist.""At the 1968 Mexico Olympics, 19-year-old Foreman won the super-heavyweight gold medal. He celebrated by waving an American flag in the ring, just days after fellow African Americans Tommie Smith and John Carlos made their black power salute.Standing at 6-foot-4, Foreman dominated the heavyweight division with his size and strength. He earned a title shot against Joe Frazier and won convincingly in two rounds.By the time he faced Muhammad Ali in the famous "" Rumble in the Jungle "" in October 1974, Foreman had an undefeated record of 40 fights. He lost to Ali in eight rounds, largely due to Ali's ""rope-a-dope"" strategy.""I just couldn't believe I'd lost the world title. It was the most embarrassing moment of my life. It went from pride to pity. That's devastating.""After losing to Jimmy Young in Puerto Rico in March 1977, Foreman experienced a religious awakening and retired at age 28 to become an ordained minister.He returned to boxing ten years later, fighting 21 times and winning all bouts, with 20 knockouts. He secured title shots against Evander Holyfield in 1991 and Tommy Morrison in 1993, losing both on points.In November 1994, wearing the same shorts from his Ali fight, Foreman knocked out Michael Moorer in the 10th round to become the oldest heavyweight world champion at 45 years and 299 days.He later lost his WBA and IBF titles for refusing mandatory defences. His final fight was a points loss to Shannon Briggs in 1997 at age 48.Foreman's professional record stood at 76 wins from 81 fights, with 68 victories by knockout.After boxing, he found success with the ""George Foreman Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine"" and hosted a TV show called ""Bad Dads"" in 1996.His personal life included four marriages and twelve children, with ten biological and two adopted. He named all five of his sons George Edward.""If one of us goes up, then we all go up together, and if one goes down, we all go down together!""","Former heavyweight boxing champion George Foreman passed away at age 76 on Friday.

Meredith Gaudreau on the beauty of ordinary moments

Meredith Gaudreau shares special Johnny Hockey stories with Julie & Cat | Episode 9

Johnny Gaudreau was known for many things—his incredible skill on the ice, his warm personality, and his deep devotion as a husband and father. Even now, seven months after his passing, his passion and spirit remain alive in the hearts of those who loved him, especially his wife, Meredith Gaudreau . A glimpse at their social media pages shows just how much energy and joy he brought into every moment.Johnny Gaudreau and Meredith Gaudreau were together for years, sharing countless milestones—getting engaged, getting married, welcoming their two children—all alongside the excitement of his hockey career. But in a recent appearance on the Never Offside with Julie & Cat podcast, Meredith reflected not just on those big moments but also on the simple, everyday memories that made their time together so special.“I mean, this is like so weird. I love watching Deal or No Deal. I love it; it’s like my favorite show in the world. I don’t know why.I think I mean I don’t want to like end on a dark note, but I was like I was having a hard time watching like all the new stuff without John ’cause like that was our thing, and then but we watched Deal or No Deal all the time. I don’t know why, like, we have like this weird streaming television, and there’s, like, a Deal or No Deal channel, and I just watch it, and I’m, like, mesmerized by it. Like, I can’t get enough of it. It is so weird, but I have to be honest; that’s what I’m watching.”Johnny Gaudreau had no way of knowing just how much his decision to move would mean for his wife and children. He made the choice on his own, wanting to relocate the family closer to other players’ families so that his wife, Meredith, would have a strong support system during the long stretches when he was away for NHL games.Talking about this decision, Meredith Gaudreau said, “We’re like this weird team that we all live in one neighborhood like it’s just boom boom boom, like teammate after teammate, and I’m so thankful for that now, obviously, but we have such a good group.”Also Read: ""The compete was not there”: Former NHL coach blasts New York Rangers’ playoff chances, calls out team for horrific performance Meredith Gaudreau shared how Boone Jenner has become ""Uncle Boone"" to her kids, even dressing as Donald Duck for baby Johnny’s first birthday.

Sunrisers Hyderabad:

Rajasthan Royals:

NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) will start as favourites against Rajasthan Royals (RR) in their opening Indian Premier League (IPL) match at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Sunday. Armed with a balanced squad featuring powerful hitters like Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan and Heinrich Klaasen, SRH are well-equipped to post a massive total on the batting-friendly track. The return of all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy after injury adds more depth to their lineup.Abhishek Sharma’s recent form is a significant boost, as he smashed 135 off just 54 balls against England in his last T20I appearance. With such explosive capabilities, SRH could potentially set the much-anticipated 300-run record if they bat first. Last season, they breached the 250-run mark thrice, including 287 against Royal Challengers Bangalore and 277 versus Mumbai Indians.Captain Pat Cummins and Mohammed Shami lead SRH’s experienced pace attack, supported by spinner Adam Zampa. In contrast, Rajasthan Royals look underwhelming, especially without their captain Sanju Samson, who is nursing a finger injury. Riyan Parag will lead in Samson’s absence, but the Royals’ bowling lacks depth beyond Jofra Archer.SRH dominated both encounters with RR last season, winning narrowly in the league stage and comfortably in Qualifier 2. With momentum and firepower on their side, SRH appear poised to continue their dominance.The match between Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Rajasthan Royals (RR) will take place at Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad.The highly anticipated clash is scheduled for Sunday, March 23.The match will begin at 3:30 PM IST, with the toss at 3:00 PM IST.The match will be broadcast live on the JioStar Network.Fans in India can stream the match live on the JioHotstar app.Pat Cummins (c), Travis Head, Ishan Kishan, Heinrich Klaasen, Abhishek Sharma, Sachin Baby, Mohammed Shami, Adam Zampa, Aniket Verma, Abhinav Manohar, Rahul Chahar, Eshan Malinga, Harshal Patel, Kamindu Mendis, Wiaan Mulder, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Atharva Taide, Brydon Carse, Simarjeet Singh, Jaydev Unadkat, Zeeshan Ansari.Riyan Parag (c), Sanju Samson, Shubham Dubey, Shimron Hetmyer, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Dhruv Jurel, Nitish Rana, Kunal Singh Rathore, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Wanindu Hasaranga, Jofra Archer, Ashok Sharma, Tushar Deshpande, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Kumar Kartikeya, Akash Madhwal, Kwena Maphaka, Sandeep Sharma, Maheesh Theekshana, Yudhvir Singh.","Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) will start as favourites against Rajasthan Royals (RR) in their opening Indian Premier League (IPL) match at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium.

NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad will open their IPL 2025 campaign against Rajasthan Royals with confidence, having built a squad that blends explosive batting with experienced bowling options. Runners-up last season, SRH will be aiming to start strong at home on what’s expected to be a flat, high-scoring track at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium .With Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan, and Heinrich Klaasen in the top order, the hosts are capable of posting record-breaking totals. Abhishek, fresh off a 135-run blitz in a recent T20I, is expected to continue his fine form, while the return of all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy strengthens the middle.The bowling attack, led by skipper Pat Cummins, includes the seasoned Mohammed Shami, spin ace Adam Zampa, and death-overs specialist Harshal Patel — making this a formidable unit across all phases.On the other side, Rajasthan Royals are hampered by the unavailability of captain Sanju Samson as a fielder or keeper due to a finger injury. He’s expected to bat as an Impact Player, with Riyan Parag leading the side.Without Jos Buttler, RR’s batting leans heavily on Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shimron Hetmyer. Their bowling attack, led by Jofra Archer and Wanindu Hasaranga, has the potential but lacks depth on paper compared to SRH.Having dominated the Royals last season — including a crucial win in Qualifier 2 — Sunrisers will be looking to extend their supremacy in what promises to be a high-octane afternoon clash.READ ALSO: SRH vs RR Preview, IPL 2025: Formidable Sunrisers Hyderabad face Rajasthan Royals in Hyderabad","Sunrisers Hyderabad will open their IPL 2025 campaign against Rajasthan Royals.

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings (CSK) will rely on their formidable spin attack and favourable Chepauk conditions as they take on Mumbai Indians (MI) in their IPL opener on Sunday. The five-time champions have strengthened their spin arsenal with the additions of Ravichandran Ashwin, Noor Ahmad, Shreyas Gopal and Deepak Hooda, complementing the experience of Ravindra Jadeja. This spin-heavy strategy is well-suited for the spin-friendly Chepauk pitch and could prove decisive against MI.All eyes will be on MS Dhoni as he continues his long-standing association with CSK since the tournament's inception. The team also faces a selection dilemma for the opening slot, with Rachin Ravindra and Devon Conway vying to partner skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad. The middle order is bolstered by Rahul Tripathi, Shivam Dube, Vijay Shankar and Dhoni himself.Mumbai Indians, on the other hand, are dealing with significant absences, including Jasprit Bumrah, who remains out with a back injury, and regular skipper Hardik Pandya, serving a one-match ban. India T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav will lead MI in their opener. While Ishan Kishan's departure leaves a void at the top, Ryan Rickelton could add firepower alongside Rohit Sharma.CSK has dominated recent encounters against MI, winning four of the last five meetings.

Who is Jake Paul’s fiancée Jutta Leerdam?

What’s next for Jake Paul?

Jake Paul is officially off the market. The 27-year-old boxer and social media star just put a ring on it, proposing to his girlfriend, Olympic speed skater Jutta Leerdam, in a moment straight out of a movie. The internet is eating it up. Paul and Leerdam, who have been inseparable since going public with their relationship in March 2023, shared the big news on Saturday morning with a post that had fans buzzing.Paul popped the question in front of a breathtaking island view, with the balcony decorated with white petals, flowers, and candles. The couple’s joint post featured Paul down on one knee, a close-up of Leerdam’s dazzling engagement ring, and a celebratory moment as they tossed petals into the air. “We’re engaged,” they wrote. “We can’t wait to spend forever together.”While Jake Paul ’s career has taken him from YouTube to the boxing ring, Leerdam has been making her own waves in the sports world. Jutta Leerdam isn’t just Jake Paul’s fiancée—she’s a straight-up powerhouse in her own right. The 25-year-old Dutch speed skater has racked up seven world titles, dominating the ice every time she steps on it. Back in 2023, she grabbed gold at the World Single Distances Championships in Heerenveen, a huge moment in her career. And just recently, she helped lead the Netherlands to victory again, snagging gold in the women’s team sprint at the 2025 World Championships in Hamar, Norway.Paul has been Leerdam’s biggest cheerleader, flying to Norway to support her latest victory. He took to Instagram to praise his fiancée, writing, “So proud of my baby 1st, 2nd, and 3rd this weekend at the world championships. She’s a 7-time world champion now. The hardest worker and the most gorgeous.”Paul also took a moment to reflect on how dominant athletes often face criticism. “Isn’t it ironic how the person who is the most important athlete to a sport is the one that they try to tear down the most?” he added. “Can’t relate because we don’t fly at y’all’s altitude. I hope love runs the universe one day.”Jake Paul’s engagement comes on the heels of one of the biggest fights of his career—a wild showdown with Mike Tyson that ended in a unanimous decision win. The Netflix event had the world watching, and now, Paul is already gearing up for his next fight. Rumors are flying about a potential clash with former UFC champ Conor McGregor, but nothing’s set in stone yet.Also Read: Leon Edwards’ 8-Second UFC Knockout: One of the Fastest Finishes in History Right now, though, the only thing on Paul’s mind seems to be celebrating with Leerdam.

KOLKATA: More than the re-introduction of saliva use on cricket balls, IPL players and coaches here on Friday welcomed the decision to use two new balls , one of them in the second innings of an evening game after the 11th over, to negate the dew factor.India’s new spin sensation Varun Chakravarthy said, “I’m looking forward to the ball-change issue more than the saliva part. Changing the ball might help the spinners. Mostly it is the spinners who bowl the 11th, 12th or 13th overs. It will help them get more control over their deliveries, especially with a drier ball (because of dew). That should help their trade.”RCB coach Andy Flower also welcomed the introduction of two new balls.“We’re always looking for a fair balance between bat and ball. In conditions where dew does affect games significantly, that’s a really good rule change. It’s about time,” he said, adding: “I’ve always wondered why there was this reticence on the umpire’s part to change the ball and make it an even and fair contest. You definitely see bat swings becoming a little more baseball-like now. I hope that some of the rule changes will balance out a little more bowling effectiveness as well, so that we can keep that balance in the game.”Also on Friday, New Zealand batting star Kane Williamson said in an interaction that he was sceptical about using saliva to bring any noticeable changes to the white ball, but hoped that it would give some breathing space to bowlers.“Over my time in white-ball cricket, it’s always been quite tough to shine the white ball. Whether it (saliva ban removal) has a large impact or not, we’ll find out soon.“I suppose any sort of help in shining might add some benefit. If it does swing, it really does bring the bowlers into the game a lot more.”","IPL players and coaches welcomed the decision to use two new balls.

Belgian veteran David Goffin secured a remarkable comeback victory with a score of 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 at Hard Rock Stadium .Goffin, aged 34 and currently ranked 55th, had previously defeated Alcaraz in Astana three years ago. Noticing Alcaraz's subpar performance in the opening set, Goffin adopted an aggressive approach.Goffin, who once achieved a career-high ranking of No.7 in 2017, delivered impressive winning shots while Alcaraz struggled with unforced errors. The Belgian player managed to secure a break advantage in all three sets, and despite losing his lead in the first set, he maintained composure to secure the victory.""When I came out earlier... just to warm up on the court, I felt 'I'm moving well. I'm feeling quite relaxed. I'm hitting the ball really well' and so I hoped it would be the same during the match.""""I started the match well. I had the break in the first and he started to play really well at the end of the first.""""It's that kind of night that I will remember for sure -- against Carlos and in a stadium like that.

Every day was better and better. I had some problems after Indian Wells. Can happen.""""He played well, so that's why (he won) I wouldn't go to the match if I would kind of definitely know I'm not ready to win.""Djokovic, who previously lost to a lucky loser at Indian Wells, defeated 86th-ranked Hijikata 6-0, 7-6 (7/1), ending his three-match losing streak. He has now matched Rafael Nadal's record of 410 match wins in Masters 1000 tournaments since their inception in 1990.Karen Khachanov halted Nick Kyrgios's comeback with a 7-6 (7/3), 6-0 victory. Kyrgios, returning from wrist surgery, had secured his first tour-level win since October 2022 against Mackenzie McDonald but couldn't overcome Khachanov, a semi-finalist in Miami last year.In the women's competition, world number two Iga Swiatek advanced to the third round by defeating France's Caroline Garcia 6-2, 7-5. The match proved more challenging than their recent encounter at Indian Wells.Swiatek faced a 3-1 deficit in the second set and saved a set point while serving at 5-4 down before winning the final three games.""My energy level got down really fast.

KKR vs RCB Dream 11 Team Prediction

The stage is set for a blockbuster start to the 2025 Indian Premier League ( IPL ) as defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders ( KKR ) face Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in the tournament opener at Eden Gardens on Saturday.Both teams embark on a new chapter under fresh leadership — Ajinkya Rahane takes charge of KKR, while Rajat Patidar leads RCB. The squads have also undergone significant overhauls following last year’s mega auction in Jeddah, giving both sides a refreshed look.KKR will aim to kick off their title defence on a winning note, while Patidar’s RCB will be determined to turn the page on past disappointments. Adding to the excitement, Eden Gardens will witness Virat Kohli’s much-anticipated return to T20 cricket, his first appearance in the format since retiring after India’s T20 World Cup triumph last year. The home crowd will surely relish watching the Indian icon back in action.The Eden Gardens pitch is renowned for being a batter-friendly surface, especially in the IPL. It usually offers a flat track with consistent bounce, allowing batters to play their shots with confidence. However, compared to the even flatter pitches seen last season in venues like Bengaluru and Hyderabad, Eden Gardens offers a touch more assistance for bowlers, adding a bit of balance to the contest.KKR: Venkatesh Iyer will be the one to watch from a Kolkata Knight Riders standpoint as the biggest buy for the franchise at the mega auction. Another to watch is Varun Chakravarthy having made a mark at the Champions Trophy and secondly for his ability to halt Virat Kohli over the years. It would be interesting if he can do the same todayRCB: Virat Kohli will play his 400th T20 when he takes the field for RCB this season. He is already the leading scorer in IPL history and could achieve the milestone of scoring 1000 runs against four different franchises.KKR squad: Ajinkya Rahane (captain), Venkatesh Iyer (vice-captain), Quinton de Kock (wk), Rovman Powell (wk), Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Luvnith Sisodia (wk), Manish Pandey, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Ramandeep Singh, Rinku Singh, Moeen Ali, Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Anukul Roy, Vaibhav Arora, Spencer Johnson, Mayank Markande, Anrich Nortje, Umran Malik, Varun Chakravarthy.RCB squad: Rajat Patidar (c), Virat Kohli, Yash Dayal, Josh Hazlewood, Phil Salt, Jitesh Sharma, Liam Livingstone, Rasikh Dar, Suyash Sharma, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Swapnil Singh, Tim David, Romario Shepherd, Nuwan Thushara, Manoj Bhandage, Jacob Bethel, Devdutt Padikkal, Swastik Chhikara, Lungi Ngidi, Abhinandan Singh, Mohit Rathee.Both teams have played each 34 times in the IPL, with KKR holding an edge with 20 wins.

What happens if match is affected by rain?

The opening match of IPL 2025 between Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bengaluru at Eden Gardens on Saturday, March 22, faces uncertainty due to weather concerns. The India Meteorological Department has issued an orange alert for Kolkata, with forecasts predicting rain and thunderstorms that could affect both the match (scheduled for 7:30pm IST) and the opening ceremony (for 6pm IST).The weather situation in West Bengal is unstable due to a trough extending from central Odisha to Vidarbha and wind confluence over eastern India. An anticyclonic circulation over the Bay of Bengal at lower tropospheric levels is adding to the weather complexity.The forecast indicates scattered light to moderate rainfall with thunderstorms, lightning, and gusty winds across parts of West Bengal from March 20 to March 22. Kolkata's Regional Meteorological Centre has specifically predicted thunderstorms with lightning and strong gusty surface winds for match day.The temperature in Kolkata is expected to range between 29°C and 22°C, lower than usual due to cloudy conditions. The humidity level is forecasted at 65%, which could impact pitch conditions if play occurs.The morning hours of March 22 are expected to see cloudy skies with showers, with precipitation chances reaching 66% around 11 AM. This could affect the preparations for the opening ceremony scheduled between 6:20 PM and 6:45 PM IST.The afternoon forecast shows intervals of clouds and sunshine, with rain probability decreasing to 25% by late afternoon. During the evening, when the match is scheduled to begin with toss at 7:00 PM IST, initial rain chances reduce to 10%.However, the precipitation probability increases to 70% by 11 PM IST, suggesting possible interruptions during the match. The ground staff at Eden Gardens has already covered the playing area since Thursday as a precautionary measure.Practice sessions for both teams were shortened on Friday due to drizzle, forcing players to move indoors. The match features KKR's new captain Ajinkya Rahane against RCB led by Rajat Patidar.The opening ceremony holds special significance as Kolkata hosts it for the first time since 2015. The event will feature performances by Shreya Ghoshal, Karan Aujla, and Disha Patani, showcasing West Bengal's art and culture. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is expected to attend.If the match is washed out, both teams will receive one point each. Even a shortened game could be affected by the pitch conditions, potentially favouring bowlers over the strong batting lineups of both teams.Eden Gardens has transformed from a spin-friendly venue to a batting-friendly surface in recent IPL seasons. However, rain could alter the pitch conditions, making it more favourable for bowlers if the covers remain on for an extended period.","Kolkata's Regional Meteorological Centre has specifically predicted thunderstorms with lightning and strong gusty surface winds for match day.

Lewis Hamilton responds to critics in style with a thrilling Ferrari victory in China Sprint race



F1 Sprint Highlights | 2025 Chinese Grand Prix

Lewis Hamilton delivered a resounding response to his critics with an emphatic Sprint race victory at the Formula 1 Chinese Grand Prix . Leading from pole position, the Ferrari driver showcased his experience and racecraft by fending off Red Bull’s Max Verstappen before comfortably securing a near-seven-second lead over McLaren’s Oscar Piastri. The triumph marked a significant moment for Hamilton, who had faced scrutiny following a challenging debut with Ferrari in Australia.Speaking to Jacques Villeneuve in Parc Fermé, Hamilton acknowledged the difficulties of transitioning to a new team while addressing the wave of criticism that followed his performance in Melbourne.“I woke up feeling great today,” the first-time Ferrari winner said.“You know, the weather is beautiful here in Shanghai, we have this amazing crowd.“But yeah, the first race was difficult. I really do feel a lot of people underestimated the steep climb it is to get into a new team, to become acclimatised within a team, understanding and communication, all sorts of things.“And the amount of critics and people I’ve heard yapping along the way, just clearly not understanding maybe because they never had the experience or are just unaware.”“The first race was difficult. I really do feel a lot of people underestimated the steep climb it is to get into a new team, to become acclimatised within a team, understanding and communication, all sorts of things,” he said. His words served as a reminder of the complexities involved in adjusting to a new racing environment, even for a seven-time world champion.The stark contrast between Hamilton’s discomfort in Australia and his confidence in Shanghai was evident. Expressing his relief at a much-improved race weekend, he stated, “It’s felt great to come here and feel more comfortable in the car, because in Melbourne, I really didn’t feel comfortable in the car.” The engineering team’s efforts in fine-tuning the Ferrari played a crucial role in his dominant performance, allowing him to fully unlock the car’s potential.Hamilton’s success in China reaffirmed his belief that time and patience are key to Ferrari’s long-term aspirations. Despite the immense expectations placed upon him following his high-profile switch from Mercedes, he remained composed. ""I know the Tifosi, the fans, the team want to win, and it means everything to them. But I said the other day, Rome wasn't built in one day,"" he noted, emphasizing the importance of taking a measured approach.Also Read: Lewis Hamilton secures historic first Ferrari win with thrilling triumph at the F1 China GP 2025 sprint race With his confidence restored and momentum on his side, Hamilton’s victory in Shanghai signals that Ferrari’s latest recruit is finding his footing.

Cincinnati Bengals Eye Potential Matchup with Miami Dolphins in Madrid for 2025



The Cincinnati Bengals might be gearing up for a historic international appearance during the 2025 NFL regular season. Recent developments have fueled speculation that the Bengals could face off against the Miami Dolphins in Madrid, marking a significant milestone for the franchise.Rumors about the Bengals’ potential international game began swirling earlier this week after Madrid's mayor inadvertently revealed that the Spanish capital would host an NFL game featuring the Miami Dolphins in November 2025. While the NFL has not officially confirmed Cincinnati as Miami's opponent, Bengals' star quarterback Joe Burrow seems eager for the opportunity.Burrow took to his Instagram story to express his excitement, writing, ""Bengals v. Dolphins in Madrid? Please be true."" This public show of interest from the Bengals' franchise quarterback has only intensified speculation that Cincinnati may be gearing up for a trip to Madrid's iconic Santiago Bernabéu Stadium this autumn.If the Bengals do secure the matchup, it would mark their first international game since October 2019, when they faced the Los Angeles Rams at Wembley Stadium in London. Since Burrow was drafted in 2020, Cincinnati has yet to play a game outside of the United States, making this potential trip even more significant for both the team and its fanbase.The NFL's commitment to expanding its global reach continues to gain momentum. Last month, the league announced the host countries for the 2025 slate of international games, with a total of seven matchups scheduled.London remains a key international hub for the NFL, with games at both Wembley Stadium and Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Germany has also emerged as a reliable host, with Munich and Frankfurt delivering successful events over the past three years. Brazil will host its second-ever NFL game after a successful debut in São Paulo during the 2024 season.The 2025 season will also introduce two new host countries—Spain and Ireland. Madrid and Dublin are set to make their NFL debut, with the Miami Dolphins and Pittsburgh Steelers acting as the designated home teams. The Los Angeles Chargers will travel to Brazil, while the Indianapolis Colts are set to play in Berlin. Jacksonville, known for its regular international appearances, will once again take the field at Wembley.The specific dates and opponents for these games are expected to be revealed when the full NFL schedule is released later this year. However, Burrow's public statement has sparked excitement among Bengals fans, who are hoping to see their team take center stage in one of the world’s most prestigious stadiums.Also Read: Isaac Rochell hilariously compares 49ers drama to Mean Girls after Kyle Juszczyk’s unexpected shakeup A Bengals-Dolphins showdown in Madrid would not only enhance Cincinnati’s growing reputation but also mark a significant step forward for the NFL’s international expansion strategy.

The eternal debate: Jordan’s perfection vs. LeBron’s longevity



Michael Jordan vs LeBron James - Who Is the NBA GOAT? | My Thoughts

Conclusion: No changing minds in the GOAT debate



Few discussions ignite passion like the age-old NBA GOAT debate . This time, the conversation took an unexpected turn when Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua found himself in the middle of a fiery argument with the St. Brown brothers, Amon-Ra and Equanimeous. The setting? A casual yet intense episode of the ""St. Brown Podcast."" The topic? Not football, but basketball’s greatest of all time. And as expected, the debate boiled down to the two titans—Michael Jordan and LeBron James Without hesitation, Puka Nacua declared his allegiance. “So, LeBron’s the GOAT to you?” Amon-Ra asked, sensing the battle ahead. “Yeah,” Puka responded, unwavering in his belief. And from that moment, he was locked and loaded with his arguments.The Rams wideout wasted no time pointing out James' unparalleled versatility. “He’s 6’8. He’s 260. He plays the 1 through 5,” he argued, painting LeBron as the ultimate Swiss Army knife in basketball. In NFL terms, that would be like a player excelling as a quarterback, edge rusher, and cornerback—an unprecedented level of adaptability. However, Amon-Ra wasn’t convinced. “He’s not playing the 5. He’s not guarding a center,” he countered.Unfazed, Puka continued, emphasizing LeBron’s ability to succeed regardless of the team or coach. “He’s gone to three different organizations and won. Everywhere he goes, he’s had a new coach that he’s taken to the NBA Finals.” This point was met with skepticism from Amon-Ra, who argued, “Coaches don’t matter that much in basketball.” But Nacua was ready. “Who’s the only coach Michael Jordan won NBA championships with?” he asked. Amon-Ra’s response was immediate: “He had one coach. Phil Jackson.”While Jordan’s legacy under Phil Jackson is undeniable, Nacua seized the opportunity to highlight that Jordan played 15 seasons, yet only truly dominated between 1991 and 1998. “He wasn’t only in the NBA from ‘91 to ‘98. He played 15 years, bruh. Like, there’s a point where he was getting bounced in the first round,” Puka remarked, reminding everyone that Jordan’s career wasn’t flawless from start to finish.This exchange showcased the core of the GOAT debate. Jordan’s supporters point to his perfect 6-0 NBA Finals record, his unmatched scoring prowess, and the sheer intimidation he brought to the game. LeBron’s case, on the other hand, is built on longevity, adaptability, and his ability to dominate in different eras and with different teams.Puka further reinforced his stance by comparing LeBron’s immediate impact with Jordan’s early struggles. “When he was 21 in college, LeBron was carrying his team to the NBA Finals already, like year four, carrying Ilgauskas to the NBA Finals.” This was a direct jab at Jordan, who, despite entering the league in 1984, took seven years to make his first Finals appearance in 1991.While Amon-Ra attempted to dismiss Puka’s points, the reality remains: LeBron’s ability to thrive under different coaches, carry multiple franchises to the championship stage, and maintain his dominance well into his 30s and 40s makes him a compelling GOAT candidate. Jordan’s six rings remain untouchable, but LeBron’s all-around impact and sustained excellence keep the debate alive.The NBA GOAT conversation remains the ultimate barbershop argument—one that will never reach a unanimous conclusion. Whether one values Jordan’s ruthless efficiency and championship dominance or LeBron’s ability to evolve and lead across generations, the debate is fueled by subjective perspectives.For Puka Nacua, LeBron’s case is clear: longevity, versatility, and undeniable dominance. But for Amon-Ra and millions of Jordan fans worldwide, the six rings and the aura of MJ’s reign are enough to silence any counterpoint.Also Read: While NFL future remains uncertain, Aaron Rodgers quietly backs golfers through Venmo transactions In the end, the discussion remains what it has always been—a never-ending battle of eras, perspectives, and unwavering loyalties. And as long as both Jordan and LeBron's legacies endure, the GOAT debate will continue to thrive.","Rams wideout Puka Nacua argued with the St. Brown brothers on the ""St. Brown Podcast"" The debate boiled down to Michael Jordan and LeBron James.

IPL 2025: How will KKR, MI, CSK, SRH, RCB fare this season?

IPL: How will GT, LSG, DC, PBKS, RR fare? Greenstone Lobo predicts

Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Rajasthan Royals (RR) are set to reignite their rivalry as they clash in their opening match of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 season on Sunday at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad. The two teams have faced off 20 times in the IPL, with SRH holding a slight advantage, having won 11 matches compared to RR’s 9 victories.The history between these two teams has always promised fierce competition, often featuring thrilling performances from star players. RR, the inaugural IPL champions in 2008, have reached the final only once since their maiden triumph, finishing as runners-up in 2022.In contrast, SRH, who joined the league in 2013, clinched their first and only title in 2016 and have played two more finals since then. Both teams had strong campaigns in 2024, with SRH finishing as runners-up after losing to Kolkata Knight Riders in the final, while RR secured third place, losing to SRH in Qualifier 2.In their most recent encounters last season, SRH emerged victorious in both matches against RR. The first win came in a nail-biting league game, where SRH edged out RR by just one run. The second clash, in Qualifier 2, saw SRH cruising to a 36-run victory, cementing their place in the final. With this recent dominance, SRH will enter the contest with a psychological advantage.SRH are well-equipped to make a strong start to the 2025 campaign, boasting a balanced squad featuring explosive batters like Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan and Heinrich Klaasen. Known for posting massive totals, SRH scored over 250 runs three times last season, including a record 287 against Royal Challengers Bangalore. Abhishek Sharma's fiery form has been noteworthy, especially his blistering 135 off 54 balls against England in a T20I earlier this year. The return of India all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy from injury further bolsters their line-up.On the bowling front, SRH have a formidable pace duo in captain Pat Cummins and Mohammed Shami, complemented by experienced spinner Adam Zampa. With a favourable pitch expected at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, SRH will back themselves to set or chase a daunting total.Meanwhile, Rajasthan Royals face significant challenges, including the absence of skipper Sanju Samson due to a finger injury, leaving young batter Riyan Parag to lead in the initial games. The Royals will also feel the void left by Jos Buttler’s departure, though they still have power hitters like Shimron Hetmyer, Dhruv Jurel, Nitish Rana and Yashasvi Jaiswal. England pacer Jofra Archer will spearhead their bowling attack, but the lack of depth in the bowling department could prove costly against SRH’s formidable batting line-up.With SRH’s superior recent record and the Royals grappling with key absences, the Hyderabad-based franchise appears better poised for success in their season opener.","Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Rajasthan Royals (RR) clash in their opening match of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 season.

SRH in IPL 2025: Sunrisers Hyderabad target title with big-hitting players

RR in IPL 2025: Rajasthan Royals hope for first title in 17 years

Hyderabad: Sunrisers Hyderabad took the IPL by storm last year with their ultra-aggressive batting lineup. The unit, led by Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma, with Heinrich Klaasen and Nitish Reddy in the mix, set new benchmarks — they scored the league’s highest total (287/3 vs RCB), notched up three 250-plus totals and six totals over 200. They also smashed the highest powerplay score of 125 and the fastest team 100. They also chased down 166 in a mere 58 balls against Lucknow Super Giants.Eventually finishing runners-up in IPL-2024, hosts SRH will look to continue with their merry ways in their first match of the new season against Rajasthan Royals at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium on Sunday afternoon.The last time these teams clashed was in Qualifier 2 last year, in which the Pat Cummins-led side defeated Royals by 36 runs to enter the final, where they eventually lost to Kolkata Knight Riders. SRH also won the league match against RR by one run last season.SRH have retained their core team of Head, Abhishek, Nitish, Klaasen and Cummins, and also added Ishan Kishan to their ranks. Ishan lends heft to the already batting-heavy lineup that also includes Abhinav Manohar, known for his six-hitting prowess and who, like Klaasen, is good against the spinners. That will also allow Nitish to ease back into action after an injury-enforced break.In the bowling department, SRH have added Mohammed Shami and Harshal Patel, which compensates for the loss of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and yorker specialist T Natarajan. With skipper Cummins to bowl the middle overs, the SRH attack will hope for enough cushion from their batters on a placid wicket that will need their new spin recruits, Australian leggie Adam Zampa and Rahul Chahar, on top of their game.Royals will be helmed by Riyan Parag as their stand-in skipper since Sanju Samson is still yet to recover from the finger injury he sustained during the England series. Samson, it is expected, may come in as an Impact Player.Jos Buttler has moved on — the decision to let the Englishman go was, by his own admission, Samson’s most difficult one — but in Shimron Hetmyer, Dhruv Jurel, Nitish Rana and Parag, their batting unit has enough firepower. All eyes will be on 13-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi.",Sunrisers Hyderabad take on Rajasthan Royals in IPL-2024. Last time these teams clashed was in Qualifier 2 last year.

KKR in IPL 2025: Kolkata Knight Riders seek successful title defence

RCB in IPL 2025: Royal Challengers Bengaluru chase maiden title

Kolkata: It doesn’t matter whether he’s playing for KKR or RCB, Phil Salt can still do the impossible. The former KKR opener eased into his new role as Virat Kohli’s opening partner at RCB by hitting a 31-ball 56 (9x4, 6x2) against his old team. Kohli too came good in the IPL season opener with a 36-ball 59 not out as RCB, chasing 175, finished things off in style, with seven wickets and 22 balls to spare, here at the Eden Gardens on Saturday night.Salt essentially did what Quinton de Kock couldn’t. The Knight Riders suffered an early jolt when they lost opener De Kock off the fifth ball of the match. Although the purple brigade’s new skipper Ajinkya Rahane and Sunil Narine steadied the innings with a 103-run second-wicket stand, the power-packed batting unit failed to fire against the spinners, particularly Krunal Pandya (3/29 off his four overs), eventually putting up 174/8 after RCB skipper Rajat Patidar put them in after winning the toss.Salt, on the other hand, began dictating terms right from the word go against his former side. The opener took Vaibhav Arora, who came in as an ‘Impact Player’ for Angkrish Raghuvanshi, to the cleaners, hitting him for two fours and one six in the third over. Rahane was forced to bring in his key player Varun Chakravarthy early, but the Englishman collected 21 runs in the mystery spinner’s first over with three fours and one six.Virat Kohli then set the packed Eden stands on fire with spectacular consecutive sixes over left-arm pacer Spencer Johnson’s head in the very next over as RCB collected 80 runs in the first six overs to set the tone. Chakravarthy finally got Salt caught by Johnson at short third man for a well-made 56 off 31 balls.But there was no stopping chasemaster Kohli, who got to his fifty in 30 balls. Kohli stayed unbeaten with the help of four fours and three sixes and Patidar played a 16-ball 34 cameo. Liam Livingstone finished off with a boundary off Johnson.Earlier, Pandya, for whom RCB went specifically at the auction, did not disappoint as the left-arm spinner put the brakes on the KKR innings in the middle overs, bowling stump to stump. He not only dried up the runs from his end but clean bowled Venkatesh Iyer (6) and Rinku Singh (12).An expensive Suyash Sharma ended on a happy note by picking up the prized wicket of Andre Russell when the West Indian missed a slog, the ball coming in sharply to dislodge his stumps. KKR lost the momentum, losing five wickets for 43 runs.","Virat Kohli scored an unbeaten fifty for RCB in their win against KKR in IPL 2025.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

George Foreman , the two-time heavyweight champion and boxing icon passed away at the age of 76. Known for his ferocious power inside the ring and his larger-than-life persona outside of it, Foreman leaves behind a legacy that extends beyond sports—spanning faith, mentorship, business, and broadcasting.His family confirmed his passing in a statement on Instagram, remembering him as “a devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father, and a proud grand- and great-grandfather”.One of the most defining moments of Foreman’s career came in 1974 when he faced Muhammad Ali in the legendary Rumble in the Jungle in Kinshasa, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo).At the time, Foreman was an undefeated champion, boasting a formidable record of 40-0 with 37 knockouts. Having destroyed top contenders like Joe Frazier and Ken Norton—both of whom had beaten Ali—Foreman was the overwhelming favourite.However, Ali defied expectations. Using his now-famous “rope-a-dope” strategy, Ali absorbed Foreman’s heavy blows, allowing the younger fighter to exhaust himself. By the eighth round, Ali capitalised on Foreman’s fatigue, delivering a flurry of punches that sent him to the canvas. The fight was over. Ali had reclaimed the heavyweight crown, cementing his status as “The Greatest”.Foreman later admitted the loss was devastating. “Everybody needs an excuse,” he once said. “I blamed it on the ropes, I blamed it on everything.”Foreman initially retired in 1978 but made a stunning comeback in 1988 at the age of 45. In 1994, he shocked the world once again by reclaiming the heavyweight title—becoming the oldest heavyweight champion in boxing history .Beyond boxing, Foreman reinvented himself as a minister, businessman, and television personality. He became widely recognised for his George Foreman Grill , which sold over 100 million units worldwide.His influence on boxing and popular culture remains undeniable. As tributes pour in, the world remembers a fighter who never backed down—both in and out of the ring.","George Foreman has passed away at the age of 76.

Defending world heavyweight champion George Foreman, left, watches a right from challenger Muhammad Ali (AP Image)

In that moment where the wearied, snorting giant saw immortality slipping from his grasp, George Foreman snapped at his trainer Angelo Dundee, left the stool, and rushed to the centre groping for greatness.It was unlike Foreman who had long evolved from a mercurial heavyweight to a genial preacher, the depression induced by the defeat at the hands of an aging Ali in the “rumble in the jungle” having sent him sliding down a slope, to self-flagellation, continuing to throw arms in the ring, to insist he was a man, before hitting the rock bottom and finding the God and the Gospel. In his rebirth, he had left the ‘life in the fast lane’ of glitz, greenbacks and girls, that’s the lot of testosterone-driven champion pugilists. It was church and preaching, calmness at the core. When he, broke, returned to the ring as a mean to garner money for his ‘youth centre”, he had thought of regaining the Title that he lost in Zaire, a fantasy that lurks in every retired boxer, and that drives all to take one last chance at greatness, that has made a joke of all the yesteryear champions – from Sugar Rays to Larry Holmes.But in Foreman’s return, gone was the baleful glare and the snarling face. The Preacher was in the ring as if blessing his defeated opponents, and counting his own.That was what surprised all around the arena watching the 45-year-old take on 19 years younger Michael Moorer on that 1995 evening, when he snapped at Dundee and left the corner in a rush of blood. Unknown to them, ‘Big George’ was angry at Dundee playing him for a greenhorn, employing the tactic that the trainer used on an un-trying and tired Sugar Ray Leonard to rouse him from his slumber into throwing machine gun bombs that made a mincemeat of Tommie Hearns and earned him victory. Since then, both Foreman and Dundee have revealed that the latter tried to din into his head that knockout was the only way to victory. “Its kind of this, you are behind on points” – the suggestion viewed as the catalyst for Leornard’s comeback was seen by Foreman as showing him up. “Don’t bring that up with me,” Foreman had snubbed.What followed is part of the boxing lore, one of the greatest rounds in the history of heavyweight, written and executed by the portly performer. A desperate Foreman wanted a clear shot at Moorer’s head, for which he moved to the side that was a strict no-go – left hand of the young southpaw. He ignored the advice of Dundee, saw the full sphere of the head, threw a probing one-two. It was a reconnaissance mission. And then, the real one – boom, boom. Moorer went down, lifted his head in a daze, and slid back to defeat. Foreman kneeled in his corner, and prayed. He was wearing red shorts that had faded to pink, bearing ‘George Foreman, Heavyweight champion”, that he had worn in Kinshasha. He had in that moment exorcised the ghost of Zaire that had haunted him for 20 years. He was calm again. He was great again.When Foreman left us all on a warm New Delhi Saturday, he went a happy man. One of his last tweets was his photographs surrounded by loving great grand kids in his Texas mansion, thanking life for the pleasure of family life and peaceful mind. Few of his fellow travellers had joyful retired life. Taking bombs to their heads round after round for years, they were damaged goods. Slurring speech, slow movements, trailing train of thoughts. Ali was the worst hit, afflicted by Parkinson’s and saddled with virtual paralysis for better part of his retirement. Foreman was always counting his blessings.So, who was Foreman, the man who travelled from a promising boxer to a boxing immortal, a hedonist who became a messenger of God, an old man who became the face of the adage that ‘age is a number’?Black sportsmen and women, boxers or baseballers or athletes or hoopsters, are slices of American history that trace the place of the race in a given era. The Jim Crow apartheid kept them apart from the mainstream, but the impassioned men could not give up their chosen pursuits. There emerged parallel sporting systems, like separate train wagons or smoking rooms for black and white. The Negro leagues had players and teams compete with the sheer dint of their talents, but did not find acceptance with the white-only mainstream. And then there were pioneers who broke the colour ceiling, because they could not be ignored. They brought along special skills that were not known to the whites, a dazzling style to the tough dreary arts. If there was Jack Johnson and Joe Louis in pugilism, there was Jackie Robinson in baseball, Jesse Owens and the likes on track. When Archie Moore was finally given an opportunity at the title in 1952, he swiftly, and artfully, despatched Joey Maxim to win the light heavyweight at the age of 36 (real 39). To his celebrating entourage, the Old Mongoose preached moderation. “I know it’s a matter of happiness. But let’s keep the perspective: I should have won it 5 years ago.” Such was the apartheid.As the square ring, post-Rocky Marciano, became a coliseum of black gladiators, along came champions like Floyd Patterson, Sonny Liston, Mohd Ali, Joe Frazier, Foreman, Larry Holmes, and the list went on. They were all blacks, and no white measured up to their special talents. Even those who never won the title were greats, like Ken Norton and Ron Lyle. They fought amongst themselves and took boxing to its zenith.But years before they became stars in the sky, they were all poor, runaway kids, felons, who found boxing as their calling, but also viewed it as their ticket out of the hell of ghettos. It is from such background emerged the growing boy, who would become the lean mean fighting machine. Foreman, as he progressed, came to be seen as the “hardest puncher” ever to step in the ring. After he worked the heavy bags, they famously bore big hole like depressions. Archie Moore, in Foreman’s corner in Kinshasha, said they felt Ali dying in the ring was a distinct possibility, and he prayed for his safety. Such became the boy who, in Jamaica in 1973, made lightwork of the newly crowned ‘grunting and always coming in’ ox of a title-holder, Smokin’ Joe Frazier. As the young ‘King of the Big Men’, Foreman was not only unbeatable. He was indestructible. He fought and he decimated. That’s how he rolled, a shade of the later champion Mike Tyson.Life in the fast lane was easy. The trappings of glory were there, and Foreman partook of all that came his way. It had been hard-earned through talent. But lurking around the ring and in his mind was the teasing, poking Ali. The man who was exiled for his beliefs as a black man, and stripped of title without ever losing, dubbed all those who followed him to the title as imposters. He wanted back what he considered was his and was robbed from him. Frazier sent him down and out to defend his title, but Foreman’s smashing of Smokin’ Joe gave Ali a new target. He was forever trying to mock George into giving him the challenge. After a long wait, Foreman gave in, because he did not see the ageing, slowing, rusty Ali as threat, but also for reasons of vanity to shut “the lip” and, of course, for the big purse. What a bluff artist Don King contrived as “rumble in the jungle” and wangled out of Zaire dictator Mobutu is the stuff of legends, creating a 10-million dollar prize, and much more, out of nothing in his pocket.The fight lived up to its billing. And has remained the poster of victory of the underdog and of resilience. Ali played on Foreman’s mind, rallied the fawning crowds behind him, and tricked Foreman with ‘rope-a-dope’ – he retreated to the ropes and the angry man worked on his belly for round after round, and drained himself of strength. Ali had set him up, and then despatched him with ease. In the video, you see foreman going down in a swirling circular motion, and Ali with fist cocked does not interrupt his fall with another punch. Norman Mailer, in The Fight, said it was as if Ali did not want to spoil the aesthetics of the knock-out.When Foreman fell, he hit the bottom. An older and slower Ali had beaten the man who brooked no challenge and whose punch was known as the death blow. It was supposed to have been a walk in the park, but became a slow march to the mortuary.Boxing is known for the clashes that define the sport and its practitioners. And Ali became the curse of the golden generation of fighters. He became the measure of greatness, and all had to go through him. There was no escape. As Bobby axelrod in “billions”, the ott tale of intrigues about Stock Markets, says to “the Attorney” who is forever looking to trap him, “Why are you always after me? I know, there are fights that one measures himself against, fights that take more out of you than winning can ever give you. Ali had Frazier. You …..” It was that kind of trap that Ali set up.The best of the fighters were robbed of their greatness, because Ali loomed over them. His trilogy with Joe Frazier, his twin defeats of Sonny Liston, his landmark rumble against Foreman became the ghosts that haunted the rivals lifelong. Not just in the ring, but Ali, for purposes of social messaging and mind games, and for plain hyping for Gatemoney, robbed the rivals of their blackness by painting them as Uncle Toms , and of their humanness by mocking them as Ugly Bear, Ignorant and Gorilla. And it embittered them. Frazier was cursing all his life, till his death.Post-Zaire, Foreman was lost. He experienced a down that sent him searching for meanings in his existence. He boxed for a while to prove he was more than “rumble”. But then, the inevitable happened. He realized he was lost. And like it happens with men looking for reasons in the wilderness, he found God. He took to preaching. He changed. Then, cheated by his partner, he could not muster money to carry on his ‘youth centre”, and had to do events as Foreman the Boxer, to generate funds. And then, the epiphany. If he had to make money by playing the boxer, why not get in the ring and make a lot, and at once. From there emerged the dream of winning back the title.He went to Dundee who, as Ali’s trainer, had played a part in his life-altering Zaire defeat, and asked Dundee to be his corner now. Foreman, as he revealed later (dittoed by the trainer himself) told Dundee that he remembered how Ali was taking it lightly in Zaire, and he was getting on top, before Dundee shouted “don’t play with that sucker!” Immediately, Ali stopped clowning, and got back to boxing. “I have liked you since that moment,” Foreman said. The two bonded. There was surprise in the press about an old ex-champion coming back to try win the title again. It generated mirth, given the bald, fat Foreman. With boxing littered with tales of lust for one last shot at glory in old age, people did not take him seriously. But serious, Foreman dead was. As Dundee reveals, Foreman on his comeback trail trained harder than any young man. He had a pick-up truck chugging on the road, with a heavy bag dangling at the rear, and Foreman punching it, all the while going forward.It so happened, Evander ‘the real deal” Holyfield, failed to knock out Foreman, but won on points. Yet, for the preacher, glory was pre-destined. By a quirk of fate, Moorer knocked out Holyfield in a shock result, and one particular vacant boxing belt in the World of alphabet soup of titles saw Foreman challenge him. What followed was history, with, after round 13, the belt adorning Foreman’s bulging waistline once again, after a gap of 20 years.Few lives end on top, and fewer at summit lost decades ago. Foreman managed it. He was also blessed with health. He punched hard and a lot, but rarely took them. So, he escaped the conditions that afflicted many heavyweights in later life. He reinvented himself as a businessman, lending his name to Grills and other contraptions. And lived with his fifth wife, and kids and grand-kids in Texas. The world remembered him, as he made frequent pitstops on sports channels, entertaining the same questions about ‘rumble’, Ali, boxing, contemporary fights, in between slipping in the promotion of his products.But one thing stood out in his rediscovery of self. Questions about Ali, his nemesis to whom his being and his glory got hyphenated with forever, never shot up his bile. He, instead, remembered him with reverence -- “Ali was bigger than boxing”. He did not shy away from the fact that others, blacks like him, were just great practitioners of their skill, while Ali was a freedom fighter, black pride, who was also a pugilist.That appreciation of his nemesis revealed that Foreman, in his second coming, did become a child of God. Calm, honest, shorn of vanity. Truthful. And that’s why, this Saturday, he went away happy.","George Foreman, the fearsome heavyweight who became a beloved champion, dies at 76. He had long evolved from a mercurial heavyweight to a genial preacher. The depression induced by the defeat at the hands of an aging Ali in the ‘rumble in the jungle’ had sent him sliding down a slope, to self-flagellation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119334317,imgsize-44420,width-400,resizemode-4/119334317.jpg"

IPL 2025: How will KKR, MI, CSK, SRH, RCB fare this season?

TimesofIndia.com in Chennai: Suryakumar Yadav was all relaxed, had a nice laugh when MS Dhoni was referred to as an ""uncapped player"" and looked upbeat for the upcoming season of the Indian Premier League (IPL). This edition carries an additional layer of significance for Surya who hasn't had the best of times with the bat since taking over T20I captaincy from Rohit Sharma after the World Cup last year. India operated without fear and have had a splendid run under new head coach Gautam Gambhir in the bilaterals which followed but the spunk has been missing from Surya's blade.Fifteen outings as a captain have yielded a meagre 258 runs and struggles continued in the domestic circuit for Mumbai too. The bat which once breathed fire has been ice cool for a very long time and the IPL presents an opportunity to get back amongst the runs. The right-hander enjoyed a lot of success at No. 3 but has himself pushed down the order to accommodate Tilak Varma who has been in red hot form. While the move paid rich dividends for the young left-hander, Surya's batting stock has been on a bear run since then.With the Mumbai Indians , he will be free from captaincy duties, except the first game where he is leading because of Hardik Pandya's slow-over rate suspension, and would look to rediscover the mojo in the next few weeks. When asked about the return to No.3 spot, Surya kept cards close to his chest and asserted he is flexible to bat anywhere in the batting order.""It's always good to have that impact at the top. And I have seen that guy (Tilak), he has been working really hard. So for Team India, I thought it would be better if he can bat at number 3 and I can take the responsibility at number 4. Because for me, I think batting number doesn't matter. I will try and bat the same way, try and make that impact whenever there is an opportunity. And so does he. So you might see guys being flexible during this season, during this stint with the IPL. And everyone is flexible. Even I can bat at 3... I can bat at 5, Tilak can bat at 5. So it's that flexibility we have in our team,"" said Surya at the pre-match presser in Chennai.The 34-year-old continues to work hard in the nets and is hoping luck remains on his side during the cash-rich league. Clear mindset has always been the key and the right-hander wants to find that ""sweet spot"" consistently this season.""With the form, I think the harder you work, the luckier you get. If it has to come, it will come anytime. But I am actually a process-oriented man. I love to work hard in the nets. And if the runs have to follow, it will follow quickly. I love to follow a good process, good routine when I am there during practice sessions. If I am practicing well, hitting the ball really well in the nets. When I go into the game, if my mind is clear, I know what I have to do. That is the moment, that is the sweet spot for me. When I know that I am in good space and I will get runs for the side,"" explained Surya.Mumbai Indians get their campaign underway on Sunday and the focus will remain on Surya, and his returns with the bat, as the Indian cricket team has a heavy T20I calendar before the T20 World Cup next year and the last thing the side would want is the skipper's extended lean patch with the bat.He will have his ""eyes wide open"" keeping track of his India teammates but the extra significance the season carries will certainly be a test of Mr 360's character.",Suryakumar Yadav has struggled with the bat since taking over T20I captaincy from Rohit Sharma after the World Cup last year.

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) started their IPL 2025 campaign with a bang, securing a convincing seven-wicket win over defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) at the iconic Eden Gardens on Saturday. Led by new skipper Rajat Patidar, RCB showcased their dominance with both bat and ball to kick off their season in style.Chasing a competitive target of 175, RCB's dynamic opening pair of Phil Salt and Virat Kohli stole the show. The duo put on a blistering 95-run stand in just 8.3 overs, setting the foundation for an easy chase. Salt was the aggressor, hammering 56 off 31 balls with nine fours and two sixes. Kohli, the ""chase master,"" remained unbeaten on 59 off 36 deliveries, guiding RCB to 177/3 in 16.2 overs. Though KKR managed to pick up a few wickets, the damage had already been done, with Liam Livingstone sealing the victory with a boundary.The turning point of the match, however, came in the first innings when Krunal Pandya produced a remarkable spell to restrict KKR. At one stage, KKR seemed destined for a massive total, reaching 107/1 after 10 overs, with Ajinkya Rahane (56) and Sunil Narine (44) smashing the RCB bowlers. However, Krunal’s three-wicket burst in quick succession changed the game. He dismissed Rahane, Venkatesh Iyer (6), and Rinku Singh (12), sending shockwaves through the KKR camp and halting their momentum.Rahane fell trying to clear the boundary but found the fielder at deep backward square leg. Soon after, Venkatesh Iyer and Rinku Singh fell prey to Krunal’s sharp turn and clean bowled by the RCB spinner. The once-promising innings collapsed from 107/1 to 145/5 within just a few overs. KKR never recovered, eventually posting 174/8 in their 20 overs.Josh Hazlewood complemented Krunal's efforts, claiming two wickets for 22 runs, including the key scalp of Quinton de Kock in the opening over. Rasikh Salam, Yash Dayal and Suyash Sharma chipped in with a wicket each.Despite the valiant efforts of Rahane and Narine, KKR’s middle order faltered under pressure, unable to capitalise on the strong start. The combination of Krunal’s decisive spell and RCB’s ruthless batting performance made the difference, ensuring a commanding victory for the visitors.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) beat Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) by seven wickets.

KOLKATA: Another season in the sultry Indian summer. Another round of a cocktail of cricket and entertainment, with its unique spicy garnish. Another edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), which has redefined the game in less than two decades of its existence. Even as its original founder Lalit Modi grapples with uncertainties over his nationality, the IPL has firmly shown that it is here to stay.On Saturday, the T20 tournament starts yet another two-month journey of breathless excitement. Plenty of runs, cheerleaders dancing to blaring music, some nail-biting late finishes, maybe some rain. Defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders take on perennial pretenders Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the opening match at the Eden Gardens, with the inaugural ceremony peppered with some Bollywood-style frolic, weather permitting.Shreya Ghoshal, Karan Aujla and Disha Patani are among the entertainers to have been lined up for the gala event. ‘Host of honour’ Shah Rukh Khan could well shake a leg or two. The possibility of rain and thunderstorm has been a mood dampener. Fingers crossed.Battles within the battle have always been the top draw in the IPL evening (and a few matinee) shows. How about a Virat Kohli vs Varun Chakravarthy for starters? As much as the teams, the IPL is also about individuals.Loyalties change with the colour of the jersey. In the blink of an eye, forever friends become foes on the field. Take Phil Salt, for example. The Englishman was so crucial in KKR’s triumph last year. He will be there in Saturday’s opening show, but in the rival camp. Ask him how he feels coming up against Harshit Rana, and he’ll have mixed feelings.Fellow Englishman Jos Buttler was surprised when Rajasthan Royals let him go, even penning a heartfelt farewell to the Jaipur franchise. Clearly, emotions have no place in the IPL auction, where only practical logic works. Buttler now has an opportunity to showcase his power for Gujarat Titans.And Kohli has another chance to grab the trophy missing from his cabinet even after 17 years of toil. With questions on his longevity abound, age doesn’t seem to have dimmed his enthusiasm. Eyeballs will still follow him wherever he plays: Those animated celebrations; those death stares. Although Kohli will be playing under Rajat Patidar, the India star in all likelihood, will have a major say in decision making.Patidar, incidentally, made his IPL debut in 2021, by which time Kohli had already played 192 matches. Ditto for Chennai Super Kings where Mahendra Singh Dhoni, one of the shrewdest cricketing brains, could be the guiding light for Ruturaj Gaikwad.KL Rahul and Faf du Plessis would assist skipper Axar Patel in the leadership troika at Delhi Capitals. Mumbai Indians have both the current India skippers, but none of them will lead the team.Hardik Pandya will draw on Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav’s acumen. The last mentioned will stand in for Pandya in their opener.Decision making could also be a split operation in KKR, who will be out to defend their title without Gautam Gambhir’s Midas Touch. Ajinkya Rahane’s leadership qualities are well documented, but Venkatest Iyer, heir apparent to the throne, could well be tested for that role with a match or two.Even Rajasthan Royals’s Riyan Parag will be put on captaincy perch in their first three matches. Two of those games in his hometown, Guwahati, a clear indications that the franchise is looking at him as a long-term prospect.Talking about Royals, it will be interesting to see how Vaibhav Suryavanshi, who will turn 14 next Thursday, shapes up. Of course the question remains whether the hard-hitting batter from Bihar will get to play a game.Hitting hard is the launchpad on which T20 innings are built and one team capable of it is Sunrisers Hyderabad. The Heinrich Klaasens, Travis Heads, Abhishek Sharmas love the pitches in India and are quite capable of erecting skyscrapers. However, slam-bang batters are spread out evenly, like Jake Fraser-McGurk (DC), Shashank Singh (PBSK), Rishabh Pant (LSG), Devon Con -way (CSK), Sunil Narine (KKR)...the list just goes on.Let’s spare a thought for the bowlers too, who often go into an IPL contest with the head coach telling them, “don’t be afraid of getting hit”.It won’t be easy to hit KKR spinner Chakravarthy though, whose mystical magic has mesmerised many a batter. Rashid Khan, Ravindra Jadeja, Yuzvendra Chahal have repeatedly reminded that spinners play a big role too. However, it will be pacers like Jasprit Bumrah (when he is fit), Mohammed Shami, Mitchell Starc, Jofra Archer and Arshdeep Singh whose opening and closing statements could be the difference between victory and defeat.","Defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders take on Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the opening match at the Eden Gardens.
