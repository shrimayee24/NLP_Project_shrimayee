How Wiggins Fits With LeBron and Doncic





Theare weighing their options this offseason, and according to a popular NBA analyst, one potential move involves swapping a key forward for a proven NBA champion.The Los Angeles Lakers have two clear paths in free agency: pursuing a dominant center or trading for an experienced wing player to bolster their championship aspirations. According to recent reports, the franchise may lean toward the latter by targeting Miami Heat star Andrew Wiggins.Lake Show Life’s Svyatoslav Rovenchuk suggests the Lakers could package forward Rui Hachimura in a deal to acquire Wiggins from the Miami Heat.""The fit of Rui Hachimura alongside (Luka) Doncic and (LeBron) James has quickly come under scrutiny after a premature first-round exit to the Minnesota Timberwolves,"" Rovenchuk wrote. ""This has led many to believe the Lakers are better off trading the starting forward."" (H/t: Sporting News)Andrew Wiggins could provide the Los Angeles Lakers with much-needed perimeter scoring and defensive versatility. Here’s why this trade could work:- Salary Match: Hachimura ($17 million) plus another expiring contract could match Wiggins’ $28.2 million salary for 2025-26.- Proven Playoff Performer: Wiggins was instrumental in Golden State’s 2022 title run, averaging 17.2 points and 4.5 rebounds per game.- Immediate Upgrade: While Hachimura is solid, Wiggins offers better two-way impact and championship experience.Once considered an underachieving talent in Minnesota, Wiggins revitalized his career with the Golden State Warriors . His improved motor and efficiency made him a key piece in Golden State’s success.However, after a slow start in 2024-25, the Warriors traded him to Miami in the Jimmy Butler deal.Wiggins’ skill set complements the Lakers’ star duo:- Reliable three-point shooting for better floor spacing.- Strong perimeter defense to ease the load on LeBron James.- Playoff-tested mentality, crucial for deep postseason runs.With the Heat struggling, Wiggins may welcome a move to a contender like the Lakers.While Hachimura has been a steady presence, Wiggins represents a clear upgrade for a Los Angeles Lakers team in win-now mode. If Los Angeles can structure the right deal, adding the former Warriors champion could be the move that pushes them back into title contention.","The Los Angeles Lakers have two clear paths in free agency: pursuing a dominant center or trading for an experienced wing player.

Breaking: Diamondbacks pitcher Justin Martinez out for the rest of 2025 MLB season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/breaking-diamondbacks-pitcher-justin-martinez-out-for-the-rest-of-2025-mlb-season/articleshow/121838008.cms,"Image Source: Getty

Justin Martinez's injury timeline and impact on the Diamondbacks' bullpen

What Justin Martinez's long-term absence means for Arizona’s 2025 outlook





Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Justin Martinez has been ruled out for the rest of the 2025 season with a sprained right ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in his throwing elbow. Manager Torey Lovullo announced on MLB Network Radio that the injury is serious and that Martinez is likely to be out for a full 12 to 13 months.The UCL sprain was originally discovered after he felt tightness in his elbow while pitching the ninth inning on June 9; he immediately called for the training staff and received an MRI the following day. Not every UCL sprain needs Tommy John surgery, but the 12- to 13-month timetable for recovery is an obvious red flag. The club will assess the state of the ligament and decide the best course of action from there, though, as Martinez will be getting a second medical opinion.The void leaves an already maimed Arizona bullpen with another hole to patch up. Closer Kendall Graveman was placed on the 15-day IL with a hip impingement, and fellow reliever A.J. Puk had started the season on the 60-day IL with a flexor strain. As injury-plagued starters, Corbin Burnes and Jordan Montgomery both ended up needing Tommy John surgeries. In their place, Arizona has brought up Kevin Ginkel and Bryce Jarvis from Triple-A Reno and added right-hander Tayler Scott to the 40-man roster.Optioned RHP Jeff Brigham to Reno; transferred RHP Cristian Mena to 60-day ILAlthough this was a disappointing roadblock, it could be a blessing in disguise. Martinez's deal comes with a club option for 2032, worth only $3 million, which is usually automatically picked up if a player would need surgery or would remain on the injured list for a certain amount of time. That would give the Diamondbacks some breathing room financially if he has to go under the knife.Also Read: Justin Martinez secures five year 18 million contract with Diamondbacks Martinez had an impressive season last year from a performance standpoint, providing 72⅔ innings of 2.48 ERA ball, with nearly a 30 percent strikeout rate and a 58.9 percent groundball rate. His extension was a show of faith from the team that his long-term upside would pay off. The absence of Martinez will stretch the bullpen depth for Arizona, but the club hopes he leads a full recovery and returns to being one of the most important late-inning weapons for 2026.",Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Justin Martinez has been ruled out for the rest of the 2025 season with a sprained right ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in his throwing elbow.

Her second-best throw was 61 feet, 11 inches, better than the first runner-up, Abria Smith, who threw 61 feet, 10 and a quarter inches.Reports suggest that she was the only woman over 19m all season and the only one over 19m tonight.It is to be mentioned that this achievement marked Colorado State's first outdoor national title since 2005.

Before Lesnar dominated WWE and UFC with his wrestling prowess, he clinched the NCAA Division I amateur wrestling championship and was a two-time Big Ten champion. He concluded his college career with a record of 106 wins and 5 losses.Mya, similar to her father, had a long journey to success.

I expected more.. But that’s just me and this is business”.However, some fans have also supported Joe Burrow.A fan wrote, “I love Joe because he’s always trying to get his guys paid. This is the answer that gives Trey a bit more leverage.”Another fan wrote, “#Bengals front office, is putting Joe Burrow in such a tough spot, every year, for absolutely no reason… Trey deserves to be paid, he was there with the team, when others weren’t. He is a leader on that defense, as they continue to dismantle the D.

Temba Bavuma on picking Ngidi over Paterson for WTC Final: 'Tough decision'





South African fast bowler Kagiso Rabada has etched his name alongside West Indies legend Gordon Greenidge as the only two players in the 141-year history of Lord’s to appear on the iconic honours boards in both the home and away dressing rooms. Rabada ’s latest feat came during the World Test Championship (WTC) final against Australia at the historic ground. The 30-year-old delivered a masterclass, claiming 5 for 51 in the first innings and following it up with another four wickets in the second, helping South Africa stay competitive against a strong Australian side.In Test cricket, players who score a century or take a five-wicket haul at Lord’s earn the privilege of having their name inscribed in gold lettering on the famous honours boards - an accolade revered by cricketers worldwide.Before Rabada, this rare distinction belonged solely to Gordon Greenidge. The legendary opener’s scores of 214 not out and 103 for the West Indies against England in 1984 and 1988 are immortalised on the away honours board. Lesser known, however, is Greenidge’s appearance on the home board — a result of his 122 while playing for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against the Rest of the World in 1987.Rabada, too, was already on the away board for his five-wicket haul (5 for 52) against England in 2022.But this time, a unique twist added to the story. As South Africa were assigned the home dressing room for the WTC final, Rabada’s first-innings five-for earned him a place on the home board as well — making him only the second player in Lord’s history to achieve this honour.A piece of sticky batting tape with Rabada’s name written on it has been temporarily attached to the board for his figures of 5-51, as tradition dictates during the match. The gold lettering will follow soon, reported the BBC.Rabada’s achievement is even more poignant given his recent redemption arc, bouncing back strongly after serving a doping ban for using a recreational drug — an incident Australian captain Pat Cummins confirmed his side would not exploit as a sledging tactic. “That’s not our style. I doubt that will come up,” Cummins said before the final.Cricket greats have not held back in their praise. Former Australia skipper Ricky Ponting likened Rabada’s prowess at Lord’s to that of Glenn McGrath, who famously exploited the unique slope at the ground to devastating effect. “Glenn McGrath was exactly the same at Lord’s. He loved bowling there and mastered the slope from both ends — something not talked about as much as it should be,” Ponting told the ICC. “These big games are about big-name players standing up, and Rabada did exactly that. ”Reflecting on his name appearing in both dressing rooms, Rabada called the achievement “cool”, underlining the personal significance of joining such a niche club in cricket’s spiritual home.",Kagiso Rabada has become only the second player in Lord's history to have his name inscribed on both the home and away honours boards.

Tyrese Haliburton fires back at critics, Stephen A. Smith takes it personally in fiery rant



Hilarious fan reactions to ‘ Dumb and Dumber ’ trolling of Stephen A. Smith and Kendrick Perkins at Game 4







Sometimes, the loudest message in a Finals game doesn’t come from a superstar or a coach—it comes from the stands. During Game 4 of the 2025 NBA Finals at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, while most fans rocked gold Pacers shirts, two individuals turned heads with bold fashion choices straight out of a comedy classic. Dressed in Dumb and Dumber-style tuxedos—one bright orange, one electric blue—they topped it off with oversized face cutouts of ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith and Kendrick Perkins. It was a hilarious, pointed response to recent media criticism of Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton—and fans online immediately took notice.The media heat on Tyrese Haliburton started after Game 2, when he was criticized for his passiveness in a 107–123 Pacers loss. On “First Take”, ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith didn’t hold back. “Win the damn chip, bro… That ain’t on me. That’s on you,” he said, implying Haliburton wasn’t delivering when it mattered. Smith continued, “Just in case he was talking about me—my brother, I'm not going away… this train don’t stop.”Then came Game 3. Haliburton bounced back with 22 points, 11 assists, and 9 rebounds in a 116–107 Pacers win. After the game, he was asked about the media noise. He didn’t name names but made his feelings clear: “Most of the time, the talking heads on the major platforms, I couldn’t care less honestly. Like, what do they really know about basketball?” Kendrick Perkins , speaking on NBA Today, gave Haliburton credit for stepping up.“He finally arrived to the NBA Finals—to us box score watchers,” Perkins said. He even acknowledged, “He outplayed SGA.”And then came Game 4, when two fans used fashion to flip the script. Their orange and blue tuxes carried double meaning: orange symbolizing Smith’s New York Knicks loyalty, and blue a nod to the Oklahoma City Thunder—Perkins’ former team. It was comedy, commentary, and petty brilliance all rolled into one.Fans took to X with no shortage of reactions to the trolling masterclass.One fan said: “Absolutely incredible troll job by Pacers fans dressed as Stephen A. Smith and Kendrick Perkins. Dumb and Dumber tuxedos and all.”This tweet captured the moment perfectly and praised the fans for the elite-level trolling and creative execution.A second user chimed in with: “Two guys in the front row at the Pacers game dressed like Dumb and Dumber with Stephen A Smith and Kendrick Perkins faces on their suits.”This user highlighted the boldness of the fans’ courtside position, emphasizing how visible and intentional the troll job was.Another user joked: “Are these two guys front row at the Pacers game calling Stephen A Smith and Kendrick Perkins Dumb and Dumber?”This tweet added playful speculation, bluntly asking if the fans were deliberately labeling the ESPN duo as the classic comedy characters.One more said:“Best thing I’ve seen tonight…. Dumb and Dumber at the Pacer game tonight!”This comment called the bit the highlight of the evening—more memorable than even the on-court action for some viewers.And finally, another user said:“Pretty sure these fans are in Dumb and Dumber costumes…with face cutouts of Stephen A Smith and Kendrick Perkins.”This tweet added to the confirmation and appreciation of the stunt, acknowledging the detail in the fans’ outfits and execution.Also Read: Tyrese Haliburton shares heartwarming moment with Obi Toppin’s daughter before crucial Indiana Pacers vs. Oklahoma City Thunder NBA Finals Game 4 From Tyrese Haliburton shrugging off criticism to two fans turning sports talk into visual satire, Game 4 of the NBA Finals was about more than basketball. It became a statement on media narratives, on confidence, and on the creative passion of Indiana’s fan base. With subtle symbolism in every stitch of those tuxedos, the message was clear: Indiana hears the noise, and they know exactly how to laugh back.

MCC introduces major boundary rule change: What is it and how does it affect the sport?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/mcc-introduces-major-boundary-rule-change-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-affect-the-sport/articleshow/121841744.cms,"In October 2026, the ICC and MCC will introduce a new catching rule in cricket, disallowing 'bunny-hop' catches where fielders jump from outside the boundary to touch the ball. Fielders can still push the ball from within the boundary, step out, and dive back in to complete a catch.

The International Cricket Council (ICC) and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) are implementing a new catching rule in cricket from October 2026 that will prohibit the 'bunny-hop' catches where fielders jump and touch the ball while being outside the boundary. The rule change will still allow catches where fielders push the ball from within the boundary, step out, and dive back to complete the catch, but any contact with the ball from outside the boundary will require the fielder to land inside the field of play for the catch to count.The MCC has developed this rule change in response to concerns about catches that appear unfair to cricket audiences. The current law only invalidates catches where the player contacts both the ball and ground while outside the boundary ropes.""MCC has devised a new wording where the 'bunny-hop' wholly beyond the boundary is removed, but these catches where the fielder pushes the ball up from inside the boundary, steps outside and then dives back in to catch the ball, are permitted,"" states the MCC note.The new rule provides specific guidelines for fielders attempting boundary catches. According to the MCC: ""Our solution has been to limit any fielder who has gone outside the boundary to touching the ball while airborne only once, and then, having done so, to be wholly grounded within the boundary for the rest of the duration of that delivery.""The MCC further clarifies: ""Even if the ball is parried – to another fielder or inside the field of play – if the fielder lands outside the boundary, or subsequently steps outside, then a boundary will be scored. For clarity, that means the fielder gets one chance, and one chance only, to touch the ball having jumped from outside the boundary. After that point, the boundary becomes a hard line – and any time they touch the ground in that delivery, whatever else happens, they must be inside. ""The new law will be reflected in ICC playing conditions as early as next week, though official implementation begins in October 2026. Under the revised rules, catches like Michael Neser's in the 2023 Big Bash League and Dewald Brevis's for Chennai Super Kings against Punjab Kings in IPL 2025 will no longer be valid.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? The exact law, numbered 19.5.2, states that a fielder not touching the ground is considered beyond the boundary if their last ground contact before touching the ball was not entirely within the boundary. This applies to all fielders contacting the ball after the bowler's delivery.Section 19.5.2.1 of the law specifies that if a fielder's initial ball contact complies with 19.5.2, they may jump from outside to touch the ball while airborne. However, all subsequent ground contact must occur within the field of play until the ball becomes dead, or a boundary will be scored.Section 19.5.2.2 further stipulates that if a fielder jumping from outside the boundary returns the ball to play, they must land and stay within the boundary until the ball becomes dead, or a boundary will be awarded.This rule change aims to eliminate controversial boundary catches while maintaining the possibility of spectacular fielding efforts that begin within the field of play. The new regulations provide clear guidelines for both players and officials regarding boundary catches.","ICC and Marylebone Cricket Club to introduce new catching rule in October 2026.

Australia cricketer Steve Smith's participation in the upcoming West Indies Test tour is uncertain after he suffered a compound dislocation of his finger during the World Test Championship final at Lord's on day three, following a dropped catch off South African captain Temba Bavuma's edge. Smith was immediately taken to the hospital after the injury occurred while fielding at slip position, where he was standing closer than usual due to the slow nature of the Lord's pitch and wearing a helmet.The dropped catch came off Mitchell Starc's bowling when Bavuma was on two runs, with the South African captain going on to score 65 more runs by the end of play, partnering with Aiden Markram who remained unbeaten on 102.The injury occurred when Smith attempted to catch an edge, resulting in a painful blow to his right little finger that caused him to immediately leave the field grimacing.The 36-year-old was first assessed in the Lord's medical rooms before being transported to hospital for X-rays and additional treatment.Medical experts indicate that a compound dislocation, where bone breaks through the skin, might require surgery and extensive rehabilitation.""He never made (it to) us (in) the dressing room, the doctor and physio got him and took him into the separate room to deal with it,"" said Assistant coach Daniel Vettori . ""So we weren't really up to speed in terms of how gruesome the injury was, we just heard that there was a fear of the compound fracture or dislocation or something of that nature. There weren't too many people running to the physio room to go and have a look. We'll just wait and see what comes back after he gets back from hospital.""The potential absence of Smith for the three-Test series against the West Indies, starting June 25 in Barbados, would be significant as he has scored four centuries in his last six Tests.The West Indies tour includes three Test matches, with the first match scheduled in Barbados, followed by games in Grenada and Jamaica.","Steve Smith suffered a compound dislocation of his finger during the World Test Championship final at Lord's.

WWE SmackDown after Money in the Bank PLE was a star-studded night with thrilling matches and moments.The June 13th edition of WWE SmackDown took place at the Rupp Arena in Lexington, Kentucky. This was the fallout episode of WWE Money in the Bank, which kicked off to a huge start, featured multiple King and Queen of the Ring tournament opening round matches, and ended with a blockbuster main event with Cody Rhodes emerging victorious.John Cena came out to open the show and spoke about his tactics on his farewell tour, which had been a success, and gave everything he wanted. He even took shots at his upcoming Night of Champions opponent, CM Punk. This led to the arrival of Cody Rhodes, who reminded Cena that he pinned him at Money in the Bank PLE. Furthermore, Randy Orton returned for the first time since losing to Cena at WWE Backlash PLE, followed by LA Knight. Cena chose to leave the ring, but R-Truth attacked him on the entrance ramp.This was the first Fatal 4-Way match in the opening round of the King of the Ring tournament. The match was highly spectacular to witness as all four competitors brought different styles to the bout, with high stakes involved.As the ending approached, Bronson Reed and Bron Breakker attacked LA Knight. Carmelo Hayes tried to take advantage with a top rope move, but landed in an RKO by Orton on top of LA Knight, who pinned him for the win and will now face Sami Zayn in the semi-finals match.This was the first Fatal 4-Way match in the opening round of the Queen of the Ring tournament. The match was an exciting in-ring showdown, with temporary alliances also forming during the match. In the final moments of the bout, Piper Niven took out Nia Jax outside the ring and looked to dispatch Michin inside the ring. Just then, Jade Cargill planted her with the Jaded to pick up the win and advance in the tournament to face Roxanne Perez in the semi-finals.This was a tag team match between The Motor City Machine Guns and Wyatt Sicks members, Dexter Lumis and Joe Gacy. The tag team action was on full display as other members of The Wyats, alongside Uncle Howdy, watched from the ringside area. The match came to an end when Dexter Lumis delivered a huge leg drop from the top rope to Chris Sabin and pinned him for the win.John Cena came out in anger to confront R-Truth, who had attacked him earlier. Instead, CM Punk came out and berated Cena in his classic style. He accused him of trying to be like him and promised to save wrestling that he is trying to ruin. As he left, Cena was once again attacked by Truth from behind and locked in the STF as Punk watched.This was the first Fatal 4-Way match in the opening round of the Queen of the Ring tournament. Originally, Chelsea Green was supposed to be in the match. However, she could not make it to the show, and Nick Aldis put Alba Fyre in the match. Much like the first match earlier in the night, it was a captivating showdown that saw an interesting end. As Charlotte Flair had Alba Fyre in the Figure Eight, Alexa Bliss planted Candice LeRae with the Sister Abigail DDT to win the match.The main event match was the second Fatal 4-Way match in the opening round of the King of the Ring tournament. It was easily the best match of the night, garnering loud applause from the audience. Moreover, it saw the action spill all over the ringside and even saw the use of tables. It came to an end when Cody Rhodes delivered the Cross Rhodes on both Shinsuke Nakamura and Andrade El Idolo and pinned Nakamura to advance to the next round.Also read: WWE introduces major creative change to accommodate Goldberg’s return","The June 13th edition of WWE SmackDown took place at the Rupp Arena in Lexington, Kentucky.

Australian assistant coach Daniel Vettori acknowledged South Africa's strong position in the ICC World Test Championship final at Lord's after day three, with the Proteas requiring just 69 runs with eight wickets remaining. Aiden Markram's historic century and his unbeaten 143-run partnership with captain Temba Bavuma have brought South Africa closer to their first world title in cricket.South Africa reached 213/2 in 56 overs, with Markram scoring an unbeaten 102 and Bavuma fighting through a hamstring injury to reach 65 not out.""I think there was optimism in the way we started with Starc and Hazlewood. There was a really good partnership to put together a total that obviously, considering the rest of the how the match had played out, was a challenging one. But under those conditions, Markram and Bavuma were exceptional and were able just to, I suppose, navigate their way through any tricky situations and then be able to put pressure back on us when it was opportune time. So it was a pretty benign wicket and obviously conditions were not assisting the ball, but that partnership was exceptional,"" Vettori said during the press conference.The Australian coach expressed concern about the difficult task ahead while praising the South African batsmen's performance.""But I think with the nature of where the ball is at and the surface, it is a difficult task, but it is a task that the group has probably done at times throughout the last three, four, some of them five, six, even longer years. But I think there is an appreciation of how well Bavuma and Markram batted to put all that pressure back on us. So, to get one of them tonight may have given that optimism. So it is going to be a real challenge tomorrow,"" he added.Regarding Steve Smith's finger injury after dropping Bavuma's catch in the slips, Vettori said they would wait for the hospital results before providing any updates.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? When asked about bowling variations, Vettori praised Mitchell Starc's natural ability to adapt.""He does that naturally and his ability to change his length and potentially swing the ball both ways. I think the success that has come from the surface has been that six to eight meter length. That is what South Africa did so well. That is what we did in the first innings. So there is sometimes an appetite for that, but there is also a concern around the score running away from us,"" he explained.""And sometimes when you go to that short ball stuff, it is hard to control the scoreboard. And that was probably our fear today, that if we could hang in those areas long enough, something would happen, like it has in the rest of the test match, but it was not to be,"" Vettori added.Earlier in the day, South Africa made steady progress with Markram and Wiaan Mulder putting together a solid partnership in the second session.Mitchell Starc's impressive innings of 58 not out had helped Australia reach 207 all out from a precarious position of 152/9, setting South Africa a target of 282 runs.Australia's first innings score was 212, while South Africa managed 138 in their first attempt. The current match situation shows Australia at 207 in their second innings, with Starc's unbeaten 58 and Alex Carey's 43 being the notable contributions. Kagiso Rabada took four wickets for 59 runs.South Africa's second innings stands at 213/2, with Markram's unbeaten century and Bavuma's half-century putting them in a strong position to achieve their first ICC title.","South Africa reached 213/2 in 56 overs, with Aiden Markram scoring an unbeaten 102.

2025 highlights: Familiar faces and dramatic falls



Is it just madness or tradition





Every year on a steep hill in Gloucestershire, England, hundreds gather to chase a rolling 7-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down a dangerously steep slope. Known as the Cooper’s Hill Cheese Rolling Contest, the event is chaotic, absurd, and completely thrilling. With participants tumbling, somersaulting, and crashing their way to the bottom, the headline “People sprint to catch a 7-pound wheel of cheese” is technically accurate, but it doesn’t quite capture the madness, tradition, and injuries that define this bizarre British spectacle. So, is it a good headline? That depends on what you’re hoping to convey.The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. Dating back at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize. It sounds simple, but the event is notorious for its steep incline, dangerous tumbles, and frequent injuries.The hill is so steep that it's nearly impossible to stay upright. Most participants end up tumbling head over heels, colliding with each other or the ground.Gravity takes over quickly, and the cheese, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, is almost never actually caught.

The Indian cricket team will conduct their final preparations for the upcoming five-match Test series against England through an intra-squad warm-up game against India A, starting June 13, 2025. The four-day practice match, which will be played behind closed doors at the request of head coach Gautam Gambhir, will not be available for live streaming as the team aims to keep their tactical plans private from the opposition.The warm-up fixture will feature 360 overs of match simulation, providing crucial preparation time for both bowlers and batsmen. This approach mirrors the team's preparation strategy implemented before the Border Gavaskar Trophy 2024-25 in Australia.The practice match holds particular significance as it offers Indian players an opportunity to transition from T20 cricket in the Indian Premier League (IPL) to the longer format. The extended session will help players adapt to English conditions before the series opener at Headingley.Jasprit Bumrah's return to Test cricket after a six-month hiatus will be closely monitored during the warm-up game. The pace spearhead, who had to leave the fifth Test in Australia due to injury, has only participated in IPL matches since recovering from a back stress fracture.The team management plans to assess Bumrah's fitness and form by having him bowl multiple spells during the practice match. This evaluation will be crucial in determining his readiness for the demanding Test series.The warm-up game will also help resolve selection dilemmas facing the team. A key decision revolves around choosing a seam bowling partner for Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, with Akash Deep and Prasidh Krishna being the contenders.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Another strategic choice awaits the team management regarding the spin department. The selection between Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav as the primary spinner presents different tactical advantages. Jadeja offers additional batting depth along with his spinning abilities, while Kuldeep could serve as an attacking option against England's aggressive batting approach.The practice match marks a significant milestone as it represents Shubman Gill 's first assignment as the official captain of the Indian Test team. The closed-door session will allow the new captain to work with his team without external pressure.The decision to conduct the warm-up match away from public view reflects the team's focus on preparation rather than publicity. This approach allows players to concentrate on acclimatization and strategy development without revealing their tactical plans to their upcoming opponents.The Test series against England, scheduled to begin on June 20, will be the first major challenge for the Indian team under Gill's leadership. The warm-up match serves as the final opportunity for the team to address various tactical and selection questions before the series commences.The comprehensive nature of the practice match, with its extensive over allocation, demonstrates the team's commitment to thorough preparation. This format ensures that all squad members get adequate time to adjust to the demands of Test cricket and English conditions.The practice match represents a crucial phase in India's preparation strategy, combining the need for match practice with tactical discretion.

Australia maintained their advantage in the World Test Championship final against South Africa at Lord's on Thursday, led by captain Pat Cummins 's exceptional bowling performance and Alex Carey's crucial 43 runs. Despite a dramatic collapse that saw Australia reduced to 73-7 in their second innings, they ended the day at 144-8, establishing a substantial lead of 218 runs.Pat Cummins delivered a remarkable spell, taking four wickets for just one run as South Africa were bowled out for 138 in response to Australia's first-innings total of 212. Cummins finished with impressive figures of 6-28, reaching the milestone of 300 Test wickets.The second day witnessed a flurry of wickets, with 28 dismissals across both teams on a pitch that offered some assistance to fast bowlers but remained playable. The match, originally scheduled for five days, could potentially conclude before the third day's end. Kagiso Rabada and Lungi Ngidi led South Africa's bowling attack in Australia's second innings. Rabada, who had already claimed 5-51 in the first innings, continued his strong performance with 3-44, while Ngidi contributed with 3-35.South Africa's captain Temba Bavuma and David Bedingham provided the only substantial resistance during their first innings, sharing a fifth-wicket partnership of 64 runs. Bavuma scored 36 while Bedingham contributed 45.The Australian collapse began when Rabada dismissed Usman Khawaja for six and Cameron Green for a duck in the 11th over. Green's brief appearance resulted in just four runs from five balls across both innings. Marnus Labuschagne, in his debut as a Test opener, was caught behind for 22 off Marco Jansen. Beau Webster, who had top-scored with 72 in Australia's first innings, fell lbw to Ngidi, reducing Australia to 48-4.The situation worsened for Australia when Cummins was bowled by Ngidi's yorker, leaving them at 73-7. However, Carey and Mitchell Starc mounted a recovery, sharing an eighth-wicket partnership of 61 runs before Carey was dismissed lbw by Rabada. The day's final over saw a missed opportunity when Jansen dropped Starc, then on 14, off Wiaan Mulder's bowling. Starc remained unbeaten on 16 at stumps.Cummins's outstanding bowling performance earned him a place on the Lord's honours board.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep. 6: Harish Thawani on cricket's TV market and the watershed moments





AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey has hit back strongly at former India captain Bhaichung Bhutia, accusing him of misleading football families through his chain of commercial academies while rejecting Bhutia’s calls for his resignation.Speaking at a press conference in New Delhi on Friday, Chaubey defended his leadership and lashed out at Bhutia, who recently demanded the AIFF president step down “for the sake of Indian football”. Bhutia had earlier alleged mismanagement and corruption in the federation.“He (Bhutia) is one of India’s best strikers, but he runs a football school chain named after him with about 20 centres nationwide. They (Bhaichung Bhutia Football Schools) are taking undue advantage by playing with the emotions of families, emotions of the people, who are thinking the man has achieved the highest level of Indian football, and if I am part of his academy, I too can make my life in it. He has promised the families of Indian football dreamers, and this is the result that we have seen,” Chaubey said. He pointed out that the Bhaichung Bhutia Football Schools (BBFS) U-17 team lost 31-0 to Minerva Academy in the I-League U-17. “This is the result of what he is promising families,” he added, also listing other poor performances to stress his point.Dismissing allegations of corruption within the AIFF, Chaubey stated, “If there was any corruption, it would have been red-flagged.These accusations come from 3-4 people who either lost elections against my team or were previously in the AIFF.” Chaubey also highlighted Bhutia’s past role as an advisor to the AIFF with a salary of Rs 1.5 lakh per month and noted that since he became president in 2022, the federation has held 11 executive committee meetings to maintain transparency.Turning to on-field matters, the AIFF chief confirmed that the executive committee will meet on June 29 to review the tenure of national team coach Manolo Marquez. The Spaniard, who took charge in August 2024 following Igor Stimac’s exit, has managed just one win — a friendly against Maldives — and India now faces the risk of missing out on the 2027 AFC Asian Cup.“Manolo is a good coach and understands Indian football well, but recent performances have raised questions. We will decide on his future soon,” Chaubey said. He blamed the lack of quality Indian strikers for the team’s struggles, pointing out that India has managed only seven goals in 2024, with three coming against Maldives.Addressing fan demands to allow Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) to play for the national team, Chaubey confirmed the AIFF is in touch with 33 eligible players. “Some have received their OCI cards. We are helping the others and working within our capacity to get approvals to strengthen our squad,” he said.The developments come amid mounting pressure on the federation to revive India’s fortunes both on and off the field.",Kalyan Chaubey has hit back at former India captain Bhaichung Bhutia.

“Goat was on to something”: Kevin Durant’s bold reaction to resurfaced Michael Jordan clip

Image via Instagram

Resurfaced video reveals Michael Jordan’s true pick for the best player



Michael Jordan chooses between LeBron & Kobe





Kevin Durant rarely misses when it comes to basketball—and apparently, not when it comes to legacy debates either. The Phoenix Suns superstar recently came across a resurfaced Michael Jordan clip that’s catching fire again on social media. In the video, Jordan jokingly mentions Durant while weighing in on the infamous Kobe Bryant vs. LeBron James question. Now, more than a decade later, Durant’s sharp but playful response has reignited the conversation, with fans and media alike taking notice.It all started when a throwback clip from 2013 began circulating across social platforms this week. In it, NBA legend Michael Jordan is asked one of basketball’s most heated questions: Kobe or LeBron? Sitting down with analyst Ahmad Rashad for the “Michael Jordan at 50” special, Jordan seemed momentarily caught off guard before throwing out an unexpected name: “Kevin Durant.”Though Jordan immediately laughed and clarified that he was joking—“Naw, I’m just kidding,” he said—the clip has lived on in NBA lore as a light-hearted but fascinating moment. And this week, it got new life when Durant himself saw the post and added fuel to the fire.“Goat was on to something,” Durant wrote in the comments section, flipping the joke into a subtle flex that left fans buzzing. Kevin Durant , who turns 37 this year and will enter his 18th NBA season, is widely recognized as one of the most skilled scorers in league history.The two-time NBA champion and two-time Finals MVP has averaged 27.2 points per game across his career while maintaining an elite shooting clip of over 50%. With that kind of resume, even a joke from Jordan feels like a nod worth keeping in the vault.The moment drew even more attention thanks to another clip included in the video—this one featuring a resurfaced quote from Kobe Bryant that added weight to the conversation. “Kevin Durant. That was the one I retired without being able to figure out how I can stop him,” Bryant once admitted. That rare praise from one all-time great to another only added gravity to Durant’s reaction.The viral interview dates back to early 2013, when Michael Jordan was reflecting on his legacy ahead of his 50th birthday. The special, titled “Michael Jordan at 50,” gave the six-time NBA champion a chance to weigh in on the league’s future—and the players most often compared to him.When asked “Kobe or LeBron?” by Rashad, Jordan initially responded with a smirk and said “Kevin Durant” before laughing it off. Then, he gave a more measured answer.“In terms of dominance of the game of basketball, at this stage it’s LeBron,” Jordan acknowledged at the time, crediting James for his physical impact on the game during his Miami Heat prime.But Jordan wasn’t done. He added a clear preference for Bryant’s mentality and hunger.“Championship-wise, it’s Kobe Bryant . He wants it so bad and he’s willing to go to the extreme,” Jordan said. “Guarding a point guard at the age of 34, playing 38 minutes, 40 minutes, that’s ludicrous.”Jordan even suggested that Bryant shared his obsessive drive for greatness: “He’s cursed as much as I am.”When it came to championships—a standard Jordan always held in the highest regard—he summed it up plainly: “Five (rings) beats one.”More than a decade later, the Kobe vs. LeBron debate remains heated—but the narrative has evolved. LeBron James , who joined the Lakers in 2018, now holds four championship rings and recently became the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, the first player ever to surpass 50,000 career points. His longevity and all-around excellence have kept him in the GOAT conversation.Bryant, who tragically passed away in 2020, remains a symbol of competitive spirit. He finished his career with five rings and a 5–2 record in the Finals, while Jordan, famously, went 6–0.Also Read: LeBron James or Kobe Bryant? Dwight Howard’s shocking pick in the legendary NBA debate between his two former teammates What began as a quick-witted joke from Jordan in a 2013 interview has taken on new life in 2025, especially now that Durant has joined the chat. With Kobe openly praising Durant’s unguardable game, and Jordan once (even jokingly) tossing his name into the GOAT conversation, Durant’s legacy is secure.","Kevin Durant responded to a resurfaced Michael Jordan clip from 2013.

The Trade Mechanics: Jonathan Kuminga for Collins





Theare reportedly considering a bold sign-and-trade deal to acquire ex- Atlanta Hawks forward John Collins, potentially sending young star Jonathan Kuminga the other way. This move aims to address the Warriors’ glaring need for consistent scoring beyond Stephen Curry. Golden State Warriors ’ lack of reliable scorers outside Curry was exposed in their 2025 Western Conference Semi-Finals loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. While Kuminga showed flashes of brilliance, his restricted free agency status makes him a prime trade asset for a team seeking an immediate upgrade.The Jazz, meanwhile, are open to trading Collins after he opts into his $26.5 million expiring contract. As reported by Evan Sidery: ""The Jazz plan to explore trade scenarios for John Collins once he opts into his $26.5 million expiring contract. Collins averaged 18.9 points and 8.2 rebounds on a 62.8 TS% with Utah this season.""John Collins brings a mix of athleticism, floor spacing, and efficiency that could elevate the Golden State Warriors’ offense. Here’s how his 2024-25 stats stack up:His ability to stretch the floor and finish plays aligns perfectly with Golden State’s drive-and-kick system. Pairing Collins with Stephen Curry could create mismatches and open up the offense even further.Here’s why this deal makes sense for both sides:- Warriors Get: A proven scorer who fits their system, adding much-needed firepower.- Jazz Get: A young, high-upside player in Kuminga to build around for the future.Collins’ expiring $26.5 million contract could be matched via a sign-and-trade involving Kuminga, who is due for a new deal. Utah nearly traded Collins in February, and Golden State might finally pull the trigger.What This Means for the Golden State Warriors’ FutureAdding Collins could rejuvenate Golden State’s title hopes. His efficiency and versatility would take pressure off Curry, while Kuminga’s departure would be a calculated risk for a team in win-now mode.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers predicted to sign $238 million Utah Jazz to for Big 3 with LeBron James and Luka Doncic and bolster title odds If this trade materializes, the Warriors could re-emerge as a serious contender in the loaded Western Conference.","The Golden State Warriors are reportedly considering a sign-and-trade deal to acquire ex-Atlanta Hawks forward John Collins.

Other Indiana Pacers dealing with minor ailments





is managing lower leg discomfort but has no doubts about suiting up for Game 3 of the NBA Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Despite visible limping after Sunday’s 123-107 loss, Haliburton remains confident he’ll be ready when the series resumes Wednesday night.The Indiana Pacers and Thunder are tied 1-1, with Game 3 tipping off at 8:30 p.m. ET in Indianapolis. Tyrese Haliburton, averaging 15.5 points and six assists in the series, acknowledged the injury but downplayed its severity.“It’s really just a lower leg thing, I’m gonna leave it at that,” Tyrese Haliburton said Tuesday. “I don’t think there’s anything more to elaborate.”Though he didn’t specify whether the issue was related to his calf or ankle, Haliburton’s history of hamstring problems—including a strain that sidelined him during last year’s Eastern Conference finals—raises questions about his durability. Still, neither he nor the Indiana Pacers appear overly concerned.Head coach Rick Carlisle confirmed Haliburton participated fully in Tuesday’s practice and expects him to play. “At this time of year, I don’t know if anybody’s feeling perfect,” Carlisle said. “He has some discomfort, but each day is getting better. This is the time of year where it just doesn’t get any better than this.”Beyond health, Tyrese Haliburton’s bigger challenge has been Oklahoma City’s elite defense.The Thunder, the NBA’s top-rated defensive team this season, have thrown multiple defenders at him, including Luguentz Dort, Cason Wallace, Alex Caruso, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.The strategy has worked so far. Haliburton has struggled with efficiency, shooting just 33% from three and averaging four turnovers per game. His assist-to-turnover ratio, usually stellar at nearly 9:1, has dipped significantly.“I feel like I haven’t been great by any means through the first two games,” Haliburton admitted. “I’m just trying to take what I can to prepare for Game 3. The answers always lie in the film.”Indiana’s turnover issues have been a major storyline. The team has coughed up the ball 40 times in two games, with many mistakes leading directly to Thunder points. Carlisle joked about some of the miscues, saying, “Some of our turnovers have been so violently bad, the opponent hasn’t even had a chance to catch the ball.”But the problem is no laughing matter. Against a disciplined team like Oklahoma City, wasted possessions are costly. “You can’t play too careful against them, or otherwise you’ll never get a basket,” Carlisle added.Carlisle also mentioned that a couple of other players are “slightly under the weather,” though he didn’t name them. Forward Aaron Nesmith (ankle) and center Tony Bradley (hip) have dealt with injuries earlier in the playoffs, but their status for Game 3 remains unclear.With the series shifting to Indianapolis, Tyrese Haliburton and the Indiana Pacers have a chance to regain control. His ability to shake off the leg discomfort and solve Oklahoma City’s defensive schemes will be key to Indiana’s title hopes.Also read: Skip Bayless’ Drops Bombshell After OKC Thunder Game 2 Domination – Can the Indiana Pacers Respond?

49ers’ Trent Williams believes Brock Purdy is just getting started



Trent Williams is all in on Brock Purdy being the 49ers franchise QB





When Trent Williams, the San Francisco 49ers’ legendary left tackle, took the podium earlier this week, his usual charisma lit up the room — but it was the mention of Brock Purdy’s new contract that brought out a different kind of joy. With a grin stretching ear to ear, Williams spoke with genuine pride about the quarterback’s journey from an overlooked draft pick to one of the NFL’s highest-paid players.“For me, it’s just super, super fulfilling just to watch a guy like Brock,” Trent Williams shared. “You talk about a Cinderella story, I think this is the epitome of that. A guy going from making a few hundred thousand a year to making 50 million a year, it’s astronomical, and it couldn’t have happened to a better guy.”Purdy’s meteoric rise began in 2022 when he was selected with the final pick of the draft — No. 262 overall. Thrust into action in Week 13 after Jimmy Garoppolo's injury, the unassuming rookie guided the 49ers to a commanding 33-17 win over the Miami Dolphins. The following week, he was named the starter — and never looked back.Since then, Purdy has carried San Francisco to back-to-back NFC Championship Games and a Super Bowl appearance.Despite a rocky 2024 season, where the team stumbled to a 6-11 record and missed the playoffs, confidence in Purdy hasn’t wavered inside the 49ers’ locker room. Both head coach Kyle Shanahan and GM John Lynch have stood firmly behind him — and Williams is no different.“He is the guy for this team,” Williams declared. “He is the guy for this franchise. This is just the tip of the iceberg. He is going to get another contract, he’s going to win a lot of football games. He’s that good of a player. Super, super happy to see that for him. I love him like a brother, so I couldn’t be any happier.”This offseason, Purdy signed a five-year, $265 million extension, securing his place with the 49ers through the 2030 season. Although initial negotiations were rocky — with Purdy reportedly seeking $65 million per year — the final agreement landed at $53 million annually, including $182.55 million in guarantees. It's a significant bet on a quarterback who still has plenty to prove, especially after a step back statistically in 2024 (3,864 yards, 20 TDs, 12 INTs).Purdy now faces the challenge of leading a restructured team, with several key departures in free agency. However, he can rest easy knowing his blindside remains secure. Williams, now 37 and still playing at an elite level, has no plans to retire. He’s under contract through 2026 after signing a three-year, $82.66 million extension and has expressed interest in playing into his 40s.As the 49ers prepare for the 2025 season, both Purdy and Williams enter with full health and high hopes. And if Williams' smile is any indication, the team’s belief in their quarterback is stronger than ever.Also Read: ""She makes everything easier"": Josh Allen’s romantic line after marrying Hailee Steinfeld proves he’s winning both on and off the field","Brock Purdy signed a five-year, $265 million contract extension with the San Francisco 49ers.
