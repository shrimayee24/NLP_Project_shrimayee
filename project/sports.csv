MVP Credentials Remain Untouched Despite Runner-Up Finish

Why Nikola Jokic is The Complete Package: Skill, IQ, and Showmanship

How Jokic’s Legacy is Still in the Making

’s journey from a 41st overall pick in the 2014 NBA Draft to one of the league’s most dominant forces is nothing short of remarkable. In August 2025, NBA.com confirmed what many fans and analysts had already concluded - the Denver Nuggets ’ superstar center is the top player in the Western Conference. This honor reflects not only his unmatched individual skill but also his transformative influence on the Nuggets and the NBA as a whole.The 2024-25 season was another masterpiece for Nikola Jokic . He averaged a triple-double—29.6 points, 12.7 rebounds, and 10.2 assists per game—while maintaining jaw-dropping efficiency, shooting 57.6% from the floor and 41.7% from beyond the arc. His all-around dominance put him in the rarest company in league history.Shaun Powell of NBA.com summed up Jokic’s season best: “He is not only the best player in basketball, but he is also experiencing one of the greatest runs in the history of the sport… His ability to achieve triple-doubles consistently and his capacity to carry the franchise are clear indicators of his greatness.”Adding to his historic run, Jokic became the first player ever to record multiple 30-point, 20-rebound, 20-assist games in a single season.His consistent recognition as Western Conference Player of the Week and Player of the Month further underlined his dominance.Although Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder edged him out for the 2025 MVP award, Nikola Jokic’s resume remains among the most decorated in modern NBA history. With three MVP trophies already (2021, 2022, 2024) and a fourth narrowly missed, the 30-year-old has firmly cemented his place among the game’s all-time greats.Denver’s 2025 playoff exit to the Thunder only fueled Jokic’s motivation. With his leadership and consistency, the Nuggets remain poised for another championship run in the upcoming season.What makes Jokic truly unique is how he dominates without relying on raw athleticism. His unmatched basketball IQ, silky shooting touch, and creative passing make him nearly impossible to game-plan against. Whether it’s a no-look dime, a full-court outlet pass, or intricate footwork in the post, Jokic turns routine possessions into highlights.His ability to stretch the floor forces defenders into difficult choices, while his calm demeanor under pressure allows him to control the pace of games. Off the court, his humility and dry humor have endeared him to fans, making him one of the most relatable superstars in sports.Nikola Jokic is not just the Nuggets’ cornerstone—he’s a trailblazer for the modern NBA center. His style of play has redefined expectations for big men, inspiring the next generation to blend scoring, playmaking, and versatility.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Boston Celtics May Part Ways with $45 Million NBA Champion After Latest Roster Shake-Up Even in a Western Conference loaded with talent—Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Anthony Edwards, Luka Doncic—Jokic’s sustained brilliance continues to set him apart. The stats tell part of the story, but the way he elevates his teammates and delivers must-watch performances night after night is why NBA.com crowned him the king of the West—and why his reign may extend across the entire league for years to come.","Nikola Jokic averaged 29.6 points, 12.7 rebounds, and 10.2 assists per game in the 2024-25 season.

Why This Move Makes Sense for Sacramento

What It Means for the Golden State Warriors

The’ offseason plans have hit a roadblock as restricted free agentremains unsigned. While both sides have yet to reach an agreement, a sign-and-trade has emerged as a realistic fallback — one that could have ripple effects beyond Golden State, potentially influencing’s future.Around the league, several teams are keeping a close watch on Jonathan Kuminga ’s situation, but the Sacramento Kings have stood out as a serious contender. According to The Carmichael Dave Show with Jason Ross on Sactown Sports 1140, a deal involving Kuminga could directly tie into the possibility of Westbrook landing in Sacramento.“We do know this: For the Westbrook thing to happen, the Kuminga thing would almost definitely have to happen,” they said during the broadcast. (H/t: Sporting News)Russell Westbrook has been linked to the Kings since declining his player option with the Denver Nuggets earlier this offseason. A sign-and-trade for Jonathan Kuminga could give Sacramento the flexibility needed to make room for the nine-time All-Star.This could involve the Kings moving a guard — such as Devin Carter or Malik Monk — to balance the roster and salary cap.If the deal goes through, Sacramento’s lineup could look significantly different:Kuminga would likely step straight into a starting forward role alongside DeRozan and Sabonis, giving Sacramento a more athletic and versatile frontcourt.Sacramento finished last season with a 40-42 record, narrowly missing out on playoff contention. Adding Russell Westbrook ’s playmaking and Kuminga’s developing two-way game could push them back into the Western Conference playoff race without having to commit to a full rebuild.Key Benefits for the Kings:• Immediate talent boost in both backcourt and frontcourt.• Avoids dismantling the core while still addressing weaknesses.• Keeps the team competitive without entering a long-term rebuild phase.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Eyeing Reunion Between 5x NBA Champion and LeBron James to Improve Title Odds For the Golden State Warriors, the decision boils down to whether they’re willing to ride out the stalemate with Kuminga or capitalize on his trade value now.

NHL's decision to host outdoor games in Florida as part of the 2026 Stadium Series has sparked skepticism among fans (SS via Twitter)

The NHL ’s bold push into non-traditional markets continues to raise eyebrows, especially with the recent announcement confirming two outdoor games in Florida as part of the 2026 Navy Federal Credit Union Stadium Series. While the league celebrates expansion and spectacle, fans are far from universally thrilled.The Tampa Bay Lightning will host the Boston Bruins at Raymond James Stadium on February 1, 2026 — marking the first-ever outdoor NHL game in a football stadium in Florida. A month earlier, the Florida Panthers will square off against the New York Rangers at loanDepot Park in Miami. On paper, it’s a celebration of hockey’s growing presence in the Sunshine State. But fans aren’t exactly buying the hype.The weather is the biggest concern. February temperatures in Florida often hover in the high 60s or even low 70s, leading many to question whether the ice can hold up in such conditions. As one fan bluntly put it, “It seems pretty dumb to play outdoor hockey games in Florida.” Others raised doubts about player safety and game quality, asking whether the NHL is sacrificing substance for spectacle.Still, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman stood by the decision. “Stanley Cups, strings of sellouts, and the exponential growth of youth and high school hockey throughout the state have demonstrated that Florida is a hockey hotbed,” Bettman said. “Never let it be said that our League isn’t willing to accept a challenge.”Along with the game announcements, the NHL unveiled the official logo for the 2026 Stadium Series — featuring a pirate ship with orange and blue accents. Some fans were unimpressed, with @BosSportsBros sarcastically commenting, “Seems pretty dumb to play outdoor hockey games in Florida.”Another user @OgBardownski wrote, “When will the NHL learn that no one wants to watch the islanders.”Another user @2MINIHULK wrote, “NHL refusing to give the Sharks any PR, per usual”.Also Read: Mitch Marner’s shocking trade shakes Leafs Nation as Nick Robertson trade buzz grows louder Whether this gamble pays off remains to be seen.

Three-time Stanley Cup champion Patrick Kane, a Chicago Blackhawks legend, recently weighed in on the growth and potential of 19-year-old phenom Connor Bedard — and his message was one of strong support. Speaking on the “Breakaway with Pat Boyle” podcast, the former Blackhawks star, now with the Detroit Red Wings, acknowledged Bedard's early struggles but made it clear that the young center is on the right path.Patrick Kane, a Chicago Blackhawks legend, weighed in on rising star Connor Bedard’s development, praising his skills, work ethic, and potential as the franchise’s cornerstone for the future.""He's probably understanding a little bit more of what to expect on a nightly basis,” Kane said, noting how Bedard is adjusting to the physical and mental toll of an 82-game NHL season. Kane referenced his own rookie days, admitting it’s normal for young stars to go “five to seven games without producing” as they adapt to the pace and pressure of the league.Still, Kane emphasized that Bedard’s flashes of brilliance are undeniable: “He’s got moments throughout the game where he has the puck, he makes plays that you're like, OK, not many guys can do that… Whether it's a move or a pass, the way he shoots the puck — I think he's got a really bright future.""What stood out most to Kane wasn’t just Bedard’s talent — it was his mentality. ""He cares, and he wants to be great,” Kane said. “That's half the battle.”That work ethic and mindset, Kane added, should ease any concerns Blackhawks fans may have about their franchise cornerstone. With 22 goals and 61 points in 68 games during his rookie season, followed by a full 82-game sophomore campaign with 23 goals, Bedard is already proving his durability and growth.Kane, once the face of the franchise himself, believes the Blackhawks are in good hands — and fans can rest easy knowing Bedard is committed to greatness. “If I was a fan or part of the organization,” Kane concluded, “he’d be the least of my worries.”Also Read: Connor Bedard is carrying a franchise with no real plan — why are the Blackhawks wasting a generational talent?","Patrick Kane, a Chicago Blackhawks legend, weighed in on rising star Connor Bedard’s development.

Travis Kelce throws Super Bowl LIX loss ‘in the trash’ as he eyes a powerful Chiefs comeback



Chiefs Steve Spagnuolo and Select Players Speak to the Media at Training Camp | AUGUST 6, 2025

Chiefs is ready and all-in for 2025



After a humbling defeat in Super Bowl LIX, most players might still carry the sting into a new season. But not Travis Kelce . As the Kansas City Chiefs regroup for another shot at glory, their star tight end has made it clear: the past is behind him, and he’s laser-focused on what lies ahead. Entering his 13th NFL season, Kelce is embracing the grind with renewed energy and a championship mindset that continues to define his legendary career.Travis Kelce isn’t letting the blowout loss to the Philadelphia Eagles define the offseason narrative. “I've thrown that thing in the trash,” he said candidly, as reported by ESPN’s Nate Taylor. “I've moved on. It happened sooner than you can imagine. I was pretty focused on this year in the offseason.”That mental shift seems to have done wonders for the soon-to-be 36-year-old. Rather than sulking in the shadows of what could’ve been a historic three-peat, Kelce is leading by example. According to Taylor, he hasn’t missed a single offseason practice and has consistently been one of the Chiefs’ most active participants in training camp.""You've got to go through the dog days and enjoy it for what it is, man,"" Kelce said.""We're rocking and rolling, man. It's training camp, so you're going to feel the soreness and the heavy workload you're getting every day. You've got to enjoy it for what it is and fight through that.""Head coach Andy Reid couldn’t help but praise his commitment: “He's svelte right now. He looks like he's 20... I’m not sure he didn’t come in first on the whole conditioning thing.” Reid emphasized just how much effort Kelce has put in, noting, “You can see he’s been working out.

Stepping into big shoes after Justin Tucker’s controversial exit

Confidence and chemistry could define the future of Baltimore’s special teams

Baltimore Ravens rookie kicker Tyler Loop is turning heads after a flawless 7-for-7 showing at training camp, capped by a jaw-dropping 60-yarder. With Justin Tucker out amid controversy, Loop’s consistency and swagger are making waves—leaving fans and coaches wondering if the Ravens have already found their next special teams star.The Baltimore Ravens may have found their next great kicker in rookie Tyler Loop, whose training camp performance has quickly turned heads—and possibly secured him the starting role. In an open practice attended by thousands of fans, Loop went 7-for-7 on field goals, nailing attempts from distances of 28 to 55 yards, before finishing with an electric 60-yarder that sent fans and teammates into a frenzy.“The second it left my foot, I’m like, ‘There we go,’” Loop told ESPN, reliving the highlight moment where he celebrated by twirling his finger in the air—a confident move that summed up his rising momentum in camp.Loop’s rapid rise comes during a transitional moment for the Ravens. The team released Justin Tucker—widely regarded as the most accurate kicker in NFL history—in May following multiple allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct. With veteran John Hoyland also waived last week, Loop is now the lone kicker on the roster.The Ravens selected the 24-year-old in the sixth round of the 2025 NFL Draft after evaluating over 30 prospects nationwide.Head coach John Harbaugh praised Loop’s reliability, revealing that he has hit 51 of 55 kicks in team drills.“He's kicking well enough to win the job,” Harbaugh said. “But as we know, it's going to be the [preseason] games that's going to mean the most.” Still, his near-perfect practice under the stadium lights earned him an “A++” from Harbaugh—clearly signaling that Loop is more than just a placeholder.What’s most impressive isn’t just Loop’s leg—it’s his mindset. Ravens punter Jordan Stout, who also serves as Loop’s holder, shared that their system measured the 60-yard field goal as potentially good from 67 yards.“He's a pretty confident guy in the first place,” Stout said. “It may not change anything. He's confident enough now, in the best way possible.”Also Read: How to watch Hard Knocks: Date, time, where to watch and everything you need to know about the must-watch NFL series premiere If Loop’s confidence holds in preseason action, Baltimore may have already locked down its kicker for the foreseeable future.","Baltimore Ravens rookie kicker Tyler Loop is turning heads after a flawless 7-for-7 showing at training camp.

The Buffalo Bills quarterback mixed humor with heartfelt emotion as he reflected on the couple’s private ceremony, giving fans an unexpected glimpse into their off-field romance.Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen is known for his cannon arm and fearless leadership, but fans saw a softer, more humorous side of him in the latest episode of Hard Knocks: Training Camp with the Buffalo Bills.

According to Steinfeld, they wanted everyone “to come and be present,” enforcing a no-phone policy that created a more personal and meaningful experience.The “Sinners” star later reflected on the weekend through a heartfelt post shared via Beau Society, writing: “I’m sitting here with Josh, and we’re reminiscing on the best weekend of our lives for the millionth time.”She added, ""...Over the past two weeks, random yet very specific memories have been popping back into our heads, and we’ve been blurting them out to each other, often through smiles, laughs, and tears.""The festivities even featured an “underground after-party,” proving the couple knows how to mix romance with fun.Also Read: “She’s born for the Bills Mafia”: Chad Michael Murray sparks Bills buzz by naming Hailee Steinfeld the 'First Lady of Buffalo’ As Allen heads into his ninth NFL season, fans can expect him to continue balancing a high-stakes career with his new life as a married man.

The possibility of a blockbuster move linking thetohas quickly become one of the most intriguing storylines in the NBA trade rumor mill. With Young eligible for a four-year, $222 million extension and coming off a season where he averaged 24.2 points and led the league with 11.6 assists, the idea of pairing him with Giannis Antetokounmpo is drawing serious attention.For the Milwaukee Bucks , adding an elite playmaker could be the key to unlocking another championship run, while for Atlanta, the decision hinges on whether to commit long-term to their ball-dominant All-Star or pivot toward a new team direction.One of the most prominent names in this season’s trade chatter is Atlanta Hawks star guard Trae Young. Trae Young has been the driving force of the Hawks’ offense, delivering 24.2 points per game alongside a league-best 11.6 assists last season. His vision and shot creation make him an elite playmaker, and at just 26 years old, he remains in his athletic prime.Yet, Young’s style comes with concerns. His ball-dominant approach can limit offensive diversity, and his defensive shortcomings have been a consistent issue for Atlanta’s overall performance.Young is signed through 2027 and is eligible for a four-year, $222 million extension. His current salary already ranks among the highest in the league, which raises questions about Atlanta’s future financial flexibility.The Hawks must decide if they are committed to building long-term around such a costly piece.This offseason, the Hawks reshaped their roster with notable moves:• Acquired Kristaps Porzingis via trade• Signed Nickeil Alexander-Walker• Added Luke Kennard for perimeter shooting• Drafted forward Asa NewellThese additions suggest a shift toward a more balanced offensive system with improved floor spacing. However, they also create challenges in future salary distribution, especially if Young commands a new max extension.If Atlanta’s front office is unsure about committing to a long-term deal, now may be the optimal time to explore trade scenarios to maximize Young’s value rather than risk losing him for nothing in the future.As Brandon Austin of Proo Football Network noted, “These aren’t hard-and-fast predictions, but rather reasonable possibilities.” That sentiment perfectly captures the current situation for Trae Young and the Hawks. While he remains the face of the franchise today, the combination of salary cap implications, team direction, and market interest means Atlanta’s star could be one of the league’s most talked-about names in trade discussions this season.Also read: NBA.com Hails Nikola Jokic as Undisputed King of the Western Conference After Historic Season with the Denver Nuggets If you want, I can now expand this into a full 30-team “one trade chip per team” feature following this same structure.

NEW DELHI: Former India opener Navjot Singh Sidhu on Wednesday praised head coach Gautam Gambhir for showing conviction and belief during India’s hard-fought five-match Test series in England, and questioned his critics, asking if they would now “stand up and greet him” after the 2-2 draw. India, touring without recently retired legends Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , produced spirited performances across five closely-contested matches to hold England to a commendable draw on their home turf.Reflecting on the series outcome, sealed with a memorable win in the fifth and final Test at The Oval, Sidhu said Gambhir deserves credit for India’s success.“We do a lot of hero-worshipping. I want to say that whenever India plays even a little badly, anyone and everyone climbs on Gautam Gambhir and blames him. Will you stand up and greet him today?” Sidhu asked on his YouTube channel.He acknowledged that playing wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav might have yielded results, but applauded Gambhir for sticking to his methods and backing emerging talent.“It was Gautam Gambhir who insisted on this transition, who gave opportunities to guys like Akash Deep and Washington. Yes, Kuldeep was maybe a better option. But he had conviction.There will be scope for improvement today and tomorrow as well. But for someone who has been questioned and criticised so much, today give him the due that he deserves.”Sidhu added: “There were many unknowns when the team went who had not made their name. Gambhir had told three to four big names are missing from the team but think of it as an opportunity for others to establish themselves.""His words have proven to be true. Be it Brisbane, Perth, or England, history has been scripted by youngsters and it is a big thing.""Gambhir had entered the England tour under considerable pressure, following a historic Test series whitewash at home to New Zealand and disappointing results in Australia.

How and why Rishabh Pant's England tour could come to an abrupt end due to toe fracture

Pant paid fee directly





VIJAYAPURA: India's wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant is well-known for his on-field valour. His swashbuckling, series-winning unbeaten 89 at the Gabba in Australia in 2021 is as much a part of cricketing folklore as is the image of him hobbling out to bat with a fractured toe in the recent Manchester Test against England and completing a half century.Now, the lion-hearted cricketer has added one more feather to his cap - this time with an off-the-field gesture, playing Good Samaritan to a needy college student from Bilagi taluk in Vijayapura district.The Delhi cricketer has funded Jyoti Kanabur's college fees of Rs 40,000, thereby keeping her degree-course dreams alive. The student from Rabakavi village told TOI she had scored 83% in PU Commerce.However, with her parents earning just about Rs 15,000 a month from the humble eatery they run in their village, funding a Rs 40,000 college fee was a farcry. In a desperate bid to make ends meet, they borrowed that amount from individuals in their village.In a huge relief to Jyoti and her family, the burden of that Rs 40,000 loan has been taken off their shoulders in one go - thanks to Pant. ""We are relieved that Pant has paid the entire amount,"" said Jyoti, who had pursued her PU at New English PU College in neighbouring Galagali village.Jyoti is the youngest of our four children, and the first to join a degree course,"" said a visibly elated Tirthayya and Roopa, Jyoti's parents.Jyoti's family initially approached Anil Hunashimatti, a village contractor and well-wisher, for help, who had once heard about another Indian cricketer, KL Rahul, offering financial assistance to a needy undergraduate student in Dharwad.Hunashimatti got in touch with a person who earlier knew Rahul and is currently known to Pant, and the wicketkeeper-batsman was approached for help, who readily answered the call.Srikant Lagali, the administrator for BLDE Association at Commerce, BHS Arts and TGP Science College, Jamkhandi, said: ""During accounts verification, we found out that Jyoti had paid the fees twice, with one payment coming directly from Rishabh Pant. After speaking to Jyoti, we immediately refunded Rs 40,000 to her.""He further said the association has been offering free education to about 70 needy students every year.""Many of our students, like Chaitra Burji, Sushma Gugad and others, have represented the Indian cycling team at international events such as the Asean Games. Had Jyoti approached us, we would have waived her fees, too,"" Lagali said, adding that the association has sent a 'thank you' note to Pant.","Rishabh Pant pays college fees of Jyoti Kanabur, a student from Vijayapura.

KOLKATA: Playing for Jamshedpur FC , Mohammed Sanan had a brilliant last season as the team made it to the semifinals of the Indian Super League (ISL) playoffs and the Super Cup final. His good showing also helped him get a call-up to the India U-23 side that played two friendlies against Tajikistan and Kyrgyz Republic.But along with hundreds of footballers across the country, his world too faces great uncertainty due to the uncertainty over this season’s ISL, which was put on hold last month. Sanan didn’t hold back when asked about it.“I am worried, yes. I was just talking to the team’s media manager about what is going to happen and like when will the season start?

This affects the players’ mentality because we don’t know what will happen in the future, and nothing is clear yet,” Barla said.For the player from Khunti, Jharkhand, who lost his father in 2014, this, naturally, is affecting his performance on the field too.“It affects our confidence and performance because our future depends on our football career, and if this stops, it will be a big crisis for players,” added the 22-year-old, who unlike many others has been lucky to be a part of the ongoing Durand Cup alongside other JFC players.In times of such crisis, the one silver lining for the duo and it is that they have been playing under Khalid Jamil, only recently been given the reins of the Indian men’s senior national team.Speaking about their experience with Jamil, Sanan said, “It feels special and honoured to play under him and it’s a big achievement for us too because our team performed well and that’s why he was chosen for the national team.”On what makes Jamil special, Sanan added, “He’s a very hard-working coach. He never takes a day off, and when there is no training, he always calls the players and arranges meetings with them.”Barla is now looking forward to JFC’s next group game against 1 Ladakh FC on Friday, which incidentally will be Jamil’s first game since being named the India coach. While all eyes will be on Jamil, Barla is not too concerned about it. “It will be like any other match, and the mentality will remain the same,” he said.Having said that, Jamil will certainly look to win the tournament and hope to see his team put up an impressive show against the debutants from Ladakh.",Mohammed Sanan and Nikhil Barla were part of the India U-23 side that played two friendlies against Tajikistan and Kyrgyz Republic. Sanan says he is worried about the uncertainty over the Indian Super League. Barla is looking forward to JFC's next group game against 1 Ladakh FC on Friday.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123156834,imgsize-31146,width-400,resizemode-4/123156834.jpg"

Travis Kelce Still Hungry, But Future Quietly Shapes Up

Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, is heading into his 13th NFL season and turns 36 just before Week 5 when the Chiefs face the Jacksonville Jaguars on ESPN’s Monday Night Football. At age 35 now, many wonder if this might be his final year on the field. Still, Kelce remains a major part of the offence and his media and business interests off the field make retirement talk natural. During a media session in early August 2025 in St. Joseph, Missouri, he gave a sharp answer when asked about his training‑camp memories, hinting at his long view on football next season and beyond.At a press conference in St. Joseph, Missouri, on a Wednesday during training camp, reporters asked the three‑time Super Bowl winner, Travis Kelce, what would be his favorite memory if this camp turned out to be his last. He simply said,hat brief line shows he’s not thinking about retiring any time soon at least not in the middle of camp.Head coach Andy Reid has likewise said Kelce remains key to the team, adding that there’s been no concrete retirement talk between them. General manager Brett Veach has also confirmed Kelce looks motivated and is under contract for the coming season.Even following a terrible Super Bowl LIX defeat and a career-worst season, Travis Kelce keeps training under Andy Reid. At a press conference in May 2025, teammate Patrick Mahomes stated Kelce is trying very hard to outperform last year and does not behave like someone prepared to retire.Also Read: “ Until We Got Married”: Kansas City Chiefs Star Patrick Mahomes Opens Up About How Brittany Supported Him Since High School Patrck Mahomes remarked that Kelce's physique is better than it has ever been as he exercises in Florida.Meanwhile, at the same 2025 training camp, Andy Reid named Noah Gray as Kelce’s eventual replacement. Gray has been mentored by Kelce since joining in 2021. This signals the team preparing for a transition, even as Kelce stays focused on the season ahead.","Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, is heading into his 13th NFL season and turns 36 just before Week 5.

IND vs ENG: Mohammed Siraj reflects on memorable win at The Oval

Mohammed Siraj was the leading wicket-taker in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.

Mohammed Siraj in Test cricket Matches Wickets Average Strike Rate With Jasprit Bumrah 25 74 35.00 57.3 Without Jasprit Bumrah 16 49 25.10 44.3 Without Bumrah & Mohammed Shami 13 43 22.83 41.2

The reason?

Mohammed Siraj was adjudged the Player of the Match at The Oval. (Getty Images)

Stepping out of the shadows of legends like Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and even Jasprit Bumrah is no easy task. To perform, carve your own identity, and make a statement that says, 'Yes, I’m here too. I can deliver, bleed for my team, play with fire, go full throttle, and rattle the opposition to secure a win' - that takes immense belief. That’s exactly where Mohammed Siraj Team India ’s very own 'Mian' - a nickname fondly given by his teammates - stood tall, firm and etched his name on English soil.Without making much noise, Siraj entered the series - with some expectations, but certainly not as many as those placed on senior pro Jasprit Bumrah . All eyes were on Bumrah to lead India’s bowling attack. He was expected to play only three Tests due to workload management, and rightly so. India’s hopes largely rested on his shoulders.But when the series ended, the man front and centre of every highlights package, every news bulletin, every social media account was a different one.The fans’ affection shifted towards one man. The team leaned on him. He became the nightmare for the opposition. The volume of the ohhhs and aahhs rose, and the man delivered - Siraj.By the end of the series, Siraj emerged as the highest wicket-taker with 23 scalps and was deservedly named Player of the Match at The Oval. More importantly, he stamped his authority - his presence - and without uttering a word, declared: I can lead this pace attack too. The big takeaway is that it all came in Bumrah’s absence. He made it clear: I can be the one who charges in, fierce and fearless.Siraj made his debut in 2020 against Australia when the likes of Bumrah, Ishant Sharma, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umesh Yadav, and Mohammed Shami were already established names. Over time, Ishant, Bhuvneshwar, and Umesh faded from the main frame - and that’s when Siraj’s rise truly began.He played in Australia, England, the West Indies, South Africa, and Bangladesh - took wickets, dismissed big names, became the captain’s trusted option - but the Siraj who could lead the pack was still missing.Then came the England series - perhaps a script written by fate - for Siraj to reveal what had long remained hidden within.When Bumrah plays, the opposition’s focus automatically shifts to him. But Siraj’s numbers tell a different tale - he becomes a different beast when Bumrah is not around.Yes, Siraj with and without Bumrah are two different stories.In the 25 Tests he’s played alongside Bumrah, Siraj has taken 74 wickets at an average of 35.00 and a strike rate of 57.3.But in 16 Tests without Bumrah, Siraj has claimed 49 wickets — at an average of 25.1 and a strike rate of 44.3.There’s more.In the 13 Tests where neither Bumrah nor Shami played, Siraj picked up 43 wickets, averaging 22.83 and striking every 41.2 deliveries.Possibly the leadership instincts that get activated when responsibility falls solely on his shoulders — the hunger to be the main man, the fire to be the captain’s go-to bowler, no matter the situation or conditions.In the fifth and final Test, Siraj gave it everything. Every part of his heart and soul. He hit the right areas, beat batters with nip-backers, deliveries that jagged in, balls that angled across, jaffas, inswingers, and outswingers. He kept everyone on the edge of their seats. It was nerve-wracking, heart-pounding stuff. He was exhausted, down but never out.Injuries struck the team, but Siraj stayed firm - his message loud in action: 'Don’t worry, I’m here'.He bowled 1,113 deliveries in the series - the most by any bowler - across all 10 innings of a five-match Test series. That’s an enormous workload. But Siraj made the Herculean effort look routine. And this wasn’t the first time. He had bowled 953 deliveries in the 2024 away series against Australia.This is why Siraj is Team India’s true workhorse — constantly challenging the theories of “workload management.”Then came that nail-biting final day at The Oval. England needed 35 runs. India needed 4 wickets. Pressure was at its peak. All eyes turned to one man — Siraj.When Jamie Overton smacked two early boundaries off Prasidh Krishna, many began to lose hope. But not Siraj. Silently, he took the ball, had a brief chat with captain Shubman Gill, and walked back to his mark.Then came the moment.He knocked over Gus Atkinson’s stumps. Arms spread. A leap. The Siuu celebration (just like Cristiano Ronaldo). Teammates rushing in. It was Siraj’s stage. His win. His story. He didn’t shout. He didn’t boast. He just showed up, over and over again — confident, consistent, committed.And when asked what kept him going, what kept the fire alive, he had just one word: Believe.",Mohammed Siraj was adjudged the Player of the Match at The Oval. Siraj emerged as the highest wicket-taker with 23 scalps. He stamped his authority - his presence - and declared: I can lead this pace attack too.

Poll Should Karun Nair be given another chance in the Indian Test team? Yes, he deserves another chance No, it's time for new talent

‘Vulnerable against the short ball'

CHENNAI: ""Dear cricket, give me one more chance."" Karun Nair's desperate plea struck an immediate chord with those who had seen the hard-working middle-order batter go through the grind of domestic cricket, year after year.The Indian team management, often known to be slightly impatient with a lot of things, also seemed to notice, making an exception for the 33-year-old for the five-Test series in England.The Karnataka cricketer, who will return to his home state next season after excelling for Vidarbha, got four Tests in England, batting at positions 3, 5 and 6. His fighting 57 in the first innings at the Oval, when the ball was doing quite a bit, played a significant role in India getting a respectable score.But in a series which has been dominated by Indian batters, a total of 205 runs at an average of 25.67 aren't exactly the returns that Nair may have been hoping for ahead of the series.But then, Sai Sudharsan, who made his debut in the series and is being seen as a long-term prospect, too got 140 runs in six innings. One feels that the team management has decided to persist with Sai as the long-term No. 3 for now, unless something goes drastically wrong.With Rishabh Pant, Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar excelling with the bat, there's only one spot left in the middle-order when India play West Indies at home in two months' time, and there are contenders for that spot.While Sarfaraz Khan has been with the team for a while and has lost weight to look in fine physical shape, Shreyas Iyer is gunning for a red-ball return. The Mumbai batter, who had a fine IPL, is excellent against spin and it is going to be a tough call for the team management and the selection committee when they sit down to discuss Nair's Test future.Former India opener Deep Dasgupta, who was in England as part of the commentary panel, feels Nair isn't exactly a No. 3 batter for challenging overseas conditions. ""His feet don't move enough to be successful at No. 3. In that case, the options become limited and when it's a choice for Nos. 6 or 7, there are too many options. It's not just Shreyas and Sarfaraz. Even Axar Patel or Nitish Reddy can come into the picture depending on the nature of the pitches India are playing on,"" Dasgupta told TOI from London.Devang Gandhi, a former national selector and an opening batter himself, too feels there is a serious technical deficiency in Karun's game that may go against him. ""At the point of release of the ball from the bowler's hand, Karun's front foot is still in the air. That makes him vulnerable against the short ball, as we found out in this series. There's no doubt he has scored some tough runs, but it has to be taken into account that he couldn't convert the starts that he got,"" Gandhi said.According to him, the selection process sometimes becomes more of a ""case of elimination than selection"", and Nair could find it difficult to retain his spot.In such a scenario, the ball could entirely be in the team management's court. It will be very interesting to see how coach Gautam Gambhir looks at Nair's contributions in the series. The 57 at the Oval was indication enough that in Indian conditions against lesser attacks, Karun will get runs. But the call that Gambhir has to take is whether he has seen enough in Nair's game that will help him get runs in New Zealand next year or the WTC Final in England, if India go that far.""We have a core in place and the team should now be built with an eye on the difficult away series in future,"" Dasgupta said. If that's the case, Nair may well have played his last Test for India.But even if that's true, the half-century at the Oval will never be forgotten by those who have savoured the comeback of this lion-hearted cricketer.","Karun Nair made a famous comeback in England but his middling returns with the bat may go against him.

Marching in the name of legacy: Sikh regiment debate rekindled in Britain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/marching-in-the-name-of-legacy-sikh-regiment-debate-rekindled-in-britain/articleshow/123097673.cms,"Marching in the name of legacy: Sikh regiment debate rekindled in Britain





The debate over whether there should be a Sikh Regiment in the British Armed Forces has resurfaced but the ministry of defence (MOD) insists there are no such plans.The debate was triggered after Lord Sahota asked defence minister Lord Coaker in the House of Lords on 7 July whether there was any progress of having a Sikh regiment in the British Army, given the loyalty of Sikh soldiers in both world wars. Coaker replied, “Let me consider that request from my noble friend. I am quite happy to meet him to see what more we can do to recognise the contribution of soldiers such as Sikhs.” This led to UK headlines such as ‘Minister open to British Army Sikh regiment proposal.’But MOD sources told TOI, “Over the years, there have been conversations about this, but it would breach Britain’s anti-discriminatory laws. There are no current plans for a Sikh regiment as it goes against the Equality Act. We want to do something to recognise Sikh contributions in some way, but not through a Sikh regiment.”Lord Sahota, whose grandfathers served in the British Indian army, including the 15Punjab Regiment, told TOI: “I don’t think it would go against the Equality Act.”He pointed out the British Army has had the Staffordshire regiment and currently has the Brigade of Gurkhas, the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, the Royal Welsh and Royal Regiment of Scotland and so on.“It doesn’t mean other faiths like Hindus, Muslims or Christians wouldn’t be able to serve in a Sikh Regiment. If you are in the Royal Regiment of Scotland, it doesn’t mean you have to be Scottish.”.“We are struggling to recruit ethnic minorities in this country,” he said, and so having a Sikh Regiment would give Sikhs a “reason to join.” “They would wear turbans and have beards and it would reflect Sikh heritage and values,” he said.“It would foster a better relationship with other countries such as India and South Asia as well,” he added.There are estimated to be only 200 Sikhs in the British Armed Forces currently.“People tend to go into the army if their grandfather was in it. Sikhs don’t have that role model here,” Sahota said. He said if there was a Punjab or Sikh Regiment, they would have that role model. “There are more than 700k Sikhs in the UK. I am sure quite a few would be prepared to follow in their great grandfather’s footsteps. King Charles even told a Sikh soldier he wanted to see more Sikhs in the British Army,” the Labour life peer added.India-born Sahota (74) said he plans to meet Lord Coaker after the summer recess and will take Sikhs in the British Army and MPs with him.Preet Kaur Gill MP, who has met the armed forces minister many times, to raise the issue, said: “The ministers are looking at doing something. No decision has been made. It is being looked at. There have been existing Sikh regiments in the army. It’s not anything new.”The modern Indian army has a Sikh Regiment, which continues to recruit from the Sikh community and a Punjab Regiment. The Sikh regiment is one of the most decorated regiments and traces its origins to the first Sikh battalion raised by the East India Company in 1846.But veteran army reservist Captain Jay Singh-Sohal OBE is against the idea.“Even if they did this they wouldn’t fill out a regiment with recruits - we struggle with getting young Sikhs into the military as it is. A Sikh regiment isn’t going to change this and would become massively understaffed. A single battalion regiment requires 700 plus. A Sikh regiment will fail as it won’t get 700 plus young Sikhs joining. And if the answer is to look beyond Sikhs then what’s the point of a race specific regiment?” he said.“These British Sikh politicians need to make the argument for the benefit of Sikh specific regiments in the context of the threats we face today,” Sohal added. “It’s not about harking to past glories but about practical ways in which Sikhs today can make an impact through military service. I believe Sikhs do make an impact as we serve alongside those who represent Great Britain as a whole,” Johal said.“The Sikh identity is already recognised as a strength in the British Army and protected by UK law. We don’t need special treatment. We already practice our faith in the army. A modern army is about bringing capabilities and insights from different walks of life and backgrounds to create a synergy into a whole team setting. Sikhs can contribute a lot to that. Having a Sikh specific regiment won’t motivate more youngsters to join. What would, is if they see value in soldiering or developing themselves as a leader through military experience. I challenge Preet Gill and Lord Sahota to find me 20 Sikhs willing to sign up to the British Army right now, regardless of whether we have a Sikh regiment or not. They won’t be able to do it.”Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi MP, chair of the defence committee, which scrutinises the work of the MOD, said: “Given the extraordinary history, martial traditions and sacrifices of Sikh soldiers, especially during both world wars, I have supported the establishment of a British Sikh Regiment for several years, including meetings with ministers and other activists.""""While the campaign has not achieved success thus far, we will certainly continue to make the case"", Dhesi added."," debate over whether there should be a Sikh Regiment in the British Armed Forces has resurfaced.

Ryan Coogler’s– the best movie to come out so far this year – begins with the line: “There are legends of people born with a gift of making music so true, it can pierce the veil between life and death.” The reference is to the young blues musician Sammie “Preacher Boy” Moore whose music could summon the undead. Ozzy Osbourne too, was born with the gift of making music so true, it could pierce the veil between life and death.Two weeks ago, when Ozzy – perched on a giant black throne like some deranged medieval king – growled, “Let’s go crazy one last f**** time,” before launching into Paranoid, it felt like theatre. Now it feels like prophecy. On July 22, John Michael Osbourne – yes, he had a perfectly ordinary name before the bat-biting and ant-snorting – left this world, but not before reinventing what sound, fury, and darkness could mean.Ozzy’s voice was never operatic, never “clean.” It was a cracked cathedral bell, wailing raw truth. With Black Sabbath, he didn’t just sing; he conjured fear. Tony Iommi’s down-tuned guitar, forged after losing fingertips in a factory accident, rumbled like industrial machinery.Geezer Butler’s bass rolled like thunder, while Bill Ward’s drumming cracked like collapsing steel. Above it all, Ozzy’s haunted wail floated like a ghostly siren, cutting through the darkness.Black Sabbath’s rise was almost accidental. In 1968, Ozzy scribbled an ad that read “Ozzy Zig needs gig.” He found Iommi, Butler, and Ward, four factory boys marinated in Birmingham’s soot and gloom, and together they invented something the world hadn’t heard before: doom.Sabbath’s sound was unlike anything in rock at the time. Iommi’s guitar riffs were thick slabs of distortion, down-tuned to sound like machinery grinding in the dark. Geezer Butler’s bass didn’t just follow the guitar – it roared and throbbed, a counterpoint storm. Bill Ward fused jazz swing with sledgehammer beats, giving their heaviness an eerie groove. And Ozzy’s voice? It wasn’t angelic or operatic – it was a nasal, haunted chant, cutting through the sludge like a prophet warning of the apocalypse. This combination was so raw and otherworldly that it left the flower-power generation stunned and thrilled in equal measure.Their 1970 debut Black Sabbath – with its sinister tritone riff – was practically a séance. Then came Paranoid, an album that blended war paranoia, industrial despair, and existential horror into songs like War Pigs and Iron Man. Sabbath wasn’t peace and love; Sabbath was the sound of living through nightmares and learning to dance with them.The ripple effect was seismic. Without Sabbath, there would be no Metallica’s Master of Puppets, no Slayer’s Reign in Blood, no grunge sound of Alice in Chains or Nirvana’s darker edges. Even bands like Soundgarden, Iron Maiden, and Slipknot have Sabbath’s DNA stitched into their riffs. They didn’t just start a band; they started an entire language of music that countless artists still speak. Even Marvel’s Cinematic Universe might not have landed the same punch if “I Am Iron Man” hadn’t played when Tony Stark announced the arrival of the coolest superhero of them all.By the mid-70s, Sabbath were rock gods. But Ozzy, the self-destructive prince, was spiralling. His love affair with alcohol and drugs turned every tour into a circus of chaos. By 1979, the band fired him – a decision that could have ended his career. Instead, it marked the beginning of his wildest and most successful chapter.Fired, broke, and drowning in substances, Ozzy should have been a rock ‘n’ roll casualty. Instead, he turned into the genre’s greatest survivor – thanks to Sharon Arden (soon to be Sharon Osbourne ), who pulled him from the brink. She managed his career with iron resolve and cunning, building the Ozzy myth as both madman and messiah.The stories from this era read like biblical plagues crossed with drunken comedy sketches. The most infamous is the bat incident. In 1982, during a show in Des Moines, a fan threw a bat on stage. Ozzy, assuming it was rubber, bit its head off. It wasn’t rubber. Blood gushed. He was rushed for rabies shots – and a legend was born.Then there was the Alamo fiasco: a drunk Ozzy urinated on a cenotaph in San Antonio, earning a ten-year city ban. And the Mötley Crüe tour in 1984 – where, in a grotesque contest of dares, Ozzy reportedly snorted a line of ants and licked up a puddle of urine, leaving the band speechless. “Alright, Ozzy, you win,” Tommy Lee later said – a detail immortalized inand repeated by Lee himself, though guitarist Jake E. Lee disputes the “ants” part. Whatever the truth, the story has passed into heavy metal’s folklore.Ozzy didn’t just flirt with chaos; he signed a lifelong contract with it, took it on a drug-fuelled honeymoon, and still managed to write chart-toppers while it set fire to the hotel curtains. It was like Keith Richards , he had some imaginary pact with the devil.In 1980, Blizzard of Ozz exploded into the charts with Crazy Train and Mr. Crowley, proving Ozzy didn’t need Sabbath to remain metal’s high priest. Randy Rhoads, his guitarist, brought a neoclassical brilliance that elevated songs into anthems. Rhoads’ tragic death in a 1982 plane crash could have crushed Ozzy completely. Instead, it hardened him, fuelling Diary of a Madman and Bark at the Moon.By the 1990s, Ozzy’s reputation as the lovable lunatic of metal was solidified. No More Tears gave him another hit parade, with tracks like Mama, I’m Coming Home. His voice – nasal, haunted, indomitable – aged not like wine but like rusted steel: jagged, unyielding, unforgettable.Then came Ozzfest, a metal carnival that gave both legends and newcomers a stage. Ozzy, once the face of controversy, became metal’s benevolent elder. And then came The Osbournes, MTV’s reality show that introduced him as a hilariously foul-mouthed, bumbling family man, swearing at dogs and microwaves. The Prince of Darkness became America’s favourite sitcom dad – albeit one who bit bats.Though Sabbath had fired him in 1979, fate – and fan demand – brought them back together. In 2011, Ozzy reunited with Iommi and Butler for a new album, 13, which topped charts worldwide. Their farewell tour, aptly titled The End, concluded in 2017 in Birmingham, closing the circle where it all began.But Villa Park, July 5, 2025, was the true epilogue. The 76-year-old Ozzy, slowed by Parkinson’s, returned home for one last show titled Back to the Beginning. Seated on a towering black throne adorned with a giant bat, he performed with Sabbath in full force. When he growled “Let’s go crazy one last f**** time,” the 45,000 fans roared as if summoning every demon and angel he’d ever sung about. His voice – cracked, frail, but still otherworldly – soared over the crowd like it did in 1970.It was also fitting that the farewell happened in Villa Park – the same ground celebrated by Ozzy just last year when Aston Villa launched their new kit with a promotional video featuring him and Geezer Butler, soundtracked by Paranoid. For the working-class hero from Aston, football and metal were cut from the same cloth: raw, tribal, and electric.Many years ago, a man from Liverpool – murdered by a fanatic for not living according to the ethos of a popular song – wrote Working Class Hero, mocking society for crushing individuality. Ozzy, the son of Aston’s factories, embodied that rebellion. He never conformed – not to society, not to rock clichés, not to life or death. He lived on his terms, and he left on his terms, gifting us one last sermon of riffs and wails.Ozzy is gone, but the echo of his howl – that haunted, unrepentant scream – still vibrates through every heavy riff played today. Better clear some room, Lucifer, because hell is about to get a new frontman. The Prince of Darkness is coming home.","Ozzy’s voice was never operatic, never “clean” It was a cracked cathedral bell, wailing raw truth. With Black Sabbath, he didn’t just sing; he conjured fear.

How Elon Musk reacted to the Cybertruck window cracking incident

iOS 26 Public Beta Is Here: Apple’s Biggest Redesign Since iOS 7

Tesla chief designer Franz von Holzhausen recently discussed an infamous incident from 2019 when the Cybertruck’s window shattered during its launch. Standing next to CEO Elon Musk, von Holzhausen threw a metal ball at the vehicle’s window to showcase its durability and strength. However, the vehicle’s window cracked, creating an awkward situation then. In a recent interview with Tesla Club Austria, Franz von Holzhausen called the incident a “Murphy’s law” moment, where anything that can go wrong. He said he has done test run on the armoured glass window “multiple times right before we went live on the stage”.“I think it was just one of those Murphy's law kind of things where something bad happens. But it turned out to be a great meme,” von Holzhausen said.He added that despite the blunder, the incident became a “great meme” and “turned into a great marketing moment” for Tesla. Interestingly, the EV maker launched a $45 T-shirt featuring a shattered window design shortly after the incident, turning the accident into a merchandise opportunity.Franz von Holzhausen said “The ball didn't go through the window, so you know, you're still safe. It was not an expected moment, but in that moment, you have to roll with it.”The Tesla CEO then laughed off the incident, saying there was ""room for improvement."" He also shared a video of the incident on X with caption “Franz throws steel ball at Cybertruck window right before launch. Guess we have some improvements to make before production haha.”In another explanation to the cracking incident, he wrote: “Sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didn’t bounce off. Should have done steel ball on window, *then* sledgehammer the door. Next time …”","Franz von Holzhausen threw a metal ball at the Cybertruck's window to showcase its durability and strength.

Ben Stokes press conference: On Mohammed Siraj, Chris Woakes batting with injury, 2-2 result

Poll What was your reaction to Chris Woakes walking out to bat injured? Inspired Concerned Impressed

NEW DELHI: In a finale befitting a blockbuster series, England all-rounder Chris Woakes delivered one of the most courageous moments of the summer — walking out to bat with a dislocated shoulder during a tense chase against India in the fifth and final Test at The Oval.With England needing 17 runs and just one wicket remaining, Woakes, officially ruled out of the match on Day 1 due to injury, strode to the crease to a standing ovation. His left arm was strapped tightly in a sling under his sweater. Despite the intense pain — and even more intense pressure — Woakes was ready to face the fury of India’s fast bowlers.“The first one was the worst,” Woakes told The Guardian. “All I had taken was codeine and it was just so sore. Instinct took over – even with my arm strapped down I tried to run as you naturally do. I genuinely worried my shoulder had popped back out again, hence you saw me throw my helmet off, rip the glove off with my teeth, and check it was OK.”He did not face a single delivery. But just being there mattered. “It was bittersweet in the end. Part of me wondered what it might be like… to see if I could have defended the ball, seen out an over maybe, squeezed a run or carved a four,” he said.“But the other side of it was: ‘Thank God I didn’t face a 90mph bouncer, one-handed, facing the wrong way around.’”Woakes added 10 valuable runs with Gus Atkinson before Mohammed Siraj ended England’s hopes with a sizzling yorker to dismiss the latter.Despite the heartbreak, Woakes never considered staying back. “I’m still gutted, devastated really, that we couldn’t get the fairytale. But I never considered not going out there, even if it had been 100 runs still to win.”India clinched the Test by six runs, squaring the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy 2-2. Woakes didn’t face a ball — but earned the respect of fans and players on both sides.","England all-rounder Chris Woakes walked out to bat with a dislocated shoulder.

Poll How would you rate Jasprit Bumrah's performance in the recent series against England? Outstanding Good Average Below Expectations

NEW DELHI: India’s hard-fought 2-2 series draw against England in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy produced numerous standout performances, but not everyone lived up to the billing. Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan expressed disappointment in Jasprit Bumrah ’s performance, despite the pacer finishing as one of the top wicket-takers in the series.Bumrah featured in only three of the five Tests due to workload management. While he returned with 14 wickets at an average of 26.00 — including two five-wicket hauls — Pathan felt Bumrah lacked the killer instinct in crucial moments.“Bumrah will get six out of ten,” Pathan said on his YouTube channel. “When you're a senior player, there is a lot of responsibility to win matches. He played three Tests, and India didn’t win any of them.”Citing specific examples, Pathan pointed to the series opener where Bumrah took five wickets in the first innings but failed to pick up a single in the second while defending a sizeable total of 370.“At that crucial time, your main match-winner has to find a way — over the wicket, around the wicket, yorkers, slower balls, bouncers — anything to create pressure.That didn't happen. In the Leeds Test, we did not see that pressure being built. England ended up scoring heavily, and Bumrah did not take a single wicket,” he added.The former pacer also noted Bumrah’s reluctance to stretch spells when India needed breakthroughs. “There were moments, like when a sixth over was needed. Joe Root had been dismissed by him 11 times, and in that Lord's Test, Bumrah bowled just five overs. That one more over could’ve pushed harder. I felt he held back.”While acknowledging Bumrah’s name going up on the Lord’s honours board, Pathan stressed that the world’s top-ranked Test bowler is held to a higher standard.“He took a five-wicket haul and got his name on the Lord's honours board. But when you are the number one bowler, there is an expectation of number one-level performance, and I felt he did not quite live up to that.”",Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan expressed disappointment in Jasprit Bumrah ’s performance.

Poll Do you agree with Ben Stokes' stance on injury substitutions in Test cricket? Yes, I fully support it. No, I think substitutions should be allowed. Not sure, need more information.

England seamer Chris Woakes , currently nursing a shoulder injury, has backed his captain Ben Stokes ' stance in the ongoing debate over ""injury substitutions"" in Test cricket.India wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant had retired hurt on the first day of the drawn fourth Test in Manchester but returned to bat the next day, despite scans confirming a fracture in his right foot.India head coach Gautam Gambhir subsequently advocated for the introduction of injury replacements in Tests—a suggestion Stokes had dismissed as “absolutely ridiculous.”Interestingly, in the fifth Test at The Oval, England found themselves in a similar situation when Woakes suffered a fractured shoulder. Despite the injury, he came out to bat on the final day with England nine wickets down and needing fewer than 20 runs to win.“I’m with Stokesy, to be honest,” Woakes told The Guardian.“Having played for 18 years, the game is what it is—you lose a player, and as a team, you have to find a way. It makes you more resilient and the team stronger.""“I understand why people might feel it’s necessary in cases of freak injuries like mine, but there would be too many grey areas and loopholes.”Woakes’ gritty decision to bat despite his injury has earned him widespread respect.“I mean, it’s not the way you want to make the front page—you’d rather it be for five wickets or a century. There have been a lot of ups and downs since, but yeah, the love from the public has helped,” he said.“It’s so strange to go from starting a Test week thinking, ‘One last push,’ to ending up on a physio’s table wondering what the future holds.”","England seamer Chris Woakes has backed his captain Ben Stokes'stance in the ongoing debate over ""injury substitutions"" in Test cricket.

WATCH the wild visitor here:

In one of the rarest interruptions seen in cricket, a fox stole the spotlight during the season opener of The Hundred 2025, halting play momentarily and delighting a packed Lord’s Cricket Ground in London.The bizarre moment occurred during the high-octane clash between London Spirit and defending champions Oval Invincibles, when the game was suddenly interrupted — not by rain or an injury — but by a small, swift fox darting across the field.The fox appeared just as London Spirit pacer Daniel Worrall was about to deliver a ball. With the Invincibles needing 72 runs more to win, the animal sprinted across the playing surface, seemingly unaware of the chaos it caused. The sight of the furry intruder triggered loud cheers and laughter from the Lord’s crowd, and even the usually composed commentators Stuart Broad and Eoin Morgan couldn’t contain their amusement as the cameras followed the fox’s every move.Sky Sports Cricket captured the moment, sharing the clip online — where it quickly went viral.The fox eventually scampered across the boundary rope, bringing an end to the surprise interlude.Play resumed minutes later, but not before the moment etched itself as one of the quirkiest starts to a cricket season.On the cricketing front, the Oval Invincibles cruised to a six-wicket win, chasing down London Spirit’s modest total of 80 in just 69 balls. Rashid Khan and Sam Curran were the standout performers with the ball, both claiming three wickets each to dismantle a Spirit lineup that featured stars like David Warner, Kane Williamson, and Ashton Turner.Rashid, who took 3 for 11 and was named Player of the Match, said after the game: “It was nice to get off to a winning start… I haven’t bowled in the last couple of months but the amount of cricket I have played in the last ten years, that really helps.”While the Invincibles made a dominant start to their title defense, it was the fox at Lord’s that truly captured hearts.","A fox interrupted a cricket match between London Spirit and the Oval Invincibles at Lord’s.

India need EIGHT wickets, England 324 runs: Who will come out on top at The Oval?

NEW DELHI: Congress MP and renowned public figure Shashi Tharoor has once again sparked debate around Virat Kohli’s retirement from Test cricket, calling it “premature” and urging the Indian stalwart to return to the longest format. Tharoor’s latest remarks came after India’s spirited 2-2 series draw in England, under new skipper Shubman Gill , who led a young side admirably in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.Despite India fighting back from a 1-2 deficit with a draw in Manchester and a nail-biting win at The Oval, Tharoor couldn’t help but reflect on what might have been with Kohli in the lineup.“I was just admiring Joe @root66’s consistent excellence as England’s hardy perennial at age 35, while @imVkohli, just two years older, languishes in premature retirement,” Tharoor posted on social media, in reply to a debate on Kohli’s potential return.Earlier during the fifth Test, Tharoor had already voiced his emotions, posting: “I’ve been missing @imVkohli a few times during this series, but never as much as in this Test match.

Poll Who do you think had a bigger impact on India's performance in the Test series against England? Jasprit Bumrah Mohammed Siraj Both had an equal impact

Former Australia cricketer Brad Haddin has made a bold remark about India’s pace duo Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj Haddin said that Bumrah didn’t win any Test matches for India during the England tour.“India can take a lot out of this — that they can still play without Bumrah,” Haddin said on the YouTube channel LiSTNR Sport.“Life goes on if the other bowlers find a way. They have so much talent over there in India. But he didn’t win a Test match.“I think Siraj likes being the leader of the attack. He’s one of those guys who wants the ball in big situations.Yes, he makes mistakes, but he doesn’t shy away from the occasion. If you have players like that — who aren’t afraid to make mistakes, who can get under the skin of the opposition because of how much they want to be involved — those are the guys you want.”Jasprit Bumrah was released from India’s squad after not being included in the playing XI for the fifth Test against England at The Oval, owing to workload management.Before the five-match series began, chief selector Ajit Agarkar and head coach Gautam Gambhir had stated that Bumrah wouldn’t feature in more than three Tests on the tour due to workload considerations. Bumrah played in the first Test at Headingley, Leeds, followed by the third and fourth games at Lord’s and Old Trafford, Manchester, respectively.In those three games, Bumrah picked up 14 wickets — including two five-wicket hauls — bowling 119.4 overs at an average of 26, making him India’s leading wicket-taker before the fifth Test.Meanwhile, Siraj featured in all five Tests, ending as the highest wicket-taker in the series with 22 scalps, helping India level the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy 2-2.“Mohammed Siraj wanted the ball in that last hour of play. There’s no way in the world he didn’t want to bowl every over to win the game. Yes, he dropped a catch — that was a bad miss. Your details have to be better when you’re catching in those moments.“But that one moment didn’t define his performance in the Test match. We’re not even talking about that catch anymore,” Haddin added.",Former Australia cricketer Brad Haddin has made a bold remark about India’s pace duo Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj.

ODI leadership

shakeup

Once all the media formalities were completed, the Indian team whizzed out of the Oval fast on Monday afternoon. They reached the team hotel and had a short customary celebration before dispersing. If one went out for a stroll in the evening on the stretch from Oxford Street to Piccadilly Circus, one could have casually bumped into a few members of the Indian team.Prasidh Krishna was there with his family. Kuldeep Yadav hopped stores with former India leg-spinner Piyush Chawla. Arshdeep Singh too had his family with him. Head coach Gautam Gambhir checked out of the team hotel by evening. Captain Shubman Gill had his friends and family over to celebrate a memorable tour that has placed him at the centre of Indian cricket ’s power centre. The coach-captain duo has come out of their first assignment with flying colours, having drawn the five-Test series, including the dramatic six-run win in the fifth Test on Monday.Bigger milestones now beckon. Before this tour, there had been discussions around the future of the coach-captain combination. Having settled all the doubts, now it’s time for the two to set concrete plans for the future.Gill landed in England with an Indian team in the first week of June with questions being raised about his inexperience.Now he deserves to go off the constant high-performance routine of an India cricketer for a few days.Meanwhile, Gambhir’s tenure as India’s head coach has revolved around his strong people-over-individuals philosophy. He is also a coach who came into the Indian dressing room to wipe out the superstar culture.Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Ravichandran Ashwin retired from Test cricket before the selectors could get down to planning for the English summer. Jasprit Bumrah, the biggest name after Kohli and Rohit, declared he was available for only three of the five Tests.India boarded the flight from Mumbai to London after a disastrous first six months in Test cricket under Gambhir. The ICC Champions Trophy triumph in March aside, Gambhir knew he had to deliver. Not that there was any immediate threat to his position, but a drubbing with a fresh team here would have been detrimental to his reputation. The first thing he did was to instill enough conviction in Gill and the team.“Before the start of the series, Gauti bhai (Gambhir) said that we are a young team, but we don’t want to be looked at as a young team. We want to be looked at as a gun team’. The way we played today showed why we are a gun team,” Gill said. This has also been Gambhir’s line of thinking. After India pulled off a draw in the fourth Test in Manchester, having trailed almost throughout the match, a typically combative Gambhir decided to front up to the media. “I don’t like to call this a team in transition. I will say they are inexperienced,” he had said.There is this unmistakable aversion to the word ‘transition’. “Even if there was no transition or if we had the old players, everything would have looked good if batters and bowlers performed,” Gill said. Then he went on to highlight his batting lineup’s stellar performance in the series.“Almost every batter in the series has performed. They have scored hundreds. They have scored runs in crucial and crunch situations,” he mentioned, offering enough hints that this team management had moved on long before the world could.Gill’s confidence in his batting lineup is backed up by numbers. Gill himself scored 754 runs while KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja finished with more than 500 runs. Rishabh Pant scored 479 runs in the seven innings he batted before suffering a broken foot. Yashasvi Jaiswal finished with 412 runs.On the topic of transition or inexperience, Gill has been bullish about the potential of his team. He believed the scoreline before the fifth Test wasn’t a true reflection of the cricket India have played. He maintained that even after the win on Monday. For him, even if India had lost the last Test, the scoreline wouldn’t have been a fair one.The plans will be taking shape soon. There is a certain assertion in Gill’s speech now which suggests he is a man who is firmly in charge. He is already looking ahead.That India managed to win two Tests on the tour without Bumrah playing must have settled a lot of nerves. TOI understands that Bumrah will either play an entire Test series or sit out of it in future. So, it could come down to picking either the two-Test series against West Indies at home in Oct before South Africa come in Dec for another two Tests. India don’t have another five-Test series in two years. With the team expected to play on spin-friendly pitches in India, there won’t be much load on the pacers. The selectors and Bumrah can comfortably plan his availability for white-ball tournaments like the T20 World Cup at home in Feb-March next year.With Gill and Gambhir striking a cord, there could be a temptation to revisit the ODI leadership group going forward. Gill is already the designated vice-captain in the ODI format. His consistency with the bat makes him indispensable.With incumbent Rohit Sharma not being a certainty for the 2027 ODI World Cup in South Africa, there are murmurs in the board that if a new captain had to take charge, he should get a fair time to shape the ODI team according to his philosophies. India don’t play much ODI cricket in the build-up to the 2027 World Cup.",India captain Shubman Gill had his friends and family over to celebrate a memorable tour that has placed him at the centre of Indian cricket ’s power centre.

India vs England Day 5: Can India do the UNTHINKABLE at The Oval? Four wickets and 2-2!

Poll Do you agree with Dinesh Karthik's critique of the Indian cricket team's management? Yes, I fully agree. No, I disagree.

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Dinesh Karthik has delivered a pointed critique of the team management under head coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Shubman Gill , saying the duo took an overly defensive approach during the recently concluded Test series in England, which ended in a 2-2 draw.While India’s young side showed commendable fight to bounce back after trailing 1-2, Karthik suggested the team’s composition reflected a fear of losing rather than a hunger to win.“You could almost argue they picked a team not to lose,” Karthik said on Cricbuzz. “He [Gambhir] is now getting his way, so he will be responsible for everything that happens in the Indian team. If it does well, credit to him. If it doesn’t do well, he should put his hands up and say, ‘we made a mistake’.”Karthik stopped short of blaming captain Shubman Gill, indicating that Gambhir appears to be the primary force behind team decisions.“He [Gambhir] has taken control of the team I feel. He is the driving force of this team with Shubman,” he remarked. “The one thing that I feel he can do is almost look at being serious about picking 20 wickets as much as he feels depth in batting is important.”He added that while Gambhir has a strong track record in white-ball formats, he is still finding his feet in the red-ball arena.“He’s a terrific white-ball coach and the results have been there for us to see. But, in Test cricket, he is also learning on the job.”Under Gambhir's tenure so far, India have suffered a 0-3 whitewash at home to New Zealand — the first in their Test history — and a 1-3 loss in the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia. They also failed to reach the World Test Championship final for the first time.Karthik also weighed in on Jasprit Bumrah ’s workload management and dismissed narratives suggesting India win more without him.“You have to look at it from Jasprit Bumrah’s point of view. I think, these kind of wins, the way the series has panned out, the way the young team has fought, it will actually help him in his career. I believe Jasprit Bumrah will be very proud of this young bowling attack,” he said.“The stat of India winning when he doesn’t play is not his mistake. He is so impactful that others pale in comparison. I hope he will have a longer career, knowing he can pick and choose matches. Two back injuries, one nasty ACL that he had — it’s not easy.”","Former India cricketer Dinesh Karthik has delivered a pointed critique of the team management under head coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Shubman Gill.
