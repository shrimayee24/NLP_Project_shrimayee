The Kansas City Chiefs have Travis Kelce back for the 2025-26 season, but his days as the team's top tight end might be numbered.Kelce returns to the Chiefs at age 35, clearly past his prime years. He's a franchise legend, racking up 12,151 receiving yards over 174 regular season games. But his numbers have steadily declined since 2022, the last season he crossed 1,000 receiving yards.Last season, Kelce caught 97 passes on 133 targets, but managed just three touchdowns—his career-low. It's reassuring to see Kelce on the field again, but the Chiefs should strongly consider increasing Noah Gray 's snaps.Noah Gray, drafted in the fifth round by the Chiefs in 2021, keeps improving. Last season was Gray's best yet, posting career-highs with 437 receiving yards and five touchdowns from 40 catches on 49 targets.At age 26, Gray is entering his prime years. Keeping him limited behind a declining Kelce could be a serious mistake. Kansas City recognized Gray’s potential with a contract extension, clearly seeing his value beyond a typical fifth-round pick.Pro Football Focus graded Gray at 74.2 last season, placing him eighth among all tight ends. Kelce's grade was 70.9, ranking him 15th. Gray objectively outperformed Kelce, suggesting it's time for Kansas City to prioritize youth over legacy.Taylor Swift dominated the recent iHeartRadio Music Awards , earning nine awards, including Artist of the Year, Pop Artist of the Year, and a special honor for her global ""Eras Tour,"" plus six fan-voted categories.Though Swift missed the event at the Dolby Theater in LA, she sent a recorded acceptance speech. Fans speculated her boyfriend, Chiefs star Travis Kelce, filmed the video, citing what appeared to be his reflection in Swift's trophy.While that theory remains uncertain, Donna Kelce, Travis' mother, made her support clear. Mama Kelce proudly posted Swift’s awards haul on Instagram, gathering over 85,000 likes and enthusiastic reactions from fans.a fan another.Donna Kelce has formed a close bond with Swift since she started dating Travis in the summer of 2023, often sitting together at Chiefs games at Arrowhead Stadium. Mama Kelce also openly supports her other daughter-in-law, Kylie Kelce—wife of former NFL player Jason Kelce—recently comforting the couple following the loss of their dog.Swifties have always looked out for Taylor, especially when it comes to her relationships.

I knew once free agency started that I wanted to work something out [with the Ravens] if we could,

Even though I’m living in Dallas and Dallas being a perfect situation, as well, because we lived there, we ain’t got to move…”

“They ain’t holla at me at all,”

Dallas could have been a perfect fit, but now Henry is locked in with the Ravens

Baltimore Ravens ’ star running back Derrick Henry has officially sold his Dallas home, but it’s not just a routine real estate transaction—it’s a symbolic farewell to a long-standing dream. Henry, who was once rumored to be eyeing a future with the Dallas Cowboys , sold the property for $1.6 million, falling short of its original asking price. This move marks the final chapter in his connection to Dallas, a city he once hoped to call his permanent NFL home.Henry originally bought the luxurious 4,154-square-foot home in Inwood Park in 2022. Featuring 20-foot ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows, marble floors, and hardwood flooring, the property was a high-end investment. The stunning residence offers four bedrooms, four bathrooms, and a spacious three-car garage. Designed for both comfort and style, it boasts a gourmet kitchen, a cozy fireplace, custom walk-in closets, and a lush turf backyard perfect for outdoor relaxation.He first listed it for $1.8 million in 2023 but later took it off the market before relisting it at $1.6 million with a different real estate agency.According to TMZ, the final sale amount has not been disclosed, but sources suggest it was close to the lowered asking price. The sale ends Henry’s residential ties to Dallas, a city he had considered home due to his girlfriend, Adrianna Rivas , having family in the area.While Henry’s Dallas residency was partly personal, it was also fueled by his football aspirations. The running back admitted onpodcast that he had wanted to play for the Cowboys.” Henry said. “Unfortunately for Henry, the Cowboys never approached him.he revealed, making it clear that the interest was one-sided.Many Cowboys fans were thrilled by the idea of Derrick Henry joining the team and teaming up with Dak Prescott. With his powerful running style and Dallas’ solid offensive line, Henry could have brought a whole new level of strength to the offense. His ability to break tackles and wear down defenses seemed like the perfect fit for a team looking to boost its rushing attack. But despite all the excitement and speculation, the Cowboys stuck to their usual cautious approach to building the roster. Instead of making a big move for Henry, they decided to stay the course—meaning the star running back never got the call.Now, he’s set to be a major weapon for the Ravens, forming a lethal ground with his peers. While Cowboys fans may be left wondering what could have been, Ravens fans have every reason to celebrate.

Bruins fans struggle to accept Brad Marchand’s debut for the Panthers

Brad Marchand’s highly anticipated debut for the Florida Panthers has ignited a wave of anger and disappointment among Boston Bruins fans . The NHL veteran, who was unexpectedly traded at the deadline, is set to return to the ice after recovering from an upper-body injury. As Panthers coach Paul Maurice confirmed, ""We are shooting for Friday against Utah right now,"" signaling Marchand’s imminent return. While this marks a fresh start for the seasoned winger, Bruins fans aren’t taking it lightly.Brad Marchand, a key figure in the Bruins’ 2011 Stanley Cup victory, had a rough season before the trade. His exit was a shock, and seeing him suit up for the Panthers so soon has left Boston fans frustrated.

Ryan Whitney questions the timing of PM Mark Carney’s appearance



Connor McDavid welcomes PM Mark Carney's support



Polarized opinions about political personalities in sports



Former NHL defenseman Ryan Whitney had no qualms expressing his outrage about Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney attending the Edmonton Oilers ' pre-game skate. Whitney, a straight-talker, was taken aback at seeing a politician taking to the ice before an important game and wondered at the wisdom behind it and its effects on the preparation of the players.Showing disbelief at the timing of the visit, Ryan Whitney contended that pre-game skates are essential for the players to get their minds together and prepare. The ex-Edmonton Oilers blueliner noted that politicians should not attend during such times, especially when they are not skilled on ice skates.“This Carney guy, Mark Carney is his name. This guy is out there in a pregame skate… I don't care which way he leans politically. It could be the right-wing guy or the left-wing guy. You don't have a politician on the ice during the pregame skate , not to mention a politician who can't skate,” Whitney ranted. “Don't bring politicians on the ice, let alone on a practice day. We're talking pregame skate. Do you think Ryan Nugent-Hopkins wants some politician standing next to him before a game? You have your preparations.”Whitney's comments quickly resonated with hockey fans , with some thinking that politicians shouldn't interrupt game-day rituals, while others didn't see anything wrong with the visit.Even though Whitney panned the visit, Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid had another take. The superstar forward welcomed Mark Carney's visit, saying it was great to have a lifelong Oilers fan present around the team.“Obviously, it’s nice to have him here. He's an Oilers fan, a lifelong Oilers fan. Oilers fans are welcome here, for sure. I don't know if his security detail would appreciate that too much. But, of course, it's a special thing to bring him here. It was great to meet him,” McDavid said.Mark Carney's ice appearance has ignited controversy, with some regarding it as a friendly gesture and others, such as Ryan Whitney, thinking that it breaks up the team's routine. Support from celebrity figures is welcome to fans, but whether it should only be in the form of off-ice engagement is questionable.Also read: “Nice to have him here”: Connor McDavid on Canada PM Mark Carney's appearance at Oilers morning skate While the Edmonton Oilers' season goes on, the players and their game will continue to be the priority, but the words of Whitney have made sure that Mark Carney's visit will not soon be forgotten.","Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney attended the Edmonton Oilers'pre-game skate.

The Cavaliers ’ injury report includes Evan Mobley (rest), Jaylon Tyson (knee), and Ty Jerome (knee), all listed as day-to-day.

Cunningham’s absence is a significant blow—the Pistons’ leading scorer (23.8 PPG last 20 games) has been instrumental in their playoff push. Malik Beasley (16.2 PPG) and Jalen Duren (10.2 RPG) will shoulder more offensive responsibility.The game tips off at 7 p.m. ET at Little Caesars Arena, airing on FDSDET and FDSOH.

Jayson Tatum reacted to his nickname ‘The Anomaly’ while speaking with Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce



Where did Jayson Tatum’s nickname come from?



Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum ’s reaction to a particular nickname has sparked plenty of discussion among fans and media alike. Tatum, who has been a star player for the Celtics, recently addressed the growing trend of people calling him ‘ The Anomaly ’ during his chat with NFL star siblings Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce in a new episode a their New Heights podcast .During a guest appearance on the New Heights podcast hosted by NFL stars Travis and Jason Kelce, Jayson Tatum was asked about the nickname that has been making rounds on social media.

He responded with a candid answer that sent the Kelce brothers into fits of laughter. “Twitter is not a real place, I’ll say that,” Tatum hared. His reaction made it clear that he wasn’t exactly embracing the nickname, despite its growing popularity.Jason Kelce, however, had a different take. “I would run with that one. I like it. ‘The Anomaly’ is a good one. I don’t know who came up with that.” To which Travis Kelce agreed, saying, “It is a banger.”The origins of ‘The Anomaly’ trace back to social media, where an X user first suggested it, pointing out Tatum’s unique skill set. “Handles like someone 6 inches shorter, shoots pull-ups like a guard, finishes at the rim like a center, and consistently defends 1-5.”The nickname got wide attention, and soon, even official team accounts like the Portland Trail Blazers started using it in their game promotions. Basketball Reference has even added it to Tatum’s list of nicknames.Previously, when asked directly if he liked the name, he hesitated before admitting, “Ahhh, I don’t know.” He went on to mention that friends and teammates call him by other names, such as ‘Big Deuce’ and ‘Taco.’Also Read: Jayson Tatum's injury report (March 26, 2025): Is the Boston Celtics star fit to play against the Phoenix Suns tonight?

Why did Hulk Hogan and Linda Hogan divorce? The shocking truth behind their controversial marriage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/why-did-hulk-hogan-and-linda-hogan-divorce-the-shocking-truth-behind-their-controversial-marriage/articleshow/119669028.cms,"Image Via Getty

Hulk Hogan allegedly cheated on Linda Hogan with Brooke Hogan’s close friend, Christiane Plante — and that blew it all up

National Enquirer

“My relationship with Terry began at a time when Terry and Linda privately knew their marriage was ending. She had left him already, although no official papers had been filed.”

“Having felt the guilt and pain build up, I gave a note to Brooke apologizing for my actions. I will never be able to fully forgive myself for this. I have lost an amazing friend.”

E! News

“When Linda discovered Hulk had [an affair] with Brooke's best friend, Christiane Plante, she made the decision to call it quits on the marriage.”

“When your best friend and one of your closest family members that you have loved unconditionally since your first day on this earth, betray you together… you will NEVER forget the hurt they caused you.”

Linda Hogan says Hulk Hogan was violent, manipulative, and made her fear for her life during their marriage

""[Hulk] tore my shirt. He threw lamps. He held me down on the bed with his hands around my throat during arguments, slamming doors, [and] pounding walls. I was always afraid he would kill me in one of his rages.""

Inside Edition

“My kids to this day are still reeling, and they can't get their feet back on planet Earth. I can't get my life back on track either... I don't know where I fit in in this world anymore.”

The Hogan family was already falling apart during Hogan Knows Best — and the show only made it worse

Keeping Up With The Kardashians

83 Weeks

“The ‘Hogan Knows Best’ show probably exasperated an already existing problem... it certainly exacerbated it, probably fueled it, probably expedited the end of their relationship.”

Divorce didn’t fix anything. It just started a new kind of hell for the Hogan family

“Holy smokes. Wow, you just knocked the bottom out of me.”

“For my own journey to healing and happiness, I have chosen to create some distance between myself and my family.”

“Brooke doesn’t talk to us. She had twins, she got married [and] she didn’t tell us.”

“It’s been 15 however long years since I left Hulk Hogan and my family is the worst mess…”

It wasn’t just a celebrity divorce. It was a full-blown public implosion — with affairs, physical abuse claims, secret lawsuits, millions at stake, and kids stuck in the middle. Hulk Hogan (real name: Terry Bollea ) and Linda Hogan were married for 24 years. But the moment it ended, it dragged the entire Hogan brand down with it. And even now, nearly two decades later, it’s still messy.This wasn’t about two people growing apart. It was about betrayal. Control. Damage. And the fallout that never stopped.Linda Hogan says the final straw came when she found out Hulk Hogan had been sleeping with Christiane Plante — a friend of their daughter, Brooke Hogan.This wasn’t a rumor. Plante herself admitted it in a 2008 interview with theAnd she knew what it cost her.Linda Hogan’s publicist backed it all up in, saying:Hulk Hogan denied the affair in his memoir. Denied all infidelity, in fact. Said Linda Hogan just got suspicious whenever he spoke to a woman. But by the time this went public, the damage was already done — to their family, to Brooke Hogan, to their entire reputation.And yes, Brooke Hogan was shattered. She posted this on MySpace — and then deleted it:Linda Hogan didn't stop at cheating accusations. She later said Hulk Hogan was emotionally abusive — and physically terrifying behind closed doors.In her memoir, she claimed:She went on, saying she couldn’t rebuild her life even after the divorce:She blamed Hulk Hogan for destroying the future they planned — the holidays, the weddings, even their relationships with their kids. Linda said she lost her trust, her love, her home. And that the trauma didn’t just fade after the cameras were gone.On the surface, “Hogan Knows Best” made the Hogan family look tight.

Linda walked away with 70% of their liquid assets, 40% ownership of Hulk Hogan’s companies, and a $3 million property settlement.But the fighting didn’t end.

IPL 2025: How will KKR, MI, CSK, SRH, RCB fare this season?

After being outclassed in their previous matches, title holders Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals are looking for a quick turnaround when they meet in an IPL match today (March 26).The Knight Riders lost to Royal Challengers Bengaluru by seven wickets in their opener, while the Royals suffered a 44-run defeat against Sunrisers Hyderabad.Both teams share a common issue: their once-impressive batting and bowling units have failed to perform. While the Royals might attribute their bowling struggles to playing at a difficult Hyderabad venue, the Knight Riders lack such an excuse.Except for Sunil Narine, none of the KKR bowlers managed to restrain the aggressive RCB lineup, raising concerns about the effectiveness of mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy, who struggled significantly. Even on Eden Gardens' pitch, which had some grip, Chakravarthy was hit hard by Phil Salt and Virat Kohli.The KKR camp is hopeful that Chakravarthy will regain his form on a Guwahati pitch that typically offers more assistance to bowlers.The Barsapara Cricket Stadium in Guwahati has hosted four matches in IPL history - two in 2023 and two in 2024. The highest total at this ground came courtesy Rajasthan Royals who scored 199 against Delhi Capitals. The RR vs KKR fixture was washed out last year at this venue.Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson, Riyan Parag(c), Nitish Rana, Dhruv Jurel(wk), Shimron Hetmyer, Shubham Dubey, Jofra Archer, Wanindu Hasaranga, Maheesh Theekshana, Tushar Deshpande, Sandeep Sharma, Akash Madhwal.Yudhvir Charak/Kunal Singh Rathore.Quinton de Kock (w), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Venkatesh Iyer, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Ramandeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Spencer Johnson, Varun Chakaravarthy.Vaibhav Arora/Manish Pandey.Sanju Samson (c), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel, Jofra Archer, Shimron Hetmyer, Tushar Deshpande, Wanindu Hasaranga, Maheesh Theekshana, Nitish Rana, Sandeep Sharma, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Kwena Maphaka, Akash Madhwal, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Shubham Dubey, Yudhvir Singh, Kunal Singh Rathore, Ashok Sharma, Kumar KartikeyaRinku Singh, Varun Chakaravarthy, Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Harshit Rana, Ramandeep Singh, Venkatesh Iyer, Quinton de Kock, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Anrich Nortje, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Vaibhav Arora, Mayank Markande, Rovman Powell, Manish Pandey, Spencer Johnson, Luvnith Sisodia, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Anukul Roy, Moeen Ali, Chetan SakariyaAs the RR vs KKR head-to-head record reads, the two teams have played each other 30 times in the IPL, with the Royals and the Knight Riders winning 14 each.

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) ended a 17-year winless streak at Chepauk with a dominant 50-run victory over Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in Friday's IPL match. RCB posted a competitive 196/7, with Rajat Patidar leading the charge with a fortuitous 51 runs off 32 balls, supported by Tim David’s late blitz (22* off 8 balls).Despite early fireworks from Phil Salt (32 off 16 balls) and Devdutt Padikkal (27 off 14 balls), RCB struggled in the middle overs, but Patidar’s knock and David’s late hitting propelled them to a solid total.CSK’s chase never gained momentum as they crumbled to 146/8, with key wickets falling early. Josh Hazlewood was the standout performer with the ball, claiming 3/21, including the vital scalps of Rahul Tripathi and Ruturaj Gaikwad, reducing CSK to 8/3 within the first two overs.Bhuvneshwar Kumar (1/20) also contributed, dismissing Deepak Hooda.Though Rachin Ravindra (41 off 31 balls) and Sam Curran (8) tried to stabilize, the required run rate surged, and wickets fell at regular intervals. Curran was dismissed by Liam Livingstone, and Ravindra was bowled out by Yash Dayal (2/18), who also removed Shivam Dube (19).CSK’s decision to send Ravichandran Ashwin instead of MS Dhoni at this stage signaled their lack of fight. Dhoni’s 30* off 16 balls, including 2 sixes, was a mere consolation.RCB’s bowlers, including Livingstone and Dayal, tightened the screws, and an outstanding performance from Impact Sub Suyash Sharma (4-0-32-0) kept CSK under control.Patidar’s fortunate fifty and Hazlewood's destructive spell were key to RCB’s historic win, marking a rare defeat for CSK at home and a memorable victory for RCB.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) ended a 17-year winless streak at Chepauk with a dominant 50-run victory over Chennai Super Kings (CSK) RCB posted a competitive 196/7, with Rajat Patidar leading the charge with a fortuitous 51 runs off 32 balls, supported by Tim David’s late blitz.

Stephen Curry led the Golden State Warriors to a 111-95 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans



Stephen Curry made his much-anticipated return to the Golden State Warriors ’ lineup on Friday night, helping his team secure a 111-95 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans . After missing two games due to a left pelvic contusion sustained on March 20 against the Toronto Raptors, Curry propelled his team to a much-needed victory at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans.The Golden State Warriors felt Curry’s absence, losing both games without their star guard and falling to a 7-5 record when he doesn’t play. When the team needed him most, Curry did not disappoint, even if his shooting was not at its sharpest. He played 34 minutes, scoring 23 points and knocking down five three-pointers, despite hitting just 7 of 21 shots from the field.Warriors head coach Steve Kerr had hinted earlier in the day that Curry’s return was likely, stating, “I expect him to play.” Less than an hour before tip-off, the Warriors confirmed Curry was available and would start.The Pelicans were severely short-handed but came out strong and led by as many as 12 points in the first quarter. The Warriors, however, responded swiftly in the third quarter with an 8-0 run that included three-pointers from Curry and rookie Brandin Podziemski. The Warriors maintained control for nearly the entire second half.Jonathan Kuminga contributed 16 points, while Jimmy Butler added 18 points and 10 rebounds. The victory improved their road trip record to 1-2 as they are set to face some important matchups ahead against San Antonio, Memphis, and the Lakers.New Orleans faced a tough challenge, playing without four starters, including Zion Williamson, who was sidelined with a lower back injury.

The Pelicans were severely short-handed but came out strong and led by as many as 12 points in the first quarter.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119687435,imgsize-213384,width-400,resizemode-4/119687435.jpg"

NEW DELHI: At 43, Mahendra Singh Dhoni continues to prove why he is one of the greatest wicketkeepers in cricket history. During Chennai Super Kings ' (CSK) high-stakes IPL 2025 clash against Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) on Friday, Dhoni's lightning-fast reflexes behind the stumps brought Phil Salt ’s explosive innings to an abrupt end, leaving fans in awe.Salt, in red-hot form, had blazed his way to 32 off just 16 balls, smashing five fours and a six.However, his attacking onslaught was halted by a moment of Dhoni brilliance.Facing a deceptive googly from Noor Ahmad, Salt attempted a drive but was beaten by the turn. As he momentarily lifted his back foot while trying to regain balance, Dhoni—quicker than a blink—whipped off the bails in just 0.16 seconds.The decision was referred upstairs, and replays confirmed what everyone suspected—Salt’s foot was in the air when Dhoni completed the dismissal. The MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai erupted as yet another Dhoni masterclass was added to his legendary list of stumpings.This moment was a reminder of Dhoni’s heroics in CSK’s season opener against Mumbai Indians, where he had stunned Suryakumar Yadav with an equally breathtaking stumping. Even at 43, the CSK icon continues to outshine younger wicketkeepers with his unmatched agility and razor-sharp cricketing brain.With every such moment, Dhoni reinforces his legacy as a generational wicketkeeping genius, proving once again that age is just a number.","Mahendra Singh Dhoni continues to prove why he is one of the greatest wicketkeepers in cricket history.

MUMBAI: It’s a story of perseverance. The night of November 25, 2024, was a painful one for Shardul Thakur . Much to everyone’s surprise, the ‘Palghar Express,’ who had played 83 internationals for India, went unsold in the Indian Premier League auction. Just days before that, the 33-year-old had been left out of India’s squad for the Border Gavaskar Trophy to be played in Australia. For Thakur, it was a particularly bitter pill to swallow, given his big role in India’s historic win at the Gabba in 2021.Thakur had played a match-winning knock of 67 and taken a seven-wicket haul (7/69). However, at the pre-tour press conference, India’s head coach Gautam Gambhir signalled a shift toward younger players, stating that all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy represented India’s future. The statement effectively ended Thakur’s Test career.Refusing to be discouraged, Thakur, who had recently recovered from ankle surgery, bounced back spectacularly in the Ranji Trophy, finishing the season with 35 wickets in nine matches at 22.62 and scoring 505 runs at 42.08, including a century and four fifties.With the IPL seemingly out of reach, Thakur signed up with English county side Essex for the summer, hoping the experience would aid his chances ahead of India’s upcoming England tour.""He's not someone who sulks at home. He knew county cricket would help him if he got picked for the England tour. He’s been working hard on his game and fitness,"" said childhood coach Dinesh Lad.Then came the twist of fate.A call from Zaheer Khan, the mentor of Lucknow Super Giants, changed everything. With LSG’s left-arm pacer Mohsin Khan ruled out due to injury, Thakur was signed at his base price of Rs 2 crore. What has followed is nothing short of remarkable.Thakur, who wasn’t even in the IPL a week earlier, is now the tournament’s second-highest wicket-taker with six wickets in two matches.""Zaheer called me when I was playing Ranji and he said, 'You may be called in as a potential replacement, so don’t switch off',"" Thakur said after his 4/34 on Thursday against SRH on a flat pitch, an effort which followed his 2/19 in two overs against Delhi Capitals.""He has bowled superbly whenever he has come on. I was shocked that he only bowled two overs in the first match. He took two wickets in those two overs,"" Lad said.Few have seen Thakur’s struggles as closely as his wife, Mittali Parulkar, who has been part of his journey since they tied the knot on February 27, 2024.""When he wasn't picked at the IPL auction, he was disheartened for a day or two, but then he moved on. Just before that, he wasn’t picked for Australia, and he was already dealing with recovery from surgery. But he took it in his stride,"" Parulkar told TOI.",Shardul Thakur was left out of India's squad for the Border Gavaskar Trophy in Australia.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

AHMEDABAD: With victories eluding them in their opening matches, both Gujarat Titans and Mumbai Indians will look to get their campaign up and running here on Saturday.Mumbai missed their regular captain, Hardik Pandya , in their opening game, since he was suspended for a slow over-rate offence incurred last season. With Pandya back at the stadium where he lifted the trophy in 2022, ironically with Titans, the clash adds another dynamic to the relationship he enjoys with the crowd here.Booed last time he took the field here, Pandya will be eager to showcase his captaincy credentials and win the fans back as his team looks to bounce back from last season’s 10th-place finish.The Titans, meanwhile, will be kicking themselves for failing to get over the line against Punjab Kings in their opening encounter. They had the chase under control but faltered under some good bowling by Vijaykumar Vyshak.Their bowling was shredded apart by the likes of Shreyas Iyer. Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Kagiso Rabada and leg-spinner Rashid Khan will be looking for an improved bowling performance.The fielding was also below average, with dropped catches and misfields helping the Kings' cause.Mumbai, no doubt, will be heavily boosted by Pandya’s return. Their batters failed to get going at Chepauk, undone by Khaleel Ahmed’s pace and the guile of left-arm wrist spinner Noor Ahmad.Mumbai’s batters — Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Pandya, Will Jacks and Ryan Rickleton — should enjoy the true bounce and placid nature of the wicket here.Pacers Trent Boult and Deepak Chahar will look to challenge Gill, Sai Sudharsan and Jos Buttler, while left-arm wrist spinner Vignesh Puthur will look to continue his fairytale run.","Mumbai missed their regular captain, Hardik Pandya, in their opening game, since he was suspended for a slow over-rate offence incurred last season.

Vyshak Vijaykumar reveals how Shreyas Iyer and Arshdeep Singh backed his 'wide yorkers' plan

NEW DELHI: In a thrilling IPL encounter, Shardul Thakur 's impressive four-wicket haul and Nicholas Pooran 's sensational display of power-hitting guided Lucknow Super Giants ( LSG ) to a five-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) on Thursday.Thakur's dream comeback continued as he returned with figures of 4/34, helping LSG restrict the formidable SRH batting lineup to 190/9.Pooran then took center stage, showcasing his 360-degree hitting prowess with a blistering 70 off just 26 deliveries, including six fours and six maximums. His partnership with Mitchell Marsh (52 off 31) yielded a match-winning 116 runs for the second wicket, propelling LSG to chase down the target in just 16.1 overs.Despite losing Aiden Markram early in their chase, LSG surged ahead thanks to the effortless hitting from Marsh and Pooran. Pooran, in particular, was at his attacking best, dealing primarily in sixes and clobbering Simarjeet and Abhishek Sharma for massive hits, mostly towards the square boundary.SRH found it challenging to contain Pooran as he didn't even spare Cummins, hitting him for two fours in his first over to reach 77/1 in the powerplay. Pooran brought up the fastest fifty of the season in just 18 balls with another colossal six over square leg off Adam Zampa's bowling.Cummins eventually trapped Pooran in front of the wickets in the ninth over, but Marsh took the onus upon himself and brought up his half-century off just 29 balls. Although LSG skipper Rishabh Pant (15 off 15) couldn't contribute much, Abdul Samad played an entertaining cameo to guide his side home.Earlier, after opting to bowl first, Shardul (4/34) provided LSG with a fiery start, removing Abishek Sharma and the previous match's centurion, Ishan Kishan, in consecutive balls in the third over. While Shardul sent Sharma packing with a short delivery, he dismissed Kishan caught behind off an innocuous delivery down the leg side.Travis Head (47 off 28), however, looked in ominous form as he took the attack to the opposition, using his brute power to deal in boundaries and sixes. Head was particularly brutal against Avesh Khan, hitting him for two sixes and one four to pick up 18 runs in the fourth over.Head was fortunate to receive two reprieves, but his luck eventually ran out when fast bowler Prince Yadav disturbed his timbers to claim his first IPL wicket.Henrich Klaasen (26 off 17) was run out in a bizarre fashion by Yadav off his own bowling, while young Aniket Verma played a 13-ball 36-run cameo that included five sixes before falling to leg-spinner Disvesh Rathi.SRH skipper Pat Cummins (18 off 4) hit three sixes off his first three balls before departing in style, contributing to SRH's competitive total of 190/9.",Lucknow Super Giants ( LSG) beat Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) by five wickets. Shardul Thakur (4/34) and Nicholas Pooran (70) guided LSG to victory.

GUWAHATI: With the current Indian Premier League (IPL) season witness to some high-scoring games in the opening week, Wednesday’s match at the ACA Stadium then looked like an aberration.The Barsapara track offered help for the tweakers as Kolkata Knight Riders spinners, Varun Chakravarthy and Moeen Ali , ran through hosts Rajasthan Royals’ middle order to choke the flow of runs to restrict them to 151.On the wicket, Ali said, “It was good one, had a bit of everything — swing, bit of seam, spun nicely but not massively, just enough spin. I played here in the England warmup games (ahead of 2023 ODI World Cup); it’s a very nice ground.”Ali added that it was good that the track offered something for the bowlers.“Some of the wickets are amazing. India is a great place to bat actually, and when the wickets are like this, you’re not going to get 300, you probably won’t even get 200. So it’s great to have these games in between those big ones,” said Ali.Ali combined well with Chakravarthy as the duo shared four wickets between them. The English allrounder had praise for his ‘mystery’ partner Chakravarthy.“I came on before him (seventh over), so my job was to bowl tight. I’m used to bowling with somebody who’s better and has more mystery. So I bowl as tight as I can and hopefully, that builds pressure for them to get wickets,” Ali said.“Varun’s a brilliant bowler who has improved so much over the last two-three years. It’s amazing to bowl with him.”",Kolkata Knight Riders restrict Rajasthan Royals to 151. Moeen Ali and Varun Chakravarthy take four wickets between them.

After serving a one-match suspension for an over-rate offence from Mumbai Indians ' (MI) concluding match of the 2024 Indian Premier League season, Hardik Pandya will be back to lead the five-time champions in their second match of this edition against Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad on Saturday.Both MI and the 2022 champions Gujarat had lost their opening fixtures against Chennai Super Kings and Punjab Kings, respectively and are keen to put a win on the board for their first points.The MI squad utilised the extended break between their first and second matches by spending time at the Reliance facility in Jamnagar, where they participated in team-building exercises and relaxation activities.While the return of captain and all-rounder Hardik will come as a boost for MI, they will remain without the services of their premier fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah, who continues to recuperate from his back injury at the BCCI's Centre of Excellence on Bengaluru.Hardik's return to the playing eleven likely means Robin Minz's exclusion, although MI's batting performance on the tricky Chepauk pitch failed to generate confidence.The batting conditions in Ahmedabad on Saturday evening will prove more favourable, considering the substantial 475 runs scored in 40 overs during the first match of the season at the venue between Punjab Kings (243) and hosts Gujarat (232).But the batting-friendly surface at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad raises concerns about Mohammed Siraj's effectiveness, following his expensive spell of 54 runs in the previous match where Punjab batters dominated his bowling.With not many senior Indian pacers in the GT ranks, it will be a strategic call that home team head coach Ashish Nehra will fret upon. The pressure to contain runs as well as take wickets is way too much on Kagiso Rabada and Rashid Khan.Both the teams clearly had difficulties in finding the optimal blend of their overseas players.For MI, the challenges are further intensified due to Suryakumar Yadav's prolonged dip in performance over the past year, while Rohit Sharma also needs to rediscover his consistency.The addition of Pandya strengthens the batting lineup while offering bowling options, particularly at the start of the innings. His expertise in delivering wide yorkers during death overs.The Gujarat Titans' overall performance this season could heavily depend on captain Shubman Gill's batting form.The bowling department presents concerns for captain Gill, as the Indian pacers - Siraj, Prasidh Krishna and Ishant Sharma - predominantly employ similar hit-the-deck techniques. Apart from Rabada, the pace attack lacks variety in their bowling arsenal.","Hardik Pandya will lead Mumbai Indians against Gujarat Titans on Saturday.

There's something that comes to the fore for both batters and bowlers, especially the spinners.In the last match at this venue, Mumbai Indians were stuck on a slow surface and Chennai Super Kings were able to control the flow of the game courtesy their experienced spin attack of Ravindra Jadeja, R Ashwin and young Afghan sensation Noor Ahmad.While RCB bring in Krunal Pandya and Suyash Sharma, who can make a mark as well, CSK’s bowling against the RCB batting, especially the top order, could be decisive.CSK: Ruturaj Gaikwad(c), Rachin Ravindra, Deepak Hooda, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Sam Curran, MS Dhoni(wk), Ravichandran Ashwin, Noor Ahmad, Nathan Ellis, Khaleel AhmedImpact Sub: Rahul Tripathi, Kamlesh NagarkotiRCB: Virat Kohli, Philip Salt, Rajat Patidar (c), Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Rasikh Dar, Suyash Sharma, Josh Hazlewood, Bhuvneshwar KumarImpact Sub: Devdutt Padikkal/Yash DayalChennai Super Kings squad : Ruturaj Gaikwad (c), MS Dhoni, Ravindra Jadeja, Shivam Dube, Matheesha Pathirana, Noor Ahmad, Ravichandran Ashwin, Devon Conway, Syed Khaleel Ahmed, Rachin Ravindra, Rahul Tripathi, Vijay Shankar, Sam Curran, Shaik Rashid, Anshul Kamboj, Mukesh Choudhary, Deepak Hooda, Gurjanpreet Singh, Nathan Ellis, Jamie Overton, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Ramakrishnan Ghosh, Shreyas Gopal, Vansh Bedi, Andre Siddarth.Royal Challengers Bengaluru squad : Rajat Patidar (c), Virat Kohli, Yash Dayal, Josh Hazlewood, Phil Salt, Jitesh Sharma, Liam Livingstone, Rasikh Salam, Suyash Sharma, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Swapnil Singh, Tim David, Romario Shepherd, Nuwan Thushara, Manoj Bhandage, Jacob Bethel, Devdutt Padikkal, Swastik Chhikara, Lungi Ngidi, Abhinandan Singh, Mohit Rathee.Chennai Super Kings and Royal Challengers Bengaluru have played 33 matches against each other in the IPL.

CHENNAI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) have broken the Chepauk jinx, and how! When they last beat mighty neighbours Chennai Super Kings (CSK) at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, Rahul Dravid was still their captain. The only RCB player who was part of that 2008 squad and is still playing is Virat Kohli , and his face at the end of the 50-run rout said it all.At the other end of the spectrum were the shocked faces of those 34,000-odd CSK diehards, who are not exactly used to a humiliation of this magnitude in their own den. To add salt to CSK’s wounds, RCB had a forward short-leg and a slip in place in the 16th over when MS Dhoni finally came out to bat at No. 9.So many things must have felt so different for all those who have been turning up regularly at the Chepauk over the last 17 years. Adding to the list of ‘new’ was the ‘method’ in the RCB approach that had been missing from their game for so long.For years, an element of mindlessness had characterized their game, but on Friday night the RCB batters stuck to a plan and didn’t lose their heads.In a chase of 197, CSK lost two quick wickets to Josh Hazlewood early on and from there on, severely lacked the firepower to make a match of it. There was zero intent in the CSK approach and the defeat is an early reminder for them that old-school T20 cricket that they are still trying to recreate might have passed its sell-by date.This was their biggest-ever defeat at home. Before all that, RCB’s batters gave their bowlers a sound platform.With a batting lineup as deep as theirs, where Tim David comes at No. 7, the plan was to have at least one Indian batter who is good at playing spin at one end throughout the innings. While it was Virat Kohli (31 off 30 balls) in the beginning with Phil Salt (32 off 16) doing the heavy lifting, the back-end was left to skipper Rajat Patidar Given a life early on when Deepak Hooda dropped him at long-off, Patidar (51 off 32 balls) showed why he is so highly rated. There’s a natural elegance about his game. The right-hander plays spin with ease and there’s an ability to generate power.All these attributes were on display against a CSK attack that could have easily restricted a lesser batting lineup, but Patidar ensured that didn’t happen.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) beat Chennai Super Kings (CSK) by 50 runs. RCB last beat CSK at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in 2008. Rajat Patidar top scored for RCB with 51 off 32 balls.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119686625,imgsize-63128,width-400,resizemode-4/119686625.jpg"
