NEW DELHI: India pacer Mohammed Siraj hogged the limelight on the first day of the pink ball Test against Australia in Adelaide after one of his deliveries was recorded at an astonishing 181.6 km/h.

This incredible feat took place at Newlands in Cape Town, South Africa.The delivery was bowled to Nick Knight, and it remains a benchmark of sheer speed in cricket history. Shoaib, also known as the ""Rawalpindi Express,"" was renowned for his express pace and aggressive bowling style throughout his career.Close behind is Australia's Brett Lee , who bowled a 161.1 km/h (100.1 mph) delivery against New Zealand in Napier in 2005. His compatriot Shaun Tait matched Lee's feat against England in 2010 at Lord's.Former Aussie legend Jeff Thomson recorded 160.6 km/h (99.8 mph) during the 1975-76 series against the West Indies, making him one of the pioneers of extreme pace in cricket.

'Vinod Kambli didn't have the talent ... ': Rahul Dravid’s old video goes viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/vinod-kambli-didnt-have-the-talent-rahul-dravids-old-video-goes-viral/articleshow/116065625.cms,"Vinod Kambli (Image credit: X)

India vs Australia: How pink ball is different

NEW DELHI: An old video of Rahul Dravid sharing his thoughts on 'talent', specifically mentioning Vinod Kambli , has resurfaced on social media, gaining renewed attention after recent footage of Kambli's public appearance.Kambli, a childhood friend of cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar , created a stir during his initial cricketing years but struggled to maintain his position at the top level. His international career, which began in 1991, included 104 ODIs and 17 Tests for India but lasted less than a decade.In the viral video, Dravid praised Kambli's ""incredible ball-striking ability"" while reflecting on potential shortcomings in other critical areas needed to succeed at the international level.""I think we judge talent wrong. What do we see as talent? And I've made the same mistake. We judge talent by people's ability to strike a cricket ball. The sweetness or the timing of a cricket ball. That's the only thing we see as talent. Things like determination, courage, discipline, and temperament are also talents. When we judging talent, I think we've got to look at the whole package,"" Dravid said in the video.""It's a hard thing to explain but some people just have the gift of timing and ball-striking. Sourav Ganguly just had that ability to time a cover drive. He just had it. You could see. Sachin has it. And Viru. You wouldn't say that about someone like Gautam (Gambhir) as much as you would do for some of these other guys. Not that Gautam is less successful. So that's what we see as talent. We don't actually look at the other side of talent. We say, a talented player didn't make it. We always look at this side but maybe he didn't have the other talents,"" Dravid elaborated.""I hate to use... but Vinod's probably been one of the nicest guys that I've met. Vinod had an incredible ball-striking ability. I remember a game in Rajkot, Vinod got 150 against (Javagal) Srinath and Anil (Kumble). It was incredible. First ball Anil came onto bowl, he hit him straight into the stone wall. In Rajkot, there used to be a stone wall. He hit it bang straight onto it. I mean, we were all shocked, wow it was amazing. How do you do that? But maybe he didn't have the talent in the other areas to understand what it took to be an international cricketer, to deal with the stress and the pressure. I can only guess but maybe Sachin had that much more. That's why Sachin is where he is today,"" Dravid concluded.Kambli scored 1084 runs in his 17-Test career at an impressive average of 54.20, which included four centuries and three fifties.In ODIs, he scored 2477 runs across 104 matches at an average of 32.59, with two centuries and 14 fifties to his name.",An old video of Rahul Dravid discussing 'talent' has resurfaced on social media.

NEW DELHI: The fiery dismissal of Travis Head by Mohammed Siraj in the second Test sparked a storm on social media, with cricket fans and pundits weighing in on the dramatic exchange that followed.Siraj, known for his aggressive bowling and animated celebrations, delivered a perfect yorker to dismantle Head’s stumps on Saturday during the day-night Test at Adelaide.The moment escalated when Siraj approached Head with a fiery send-off, prompting boos from the Adelaide crowd and stirring heated debates online.Reactions poured in, with many criticizing Siraj’s behaviour as unsportsmanlike.A section of fans labelled the gesture disrespectful, with one comment reading, “Siraj, you’re a disgrace to yourself, Test cricket and your country.”Others argued that such aggression is part of the competitive spirit of the game.Some voiced support for Head, who had been pivotal with a stellar 140-run knock featuring 17 boundaries and four sixes.However, Indian fans were quick to defend Siraj, citing Head’s formidable history against India as justification for the bowler’s intensity.Head’s match-winning performances in high-pressure games, including his pivotal 137 in the ODI World Cup final, once again made the headlines.“I said, ‘Well bowled,’ but he thought otherwise when he pointed me to the sheds. Slightly disappointed with the way that transpired. It is what it is. If they want to react like that, and if that’s how they want to represent themselves, then so be it.” Head, explaining the Siraj incident, told broadcasters Fox Sports at the end of the day's play.""I don't want to give too much air to him (Siraj). I feel like going out and playing the game I would like,"" Head told reporters in the post-day conference. ""I would also like to stand up for myself. I would like to think that in our team we wouldn't do that, and that's how I like to play the game. I feel like my teammates are the same.""",Mohammed Siraj's fiery dismissal of Travis Head sparks a storm on social media.

NEW DELHI: A technical glitch hilariously made India pacer Mohammed Siraj world's fastest bowler on Friday as the speed gun saw him clocking an astonishing 181.6 kmph on the opening day of the second Test against Australia in Adelaide.On the day that saw 11 wickets falling, an Indian collapse, a solid Nathan McSweeney-Marnus Labuschagne stand and rising tempers, the Siraj speed blunder from the broadcasters late in third session also hogged the limelight.Also See: IND vs AUS 2nd Test Day 2 Live Score The rare and bizarre incident happened in the 25th over of the Australian innings, when Siraj fired in rising back of a length delivery outside off, which Marnus Labuschagne glided down to deep backward point for a boundary.However, soon after the delivery was completed, the bottom of the screen showed that Siraj had clocked a record 181.6 kph ball.The blunder was instantly caught by the fans and led to a meme fest on social media.Pakistan speed merchant Shoaib Akhtar currently holds the record of bowling the fastest ball ever in cricket.He fired in a stunning 161.3 kph (100.23 mph) ball against England during the 2003 World Cup in Cape Town, South Africa.Australia ended the day at 86 for one in reply to India's 180 all out in the first innings on the opening day of the Pink-ball Test.After a fiery Mitchell Starc career-best figures of 6 for 48 restricted India to 180 all out, McSweeney and Labuschagne's unbeaten 62-run stand for the second wicket helped Australia take the opening day's honours.For India, Jasprit Bumrah was the lone wicket-taker on Day 1.Australia trailed by 94 runs at the close of play.","India pacer Mohammed Siraj clocked 181.6 kmph on the speed gun on the opening day of the second Test against Australia in Adelaide.

"IND vs AUS: 'Robust selection panels needed to make tough decisions', says Greg Chappell",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/ind-vs-aus-robust-selection-panels-needed-to-make-tough-decisions-says-greg-chappell/articleshow/116093217.cms,"BCCI Photo

ADELAIDE: A frail but familiar figure sauntered into the Adelaide Oval on Saturday. Former Australia captain Greg Chappell , a bit older, a bit weather-beaten at 76 but still retaining that presence and keen cricketing sense, has been watching the goings-on in the second Test with interest.Chappell, having recovered from a recent bout of ill health, was delighted to run into Sunil Gavaskar and Ricky Ponting, but also took some time out to talk cricket.As the long conversation veered to this five-game series being played in the backdrop of both India and Australia facing questions of transition, the familiar twinkle in his eyes reappeared. As India coach, Chappell ostensibly faced the ire of senior players, fans and the establishment whenever he attempted to steer the team in a new direction. After his stint, the public perception remained — rightly or wrongly — that his brusque, ‘Australian’ management style wasn’t the best fit for India.Chappell disagreed with the notion that he wanted to shelve some stellar careers earlier than they would have preferred, but agreed that it becomes difficult for teams to make the tough calls.“You obviously want any great player to play as long as they can. They obviously love playing the game. They want to play it as long as they can. And they have every right to go on as long as they can. That’s why you need robust selection policies and selection panels to make those tough decisions,” he said.“The players might themselves want to make that decision, but it’s a well-paid job. Who’s going to want to walk away from that? That’s why someone else has to make that decision. It is tough to talk to those players about that. You’ve got to pick the right people to be selectors, those that are prepared to have those tough conversations.” Chappell said every big player goes through that stage when he realizes his powers are dipping.“You yourself know whether you’re at your peak or not. With good players you prefer to give them a game too many. It’s tough to get that balance right. When you have superstars, you want them to go on as long as they can. Occasionally, you might let them go on a bit too long. But no cricket team is ever a finished article. You’re always looking at ways to improve it,” he said.Fierce rivals India and Australia are preparing to face a similar predicament in the near future. How does one phase out fading superstars who still retain their popularity? The end of this long series may provide a few answers, but Chappell is someone who has seen it all before.“I don’t think it’s the hand-eye coordination, the mind goes. You get to that stage where you can’t give the game the singleminded focus,” he said. “A conversation with a mentor may remind you what you need to think about. It’s about whether you want to admit the time is up.”",Former Australia captain Greg Chappell says it is difficult for teams to make tough calls.

WELLINGTON: England's Joe Root etched his name into cricketing history by becoming the first English batter, and only the fourth in the world, to record 100 scores of fifty or more in Test cricket.The landmark achievement came during the second Test against New Zealand at the Basin Reserve on Saturday, when Root reached his 65th half-century in 76 balls during the third session of the second day’s play.Playing in his 151st Test match, Root’s remarkable feat places him among some of the game's greatest players. With 35 centuries and 65 fifties in 276 innings, the 33-year-old has accumulated a staggering 12,853 Test runs.Root now joins the elite company of Sachin Tendulkar Jacques Kallis , and Ricky Ponting , who are the only other players to surpass the 100 mark for 50+ scores in Test cricket. Tendulkar holds the record with 119, followed by Kallis and Ponting with 103 each.Root's achievement comes after a lean patch, where he struggled to find form following an impressive 262-run performance in Multan earlier this year. He endured a seven-innings streak without crossing the 50-run mark before his composed half-century in Wellington, which helped England seize a commanding position in the match.In addition to his historic 100th 50+ score, Root is now eyeing another significant milestone. With 1,417 Test runs in 2024, he needs just 83 more to become the second player in history to score 1,500 Test runs in multiple calendar years, a feat only Ricky Ponting has achieved, in 2003 and 2005. Root previously crossed the 1,500-run threshold in 2021 during his exceptional run of form.","Root becomes first English batter to record 100 scores of fifty or more in Test cricket.

Ponting: 'Siraj might have a bit to answer for'

'I'm going to stand up for myself': Head

Indian pacer Mohammed Siraj sparked controversy in Adelaide on Saturday after giving Australian batter Travis Head a fiery send-off during the second Test. Siraj dismissed Head for a scintillating 140 runs, but his animated celebration following the wicket drew criticism.During the incident, Siraj was flicked over deep square leg for six but he got his revenge a ball later. The Indian seamer's yorker castled Head who missed on converting the low full toss.As Head started to walk off, Siraj aggressively approached the left-hander and told him to get off. An irate Head responded by saying,"" F**k you, c**t"".Head, speaking to, expressed disappointment, remarking, “If they want to react like that... then so be it,” hinting at discontent with Siraj’s conduct.The incident provoked boos from the Adelaide Oval crowd, which continued throughout the rest of the Australian innings. The hostility is expected to persist for the remainder of the second Test and perhaps for the five-match series.Former Australian captain Mark Taylor weighed in on the matter during thepodcast, describing Siraj's behaviour as ""disrespecting the game.""Taylor criticised not only the send-off but also Siraj’s habit of prematurely celebrating potential dismissals, even before the umpire’s decision. Taylor cited an instance where Siraj celebrated what he thought was an LBW against Marnus Labuschagne , only for the appeal to be turned down.“I don’t know who instigated it, but it’s not a good look, particularly when a guy makes 140,” Taylor said of Siraj’s confrontation with Head.“I’d like to see someone have a little word to Mohammed Siraj.“I like his competitive nature, he’s a fine bowler… I don’t like the fact that when he hits a guy on the pads, and he thinks he’s got him out LBW, he continues to run down the pitch, past the batsman, almost gets to the keeper and then looks around to the umpire to see if he’s going to give it out.“That’s got to stop, and if it doesn’t stop shortly, someone – and it’ll be the umpires or the match referee – might stop it for him, and give him a game off. We don’t want that.”Taylor suggested Siraj’s teammates should step in to rein him back, emphasising the need to maintain respect for the game and its opponents, especially during high-stakes matches.“Someone like a Rohit Sharma or Virat Kohli needs to go up to him, and say ‘mate, yeah be excited, be aggressive, get in batsmen’s face, love all that, but that is disrespecting the game and the umpire’,” he said.Fellow host of the podcast and Australian wicketkeeper Brad Haddin agreed with Taylor. Haddin said it was a 'really bad look' and said it could fuel the Aussie crowds and team for the remainder of the summer.“I think what we’re going to see when he comes out to bat, these Australian quicks have got a long memory,” he said.“It’s a long series. I think they’re going to go after him and remind him about what happened.”However, former Australian seamer Brett Lee, no stranger to on-field outbursts himself, had sympathy for Siraj.“There’s nothing untoward there. I think the umpires make that call [to warn Siraj] to say ‘just chill out a little bit’,” Lee said on“The guy [Head] got 140, cops a spray – that wasn’t too bad.”Former Australian great Ricky Ponting was unimpressed by the exchange between Siraj and Head and said the bowler would almost certainly find himself in trouble with match official Ranjan Madugalle.""That’s what you call the old-fashioned send-off – umpires and referees do not see kindly to stuff like that,"" Ponting said on Channel Seven. ""Siraj wasn’t happy to be clipped over deep backward square for six… and he might have a bit to answer for.”While on Fox Cricket Kerry O’Keeffe said ""I don’t know whether a send-off is valid when a bloke’s 140.""At the conclusion of Day 2, Head said he regretted his own role in the incident but said he had taken exception to several encounters with the Indian cricket team during the series.“I actually jokingly said well bowled and then he pointed me to the sheds and I had my reaction as well. I don’t want to give it too much air time,” Head said “I was surprised at the reaction in terms of situation of the game and in the lead-up. There was no confrontation leading up to it. I felt like it was probably a little bit far at the time. That’s why I’m disappointed at the reaction that I gave back. But I’m also going to stand up for myself. That’s not how I’d like to play the game.”“There's been conversations I’ve had. I’ll leave those conversations to the individuals around that. Like I said, I feel like the way I would like to play the game and I guess the respect shown from myself and I hope my teammates, I hold high expectations of my teammates as well and the way we conduct ourselves and the way we go about things. I can’t speak much for India but I’m going to call out certain situations,” Head said.“I’ve had conversations with guys this series about that. I feel like you can play hard and play fair, but obviously, when you’re out, can’t do much about it. I’m disappointed with the reaction I had after that but certainly I’m going to stand up for myself I think the relationship (between the teams) is really, really good. I think that’s why I’m disappointed. I feel like the game has moved, and the way I play the game is having a good time. I want to enjoy myself. I want to play hard, play fair, and I have a joke with the fielders in the field, always interacting, and it’s been on very simple terms and enjoyable.""","Mohammed Siraj and Travis Head exchanged heated words on Day 2 of the second Test at Adelaide Oval.

#LIVE: India batters disappoint again after Travis Head’s ton in Adelaide Test vs Australia

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq has defended the national cricket team against the long-standing label of being ""unpredictable,"" arguing that such inconsistency is a natural part of cricket rather than a unique characteristic of Pakistan.Speaking at a press briefing during the Bahria Town Champions Cup , Misbah highlighted the inherent unpredictability in the game and cited examples from India's performances to support his stance.""India lost 3-0 to New Zealand at home and then went to Australia and beat them in Perth. Yet, no one calls India an unpredictable side (India 3-0 haari New Zealand se, jaake Australia ko Perth me hara diya. Waha unpredictable koi nahi kahega unko),"" Misbah said. He also pointed to England's fluctuating Test results, noting, ""England won a Test here, lost two after that, and then went to New Zealand and won another Test match.""Misbah argued that the label unfairly paints Pakistan in a negative light, with the team often facing disproportionate criticism compared to others. ""If something happens to us after 12 or 15 matches, people open the entire record of our team. Cricket is a game of unpredictability. Life itself is unpredictable,"" he remarked, defending Pakistan's performances in the broader context of the sport.While he agreed that Pakistan must strive for greater consistency, Misbah emphasized that stability in selection processes and policies, as well as a strong infrastructure, are critical for sustained performance. ""Consistency will come with consistency in selection and policies. When those are in place, along with a good infrastructure, performance will improve automatically,"" he said.Misbah concluded by reiterating that unpredictability is not unique to Pakistan but is a shared trait among all cricket teams. ""The gap between teams is not significant, so no one can predict in cricket. It's not just Pakistan; unpredictability is part of the game for all teams.""Misbah's remarks challenge the perception that Pakistan alone struggles with inconsistency, while also calling for a more balanced assessment of the team's performances on the international stage.","Former Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq has defended the national cricket team against the long-standing label of being ""unpredictable"" Misbah argued that the label unfairly paints Pakistan in a negative light, with the team often facing disproportionate criticism compared to others.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116094270,imgsize-85678,width-400,resizemode-4/116094270.jpg"

Travis Head punishes India with a counter-attacking hundred in Adelaide Test

Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting believes India's fast bowler Mohammed Siraj is likely to be penalized by the match referee for his fiery send-off to Travis Head after dismissing him on Day 2 of the pink-ball Test in Adelaide .After being flicked for a six by centurion Head, Siraj dismissed him next ball with a full delivery that crashed into the stumps. It led to Siraj giving Head the marching orders with a few unkind words as an unhappy Head also shot back.But the Australian batter had done his job by then, putting his team in the box seat with his attacking knock of 140 off 141 balls. India, who made just 180 in their first innings, then bowled out the hosts for 337 but fell behind by 157 runs.""That’s what you call the old-fashioned send-off – umpires and referees do not see kindly to stuff like that,"" said Ponting while speaking on Channel Seven. ""Siraj wasn't happy to be clipped over deep backward square for six... and he might have a bit to answer for.""Siraj copped a lot of criticism for his antics, including from former India captain Sunil Gavakar, who said Siraj became a ""villain"" for the Adelaide crowd, who booed the Indian bowler for his behaviour towards local boy Head.In their second innings, India slipped to 128 for 5, still 29 runs in the arrear and staring at a crushing defeat. Rishabh Pant was batting on 28 and Nitish Kumar Reddy on 15 when umpires called stumps on Saturday.Head was asked about the incident after the day's play and said that while he was ""surprised"" by the reaction, he doesn't want to give it too much ""air time"".""I actually jokingly said well bowled and then he pointed me to the sheds and I had my reaction as well.

So whatever BCCI does is in the interest of the players and the nation,"" Pathan told news agency ANI.Following extensive discussions, the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) has shown flexibility in its earlier stance of hosting the complete tournament within Pakistan's borders.Recent negotiations between the ICC and PCB have led to a significant breakthrough, with both parties tentatively agreeing to implement a hybrid model for international tournaments scheduled in Pakistan or India till 2027.This approach would enable both nations to participate in ICC tournaments hosted by the other country, with their matches being played at a neutral venue.","Yusuf Pathan voiced concerns over the ongoing standoff surrounding the 2025 Champions Trophy, set to take place in Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: England batter Zak Crawley achieved a remarkable Test record by smashing a six in the opening over against New Zealand in Wellington.After New Zealand's captain Tom Latham elected to field first, Crawley aimed for a quick start whilst trying to find his rhythm. Facing Tim Southee in the first over, he initially got runs through a thick inside edge towards the leg side off the first delivery.Following two runs off the subsequent delivery, Crawley waited for his next scoring chance on Southee's final ball. He struck it powerfully straight back over the bowler, managing sufficient height to clear the long-off boundary for six.The over yielded 10 runs for England and marked a significant milestone for Crawley.This feat marks only the third instance in Test cricket history where a six was scored in the opening over.The previous two instances occurred in the same over when West Indies' Chris Gayle struck Sohag Gazi for two sixes during a Test match against Bangladesh match in 2012.Notably, as Gazi bowled spin, Crawley became the first batsman to hit a six off a pace bowler in the first over of a Test innings.",Zak Crawley hits a six in the opening over against New Zealand in Wellington.

But it's the one thing that we actually admire the most about someone like Rohit Sharma who seemingly does have a lot of time to play,"" Hayden said on Star Sports.""Folks, don't be too disappointed. He got an absolute jaffer of a delivery. In fact, he got a great sequence of deliveries in the short time that he was out there under these lights.

Travis Head 's remarkable 141-ball innings of 140 during the pink-ball Test against India in Adelaide has garnered significant praise from cricketing icon Sunil Gavaskar Gavaskar, speaking to Star Sports, emphasised Head's distinctive approach to batting.""I think it's a difference in attitude. Where you look at every ball as a scoring opportunity, which is what he does. Which is what Rishabh Pant also does. He looks at every ball as a scoring opportunity.""Travis Head, why is he so popular? Why is he so dangerous? It's because he looks at everything as a scoring opportunity.

He not only stabilised the innings but also shifted the momentum firmly in his team's favor.Former Australian opener Matthew Hayden also commended Head's courage and consistency.""I think he made a promise to himself very early doors in his test match cricket. And some people aren't brave enough until they reach maybe 30 or even 40 test matches for their country. But he promised himself very early doors that he was going to play the way Travis Head wanted to play. And I admire that courage. Because it's not always easy.""Especially when you think back to the way that he's dominated India. When you think back to that world test championship, he would have got great confidence out of that. Because it was under some circumstances that he reached the crease at the Oval. And suddenly the game just seemed to open up. And it's amazing how quickly sides that have got this momentum going forward end up sort of reeling back. And that's his resolve and his commitment to himself. He's promised to himself that I'm going to do it my way,"" said Hayden on Star Sports.Head's impressive performance was supported by a strong partnership with Marnus Labuschagne , who contributed a steady 64 runs.

India reeling at 128 for five

NEW DELHI: A sizzling Travis Head ton was followed by a shock late Indian collapse as Australia tightened their grip in the day-night Test in Adelaide on Saturday.After India succumbed to 180 all out on the opening day of the second Test, the Australia batters shone bright on Day 2 with Head leading the way, notching up an incredible 140 -- his 8th ton in the format.To go with Head century, the second day of the Pink-ball Test was all about drama at the Adelaide Oval as there was no shortage of entertainment.From puzzling calls being made by the umpires to Head cradle-roll celebration to Mohammed Siraj 's ugly send-off and then an Indian batting collapse, the second day turned out to be a cricketing blockbuster.Amid all the razzmatazz, Australia did seize control of the game as India found themselves tottering at 128 for 5 in the second innings at the close of play after the hosts piled up 337 in their first essay.As India trail by another 29 runs, here's a look at the key moments of the action-packed Day 2:The third umpire's call on an India review turned heads first, late in the first session, as the manner and the hastiness with which Richard Kettleborough went on with the on-field call of not out, puzzled many.In the penultimate over of the first session, India reviewed for LBW but umpire Kettleborough, without seeing multiple replays decided not to overturn the on-field call in a dramatic turn of events.However, Marsh couldn't make the most of his luck as early in the second session, he had a brain fade moment and ruled himself out even when he wasn't off an R Ashwin delivery.Assuming that he had edged the ball, Marsh walked back after the catch was completed but replays later showed that there was no bat involved and Marsh was indeed not out.Travis Head continued to be India's thorn in the flesh as he scored an almost run a ball ton to take the game away from India on the second day. Head smacked the India bowlers left, right and centre, notching up the fastest day-night ton off just 111 balls, breaking his own record of 112-ball century against England (Hobart in 2022).He then followed it with an adorable cradle-roll celebration, dedicating his ton to his 5-week old son Harrison, who was at the stadium.A fiery Siraj bowled his heart out but as Head ton and Marnus Labuschagne (64) denied India early success with frustration was visible on Indian faces. However, when Siraj got the better of Head, he sent him off in an unruly manner which led to pacer's criticism.Even legendary Sunil Gavaskar wasn't much impressed by Siraj's actions as he labeled the send-off unnecessary. He even went on to say that the actions made Siraj a villain.The Siraj send-off was followed by boos around the stadium.Amid all the drama, Australia wrapped up their first innings at 337 in reply to India's 180 and took a sizable 157-run first innings lead.Already on the back-foot, India had to come out strong in their second essay but suffered an early blow in KL Rahul, who was dismissed for 7 by Pat Cummins.Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill then briefly steadied the Indian ship but then Scott Boland came in and got rid of Jaiswal and Virat Kohli in quick succession as India slid to 66 for three.The wickets of Gill and Rohit Sharma then put India further back in the game as the visitors ended the day at 128 for 5, still trailing by another 29 runs.",India trail Australia by 29 runs after second day of Pink-ball Test in Adelaide.

Mumbai: India and Mumbai's cricket greats Sunil Gavaskar and Dilip Vengsarkar paid rich tributes to Maharashtra pacer Anwar Shaikh, who passed away on Saturday at the age of 79. Anwar took 162 wickets in 61 first-class matches from 1965-66 to.1977-78 at an average of 30.65, with three five-wicket hauls.Showering rich praise on Shaikh, the legendary Gavaskar told TOI: “He was a terrific bowler. He was nippy and could move the ball both ways. He was a big-hearted bowler who could bowl all day for his captain. Today, he would be much sought after. He was born in the wrong era when spin was the king in India. (I'm) Very sorry to hear of his passing away.”Narrating how he was massively impressed when he saw the late fast bowler in action for the first time when he was playing for his school, King George, in Mumbai, Vengsarkar recalled: “Not many people know this. I saw Anwar Shaikh bowl for the first time when I was 8-10 years old. Somehow, he was playing for our school team-King George School against Dadar Union in a friendly match . In those days, a lot of Test cricketers used to play these friendly matches, and as kids staying in the Hindu Colony, we would go to watch them. He was bowling brilliantly to Ramnath Keni, who was an India player back then.”Like Gavaskar, Vengsarkar too felt that Shaikh was unlucky to not have played for India. “I later faced him in the Ranji Trophy while playing for Bombay against Maharashtra, both in Bombay and then Pune. I later played with him for the West Zone in the Deodhar Trophy in Chepauk in Chennai in 1975-76. He was a great, outstanding bowler. It's very unfortunate that he could not play for India.”The 116-Test veteran gushed about Shaikh’s ability to move the ball around. “He had a mastery over moving the ball. He could swing the ball like a banana. He would immediately know the weakness of a batsman and get his wicket. Unfortunately for him, the Maharashtra fielders dropped a lot of catches off him in the slips. Had they taken all those catches, his wickets tally would have been doubled,” Vengsarkar concluded.","India and Mumbai's cricket greats Sunil Gavaskar and Dilip Vengsarkar paid rich tributes to Maharashtra pacer Anwar Shaikh.

NEW DELHI: Australia fast-bowler Josh Hazlewood expressed his hope to feature in the upcoming Brisbane Test against India, stating that he has already ticked off a few recovery milestones and has more to go. Hazlewood is missing the ongoing day-night Adelaide Test due to a side strain, with Scott Boland replacing him in the playing eleven.“The body is feeling pretty good. I mean, it’s a long gap between the Tests, so it’s given me a few more days to try and recover. I have ticked off a few boxes this week so far, and looking to tick off a big one on day four – bowl a few spells throughout the day and see how it pulls up. So, fingers crossed for that day.”“I had a little bowl on one of the main training days, and was sort of just 70% then. So, yesterday I ticked off 80 to 90% at the nets and just keep building on that. I hope so, I hope so. The side’s been a bit of a niggle for me for a few years now. This is such a minor strain; ticked a few boxes already and a few more to tick, so fingers crossed,"" Hazlewood said to broadcasters Channel Seven during the dinner break.Hazlewood also addressed concerns raised after his comments following day three of the Perth Test, clarifying that the current Australian set-up is one of the tightest he’s ever been part of.“This is probably the tightest team I’ve been a part of in my whole career. We know each other inside out. I think (my quotes) were taken a little bit out of context. It’s probably like asking an opening batter about trying to take 10 wickets the next day.”“You’re not a big part of it. From a number 11’s point of view, that was probably my thinking at the time. Could’ve worded it a little bit better I guess but definitely no qualms with the playing group.”","Hazlewood is missing the ongoing day-night Adelaide Test due to a side strain.

Forest kept the home side at bay after Bruno Fernandes pulled one back.United's Andre Onana was embarrassed by a swerving Gibbs-White strike for Forest's second while the goalkeeper, Lisandro Martinez and Matthijs De Ligt all failed to deal with a looping Wood header for the third.The win lifts Forest to fifth in the Premier League table.

We have to win games to help us improve the team.""We are in the start of something so big that we pay attention to every detail. We already know it's a big job so we have to continue.""Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo said ""I'm very proud of the way we work together, build things together, from the owner to everyone else in the club.""It's a moment to celebrate.

Jude Bellingham guided champions Real Madrid to a comfortable 3-0 victory at Girona on Saturday in La Liga , with Kylian Mbappe also on the scoresheet after two high-profile penalty misses in recent games.Los Blancos cut the gap on league leaders Barcelona to two points after the Catalans drew 2-2 at Real Betis , with Madrid having played one fewer match.Bellingham opened the scoring before half-time and set up Turkish playmaker Arda Guler for Madrid's second, before Mbappe produced a clinical finish for their third.Both Bellingham and defender Ferland Mendy were replaced with apparent knocks in the second half ahead of Tuesday's Champions League clash at Atalanta.Coach Carlo Ancelotti confirmed Bellingham was ""available"" for the game but said Mendy had suffered a muscular injury.After Madrid's fifth defeat across all competitions in midweek against Athletic Bilbao, having lost just twice last season, Ancelotti pledged his team would improve and they were significantly better against Girona.""Bellingham scored his fifth goal running (in La Liga), Mbappe scored, Brahim (Diaz) did good work, Arda scored a great goal,"" Ancelotti said.""We have to bear the moment out and as I said, bit by bit we will come back (to form).""With Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo sidelined, Ancelotti selected Bellingham and Diaz in support of Mbappe.The French forward has been the focus of criticism in recent weeks after blowing penalties against Liverpool and Athletic Bilbao, and struggling to find the form which made him a star with Paris Saint-Germain and his country.Girona, who ran Madrid close for the Spanish title for much of last season before eventually finishing third, started the stronger but Madrid soon clicked into gear.Bellingham pounced after 36 minutes when Diaz's cross was blocked and the ball fell kindly to the England international to drill home.It was Bellingham's fifth goal in his last five La Liga games, finding the form which powered Madrid to a Champions League and La Liga double last season.Los Blancos got their second in the 55th minute when Bellingham threaded through a fine pass for Guler to finish.Mbappe rattled in Madrid's third from a tight angle after Bellingham hobbled off with a knock after Luka Modric played him in down the right.Ancelotti will hope Madrid can carry some momentum into the vital Champions League visit to Atalanta, for which Vinicius is expected to return from a hamstring problem.Girona, eighth in La Liga, welcome Liverpool in the Champions League on Tuesday.Earlier Real Betis twice came behind to stop Barcelona from triumphing in Seville.Assane Diao levelled in the 94th minute to stun Barcelona, who opened the scoring after 39 minutes through Robert Lewandowski.After Giovani Lo Celso levelled for the mid-table hosts from the penalty spot, substitute Ferran Torres struck what seemed the winner before Diao's late intervention.Barcelona coach Hansi Flick said his team had to improve on the road, where most of their set-backs have come this season.""We have the quality to win every match but we also have to show that,"" said Flick.""(In) the away matches we have to be much stronger than we played here.""Real Betis started strongly, with Raphinha forced to clear Diego Llorente's header off his own goal-line.The electric Yamal helped Barcelona get on top as Betis sat deep and the Catalans found the breakthrough shortly before the break with a slick move finished by Lewandowski.It was the 36-year-old striker's 16th league goal of the campaign and he leads the charts in Spain.The hosts levelled with a penalty converted by Lo Celso, when Frenkie de Jong stepped on the heel of Vitor Roque, on loan at Betis from Barca, with Flick sent off for protesting.""I'm really disappointed about (my red card), I thought that would never happen to me,"" Flick told reporters.Torres netted his second goal in two games to put Barca back in front before Diao struck late on.""I'm very happy with the goal,"" said the 19-year-old forward.
