A voyage of grit: From riding bikes to becoming circumnavigators,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-voyage-of-grit-from-riding-bikes-to-becoming-circumnavigators/articleshow/121474746.cms,"Lt Commanders Roopa (left) and Dilna will sail into Goa’s Mormugao Port on Thursday evening, marking the end of a historic, eight-month-long voyage

Panaji: As a child, Dilna K was afraid of heights. Today, she climbs the INSV Tarini's 25-metre-high mast in the middle of the ocean. In Puducherry, another family watches with similar awe as Roopa Alagirisamy, once a girl with dreams of space, returns after conquering the world's oceans. The two naval officers - Lt Commanders Dilna K and Roopa Alagirisamy - will sail into Mormugao Port on Thursday evening, marking the end of a historic, eight-month-long voyage. Their journey covered 25,400 nautical miles, crossing four oceans and rounding the three Great Capes - a feat attempted by few, and achieved by fewer. Though they grew up on opposite sides of the Anaimalai Hills, what binds them is a relentless grit - a refusal to accept ceilings, whether on land or at sea.From the age of 10, Dilna was never one to be found indoors. While other children studied for tests, she was outdoors - wielding a cricket bat with the boys from her colony or chasing football down dusty lanes. ""She found her passion for rifle shooting in NCC and became a national shooter. Shooting is expensive, she always had to compromise on training and good equipment. I remember her travelling from Kozhikode to Idukki almost every two weeks to practice at a good range,"" Dilna's sister Deepthi said.Before her father, an Army man, passed away in 2015, Dilna made a promise that she would represent India at the international level. On Thursday, as Tarini sails into Mormugao Port, she brings that promise home. Dilna had always been a daddy's girl and still rides her father's Royal Enfield as an ode to him.""She used to pull out 100 buckets of water per day from our well as a young girl to build up her muscles and we used to make fun of her. She would climb coconut trees to develop agility, even though she was scared of heights,"" said Deepthi.Like Dilna, Roopa's journey was shaped by setbacks, and a stubborn refusal to give up. Roopa grew up dreaming of space. With a BE in aeronautical engineering, she even worked a stint with the National Aerospace Laboratories, Bengaluru. But her true launchpad came from the Navy. ""Roopa faced so many SSB interviews. It felt like she was going in circles,"" said her younger sister Durga Monica. ""She decided to make one final attempt. And cleared it.""After being commissioned in June 2017, Roopa's job at the Naval Armament Inspection division in Mumbai required her to inspect weapons, guns, rocket launchers and torpedoes that went into warships and submarines. It is here that she picked up sailing, first as a dinghy sailor and then in competitive sailing. ""She never wanted an ordinary life, with a 9-5 job. She wanted something that others would not do,"" said Monica. ""If you give Roopa an opportunity, she will grab it and there is nothing that will stop her.""Whether it was bungee jumping or her decision to take up surfing, the Alagirisamys had no inkling of Roopa's adventurous streak. ""Nobody knows truth about when she volunteered for sailing in the circumnavigation. She never told any of this to us,"" said Monica, laughing.Behind the Tarini's voyage are two stories of persistence, parallel, yet bound by the same wind.Roopa and Dilna's journey echoes the trail first charted by INSV Tarini's all-women crew in 2018. In 2024, Roopa and Dilna made it their own.","Lt Commanders Dilna K and Roopa Alagirisamy will sail into Goa’s Mormugao Port on Thursday evening.

Ben Stiller reacts to McAfee’s objectionable commentary



Actor and ardent New York Knicks fan Ben Stiller has brushed off sports analyst Pat McAfee’s objectionable comments during Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals on Tuesday. A host of celebrity fans, including actors Stiller and Timothée Chalamet and director Spike Lee, were among the spectators as the Knicks faced the Indiana Pacers on the latter’s home ground at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. McAfee, who provided some commentary, went on to call out the celebrity audience while pitching for the Indiana Pacers.On top of McAfee’s comments, the Indiana Pacers went on to beat the New York Knicks 130–121. It seems the adrenaline was running too high for McAfee as he called out the New York Knicks’ celebrity fans, who had come down to Indianapolis from New York just to watch the game. The home crowd even booed as McAfee said, “Spike Lee is here. Ben Stiller is here. Timothée Chalamet is here. Let’s send these sons of b****es back to New York. ”After the game, actor Ben Stiller came across a video of McAfee’s comment on X and reacted to it, “Yes. Weird. We were happy to be there and cheer our team, and other than that, Indy fans were awesome.” He went on to respond to other users as they weighed in on the incident.An X user and likely Indiana Pacers fan wrote, “You’re right, it wouldn’t happen in New York.Your fans decide throwing trash bags at the other team’s fan in the street is okay. A little friendly banter to rile up a crowd? Cmon man.” Responding to him, Stiller wrote, “All good. The garbage was bad.”The actor also shared a message for a Knicks fan who said he didn’t like what McAfee said. Replying to him, Stiller wrote on X, “It’s ok. He must be playing around - if it’s an actual point of view, it seems a little anachronistic or cliche? Like we are ‘big city celebs’ and we shouldn’t be there in the heartland? Again, everyone we met was awesome and incredibly cool.”When an X user said that Pacers fans booing the celebrity names were “all affectionate boos,” Stiller wrote, “I promise you, I actually felt that.” He added, “No bitterness at all Indy fans were amazing, good win for you guys.” Replying to another tweet, Stiller also said, “Appreciate that. Just wouldn’t not happen in NY.”Also Read: “HE GOTTA GO” — Frustrated New York Knicks fans demand firing of head coach Tom Thibodeau after Game 4 loss Stiller and Chalamet have been among the biggest celebrity fans of the New York Knicks.

In a recent episode of the New Heights podcast hosted by NFL brothers Jason and Travis Kelce, hockey legend Wayne Gretzky joined as a special guest—and made headlines for more than just his thoughts on the NHL playoffs. Amid a spirited conversation about his storied career and the current Stanley Cup race, Gretzky turned his attention to an emerging icon in a different sport: WNBA star Caitlin Clark.Known as “The Great One” in hockey circles, Wayne Gretzky is admired not just for his on-ice brilliance but also for his perspective on sports and life. That was on full display during the podcast when he acknowledged Caitlin Clark’s soaring popularity and the broader effect she’s had on women’s sports.“Look at Caitlin Clark—how she’s just taken over the country, for that matter, maybe the world,” Gretzky said. “She’s encouraged so many young girls now to participate in sports, whether it’s basketball, or soccer, volleyball.”This kind of praise from one of the most respected figures in sports history underscores just how transformative Clark’s presence has become. From sold-out arenas to record-breaking TV ratings, her influence has extended well beyond the basketball court.She’s helped shift how fans, media, and even other athletes view women’s sports.Gretzky didn’t stop at praising Clark’s star power. He also touched on the timeless values sports instill in young people—many of which are embodied by Clark's journey through college and now professional basketball.“My dad used to always say the greatest thing about sports is that you learn so much about real life. You learn how to be unselfish, you learn how to be dedicated, you learn how to work hard, you learn how to win, and you learn how to pick yourself up off the ground when you lose—and that’s life.”Also Read: Wayne Gretzky weighs in on Sam Reinhart's injury and its impact on the Panthers' Stanley Cup hopes As Caitlin Clark begins her second season with the Indiana Fever, the accolades keep coming.

Lauren Kyle opens up about the playoff vibe in Edmonton and her personal style journey

As the Edmonton Oilers continue their deep playoff run, the city is buzzing with anticipation and passion. But it's not just the on-ice action drawing attention—Lauren Kyle, wife of Oilers captain Connor McDavid, is making waves in her own right, blending her love for fashion with the electric atmosphere of playoff hockey.Last December, Lauren Kyle launched her fashion label, Sports Club Atelier, which quickly resonated with fans looking for stylish, sport-inspired apparel.

Everyone’s on edge, the fans are fully dialled in and you can feel how much it means to people,” she said. “I love being part of that. It’s emotional, exciting and a little chaotic in the best way. For me, it’s not just about the game—it’s about the vibe, the atmosphere, the outfits and the rituals.”Her words speak to a deeper cultural experience—playoff hockey in Canada is more than just a sport; it's a communal ritual where emotion, identity, and tradition collide.For Kyle, fashion has become her way of expressing and enhancing that experience.“Since starting the brand, my game-day style has evolved so much.

Brandin Podziemski had successful surgery on his left wrist

The Golden State Warriors have recently confirmed that Stephen Curry’s teammate, Brandin Podziemski, underwent successful surgery on his left wrist. The team announced that the 22-year-old had a debridement procedure in Los Angeles this week. He is expected to fully recover and return in time for training camp. The surgery, done on Podziemski’s shooting hand, may offer clarity on his post-season shooting slump with the Warriors.Brandin Podziemski quietly played through significant discomfort during the Golden State Warriors' postseason run. According to the Warriors' official release, the young guard had successful left wrist debridement surgery and is on track to be ready for the 2025-26 season.“Brandin Podziemski underwent successful left wrist debridement surgery yesterday in Los Angeles. He is expected to make a full recovery and be ready for the start of training camp,” the Warriors wrote on X.Orthopedic specialist Dr. Nirav Pandya explained on social media that wrist debridement involves the removal of inflamed or scar tissue within the joint, helping to improve mobility and healing.The timing of this surgery now raises questions about Podziemski’s playoff performance.After shooting a solid 44.5% from the field and 37.2% from three during the regular season, his postseason numbers dropped to 36.4% overall and 32.8% from deep. The shooting dip became more noticeable in the Western Conference Semifinals against Minnesota, where he converted just 9 of 40 shots (22.5%) through the first four games.Despite the struggles, Podziemski still had moments of brilliance, most notably a 28-point performance against Houston in Game 4 of the first round and another 28-point effort in the season-ending loss to the Timberwolves. But the pain may have affected his consistency. In his own words, after his Game 4 outburst, Podziemski reflected on his mindset:""First, you got to tell yourself you belong in the moment. Good and great players want to be in the moment, thrive in the moment, don't back down from it.""""Everything I do, I'm never going to have a regretful decision. I'm just going to go out there and know and tell myself I belong, because I do.""The Warriors rode a strong finish into the playoffs, with Podziemski part of a revamped starting lineup that included Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, Moses Moody, and Jimmy Butler. That unit helped the team finish 48-34, eventually defeating the Rockets in seven games before bowing out to Minnesota.Also Read: Tyrese Haliburton earns massive praise from Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson after creating history in Indiana Pacers’ Game 4 win against New York Knicks Now entering his third season, Podziemski remains under contract through 2027.

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

NEW DELHI: The Indian Test team has officially stepped into its much-anticipated transition period, with Shubman Gill named captain for the upcoming five-match series in England. Wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant has been appointed vice-captain. The squad also features Karun Nair, marking his return to the national fold after eight years. Nair, who last represented India in 2017, was dropped soon after becoming only the second Indian to notch a triple century in Test cricket.Among the notable omissions for the England tour, Shreyas Iyer 's absence stood out. Chief selector Ajit Agarkar explained the decision, saying: ""Shreyas had a good one-day series, played well in domestic as well but right now there's no room in Test cricket.""India head coach Gautam Gambhir addressed Iyer’s exclusion for the first time on Wednesday.""Mai selector nahi hun (I am not a selector),"" was Gambhir’s sharp retort to a journalist asking about Iyer’s omission from the squad.Iyer's leadership skills will be under the spotlight when Punjab Kings take on Royal Challengers Bengaluru in Qualifier 1 of IPL 2025 on Thursday — a high-stakes clash between two confident teams.With the cushion of a top-two finish, both sides are expected to go all out, aware that even a defeat in this match would offer another shot at making the final.Punjab Kings are navigating uncharted waters, having qualified for the play-offs for the first time since 2014.

Auston Matthews and his fans got emotional as his mother opened up about the financial struggles of getting him into hockey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/auston-matthews-and-his-fans-got-emotional-as-his-mother-opened-up-about-the-financial-struggles-of-getting-him-into-hockey/articleshow/121166477.cms,"Image credit - Paige Taylor White/CP

Auston Matthews’ hockey dream wasn’t cheap and his mom took the weight

“I used to work in the morning for Starbucks, in the afternoon the restaurant, i was very fortunate to have two jobs. And believe me, if they would have more hours, I would have more jobs.""

Before Auston Matthews was an NHL superstar, his biggest supporter was clocking into two jobs, trying to make ends meet. His mom, Ema Matthews, didn’t just believe in his dream, she bankrolled it, penny by penny, from behind a Starbucks counter. For families without deep pockets, hockey can be financially brutal. But Ema’s resilience turned obstacles into opportunity and her son into one of the league’s brightest stars. Her story is the heartwarming reminder that every great athlete often has a real-life superhero cheering from the sidelines, sacrificing, hustling, and holding it all together so their child can chase the impossible.Ice time, gear, coaching, travel, youth hockey isn’t just a sport, it’s a financial beast. For the Matthews family, especially with Ema being originally from Hermosillo, Mexico, the culture and cost of the sport were both daunting. But she took on the challenge without hesitation, picking up multiple jobs including a gig at Starbucks to ensure Auston never missed a chance to grow on the ice.Ema shared in a past interview that the cost of hockey often reached up to $20,000 a year, a heavy ask for any middle-class family. To make it work, she didn’t just cut corners, she picked up shifts and poured lattes while helping Auston stay focused on the sport. She even deposited small amounts of money in his account so he could grab food with teammates like a regular teen. Beyond that, Ema often drove long hours to tournaments, handled equipment costs, and juggled bills, all to ensure Auston had every chance to chase his dreams without added stress.Ema’s story also breaks stereotypes. In a sport dominated by players from Canada and northern U.S. states, Auston’s rise as a player of Mexican heritage makes his success even more impactful. It's not just about talent, it’s about trailblazing, especially for kids of color or immigrant families who rarely see themselves represented in hockey.Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the NHL. He’s not just known for his goal-scoring skills but also for his poise and work ethic, traits his mom likely helped instill. While fans celebrate his success on the ice, stories like Ema’s remind us of the sacrifices behind the scenes that made it possible.Ema Matthews’ story shows what’s possible when love, grit, and hustle lead the way, proving that behind every great athlete stands a family whose unwavering support shapes both their character and their incredible achievements. Her journey highlights the sacrifices, encouragement, and strength that fuel success, reminding us that triumphs on the ice are built far beyond the rink, in the hearts and homes of those who believe the most.Also read - “From baptism to strip club”: Pete Blackburn’s unhinged NHL comparison is going viral and fans totally get it","Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the NHL.

RCB vs PBKS, IPL Qualifier 1: Quick Singles from Mullanpur | Indian Premier League

NEW DELHI: During a light-hearted moment at Mumbai Indians ' (MI) training session, veteran fast bowler Trent Boult entertained teammates by trying to imitate fellow New Zealander Mitchell Santner ’s bowling action. The result was a wildly inaccurate delivery that drew a witty comment from Jasprit Bumrah : “That’s why we should stick to fast bowling.”The MI squad was in the middle of preparing for their all-important IPL 2025 Eliminator clash against the Gujarat Titans, set to take place on May 30 at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium in Mullanpur.Boult’s comic impersonation brought a sense of fun to the intense session, highlighting the team’s strong bond and relaxed atmosphere.Boult, renowned for his lethal swing, rejoined MI this season after being picked up for Rs 12.5 crore in the IPL mega auction.

Tom Brady thrives post-Gisele Bündchen divorce with Italian flair

Even in retirement, Tom Brady refuses to stay off the scoreboard—on or off the field. Two years after his high-profile divorce from Gisele Bündchen, the NFL legend is rewriting his own playbook, turning heads from Venice, Italy to Las Vegas, Nevada.Recently spotted throwing footballs in the narrow streets of Venice, surrounded by a group of admiring Italian women, NFL legend Tom Brady looked every bit the icon he’s always been. The seven-time Super Bowl champion seemed relaxed and energized—no pads, no stadium, just the streets of Italy and a perfect spiral. The moment felt like a metaphor for his post-NFL life: unconventional, enviable, and still centered around football.While his former partner Gisele Bündchen is forging her own path, Brady’s journey since their 2023 split has been all about reinvention. Beyond becoming the most decorated quarterback in league history, he’s now a powerful media figure and NFL investor.Tom Brady's record-breaking $375 million contract with Fox Sports made waves, solidifying him as the highest-paid sports analyst ever. His debut as a broadcaster was on the grandest stage possible—the Super Bowl—surpassing household names like Greg Olsen and Tony Romo.But Tom Brady’s influence isn’t limited to television. As a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, he’s reportedly taken an active role in shaping the team’s future. The franchise’s recent decisions—including hiring veteran coach Pete Carroll and drafting standout running back Ashton Jeanty—have Brady’s fingerprints all over them.“Tom Brady has already hit a home run with Ashton Jeanty before he takes an NFL snap,” one source noted, hinting at the quarterback's eye for talent and leadership.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s $400M empire: How the supermodel rebuilt her life after divorce with Tom Brady and welcomed baby no. 3 Away from the gridiron, Brady’s life has taken on a new rhythm.

Carter Hart’s lawyer questions Brett Howden over what he saw in hotel room 209

Brett Howden’s memory questioned over past head injury and forgotten details

The Hockey Canada sexual assault trial involving five former members of the 2018 World Junior hockey team resumed in a London, Ontario courtroom, with NHL forward Brett Howden facing a pointed cross-examination over what he witnessed during the alleged incident.Brett Howden, testifying remotely from Las Vegas where he now plays for the Golden Knights, was questioned by Megan Savard, the lawyer representing Carter Hart. Hart is accused of sexually assaulting a woman known as E.M., including receiving oral sex during the early morning of June 19, 2018, in room 209 of the Delta hotel.Savard pressed Howden on statements he gave in 2018, asking whether Hart initially seemed hesitant to accept E.M.'s offer. “The impression you got was that Mr. Hart didn’t really seem like he wanted to agree to oral sex at first,” she suggested. Howden agreed, citing Hart’s possible desire to “look cool in front of his teammates.”Megan Savard further probed Howden’s recollection: “They like, kind of went to each other like it was 50/50… and then she gave him oral sex.” Howden confirmed that was his statement.In a strategic move, Megan Savard also cast doubt on the reliability of Howden’s memory.She reminded the court that he suffered a severe head injury in March 2022 during a televised game, in which he lost consciousness for nine minutes and was stretchered off the ice.Howden acknowledged the injury and admitted, “I’ve never really had to remember, try to remember so many little details like this before. And it’s definitely gotten a lot harder over time.”Adding another layer to the proceedings, Justice Maria Carroccia dismissed a key text message sent by Howden to teammate Taylor Raddysh days after the alleged incident. In the message, Howden wrote, “Dude, I’m so happy I left when all the s--t went down… Duber was smacking this girl’s ass so hard.”Also Read: Florida Panthers get injury boost ahead of Game 4 as Paul Maurice reflects on playoff pressure The judge ruled the message inadmissible, citing that Howden had “no present recollection” of the event and may not have been speaking from personal observation.

NEW DELHI: One of India's most crucial all-rounders in recent times, Ravindra Jadeja , has revealed that the two most influential figures in his cricketing journey share not just a first name, but also hail from the same state — Bihar.In a candid conversation on the podcast ‘Kutti Stories with Ash’, hosted by teammate Ravichandran Ashwin, Jadeja opened up about how both his childhood coach and his legendary mentor MS Dhoni have been central to his career.""My cricketing journey is between two Mahendras — Mahendra Singh Chauhan and Mahendra Singh Dhoni ,"" Jadeja said. ""I started playing in Jamnagar, at a ground called 'Cricket Bungalow', at the age of 8-9. My coach, who is still training at the same ground, is also from Bihar and his name is Mahendra Singh Chauhan. I have told this to Mahi bhai as well.”Jadeja recalled how Chauhan, a former police officer, laid the foundation for his athleticism and on-field agility.""He used to be a police officer, his mindset was that a sportsperson should be at the peak of his fitness. He used to believe that batting and bowling can be managed but one has to run a lot. My fitness level and fielding skills can be attributed to me running 15-20 kms around Jamnagar,"" Jadeja shared.When Ashwin asked him to describe Dhoni in a single word, Jadeja said, ""There is no one word to describe his greatness. He is on top of everyone.""Both Jadeja and Ashwin played crucial roles under Dhoni — not just for Team India, but also as key bowlers for Chennai Super Kings during the team’s IPL dominance.The discussion also touched upon Virat Kohli , India’s most successful Test captain, who recently stepped away from the longest format. Jadeja lauded Kohli’s unwavering intensity and winning mindset.""It was his positive approach — especially in Tests — the special thing about Virat is that he always wanted the team to pick 20 wickets in a Test match, so he never gives up at all. Be it a three-hour session or 45 overs left, he would still want to pick up all 10 wickets of the opposition,"" Jadeja said.Kohli walked away from Test cricket with an outstanding record — 9,230 runs in 123 matches at an average of 46.85, including 30 centuries and 31 fifties.","Ravindra Jadeja reveals MS Dhoni and Mahendra Singh Chauhan are his two most influential figures in his cricketing journey.

Clippers revisit Jrue Holiday pursuit amid Celtics' financial constraints

The Los Angeles Clippers are creating a stir in the NBA trade rumor world as they aim to acquire Boston Celtics guard Jrue Holiday. With James Harden expected to stick around in Los Angeles, the Clippers are considering ways to enhance their backcourt, and Holiday's championship experience along with his defensive skills make him a prime target.The Clippers have had their eye on Jrue Holiday for a while now. Back in 2023, they tried to get him but lost out to the Celtics, who sent Malcolm Brogdon, Robert Williams III, and a couple of future first-round picks to the Portland Trail Blazers for Holiday. Now, with the Celtics dealing with hefty luxury tax penalties—over $40 million into the luxury tax and $20 million into the second apron—they might be more willing to trade high-salary guys like Holiday to ease their financial burden.Holiday, who has won the NBA championship twice and made the All-Defensive Team six times, put up averages of 11.1 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 3.9 assists in the 2024–25 regular season. His defensive abilities and leadership could really enhance Harden's scoring skills, forming a strong backcourt partnership for the Clippers.To make a trade happen, the Clippers could think about putting together a deal that features players like Bogdan Bogdanovic ($16 million salary) and Drew Eubanks ($4.75 million), plus a young talent like Jordan Miller or Cam Christie to balance the salaries.But whether the Celtics would go for this kind of offer would hinge on how they view the potential and compatibility of the new players with their team.For the Celtics, moving Holiday could ease their financial burden and give them a chance to nurture younger players, particularly since star Jayson Tatum is likely to be out for most or all of the upcoming season due to injury. Even without Tatum, the Celtics are feeling good about their competitiveness, highlighting the team's depth and resilience.Also Read: Kevin Durant’s focused glance at Cameron Brink has basketball fans talking The Clippers are back on the Jrue Holiday train, which fits perfectly with their aim to create a championship-worthy team around James Harden. On the flip side, the Celtics might consider trading Holiday as a smart move to handle their finances and focus on the team's future. As the NBA offseason rolls on, this possible trade is definitely something to keep an eye on, as it could have big effects for both teams.","Clippers revisit Jrue Holiday pursuit amid Celtics' financial constraints.

NEW DELHI: Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia , who spearheaded the protest against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief and former BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, responded strongly after a Delhi court dismissed the sexual harassment case filed under the POCSO Act against him.Bajrang was the first to react, pointing out that Brij Bhushan organized a grand roadshow to celebrate the court’s decision, even though six other cases against him are still ongoing.He shared a detailed post on his social media account expressing his concerns.Brij Bhushan Singh POCSO Act mein bari hone ke baad road show kar raha hai aur apni jeet dikha raha hai, jabki abhi 6 mahila pehalwanon ke case court mein chal rahe hain [After being acquitted in the POCSO Act, Brij Bhushan Singh is doing road shows and showing his victory, while the cases of 6 women wrestlers are still going on in the court],"" Bajrang worte.""Jab mahila pehalwan aandolan par baithi thi, usi samay hi naabaaligh mahila pehalwan Brij Bhushan ke dabav mein peeche hat gayi thi jabki ek baar woh Brij Bhushan ke khilaaf gawaahi de chuki thi. Brij Bhushan abhi bhi baaki 6 mahila pehalwanon par lagataar dabav bana raha hai ki ve bhi apne case wapas lein. Kyunki use sexual harassment ki peediton ko jhukaakar dobara road show nikaalkar apni taaqat dikhane ka mann kar raha hoga.Kayi baar lagta hai ki aaj bhi kanoon raaj gundon ke saamne bauna hai [When the women wrestlers were on strike, at the same time, the minor women wrestler backed out under pressure from Brij Bhushan even though she had once testified against Brij Bhushan. Brij Bhushan is still pressurizing the remaining 6 female wrestlers to withdraw their cases. Because he might be feeling like showing his power by making the victims of sexual harassment bow down and organizing a road show again. Many times it seems that even today the law is dwarf in front of the goons],"" Bajarang further said.Vinesh also reacted and shared her views by reposting Bajarang's post on X.""Lashkar bhi tumhara hai, Sardar bhi tumhara hai, Tum jhooth ko sach likh do, akhbaar bhi tumhara hai!

'Jitesh Sharma was spectacular': Mayank Agarwal after RCB's win vs LSG

Poll Is Kohli the best player in IPL history? Absolutely! He is one of the best. Not sure, there are many greats. No, there are better players.

As Royal Challengers Bangalore created history against Lucknow Super Giants in the IPL on Tuesday night, the post-match celebrations in the RCB dressing room featured a moment that has gone viral on social media. After what was a high-octane chase against Rishabh Pant-led LSG, Kohli was approached by one of his younger teammates for a picture.In a clip posted on RCB's official X handle, the 36-year-old jokingly says on camera that Swastik Chikara has been “annoying” him. After the 20-year-old nudged Kohli for a selfie, the latter turned to the camera and said, ""Dimaag khaata rehta hai hamesha"" (he keeps annoying me). In the next frame, Chikara excitedly shows the picture that he clicked with Kohli.Kohli's cheerful jibe did not restrict the youngster from showing the picture to the camera, as he jokingly added, ""Bade bhai hai hamara. Jab mann kare, tab photo le dete hain"" (He's my elder brother. Let's me click a picture with him whenever I want to).Chikara is yet to make his IPL debut.Kohli played a part in RCB's record-breaking chase against LSG as he put up 54 in 30 balls, opening alongside Phil Salt. The Challengers confirmed a top-two spot with the win and created history.The successful 228-run chase with eight balls to spare means that Bengaluru bettered their biggest chase record. The previous record stood at 206 against Gujarat Titans.The win also means that RCB will now have a direct spot in the final if they manage to win Qualifier 1 against Punjab Kings.",Virat Kohli poked fun at Swastik Chikara after RCB pulled off a thrilling chase against Lucknow Super Giants in the IPL on Tuesday night.

Edmonton Oilers forward Zach Hyman leaves Game 4 after collision



Zach Hyman Leaves Game After Making Contact With Mason Marchment

Zach Hyman’s early exit in Game 4 of the Western Conference Final sent a jolt through Edmonton’s playoff momentum. While the Oilers secured a convincing 4-1 win over the Dallas Stars, the spotlight quickly shifted to Hyman’s injury, a moment that could have major implications for the remainder of the Stanley Cup Playoffs.Just 9:17 into the first period, Hyman was carrying the puck out of the Oilers’ defensive zone when he attempted to cut past Stars defenseman Esa Lindell. That’s when Dallas forward Mason Marchment delivered a heavy shoulder hit to Hyman’s right side. The impact sent Hyman stumbling, immediately dropping his stick before heading straight to the bench and then down the tunnel. He did not return.No penalty was assessed on the play, but the hit quickly sparked controversy. While some defended it as clean playoff contact, others pointed to Marchment’s aggressive reputation and questioned whether the hit crossed the line. Either way, the damage was done.Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch gave no definitive update postgame, saying only that Hyman would be evaluated further. His absence looms large for a team chasing its first Stanley Cup Final appearance since 2006.Hyman has been a critical piece of Edmonton’s postseason success, leading the NHL in hits (111) and tallying 11 points across 15 playoff games.Beyond the numbers, he’s been the Oilers’ heartbeat, a relentless grinder who brings energy and leadership every shift.“It’s massive,” said goaltender Stuart Skinner. “The way that we responded was fantastic. You saw a lot of guys step up, skate hard, hitting guys the way that [Hyman] has been hitting.”Also Read: Brad Marchand’s “Ice Cream” controversy: Did he really snack on a Dairy Queen Blizzard during Eastern Conference Finals? Ryan Nugent-Hopkins echoed the concern, calling Hyman “a big part of our game” and emphasizing the need for others to step up in his absence. The Oilers now lead the best-of-seven series 3-1 and head to Dallas with a chance to close it out in Game 5. But whether Hyman will be part of that mission remains to be seen and could define the remainder of Edmonton’s playoff run.","Edmonton Oilers forward Zach Hyman left Game 4 after collision with Dallas Stars' Mason Marchment.

"Aaron Rodgers throws shade at Bears, leaves Steelers hanging: Diva behavior or strategic silence?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/aaron-rodgers-throws-shade-at-bears-leaves-steelers-hanging-diva-behavior-or-strategic-silence/articleshow/121427659.cms,"Aaron Rodgers has hinted at a possible move to the Pittsburgh Steelers for the 2025 season (Getty Images)

Aaron Rodgers’ latest remarks provide a clear indication of his potential team for the 2025 season

Aaron Rodgers recently signaled his next NFL stop might be the Pittsburgh Steelers for the 2025 season. After leaving the Jets, he playfully dismissed joining the Chicago Bears, but then cryptically noted a team visiting Chicago, aligning with Pittsburgh's schedule. This fuels strong rumors of him joining the Steelers.Aaron Rodgers, the accomplished quarterback, recently provided a cryptic hint about his future in the NFL, intensifying speculation he might join the Pittsburgh Steelers for the 2025 season. This comes as the Steelers have reportedly extended an offer to Rodgers, and the franchise is eager for a decision.Rodgers' tenure with the New York Jets, which saw him contribute 28 scores through the air against 11 turnovers in a 5-12 finish, has concluded, leaving him at a crossroads regarding his next step. His off-season periods are consistently marked by dramatic flair, mirroring his past transitions from the Green Bay Packers to the Jets.His initial aspiration was to rejoin the NFC North, specifically with the Minnesota Vikings. However, with the Vikings having now solidified their quarterback position with J.J. McCarthy, Rodgers' viable paths have narrowed to either joining the Steelers, electing to sit out the season, or formally announcing his retirement.T he most telling clue emerged during an appearance at an event hosted by rapper Mike Stud. When prompted about ever playing for the Chicago Bears, a franchise he has historically dominated with a remarkable 26-5 win-loss record, Rodgers issued a definitive ""No,"" but then appended a provocative observation: ""No, but I believe there's a team that might play in Chicago this year. On a road trip. I don't know. Not sure.""A swift review of the Chicago Bears' 2025 schedule reveals that the Pittsburgh Steelers are indeed slated to visit Soldier Field in Week 12 to face off against Caleb Williams and his squad. This direct correlation strongly implies that Rodgers is on the verge of inking a deal with the Steelers.Such a contest would undoubtedly ignite a fresh chapter in Rodgers' enduring rivalry with the Bears, a team that has consistently been on the receiving end of his prolific performances. The Steelers, with Mason Rudolph currently listed as their primary quarterback, appear eager to bring in an experienced veteran to bolster their roster.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers reignites conspiracy storm, accuses Fauci and U.S. government of engineering HIV Rodgers' signal suggests a deliberate strategy by both player and team. For Pittsburgh, it indicates a commitment to a short-term, high-impact veteran presence over a full youth movement at quarterback. For Rodgers, it's a calculated move to a potentially playoff-contending team, allowing him to bypass rebuilding efforts and potentially make one last deep run, all while continuing his tradition of offseason theatrics.","Aaron Rodgers has hinted at a possible move to the Pittsburgh Steelers for the 2025 season.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

2025 highlights: Familiar faces and dramatic falls



Is it just madness or tradition





Every year on a steep hill in Gloucestershire, England, hundreds gather to chase a rolling 7-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down a dangerously steep slope. Known as the Cooper’s Hill Cheese Rolling Contest, the event is chaotic, absurd, and completely thrilling. With participants tumbling, somersaulting, and crashing their way to the bottom, the headline “People sprint to catch a 7-pound wheel of cheese” is technically accurate, but it doesn’t quite capture the madness, tradition, and injuries that define this bizarre British spectacle. So, is it a good headline? That depends on what you’re hoping to convey.The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. Dating back at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize. It sounds simple, but the event is notorious for its steep incline, dangerous tumbles, and frequent injuries.The hill is so steep that it's nearly impossible to stay upright. Most participants end up tumbling head over heels, colliding with each other or the ground.Gravity takes over quickly, and the cheese, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, is almost never actually caught. Still, competitors willingly risk sprains, fractures, and concussions for a shot at glory and a round of cheese.This year, German YouTuber Tom Kopke claimed victory for the second year in a row. Shirtless and triumphant, he declared, “I risked my life for this. It’s my cheese. Back to back.” On the women’s side, Ava Sender Logan from London tumbled repeatedly but emerged victorious, saying, “It felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head. I’m fine.” Around them, spectators packed the woods and fences for a glimpse of the chaos.While the event may seem absurd to outsiders, for locals and returning participants, it’s a point of pride and cultural identity. Despite calls to regulate or cancel it over safety concerns, the contest continues to thrive, drawing international competitors and media attention. Volunteers, medics, and long-time residents treat it as an important local tradition","The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire.

What is the trial about?





The trial of health care workers who treated late Argentine footballer Diego Maradona shortly before his death could be thrown out after a key judge stepped down Tuesday.Julieta Makintach recused herself after it was revealed that she has been taking part in a documentary about the high-profile case.The case was adjourned last week after a series of police raids which led to Makintach, 47, being accused on Tuesday of violating impartiality rules, of influence peddling and bribery over her role in the ""Divine Justice"" miniseries.In court on Tuesday, a trailer for the documentary was played which said it would follow Makintach as she ""reconstructs the death of Maradona and certain painful milestones of his life related to abandonment.""Some of the footage appeared to feature recordings allegedly made from inside the courtroom, which would be a violation of court rules.During the tense exchanges, prosecutor Patricio Ferrari accused Makintach of ""behaving like an actress and not a judge.""The two remaining judges, Maximiliano Savarino and Veronica Di Tomasso, are expected to announce on Thursday whether the trial will proceed or a if new trial will be ordered.Diego Maradona, considered one of the world's best ever players who led Argentina to World Cup glory in 1986, died in November 2020 of a cardiac arrest aged 60 while he was recovering at home from brain surgery for a blood clot.He had spent years battling cocaine and alcohol addictions.Seven members of his medical team are on trial for the alleged negligent homicide of the late soccer legend.The defendants, who all deny the charges, face between eight and 25 years in prison if found guilty.","Julieta Makintach recused herself after it was revealed that she has been taking part in a documentary about the high-profile case.

IPL 2025: What went wrong for Lucknow Super Giants?

The Indian Premier League has finally entered its playoff stage - belatedly and dramatically. After 70 matches of explosive batting, tense finishes and unprecedented off-field events, four teams are left in contention for the crown.At the heart of the league stage were two polarising narratives: the astonishing rise of 14-year-old Rajasthan Royals’ prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi, who smashed the second-fastest IPL century of all time; and the steep fall of Lucknow Super Giants’ Rs 27 crore gamble, Rishabh Pant , who failed to inspire with the bat and leadership.Adding to the chaos, the season was suspended mid-way due to armed conflict near the India-Pakistan border, raising concerns about player safety. With such a volatile mix of brilliance, heartbreak and drama, IPL 2025 delivered an unforgettable league phase.IPL 2025’s league stage belonged as much to fearless youth as it did to flailing veterans. The undisputed star was Vaibhav Suryavanshi, a 14-year-old sensation from Rajasthan Royals who smashed a 35-ball century, finishing with 252 runs from seven games.Other breakout stars included Priyansh Arya, who hammered a century for Punjab Kings, and promising knocks from Ayush Mhatre (Chennai Super Kings) and Prabhsimran Singh (PBKS), adding youthful flair to the league.In contrast, Pant, the IPL’s costliest player at Rs 27 crore, failed to justify the price tag. With just 269 runs from 14 games and questions swirling around his captaincy, Pant’s campaign ended in disappointment. Meanwhile, MS Dhoni’s mid-season return to captaincy failed to revive a sinking ship as CSK finished last for the first time in IPL history.It was a season of extremes - blistering highs on the field, jarring interruptions off it. Sunrisers Hyderabad bookended their campaign with explosive totals: 286/6 against RR and 278/3 against Kolkata Knight Riders, with Heinrich Klaasen’s unbeaten 105 sealing their final league win. But inconsistency plagued their middle stretch, and underwhelming bowling efforts kept them from finishing higher.Even bigger than cricket was the border conflict, which halted the league after shelling was reported during a PBKS vs Delhi Capitals match in Dharamsala. Air raid sirens, overnight evacuations and trains shuttling players to safety forced a pause in play. The temporary suspension led to Mitchell Starc’s early exit, citing safety concerns, marking an unprecedented moment in IPL history. Mumbai Indians made the most thrilling charge of the season. After losing four of their first five, they won six on the bounce to storm into the playoffs. Hardik Pandya’s captaincy, Suryakumar Yadav’s consistency and Jasprit Bumrah’s 17 wickets in 10 matches made the difference.Gujarat Titans were less dramatic. Anchored by Sai Sudharsan’s 679 runs - earning him an India call-up - and Shubman Gill’s steady leadership, GT sealed their playoff spot without looking rattled.Royal Challengers Bengaluru created history, becoming the first team to win all seven away matches in an IPL season. With Jitesh Sharma captaining late in the season and smashing an unbeaten 85 in a record chase of 228 against LSG, RCB head into the playoffs with unmatched momentum.Based on their track record, PBKS were this year’s overachievers. Led by Shreyas Iyer and coached by Ricky Ponting, they showcased grit, defending the lowest total of the season (111 vs KKR) and punching above their weight. Their blend of youth and discipline pushed them into the playoffs as the table-toppers.CSK endured a forgettable season. The return of Dhoni as captain couldn’t mask issues: Ravindra Jadeja and R Ashwin underperformed, while overseas picks like Hasaranga failed to deliver. Young talents like Dewald Brevis and Mhatre offered late hope, but the campaign was too far gone.RR, stripped of stars like Jos Buttler, Yuzvendra Chahal and Trent Boult, struggled to stay afloat. Injuries and inconsistency plagued them, but Suryavanshi’s emergence gave their fans a glimmer of future glory.LSG began strong but faded fast. Despite occasional brilliance from Mitchell Marsh, Nicholas Pooran and Digvesh Rathi, the team lacked depth and clarity. Pant’s underwhelming leadership and their bowling unit’s failure to deliver under pressure left them out of the top-four.KKR, the defending champions, were a shadow of their 2024 selves. Ajinkya Rahane stood tall with gritty batting, but Venkatesh Iyer’s failure and strategic confusion saw KKR slump to five losses in their first eight games - never quite recovering.DC, too, saw a steep drop. Having led the table early, they lost five of their last eight. Mitchell Starc’s exit post-Dharamsala, a misfiring middle order and the lack of a match-winning spinner derailed a campaign that had promised much more.As the playoffs begin, the narrative shifts from resurrection to redemption. Can MI’s momentum, GT’s balance or RCB’s road dominance carry them all the way? Or will PBKS, underdogs-turned-warriors, script a fairytale finish?","The Indian Premier League has entered its playoff stage.

Poll Should cricket captains always back their bowlers in controversial run-out situations? Yes, it boosts team morale and unity No, sportsmanship should take precedence

RCB vs PBKS, IPL Qualifier 1: Quick Singles from Mullanpur | Indian Premier League

WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED

IPL 2025: What went wrong for Delhi Capitals?

WHAT THE RULE SAYS

NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, who has been under scrutiny himself since the controversial run-out of Jos Buttler in IPL 2019, stood firmly in support of Lucknow Super Giants bowler Digvesh Rathi on Wednesday. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ashwin dissected the incident involving Rathi’s attempt to dismiss Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s stand-in captain Jitesh Sharma at the non-striker’s end during their IPL 2025 clash in Lucknow.""As an owner of LSG, I will be thinking that I need Jitesh Sharma's wicket. If he has stepped outside the crease, he is out. Now let me dive into the technicality of the incident. Is he justified in being out if he stepped outside the crease before Digvesh Rathi got into the delivery stride? Yes. Would it be bad for RCB? Yes, again, because they would not have liked Rathi or Pant if they did that. Now let's look into the real-case scenario. When Rathi landed his front foot, Jitesh was inside the crease. So, this was not out. After breaking the stumps, umpire Michael Gough asked him whether he was appealing, and not whether he was sure. He said, 'Yes, I'm appealing.' So the decision went to the third umpire, and the right decision was made,"" Ashwin explained.However, what happened after the decision left Ashwin furious. The cameras showed LSG skipper Rishabh Pant withdrawing the appeal and embracing Jitesh, an act the commentators hailed as a great display of sportsmanship. Ashwin strongly disagreed with that narrative.""Until now, everything was right. But after that, commentators started saying that Pant has withdrawn the appeal - what an amazing act of sportsmanship. Grow out of this. Pant is a fantastic cricketer. He scored a stunning century, and I know he will go on to do great things in cricket. I am already looking forward to the England series just to see how he will bat and help India win. I am a big fan of Pant. I'm clarifying it yet again before being targeted by people. But think, you are the father of Rathi, and his captain, in front of crores of people, criticised him. He actually went over the board. A captain's job is to back the bowler and not make himself feel small,"" Ashwin added.The incident took place in the 17th over of Rathi's spell. With Royal Challengers Bengaluru needing 29 runs off the final 19 balls, Rathi attempted to run Jitesh Sharma out at the non-striker's end.He paused before delivering the ball and removed the bails when he spotted Jitesh stepping out of his crease.Rathi went on to appeal for the dismissal. However, the third umpire, after reviewing the footage, ruled that the bowler had already completed his delivery stride and crossed the popping crease. The decision of 'not out' was flashed on the big screen. Simultaneously, LSG captain Pant also withdrew the appeal and hugged Jitesh, a moment that was widely praised as an act of sportsmanship. Nonetheless, Pant’s gesture had no bearing on the outcome, as the appeal was already invalid under the rules.According to MCC Law 38.3.1: ""At any time from the moment the ball comes into play until the instant when the bowler would normally have been expected to release the ball, the non-striker is liable to be run out...""Further clarity is provided in subsections 38.3.1.1 and 38.3.1.2, which state that the non-striker can be dismissed only until ""the moment the bowler's arm reaches the highest point of his/her normal bowling action in the delivery swing.""",Ravichandran Ashwin defends Digvesh Rathi after controversial run-out. Rathi attempted to run out Royal Challengers Bengaluru captain Jitesh Sharma. But third umpire ruled that Rathi had already completed his delivery stride. LSG skipper Rishabh Pant then withdrew the appeal and embraced Sharma. The move was hailed as an act of sportsmanship.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121467844,imgsize-44382,width-400,resizemode-4/121467844.jpg"

India Test squad vs England: Ajit Agarkar full press conference

The Indian income group is much higher compared to the average income group in the USA, so there's a spending capacity there Hemant Dua

New Delhi: Seattle Orcas CEO Hemant Dua believes USA's win over Pakistan in the 2024 T20 World Cup has played a pivotal role in helping cricket get its first foot in the door. The win helped USA cricket take a significant initial step towards achieving a goal, which, in the bigger picture, is to make the sport popular in a country where it is in unchartered territory.""Cricket has grown overall. It was always on the straps for very long here, but it was more at the amateur level in the USA. The cricket board has gone through a lot of challenges. I think off late, ICC started investing in it and seeing cricket in the USA as the frontier they want to conquer,"" Dua told TimesofIndia.com.""The 2024 World Cup came, it did really well and had a huge impact from an economic point of view. It helped cricket to a certain extent definitely because USA beating Pakistan was like a dream come true for the USA guys; it helped the growth of cricket,"" he said.Dua says with Major League Cricket (MLC) successfully entering its third season, the next goal is to get cricket into the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) so that the sport will be in the mainstream.""Largely, cricket is played by South Asians and a little bit of the Commonwealth population like the English, South Africans, and all those. It hasn't really gone into the mainstream as yet, and the challenge remains: how do you make it a growing mainstream sport, especially focused on youth and colleges,"" he said.""In the US, unlike other parts of the world, if you're not part of the college system, the sport really doesn't grow. You know, because college sport is the base of growth here for everything, right? So that's how all sports kind of grow in that direction. Once you become part of the NCAA, you grow automatically; that is how sports grow.""Ideally, this should be the next step, but it's a combination where everyone will have to come on the same platform. When I say everyone, I mean USA Cricket, MLC, Minor League Cricket, all have to come on the same platform, and one of the biggest challenges for becoming part of college sports is Title IX. Title IX means you've got to have equivalent or some form of women's cricket playing, right? Without women's sport, you don't get recognition.""In my region, which is the Pacific Northwest, there are girls playing regularly, so we're trying to grow. I mean, there are various leagues that have come up at U-19 and U-16 levels for boys and girls both. The boys' sport is growing, but it's small numbers,"" he said.With cricket finding a place at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, Dua is hopeful that most of the MLC franchises will have their own cricket stadium, and it will take cricket to the next level.""What will make a huge impact is now when all six teams will have their own stadium ready. It is part of the contract with MLC that each team will build their stadium by 2028. With the Olympics happening in 2028, there is going to be some noise where people will get to know about the sport more,"" he said.For the expansion of cricket in the USA, the franchises are also banking on targetting the Indian population.""If you look at the population, approximately 20 million South Asians live in the USA. It is a pretty significant number. Indians have the highest net worth individuals. The Indian income group is much higher compared to the average income group in the USA, so there's a spending capacity there. So can we tap into that, can we tap into that dream?"" he said.Dua, who has been part of the Delhi Daredevils (now Delhi Capitals) for ten years since the inception of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2008, admitted that all six franchises are currently making losses, but he strongly believes that the MLC as a product is sustainable in the larger scheme of things.""Everyone's making losses in the MLC now. Even in the IPL, for 10 years, everybody made losses until the 11th year broadcast contract came on the floor,"" he said.""I strongly believe that MLC is sustainable. As I said, everything depends largely on the media contracts. Right now, we are on Willow, which is a streaming platform, so we're opening up new markets. In each region, I have tied up with a regional sport network along with Willow. We've opened up with Root and Fox 13; we're going to relay our matches similarly in other regions.""These are obviously not going to help us make money, but the idea is to ensure that more people get to see the game. For the first time now, Amazon has also done a deal, so they'll broadcast the Sunday night games on Amazon. It's opening up, but I think the real test will come when the new broadcast contract comes in, and whoever takes it, whether it's Willow or whether it's another channel or whoever it is, takes up and depending on what value that generates, that will tell you in which direction we are actually moving.

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

Poll Should Priyank Panchal have been given a chance to represent Team India? Absolutely Maybe, but he had his chances No, he wasn't consistent enough

Gujarat batter Priyank Panchal 's decision to retire at 35 caught the cricket fraternity by surprise, including the state team's captain Chintan Gaja and other teammates. ""I got to know about Panchal's retirement after he revealed it on Instagram,"" said Gaja. Gujarat opener Aarya Desai similarly learnt about the decision on Instagram, admitting that the call left him surprised.""Nobody knew. We had no indication before he sent an email to the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) on the previous day in the evening. There was a sense of expectation that Panchal would play his 100th Ranji Trophy match in the upcoming season,"" said Gujarat Selection Committee chairman Kirat Damani during an exclusive interaction with TimesofIndia.com. Panchal took a leaf out of MS Dhoni's playbook, keeping his decision under wraps till the end with a quiet and unexpected announcement.The Gujarat batter bows out of the game with an impressive tally of 6,992 runs in 99 Ranji Trophy matches. Panchal finishes as the state's second-highest run-getter, scoring just 19 runs less than Parthiv Patel's tally of 7,011 runs. The 35-year-old accumulated 8,856 runs in 127 first-class matches, slamming 29 hundreds and 34 fifties, with an unbeaten 314 marking his highest score.However, even this mammoth tally of runs failed to earn Panchal a Team India debut, with the cricketer ending his career as an 'almost there' player.The batter smashed 1,310 runs during the 2016/17 Ranji Trophy season, helping Gujarat win the tournament. Panchal's performances resulted in his selection for India-A squads on multiple occasions, emerging as an impressive captain. The 35-year-old first got an opportunity with the Indian team after being picked for an away Test series against South Africa in 2021-22. Panchal was also selected for a Test series against Sri Lanka in February 2022. However, the batter didn't get a chance to feature in the lineup. It was in such tough situations that Panchal, who idolises Rahul Dravid and draws inspiration from Ricky Ponting, showcased his character.""An anecdote I recall showcasing his mentality was when Panchal missed out on a chance to replace Cheteshwar Pujara in an away series against England, due to an injury. I thought he'd be extremely gutted. Panchal said, ''I've worked very hard. If I was destined to get that chance, I would've got it'. His maturity and grit astonished me,"" said Damani.""The one thing that stood out very early was his ability to learn from seniors and eagerness to improve. Panchal would show up season after season with thorough professionalism without letting the disappointment of non-selection for the Indian team affect his mentality,"" added Damani.Panchal faced questions regarding his capabilities during the 2024/25 edition of the Ranji Trophy, which marked his last tournament. The cricketer was under pressure before the team's semi-final against Kerala, considering his lack of big runs. ""He was unable to convert starts. However, we were confident of his capabilities,"" said Gaja.Kerala scored 457 in their first innings, tiring out the Gujarat fielders by making them field for over two and a half days. Gujarat needed to cross Kerala's run tally in a game set to be decided based on the first-innings lead. Desai and Panchal stitched a 131-run partnership, putting the opposition under pressure. ""We were very tired after fielding for two and a half days. Priyank told me to keep attacking. He even cautioned me when he felt I was being too casual, urging me to not lose focus,"" said Desai.Panchal maintained the intensity following his fellow opener's dismissal, scoring with intent. The batter let out a roar after scoring a century, leaving teammates and friends stunned, considering his quiet nature. The Gujarat cricketer continued to fight despite an injury on his left index finger. ""The top hand plays a dominant role. Fingers on the left-hand are always vital for a right-handed batter,"" said Panchal.Ex-Gujarat cricketer Dhruv Raval said he's never seen his former teammate celebrate in such an aggressive manner. ""It was very unexpected. It is extremely unfortunate that one of India's best domestic players failed to represent the nation,"" he added. ""Priyank was very determined to help Gujarat reach the final. His celebration showed that there was a lot going on inside,"" stated Gaja.Panchal was eventually dismissed for 148, bowing out of the game on an astounding note. While the cricketer emerged as a solid run-scorer, he was also the ultimate teamman. ""Panchal guided me a lot with technical issues, motivating me during my initial matches. His discipline is top-notch. I will certainly remember him for that,"" said Gujarat all-rounder Jaymeet Patel.","Gujarat batter Priyank Panchal's decision to retire at 35 caught the cricket fraternity by surprise.
