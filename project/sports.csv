BJP’s hits back

NEW DELHI: Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed on late Sunday questioned the leadership of Indian men's national cricket team captain Rohit Sharma Taking to X after India's decisive victory against New Zealand in the ongoing Champions Trophy, Shama labelled Rohit ""fat"" and called him a ""mediocre captain"".""Rohit Sharma is fat for a sportsman! Needs to lose weight! And of course, the most unimpressive captain India has ever had!"" the Congress spokesperson wrote in a social media post.She went further in another post, questioning Sharma’s abilities compared to past cricketing legends. ""What is so world-class about him when compared to his predecessors like Ganguly, Tendulkar, Dravid, Dhoni, Kohli, Kapil Dev, Shastri & the rest? He is a mediocre captain as well as a mediocre player who got lucky to be the captain of India.""Following backlash over her comments, Shama defended her remarks questioning Rohit's decision to promote himself to the opening spot during India's Test match against Australia, a match that the Men in Blue ultimately lost.""Didn't he move KL Rahul to bat at number 3 at the MCG Test & put himself at number 1 which backfired totally ! Wasn't that a selfish move ? Because of that Shubam Gill was out of the XI . Didn't we lose the last World Cup which took place in Ahmedabad? I have compared him to our previous captains,"" she wrote in another post.BJP’s Shehzad Poonawalla was quick to respond, taking a dig at the Congress party's electoral failures. ""Those who have lost 90 elections under the captaincy of Rahul Gandhi are calling the captaincy of Rohit Sharma unimpressive!"" he remarked.Poonawalla also defended Sharma’s track record, referencing his recent achievements. ""I guess six ducks in Delhi and 90 election losses is impressive, but winning the T20 World Cup isn’t! Rohit has a brilliant track record as captain, by the way!""Meanwhile, on the field, India secured a crucial victory over New Zealand, winning by 44 runs to top Group A. Shreyas Iyer’s composed 79 and Varun Chakravarthy’s five-wicket haul helped India set up a semifinal clash against Australia in the Champions Trophy.","Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed questioned the leadership of Indian men's national cricket team captain Rohit Sharma.

“Wasted at the bar with pals”: Taylor Swift reportedly has a few non-negotiable rules for Travis Kelce to follow strictly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/wasted-at-the-bar-with-pals-taylor-swift-reportedly-has-a-few-non-negotiable-rules-for-travis-kelce-to-follow-strictly/articleshow/118614523.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Travis Kelce has three hard-and-fast rules in his relationship with Taylor Swift

Travis Kelce, the 35-year-old Kansas City Chiefs player, allegedly has three hard-and-fast rules in his relationship with Taylor Swift, also 35. The two, who started dating over the summer of 2023, are frequently spotted together and have both attained tremendous success in their careers—Swift as one of the world's largest music icons and Kelce as a vital member of the Chiefs. Even with their great push, the Chiefs failed to reach the Super Bowl following a 40-22 defeat to the Philadelphia Eagles on February 9.The Kansas City Chiefs superstar Travis Kelce has three hard and fast rules when it comes to his relationship with singer Taylor Swift. Dating since summer 2023, the two are regularly spotted together and are a hot topic for fans and the media. Taylor Swift is among the world's leading musicians, and Kelce is an integral part of the Chiefs, who came up short of the Super Bowl after a 40-22 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on February 9.According to the Life and Style Magazine, through MSN, Taylor Swift apparently has some 'rules' about how Kelce can stay in contact with her and whom the football player can socialize with during his free time.“They’ll be doing lots of texting and calling, too, but Taylor likes to see Travis in real time,” a source said. “She likes to know where he is and who he’s with. It’s not that she doesn’t trust him; she just wants to feel connected. Taylor loves Travis’ energy and spontaneity, but she doesn’t want him wasted at the bar with pals. He can celebrate his wins in style with her and their friends.”Being a high-level athlete, Travis Kelce probably does not have much of his free time spent in bars, considering the strenuous nature of his profession. Otherwise, when he is not training or on the field, he co-hosts the extremely popular New Heights podcast with his brother Jason Kelce, a retired NFL great. The podcast has attracted an enormous following and gives fans an inside look at football and the brothers' personal lives.The third rule in the relationship of Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift is one that is most argued about. The couple has reportedly agreed to not be seen with others of the opposite gender to avoid gossip and speculation. This ruling, though questionable, is probably a move to preserve their privacy and keep away from extra reinforcement from their respective professions.“Taylor’s been in this biz long enough to know what comes with being in the spotlight,” they added.The Chiefs star recently disclosed his relationship during an appearance on the Stephen A. Smith Show. “I’m enjoying all aspects of life,"" said Kelce. ""Me and Taylor are happy and I couldn’t be happier to enjoy that confidence off the field and all the support I could ever ask for at the stadium.""He added, “I think personally, the beauty of being in a very strong relationship is that you get that support to be able to come in and focus on your craft, focus on being the best version of you. I think I’m as focused as I’ve ever been on my job and being the best player that I could possibly be week in, week out for this team.""Also Read: “Enjoyed a quiet night”: Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift return to the spotlight following international getaway after Chiefs' Super Bowl loss","Travis Kelce, 35, and Taylor Swift, also 35, started dating over the summer of 2023.

His message was clear: the Bruins will keep fighting, improving, and building toward future success.On February 28th, Bruins insider Joe Haggerty (@HackswithHaggs) dropped the Brad Marchand quote that had fans and analysts stunned. “We may not achieve what we want to this year, but that doesn’t mean we can’t build to achieve something greater [down the line] & bring it back next year. We’re gonna work every single day to improve & we’ll claw & fight every single game to get into the playoffs.”Many fans are directing their frustrations toward General Manager Don Sweeney, questioning his recent decisions and the team's direction. ""The Boston Bruins' fans, at least 90% all day get rid of Sweeney and Neely. That would be the best move the Boston Bruins would ever make.""First up, one fan didn’t just hint at it—they practically stamped the rebuild approval themselves.“It’s over time to start over but again why is Sweeney making those decisions?”Following that, another hit landed. “Should have traded him when he still had value.” Another fan didn’t hold back, delivering a scathing critique of the whole team. “Time to let them play golf before someone else gets hurt. These guys don’t seem to play for each other. Feels very much like going through the motions.”Also Read: NHL trade rumors: Mikko Rantanen, Brock Nelson among top stars in trade talks as NHL deadline nears As the season unfolds, it’s clear that patience is wearing thin among Bruins fans.

When and where to watch the Charlotte Hornets play tonight against the Washington Wizards (March 1, 2025)?

The Charlotte Hornets face another challenging game as they prepare to host the Washington Wizards on Saturday, March 1, at the Spectrum Center. However, all eyes are on star guard LaMelo Ball, who is listed as questionable due to an ankle injury. His potential absence could significantly impact the Hornets’ already struggling season. LaMelo Ball might be absent from tonight’s game. There is a lot of uncertainty as he is listed as GTD on the team’s injury report. LaMelo Ball, who leads the team with an average of 26.3 points per game, has been a bright spot in an otherwise disappointing campaign for Charlotte. His ability to score and create opportunities for teammates has been crucial, but his lingering ankle issue has raised concerns. The Hornets are already without key players like Grant Williams (ACL), Brandon Miller (wrist), and Tre Mann (back), all ruled out for the season.The Hornets’ injury report also includes Jusuf Nurkic (illness) and Tidjane Salaun (ankle), both listed as questionable. With so many players sidelined, the team has struggled to find consistency, currently sitting at 14-44. Their offensive output ranks 28th in the NBA, averaging just 105.2 points per game, while their defense allows 112.8 points, ranking 13th.Ball’s recent performances have been limited, averaging only 7.6 points, 2.0 rebounds, and 2.7 assists over the last 20 games. His absence or limited availability could further hinder the Hornets’ chances against the Wizards, who are also dealing with their own injury woes. Washington Wizards ' injury report includes Alex Sarr (ankle) as questionable, while Jordan Poole (elbow), Malcolm Brogdon (ankle), and Saddiq Bey (knee) are out. Despite their 10-48 record, the Wizards have shown flashes of competitiveness, led by Bilal Coulibaly, who averages a team-high 12.5 points per game.The game tips off at 6 p.m. ET and will be broadcast on FDSSE and MNMT. Fans can also stream the matchup on Fubo, though regional restrictions may apply.As the Hornets navigate a season marred by injuries, Ball’s status remains a critical factor. His presence on the court could provide a much-needed spark, but his absence would leave the team even more vulnerable. With both teams battling injuries and poor records, Saturday’s game could come down to which squad can overcome adversity and capitalize on limited opportunities.For now, Hornets fans will anxiously await updates on Ball’s condition, hoping their star guard can suit up and help turn the tide in what has been a difficult year for Charlotte basketball.","The Charlotte Hornets host the Washington Wizards on Saturday, March 1, at the Spectrum Center.

When and where to watch the Golden State Warriors play tonight against the Philadelphia 76ers (March 1, 2025)

The Philadelphia 76ers are set to host the Golden State Warriors on Saturday, March 1, at the Wells Fargo Center, but all eyes are on Jimmy Butler’s questionable status due to a back injury. The Warriors’ star forward, a key player in their lineup, could be a game-time decision, leaving fans and analysts speculating about his availability for the crucial matchup. Jimmy Butler ’s potential absence would be a significant blow to the Warriors, who are already dealing with the loss of Jonathan Kuminga, ruled out with an ankle injury. Butler has been instrumental in Golden State’s recent performances, contributing both offensively and defensively. His absence could shift the dynamics of the game, especially against a struggling 76ers team missing several key players, including Joel Embiid and Kyle Lowry.The Warriors, currently 15th in the league with an average of 112.9 points per game, rely heavily on Jimmy Butler’s versatility. Alongside Stephen Curry , who leads the team with 24.0 points per game, Butler’s presence on the court has been pivotal in maintaining their playoff push. If he sits out, the Warriors will need players like Moses Moody and Buddy Hield to step up and fill the void.On the other side, the 76ers are grappling with their own injury woes. Tyrese Maxey has been carrying the load, averaging 27.2 points per game, but the team’s lack of depth has been evident. With a -265 scoring differential, Philadelphia’s struggles could worsen if Butler suits up for the Warriors.As the game approaches, the focus remains on Butler’s status. Warriors head coach Steve Kerr has yet to confirm whether Butler will play, stating only that he is “questionable” for the game. Fans will have to wait until tip-off at 8:30 p.m. ET to know for sure.For those looking to catch the action, the game will be broadcast on ABC and ESPN+, with live streaming available on Fubo.

The Mavericks, meanwhile, have five players on their injury report, including key absences like Anthony Davis (groin) and Daniel Gafford (knee). Giannis Antetokounmpo ’s status as probable is a relief for Bucks fans, as the two-time MVP remains critical to Milwaukee’s success.

His presence on the court is vital, especially against a Mavericks team led by Kyrie Irving, who averages 24.9 points per game.Joining Giannis on the Bucks’ injury report is Damian Lillard, who is also probable with a hamstring issue. Lillard has been a key contributor, averaging 22.4 points and 6.3 assists over the last 20 games. However, Pat Connaughton will miss the game due to a calf injury, leaving a gap in Milwaukee’s rotation.The Mavericks’ injury woes are more severe, with four players ruled out and P.J. Washington listed as questionable with an ankle injury. Dallas will rely heavily on Irving and Klay Thompson, who leads the team with 3.1 made three-pointers per game.Milwaukee enters the game with a 33-25 record, outscoring opponents by 1.7 points per game.

Rob Gronkowski sarcastically suggested that Tom Brady might have snubbed him due to his age



Gronk & Jules Craft the ULTIMATE NFL Offense | Dudes on Dudes

Tom Brady's inaugural offseason as a Las Vegas Raiders minority owner is already busy, with him having had a hand in bringing in Pete Carroll as head coach and reportedly sitting down with Matthew Stafford regarding the quarterback role. One individual who hasn't received a call from him, though, is former teammate Rob Gronkowski, who isn't pleased about the lack of communication.There were rumors recently that Gronkowski was training for an eventual NFL return, but he shot them down on Dudes on Dudes. Even so, he couldn't help but wonder why Brady, his long-time quarterback and four-time Super Bowl champion teammate, never called, even as a courtesy.Tom Brady, the first minority owner at the Las Vegas Raiders, is in the midst of hiring Pete Carroll as head coach and meeting with Matthew Stafford for a quarterback role. However, former teammate Rob Gronkowski has not heard from him, and the former tight end is unhappy about this development.Rumors circulated in the NFL that Gronkowski had a potential comeback in mind, but the former tight end denied these claims on Dudes on Dudes. He wonders why his former quarterback, with whom he won four Super Bowls, didn't even give him a call as a courtesy.Rob Gronkowski sarcastically suggested Brady might have snubbed him due to his age, expressing disappointment that the GOAT. “Nope, Tom did not hit me up. I’m pretty disappointed because Tom is now a team owner, and he’s not even hitting me up. He doesn’t even want me as a player anymore! That must mean he’s looking at me like I’m washed,” said Gronk.Gronkowski admitted that if Brady had approached him about playing for the Raiders, he would have accepted it wholeheartedly. “But if he did hit me up, I would listen to his pitch. I would, Jules, maybe take it into consideration,” he told Julian Edelman.Edelman suggested Gronk could return to the NFL if the stars aligned, suggesting he join the Los Angeles Chargers instead. This would keep Gronk near the Nut House and place him on a playoff-caliber team led by Justin Herbert and Jim Harbaugh, as suggested by his co-host. Surprisingly enough, Gronk was so intrigued by the idea that he started to explain how well he would fit in Harbaugh’s system.“That’d be a great offense for me as well because my game contributes in the blocking world too. That’s what gets me open — play-action. And Justin Herbert needs that tight end for those play-action routes to just dump it right over the middle. They want to run the ball, they want to establish the run. And I’m not a guy that can go out there for 30-40 passes anymore these days, Jules. So, the Chargers would be a good possibility,” said Gronk.Also Read: FOX Sports NFL insider has questioned the reported sit-down between Tom Brady and Matthew Stafford, indicating it was not a coincidence If Rob Gronkowski ever decides to return to the NFL, he’d be more likely to join the Chargers than the Raiders. One key reason is that Las Vegas already has standout tight end Brock Bowers, whom Gronk praised as a “savage.” With Julian Edelman and Gronk making a strong case for a move to Los Angeles, the idea of him suiting up for the Chargers doesn’t seem far-fetched.","Tom Brady is the first minority owner at the Las Vegas Raiders.

Travis Hunter reveals a third position in the NFL he could play

Travis Hunter SHUTS DOWN RUMORS on NFL Combine 🚨 | The Travis Hunter Show Ep. 26

Travis Hunter's NFL position is a highly debated topic, with opinions from former general managers, players, and analysts being widely split on what is best for his outlook. Hunter's future franchise's future will be largely determined by his role as a wide receiver or cornerback. He recently discussed his ability to handle a third position and expressed his desire to take full control of his offense if possible.Travis Hunter, a Colorado Buffaloes standout, has demonstrated his versatility as a cornerback and wide receiver at collegiate level, adding an additional dimension to his game as speculation about his NFL future continues.Hunter stated at the 2025 NFL Combine that he can perform anywhere on the field, adding to his draft stock's excitement as teams consider where Hunter should line up in the pros. “I’d play quarterback. I could throw the ball, actually, so I’ll play quarterback. I could be a QB,” Hunter said on his podcast.Shedeur Sanders probably didn't know how much better his career in college could have gone if Travis Hunter had played quarterback. Rather than being competitors for the same position, the two ended up as teammates, each ratcheting up the other's visibility in advance of the NFL Draft. This alliance certainly benefited far more than any possible situation in which Sanders and Hunter would have been competitors for the starting spot.Previously, reports emerged indicating Hunter would be listed as a cornerback at the 2025 NFL Scouting Combine. This sparked renewed arguments regarding whether it's possible for him to play on both offense and defense full time in the pros. Yet, Hunter still feels certain about his versatility. At Combine interviews, he indicated that coaches have asked him about being able to play both spots, and he strongly feels he can do both spots justice at the next level.During his own show, Hunter announced that he will be participating in drills as both a wide receiver and a cornerback at the Scouting Combine. Despite widespread speculation to the contrary, he chose not to correct the misinformation, letting the buzz continue. He said, “If they actually look at the list, I’m on receiver and I’m on DB… but I’m not [gonna] fight with the internet.”Also Read: “A father figure”: Travis Hunter acknowledges the pivotal role Deion Sanders played in his development, terming him a guiding light Recent mock drafts regularly have Travis Hunter no lower than sixth overall, where he would fall to the Las Vegas Raiders. But most regularly projected is for him to go to the New York Giants at No. 3. Whatever position he goes as a wide receiver, defensive back, or both, Hunter won't be waiting long to hear his name called on draft night.","Colorado Buffaloes wide receiver Travis Hunter says he could play quarterback in the NFL.

Champions Trophy: Rohit Sharma back to his belligerent best in final training session

England’s final blow in the tournament

Can India overcome New Zealand in the ICC Champions Trophy?

India vs New Zealand

: A high-stakes final group clash

The Champions Trophy semi-final picture is almost complete, with South Africa sealing their spot on Saturday with a commanding seven-wicket win over England in Karachi. Wiaan Mulder (3-25) and Marco Jansen (3-39) dismantled England's batting lineup, bundling them out for a meager 179 in 38.2 overs. South Africa then chased the target comfortably, losing just three wickets in 29.1 overs.This victory secured South Africa's place at the top of Group B with five points, one ahead of Australia, meaning both teams progressed to the semi-finals. Meanwhile, from Group A, India and New Zealand have already qualified, with their final group match on Sunday set to determine the semi-final fixtures.For England, the tournament has been a disaster, suffering three defeats — including losses to Australia and Afghanistan — before their elimination was confirmed with a game to spare. Adding to their woes, Jos Buttler stepped down as captain following their exit.The final group-stage encounter between India and New Zealand will determine the final semi-final pairings. The first semi-final is scheduled for Dubai on March 4, while the second will take place in Lahore on March 5.Due to political tensions, India have played all their matches in Dubai and will continue to do so in the semi-finals, regardless of their group position. If India reach the final, it will be held in Dubai on March 9; otherwise, Lahore will host the title decider.Fast bowler Jofra Archer provided an early spark for England, dismissing Tristan Stubbs (0) and Ryan Rickelton (27) at 47/2. However, a match-winning 127-run stand between Rassie van der Dussen and Heinrich Klaasen sealed England’s fate. Klaasen struck 64 off 56 balls before falling to Adil Rashid, while van der Dussen remained unbeaten on 72. David Miller finished the game in style with a six.Earlier, Mulder and Jansen ripped through England’s top order, with spinner Keshav Maharaj (2-35) adding to their struggles. Joe Root top-scored for England with 37, highlighting their disappointing campaign.A seemingly invincible India will look to fine-tune their game against spin and test their bench strength when they face New Zealand in their last group match on Sunday. A win would secure them the top spot in Group A, though their semi-final opposition — either Australia or South Africa — will be tough regardless.Indian batters have struggled against spin in the tournament so far, adopting a cautious approach against Bangladesh’s Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Rishad Hossain, as well as Pakistan’s Abrar Ahmed. However, against New Zealand, they will face even trickier opposition in Mitchell Santner and Michael Bracewell, who have been in fine form on the slow Dubai surface.With 20 overs of high-quality spin expected from Santner, Bracewell and Glenn Phillips, the Indian batting lineup — led by Rohit Sharma , Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli , Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul — will face a crucial test before the knockouts. The Indian team still has fresh memories of their 0-3 Test series defeat to New Zealand last year, where Santner and Phillips played a pivotal role.Beyond this match, the slowing nature of the Dubai pitch will be a key factor as the tournament heads into the knockout stage, making spin an even bigger weapon in the semi-finals and final.","South Africa sealed their place in the semi-finals with a seven-wicket win over England in Karachi on Saturday.

Fernando Alonso Optimistic About Aston Martin’s Progress Ahead of 2024 Season



With the Formula 1 season opener in Australia fast approaching, Fernando Alonso has expressed confidence in Aston Martin ’s latest challenger, stating that the team has taken a “step forward” from their 2024 predecessor. The two-time World Champion remains eager to assess the true potential of the AMR25 when the lights go out in Melbourne.Aston Martin faced an eventful pre-season testing session in Bahrain, with Alonso stepping in for an unwell Lance Stroll on the final day. Despite some early challenges, the team managed to gather crucial data. While Stroll initially returned for the afternoon session, he completed just 34 laps before handing the car back to Alonso, who racked up 82 laps on Friday alone.Reflecting on the limited pre-season running, Alonso acknowledged the constraints of testing. “Short! It’s already very short with a normal programme because it’s only one and a half days before the World Championship – very unique [to] this sport in that regard,” he remarked.

Joel Embiid to miss rest of NBA season due to his knee injury

The Philadelphia 76ers have announced that their star player, Joel Embiid, will miss the rest of the season due to a knee injury that has been bothering him for a long time. NBA legend Dwight Howard quickly shared his thoughts on the injury on social media. Embiid, one of the best players in the NBA, finished this season with strong numbers 23.8 points, 8.2 rebounds, and 4.5 assists per game in just 19 games. This news has surprised many fans and started a big debate among former players and sports experts.David Howard also pointed out that Embiid had already missed two full seasons before he even started his NBA career. Howard’s strong words have gotten a lot of attention, with fans sharing mixed reactions. Some are worried about Embiid’s long-term health, while others wonder if he might miss more games—or even the entire next season.Without Embiid, the 76ers are in a tough spot. They are currently in 12th place in the standings, three games behind the Chicago Bulls for a chance to make the play-in tournament. Losing Embiid’s talent and leadership has left a big hole in the team. While players like Paul George and Tyrese Maxey are trying their best, it’s clear the team is struggling without their star player.Paul George, who recently decided to take a break from his podcast to focus on his physical and mental health, admitted that the season hasn’t gone as planned. He hopes the team can still improve by focusing on recovery and teamwork. However, without Embiid, the chances of making a deep playoff run or competing for a championship are much lower.Also read: LeBron James Teams Up with Steph Curry and Kevin Durant in a heartfelt call to protect Basketball This situation has forced the 76ers and their fans to rethink their plans for the future. The team might need to add new players or change their style of play to make up for Embiid’s absence. While there is hope that Embiid and Paul George can recover fully, the 76ers are facing a tough and uncertain road ahead. Fans will have to wait and see how the team adjusts to this big challenge.","Joel Embiid to miss rest of NBA season due to his knee injury.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.
