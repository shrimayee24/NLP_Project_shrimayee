EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup? Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'

Poll Who do you think had the upper hand in the rivalry between Irfan Pathan and Shahid Afridi? Irfan Pathan Shahid Afridi It was evenly matched Not sure

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria has stirred fresh controversy by backing Irfan Pathan ’s explosive revelations about his long-standing rivalry with Shahid Afridi , calling out the former Pakistan captain for resorting to personal attacks.Pathan, who enjoyed considerable success against Pakistan — with 67 wickets and 807 runs in Indo-Pak clashes — dismissed Afridi 11 times across formats, including a golden duck in the 2007 T20 World Cup final. Speaking to Lallantop, the former India all-rounder recalled how the rivalry turned bitter after Afridi mocked his identity in an interview.“Afridi had said, ‘I am the real Pathan, he is a fake Pathan’. Badtameez aadmi hai. Mujhe laga ki aap sirf mere baare mein nahi bol rahe ho, mere walid ke baare mein bhi baat kar rahe,” Pathan revealed. “So whenever I had the ball in hand, I made sure I dismissed him. I have shown him 11 times who the real Pathan is — in big moments, in series deciders, and in the World Cup final.”Kaneria, Afridi’s former teammate, echoed Pathan’s claims in a scathing social media post. “Irfan @IrfanPathan bhai, you’re absolutely right.He always resorts to personal attacks — be it on someone’s family or their religion. Class and decency clearly aren’t his strengths,” Kaneria wrote while sharing the interview clip.Pathan also recalled off-field flashpoints, including a fiery mid-air spat during India’s 2006 tour of Pakistan. “Afridi came and placed his hand on my head, messing up my hair. He asked me, ‘How are you kid?’ I said, ‘Since when have you become my father?’… Later, I told him, ‘He has eaten dog meat, he has been barking for a long time.’ After that, he couldn’t reply.”For Pathan, Afridi’s taunts only served as fuel. “On the field, my performances were the perfect answer. I showed him who the real Pathan is.”Kaneria’s intervention has reignited an already fiery debate, bringing back to spotlight one of cricket’s most infamous rivalries.","Former Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria has backed Irfan Pathan's claims about his rivalry with Shahid Afridi.

NFL underdog Tyson Bagent shocks Chicago as the Bears suddenly boast the league's best quarterback duo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-underdog-tyson-bagent-shocks-chicago-as-the-bears-suddenly-boast-the-leagues-best-quarterback-duo/articleshow/123365228.cms,"Tyson Bagent turns preseason into statement night (Image credits: IG/X)

From small-school shepherd roots to stealing the show in Chicago

How Tyson Bagent made Ben Johnson’s new offense look effortless

From internet cult hero to Chicago’s most unexpected quarterback threat

What Tyson Bagent’s rise really means for the Bears’ future and the NFL

The Chicago Bears’ 38–0 preseason demolition of the Buffalo Bills was expected to be Caleb Williams’ coronation at Soldier Field. Instead, Tyson Bagent—the undrafted quarterback from Shepherd University—delivered 205 yards and a touchdown, turning a routine exhibition into a reminder that Chicago may have the NFL’s most intriguing quarterback depth.Two years ago, Bagent was an unknown rookie fighting for a roster spot. On Saturday, he ran Chicago’s offense with precision, extending drives and punishing Buffalo’s defense. His performance wasn’t just impressive—it was proof that small-school pedigree doesn’t limit NFL potential. In a sport obsessed with draft status, Bagent continues to rewrite the script.What separated Bagent was how comfortably he worked inside Ben Johnson’s new system. Quick reads, crisp timing, and fearless throws downfield kept the offense flowing. “He’s confident, he’s decisive, and he makes the offense click,” Johnson said. The trust from a first-year head coach signals that Bagent is more than an understudy—he’s a reliable driver of this scheme.Bagent’s value extends beyond preseason box scores. In a league where losing a starter can sink an entire season, the Bears have security others envy.“With Tyson, we know we’re in good hands if his number gets called,” receiver Olamide Zaccheaus said. That kind of assurance makes him one of the most valuable No. 2 quarterbacks in football.Last season, “Bagent Mania” felt like a quirky fan movement celebrating an underdog. Against Buffalo, it transformed into something more serious. His composure and accuracy suggest staying power, and that could spark debates about how central he might become to Chicago’s long-term plans. He is no longer just a novelty act; he is a problem defenses must prepare for.Preseason often gets dismissed as a tune-up, but for Bagent it feels like a turning point. His poise and production have made him one of the most intriguing storylines of August. For the Bears, it’s a luxury dilemma: Williams may be the franchise face, but Bagent has shown the spotlight in Chicago can’t belong to just one quarterback, reminding fans that competition breeds confidence and depth, and that even in exhibition football, moments like these can redefine careers and reshape a team's long-term vision.Suddenly, Chicago isn't watching a backup complete-they're watching a story of grit and belief unfold under the bright preseason lights.Also read: Joe Milton’s inaccuracy is silently wrecking Dallas Cowboys receivers’ roster chances","Tyson Bagent was an unknown rookie fighting for a roster spot two years ago.

After celebrating the pinnacle of his NHL career by hoisting the Stanley Cup with the Florida Panthers in 2024, Brandon Montour has set his sights on another dream. This time, the prize isn’t a league trophy but the honor of wearing the Maple Leaf on the world’s biggest stage. Left out of the 4 Nations roster earlier this year, Montour is determined to fight his way into Team Canada’s lineup for the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano.The NHL season hasn’t even begun, yet anticipation is already building around Olympic hockey. For Canadian players, the Games carry unmatched prestige. With a roster so stacked in every position, only the absolute elite secure their names on the team sheet. That reality fuels Brandon Montour’s hunger.Canada has already announced its first six names: Sidney Crosby, Connor McDavid, Cale Makar, Nathan MacKinnon, Sam Reinhart, and Brayden Point. It’s a lineup that leaves little margin for others to break in, but Montour knows his window of opportunity lies in proving his worth on the ice.“I felt like I had the opportunity of making the 4 Nations team; unfortunately, it was not to be,” Montour told NHL.com. “At the same time, I think, for any hockey fan, it’s cool to kind of see the high end, you know, elite of the elite playing.It gives you the kind of thirst to feel like you could be a part of that.”That hunger is more than talk. Despite Seattle’s struggles last season, Montour showcased his consistency at the 2025 IIHF World Championship, tallying nine points. His performance didn’t go unnoticed, earning him a call-up to Team Canada’s Olympic orientation camp in Calgary this August.At 31, Brandon Montour knows that opportunities to represent Canada at the Olympics don’t come often. The blueline competition will be fierce, but he has shown both resilience and growth in recent years. “It was nice to get that,” Montour admitted about the camp invite. “I think I played well at the Worlds and, I mean, I think at this point people know what I bring. But to be recognized, it’s very cool.”From the heartbreak of being left out to the thrill of a new chance, Brandon Montour’s Olympic chase is a story of grit.

Doug Gilmour was called the “Killer” not for his altercation with Tomas Sandstrom, but for having a resemblance to that of serial killer, Charlie Manson. The ice hockey center played for seven NHL teams, but the Toronto Maple Leafs seem to be his favorite team! Why do we say that? The answer is in the headline! On August 19, Doug Gilmour shared a tweet on X: “One of the biggest days in my hockey career and one of the greatest honours 31 years ago today. 💙 #leafsforever #goleafsgo #ripburnsy,” with the 31-year-old image of Pat Burns, the then head coach of the Maple Leafs handing over the jersey to him.Reacting to this nostalgic moment shared by Doug Gilmour, fans went back in time and reminisced about the center’s playing days. One fan recalled the exact day when Gilmour was named franchise captain, “One of the best days in Leafs history for many of us fans.”Another compared him to the recent Maple Leafs players, “You were an amazing Captain for the Leafs. Pure grit & heart, something the Leafs have been sorely lacking.” A third fan wanted to relive those days, “It was the beginning of a great run for the Leafs and us fans, Killer! Wish we could do it all over again!”One fan said that Gilmour came to Toronto when they needed him the most, “Maple Leafs were a team searching for identity. What they got with Gilmour was a warrior, a leader, a legend. Forever my favorite Captain. 🐐.” Another enjoyed watching him play, “That was the most fun I ever had watching hockey. #killer.”Another fan thanked the captain, saying, “It was a great time to be a Leaf fan. Thanks for the memories Killer.” A third fan mentioned the 1993 Stanley Cup playoffs between the Los Angeles Kings and the Toronto Maple Leafs, “as a kid I have learned hockey by watching the epic series LA vs Toronto in 93.You were amazing! Best Leafs playoff of my lifetime.”But a fourth fan mentioned a heartbreaking fact, “Except you let Wayne Gretzky and his LA Kings get to you in 93 and that's what destroyed the Leafs back then.” What was the incident? What really happened between Doug Gilmour and The Great One? Let’s find out.In Game 6 of the 1993 playoffs, the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Los Angeles Kings had tied 4-4. In the first minute of overtime, the LA Kings’ ice hockey center Wayne Gretzky high-sticked the Maple Leafs' ice hockey center Doug Gilmour, causing Gilmour to fall to the ground after Gretzky had shot the puck.TSN Hockey Analyst Jeff O’Neil reached out to the then-NHL referee Mike Fraser and Doug Gilmour regarding this incident in 2017.The NHL referee at the time, Kerry Fraser, asked Gilmour about the incident. The center said at the time, “Gretz took a shot and his follow-through hit me in the chin.” The referee replied to him, “Well, if that’s the case, the follow-through of a shot is not a penalty.”Fraser noted his suspicion at the time, “But something just didn’t add up. Wayne Gretzky was always a guy who would be there pleading his case. He kinda moved off to the sidewalk. He wasn’t there to try and make sure there wasn’t anything going against him.”Fraser later reflected on the incident and confessed, “It was a reach, then clip. It was not a follow-through shot. It was a missed call.”With ten seconds left on the clock in Game 6, Gretzky scored an overtime goal and eliminated Doug’s team from the 1993 playoffs. However, Gilmore had an excellent 1992-1993 season, winning many accolades–1993 All-Star Game, NHL’s top defensive forward, and Frank J. Selke Trophy. The following season, he was named franchise captain! To this day, Gilmour celebrates the anniversary of being named franchise captain–31 years since that glory.","Doug Gilmour was named captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs 31 years ago.

Poll What are your thoughts on Yuzvendra Chahal's choice of attire at the divorce hearing? Inappropriate and disrespectful A bold statement Completely fine, it's his choice I have no opinion on it

Yuzvendra Chahal's estranged wife, Dhanashree Verma, has finally spoken about her divorce and slammed the Indian cricketer for his attire at the divorce hearing.Chahal appeared wearing a black t-shirt with the words “Be your own sugar daddy”. The move triggered a storm on social media, with many interpreting it as a subtle dig at Dhanashree.“Divorce is not something to celebrate. It’s not a celebration; it’s something very sad and deeply emotional. People must not forget that it’s not just about the two individuals, but also about the families involved—those who genuinely love and care about you,” she said on the podcast Spill The Tea.“I also believe true grief and chaos in a marriage have to be understood and acknowledged by both parties. Marriage begins with love, but when it ends, it often ends in distrust. The day it actually happened was very emotional for me, my family, and I’m sure for everyone around us. Even though we were mentally prepared for it, when the verdict was about to be given, I broke down completely. I started howling in front of everyone,” she recalled.Dhanashree strongly criticised Chahal’s choice of t-shirt on the divorce hearing.“He walked out first, and that whole t-shirt episode unfolded. I wasn’t even aware of it at the time because I was still inside. I left through the back door because I didn’t want to face the media. I was just wearing a simple t-shirt and jeans.“I sat in my car, still trying to catch my breath. Before I even realised what had happened, people began speculating about me because of that stunt. Sitting there, I felt like, ‘It’s done. It’s dusted.’“Somewhere, I did feel bad. Why was I even crying about this? Then I thought, forget it—let’s just end this. That moment gave me the motivation to laugh and move on. It’s over,” she added.","Yuzvendra Chahal appeared wearing a black t-shirt with the words “Be your own sugar daddy’ The move triggered a storm on social media, with many interpreting it as a subtle dig at Dhanashree. “Divorce is not something to celebrate; it’s something very sad and deeply emotional,” she said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123398560,imgsize-53994,width-400,resizemode-4/123398560.jpg"

The thing is, you have got to have passion. Now Tom! Tom needs the money. So Tom has to keep doing this, right? So he can't quit. It's as simple as that.”

Tom Brady comes clean on his financial limitations despite his lofty net worth

Also read:

Tom Brady is not just living up to his past glory through a giant bronze statue; he continues to expand his legacy. It’s no longer a secret that the former New England Patriots legend is trying his hand at a broadcasting career with Fox Sports, one of the most elite booths in the global sports realm. After struggling in his first year, the former quarterback is slowly and aptly adapting to the new role he undertook this offseason. Fans went mad at him last season as Brady’s delivery didn’t widely cover the players’ criticism, and a proper analysis of the games as they played out. But the one person who had his back throughout without fail is AI Michaels. But being a staunch supporter doesn’t deny you the right to some occasional digs, right?Michaels, 80, initially offered a high-octane review of the newcomer in the booth. While there was a flood of criticism from the fans worldwide, the veteran legendary commentator dubbed Brady’s performance terrific. Brady started off as the NFL analyst alongside play-by-play voice Kevin Burkhardt. Michales assumed back then, “The time has passed. The once-rookie is now one year old in the business and stepped into the second year of his massive, historical, $375 million 10-year contract. Michales, in a lighthearted interview, shared his stance about Brady and his highly discussed salary for Fox Sports.Is this really a small dig or something deeper along the line? Well, Fox Sports pays Tom handsomely, no doubt in that. The multi-time Super Bowl MVP has earned a total of approximately $332 million during his on-field career, which is still lower than his broadcasting contract price.So, you'd better do the math.Tom is widely celebrated for more than one talent. He an exceptional skills in the field, a magnetic personality, visionary leadership, and a sharp mouth to call the games. With numerous records like the most career passing touchdowns, passing yards, and Super Bowl MVP awards under his belt, he absolutely deserves the honors and awards, and most notably the net worth of $300 million.But the money graph doesn’t imply his he is doing pretty smooth financially. Yes, it’s nearly impossible to even think of Brady as a man struggling to get hold of his expenses. But sometimes, the GOAT can also feel some unexpected twists and turns in his path. In a playful, candid chat with Rob Gronkowski at the start of this year, Brady admitted that he fell short of cash sometimes. Although the conversation seems to be fun, the subtle hint of a financial crunch caught fans off guard. The athlete holds countless media deals, business ventures, endorsements, so to speak, but once a wise man said, Don’t judge a man’s pocket by his earnings, but by his spending. So, Tom gasping for a little bit more money isn’t far-fetched at all.","AI Michaels pokes Tom Brady's Fox NFL salary as he enters his second season in the booth.

Zac Taylor wants one more win for the Cincinnati Bengals to end the preseason with a winning record

Cincinnati Bengals’ newest wide receiver, Mitchell Tinsley, has been making internet rounds ever since his breakout performance against his former team, the Washington Commanders. The 25-year-old wideout was signed by Washington in May 2023, but was waived in August 2024. Eventually, he joined their practice squad. The Cincinnati Bengals signed Tinsley only in February 2025. What happened next? He played against the Commanders and emerged as a knight in shining armor for the Bengals! Cincinnati’s head coach Zac Taylor certainly looked surprised, calling the wide receiver a “baller” and someone who “just works hard.”Mitchell Tinsley’s breath-stopping catches shocked everyone! But in particular, to add insult to injury, they might have stunned(likely stung!) his former team! Addressing the worldwide awe, Zac Taylor praised his newest wideout at a post-game conference, “Baller. Yeah, he just works hard. He’s become a guy that everybody really respects in the locker room. I don’t know that I’ve ever heard him speak. Maybe someone can get him tonight.He just goes out there and just works. And we respect that.He created the opportunities for himself. He’s done enough in practice to where we wanted to put him in positions to be at the point of attack when he was in the game there, and he rewarded himself with touchdowns and catches and extending drives, and someone that’s reliable for the quarterbacks in August.So just proud of him. This is the last team he was with, if I’m not mistaken, so probably a neat situation for him to come back on this field and do what he just did.”After the thrilling first NFL preseason game win, when Zac Taylor entered the tired, wounded, and extremely elated locker room, he said, “Okay, hey. Congrats on the win. It feels good to get it done. You guys worked hard for it. Defense, what I love, man–I know in the second half, you guys were tired. Okay, but you found ways with the 14-point lead to keep them out of the end zone–okay. Big stop. Big stop at the end. Gave the offense the ball back even though we didn’t score as much second half offense. I love the way we control the ball. Ate up the clock. Moved it.There’s some things we can improve, but overall, that’s a great team win. A lot to learn from. Let’s keep building on that. Let’s get one more. End the preseason with a winning record. Have some momentum going in the regular season. Okay. Ted Karras, go ahead and educate everybody on what happens next. Where are you at, Ted?”The 32-year-old center for the Cincinnati Bengals, Ted Karras, echoed, “Who Dey? Who Dey? Who Dey think gonna beat them Bengals? Who Dey? Who Dey?

Micah Parsons and Dallas Cowboys face looming divorce amid contract dispute

🚨 Adam Schefter Expects Micah Parsons DIVORCE From Cowboys + ESPN On Trevon Diggs & Roster Moves

Jerry Jones’ drama tactics fuel Micah Parsons contract standoff, future in Dallas uncertain

What’s next for Micah Parsons and Cowboys

The contract standoff between Dallas Cowboys star linebacker Micah Parsons and the team shows no signs of resolution, raising questions about the linebacker’s future in Dallas. NFL insider Adam Schefter has suggested the two sides may be headed for a “divorce,” signaling a potential split that could shake up the NFL landscape.Parsons, who has emerged as one of the NFL’s top defensive talents, has yet to return to the negotiating table. Schefter told Unsportsmanlike, “Could a deal happen? Yes… there is zero indication that it is going to happen. It sounds like, at some point in time, whether that’s now, after the season, after two seasons, like the two sides are headed towards a divorce.” He added, “Today I feel comfortable saying I don’t think he’ll finish his career in Dallas. ”While a record-setting deal remains possible, the lack of progress has left fans and analysts wondering if this season could be Parsons’ last in Dallas. The situation has reportedly become personal, complicating negotiations, as Parsons has shown no effort to return to the bargaining table.Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, known for his flair for drama, may have intensified the standoff.Schefter described the unfolding events as a “circus,” noting that Dallas has a long history of high-profile player disputes. While Jones enjoys creating media attention, this time the tension with Parsons could have long-term implications for the team’s defense.Despite the standoff, a deal remains possible. Schefter added, “for all I know the two sides decide to sit down at the bargaining table and they hammer out a deal that makes Micah the highest paid non quarterback in NFL history.” But with both parties standing firm, the outlook appears uncertain.If no agreement is reached during this NFL season, the divorce between Parsons and the Cowboys could become inevitable. Parsons’ on-field performance, combined with the Cowboys’ negotiation strategy, will determine whether he remains in Dallas or seeks a fresh start elsewhere. For now, NFL fans and analysts are watching closely as this high-stakes contract drama continues to unfold.Also Read: Anthony Richardson’s injury setback leads Colts to turn to Daniel Jones for 2025 season opener The Micah Parsons contract saga promises more headlines, more drama, and possibly a seismic shift in the NFL if the “divorce” becomes reality.","The contract standoff between Dallas Cowboys star linebacker Micah Parsons and the team shows no signs of resolution.

Brief Insight into Sophie’s Current Season

The’s 2025 WNBA campaign took another devastating hit on August 19 when the team confirmed that veteran guardwill miss the rest of the season with a right knee injury. Cunningham was hurt during the Fever’s overtime win against the Connecticut Sun, casting doubt over the team’s playoff push and further depleting an already battered backcourt.The injury occurred in the second quarter when Connecticut’s Bria Hartley drove hard to the basket and collided awkwardly with Sophie Cunningham’s right knee. Cunningham immediately crumpled to the floor in visible pain and had to be assisted off the court.An MRI later confirmed the worst: a torn MCL in her right knee, ruling her out for the season. While doctors expect a full recovery, the setback piles onto a growing list of injuries that has already tested the Fever’s depth and resilience.This was Sophie Cunningham’s debut season with the Indiana Fever following her trade from the Phoenix Mercury. She quickly carved out a role in the rotation, starting in 13 games across 30 appearances. Cunningham averaged 8.6 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 1.2 assists per game while posting career-best efficiency—46.9% from the field and 43.2% from three.Her defense, grit, and timely shooting were crucial for an Indiana squad that had already lost guards Sydney Colson and Aari McDonald earlier in August. Beyond the numbers, her fiery competitiveness and willingness to defend teammates—highlighted by an in-game altercation protecting rookie sensation Caitlin Clark —made her a fan favorite.With Cunningham sidelined, the Indiana Fever wasted no time in making moves. The team signed veteran guard Shey Peddy to a seven-day hardship contract to stabilize the rotation. Peddy, who last played for the Los Angeles Sparks under a similar deal, brings valuable experience to a guard unit hit hard by injuries.Meanwhile, Caitlin Clark’s return looms large. The star rookie has missed 13 games due to a groin injury, and her availability could make or break Indiana’s postseason chances. Sitting sixth in the standings, the Fever still face the league’s toughest remaining schedule, including three matchups against the powerhouse Minnesota Lynx.The emotional impact of Sophie Cunningham ’s injury has been deeply felt. Her sister voiced frustration on social media, calling out WNBA officiating and demanding stronger measures to protect players. Head coach Stephanie White also shared her heartbreak, pointing to both Cunningham’s visible pain and the growing toll on an already injury-ravaged roster.Cunningham, who turned 29 just days before the incident, responded with gratitude and optimism, thanking fans for their support and vowing to stay positive throughout her recovery.The Indiana Fever’s 2025 season has been marred by injuries, forcing constant adjustments and testing the team’s depth. Cunningham’s absence adds yet another hurdle, but also presents opportunities for unheralded players to step into the spotlight.Also read: Gabrielle Union, 52, Stuns in Bikini Photos on Instagram With Dwyane Wade During Summer Getaway For Indiana, the challenge now lies in maintaining momentum in a crowded playoff race.

What does Joe Flacco’s Week 1 starting QB role mean for Shedeur Sanders and Cleveland Browns’ quarterback future?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/what-does-joe-flaccos-week-1-starting-qb-role-mean-for-shedeur-sanders-and-cleveland-browns-quarterback-future/articleshow/123397415.cms,"Cleveland Browns’ quarterback drama unfolds as Joe Flacco wins starting job over rookie sensation Shedeur Sanders (Getty Images)

Cleveland Browns turn to Joe Flacco as veteran leader



Shedeur Sanders and Browns’ depth chart uncertainty



The Cleveland Browns made their quarterback decision official on Monday, handing the Week 1 starting job to 40-year-old Joe Flacco. The move brought immediate intrigue—not only because Flacco is 17 years older than Shedeur Sanders, but also because it reshapes the Browns’ preseason quarterback competition. While Kevin Stefanski’s call settles the biggest storyline of training camp, it also sparks new questions about the future of the team’s quarterback room.Joe Flacco, who went 4-1 with the Browns last season while guiding them to a playoff berth, now becomes just the 11th quarterback in NFL history to start a Week 1 game at age 40 or older. His consistency stood out in training camp, where he was the only quarterback to avoid time on the sidelines due to injury.“Well, we all know how that works. I mean, that’s everybody in the league, but it’s not really my job to look at it in that way. It’s just to go out there and play my game,” Flacco said. “I felt like I was having a good camp with the reps that I was given, and that’s all you can do.”Stefanski praised the veteran’s command and impact, noting that the decision went well beyond health. “Joe performed really well, both in practice, in the joint practices, in the meeting room, you name it.What he’s able to bring to the football team, he’s earned that role,” the Browns head coach explained.While Flacco’s appointment solves one problem, it creates another: who will back him up? Kenny Pickett is still managing a hamstring strain but has resumed 11-on-11 reps. Dillon Gabriel, the 2025 third-round pick, continues to push for snaps. Meanwhile, Sanders—despite impressing with his professionalism since falling to the fifth round—remains limited with an oblique injury.That leaves the Browns in a rare position. General manager Andrew Berry must soon decide whether to keep four quarterbacks, something that has only occurred five times since 2000, according to Sportradar.Flacco and the first-team offense will see preseason action against the Los Angeles Rams this weekend, a dress rehearsal designed to simulate regular-season game planning. For now, the veteran holds the reins, but the pressure behind him is undeniable. Sanders, Pickett, and Gabriel may still shape Cleveland’s quarterback narrative in 2025—and beyond.Also Read: Daniel Jones named Colts’ starting QB as Shane Steichen dismisses ‘quick leash’ concerns for new season","Cleveland Browns name Joe Flacco as their starting quarterback.

Daniel Jones earns QB1 spot through trust and consistency



Colts banking on stability with Daniel Jones at the helm



The Indianapolis Colts ended months of uncertainty by officially naming Daniel Jones their starting quarterback for the 2025 NFL season. The decision, announced Tuesday, puts an end to speculation surrounding whether the veteran quarterback or third-year talent Anthony Richardson would lead the offense. For Jones, who joined the Colts in March after stints with the New York Giants and Minnesota Vikings, this is another opportunity to reshape his career and silence doubters.Head coach Shane Steichen addressed the media following the announcement, clarifying why the Colts decided to go with Jones over Richardson. The answer, according to Steichen, comes down to reliability. “Look, he's our starting quarterback for the season. I don’t want to have a quick leash on that. I feel confident in his abilities,” Steichen said via Max Lewis of Fox59.The coach explained that Richardson, who was benched in favor of Joe Flacco last season, remains part of the team’s long-term vision but still requires growth in critical areas. Richardson reportedly handled the decision well, accepting that his development is key to eventually taking on the starting role.Steichen emphasized that the choice was not about raw talent but rather about who could manage the offense with steadiness.Jones, meanwhile, brings a wealth of experience. Over six seasons with the Giants, he started 69 of 70 games, posting a 64.1% completion rate while throwing for 14,582 yards, 70 touchdowns, and 47 interceptions. His tenure in New York may not have yielded the consistent success the franchise hoped for, but it showcased his ability to manage games, withstand pressure, and move the ball when needed.NFL insiders have pointed out that trust was the defining factor in Steichen’s call. The Athletic’s Zak Keefer shared that Jones revealed earlier in training camp that the job would belong to “who the coaches trust.” Steichen reinforced that sentiment, explaining that beyond flashy plays, what matters most is the ability to “move the football consistently up and down the field, and making good decisions.”By choosing Jones, the Colts are signaling a commitment to stability. While Richardson’s explosive athleticism makes him an enticing future option, Steichen’s strategy reflects a focus on minimizing risk and prioritizing consistency in execution. In a league where turnovers and inconsistency often derail promising teams, Indianapolis appears to have opted for a steady hand rather than a volatile one.For Jones, the 2025 season may serve as his most defining chapter yet. A chance to prove he can not only manage an offense but also elevate it, while leading the Colts to meaningful success. If he delivers, the trust placed in him could mark the beginning of a genuine career revival.Also Read: Who has Madison Beer dated before?

Jerry Jones is the owner of the Dallas Cowboys. In February 1989, he bought the team and then fired Tom Landry, the coach who had held the job for 29 years. Fans were very angry.

This began a tense time for him and Cowboys fans.When Jerry Jones bought the Dallas Cowboys on February 25, 1989, in Dallas, he immediately let go of Tom Landry, the only coach the team had known.

He even said, “I was Darth Vader,” to show how upset fans were.At the time, Cowboys Nation felt betrayed.

He said, “With all that hate, I could stop and cry, or I could just keep going. But I’m not gonna take my marbles and go home. I can’t, I burned all my ships when I landed.” That meant he was fully committed and had to keep going forward.","Jerry Jones is the owner of the Dallas Cowboys.

Is Fabian Lysell on the Move? | Korpi VS DiPietro

Why Edmonton’s interest aligns with their immediate ambitions



The NHL trade market is beginning to stir, and one of the most intriguing names tied to speculation is Fabian Lysell. Once considered a central piece of the Boston Bruins’ future, the 2021 first-round pick now finds himself at the center of heated trade chatter, with the Edmonton Oilers reportedly exploring a deal. For a player who was supposed to grow into Boston’s top-six, the shift in narrative is striking — and it signals the Bruins may be ready to cash in before his value dips.Lysell has been touted for his skating and offensive creativity, but his NHL impact has been limited so far. In 12 appearances during the 2024–25 season, he scored once, added two assists, and averaged 13:26 of ice time with a -4 rating. While his lone goal was a game-winner on the power play, it wasn’t enough to cement a permanent spot in Boston’s deep lineup.As Court Lalonde of the Bruins Diehards podcast noted: “Fast forward to today and instead of talking about him becoming a fixture in the Boston lineup, the conversation has shifted. Rumours are swirling the Bruins may be dangling Lysell in a trade with the Edmonton Oilers.” With just one year left on his entry-level contract before restricted free agency, the Bruins may prefer to move him while his value remains tied to upside rather than uncertainty.For Edmonton, Lysell fits the profile of a low-cost, high-upside winger who could inject speed and secondary scoring into a cap-strapped roster. Surrounded by elite centers and protected by structured line combinations, Lysell could thrive in a situation where his role is clearly defined.Also Read: NHL analyst calls for Champions League-style global tournament to replace World Cup of Hockey The question now is whether Boston prioritizes development patience or flips promise into assets that better align with their win-now window.",The Edmonton Oilers are reportedly exploring a deal for Boston Bruins prospect Fabian Lysell.

Why the Andrew Mangiapane signing was critical for Edmonton’s forward depth

Andrew Mangiapane’s adaptability and what it means for Connor McDavid’s line

The Edmonton Oilers are entering the new NHL season with a clear focus on maintaining offensive firepower and depth after a significant exodus of veteran forwards. Corey Perry, Evander Kane, Jeff Skinner, Viktor Arvidsson, and Connor Brown all departed during the offseason, leaving holes in the Oilers’ forward lines. Analysts have emphasized the importance of strategic signings to ensure Connor McDavid ’s line remains competitive, and the addition of Andrew Mangiapane appears to address that need perfectly.NHL analyst Travis Yost highlighted the significance of Mangiapane’s arrival, noting, “The Andrew Mangiapane signing was sorely needed and filled a critical role in their middle six. Not only is he a regular point producer, here’s something else to consider: he’s never finished a season with a negative on-ice goal differential at even strength.”Signed to a two-year, $7.2 million contract, Mangiapane is expected to slot into Edmonton’s second or third line, providing scoring consistency, defensive reliability, and versatility. His skill set allows him to forecheck effectively, adapt to multiple linemates, and support McDavid without compromising team balance — a key factor after losing several experienced forwards.Mangiapane expressed confidence in his ability to thrive in the top-six role, stating, “I think I'm capable.I think last year was a little bit of a down year for me, but I think I could get right back to where I've been and what I can do. I think a lot of you guys have seen it, and the fans and everyone who saw me playing in Calgary know what I'm capable of. So I'm just excited to be given an opportunity.”He added, “Obviously, there are a lot of good players on this team, so just looking at the roster, I could hopefully play with anyone and go up and down. There could be a good fit wherever the coach puts me.”Drafted 166th overall by the Calgary Flames in 2015, Mangiapane has demonstrated consistent point production, most recently accumulating 28 points over 81 games with the Washington Capitals. His arrival not only replenishes Edmonton’s offensive depth but also strengthens McDavid’s line, ensuring the Oilers remain a threat in the Western Conference.Also Read: NHL analyst calls for Champions League-style global tournament to replace World Cup of Hockey As the Oilers prepare for the new season, Mangiapane’s signing could prove pivotal in stabilizing the forward corps, helping Connor McDavid maximize his impact, and keeping Edmonton competitive despite offseason departures.","Andrew Mangiapane signed a two-year, $7.2 million contract with the Edmonton Oilers.

Everyone thought Jake Guentzel was Tampa Bay bound – his confession proves otherwise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/everyone-thought-jake-guentzel-was-tampa-bay-bound-his-confession-proves-otherwise/articleshow/123391609.cms,"Jake Guentzel finally clears air, admits trade deadline deal to Tampa Bay Lightning almost never happened (Imagn Images)

Jake Guentzel reflects on his time in Carolina



Hurricanes’ missed opportunity as Jake Guentzel thrives in Tampa



When Jake Guentzel was moved to the Carolina Hurricanes at the 2024 NHL Trade Deadline, many expected it to be a rental move. But according to the forward himself, he never envisioned it that way. Despite later signing a seven-year, $63 million contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning, Guentzel recently admitted that his heart was set on staying in Carolina. His words now highlight just how close the Hurricanes were to securing a key piece for the future.The Pittsburgh Penguins made the difficult decision to trade Jake Guentzel in March 2024, signaling the end of their championship window. Guentzel quickly found chemistry in Carolina, helping the Hurricanes advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals before bowing out to the New York Rangers. Even in such a short stint, the winger felt at home.“It was a whirlwind kind of time, 1st time going to a different team, wasn't sure how it was going to go. I loved my time there, great team, great group of guys,” Guentzel said.For him, the plan was clear. He hoped to strike a deal right after Carolina’s playoff exit. “There was kind of a lot of back and forth before free agency, was hoping to get a deal done right after the season, just kind of didn't come to fruition.”The Hurricanes’ hesitation opened the door for Tampa Bay, who traded for Guentzel’s rights just before free agency began. “Then Tampa came and traded for my rights, and I think it was a no-brainer when that happened,” he explained.In his first season with the Lightning, Guentzel silenced any doubts. He delivered an 80-point campaign (41 goals, 39 assists) in 80 games, easing the blow of losing longtime captain Steven Stamkos to Nashville. Though Tampa’s playoff run ended in the opening round against the Florida Panthers, Guentzel’s consistency stood out.For Carolina, the sting remains. They advanced to the conference final but lacked the finishing punch Guentzel might have provided. Looking back, his admission suggests the Hurricanes may regret not locking him down when they had the chance.Also Read: Former Penguins star reportedly linked to blockbuster trade discussions with Canadian team amid rising NHL buzz","Pittsburgh Penguins traded Jake Guentzel to the Carolina Hurricanes at the 2024 NHL Trade Deadline.

Steelers ' apologies accepted: Aaron Rodgers handles pre-signing drama with professionalism



Before Aaron Rodgers officially signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers, several players made headlines with their candid remarks about the future Hall of Famer. One of the most notable comments came from defensive lineman Cameron Heyward. On a recent episode of his podcast, Not Just Football with Cam Heyward, the veteran addressed his previous statements and issued a heartfelt apology to Rodgers.During the podcast, Heyward said, “I have to apologize. I guess my words were taken out of context when I said, ‘Do you want to be a Pittsburgh Steeler or not?’” The comment had sparked widespread discussion among fans and analysts, raising questions about the locker room dynamic before Rodgers’ arrival. Heyward clarified that he harbored no ill will toward the quarterback and wanted to set the record straight.Rodgers responded positively to Heyward’s apology, showing his trademark grace. “Well, I think there’s a great quote in a TV show that I enjoyed called 'Ted Lasso.' Ted talks about one of his favorite quotes: be curious, not judgmental. And I think that’s kind of how I wanted to approach this season,” Rodgers said. He added that he respects Heyward’s leadership and accomplishments in the NFL , making it clear that no offense was taken.Heyward’s comments weren’t the only ones causing buzz. Steelers safety DeShon Elliott joked that the 41-year-old quarterback should “stay at the retirement home.” Like Heyward, Elliott also issued an apology to Rodgers, emphasizing respect for the veteran’s career. Rodgers later reflected on the situation, noting that he “never got offended by anyone” and that such comments only increased his interest in connecting with teammates.With apologies from Heyward and Elliott now accepted, fans are left wondering if former Steelers legend Terry Bradshaw might make a similar move. While speculation continues, Rodgers’ focus remains on building chemistry with his new teammates and contributing to Pittsburgh’s success on the field.Also Read: Alex Smith extends ESPN deal: Former 49ers QB to appear on Get Up, First Take, and Sunday NFL Countdown As the 2025 NFL season approaches, Rodgers’ leadership and ability to handle pre-signing drama with poise set a strong tone for the Steelers.

Jimmy Connors, speaking on September 22, 1999, in a press conference with British reporters, firmly rejected placing Andre Agassi alongside him, Pete Sampras, and John McEnroe. Despite Andre Agassi’s big year, winning both the French Open and the U.S. Open, reclaiming the World No. 1 spot and ending Sampras’s six-year streak, Connors was blunt: “I wouldn’t mention his name in the same breath.” He also dismissed claims that Agassi modeled his game on him, saying, “Imitation is the greatest form of flattery but I think they broke the mold when I finished.” Jimmy Connors added that Agassi’s comeback at age 29 was not admirable, saying there were “too many dips in his career,” and that with Agassi’s talent, he “should never have allowed himself to drop out of the top four or five.”Jimmy Connors was not astonished by Andre Agassi's achievements in 1999.

San Francisco 49ers add Nate Sudfeld to strengthen quarterback depth amid Patrick Taylor injury



The San Francisco 49ers have once again showcased their offseason aggression, making critical roster moves involving offensive players this summer. On Tuesday, the 'Niners made headlines by placing running back Patrick Taylor on season-ending injured reserve and signing quarterback Nate Sudfeld to a one-year deal, signaling strategic adjustments as they prepare for the final week of preseason action.San Francisco’s latest moves come after Taylor dislocated his shoulder in the second preseason game, leaving the team without one of their promising running backs. Taylor’s season-ending injury opened a roster spot that the 49ers quickly filled by bringing in quarterback Nate Sudfeld.Sudfeld’s addition provides valuable depth as starting quarterback Mac Jones may miss time due to a recent knee injury. With preseason games being crucial for evaluating talent, Sudfeld is expected to play a key role in maintaining quarterback stability for the 'Niners.This marks Sudfeld’s second stint with the team. He initially joined the 49ers’ practice squad in 2021 and remained through the 2022 training camp before being released. Over his career, Sudfeld has also spent time with the Commanders, Eagles, and Lions. He entered the NFL as a sixth-round pick in 2016 with the Commanders and has appeared in six games, completing 25 of 37 passes for 188 yards and one touchdown.Sudfeld’s familiarity with the 49ers’ system could prove beneficial, especially if Mac Jones is sidelined longer than expected.While this signing strengthens San Francisco’s quarterback depth for the preseason finale, it also offers Sudfeld a platform to impress other NFL teams with a strong performance.

Your team doesn’t care what you say

Indian parenting is full of contradictions 👇

🔹 “Express yourself!”… but not with elders

🔹 “Be confident!”… but only when convenient

🔹 “Be happy!”… but follow the path we’ve already picked

Poll Do you believe parents should lead by example when it comes to screen time? No, it's not necessary Yes, absolutely

No wonder a Harvard study found only 22% of kids said they’d turn to parents when something felt wrong.

I’m guilty too. I kept nagging my daughter > read more, eat better, spend less time on screens.

Until one day she shot back: “But you’re always on your phone.” 👀

That one line hit harder than any parenting book.

Because kids don’t listen to what you say. They copy what you do.

Same with teams!
