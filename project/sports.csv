An exhibition celebrating his 101st anniversary captures the many faces and moods of Vajpayee,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/an-exhibition-celebrating-his-101st-anniversary-captures-the-many-faces-and-moods-of-vajpayee/articleshow/126182637.cms,"NEW DELHI: On the occasion of Atal Bihari Vajpayee ’s 101st birth anniversary, an exhibition titled ‘Atal Prashasti’ is seeking to bring to life various aspects of the former PM’s life including the many hats he wore, from that of a statesman to that of a poet and orator par excellence.The exhibition, which will be on till Jan 23 at the Prime Ministers Museum and Library (Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya) at the Teen Murti campus, tells the Vajpayee story over three themes: ‘the statesman in action’, roots of conviction’, and ‘words of wisdom’ and follows a descending curatorial narrative.It opens with Vajpayee’s public and political life as remembered by the nation, then delves into the struggles, ideals, and experiences that shaped his convictions, and finally reveals his most intimate dimension as a poet and thinker.Born on December 25, 1924 in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, Vajpayee held office as Prime Minister for three terms. Beginning his career in journalism, he later emerged as a towering political leader and reformer who laid the foundation for important milestones in India’s development.The exhibition highlights Vajpayee multifaceted personality - as a poet, journalist, orator, social worker, and literature, admired across political lines for his intellect, eloquence, and humanism.Besides photographs marking his political journey and time as PM, the exhibition also carries impressions from his days at school and college. The exhibition has been installed at the foyer between Block 1 and Block 2, near Vajpayee’s iconic Ambassador car exhibit. Famous lines of some of his poems that have been inscribed on cloth scrolls welcomes visitors while recordings of his poems in Vajpayee’s distinct voice, with their deliberate pauses, play in the background.As one crosses a scroll highlighting the words from his poem “Bharat ka Mastak Nahin Jhukega”, the wall on the other side captures in pictures Vajpayee and President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin signing the Moscow declaration between India and Russia on international terrorism in Moscow in 2001.A photo of Vajpayee visiting Bhuj after the earthquake and one of him addressing the Army during a visit to Kargil and Srinagar in 1998 also find pride of place. There is also a photo of Vajpayee addressing the nation from Red Fort on the first Independence day of the new century on August 15, 2000.The exhibition also has photos that reflect Vajpayee’s softer side like one where he is seen distributing sweets to children and interacting with them during a visit to Warsaw in June 1979 when he was India’s external affairs minister. Another iconic memory is a striking photo that captures Vajpayee and actor Dev Anand in a Janta Party rally in Delhi in December 1979.Also on display are Vajpayee’s books - his speeches and poems and photos reflecting the many awards and honours he received ranging from the Padma Vibhushan to the Bharat Ratna.At the end of the pavilion is an image that is the highlight of the exhibition - a candid shot that captures Vajpayee stepping out of his ambassador and it is aptly captioned as the “silent companion” and just outside one sees on display his “faithful Ambassador” car.","Atal Bihari Vajpayee was born on December 25, 1924 in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh.

Heavy traffic blamed for delay

CHITRADURGA/BENGALURU: The passengers who escaped the bus fire after a collision with a truck near Hiriyur, Karnataka, in the early hours of Thursday said surviving the flames was only the first battle; the second was the long wait in the bitter night cold for medical help.While three passengers in the sleeper coach survived serious wounds including burns, 25 others suffered minor injuries. Most passengers were asleep when the crash jolted them awake. Thick smoke quickly filled the bus, leaving many gasping for breath. With no time to think, several passengers kicked open windows and jumped out of the burning vehicle, sustaining injuries as flames engulfed the bus behind them.Hemaraj, who was travelling with his wife Kalpana and eight-year-old son to Gokarna, said: ""We were in deep sleep. I suddenly felt something falling on my head from above. When I looked around, everything was dark and filled with smoke. I realised a fire had broken out, and I immediately pushed my son out through the window. Then my wife jumped. I looked towards the back of the bus and heard people crying for help and shouting in panic. By then, the fire had reached us. I had no choice but to jump out through the window,"" he said.For many passengers who escaped, panic soon turned into anger.""We were alive, but in pain. We were shivering in the cold, injured, with the bus still burning in front of us. There was no ambulance,"" Varun, a techie travelling on the bus, told TOI.According to the survivors, despite repeated calls to emergency numbers, the first ambulance reached the spot nearly an hour and half later. Two more ambulances arrived only between 3.40am and 4am. ""The passengers were crying for help. We had burns and fractures, standing in the cold, waiting. There was no quick response at all,"" another survivor said. Manjunath M, who suffered nearly 70% burns, faced a harrowing time while waiting to be shifted to the hospital.Several passengers pointed out that firefighters reached the site within 20 minutes, but medical help lagged far behind. As the survivors waited in pain, it was locals who became first responders.Ritish Kumar, a private firm driver who rushed to the spot after learning of the crash, said he called his friends from Gayatri Jalashaya Sangha to help.""Firefighters came quickly, and along with locals, we tried to pull people out... We helped them escape,"" he said. With ambulances still missing, locals eventually helped shift the injured to Hiriyur and Shira govt hospitals once vehicles arrived.The drivers of the ambulances which reached the accident spot maintained that they got delayed because of a massive traffic jam on the highway. ""With vehicle movements coming to a standstill on the highway after the crash, we took a long time to reach the spot. The traffic extended up to around 3 km,"" one of the ambulance drivers said.","Three passengers in the sleeper coach survived serious wounds including burns, 25 others suffered minor injuries.

NEW DELHI: It has been a year bookended by elections. It started with the intense campaigning for the Delhi assembly elections and ended with the surprising results of Bihar. In between, there were parliamentary showdowns, infights and figures emerging and fading away from the centre stage.In 2025, while several heavyweights failed to live up to expectations, many asserted their place back in, proving themselves the dark horses of Indian politics.The year was also a reminder that power is rarely static — and that survival often matters as much as victory.So, who were the winners and losers in politics in 2025? Here's a look.Ahead of the Bihar assembly elections, the opposition was in a hurry to write the political obituary of chief minister Nitish Kumar. Throughout the campaign, Nitish’s former deputy and RJD scion Tejashwi Yadav claimed that the chief minister was ""mentally unfit"" and ""too old"" to govern the state.Additionally, political pundits were also skeptical about Nitish’s return. They flagged anti-incumbency and infighting within the NDA to argue that the odds were stacked against him.However, the results presented a different picture. Bihar once again handed a sweeping mandate to the NDA, extending Nitish Kumar’s two-decade-long hold on power.The NDA secured a thumping majority, winning 202 seats in the 243-member House.Within the NDA, the BJP emerged as the strongest performer, securing 89 seats -- its best-ever result in the state -- followed by Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) with 85 seats.As the Congress government reached the halfway mark in Karnataka on November 20, talk of a secret agreement became public. Several MLAs and MLCs from deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar ’s faction camped in Delhi to press the party high command to honour the “deal” and make him chief minister for the next two and a half years.DKS added fuel to the speculation after he confirmed the “secret deal,” claiming that there had indeed been “a confidential understanding on leadership transition among five or six leaders” soon after the Congress won a landslide in the 2023 elections.This triggered one of the most cordial tussles between chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy. The two leaders even sat down for breakfast meetings to reach an understanding, but the question over the chief ministerial post remained unanswered.For now, the standoff appears to have eased. Siddaramaiah seems to have bought more time from the high command, while DKS appears to have chosen to wait it out, with both leaders refraining from making any public remarks on the issue.Bihar MLA Nitin Nabin’s elevation as the working president of the Bharatiya Janata Party was a rise that few saw coming. While political pundits were speculating about the names of bigwigs with strong RSS links, Nabin’s appointment marked a major organisational shift at the top of the ruling party.Although he is only 45 years old, Nabin is a five-term MLA and has handled several key organisational responsibilities. He served as the Bihar president of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha from 2016 to 2019 and managed the BJP’s Lok Sabha and assembly campaigns in Sikkim in 2019, before being appointed co-incharge of Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh in 2021.At a time when the Congress was considered the frontrunner to retain power in the 2023 Chhattisgarh assembly polls, Nabin’s inputs to the BJP leadership predicted victory, which ultimately came true.Caste arithmetic also aligns with Nabin’s elevation as party president. The choice of Nabin, an upper-caste Kayastha -- a community that constitutes barely 0.6% of Bihar’s population and is considered politically insignificant in the state -- is significant because Kayasthas are among the key castes in West Bengal, where assembly elections are scheduled for May next year.Political mobilisation of the women vote bank through welfare schemes saw its peak in the 2025 Bihar assembly elections. Just days ahead of the elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi rolled out the Mukhya Mantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana, which credited Rs 10,000 to the bank accounts of 1.2 crore women. Additionally, social security schemes like free electricity up to 125 units and a pension increment were also announced by chief minister Nitish Kumar in the run-up to the elections.This translated into the polling booths as women voters outnumbered men and shattered turnout records. While the overall turnout stood at 66.91 per cent, an extraordinary 71.6 per cent of women cast their votes -- nearly nine percentage points higher than the 62.8 per cent turnout among men.This overwhelming participation tilted the mandate toward the NDA, boosted by welfare schemes for women. The contrast between the two alliances was simple: the NDA had already delivered the benefit, while Mahagathbandhan’s offer remained a campaign promise. For many women, that difference -- money already in the bank versus a promise of future help -- mattered.At a time when stars are not aligning for Dalit leaders like Mayawati and Jitan Ram Manjhi, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan emerged as the third hero in the NDA's success in Bihar.LJP(RS) won 19 out of 29 seats, propelling the NDA past the 200-seat mark.Chirag’s dominance in Bihar and within the NDA was evident even during the seat-sharing talks, when his party got a fair share despite only one of its 143 candidates winning during the 2020 assembly polls. His bargaining power came from the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, when LJP(RV) won all five seats it contested.The fortune wheels did not spin for Congress this year either, as 2024 was marred with poll routs and infighting for the party. Wounded by the defeats in Haryana and Maharashtra in 2024, the grand old party continued its lackluster performance in 2025.It began with the poll rout in the Delhi assembly elections, where Congress could not win even a single seat. In addition to the poll results, it also suffered an alliance breakup as collateral damage after the Aam Aadmi Party decided to walk away from the INDIA bloc.In the Bihar assembly elections, Congress experienced its steepest decline after it managed to win only six seats. Rahul Gandhi travelled over 1,300 kilometres to galvanise voter support but fell flat in comparison to the local issues that resonated more strongly with Bihar's electorate.Meanwhile, the party encountered another crisis in Karnataka after a tussle broke out between Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar over the chief ministerial post. Although the situation seems defused for now, the party is sitting on a ticking time bomb that may detonate soon.Moreover, several Congress leaders flagged serious problems within the party. One of them was former Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim, who wrote to Sonia Gandhi, calling for an “open-heart surgery” in the party and flagging a growing disconnect between the leadership and its workers.In his letter to Sonia Gandhi dated December 8, ex-Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim highlighted six consecutive election losses in Odisha and three in the Lok Sabha while also questioning the selection of Mallikarjun Kharge as the party's leader, claiming that the 83-year-old veteran “is unable to resonate with India's youth.”2025 was a year of autumn for the Lalu clan. Lalu Yadav, along with his family and party, had to suffer setbacks throughout the year. In the Bihar elections, the party only won 25 seats in the assembly elections, registering one of its poorest performances.Soon, things went south on the family front as well. Just days after the poll results, Rohini Acharya -- the second of RJD chief Lalu Prasad's nine children and the donor of the kidney that saved him -- announced that she was quitting politics and “disowning” her family.Reportedly, Rohini had a heated argument with her brother Tejashwi Yadav over RJD's assembly election disaster. She also alleged she was accused of donating a “dirty kidney” to her father after “extracting crores of rupees and a Lok Sabha ticket.”Earlier, Lalu had expelled his eldest, Tej Pratap Yadav, from the party for six years after he shared a photo with a woman on Facebook and claimed he had been in a relationship with her for 12 years.Later, Tej Pratap went on to form his own party -- Jan Shakti Janta Dal -- which drew a blank in the assembly elections.Prashant Kishor, once hailed as India’s top election strategist, entered the Bihar polls as a political aspirant and walked out as its biggest loser.After a two-year padyatra across Bihar and massive media hype around Jan Suraaj, Kishor positioned himself as a transformative alternative to both the NDA and the Mahagathbandhan. However, Jan Suraaj did not manage to win a single seat, losing security deposits in the majority of the constituencies where it fielded candidates.However, PK has repeatedly said that he won’t back down. His next test comes much sooner than 2030 -- the panchayat elections in 2026 -- where he may attempt to make a comeback.After two sweeping victories in 2015 and 2020, Kejriwal's AAP was swept out of power in the 2025 Delhi assembly elections. Of the 70 assembly constituencies, the BJP clinched 48 seats, while AAP managed to secure only 22.Adding insult to injury, Kejriwal also lost the New Delhi seat to BJP's Parvesh Verma.Rising to power as an anti-graft crusader, Kejriwal found himself embroiled in corruption cases days ahead of the elections.After walking out of jail on bail, Kejriwal resigned from the top post, seeking validation from the public of Delhi. The union territory, however, refused to give the stamp of 'Mr Clean' to Kejriwal.Despite pulling every trick in the book, DK Shivakumar failed to replace Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah. After the tussle came out in the open, DKS made several trips to Delhi, but the high command has not budged.DKS checked all the criteria to become the Karnataka CM. He generated funds for the party during the elections, and Vokkaliga seers -- one of the strongest sects in Karnataka -- are also backing him. Additionally, the majority of Congress MLAs are on his side.Despite this, DKS has decided to take a step back, obey the party high command and wait for the right time to come as the high command huddles in Delhi to deliver an answer.Through his charm and “Tharoorosaurus,” Congress MP Shashi Tharoor remained in the headlines throughout the year. Another reason he grabbed eyeballs was his standoff with his own party on different occasions. Despite being a member of the CWC, the Thiruvananthapuram MP skipped several important party meetings and refused to toe the party line on multiple issues. This irked many senior leaders of the grand old party, leading to repeated to-and-fro exchanges on social media platforms and in media bites.It all began after Shashi Tharoor emerged as one of the prominent voices articulating New Delhi’s position following the Pahalgam terror attack and India’s Operation Sindoor. Later, the Centre invited him to lead an Indian delegation as part of a global outreach after Operation Sindoor, even as the Congress was raising tough questions for the government. This did not go down well with his party colleagues, who accused him of cozying up to the BJP.However, just ahead of the Kerala assembly elections, The grand-old-party is reluctant to take strict disciplinary action against a popular leader in the state, effectively giving Tharoor a free lane to drive on the wrong side.Now, it is yet to be determined whether Tharoor came out as a winner or a loser after the tug-of-war session with his own party.","In 2025, several heavyweights failed to live up to expectations.

"Cousins unite, MVA disintegrates? How Thackeray alliance isolates Congress in Maharashtra",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cousins-unite-mva-disintegrates-how-thackeray-alliance-isolates-congress-in-maharashtra/articleshow/126175367.cms,"'Batenge Toh Katenge': Uddhav & Raj Thackeray Unite For Mumbai Civic Polls | Shiv Sena (UBT) | MNS

NEW DELHI: The much-hyped reunion of the Thackeray cousins after 20 years has altered the political landscape of Maharashtra with the new alliance signalling the silent end of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) - the opposition front which Uddhav formed with the Congress and Sharad Pawar’s NCP in 2019 to keep the BJP out of power after the assembly elections.The MVA, which ruled the state for two-and-a-half years, was dealt a body blow in 2022 when the Shiv Sena and the NCP split down the middle after rebellion against Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar. Despite the setback, the opposition coalition came back strongly in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, winning 30 out of the 48 seats in the state. But that glory was short-lived as the MVA was decimated in the assembly elections held later in the year and could collectively win only 46 out of the 288 seats.While the assembly elections had already taken the sting out of the MVA, the Thackeray alliance has now literally left the coalition on the verge of disintegration. Sharad Pawar has indicated he will align with the Thackeray cousins, but the Congress has been left in the lurch as it refused to join hands with Raj Thackeray ’s MNS, given his aggressive “outsiders” pitch against north Indians.So, where does the Congress go from here? The immediate test for the grand-old-party is the elections to 29 civic corporations in Maharashtra, including the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, on January 15.The just-concluded municipal council and nagar panchayat elections, which were swept by the BJP-led Mahayuti, saw the Congress emerge as the main opposition party. While the Congress won 824 seats, its MVA allies - NCP (SP) and Shiv Sena (UBT) - could manage only 256 and 244 seats respectively. Little wonder, the Congress, which had for some time now played second fiddle to both Uddhav and Sharad Pawar, was quick to assert that it has now emerged as the principal opposition in the state.Maharashtra Congress chief Harshwardhan Sapkal on Thursday said his party is holding discussions to form an alliance with Prakash Ambedkar's Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) for the upcoming municipal corporation elections. But will this alliance be enough to help the grand-old-party counter the force of ruling Mahayuti on one hand and the strong Marathi pitch of the Thackeray brothers on the other?The Congress move to chart its own course in Maharashtra is a bold gambit. The party which had a fairly strong presence in the state politics till 2009, has since seen its electoral fortunes decline. In the 2024 assembly elections, the Congress could win only 16 seats out of the 101 it contested in the 288-member assembly. The Congress vote share stood at 12.42% - which is the lowest for the party in Maharashtra, but still more than all other players in the state except the BJP.The Congress would be hoping to draw support from the minorities, Dalits and also the migrant voters by staying away from Raj Thackeray. It would also hope to insulate itself from anti-incumbency against Uddhav Thackeray, whose Shiv Sena has dominated the BMC for many years.However, this solo fight pitches the Congress against the BJP - which has been an undisputed winner in all recent electoral contests. The move also ends up dividing the opposition space in the civic polls, giving the BJP-led Mahayuti an advantage. The local body elections will also put to the test the Congress’s organisational strength - which has seen a decline in many states. If, despite these challenges, the Congress does manage a decent show in the civic polls, it could pave the way for a changed thinking in its alliance politics. On the flip side, a poor show could push it more towards oblivion and reduce the party’s bargaining power.The Congress, for now, says that independent contests by MVA constituents in civic elections should not be seen as a rift within either the MVA or the INDIA bloc. Leader of Opposition Vijay Wadettiwar justified the party’s solo stance and said that while the INDIA bloc had fought the Lok Sabha elections together and the MVA contested the assembly polls as a united front, local body elections operate under different political realities.However, if the Thackeray clan bonhomie translates into electoral gains for both Uddhav and Raj, the Congress will have to be prepared for a long solo stint in the state.",Uddhav & Raj Thackeray reunite for Mumbai Civic Polls.

There is an old saying, borrowed from Latin and later made popular in English: Nulla nuova, buona nuova- no news is good news. In 1640, writer James Howell noted that Italians believed no news was better than bad news. Even before that, King James I of England had said much the same thing.But 2025 did not feel like a year of “no news”. It was loud, crowded, and often heavy. Every day brought fresh alerts, arguments, and anxieties. And yet, in between all that noise, some moments did not ask for attention but earned it anyway. Small moments. Humane moments. Acts of kindness that reminded people that decency still exists.This is a look back at some of those moments. Not because they went viral, but because they felt real. Because they sounded like stories you would tell someone you love, late at night, to remind them that the world is not entirely broken.Note inside an autoIt was past midnight. A woman was travelling alone. She had booked an auto, shared her live location, and done everything she was told would keep her safe. Still, she was tense until she reached her door. For many women in India, this is routine, not an exception. However, one such late-night ride in Bengaluru became something entirely different.A woman travelling in a Rapido auto noticed a handwritten note inside the vehicle. It read: “I’m a father/brother too. Your safety matters. Sit back comfortably.” The woman recorded a short video and shared it online. In it, she says that it was 12 at night, she was alone, and reading that note made her feel safe. Not watched. Not judged. Just safe.The auto driver did not speak on camera. He did not explain himself. The note spoke for him. It told passengers that he saw them as people, not fares. As someone’s daughter or sister, just as his own family was someone else’s responsibility.Women’s safety during late-night travel is a serious concern across Indian cities. Incidents of harassment make news regularly. But this moment showed something quieter: that trust can also be built in small ways. A piece of paper. A few honest words. No grand promise. Just reassurance.A sandwich at 2 amAnother Bengaluru cab, another late night, but this time, a different kind of kindness. Content creator Yogita Rathore had just finished a long shoot and was heading to the airport for a 2 am flight. She was tired, hungry, and overwhelmed.Sitting in the back of an Uber, she spoke to a friend on the phone and broke down. She mentioned she had not eaten all day and did not know when she would get food.A few minutes later, the cab stopped. The driver said he'd be back. The woman thought he was taking a short break. Instead, he returned with a sandwich.In her video, the driver says calmly that he heard her talking about being hungry. He says that if his sister were hungry, he would feel bad too.The video ended with a simple message: people are carrying more than we can see, and a small act can change someone’s entire day.Online, viewers responded with warmth. Some said the moment was sweet and unexpected. Others admitted they would normally hesitate to accept food from a stranger, but understood why this felt different.A luxury car, and a shared joyBusinessman Anand Mahindra shared a video that left a deep impact on him. In the clip, a luxury car owner notices a poor man trying to take a selfie with his vehicle.When the man sees the owner approaching, he panics and tries to leave. Instead of scolding him, the owner does something else. He takes photos of the man with the car. Then, he offers him a ride. The video was part of content creator Seenu Malik’s “365 good day challenge”.Mahindra wrote that the video reminded him that cars are not just machines. They carry emotion. Joy. Aspiration. As someone who works in the automobile industry, he said he hoped designers and engineers would remember that vehicles are meant to make people feel something, not just move them from one place to another.An unlikely guest at SRK's MannatShah Rukh Khan lives in Mannat, a bungalow worth hundreds of crores. A short video showed a stray dog sleeping peacefully inside Mannat, which was under construction.The dog lay undisturbed near the entrance. No one chased it away. The clip was shared by a social media user who said that Khan’s staff feed stray dogs around the house every day.Fans flooded the comments. Some said this quiet compassion was why they admired the actor. Others said that if more people treated strays with care, fear would reduce.The video also came as the Supreme Court modified its earlier order directing civic bodies in Delhi-NCR to capture and confine stray dogs. The court said the directive was too harsh and instead asked authorities to sterilise, deworm, and release the dogs. It also called for designated feeding areas.'What a lovely man'A Scottish YouTuber Hugh Abroad was standing by a busy road in Chennai, waiting for transport. A man on a two-wheeler stopped and asked where he was going. Hugh explained. The man said he was heading towards the city too and agreed to drop him part of the way.Before starting again, the man stopped at a juice shop. He asked Hugh what he would like. Hugh chose orange juice. The man paid, refusing to let Hugh cover the cost.The moment was simple. Hugh looked genuinely moved. “What a lovely man,” he said in the video.The clip crossed over 20 million views on Instagram. Many viewers said this was everyday India, kindness without reason. Several spoke about Indian hospitality, about welcoming strangers without calculation.Happy birthday, delivery partner Zomato delivery executive arrived at a customer’s door, expecting another routine order. Instead, he walked into his own birthday celebration.The customers had arranged a cake and waited for him. As they sang, the delivery partner stood stunned, trying not to cry. He cut the cake there, in the middle of his workday.The video, shared on Instagram, struck a chord. The caption read: “Our Zomato delivery guy just got delivered with lots of love.”For someone who spends most days moving quickly from one door to another, this pause mattered. It said: we see you.Kids choose care over comfortIn Noida, during peak summer, two young boys were filmed pushing a makeshift cart. Inside it lay their injured dog, weak after being attacked by another stray.The boys wore worn clothes and slippers. They had no visible resources. But they were taking their dog to an animal hospital. When asked, one boy said they had already been once and were returning for further treatment.Viewers praised the boys’ compassion. Some asked for contact details to help cover medical costs. Others said the children showed courage that many adults lacked.Son for a dayInfluencer Anish Bhagat spoke to the security guard in his society, 65-year-old Byas Ji.

2025 has been a year of several wonderful games, and titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Ghost of Yotei were the main highlights. However, the year also featured some highly-anticipated games that were pretty abysmal. Such games are the perfect reminder that massive budgets cannot guarantee success.The best example would be MindsEye, which failed to resonate with audiences and was massively unsuccessful. Listed below are five big-budget titles from 2025 that ended up failing.Developed by Build a Rocket Boy and led by former Rockstar North president Leslie Benzies, MindsEye was marketed as a GTA killer. However, its launch was a technical disaster, and the game was plagued by bugs, janky AI, and poor mission design.With a devastating Metacritic score, the game was widely criticized for its lack of polish and personality. The failure was so severe that it was called one of the worst launches of the decade, resulting in widespread refunds on Steam and PlayStation.Call of Duty released back-to-back Black Ops titles in 2024 and 2025, and this decision backfired spectacularly with Black Ops 7. The game was torn by critics and fans for its reinvention of the campaign mode.They essentially made the story always-online and co-op focused, removing the classic cinematic pacing.Added to this, the inability to pause, even in solo play, and a lack of checkpoints turned the campaign into one of the worst in the franchise's history.While Monster Hunter Wilds was a content-rich success on consoles, its PC port became a symbol of technical failure. Even months after launch, the game remains poorly optimized, suffering from heavy stuttering and blurry visuals regardless of hardware.The reliance on aggressive upscaling, like DLSS, to even achieve playable frame rates led to extremely bad player feedback. Despite being a commercial hit initially, sales dropped off after the word of the technical issues spread.Obsidian’s Avowed suffered from an identity crisis throughout its long development. Originally teased as a dark, Skyrim-like open world, the final product was scaled down into a colorful, zone-based RPG that many felt lacked soul.Following multiple creative reboots and a director change, the game was quite disappointing. Even though it is technically playable, the shallow dialogues and repetitive combat failed to engage the audience.Remedy Entertainment usually releases some of the best games; however, they failed to do so with FBC: Firebreak. The game was basically sold as a multiplayer co-op successor to Control, but simply ended up being a generic shooter without any inventive content.FBC: Firebreak didn’t have the narrative magic of the Remedy Connected Universe, resulting in a lot of disappointment. With a very low active player count on Steam after release, it struggled to justify its existence alongside the more prestigious titles from Remedy.","Big budget 2025 games that failed to resonate with audiences.

Draymond Green goes candid on Steve Kerr altercation calling it a “huge moment of growth”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/draymond-green-goes-candid-on-steve-kerr-altercation-calling-it-a-huge-moment-of-growth/articleshow/126177971.cms,"Draymond Green with Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr (Image via: Getty Images)

How Draymond Green's stepping away from conflict marked a defining moment?



Draymond Green’s candid reflection highlights maturity as the Golden State Warriors focusses on legacy

Draymond Green has never shied away from expressing his emotions or his feelings, and that spark has long been part of what defines him as a distinct player of the Golden State Warriors. However, one altercation with head coach Steve Kerr became more than just a matter of intense talk inside the NBA. Speaking candidly, Draymond Green described the incident as a moment of self-growth, showing a sight of self-reflection from a player who is often known for speaking his heart out.According to Draymond Green, this whole situation taught him a big lesson, making him understand when to step away rather than escalating and intensifying an already intense situation. He went on to explain that he did not in any way want one thing to become two, explaining how quickly words spoken in anger could create further damage to the reputation of a player. By removing himself and choosing to stay quiet, Green felt that he protected not only the integrity of the team but also his years-long relationship with Kerr.For a veteran player like Draymond Green, his decision to remove himself from the entire situation is quite impactful.Because the Warriors have built their team as well as their legacy based on trust and values carried forward by Kerr as their head coach. Thus, for Green, understanding what words to choose in a crucial situation such as this, and understanding when emotions cross their lines, is very important, especially given his influence over his younger teammates, watching him, and learning how to respond under pressure.The incident also highlighted one important learning that no matter how professional one is on-court, it doesn't define their off-court impact and the weight they carry as a part of their career. Green also acknowledged that some words, “you can’t come back from tomorrow”, reflected his maturity and his presence of mind that he has gained through his years of experience in the big league. Rather than getting frustrated and gaining unnecessary public attention, he chose to remain silent, reflecting upon the importance of emotional control and self-esteem, which one needs to maintain as an athlete.At this stage, what matters most for Green is his evolution as a player, as his career demands him. The Warriors are no longer just running after winning games, but they are trying to create a legacy of their own. And Green’s self-reflection on an intense situation like this is proof that in a league as big as the NBA, it is important to maintain personality and growth not just on the court but also off it.By openly talking about the altercation, Draymond Green also sent a very powerful message that, rather than playing blame games, it is important for a player to focus on their own game and choose their words wisely. In a league where there is trash talk going on, almost on a regular basis, his words showed a sign of responsibility and strength. For the Golden State Warriors, this incident could be taken as a moment to build trust between players and the coach, turning an intense situation into a meaningful one.Also Read: ""It was actually amazing” – Warriors’ Draymond Green loved his 12-game suspension for heartfelt Christmas moment","Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green has spoken out about his altercation with head coach Steve Kerr.

NHL Player Philip Danault has opened up for the first time after his trade from the Los Angeles Kings to the Montreal Canadiens in a major trade recently. The trade of Danault to the Montreal Canadians has raised serious concerns, as he played extremely well when he arrived in Los Angeles, but his overall play has tapered off.With the trade, the center will again play for the Montreal Canadiens, where he played from 2015-16 through 2020-21. This is a homecoming for Danault, who hails from Victoriaville, PQ, which is less than two hours from Montreal. Reports state that it has been almost a week since the Los Angeles Kings traded Phillip Danault to the Montreal Canadiens. While both sides have moved on, Danault made his season debut for the Canadiens on Tuesday. Let’s take a look at what Danault had to say about this trade to the Canadiens. Phillip Danault has spoken for the first time since the Los Angeles Kings traded him to the Montreal Canadiens. In his statement, it seemed that the former LA Kings center wasn't pleased with the way he was handled ahead of his return to Montreal. Ahead of Danault's return to Montreal, he spoke to the media for the first time since the trade was announced and discussed what led to his departure.Speaking to mediapersons in French, Danault stated, ""I felt like I had no purpose and that I couldn't bring anything to the team with what I had. I felt helpless and not important. That's how I felt at the end.""Previously, while speaking to the NHL, he stated, ""I feel like chaos right now,"" Danault said. ""I am moving my kids, my wife, we have a house there, selling the house, everything. So a big change, for Christmas especially. But I feel good. It was obviously tough towards the end in L.A., and did not feel well at all.""Danault further expressed optimistically, ""So a good start, a good, fresh start for me. I'm really happy to be here. Went from the oldest group to the youngest in the NHL. It's kind of a weird stat, but it's true, and I'm happy to be one of the mature guys here.""Danault became the Canadiens' second-oldest player behind Brendan Gallagher after he was traded back to the team for whom he played from 2016-21. Earlier, Danault signed a six-year, $33 million contract ($5.5 million average annual value) with the Kings on July 28, 2021, and has one more year remaining after this season.According to the NHL, Danault had 194 points (54 goals, 140 assists) in 360 games when he played with the LA Kings.

Samoa Joe’s wrestling earnings, contracts, and overall net worth

All about Jessica Seanoa and their financial legacy

On a more personal note, the story of Nuufolau “Samoan Joe” Seanoa’s journey as a professional wrestler is exceptional. Yet Joe’s life with his wife, Jessica Seanoa, who also experienced the best and worst of Joe’s wrestling careers following the couple’s marriage back in 2007, reflects a world of its own. When considering the net worth of the married couple as of the year 2025, not only have the earnings from Joe’s wrestling contracts been considered, but the life that the couple has collectively experienced from the realities of the wrestling landscape also impacts the net worth as a whole.As of 2025, there are public estimates of Samoa Joe’s net worth, and they are estimated to be anywhere in the range of US$4 million to US$5 million, primarily generated from his extensive experience as a professional wrestler. Although in previous years, there were indications that his net worth would be higher in value, there are indications that his income is within the expected amount in the sport of professional wrestling, among those who are not among the best in the world. Joe has been earning money from his various contracts as a professional wrestler for TNA/Impact Wrestling, WWE, and currently for All Elite Wrestling (AEW), where he is still active as of 2025.Joe's professional income can thus be stated to be based on wrestling salaries, historically estimated to be around US$800,000 every year in WWE and possibly lower in his later contracts, and possibly supplemented by any acting engagements that come along due to his well-known name and quite eventful career. These acting roles might result in video game and TV-related roles that give Joe an occasional boost to his earnings.Jessica Seanoa has avoided the limelight of the wrestling world, living a private life with her husband. There is no known publicly available estimation of her net worth as an individual since she is not known within the public realm as a professional earner in her own right, but exists as a beneficiary of the life brought about through the wrestling career of her husband. Jessica married her husband in 2007.Taken together in 2025, their financial situation is centered on Joe’s wrestling career earnings and prudent decisions that come with age and a career that is physically demanding. Not one of the richest monikers in professional sports entertainment by any means, their experience is a reminder that a legacy is truly found in life after sports, and that finances in the sport look nothing like they do when one is under the bright lights that so many in other industries imagine.Also Read: Drew McIntyre and Kaitlyn Frohnapfel combined net worth in 2025: WWE success, fitness career, endorsement","As of 2025, there are public estimates of Samoa Joe’s net worth, and they are estimated to be anywhere in the range of US$4 million to US$5 million.

Hunt, on the other hand, has a quieter, multi-generational fortune that comes from heritage ownership.What is Jerry Jones' net worth?Forbes says that Jerry Jones is valued about $16.6 billion in 2025. The Dallas Cowboys, the most valuable team in all of sports, are where much of his money comes from. Forbes says the Cowboys are worth more than $13 billion right now, making them the first sports club to reach that level.Jones bought the Cowboys for $150 million in 1989, which at first made some doubt him. Over the years, he turned the team into a money-making machine by coming up with new ways to get sponsors for stadiums, sell merchandise, and offer premium seating. Jones has made a lot of money through oil and gas investments, especially his majority ownership in Comstock Resources. Those energy interests are now worth as much as, and in some years more than, the Cowboys' contribution to his wealth.What is Clark Hunt’s net worth?Clark Hunt's personal wealth is thought to be between $1.6 billion and $2 billion. The Hunt family's wealth as a whole is thought to be between $15 billion and $25 billion, depending on market conditions. Hunt did not buy his NFL franchise, unlike Jones. His father, Lamar Hunt Sr., started the Kansas City Chiefs. He was one of the people who helped create contemporary professional football and the American Football League.Clark Hunt owns around 25% of the Chiefs, which are worth nearly $6.2 billion right now. The franchise has had a lot of success on the field since Patrick Mahomes joined, but the money goes to different family members. The Hunt family's fortune comes mostly from oil and gas through Hunt Oil Company. They also have long-term stakes in real estate, hotels, and other sports teams, such as FC Dallas in Major League Soccer.Who wins: Clark Hunt or Jerry Jones?The difference in wealth between Jones and Hunt shows how they work. Jones is a businessman that is very hands-on and aggressive. He used debt, branding, and risk to grow his wealth. Hunt, on the other hand, runs a heritage business that puts stability, long-term growth, and shared family ownership first.In short, Jerry Jones is far richer than Clark Hunt, who is part of one of the richest families in the United States. Both methods have worked in the NFL, showing that there is more than one way to construct a sports empire.Both owners will get even richer as franchise valuations keep going up, but for now, the Cowboys owner is still in a class of his own when it comes to money.","Jerry Jones is one of the richest sports owners in the world as of 2025.

"Top 5 hardest homeruns to ever hit in MLB: Oneil Cruz, Giancarlo Stanton, Ronald Acuña Jr. and more",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/top-5-hardest-homeruns-to-ever-hit-in-mlb-oneil-cruz-giancarlo-stanton-ronald-acua-jr-and-more/articleshow/126181011.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Oneil Cruz: 122.9 mph against Milwaukee Brewers

Giancarlo Stanton: 121.7 mph against Texas Rangers

Giancarlo Stanton belts 449-ft. home run at 121.7 mph

Giancarlo Stanton: 121.3 mph against Washington Nationals

Ronald Acuña Jr.: 121.2 mph against Los Angeles Dodgers

Aaron Judge: 121.1 mph against Baltimore Orioles

Baseball has always been a sport filled with amazing moments, and few plays showcase that better than a home run. Ever since Statcast started tracking exit velocities in 2015, fans and analysts have had a fresh perspective to gauge the incredible force behind every swing. Although distance and trajectory often take center stage, exit velocity reveals the real tale of raw power, it shows how quickly the ball departs from the bat.In the last ten years, a few power hitters have changed the game by hitting baseballs with such force that it feels like they’re breaking the laws of physics, leaving fans in awe. Big names like Giancarlo Stanton and Aaron Judge are at the top of these stats, but players like Oneil Cruz and Ronald Acuña Jr. have also made their mark with swings that fans will never forget.Oneil‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ Cruz was the one who created a great moment in baseball history when he launched a solo homerun to the Milwaukee Brewers at PNC Park in Pittsburgh on May 25, 2025. The blast was so powerful that it was measured at a stunning 122.9 mph off the bat, thus recording the highest exit velocity of a home run in the Statcast era. As a matter of fact, it is also the hardest-hit batted ball and base hit which has been recorded since the tracking began in ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌2015.The scene was a midseason game for the Pirates, who were in the hunt for a wild-card spot in the National League. Cruz, famous for his impressive exit velocities over the years, had just hit a 117.9 mph homer two days earlier on May 23, and he made contact with a fastball from Brewers pitcher Freddy Peralta.The ball zipped over the left-field wall quickly, flying about 432 feet even with the high speed, which usually leads to shorter but straight-line paths. This hit broke past old records and showcased Cruz's special mix of strength and bat speed, honed during his days in the Pirates' minor leagues, where he was recorded throwing 105.3 mph from the outfield.On August 9, 2018, Giancarlo Stanton hit a massive 121.7 mph shot, landing him in second place during a home game against the Texas Rangers at Yankee Stadium. This two-run homer in the third inning off Doug Fister marked Stanton's third straight game with a home run, highlighting his position as the main power hitter for the New York Yankees that summer.The Yankees were deep in the AL East pennant chase, trailing only a few games behind their rivals, the Boston Red Sox. With Aaron Judge out due to a wrist chip fracture he got in late July, Stanton took on the offensive responsibility, hitting the ball with power.On a warm Bronx evening, the ball soared into the second deck of the left-field seats, traveling a distance that highlighted Stanton's incredible strength, which he developed during his time with the Marlins when he snagged the 2017 NL MVP award.Stanton makes another appearance at No. 3 with a massive 121.3 mph hit on July 25, 2020, against the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park. This solo home run happened during the Yankees' second game of the shortened 60-game season due to the pandemic, off a pitch from Nationals starter Erick Fedde in the fourth inning.New York was getting used to a hub-based schedule in Washington, D.C., while following COVID-19 protocols, as the team looked to bounce back from their 2019 ALCS exit. Stanton's home run almost equaled his personal best for hardest-hit homer at that moment, flying an estimated 483 feet, his longest since he joined the Yankees in December 2018 and the second-longest of his career. The projected trajectory brought back memories of his time in Miami, where he often hit bombs over 450 feet.On September 2, 2023, Ronald Acuña Jr. capped off the top four with a blazing 121.2 mph shot during a road game against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium. The Atlanta Braves outfielder crushed a fastball from Dodgers rookie Emmet Sheehan, sending it 454 feet to dead center in the sixth inning, a solo homer that contributed to a 6-1 win.The Braves were on track for their sixth consecutive NL East title, with Acuña just having made history on August 31 as the first player in MLB to hit 30 homers and steal 60 bases in a season—what's known as the ""30-60 club."" Just two days later, he hit another homer during a crucial interleague series against the NL West-leading Dodgers, highlighting Atlanta's offensive strength driven by Acuña, Matt Olson, and Austin Riley.Aaron Judge makes the top five with a massive 121.1 mph homer on June 10, 2017, against the Baltimore Orioles at Yankee Stadium. This three-run shot in the first inning off Orioles pitcher Chris Tillman capped off a rally that saw 10 Yankees come to the plate, resulting in an 8-1 blowout.The Yankees were on fire in the AL East, riding a wave of young talent during Judge's breakout rookie year, where he smashed 52 home runs and snagged the AL Rookie of the Year award. This home run came during what MLB.com called an 'offensive deluge,' as New York scored six runs in that inning to turn around an early deficit.Also Read: Chicago White Sox GM Chris Getz reveals how the team plans to address Munetaka Murakami’s high strikeout rate","Giancarlo Stanton, Oneil Cruz and Ronald Acuña Jr. are the top three home run hitters in baseball history.

Jaxson Dart vs Travis Hunter: What comes next for their careers and money

Jaxson Dart and Travis Hunter are two of the most talked-about young names in American football right now. Both made big money before even reaching the NFL. Their wealth comes mainly from college NIL deals, not pro contracts yet. One is a quarterback. The other plays both offense and defense. Their paths are different, but the money story is just as interesting. Here is a clear look at who has more wealth in 2025.Jaxson Dart plays quarterback for the Ole Miss Rebels. As of 2025, he is not an NFL player yet. He remains a top NFL Draft prospect, but no pro contract has been signed.Jaxson Dart’s estimated net worth in 2025 sits between $1.5 million and $2 million. This money comes from verified NIL deals during his college career.He partnered with brands connected to apparel, sports gear, and regional promotions. Quarterbacks often earn more attention, but Dart has kept a low profile off the field.In late 2024, he returned to Ole Miss instead of entering the NFL Draft. That decision delayed NFL money but kept his college earnings stable and safe.Travis Hunter plays for the Colorado Buffaloes. He is famous for playing both wide receiver and cornerback.As of 2025, he is also not yet in the NFL, but he is widely projected as a top draft pick.Travis Hunter net worth in 2025 is estimated between $5 million and $6 million. He signed deals with some brands like Adidas, United Airlines, and Panini America. These deals helped him be the highest paid athlete.In December 2024, Travis Hunter won the Heisman Trophy, which pushed his market value even higher.The biggest reason for the gap is brand power. Travis Hunter plays two positions and brings national attention every week. That makes him more valuable to sponsors.Jaxson Dart earns well for a college quarterback, but he does not have the same national ad reach yet. NFL money could change that later.Both players are expected to enter the 2025 NFL Draft. Once that happens, the money gap could shift fast. Quarterbacks often earn more long term.

Stephen Curry praises Cooper Flagg after Mavericks loss



Cooper Flagg performance shines on Christmas stage



Cooper Flagg’s first Christmas Day appearance puts him under immense pressure. The Dallas Mavericks rookie did not lose his cool despite the team being hit with a major Anthony Davis injury setback. Flagg delivered his most complete performance on one of the league’s biggest stages against the veteran Golden State Warriors team.The Mavericks fell 126-116 in San Francisco, but Flagg’s impact stood out well beyond the final score. His composure, shot selection, and control in traffic drew attention throughout the game. After the final buzzer, Stephen Curry offered some kind words for Flagg.Stephen Curry, who led the Warriors with 23 points and sealed the game late with a deep three-pointer, took time after the game to recognize Cooper Flagg’s presence and mindset.""Just a true hooper. Competitor. He forgets how young he is. The future is bright, I'm glad that he got this experience his first year. The league is in good hands,"" Curry said after the game.Curry hit nine free throws and navigated defensive pressure, while Flagg matched him possession for possession during key moments. Golden State leaned on balanced scoring, including 14 points from Al Horford and 16 from DeAnthony Melton, to secure its third straight win.Flagg finished with a game-high 27 points on 13-for-21 shooting, adding six rebounds and a team-leading five assists in his Christmas Day debut. He scored at all three levels, attacked closeouts, and created opportunities when Golden State’s defense tightened. His lone three-pointer came within the flow of the offense, and his decision-making kept Dallas within reach during key stretches.The Mavericks faced challenges early after Anthony Davis exited in the second quarter with right groin spasms. With Dallas losing a primary option, Flagg assumed added responsibility. During a prolonged second-half run where the Warriors struggled from deep, Dallas trimmed the deficit to six points with 4:28 remaining. Flagg’s poise fueled that push, even as Golden State ultimately regained control behind timely plays from Curry and Gary Payton II.Dallas made only four three-pointers as a team and was outscored heavily from beyond the arc. Even so, Flagg’s efficiency and command helped stabilize the offense. P.J. Washington recorded 14 points and 10 rebounds, while Brandon Williams added 26 off the bench.Also Read: Karl-Anthony Towns makes Jordyn Woods’ Christmas unforgettable with a skyline proposal","Stephen Curry praises Cooper Flagg after Mavericks loss to Golden State Warriors.

A Father's Pride: How RR, Dravid & Vikram Shaped Vaibhav Suryavanshi

NEW DELHI: Vaibhav Sooryavanshi created history with a stunning performance in the Vijay Hazare Trophy on Wednesday. Playing for Bihar in their first Plate Group match of the 2025–26 season, the 14-year-old opener produced one of the most remarkable innings ever seen in domestic cricket Sooryavanshi smashed 190 runs from just 84 balls against Arunachal Pradesh. He opened the batting for the Sakibul Gani-led Bihar side and completely dominated the bowlers from the start.During his explosive knock, he hit 16 fours and 15 sixes, showing confidence and power well beyond his age.With this innings, Sooryavanshi achieved a unique world record. He became the first men’s cricketer in history to score centuries in both List A and T20 cricket before turning 15. The youngster from Samastipur has already made headlines earlier by becoming the youngest player to score a century in the IPL and T20 cricket.On Wednesday, he added another milestone to his growing list of achievements.At 14 years and 272 days, Sooryavanshi became the youngest batter to score a century in men’s List A cricket.He broke a long-standing record held by Pakistan’s Zahoor Elahi, who was 15 years and 209 days old when he scored an unbeaten 103 in 1986.Sooryavanshi reached his century in just 36 balls against Arunachal Pradesh.At that moment, it was the second-fastest List A hundred by an Indian batter. However, by the end of the day, his effort slipped to fourth place after Sakibul Gani and Ishan Kishan scored even faster centuries in 32 and 33 balls respectively.The young batter was not done even after reaching his hundred. He raced to 150 runs in just 59 balls, breaking another major record. This effort helped him surpass AB de Villiers’ record for the fastest 150 in List A cricket. De Villiers had taken 64 balls to reach the mark during the 2015 ODI World Cup match between South Africa and West Indies.Sooryavanshi’s knock played a huge role in Bihar posting a massive total, which later became a world record score of 574 in List A cricket. His fearless approach and record-breaking innings have once again underlined why he is seen as one of the brightest young talents in Indian cricket.","Vaibhav Sooryavanshi scored 190 runs from just 84 balls against Arunachal Pradesh.

NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has raised concerns about the quality gap between teams in Indian domestic cricket after a one-sided match in the Vijay Hazare Trophy.His comments came after Bihar scored a massive 574 runs (their highest team total in men’s List A cricket) in 50 overs against Arunachal Pradesh.Ashwin said that while big scores are impressive, such matches do not offer real competition.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ashwin praised young batter Vaibhav Sooryavanshi for his performance but questioned the bigger picture.“Huge applause for Vaibhav Sooryavanshi. But I again want to ask a question. There is a huge divide, chalk and cheese, in terms of quality with some teams. It becomes very lop-sided with some teams and there is no contest at all,"" Ashwin said.""It is not an ideal contest. Credit to Vaibhav for his performance. He is doing what he has to do. But if we are serious about teams like Arunachal Pradesh becoming good sides, what will this do to their confidence?""In the match, Bihar completely dominated Arunachal Pradesh.Along with Sooryavanshi (190 off 84 balls), Ayush Loharuka (116 off 56 balls) and captain Sakibul Gani (128 off 40 balls) also scored centuries.Ashwin also spoke about Ishan Kishan and praised his comeback journey. He said Kishan’s recent success shows the importance of hard work and patience.“Everyone goes through good and bad times but Ishan Kishan had a challenging time. He came and then was out from the team, he took a break. He made a double hundred in one-day but never made a comeback. He scored a hundred in the IPL but then did not have a great IPL,"" Ashwin added.""He played well in the SMAT and in the run of events got into the T20 World Cup squad. Now he is batting in the middle-order slot in the VHT and scored a 33-ball hundred. It shows what confidence and form can do to a person when time aligns. He has not waited saying his time will come, he has put in that effort.""",Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has raised concerns about the quality gap between teams in Indian domestic cricket.

Poll How important do you think MS Dhoni's guidance was for Jharkhand's victory in the SMAT 2025? Extremely important Somewhat important Not important

NEW DELHI: Jharkhand won their maiden Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy title this year under the leadership of dynamic wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan , but it has now emerged that former India captain MS Dhoni ’s quiet guidance played a key role in transforming a rebuilding side into national champions.Following Jharkhand's victory over Haryana in the SMAT 2025 final, former India spinner Shahbaz Nadeem has disclosed that Dhoni was deeply involved throughout the campaign, staying in constant touch with both management and players. Jharkhand lifted only their second-ever major domestic title earlier this month, and, according to Nadeem, the foundations were laid long before the first ball was bowled.“When we started the season, right from the appointment of the coaching staff, we have always taken his (Dhoni's) advice and suggestions,” Nadeem told ESPNcricinfo. “He followed the entire [SMAT] tournament, noted all the strengths and weaknesses of the players and discussed with us.”Now serving as joint secretary of the Jharkhand State Cricket Association (JSCA), Nadeem revealed that Dhoni actively contributed to the restructuring of Jharkhand cricket, advocating stability and local knowledge over external appointments. Acting on Dhoni's advice, JSCA appointed Ratan Kumar — a long-time age-group coach within the system — as head coach, with Sunny Gupta named bowling coach.Dhoni's involvement went far beyond broad guidance. “He knows the stats and numbers of each domestic player from Jharkhand,” Nadeem said. “He is very interested in helping Jharkhand cricket grow.”That commitment has deep roots. Dhoni last played for Jharkhand in 2015 and, despite retiring from international cricket in August 2020, has remained closely connected to the state that shaped his journey.Even those inside the camp were surprised by how quickly success arrived. “We thought we would take the first year in building the team,” head coach Ratan admitted. “But when I saw this bunch play T20 cricket, they were playing on a different plane.”The Nadeem–Saurabh Tiwary administration also introduced performance-linked incentives for coaches — another Dhoni-backed move — reinforcing accountability and belief.",Jharkhand won their maiden Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy title earlier this month.

Golden State Warriors injury situation vs Dallas Mavericks (December 25, 2025)

What this means on the floor

Key things to watch in tonight's Dallas Mavericks vs Golden State Warriors showdown (December 25, 2025)

The Dallas Mavericks visit the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day at Chase Center in a game shaped by injuries on both sides. Tip-off is scheduled for 5 p.m. ET, with national coverage on ABC and ESPN. What was expected to be a star-driven holiday matchup now leans heavily on rotations, minutes management, and which team can hold up with limited options.Dallas Mavericks arrive short-handed and under pressure. Golden State Warriors aren’t fully healthy either, but the Warriors enter with more lineup stability and the benefit of playing at home. With the Warriors listed as 8.5-point favorites and the total projected near 229, the focus shifts from names to execution.The Dallas Mavericks are missing major pieces. Kyrie Irving remains out following left knee surgery and is not close to returning. Dereck Lively II is also out for the season after right foot surgery, removing Dallas’ main rim protector and interior finisher.Dante Exum is sidelined for the year after right knee surgery, further thinning the guard rotation. Max Christie is questionable due to illness, while P.J. Washington is questionable with right midfoot soreness.There is some relief: Klay Thompson is probable despite left knee soreness, along with Dwight Powell (illness) and Brandon Williams (right ankle sprain).Golden State will be without Seth Curry, who is dealing with right thigh and toe soreness. Al Horford is also out with right sciatic nerve irritation and is expected back later in December. Jonathan Kuminga is questionable due to illness, which could affect Golden State’s wing depth and defensive flexibility.Even with those absences, the Warriors remain favored, largely due to system continuity and home-court results at Chase Center.Dallas Mavericks' loss change how the game is played. Without Irving and Lively, the Mavericks lose ball security, secondary scoring, and rim protection. That puts a heavy load on Anthony Davis, who is expected to handle high usage while Dallas continues to average 15.1 turnovers per game.That plays into Golden State’s strengths. The Golden State Warriors attempt a league-high 43.8 three-pointers per game, with 41.8 percent of their scoring coming from beyond the arc. Dallas’ second-quarter struggles only add to that concern.Davis will be asked to keep pace with a Stephen Curry-led offense without Irving alongside him. If Kuminga sits and Washington plays, the frontcourt matchup becomes more open. If not, expect smaller lineups and long shooting stretches.This Christmas Day game may be missing full rosters, but it still offers a clear test of depth, discipline, and who can manage chaos better over four quarters.","The Dallas Mavericks visit the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day at Chase Center in a game shaped by injuries on both sides.

Evan Mobley set to return for Cleveland Cavaliers’ Christmas Day clash vs New York Knicks

Evan Mobley was sidelined for weeks as Cleveland Cavaliers deal with growing injury concerns

According to Shams Charania of ESPN, Mobley (calf) will participate in Thursday's game against the Knicks. The Cleveland Cavaliers will play the New York Knicks on the road on Christmas Day on Thursday afternoon. The Cavaliers are currently below the play-in line in the Eastern Conference due to their recent struggles.But they're hopeful that this Christmas game would give them a chance to gain momentum and turn their season around. Mobley's availability for Christmas was doubtful when he was first classified as questionable against the Knicks.On Christmas Day, the Cleveland Cavaliers will play the New York Knicks, and one of their key players might return. Due to a left calf issue, Evan Mobley has missed the last few games. Many questioned whether he would be able to play against New York.He was initially expected to be sidelined for two to four weeks, but he is still listed as injured due to the strain. But the team received a good report on his condition for the game just before Thursday's tip-off.“Cleveland Cavaliers All-Star Evan Mobley (calf strain) will return to action Christmas Day against the New York Knicks (12 pm ET, ABC/ESPN), per sources. Mobley, who has been out 13 days, is averaging career highs 19.1 points and 4.1 assists to go with 9.3 rebounds per game…”The number of calf strains in the league has increased this season, and teams are worried about how their players will heal because they could result in an Achilles injury.Despite missing five games due to a Grade 1 left calf injury, Mobley will be back for the Cavaliers' Christmas Day game. Before the injury, the big man was playing at a consistently high level, averaging 19.5 points, 10.3 rebounds, 4.3 assists, and 1.9 blocks in his ten prior games. He is now having a career-high scoring season.Dean Wade will continue to start, and Mobley will likely be on a minutes restriction and come off the bench. The Cavaliers will be thrilled to have Mobley back in action against the Knicks, who have been playing fiercely lately and are vying with the Detroit Pistons for the top seed in the Eastern Conference.Given the presence of Knicks big man Karl-Anthony Towns, who recently scored 40 points in a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Mobley will be particularly important.Due to a calf issue, Cleveland Cavaliers forward Evan Mobley is anticipated to miss two to four weeks starting on December 13. The organization reports that Mobley will miss two to four weeks due to a Grade 1 left calf injury sustained during Friday's victory over the Wizards.After a postgame assessment of the area's tightness, the injury was found. The issue was confirmed by an MRI on Saturday. The Cavaliers, who were the top seed in the Eastern Conference the previous season but have been plagued by ailments for the majority of this season, suffered yet another setback with the injury.This season, Mobley has averaged 19.1 points, 9.3 rebounds, and 4.1 assists. This season, he has only missed one game. In addition to Mobley, injuries are plaguing center Jarrett Allen (finger), Sam Merrill (right hand), Larry Nance Jr. (right calf), and Max Strus (left foot).

“probably never have kids,”

“sad”

MrBeast weighs in as Valkyrae discourse takes over social media amid kids and motherhood debate

“who cares, she can do what she wants, it has 0 impact on us.”





Valkyrae recently found herself at the center of online controversy after a short clip from one of her streams went viral on social media. In the clip, the popular streamer said that for the rest of her life she willfocus on playing video games, stay attractive, and continue making money. She framed the comment as a personal preference and a reflection of where she sees her life heading. However, the clip quickly became a talking point across platforms like X, drawing strong reactions from both critics and supporters.As the clip spread, many users began offering opinions on Valkyrae’s choices, with some calling her outlookor predicting she would end up lonely. Others defended her right to choose a career-focused life without marriage or children. The debate soon moved beyond Valkyrae herself and turned into a broader argument about women, motherhood, and what society expects from successful women. This reaction also followed a familiar pattern, as Valkyrae has previously sparked similar debates whenever she has discussed kids or family on stream in past years.Amid the growing discourse, MrBeast reacted to one of the viral posts discussing Valkyrae’s comments.Rather than taking a strong position for or against her lifestyle, he criticized the outrage itself.Responding to the debate, MrBeast wrote that he was tired of seeing posts about it and questioned why it mattered at all. In his words,His response echoed a wider frustration with how personal choices often turn into public arguments online.MrBeast’s response changed the tone of the conversation. Instead of people picking apart Valkyrae’s personal choice, his take made many step back and ask a bigger question, why did her private plans become such a huge public debate in the first place? A lot of users agreed with him, saying that decisions about having children are incredibly personal and not something random strangers online should be weighing in on.What started as a simple comment from Valkyrae about her own life quickly turned into a reminder of how easily the internet can turn private choices into public controversy. MrBeast’s reaction cut through that noise, pointing out that not every viral moment needs a moral judgment and that some decisions truly only matter to the person making them.Also Read: Who was Epic Gamer Grandma?

“too complicated”

“They are very much applying lessons they’ve learned in China to the rest of the world. And there’s good and bad or pros and cons or to that. One of the pros is they had a massive faith in the

short-form video

format, long before anybody else did. The flip side is: The ‘super apps,’ which are very popular in China, are not popular in the same way outside of China, and I think they’re turning into a Chinese super app. And that may or may not work outside of China. Are they overly projecting one win on the next, or am I just a naive out-of-touch Westerner who’s underestimating where the future’s gonna be? That’ll be interesting to see how that plays out.”

“We’re going to learn a lot,”

“I’m sure we’ll get a bunch of things wrong, but we’re gonna iterate quickly.”

“It might turn out that maybe we’ll need premium content to work. It might be that we need long-form video. And then if we need long-form video, what does that mean for us? Because that’s literally been a market we’ve explicitly decided not to enter,”

“fundamentally different.”

“Some of these new technologies should evolve in a way that you can kind of touch metal, where you can go in there and just tell it what you want, or make it what you want, whether that is shaping [your] feed to give you what you’re interested in or going deep in search to understand something, or creating something and being able to really mold it into what you want more proactively — I think that’s gonna happen over the next two to four years,”

“For a visual platform, [being] in a medium where you probably want most of your interactions with your smart glasses to be audio-only is a much bigger, more open question that we need to think about,”

Godfather of AI Yoshua Bengio’s career advice





Godfather of AI Yoshua Bengio recently admitted that the moment he truly started worrying about artificial intelligence (AI) was not decades into the future, but in 2023 after the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Bengio appeared on The Diary Of A CEO podcast hosted by Steven Bartlett where he was asked why an introverted scientist was suddenly stepping into the public eye to talk about AI risks. To this, the Turing Award–winning “Godfather of AI” replied saying “Because I have to. Because since ChatGPT came out, I realized that we were on a dangerous path and I needed to speak.” He continued: “I needed to raise awareness about what could happen, but also to give hope that there are some paths that we could choose in order to mitigate those catastrophic risks.”“What was it about ChatGPT that caused your mind to change?,” the host asked. Bengio replied saying that before ChatGPT, “most my colleagues and myself thought it would take many more decades before we would have machines that actually understand language.”Explaining further, the AI scientist continued: “Alan Turing, founder of the field in 1950, thought that once we have machines that understand language, we might be doomed because they would be as intelligent as us.He wasn’t quite right. So we have machines now that understand language, but they lag in other ways, like planning.”Stating that the AI bots are not a real threat for now, Yoshua Bengio reiterated “but they could be in a few years or a decade or two.”“So it is that realization that we were building something that could become potentially a competitor to humans or that could be giving huge power to whoever controls it and destabilizing our world, threatening our democracy. So all of these scenarios suddenly came to me in the early weeks of 2023, and I realized that I had to do something, everything I could about it,” he said.When asked about jobs getting replaced by AI and career advice for the future generation, Bengio advised to “Work on the beautiful human being that you can become. I think that that part of ourselves will persist even if machines can do most of the jobs"".Continuing further, Bengio said “there will be jobs where we want to have people. If I’m in a hospital, I want a human being to hold my hand while I’m anxious or in pain. The human touch is going to, I think, take more and more value as the other skills become more and more automated.”","Yoshua Bengio, the Godfather of AI, spoke on The Diary Of A CEO podcast.
