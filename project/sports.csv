NHL Trade Rumors: Erik Karlsson linked to Detroit Red Wings amid talks with Pittsburgh Penguins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-erik-karlsson-linked-to-detroit-red-wings-amid-talks-with-pittsburgh-penguins/articleshow/122302958.cms,"Erik Karlsson linked to Detroit Red Wings amid talks with Pittsburgh Penguins (Image Via Getty)

Erik Karlsson could be the answer to the evolution of the Red Wings' defense

Trade talks between the Detroit Red Wings and the Pittsburgh Penguins have become serious due to the inclusion of the name of defenseman Erik Karlsson. With the talks still ongoing, it is seemingly becoming more and more likely that this veteran defenseman will be granted a new environment before the coming NHL season. Both organizations sit at critical junctures: Detroit dreaming of ending a playoff drought, and Pittsburgh faced with an aging core and very tight salary cap flexibility. With Karlsson's gigantic $92 million contract still intact, the salary retention by Pittsburgh might be what deters the deal, and might just also seal it.Erik Karlsson, having won the Norris Trophy twice, is a veteran in the twilight of his career, but is still respected throughout the league. He showed that last year, recording 53 points, 11 of which were goals and averaging over 23 minutes of ice-time per game, showing his ability and stamina. Meanwhile, the Red Wings had trouble generating offense from the defensive end on a consistent basis. Their power play was good, yet on even strength, they were almost impotent offensively, and by the time they started to crack defensively, it had cost them a postseason ticket for this year.If Karlsson were to enter Detroit, he could take on a mentor role for up-and-coming talents Moritz Seider and Simon Edvinsson by instilling calm, excellent puck movement, and veteran leadership into the young and upward-moving defense corps. The team has already spurned a different direction in hiring Todd McLellan as its head coach, and with General Manager Steve Yzerman still handling the rebuild, might a trade for Karlsson indicate a transition from long-term planning to short-term window?Trading Karlsson may be more of a roster move for the Penguins. His $11.5 million cap hit is an onerous burden for a team that has failed to make the playoffs for a second straight year. Although Sidney Crosby is still producing, the roster as a whole offered little to back him up and to balance around him. The younger players never truly stepped up to their expectations, and the front office now has some harsh decisions to make about which direction it will take.Also Read: Why Steven Stamkos, Jonathan Marchessault and Justus Annunen are giving trouble to the Nashville Predators Though never written in stone, Karlsson trade rumors ever so strongly suggested the intentions of the two franchises: Detroit wishes to retool with mainly experienced talent, while Pittsburgh appears ready to shed some salary and prepare for a slight reset. The moment the trade passes through, it might very well rank among the deepest contours that will carve the NHL off-season for both franchises.",Detroit Red Wings and Pittsburgh Penguins in trade talks for Erik Karlsson.

Blake Lively’s legal feud sparks the end of an A-list friendship

In a shocking celebrity fallout, Taylor Swift and NFL star Travis Kelce have reportedly ended their longtime friendship with Hollywood power couple Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds . According to insider sources, the Eras Tour singer has grown increasingly disillusioned with Lively’s drama—especially following the legal chaos surrounding the ""It Ends With Us"" movie and Blake’s co-star, Justin Baldoni This once-glamorous friendship of Swift and Lively, adored by fans and paparazzi alike, has now dissolved into silence, unfollows, and a sense of betrayal that neither Taylor Swift nor Travis Kelce appear ready to forgive.The tension reportedly began after actress Blake Lively filed a lawsuit against Baldoni in December 2024, accusing him of sexual harassment and retaliation. In response, Baldoni counter-sued and subpoenaed Taylor Swift—a move that blindsided the singer, who had zero involvement with the film.Taylor's team was quick to clear the air, stating: “Taylor Swift never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, she did not score the film, she never saw an edit or made any notes on the film, she did not even see ‘It Ends With Us’ until weeks after its public release.”Following this, Justin Baldoni’s legal team dropped the subpoena. But the damage, it seems, had already been done.A source close to Swift told the Daily Mail that Taylor now recognizes all the “red flags” in her friendship with Lively. “When Taylor looks back at their friendship, she realises it wasn’t worth all the stress Blake put her through,” the insider shared. “She can now see all the red flags that should have been a warning to her.”Even Travis Kelce, who once shared friendly ties with Reynolds, has reportedly distanced himself. He recently unfollowed the Deadpool star on Instagram, signaling a united front with Swift. “Taylor and Travis are disgusted with Blake and Ryan and how they tried to use Taylor in their fight against Justin Baldoni,” the insider added.According to those close to the couple, this break is not temporary. “They’re vowing their break from the acting couple is permanent,” the source said.With her whirlwind tour, growing relationship with Travis Kelce, and constant media scrutiny, Taylor Swift is choosing peace—and dropping the drama, no matter how star-studded it may be.Also Read: Travis Kelce forced to give up gross habit—has dating Taylor Swift completely changed who he is?","Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have reportedly ended their longtime friendship with Hollywood power couple Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds.

A legacy with something to prove returns for a third try at DCC

Emotional fallout, a strained friendship, and a quiet comeback

Dayton Bramhall's journey with the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders has been anything but easy — and her story has become one of the most emotional arcs in Season 2 of Netflix's America’s Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. A third-time auditionee and daughter of longtime DCC associate choreographer Shelly Bramhall, Dayton came into the 2024 training camp with the weight of a legacy and the pressure to finally make the team. But after once again being cut, the young dancer made a decision that would redefine her identity beyond the DCC brand.Raised in McKinney, Texas, Dayton Bramhall has been immersed in the world of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders her entire life. Her mother, Shelly, was part of the DCC class of 1989 and has served as a key figure on the staff for years. That connection, however, didn’t secure Dayton a spot. “None of us want you to make this team just because you have a history,” director Kelli Finglass told her bluntly. “You need to earn to make this team. ”Despite showing improvement and passion during her audition, Dayton Bramhall struggled with memorizing choreography and keeping up with the precision and power expected at the elite level.“There’s one that just won’t stick in my body, but I’ll get it,” she said during training camp. Unfortunately, the veterans didn’t believe she was ready — and Finglass ultimately told her it would be a “disservice to have you make this team and the struggle be all year. ”While Dayton took the cut with grace, the decision left ripples in her personal life. Her mother Shelly admitted, “That was hard because we were friends. If anything, I wasn’t hurt by her not making it, I was way more hurt by Kelli and Judy.” Despite the tension, Dayton chose to tell her mom herself, showing maturity beyond her years.She returned in 2025 for another shot — but was cut again before training camp. In a heartfelt comment on TikTok, Dayton wrote, “I did EVERYTHING they asked of me and tried my absolute best to fit their mold. I’m not wanted there and I’m hoping this takes me to where I truly belong.”Also Read: Where is Armani Latimer now?

Potential Outcomes for Lillard and the New York Knicks

Scenario Outcome Worst-case



Lillard misses the entire season, becomes an unrestricted free agent in 2026



Best-case



Lillard returns post-All-Star break, giving the Knicks a historic bargain





What’s Next for the New York Knicks?

The Milwaukee Bucks ' decision to part ways withsent shockwaves through the NBA. While the move was aimed at keeping Giannis Antetokounmpo content, Lillard now faces a pivotal career choice—and thehave surprisingly entered the conversation as a potential landing spot.According to The Daily News, the New York Knicks present an ideal scenario for Lillard, who is recovering from a ruptured Achilles. The team’s strong medical staff and recent health record make them a viable option for the veteran guard’s rehabilitation.As The Daily News noted: “The Knicks were the healthiest team in all of basketball last season. Damian Lillard needs somewhere to rehab... The Knicks could sign Lillard, who will continue to collect checks from the Milwaukee Bucks after they waived him from the roster and stretched the balance of his contract over five years, and help a Top-75 player return from a ruptured Achilles.” (H/t: Sporting News)The On-Court Challenges of a Lillard-Brunson BackcourtWhile adding a 24.9 PPG scorer like Lillard is enticing, there are legitimate concerns:- Defensive Vulnerabilities: Pairing Lillard with Jalen Brunson would create a small backcourt, making them an easy target for opposing offenses.- Rotation Adjustments: The Knicks would need a clear plan to mitigate defensive weaknesses, possibly through strong help defense from their forwards.Despite these hurdles, the opportunity to acquire a player of Lillard’s caliber at a discount is rare.New York’s front office must weigh the risks and rewards carefully. If Lillard recovers well, he could elevate the Knicks into true championship contention. However, if his injury lingers, the move could backfire.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Boston Celtics might acquire $32 million Houston Rockets star to support Jayson Tatum and improve title odds One thing is certain—the Knicks are exploring bold options this offseason, and a Damian Lillard signing would be their most shocking move yet.

If New York believes in their medical staff’s ability to rehab him, this gamble could pay off massively. One thing’s clear—the Knicks aren’t afraid to make bold moves this offseason.","Milwaukee Bucks waived Damian Lillard to make way for Giannis Antetokounmpo.

THIS Unexpected NFL Wedding Detail Has Fans Convinced Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce Tied the Knot

2025 has been a pretty tough year for Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce



Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift have maintained a low profile about their Fourth of July celebrations even though the billionaire popstar has always been known to have the biggest parties at her Rhode Island mansion along with her celebrity friends. Just a few days ago, Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift were spotted in Cleveland, and now some insights about their relationship’s current state have been revealed.As per the Daily Mail, a source has revealed that regarding the Fourth of July celebrations, Taylor Swift was “not looking to broadcast that she is having a big get-together or party. And there is good reason for her not to…Taylor has had quite the year.”Another source had previously revealed to the Daily Mail about how Taylor Swift has been spending all her time with Travis Kelce.The source said, “She is happy laying low, working on music, hanging out with Travis, hanging out with family, catching up on life since she was on tour for so long,' an insider told the Daily Mail earlier this year…[Kelce] gives her massages…”Not having any public for Fourth of July has shocked fans as Taylor Swift has always been focused on spending this day with her close family and friends and posting about it on social media.But 2025 has been a pretty awkward year for the billionaire pop star after she started the year with her name being attached to the infamous legal drama between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni.Two months later, in February 2025, Taylor Swift got booed when she went to attend the Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles, as her boyfriend, Travis Kelce’s team was losing.With all the controversies surrounding the billionaire pop star, it makes sense for her to keep her life away from the public eye and probably have an intimate celebration with Travis Kelce and his family in Ohio, much away from the public eye.Also Read: “Travis could roll out of bed and still win”: Taylor Swift's ex Joe Alwyn gets brutally trolled as fans crown Travis Kelce the pop star's ""best-looking boyfriend""",Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have maintained a low profile about their Fourth of July celebrations.

Carolina Hurricanes’ offer sheet pressure forced the Edmonton Oilers to move quickly on Evan Bouchard deal

Edmonton Oilers take swift action to avoid repeating last summer’s costly offer sheet losses

In a surprising twist this offseason, the Edmonton Oilers moved quickly to secure defenseman Evan Bouchard with a lucrative four-year extension worth $10.5 million annually. While many viewed it as a smart long-term move, recent reports suggest the decision wasn’t entirely strategic, it was reactive. According to Elliotte Friedman, the Carolina Hurricanes forced Edmonton’s hand by threatening to submit an offer sheet for Bouchard, escalating contract talks dramatically.According to Friedman’s report, newly appointed Hurricanes general manager Eric Tulsky considered extending an offer sheet to Evan Bouchard, an aggressive but legal tactic rarely used in the NHL. While the Edmonton Oilers likely had every intention of matching any offer, the idea of entering another public contract standoff was enough to prompt them to lock Bouchard down quickly and avoid the risk.The move comes just a year after the Oilers lost two young players, Dylan Holloway and Philip Broberg after they declined to match competing offer sheets. That experience left the organization wary of any further vulnerability. With Bouchard being their only remaining restricted free agent susceptible to an offer sheet, Edmonton acted decisively to avoid another offseason distraction.Carolina’s use of the offer sheet threat wasn’t limited to Edmonton.Friedman also reported that the Hurricanes explored a similar tactic with the New York Rangers involving defenseman K’Andre Miller. However, instead of battling it out, Carolina worked out a deal directly with Miller, who ultimately signed a long-term contract with the Hurricanes.For the Oilers, the memory of losing two rising talents without compensation likely fueled a no-nonsense approach this time around. With Evan Bouchard now secured through the 2028–29 season, Edmonton can enter the upcoming campaign without further offer sheet worries hanging over them.The Carolina Hurricanes’ bold negotiation tactics served as a wake-up call for the Edmonton Oilers. Rather than risk another offseason filled with uncertainty and potential player loss, the team ensured Evan Bouchard remained part of their long-term plans. With this major contract now behind them, the Oilers can focus fully on their 2025–26 goals without fear of another offer sheet surprise.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Montreal Canadiens still targeting Jordan Kyrou in potential blockbuster deal","Carolina Hurricanes’ offer sheet pressure forced the Edmonton Oilers to move quickly on Evan Bouchard deal.

The missing fifth: Moss sparks a fan firestorm



A simple tweet from Hall of Famer Randy Moss has set off the fiercest quarterback debate of the NFL offseason. While casually discussing the top five QBs with his son, Moss named four superstars and left the fifth spot open to the public. What followed was a firestorm of hot takes, rankings, and fan wars across social media platforms. With the 2025 season looming, the question of who makes the league’s “Fab Five” is hotter than ever.“Me and my son at lunch trying to pick top 5 QBs…” Moss posted. “Mahomes Jackson Allen Burrow in no order. Who's the 5th?”Patrick Mahomes leads the pack, and rightfully so. With three Super Bowl rings, two MVPs, and an 89–23 record, he’s in a league of his own. His career already includes 245 passing touchdowns and the fastest climb to 30,000 yards. Simply put—Mahomes isn’t playing football; he’s rewriting it.Lamar Jackson brings electricity every time he touches the field. In 2024, he became the first-ever QB with 4,000+ pass yards and 800+ rushing yards in a season. He holds two MVP awards and the most rushing yards ever by a QB (6,173). His dual-threat dominance is unmatched in NFL history.Josh Allen continues to redefine physical quarterbacking. Standing 6'5"", the 2024 MVP has five straight seasons with 40+ total touchdowns. Known for his bruising runs and deep-ball heroics, Allen once recorded three passing and three rushing TDs in a single game. Even Tom Brady called his game “frightening.”Joe Burrow, calm and clinical, is the technician of the group. After wrist surgery, he led the league in passing yards (4,918) and touchdowns (43) in 2024. His 70.6% completion rate now stands as the highest in NFL history. “He plays the position the way it was intended,” Chris Simms once said.The real storm lies in who deserves that final elite slot. Fans flooded replies with names like Justin Herbert, C.J. Stroud, Jalen Hurts, Dak Prescott, and Aaron Rodgers. The debate exposed biases, loyalty, and the razor-thin margins at the top of the league.Also read: NFL star Dak Prescott is quietly facing the biggest career reckoning of his Cowboys era For Moss, it was likely just a fun father-son moment.

Shubman Gill, Gautam Gambhir shut critics with thumping win over England

Poll Will India's bowling attack be more effective with Bumrah back in the lineup? Yes, definitely No, they are fine as is

India's thumping 336-run victory over England at Edgbaston has breathed fresh life into the five-Test series, now locked at 1-1. As the caravan moves to the hallowed turf of Lord’s for the third Test starting July 10, talk has already begun around team combinations and the challenge of facing what Stuart Broad ominously called a “dangerous” Indian bowling unit.“This Indian bowling attack would worry me if I was in that England batting lineup,” Broad said during a Sky Sports panel discussion following India’s historic win. “The ball just nips down that slope at Lord’s. Akash Deep brings the stumps into play, and if it swings, Bumrah will be lethal with the late movement.”Shubman Gill’s youthful Indian team, still riding the high of their first-ever Test win at Edgbaston, appear settled and confident. Gill led from the front with a match tally of 430 runs (269 and 161), while Akash Deep stepped up in Jasprit Bumrah’s absence, claiming a stunning 10-wicket haul.With Bumrah set to return, former England captain Mark Butcher speculated that India are unlikely to make many changes. “Bumrah will come back, and the rest will stay the same,” Butcher said.Former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara agreed, noting, “[Mohammed] Siraj and Akash Deep will play.Prasidh Krishna might make way for Bumrah. And they’ll probably retain Washington Sundar at No. 8 for the balance he offers.”On England’s side, the focus is on refreshing their misfiring pace attack. “[Chris] Woakes hasn’t had great success and was unlucky, but his Lord’s record is outstanding,” Broad noted. He also voiced caution about rushing in Jofra Archer or Gus Atkinson without recent match fitness.“England play well at Lord’s,” Broad added, “but this Indian attack — especially with Bumrah back — could pose a serious threat.”As the third Test looms, it’s India’s revitalised pace battery, not just their record-breaking captain, that now has England on high alert.","India beat England by 336 runs in the second Test at Edgbaston. The series is now level at 1-1, with the third Test at Lord's starting on July 10.

Could 2025 be the last dance for Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes?

Patrick Mahomes remains unwavering in support as Travis Kelce’s future hangs in balance

Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, and Select Chiefs Players Speak with the Media | JUNE 18, 2025

The Kansas City Chiefs may be entering the most emotionally charged season of the Patrick Mahomes-Travis Kelce era. While Mahomes’ legacy continues to rise, the looming possibility of Travis Kelce retiring after the 2025 season casts a shadow over what might be the final act of one of the NFL’s most iconic quarterback-tight end duos.Travis Kelce, who has one year remaining on his contract, hasn’t made a definitive retirement announcement—but all signs point to the 2025 campaign potentially being his curtain call. The 34-year-old tight end, who has been Mahomes’ go-to weapon since 2018, continues to be a vital cog in Kansas City’s offense despite a slight dip in production in recent seasons.Even with whispers of retirement growing louder, Mahomes made it clear this offseason that his faith in Kelce remains unchanged. “I expect Travis to be Travis,” Mahomes said confidently.“Obviously, the play on the field's going to be high. He's going to go out there with the mentality that we're trying to win the Super Bowl this year with us falling short this last year. Then, I think more than anything, it's the leadership that he brings to the building every single day.”That leadership is precisely what sets Kelce apart—not just his ability to find soft spots in coverage or his chemistry with Mahomes, but his presence in the locker room.Mahomes added, “How he leads by example and how he leads vocally, it's a big impact on our football team, so I expect him to play at a high level and then be an even better leader.”Since the Mahomes-Kelce partnership began, the Chiefs have been perennial contenders and one of the most feared offenses in football. The duo transformed the franchise into a dynasty in the making. But if this is indeed Kelce’s final season, Chiefs Kingdom might be witnessing the end of an unforgettable chapter.Also Read: Why Taylor Swift still can't dethrone the Dallas Cowboys as 'America's Team' despite Chiefs' meteoric rise While there's still hope that Kelce might return in 2026, fans and analysts alike are preparing to appreciate every route, every touchdown, and every chest bump between No. 15 and No. 87. If this is the last dance, expect Kelce and Mahomes to go out with one clear goal: another Super Bowl ring.","Travis Kelce has one year remaining on his contract with the Kansas City Chiefs.

Poll Will England still win the series 3-1 as predicted by Michael Vaughan? Yes, they will bounce back No, India will take the series

India’s stunning 336-run win over England in the second Test at Edgbaston may have levelled the five-match series 1-1, but former England captain Michael Vaughan isn’t backing down from his pre-series prediction of a 3-1 victory in favour of the hosts.“India have been too good this week .. Outstanding performance .. My prediction is still alive .. 3-1 England ..” Vaughan posted on X, acknowledging India’s dominance but staying firm on his forecast.In his column for The Telegraph, however, Vaughan was more critical of England, accusing them of regressing after Headingley. “This week, they were back to their bad old ways,” he wrote. “Apart from four hours on the third day where Harry Brook and Jamie Smith batted beautifully, they have been totally dominated by India.”Vaughan pointed out that England misread their opening win in Leeds, where dropped catches by India tilted the momentum. “They turned up here and thought they should do everything the same way, and it has backfired,” he said, warning that relying on “fortune” won’t win big series.“You win games relying on fortune, but not big series like this one or the Ashes,” he added, urging England to “evolve” rather than base their method on a single game.Former pacer Stuart Broad, speaking on Sky Sports, also raised red flags about England’s bowling setup. “I'd be worried about this Indian bowling attack at Lord’s,” he said, highlighting the threat of Akash Deep and the returning Bumrah. “If it swings, you've got Bumrah who swings it so late and will be dangerous.”With the third Test at Lord’s starting July 10, both pundits stressed the need for England to reassess quickly.

Fan Sentiment Favors Smart Return

Thecould be on the verge of reuniting with a familiar face as they navigate a crucial offseason. Amid ongoing efforts to stay below the NBA’s restrictive second apron, the Celtics are exploring ways to bolster their backcourt depth, and a return for former Defensive Player of the Year Marcus Smart is reportedly on their radar.Following the trade of Jrue Holiday to the Portland Trail Blazers in June, Boston’s guard rotation now leans heavily on Derrick White and Anfernee Simons. While both players are capable starters, the Boston Celtics lack experienced depth behind them — an issue the front office may soon address.According to Vishwesha Kumar of Yardbarker, Marcus Smart could be a target if his current team, the Washington Wizards, pursues a buyout.“Smart would provide much-needed leadership, defense, and familiarity at a team-friendly deal,” Kumar noted in his report. “His return would energize the fan base and stabilize a locker room that’s lost much of its core.” (H/t: Sporting News)Marcus Smart, the former No. 6 overall pick in the 2014 NBA Draft, spent nine seasons with Boston before being traded to the Memphis Grizzlies in June 2023 as part of the Kristaps Porzingis deal.That trade was initially seen as a bold move to reshape the roster around Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.However, Porzingis was subsequently shipped to the Atlanta Hawks in another cost-cutting trade, and Smart’s time in Memphis was short-lived. He was dealt to Washington in February 2025, where he has since been part of a rebuilding Wizards squad focused on developing young talent.Given the Wizards’ youth-focused direction, a buyout for the 31-year-old guard is increasingly realistic. With Smart on an expiring $21.6 million contract and limited trade interest due to that hefty salary, parting ways through a buyout may benefit both parties.If bought out, Marcus Smart would likely attract interest from multiple teams seeking a defensive-minded veteran on a bargain deal — and the Celtics could be at the front of that line.Boston’s roster has experienced significant turnover in the past two seasons, losing key veterans and reshaping its identity. A Smart reunion could bring leadership, defensive intensity, and stability to a locker room still finding its footing.He would also serve as a valuable mentor for the Boston Celtics’ younger players, including recent additions Baylor Scheierman and Hugo Gonzalez.Despite an injury-marred campaign split between Memphis and Washington, Marcus Smart’s defensive impact and veteran presence remain attractive qualities.Here’s a look at his numbers from the 2024-25 regular season:For a fan base still adjusting to the loss of beloved veterans, Smart’s return would likely be met with enthusiasm. His gritty playing style and defensive tenacity made him a fan favorite during his nine-year run in Boston.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could be chasing $251,019,650 Washington Wizards superstar to form Big 3 with LeBron James and Luka Doncic While nothing is official yet, all signs point to the Boston Celtics keeping a close eye on Smart’s situation in Washington as they seek affordable options to strengthen their depth for the upcoming season.","Marcus Smart could be a target if his current team, the Washington Wizards, pursues a buyout.

The choice to leave the Houston Rockets, who selected him in the 2021 NBA Draft, was difficult for Jalen Green. However, he recently had to say goodbye to his former base after four incredible years of being named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team. On Sunday, he will formally be traded to the Phoenix Suns. Following the news, he shared a heartfelt social media post.After a thorough analysis of all the moving players, the Phoenix Suns and Houston Rockets finalised the enormous seven-team trade on Sunday. The Houston Rockets' plan to acquire star forward Kevin Durant now includes trading Jalen Green, who is officially on his way to the Phoenix Suns.When the team selected the 23-year-old guard with the second overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, there were great expectations for him. Ultimately, the Houston Rockets didn't see him as a part of their future, even though he has demonstrated what it takes to be a franchise cornerstone, particularly last season.Nevertheless, as he was leaving, Jalen Green told his former teammates that he loved them. He also shared several highlights from his 2020 draft night on Instagram on Sunday. One of the photos also included him with his former colleagues, including Dillon Brooks. He further wrote in the caption of the post:“H-Town! Thank you for everything… The support and love from day one is something I’ll never forget.. It’s forever..”During his four years with the Houston Rockets, Jalen Green averaged 20.1 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 3.4 assists. After a three-year break, he assisted them in making a comeback to the postseason. However, he only managed 13.3 points on 37.2% shooting in their first-round loss to the Golden State Warriors.Nevertheless, his exit comes after a disappointing postseason showing that it might have affected the Houston Rockets' choice to make this transaction.

Steve Kerr sends a heartfelt farewell message to veteran Kevon Looney



After nearly a decade of quiet dominance, Kevon Looney's time with the Golden State Warriors has officially come to an end. The three-time NBA champion center signed a two-year, $16 million deal with the New Orleans Pelicans this offseason, bringing a close to one of the franchise’s most underappreciated yet impactful runs. As the news became public, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr shared a heartfelt tribute. The farewell message from the head coach captured Looney’s contributions on the court alongside his legacy within the locker room.In a farewell video posted by the Warriors on social media, Kerr addressed Looney directly and emotionally. “Hey, Loon. Just want to say thank you,” Kerr began. “This is a tough one. Ten years. It's just been an amazing experience for me to coach you. Just your professionalism, your dignity, your class, the way you handled yourself, the way you mentor your young teammates. And of course, the championship contributions that you've made, year after year. ""“We can't thank you enough. I can't thank you enough. Thrilled for your opportunity in New Orleans. But wow, we are going to miss you. So, thank you for everything you've done for me, for our staff, for our team, for the Bay.You are the absolute best, Loon.”Looney’s journey in the Golden State was not always easy. Drafted 30th overall in 2015, he played just five games in his rookie year after surgeries on both hips. But he never quit. By the 2021-22 season, Looney had earned the nickname “Iron Man Loon” after playing all 82 games, and it was a feat he repeated the following season. That 2021-22 campaign saw him averaging over six points and seven rebounds while helping lead the Warriors to their fourth title of the decade, and his third.In a deeply personal essay for The Players’ Tribune, Looney expressed gratitude and peace with his departure. “Not every ending has gotta be a sad ending,” he wrote. “I'm leaving the Bay with a huge smile on my face. Thank you for the ride.”Reflecting on his tenure, he added: “Throughout my 10 years with Golden State, there was never a second when I wanted to be anything other than a Warrior.”Also Read: Orlando Magic lock in Paolo Banchero with five-year deal worth up to $287 million Now in New Orleans, Looney is expected to bring veteran leadership to a young frontcourt that includes Zion Williamson, Yves Missi, and Derik Queen.

Tom Brady reveals early career elbow pain nearly forced him into retirement

Tom Brady’s iconic NFL career — filled with Super Bowl rings, record-smashing performances, and legendary comebacks — almost ended before it truly began. In a shocking revelation, Brady admitted he seriously considered retiring in 2005 at just 27 years old due to persistent elbow pain that nearly derailed his throwing mechanics and passion for the game.“I almost retired from the game of football because of elbow pain,” Tom Brady confessed during a TB12 event in 2022. It’s hard to imagine the NFL without Brady’s miraculous 28–3 Super Bowl comeback, or his historic 2020 championship run with the Buccaneers. But without a critical turning point in his health routine, none of it may have happened.Long before becoming the face of longevity in football, Brady was privately battling intense discomfort. “For my first eleven years playing organized sports, I had a very bad elbow,” he shared. From Little League to the Patriots, the repetitive stress never let up. And as Brady put it bluntly: “I really wondered how long I could play if I was never going to be able to throw the football without pain.”What changed his trajectory? Enter Alex Guerrero, Brady’s longtime body coach and TB12 co-founder. Guerrero told Fox News that when he first started working with Brady, the quarterback “couldn’t even throw a ball without wincing.”But within just two days of pliability therapy — the cornerstone of the TB12 Method — Brady noticed immediate relief.“We incorporate muscle pliability work and functional strength and conditioning exercises… The result of pliability is that you recover faster, play better, and spend less time on the sidelines,” Guerrero explained. That system didn’t just restore Brady — it helped revolutionize how athletes approach injury prevention and performance.From a torn MCL in 2020 to broken fingers and ligament damage in both hands, Brady played through more than fans ever knew. “Can’t even bend that finger anymore,” he once said, showing off the damage on his right hand. But instead of giving in, Brady leaned harder into the TB12 philosophy — a method that kept him in peak condition deep into his 40s.Also Read: Tom Brady’s $375 million Fox Sports deal hits major holiday roadblock as Netflix bans shake up NFL broadcasting Even in retirement, Brady’s intensity hasn’t faded.

In the midst of high-profile challenges—from Swift facing boos during the Super Bowl to Kelce receiving backlash for his on-field performances—their connection seems to have held steady. Still, fans hoping for a wedding announcement may need to wait a while longer.According to sources cited by Daily Mail, Kelce is unlikely to propose in the immediate future. “Travis isn’t going to ask for her hand in marriage this weekend,” an insider revealed. While the NFL star is believed to be serious about their relationship, the timing simply isn't right. “He is likely going to pop the question, but it is going to be when he isn’t playing anymore and not getting ready for a big NFL season,” the source added, pointing to Kelce's current professional priorities.Swift, fresh off the conclusion of her globally successful Eras Tour, has opted for a quieter existence—at least for now. The usually prolific songwriter has gone unusually silent. “If she is about to drop any new music, she hasn’t told anyone, even people who are very close to her haven’t been made aware of anything new coming out,” a source told Daily Mail. “She has been very tight-lipped. Many close to her would be very surprised.Despite the absence of a proposal and Swift’s lower profile, the couple seems to be in a content and grounded place. Their July 4 plans reflect this shift toward intimacy and simplicity. “She is eager to celebrate and unwind, and she is going to have something go down party-wise with Travis, family and some good friends,” an insider noted. “But she isn’t looking to broadcast that she is having a big get-together or party. ..Taylor has had quite the year.”And quite the year, indeed. From reclaiming her master recordings to managing intense media scrutiny, Swift has taken big steps both professionally and personally. Sources told People that her emotional journey to regain her masters felt like closure. “She finally feels like a chapter has closed in the best possible way,” a source said, adding that Kelce being “by her side for that milestone made it even more special. ”Kelce, for his part, is fully present in Swift’s world—massaging away the stress, working out together, and staying close during her quieter moments. “He wouldn’t have wanted it any other way,” a source said of his unwavering support.Together, the two are writing a love story not just of grand gestures but of subtle strength and unwavering loyalty—choosing connection over spectacle.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld flaunts orange furry bikini and stunning ring in sunkissed summer photo that turns heads online","Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's relationship is reportedly deepening, though a proposal isn't expected soon.

Taylor Swift Surprises TEU With Unexpected 'Shake It Off' Performance

For the first time since she and Travis Kelce began dating, Taylor Swift is entering an NFL season without the crushing demands of a global tour. With her record-breaking Eras Tour officially wrapped, Swift is prioritizing time with her boyfriend — and that means a front-row seat to the Kansas City Chiefs' 2025 campaign.According to a PEOPLE insider, “Taylor plans to be at as many of his games as possible,” signaling a shift from a relationship long shaped by flight itineraries and tour stops to one rooted in routine, support, and shared Sundays.Swift wrapped up her 149-show, five-continent Eras Tour in December 2024 — an undertaking so massive it often meant red-eye flights between shows and stadium seats, trying to steal moments with Kelce between NFL road trips and post-show decompression.But now, with no performances standing in the way, the Grammy winner is reportedly “really looking forward to the upcoming NFL season.” As the source emphasized, “It’s the first season where she’s not constantly flying back and forth or working around an entire touring calendar.”The couple’s early relationship played out under a cloud of chaos — Swift was on the move constantly, and Kelce was juggling football, fame, and family.“The past two seasons were a whirlwind between performing across multiple countries, long flights, and trying to squeeze in alone time together wherever possible,” the insider added. “It wasn’t easy but they made it work.”Kelce, for his part, never took her efforts for granted. “She tried to get to as many as she could last year, and she came to a lot,” he said during an appearance on Bussin’ with the Boys. “We’ll have Tay representing up at Arrowhead.”Now, as Kelce gears up for his 13th NFL season, the couple is embracing a new rhythm — one built around Sunday tailgates and fewer red carpets. Swift won’t just be a rare face at the Super Bowl or high-profile matchups — she’s expected to be a consistent presence in Arrowhead’s suites and even at select away games.Also Read: Travis Kelce drops unexpected clues about building a future with Taylor Swift—and a secret new family member Their high-profile relationship has blurred the lines between the NFL and pop culture.

Paolo Banchero lands five-year max extension as Orlando Magic build around rising franchise star



The Orlando Magic are making a bold commitment to their franchise cornerstone. According to multiple reports, the team has secured All-Star forward Paolo Banchero on a five-year maximum extension that could be worth as much as $287 million. The contract includes a player option and performance-based incentives. Banchero, just 22, has been one of the standout stars of a young Orlando core that has playoff aspirations and now long-term stability.Paolo Banchero's new deal was formally announced by the team, though exact financial terms were not disclosed per policy.Orlando’s President of Basketball Operations, Jeff Weltman, made the team’s intentions clear, stating, “We are thrilled to keep Paolo (Banchero) in a Magic uniform for years to come. At just 22, he has won NBA Rookie of the Year, been named an NBA All-Star and is widely regarded as one of our league’s brightest young stars. This commitment reflects our belief in Paolo’s talent, character and desire to win at the highest level. It also reflects Paolo’s belief in our organization, our fans and the city of Orlando. We are excited to continue this journey together.”Banchero posted a career-best season despite missing time with a torn oblique. He averaged 25.9 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 4.8 assists while helping Orlando reach the postseason.In five playoff games, he elevated his performance to 29.4 points, 8.4 rebounds, and 4.2 assists per game, tying legends Kobe Bryant and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar with seven straight 25+ point games before age 23. His stellar postseason also included multiple 30-point outings, matching Tracy McGrady’s franchise playoff mark.According to reports, Banchero’s extension includes a base value of $239 million, with escalators— such as All-NBA selections, MVP honors, or Defensive Player of the Year— that could push it to the $287 million ceiling. The deal gives him a player option for the 2030-31 season.Even as an oblique injury limited him to under 65 games last season— disqualifying him from All-NBA eligibility— the Magic are betting big on Banchero’s growth.Also Read: Kyle Lowry makes exclusive NBA return as Philadelphia 76ers bet big on hometown veteran With the additions of Desmond Bane and the long-term commitments to Franz Wagner and Jalen Suggs, the Magic appear ready to chase the Eastern Conference crown, and Paolo Banchero is leading the charge","Paolo Banchero lands five-year max extension as Orlando Magic build around rising franchise star.

Indiana Pacers confirm Tyrese Haliburton will miss 2025–26 NBA season after torn achilles in game 7 loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/indiana-pacers-confirm-tyrese-haliburton-will-miss-202526-nba-season-after-torn-achilles-in-game-7-loss/articleshow/122308425.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Kevin Pritchard delivers the toughest news yet on Tyrese Haliburton

Tyrese Haliburton's Achilles injury didn’t just end Game 7—it tore through the heart of a rising Pacers dynasty. Kevin Pritchard confirmed what fans feared: Haliburton won’t play in 2025–26. His early-game spark faded into silence, and Indiana's dreams unraveled quickly. Now, without their All-Star leader or Myles Turner, the Pacers stare down a season of rebuilding and recovery.The Pacers faced a tough end to their season with a loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder, and it was a game that altered careers. Haliburton scored nine points in the first seven minutes of Game 7, but then the Achilles rupture happened, leading to a downfall that Indiana never bounced back from, being outscored 56–43 in the second half. Kevin Pritchard was clear — “He will not play next year… We would not jeopardize that now. Don’t get any hopes up that he will play”.As the emotional and strategic heart of the franchise, Haliburton is set for a long recovery that will last more than 12 months. His surgery was performed on June 23 at the prestigious Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, and Pritchard is optimistic about the outcome — “I have no doubt that he will be back better than ever”.But as the loyal fans in Indiana are aware, Achilles injuries can be brutal—Boston’s Jayson Tatum and Milwaukee’s Damian Lillard are still out due to similar tears from earlier in these playoffs.Behind those numbers is a more profound tale. Haliburton led one of the most remarkable turnarounds in the NBA, guiding the Pacers from a 47–35 regular-season record to their first Finals appearance since 2000. In the playoffs, he averaged 17.3 points and 8.6 assists, showcasing clutch performances—including a buzzer-beater in Game 1 of the Finals—before an injury halted his impressive run.Without Haliburton and following Myles Turner's exit in free agency, Indiana is entering a critical offseason. The standard recovery for an Achilles injury is 8 to 12 months, and the Pacers are not in a hurry. Still, the larger timeline indicates a potential return only late in the 2026–27 season. Haliburton's absence opens up a gap that the Knicks, Cavaliers, and Sixers might capitalize on in 2025–26.Also Read: Gilbert Arenas opens up about why Michael Jordan was never his favorite player growing up Indiana's rise, once driven by hope, now hits a snag at the crossroads of injury.

However, as Pritchard points out, this isn't the end—it's just a break. Haliburton's fierce competitive nature remains intact despite the setback, making him the cornerstone of Indiana's comeback.",Tyrese Haliburton's Achilles injury ended the Indiana Pacers' season.

Justin Dowling lands two-year contract with Rangers

The New York Rangers are adding veteran depth to their forward group, officially signing 34-year-old Justin Dowling to a two-year contract, the team announced Monday. The move comes as part of a busy offseason for President and General Manager Chris Drury, who has steadily been retooling the roster following another early playoff exit.Justin Dowling joins the Rangers after a quietly impressive season with the New Jersey Devils, where he played a career-high 52 games and posted seven points (2 goals, 5 assists). While those numbers may seem modest, they represent a personal-best campaign for Dowling at the NHL level — a testament to his resilience and consistency. He also contributed during the postseason, appearing in all five of the Devils’ playoff games.Dowling may not be a household name, but he brings a wealth of experience to the Rangers’ locker room. With 152 career NHL games across stints with the Devils, Dallas Stars, and Vancouver Canucks, he’s carved out a role as a reliable bottom-six forward. His 573 games in the AHL — where he racked up an impressive 408 points (131 goals, 277 assists) — further highlight his playmaking ability and leadership qualities.He was a key piece in the Texas Stars’ 2014 Calder Cup championship and again helped them reach the Final in 2018.That kind of playoff-tested resume is exactly what Drury and head coach Peter Laviolette seem to be targeting this offseason.Dowling’s signing is just one in a string of moves by the Rangers this summer. The organization has already inked deals with several other players, including Brendan Brisson, Trey Fix-Wolansky, and Vladislav Gavrikov. These additions signal a push toward building a deeper, more versatile roster as New York aims to capitalize on its remaining championship window.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Penguins face pressure to trade Rickard Rakell despite strong 70-point season Originally signed by Dallas as an undrafted free agent in 2014, Dowling has proven he can adapt, contribute, and lead.

Rickard Rakell’s uncertain future looms over Penguins offseason as trade buzz intensifies

As the Pittsburgh Penguins continue retooling after missing the playoffs, the spotlight now turns to veteran forward Rickard Rakell — a player drawing league-wide interest, but who reportedly prefers to stay right where he is.According to Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman, Rakell is not pushing for a trade despite the swirling rumors: “I’ve heard Rakell would prefer to stay in Pittsburgh,” Friedman said. “It’s just that it’s not his call. I’ve heard he is not averse to staying, but, ultimately, Dubas will make that decision.”This sentiment sets up a potentially emotional standoff between player loyalty and front-office strategy. Rakell, fresh off a career-best season with 35 goals and 35 assists, remains a core part of the Penguins’ offensive engine. Yet, with the team navigating a rebuild and trying to acquire future assets, trading the high-performing winger could net a significant return.While general manager Kyle Dubas weighs his options, one factor complicates any aggressive rebuild — the presence of Sidney Crosby. The franchise icon is still playing at a high level and is fiercely committed to contending. That urgency puts pressure on management to strike a delicate balance between building for the future and competing for the now.Crosby’s influence is undeniable, and there’s a growing sentiment that the Penguins owe it to him to keep the team competitive until he calls it a career. Rakell’s chemistry with Crosby and his consistent scoring make him an asset Dubas might hesitate to part with — unless the return is too good to pass up.The NHL offseason is rapidly heating up, and with other big-name trades already materializing across the league, Rakell’s situation could be resolved sooner rather than later. For now, the forward remains in Pittsburgh — hopeful to stay, but fully aware the decision lies elsewhere.Also Read: NHL trade rumors: Maple Leafs linked to shocking Morgan Rielly–Nazem Kadri swap to fix top-six gap With the Penguins at a crossroads, every move this offseason could reshape their identity.

Friend offers to get job done

Forced him to delete photos & videos





BENGALURU: In a shocking incident that's reminiscent of the sensational Renukaswamy murder case involving Kannada actor Darshan, an engineering student was kidnapped, stripped and forced to run naked by a 12-member gang in the backdrop of a love affair that ended in breakup. The 19-year-old was assaulted on his private parts in front of his former girlfriend—a minor, at whose behest the attack allegedly carried out.Soladevanahalli police have arrested nine accused. Acting on a complaint lodged by Vishnu (name changed), a resident of Sasuveghatta in North Bengaluru, police registered a case of kidnap, acting with criminal intimidation and voluntarily causing hurt.The trigger for the attack was Vishnu's alleged refusal to delete messages and photographs exchanged between him and the girl in the past despite their breakup a few months ago. Vishnu was upset that the girl was ignoring him and moving closely with another boy. While she requested him to delete everything and move on, he slammed her for changing her friends at will and threatened to expose her, police said.The minor then confided in another girl who promised to settle the issue. Led by the minor girl, a 12-member gang kidnapped Vishnu on June 30 and beat him with canes and sticks before getting the photos and videos deleted.The accused are: A Shivashankar, 20, of Sheshadripuram; Yashvanth Patel, 20, of Ganapatinagar; N Hemant, 18, of Nelamanagala; S Salman Khan, 23, of T Dasarahalli; Rahul M, 20, of Ullal; Tejas S, 18; Rakesh R, 21, both residents of Hesaraghatta; and N Shashank Gowda, 19, of Yeshwanthpur. Police are looking for Hemant, Surya, and Vishal, who are elusive. Of the arrested, Salman Khan is a lab technician while the others are students.Vishnu and the minor girl were in love for almost two years. ""Post breakup, her closeness with another boy irked Vishnu. Meanwhile, the girl started forcing Vishnu to delete their photos and videos from Vishnu's mobile phone. But Vishnu refused, saying he would tell her family and others that she was in the habit of making boyfriends and ditching them,"" police said.Worried about Vishnu keeping the private videos and pictures with him, the girl sought the help of a close friend. She did not want her new boyfriend to know about her past.The friend promised to get the job done and contacted Hemanth, Shivashankar, and Yashvanth Patel. Accordingly, the 12-member gang asked the girl to bring Vishnu to AGB Layout in Hesaraghatta.As planned, the girl took Vishnu to AGB Layout on the pretext of discussing some personal issues. There, the accused men first demanded Vishnu to hand over his phone, but he had left it at home. By then, some of the men had already started beating up Vishnu. Bundling Vishnu in Hemant's car, other accused, including the girl, drove to his home.One of the attackers recorded the scene on his mobile while travelling in the car; Vishnu stuffed into a corner of the car. Some of them told him to sing a song; when Vishnu sat silent, the minor girl and others shouted at him. Also, someone sang a song and told him to continue it.The car was parked a little away from Vishnu's house. Vishnu went inside, returned with the phone, and handed it over to Hemant who deleted the photos and videos. Vishnu kept the phone back at home and as demanded by Hemant, joined them again. This time, the car reached a desolate place near Alur lake. Others too reached the spot. Vishnu was made to sit on the ground with others standing around. ""So, you want only me? You want my pictures and videos? You don't want anything else?"" questioned the girl.Hemanth and Shivshankar grabbed Vishnu's trousers, and the latter resisted. Others held Vishnu firmly, and in no time, the gang stripped him completely. The video shows him begging for mercy. ""This is like the Renukaswamy murder case,"" shouts one of the accused.At one stage, the minor girl questioned Vishnu about the videos and photos. Vishnu replied that everything has been deleted. However, seeing one of the attackers recording on his mobile, the minor girl stepped back.

But now, after I've got captaincy, I almost, when I'm batting, think this is what my team requires — rather than me wanting to do something individually as a batter — which I thought, wow.""Now, this is something the world of cricket has to take notice of, because here's a man who has the appetite, who has the skill, who's got the technique.""But now he's got the mindset as well that says, I'm a captain. I'm going to lead from the front, lead off the front foot. And we saw that in the last Test match.""I'm sure there are going to be a lot more Test matches for us to observe him. But it looks like he's on the right path.""The five-match Test series is locked at 1-1, with the third match scheduled at Lord's, starting from Thursday.","Former India cricketer turned cricket pundit Dinesh Karthik revealed the conversation he had with Virat Kohli before the start of the Edgbaston Test.

Which ex-girlfriend of John Cena will compete at WWE Evolution II?



John Cena's road to success as a WWE superstar has been remarkable. Not only has it brought him fame and fortune, but it has also led to romantic relationships with top stars. The Franchise Player still has former love interests who are a part of the WWE landscape right now. One of those female WWE superstars is set to compete at the all-women's Premium Live Event, WWE Evolution II, set to take place on July 13 at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta, Georgia. However, following weeks of speculation, her role for the show was revealed, and it was not what many expected.On the July 7th edition of Monday Night RAW, John Cena's longtime ex-girlfriend Nikki Bella appeared in a vignette. She spoke about her return weeks ago and how being attacked by Liv Morgan gave her perspective. The Fearless One wanted to prove her worth to the fans and show her son, Matteo, what the WWE Universe has seen for years: rise to the top of the heap.Bella stated that she would be entering the Women's Battle Royal at WWE Evolution II. The winner of the match would receive a Women's Championship match at WWE's forthcoming Premium Live Event, Clash in Paris. The WWE Hall of Famer ended her segment by saying that she wanted that opportunity to once again become champion in the global juggernaut.However, this came as a disappointing booking for Nikki Bella. Ever since she returned to Monday Night RAW a few weeks ago, she was speculated to feud with Liv Morgan. However, those plans were scrapped after she got injured. There were rumors that Brie Bella would return to team up with Nikki to challenge for the WWE Women's Tag Team titles, but that did not happen either.Instead, WWE chose to book a top star for a lackluster match at a historic night at WWE Evolution II. While the decision is final, it will be interesting to see if it's Nikki Bella who will be next in line to challenge for the WWE Women's Championship in Paris.Also read: Top richest WWE legends: The Rock, Undertaker, Triple H, Brock Lesnar, and more","WWE Evolution II is set to take place on July 13 at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta, Georgia.

The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) has officially clarified that Akash Deep's delivery that dismissed Joe Root during the recent Edgbaston Test was legal, addressing the controversy that emerged regarding the bowler's back foot position. The MCC, which serves as the custodian of cricket laws, explained that the legality of a delivery is determined by where the foot first lands, not its subsequent position, putting to rest the debate that arose after footage showed Deep's back foot appearing to touch outside the return crease.The dismissal occurred during the second delivery of the tenth over when Akash Deep bowled Root with an incoming delivery during the second Test between England and India. The wicket proved crucial as it reduced England to 50/3 while chasing a target of 608 runs.The controversy began when television footage showed Deep's back foot potentially crossing the return crease, leading to discussions about whether it should have been called a no-ball. Several commentators, including former England batter Jonathan Trott during a studio discussion on JioStar, questioned the delivery's legality.Third umpire Paul Reiffel did not intervene on the delivery, while Chris Gaffaney and Sharfuddoula Saikat, the on-field umpires, allowed the dismissal to stand. Former India coach Ravi Shastri, who was commenting at the time, maintained that the delivery was legal.The MCC spokesperson provided a detailed explanation of the ruling: ""On Day four of India's Test against England last week, there were questions raised about the delivery from Akash Deep which bowled Joe Root, with some fans and commentators believing it to be a no ball. While Deep landed unusually wide on the crease, and some of his back foot appeared to touch the ground outside the return crease, the third umpire did not call a no ball. MCC is happy to clarify that this was a correct decision in Law,"" reportedThe MCC referenced Law 21.5.1, which states: ""For a delivery to be fair in respect of the feet, in the delivery stride the bowler's back foot must land within and not touching the return crease appertaining to his/her stated mode of delivery.""Further clarifying the interpretation, the MCC explained: ""MCC has always defined the moment that the back foot lands as the first point of contact with the ground. As soon as there is any part of the foot touching the ground, that foot has landed, and it is the foot's position at that time which is to be considered for a back foot no ball.""The MCC concluded: ""Clearly, at the point Deep's foot first touched the ground, the back foot was within and not touching the return crease. Some of his foot may have touched the ground outside the crease subsequently - that is not relevant to this Law. At the point of landing he was within the crease, and this was therefore rightly deemed to be a legal delivery.""England were eventually bowled out for 271 on the final day, resulting in India's series-levelling victory by 336 runs in the second Test of the five-match series.","The Marylebone Cricket Club has clarified that Akash Deep's delivery that dismissed Joe Root during the recent Edgbaston Test was legal.
