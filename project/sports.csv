Mattias Ekholm ’s wife praises Oilers Nation with raw, emotional letter after crushing Stanley Cup loss



The Edmonton Oilers' dream of clinching the Stanley Cup came to a devastating end yet again, this time in Game 6 against the Florida Panthers. With a 5-1 loss sealing a 4-2 series defeat, the heartbreak ran deep — not just among players and fans, but also within the families who’ve stood by through every exhausting moment.Amid the emotional wreckage, one voice quietly stood out — not from the locker room, but from the sidelines. Ida Björnstad, wife of Oilers defenseman Mattias Ekholm and a respected Swedish sports journalist, took to Instagram to deliver a deeply moving message that resonated far beyond the final score.“As you might know, I’m a writer, and I love to put my thoughts into sentences and stories,” Ida began, in a post that felt more like a journal entry than a public statement. “Most of my texts stay with me. This time, though, I would like to share some words with you.”Her post was more than a show of support; it was a heartfelt window into the emotional toll a Stanley Cup run takes on not only players but also their families. Ida’s perspective came not as a reporter, but as a partner who’s been living the ups and downs of the season behind closed doors.“I know how much hockey means to the Canadian people, and I understand that the people in Edmonton are heartbroken today, including our family,” she wrote, capturing the collective disappointment that enveloped the city after the Oilers fell short again.She went on to highlight the intense mental and physical demands that playoff hockey imposes: “Throughout the playoffs, many things are happening behind the scenes. Boundaries are being pushed in the most demanding way, both physically and mentally. For the players and their families, everything is about maximizing the chances of winning.”Despite flashes of brilliance from Edmonton — including two hard-fought overtime wins — the Panthers controlled much of the series. Edmonton was behind for a record-setting 255 minutes and 49 seconds and was outscored 28-17 overall. Game 6 saw Florida dominate early, with the Oilers unable to find their rhythm again.Still, Ida chose to focus on the positives. “For two years in a row, we have made it to the Stanley Cup Finals. The Oilers are the second-best hockey team in the world, and we have fans who support this team in both good times and bad. There is so much to be proud of and thankful for.”And in her final thought, she reminded everyone of the bigger picture: “As much as it hurts when you lose, this is a journey we will look back on one day, reflecting on the highs and lows and understanding that everything made sense.”As the Oilers now prepare for a pivotal offseason, Ida’s message offers something rare — a sense of grace and perspective in the face of loss, reminding fans why they fell in love with this team in the first place.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky loved Panthers' Cup win over Oilers but also admits one part didn’t sit right","Edmonton Oilers' dream of clinching the Stanley Cup came to a devastating end yet again.

Panthers' Stanley Cup celebration hits a sour note as Wayne Gretzky reveals one major complaint



The Florida Panthers sealed their second consecutive Stanley Cup in spectacular fashion, and Sam Reinhart’s unforgettable performance in Game 6 became the night’s defining moment. With four goals to his name, Reinhart powered the Panthers to a 5-1 win over the Edmonton Oilers and etched his name alongside hockey royalty.Reinhart's scoring spree not only clinched the Cup but also tied Wayne Gretzky’s iconic 1985 record of seven goals in a single Final series. But in typical Gretzky fashion, the hockey legend met the moment with charm and humor rather than disappointment.“My records this year are dropping like flies, Eddie O,” Gretzky quipped during the postgame broadcast to analyst Eddie Olczyk. His remark, filled with playful sarcasm, was met with a laugh as Olczyk assured him, “You still got another 40 or 50, Gretz. You’re OK.”While Gretzky’s record may have taken a hit, his admiration for Reinhart was clear. The Panthers’ forward accomplished this milestone while pushing through a Grade 2 MCL tear, an injury he sustained in the Eastern Conference Final. “I can’t really put into words what it means,” Reinhart reflected.“It’s something you never really think about... this one was even harder to overcome and be here at the end.”Two of Reinhart’s goals came on empty nets, but the impact of his performance was undeniable. It was a statement game, one that cemented Florida's dominance and placed Reinhart among the elite.The victory made Florida the first team since the Tampa Bay Lightning’s 2020–21 run to repeat as champions. But it was Reinhart’s tenacity and historical achievement that stood out.As confetti fell and Florida celebrated on home ice, hockey fans witnessed a rare bridging of eras—where a modern-day warrior matched the mark of a hockey legend, and that legend, with a wink, tipped his cap. The 2025 Stanley Cup Final didn’t just end with a trophy; it added a new chapter to the sport’s most storied history.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky’s daughter Paulina Gretzky’s workout fit has fans raising eyebrows","Florida Panthers beat Edmonton Oilers 5-1 to win the Stanley Cup.

Paulina Gretzky’s viral post for Wayne Gretzky fuels talk as Dustin Johnson battles golf struggles

Paulina Gretzky celebrates Wayne Gretzky with moving message

Golf fans are talking again. Dustin Johnson, a big name in the sport, is having a rough stretch. Missing important cuts has raised red flags. Meanwhile, his wife, Paulina Gretzky , honoured her father, hockey great Wayne Gretzky, in a heartfelt social post. This family moment shines, even as Dustin battles form and tough odds.Dustin Johnson, aged 40, was once a top golf star with major wins like the U.S. Open in 2016 and the Masters in 2020. But lately, he has not had the same edge on the LIV Golf tour. In the 2025 season, he missed the cut at both the Masters and PGA Championship. Reports say he shot 10-over in just 36 holes at Oakmont, a venue where he had previous success.These results have fans and analysts worried. Golf is a sport of form and confidence, two things that now seem in short supply for Dustin. His swing speed has dropped, and errors are up. Sources within LIV Golf suggest that he may change his training or work with a new coach. But no official plan has been shared yet.Paulina Gretzky, Dustin Johnson's wife and daughter of legendary hockey player Wayne Gretzky, uploaded an Instagram homage to her father on Father's Day, June 16, 2025.She showed a picture of the two of them and said how much she appreciates his guidance and support throughout the years.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky’s Daughter Paulina Gretzky Filmed In Awkward Moment At 2016 U.S. Open By Oakmont Cameraman Fans lauded the letter as ""genuine love"" and ""honest respect.” Paulina also disclosed a family narrative: Wayne first met Dustin at a pro‑am event in 2009. Wayne was the one who nudged Paulina to know Dustin. That recommendation led them to wed in 2022 and get married in 2013.Adding to their close family relationship, the pair has two boys. Wayne provided unity and support through his presence at events both on and off the golf course.Now as Dustin works to rebuild his game, many believe having Paulina and Wayne by his side could help him find his way again. With his game faltering, Dustin Johnson faces a crucial crossroads. Yet, with Paulina Gretzky and Wayne Gretzky’s steadfast support, fans remain hopeful he can reclaim his winning form and confidence.","Dustin Johnson, a big name in the sport, is having a rough stretch.

Stephen A. Smith’s daughter Samantha Smith ’s confident cameo stuns ESPN crew



In a surprising twist during ESPN’s pregame coverage of Game 6 of the NBA Finals, it wasn’t Stephen A. Smith’s booming voice or passionate takes that stole the show like his usual style. This time, it was his 17-year-old daughter, Samantha who appeared on camera with her father. While the veteran broadcaster was on air from Gainbridge Fieldhouse, ready to dissect the Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers showdown, viewers instead got a rare, lighthearted peek into Smith’s personal life as his daughter made an impromptu on-camera appearance that quickly became the highlight of the night.As Stephen A. Smith and Elle Duncan were warming up the broadcast on the court, Duncan playfully invited Samantha over, joking that it was “Bring your daughter to work day.” Smith, visibly uncomfortable but trying to roll with it, instructed her, “Say hi.” Samantha seized the moment without hesitation: “Hi guys, I’m Samantha.” When her dad pulled the mic away, she clapped back effortlessly, “I’m talking here.”It didn’t stop there.“I’m Stephen’s daughter. I’m so happy to be here, I’ve made so many friends. This is really…” she began, only for her father to interject, “You just got here five minutes ago.” Samantha didn’t blink. “This is a really great experience. This is a really great experience and I feel really grateful to be here, you guys,” she continued confidently, leaving the panel and viewers, and of course, his ESPN colleague in awe.Later, NBA Countdown host Malika Andrews brought Samantha back on-air for her game pick. Going against her father, she declared, “I’m going OKC. I think they’re just going to end it tonight. I think Shai [Gilgeous-Alexander] has been killing it all season and he won MVP for a reason. So I think we’re just going to finish it out now.”Smith, after having the candid father-daughter moment, looked both amused and defeated as his colleagues teased, “We much prefer her pick over yours.” He questioned, “You’re going against your daddy on live television?” to which Samantha shrugged and replied, “I think he knows I’m right.” Eventually, he admitted, “She usually beats me on predictions.”Also Read: ""He's miserable"": Fans slam Stephen A.

Brandon Aiyuk could be the star Patrick Mahomes needs

Poll Do you think having a star wide receiver is crucial for a team’s success? Yes, it can change the game No, overall teamwork matters more

Patrick Mahomes has been waiting for a big-play receiver













The Kansas City Chiefs might be planning something big before the 2025 NFL season begins. On June 16, 2025, reports started coming out that the team could go after San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk. He’s looking for a long-term deal, possibly worth $23 million per year. Such a move could potentially create a lot of avenues for the Kansas City Chiefs' offense and give quarterback Patrick Mahomes another powerful weapon. Nothing is done yet, but each day is bringing this closer. Fans are enjoying what will emerge next. Rumors are swirling across social media platforms and major sports networks, generating intense excitement among Kansas City supporters eager to see a fresh offensive spark take the field this fall.Brandon Aiyuk, 26, was a big part of the San Francisco 49ers' offense, compiling a 2023 season where he notched 75 catches, 1,342 yards, and 7 touchdowns in his statistically best season as a professional. Brandon Aiyuk is fast, trustworthy, and consistently finds ways to beat defenders — in other words, he's the type of option Patrick Mahomes could use more of. The Kansas City Chiefs have not had a true top wide receiver since Tyreek Hill left town.If this deal goes through, it could reshape the AFC landscape and make the Chiefs even tougher to stop in the postseason.On June 16, 2025, Brandon Aiyuk posted a short video on TikTok saying, “They don’t want me back,” referring to the 49ers. That same day, ESPN’s Adam Schefter said on NFL Live, “If Brandon Aiyuk is truly available, the Chiefs will absolutely be in the mix.”Brandon Aiyuk is in the final year of his rookie contract, with a $14 million option. He wants a raise — close to $23 million a year. If the Kansas City Chiefs want to help Patrick Mahomes even more, this could be their chance. According to The Athletic, the team still has around $25 million in cap space. That gives them enough room to make the deal work if they want to.This offseason, Patrick Mahomes has been training in Missouri with a young group of wide receivers. Most of them are still learning, and while they’ve shown potential, none of them have the star power that Brandon Aiyuk brings.A player like Brandon Aiyuk could alleviate pressure on Patrick Mahomes, and make the Kansas City Chiefs’ offense much more dynamic. Training camp will start towards the end of July 2025. If a deal ever occurs before that, the team could go into the season with a brand new weapon ready to go.Adding Aiyuk could elevate the Chiefs’ offense with improved playmaking, balance, and versatility—bringing more explosiveness, precision, and leadership to the field. It wouldn’t just be a roster upgrade; it could reshape their entire offensive identity and Super Bowl path.If the Chiefs land Brandon Aiyuk, it could redefine their offensive identity, give Mahomes a true top target, and position Kansas City as overwhelming favorites heading into the 2025 NFL season.Also Read: San Francisco 49ers GM John Lynch Breaks Silence On Brandon Aiyuk’s Return After ACL And MCL Tear Against Kansas City Chiefs","Brandon Aiyuk is in the final year of his rookie contract, with a $14 million option.

Bill Belichick’s romance could trigger ‘psychological warfare’ at UNC

Bill Belichick's relationship with Jordon Hudson is raising concerns about his potential involvement with a college program, specifically . Former NFL player Shawne Merriman warned this situation could lead to ""psychological warfare,"" potentially jeopardizing Belichick's reputation and a team's focus due to off-field distractions.The whispers surrounding celebrated NFL coach Bill Belichick and his purported connection with former cheerleader Jordon Hudson are now casting a shadow over his prospective engagement with a university athletic program, particularly at the University of North Carolina.The spotlight intensified considerably after Shawne Merriman, a former NFL linebacker and an ACC icon, issued a stark caution: if Belichick isn't careful, this personal situation could very well devolve into ""psychological warfare.""Merriman's commentary on the Belichick-Hudson situation was unambiguous during a recent podcast appearance. The former San Diego Chargers standout articulated clearly what he believes is at stake: ""He's stepping into psychological warfare now, man. That's going to cost him dearly. That's not a win.""Shawne Merriman’s warning exceeds mere media sensationalism. With Belichick being considered for future advisory or mentorship roles at the collegiate level, especially at UNC where his ties run deep, such personal narratives could become significant impediments, affecting recruitment, team concentration, and his standing with younger athletes and staff.At 72, Belichick holds an esteemed position in NFL history, celebrated for his precise approach and unwavering commitment to football fundamentals. However, his name has recently graced headlines of a vastly different nature. His alleged romantic involvement with Jordon Hudson—a woman nearly five decades his junior—has ignited a flurry of tabloid speculation and widespread social media discourse.For a coach aspiring to transition into a new capacity within college football, potentially as a consultant or executive, such personal entanglements risk overshadowing his distinguished professional legacy. Universities, especially high-profile programs like UNC, generally prefer to maintain pristine reputations when enlisting prominent figures to guide young athletes or contribute to team development.Whether Belichick ultimately aligns with UNC or another collegiate program remains uncertain. Yet, as Merriman’s comments imply, the mere presence of personal controversy, even if unconfirmed, can be potent enough to create significant hurdles in the fiercely competitive realm of college athletics.Bill Belichick may have stepped away from the NFL sidelines for the moment, but if his ambition is to forge a new path at the collegiate level, adeptly navigating public perception will prove just as crucial as his mastery of Xs and Os.Also Read: “Biggest killer”: Tom Brady's ex-wife Gisele Bündchen faced backlash after risking their baby’s life in reckless ATV joyride with no helmet Only time will tell if Belichick can successfully navigate these personal waters while building a new chapter in his legendary coaching career at the collegiate level.","Bill Belichick's relationship with Jordon Hudson is raising concerns about his potential involvement with a college program.

The linchpin behind Houston’s transformation in just two seasons

Ime Udoka has turned the Houston Rockets from an afterthought into a serious contender. After a dismal 22-win season, he pushed them to a 52–30 record and a No. 2 seed in the West. His gritty, defense-first mindset reshaped everything. Now, with an eight-figure extension and full backing from the front office, Udoka stands as the face of a rising powerhouse built for the long haul.When Ime Udoka came on board in April 2023, the Rockets were still recovering their head after a historic worst streak in the franchise history, where the last season recorded only 22 victories out of 82 matches. And under his leadership they were able to reverse it and complete 41-41 in the first year of his directing of the team, and then they really began to soar in 2024-25 achieving 52-30 and earning the number two slot. Udoka’s philosophy, rooted in his experience with Gregg Popovich, emphasized a defense-first approach. The result was a squad that ranked fifth in defensive efficiency and was recognized as one of the toughest teams to face in the league.Even though the financial specifics are kept secret, ESPN’s Shams Charania has confirmed that Udoka’s new deal is long-term, placing him among the NBA’s highest earners with a salary in the eight figures per season.The Houston front office didn’t waste any time, reportedly stopping the Knicks from interviewing Udoka during their coaching transition. This level of confidence shows just how important he is to the Rockets’ resurgence.Udoka’s extension isn’t just a single headline—it’s a crucial element of a wider rebuild. The Rockets have also secured veteran center Steven Adams with a three-year, $39 million deal, are looking to sort out Fred VanVleet’s $44.9 million team option, and continue to be involved in trade talks regarding Kevin Durant.

Cardi B and Stefon Diggs stay above the fray amid quiet soft-launch romance

The hip-hop and NFL worlds are colliding again—and not for a remix. This time, it’s Offset making headlines after being spotted at the same nightclub as Sky Marlene, the ex-girlfriend of NFL star Stefon Diggs. What adds fuel to the fire? Stefon Diggs just so happens to be Cardi B’s rumored new man, while she’s still legally married to Offset. Coincidence? Fans aren’t buying it.According to Rain Drops Media, Sky was seen at the club where Offset performed, and while the two didn’t exchange any overtly flirty glances—or numbers—just their simultaneous presence has the internet convinced that this was anything but accidental. Twitter, as usual, erupted.“Going after the ex of your ex-wife’s boyfriend as a way to get back at her is some pathetic bitter loser shit,” one user tweeted, capturing the sentiment shared by many. Another added, “This just lets you know these hoes be living aimless lives,” as the drama played out like a crossover episode of Love & Hip Hop and Hard Knocks.While there’s no official confirmation that Offset and Sky Marlene have any romantic connection, the fact that she appeared at a club where he was performing on the same night Cardi B’s relationship with Diggs dominates headlines? That’s either next-level pettiness or cosmic coincidence.Meanwhile, Cardi B and Stefon Diggs seem perfectly content playing it cool. They’ve been spotted together on yachts and in cozy settings, but neither has addressed the romance publicly. “When you’re busy building an empire and still collecting checks from your soon-to-be ex-husband’s royalties, you don’t have time for the ex of your man’s ex,” one fan wrote, summing up Cardi’s mood perfectly.Diggs, now with the New England Patriots, continues his silent vibe-only PR strategy—no comments, no confirmations, just touchdowns and tranquility.Also Read: “I still didn’t win”: Josh Allen calls MVP award worthless—says it means nothing without a ring Whether Offset and Sky Marlene’s club cameo was a carefully orchestrated revenge play or a harmless coincidence, one thing is clear: in celebrity circles, even a passing moment can spiral into headline-making chaos.","Offset was spotted at the same nightclub as Sky Marlene, the ex-girlfriend of NFL star Stefon Diggs.

Donald Trump’s comment leaves Juventus players speechless

Weston McKennie, Timothy Weah and Juventus start strong despite distraction

Tuesday, June 17, before their first 2025 FIFA Club World Cup game, the Azzurri squad visited the White House in Washington, D. C. An unexpected comment sparked immediate outrage during the meeting with U. S. President Donald Trump. A remark from Trump took aback the Juventus players and silenced the room for a short while. His unexpected query drew reactions online and garnered notice even before the team set foot on the field. The awkward moment became one of the most talked-about events surrounding their tournament opener.During the visit to the Oval Office, Donald Trump looked at the Juventus men’s team and asked, “Could a woman make your team, fellas?” This happened on June 17, just one day before Juventus played against Al Ain in their FIFA Club World Cup opener.Among the squad were U.S. Men’s National Team players Weston McKennie and Timothy Weah. When Donald Trump asked the question, the room went quiet. No one from the team immediately responded.Juventus General Manager Damien Comolli was gracious enough to reply politely, exclaiming ""We have a very good women's team."" Juventus Women, who were conversely referring to the 2024–25 Serie A Femminile champions (Juventus have women’s teams in both the FAWSL & Serie A Femminile).But Trump did not stop there. He replied, “But they should be playing with women. He’s being very diplomatic.”Despite the awkward meeting, Juventus stayed focused on their tournament. On June 18, they played their first match at the Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia and defeated Al Ain 5–0. Randal Kolo Muani and Francisco Conceição each scored two goals. Kenan Yıldız has another one.Making their first FIFA Club World Cup appearance in Group G alongside Al Ain, Wydad AC, and Manchester City, Juventus Following a grueling Italian campaign that found the team end below expectations in the 2024–25 season, they are hoping to finish the year on a good note with more optimistic tales about their involvement in this event.Sunday, June 22 sees the next match for the team against the Moroccan Wydad AC.

Inter Miami and Palmeiras now have four points each in Group A, following the Brazilian team's 2-0 win over Al Ahly. Both Porto and Al Ahly remain with one point.Porto took an early lead through Samu Aghehowa's penalty in a first half that they dominated.Telasco Segovia equalised for Miami before Messi's free-kick sealed an impressive win in what was expected to be an easy match for Porto, with Miami becoming the first club from MLS to secure a win over European opposition in an official competition. Inter Miami, partly owned by David Beckham, began their MLS journey in 2020 and enhanced their status by signing Messi in 2023.Messi showed his class from the beginning, creating an early chance for Luis Suarez.

NEW DELHI: As India gear up for the opening Test of the five-match series against England at Headingley, Leeds, all eyes are on the playing XI. With Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma having stepped away from red-ball cricket, this tour signals a new era under the youthful leadership of Shubman Gill Among the front-runners for the pivotal batting position is Sai Sudharsan, whose explosive IPL form and fearless stroke play have catapulted him into national reckoning.However, veteran domestic performer Abhimanyu Easwaran stands as a compelling alternative. With nearly 8,000 first-class runs and 27 centuries to his name, Easwaran represents a tried-and-tested option in swinging English conditions.Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif weighed in strongly on the matter. Taking to social media, Kaif cautioned head coach Gautam Gambhir not to overlook proven performers.“Abhimanyu Easwaran deserves to be in the playing XI before Sai Sudarshan. Easwaran's 27 first-class hundreds, almost 8k FC runs need to be respected. By dropping Sarfaraz, someone who scored runs for India A in England, selectors made a mistake.They shouldn't repeat it by keeping Easwaran out of Leeds Test,” Kaif wrote on his official X account,” Kaif wrote.There’s also buzz around Dhruv Jurel, who impressed during India A’s recent assignments and could offer dual value as a wicketkeeper-batter, depending on team balance.In English Test conditions, more than just recent form, it’s adaptability, patience, and grit that count. Each session can present a new challenge — be it cloud cover, seam movement, or late swing. For India’s emerging talents, this series is not just about runs and wickets, but about showing character.Shubman Gill (C), Rishabh Pant (VC & WK), Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Karun Nair, Nitish Reddy, Ravindra Jadeja, Dhruv Jurel (WK), Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohd.

'Wait until August to see what kind of style it’s going to be': Shubman Gill ahead of Headingley Test

You mentioned the absence of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma earlier. Do you think Kohli should have delayed his retirement?

Finally, what’s your favourite moment playing against India? And your prediction for this series?

NEW DELHI: When India take the field against England in the opening Test at Headingley in Leeds, new Test captain Shubman Gill will be counting on his premier pacer Jasprit Bumrah to do what he does best: strike early, rattle the English batters, knock over stumps, induce edges, and most importantly, give India a 1-0 lead in the series.However, with BCCI chief selector Ajit Agarkar confirming that Bumrah will not feature in all five Tests, Gill will have to manage his spearhead's workload smartly and deploy him strategically across the series.Former England captain David Gower believes Gill must be tactical in how he uses Bumrah, India's biggest bowling weapon.Bumrah has an impressive record in England, with 37 wickets in 9 Tests. Overall, he has picked up 60 wickets in 14 Tests against England.As India gear up for the high-profile five-match series starting June 20,caught up with the legendary Gower, who represented England in 117 Tests, scoring 8,231 runs at an average of 44.25, including 18 centuries and 39 half-centuries.Let’s put it this way—every team travels intending to make history and do well.I remember, many years ago, when we toured India, Australia, or even the West Indies—though that was rarer—we didn’t expect to win. But every team travels with positive thoughts. Yes, when you lose two of your greatest players from the past decade, like India have, you do lose some experience. Take Virat Kohli, for example. A couple of tours ago, he struggled in England, then came back and used that experience to produce fantastic cricket. You need to acquire that experience, and quickly. International cricket conditions vary, but perhaps not as much as they used to. It’s not quite as daunting for Indian players to come to England now as it was 20–30 years ago. India's first Test win in England came quite late—it was under Ajit Wadekar. But in the last 20–30 years, there has been a lot of good history. A positive attitude will help. That said, England will certainly be pleased not to be facing those two Indian greats this time. On paper, it makes their task a bit easier. But England won’t take this series lightly. India remain strong—even with change and transition, teams can surprise people.Every captain is under pressure. And these days, it's perhaps even more intense than in my time. Ultimately, it's the results that dictate the reaction from fans and media. In my day, we had newspapers and a bit of TV to deal with. Now, there are thousands of media outlets and social media reactions are instant. The good news for Shubman is that there’s usually a degree of understanding when a new captain takes over, especially under such circumstances. Teams often rally behind a new captain—they’re all in the same boat. As a captain, yes, you have to lead and make decisions, but you shouldn’t be alone. Teammates should be encouraged to contribute ideas. That collective spirit is essential. As a player, Shubman’s runs have mostly come in India. He didn’t have a great tour of Australia, so that might weigh on his mind. He is a beautiful player, but getting runs now is vital to solidify his position as captain. Of course, England’s bowling attack is still good, despite some injuries and form concerns. Shubman will need to find his method against them. That’s part of the challenge.Absolutely. The relationship between a new captain and the coach is crucial. They must be on the same page. Captaincy is about communication—instilling plans in the players, and making them work. If the coach and captain are aligned, it becomes easier. If not, it can be tricky. That’s why you appoint experienced people—to offer wisdom and guidance. That said, I still believe the captain should lead. He’s the one making decisions on the field, adjusting bowling changes, responding in real-time. Good off-field support helps, but it’s Shubman’s job to establish himself as the leader.Yes. When you lose two greats, the next senior players become vital. I’ve always enjoyed watching KL Rahul. He’s human—he’ll make mistakes—but he’s a very good player. This is a great opportunity for him to use his experience and support the new captain. No matter how cricket evolves, certain truths remain. Good leadership matters, but so does individual responsibility. Every player must take ownership of their batting, bowling, fielding—and contribute ideas. That’s how a team becomes successful.Jasprit Bumrah is a fantastic bowler—world-class. His fitness is crucial. If I were England, I’d prefer he doesn’t play at all! If India need to manage his workload, they must be strategic—look at pitch conditions, the opposition, and figure out where he can make the most impact. English pitches are usually decent—not overly bowler-friendly—so someone of Bumrah’s quality can be the difference. If he’s even 75–80% fit, I’d still want him in the XI. India will need to be smart and flexible, depending on how he’s feeling and what conditions demand.I enjoy the culture that Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum have introduced. The atmosphere in the dressing room is positive. That said, I would prefer it to be a bit smarter. The term ‘Bazball’ oversimplifies it. McCullum himself reportedly dislikes the word. In the Ashes a couple of years ago, had England been smarter—especially at Lord’s—they could have won. Stokes was the only one who dug in while others got out hooking. That session arguably cost England the Ashes. Players need to know when to dig in and when to accelerate. The Australians in the 90s did this well. I’d love to see a balanced approach with some gritty, old-school Test batting. Some say Alastair Cook wouldn’t get into this current side, but for me, having one player you can rely on to be there every day is invaluable.Only Virat knows what’s in his head. He had a good IPL, and people obviously want to see a player of his calibre for as long as possible. But these are deeply personal decisions. Ending a Test career is a huge moment. I’d never criticise anyone for choosing to step away when they feel it’s right. What I really respect is Virat’s continued belief in the value of Test cricket. After the IPL, he said that winning in Tests is “five times better. ” For someone of his stature to say that is massive. It sends an important message, especially in an era where white-ball formats dominate the conversation.My favourite moment would be winning the 1984–85 series in India. That was a challenging tour, on and off the field. To come out on top against a team with players like Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev was special. As for this series, I have to back England—home advantage, changes in the Indian side, a bit of vulnerability. I’ll say England win 3-1. Just a fun prediction, of course—no one really knows.","Former England captain David Gower believes Shubman Gill must be tactical in how he uses Jasprit Bumrah, India's biggest bowling weapon.

The trade that brought Luka Doncic may have quietly opened up a bigger problem

Windy ADVISES Luka Doncic to SIGN THE EXTENSION after Lakers' sale 🗣️ 'COULDN'T BE BETTER!' | Get Up

The Lakers made a power move by trading for Luka Doncic—but in doing so, they might’ve left their back door wide open. Anthony Davis ’ departure didn’t just leave a roster spot—it left a defensive void. The Timberwolves exposed it in Game 3, and analysts like Brian Windhorst are now warning what’s at stake. Without rim protection, all that offensive talent could go to waste.After the significant trade of Anthony Davis in February—where he was moved to Dallas for Luka Doncic—Los Angeles lost more than just an All-Star. They also lost a crucial defensive anchor. In the first round of the playoffs, Jaxson Hayes filled in for Davis, and the Lakers suffered: Minnesota outscored them 56‑26 in the paint in Game 3 alone. Windhorst mentions that without a reliable rim defender, perimeter skills don’t carry much weight — especially when the matchups change sides.Luka Doncic, LeBron James, and Austin Reaves are great on offense, but they don’t provide solid defense. League analysts have noted the team's ineffective closeouts and the vulnerability in the paint throughout the series. JJ Redick summed it up well — ""We don’t have rim protection.If we let players get by us, we’re going to give up points."" Their playoff defensive rating was among the worst, which is exactly the issue Windhorst points out.Windhorst’s message was clear: if the Lakers intend to run their perimeter-heavy lineup long-term, they must invest in interior defense. He didn’t call for another superstar, just “somebody who can defend at the rim”. They’ve got to find a solid athletic center—think Onyeka Okongwu or Mitchell Robinson—whether it’s through free agency, a minor trade, or the draft to really own their paint.The Lakers have choices. They might go after experienced rim-protectors like Clint Capela or Brook Lopez, look into expiring contracts like Daniel Gafford, or aim for long-term potential with a player like Nicolas Claxton. One thing's for sure: their offense won't hit its peak unless they secure the paint.Also Read: Lonzo Ball was supposed to revive the Los Angeles Lakers but something went wrong The Lakers kicked off the offseason with a bang—Luka Doncic, LeBron James, and Austin Reaves all on board—but the playoffs showed some cracks in their foundation. Brian Windhorst’s warning is straightforward yet tough: having talent isn’t enough without a solid defensive anchor. As the offseason chatter intensifies, the Lakers’ top priority is to secure that cornerstone. If they fail, even their star trio might not shine as bright.","The Lakers traded Anthony Davis to the Dallas Mavericks for Luka Doncic.

Urban Meyer Critiques NCAA Over 2010 Ohio State Tattoo Scandal Penalties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/college-football/urban-meyer-critiques-ncaa-over-2010-ohio-state-tattoo-scandal-penalties/articleshow/121961257.cms,"Image Source: Getty

Urban Meyer says there was no competitive advantage for Ohio State

“Competitive advantage: zero”

NCAA’s harsh penalties cost Ohio State a national championship run

“we would have played Notre Dame.”

Urban Meyer, the former Ohio State head coach, has a few particular things he wishes NCAA officials would have done differently in responding to the infamous 2010 tattoo scandal that nearly sunk the Buckeyes program. He inherited the fallout from the scandal, one that started in 2010 but went on long after Meyer got to Columbus, including a 2012 postseason ban that expunged any shot Meyer and an undefeated Buckeyes team had at competing for the national title. In a recent interview on The Triple Option podcast, Meyer said the sanctions were too severe, notably since the violations (trading memorabilia for tattoos) had nothing to do with competitive advantage, but rather were inherently subjective.The crux of the problem at hand, a few players trading memorabilia for ink, played no role in the Buckeyes' on-field success, Meyer said,because such things did not enhance performance or provide an advantage in terms of recruiting, he stressed. The controversy did not concern boosters or excessive inducements during the recruitment process, or even tampering, merely players exchanging souvenirs for tattoos.He also noted that the situation was overblown in hindsight. “There were some players trading… memorabilia for tattoos. That’s it,” he said, suggesting that the national furor and NCAA response far exceeded the offense. In the current NIL landscape, that type of activity hardly raises an eyebrow. Meyer argued that it did not give Ohio State an advantage in winning games or securing the best players.The scandal also led to Ohio State vacating all 12 wins from the 2010 season and imposed a postseason ban that impacted the 2012 team, Meyer’s first season in Columbus. That team was undefeated, but was ineligible to play for a national title. Meyer noted that his team missed the so-called football glory by pointing out thatAlso Read: Boston College gives first official look at new football uniforms for 2025 season Jim Tressel received a five-year show-cause penalty and a $250,000 fine for allegedly lying about the violations. While it was still wrong the way Tressel handled it, Meyer felt that the punishment was too much, especially at a time when players are profiting off their name, image, and likeness so openly. “The inconsistency of that penalty, to this day, still bothers me,” Meyer said, lamenting how quickly guidelines for college football have adjusted since that time.","Former Ohio State coach Urban Meyer says there was no competitive advantage for the Buckeyes in the 2010 tattoo scandal.

Dillingham praised Leavitt as a champion when it comes to work ethic, pointing out his play-making ability, both in rhythm and off schedule, and noting that he scrambles a lot like Jake Plummer did here, while at ASU.

Trent Frederic’s past stats show potential but raise questions



Connor McDavid and Evan Bouchard remain top priority



After losing Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final, most teams would take a breath before launching into contract talks. But Edmonton Oilers general manager Stan Bowman appears to be wasting no time. Reports now confirm that the team is working on a max-term eight-year deal with forward Trent Frederic, a move that’s catching many off guard.Frederic, who was acquired mid-season from the Boston Bruins, played a minor role in the Oilers' postseason, notching only four points. He appeared in just one regular-season game after arriving in Edmonton. Despite his limited involvement, Bowman is clearly banking on Frederic's upside and long-term value.In 2023–24 with the Boston Bruins, Trent Frederic had a breakout campaign, scoring 18 goals and tallying 40 points across 79 games. Before his injury this season, he managed eight goals and 15 points in 57 games. Those numbers aren’t elite, but they are steady for a middle-six forward.Edmonton likely sees Frederic as a valuable depth piece, someone who can be a physical presence and offer secondary scoring. However, critics argue the contract term is a risky gamble, especially since Frederic hasn’t had the opportunity to showcase himself in a playoff setting consistently.While the Trent Frederic deal is making headlines, it’s not the main storyline fans were expecting to hear after the Stanley Cup Final. The real spotlight is on superstars Connor McDavid and Evan Bouchard, both of whom become eligible for contract extensions when NHL free agency begins on July 1.McDavid, widely considered the best player in the world, has two years remaining on his deal, but locking him in long-term will be Edmonton’s biggest challenge. Bouchard, meanwhile, emerged as a defensive powerhouse this postseason and is due for a significant raise as well.Read more: NHL trade rumor: Don Cherry fuels spicy Brad Marchand conspiracy with wild Bruins return claim after Panthers Cup win The NHL offseason is officially underway, and Edmonton is wasting no time making headlines.","Edmonton Oilers general manager Stan Bowman appears to be wasting no time.

'Wait until August to see what kind of style it’s going to be': Shubman Gill ahead of Headingley Test

Poll Which player do you believe will have the biggest impact in the first Test against England? Jasprit Bumrah Shubman Gill

India's possible XI

Team India had an optional net session on the eve of the first Test against England at the Headingley Cricket Ground. For starters, it wasn't a full house as Rishabh Pant, Dhruv Jurel, Jasprit Bumrah, Akash Deep, Harshit Rana, Mohammed Siraj, Shardul Thakur, Nitish Kumar Reddy and Washington Sundar didn't come with the rest of the team for the afternoon session. On expected lines, it was hot and dry when the rest trained under the unforgiving sun.With the coin toss just few hours away, all the attention was on what India's lineup could be. Unlike the hosts, the visitors are yet to announce their combination for the series opener and captain Shubman Gill, too, kept cards close to his chest. When asked about the combination, Gill said they have one-two options ready and will take the final call after looking at the pitch.Both Gill and coach Gautam Gambhir did have a look at the playing surface and had no more than a 60-second conversation before resuming their respective business. As far as nets were concerned, KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal had long hits, Gill had another marathon session, Karun Nair played on all practice surfaces, Ravindra Jadeja spent considerable time on his batting, before chatting with coach Gambhir.It is very likely that Nair will return to India Playing XI at the No.3 position and big calls need to be taken regarding the bowling combination and the choice of all-rounders. Jaiswal, Rahul, Nair, Gill, Pant and Jadeja should be the top-six for the Indian cricket team and the seam bowling will feature Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj. With eight slots taken, the call now needs to be taken with the remaining three.The possibility of both Shardul Thakur and Nitish Reddy playing can't be ruled out as both would lend depth to the batting, and extra bowling option if needed. For the third seamer spot, Prasidh Krishna could make the cut as Arshdeep Singh bowled a very long spell in the nets - something which is not usual for a bowler who is expected to play next morning.READ ALSO: 'Respect the conditions' - Sachin Tendulkar's advice to Shubman Gill-led young Indian team Now where does that leave Kuldeep Yadav? There will be temptation to play the chinaman, especially in these dry conditions, but it would come at the cost of batting depth. The left-hander did bowl a lot and batted for a considerable period but it remains to be seen whether one all-rounder is benched to include the specialist spinner.It will not be a surprise if Kuldeep comes into the XI at the cost of a seam-bowling all-rounder but everything depends on what the management is thinking - batting depth or wickets.: KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Karun Nair, Shubman Gill, Rishabh Pant, Ravindra Jadeja, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Shardul Thakur, Jasprit Bumrah, Prasidh Krishna and Mohammed Siraj.","Team India had an optional net session on the eve of the first Test against England at the Headingley Cricket Ground.

C.J. Mosley retires with 1,000+ tackles and a dominant leadership presence



A career built on consistency and low-key leadership



Baltimore Ravens franchise player and New York Jets defensive captain C.J. Mosley has retired from professional football after a dominant decade-long career. A native of the Alabama Crimson Tide, C.J. Mosley was always thought to be the successor to Ray Lewis' throne in Baltimore—one that he took with steely resolve.C.J. Mosley started his NFL career as a first-round pick of the Baltimore Ravens in 2014. In five seasons, he became a four-time Pro Bowler, accumulated 579 tackles, 8.5 sacks, and nine interceptions. His selection of Baker Mayfield to seal the game in the final game of the 2018 regular season is among the most defining plays in recent Ravens history.Before the Ravens could hold him, the New York Jets signed him over the cap with a gigantic five-year, $85 million contract in 2019 to sign C.J. Mosley to the AFC East as the league's top-paid inside linebacker at the time.But his New York introduction was marred by injury. After a strong start with a pick-six, C.J. Mosley hurt his core muscle and played just two games of the 2019 season. He lost the 2020 season to the COVID-19 virus but returned with a vengeance with head coach Robert Saleh, and he was the foundation of the Jets' defense from 2021 to 2023.Between 2021 and 2023, Mosley accumulated 478 tackles and received his fifth and final Pro Bowl in 2022. In the 2024 season, he injured his toe and herniated a disk in his neck and played only four games.

As India step into a new era under Shubman Gill ’s leadership in the five-match Anderson–Tendulkar Trophy Test series against England, former England captain Alastair Cook has made a telling observation about the impact of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma ’s retirement from Test cricket.Speaking on The Overlap Cricket YouTube channel, Cook said the Indian dressing room has now entered a phase of reset - not just in terms of personnel, but in psychological and cultural dynamics. According to Cook, Kohli and Rohit were such commanding presences that their actions and decisions were rarely, if ever, challenged - regardless of performance.""What I can't work out and will find out obviously is by taking those two really experienced players out - Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli - who have been really a bit on the downslide, is the impact they have in the dressing room is now gone,"" Cook remarked.""No matter how… when you take senior players out like that, even if they are great leaders, they might get things wrong, but no one is ever questioning those two in that change room. So now there's almost a clean slate.""Kohli and Sharma's Test exits came last month, with the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, which India lost 3–1, being their last outings in the format. Kohli finished with 190 runs at an average of 23.75, including a century in the opening Test, while Rohit had a lean patch, managing only 31 runs in five innings.Cook acknowledged that, despite the absence of the two veterans, India's batting depth remains formidable.""One thing we know - they're going to be so talented. They could pick, I reckon, 18 batsmen almost of the same quality now. And it'll be really interesting to see whether that talent, without those two there - and I'm not saying they shouldn't be in - can rise to the occasion.""India's new-look side under Gill faces England's Bazball aggression in a series that is expected to test their adaptability and temperament.The first Test begins Friday at Headingley, marking the start of the Anderson–Tendulkar Trophy era, a tribute to two cricketing legends and a symbolic handover from one generation to the next.","Former England captain Alastair Cook says Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma's retirement from Test cricket has left India's dressing room in a state of reset.

IND vs ENG: Rishabh Pant opens up on chemistry with Shubman Gill and England challenge

One of cricket’s most storied rivalries has been given a historic new identity. The Board of Control for Cricket in India BCCI ) and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) have jointly announced the launch of the Anderson–Tendulkar Trophy, a prestigious honour that will now be awarded to the winner of every Test series between India and England.The upcoming five-match Test series, beginning at Headingley on Friday, will be the first contested under this new title. The trophy celebrates two of the most iconic names in the history of Test cricket - James Anderson, the highest wicket-taking fast bowler, and Sachin Tendulkar , the all-time leading run-scorer in the format.Previously, the series was played for the Pataudi Trophy in England and the Anthony De Mello Trophy in India. While those titles have now been unified, the legacy of the Pataudi family will continue with the introduction of the Pataudi Medal, which will be presented to the winning captain at the conclusion of each England–India Test series.Featuring etched images and engraved signatures of Anderson and Tendulkar, the new trophy is a tribute to two figures who shaped modern Test cricket through excellence, longevity, and sportsmanship.The ECB and BCCI described the creation of the Anderson–Tendulkar Trophy as a “celebration of mutual respect, performance, and cricketing history.”Sachin Tendulkar, who played 200 Test matches and scored a record 15,921 runs, described the format as foundational to his cricketing journey.“For me, Test cricket embodies life – you give your best, and if things go wrong, it gives you another day to regroup, think, unlearn, and bounce back. It is the highest form of the game that teaches you endurance, discipline and adaptability, against all odds,” Tendulkar said.“I owe my foundation to Test cricket… And now, as I share this recognition with my on-field challenger and off-field gentleman James, I hope that the world celebrates the essence of Test cricket even more — allowing it to traverse boundaries yet untrodden.”James Anderson, who retired earlier this year with 704 Test wickets in 188 matches, said the honour was deeply personal.“It’s a proud moment for me and my family to have this iconic series named after Sachin and myself. The rivalry between our two nations has always been something special — full of history, intensity and unforgettable moments,” Anderson said.“To be recognised in this way is a real honour. I’m looking forward to seeing the next chapter unfold in England this summer. It promises to be compelling, competitive cricket — exactly what you’d expect from two great sides.”The announcement was welcomed across cricketing boards and administrative leadership. ECB chair Richard Thompson called the initiative a tribute to two ambassadors of the game.“Jimmy and Sachin have given cricket fans around the world so many unforgettable moments. This trophy is a brilliant way to honour two absolute legends,” Thompson said.“The Pataudi family also has a hugely important place in the cricketing connections between our countries, and I'm pleased we will continue to honour their legacy through the awarding of the Pataudi Medal.”BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia said the naming reflects the lasting impact of both legends.“India and England have always shared a riveting cricketing rivalry. It's a matter of immense pride that the series will be named after Sachin Tendulkar and James Anderson,” Saikia said. “They lit up the game with brilliant performances that have inspired millions.”BCCI president Roger Binny added that the decision was not just ceremonial, but meaningful.“This is a truly momentous occasion. The ‘Anderson–Tendulkar Trophy’ will not only celebrate their individual legacies but also serve as a permanent reminder of the fierce yet respectful rivalry that has defined India–England Test cricket for decades.”Their individual records in this bilateral context further justify the naming. Tendulkar scored 2,535 runs against England in 32 Tests at an average of 51.73, including a memorable 193 at Headingley in 2002. Anderson, meanwhile, tormented Indian batters across eras, claiming 149 wickets in 39 matches at 25.47, including six five-wicket hauls.Off the field, both players have been recognised for their contributions: Anderson received a knighthood in 2024, and Tendulkar was awarded India’s highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, in 2014.","The Anderson–Tendulkar Trophy will now be awarded to the winner of every Test series between India and England.

From touchdowns to tabloids — Kelce’s numbers slide



Taylor Swift & Travis Kelce — Is love hurting the game?



Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is no stranger to the end zone—but lately, he’s been making more headlines off the field than on it. With swirling speculation that his star-studded relationship with Taylor Swift is impacting his game, Kelce finds himself at a rare crossroads. Is his NFL edge wearing thin under the weight of fame, or is this just a passing slump in a storied career? All eyes are now watching.The 2024 season marked Kelce’s lowest production in nearly a decade, recording just 823 receiving yards and only 3 touchdowns—well short of his usual 1,000+ yard standard. In Super Bowl LIX, he managed only 4 catches for 39 yards as Kansas City fell 40–22. Critics argue the dip reflects more than aging or injuries. Many point to his increasingly jet-set lifestyle, fueled by late-night events, media glare, and constant appearances with Swift.Sources close to the couple say the two are deeply committed—but balancing an NFL grind with a global popstar’s schedule hasn’t been seamless. Swift’s ongoing Eras Tour has meant frequent travel and less downtime for Kelce, reportedly disrupting his off-season prep. While some argue the relationship has offered emotional stability, others within NFL circles suggest it's sapped some of Kelce’s trademark discipline and edge.Kelce, however, insists he’s far from done. After signing on for his 13th season with the Chiefs, he’s back in training mode and looking to silence critics. In recent interviews, he’s dismissed the weight-loss rumors and emphasized mental readiness. Kelce has suggested that his slump is just “part of the grind,” and not a sign of decline.Also read: Eras Tour on horseback?

WV Raman backs Shubman Gill to fire in England: 'He needs the right support'

Mumbai: If you count the first Test between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in Galle, there have been 2586 instalments of the ‘purest’ format. Sachin Tendulkar and James Anderson, the two ornaments of Indian and English cricket, respectively, and the two most capped players in the history of Tests, have played in 388 of them, making it 15% of all Tests played. Should it come as a surprise that the prize for winning the series between India and England is the Anderson-Tendulkar trophy?The BCCI and the ECB have chosen to retire the Pataudi Trophy, the original name for the series, sparking criticism from legends Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev and the late Nawab of Pataudi’s wife, Sharmila Tagore. Tendulkar, while being happy with the honour, was not too comfortable with the Pataudi name not being incorporated. “This is a different trophy, I’m told, which is being named after Anderson and me,” Tendulkar told TOI from London.“It reflects our contribution to our respective nations and Tests. My first phone call was to the Pataudi family. I told them I’ve always respected my seniors. I wanted to keep Tiger Pataudi’s legacy alive.” It prompted Tendulkar to get into meetings with ICC president Jay Shah, the BCCI and the ECB to find the right options to honour Pataudi.“As Tiger Pataudi was known for his leadership, we came up with the idea of introducing the Pataudi Medal of Excellence for the winning captain. I informed the family. Now we have a new trophy and have kept the legacy of the great man alive,” said Tendulkar.The latest honour is another jewel in Tendulkar’s well-populated crown. England has always been special to him. The first of his 100 international hundreds came at Old Trafford, Manchester, in 1990. He also went past Don Bradman’s tally of 29 Test hundreds at Leeds, the venue of Friday’s first Test, in 2002.In 1992, Tendulkar also became Yorkshire’s first overseas signing, when he was still only 19. Tendulkar considers his stint at Yorkshire educational. “It was a bold move. People were extremely nice to me. It played an integral part in shaping me in terms of playing in conditions one is not familiar with.” And these unfamiliar conditions make fans guarded in terms of their optimism regarding the ShubmanGill-led side’s abilities in the fivematch series.But Tendulkar sounded positive. “This team is talented, and they will do something special if batters can put runs on the board.” What are the technical adjusments needed though to put those runs on the board? “One must quickly pick the length,” he said. “Everyone keeps talking about the line but the length becomes more important because in these conditions your hands need to be close to your body.” The maestro feels an impeccable forward defence is non-negotiable in England.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? “When you’re playing on the front foot, the hands need to be close to the body, so the forward defence becomes critical.” An attacking batter by instinct, Tendulkar said a forward defence essayed authoritatively can also scream intent. “A good solid defence need not convey that it’s a defensive approach. You can defend positively. And when there is a ball to be attacked, one should put that ball away,” he said.Thoughts veered quickly to the man the other half of the trophy is named after — James Anderson. Tendulkar and Anderson have crossed swords 14 times in Tests, with the Lancastrian swing and seam maestro having the better of those exchanges, dismissing Tendulkar a record nine times.Tendulkar said the first time he heard about Anderson was from Nasser Hussain. “Nasser had spoken highly about him. But I don’t think Nasser would have thought that he’s talking about someone who’s going to end up getting 700-plus Test wickets and play for such a long time. That doesn’t happen on its own. “It requires commitment, focus, discipline, sacrifice. All these things must come together to have such a magnificent career. ”What made Anderson such a tricky customer? “His wrist position and constant desire to evolve. Every outing, he was able to introduce something new. The wrist position allowed him to bowl terrific reverse swing. With the new ball, he was anyway dangerous. But because of his wrist position and the ability to use the shine, he brought in subtle variations to help him move the ball just enough to take the edge or beat the bat,” Tendulkar said.","Sachin Tendulkar and James Anderson are the two most capped players in the history of Tests, making it 15% of all Tests played.

Poll Is No. 4 the most crucial position in Test batting? Yes No

Shubman’s Big Test Begins! India’s Probable XI & Stokes’ Mind Games | ENG vs IND 1st Test Preview

Wanderers, 2013: All eyes were on the Indian dressing room as Cheteshwar Pujara and M Vijay were battling it out against Dale Steyn and Co. This was the first Test after Sachin Tendulkar had retired and the talk in the leadup had been all about his replacement at No. 4. Both Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli were padded up but when the latter walked in to bat at the fall of Vijay’s wicket, we all knew who would be the new king of Indian cricket This time around, vice-captain Rishabh Pant has poured cold water on all the speculation by announcing that new captain Shubman Gill will be the heir apparent to the recentlyretired Kohli at No. 4. It is clear indication that the team management now considers Gill as their most valuable batter. “Once Virat retired, coach Gambhir and I had a discussion and he wanted me to bat at No. 4, an idea that I endorsed as well,” Gill said in Leeds on Thursday.Tendulkar and Kohli turned No. 4 into a glamour slot with the 13,492 and 7564 runs they scored batting at that position, but both also got oneslot promotions when they first took up the role. Former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar , meanwhile, came down from No. 3 to No. 4, just like Gill, when he made that slot his own back in the 1980s.“I was batting at No. 3 before but when Vishy (GR Viswanath) retired, I was asked to come down at No.4. It was slightly easier to bat at No. 4 than No. 3, because by the time I came in to bat, the ball often got slightly older,” Vengsarkar told TOI.It was the Mumbai right-hander’s brilliant run with the bat at No. 4, when he got two centuries and a halfcentury, that helped India win a Test series in England in 1986. “That was one series where I wasn’t always getting the cushion of playing against the older ball. Our top three wasn’t in the best of touch and I was often batting pretty early on. But at the end of the day, it’s a game of confidence,” Vengsarkar said.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? In the second innings of the second Test, when the master right-hander scored a 102 not out to seal the series, he had come out with the score reading 9-2. While Vengsarkar went into that England series having scored runs in that part of the world before, Gill hasn’t had a very good run in England. In the three Tests in England prior to this, the new captain aggregates a paltry 88. He needs to turn that record around pretty fast. The ball swinging in has been a cause of worry for the 25-year-old, and the new skipper has in the past often found his stumps rattled.“The one suggestion I can give Gill is that he should try to get his bat down a little straighter instead of it coming down from gully, like it is right now. The right forearm should touch his waist as he looks to play the ball. That will allow him to play straighter,” Vengsarkar said.The dual job of captaincy and batting at No. 4 is another aspect that the Mumbai man had handled pretty well during his playing days. Gill will have to do the same again in challenging conditions. The fact that there is a bit of inexperience around him may make this slightly difficult. But Vengsarkar believes Gill has the ability to deal with the pressure, given his natural talent.",Shubman Gill will bat at No. 4 for India in the first Test against England. The 25-year-old is the heir apparent to the recentlyretired Virat Kohli. Former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar says Gill should play his bat straighter.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121965174,imgsize-77006,width-400,resizemode-4/121965174.jpg"

2025 highlights: Familiar faces and dramatic falls



Is it just madness or tradition





Every year on a steep hill in Gloucestershire, England, hundreds gather to chase a rolling 7-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down a dangerously steep slope. Known as the Cooper’s Hill Cheese Rolling Contest, the event is chaotic, absurd, and completely thrilling. With participants tumbling, somersaulting, and crashing their way to the bottom, the headline “People sprint to catch a 7-pound wheel of cheese” is technically accurate, but it doesn’t quite capture the madness, tradition, and injuries that define this bizarre British spectacle. So, is it a good headline? That depends on what you’re hoping to convey.The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. Dating back at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize. It sounds simple, but the event is notorious for its steep incline, dangerous tumbles, and frequent injuries.The hill is so steep that it's nearly impossible to stay upright. Most participants end up tumbling head over heels, colliding with each other or the ground.Gravity takes over quickly, and the cheese, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, is almost never actually caught. Still, competitors willingly risk sprains, fractures, and concussions for a shot at glory and a round of cheese.This year, German YouTuber Tom Kopke claimed victory for the second year in a row. Shirtless and triumphant, he declared, “I risked my life for this. It’s my cheese. Back to back.” On the women’s side, Ava Sender Logan from London tumbled repeatedly but emerged victorious, saying, “It felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head. I’m fine.” Around them, spectators packed the woods and fences for a glimpse of the chaos.While the event may seem absurd to outsiders, for locals and returning participants, it’s a point of pride and cultural identity. Despite calls to regulate or cancel it over safety concerns, the contest continues to thrive, drawing international competitors and media attention. Volunteers, medics, and long-time residents treat it as an important local tradition","The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire.

England too are entering a transition phase, trying to bounce back after missing out on the finals in previous editions.For India, much will depend on K.L. Rahul, who returns to the top of the order. His strong performances in England during past tours make him a key figure. The return of Karun Nair to the Test setup has also created a buzz, especially after his dominant domestic season.On the other hand, England will once again look to Joe Root, the country’s all-time leading Test scorer, to anchor the batting lineup. Youngster Jacob Bethell may not start immediately, but remains a bright future prospect.With injuries to key fast bowlers, Chris Woakes will carry a big responsibility with the ball.India’s pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, ranked the No.1 Test bowler in the world, will play a crucial role, though his appearances may be limited due to workload management.Shubman Gill (C), Rishabh Pant (VC & WK), Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Karun Nair, Nitish Reddy, Ravindra Jadeja, Dhruv Jurel (WK), Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohd.

NEW DELHI: The much-anticipated five-match Test series between India and England kicks off on Friday, June 20, at Headingley, Leeds.As both teams aim for a strong start in the new World Test Championship cycle, weather conditions might play a pivotal role in the outcome of the opening encounter.Cricket fans hoping for an uninterrupted start to the series will be glad to know that the weather on Day 1 (Friday, June 20) looks promising. The forecast indicates high clouds and warm conditions with a high of 31°C and only a 5% chance of rain. The day is expected to remain mostly clear and mild, ideal for a full day’s play.However, Day 2 (Saturday, June 21) brings a change. Showers are predicted around the afternoon, with a 60% chance of precipitation. This could lead to some interruptions during play, though the morning session is expected to be relatively dry.Sunday (Day 3, June 22): A significant drop in temperature (high of 22°C, low of 12°C) with early showers but otherwise partly cloudy skies and only a 4% chance of rain.Monday (Day 4, June 23): Partly sunny and breezy with a 25% chance of a brief morning shower.Tuesday (Day 5, June 24): Cloudy start but clearing skies expected later; 25% chance of rain.From the early pictures, we can suggest that the Headingley pitch is going to be a green one.It is known for assisting seam and swing bowlers, especially in the first two days. Overcast conditions could further enhance movement off the seam.Batters will need to apply themselves early, but the pitch tends to flatten out slightly from Day 3 onwards. Spinners might come into play later in the match as footmarks develop.Overall, while rain may affect Day 2, the rest of the Test should see plenty of action.Shubman Gill (C), Rishabh Pant (VC & WK), Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Karun Nair, Nitish Reddy, Ravindra Jadeja, Dhruv Jurel (WK), Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohd.
