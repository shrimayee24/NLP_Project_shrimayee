Robert Irwin announces Los Angeles Rams' 2025 NFL Draft pick from Pennsylvania

Konata Mumpfield’s college career at Pitt showcased his NFL potential

In a heartwarming and unexpected moment during the 2025 NFL Draft, Australian wildlife conservationist Robert Irwin took center stage to announce a late-round draft pick — and he did it in true Aussie style. Speaking from the Australia Zoo in Queensland, Irwin, with a massive snake draped casually around his shoulders, revealed the Los Angeles Rams ’ selection at pick No. 242: Konata Mumpfield, a standout wide receiver from the University of Pittsburgh.The NFL has increasingly sought to create unique and memorable moments during its annual draft, and this year was no exception. In a video posted by the league, Robert Irwin's announcement merged wildlife conservation and football excitement in a way only he could deliver. His appearance, complete with a snake companion, was both a nod to his famous late father Steve Irwin’s legacy and a testament to the NFL’s growing international reach.This special moment not only delighted NFL fans but also introduced a broader audience to the late stages of the draft, a time when hidden gems like Mumpfield often get their start.Konata Mumpfield’s journey to the NFL wasn’t paved with flashy headlines, but his on-field performance spoke volumes. During the 2024 season with the Pittsburgh Panthers, Mumpfield compiled 52 receptions for 813 yards, averaging an impressive 15.6 yards per catch. His five touchdowns helped solidify his status as a reliable playmaker and earned him an All-ACC Honorable Mention.Statistically, Mumpfield led Pitt in receptions (tied), receiving yards, and yards per catch — clear evidence of his crucial role in the Panthers’ offense.While Mumpfield might not possess elite size or blazing speed, scouts believe his technical skills will help him thrive in the NFL. ""What Mumpfield lacks in size and speed for the position, he makes up for with outstanding route running and a professional mentality,"" noted respected NFL analyst Eric Edholm.Also Read: ""It's a quiet rebellion”: Jason Kelce slammed for ""quietly"" supporting Donald Trump’s America First movement with new fashion line Landing Mumpfield in the seventh round could prove to be a savvy move for the Rams, a franchise known for uncovering talent in unexpected places.

Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni's lawsuit could drag Taylor Swift into the legal spotlight

Critics warn that Taylor Swift’s good girl persona could finally crack under scrutiny

In a twist no one saw coming, Taylor Swift ’s famously polished “good girl” image could face its biggest test yet — and it’s all tied to the intensifying legal drama between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni . While Swift isn’t directly involved in the lawsuits, her close friendship with Lively and alleged behind-the-scenes influence on the movie It Ends With Us has placed her uncomfortably close to the fire.The heart of the conflict revolves around dueling lawsuits. Blake Lively has accused Justin Baldoni of sexual harassment and orchestrating a smear campaign during the filming of It Ends With Us. In retaliation, Baldoni countersued Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds, and her publicist Leslie Sloane for defamation.Swift’s name reportedly came up because she allegedly helped ""pressure"" Baldoni to change a major scene and also contributed a song to the movie’s soundtrack. A source told People magazine, “Anyone that had any knowledge of this situation will be subpoenaed, no matter their celebrity status.” Another insider countered, emphasizing that Swift and Hugh Jackman, another close friend, are “not aware of anything going on.”Commentator Candace Owens didn’t mince words, claiming that 2025 has been a year of karma catching up to celebrities. “Their image of Taylor Swift is going to be shattered once these text messages become public because I have never bought the good girl thing that she pitches,” Owens said on her Candace podcast. She suggested Swift has “become addicted” to the victim narrative since her public feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian.Owens added, “I really do feel 2025 has just been this game of karma, and a lot of people are being exposed for who they truly are.”Despite the growing media frenzy, sources close to Swift maintain that her role is nonexistent. As an insider told Us Weekly, “Taylor has always been Blake’s friend, but Taylor does not have any involvement in the case. She wasn’t a part of the movie. Taylor was not a producer on the film and had no creative involvement.”Also Read: Was Travis Kelce's beau Taylor Swift hurt by Blake Lively’s lawsuit?

Sachin Tendulkar at 52: Power, Pride, and a Nation’s Pulse

The expression on captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni ’s face said it all as Chennai Super Kings suffered another defeat—this time a five-wicket loss to Sunrisers Hyderabad at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Friday. A visibly disappointed Dhoni admitted that a total of 154 was far from “justifiable” on a Chepauk pitch that didn’t have any demons, as SRH dealt a near-fatal blow to CSK’s IPL 2025 play-off chances.Sunrisers chased down the modest target in just 18.4 overs. Dhoni pointed out that it's always tough when several players fail to deliver simultaneously.He also believed that SRH batted under slightly tougher conditions in the second innings, yet CSK couldn't capitalise. For the skipper, the lack of cohesion in the team's overall effort was most frustrating.""I think we kept losing wickets and another thing is in the first innings the wicket was slightly better and 157 wasn't a justifiable score,"" Dhoni said after CSK’s loss.""It wasn't turning a lot, a little two-paced but nothing out of the ordinary. Yes, second innings there was a bit of help. Our spinners, the quality was there and they were bowling in the right areas, but we were 15-20 runs short,"" he added.Commenting on Dewald Brevis’ performance, Dhoni said, ""[On Brevis] I think he batted really well and we needed that in the middle order. When the spinners come in, you do it either by batsmanship or picking the right areas, but that's an area where we want to improve because middle overs are crucial.""Reflecting on the broader issues plaguing the team, Dhoni didn’t hold back.""In a tournament like this, if there are one or two areas to plug in the holes it's good, but when a majority of the players are not doing well you need to make changes. You can't just keep going. We are just not putting enough runs on the board,"" he said.With this win, SRH have moved up to eighth place on the points table, registering three wins and six losses for a total of six points.CSK, meanwhile, sit at the bottom with just two wins from nine games and only four points to show.","Chennai Super Kings lost by five wickets to Sunrisers Hyderabad on Friday.

Desmond Watson signs with Buccaneers, becomes heaviest player ever to join an NFL team



After going undrafted in the 2025 NFL Draft, Desmond Watson , one of the Florida Gators ' most beloved fan favorites, has landed a spot with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers . The towering 6-foot-5, 464-pound defensive tackle inked an undrafted free agent contract with the Buccaneers just moments after the draft ended, marking him as the team's first UDFA signing. The contract includes a $20,000 signing bonus and $50,000 in guaranteed money, offering Watson a strong foundation as he embarks on his NFL journey.Desmond Watson's unique combination of size and skill makes him a standout figure in the NFL. At 464 pounds, Watson now holds the record as the heaviest player in NFL history , surpassing the previous record set by offensive tackle Aaron Gibson by an impressive 54 pounds. Watson joins a talented group of nose tackles in Tampa Bay, including Vita Vea and Greg Gaines. Over his collegiate career, Watson accumulated 63 tackles, 1.5 sacks, and a memorable forced fumble and recovery in 2022, which cemented his place in Gators history.Though Watson was not invited to the NFL Scouting Combine, his performance at Florida's Pro Day captured the attention of scouts. He clocked an impressive 5.95-second 40-yard dash, making him the third slowest runner of all time at his size but still managing to impress those in attendance. Additionally, Watson's 36 reps on the bench press would have been the highest at the Combine, demonstrating his raw strength and athleticism despite his considerable size.Tampa Bay's head coach, Billy Napier, praised Watson’s exceptional abilities. ""He's a unicorn. That stature,"" Napier said at the Pro Day. ""And then, you get to know Des. He's extremely intelligent. He's got a great sense of humor. He was a great teammate. Obviously showed up in good shape (for pro day). He'll get his shot, and I'm hoping he'll make the most of it.""What makes Watson's journey even more remarkable is his hometown connection to Tampa Bay. Born and raised in Plant City, Florida, Watson will now have the opportunity to play just hours away from where he made his mark both in high school at Armwood and in college with the Gators. This proximity adds an extra layer of excitement as he competes for a spot on the Buccaneers' roster, with the potential to play in front of a familiar Florida crowd in the NFL.While Watson's weight has been a topic of discussion throughout his career, it’s clear he has made significant strides. Prior to the draft, Watson spoke about his weight management efforts: ""There (are) times where I do basically starving and stuff like that... I didn’t feel confident that way. I didn’t feel strong, I didn’t feel fast. I feel like right now is the best I felt with the process of losing weight.""Watson’s commitment to fitness has been evident as he worked with a weight and fitness specialist leading up to the draft. His goal of losing approximately 100 pounds was achieved through a disciplined diet that cut out sugar and starches, relying on peas, beans, chili, and spinach as key components of his meals.As the Buccaneers continue to strengthen their roster, Watson's signing marks a significant opportunity for him to prove himself. The team had already bolstered their edge rushing corps with two new signings in the 2025 draft but left room for a potential interior defensive lineman. With no other interior D-linemen drafted, Watson's chance to compete for a backup role behind Pro Bowler Vita Vea is very much alive.Desmond Watson's path to the NFL may have been unconventional, but his hard work, dedication, and Florida roots have given him the chance to shine at the highest level of football. Whether or not he secures a starting position, one thing is clear—Watson’s journey is just beginning, and fans across Florida will be cheering him on every step of the way.Also Read: ""Clueless for 50 years"": ESPN’s Mel Kiper Jr. slams NFL teams for letting Shedeur Sanders slip to fifth round","Desmond Watson is the heaviest player ever to join an NFL team at 464 pounds.

NEW DELHI: In a significant move ahead of their crucial IPL 2025 clash against Punjab Kings (PBKS), Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) dropped Moeen Ali and brought in Caribbean all-rounder Rovman Powell , who was bought for Rs 1.5 crore in the auction.Along with Powell, KKR also handed a game to left-arm pacer Chetan Sakariya, replacing Ramandeep Singh.At the toss, Punjab Kings captain Shreyas Iyer elected to bat first at Eden Gardens . PBKS made two changes as well, bringing in Glenn Maxwell and Azmatullah Omarzai for Marcus Stoinis and Xavier Bartlett.KKR skipper Ajinkya Rahane stressed the importance of positive cricket at the toss. He acknowledged the team’s struggles with the bat and called for a braver approach. ""The bowling unit has done well, but our batters need to be more fearless,"" Rahane said.This fixture carries extra emotional weight, with Shreyas Iyer returning to Eden Gardens in opposition colours.Just last season, Iyer led KKR to their first title in ten years. Released in a surprise off-season decision, Iyer has flourished at PBKS under Ricky Ponting’s guidance, taking his side into the playoff hunt. He has already scored 263 runs this season, though he arrives for this game with a slight dip in form.KKR, meanwhile, are desperate to revive their campaign after five losses in eight games. Their batting lineup has lacked consistency, with Andre Russell and Rinku Singh struggling for finishes. The inclusion of Rovman Powell is expected to inject some much-needed power in the middle order.Spin, once KKR’s strength at Eden, has not yielded the expected results this season, adding to their headaches. Varun Chakaravarthy and Sunil Narine have been among wickets but haven’t dominated matches.Punjab Kings, on the other hand, appear more settled, with young talents like Priyansh Arya and key bowlers like Arshdeep Singh and Yuzvendra Chahal offering balance.KKR must win at least five of their remaining six games to realistically stay in the playoff race.Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Rovman Powell, Vaibhav Arora, Chetan Sakariya, Harshit Rana, Varun Chakaravarthy.Priyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh, Shreyas Iyer (c), Josh Inglis (wk), Nehal Wadhera, Shashank Singh, Glenn Maxwell, Azmatullah Omarzai, Marco Jansen, Arshdeep Singh, Yuzvendra Chahal.",Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) drop Moeen Ali and bring in Rovman Powell.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

NEW DELHI: Former Chennai Super Kings star Suresh Raina has come down heavily on the CSK management following the team's continued struggles in IPL 2025. Raina expressed his disappointment after CSK suffered a five-wicket defeat to Sunrisers Hyderabad at Chepauk on Friday, a loss that left their playoff hopes hanging by a thread.Raina, speaking on Star Sports Network, said MS Dhoni ’s deep involvement in the team’s operations meant poor auction decisions were unlikely during his peak years.Also See: PBKS vs KKR Live Score, IPL 2025 “Kashi sir has handled the administration for 30-40 years now, and now Rupa ma'am is managing cricket affairs like player recruitment. In the past, even if MS wasn’t physically at the auction, he was involved in every discussion. But this time, MS knows it was not a good auction... (Dhoni asa auction nahi kar shakta) Dhoni would never have allowed a bad auction,” Raina said.Highlighting Dhoni’s commitment, Raina pointed out that even at 43, Dhoni is still leading from the front, keeping wickets and captaining the side with full effort.""He’s playing for the brand, the name, and the fans. But what about the others? Players bought for Rs 18–20 crores aren’t stepping up when it matters.""Raina emphasised that some of the long-serving players continue to repeat mistakes, and accountability is needed. “MS doesn’t need anyone to tell him what’s going wrong. The way he walked off after the toss and post-match, a big meeting is surely on the cards,"" Raina concluded.Meanwhile, Sunrisers Hyderabad broke their Chepauk jinx with a comfortable chase of 155, riding on Ishan Kishan’s 44 and Kamindu Mendis’s unbeaten 32.Hyderabad's bowlers, led by Harshal Patel (4-28) and Pat Cummins (2-21), restricted CSK to just 154.Chennai’s batting woes continued as Shaik Rasheed, Sam Curran, and Ayush Mahtre fell cheaply, despite Dewald Brevis’ promising 42 on debut.With their seventh defeat, CSK, currently down in the last position on the IPL points table, now face an uphill task to reach the playoffs.",Former Chennai Super Kings star Suresh Raina has come down heavily on the CSK management.

NEW DELHI: Rain played spoilsport at Eden Gardens during the Kolkata Knight Riders versus Punjab Kings clash in IPL 2025, forcing players off the field after just one over of KKR’s innings. Kolkata were seven for no loss when the heavens opened up, accompanied by strong winds that made it tough for the groundstaff to manage the covers.As per match officials, overs would only start reducing if play couldn't resume by 10:35 PM local time.Until then, fans and players alike remained hopeful as visuals showed KKR players warming up near the sidelines once the rain eased.However, a full ground cover was in place, and the staff, struggling without sufficient weights, sat on the covers to prevent them from blowing away.Despite the tricky conditions, the night remained young with ample time for a possible restart.As per IPL playing conditions, The cut-off time for a 5-over contest is 11.44 pm IST.If the game is reduced to the minimum five overs, KKR will need to chase 61 runs.Before the interruption, Punjab Kings had posted a strong total of 201/4 thanks to brilliant half-centuries from Priyansh Arya and Prabhsimran Singh. Arya dazzled with a fluent 69 off 35 balls, while Prabhsimran overcame a slow start to hammer 83 off 49 balls. Their 120-run opening stand set the foundation for a massive score.However, Kolkata Knight Riders pulled things back in the death overs. Vaibhav Arora (2/34) and Andre Russell (1/27) were key in restricting the damage, with KKR conceding just 40 runs and grabbing two wickets in the final five overs.Arya and Prabhsimran had made merry on a true batting surface, unlike previous Eden Gardens pitches that tended to slow down. Arya’s elegant strokeplay and Prabhsimran’s late acceleration meant PBKS were initially eyeing 230-plus before KKR’s bowlers fought back.","Rain interrupts IPL 2025 clash between Kolkata Knight Riders and Punjab Kings.

Key concerns for the Milwaukee Bucks

Doc Rivers remains confident despite 0-2 deficit

What the Bucks need to do differently

Theare in a must-win situation as they face the Indiana Pacers in Game 3 of their playoff series. Down 2-0, the Bucks need a spark to turn things around—and all eyes are onThe good news for Milwaukee Bucks fans is that Giannis Antetokounmpo will suit up tonight. Despite the team’s struggles in the first two games, the Greek Freak has been dominant, dropping 34 points, 18 rebounds, and 7 assists in Game 2. His presence alone gives Milwaukee a fighting chance, but he can’t do it alone.The injury report is mostly clean for Milwaukee, with only one player under scrutiny:- Tyler Smith (Questionable) – His absence hasn’t heavily impacted the Bucks this season, so his status won’t drastically alter the rotation.Here’s how Milwaukee is expected to line up for Game 3:The Pacers have outplayed Milwaukee so far, capitalizing on the Bucks’ mistakes and lack of urgency. Tyrese Haliburton has been a key factor, and Indiana’s aggressive play has exposed Milwaukee’s weaknesses.- Damian Lillard’s struggles – In Game 2, Lillard managed only 14 points, 7 assists, and 3 rebounds. The Bucks need him to regain his rhythm.- Defensive lapses – The Pacers have controlled the tempo, and Milwaukee must tighten up defensively.- Over-reliance on Giannis – While Antetokounmpo is a force, the supporting cast must step up.Bucks head coach Doc Rivers isn’t panicking yet. He believes the series is far from over and expects a stronger performance at home.""I look at it as a long series (and) we haven’t played a home game,"" Rivers said. ""We have to go home and take care of business, then we can talk. I’m very confident about this series. Very.""- Increase defensive intensity – The Pacers have been too comfortable offensively.- Better ball movement – Milwaukee’s offense has been stagnant at times.- Bench production – Role players like Bobby Portis and Gary Trent Jr. must contribute more.Also read: Indiana Pacers announce important update about Tyrese Haliburtons injury status for tonight's Game 3 against the Milwaukee Bucks (April 25, 2025) With Giannis playing, the Bucks have a chance to shift momentum. However, if they fail to address their issues, this series could slip away quickly.

FOR CHACHU WITH LOVE

Sunrisers Hyderabad batter Aniket Verma (R) with his uncle Amit Verma (L).

A NATURAL

Aniket Verma 's childhood hero is Hardik Pandya Aniket was not only captivated by Hardik Pandya's strokeplay but also intrigued by his backstory. His uncle, Amit Verma, narrated the story of how Hardik and his brother Krunal survived on Maggi for three years due to financial constraints. ""Aniket must have been 14 back then. I read it in a newspaper and told him the story while we were on our way to his academy,"" Amit told TimesofIndia.com.The distance between Verma's rented accommodation and the Ankur Cricket Academy, where Aniket trained, was 13 kilometers. Amit recalls that his nephew kept asking him about Hardik Pandya's journey, his struggles, and rise. ""That day, I saw the spirit, the passion, and the hunger in him. He wanted to make it big. Once we reached the stadium, he touched my feet and said, 'I complain about trivial things.' I laughed, but he was serious,"" he says.Fast forward to the present, and Aniket is making waves in the IPL with his six-hitting abilities. In just 56 balls, he has already hit 12 sixes. On Sunday, against Delhi Capitals, with his team at 25 for 3, he smashed a 41-ball 74, studded with five fours and six sixes. Against Lucknow Super Giants, he clobbered a 13-ball 36 with five maximums. The sample size is small, but against spin, he is as effective as his Sunrisers teammate Heinrich Klaasen. He picks up lengths early and muscles the ball over the boundary rope.Aniket lost his mother when he was three. A year later, his father remarried. This forced his grandmother, Parvati Verma, to move to Bhopal alongside Amit.""We moved to Bhopal. I had just finished school. My late father was in the Railways, so my mother received his pension. She took care of me and Anni (Aniket's nickname). Since I called her 'Ma' or 'Mummy,' Aniket also picked it up and calls her the same. It was tough, but we managed,"" recounts Amit.When Aniket turned eight, Amit, a cricket enthusiast, took him to Nand Jeet Singh, a coach at Railways Youth Sports Club in Bhopal. Impressed by young Aniket's hand-eye coordination and aware of their financial situation, Nand Jeet waived his fees. Aniket trained there for two years before Nand Jeet sent him to Jyoti Prakash Tyagi. ""Unique kid. He called me before joining the squad. I gave him my blessings. The family stayed in one of my flats for years. I have seen him grow in stature,"" says Singh.Before the IPL started, when TimesofIndia.com reached out to Aniket for an interview, his first response was, ""Brother, I haven't achieved anything yet.

His life has revolved around me.""Amit, who returned to Bhopal after traveling with Aniket for the first three matches, became emotional when he unwrapped the gift Aniket gave him. Aniket had asked him to open it once he reached home. It was a branded shoe with a message: ""To the world's best Chachu.""""My first job was at an automobile showroom. My salary was Rs 3,000. He was playing with torn shoes. I immediately took him to the shop and bought him sports shoes that cost Rs 1,200.

He slept with his new shoes that day,"" laughs Amit, who now works for a private company and earns Rs 20,000 per month.Aniket's coach, Jyoti Prakash Tyagi, says his ward was always a natural and played with aggressive intent, but he feels the 23-year-old is still raw and needs to work on certain areas.""There is no question about his work ethic. I have seen that those who don't think about Plan 'B' or 'C' are the ones who nail their Plan 'A' with precision. I never stopped him from playing aggressive cricket. Now, cricket has changed. His strength is to go aerial and take on the bowlers. Why curb that aggression? It's his strength,"" says Tyagi.""I still feel he needs to learn how to finish games. He must develop that temperament if he wants to play for his country. He will learn from experience, and in the next games, I would like him to take his team home. The intent should remain the same,"" he says.Aniket was scouted by Sunrisers Hyderabad during the 2024 Madhya Pradesh Premier League . Playing for Bhopal Leopards, he amassed 273 runs in six innings, hitting a staggering 25 sixes.""We were over the moon when he was hitting sixes for fun in the MPL. Never thought he would do the same in the IPL,"" said Amit with a laugh.","Aniket Verma is making waves in the IPL with his six-hitting abilities. In just 56 balls, he has already hit 12 sixes.

Sachin Tendulkar at 52: Power, Pride, and a Nation’s Pulse

NEW DELHI: The India vs Pakistan cricket debate has once again reignited following the recent Pahalgam terror attack . Amid rising tensions, Pakistan women's cricket team opener Gull Feroza has reinforced her team’s position regarding participation in matches scheduled in India.Feroza, who featured in three games during the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup Qualifier as an opener, confirmed that Pakistan will not travel to India for the main tournament. Pakistan secured qualification for the 2025 ICC Women’s World Cup , which is scheduled to be held in India this September.With Pakistan’s qualification now confirmed, so is the likelihood of a hybrid model for the tournament—similar to the one used in the Asia Cup—where their matches against India will be hosted at a neutral venue. The development has sparked controversy, especially with India set to host the global event.Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi had already stated that the team would not travel to India for the World Cup.Meanwhile, Feroza echoed that sentiment in a conversation with PakPassion.“We know this much that we will play in Asian conditions and we are not playing in India. This is clear. Neither are we interested in playing in India,” Feroza told PakPassion.Also See: IPL Live Score, KKR vs PBKS “So, wherever it is played - hopefully in Sri Lanka or Dubai - those conditions are similar to the ones you get in Asia. The Qualifiers were at home, and the staff prepared tracks accordingly. Wherever the World Cup games are played, the conditions will be similar to those we have at home. So, our preparation will be according to that, and we are ready for that,” she added.Earlier this year, the Indian men's team also declined to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy. As a result, their matches—including the final—were held in Dubai.",Pakistan secured qualification for the 2025 ICC Women’s World Cup. The tournament is scheduled to be held in India this September.

Luguentz Dort shares his side of the story after causing Ja Morant’s fall

Memphis Commercial Appeal

Oklahoma City Thunder guard Luguentz Dort faced backlash from Memphis Grizzlies fans after his foul caused the team's star, Ja Morant, to suffer a hard fall and exit the game before he could lead a potential comeback. Dort has addressed the incident, calling Morant’s fall “unintentional” and expressing concern after learning Morant had sustained a hip contusion.After the Oklahoma City Thunder erased all the progress Memphis had made in the first half and defeated them 114-108, Dort gave a clarification, saying he didn’t intend to hurt Morant and that it all happened in the heat of the moment. He said, as reported by the, “Tough one. Obviously, I hope he’s OK. I was running back, making a hustle play for my team. I was running quick, stopped on a dime. I didn’t know he was behind me, and I was slipping. I tried to make a play on the ball, but we just ran into each other, and he fell down. But I hope he’s OK. I didn’t mean to hit him like that.”Dort even approached Morant to express regret for unintentionally hurting him. He said, “When he was at the line, I dapped him up and I apologized obviously. It's never good when a good player like that goes down. But people can say whatever they want. He dapped me up. That was it. That was enough. At least he knows that I didn't mean to take him down like that.""The Grizzlies might have won the game against the Oklahoma City Thunder had Ja Morant not suffered the hip injury. Morant still got up and limped to the line to take his free throws, which he missed. He received a standing ovation from the fans for his courage. He left the court soon after, and it's still unclear if he will return for Saturday’s game.Also Read: Ja Morant limps off court after scary fall during Oklahoma City Thunder vs Memphis Grizzlies This marks Morant’s second injury in just a few days.

NFL Draft 2025: A ratings smash that captures Football’s offseason magic



The NFL Draft has long been a spectacle that blends uncertainty with unfiltered hope, and the 2025 edition proved once again why it holds a unique place in sports culture. Averaging 13.6 million viewers across ESPN, NFL Network, ABC, ESPN Deportes, and various digital platforms, the first night of this year’s draft became the second-most watched opening round in NFL Draft history, according to data released by the league and Nielsen. It marked a solid 11% increase from 2024’s numbers and reaffirmed its role as the crown jewel of the offseason.While these figures still trail behind typical prime-time NFL games, the context is key—this isn’t a game. No touchdowns, no crunching tackles, and no game-winning drives. Just team executives, analysts, and young athletes in suits waiting for their names to be called. And yet, fans flock to it. Why? Because it’s more than a show—it’s a ritual, a nationwide celebration of what could be.The paradox of the NFL Draft lies in its format. As one might put it, “Nothing draws a crowd like the ultimate reality show about nothing.” On the surface, it’s just people talking in an auditorium. But for diehard fans, it’s so much more—weeks of research, mock drafts, combine performances, and trade rumors culminate in a single night of anticipation.Matt Shapiro, the NFL’s Vice President of Event Strategy, summed it up best: “All teams at this moment have hope. No matter how last season went, everyone is making a fresh start. And every team makes picks that the fanbase can get excited about.” That’s the heartbeat of the event—it’s not about the past, but the possibility of a better future. Whether your team went 3-14 or made a playoff run, draft night levels the playing field.Adding to the atmosphere, 205,000 fans gathered in Green Bay to witness the first round in person—further proof that the draft has evolved into a full-blown fan experience. It's not just a night of announcements, but a celebration of football’s future stars.And while the all-time record of 15.5 million viewers in 2020 remains untouched, the 2025 NFL Draft proved that excitement for the game begins long before kickoff. The event has transformed into a staple of the sports calendar—a mix of drama, dreams, and the thrill of the unknown. The first round of the NFL Draft in 2024 averaged 12.1 million viewers.The real games may be months away, but for one night in April, football fans got to believe again. That’s the magic of the draft—where every team has a chance, and every pick could be the start of something unforgettable.Also Read: The secret behind America’s obsession with the NFL Draft, even when no games are played","The 2025 NFL Draft attracted 13.6 million viewers across ESPN, NFL Network, ABC, ESPN Deportes, and various digital platforms.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

The Mumbai Indians , currently in good form, will aim to extend their winning streak in a crucial mid-table clash against Lucknow Super Giants in the Indian Premier League today (April 27).Both teams, sitting fourth and sixth respectively, have accumulated 10 points each, with their standings separated only by net run rate. They each have five wins and four losses from nine matches.For the Super Giants, improving their negative net run rate of -0.054 is a priority, especially with hopes that skipper Rishabh Pant can deliver a significant performance. Pant has scored just 106 runs in nine matches this season while struggling to find a stable batting position.Carrying the weight of his high price tag and the pressure of leading a new IPL team, Pant has seen his teammates perform admirably so far. However, they will face a tough challenge against the Mumbai Indians, who are on a roll with four consecutive wins, propelling them into the upper half of the points table.Mumbai are peaking at just the right moment, with key players like Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Trent Boult, and Hardik Pandya in excellent form. Rohit has rediscovered his rhythm, scoring two explosive half-centuries against Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad, adjusting his aggressive batting style to achieve consistent performances.While Suryakumar Yadav started slowly this IPL, he has recently picked up pace alongside Tilak Varma. Pandya has also excelled, providing both reliable bowling and aggressive batting, solidifying his role for MI.For Lucknow, their overseas stars—Nicholas Pooran (377 runs), Mitchell Marsh (344 runs), and Aiden Markram (326 runs)—have been the backbone of their success. Marsh has excelled as a specialist batter, while Pooran has captivated fans with his dynamic Caribbean flair. Markram has consistently performed his role effectively.Mumbai Indians have played four matches at the Wankhede Stadium this IPL season. It has produced a high of 221/5, by Royal Challengers Bengaluru, and a low of 116 runs, by Kolkata Knight Riders.Mumbai Indians Predicted Playing 11: Ryan Rickelton (wk), Will Jacks, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya (c), Naman Dhir, Mitchell Santner, Deepak Chahar, Trent Boult, Jasprit Bumrah, Vignesh Puthur, Rohit SharmaLucknow Super Giants Predicted Playing 11: Aiden Markram, Mitchell Marsh, Nicholas Pooran, Rishabh Pant (c, wk), David Miller, Abdul Samad, Shardul Thakur, Prince Yadav, Digvesh Singh, Ravi Bishnoi, Avesh Khan, Ayush BadoniHardik Pandya (c), Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Robin Minz (wk), Ryan Rickelton (wk), Shrijith Krishnan (wk), Bevon Jacobs, Tilak Varma, Naman Dhir, Will Jacks, Mitchell Santner, Raj Angad Bawa, Vignesh Puthur, Corbin Bosch, Trent Boult, Karn Sharma, Deepak Chahar, Ashwani Kumar, Reece Topley, VS Penmetsa, Arjun Tendulkar, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Jasprit Bumrah.Rishabh Pant (c&wk), David Miller, Aiden Markram, Aryan Juyal, Himmat Singh, Matthew Breetzke, Nicholas Pooran (wk), Mitchell Marsh, Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmad, Yuvraj Chaudhary, Rajvardhan Hangargekar, Arshin Kulkarni, Ayush Badoni, Shardul Thakur, Avesh Khan, Akash Deep, Manimaran Siddharth, Digvesh Singh, Akash Singh, Shamar Joseph, Prince Yadav, Mayank Yadav, Ravi Bishnoi.For MI and LSG, as they compete for supremacy at Wankhede Stadium, the scorching heat and humidity in Mumbai will be a challenge.

When George Russell was Lewis Hamilton's teammate at Mercedes

George Russell and Lewis Hamilton were teammates at Mercedes until last year. But the times have changed drastically, as Hamilton has now switched to Ferrari , where he is yet to find his footing. Meanwhile, Russell is having a fantastic season and is just one position away from clinching his first win of the season, if McLaren misses the mark by chance. The roaring Mercedes driver has now said that if it was a different era, he would have already won two championships.George Russell was reflecting on his past years at Mercedes when Lewis Hamilton was leading the World Championship. He stresses that it’s not him who has changed, but the times. Russell was two positions ahead of Hamilton in the Driver Standings when he joined Mercedes in 2022, and once again left him behind in 2024 when Hamilton started losing his winning streak.Talking about his time with Hamilton, Russell told The Athletic, “Everybody is in Lewis’s shadow. Being teammates with a seven-time World Champion for three years is not straightforward. There was once a time that if you finished ahead of Lewis Hamilton in a championship or in a race, you’d win the race. Or, if you finished ahead of him in the championship, you’d win the championship. If my time was five years prior, you could argue I’d have two championships to my name.”At present, Russell is in 4th place, while Hamilton, who now drives for Ferrari, is way behind in 7th in the Driver Standings. Opening up about the same, Russell said, “I’m just going about my business, as I have been the last couple of years. I’m working with the same group of engineers, the same group of mechanics. Obviously, Lewis was such a large presence that you know that he’s not around.”“But on the day-to-day running of things, it is no different. I'm sat at my desk in front of my computer. I do my warm-up in my room, I jump in my race car, I put my helmet on. I want to control my own destiny first and foremost,"" he added.Also Read: George Russell: George Russell seen in super-rare $5.4 million Mercedes AMG One with Alex Albon in Monaco Russell has claimed three podiums in five races and is currently the only one, other than Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, giving McLaren a tough competition. It may simply be a matter of time before he manages to surpass Oscar Piastri, Lando Norris, and Verstappen to clinch a win.","George Russell and Lewis Hamilton were teammates at Mercedes until last year.

Seville: Barcelona defender Jules Kounde struck deep in extra-time to decide a gripping Copa del Rey Clasico final on Saturday in Seville, earning his side a 3-2 win over rivals Real Madrid .The Catalans, aiming for a quadruple this season, won the first major trophy of Hansi Flick's reign as coach and a record-extending 32nd Spanish cup in dramatic fashion.Three Real Madrid players were sent off during and after a fiery conclusion to the game, including England international Jude Bellingham.Pedri sent Barcelona ahead at La Cartuja but two Real Madrid goals in seven second-half minutes, from Kylian Mbappe and Aurelien Tchouameni, pulled the Spanish and European champions level.However, Ferran Torres struck in the 84th minute to take the game to extra-time and Kounde drilled home to win it for the La Liga leaders.""Madrid pushed us to our limits but we showed great character and pride,"" said Kounde.Barca host Inter Milan in the Champions League semi-finals on Wednesday.""They can make a party -- for today, it's OK,"" a delighted Flick, who has won all seven finals he has coached in his career, told Movistar.Substituted Madrid defender Antonio Rudiger was sent off in the final seconds for ""throwing an object"" onto the pitch towards referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea, according to the official's report, and Lucas Vazquez, also replaced, was dismissed for further protest as Madrid unravelled.Bellingham was sent off after the final whistle for showing an ""aggressive attitude"" towards the referee, who wrote that the midfielder ""had to be restrained by his team-mates"".""I don't want to talk about the referee,"" said stone-faced Madrid coach Ancelotti.""I don't know what happened at the end."" Madrid had issued furious statements about the refereeing team on Friday after they criticised the club's television channel for attacking Spanish officials this season, casting a shadow over the game.Controversy aside, the football was enthralling.Madrid started with top scorer Mbappe on the bench after an ankle injury and lost Ferland Mendy early on with a thigh issue.Barcelona dazzling winger Lamine Yamal, 17, dyed his hair blond for the game and led the assault on Thibaut Courtois' goal.The Catalans, who also won the first two Clasicos this season in La Liga and the Spanish Super Cup, scoring nine goals in the process, controlled the ball.They took the lead after 28 minutes, Pedri placing the ball into the top corner with precision and power from the edge of the box, a sensational goal set up by Yamal.Barcelona's opener brought Madrid out of their shell -- and also Mbappe off the bench to warm up.Bellingham netted but was offside. Vinicius Junior would have won a penalty when hacked down but had also strayed off in the build-up.Barcelona could have doubled their lead, with Dani Olmo's corner hitting the post and Cubarsi unable to turn home as Dani Ceballos held him back.The referee was lenient with some heated Madrid tackles, perhaps cowed by Friday's drama as the Spanish champions seethed at his pre-match comments.Madrid sent Mbappe on for Rodrygo Goes at half-time and soon he and Vinicius began to work Barcelona goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny.Mbappe pulled Madrid level almost on his own in the 70th minute, brought down after surging forward and firing home the free-kick off the post.Seven minutes later Madrid took the lead, Tchouameni heading in Arda Guler's corner.Barcelona responded when Yamal played a delicious pass over the top for Torres, which drew both Rudiger and Courtois, but the Spaniard beat both and rolled home.Controversy unsurprisingly reared its head before the match headed to extra-time.Barcelona clamoured for a penalty when Rudiger tripped Torres, and then were awarded one deep in stoppage time as Raphinha tumbled under pressure -- but the decision was overturned after a VAR review.In extra-time Barcelona were ascendent.They found their winner when Kounde intercepted an uncharacteristically loose Luka Modric pass and beat Courtois from range, sparking wild celebrations.The trio of dismissals and Madrid's pre-match histrionics regarding the officials will ensure the repercussions run on.The teams meet again in La Liga in May in a potential title decider.",Barcelona beat Real Madrid 3-2 in the Copa del Rey final in Seville. Jules Kounde scores the winner in extra-time for the Catalans. Real Madrid have three players sent off during and after the game.

NEW DELHI: The IPL 2025 clash between Punjab Kings (PBKS) and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) was marred by rain, marking the first no-result game of the season.The match had a promising start with PBKS posting a solid total, but the weather decided to play spoilsport, with rain halting play early in KKR's chase, leaving the game abandoned.Punjab Kings set a strong total of 201/4, thanks to splendid half-centuries from Prabhsimran Singh and Priyansh Arya .Arya, who had already impressed this season, continued his dream debut campaign by scoring a rapid 69 off 35 balls.He was well supported by Prabhsimran, who made an explosive 83 off 49 deliveries.The pair put on a blistering 120-run partnership, but the momentum slowed in the final overs as KKR's bowlers, led by Vaibhav Arora (2/34) and Andre Russell (1/27), pulled things back.Despite a strong start, KKR's bowlers, including Sunil Narine and Varun Chakravarthy, couldn’t keep up with the scorching pace set by the PBKS openers.However, they made some key breakthroughs in the death overs, preventing Punjab from reaching a daunting total.As KKR began their chase, the weather turned, and heavy rain forced the players off the field.The rain delay left fans hoping for a brief break, but the downpour persisted, and it soon became clear that the match wouldn’t continue. The match was officially called off, with the points being shared between the two teams.This no-result could prove valuable for PBKS, who will see the point as an important addition to their playoff bid.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

NEW DELHI: If we compare the spin attacks of Delhi Capitals (DC) and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), DC would certainly have the upper hand, thanks to their spin arsenal, which includes Kuldeep Yadav, captain Axar Patel, and the young Vipraj Nigam.On the other hand, RCB have leg-spinner Suyash Sharma and left-arm spinner Krunal Pandya Delhi Capitals will enter the highly anticipated clash against RCB on Sunday at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi with a power-packed spin attack. However, considering the impact of Krunal and Suyash — the way they have turned things around for RCB this season with their lines, lengths, and mind games — RCB will surely pose a serious challenge.Sitting in third place on the points table with six wins and riding high after their first home victory, RCB’s season so far has been defined by solid contributions from Krunal and Suyash.Krunal didn’t have the best season with Lucknow Super Giants last year, claiming just six wickets in 14 matches. After playing three seasons for LSG, he was acquired by RCB for Rs 5.75 crore in the IPL 2025 mega auction.Since then, his fortunes have turned around dramatically, with Krunal emerging as a key player in RCB’s impressive campaign so far.Not only has Krunal picked up 12 wickets in nine matches, but he has also become a crucial asset for his captain, trusted to bowl in tight situations. He has been effective in the death overs, keeping batters under control, and contributing significantly to RCB's success.At 34, Krunal continues to evolve his game.RCB’s spin bowling coach Malolan Rangarajan spoke about the combination of the young Suyash and all-rounder Krunal as frontline spinners. He spoke about Suyash’s ability to beat the bat and turn the ball, along with the evolution of Krunal’s action over the years.""As far as Krunal Pandya is concerned, he is somebody who, if you saw his videos from 2016 or 2017-18, it was a completely different action. He has worked on his action. His release is very different to what it was, maybe even two years back,"" Malolan told reporters ahead of the DC vs RCB clash.""There are so many things they are doing. And that is the variation we have within the attack. Suyash Sharma is not a household name yet, but he will become one. That is the belief we have as a management. And Krunal Pandya, we all know what he's done. He's won the IPL a handful of times, and he is here only for one job. And I am not going to say what it is. We will see at the end of the season,"" he said.Delhi boy Suyash Sharma began his IPL career with KKR in 2023 and had an impressive debut season, picking up 10 wickets in 11 matches.However, he had a forgettable 2024 season with KKR, featuring in just two games without taking a wicket. Subsequently, he was released by the three-time champions and was picked up by RCB for Rs 2.60 crore ahead of IPL 2025.Rangarajan highlighted Suyash’s speed and his ability to beat the bat on both edges as key strengths, which have significantly benefitted the team this season.""He showed that with the dismissal of Josh Inglis, which was outside of the bat. The dismissal of Russell was through the batter. So, he does turn the ball. His super-strength is the ability to turn the ball, beat the bat on both edges, and bowl at a very high speed, so to speak. Plus, his action is peculiar in its way. So, that makes it slightly tough for the batter to read,"" said the coach.","Delhi Capitals take on Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) on Sunday. RCB have leg-spinner Suyash Sharma and left-arm spinner Krunal Pandya.

NEW DELHI: Defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders and Punjab Kings were forced to share a point each after rain washed out their Indian Premier League 2025 clash at Eden Gardens on Saturday — the season's first match to end without a result.Chasing 202 for victory, KKR were seven for no loss after one over when rain interrupted play.

NEW DELHI: Just a season after leading Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) to IPL glory, Shreyas Iyer returns to Eden Gardens in opposition colours, now captaining a rejuvenated Punjab Kings (PBKS).Let go by KKR in a shock off-season move, Iyer has found form and leadership comfort under mentor Ricky Ponting, guiding PBKS to the top five with five wins from eight. With 263 runs and three fifties, Iyer now has a chance to deliver a KL Rahul-style statement knock against his former team.KKR, however, are floundering with five losses in eight. Their top-order is shaky, the middle-order misfiring, and spin options underwhelming on home turf.Calls for change may see Rovman Powell come in, while Angkrish Raghuvanshi remains a lone batting bright spot. Ajinkya Rahane’s conservative approach and Sunil Narine’s lack of impact have also added pressure.PBKS, on the other hand, look confident with Marco Jansen’s early bursts, Nehal Wadhera’s finishing skills, and Arshdeep Singh’s 11 wickets leading the attack. Yuzvendra Chahal, who wrecked KKR in their 95 all-out collapse last week, looms large again.KKR must win five of their remaining six to stay in playoff contention, but with just one home win this season and internal issues, including pitch controversies, they face a tough task.Saturday’s clash is more than just a game: it’s personal, tactical, and possibly season-defining.Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh , Andre Russell, Moeen Ali, Ramandeep Singh , Harshit Rana, Vaibhav Arora, Varun Chakaravarthy, Angkrish RaghuvanshiPrabhsimran Singh, Priyansh Arya, Shreyas Iyer (c), Josh Inglis(wk), Nehal Wadhera, Shashank Singh, Marcus Stoinis, Marco Jansen, Xavier Bartlett, Arshdeep Singh, Yuzvendra Chahal, Harpreet BrarBrace for a hot Saturday in Kolkata.
