Lack of real match practice for India’s star batters Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma , and Shreyas Iyer could hurt India’s ODI plans leading up to the 2027 World Cup. The recent Perth ODI against Australia was a small warning sign.Kohli, Rohit, and Iyer form India’s top four, but all three are currently playing only one format. Rohit and Virat have retired from T20Is and Tests, while Shreyas Iyer, who has taken a six-month break from red-ball cricket, is not part of India’s T20I setup for the upcoming World Cup in February next year.The Indian cricket team was slated to play 27 ODIs according to the ICC’s Future Tours Program (FTP) 2023–27. The three-match ODI series against Bangladesh, which was scheduled for August, has been postponed, and the first ODI at Perth was not a promising start for India’s quest for the 2027 ODI World Cup. Rohit, Virat, and Shreyas lasted just 46 balls between them, managing only 19 runs.Rohit and Virat were playing a competitive match after a gap of five months and looked rusty. Meanwhile, Shreyas, who has played for India A and in the Duleep Trophy, had his technical flaws exposed again. Both Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc, who stand six feet six inches tall, have a high release point of almost 2.15 metres (nearly 7.05 feet).Whatever length they bowled, the duo generated extra bounce, with almost every ball hitting the top half of the bat. Perth was a bouncy track, and India’s top order looked all at sea.The ball that dismissed Rohit Sharma wasn’t particularly short, but it rose sharply to armpit height outside the off-stump, striking the upper portion of Rohit’s bat. He could have left it alone, but ended up poking at it. The unexpected bounce surprised him; yet it wasn’t due to the pitch — it was Hazlewood’s skill that gave it its sting.Virat Kohli, who registered his first duck on Australian soil, was also troubled by that length. Starc and Hazlewood had troubled Kohli in the past too. In 10 ODI innings, Hazlewood had dismissed Kohli five times — averaging a wicket every second innings. But it was Hazlewood’s new-ball partner, Starc, who sent Kohli back. Kohli went for a booming shot, chasing the ball away from his body, and Cooper Connolly, patrolling at backward point, took a spectacular catch. It was a shot born out of desperation to get off the mark, which we have rarely seen from Kohli in a format where he is an undisputed king.Meanwhile, Shreyas Iyer’s struggles against short-pitched balls are well documented. The newly appointed ODI vice-captain had been prolific in the last two 50-over ICC tournaments. In the Champions Trophy earlier this year, he was India’s leading run-getter with 243 runs in five innings. Iyer had hammered 530 runs during the 2023 ODI World Cup.He had been pivotal in India’s success in both tournaments, but in Perth, Hazlewood exposed a chink in Shreyas’ armour again. Relentless Hazlewood denied Shreyas any width, hitting the deck hard and creating an angle from a good length, which tangled Shreyas up. As he tried to adjust and negate the extra bounce, rising around his ribs, the ball ended up brushing his gloves.The three dismissals have raised eyebrows as the next World Cup will be held in South Africa, where pitches will be bouncy. India will play only two away ODI series to tackle the bounce factor: the ongoing three-match series against world champions Australia, and another against England in July 2026. However, the spice in English pitches has lessened, as it doesn’t suit their “Bazball” approach.In the case of Shreyas, he is playing for India A and, after taking a break from four-day cricket, will likely be available for Mumbai in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. But the big question is whether the two senior stars, Kohli and Rohit, will play domestic 50-over tournaments to stay match-ready. It doesn’t matter how hard they train in the nets; having played enough cricket, they know there is no substitute for real match scenarios.Since Rohit and Virat now play only one format, their rustiness was visible in the first outing. Playing just the IPL won’t guarantee them a spot in India’s 2027 ODI World Cup squad. If they want to pursue their broken November 19 dream and win the trophy in South Africa, they must play domestic cricket to stay match-fit. If they choose not to, they are doing a disservice to Indian cricket and their own reputations.After India’s Test series win against West Indies in New Delhi, coach Gautam Gambhir was asked , “Are Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli still part of India’s plans for the 2027 World Cup?”Gambhir said: “Look, the 50-over World Cup is still two-and-a-half years away, and it is very important to stay in the present. Obviously, they are quality players; their experience will be invaluable in Australia as well. Hopefully, those two will have a successful tour, and more importantly, the team will have a successful series.”Gambhir may have dodged the big question, but he knows the clock is ticking. If he and Shubman Gill want India to take a step forward in 2027, they will need their ageing superstars match-ready. If not, India must blood talents like Yashasvi Jaiswal and Tilak Verma, giving them limited matches to prepare for the 2027 ODI World Cup.","Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Shreyas Iyer produced paltry returns in the first ODI vs Australia in Perth.

Ayesha Curry’s shocking reflections seemingly hint at alleged problems in her decade-long marriage with Stephen

On July 30, 2011, NBA icon Stephen Curry married Ayesha Curry . They eventually had two sons, Canon and Caius, and two daughters, Riley and Ryan. They are among the cutest couples in the NBA. However, a recent rumor suggests that Stephen Curry and Ayesha Curry are no longer together. The rumor began because Mrs. Curry spoke about how she thought about marriage and children during an appearance on thepodcast. She further stated that she did not intend to get married and have children either. Shortly after this, the divorce rumors started to circulate.Neither of their social media accounts offers any indication that they are no longer together. Common indicators that a couple is going through a breakup include them deleting images and unfollowing one other, but nothing like that happened.Since Steph continues to follow Ayesha and vice versa, they are seemingly still together. Both of them still have pictures of each other and their kids on their respective Instagram accounts.The couple recently made the news because of the remarks the actress made about their marriage. However, the internet is incorrect about their breakup. It started after Mrs. Curry's podcast comment, where she said:“So I didn’t want kids. I didn’t want to get married… I thought I was going to be a ‘career girl’ and that’s it.""She went on:“After we got married, we found out we were pregnant with our daughters so quickly, I didn't even have time to think about what I wanted anymore. It's so interesting. I spent my entire life trying to work towards something, and then it kind of just disappeared and I didn't think twice about it.”Although Ayesha 's remarks drew a lot of criticism, her husband and a handful of celebrities supported her and stood by her side. Many even remarked that the NBA icon is reportedly ""unlucky."" However, he never addressed those comments. In fact, since then, he has showed his support for his loving wife.Since she made some seemingly controversial remarks about an alternative life she had imagined for herself, Ayesha Curry's ten-year marriage to Stephen Curry has drawn a lot of attention in recent days.On July 30, 2011, Steph Curry married Ayesha. The two originally met in 2003 at a church in Charlotte, North Carolina, according to People magazine. The publication further claimed that despite Ayesha's brief flirtations with the NBA player, the two stayed close friends until 2008.Meanwhile, the latest divorce rumors don't seem to have affected the couple. Steph even wrote a tribute to his wife on Instagram and said:""Life has been challenging lately, but it serves as a constant reminder that I have my rock and my backbone by my side.""He included a cute picture of himself with Ayesha in the post's text, which read, ""Love you, my woman.""On the other hand, Ayesha shared a family photo of Steph and their four children, Riley, Ryan, Canon, and baby Cai, on social media. ""Life lately,"" she captioned the photo. It seems that the couple is still living together and is not on the verge of getting a divorce.Also read: Stephen Curry's wife Ayesha Curry shows her love for food while stirring 8-year-old pan in social media post",A recent rumor suggests that Stephen Curry and Ayesha Curry are no longer together.

"Auston Matthews addresses Anthony Stolarz controversy head-on, reveals what’s really going on inside Maple Leafs camp",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/auston-matthews-addresses-anthony-stolarz-controversy-head-on-reveals-whats-really-going-on-inside-maple-leafs-camp/articleshow/124711726.cms,"Auston Matthews finally breaks silence after Anthony Stolarz’s shocking outburst (Getty Images)

Auston Matthews delivers a steadying message to his teammates





Could Stolarz’s criticism be the wake-up call Toronto needed?

The calm never lasts long in Toronto. When it comes to the Maple Leafs, peace feels more like the pause before the next storm. Just a handful of games into the 2025–26 NHL season, the city already has its newest headline—this time starring goaltender Anthony Stolarz’s unfiltered frustration and Auston Matthews’ cool-headed response. What began as a simple postgame remark has now rippled through the locker room, testing the Leafs’ chemistry and resolve early in the campaign.The Maple Leafs’ locker room has been buzzing since Anthony Stolarz openly criticized the team’s effort after a 4–3 overtime loss to the Seattle Kraken. His words didn’t mince emotions: “I thought the first two periods we kind of let them walk all over us. They just outworked us, plain and simple.” The frustration was clear, and his message was sharper.But in a market as intense as Toronto, even a spark can start a wildfire. Matthews, aware of the brewing tension, chose maturity over mayhem. “We’re a veteran group. We’re all big boys,” he told TSN. “You don’t need to beat around the bush. It’s an easy conversation we all had and you just move on, close the door. We’ve got to be better and we will be.”His words carried both accountability and calm. Matthews didn’t dismiss Stolarz’s remarks—he acknowledged them while emphasizing collective growth.It’s a captain’s response in every sense: owning the moment without letting emotions take over.Anthony Stolarz’s frustration may have stung, but it echoed a truth the team couldn’t ignore. His comparison to Seattle’s Joey Daccord—saying for Daccord “it’s like playing catch in the yard”—was a pointed reminder that Toronto hasn’t been making life hard for opposing goalies. It wasn’t just about one bad night; it was about patterns that need fixing.Head coach Craig Berube didn’t shy away either, acknowledging that “it’s frustration, we all prefer it stay in the room, but it happens. We’ve moved on from it.” Teammate William Nylander also backed the idea that the group must respond, not react. “It’s all good… we know we can play better,” he said.Despite the brief tension, this might be exactly what the Leafs needed—a jolt of honesty to reignite their drive. With goaltender Joseph Woll sidelined indefinitely, Stolarz’s importance has only grown. If his words can light a fire under the team without burning bridges, Toronto might come out stronger.For now, Auston Matthews’ message is clear: it’s time to regroup, refocus, and prove that the Maple Leafs can handle pressure—on and off the ice.Also Read: Connor McDavid and David Tomasek labeled among NHL’s unluckiest players as frustration builds in Edmonton","Anthony Stolarz openly criticized the team’s effort after a 4–3 overtime loss to the Seattle Kraken.

It's our cancer.""According to Union, she was scared, hopeless, and even worried that she would have to raise the kids in Dwyane Wade’s absence. The Bring It On star was overwhelmed with emotions, poured her heart out during the interview. According to Gabrielle Union, her husband was just acting selfish after his cancer diagnosis as she failed to understand the former NBA star's point of view. She said,""I'll speak for myself when I say that the decisions that he was making hurt me about his cancer. It felt like, 'Oh, you're trying to kill me. And I'm going to be alone raising these kids. It's a very selfish response that I had, and it caused all kinds of problems, but [so did] his need for secrecy about his cancer decisions. It just starts sowing the seeds of distrust.""After coming across the life-threatening tumor in Wade’s kidney, Gabrielle Union felt as if the NBA icon was almost near to death.

When you mention year nine being hard, he hadn’t revealed his cancer diagnosis and his own cancer journey, so now we can put it in more context.”She further elaborated,""Obviously him getting that diagnosis was traumatic for him: Being faced with your own mortality in your early 40s, and you’re like, ‘Am I going to be here to see my family? Who am I without this big life, and without this healthy body? But you also don’t understand the journey and the toll that it takes on your marriage, on your family, on your kids.”After being married for 11 long years, Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union share a daughter named Kaavia via surrogacy.

How Giannis Impacts the Milwaukee Bucks Squad

When and Where to Watch the Bucks vs Wizards Game Tonight (October 22, 2025)

in their season opener against the Washington Wizards tonight, despite dealing with lower back soreness. The Bucks’ injury report from October 22, 2025, listed their superstar forward as probable, indicating he is likely to be available when the team tips off its 2025-26 campaign at Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee. This update comes as a relief for fans, especially after a preseason marked by setbacks and missed time due to illness.The Milwaukee Bucks added Giannis Antetokounmpo to the injury report earlier this week because of minor lower back soreness, but his probable status means he is anticipated to play through the discomfort. Although the Greek Freak faced interruptions during the preseason - including a brief absence after testing positive for COVID-19 and an illness that limited his offseason work - he returned in time for the team’s final exhibition games. His performance during those matchups suggested he was regaining form, and his participation tonight would signal that he’s ready to lead Milwaukee from the start of the regular season.At present, the Milwaukee Bucks report no other major injury concerns for their core players heading into the opener. That stability gives head coach Doc Rivers and his revamped roster an opportunity to begin the season on a strong note in front of their home crowd. Giannis Antetokounmpo remains the heartbeat of the Bucks’ system - a two-time MVP and one of the league’s most dominant forces. Following an early playoff exit last season, Milwaukee made several roster adjustments in an effort to strengthen its depth and versatility. Giannis, Bobby Portis, and Thanasis Antetokounmpo are the lone remnants of the franchise’s 2021 championship team, underscoring how much the lineup has evolved over the years.New addition Myles Turner is expected to play a key role alongside Giannis in anchoring the frontcourt, while the team continues to refine its chemistry under Rivers’ leadership. Oddsmakers currently project Giannis Antetokounmpo to score over 30 points in tonight’s matchup - a testament to his offensive load and importance.The Milwaukee Bucks enter the game as favorites against the rebuilding Washington Wizards, who are still developing under head coach Brian Keefe. The Wizards struggled last season and are focused on nurturing young talent, but they’ll aim to make a statement against one of the East’s powerhouses.Beyond the injury storyline, tonight’s matchup carries emotional weight for both teams. Former Bucks forward Khris Middleton will make his return to Milwaukee wearing a Wizards jersey for the first time since being traded. Middleton’s return adds sentimental depth to the opener, as fans will welcome back a key figure from their 2021 title run.From a tactical standpoint, Milwaukee’s primary focus will be on improving its defense and maintaining offensive fluidity. Doc Rivers has emphasized the need for better communication and faster rotations on the floor - areas that could determine whether the Milwaukee Bucks regain championship form. Giannis Antetokounmpo’s ability to play effectively despite the minor injury will serve as an early test of his durability and leadership as the season unfolds.The Milwaukee Bucks will host the Washington Wizards at 8 PM ET at Fiserv Forum. The game will air nationally on NBC and stream live via Peacock. Fans will have the chance to see if Giannis Antetokounmpo can kick off his season with another dominant showing and help the Bucks establish early momentum in the Eastern Conference race.Also read: Is Jayson Tatum playing tonight vs Philadelphia 76ers?

The family’s role in shaping Auston Matthews’ rise

Auston Matthews, the captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs, is one of the most dominant forces in the NHL today. Known for his incredible scoring touch and calm leadership, his rise to hockey stardom didn’t happen overnight. Behind his success stands a strong and supportive family, especially his parents, Brian and Ema Matthews, whose influence shaped his journey to becoming one of the NHL’s biggest stars.Auston’s mother, Ema Matthews, was born and raised in Mexico and later moved to California. She dreamed of becoming a pilot, but due to high training costs and gender limitations at the time, she pursued a career as a flight attendant instead. While working for Aero California, she often flew routes to Los Angeles — a decision that would change her life forever. In addition to her aviation career, Ema also worked for Starbucks, balancing her job with her ambitions and showing her strong work ethic from an early age. Ema’s inspiring journey from Mexico to the United States highlights the multicultural background behind NHL superstar Auston Matthews, one of the league’s most influential players today.On one of those flights, she met Brian Matthews, who was working part-time for an airline while playing baseball at Loyola Marymount University. Their connection was instant, and that spark eventually led to the foundation of a close-knit and loving family. Ema has always been a major emotional anchor in Auston’s life. Her cultural roots and nurturing personality gave Auston a deep sense of discipline and humility that reflects in how he carries himself on and off the ice.Auston’s father, Brian Matthews, is a former baseball pitcher from Loyola Marymount University. A dedicated athlete himself, Brian originally hoped Auston would follow in his footsteps and play baseball. However, when he noticed his son’s growing fascination with hockey, he gave his full support. Brian was instrumental in helping Auston train, practice, and stay focused through his early years in Scottsdale, Arizona. His understanding of athletic discipline and competitive mindset became key influences on Auston’s development.Brian Matthews’ guidance helped Auston Matthews become one of the top NHL stars, showcasing the impact of parental support in shaping elite athletes. Growing up in Scottsdale, Arizona, Auston Matthews trained at local hockey programs that are now recognized as top youth hockey development centers, cementing his path to NHL stardom.When Auston was just two months old, the Matthews family moved to Scottsdale, Arizona — a place not exactly known for hockey. Yet, his parents made every effort to nurture his interest. From taking him to early morning practices to supporting his time with the USA Hockey National Team Development Program and later in Switzerland with ZSC Lions, Brian and Ema stood by every decision.Their constant encouragement and belief shaped Auston into the player he is today — a record-breaking Maple Leafs captain, a multiple Rocket Richard Trophy winner, and one of the most admired figures in the NHL. Auston Matthews continues to lead the Toronto Maple Leafs with unmatched skill and leadership, drawing millions of fans and setting new benchmarks for American-born NHL players. In the 2023–24 season, he made history by scoring 69 goals, the most ever by an American-born player in a single NHL season.Behind Auston Matthews’ incredible achievements is a story of family, sacrifice, and unwavering support.

Brooklyn Nets’ Injury Report vs Charlotte Hornets (October 22, 2025)

What to Watch For in Tonight’s Charlotte Hornets vs Brooklyn Nets Game

and ready to take the court tonight as theopen their 2025–26 NBA campaign against the Brooklyn Nets at Spectrum Center in Charlotte. The 24-year-old star point guard, coming off an impressive preseason, headlines a Hornets roster eager to make a strong statement in front of their home crowd.According to the latest injury updates and team confirmations, LaMelo Ball is fully active for the season opener. The Charlotte Hornets will be without only two players - Josh Green, who continues his recovery from left shoulder surgery, and Grant Williams, sidelined after right knee surgery. With the majority of the roster healthy, Charlotte enters Opening Night nearly at full strength.Ball’s return is a major boost for the Hornets after an injury-hit 2024-25 season limited his appearances to 47 games. Despite the setback, he averaged an impressive 25.2 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game while knocking down 3.8 three-pointers on average. His ability to control tempo and create scoring opportunities makes him the focal point of the Hornets’ offense.Building on his chemistry with Brandon Miller and Miles Bridges, Ball will now have added firepower alongside newly acquired guard Collin Sexton, providing the team with more speed and scoring versatility.For the October 22 game, the Hornets’ official injury report lists:• Josh Green – Out (shoulder surgery)• Grant Williams – Out (ACL recovery)All other core players - including LaMelo Ball, Brandon Miller, Miles Bridges, Collin Sexton, and rookie standout Kon Knueppel - are cleared to play. LaMelo Ball (PG), Collin Sexton (SG), Brandon Miller (SF), Miles Bridges (PF), and Kon Knueppel (SF/SG hybrid).The Brooklyn Nets enter the contest nearly injury-free, with only Haywood Highsmith ruled out due to knee recovery. Their projected starting lineup features Cameron Thomas, Michael Porter Jr., Nic Claxton, Terance Mann, and Ziaire Williams - a young and athletic group ready to test Charlotte’s revamped defense.In recent history, Brooklyn has maintained the upper hand, winning seven of the last ten meetings against Charlotte. However, with a healthy LaMelo Ball leading the charge, the Hornets will look to shift the narrative, particularly in front of their home fans.Tonight’s clash promises fast-paced action, with plenty of highlight plays expected from Ball and Miller. The Charlotte Hornets are likely to emphasize transition offense and pick-and-roll sets, capitalizing on Ball’s elite court vision to generate open looks for Bridges and Knueppel. The absence of Green and Williams may hurt their perimeter defense, so disciplined rotations will be vital.For Brooklyn, the focus will be on maintaining spacing and exploiting Charlotte’s weakened wing defense. Expect Cameron Thomas and Michael Porter Jr. to be aggressive early, while Nic Claxton’s interior presence could test the Hornets’ frontcourt depth.The game tips off at 7 p.m. ET (4:30 a.m. IST), with live coverage available on NBC and Peacock.As the Charlotte Hornets embark on their new season, all eyes will be on LaMelo Ball - healthy, motivated, and determined to prove that when he’s on the floor, he remains one of the league’s most electrifying and impactful guards. Tonight’s opener marks the first step in what Charlotte hopes will be a breakout season.","The Charlotte Hornets open their 2025–26 NBA campaign against the Brooklyn Nets at Spectrum Center in Charlotte.

New ODI Captain Shubman Gill speaks out on Virat, Rohit and taking Indian cricket forward

India’s star openers had a forgettable start to the three-match ODI series against Australia in Perth on Sunday. Rohit Sharma managed just eight runs, while Virat Kohli was dismissed for a duck, as India lost the first match by seven wickets under the DLS method. The game also marked a new chapter in Indian cricket, with Shubman Gill taking over as the ODI captain, leading both veteran batters for the first time.Rohit’s low score sparked a flurry of speculation on social media, with some fans suggesting that the senior right-hander might have deliberately underperformed to challenge Gill’s authority as the new captain. These theories quickly went viral, drawing reactions from fans around the world.However, former India captain Sunil Gavaskar firmly dismissed such claims, stressing that no player would risk underperforming intentionally, as it could jeopardise their place in the team.“In Indian cricket, there’s a persistent myth that a player who loses the captaincy might underperform to undermine the new skipper,” Gavaskar wrote in his Sportstar column. “Nothing could be further from the truth. If a former captain doesn’t perform, he could be out of the team entirely. No player, regardless of personal feelings, would deliberately throw a game.”Gavaskar also highlighted that having experienced leaders like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli in the squad is a huge advantage for a young captain like Shubman Gill.The duo’s presence provides mentorship and guidance, which can help the new captain navigate his debut series.“Questions have been raised about whether Gill can handle two former captains in his team. But he has made it clear that his relationship with Rohit and Virat hasn’t changed with his new role,” Gavaskar added. “In fact, having them around is a bonus. Both are willing to offer advice when needed, and there’s no better support for a debutant captain than two of India’s greatest ODI players by his side.”","India's star openers had a forgettable start to the three-match ODI series against Australia in Perth on Sunday.

I was under for a two-hour nap - I was fired up about that.” He lastly added that the surgery went well, “They said it went awesome, very, very smooth.”Speaking to the media, Tkachuk also acknowledged how difficult it has been to watch from the sidelines, but emphasized his commitment to returning strong, “That’s not really in my thought process or mindset. My sole focus is getting back to help this team and get us in the best spot possible,” he added.Tkachuk has become a cornerstone for Ottawa after being drafted fourth overall in the 2018 NHL Draft. Now in his eighth NHL season, Tkachuk led the Senators with 29 goals last year, marking his fourth straight season with at least that total. His consistent scoring and leadership have made him one of the league’s most reliable power forwards.Tkachuk was also a standout performer for Team USA during last February’s Four Nations Face-Off, where he scored three goals in four games as the Americans fell to Canada in an overtime thriller in the championship game in Boston.","Brady Tkachuk underwent surgery to repair a torn ligament on his right thumb last week. The 26-year-old winger suffered the injury during the third game of the season on October 9, 2025, after getting cross-checked by Nashville Predators defenceman Roman Josi. The Ottawa Senators captain confirmed on Wednesday that his return to the team remains unclear.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124745828,imgsize-52588,width-400,resizemode-4/brady-tkachuk.jpg"

Super Bowl Showdown? Trump Adviser Targets Bad Bunny as ICE Presence Sparks Halftime Uproar

Trump, MAGA, and other critics slam the decision

Bad Bunny’s witty response to haters

NFL stands firm in their decision

The NFL just threw the ultimate curveball, and the internet is losing it. Bad Bunny is officially headlining the Super Bowl LX halftime show on February 8, 2026, and, as expected, some corners of the political world aren’t having it. President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson have publicly criticized the pick, calling it “crazy” and “terrible.” But NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell? He’s not budging and he’s not here for the drama.Roger Goodell is doubling down on the decision, calling Bad BunnyThe commissioner explained that the choice was “carefully thought through” to deliver a halftime show that’s memorable, high-energy, and culturally impactful.The NFL has a long history of catching heat for halftime performances from controversial acts to bold surprises but Goodell insists the league is confident this is a “great show” that will unite viewers across demographics.Simply put: the NFL knows it’s impossible to please everyone, and they’re leaning into it.Unsurprisingly, the backlash has been loud. Trump slammed the pick as “absolutely ridiculous” and admitted he didn’t even know who Bad Bunny was.Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson called the choice “terrible” and suggested 82-year-old country singer Lee Greenwood as a more “patriotic” alternative.The controversy even reached Greenwood himself, who reacted diplomatically, essentially saying he appreciated the thought but didn’t expect to step into the halftime spotlight. The political critiques are clear, some conservatives see the choice as a cultural mismatch for the NFL’s biggest stage.Bad Bunny didn’t stay silent. On “Saturday Night Live,” he jokingly told critics to learn Spanish before judging him. Beyond the humor, he also highlighted the cultural significance of his performance, framing it as a celebration of Latino heritage and contributions to American culture.Fans of the Puerto Rican superstar have cheered, seeing the halftime show as a historic moment for Latin representation in U.S. sports and pop culture. Bad Bunny’s message is clear: he’s bringing his culture, energy, and artistry to a stage watched by millions, and he’s doing it unapologetically.Despite the political firestorm, Goodell is unshaken. The NFL has officially reaffirmed the show, promising fans a performance that will be “a united moment” for viewers across the country. With the event less than a year away, anticipation is skyrocketing and so are debates online about culture, politics, and entertainment.Also read - “Boycotting Bad Bunny” trends as MAGA supporters threaten to skip Super Bowl 2026 halftime show","Bad Bunny is headlining the Super Bowl LX halftime show on February 8, 2026.

One said, “What is wrong with his eyeballs?👀 as soon as the man starts talking, his eyeballs start doing some exorcist type stuff.” Another declared, “Dude thinks he’s the undertaker .” A third fan shared WWE legend The Undertaker’s signature gimmick reserved for specific matches—coming out of a coffin as a GIF with the caption: “Bro after every sentence.”A fan questioned, “Why does he keep rolling his eyes?” Another elaborated the question further, “Why do his eyes roll back in his head when he answers?” A third fan commented, “What he’s doing with his eyes is freaking me out.” A fourth fan declared, “Why is he closing his eyes when answering? No wonder he can't see what's wrong with our offensive line!” A fifth fan sarcastically said, “What’s wrong with his eyes. Maybe that’s why the OL can’t play well lol.

Miami turns to Greg Dulcich after Waller's injury

The Miami Dolphins are once again without tight end Darren Waller. The team placed Waller on injured reserve Wednesday after he suffered a pectoral injury in last week’s loss to the Cleveland Browns. The injury happened during the first half, and Waller did not return to the game. This is another frustrating setback for Waller, who had already missed the first three games of the season with a hip injury he picked up during training camp. He’s only played in four games this year and is now expected to miss at least four more. The earliest he could return is Week 12, when the Dolphins take on the New Orleans Saints after their Week 11 bye.Waller looked sharp in his season debut in Week 4, scoring two touchdowns on just three catches for 27 yards. He followed that up with five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown in the first half against the Carolina Panthers in Week 5. But since then, his numbers have dropped off. Over the last two games, he had only two catches for 12 yards and one score, as Miami’s offense began to struggle during a three-game losing streak.The Dolphins have now added tight end Greg Dulcich to the active roster from their practice squad. Dulcich was a third-round pick by the Denver Broncos and has caught 41 passes for 464 yards and two touchdowns in 21 games.Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel shared that Waller’s latest injury is another soft-tissue issue, and he made it clear the tight end probably won’t be back in the near future. “It was soft tissue,” McDaniel said. “It’s a situation that probably it would be living in hope to see him in the upcoming next weeks' games, but he’ll be diligent. This means a lot to him, but that’s kind of where I’m at with it right now with the information I have. ”With Waller heading to IR, the Dolphins have signed tight end Greg Dulcich from the practice squad to the active roster. He will now get a shot at more playing time as Miami tries to find stability on offense. Waller’s 2025 season has been anything but smooth. The Dolphins traded for him in July, bringing him out of retirement to reunite with offensive coordinator Frank Smith, who coached him during his best years with the Las Vegas Raiders. But injuries have once again gotten in the way, and now Waller faces another stretch on the sideline.",Darren Waller has been placed on injured reserve with a pectoral injury.

He called the situationwhen it involved him, yetwhen Aliskerov talked about fighting him.

Dustin Johnson’s search for form and a long-awaited win in 2025

Why the International Series Philippines matters for Dustin Johnson

What are the challenges up ahead for the champion golfer?

The upcoming International Series Philippines offers Dustin Johnson not just another tournament; it presents a pivotal moment in his career. Johnson has, for more than ten years, always taken at least one win per year since 2014, which is a record and a trait in professional golf that is consistent and of elite longevity. However, that incredible streak is now at risk as he approaches the Philippines.Dustin Johnson arrives in Sta. The Elena Golf Club is a major player among the contestants, but it goes on without a victory in 2025. The player has not been able to reach further than the third position at the LIV Golf Indianapolis tournament this season, but still, the lack of a title has taken away a lot of the usual drive that comes with his performance.Also Read: ""Starting to swing it well again"": Former world no. 1 targets Ryder Cup spot at Adare Manor That absence matters deeply. Winning each year since 2014 became part of Johnson’s narrative; it underscored his adaptability across changing tours, formats, and fields. Now, that narrative is threatened. The Philippines event represents one of perhaps only a couple more realistic chances this season for Johnson to extend his streak.For Dustin Johnson, this is going to be his first participation in the International Series Philippines as well as his first time to experience the Asian Tour schedule for 2025.LIV Golf has not only confirmed his participation but also marked him as a part of a star-studded lineup that consists of many major winners, along with local favourites.Even though he has never played on that specific course before, Johnson still has high hopes. He acknowledged that he would get a first look in advance and rely on his experience and caddie support to navigate the unknown.Dustin Johnson’s credentials are beyond question; a two-time major champion, former World No. 1, and a veteran with championship experience across global golf stages. The pressure to preserve the streak adds psychological weight. Only a strong performance, and preferably a victory, will quiet the question marks and maintain the run that made Johnson’s consistency legendary.",Dustin Johnson has won at least one tournament every year since 2014. The two- time major champion has never won in the Philippines before. Johnson has never played on the Elena Golf Club before. The International Series Philippines is Johnson's first tournament on the Asian Tour.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124744504,imgsize-825343,width-400,resizemode-4/dustin-johnson.jpg"

Moore made it clear that promoting Elander is the only move if Tennessee wants zero disruption.Former pitcher Drew Beam even tagged Tennessee athletics director Danny White directly. He wrote, “There is only one correct answer and he is already on staff!” That message quickly gained attention among Vols fans, who agreed with the players.Josh Elander has been with Tennessee since 2017, helped build three College World Series teams, and was instrumental in Tennessee’s national title run.

Having too much fun at the expense of winning football games

Lamar Jackson shouldn’t be asked to save John Harbaugh and the Ravens every week

The proverb “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy” may not accurately describe the Baltimore Ravens, whose disappointing record stands at one win and five losses. But the reversal (all play and no work) appears to be true. Otherwise, why would the Ravens' coaches remove recreational items such as ping-pong tables, basketball hoops, corn hole boards, and video game consoles from the locker room? According to the Baltimore Sun, the team wanted to make the locker room look more businesslike.Entering the 2025 season, the Ravens dreamed of a Super Bowl. But six games in, they are down to only one win and have suffered five heavy losses. Their star quarterback, Lamar Jackson , is away due to a hamstring injury sustained while playing against the Kansas City Chiefs on September 28. Coming up Sunday, Baltimore will face the Chicago Bears–but the star quarterback’s availability is still uncertain. With so much at stake, the coaches have resorted to cutting off recreational use by removing gaming materials that could be contributing, as Michael David Smith of NBC Sports put it, to “having too much fun at the expense of winning football games. ”The Baltimore Sun said, “The Ravens promptly removed several recreational staples from the locker room, including the basketball hoop near Jackson’s and Flowers’ stalls, the pingpong table that rookies Buchanan and Mike Green often battled on after practice, the once-popular corn hole boards, and yes, the video game consoles, often lit up with intense rounds of Super Smash Bros.,that regularly drew small crowds of teammates late in the day. ”On one side, the coaches are focusing on increased game performance by removing recreational items, and on the other, a lot of pressure is supposedly put on Lamar Jackson’s return to save head coach John Harbaugh and the Ravens. Talking about the same, Ravens Wire writer and Locked On Ravens podcast host Kevin Oestreicher, has shed some light on the intense pressure on the star quarterback.Kevin Oestreicher shared a video on X detailing the varied pressures on Lamar Jackson carried over the course of his career and captioned it: “Lamar Jackson shouldn’t be asked to save John Harbaugh and the Ravens every week.” Oestreicher said, “Lamar is an incredible player, right? He can do so much. He can make up for so much weakness on a roster, or teammates, or coaching, or whatever it may be. But it’s unfair to ask him to do that all the time. And the Ravens seemingly have asked him to do that a lot over the course of his career. Now, they’ve got him better weapons over the course of his career. You know, early on, it was bad how they handled that situation, not getting him a guy in there that could really help him and be that player at the wide receiver position in particular. But even still, it’s like they’re asking him to mask poor offensive line play. They’re asking him to mask poor defensive play. Now that’s not fair to me to ask of Lamar Jackson each and every single week.”","The Baltimore Ravens have removed recreational items such as ping-pong tables, basketball hoops, corn hole boards, and video game consoles from the locker room.

Stephen Curry and daughter Riley made Ayesha Curry very happy

Steohen Curry talks about his ""full circle moment"" with daughter Riley

The Los Angeles Lakers hosted the Golden State Warriors on the first day of the regular season, and that meant the whole Warriors team traveled to the City of Angels. But given this was the first game of 2025-26 NBA regular season for both teams, it was of course special - and to make it even more so, GSW star guard Stephen Curry had some special people who were there to cheer for him on the courtside. His wife, Ayesha Curry and his eldest daughter - Riley, who is 13 years old were with the traveling party, and during warm-ups, the father daughter duo shared a special moment while the mom looked absolutely joyful at the exchange.Before the Golden State Warriors faced the Los Angeles Lakers in their season opener on October 21, 2025, Stephen Curry and his 13-year-old daughter Riley shared a very sweet moment during the team's pregame warmup. During a passing routine, Riley volleyed the ball to her dad, while her mother - Ayesha Curry looked to have a huge smile on her face as she watched her husband and daughter be in their element.The Curry women made a ""little solo trip,"" to watch Steph Curry play against the Lakers, leaving the couple's other children back home. The GSW star also commented on this, saying Riley ""got spoiled"" with the one-on-one trips with the parents.The couple's oldest child sure had a good time getting to see her dad win their opening game of the season on the road.After the game, where the Golden State Warriors won against the Los Angeles Lakers 119-109, Stephen Curry told the media that the moment he shared with Riley brought back memories from his own childhood. Allegedly, he was Riley's age when his father, Dell Curry, retired from the NBA, and he loved sharing a similar experience with his daughter, bringing it all ""full circle"".“It's weird because when my dad retired, I was the same age Riley is now. So it's kind of full circle, knowing the experiences I had as a kid watching and getting to relive that as a dad now. So it's pretty special that me and (Ayesha) get to, she got spoiled with a little solo trip. So it was fun.”The Warriors, led by Curry, will be hosting the Denver Nuggets next at home - on October 23, at the Chase Center. The Warrior fans will be hoping for their favorite team to keep their winning streak going, against an opponent who will play their first game of the season against the Bay Area team.Also Read: Stephen Curry reveals what keeps him winning after Golden State Warriors’ victory over Los Angeles Lakers","Golden State Warriors beat Los Angeles Lakers 119-109 in their season opener on October 21, 2025.

Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson has been sidelined with a hamstring injury since Week 5, missing the past two games. While it was widely expected that Jackson would return after the team's Week 7 bye, his absence from Monday’s first practice back has cast doubt on his availability for Sunday’s important game against the Chicago Bears. With the Ravens sitting at 1-5, Jackson’s presence is critical as Baltimore looks to turn around a disappointing start to the 2025 NFL season.Jackson’s hamstring injury, sustained in the September 28 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, has kept him off the field since. The two-time NFL MVP did not participate in Monday’s practice — the Ravens’ first since their bye week — raising questions about whether he will be ready to start against the Bears in Week 8. While early-week practices are often light sessions focused on rest and recovery following a bye, Jackson’s absence is still notable given the urgency of the upcoming matchup.Jamison Hensley of ESPN reported, “QB Lamar Jackson remains sidelined with a hamstring injury. The 2-time NFL MVP did not participate in Monday’s practice, which was the Ravens’ first one since coming off the bye. Jackson hasn’t suited up since injuring his hamstring in Kansas City on Sept.28.”As the week progresses, the Ravens’ injury report on Wednesday will be crucial in determining Jackson’s playing status. Even a limited practice could signal that Jackson is on track to return after missing two games. Should he remain sidelined, backup quarterback Cooper Rush would be tasked with starting a third consecutive game, a scenario that could shift betting lines significantly.Baltimore’s 1-5 record has put the team in a must-win situation, especially with losses coming in Jackson’s absence. The Ravens fell to both the Houston Texans and Los Angeles Rams without their star quarterback, showing just how vital Jackson’s return would be for their playoff hopes. Despite the slow start to the season, Jackson showed strong play in the games he started, throwing for 869 yards, 10 touchdowns, and only one interception, while rushing for 166 yards and scoring once himself.If Jackson can return and play at his best, he could spark the Ravens’ season and potentially make a case for MVP consideration as Baltimore fights to reach the postseason. With the Ravens falling deeper in the standings, each game without Jackson adds pressure. Baltimore's staff remains hopeful, but time is running out. If he can’t suit up soon, the team risks falling completely out of playoff contention.","Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson has been sidelined with a hamstring injury since Week 5.

The Kansas City Chiefs have finally hit their stride. After a shaky start to the 2025 season, Patrick Mahomes Travis Kelce , and the rest of the squad have now put together back-to-back wins — and not just close ones. The Chiefs put up over 30 points in both games, including a dominant 31–0 shutout against the Las Vegas Raiders. With the return of wide receiver Rashee Rice from suspension and the offense looking more like itself, Travis Kelce isn’t hiding his excitement.After weeks of inconsistency, Kansas City has started to look like a team ready to make another run. First came a 30–17 win over the Detroit Lions. Then, they rolled over the Raiders with a blowout that wasn’t close from the opening quarter. Rashee Rice’s return gave Mahomes another option, and the passing game clicked early. Kelce made a statement in the first quarter, catching three passes from Mahomes, including a 44-yard touchdown that helped break the game open. After the win, Kelce shared some game photos on Instagram and let fans — and the rest of the league — know how he really feels about where the team is heading. He looked fired up in every shot, smiling, celebrating and clearly enjoying being back in rhythm with Mahomes.""We're really groovin' now!!"" he wrote, adding a disco ball emoji for good measure.Travis Kelce is 36 years old and in his 13th season with the Chiefs. After last season’s 40-22 Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, some wondered if he would consider hanging up his boots and retire. Instead, he decided to run it back — and right now, he’s clearly having his time in the sun. So far this season, Kelce has 31 catches for 375 yards and two touchdowns. After the Raiders win, he doubled down on his optimism for the rest of the year. ""I think it's just a glimpse of what you're going to see from here on out... sky's the limit for this group, baby.""Next up for Kansas City is a Monday Night Football showdown against the Washington Commanders on October 27. With momentum finally on their side and the offense clicking again, the Chiefs will be looking to make it three straight wins.It’s been an up-and-down start to the year, but if Travis Kelce is right, Kansas City might be just getting started.","The Kansas City Chiefs have won back-to-back games for the first time this season.

Connor Bedard and his rumored girlfriend : Truth behind the buzz

Connor Bedard family: Backbone of a champion

Connor Bedard is not only breaking records with his performances on the ice but also winning the admiration of many off it. The young Canadian virtuoso, who is only nineteen, has already become the leading figure of a new generation of hockey. However, the person behind the dazzling lights and the uproar of the arenas is a down-to-earth young man with a family that tutored him and a love life that is merely a rumor, but keeps the fans always inquisitive. Let’s get out of the rink and into the personal life of Connor Bedard’s marvelous trip.The rumors about Connor Bedard's love life have become one of the hottest topics on social media, with the supposed links to the influencer Emma Loken. Their association was mainly through their mutual online interactions, which kindled the rumor about the love affair. However, the young star did not wait long to quench the flames as he termed the speculations as “a bunch of BS,” and thus categorically rejected them. Connor, though, is not easily associated with the gossip as he remains constantly focused on his main goal — hockey.Those who are in his inner circle have described him as highly secretive, who prefers to keep his personal life out of the limelight.It is this silent determination that brings him not only victory but also recognition in the sports domain. As of 2025, he is said to be single and focused on exhausting his efforts in the mastery of his art and in being the forerunner of a new era for the Chicago Blackhawks.Every great athlete has a family behind them that gives them the drive, and for Connor Bedard, that family is very strong. He was born to Tom and Melanie Bedard in North Vancouver, and his passion for hockey was growing from the very beginning when he was able to hold a stick. His father, a logger, put in long hours but never missed a practice. His mother, the mental support, went through the ordeal of raising a sports prodigy with peace and quiet.Connor's sister, Madisen Bedard, who was a gymnast and now a kinesiology student, is still one of his biggest admirers. They have formed a ""little family"" of humility, discipline, and unconditional support—three virtues that are always displayed when Connor is skating on the ice.Connor Bedard's life is not only about goals and trophies— they are the manifestations of family, focus, and being the same amid the fame. Whether he is dealing with whispers or setting new records, the saga of Bedard is a reminder that the path to greatness starts at home, where the world does not see yet.Also Read: Who are Auston Matthews’ parents?

Edmonton Oilers rookie Isaac Howard had a night to remember, scoring his first NHL goal in a thrilling 3-2 overtime win against the Ottawa Senators on Tuesday. The 21-year-old forward’s milestone moment lit up Rogers Place and earned recognition from veteran star Leon Draisaitl , marking an early highlight in Howard’s promising NHL journey.Howard found the back of the net early in the second period, giving Edmonton a 2-0 advantage after captain Connor McDavid opened the scoring on a first-period power play. The goal showcased Howard’s poise and scoring instincts — the same qualities that made him a Hobey Baker Award winner at Michigan State, where he was recognized as the nation’s top collegiate player. His ability to read the play and finish under pressure highlighted why the Oilers drafted him and hinted at a bright future in the NHL.His milestone didn’t go unnoticed. Leon Draisaitl reposted the Oilers’ congratulatory graphic on Instagram, adding the caption, “First of many, kiddo,” and tagging Howard’s account. Teammates and fans alike quickly joined the celebration online, sharing messages of support and excitement for the rookie’s early success.Ottawa refused to go quietly, with Dylan Cozens and Thomas Chabot scoring in the third period to tie the game at 2-2.Edmonton regrouped in the extra frame, and Jake Walman sealed the victory with a power-play goal just 2:24 into overtime, giving the Oilers a 3-2 win.Goaltender Stuart Skinner recorded his 100th career victory, while veteran forward Adam Henrique skated in his 1,000th NHL game — two more reasons for Edmonton to celebrate. Draisaitl acknowledged Henrique’s milestone with a brief but powerful message on social media: “1000.”From Isaac Howard’s first NHL goal to Henrique’s 1,000th game, Tuesday’s contest was filled with defining moments for the Oilers. With leadership from McDavid and Draisaitl and fresh talent like Howard making an impact early, Edmonton’s blend of experience and youth continues to shine, and the rookie’s spotlight moment could be just the beginning of something special.Also Read: Panthers vs Bruins: Brad Marchand’s Boston comeback puts spotlight on Florida’s road trip struggles","Edmonton Oilers rookie Isaac Howard scored his first NHL goal in a thrilling 3-2 overtime win against the Ottawa Senators.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has suggested that the types of jobs that are being eliminated or transformed by artificial intelligence (AI) may not be consideredin the long run. During an interview with Rowan Cheung at OpenAI ’s recent DevDay conference, Altman was asked about the possibility of AI destroying almost a billion knowledge-worker jobs before new ones are created. Altman used a thought experiment about a farmer from half a century ago to explain the situation. He said that a farmerAltman suggested that this perspective makes him feelabout the job losses.

"Celebrating 250 years of Lucknow’s legacy: Lights, camera, Awadh; city’s timeless charm on celluloid",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/celebrating-250-years-of-lucknows-legacy-lights-camera-awadh-citys-timeless-charm-on-celluloid/articleshow/124752509.cms,"Filmmakers have long been drawn to 19th-century Lucknow, capturing its opulence, culture, and architecture





Lucknow of the 19th century, especially the life of the privileged, has often attracted filmmakers in India. The era’s opulence, culture and architecture have been portrayed in many pathbreaking films.The city of Lucknow is on the precipice of British rule. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, a poet and art lover, is made to relinquish his kingdom in 1856. The decision breaks his heart, but he does so to avoid bloodshed. The Nawab abdicates while singing a thumri, while two of his courtiers Mir and Mirza are engrossed in a game of chess elsewhere oblivious to the events unfolding around them. This is a poignant and powerful moment in director Satyajit Ray’s classic ‘Shatranj Ke Khiladi’, which juxtaposes the Nawab’s tragic downfall with the self-absorbed courtiers, who in a sense typify the era’s elite.‘Shatranj Ke Khiladi’, based on renowned litterateur Premchand’s story, not only captures the decadence of Awadh’s aristocracy but also the city’s essence, its socio-political landscape. Ray’s meticulous attention to detail brings the city’s rich culture to life, showcasing lavish feasts, elegant attire, mesmerizing Kathak performances, and the intricate nuances of thumri singing.Lucknow of the 19th century, especially the life of the privileged, has often attracted filmmakers in India.The era’s opulence, culture and architecture have been portrayed in many films, notably Muzaffar Ali’s ‘Umrao Jaan’ (1981). The film, based on Mirza Hadi Ruswa’s novel Umrao Jaan Ada, showcased the life and times of the city’s famous courtesans. The film’s lavish sets, costumes, and music transported audiences to an era of romance and refinement. “An art form captures the soul of a culture. Awadh demands both passion and patience to absorb its essence and express its timeless ethos,” Ali told TOI.Ali said his vision and attention to detail helped showcase the city’s rich cultural heritage. “The original ‘Umrao Jaan’ featuring Rekha captured Awadh in its most authentic way. Bollywood generally doesn’t go into minute details, but I passionately depicted Awadh through its vivid portrayal of the city’s Nawabi culture, architecture, and traditions in ‘Umrao Jaan’,” he said.He added, “The film showcased Lucknow’s iconic landmarks, such as the Bara Imambara and Baradari, which are synonymous with the city’s history and architecture. The movie depicted the city’s cultural heritage, including its music, dance, and poetry. The film’s soundtrack featured soulful ghazals that reflected the city’s musical traditions.... I showcased the local dialect, thumri (a traditional genre of Indian music), and chikankari (city’s traditional embroidery art form) in their purest forms. The entire shooting was done in Lucknow and some parts of Amethi, Kakori and Malihabad.”“The film’s dialogue and characters’ behaviour reflected the city’s unique cultural ethos, emphasizing the importance of language, etiquette, and manners in Nawabi society. The movie was set against the backdrop of the decline of the Mughal empire and the British colonial era, providing a glimpse into the city’s complex history and cultural evolution,” Ali said.According to historian and columnist Ravi Bhatt, “Lucknow is the only city in India, and perhaps Southeast Asia, which has an intangible heritage and culture. Known for its sophistication, the language here plays a major role, catching the imagination of filmmakers. Right from ‘Shatranj Ke Khiladi’, ‘Umrao Jaan’ and ‘Mere Huzoor’, these films were inspired by the rich Nawabi culture.”Film critics feel the city’s unique blend of culture, history, and aesthetics provides a captivating backdrop and inspiration for various films, especially those set in the past or exploring themes of romance, royalty, and social dynamics.In fact, Ali’s directorial debut ‘Gaman’ starring Smita Patil also shows disintegration of Awadh, migration, heartbreak, hopelessness, wait and longing. “Awadh is intricately woven into all my films, as my roots here have profoundly shaped me and taught me invaluable lessons throughout my life... Awadh minus Awadhis is equal to zero,” Ali said.To infuse a real touch, the veteran director said he focused on minute details, incorporating elements like Banarasi panchui saris, Persian carpets, traditional lighting sources, intricately designed paan daan, exquisite glassware and ornate jewellery.‘Chaudhvin Ka Chand’ starring Waheeda Rahman and Guru Dutt is another classic that portrays Lucknow as a city steeped in Nawabi culture and tradition. The film showcases the city’s architectural grandeur, lush gardens, and ornate buildings, highlighting its rich history. The movie is set in the world of Lucknow’s Nawabi society, where noble women wear veils in public, and houses are divided into common and women’s only sections.The film features delicate Urdu dialogue, lush music, and opulent visuals, reflecting the city’s cultural heritage. Although specific landmarks aren’t mentioned, the movie’s setting and cinematography capture the essence of Lucknow’s architectural style. The movie explores the intricacies of relationships and societal norms within Lucknow’s well-heeled Muslim social circle.In fact, the iconic song “Aye Sheher-e-Lucknow” from the 1967 film ‘Palki’, sung by the legendary Mohammad Rafi for Rajendra Kumar, is an ode to the historical city. Penned by Shakeel Badayuni, a poet closely associated with Lucknow, the lyrics conclude with: “Nibhaye apni shaan bhi, Badhaye dil ki shaan bhi, Hain aise meherbaan bhi, ye Lakhnau ki sarzameen” - a tribute to the city’s grandeur, generosity, and warmth.The 1978 film ‘Junoon’, directed by Shyam Benegal, also portrays the lifestyle of the landed aristocracy in the Awadh region, with Lucknow being a major center of the 1857 uprising. The film was shot in parts of Lucknow, Malihabad and Kakori.According to Nadeem Hasnain, a well-known social scientist, the cinematic connection between Lucknow and Bombay is longstanding, with each city influencing the other’s film industry in profound ways. A testament to this bond is the establishment of a full-fledged film studio in Lucknow in 1926, situated on Vidhan Sabha Marg. Born out of a collaborative effort between prominent zamindars and rajas, including Raja Saheb Maurawan and Raja Saheb Oel of Alipur State and Ausanganj State, this studio was initially known as Ideal Studio and later renamed Kailash Studio.The 2011 film ‘Always Kabhi Kabhi’ starring Ali Fazal, prominently featured La Martiniere College in Lucknow as a key filming location. The 2005 crime drama ‘Sehar’, directed by Kabeer Kaushik and starring Arshad Warsi and Mahima Chaudhry, is set in Lucknow and delves into the theme of organized crime in Uttar Pradesh, showcasing the police’s efforts to combat it. The 1979 ‘Sawan Ko Aane Do’ was also shot mostly in the interior and outskirts of Lucknow.","Lucknow of the 19th century, especially the life of the privileged, has often attracted filmmakers in India. The era’s opulence, culture and architecture have been portrayed in many pathbreaking films.

Former Indian cricketer Atul Wassan has criticised Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed's remarks about cricketer Sarfaraz Khan's exclusion from the India A squads, which she suggested was due to his religious identity. Wassan expressed feeling ashamed as part of the cricketing fraternity over attempts to bring communal narratives into the sport.Shama Mohamed sparked controversy on social media platform X by questioning whether Sarfaraz Khan's non-selection was related to his surname, also mentioning Gautam Gambhir in her post.""I think as part of the Cricket system, as a former player, I feel ashamed that a certain party spokesperson has said that. Look at our neighbours, how Cricketers had to survive. Someone had to convert from Christianity to Islam to survive. How Hindu players were ostracised there. It has never happened here. That is why we held a higher moral ground but if our political parties will use a player as a pawn. Very unfortunate,"" said Wassan.""Whenever this communal card is played in sports in India, I feel wretched in my stomach. I played cricket; we had never even thought of any other cricketer in terms of their community or where they came from, because it is the quality of the player. She forgets that India has been led by Mohammad Azharuddin for 12 years.Even currently, too, Mohammed Shami, Mohammed Siraj.""""I still believe that Sarfaraz should have been there. That is an entirely different topic, that's a Cricketing topic where we can debate, and our opinion is different from the selector's opinion. But that doesn't mean that you give this shape and tenor of him being from a particular community. Then you are maligning all the cricketers and the system. It is a big insult to the Indian Cricket system,"" Wassan added.The controversy emerged after BCCI announced the India A squads for two four-day matches against South Africa A, scheduled at the BCCI Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru.The BCCI announced two different squads for the four-day matches. The first squad includes Rishabh Pant as captain, along with players like Sai Sudharsan, Devdutt Padikkal, and Rajat Patidar. The second squad features additions like KL Rahul, Mohammed Siraj, and Prasidh Krishna, while maintaining Pant as captain. In neither squads did Sarfaraz find a place. Sarfaraz Khan , who made his Test debut against England in February last year, has scored 371 runs in six Tests at an average of 37.10, including a century and three fifties.His last appearance for India was against New Zealand at Wankhede in November last year.In first-class cricket, Sarfaraz maintains an impressive average of 65.19 in 56 matches, scoring 2,467 runs with 16 hundreds and 15 fifties.Despite averaging 117.47 in first-class cricket over the last five years, Sarfaraz's chances for the Indian Test team appear limited after being overlooked for the Australia tour.",Atul Wassan has condemned Congress' Shama Mohammed's remarks on Sarfaraz Khan.
