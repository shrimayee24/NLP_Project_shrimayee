Ricky Stenhouse Jr.'s car will carry a ""Real American Beer"" paint scheme and ""HULKAMANIA Forever"" decal on his Hyak Motorsports No. 47 Chevrolet.The design features the ripping off of his shirt, an image synonymous with Hogan's energy and personality. It is an emotional tribute in the wake of Hogan's passing just this week, for fans of both motorsport and wrestling alike.Stenhouse Jr. has partnered with Hogan's Real American Beer brand before, so this isn't the first time. The livery featuring a patriotic theme first turned heads earlier this summer at Michigan International Speedway with a red, white, and blue scheme. But this new paint scheme features extra sentiment, paying homage to the legacy and personality of Hogan.Highly regarded for their creative tributes and thematic liveries, Hyak Motorsports teamed with the Real American Beer to design something that would appeal to fans but also pay proper homage to the wrestling icon.This partnership celebrates Hogan's in-ring legacy and embodies the values of pride, grit, and what it truly means to be an American, characteristics that Stenhouse and Hogan both have come to embody in their respective arenas of competition.Based on the brand, Real American Beer sees this opportunity as one that serves as ""a celebration of strength and nostalgia,"" which the brand says also makes a natural pairing with the high-octane excitement of NASCAR.Stenhouse Jr. is approaching the “Go Bowling at The Glen” race at Watkins Glen International this weekend with a distinct purpose.

Joe Alwyn wanted the world to stop obsessing over his past with Taylor Swift

As Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce dominate pop culture, Joe Alwyn remains out of the spotlight

Long before Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce became pop culture’s favorite power couple, she shared a six-year relationship with actor Joe Alwyn, a romance that ended quietly in 2023. But as Swift’s love life shifted, Alwyn’s rare comments in early 2025 reignited public curiosity over the breakup and its emotional aftermath.In a candid January 2025 interview with The Guardian, actor Joe Alwyn addressed his high-profile breakup with Taylor Swift and made it clear he’s long since turned the page. When asked about their 2023 split, Alwyn responded bluntly: “That’s something for other people to do. We’re talking about something that’s a while ago now in my life.”Despite fans still dissecting the end of their relationship, which inspired much of Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department album, Alwyn expressed disinterest in revisiting the past. “If you let all of that other stuff in… you’re living from the outside in. And then you’re pretty f*ed,” he told the outlet, adding that he leaned on “great family and friends and real things” to stay grounded.He emphasized his focus on personal and professional growth, not headlines. “Right from the beginning, I tried to focus on the things that are meaningful for me: friends, family, work.”Since Taylor Swift went public with NFL star Travis Kelce in late 2023, their relationship has drawn intense media attention.From public date nights to song lyrics nodding to Kelce, Swift seems to have embraced love in the limelight, a stark contrast to her ultra-private years with Alwyn.In a prior interview with The Sunday Times, Alwyn acknowledged the difficulty of ending a long, committed relationship under the scrutiny of the world. “What is unusual and abnormal in this situation is that… it’s suddenly in the public domain,” he said, reflecting on the media frenzy surrounding their split.Also Read: “She has a larger impact on…”: NASA engineer reveals the power moves behind Taylor Swift's success and Travis Kelce’s role Now, while Swift dances into stadiums with Kelce by her side, Alwyn remains focused on his career and staying “in a good place.”","Actor Joe Alwyn addressed his 2023 breakup with Taylor Swift in a January 2025 interview with The Guardian.

I couldn’t be more fired up for you man. Congratulations!”Landwehr, a Highland Park High School alum who shares a hometown with golf superstar Scottie Scheffler and NFL quarterback Matthew Stafford, used the moment to credit his teammates.“Y’all are part of the biggest reason why I show up every day,” he said. “Been doing this for five years, it doesn’t get old, keep working.

But in a world where filters rule and perfection often feels like a social media requirement, the singer and mom of four recently decided to shift the narrative.

Rebuilding Around Devin Booker

Could Trae Young Fit With Devin Booker?

Is Phoenix Ready to Gamble Again?

Thehave been one of the busiest teams this offseason, dismantling their former “big three” and reshaping their roster around franchise cornerstone Devin Booker. Now, with the dust far from settled, Phoenix is emerging as one of the top contenders to acquire Atlanta Hawks guardin a potential blockbuster trade.According to updated odds from Bovada, the Phoenix Suns have the fourth-best chance (+450) to land Trae Young this summer. The Orlando Magic currently lead the pack at +250, followed by the Brooklyn Nets (+290) and the Sacramento Kings (+375).These numbers reflect growing speculation around Young’s future in Atlanta, particularly as the Hawks have yet to offer him a contract extension. The possibility of the 25-year-old point guard being moved has prompted interest across the league, with Phoenix now in the thick of the conversation.Phoenix’s intentions became clear early in the offseason when they traded Kevin Durant to the Houston Rockets and bought out Bradley Beal’s massive contract - effectively ending the short-lived and underwhelming big three era. Only Devin Booker remains, recently signing a lucrative two-year contract extension as the team’s centerpiece moving forward.Key Offseason Moves by the Phoenix Suns:• Traded: Kevin Durant to Houston• Bought Out: Bradley Beal• Signed: Devin Booker to a 2-year extension• Acquired:• Jalen Green• Dillon Brooks• Khaman Maluach (via Durant trade pick)• Mark Williams• Rasheer Fleming• Koby BreaThese transactions indicate a clear strategic pivot towards younger talent and long-term planning.Despite this, the potential acquisition of Trae Young could accelerate their competitive timeline.A backcourt pairing of Young and Booker would immediately rank among the most offensively dynamic in the league. Young is a high-usage playmaker who thrives with the ball in his hands, while Devin Booker has evolved into an elite scorer and off-ball threat. The synergy could mirror the kind of backcourt chemistry seen in past duos like Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum.However, acquiring Young wouldn’t come cheap. As reported by Nathaniel Holloway of Athlon, “it would likely take the Phoenix Suns giving up Green in a trade package for Young, though Young’s fit next to Booker would be a much better one than Green’s.”Still, such a trade would force the Suns to part with key assets - possibly including Jalen Green, recent draft picks, or future capital. That’s a steep price for a team not expected to be a serious contender next season, despite Young’s ability to shift the needle.While Phoenix is not projected to be a top team in the West for the upcoming season, the front office appears eager to reboot their identity and re-establish relevance in the competitive Western Conference. The franchise’s willingness to consider Young shows they aren’t content with a slow rebuild.Yet caution remains. Holloway notes, “the Suns may not want to move on from some of their young talent and draft capital to land Young,” especially if the return on investment doesn’t guarantee a deep playoff run.With the franchise fresh off a failed superteam experiment, the Phoenix Suns are clearly in transition. Devin Booker remains the focal point, but the possible addition of Trae Young adds a new layer of intrigue. Whether Phoenix chooses to part with their new wave of young talent to pursue another star remains to be seen - but if Trae Young is made available, the Suns are expected to be serious players.Also read: Why Josh Giddey Should Sign a $70 Million Contract and What It Means for the Chicago Bulls’ Future As always in the NBA, where there’s smoke, there’s often fire.","Bovada Odds Place Phoenix Suns Among Top Suitors for Trae Young.

A Rare Setback for the Celtic's Star

Community Support and Team Backing during Tatum's Recovery

In one of his first public outings since undergoing surgery for a ruptured Achilles,was seen walking unaided in Providence, Rhode Island. The 2024 NBA champion visited the Manton Heights neighborhood Thursday morning, moving without a walking boot or crutches - a clear sign of progress in his long road to recovery. Jayson Tatum , who suffered the injury in late May, appeared upbeat and positive during the event. Despite the physical limitations that come with such a serious injury, he was all smiles as he joined head coach Joe Mazzulla - a Rhode Island native - in helping break ground on a new early education center scheduled to open in 2026. The pair were met by a lively crowd of fans, including children and media members, all eager to see their franchise player. Boston Celtics President Rich Gotham was also present and offered an optimistic update on Jayson Tatum’s rehab. While acknowledging that there is still a long way to go, Gotham emphasized the positive strides the 27-year-old has made since his surgery.“He’s gone from walking around in a boot and just kind of wiggling his toes as a rehab to, as you see him today, he’s walking around a little more freely,” Gotham told reporters. “That’s obviously very encouraging to all of us at the Celtics. He’s such a special guy, such a special player, but also a special person.” (H/t: ClutchPoints)Gotham added that small milestones - like Tatum walking around the practice facility without a boot - are significant morale boosters for the team and staff.“So, we’re just all in his court, rooting for him to get back,” he said. “It’s a grueling process, but seeing him out at something like this and giving back to the community - that means a lot.”Jayson Tatum has been a cornerstone of the Celtics’ success over the last six seasons. He’s led the team in scoring each year while earning six consecutive All-Star selections. Tatum has played in 585 regular season games across eight years, averaging 34.5 minutes per game - rarely missing time.That reliability makes this Achilles injury an especially tough blow. For someone who’s played basketball nearly non-stop since childhood, facing extended time away from the court is unfamiliar territory.Thursday’s event was more than a symbolic community gesture - it served as a reminder of the broad support Jayson Tatum has behind him. The local Rhode Islanders cheered him on enthusiastically, especially the children of Manton Heights who excitedly counted down the moments until they got to meet their hero.While the Celtics’ training facility provides a more subdued atmosphere for Jayson Tatum’s recovery, the energy in Providence highlighted just how important he is to fans - and how much he’s missed.Without Tatum, the Celtics are unlikely to reach the 60-win benchmark for a third straight season. Exactly how the team adjusts in his absence remains to be seen. But one thing is certain: from Celtics Nation to the front office to the kids in Providence, everyone is counting down the seconds until their star returns.Also read: Warriors' Seth Curry Opens Up About Draymond Green’s Jab That Made Things Awkward With Stephen Curry And based on Thursday’s appearance, that return is inching closer.","Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum was seen walking unaided in Providence, Rhode Island.

Bilhal Kone suffers devastating leg injury in preseason opener against Colts



Depth tested in the Ravens’ secondary



During the Baltimore Ravens’ preseason opener against the Indianapolis Colts, rookie cornerback Bilhal Kone went down with what appeared to be a serious leg injury. The incident occurred late in the first quarter, abruptly ending the young defender’s night and potentially casting a shadow over his promising NFL debut.Bilhal Kone, a sixth-round pick in April out of Western Michigan, had been making a strong case to secure one of the final roster spots in Baltimore’s competitive secondary. Known for his physicality and keen sense of timing, the rookie brought impressive college credentials—leading Western Michigan last season with 70 tackles, nine pass breakups, and an interception. Unfortunately, just as he was finding his rhythm, disaster struck.While defending Colts wideout Ashton Dulin near the end zone, Kone landed awkwardly following an incomplete pass. What initially seemed like a routine play quickly escalated into a grim scene. Kone clutched his left leg in visible pain, prompting Ravens medical staff to rush to his side. Moments later, an air cast was placed on the injured limb before he was carted off the field. According to NFL Network's Mike Garafolo, the rookie appeared to be in severe distress throughout the ordeal.Baltimore ruled Kone out for the remainder of the game, but the concern now extends beyond just preseason action. With the Ravens already boasting a seasoned cornerback group—including Marlon Humphrey, Nate Wiggins, and Jaire Alexander—the rookie was facing tough competition for a spot. However, Kone’s resilience was evident even before this injury, having already overcome a shoulder issue earlier in the offseason.His injury is not only a setback for him personally, but also a test for Baltimore’s depth at the cornerback position. While veterans are expected to shoulder most of the load, the team had been hopeful that Kone could add youthful energy and versatility to the unit. Now, with his immediate future uncertain, the Ravens—and fans—are left waiting for further updates.Also Read: Blake Lively ‘terrified’ of Taylor Swift lyrical revenge as Travis Kelce remains her biggest supporter","Rookie cornerback Bilhal Kone went down with what appeared to be a serious leg injury.

Free-Throw Line Jab: Draymond Takes Aim at Seth Curry

Draymond Green’s Trash Talk Legacy

Stephen Curry Caught in the Middle

Seth Curry’s Response: Pride in the ‘Journeyman’ Label

Trash talk has long been part of NBA culture - a psychological tactic used to unnerve opponents and gain a mental edge. But for, one of those moments turned unexpectedly personal and awkward whendelivered a sharp jab - with Seth’s older brother,, standing right next to him.On a recent episode of the G.O.T.E. podcast, Seth Curry shared a story that perfectly captured the raw honesty of NBA trash talk. During a game between his team and the Golden State Warriors , Seth was at the free-throw line when Draymond Green began chirping at him.“I’m at the free throw line, and Draymond’s out there. We’re talking… I say something, and he’s like, ‘Why are you talking? You’re a journeyman. Every team in the league.’ It was funny because Steph was right there. It was kind of awkward,” Seth recalled.The remark cut deeper than the usual in-game banter - not because of the content, but because of the context. With Stephen Curry, Draymond’s longtime teammate and Seth’s brother, just a few feet away, the moment gained a layer of personal discomfort.Draymond Green is known for more than his on-court skills. He’s arguably one of the NBA’s premier trash talkers, regularly engaging in verbal battles designed to throw opponents off their game.From telling Paul Pierce he wouldn’t get a Kobe-style farewell to even teasing Steph during a 52-point outburst, Draymond doesn’t hold back - even with friends or teammates.His remarks are part performance, part mind game - always aiming to dominate the mental matchup as much as the physical one. For Draymond, trash talk is a tool of entertainment.What made this particular exchange notable wasn’t just what Draymond said - it was who was watching. Stephen Curry found himself in an unusual position: watching his teammate roast his own brother in the middle of a live game.Seth acknowledged the tension: “It was funny ’cause Steph was right there. It was kind of awkward. Draymond’s my guy, but he’s gonna talk when we’re on the floor.”While Steph didn’t respond publicly, his silent presence added to the strangeness of the situation. It was a collision of loyalty, competitiveness, and family pride - all in a single moment at the charity stripe.Rather than bristle at the “journeyman” tag, Seth Curry embraced it. His career has taken him across multiple franchises, but it’s also been marked by persistence and steady performance.“That’s a badge of honor for me. How many guys been on two teams and out the league? I’d rather be on eight, nine teams and have a 12-year career than be one-and-done. So I took pride in it.”Seth’s ability to spin a perceived insult into a mark of pride speaks to his resilience and professionalism. In a league where consistency is often undervalued, his path is a testament to hard work and adaptability.Also read: Jonathan Kuminga’s $45 Million Dilemma: The Contract That Could End the Golden State Warriors Standoff Fans love these unscripted moments.

Brooke Hogan questions the cause of death of Hulk Hogan

Family disputes and private farewells have been the talk of the town following Hulk Hogan’s demise



The death of wrestling legend Hulk Hogan has left his daughter, Brooke Hogan , with more questions than answers, and she’s willing to pay out of her own pocket to get them. In a series of public statements, Brooke expressed her suspicion about the circumstances surrounding her father’s passing and called it “weird” that no autopsy had been performed. Now, she says she’s ready to fund one herself to protect his dignity and legacy.Hulk Hogan, born Terry Bollea, died on July 24 at the age of 71 after reportedly suffering a heart attack at his Clearwater, Florida home. Medical records also listed chronic lymphocytic leukemia and atrial fibrillation as underlying conditions. While officials ruled the death natural, Brooke remains unconvinced by the timeline and lack of further investigation.In an Instagram Story, the 37-year-old wrote, “I’m glad to see that my dad has not been cremated and that Sky is waiting because of family questions. With all of the speculation and uncertainty of my dad’s death, I want to personally offer to pay for an autopsy if that’s what it takes to get it done. My dad’s dignity and legacy deserves it.”She reiterated her doubts during an appearance on The Bubba the Love Sponge Show, saying, “It’s weird that no autopsy was performed.Because yes, you can have a heart attack, but what was the reason for the heart attack is the question.” Brooke also revealed that the leukemia diagnosis only came to her attention through medical documents after his death, despite having seen what she described as consistently healthy blood work.“One doctor, I quote, said his blood is like a 25-year-old’s,” she said. “He took the most care of his body… How did nobody catch a high white blood cell count? … The lack of an autopsy and then a leukemia diagnosis out of nowhere? It’s BS.”Hogan’s widow, Sky Daily, addressed Brooke’s concerns in her own Instagram post, confirming that cremation has been delayed until “every question about his medical care is answered first.” She added that the family will honor Hogan’s wish for cremation once they have “peace of mind,” and urged fans to be wary of “heartbreakingly misleading media stories created by faceless AI accounts” or outsiders.While Hogan was laid to rest during a private funeral in Clearwater earlier this week, Brooke did not attend. Instead, she held her own intimate beach memorial with her husband, former NHL player Steven Oleksy, and their twins. In her tribute, Brooke explained, “My father hated the morbidity of funerals… as his daughter, I had to make my own decision to honor him the best and most genuine way I knew how… privately.”She added that the only thing missing was her father, “in his pop-up lawn chair watching the waves and the sunset.”Also Read: Brooke Hogan threatens legal action for spreading “lies” in her name amid family drama following Hulk Hogan’s passing","Hulk Hogan died on July 24 at the age of 71 after reportedly suffering a heart attack at his Clearwater, Florida home.

Can Jordan Addison's trouble with the law cost him his career? NFL insiders believe it just might

Jordan Addison's suspension puts Vikings in a tough spot ahead of Week 1

Jordan Addison has had a rough few weeks. The Minnesota Vikings' wide receiver Jordan Addison was suspended for three games for violating the NFL’s personal conduct policy. Basically, Addison pleaded no contest to a 2024 DUI case. In 2023, even before reporting for his first training camp, Addison was reportedly pulled over for driving 140 in a 55 zone and his license was revoked for six months. So far Addison has been involved with two separate vehicular incidents, one associated with alcohol and one for speeding.Addison’s troubles on the road have not gone unnoticed by the NFL. And now insiders believe his recklessness may cost him his career, at least until he can clean up his mess. Addison avoided trial after facing two misdemeanour DUIs for his July 12, 2024, arrest by pleading no contest.Addison’s attorney confirmed that he will pay a fine and complete two online courses, and his probation is expected to be shortened from 12 to six months.NFL analysts Jason Fitz and Caroline Fenton recently sat down to talk about Addison’s future. Since the Vikings' wide receiver will be suspended for the first three games of the 2025 season, it looks like his career is on shaky legs.“(But yeah) we now have two vehicular incidents, one including a tremendous amount of speed and the other including a DUI, all within a year of each other for somebody that is sitting in the NFL right now with this much expectation and pressure on them, all of these things, making bad life decisions over and over again,” said NFL analyst Jason Fitz.Fenton agreed with this and remarked, “He's doing dumb stuff that hurts the team and we go….Too fast and getting a DUI, it doesn't make Jordan Addison a bad person. It just means that he's a person who's made bad decisions, but he's continued to make bad decision after bad decision after bad decision, and this abuse of the substance abuse policy is just the next chapter of dumb things that he's doing that hurts the team.”Other experts also believe that Addison’s suspension puts him under tremendous pressure. In two seasons with the Vikings, Addison has started 29 games, and he has totalled 133 catches for 1,786 yards and 19 touchdowns. The Minnesota Vikings are roughly 30 days away from the start of Week 1, and wide receiver Justin Jefferson is nursing a hamstring injury and may not be available for Week 1. And now with Addison’s newfound suspension, the team is in bad shape.CBS Sports’ Jamey Eisenberg remarked recently, “Not having Addison is going to hurt McCarthy, but yes, there are a lot of questions in regards to the three main pass catchers of Jefferson, Addison, and Hockenson…”Eisenberg also comments about Addison that this suspension could factor into his ADP. The average draft position or ADP represents the average position at which a player is selected in fantasy football drafts. But it is also a great tool for managers to navigate how a player is valued which can guide their strategies.Eisenberg says, “He was, without a suspension, going to be drafted as a borderline starter in two receiver leagues and a definite started in three receiver leagues. Now, I think you just approach it as, there’s no bye weeks in the first three weeks of the season.”“You just take him as one of your high-end reserves with the potential of, when he does comeback, that he’s playing at the level that he’s shown in the first two years of his career,” he adds.","Minnesota Vikings' wide receiver Jordan Addison was suspended for three games for violating the NFL’s personal conduct policy.

Pittsburgh Steelers expected to keep Darnell Washington at tight end despite growing tackle buzz

Pittsburgh Steelers tight end Darnell Washington is gaining attention again; this time, not just for his performance but for a possible position change. The idea came up during the August 7 episode of Pittsburgh Steelers Morning Rush, where host Alan Saunders explored whether Darnell Washington could eventually shift from tight end to offensive tackle. It’s not just a podcast hot take, fans and analysts have been watching his training camp practices and questioning if his incredible size and blocking power could help fill a bigger role on the offensive line.Darnell Washington impressed training camp with his blocking ability and physicality. At 6-foot-7 and close to 270 pounds, he stands physically as an NFL offensive lineman would.When he exhibits his natural strength and technique through the blocking drills, it's easy to see why people wonder if he could help a struggling offensive line.Social media lit up with Pittsburgh Steelers fans with videos of him moving defenders and the conversation took off. Others even wondered if he could be a better tackle than second year player Broderick Jones, who has struggled this preseason.Alan Saunders acknowledged those comments and said while it’s still just talk, it’s not unrealistic. Darnell Washington was asked about the possibility himself and responded positively.He said he believes he has the skills to play offensive tackle but is focused on being a tight end unless the team asks for something else.Despite the growing buzz, the Pittsburgh Steelers don’t appear to be changing Darnell Washington’s role any time soon. He's in a potent tight end group with Pat Freiermuth and Jonnu Smith, and head coach Mike Tomlin appears to be enthused about employing all three of them to different degrees of effectiveness this season.Darnell Washington's combination of size, strength, and catching gives him tremendous value in any offensive scheme.For the time being, he appears to be staying at tight end, but his versatility can offer options if injuries or change to the starting lineup occur later in the year. One thing is certain that Darnell Washington won’t be hard to miss.","Pittsburgh Steelers tight end Darnell Washington is gaining attention for a possible position change.

Kyle Clifford's journey from Stanley Cups to Toronto Maple Leafs

What Kyle Clifford brought to the Marlies, plus the extra boost of his leadership

Clifford's new role with the Toronto Maple Leafs



After 15 hard-fought seasons in professional hockey, Kyle Clifford has officially put away the skates. The player once best known for being an enforcer and a teammate-first guy is now entering a new role off the ice. Clifford will be continuing with the Toronto Maple Leafs in a player development role that will mold young talent. His passage into this new field is the closing of one chapter and the opening of another, where his experience and leadership will continue to be greatly valued by the organization.Kyle Clifford began his journey in the NHL with the Los Angeles Kings, who could boast of Clifford helping them win Stanley Cups in 2012 and 2014. His influence was indeed noticed during the 2014 playoffs when he managed one goal and six assists in 24 games. Going for a crash-bang approach, Clifford cemented a reputation as that guy for whom fourth-lining meant never backing down and bringing intensity to every tick of the clock.The trade involving Clifford and Campbell occurred in February of 2020. Moore and two third-round picks were shipped to the Kings in this deal.Clifford was in Toronto for a while and subsequently went to the St. Louis Blues for a year before returning to the Maple Leafs sometime in November 2021.The other side of the coin is: with his NHL career winding down, Clifford accepted his assigned role with the Toronto Marlies in the AHL. Over the course of three seasons, Clifford scored 22 goals and assisted on 34 others for a total of 116 appearances. Beyond the numbers, Clifford took on the mantle of an elder statesman for the younger players, gaining respect in the dressing room and imparting wisdom on the touring prospects.Former teammate Alex Steeves appreciated the influence Clifford had in being a commodity for any player chasing an NHL dream. Clifford's work ethic and straight-up attitude struck a chord with his friends and staff, and that might just be what makes this transition seamless for him after hanging it up.Back in July, Clifford was at the ice with the Maple Leafs in the development camp, working directly with the prospects alongside former teammate Jake Muzzin. The move into player development seems to be a natural next step for someone who has given so much to the sport. With 735 NHL games and two Stanley Cups to his credit, Clifford's experience will surely be invaluable in sculpting the future talent for Toronto.Also Read: Winnipeg Jets captain Adam Lowry shares news of engagement to Laura Quinton Though the physical aspect of his hockey life may be over as Clifford has hung up the skates, his hockey journey remains.

The final, planned for November 2, is also tentatively scheduled to be held in Bengaluru, provided Pakistan does not qualify.""We've written to the State Government and are awaiting a response.

"100 years on, Kakori heroes inspire Gen Z",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/100-years-on-kakori-heroes-inspire-gen-z/articleshow/123179502.cms,"By- Varun Bhatt & Shivendra Vikram SinghAs the Kakori Train Action marks its centenary this year, a compelling question arises: how well does Gen Z recall one of the key moments in India’s freedom struggle? In an age defined by reels, memes, and fleeting digital trends, is there still room in young minds for narratives of sacrifice, unity, and resistance? Interestingly, many students are beginning to rediscover forgotten history reclaiming the legacy of revolutionaries whose voices once echoed across the country.Chinmay, a second-year student of MA (journalism) views Kakori Action not merely as an act of rebellion, but as a significant moment in India’s struggle for independence.“It was planned by the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), and the idea was to take money from the British govt to support the freedom movement, without hurting ordinary people. Revolutionaries like Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, and later Bhagat Singh, were deeply involved. It was not just about Rs 4,600 they looted. It was a strong message against British rule,” he says.Karan Singh Yadava, who is pursuing PhD in English, describes Kakori Action as a turning point in India’s struggle for independence. “It marked a decisive step towards freedom. The execution of Ram Prasad Bismil and three other revolutionaries ignited the feeling of patriotism among the people with greater intensity and gave a new direction to the movement,” he says.“Recently, I watched the play ‘A se Aazadi’, which showed how the Kakori Action ignited resistance among the youth during the freedom struggle. What stood out the most was the unity among Hindus and Muslims who fought side by side against the common enemy,” says Tarun Agarwal, a BCA student at Lucknow University.“That kind of communal harmony is the real spirit of secularism. Today, we need to draw inspiration and come together to fight against corruption in society,” he adds. “Kakori Action was a powerful symbol of collective effort, it showed how people from all communities came together for a common cause. That unity brought a wave of change in society and inspired countless others to join the freedom movement. It’s a reminder that real progress begins when we rise above our differences and stand united,” says Sufi Siddharth, a student of political science at Delhi University.For Gen Z, remembering Kakori is not just about history, but about learning values that can help build a fair and united country. Today, young people may learn about it in many ways through books, plays or online. But the lesson remains the same: standing strong and united can bring change.","The Kakori Train Action marks its centenary this year.

Cheryl Reeve speaks out at practice after string of disturbing WNBA incidents

Also Read:

WNBA fans and players were stunned as games in recent weeks were stopped because of unexpected and disturbing interruptions, green sex toys being thrown onto the court. Videos of the incidents have gone viral online, drawing both jokes and outrage. But for many, especially those in the WNBA, it’s not a joke. The issue has now sparked a serious response from one of the league’s most respected voices.After practice on Thursday, August 8, Cheryl Reeve, the coach of the Minnesota Lynx, pulled some reporters aside. She wasn’t joking around - her tone was serious. She spoke about the weird stuff that’s been happening at recent WNBA games. People have been tossing green dildos onto the court during play. It’s been stopping the games and leaving everyone, including the players and fans, totally thrown off.“This has been going on for centuries, the sexualization of women,” Cheryl Reeve said. “This is the latest version of that. It is not funny. It should not be the butt of jokes on any radio show, in print, or in comments.”She added, “We’re not the joke. They are the problem. And we need to take action.”Her comments came just days after the latest incidents occurred. On Tuesday, August 6, a green sex toy landed on the floor just before halftime of the Los Angeles Sparks vs.Indiana Fever game at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles.That same night, during the New York Liberty vs. Dallas Wings game at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, a fan tried to throw a similar object, but it didn’t reach the court.Earlier, the first known case happened on July 29 during the game between the Atlanta Dream and the Golden State Valkyries. According to OutKick, Delbert Carver, 23, was arrested on August 2 in connection with that incident.On August 1, another green dildo was thrown during the Valkyries vs. Chicago Sky game. And at the Mercury vs. Sun game on August 6, Kaden Lopez, 18, was arrested after doing the same thing. A crypto group behind the so-called “Green Dildo Coin” has now claimed responsibility for the coordinated acts.Coach Cheryl Reeve isn’t laughing. She wants those responsible to be held fully accountable. She believes it’s not just a prank, it’s part of a bigger problem of how women are treated, especially in sports.","Cheryl Reeve, the coach of the Minnesota Lynx, spoke out on Thursday, August 8.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander honored with key to Hamilton after MVP heroics in the Oklahoma City Thunder’s NBA title



Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is an NBA star swiftly building his legacy



The streets of Hamilton roared with pride on Thursday as the city celebrated its most decorated basketball export, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. The Oklahoma City Thunder superstar, fresh off an MVP season and a championship victory, was handed the key to the city by Mayor Andrea Horwath in front of thousands at Hamilton Stadium. Adding to the moment, Horwath announced a street will soon bear his name, extending his legacy in the city he proudly calls home.Shai Gilgeous-Alexander receives a heartfelt tribute from his hometown. Standing in the north end zone with the NBA championship trophy aloft, the 27-year-old shared why the honor struck such a chord.“Growing up as I traveled across the world, to countless states, cities and countries people always asked where I was from,” he told the raucous crowd. “I took pride in letting everyone know I was from Hamilton… I carry that with me every day and everywhere I go so you guys can only imagine how overwhelming the joy was when I found out I was getting a key to the city I love and a street named after me.”The joy was visible when Gilgeous-Alexander, donning a Hamilton Tiger-Cats shirt with his No. 2, admitted to hiding teary eyes behind sunglasses. “Early on, I had my shades on so you couldn’t see me tearing up a little bit but it was very special,” he said.Shai was invited to start the second quarter of the CFL matchup between the Tiger-Cats and the B.C. Lions, standing once again on the same field he’d been on countless times as a kid, only now, as a global sports icon.Gilgeous-Alexander became only the fourth player in NBA history — alongside Shaquille O’Neal, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Michael Jordan — to win the scoring title, regular season MVP, and Finals MVP in the same year. Leading the Thunder to a tense seven-game championship over the Indiana Pacers, he delivered the franchise its first-ever NBA title.Mayor Horwath summed up the city’s mood: “We’re all very proud of Shai and we stand in awe of his achievements. I think we’re all on Cloud 9 here in the Hammer today.”Off the court, his influence continues to extend. Gilgeous-Alexander recently signed a four-year, $285 million extension with the Thunder, becoming the NBA’s highest-paid player by annual salary. He also took on the role of creative director for Converse Basketball in a reported $15 million-per-year deal, and he graces the cover of NBA 2K26.For a player once cut from his high school team in ninth grade, “For that kid… to get to this moment and get what he kind of dreamt for and worked for, it’s special and not taken for granted. It’s a blessing and I just try to soak up all of the moments.”Also Read: WNBA players targeted in s*x toy incidents reportedly linked to cryptocurrency promoters seeking viral publicity","Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was awarded the key to the city of Hamilton, Canada.
