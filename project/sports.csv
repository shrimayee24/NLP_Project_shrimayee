BJP mocks Rahul after Priyanka gets key role in Assam elections: Will Congress move set stage for new power dynamics?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-mocks-rahul-gandhi-after-priyanka-gandhi-gets-key-role-in-assam-elections-will-congress-move-set-stage-for-new-power-dynamics/articleshow/126353884.cms,"'Make Her PM & See...': Congress MP Endorses Priyanka Gandhi; BJP Takes 'No Faith In Rahul' Dig

Congress dismisses 'Rahul vs Priyanka'



The great Rahul paradox



Priyanka steps forward



Whispers within the chambers



What next?



NEW DELHI: The Congress move to appoint Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as chairperson of the candidate screening committee for the upcoming Assam elections has added to the murmurs of leadership debate within the grand old party, with the BJP-led NDA claiming internal conflict between the Gandhi siblings. Soon after Priyanka's elevation, which was announced on Sunday, the BJP claimed that the Congress was divided between camps of Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi . The Congress, as expected, strongly rejected these claims and slammed the BJP for spreading ""manufactured propaganda.""BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said, ""The Rahul vs Priyanka camp has been going on for a very long time in the Congress party. All the pressure was exerted by the Rahul camp. 'Remove Rahul, bring Priyanka' is happening in Congress. Now even their allies don't trust Rahul Gandhi. Their own leaders don't want him; instead, they want Priyanka Gandhi.""The Janata Dal (United) also reacted to Priyanka's appointment, claiming that Rahul Gandhi's frequent foreign trips had shifted responsibilities to her.""It is expected that legislative assembly elections will be held in five states. The Congress's internal matters are handled by a screening committee.Who will handle this work when Rahul Gandhi is abroad? The responsibility has fallen on Priyanka Gandhi. However, this is their internal matter,"" JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said.The Congress has formally dismissed the NDA's claims, insisting there is no Rahul vs Priyanka camp within the party.On Sunday, the party defended its decision to appoint AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as chairperson of the Assam screening committee, strongly criticising the BJP for attempting to ""propagate"" a false leadership contest narrative.The Congress asserted that this was not the first time Priyanka had been entrusted with such responsibilities, recalling that she had earlier served as an ex-officio member of the screening committee during the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections.Congress MP Tariq Anwar told IANS, ""Earlier, she was the general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh when assembly elections were held there. So we cannot say this is the first time. This is the second time she has been given charge of a state related to elections. She will use her political experience and capability in Assam. There is a strong possibility of a Congress comeback in Assam.""""Priyanka Gandhi has been serving as general secretary for the past five years. She has been given organisational responsibilities from time to time and has worked across the country. Therefore, the notion propagated by the BJP is incorrect,"" he added.Congress leader Udit Raj also defended Priyanka's appointment, citing her ""wide influence and experience"".Speaking to IANS, Raj said, ""She is our leader and has been made chairperson of the Assam screening committee. Her influence is quite wide. She will oversee elections and make selections. She already has experience, and that experience will increase further.""Rahul Gandhi's position within the Congress is currently stronger than it has been at any point since his resignation as party president in 2019. After years of refusing formal office while leading high-visibility foot marches such as the Bharat Jodo Yatra (2022–23) and the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in early 2024, the Lok Sabha election results that year altered the equation.The Congress's improved performance, winning 99 Lok Sabha seats and securing the Leader of the Opposition post, did something the party had struggled to achieve for a decade: it gave Rahul constitutional weight.That momentum, however, was not sustained.Since the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the NDA staged a strong comeback, winning assembly elections in Haryana, Maharashtra, Delhi and Bihar.Rahul Gandhi led campaigns raising the ‘vote chori' charge and spearheaded the Voter Adhikar Yatra in Bihar, hoping to replicate the gains of his earlier mass movements.The narrative failed to resonate electorally, and the Congress emerged as the weakest link in the Bihar opposition, winning only six of the state's 243 assembly seats.At the same time, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has unmistakably moved out of the occasional-campaigner role. Once deployed sparingly for high-voltage rallies, she is now a constant presence, both in Parliament and on the streets.During the Winter Session of Parliament, the first-time MP from Wayanad assumed a leading role for the party. With a smile, she was seen patiently attacking the Modi government during the Vande Mataram debate.The Wayanad MP also was at the forefront when the opposition parties staged a walkout from Lok Sabha to protest against the VB-G RAM G Bill.She led the march within the Parliament premises while holding a photograph of Mahatma Gandhi.Despite Rahul Gandhi's absence from Parliament, the Congress drew significant attention for its aggressive protests and Priyanka emerged as a prominent face of the party both inside and outside the House.At the end of the session, she also attended the customary tea meeting hosted by Speaker Om Birla and was seen chatting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and leaders from across parties.Though there has been no formal resolution, several reports have quoted ""voices within the Congress"" urging a larger organisational role for Priyanka, including suggestions that she could serve as party president or national face.After Rahul's resignation as Congress chief, former MP Abhijit Mukherjee, son of former President Pranab Mukherjee, openly appealed for Priyanka to take over, saying she should heed the ""clarion call of lakhs of Congress workers"".Former Union minister and senior Congress leader Anil Shastri has also said Priyanka Gandhi would be the best person to lead the party.Over time, and following successive assembly election losses, these whispers have grown louder.In December, former Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim wrote to Sonia Gandhi questioning the current leadership and explicitly seeking a ""greater central role"" for Priyanka.MP Imran Masood has also pushed for her elevation, arguing, ""Make her the Prime Minister and see how she responds, just like Indira Gandhi did,"" signalling that she should be the party's main face and de facto leader.Internal conflict or not, the specific role given to Priyanka in Assam elections does give credence to talks of her eventual elevation within the party. It is an important move in a politically sensitive state which the Congress hopes to wrest from the BJP. The Congress would hope that Priyanka's greater involvement in the state elections will help to counter BJP's ‘double-engine government' campaign led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.With the Congress till now projecting Rahul Gandhi as its only face, any greater role for Priyanka cannot be dismissed as a routine organisational decision. The move comes amid wider discussions on leadership, strategy and the future direction of the opposition camp.The final verdict, however, will come from voters, and not from whispers or internal demands. In the 2021 assembly elections, the BJP won 60 seats with 33.6% vote share and the Congress got 29 seats with 30% vote share.What happens in Assam over the next few months, as the state prepares to elect a new government this year, may play a role in shaping the future of the Congress leadership and also the Gandhi siblings.","Congress appoints Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as chairperson of the candidate screening committee for the upcoming Assam elections.

The brilliant career in Major League Baseball was the main factor that created the foundation of Andrew McCutchen’s finances. In 2005, the Pittsburgh Pirates called him up without delay, he threw at the peak of his superstar career, and later, he was awarded five All-Star titles and the National League MVP in 2013. Maria Hanslovan, McCutchen's wife, has set up her own fitness and wellness career which has been a steady income source for the couple and thus, has improved their financial stability.Through 16 seasons in the majors, McCutchen's total money earned from the MLB contracts was about $131.4 million. The highest salary he got was in 2012 when he agreed to a six-year, $51.5 million contract extension with the Pirates, thus making the player the franchise’s mainstay.Later transfers to the San Francisco Giants, Philadelphia Phillies, and Milwaukee Brewers accounted for even more millions, while his signing of a one-year $5 million contract renewal with the Pirates in 2025 is a testament to both his status as a veteran and his continuing worth to the team. Salaries, however, were not the only way, as he was also coming into the picture through endorsement deals by the likes of Nike and Marucci Sports, whose reputation he was in part making as a respected leader and role model.His public persona of being involved in philanthropy and community outreach, among other things, has made him more marketable and has thus provided him with the needed steady income streams even if he stops playing already.Formal fitness certifications play a minor role in Maria's career; the major part is the inspiration drawn from her personal story. Maria has made herself a confidante in the health and wellness area by sharing her training, eating habits, and playful family life. Her power is not restricted to the fitness world. She represents a person who supports McCutchen's cause and, at the same time, flourishes on her own.Collectively, Andrew McCutchen and Maria Hanslovan have $60-$65 million.

Kevin Stefanski — Cleveland Browns

Pete Carroll — Las Vegas Raiders

Jonathan Gannon — Arizona Cardinals

Raheem Morris — Atlanta Falcons





The NFL’s annual Black Monday shakeup is officially underway. Just hours after the regular season wrapped up, teams across the league began making major coaching decisions, signaling resets, rebuilds, and a long offseason of change ahead.With franchises eager to get a head start on the coaching carousel, several head coaches have already been dismissed with more moves potentially coming as ownership groups evaluate disappointing seasons. Here are the list of all coaches that got fired today:The Cleveland Browns fired head coach Kevin Stefanski after six seasons with the organization, ending a tenure that included both highs and prolonged frustration.Despite winning NFL Coach of the Year twice, Stefanski was dismissed following a 5–12 campaign and what team leadership viewed as a lack of sustained progress. Injuries, quarterback instability, and inconsistent results ultimately led the Browns to decide it was time for a new voice.The Las Vegas Raiders fired Pete Carroll after just one season at the helm, marking one of the most abrupt coaching exits of Black Monday.Carroll signed a three-year deal last year, but the experiment unraveled quickly. The Raiders finished 3–14, tied for the worst record in the NFL, prompting ownership to opt for a complete reset.With major questions remaining at quarterback and across the roster, Las Vegas will once again search for a head coach capable of leading a rebuild.The Arizona Cardinals parted ways with head coach Jonathan Gannon after three seasons, following another difficult year for the franchise.Arizona closed the 2025 season with a 3–14 record, extending a stretch of losing seasons and limited progress. Despite efforts to reshape the roster, results never materialized, leading the Cardinals to move in a different direction.The organization now turns its attention to finding a coach who can accelerate development and restore competitiveness.The Atlanta Falcons fired head coach Raheem Morris after back-to-back 8–9 seasons, missing the playoffs in both years.While Atlanta showed flashes of promise, the inability to break through in a competitive NFC ultimately led to Morris’ dismissal. Team leadership reportedly felt the roster was ready to compete at a higher level and required a new approach to reach that goal.Atlanta now joins the growing list of teams entering the coaching carousel.With multiple openings now available, the NFL coaching carousel is officially in motion. Teams will begin requesting interviews with coordinators on playoff staffs, evaluating former head coaches, and exploring college options as they look to make the right hire.More changes could still come in the days ahead as teams continue postseason evaluations.Also read - Fans accuse Cardi B of crossing a line after now-deleted tweet amid Stefon Diggs allegations",The Cleveland Browns fired head coach Kevin Stefanski after six seasons.

Why Jonathan Gannon was let go: Inside the Arizona Cardinals’ coaching change







The Arizona Cardinals have decided to part ways with head coach Jonathan Gannon after three seasons, signaling a major shift for the struggling franchise. Gannon took on his first NFL head coaching job with the Cardinals after a successful run as the Eagles’ defensive coordinator. He was supposed to develop great chemistry with quarterback Kyler Murray , but results fell short, with the Cardinals finishing the 2025 season at a disappointing 3-14. Arizona ’s management decided it was time for a fresh start. Although there was some improvement in 2024, Gannon’s three-year tenure left the Cardinals dead last in the NFC West and near the bottom of league rankings. Injuries, roster challenges, and coaching decisions have contributed to the team struggling over the course of their games.Gannon finishes his Arizona tenure with a combined 15-36 record, never reaching the playoffs. The first season in 2023 saw the end of the campaign with a 4-13 record. The following season in 2024 experienced a slight improvement with a close 8-9 season. However, the following season in 2025 experienced a season with three wins and a sharp decline that observed them losing their last nine matches consecutively after beginning with a season-opening win of 2-0.Gannon joined Arizona on February 14, 2023, in a move that came with controversy.The team was penalized for tampering during the hiring process, resulting in a swap of third-round draft picks with the Eagles and the loss of a 2024 fifth-round pick. Nevertheless, there were lofty hopes considering his success on defense for Philadelphia as well as his potential as a young coach.At 43, Gannon is still relatively young for the coaching ranks in the NFL. While his experience as a head coach was not that successful for the Cardinals, his experience as a defense specialist coach gives them a great reason to consider his services as a coordinator and also possibly bring him back as a head coach.The Cardinals are left with the task of hiring a coach to rebuild the roster, improve the consistency of the team’s play, and establish a long-term vision. The Cardinals’ hiring decision reflects the quick pace of the NFL, where teams must deliver results without delay. When the new NFL season rolls around in the year 2026, the Cardinals will begin the process of searching for the coach to convert promise to success.",Arizona Cardinals have parted ways with head coach Jonathan Gannon after three seasons.

From Bulls colors to college blue how Michael Jordan made sneakers carry legacy?



How Air Jordans became Michael Jordan’s timeless empire?







NBA legend Michael Jordan is often praised for what he did on the basketball court, but his impact goes far beyond championships and iconic on-court moments. Long after his retirement from the big league, Jordan built a business empire that is still looked upon by athletes across all sports. His success was not accidental, rather, it was the result of smart decisions Jordan made early in his career.NBA superstars today earn massive amounts of money through brand endorsements, but Michael Jordan changed the game by thinking like an owner, not just as the face for a brand. According to Rich Paul, founder of Klutch Sports and an agent to LeBron James, Jordan understood something many athletes didn’t at the time, that is, real power comes from royalties and long-term ownership.Speaking on the podcast, Game Over with Max Kellerman and Rich Paul, Paul explained why Michael Jordan’s approach stood apart from everyone else. While most players signed deals, Jordan focused on building something that would last beyond his playing career. He didn’t just promote products, he helped create them. Paul said in the interview about Michael Jordan that, “He built the business and he owned a part of it”.That mindset allowed Jordan to earn huge amounts of money, even decades later. According to Paul, the Air Jordan brand, owned by Michael Jordan, didn’t depend on him playing basketball, it stood on its own.Another key part of Michael Jordan’s financial success was his impressive storytelling. His shoes weren’t just sneakers, they carried meaning with them. The classic red, black, and white colors reflected the Chicago Bulls. Later, the Carolina blue paid tribute to his college days. Fans didn’t just buy shoes, they bought into a story that connected them with Jordan.Many active NBA stars have strong sneaker deals. Players like LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, and Luka Doncic each earn millions through partnerships with some of the world's major brands. But Rich Paul made it clear that Jordan’s model, till today, stands above the rest.Michael Jordan didn’t rely on signing constant new deals. Rather, his brand became a business that could refresh itself by releasing new designs every now and then. So even after releasing 40 signature shoes, Air Jordans still sell out and dominate the sneaker culture worldwide. And that long-term vision is what separates Jordan from everyone else. He didn’t chase quick money. He built something that he knew could grow and survive without having the need for him to be in the spotlight every day.Also Read: Magic Johnson vs Michael Jordan net worth comparison: Exploring NBA veterans' career earnings, off-court ventures and more","NBA legend Michael Jordan is often praised for what he did on the basketball court, but his impact goes far beyond championships and iconic on-court moments.

Kevin Stefanski fired: Browns’ ongoing quarterback chaos leads to coaching change after 5-12 season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/kevin-stefanski-fired-browns-ongoing-quarterback-chaos-leads-to-coaching-change-after-5-12-season/articleshow/126357932.cms,"Browns part ways with Kevin Stefanski amid quarterback struggles (Image via: Getty Images)

The Browns’ quarterback dilemma left Kevin Stefanski with few solutions







The Cleveland Browns’ decision to move on from Kevin Stefanski marks the end of a tenure shaped as much by promise as by persistent instability at quarterback. Since Baker Mayfield left after the 2021 season, the Browns have struggled to find a consistent quarterback, a challenge that marked the final years of Stefanski’s tenure.The breaking point came after a 5-12 finish in the 2025 NFL season, one of the worst records in the league. On Monday, the Browns confirmed Stefanski’s firing, thanking him for his work while making it clear that general manager Andrew Berry will remain in place to oversee the next phase of the rebuild.From the outset, last year felt like a transition year. The Browns expected their defense to keep them competitive, but the offense entered training camp without clarity under center. Cleveland carried four quarterbacks: veteran Joe Flacco, former Steelers first-rounder Kenny Pickett, and rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders. Pickett was moved before the season, leaving Flacco as the Week 1 starter by default.Flacco struggled in four starts, throwing six interceptions against two touchdowns before being traded to the Cincinnati Bengals, where he revived his season. With Flacco gone, the Browns turned to Gabriel, whose play showed effort but little consistency.Stefanski’s reluctance to hand the offense to Sanders, despite the rookie’s draft-day slide and high profile, became a talking point as losses piled up.A concussion to Gabriel finally opened the door for Sanders. He flashed potential, most notably with a three-touchdown performance against the Titans, but wins never followed. With the season effectively lost, the organization decided a coaching change was necessary.Stefanski’s dismissal cannot be separated from the long shadow of the Deshaun Watson trade. Deshaun Watson’s $230 million fully guaranteed contract, combined with inconsistent play, left the Browns with few reliable options. Many seasons have passed, during which the Browns have had multiple backup QBs, which has made it tough for Stefanski on the offense.Despite these challenges, Stefanski guided the Browns to two playoff appearances, including an impressive 11-5 debut season and a surprise 2023 run boosted by Flacco’s late-season resurgence. His .440 winning percentage is certainly the best in the past several decades as a coach of the Cleveland Browns.As the Browns search for their next head coach, the franchise faces familiar questions. Cleveland must decide whether Gabriel or Sanders can become a long-term solution, and whether the next coach can finally bring stability where it has been missing for far too long.Also Read: Cam Newton claims ""Kevin Stefanski doesn't want Shedeur Sanders to succeed"" as his rough NFL debut sparks heated debate within Cleveland Browns","Cleveland Browns part ways with head coach Kevin Stefanski.

LeBron James is the ultimate dual-threat



LeBron James’ 50,000-point longevity







Every Lakers' game with LeBron James feels like a brush with history, but Sunday night against Memphis Grizzlies, the air in the Crypto.com Arena just felt different. The 41-year-old hasn’t just been defying the stereotypes but also put up a veteran performance that took over the record books. In the second half with a clinical pass, LeBron James officially moved into 2nd place all-time in total assists (combining regular season and playoffs), passing Chris Paul.Combined with his existing throne as the NBA ’s all-time leading scorer, LeBron is now the first and only player in the history of the sport to be 1st in points and 2nd in assists. For those who have followed him since the Chosen One cover in 2002, this isn't just a stat, it's a reflection of greatness unfolding in real time.LeBron James is not filling space on the court. From rebounding, scoring, and assisting his teammates on the court to cheering from the courtside, James makes sure he’s there through and through. Scoring points requires a single focus on the rim, but assisting requires the opposite: an unselfish and eagle-eyed vision to know who’s where.During the Lakers' 120–114 victory, LeBron ran back and forth on the hardwood for 37 minutes and scored 26 points and 10 assists along with 7 rebounds, 2 three-pointers, and 6 field goals.With 10 assists, he brought his career total to 13,793 assists, Chris Paul. The only target who’s left on the list is now the legendary John Stockton at #1.This is LeBron’s 23rd NBA season, the first player to record such a long career on the rectangle, yet he doesn’t seem to be stopping. Guiding a roster filled with superstars like Luka Doncic and Austin Reeves, James is doing much more than player responsibilities.LeBron James officially surpassed the 50,000 total career points mark (regular season plus playoffs) in March 2025. He told Spectrum SportsNet in the on-court interview, ""It's a hell of a lot of points, and I'm super blessed to be able to put that many points up in the best league in the world with the best players in the world over my career. It's pretty special.""Every accolade and achievement makes sense when the King continues to show why he is the 21-time All-Star.

NEW DELHI: India were set a target of 246 after South Africa Under-19 were bowled out for 245, but the chase quickly became about one name. Vaibhav Sooryavanshi, leading the side, walked out to open and immediately took control, lighting up the contest with a breathtaking start.The 14-year-old tore into the bowling from the outset, racing to 68 off just 24 balls. His innings was built on clean, fearless hitting, with ten sixes and a four clearing the ropes with ease. Vaibhav brought up his half-century in just 19 deliveries, giving India Under-19 exactly the momentum they were looking for at the top of the order. He shared a 67-run opening stand with Aaron George, who made 20 before falling early in the chase.Earlier in the day, South Africa Under-19 had opted to bat first. Jorich van Schalkwyk and Adnaan Lagadien began the innings, contributing 10 and 25 respectively, but neither was able to convert their start. Captain Muhammed Bulbulia also failed to settle, departing for 14 as wickets fell at regular intervals.The visitors found stability through Jason Rowles, who played the standout innings of the first innings.Rowles scored a composed 114 from 113 balls, anchoring the batting effort when the side needed it most. He received some support from Daniel Bosman, who added 31 off 63 deliveries, but South Africa struggled to build partnerships around them and was eventually dismissed for 245.India’s bowlers shared the workload effectively, with Kishan Singh leading the attack. He delivered a strong spell of 8.3 overs, picking up four wickets while conceding 46 runs. RS Ambrish chipped in with two wickets, while Deepesh Devendran, Kanishk Chouhan, and Khilan Patel claimed one each to ensure South Africa never fully broke free.Vaibhav’s explosive innings once again underlined his reputation as one of the most exciting batters at this level. Last year, he set a benchmark by scoring the fastest hundred in Under-19 cricket, reaching the milestone off just 52 balls against England in Worcester.The match, however, was interrupted multiple times due to bad lightning, and India’s innings was reduced to just 27 overs under the DLS method, while South Africa had batted their full 50 overs. India U19 completed the chase in 23.2 overs, scoring 176 for 2 and winning by 8 wickets. Vedant Trivedi contributed an unbeaten 31 off 57 balls, while Abhigyan Kundu remained not out on 48 from 42 deliveries, guiding India safely home.The ongoing three-match ODI series against South Africa is serving as preparation for the Under-19 World Cup, which begins on January 15 across Zimbabwe and Namibia.",India Under-19s beat South Africa U19s by eight wickets.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit





Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting has expressed his confidence in out-of-form India skipper Suryakumar Yadav ahead of the T20 World Cup, which is set to begin on February 7. Despite a rough run in 2025, where Yadav has scored just 218 runs in 19 innings at a strike rate of 123.16, Ponting urged the Indian batter to trust his natural game and maintain his aggressive approach.“That's as big a surprise for me, just looking at his recent form. He's been such a solid and consistent contributor for India in T20 cricket for a long time and just hasn't been able to find it of late,” Ponting told ICC. He added, “He's an interesting one because when I've seen him play his best, he's taken six or eight or 10 balls to get going and then just lets it all go.”Ponting highlighted Yadav’s fearless style, comparing him to Australia’s Travis Head. “He plays all of his shots and backs himself, and a bit like Travis Head, where it almost looks like they don't ever fear getting out,” he said. “That's what I'd say to him. I'd be saying, think about scoring runs, don't think about getting out. Trust yourself, back yourself. You're proven to be as good as anybody in the world in the T20 format and go and prove it to everybody once again. ”The former Aussie great also praised India’s decision to appoint 31-year-old Axar Patel as vice-captain for the T20 World Cup. Ponting lauded Patel’s versatility, noting, “I mean, actually, Patel's been their go-to man, really hasn't he? The last few series, he's been their pinch hitter at different times.They've batted him up the order at number three. When they've needed that left-hand, right-hand combination, he's been the man to go out and try and do it for them, and he's obviously ever consistent with his left-arm off spin as well. ”Ponting admitted he was surprised by the exclusion of India ODI and Test captain Shubman Gill from the T20 squad. Gill, who has struggled in recent white-ball cricket, has 291 runs in 15 innings with a highest score of 47. “Yeah, I couldn't believe that,” Ponting said during an appearance on The ICC Review with host Sanjana Ganesan. He added, “I know his recent form hasn't been great in white-ball cricket. And the last time that I really saw much of him play was the Test series against England in the UK, where he batted as well as I've ever seen anybody bat. ”Despite his surprise, Ponting praised India’s batting depth, suggesting that leaving Gill out reflects the strength of the squad. “I mean one, I'm surprised, but two, it just shows the depth of Indian cricket,” he explained. “If you can think that someone as good as Shubman Gill doesn't get picked in a World Cup squad, then it goes to show how many good players they do have.”Ponting’s comments underline his belief that while individual form can fluctuate, backing one’s instincts and leveraging team depth remain key in high-pressure tournaments like the T20 World Cup.",Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting has expressed his confidence in out-of- form India skipper Suryakumar Yadav.

India ODI squad review | Iyer returns, Pant gets the nod, Shami misses out again





NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh has backed the decision to appoint Shubman Gill as the new ODI captain, saying the star opener looks “ready for big challenges”. He also said Gill will get more opportunities in the T20I format after being left out of the T20 World Cup squad, despite a brief stint as the team’s vice-captain.Gill, who lost his first ODI series as captain against Australia away from home, is now gearing up for his maiden ODI series at home, against New Zealand, starting January 11. While the hard-fought 2-2 draw against England in the UK and his tally of 754 runs, including four centuries, remain the highlights of his short tenure as Test captain, he is yet to make a significant impact as both a batter and leader in ODIs.In T20Is too, Gill failed to meet expectations after returning as vice-captain during the Asia Cup, managing just 291 runs in his last 15 innings without registering a fifty since his comeback.Speaking to ANI about Gill’s return to ODIs following a neck injury sustained during the South Africa Tests and his omission from the T20 World Cup squad, Harbhajan said, “Gill was bound to make a comeback. I had no doubt that there was any question about Shubman's return. I think Shubman Gill was left out solely because of the T20 format and the combination Team India wanted. Otherwise, I never had any doubt that he would not be in the ODI or Test team.So, he has returned as captain. I hope the team plays well, and this series will also be won by India.”Harbhajan termed the T20 World Cup squad selected by chief selector Ajit Agarkar as a “10/10 team” and said that while he felt disappointed for Gill, the opener would get his chances soon.“The team is really good. I had told that Ajit should be given 10/10 for the team. I felt a little bad for Shubman, but he will get more chances soon. All the players are match winners in their own right. Hope we can win back-to-back World Cups because we have that team,” he said.Justifying the decision to appoint Gill as ODI captain, Harbhajan said it was taken with an eye on the future and added that he believes Gill is ready for the responsibility.“I think the decision has been taken keeping the future in mind. Sometimes you do feel things have been done quickly. But I think he is ready for this job. This is a high-demand job; he is young. The sooner he learns the art of captaincy and team management, the better the results will be. That England Test series was one of the finest I have ever seen. Scoring so many runs and leading from the front shows that he has worked harder than anybody else. Whatever I know of Shubman, he is ready for big challenges,” he added.Harbhajan also praised India’s “match-winning” spin trio of Varun Chakravarthy, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav selected for the T20 World Cup.“Spin is nice for India. Kuldeep, Varun and Axar are all spinners and can win you the match in one spell. Players are still not able to decipher Varun. Kuldeep has that variation. This is a nice combination of spinners, hope they stay injury-free and serve India for a long time,” he said.He further backed skipper Suryakumar Yadav, despite his modest returns of 218 runs in 19 innings last year at an average of 13.62 without a fifty, to deliver in a crucial T20 World Cup game.“Suryakumar has not made many runs, but when the WC comes, we will need big players to fire. He will shine bright in that big match. Abhishek (Sharma) can win you matches on your own. The form Hardik (Pandya) is in, he is a key player.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'





NEW DELHI: Serbian great Novak Djokovic on Tuesday withdrew from the Adelaide International, saying he was “not quite physically ready” as he continues his build-up to the Australian Open.The 38-year-old had planned to use the tournament, scheduled to begin on January 12, as a warm-up for the season’s first Grand Slam at Melbourne Park, where he is chasing a record-extending 11th Australian Open title and an elusive 25th major crown.“To all my fans in Adelaide, unfortunately I'm not quite physically ready to compete in the Adelaide International next week,” Djokovic said on Instagram.“It's personally very disappointing to me, as I have such great memories of winning the title there two years ago. I was really excited about returning as it truly felt like playing at home.“My focus is now on my preparation for the Australian Open and I look forward to arriving in Melbourne soon and seeing all the tennis fans in Australia.”The world No. 4 has not played a tour-level match since defeating Lorenzo Musetti in the Athens final in early November.Djokovic has had to play a secondary role on the men’s tour after Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz emerged as the dominant forces. Although he reached the semifinals at all four Grand Slams in 2025, he was unable to progress further, with his most recent major title coming at the US Open in 2023.His withdrawal from Adelaide came a day after he announced he would cut ties with the Professional Tennis Players Association, an organisation he co-founded.Djokovic cited “concerns regarding transparency, governance, and the way my voice and image have been represented”.",Novak Djokovic withdraws from the Adelaide International.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

Poll What aspect of Vaibhav's performance impressed you the most? His Fast Scoring The Number of Sixes His Captaincy





NEW DELHI: Teenage sensation Vaibhav Sooryavanshi produced a breathtaking display of power-hitting to script a memorable win for India Under-19, smashing Rishabh Pant's long-standing record for the fastest fifty in a Youth ODI and powering his side to an eight-wicket victory over South Africa Under-19 in Benoni on Monday.Chasing a target of 246 at Willowmoore Park, the 14-year-old opener blasted a stunning 15-ball fifty, eclipsing Pant's 18-ball effort set during the 2016 Under-19 World Cup against Nepal in Dhaka. Although rain later intervened and revised India's target to 174 from 27 overs under the DLS method, Sooryavanshi's explosive start had already tilted the contest decisively in the visitors' favour.Leading from the front, the India U-19 skipper was eventually dismissed for a sensational 68 off just 24 balls, an innings studded with 10 sixes and one four. His fearless knock ensured India chased down the revised target in just 23.3 overs, winning with 21 balls to spare and sealing the three-match series 2-0, with one game still to play.Sooryavanshi's innings added another chapter to his growing reputation. The prodigious talent already holds the record for the fastest Under-19 hundred, having blasted a 52-ball century against England in Worcester last year.With the Under-19 World Cup set to begin on January 15 in Zimbabwe and Namibia, the timing of his form surge could not be better for India.Earlier, South Africa Under-19, after opting to bat, were bowled out for 245 in 49.3 overs. Jason Rowles anchored the innings with a fine 114 off 113 balls, sharing a 97-run stand with Daniel Bosman (31), but the hosts struggled to maintain momentum thereafter.India's bowlers kept things in check, led by Kishan Singh's 4/46, while RS Ambrish chipped in with two wickets. In reply, India's openers came out all guns blazing, racing to 50 in just over four overs before Sooryavanshi's blitz effectively ended the contest.","India Under-19 captain Vaibhav Sooryavanshi smashes fastest fifty in Youth ODI. 14-year-old crushes 68 off just 24 balls, studded with 10 sixes and one four.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit





DHAKA: The interim government led by Professor Muhammad Yunus on Monday decided to ban the broadcast of the upcoming Indian Premier League ( IPL ) season, scheduled to begin on March 26.Bangladesh’s ministry of information and broadcasting conveyed the decision, further intensifying tensions between the two countries and introducing politics into sport, often regarded as a form of soft power in diplomacy.A notification was sent to state-run Bangladesh Betar and television channels instructing chief executives as well as the president of the Association of Television Channel Owners to immediately stop broadcasting all IPL matches and related programmes until further notice.The notification noted that no reasonable explanation had been provided for the exclusion of Bangladesh star pacer Mustafizur Rahman , a decision that left the people of Bangladesh “saddened and angry”.“In this context, a decision has been taken regarding the broadcast of IPL matches,” the notification said. Information and broadcasting adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan on Sunday said any decision on whether to stop broadcasting Indian Premier League (IPL) in Bangladesh would be taken after reviewing the legal basis and thoroughly examining the relevant procedures.The ministry said the directive by the BCCI to have Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur released from the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) squad for the upcoming IPL had come to the government’s attention.Earlier, in a retaliation following star bowler Mustafizur’s exclusion, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on Sunday decided not to send the national cricket team to India for the upcoming T20 World Cup, seeking alternative venue from the ICC outside India citing security concerns “under the current circumstances”.The T20 World Cup, set to be played in India and Sri Lanka, will begin on Feb 7.The decision was taken in an emergency meeting held on Monday afternoon.","Bangladesh ban the broadcast of the upcoming Indian Premier League ( IPL ) season, scheduled to begin on March 26.

Aaron Rodgers acknowledges the weight of the last three seasons after Steelers clinch the playoffs

Why Rodgers’ Steelers run has changed the retirement conversation

The Ravens’ collapse pushed Rodgers forward while Baltimore looked back

What comes next for Aaron Rodgers and the Steelers





Aaron Rodgers finally made it back to the playoffs. The reaction afterward was not celebration first. It was reflection.After the Pittsburgh Steelers clinched a postseason berth with a 26-24 win over the Baltimore Ravens on Jan. 4, Rodgers addressed retirement questions head-on during his on-field interview with NBC. The 42-year-old did not announce a decision. But his words, tone, and body language told a clearer story than a yes or no ever could.Rodgers did not dodge the moment when NBC sideline reporter Melissa Stark asked about his future. He paused. He exhaled. Then he spoke plainly.“It’s pretty emotional, honestly,” Rodgers said. “It’s been a great year. I’m thankful for these guys and I’m excited to be going to the playoffs for the first time in a long while.”Stark followed up, asking whether the moment felt like a goodbye. Rodgers shut that down quickly, but not casually.“No, I’m just, it’s been a grinding year,” Rodgers said. “And the two years before that were tough as well.” That context matters. Rodgers suffered a season-ending Achilles injury in Week 1 of the 2023 season with the New York Jets.He followed that with a 5-12 record as a starter in 2024. Pittsburgh represented a reset. It also represented his last clear path back to relevance.Rodgers did not speak like someone closing a chapter. He spoke like someone who survived one.“So it’s been an absolute blessing to be here with these fans and this organization and Mike Tomlin and the leadership that we’ve got with these guys,” Rodgers said.The Steelers finished the regular season 10-7 and won the AFC North. Rodgers threw for 294 yards, one touchdown, and zero interceptions against Baltimore. He completed 31 of 47 passes. He directed two fourth-quarter touchdown drives in a game that flipped momentum repeatedly in the final nine minutes.The defining throw came with 55 seconds left. Rodgers hit Calvin Austin III for a 26-yard touchdown. Chris Boswell missed the extra point, keeping the game at 26-24 and opening the door for Baltimore.That door closed seconds later when Ravens kicker Tyler Loop missed a potential game-winning field goal as time expired.Baltimore had chances. It also had a season full of familiar mistakes. The Ravens’ final drive only existed because of blown coverages and missed assignments earlier in the fourth quarter. Tyler Loop’s miss sealed a season defined by injuries, turnovers, and lost leads. Lamar Jackson acknowledged that frustration afterward.“Through the roof,” Jackson said. “I felt like Thanksgiving game, we shouldn’t have lost that game- turnovers, unfortunately. This one here, I don’t know what happened.”The loss eliminated Baltimore from playoff contention and handed Pittsburgh the division. It also extended Rodgers’ season and delayed the retirement conversation by at least one week.Rodgers is under contract through the end of the season. His future beyond that remains unresolved. What is clear is that the playoff run has changed the tone around his career.“I think we found that little bit of something special, which is belief, tonight on the offensive side,” Rodgers said. “And I’m proud of our guys with the way we responded in the fourth quarter.”The Steelers will face the Houston Texans in the Wild Card round on Monday at 8:15 p.m. Eastern. Pittsburgh will also get D.K. Metcalf back from suspension for that matchup.Rodgers has not said this is the end. He has also not promised it is not. But quarterbacks who are ready to walk away do not talk about belief. They do not talk about response. And they do not sound this present in the moment. For now, Rodgers is still playing. And after everything that came before Pittsburgh, that alone says plenty.","Aaron Rodgers addressed retirement questions head-on during his on-field interview with NBC.

Tom Brady’s ‘IYKYK’ watch flex landed right after his Lions-Bears broadcast

Alix Earle’s family TikTok joke added fuel to the St. Barths talk





Tom Brady posted a close-up of his wrist on Instagram over the weekend, and he made the caption do the talking. The retired quarterback wrote, “IYKYK,” as he showed off an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar that was reported to be worth about $482,985.Hours later, the Alix Earle dating chatter got fresh oxygen from her own family circle. Her stepmom posted a TikTok that included a joke from her father, and the timing did Brady no favors as New Year’s Eve clips in St. Barths kept circulating.Brady’s Instagram story drew attention because the watch was not subtle. Ankita Yadav reported the piece was an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar, valued around $482,985, with a ceramic case, a blue dial under sapphire crystal, and a blue ceramic strap.The post hit right after Brady worked as a FOX Sports broadcaster during the Detroit Lions vs. Chicago Bears game. He also made headlines for a tight end comparison during that broadcast. Brady called Bears rookie Colston Loveland “a little mini Gronk,” referencing former Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end Rob Gronkowski. Chicago lost 19-16.Brady also posted a longer New Year’s message last week, and he did it in the same reflective tone he tends to use when he is not talking football.He wrote, ""Happy new year to you all… For me, The end of the year always helps to put things into perspective. Growth doesn’t really happen unless you’re willing to challenge yourself physically, mentally, and emotionally. That’s something I try to live by and keep coming back to as I learn more with each passing year,"" while sharing photos that included his kids.On Monday, Jan. 5, Jackie Longo reported that Earle’s stepmother, Ashley Earle, posted a TikTok while getting ready in a blue velvet blazer that belonged to her husband, Thomas “TJ” Earle. TJ leaned into the Brady buzz in the clip. He said, “I actually got that jacket because I saw Tom Brady wearing one like that,” and when Ashley pressed him, he doubled down with, “I swear to God,"" then Ashley told him she was not “cutting” the comment out.The jokes landed because the original rumor wave already had video behind it. Longo reported that a video obtained by “TMZ” showed Earle rubbing Brady’s back and whispering in his ear at a St. Barths nightclub on New Year’s Eve. Longo also cited a source speaking to ""Us Weekly"" who claimed, “Alix and Tom were together the entire night on New Year’s Eve partying at a party hosted by Palm Tree Crew in St. Barths,” and added, “They met through mutual friends who were also in St. Barths and had an instant connection. There was a lot of chemistry between them.”That same source also tried to lower the temperature, saying, ""It’s nothing serious between her and Tom,” and, “They were together laughing, dancing and partying, enjoying themselves.” Longo noted Earle recently split from Houston Texans wide receiver Braxton Berrios and reported she is not looking for anything serious right now.Earle did not directly address Brady by name in her own post, but she did nod at the moment online. She wrote, ""Rumor has it we're still dancing,"" and added, ""new friends, new memories, and new beginnings to start of the new year :) words can't describe how amazing this trip was.""","Tom Brady posted a close-up of his wrist on Instagram over the weekend.

The James family blueprint beyond basketball







The NBA tunnel has long served as the league's premiere runway, but the pre-game walk for the January 4th matchup against the Memphis Grizzlies featured a consultant more exclusive than any high-fashion house. LeBron James arrived at the arena sporting a look curated entirely by his nine-year-old daughter, Zhuri Nova Ann Marie James.While the 4-time NBA MVP usually opts for sharp tailoring or high-end designer pieces, this Sunday was about a different kind of flex: the dad flex. James has always been a proud father and is a constant source of support for his three kids, without ever letting his legendary stature overshadow their freedom.The outfit Zhuri selected for LeBron was a perfect blend of cool dad aesthetics and elevated streetwear. The centerpiece was a dark blue and beige varsity jacket that gave off a timeless, collegiate vibe, paired effortlessly with light-washed denim jeans. To round out the look, she chose a pair of dark brown Nike sneakers, a chunky white beanie for that classic winter-in-the-city feel, and round gold-framed eyeglasses that added a touch of sophistication.James proudly showcased the ensemble on his Instagram story, captioning it, ""Styled by Zhuri James... My princess took care of me,"" a move that immediately set social media ablaze and reminded fans that even a global icon answers to his daughter.A game before this, James debuted a striking Tiffany Blue colorway of his signature Nike LeBron 23s. First, his own signature line, and then wearing his daughter’s curated outfit for him, highlights that LeBron James is as much of a competitor as he is a family man.Despite the immense pressure of LeBron’s 23rd season and the historic spotlight of playing alongside his son, Bronny, the family has managed to maintain a remarkably grounded and playful atmosphere. Whether it is courtside coaching from Zhuri or the visible support from Savannah, the family operates as a single unit.The bond isn't just for the cameras, it is the foundation that has allowed James to maintain his elite standing in the league for over two decades. Having a home life where a nine-year-old can confidently direct a billionaire athlete’s wardrobe is the ultimate sign of a healthy, joyful dynamic.Also read: LeBron James breaks yet another historic record in Lakers’ win over Grizzlies","LeBron James' daughter, Zhuri, curated his pre-game outfit for the Lakers game against the Memphis Grizzlies.

Why John “Swifty” was banned from Twitch after food delivery streams





John “Swifty” is a well-known World of Warcraft streamer and YouTuber. He has been part of the streaming world for more than a decade. Many fans know him for his WoW PvP gameplay and calm, friendly talk on stream. Swifty created his Twitch channel in 2011 and later became a partnered creator on Twitch, which is owned by Amazon. Over the years, he built a loyal audience. On YouTube, he has more than 670,000 subscribers.In late December 2025, something changed. Swifty started doing real-life “food delivery” streams. These streams showed him delivering food while talking to viewers. He said he started this because January and February are slow months for ad money. On December 27, 2025, these streams became a regular part of his content. Viewers liked it, and the numbers grew fast. But on January 5, 2026, his Twitch channel was permanently banned.The ban shocked many fans because Swifty said this was his first ban in 14 years of streaming. Soon after, his channel showed a message saying it was unavailable due to a violation of Twitch’s Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. Twitch has not shared a public reason beyond that message.In a two-minute video shared on X, John Swifty explained what happened in his own words. He said he believed food delivery streams were allowed because other creators were doing similar content.“Today, I was streaming food delivery. I’ve been doing it for the past week on Twitch, really enjoying it. It’s been amazing. I’ve been doing it to make ends meet in the months of January and February because those are the worst ad revenue months of the year, so I do it in combination with streaming…”Swifty said the streams started doing even better than his gaming content.“It was working out too. I started to get a lot of viewers. I was actually getting more viewers doing food delivery than I was playing World of Warcraft, so I thought it was the greatest thing ever. I had so much fun doing it.”Then came the moment everything stopped.“I saw other people doing food delivery on Twitch so I thought it was fine. I was streaming today and one of my mods, Ava, she called me on the phone, she says, ‘Your channel is gone.’… My channel is perma-banned.”He called the ban shocking, especially after so many years without issues. Swifty also shared that streaming is his only income. His wife is currently caring for their two-week-old baby. Because of this, he started a GoFundMe to help cover living costs and baby supplies while he appeals the ban and looks for other options.At the time of writing, Swifty says he plans to fight the suspension and has filed an appeal. Twitch has not released a separate statement about his case. In other Twitch news, the platform recently faced criticism after unbanning streamer Nina Lin again, which restarted debates about how rules are applied.Also Read: From Kai Cenat To VTubers, The Top 7 List Of The Biggest Twitch Records","John “Swifty’ is a well-known World of Warcraft streamer and YouTuber.

Derek Jeter’s career fortune, salary, and business ventures

Hannah Davis’s modelling career glimpses and the net worth of the duo





The wealth story of Derek Jeter starts with the gaming diamond, with his mythical career of 20 years with the New York Yankees, from which he gained approximately $265 million in salary alone. Hannah Davis, his partner, started doing modeling when she was just a teenager after IMG Models signed her up. Davis's initial big break was with Ralph Lauren, who appointed her as the face of the fragrance Ralph Rocks.Derek Jeter made money out of endorsements with Nike, Gatorade, and Rawlings and added $150 million to his empire along the way. His clutch performer and five-time World Series champion status not only defended the marketability but also made him one of the most bankable stars in baseball. Derek's retirement in 2014 signaled the end of an era but the beginning of new adventures in his life as he moved into the world of ownership and management.His most publicized turn was the appointment as the Marlins’ chief executive officer and part-owner, which not only exhibited his ambition to influence baseball from the front office but also got him very much involved in the decision-making. However, he finally left in 2022, although the initiative highlighted his capability of generating different sources of income not only through playing.Recently, Jeter has been moving into the media and business fabrics more with dealings like BetMGM partnerships and regular spots on Fox Sports broadcasting. All these activities, besides keeping his brand alive and making it profitable, are also proof that he is still as financially savvy as he was with his on-field business instincts.Hannah had a short period with the famous fashion label Victoria's Secret, mainly through being the model in various catalogs and advertisements that highlighted her different skills and beauty. Hannah Davis's ascent to fame was further bolstered by her partnerships with both the high-end and mass-market brands like Levi's, Tommy Hilfiger, and American Eagle. She was not only involved in high-fashion campaigns but also worked on the branding of the more affordable and trendy lifestyle categories.Davis’s talent to quickly switch from an editorial shoot to commercial work was the reason why she became the most popular model among the big names in the modeling industry. The net worth of the duo is estimated to be $210 million.Also Read: Exploring $200,000,000 net worth of Hall of Famer Derek Jeter","Derek Jeter made money out of endorsements with Nike, Gatorade, and Rawlings and added $150 million to his empire along the way.
