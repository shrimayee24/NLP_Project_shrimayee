‘In memory of our brothers’: Russian Pilot's Heartfelt Note For Indian Tejas Pilot After Dubai Crash

Also read |

NEW DELHI: Wing Commander Namansh Syal of the Indian Air Force was honoured with a ‘Missing Man’ manoeuvre by the Russian Knights aerobatics team after he was killed in a Tejas fighter jet crash at the Dubai Air Show on Friday.After the crash of the Indian Tejas fighter jet, the Russian Knights released a video of their performance at the Dubai Airshow 2025, paying tribute to the pilot and honouring the lives lost.In the video, shared on Russian social media platform VK, the team described the crash as “impossible to describe” and said their final-day performance was dedicated to the “memory of the brothers who did not return from the last flight”.At the air show, members of the US F-16 team also reacted strongly to the tragedy. Their pilot, Captain Taylor Hiester, said he was shocked that the event continued despite the fatal accident. The US team, along with a few others, chose to cancel their performance out of respect for the Indian pilot, his colleagues and his family.“After two years of doing this job, that was a first for our team and it came just before our final performance of the season.Together and individually, we all quietly watched the aftermath unfold from a distance thinking about the Indian maintenance crew standing on the ramp next to an empty parking spot, aircraft ladder laid on the ground, the pilot's belongings still in his rental car,” Hiester wrote as he headed back to the US.The Tejas aircraft was in the middle of an eight-minute aerobatic display when it suddenly lost altitude during what appeared to be a low-level manoeuvre. Visuals aired across several channels showed the jet diving toward the ground before erupting into flames, sending thick black smoke over Al Maktoum International Airport. Spectators, including families with children, watched in shock as emergency teams rushed to the scene.","Wing Commander Namansh Syal of the Indian Air Force was honoured with a ‘Missing Man’ manoeuvre by the Russian Knights aerobatics team.

GURGAON: A seven-year-old boy playing outside his house with his father was crushed to death by a car being driven by a teenager in Maruti Kunj on Friday evening.Witnesses recalled the sudden roar of a Maruti SX4 as it sped down the narrow lane and crashed into Yohan, a Class II student. The boy was dragged for almost 20 metres on the bonnet of the car before the 15-year-old driver slammed the brakes.“It all happened in a flash. The car was going too fast for a lane as narrow as this. We heard a loud thud and rushed out to see what had happened,” said a local resident.Yohan was the only son of Ashwani Kumar, a building materials supplier and his schoolteacher wife.Residents gathered at the scene, pulled the underage driver out of the vehicle and informed police. Yohan’s family rushed him to Artemis Hospital, but he had succumbed to injuries by then.The incident left the neighbourhood shocked. “Our children play here every day. We never imagined something like this could happen right at our doorstep,” said a neighbour.An FIR was registered at Bhondsi police station under sections 106 (causing death by negligence) and 281 (rash driving) of BNS. Preliminary probe revealed that the car was not registered in the name of the minor’s father, who works for a private company.“We are trying to find out the actual owner of the car,” said an officer, adding that the vehicle could have been recently purchased second hand without updating registration records.","Yohan was dragged for almost 20 metres on the bonnet of the car before the 15-year-old driver slammed the brakes.

Shubman Gill ruled out of South Africa ODIs; three captaincy candidates emerge

TimesofIndia.com

Poll How do you feel about KL Rahul being appointed as the captain for the upcoming ODI series against South Africa? Excited Indifferent Concerned Disappointed

India’s ODI squad:

India have announced their squad for the three ODIs against South Africa, and as expected, KL Rahul will lead the side in the series starting November 30.In a notable development, Axar Patel has not been included, while Ravindra Jadeja returns to the ODI mix after being dropped for the series against Australia. The other surprising omission from the squad is Varun Chakravarthy, who was India’s trump card in the Champions Trophy.Ashad first reported on November 22 , regular captain Shubman Gill wasn’t available due to a neck injury, Hardik Pandya is yet to regain match fitness, and Jasprit Bumrah has been rested for the series. Tilak Varma’s addition to the middle order is a sign of things to come, as the team management is keen to inject more left-handers into the middle order.India have had a very right-hand–dominated ODI batting order, and in the build-up to the 2027 ODI World Cup, different combinations will be tried. Tilak and Rishabh Pant could get their chances in the upcoming fixtures, as Shreyas Iyer’s injury allows the think tank to explore all options before the vice-captain regains match fitness.The biggest talking point, however, remains Jadeja over Axar Patel. Not too long ago, the men’s senior selection committee led by Ajit Agarkar had ignored Jadeja for the ODI series in Australia.Agarkar had explained why there was no need for an extra left-arm spinner and clearly indicated that Axar was ahead of Jadeja in the format.“He is very much in the plans. But there will be some competition for places. Of course, he was there in the Champions Trophy squad because we took those extra spinners with the conditions there. At the moment, we could only carry one and get some balance in the team with Washi and Kuldeep there as well. And I don’t think we are going to need more than that in Australia,” Agarkar had said.Axar picked up three wickets in as many games and made contributions of 31 and 44 in the two opportunities with the bat but didn’t make the 15-member squad for the three games against South Africa.Veteran speedster Mohammed Shami continues to be ignored, even after proving his match fitness in the domestic circuit, as selectors have stuck with the likes of Harshit Rana, Prasidh Krishna and Arshdeep Singh. Mohammed Siraj also seems to have been rested for the series.Rohit Sharma, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli, Tilak Varma, KL Rahul (C) (wk), Rishabh Pant (wk), Washington Sundar, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Harshit Rana, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Prasidh Krishna, Arshdeep Singh, Dhruv Jurel","India have announced their squad for the three ODIs against South Africa.

IAF Officer Namansh Syal Flown Back to India After Tejas Jet Crash in Dubai Air Show

'It was uncomfortable for me'





Captain Taylor Hiester, a pilot of the US F-16 team who was at the Dubai Air Show where a Tejas fighter jet crashed, killing Wing Commander Namansh Syal, expressed his disbelief and shock that the show was not cancelled even after the tragic event. Hiester said their team was preparing their show when the accident took place. The event was not called off despite the tragedy but the US team and a few other decided to cancel their performance out of respect to the pilot and his colleagues and family.As he headed to the US, he shared his emotions which were a mix of shock and discomfort as he also slammed the organisers for going on with the show.""After two years of doing this job, that was a first for our team and it came just before our final performance of the season. Together and individually, we all quietly watched the aftermath unfold from a distance thinking about the Indian maintenance crew standing on the ramp next to an empty parking spot, aircraft ladder laid on the ground, the pilot's belongings still in his rental car,"" Hiester wrote.Hiester recounted that after the fire was put out, the organisers notified the participants that the display would continue. Their team left but he returned to the site an hour or two later hoping that he would find an empty space.But to his disappointment, the announcer was still enthusiastic and people were watching the show.Hiester said the moment was uncomfortable for him as he imagined his team walking out of the show without him and other participants preparing for their performance. ""I was shaken awake by this truth -- despite whatever guise, whatever 'rockstar treatment', fancy dinners and sponsor chlets, my team who became my family is all I ever had in the first place.""Questioning the concept of 'the show must go on', Hiester said it is true that the show must go on but everyone should remember that the show will go one when they are gone too.","US F-16 pilot Taylor Hiester was at the Dubai Air Show where a Tejas fighter jet crashed, killing Wing Commander Namansh Syal.

parasocial

The performance of being real

'I screamed like my best friend got engaged': The Swiftie syndrome



It is a 'delicate' 'love story'.

When your hero wins, you win too

It's a messy love affair.

Concerts: When the screen comes alive

Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, Maroon 5 and Akon perform in India!

The expense of a parasocial.

The grief of losing someone who never knew you

The parasocial economy: When intimacy becomes a currency

We’re all parasocial

So is this good or bad?

The final truth

In 2025,became the Cambridge Dictionary’s Word of the Year — and honestly, could there be a more fitting choice? We now live in a world where emotional closeness is streamed, intimacy is performed, and connection is consumed in square tiles on our screens. The distance between us and the people we admire has collapsed so dramatically that for many, these aren’t public figures anymore — they feel like friends. Confidants. Extensions of ourselves.The word itself describes a one-sided emotional bond formed with someone we don’t know — a celebrity, influencer, streamer, or even a fictional character. But today, parasocial barely feels like an academic term. It feels like a daily lived reality.Instagram is no longer 'just an app'; it’s the new Netflix, feeding us episodic glimpses into people’s lives with cliffhangers, plot twists, soft-launches, and heartbreak arcs. Our idols aren’t just entertainers — they’re protagonists in a never-ending reality show, one we binge-watch with the devotion we once reserved for scripted television.Once upon a time, celebrity culture was mysterious, aspirational, placed firmly behind velvet ropes and PR filters.Today, the doors are flung open.Everyone — from A-list stars to teenagers with a ring light — is telling their story online.And the more people share, the closer we feel. Or at least, the closer we think we feel.Livestreams, photo dumps, notes-app confessions, 'get ready with me' videos, chaotic vlogs, 2am heartbreak stories, pilates classes, pet updates, skincare routines — the everyday has become theatrical. And we, the audience, become emotionally entangled in narratives that aren’t ours.You may never have met that influencer you check on every day. You may never have spoken to the actor whose divorce devastates you or the singer whose cryptic lyric you analyze for hidden truths. But our minds don’t always distinguish between real closeness and repeated, intimate exposure.The more we see someone, the more we feel we know them. The more they 'share,' the more we believe that access = intimacy.The parasocial world thrives on that illusionFor some, this bond becomes an identity.""I’m such a Swiftie that when Taylor announced her engagement, I screamed like my actual best friend was getting married. I’ve seen her fight for her music, reinvent whole eras, and drop breakup songs that can resurrect a dead party. Now my entire feed is nothing but Taylor easter eggs and Opalite reels. She has no idea I exist, but I’m emotionally invested like we’ve grown up together,"" said Priyanka Mukherjee, demonstrating peak parasocial bond.What’s fascinating is how common this feeling is — not embarrassing, not fringe, but culturally dominant. Entire communities are built around these shared emotional investments.Similarly, Shameen Alauddin has been invested in Nina Dobrev's life for almost 15 years now. ""Nina Dobrev is one of those celebrities who has quietly stayed in my life for almost 15 years. It’s like Dobrev became someone I rooted for without even realising it was happening; I am not tracking every little thing she does, but it is her personality that keeps me invested.""Celebrity culture used to be a conversation between fan magazines and fans. Now it’s a relationship. Or at least, the illusion of one.The parasocial bond isn’t limited to pop stars — athletes ignite it with equal intensity. Watching sports has always carried emotion, but in our hyper-connected world, fans often feel tied to players as if they were family.""The first full season I watched Messi glide through defenders, I truly believed magic exists and here was a man that made me believe in it. His biggest moments have felt personal: his departure from Barcelona felt like being uprooted from home, and his World Cup win gave me a joy so deep it still lives in my chest years later,"" said a starry-eyed Nakul Jain, who physically lives in Bengaluru, but believes he is Argentinian.""The way he carries himself, his humility and quiet strength, shapes how I move through life. And every time he wins, it feels like I win too… because fighting for him, loving him, and believing in him feels like defending a part of myself that still believes in magic,"" he added.This is the power of parasocial attachment — it’s not 'just fandom.' It becomes a mirror for our own emotional lives.Their battles feel like metaphors for ours. Their victories heal wounds we didn’t know were open. Their losses feel like personal tragedies.And then there’s the moment when the story you’ve been watching through a screen suddenly appears in 4K reality — concerts.There is nothing quite like standing in a stadium, surrounded by thousands of people who share your emotional vocabulary, waiting for the person whose voice has narrated your life. The lights dim. The first chords ring out. And suddenly, your parasocial relationship acquires a heartbeat.I attended a few concerts recently — Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, Maroon 5, Akon — and the experience was surreal. It was a collision of worlds: the digital, curated presence I had consumed for years and the embodied, breathing version standing right there on the stage.When Chris Martin broke into 'Fix You,' it felt like collective therapy.When Sheeran looped his guitar and built a song from scratch, it felt intimate, like he was doing it just for us.When Adam Levine swaggered across the stage, the entire stadium screamed like they had been waiting their whole lives for that exact moment.That’s the strange beauty of parasocial experiences — your idol doesn’t know your name, but you know their gestures, their smile, their stage banter, the exact way their voice cracks on that one high note. Seeing them in person felt like meeting someone familiar, someone whose existence has threaded through your memories. These concerts emptied my wallet but filled my heart. And that’s exactly what parasocial joy feels like — irrational, extravagant, but deeply, deeply human.Parasocial bonds don’t just give us joy — they give us grief.When beloved public figures die, the world mourns collectively, but privately too. It’s an ache that might feel disproportionate but isn’t. We grieve not just the person, but the era of ourselves they represented.When Satish Shah passed away recently — especially for fans of Sarabhai vs Sarabhai — it felt like losing a piece of our childhood living room. Indravardhan Sarabhai was more than a character; he was a personality stitched into our nostalgia, our humour, our shared pop culture shorthand.Matthew Perry’s death felt even more shattering. Chandler Bing was the friend in our living room for ten seasons, the voice in the background during college, the comfort show after breakups. The man behind that character battled demons we only understood later, and his passing felt heartbreakingly personal. Maggie Smith , whose characters shaped multiple generations — from Professor McGonagall to Violet Crawley — represented wisdom, wit, and authority. Her passing felt like the world losing a certain type of dignity.""I felt something similar when Liam Payne died. I slipped back into that old One Direction fan mode without planning it — rewatching performances, scrolling through timelines, trying to take in the news. It wasn’t about being attached to him as a person, but about the memories of my teenage self being a fan of that boy band. When one of them was suddenly gone, it made me realise that even when you don’t actively think of yourself as a ‘stan’, the version of you who once was can come rushing back,"" said Shameen.These people never knew us. But we knew them — or at least, a version of them. And the loss feels real because the relationships felt real.Influencers today aren’t just creators; they’re brands built on relatability. Their value comes from their ability to maintain the illusion that you are part of their inner circle.This means:- sharing personal struggles- opening up about mental health- soft-launching partners- crying on camera- revealing childhood traumas- letting viewers 'get ready' with them- inviting audiences to vote on their outfit, hairstyle, breakfast, life choicesIt’s intimacy as strategy. Vulnerability as content. Connection as a business model.Even though it’s designed, we still fall for it — because humans are wired for connection. If someone looks into a camera and talks like they’re talking to you, your brain often defaults to believing it.Why parasocial bonds feel so good — and so dangerousParasocial relationships give us:✔ comfort✔ consistency✔ emotional release✔ community✔ the illusion of stability✔ a safe escapeBut they also blur the lines between fantasy and reality. They also give us:- Expectation of emotional reciprocity- Comparisons of our lives to others’ curated narratives- Attachments based on edited glimpses- Guilt, jealousy, loyalty, and heartbreak over people we’ve never metIf we peel back the layers, parasocial attachment isn’t a glitch — it’s a feature of our era.And because everyone is online now — not just celebrities — parasocial dynamics exist between regular people too. We follow acquaintances, colleagues, strangers, creators, and micro-influencers and build internal impressions of their lives, personalities, and journeys without truly knowing them.We’re all characters in each other’s feeds. We’re all building one-sided familiarity with people who barely think of us. We’re all simultaneously the watchers and the watched.This is the new human condition — intimate yet lonely, connected yet curated, expressive yet isolated.Honestly — it’s both.Parasocial relationships can bring joy, inspiration, healing, motivation, creativity, and community. They can also bring heartbreak, comparison, obsession, and confusion.The key is awareness - to love the art without believing we own the artist, to enjoy the connection without mistaking it for a relationship, to cherish the comfort without collapsing into dependency, to admire someone without dissolving into their narrative.We may live in a parasocial world, but that’s not inherently tragic. It’s simply a new kind of human connection — born from the technology we created, shaped by the emotions we’ve always carried.Because at the end of the day, whether it’s Taylor, Messi, Ed Sheeran, Satish Shah, Matthew Perry, or Maggie Smith… parasocial love is still love. Real or imagined, it tells us something true about ourselves — what we value, what we long for, what we grieve, what we hope for. And maybe the most human thing of all is caring deeply about people who’ll never know our names.","In 2025, parasocial became the Cambridge Dictionary’s Word of the Year. The word describes a one-sided emotional bond formed with someone we don’t know. We now live in a world where emotional closeness is streamed, intimacy is performed, and connection is consumed in square tiles on our screens.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125521843,imgsize-1390888,width-400,resizemode-4/november-21-3.jpg"
'Creamy layer' cornering big share of jobs quota: CJI Gavai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/creamy-layer-cornering-big-share-of-jobs-quota-cji-gavai/articleshow/125525604.cms,"CJI Gavai (File photo)



NEW DELHI: On his last day in office, CJI Bhushan Ramakrishna Gavai, the second from Dalit community to head the judiciary, said it is worrisome that caste is being weaponised by the socially and economically uplifted among SC/ST communities to corner a major portion of reservation in jobs.CJI Gavai also expressed concern over the spiraling social tendency to indulge in hate speech and said it is for Parliament to debate and, if needed, legislate new norms and mechanisms to curb the phenomenon. Reasonable restrictions on free speech under the Constitution appear inadequate to deal with rampant hate speech on social media. ""Personally, I think that some sort of regulatory mechanism needs to be put in place,"" the CJI remarked.Speaking to TOI, CJI Gavai said it is high time that Centre and the states sub-categorised SC/ST communities to enable those who continue to be socially, economically and educationally backward among these communities to reap the benefits of quota in govt jobs.As regards the verdict of a seven-judge bench headed by him that had permitted states to sub-categorise castes within SC communities based on socio-economic backwardness and the degree of under-representation in govt jobs, ensuring that the larger pie of quota in jobs went to the most backward, the CJI said that despite criticism from his own community, he strongly feels that the 'creamy layer' among SC/ST communities must give way to the deprived among these communities.Asked about the best and worst moments in his tenure as CJI, he said that while the judgment against bulldozer justice was the most satisfying one he had delivered, the way Justice Ujjal Bhuyan criticised his majority view in a recent verdict that overturned the earlier SC verdict on Bills passed by Assemblies marked a low for him. ""He could have criticised my decision. But he was personal in his criticism. That left a bad taste,"" the CJI said.Asked about the meagre representation of women in Supreme Court , the CJI said this is mainly on account of very few women judges at present finding a place among those in the zone of consideration. ""This is because the selection of women judges for HCs picked up late, and I'm sure that in another five years, there will be many women HC judges in the zone of consideration for elevation to the apex court.""Given the option to choose between the Collegium system and one akin to the quashed National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) which was put in place unanimously by Parliament, the CJI said the present system (Collegium) has worked well, especially since the Collegium started interacting with the recommended persons individually to test their suitability.On the pendency of more than five crore cases in trial courts, he said the strength of trial court judges (around 21,000 at present) needs to be increased in a phased yet continuous manner.Among the important judgments penned by him, the series of rulings that strengthened the protection of environment, ecology and forests are closest to his heart. The unanimous verdict in the Presidential Reference, the one for sub-categorisation of SC/STs and the striking down of Tribunal Reforms Act, all of which required long hours of deliberation, too figured among the favourite judgments of CJI Gavai.",CJI Bhushan Ramakrishna Gavai is the second from Dalit community to head the judiciary. He said caste is being weaponised by the socially and economically uplifted among SC/ST communities to corner a major portion of reservation in jobs.

How the tragic mishap occurred?

NEW DELHI: Wing Commander Afshan saluted her husband, Wing Commander Namansh Syal, as she paid her last respects to him.Wing Commander Namansh Syal lost his life in the LCA Tejas crash in Dubai on 21st November.The mortal remains of Wing Commander Namansh Syal were brought to his native village of Patialkar in Himachal Pradesh’s Kangra district on Sunday.Villagers, family members and officials gathered to pay emotional tributes as his last rites are set to be performed.The Indian Air Force (IAF) confirmed the pilot’s demise after the aircraft crashed and burst into flames during a low-level aerobatic demonstration at Al Maktoum International Airport, Dubai on Friday.Local residents and friends described Syal as a “gem” and the pride of their village and school.Sandeep Kumar, a local, said, “We are from the same village as Namansh, Patialkar. Everyone in our village is sad. He was like our younger brother. This should not have happened. We do not have words. We met him 3-4 months ago when he visited our village.”Pankaj Chadha, who studied alongside Wing Commander Namansh Syal, recalled their school days and how he was a gem.""I have also studied in the same school as Namansh, Sainik School Sujanpur Tira. We have lost one of our gems. He was the pride of our school. We will go to his native village, Patialkar. He made all of us very proud,"" Chadha said.The Tejas Mark-1 fighter jet was performing an eight-minute aerobatic demonstration when it could not recover from a low-altitude “negative G-turn,” plunging to the ground and erupting into flames in front of a large audience.Visuals from the Dubai Air Show showed the jet crashing and sending thick black smoke into the sky. Emergency teams rushed to the site, but Wing Commander Syal could not eject in time and sustained fatal injuries.This was the second crash involving the lightweight multi-role Tejas since its induction into the IAF a decade ago. The first crash, near Jaisalmer in March last year, saw the pilot safely eject. The IAF has ordered a court of inquiry to ascertain the cause of the crash, coordinating with Dubai aviation authorities and recovering the aircraft’s black box.Veteran pilots highlight that such accidents can occur due to sudden loss of power, control malfunction or spatial disorientation during negative G maneuvers","Wing Commander Namansh Syal lost his life in the LCA Tejas crash in Dubai on 21st November.

It was DLTGH 50 (days left to go home) at National Defence Academy (NDA). Morning announcements at squadrons were now beginning with this cheerful count. Mid-term had passed. Termbreak — and home — were only a few weeks away when the Oct 10 morning muster in Charlie Squadron reported a missing firsttermer, Cadet Antriksh Kumar Singh.The 18-year-old was found dead in his cabin. It was the third suicide in NDA since 2014. The Lucknow boy had cleared Services Selection Board (SSB) in his first attempt and was by all accounts a very bright student. What drove him beyond the edge?Less than two weeks later, tragedy struck again. This time in the swimming pool. Bravo Squadron first-termer Aditya D Yadav, a weak swimmer, was being put through extra lessons to clear his mandatory test when he drowned.Just how he died in the presence of six instructors, other cadets and officers is not known yet.Police investigations are on into both incidents. NDA is holding a court of inquiry. Both families have alleged a conspiracy and demanded ‘impartial investigations’.The back-to-back deaths at India’s premier military academy have triggered a deep introspection within defence and training circles about SSB, the training regimen and the psychological resilience expected of boys and girls fresh out of school.Selection for NDA is one of the most gruelling in the world — some 6 lakh sign up for just 406 seats. After clearing a UPSC written exam, candidates have to undergo an SSB interview process that lasts four days for those that clear screening. Then, there are medical tests. It’s after this multi-layered filtering that cadets earn the right to wear the Ashoka emblem on their NDA beret.Then comes training. Often, night merges into sleepless night after the day’s soul-sapping ‘ ragda ’ for first-termers. “Forget the drill square or PT grounds, merely surviving from reveille to lights-out in the squadron was a challenge in my ‘ Ikki ’ (first-termer) days,” recalled an NDA alumnus, who later joined as an instructor. “The process of forging boys into soldiers needs to be hard on mind and body. Unfortunately, sometimes tragedies happen. My heart goes out to the families of these cadets.”While the two deaths occurred under different circumstances, they are an indication of the immense adjustment pressures first-term cadets face.There have been nine deaths at NDA in the last two decades, three of them suicides. Cadets quitting training is also a major concern. A 2018 news report, quoting a report jointly prepared by Integrated Defence Staff Headquarters and NDA, revealed that between Jan 2008 and Nov 2017, as many as 1,256 cadets quit NDA, or a good 16-20% of intake every year.So, what’s going wrong?spoke to former SSB assessors, NDA instructors and former commandants and deputy commandants and a common voice emerged: the need to introduce systemic reforms that can ensure cadet safety without compromising on toughness.A consensus among several former SSB presidents and instructors is that the problem begins much before cadets even reach NDA. They point out that while the SSB process rigorously tests the mental makeup of a candidate, there is a need for a more uniform and scientific physical assessment system during the selection process itself.Candidates who fare poorly on the individual obstacle course may still get recommended if they are found fit otherwise — but the physical weakness shows up in NDA’s gruelling pace. Many candidates can’t cope with the sheer physical demands and drop out or get injured or worse.On Feb 11, 2022, defence minister Rajnath Singh informed Lok Sabha that 211 cadets had been discharged from NDA, IMA (Indian Military Academy in Dehradun) and OTA (Officers Training Academy, in Chennai and Gaya) in the previous 10 years as disabled and medically unfit for service.Experts suggest that like soldier recruitment rallies, a standardised physical test — based on measurable, uniform parameters — should be introduced for officer aspirants as well. Additionally, they recommend that cadets undergo comprehensive physical fitness assessments upon reporting to NDA.“Without a scientific baseline, how can the academy know if a cadet has weak leg muscles or poor endurance?” asked a retired physical training officer. “Instead of asking a new cadet to run a few kilometres within days of joining, the academy should build endurance gradually. Those who fail to meet standards after progressive training can then be screened out,” he suggested.“The individual obstacle test at SSB includes activities like ‘Tarzan jump’, vertical rope climbing or Burma bridge-crossing — things most civilian students have never done. Candidates from non-military schools find this difficult because it’s completely new to them,” said Brigadier Laxmicharan Patnaik, former president of an SSB centre.Brigadier Jay Konnur, former president of SSB Centre-Bangalore, acknowledged that physical standards often receive less attention during selection.“Candidates are asked to complete 10 obstacles in three minutes. We observe determination, not absolute physical capability. If a candidate manages even six, we tend to overlook the shortfall. That may not reflect the actual physical preparedness required for NDA training,” he said, adding that SSB’s focus on leadership and group dynamics often overshadows baseline fitness.“Once they reach NDA, every shortcoming becomes magnified in a far more demanding environment,” he pointed out.They are equally vocal about the need for improved and sustained psychological evaluations. “Psychological tests at SSBs are not foolproof,” said Patnaik, who was also chairman of Odisha Public Service Commission. “Repeated and deeper assessments at the academy are essential.”He feels NDA should appoint a dedicated team of psychologists to conduct regular evaluations and build a psychological dossier for each cadet.“These young men are future leaders of the armed forces. Understanding their emotional and mental resilience early can prevent breakdowns later,” Patnaik pointed out, adding that psychological counselling should be made a “normal and de-stigmatised part” of cadet life. “If we normalise counselling, first-termers will open up more. Confidential sessions can help them regain confidence and adjust to the demanding environment,” he said.“Cadets from civilian backgrounds face a stunning culture shock in the first term. They are not accustomed to the regimentation, physical demands or the sheer mental toughness that’s asked of them,” said an NDA alumnus. The academy has a system of counselling but what it needs is professional counsellors, said another alumnus.According to Major General Shukla, former commandant of SSB centre-Bhopal, the problem is compounded by interpersonal challenges within squadrons.“First-term cadets are often under immense pressure to prove themselves. Some seniors, driven by tradition or competition, unintentionally humiliate or overburden them. Sensitising senior cadets about mentorship is essential. They must handhold, not intimidate,” he said, remarking that effective mentorship and emotional support from senior cadets can ease this transition provided it is guided and monitored by officers. “Else, the same system that is meant to help may break them,” he cautioned.The “buddy system” — where every fresher is mentored by a senior cadet (overstudy) — has come under sharp scrutiny after recent incidents. Several parents, including serving officers, allege the system often crosses ethical and physical boundaries.“There are cases where seniors ask juniors to perform dangerous activities in the name of maintaining squadron honour,” said a source. “A second-term cadet suffered serious neck injuries when a senior asked him to perform a dive roll — a test the senior himself had not passed. The case is under consideration and the injured cadet is likely to board out on medical grounds.”Antriksh’s parents have alleged that his overstudy ragged him relentlessly. That is yet to be borne out in the police probe.The ‘fauji’ father of a medically boarded-out cadet said, “Each squadron competes fiercely in swimming, cross-country, or equestrian events. Seniors push juniors to unrealistic limits to maintain their reputation. This is neither scientific nor fair. This practice needs to be stopped.”However, former NDA commandants defend the mentorship tradition, insisting that when implemented correctly, it helps cadets adapt to a tough environment.Lt Gen Asit Mistry (retd), a former NDA commandant, said, “The buddy system has existed for decades and works effectively. Senior cadets help newcomers cope with the rigours of training. It’s unclear what went wrong in these cases, but the concept is sound.”Another former commandant added, “There is no scope for ragging or unscientific practices. Each squadron has officers specifically responsible for cadet welfare, who personally monitor stress and morale. Deviations must be dealt with seriously.”Ex-NDAs fiercely defend the academy’s ethos, and its emphasis on physical and mental toughness, pointing out that the system has produced three Param Vir Chakras, 12 Ashoka Chakras, 32 Mahavir Chakras and 160 Vir Chakras.But officers have also acknowledged the existence of what they term “unscientific traditions” — informal endurance practices not sanctioned but culturally ingrained. “These sessions are not officially part of the training schedule. But they are often conducted by senior cadets in the name of toughening them up. It can lead to injuries or psychological breakdowns,” said a former physical training officer.Another veteran observed that while the intention may be to foster toughness, such practices must be replaced with structured, scientific endurance programmes. “We must stop romanticising suffering as character-building. A soldier’s resilience should be built through method, not shock,” he suggested.Another alumnus recalled his own early struggles: “In my first term, I felt completely out of place. I couldn’t meet the standards and thought of quitting. It was only in the third term that I regained confidence. The system is harsh — but it shouldn’t break you before it builds you.”An officer who was part of the TriServices Committee, which tried to reform practices at training academies in 2003, said barracks punishments are the reasons for suicides and should be stopped immediately. “Most armies have changed it. Punishments can be military-ways, but harassment during night or odd hours should end immediately,” he toldon the condition of anonymity. “The academy must evolve with the times,” said Major General Shukla. “We cannot afford to lose bright young minds to outdated systems. The goal is not to dilute training, but to make it safer, smarter, and more humane.”As the investigations into the two deaths continue, the hope is that the tragedy will become a catalyst for long-overdue change — one that ensures no more dreams are extinguished in the process of building the nation’s defenders.Far from the institutional debate lies the anguish of devastated families. Rubikumari Yadav, mother of first-termer Aditya Yadav, said her life has been shattered. “My son dreamed of serving the nation, and now I am left with nothing. The academy says there was no fault. Who is responsible for my son’s death then?” she asked.Antriksh’s family says he faced intense pressure and humiliation from a senior cadet. “He topped his school and was full of dreams,” said his uncle, A P Sengar. “But he couldn’t bear the pressure. This is not training — it’s trauma.”Reacting to the allegations levelled by Antriksh’s parents, then NDA commandant Vice-Admiral Gurcharan Singh told, “It is a regrettable incident. He was a good cadet and performing well. We are in touch with the family and extending all possible assistance. A court of inquiry has been ordered to ascertain the facts.”But that’s little consolation for Rubikumari. “At the end of the day, I lost my son — and they lost one of the nation’s best,” she said.| Cadet Aditya D Yadav dies during swimming session| Cadet Antriksh Kumar Singh dies by suicide| Gentleman Cadet S Balu dies during a swimming session| Gentleman Cadet Kumbhar Atharv Sambhaji dies during cross country run| Gentleman Cadet Umang Khar dies from a heat stroke| Cadet R Rabijith dies during training| Cadets follow a clear hierarchy within each squadron, ensuring continuous guidance. Five officers are assigned to every squadron, with officers on site, regularly interacting with cadetsTo ensure that cadets can raise concerns without fear, NDA runs a confidential Cadet Suggestion Forum — overseen by highest Academy authorities, monitored daily| Each squadron has two dedicated counsellors, along with service officers who provide additional guidance. This process is monitored by the battalion commander (a colonel-rank officer)| Training is scientific and progressive, designed for gradual physical and mental conditioning.

Cadets needing extra physical support receive bespoke training","NDA’s training regimen takes cadets beyond mental and physical limits of endurance. For some, however, the road ends not in a quiet withdrawal, but in tragedy.

Ciara’s Guide To Manifesting Convictions Into Reality | Angie Martinez IRL

Ciara and Russell Wilson have never shied away from expressing admiration for one another, but the singer’s latest reflections are offering fans one of the most intimate looks yet into their marriage. During a candid appearance on the “Angie Martinez IRL” podcast, Ciara spoke at length about the dynamic she shares with the New York Giants quarterback, especially their three-year age gap, something she says has only added depth to their connection.For Ciara, Wilson is not just younger on paper; he’s the emotional anchor in their marriage, someone whose “old soul” and grounded demeanor bring stability during the pressure-filled chaos of NFL life and fame.While discussing the early years of their relationship and the evolution of their bond, Ciara shared that Russell Wilson often feels more mature than she does, despite being younger. “I do like to live young,” she said. “And then obviously my husband’s younger than me too, so I gotta keep it here. He’s an old soul, to be honest with you, he might be a little more older than me.”Ciara added, “Sometimes I feel his fullness as a man, and that feels good.”It’s a sentiment that mirrors what fans repeatedly see in their public exchanges; respect, partnership, and a deep emotional alignment.That admiration was on full display back in October when Ciara penned a heartfelt Instagram message thanking Wilson for a surprise birthday celebration. “Baby, thank you for always making me feel on top of the world and for throwing the best surprise birthday party!” she wrote. “You always make every moment for me, big or small, feel special and important! You are the best!! I love you soooooo much.”The couple continues to shrug off online chatter, including the long-running “corny” label directed at Wilson. Ciara addressed that narrative months earlier on “The Breakfast Club,” responding with grace and conviction. “Why would I even respond to that, you know what I’m saying?” she said. “[He’s] the most amazing human being you can know… What you see with him is really who he is. So, it’s beautiful, it’s different. ”As the pair publicly embraces discussions about expanding their family, one thing remains clear: Ciara sees Russell Wilson not just as her partner, but as the grounding force who brings consistency, love, and an unwavering sense of maturity into their life together.Also Read: Russell Wilson and Ciara celebrate a Hollywood milestone as their first major film breaks into the year’s top 100","Ciara revealed on the 'Angie Martinez IRL' podcast that her husband, Russell Wilson, acts as an emotional anchor in their marriage.

Kansas City fans are bracing for a pivotal showdown as Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs return to Arrowhead Stadium to face the Indianapolis Colts. After back-to-back road losses to the Bills and Broncos, Mahomes knows the margin for error has vanished. The team (5‑5) needs a win to keep its AFC playoff hopes alive, and all eyes are on the three-time Super Bowl MVP to bounce back. Beyond the pressure of the field, Mahomes also found moments of personal joy, giving fans a glimpse into life outside football.Off the field, Mahomes spent Friday evening with his wife, Brittany, enjoying a rare night out before the high-stakes matchup. Brittany shared several updates on Instagram, spotlighting her red leather outfit for dinner at 1587 Prime, the Kansas City steakhouse Mahomes opened with Travis Kelce earlier this year. The posts allowed followers to see a different side of the quarterback, one grounded in family, love, and life beyond the playbook.In one post, Brittany drew attention to a small detail in her outfit, writing, “1587 & a cute bow,” with her back turned to the camera. She later shared a black-and-white photo giving her 2.1 million followers a clear look at the front of her ensemble. 1587 Prime has become a hotspot for Chiefs players and NFL personalities alike, with Travis Kelce and his fiancee, Taylor Swift, among the frequent guests.The restaurant honors both Mahomes’ No. 15 and Kelce’s No. 87, and even offers signature cocktails inspired by their partners.Patrick Mahomes didn’t appear in Brittany’s Friday night posts, but she gave him a nod earlier in the day for his thoughtful gesture. A bouquet of “just because flowers” from her high school sweetheart appeared on her Instagram story with the caption, “@patrickmahomes you are the best ever.” Moments like these show a couple enjoying each other’s company and staying grounded, even amid the demands of the NFL season.Last week, Patrick and Brittany Mahomes took part in a light-hearted promotion with CommunityAmerica Credit Union where they painted portraits of each other. Patrick warned that he wasn’t much of an artist, and Brittany’s reaction proved it. She laughed when she saw the portrait he made of her, joking about how he drew her teeth and pointing out the big eyelashes he added. Patrick, meanwhile, complimented Brittany’s drawing of him, saying it actually looked like him.As the Chiefs prepare to take on the Colts, the Mahomes pair brings off-field positivity into a high-pressure weekend. Brittany’s style, their shared moments, and Patrick’s focus on bouncing back all contribute to the narrative heading into a crucial home game. Fans will be watching to see if that energy translates to a strong performance on the field and another stylish appearance from Brittany during gameday.","Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany, enjoyed a rare night out before the Chiefs take on the Indianapolis Colts.

How “Tweaker” Became a Cultural Phenomenon

GELO - Tweaker (Official Video)

Tweaker's Chart Domination and Viral Impact on Fans

How LiAngelo Ball Went From Basketball to Music Trailblazer

LiAngelo Ball’s transformation from overlooked basketball prospect to music industry headliner has officially reached a historic milestone. His debut single “Tweaker,” released under the stage name Gelo, has achieved platinum status - an achievement that puts him in the same conversation as heavyweight artists like Drake . For an athlete-turned-musician, this level of success is both unprecedented and culturally significant, signaling a genuine crossover moment that few have ever achieved.In addition to redefining LiAngelo's public persona, this achievement represents the pinnacle of a swift ascent that started in early 2025. LiAngelo, a musician who was frequently overshadowed by his brothers Lonzo and LaMelo Ball, has carved out a whole new path, demonstrating that his musical drive and artistic intuition were much more than a curiosity.Released in January 2025, “Tweaker” exploded online almost instantly. Its nostalgic, bouncy beat - powered by piano, organ keys, and lush synth pads - captured the spirit of early-2000s hip-hop. Paired with Gelo’s melodic, sing-song delivery and a catchy “whoa” hook reminiscent of Big Tymers-era anthems, the track resonated widely. Produced by Kunica and Glockie Cheez, the song painted a picture of luxury, swagger, and newfound fame, creating an irresistible vibe that appealed to both younger listeners and fans of classic hip-hop aesthetics.The song's momentum grew even more when it gained popularity in sports culture. When NBA and NFL teams like the Detroit Lions, Chicago Bulls, and Cleveland Cavaliers started using ""Tweaker"" as a happy anthem in locker rooms and warm-up routines, it quickly gained popularity outside of the usual music circles.The success of “Tweaker” eventually led to a massive $13 million record deal with Def Jam and Universal Music Group. The contract included an extraordinary $8 million guaranteed signing bonus—more than what many current NBA players earn annually. This landmark deal solidified Gelo’s credibility and marketability within the hip-hop and R&B world.A well-known remix with Lil Wayne gave the song even more momentum and the endorsement of one of the biggest names in rap.“Tweaker” made history by reaching No. 1 on the US Rhythmic Billboard chart - an exceptional feat for a debut single from a former basketball player. The song sparked viral dance trends across social platforms and earned praise from artists like T-Pain, Lil Yachty, and Joe Budden. Its appeal spanned music, sports, and online culture, cementing LiAngelo Ball as 2025’s breakout music star.Before rising to prominence in the music industry, LiAngelo Ball spent years navigating the NBA G-League and international basketball leagues. Eventually, he gave up the sport entirely, a decision that was validated by his outstanding achievements. His debut album League of My Own, which was released in July 2025, showcased his growth as a musician and cemented his place in the industry.Also read: Angel Reese responds with 4-word message after her name is dragged into viral NBA courtside altercation LiAngelo Ball's platinum achievement for ""Tweaker"" is a significant cultural event rather than only a personal victory.

"Bryce Dunlap cause of death: A young fan’s life ends abruptly, leaving behind questions and sadness",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/bryce-dunlap-cause-of-death-a-young-fans-life-ends-abruptly-leaving-behind-questions-and-sadness/articleshow/125424671.cms,"(Image Source - Gofundme)

How did Bryce Dunlap die?

Bryce Dunlap was just 21 and hailed from Ohio, recognized by his friends as a die-hard Cleveland Browns supporter. His untimely death on November 16, 2025, has left his family and community in mourning, further complicated by the unanswered questions about what led to his health crisis. While the precise initial cause is still unclear in public discussions, family members have recounted the progression of events—from breathing difficulties to fatal brain injury—through social media and interviews.Bryce Dunlap passed away due to complications from an anoxic brain injury that followed a sudden medical emergency the week before. His stepmother, Nicole Dunlap, shared on Facebook on November 12, 2025, that Bryce Dunlap became unresponsive because of respiratory distress, which quickly escalated to cardiac arrest, cutting off oxygen to his brain and leading to irreversible damage.Despite being on a ventilator and showing short-lived signs of responsiveness, such as hand squeezes, he was unable to recover. Doctors informed the family that the anoxic injury—resulting from extended oxygen deprivation—was fatal, as mentioned in a GoFundMe update by his aunt Tracy McCanna on November 17, 2025. The family has not publicly shared any underlying reasons for the initial respiratory failure, like illness or outside factors, in their statements to outlets such as Fox 8 News Cleveland.In the haze of loss, the family turned to Bryce's prior wish to donate organs, a choice that brought purpose to their pain. Discussions with LifeBanc, the nonprofit organ procurement organization serving Northeast Ohio, began immediately after his passing. It was here that the connection to Bernie Kosar emerged.Kim Kane explained the major exchange to the Fox 8 I-Team on November 18, 2025: ""My ex-husband and I looked at each other and said Bernie Kosar is going through some terrible stuff. And we said put Bernie on the list.She said, ""Are you serious and we said yeah put Bernie on the list."" The ""she"" refers to a LifeBanc representative during the consultation. Kane added, reflecting on Bryce's fandom, ""This would have meant so much to him to do something.""The liver transplant was completed successfully on Monday, November 17, 2025, with Kosar recovering well enough to post a video update from his hospital bed that afternoon. LifeBanc confirmed to Fox 8 on November 18, 2025, that they handle all donations compassionately while adhering to federal privacy laws, but declined specifics on this case.The support we've received has been incredible. By November 19, 2025, the GoFundMe, which was set up to help with funeral and memorial expenses, had brought in $58,253, exceeding its original target to help the family financially. McCanna mentioned in the update, ""Bryce touched countless lives, and will continue to do so as an organ donor. We want to honor him in a way that reflects the love he shared so freely.""The suddenness of Bryce's passing still leaves us with so many questions. Family statements haven't really identified a specific cause apart from the respiratory issues, and medical privacy keeps us from knowing more. As Kane mentioned to the I-Team, the emphasis is on his legacy: a young fan whose last gift connected generations of Browns supporters.Also Read: Who is Damone Clark?

It’s just about finding little moments to check in and reconnect.”Both Stephen Curry and his wife, Ayesha Curry, have always been open about how their marriage comes “first” and even before their children.However, the two have continued to be brutally trolled by fans even though both Stephen Curry and Ayesha Curry have always stayed committed to each other.Ayesha Curry’s recent confession about wanting a different life has also sparked outrage among fans.A few weeks ago, Ayesha Curry made an appearance on Call Her Daddy podcast where she said, “No. I didn’t want kids. I didn’t want to get married. I thought I was going to be a ‘career girl,’ and that’s it.”The popular mom of four continued, “After we got married, we found out we were pregnant with our daughters so quickly, I didn’t even have time to think about what I wanted anymore…”","Stephen Curry and his wife, Ayesha Curry, have been very much in love with each other ever since the two met as teenagers.

Smriti Mandhana & Palash Muchhal’s Haldi Ceremony Begins!

The highly anticipated wedding of Indian cricket star Smriti Mandhana and music composer-filmmaker Palash Muchhal, originally scheduled for this Sunday in Sangli, has been postponed indefinitely.Mandhana’s manager, Tuhin Mishra, confirmed that the decision came after her father, Shriniwas Mandhana, fell unwell.“This morning, while having breakfast, Smriti’s father suddenly felt unwell. We waited for a while, hoping he would feel better, but his condition worsened. To be safe, we called an ambulance and took him to the hospital. He is currently under observation,” Mishra told PTI.The family has decided to prioritise his health, leading to the postponement of the ceremony.Mandhana, one of Indian cricket’s most prominent faces and a recent World Cup champion, was set to marry Muchhal in an intimate ceremony attended only by close family and friends.The celebrations in Sangli had been underway through the week, with fans catching rare glimpses of the usually reserved opener enjoying her pre-wedding festivities.Mandhana and Muchhal’s relationship goes back to 2019, when they met through mutual friends in Mumbai’s creative circles.The couple kept their bond private for years while balancing demanding careers — Mandhana leading India’s charge on the global stage and Muchhal expanding his footprint in films and music.They made their relationship public only in July 2024, on their fifth anniversary.Since then, the couple has shared limited but cherished glimpses of their journey, including Muchhal’s widely discussed proposal at DY Patil Stadium following India’s World Cup triumph.Leading a blindfolded Mandhana onto the very pitch where she had made history, Muchhal went down on one knee with a ring, later cementing the moment with a tattoo of “SM18” on his forearm.The couple was to formalise their union on November 23, 2025, a date they had chosen to mark the beginning of their next chapter.

Bret Hart’s claim about Shawn Michaels and Vince McMahon



Bret The Hitman Hart Returns To Montreal

Bret Hart’s career legacy and the roles of Shawn Michaels and Vince McMahon today



With his usual style, Bret Hart recently made shocking comments on Shawn Michaels and Vince McMahon . While reflecting on his past in the wrestling business, the three-time WWE Hall of Famer revisited the complicated dynamic between Shawn Michaels and Vince McMahon. Of course, it was a relationship that shaped one of the most contentious eras in WWE history. His remarks resurfaced old tensions and added new layers to a rivalry that already carried decades of debate.Speaking during an appearance on the Johnny I Pro Show, Hart described moments from the late 1990s that led him to question what he saw behind the scenes. His perspective, shaped by personal conflict and years of unresolved history, set the tone for one of his most startling claims. Even now, long after the Montreal Screwjob and the end of his in-ring career, Hart continues to revisit that turbulent period with unfiltered honesty.During the interview, Bret Hart recalled the 1997 segment where Shawn Michaels spoke about losing his smile. Hart remembered observing Vince McMahon during the moment and feeling something was unusual. “When Shawn was in the ring talking about, you know he lost some part of himself or he was going to go find his smile.I remember Vince had the tear rolled down his cheek and I remember watching it and going, ‘I think there’s more going on here between these two guys. ’”Hart then shared the claim that stunned the audience. “Honestly. I’m just being honest and blunt, but I don’t know. I suspected and now I really have serious feelings I think that Shawn and Vince were sleeping with each other. I think I’m very close to the truth here. Shawn and Vince were lovers.”He continued by saying he felt trapped in the tension between them. “When I look back it’s like I got caught between two lovers, you know, and I got shafted and screwed over and Shawn was so envious and jealous of my position that he finally had to sleep with Vince to get it.” Hart stressed that he would not shy away from repeating his words directly. “I would actually like to have Shawn come clean and say, ‘Look, we were lovers. ’ Cuz I’m sure they were. I have absolute 100%. If I saw either Vince or Shawn here, I would say ‘I think you guys were lovers.’”Bret Hart ended his in-ring career in 2000 after a concussion from a match with Goldberg and later suffered a stroke, which propelled his retirement. His Hall of Fame résumé grew to historic levels, becoming the first person inducted three times: once individually, once with the Hart Foundation, and again for his iconic WrestleMania 13 moment with Stone Cold Steve Austin.Shawn Michaels followed a different path. After retiring in 2010 at WrestleMania XXVI, he stepped into an executive role and now serves as WWE’s Senior Vice President of Talent Development and Creative for NXT. Vince McMahon, once the centerpiece of WWE’s creative and corporate vision, resigned from leadership roles in 2022 and permanently retired from the company in 2023 after the formation of TKO Group Holdings.Also Read: WWE's plan after former 4-time World Champion loses opportunity to battle John Cena one last time",Bret Hart recently made shocking comments on Shawn Michaels and Vince McMahon.

Did Tom Brady just say the N-word live on air? Millions rewatch viral Cowboys-Eagles clip after GOAT's near-slip fuels intense debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/did-tom-brady-just-say-the-n-word-live-on-air-millions-rewatch-viral-cowboys-eagles-clip-after-goats-near-slip-fuels-intense-debate/articleshow/125529583.cms,"Tom Brady’s near N-word broadcast slip (Getty Images)

Tom Brady’s slip sparks reactions across social media



Tom Brady made an unfortunate mistake while calling the Dallas Cowboys vs. Philadelphia Eagles game on Sunday. It happened in the final minutes, when the tension of the NFC East clash had already gripped the stadium and viewers at home. While analyzing the sack on Jalen Hurts by Osa Odighizuwa, Brady stumbled over the name of Eagles lineman Landon Dickerson. The slip briefly created a moment of confusion before Brady immediately corrected himself and continued his commentary with calm professionalism.The seven-time Super Bowl champion is in his second season working in FOX’s lead booth with Kevin Burkhardt. In May 2022, FOX brought him in on a 10-year, 375 million dollar deal, making him the highest-paid sports commentator in history. The NFL initially placed certain limits on him due to his ownership stake with the Raiders, but this season those rules were “relaxed,” allowing him into production meetings and private player sessions that make the job more immersive.Tom Brady nearly had an unfortunate on-air slip-up while calling Sunday's game between the Dallas Cowboys and Philadelphia Eagles. As viewers replayed the moment, some wondered whether they had heard correctly. Brady was describing the sack when he said, ""Odighizuwa just blasted through Nicker,"" before swiftly adding, ""Excuse me, [Eagles guard] Landon Dickerson right there.""That instant was enough to light a match online. One viewer wrote, ""Sounds like Tom Brady said the infamous 'N' word,"" while another demanded, ""WHAT DID TOM BRADY JUST SAY?????"" Others quickly defended him, arguing it was nothing more than a verbal mix-up.One person clarified, ""He said 'Nicker-' as in Nickerson,"" and another noted how easy it is for a broadcaster to get tongue-tied during a live call, saying, ""He said nicker when going to say Landon Dickersons name he just got tongue tied yall blow everything outta proportion. ""Away from the chatter, Dallas authored a historic comeback, erasing a 21-point deficit in a dramatic 24-21 victory. Cowboys wideout George Pickens explained the turnaround, saying, ""I feel like the first half we were just a little bit sloppy, just shooting ourself in the foot."" Dak Prescott helped drive the rally, finishing with 354 passing yards and becoming the franchise’s all-time leader in fourth-quarter and overtime comebacks.For Brady, the moment served as a reminder that live broadcasting demands precision. His legacy on the field is unquestioned, and that same credibility is what earned him the headset.Also Read: Nyier Daniels behind the bars as felony child cruelty and police evasion rock Georgia football program","Tom Brady made an unfortunate mistake while calling the Dallas Cowboys vs. Philadelphia Eagles game on Sunday.

Will Aaron Rodgers play against Chicago Bears today? Latest injury update on the Steelers QB,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/will-aaron-rodgers-play-against-chicago-bears-today-latest-injury-update-on-the-steelers-qb/articleshow/125514512.cms,"Aaron Rodgers injury update (Getty Images)

Will Aaron Rodgers play against Bears?



The Pittsburgh Steelers enter Week 12 carrying both momentum and uncertainty. Aaron Rodgers has been officially listed as questionable on Mike Tomlin’s final injury report before the game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Chicago Bears. His left wrist fracture has kept fans guessing all week, and the tension has only grown as kickoff inches closer. Last weekend, he planned to return against the Cincinnati Bengals, but team doctors stepped in and stopped him. That moment changed everything for the Steelers’ immediate future.Mason Rudolph stepped in and turned an uneasy situation into a statement win. His sharp command powered a 34-12 victory at Acrisure Stadium, giving Pittsburgh confidence. Still, the central question now is whether Rodgers will be ready to return to Soldier Field or if the Super Bowl champion quarterback will wait one more week.Aaron Rodgers is listed as questionable, which means Sunday’s decision sits in the hands of doctors and Mike Tomlin. A report from Tom Pelissero revealed that Rodgers has pushed to play, but medical staff warned that one bad hit could cause a displaced fracture and keep him out for the rest of the season. Tomlin kept his stance steady, saying, “We’ll see where the weekend leads us.”The quarterback did not practice on Wednesday but returned in a limited capacity on Thursday and Friday.He wore a brace at practice to support the small fracture in his non throwing wrist. The wrap allowed him to catch shotgun snaps and hold the ball in one hand. His availability depends on how well that brace protects the injury and whether he can function with it during live action.If Rodgers cannot suit up, Mason Rudolph will take the field again. Rudolph completed 12 of 16 passes for 127 yards and a touchdown in last week’s win, earning a 118.5 passer rating. Meanwhile, the Steelers expect Cam Heyward and Darius Slay back from injury, which strengthens their defensive outlook in Chicago.The Bears are preparing for their eighth win in nine games and hoping to shake off years of frustration against Rodgers. His career record against Chicago stands at 25-5, and he has not played at Soldier Field since 2022. With Rodgers saying he is “pretty sure” this will be his final season, Sunday could mark his last trip to one of his most memorable stages if he is cleared in time.Also Read: Bill Belichick caught in family firestorm after Jen Belichick’s heated rant targeting girlfriend Jordon Hudson post-UNC game","Aaron Rodgers has been officially listed as questionable on Mike Tomlin’s final injury report.

Smriti Mandhana and Palash Muchhal’s wedding: What’s the net worth of the power couple?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/smriti-mandhana-and-palash-muchhals-wedding-whats-the-net-worth-of-the-power-couple/articleshow/125517213.cms,"Smriti Mandhana & Palash Muchhal

Palash Muchhal Proposes Cricketer Smriti Mandhana At DY Patil Stadium!

Vice-captain Smriti Mandhana , one of India’s most celebrated and consistent women cricketers, is all set to marry music composer Palash Muchhal on November 23. The engagement itself was nothing short of cinematic: Palash proposed to Smriti at Mumbai’s DY Patil Stadium, the very venue where India clinched the Women’s World Cup earlier this month. Fans are now curious not just about their love story but also about the combined wealth of this power couple.Smriti’s earnings on the cricket field are substantial. She holds a Grade A contract with the BCCI , which comes with an annual retainer of Rs 50 lakh. On top of that, she receives match fees for every international appearance: Rs 15 lakh per Test, Rs 6 lakh per ODI, and Rs 3 lakh per T20I. Coupled with her growing list of endorsements and Women’s Premier League income, her net worth is estimated at around Rs 34 crore.The Women’s Premier League has been a major boost for Smriti’s finances. During the inaugural WPL auction, Royal Challengers Bengaluru acquired her for Rs 3.4 crore per season, making her one of the highest-paid female cricketers globally. Leading RCB to a WPL title further enhanced her brand value, reportedly increasing it by nearly 30%.Smriti’s brand endorsements add significantly to her wealth. Over the years, she has collaborated with major brands including Hyundai, Hero Motocorp, Red Bull, Garnier, Nike, Mastercard, Havells, Wrangler, Gulf Oil, Herbalife, Bata Power, and UNICEF India.Each campaign reportedly earns her between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 75 lakh, depending on its scale, contributing to her estimated net worth of Rs 32-34 crore.Palash Muchhal, meanwhile, has carved a successful path in music and filmmaking. Born in Indore in 1995 into a musical family, with sister Palak Muchhal already a known playback singer, Palash honed his talent early in Hindustani classical music and performed in charity concerts during his childhood.He has composed songs for films, television, and independent singles, with hits like “Party Toh Banti Hai” (Bhoothnath Returns), “Tu Hi Hai Aashiqui” (Dishkiyaoon), and “Musafir.” Beyond composing, he has directed over 40 music videos for major labels like T-Series and Zee Music, and has even acted in the film Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey. His net worth is estimated between Rs 20 crore and Rs 41 crore, coming from royalties, film projects, live shows, and music composition.Together, Smriti and Palash form one of cricket and entertainment’s wealthiest couples, with a combined net worth estimated between Rs 50 crore and Rs 75 crore. The duo has been dating since 2019 but maintained a low profile for years, only hinting at their relationship publicly in October 2025 when Palash teased that Smriti would soon become the “daughter-in-law of Indore.”","Palash Muchhal proposed to Smriti Mandhana at Mumbai’s DY Patil Stadium.

It’s no secret that the San Francisco 49ers released fullback Kyle Juszczyk this March to refocus their energy on a younger crop and to manage the salary cap, even though the team later re-signed him to a new, cheaper contract.Juszczyk recently opened up about the emotional moment during the “Kittle Things” podcast with San Francisco teammate and tight end George Kittle and his wife, Claire. Kyle and Kristin Juszczyk also opened up about their love story on the same podcast, and fans couldn’t help but gush about their fairy tale.Kyle Juszczyk’s wife, Kristin, is a popular sportswear designer and is now an officially licensed NFL partner, which gives her the right to use the league’s logos on her designs. Over the years, the two have shared countless viral moments, from their quirky pregame and postgame handshake to Kyle spotting Kristin in the crowd after scoring.But how did their story begin? The couple recently talked about their memorable first meeting during a joint appearance on George and Claire Kittle’s podcast.“I had just transferred to Towson University. We’re going to bring Uncle John into this. Everyone has an Uncle John, I feel like,” Kristin said.“My cousin was going to a nearby college. [Uncle John] got tickets to go see the [Baltimore] Ravens. I had never been to an NFL game before. My cousin didn’t want to go, so he texted me like, ‘Do you want to come to the game?’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, of course, why not? I’ve never been.’ They were playing the [Carolina] Panthers. You guys were whooping ass. So we got nosebleed seats, but they were whooping ass, so everyone left. It was like a 30-point difference.”Kristin also shared a rather uncanny moment where she spoke about marrying Kyle one day, on the day she saw him. Needless to say, she manifested her dreams into reality!“So Uncle John was like, ‘Let’s go behind the bench. Let’s go down there!’ So we go behind the bench and long story short, I saw Kyle on the field and thought he was very handsome. And I had a pamphlet because it was my first ever NFL game, so I was taking everything they were giving to me. I was looking through the pamphlet and I was like, ‘Oh my God, he’s only 23! He went to Harvard? OK, check.’ And then I went to Aunt Lisa — as a joke — like, ‘I’m going to marry that guy one day. ’ I swear to God.”Kyle and Kristin tied the knot in 2019, but quite a lot happened before they made their relationship official. Their love story unravelled on social media! In fact Kristin broke it down to the T.“A few weeks later, I told my friends about it and they were like, ‘Just request him on Facebook,’ because this was before Instagram was big. And then Kyle started liking my pictures from like five years ago.”Kyle admitted he was selective with his likes, only tapping on photos that featured Kristin alone. If the picture included friends or family, he scrolled right past it. He wanted her to know she had his full attention.Even so, the determined NFL star never went beyond quietly liking her posts.“He never messaged me! He was just being a creeper and liking my pictures,” Kristin shared. “A week goes by and I got a little liquid courage and I said, ‘Hey, what are the chances I’ll bump into you downtown?’ “Kyle recalled that his team the Ravens had a game that week, so he replied to Kristin saying the timing wasn’t ideal. Still, he told her he’d love to go out to dinner another time.They eventually met at a restaurant, and Kristin admitted she was “so nervous,” since she was only 20 then. But the jitters didn’t last long; the two connected right away, and the conversation flowed easily.“We literally closed down the restaurant,” Kyle said. “We were there for like three and a half hours. Neither of us were willing to get up and go pee, even though we both had to go so bad. So after three and a half hours, we were like, “OK, they’re closing the restaurant, we should probably go pee before we leave.’ ""","The San Francisco 49ers released fullback Kyle Juszczyk this March.

Shubman Gill ruled out of South Africa ODIs; three captaincy candidates emerge

Poll Was Muthusamy's maiden Test century a turning point for South Africa in this match? Definitely, India are out of this game now Somewhat, but the match is still open Not really, India can still come back

Senuran Muthusamy picked the biggest stage available to him to deliver the defining innings of his career. The South African all-rounder raised his maiden Test century on Day 2 of the Guwahati Test, a calm, stubborn and eventually punishing knock that pushed India onto the back foot and gave the visitors control of the match.By lunch, South Africa had moved to 428 for 7 in 137 overs, with Muthusamy unbeaten on 107 off 203 balls. His innings included ten fours and two sixes, and came after an 88-run seventh-wicket stand with Kyle Verreynne, who was later stumped for 45 off 122. Marco Jansen joined him next and continued the same tempo, adding to a morning that steadily chipped away at India’s already stretched attack.The resistance deepened India’s frustration, which was evident in stand-in captain Rishabh Pant’s stump-mic remarks. At one point, he told his bowlers, ""Yaar 30 seconds ka timer hai,"" adding, ""Ghar pe khel rahe ho kya? Ek ball daal jaldi.""For Muthusamy, 31, the innings marked a major personal breakthrough. Born in Durban on 22 February 1994 to parents of Indian origin, he grew up with strong links to his Tamil heritage, with extended family still based in Nagapattinam, Tamil Nadu.His cricketing path began at Clifton School in Durban, where he also pursued academics.He also completed a degree in media and marketing, although cricket was to be his path.He then eventually made a name for himself with the Dolphins, and became a regular for the CSA 4-Day series first-class side in 2016/17, where he initially made his mark as a batter. He then put more focus on bowling and later completed the shift that turned him into a genuine all-rounder. That growth earned him a place in South Africa’s 2019 Test squad, where he dismissed Virat Kohli for his first scalp on debut in Visakhapatnam.In Guwahati, Muthusamy showed the full extent of that evolution. Patient early on and selective through the morning, he was in firm in control by the time he reached three figures. His knock, built on discipline rather than risk, ensured South Africa dictated terms through the session and kept India searching for answers as the Test moved deeper into Day 2.His ton also meant that he is the third South African batter to score a Test century from number 7 or lower against India. Quinton de Kock (111 in Visakhapatnam, 2019) and Lance Klusener (102* in Cape Town, 1997) were the other two to achieve this feat.Shortly after the final session of the day resumed, his magic run ended, with Mohammed Siraj dismissing him in his first ball after lunch, as Muthusamy holed one out to Jaiswal at fine-leg.","Senuran Muthusamy scored his maiden Test century on Day 2 of the Guwahati Test.

The Georgia football program’s string of driving-related incidents continues



The Georgia football program is once again under the microscope after another driving-related arrest involving one of its players, extending a troubling pattern that has now surpassed 20 incidents in less than two years. Georgia offensive lineman Nyier Daniels was arrested Sunday morning and remains incarcerated at the time of this writing. The timing was striking, given that Daniels had just appeared in his third game of the season during Georgia’s 35 to 3 win over Charlotte on Saturday, logging 10 snaps for the Bulldogs. The redshirt freshman, once a highly regarded recruit, now finds his future in complete uncertainty.Online jail records indicate Daniels is facing three felony and 10 misdemeanor charges following his arrest by Commerce Police at 10 a.m. Sunday. Among the listed charges were two felony second degree cruelty to children charges and a felony fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer. The misdemeanor charges include stop and yield sign violations, reckless driving, and improper passing. The University of Georgia acknowledged the arrest publicly, stating, “We are aware of the charges and are currently in the process of gathering additional information.This is a pending legal matter and we will not have further comment at this time,” team spokesman Steven Drummond told the outlet.Daniels was ranked as a promising talent out of Bergen Catholic in New Jersey, and the expectations around him grew after early season participation that included 12 snaps in the opener against Marshall and nine more against Austin Peay. But DawgsHQ has reported that Daniels is no longer with the team, and the separation appears consistent with recent disciplinary moves from head coach Kirby Smart.Earlier this year, Smart indefinitely suspended receiver Nitro Tuggle and offensive lineman Marquis Easley after separate driving-related arrests. The gravity of these incidents carries heavy weight at Georgia, especially in light of the 2023 fatal crash that killed offensive lineman Devin Willock and recruiting staffer Chandler LeCroy after it was alleged LeCroy was racing defensive tackle Jalen Carter.The most recent arrest threatens to reignite national scrutiny at a critical moment. Georgia is preparing for a postseason run, and staying clear of off-field disruptions will be vital for continuity and focus. With the Bulldogs preparing to take on Georgia Tech in their ""Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate"" rivalry game at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, attention now shifts to how the program enforces accountability and ensures player conduct aligns with the standards expected in Athens.Also Read: Taylor Swift celebrates wild Chiefs overtime win after Travis Kelce’s wiped-out touchdown fuels dramatic Week 12 chaos","Georgia offensive lineman Nyier Daniels was arrested Sunday morning and remains incarcerated at the time of this writing.

'Objective Is To Destroy The Enemy': Op Sindoor Echoes As Indian Army Vows Stronger Response to Pak

BAGESHWAR: A major security alert was sounded in Almora district after 161 gelignite sticks, over 20 kg of highly explosive material, were recovered from bushes near two schools in the Salt area.As the recovery came days after nearly 2,900 kg of explosive materials allegedly part of the terror plot behind the blast near Delhi's Red Fort were seized in Haryana, district authorities launched a massive operation with dog squads and forensic teams combing the area.Police said the gelignite sticks were first spotted by school children on Thursday when they went into the bushes to look for their cricket ball and found the explosives stacked there.After school authorities alerted police, a team from Bhikiyasain carried out the recovery on Friday. An FIR was registered against unknown persons under section 4(A) of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908, and BNS section 288 (negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance).""Samples have been collected, and a detailed probe is underway to identify who brought the gelatin rods and for what purpose,"" Almora SSP Devendra Pincha told TOI.He added that the material is commonly used for stone-breaking in road construction, though police were ""investigating all angles.""Dabhra village head Arjun Singh said the location suggested the material may have been left behind by workers involved in a PMGSY road project completed in the village last year. ""The workers' camp was just 30m from where the explosives were found. It is possible the material was brought for breaking hard rock and later abandoned after becoming unusable,"" he told TOI.On Saturday morning, Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) personnel and additional police units also joined the operation. Teams from the bomb disposal unit, local intelligence unit (LIU) and the Indian Reserve Battalion (IRB) carried out a combing operation in the forested area, bushes, school campus and nearby footpaths to ensure no additional material remained.Forensic experts were conducting a second round of testing on Sat to trace the source and nature of the gelatin sticks. Investigators had mapped the spot and collected soil samples and other evidence from multiple locations.SSP Pincha said the explosives will be disposed of safely after court approval."," 161 gelignite sticks, over 20 kg of highly explosive material, recovered from bushes near two schools in the Salt area.

Andrew Windsor Slammed For 'No Response' Over Epstein-Links Interview Letter From U.S.

Daily Mail

Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York

Mirror





Britain's former prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has been spotted in public for the first time since being stripped of his royal titles and asked to leave the Royal Lodge, marking a rare outing amid ongoing scrutiny over his past associations with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Birminghamreported.The former Duke of York was photographed horse-riding on the Windsor estate, an outing that royal experts say has drawn mixed feelings from his neighbours, Prince William and Princess Kate. The couple, who recently moved into the Grade II-listed Forest Lodge just a few miles from Andrew, are reportedly maintaining a sense of responsibility for his welfare despite ongoing family tensions.Former prince Andrew has faced growing pressure over his links to Epstein. In a statement, he said, “I vigorously deny the accusations against me.” Meanwhile, his failure to respond to the US House Oversight and Government Reform Committee’s interview request has drawn criticism from its members, who are conducting their own inquiry into Epstein’s associates. According to, Democratic committee members recently wrote to Andrew requesting a transcribed interview regarding his long-standing association with Epstein, but he has yet to comply, fueling mounting frustration.Speaking to the, former BBC Royal correspondent Jennie Bond noted, “While there is no love lost between William, Catherine and Andrew, my understanding is that they, and the rest of the royal family, believe they still have a duty of care for his welfare and mental health. Andrew has reportedly become isolated, depressed, and solitary. It’s not his fault if photographers are ready to pounce when he ventures out, and I don’t think the Prince and Princess would begrudge him a ride around the park for some fresh air.Andrew is preparing to leave the Royal Lodge after more than two decades and move to a smaller residence on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk, a change that experts say will ease tensions for the Prince and Princess of Wales. “Obviously it would be more convenient if it wasn’t on their doorstep, but they know this is temporary,” Bond added.Royal commentators suggest that King Charles may be displeased with the publicity surrounding Andrew’s outing. Bond said, “It is unfortunate that pictures of Andrew are in the press again, drawing attention away from the work the rest of the family are doing. It would be preferable if he were seen engaging in charity work or some other productive activity.”A royal insider told thethat the photographs of Andrew riding on Windsor Castle grounds, which are taxpayer-funded, do not present a favourable image.Prince William is believed to have played a key role in the decision to remove Andrew’s titles. Andrew Lownie, author of the biography, told the, “From what I know of him and his father, William would have played quite an active role in stiffening Charles’ resolve. Andrew’s voluntary surrender of titles was deemed insufficient, and Charles realised the gravity of the situation, particularly after continued press coverage distracted from other royal duties.”Kate Middleton is believed to have fully supported King Charles III’s decision, distancing from Andrew in bid to protect the monarchy’s reputation. Lownie added, “They do not want further reputational damage from being linked to him.”","Britain's former prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has been spotted in public for the first time since being stripped of his royal titles.

Patrick Beverley’s abuse allegation puts his Barstool career in danger

The former Los Angeles Clippers player, Patrick Beverley, is all over the internet due to his felony charges against his sister. According to TMZ Sports, Beverly allegedly punched and choked his sister, Mya Beverley, after he found her with an 18-year-old man late at night. The situation worsened after he abused her and grabbed her by the neck. However, an American businessman, Dave Portnoy, hinted that he might cut Beverley out of Barstool Sports only if the allegations were proven to be true.Patrick Beverley has a podcast with the company, “Hooping’ N Hollerin”. But the real question is: How far is he going to be a part of the company, and what happens if he gets kicked out of it? Well, according to his sister, Mya, Patrick Beverley committed a felony, and he was arrested and booked for felony charges.According to the reports published by TMZ Sports, Beverley is now under arrest. Dave Portnoy said, “We'll let the facts play out”. “Certainly, with what is hanging there, we can't have him be part of what we're doing right now, and we got to see how it settles, but this is horrible. If there's any truth to it, he won't be back at Barstool”, Portnoy added further.Based on what Portnoy has heard, he confirmed that there is absolutely no reason why they should take a rash decision about Beverley’s career.But, from what they saw in the documents, things are going to get ugly and intense, in short, “brutal”. Portnoy also confirmed that he and Beverley spoke on the phone after the story was brought to the surface by his 15-year-old sister.His sister said, “Beverley grabbed her by the neck and with both hands, and picked her up off the ground, by having her feet come up from the floor”. He even pushed her body against the wall of an open room in their house. Moreover, Beverley gave her a death threat, saying he would be the family relative to kill her.Patrick Beverley has a court hearing next month. While his lawyers and legal team have denied the allegations, saying that those were incorrect, one of them said that he would be cleared of all the felony charges in the near future.Also read: Patrick Beverley’s attorney issues statement after accused’s sister drafts affidavit against former NBA player","Former LA Clippers player, Patrick Beverley, has been charged with felony assault.

TikTok star's Father says he wants “pop smoke braids” for Girlalala





Girlalala, whose real name was Maurice Harrison, was a well-known 21-year-old Black transgender TikTok creator from Lauderdale Lakes, Florida. She had many followers online and was loved for her bright smile and fun hair videos. She was shot and killed on November 15, 2025, during a fight with her boyfriend, 25-year-old Shanoyd Whyte Jr. After her death, a new family fight began. This fight is not about the case or the police report. It is about how Girlalala should look at her funeral.Her father posted videos on Instagram. In his video, he said he was angry that some people wanted to bury his child with a wig. He said he would not go to the funeral if she was shown that way. His words spread fast online. Many people began talking about respect, gender identity, family choices, and how a loved one should be honored after death. Fans, friends, and LGBTQ+ groups shared their thoughts as the story grew across social media.In his video, Girlalala’s father spoke with strong emotion. He said people were “doing this for the show” and not thinking about his child. He said he loved Girlalala but did not want the funeral to show her in a way that went against “how God gave him.”Because of this, he said he would not attend if she was buried wearing a wig.He added that the public viewing would still be open. Fans could come and say goodbye. But he repeated that he would not join the funeral if a wig was used. He said, “Put my son in some pop smoke braids with a short tape or an afro for the last time.”His comments brought strong reactions. Many LGBTQ+ advocates said that honoring a person’s gender identity after death is very important. They said Girlalala lived proudly as a transgender woman and should be remembered in the same way. Others said families often struggle with grief and identity at the same time.Police records say Shanoyd Whyte Jr. waved down deputies near the scene and showed them the car where Girlalala was found with many gunshot wounds. She was unresponsive. Officers later saw surveillance video of Shanoyd Whyte holding what looked like a gun. He has now been charged with first-degree murder.Also Read: Girlalala Cause Of Death: How Did The TikTok Star Die At Just 21","Girlalala, whose real name was Maurice Harrison, was a well-known Black transgender TikTok creator from Lauderdale Lakes, Florida.

"We cancelled performance, says US aviator after Tejas crash, slams Dubai show organisers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/we-cancelled-performance-says-us-aviator-after-tejas-crash-slams-dubai-show-organisers/articleshow/125525917.cms,"The TOI correspondent from Washington:





Tragedy struck with brutal finality at the Dubai airshow when an Indian Air Force Tejas fighter jet crashed during a negative-G manoeuvre, killing Wing Commander Namansh Syal and plunging the biennial spectacle into grief.Hours later, a heartfelt Instagram post from US F-16 demonstration pilot Taylor ""FEMA"" Hiester cut through the noise, emerging as a stark reminder of the bond that unites aviators across flags and frontiers.Hiester, a captain with US Air Force's Thunderbirds-inspired demo team, was prepping for his own routine when the Tejas went down and erupted in flames. His reflective post - shared with 150,000 followers - captured shock, sorrow and solidarity. He revealed that his team chose to withdraw from their final performance, a rare step in a world driven by tight schedules and multimillion-dollar deals.""Though the show made the shocking decision to continue with the flying schedule, our team along with a few others made the decision to cancel our final performance out of respect to the pilot, his colleagues and family,"" Hiester, 34, wrote.He described walking past the Tejas crew, motionless beside an ""empty parking spot"", ladder still on the ramp, the pilot's belongings untouched in his rental car.""I suppose each of us contemplated their new reality that came in an instant,"" he added - an image that distilled the dread every fighter pilot carries into the cockpit.As the airshow pressed ahead with upbeat announcements, Hiester felt uneasy. Crowds cheered, sponsors were thanked, and a closing line - ""Congratulations to all of our sponsors... we'll see you in 2027"" - clashed sharply with the grief still hanging over the tarmac. ""It was uncomfortable for me for a lot of reasons, some of them selfish,"" he wrote, imagining his own team breaking down their gear amid blaring music and carnival energy.That dissonance became a ""gift"": a reminder that beyond rockstar treatment and sponsor demands, what endures are the teammates who become family, he wrote. ""The people you invest in, the people that you love and the people that love you back... will be the only way you live past your own individual end,"" Hiester concluded.The Texas-born F-16 Viper pilot with over 1,500 flight hours has become an emblem of the global aviator brotherhood - one in which an American ace grieves an Indian pilot with the intimacy of shared skies.Tributes filled forums and pilot circles. ""Humanity and camaraderie is still alive. Long live the brotherhood of men in uniform,"" wrote one user.","Indian Air Force Tejas fighter jet crashed during a negative-G manoeuvre, killing Wing Commander Namansh Syal.

‘Engraved with initials’: Titanic passenger's gold pocket watch sold for 1.78m pounds; memorabilia auction sets new record,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/engraved-with-initials-titanic-passengers-gold-pocket-watch-sold-for-1-78m-pounds-memorabilia-auction-sets-new-record/articleshow/125528456.cms,"Image source: X/@LivesandLores







A gold pocket watch belonging to a Titanic victim sold for a record 1.78 million pounds at an auction in Wiltshire, setting the highest price ever paid for Titanic memorabilia, according to Henry Aldridge & Son.The 18-karat gold watch sold on Saturday belonged to Isidor Straus, the Macy’s co-owner who was travelling first class on the Titanic with his wife, Ida, when it tragically sank in 1912. The piece is engraved with his initials and the date of his 43rd birthday, according to the auction house. The 18-carat Jules Jurgensen watch, gifted to him in 1888, had stopped at 2:20 a.m., the moment the ship disappeared beneath the Atlantic, the auctioneers said.The New York Times reported that the timepiece fetched $2.3 million, surpassing the auction house’s previous record for Titanic artefacts — a pocket watch linked to the Carpathia’s captain, sold in 2024 for $1.9 million.The BBC noted that the Straus watch had remained within the family for generations before being repaired and restored by Straus’s great-grandson, Kenneth Hollister Straus.Straus’s body was recovered roughly two weeks after the disaster, while Ida’s remains were never found.Survivors recalled the couple refusing to be separated as lifeboats were loaded. As The Guardian reported, they were last seen sitting together on deckchairs, choosing to face their fate side by side — a moment later fictionalised in James Cameron’s 1997 film Titanic. The old couple were depicted in James Cameron’s 1997 film “Titanic”, shown lying together as their cabin floods.A letter written by Ida on Titanic stationery, posted while she was on board, also sold at Saturday’s auction for 100,000 pounds according to the BBC, and $131,000 according to The New York Times. In it, she wrote: “What a ship! So huge and so magnificently appointed … they really are rooms.”Other items sold included a Titanic passenger list (104,000 pounds) and a gold medal awarded to the crew of RMS Carpathia (86,000 pounds). The auction totalled 3 million pounds.Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge told the BBC the record price underscored the enduring power of the Titanic story, calling the Strauses “the ultimate love story” and a testament to the lasting respect in which they are held.","The 18-karat gold watch sold on Saturday belonged to Isidor Straus, the Macy’s co-owner who was travelling first class on the Titanic with his wife, Ida.
