NEW DELHI: Pakistan faces a critical juncture in the T20 World Cup , reeling from losses against the USA and India. Their upcoming clash with Canada holds immense significance, as a win is imperative for their Super Eight qualification hopes.With a Super Over defeat against the USA and a six-run loss to India, Pakistan's campaign has been marred by inconsistency and a lack of cohesion. Their chances now rest on securing comprehensive victories against Canada and Ireland, while also relying on other results to favour them.Pakistan's struggles extend beyond the field, with uncertainties surrounding Babar Azam 's leadership and internal team dynamics adding to their woes. The team's batting lineup, in particular, has faltered, with players like Fakhar Zaman and Imad Wasim failing to capitalize on opportunities.Despite notable performances from bowlers like Naseem Shah and Mohammad Amir, Pakistan's bowling attack needs to step up, especially premier fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi, who has yet to make a significant impact.In contrast, Canada has shown resilience, bouncing back from a defeat against the USA to secure a crucial win against Ireland. Led by veteran batter Navneet Dhaliwal, Canada poses a formidable challenge, especially after posting a formidable total of 194 against the USA.As Pakistan looks to salvage their campaign, they face a formidable opponent in Canada, who are determined to maintain their momentum in the tournament.Canada (CAN) and Pakistan (PAK) are gearing up for the 22nd T20 International of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024. Scheduled to be held at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York, the match is set for Tuesday, June 11th, 2024, at 8:00 PM IST.The Nassau County International Cricket Stadium has proven to be challenging for batsmen, with the pitch offering assistance to bowlers throughout the match. Bowlers who can maintain a consistent line and length are likely to find success, particularly fast bowlers who can exploit any uneven bounce and lateral movement.In the five matches played at this venue, the surface has favoured pacers over spinners. Batsmen have found it difficult to read the ball, leading to lower scores. Only Canada and India have managed to win batting first, indicating the advantage of setting a target.With an average first innings score of 106 and an average second innings score of 104, teams winning the toss may opt to field first and chase, considering the trend of successful chases at this ground.After an impressive performance against India, Naseem Shah has emerged as a key player for Pakistan. With three wickets and 10 runs in the last match, he poses a significant threat to opponents, especially if Pakistan bowls first. Consider him as a strong candidate for captain/vice-captain selection in your Dream11 team.Nicholas Kirton showcased his batting prowess with a brilliant 49-run knock in the previous game. With a total of 100 runs in two matches and a striking strike rate of 151.52, he stands out as a valuable asset for Canada. His consistency with the bat makes him an excellent choice for captain/vice-captain in your fantasy team.Known for his consistency, Pakistani wicketkeeper-batter Mohammad Rizwan is a reliable run-scorer. Despite a quiet start against the USA, he bounced back with a crucial 31-run innings against India. With his ability to anchor the innings, Rizwan is a dependable pick for your fantasy team.Saad Bin Zafar (captain), Aaron Johnson, Ravinderpal Singh, Navneet Dhaliwal, Kaleem Sana, Dilon Heyliger, Jeremy Gordon, Nikhil Dutta, Pargat Singh, Nicholas Kirton, Rayyankhan Pathan, Junaid Siddiqui, Dilpreet Bajwa, Shreyas Movva and Rishiv Joshi.Babar Azam (c), Abrar Ahmed, Azam Khan, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Iftikhar Ahmed, Imad Wasim, Mohammad Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Rizwan, Naseem Shah, Saim Ayub, Shadab Khan, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Usman KhanWicketkeepers: Mohammad Rizwan(c), Shreyas MovvaBatters: Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Nicholas KirtonAll-Rounders: Imad Wasim, Dillon HeyligerBowlers: Jeremy Gordon, Shaheen Afridi(vc), Naseem Shah, Mohammad Amir","Pakistan face Canada in the 22nd T20 International of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024.

How does cricket's popularity fare in the USA, a nation renowned for its passion for NBA, Baseball, and NFL?

Could you highlight two pivotal players from the Indian squad?

Your India connection?

Who is your inspiration and why?

Could you share insights from your meeting with batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar and the legendary Shane Warne?

Were the USA confident of causing upsets against major teams, similar to their performance against Pakistan?

NEW DELHI: USA all-rounder Nisarg Patel was a mere 18 years old when he travelled to Sri Lanka for the Under-19 World Cup in 2006. The tournament had prominent players from various nations, including the likes of current Indian captain Rohit Sharma and star all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja .The USA team, placed in Group B with Australia, the West Indies, and South Africa, played three matches but unfortunately lost all of them, leading to an early exit from the tournament.Despite the disappointing outcome, Nisarg had the opportunity to meet the entire Indian squad, exchanging greetings with Rohit and Jadeja before returning to the United States.Now, 18 years later, Nisarg, who is part of the senior USA team, is eagerly anticipating a reunion with Rohit and Jadeja.India and the USA are set to face off in their ICC T20 World Cup 2024 match at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York on Wednesday.With two wins in two matches, India are well placed to make the Super Eights, while the USA will have to win one of the two remaining matches - vs India or Ireland - to move to the next stage of the mega event.caught up with Nisarg, who played 41 ODIs and 21 T20Is for the USA so far and spoke about meeting young Rohit and Jadeja during the U-19 World Cup, cricket in the US, drop-in pitches, clash against India, and much more...We are very excited. We have a big opportunity to represent the US on such a grand stage. There's nothing bigger for players than representing their country in the World Cup, and we are doing just that. We have the chance to play against big teams - Pakistan and now India. We have played against Ireland many times and also against Canada. But this is a different experience altogether. This is special for us.People have come in huge numbers to witness our matches. There is a lot of buzz. It is an opportunity to bring the whole community together. As players, we just want to go and play cricket and enjoy every moment. That's it. It's the first time we have got the opportunity to play in such a big event like this, and we are giving our best. All I want to say is that we all (the US team) are enjoying our cricket. US cricket is doing really well.I don't specifically target players. As a player, I love to contribute to my team's victory. It's a very short format game. Whether it's keeping it tight, bowling good overs, taking crucial wickets, putting brakes on runs, scoring runs, inflicting runouts, or keeping a batsman in check, I just love it. Obviously, I'd love to dismiss Virat Kohli or take Rohit's wicket. But it all depends on when I'll be bowling - in the Powerplay or after. I thrive in all situations. I met and interacted with Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja during the 2006 U19 World Cup and now look forward to meeting them again.Rohit Sharma. He can perform anywhere. And in bowling, none other than Bumrah. Give him any condition or situation, he will take wickets and win you the match. He's that type of player.My cricketing journey started in India. I was born in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, and studied in a boarding school in Vapi. I played most of my cricket in Ahmedabad before relocating to the US in 2003. I began playing cricket in the US and received my first major opportunity to represent the USA in the Under-19 World Cup in Sri Lanka in 2006. I had the chance to compete against teams like Australia and South Africa, facing players such as David Warner, Aaron Finch, Matthew Wade, and many more. During the World Cup, I had the privilege of meeting and interacting with Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja as well. Experiencing international cricket at such a young age was invaluable. Subsequently, I was selected for the senior USA team and have since played around 70-80 matches for them. I aspire to continue representing the USA team for as long as possible.I started playing during the era of Sachin Tendulkar , Sourav Ganguly, and Rahul Dravid. Initially, I admired Dada (Ganguly). He was my inspiration and a true leader. As time passed, I witnessed the era of players like MS Dhoni, Yuvraj Singh, and Virat Kohli. I greatly admire MS Dhoni. I appreciate the way he conducts himself on and off the field, how he handles players, and his ability to turn matches with his batting prowess. He is simply amazing and incredibly down-to-earth. He has contributed immensely to cricket.In cricket, being an all-rounder, I look up to Ravindra Jadeja. I play a similar role to him, being a left-arm spinner and a middle-order batsman. I closely watch and follow his game. I am eagerly looking forward to meeting him.When the Legends Masters League took place in the USA, the great Shane Warne and the legendary Sachin Tendulkar were part of that league. We had the opportunity to meet them and learn valuable cricket lessons. I served as a net bowler in that league, bowling to the likes of Tendulkar, Ricky Ponting, Matthew Hayden, and many other legendary players. I learned a lot from their experiences.I've never played on drop-in pitches before. This is our first time. All I've heard is that they are true wickets. They benefit everyone—spinners, fast bowlers, batsmen. All we've heard is that these are true wickets and really exciting ones.We were confident, especially with the team we have. We are a balanced side with experienced players who can perform under any situation and condition. They can handle pressure and win us games. It's not easy to perform on a big stage, especially in front of a jam-packed stadium, but our team knows how to handle it. They know how to perform in any situation.","Nisarg Patel was a mere 18 years old when he travelled to Sri Lanka for the Under-19 World Cup in 2006.

's team chance to smooth out some rough edges

T20 WORLD CUP

NEW YORK: The difficult part has been dealt with. India's first hurdle - qualification to the Super8s - looks like a formality now.The win against Pakistan on Sunday at the Nassau County ground underlined the depth that this Indian team has, and on paper, the Wednesday game against minnows USA shouldn't be a matter of concern.But is it that straight-forward? There's a little bit more to this United States team that we knew of. It's a group built around players who might have dreamt that one day they would play for India. For the likes of Saurabh Netrawalkar , Monank Patel, Nitish Kumar or Harmeet Singh, their primary goal might not have been successful. But the land of opportunities has given them a second chance and it seems all of them are determined to make the most of it.A USA victory against Pakistan in Dallas a few days ago was one of the biggest upsets of the tournament so far and now there's suddenly a bit more in the offing. When the tournament started, they wouldn't have given themselves a chance to make the Super-8s, but now it is a realistic possibility. Two more points will help them seal that trip to West Indies, but for a team that is not used to winning, the fear of the finish line sometimes becomes the biggest impediment.Against India though, they're not supposed to win and that should unshackle them just a little bit. Add to that the pitch at the Nassau County ground, where anything is possible.After the low-scoring rollercoaster that was the India-Pakistan game, the drop-in pitch at the new venue made Bangladesh on Monday appear way more threatening against South Africa than they would have seemed in flatter conditions, even though the Proteas were finally able to deal with the challenge.For the likes of USA pacers Ali Khan, a former Kolkata Knight Riders player, Nosthush Kenjige or Netravalkar, winning the toss may open up a great chance to test the Indian greats.USA's biggest test will come if the toss goes against them. The Indian pace quartet - led by the magnificent Jasprit Bumrah - has too much variety and quality in its arsenal for the hosts, especially on a helpful pitch. ""USA looked very well-organised and the way they stood up to that Pakistan attack in Dallas, one of the best bowling units at the World Cup, you have to give them huge kudos.

The team would ideally prefer Virat Kohli and Shivam Dube to hit a bit of form. While Kohli has batted in both games so far at the most difficult times and the practice sessions suggest that it is a matter of time before he comes good, time might be running out for Dube.India have come here with certain plans and now that the Pakistan game is out of the way, skipper Rohit Sharma's aim will be to fine-tune those rough edges so that the machine runs smoothly when it matters most.",India's first hurdle - qualification to the Super8s - looks like a formality now.

NEW DELHI: At the tender age of 18, Saurabh Netravalkar 's fervent aspiration was to represent India at the pinnacle of international cricket . Although that dream remained unfulfilled, at 32, he now finds himself presented with an extraordinary opportunity to bowl against his nation of birth at the prestigious Twenty20 World Cup.When the teams clash on Wednesday at Long Island's Nassau County International Stadium, a billion ardent cricket enthusiasts back in India will be watching the left-arm United States pacer with bated breath.Indian broadcaster Star Sports has already commenced promoting the encounter as an epic showdown between Mumbai-born Netravalkar and another U.S. player of Indian lineage, Alabama-born Nosthush Kenjige , pitted against India's illustrious batters Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli .Despite being the tournament favorite, India will approach the match with cautious optimism, having witnessed the U.S. orchestrate a stunning upset in world cricket by vanquishing Pakistan on Thursday.Netravalkar did indeed showcase his skills at the junior level for India. He was among the select group of 15 players who proudly donned the Indian colors at the Under-19 World Cup in 2009-10, alongside the likes of KL Rahul, who emerged as the most prominent name from that squad. Mayank Agarwal, Harshal Patel, Jaydev Unadkat, and Mandeep Singh also went on to make their mark on the international stage and secured lucrative Indian Premier League contracts.For most Indian youngsters, achieving such heights in cricket is the ultimate aspiration. However, when those dreams remain unfulfilled, the majority find themselves grappling with the absence of a contingency plan.Netravalkar, on the other hand, had a well-defined strategy in place.With unwavering determination, he embarked on a journey to the U.S., where he pursued a master's degree in computer engineering at the prestigious Cornell University in 2015.A decade later, Netravalkar's prowess with the ball propelled his team to a thrilling Super Over victory against former champions Pakistan.Similarly, Kenjige's path to success was paved with challenges. Despite failing to secure a contract in a local T20 league in Karnataka, India, he ventured to the U.S. to further his education while nurturing his cricketing ambitions. His perseverance paid off as Kenjige claimed three crucial wickets against Pakistan, showcasing his crafty left-arm spin.American batter Aaron Jones charted a slightly different course. He honed his skills in Barbados, playing alongside West Indies stalwarts Nicholas Pooran and Jason Holder before making his way north to spearhead the U.S. charge.Jones set the tournament ablaze on opening day, amassing a scintillating 94 off a mere 40 deliveries as the U.S. effortlessly chased down Canada's formidable total of 194.India and the U.S. currently sit atop Group A, having secured two victories apiece.The U.S. requires just one more win in its remaining two fixtures—against India and Ireland—to cement its place in the Super Eight. Such an achievement would mark a significant milestone for the sport in the country and wholly vindicate the ICC's bold decision to grant co-hosting rights to the U.S..India, on the other hand, is acutely aware that one more victory will guarantee its progression to the next round.","Saurabh Netravalkar and Nosthush Kenjige will face each other at the T20 World Cup.

When India take the field on Wednesday, there will be some familiar faces in the USA camp. For example, Suryakumar Yadav will square up against his age-group Mumbai teammate Saurabh Netravalkar, while Rishabh Pant will have a chance to catch up with Delhi's Milind Kumar , who has seen Pant grow at the Sonnet Club.USA's competitive show in the ongoing T20 World Cup - which has seen them become surprise table-toppers with India - has caught everyone's attention.This American cricket dream started taking shape in 2020-21. While the squad still has players like Netravalkar, who started out as amateurs in the US circuit, it was the influx of professionals through Major League Cricket (MLC) and mushrooming local tournaments that raised the level of cricket.This was despite the infrastructure being nowhere close to professional standards. ""In 2020-21, a lot of us who were still playing first-class cricket in our respective countries were offered contracts by MLC to move to the USA and earn a living as cricket professionals,"" Milind told TOI from New York.Milind, who hit a century for Delhi on his Ranji Trophy debut in 2011, had recorded the highest number of runs in a Ranji season while playing for Sikkim after falling out of favour with Delhi. He now represents the Texas Super Kings team in the MLC.The likes of Unmukt Chand, Harmeet Singh and New Zealand's Smit Patel also moved at the same time. Corey Anderson from New Zealand and Sami Aslam from Pakistan were other big names to also shift base.For these cricketers, it was a jump into the unknown. MLC was yet to be launched. They were allotted teams in different states to play in the Minor League Cricket . The deal was simple. They were awarded visas on terms that they would be working for the development of cricket in the US. The base price of a contract was $50,000 a year.""We work at academies around the country. When we are not playing, we are coaching. Most of the kids have origins in the Indian subcontinent. We are not allowed to take up any other job. This is our job. When we moved here, we never thought about playing a World Cup for USA. But things happened and we have enjoyed our time here,"" Milind said.Professionalism is still a distant goal. The minor league is played in makeshift grounds which are mostly public parks. There is no concept of a coaching staff in those teams and playing XIs are largely picked by the promoters of the clubs.How did this competitive edge come into their cricket, which saw them rout Bangladesh in the lead up to the World Cup before defeating Pakistan? Milind laughed: ""We know these Pakistani players very well. We play with them.""He added: ""A lot of short private tournaments are played here. The promoters have been bringing active international cricketers like Mohammed Amir, Azam Khan , Shai Hope, Oshane Thomas and Martin Guptill to play in these tournaments for a few years. Playing with international players is not new to us. Azam is a good friend. We have learned so much from them.""According to Milind, there's now a certain awareness about the sport. Cricket gear and equipment is easily available, curators around the country have started understanding the art of making a pitch. But he asserted that there's no culture of pleasing the bigger names to get into the USA team.""Even Anderson has had to earn his spot. Aslam, who had played for Pakistan, was not picked because he didn't perform as well. The country has just two stadiums but it seems like a good beginning,"" Milind said.","USA's competitive show in the ongoing T20 World Cup has caught everyone's attention.

NEW DELHI: The United States national cricket team has already made a significant impact in the game's hierarchy by defeating Pakistan last week at the 2024 T20 World Cup , a remarkable feat considering the sport's relative obscurity in America compared to the fervor it generates in countries like England, where it originated.Cricket, with its unique terminology and gameplay, bears a passing resemblance to baseball, but the differences are stark, from the purposeful bouncing of the ball by the pitcher to the scoring of runs.This year, the United States is witnessing the sport up close as the T20 World Cup unfolds across various venues in New York, Texas, Florida, and the Caribbean. The U.S. team, with a history dating back to at least 1844, is set to face India on Wednesday in Long Island, a match that will likely draw a passionate crowd from the South Asian diaspora.Despite the expected support for India, the American team , comprising players with roots in cricket hotbeds such as India, Pakistan, South Africa, and the Caribbean, remains undaunted. Aaron Jones , the team's top batter, expressed excitement at the prospect of playing against the best in the world, including Indian stars Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma .""I think the crowd will be supporting both teams, to be honest,"" Jones said Tuesday. ""We have a lot of Indian players on our team as well. So, I think the crowd will be supporting both teams.""The United States' victory against Pakistan was unexpected, but it has positioned them well in the tournament. A win against India would further solidify their standing, but even a loss would not eliminate them from contention. The team's focus remains on the match at hand, with the goal of advancing to the Super 8 stage of the competition.""With cricket being one of the biggest sports in the world, it’s only a matter of time before the majority of people come on board as it relates to American born and raised people,"" Jones said. ""I think America is a place where people love sports and obviously this World Cup is going to open the eyes of a lot of people, and then in a few years obviously with cricket being in the Olympics, that’s a very big thing as well.""As cricket gains momentum in the United States, with its inclusion in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics and the establishment of the Major League Cricket professional circuit, the sport is poised for a resurgence in the country.The T20 World Cup serves as a platform to showcase the talent and potential of the U.S. team, and their success could be instrumental in garnering support and enthusiasm for cricket among American-born and raised individuals.","The United States national cricket team has already made a significant impact in the game's hierarchy.

Pakistan, chasing a modest target of 120 runs, fell short by 7 runs, ending their innings at 113 for 7.The team consumed an astonishing 59 dot balls during their chase. Wasim scored only 15 runs in 23 balls with the help of one boundary.In response to these accusations, Australia legend Adam Gilchrist took a swipe at the notion of accusing a player of deliberately underperforming in a match that resulted in a loss.""A bunch of ex-Pakistan cricketers haven't missed their teams, at all.

Gareth Southgate , who has been the manager of the England national football team since 2016, believes that the upcoming European Championship in Germany could be his final opportunity to secure a major trophy for his country.The 53-year-old has had a successful tenure as the Three Lions' coach, leading them to impressive achievements in recent years.Under Southgate's guidance, England reached the final of Euro 2020 and also secured a third-place finish in the 2019 Nations League.Despite rumors linking him to Manchester United , the former Middlesbrough coach has emphasized his unwavering commitment to the national team. However, with his current contract set to expire in December, the European Championship in Germany might be his last chance to make a significant impact with England.""If we don't win, I probably won't be here anymore. Then it might be the last chance,"" Southgate told German newspaper BILD. ""I think about half the national team coaches leave after a tournament — that's the nature of international football.""I've been here for almost eight years now and we've been close. So I know that you can't keep standing in front of the public and saying, 'A little bit more please', because at some point, people lose faith in your message.""If we want to be a great team and I want to be a top coach, then you have to deliver in the big moments.""England will commence their journey in Group C as they face off against Serbia in their opening match on Sunday.

High hopes of qualification to the third round of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers for the first time have almost evaporated after India picked up just two points from their last two games against lower-ranked Afghanistan (draw away, loss at home), and a home draw against Kuwait last week.A win would have provided the perfect ending to Chhetri’s stellar international career and taken India to the third round. Instead, to be certain of booking their spot in the next round, India are now faced with an uphill task of winning the concluding group clash against Asian champions Qatar at the Jassim bin Hamad Stadium in Doha on Tuesday.India are tied on five points with Afghanistan. Kuwait are one adrift, but India have a superior goal difference. A win will be enough, but given that Stimac’s side have not scored a single open-field goal in seven matches, three points against Qatar seems like a difficult ask.“We are trying not to think about Sunil not being there,” Stimac said at the pre-match media interaction. “This is such an important game. There are 90 minutes ahead of us, a fantastic opportunity to make Indians across the world happy. We will die on the pitch, if needed.”Having already made it to the next round, Qatar did not pick a host of star players in their squad, instead opting for several under-23 players. They were held goalless by Afghanistan with a stubborn performance.Stimac could probably draw some hope from Afghanistan’s performance. If the teams end in a draw, India will need the Kuwait vs Afghanistan match to also end in astalemate.","India are tied on five points with Afghanistan.

""Your body completely shuts down when you have a break, because we're made to just play all the time.""When we have a rest, our body shuts down and it's hard to get going again.

She faced off against Elise Mertens , the fourth seed, in the second round of the Libema Open and emerged triumphant in straight sets.From the outset, Osaka showcased her dominance, securing two breaks against the Belgian in the opening set. Her serve remained impenetrable, allowing her to clinch the set with a score of 6-2.The subsequent set proved to be a more tightly contested affair, with both players holding serve until the tenth game.Osaka's fortune smiled upon her as a favorable net cord, coupled with a pair of formidable groundstrokes, presented her with two opportunities to seal the match. She capitalized on the first chance, claiming the second set 6-4 and securing her advancement to the next round.""I think it's maybe four or five years since I last played on grass but I'm super excited to be here,"" Osaka said after the match.""I don't really have much experience on grass but to be able to close it out in two is something I'm very happy about,"" added the 26-year-old.Osaka, the former world No. 1, is currently ranked 125th globally.

The 21-year-old sets up points, creates openings, and goes for high-risk shots; the stage of the match if he’s leading or trailing is irrelevant. Drop shots that skim the net, racy winners that go around the pole and outrageous forehands. He can run a marathon and win a sprint.The Spaniard plays every shot in the book and thinks up new ones on the run. He smiles during matches, sometimes dazzled by his own brilliance, other times in disbelief. An expression that says, why? Not really.Alcaraz, who won his third Grand Slam title on Sunday, his first at Roland Garros , is 11-1 in five-set matches. Against Alexander Zverev in the final of the French Open and world No.1 Jannik Sinner in the semifinals, Alcaraz motored from a 1-2 deficit in sets, not by keeping the ball in play, but by going for his shots. And like his last two opponents, Alcaraz was also running on reserve in the fourth and fifth sets, but he understood the only way he was crossing that finish line first was by winning it, not waiting for it.“He’s a beast. He’s an animal,” Zverev said of the 21-year-old. “The intensity he plays with is different to other people.”Alcaraz’s long-time coach Juan Carlos Ferrero talks as fast as the Spaniard charges the court, the duo is quite the vibe. Ferrero hurls instructions at the dynamo in the middle that leaves one wondering if he’s actually reminding Alcaraz of the defense they may have practiced a 1000 times.“I’m trying just to be aggressive, to go for it, play my style -- go to the net, dropshots, hitting big shots,” said Alcaraz . “If I lose it, if I miss it, my feelings are really good. If I lose, it doesn’t matter if I miss it, because when I go for it, the feelings are much better than if I go defensive and lose. My team is telling me to go for it.”Alcaraz is at No.2 in the rankings now which spreads the field for the new guard at Wimbledon, with Sinner and Alcaraz likely bookending the draw.“My game suits very well for every surface because I practice it (like that),” Alcaraz said. “I wanted to develop my style of being aggressive all the time, practicing the defense and all that stuff...but my main goal is being aggressive as much as I can. On grass, I have to play like that almost every time, but on all surfaces too.”Alcaraz — the youngest man to win a Grand Slam on three different surfaces after his triumphs on hard courts at the 2022 US Open and grass at 2023 Wimbledon – put a number against his achievements.“Obviously winning the US Open, when I reached for the first time the No. 1 ranking, is something that I dreamt of since I started playing tennis , getting my first Grand Slam was pretty special,” Alcaraz said. “But the way that I won Wimbledon, beating Novak Djokovic in five sets, has been a great achievement for me.”“Right now, lifting the Roland Garros trophy, knowing everything that I have been through the last month with the injuries...” he said. “Probably this one is the moment that I’m really proud of myself, because of everything that I have done the last month just to be ready for this tournament with my team. It has been really difficult for me.”“So I’m going to say that this one, Roland Garros,” he said, looking up at the packed media room, “is the one I’m most proud about.""","Carlos Alcaraz is the youngest man to win a Grand Slam on three different surfaces.
