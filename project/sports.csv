David Montgomery: Return from Knee Injury



Terrion Arnold: Full Go After Foot Injury



A Big Boost for the Lions



Well, things are starting to look a bit brighter for the Detroit Lions, especially going into the stretch part of the season. Today's estimated practice has brought in the return of two major players and that gives lots of things for fans to cheer about.It's a huge boost for the Lions' offense to have David Montgomery, the star running back who had been dealing with a knee injury, be listed as a full participant in practice today. Montgomery has been such a key player in the team's running game this season. His ability to participate fully in practice signals that he's recovering well and could be back to his usual form sooner than what is perceived.His return will provide a boost for the Lions backfield, considering he has always been a dependable workhorse who has accumulated much yardage and touchdowns. More importantly, his aggressive running style and ability to break tackles make him one of the brightest stars on the team. This can further add more dynamism into Detroit's scheme and relieve the pressure off of the passing game for quarterback Jared Goff.The Lions have had to rely heavily on their passing attack for the last few games, but Montgomery returning gives them the chance to mix things up and control the clock. Having Montgomery healthy may make all the difference to take their offense to another level with a shot at making the playoffs.On the defensive side of the ball, cornerback Terrion Arnold was also listed as a full participant after dealing with a foot injury. Having Arnold back to full health is just as important for the Lions' defense, as he has been a steady contributor in the secondary. With the defensive backfield being such an important part of the Lions' defense, the return of key player Arnold should only add depth to the Lions.Arnold's return is especially important given the Lions' defensive woes at the start of the season. With his speed and ability to cover ground quickly, Arnold can help shore up the secondary and provide more stability against both the pass and run. His return is timely as the Lions are set to face some high-powered offenses in the coming weeks, and having their top cornerback healthy is a major asset in those matchups.With Montgomery and Arnold now participating fully in practice, the Lions are set for a huge boost in both offense and defense. Montgomery's return brings much-needed stability in the running game, while the presence of Arnold in the secondary helps solidify the defensive unit.As the Lions go into their upcoming games, the presence of players such as Montgomery and Arnold in action will give them an upper hand on performing at the best of their abilities. At the moment, the team is in a great position to run for the playoffs, and the chances of this team making it to the postseason have just gone up because of their offense and defense getting even stronger.The Depth and Overall Health of the Lions were gigantic factors for this recent success and now with both Montgomery and Arnold returning fully, they can begin the crucial portion of the season ready to bring it all home.Also read - The Most Expensive NFL Game (Excluding Super Bowls): Ticket Prices Soar for Lions vs. Commanders, Get-In Price Starts at $588","Detroit Lions running back David Montgomery and cornerback Terrion Arnold were both listed as full participants in practice today.

Why does Bradley Beal fits the Golden State Warriors?

What does the Suns’ front office has to say about the trade?

Theare reportedly considering a fantastic trade forin a bid to salvage their season and improve their title odds. With a 19-20 record and sitting 12th in the Western Conference, the Warriors have struggled to maintain their form after a hot 12-3 start. The potential trade could strengthen their roster and push the team for their fifth NBA championship. Stephen Curry has been the backbone of the Golden State Warriors’ offense this season, but the supporting cast has failed to deliver consistently. This has left the Warriors ranking in the middle of the league with an average of 111.0 points per game. The absence of Klay Thompson, who departed in the offseason, has further weakened the team’s offensive firepower. The situation has raised concerns about the Warriors' playoff prospects, and the front office appears ready to shake things up.Bradley Beal, the Phoenix Suns’ $251 million guard, has emerged as a key trade target for Golden State. Beal, once a cornerstone of the Suns' starting lineup, was recently benched due to compatibility issues with Kevin Durant and Devin Booker. A trade could be on the horizon, provided Beal waives his no-trade clause.In a potential deal, the Golden State Warriors might send Andrew Wiggins, Kyle Anderson, Buddy Hield, and Jonathan Kuminga to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Beal and Mason Plumlee. The Warriors could also receive draft assets due to the massive financial commitment tied to Bradley Beal's contract.Both teams benefit from this transaction. The Warriors would gain a fantastic scoring guard and a much-needed centre, while the Suns would improve their squad by splitting up their big three.Bradley Beal is averaging 17.7 points per game this season—a dip compared to previous years—but a new environment alongside Curry could reignite his offensive potential. His scoring ability and versatility would make him a valuable addition to the Warriors’ roster. Beal struggled in the Suns lineup because they lacked a genuine point guard, but he should be able to produce more now that Curry is on his team.While the Warriors would sacrifice depth in the proposed trade, the potential upside of pairing Beal with Curry is significant. The duo could form a new iteration of the “Splash Brothers,” giving Golden State the firepower they need to compete with the Western Conference elite.Also read: LA Lakers Trade Rumor: GM Rob Pelinka reportedly wants to pursue $78 million Bulls superstar and part ways with $33 million Heat outcast For the Phoenix Suns , breaking up their underperforming big three could bring much-needed depth and balance to their roster.

If successful, it could catapult them back into championship contention.","Bradley Beal has emerged as a key trade target for the Golden State Warriors.

Career and personal life

Bonnie Blue , a 25-year-old OnlyFans creator from Derbyshire , claims to have set a world record by having sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours, reports Daily Mail.The event took place in London, allegedly surpassing the previous record of 919 men in 24 hours set by adult actress Lisa Sparks in 2004, with Bonnie claiming she ""bedded 1,057 in 12 hours.""In a video shared on TikTok, Bonnie thanked those who participated, saying, “Thank you to all the barely legal, barely breathing and the husbands.”She added that her skin looked better after the event and described the experience: “The room was absolutely full. We did groups of five, like one after the other. It was a rotating circle.”Her PR team confirmed the tally, stating, “She slept with 1,057 people. As she hit 1,000, there were still 57 left in the queue who Bonnie wanted to pleasure before ending the 12-hour day.” Calculations suggest she averaged 41 seconds per partner.The stunt sparked outrage online, with comments such as “How embarrassing” and “Sad that men would want to do that too—all for fame and money.” Bonnie is no stranger to controversy, having previously defended her claims of sleeping with “barely legal” 18-year-olds and encouraging men to cheat on their wives.Bonnie's real name is Tia Billinger , who says she earns up to £750,000 a month from her OnlyFans content. Despite criticism, she insists her work is educational. “I can’t think of one situation where an 18-year-old has had sex where they’ve had to bring a passport, sign consent forms, and do a breathalyser,” she said on ITV’s This Morning.She also addressed criticism for sleeping with married men, arguing, “If wives aren’t going to pleasure husbands, let them go elsewhere. It’s just an act; the husbands mean nothing to me.”Bonnie transitioned to sex work after moving to Australia in 2022 with her now ex-husband, Oliver Davidson. Formerly a recruitment professional, she launched her career as a cam girl and later joined OnlyFans.She claims her family now supports her career, with her mother even assisting her business by booking appointments and handing out condoms for marketing. “It’s changed their life completely for the better,” she said.Bonnie defended her actions, stating, “These 18-year-olds can go to the army, they can drive, they can drink… If they want to use their own bodies to come and sleep with me, that is their decision.”","Bonnie Blue, 25, claims to have had sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours.

Vikings Justin Jefferson is unconcerned who plays for the team next season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/its-not-my-job-vikings-justin-jefferson-is-unconcerned-who-plays-for-the-team-next-season/articleshow/117250161.cms,"Image via Imagn Images

Justin Jefferson doesn't care who plays QB for the Vikings

Following a postseason exit, the Minnesota Vikings have many offseason decisions to come to, with the most urgent being at quarterback. Veteran Sam Darnold , who was putting up a career performance until rookie J.J. McCarthy got hurt, has been terrible the final stretch of the season and even lost in this wild-card round to the Los Angeles Rams.With Darnold either sitting on the bench or leaving for free agency, it is probably going to be handed over to McCarthy, and head coach Kevin O'Connell signaled that in a post-game presser. Whoever they choose, though, at least star wide receiver Justin Jefferson , a key piece of Minnesota's offense, is unconcerned.Minnesota Vikings fans have not had a great end to the season, particularly with their 27-9 loss at the hands of the Los Angeles Rams, which has further intensified chatter surrounding quarterback for the upcoming season with Sam Darnold becoming a free agent and J.J. McCarthy returning from a torn meniscus. Superstar wideout Justin Jefferson chimed in on these discussions.Justin Jefferson believes the decision to choose a quarterback for the 2025 season is based on the coaches' and front office's decision. He believes the offense can work with either McCarthy or Darnold, as he recorded 103 receptions, 1,533 yards, and 10 touchdowns this season with Darnold. Jefferson will continue to trust Kevin O'Connell and general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah in selecting the starting quarterback. Whoever they choose Jefferson is unconcerned.""I didn't know who my quarterback was going to be [after last season], and I really didn't care,"" Jefferson said Monday night, per ESPN. ""At the end of the day, I'll always say that I'm confident in myself to perform the same way I've been performing. But it's not my job to say who is going to be the quarterback or who do I want to be the quarterback. At the end of the day, they're going to figure it out, and whoever they decide to go with, we can work with that.”The Minnesota Vikings were playing the Detroit Lions for the NFC number one seed and first round bye. However, quarterback Darnold's team was not so lucky, losing 31-9 in the game. This led to the same outcome in the NFL's Wild Card round eight days later.The Lions' offense scored nine points in two games, and it was a very poor performance by Darnold on the big stage. He missed multiple easy throws, including touchdowns, and took nine sacks against the Rams. He also had two terrible turnovers, including a fumble-touchdown for the Rams. Despite a great regular season, Darnold's performance in big games is lacking, and it is time to hand over the keys to J.J. McCarthy.Also Read: ESPN announcers Joe Buck and Troy Aikman highlight Sam Darnold's playoff challenges could hurt free agency prospects McCarthy was expected to be the starter after he was taken as a first-round pick in the 2024 draft for the Minnesota Vikings.

Patrick Mahomes praises Travis Kelce for his sportsmanship

The Kansas City Chiefs host the No. 4 seeded Houston Texans in a divisional-round contest. Patrick Mahomes has not seen action since Week 17, as he's sitting out in Week 18. The Chiefs' No. 1 unit will look to begin their playoff campaign on the right note after receiving a first-round bye. Mahomes has stated that he'll be joined by his longtime teammate and buddy, Travis Kelce , for this ride.Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is talking about teammate Travis Kelce as they gear up for their next NFL Divisional Round match against the Houston Texans. The Chiefs secured the AFC's No. 1 seed with a 15-2 regular season record. Mahomes said in a media session that Kelce is a ""champion"" with ""grit and determination"" that reflects not only his leadership but also his dedication to the locker room.“I think it’s just the greats, man. They step up in the playoffs and it’s just higher intensity,"" Mahomes told reporters. ""The best players and the best leaders step up and make the best plays and he’s (Travis Kelce) done that and (I) expect the same from him going into these playoffs. I think his mentality that he steps on the football field with at practice and on game day is kind of resonates with the entire team and gets everybody to play their best football and that’s what it takes in order to win championships.”“I think that and – I think it meant a lot to the team that he (Travis Kelce) put the team above himself in that moment,"" Mahomes said. ""I mean, he obviously could’ve got 1,000 yards pretty quickly there and all of us wanted him to get 1,000 yards. He said, ‘That’s not my goal, my goal is to win a Super Bowl ,’ and I think guys took that and they ran with it. Then, obviously he stepped up his play and made a lot of big time plays and it worked out all for the best.”""He has the heart of a champion, and I think that inspires everybody,"" Mahomes said of the superstar tight end. ""When your leaders and your Hall of Fame guys are doing that, I think everybody knows that they gotta put it all out on the line.” While much of the community praised Mahomes for Kelce, fans argue over the enormity of his contributions to this season, regardless of how they feel about Kelce's remarks.Kelce and Mahomes have shown extremely impressive chemistry, winning the Chiefs three Super Bowl titles. Their performance in the playoffs has been quite remarkable for Kansas City: Kelce broke the NFL record for most touchdown connections during the postseason with 16. Mahomes' allusion to leadership and legacy in the face of what will presumably be probably even another defeated attempt is telling, but Kelce's ""heart of a champion"" may not be enough for another Super Bowl win-all eyes are on Kansas City this weekend.Also Read: “It's not my job”: Vikings Justin Jefferson is unconcerned who plays for the team next season Kelce, a 12th-year NFL veteran, earned his 10th consecutive Pro-Bowl selection in 2024, showcasing his impressive performance with 97 catches, 832 yards, and three touchdowns in 16 regular-season games.

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

NEW DELHI: Former Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has downplayed the debate surrounding his retirement from international cricket without a farewell game, stating it wasn’t something he desired or deemed necessary.Speaking on his YouTube channel on Tuesday, the Tamil Nadu cricketer revealed he stepped away simply because he felt his time was up.Ashwin's announcement, made after the third Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Brisbane, surprised the cricketing world. The draw at the Gabba marked the end of his illustrious international career, though many fans and pundits expected a more ceremonious conclusion.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy ""I think a lot. What to do in life. You all need to understand that this happens instinctively. If someone gets to know their job is done, once that thinking comes, there is nothing to think. People said a lot of things. I don't think it is a big deal,"" Ashwin said, dismissing speculation about his decision.Reflecting on the circumstances of his retirement, Ashwin explained that his creativity on the field had run its course. ""You think what happened. I did not play the first Test. I played the second, did not play the third. It was possible I could play the next or not play the next. This is a side of my creativity and I was looking to explore it. At that time, I felt my creativity was over, so it was over. It was simple.""The 38-year-old also addressed the idea of a farewell game, firmly stating he wouldn’t want to be included in the team solely for sentimental reasons.Also See: Champions Trophy Full Schedule ""What difference will this make if I came out with the ball and people are clapping? How long will people talk about it? When social media was not there, people talked about it and forgot after one week. There is no need for a farewell. The game has given us a lot and we have played with a lot of happiness,"" he said.Ashwin emphasised his commitment to cricket, even beyond the Indian dressing room. ""I want to play more cricket. Where is the place? Obviously not in the Indian dressing room but from somewhere else. I want to be honest with the game. Imagine if I want to play a farewell Test but I do not deserve a place. Imagine, I am only in the team because it is my farewell Test. I don't want that.""He concluded by expressing satisfaction with his timing, stating, ""I felt there was more strength in my cricket. I could have played more but it is always better to finish when people ask 'why' and not 'why not.'""",Former Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has announced his retirement from Test cricket.

NEW DELHI: Indian cricket team captain Rohit Sharma trained with the Mumbai squad on Tuesday as they gear up for the Ranji Trophy 's resumption on January 23.While it remains uncertain whether Rohit will feature in Mumbai's upcoming fixture against Jammu and Kashmir, the Team India opener has been grappling with a lean patch in recent months.During the recently concluded series against Australia, India's top batters, including Rohit Sharma, struggled to deliver significant performances. Rohit managed just 31 runs across five innings in three Tests, with his highest score in the series being 10.Rohit's poor run of form led him to ""sit out"" of the fifth Test in Sydney. Recently, TimesofIndia.com reported that he had made up his mind about retiring from Test cricket after the MCG Test. However, as per the report, Rohit's ""well-wishers"" persuaded him to continue playing the longest format of the game.Considered a key batter ahead of the tour, Virat Kohli also struggled to find form in Test cricket for Team India. Starting strong in Perth with a century in the second innings of the opening Test, the 36-year-old batter could muster only 190 runs throughout the series. His struggles against deliveries outside the off-stump were evident, drawing widespread criticism.With both Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli struggling in Tests, fans and cricket experts worldwide have suggested that the star batters return to domestic cricket , particularly the Ranji Trophy, to regain their form.ALSO READ: 'Well-wishers' urged Rohit Sharma to not retire, decision upset Gautam Gambhir On that note, here's a look at when the players from the squad for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy last featured in India's premier domestic competition.",When members of Indian Test squad played their last Ranji Trophy match.

Rams dominate, Vikings face reality in Wild-Card loss



Kevin O'Connell answers questions about Sam Darnold's performance in loss to Rams

Will Sam Darnold’s struggles lead to change at QB?



In a Wild-Card showdown that no one saw coming, the Los Angeles Rams made it clear that nothin, not even a wildfire could stop their playoff push. With a defense that dominated, tying an NFL playoff record with 7 sacks, and Matthew Stafford leading the offense with pinpoint precision, the Rams cruised to a 27-9 victory. But for the Vikings , it was a bitter ending. Veterans like Harrison Smith and Aaron Jones shared emotional moments, realizing this could be the end of a chapter. What does this game mean for both teams going forward? The answers are in the emotions and the aftermath of this unforgettable game.The Los Angeles Rams refused to be sidelined by anything, not even a wildfire, as they delivered a jaw-dropping 27-9 victory over the Vikings in the NFL wild-card round . The Rams’ defense was nothing short of relentless, tying the NFL playoff record with 7 sacks and completely dismantling the Viking’s offense. With 15 turnovers forced in their last four games and an average of just 12.5 points allowed, this defense was a nightmare for opponents. On the offensive side, Matthew Stafford was in full command, completing 73% of his passes for 285 yards and 2 touchdowns. But this wasn’t just a win, it was a statement. The Rams aren’t just contenders; they’re one of the most balanced and dangerous teams in the playoffs.The Los Angeles Rams dominated the Vikings 27-9 in the NFL wild-card round, tying a playoff record with 7 sacks and shutting down Minnesota’s offense. With 15 turnovers forced in the last four games and just 12.5 points allowed per game, the Rams’ defense was unstoppable. Matthew Stafford led the charge on offense, completing 73% of passes for 285 yards and 2 touchdowns.On the other side, the Vikings faced a painful reality. Harrison Smith, who’s retiring after the season, shared an emotional moment with teammates, including Josh Metellus, who reflected, “Today was our last day all being together. We didn’t do enough to win, and that’s what happened in this thing.” Smith leaves behind a stellar career with 87 tackles, 3 interceptions, and 10 pass defenses, solidifying his place as a Hall of Fame contender.Aaron Jones and T.J. Hockenson echoed similar sentiments, noting the transient nature of NFL rosters. “Teams change year after year. So, like you said, it is a true brotherhood in this locker room. And, you know, some guys may not be back, yet you feel it.” For these players, it’s the bond they’ve built that makes parting ways so difficult. (via: EssentiallySports)Also Read: Former Niners All-Pro demands accountability from Justin Herbert for playoff failure despite $262.5 Million contract After the Vikings' playoff exit, Sam Darnold’s future with the team is hanging in the balance. Despite earning his first Pro Bowl selection during the regular season, his performance in the final two games raised significant concerns. Against the Lions, he completed less than 44% of his passes, and in the loss to the Rams, he was sacked a staggering nine times. Though Head Coach Kevin O’Connell acknowledged Darnold's contributions to the Vikings’ 14-win season, he didn’t shy away from noting that the QB could have performed better, leaving room for potential changes.While O'Connell didn't make any definitive statements about Darnold’s future, his comments suggest the quarterback’s fate is far from secure. With the Vikings having invested a first-round pick in QB JJ McCarthy, Darnold’s chances of staying on as the long-term starter seem unlikely. His recent struggles have also lowered his market value, which could make him a more affordable option for the Vikings if they decide to keep him as a backup or on a short-term deal to bridge the gap with McCarthy. However, with McCarthy seen as the future of the franchise, it’s clear that Darnold’s time in Minnesota may be nearing its end.","The Los Angeles Rams dominated the Vikings 27-9 in the NFL wild-card round, tying a playoff record with 7 sacks and shutting down Minnesota’s offense.

When India head coach Gautam Gambhir lost his cool in Australia

NEW DELHI: Indian cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has called on the Board of Control for Cricket in India BCCI ) to reduce the squad size for the upcoming Test series against England in June. Gavaskar, writing in his column for Sportstar, expressed concerns about the oversized contingent India took on their recent tour of Australia, which included 19 players, reserves included.Gavaskar acknowledged the need for a larger squad in Australia due to logistical challenges but insisted the England tour requires a more streamlined approach. ""Carrying more than 16 players will indicate the selectors are unsure, and that's never a good sign. Just because the BCCI can afford to send a large party doesn't mean the India cap should be given just like that,"" he stated.While he recommended taking additional bowlers for practice purposes, Gavaskar was firm on not awarding them the India cap unless absolutely necessary. ""The usual problem overseas is a lack of practice bowlers, so by all means take a few bowlers over, and they can be given the training and clothing, but not the India cap,"" he added.Gavaskar also emphasised the importance of practice matches, urging the Indian team to schedule as many as possible during the England series. Reflecting on the recent Border-Gavaskar Trophy , where India opted for intra-squad games and a single tour match, Gavaskar called for a shift in approach.Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy ""There will be some gaps between the Test matches, and these need to be utilised for practice games. Travel in England is by road almost every time, and the India team will drive down to the next Test venue on the last evening of the previous Test match. Since there won't be a travel day involved, giving the next day off after the Test is understandable, but the next couple should be used for practice,"" he explained.The batting great also suggested eliminating optional practice sessions, advocating for the coach and captain to determine the team's schedule. ""This recent tradition of optional practice should be done away with, and only the coach and captain should decide who gets days off from practice, and this should not be left to the individual player to decide,"" he wrote.Also See: Champions Trophy Fixtures 2025 Concluding his remarks, Gavaskar expressed optimism about India's depth and the opportunity for a refreshed squad to make a strong statement in England.

When India head coach Gautam Gambhir lost his cool in Australia

BCCI feels team bonding missing

LIVE: India Champions Trophy squad: Who should make up the Rohit Sharma-led side?

Return to strict fitness levels?

NEW DELHI: As India tries to recover from back-to-back debacles in the Test series against New Zealand and Australia, BCCI has identified lack of team bonding and the need for a strict fitness regimen as key areas to be worked upon.TOI understands while the board has received strong feedback from head coach Gautam Gambhir on these issues, itwill also reassess his role after the upcoming Champions Trophy next month At a meeting between BCCI, Gambhir, captain Rohit Sharma and chief selector Ajit Agarkar , it was mentioned there should be curbs on the amount of time players spend with wives/partners on a long tour. The fact that some players prefer to travel alone and asked for separate accommodation on tours was discussed.Gambhir's involvement with the team beyond the field too has been questioned, and he could be advised to have more team bonding exercises.""The board is a bit concerned that a team which has been so consistent across formats for more than half a decade is suddenly struggling to click with almost the same set of players. It comes down to a lack of galvanising force in the team. It has emerged that players are consumed in their individual lives once they are done with training or a game,"" a BCCI source said.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 ""Players these days have their families around along with a big entourage. Some have even requested to stay in different hotels and a few have made their own travel arrangements within the country. These players are barely seen with the rest of the team. The board is contemplating restricting the length of stay for families to two weeks on a lengthy tour,"" the source added.On a key observation coming out of the meeting about the need to rebuild team spirit beyond game time, the source said, ""One expected the team to have a customary celebratory team dinner after India won the first Test in Perth. Instead, everyone in the squad went out in groups.Gambhir went out with his own people. There was only one team dinner during the two-month tour. Previous team management used to organize outdoor activities with the entire team. It helps in building team spirit,"" the source said.TOI understands that Gambhir has cancelled the culture of optional training sessions for the same reason. He feels that the entire team needs to train together to enhance synergy amongst the players and there is no point of a handful of players turning up for practice.It has been suggested that the BCCI medical team should go back to having fitness criteria for selection instead of just focusing on injury prevention. The previous team management had done away with the yo-yo test that was a key parameter for selection during Virat Kohli 's captaincy days.""The board had gone lenient on the players since they are mostly on the road. The focus had shifted to just injury prevention. This has been taken lightly by some players. It is being mooted that a certain fitness level criteria needs to be reintroduced so that complacency doesn't creep in,"" the source said.",BCCI has identified lack of team bonding and the need for a strict fitness regimen as key areas to be worked upon.

Eagles fan faces backlash after abusive incident with a Packers supporter during Wild Card game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/dumb-ct-eagles-fan-faces-backlash-after-abusive-incident-with-a-packers-supporter-during-wild-card-game/articleshow/117251818.cms,"Image via AP

Eagles fan recorded using abusive slur towards a Packers supporter

During the recent NFL Wild Card game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Green Bay Packers, an episode of fan misbehavior attracted considerable attention. A recording showed an Eagles supporter, Ryan Caldwell, hurling abusive language at a female Packers fan,Alley Keller.Many Eagles fans backed Ally Keller, stating that one fan's actions didn't represent the entire fanbase and highlighting the importance of respect.The NFL Wild Card round saw the Los Angeles Rams defeat the Minnesota Vikings 27-9, with the game relocated to Arizona due to California wildfires. The Rams' defense dominated, tying a playoff record with nine sacks and featuring a 57-yard fumble return touchdown by Jared Verse. Quarterback Matthew Stafford threw for 208 yards and two touchdowns.Earlier, the Philadelphia Eagles secured a 22-10 win over the Green Bay Packers, with their defense forcing three interceptions and shutting down quarterback Jordan Love in a commanding performance.During the NFL Wild Card,an Eagles fan, Ryan Caldwell, was caught on video using offensive language towards a female Packers supporter, Ally Keller. The footage, recorded by Keller's fiancé, Alex Basara, shows Caldwell repeatedly using derogatory terms.At one time,he calls her ""an ugly dumb c**t"", then tells her partner to ""shut the f**k up"" if he's not going to do anything about the way he's talking to her. He then tells him to turn around and watch the game.The confrontation started when Caldwell became frustrated that Keller was applauding the Packers, despite their minimal progress to the one-yard line without scoring. This caused Caldwell to make an inappropriate insulting remark, calling Keller a ""dumb c**t.""In reaction to the incident, the Philadelphia Eagles organization has prohibited Caldwell from entering Lincoln Financial Field permanently. Furthermore, Caldwell's employer, BCT Partners—a company focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion—has launched an internal review and criticized his actions as inconsistent with their principles.Basara and Keller, both living in Chester County, Pennsylvania, have addressed the incident publicly, stating that while they expected some degree of fan rivalry, the personal nature of Caldwell's insults was surprising and unsettling. The Eagles organization has contacted the couple to express regret and has offered to send Packers merchandise to Keller as a sign of goodwill.Also Read: “It's not my job”: Vikings Justin Jefferson is unconcerned who plays for the team next season After the incident during the NFL Wild Card game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Green Bay Packers, many Eagles supporters have openly shown their backing for the affected Packers fan, Ally Keller. They have stressed that the behavior of the individual in question does not reflect the wider Eagles fan community. This united reaction highlights the significance of sportsmanship and reciprocal respect among fans.","Eagles fan recorded using abusive slur towards a Packers supporter during NFL Wild Card game.

'It's a special place': Sam Hain reflects on Newlands debut in SA20

The Joburg Super Kings (JSK) spin trio of Tabraiz Shamsi , Donovan Ferreira, and Imran Tahir delivered a commanding performance to secure a 28-run victory over Durban's Super Giants in their SA20 clash at Kingsmead on Tuesday. Their combined effort dismantled the hosts' batting lineup, propelling JSK to their second consecutive win of the third season.Chasing JSK's total of 169/7, the Super Giants faltered despite Quinton de Kock 's valiant knock of 55 off 45 balls. De Kock held one end steady with five boundaries and two sixes, but wickets tumbled around him. Shamsi, Ferreira, and Tahir shared five wickets, ensuring the home side fell short, bowled out for 141 in 18 overs.The match saw a moment of brilliance from the 45-year-old Tahir, who dived spectacularly at point to catch Wiaan Mulder off a reverse sweep. The catch galvanised the visitors, who turned the tide decisively.The Super Giants were well-placed at 99/4, with De Kock and Heinrich Klaasen threatening to take the game away. Klaasen, striking a quick 29 off 17 balls, looked dangerous until Matheesha Pathirana dismissed him with a leg-side catch at the end of the 12th over. From there, the collapse was swift, with JSK's spinners tightening the noose.Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy Earlier, the Super Kings set a competitive total, thanks to contributions from Leus du Plooy (38), Jonny Bairstow (26), and Ferreira (26). Gerald Coetzee provided late fireworks, smashing the final two balls of the innings for six to ensure JSK carried momentum into the second innings.Despite the defeat, Quinton de Kock was named Player of the Match for his gritty innings. “As the innings progressed, it got harder. To be honest, I thought I won't be able to do it. I have done it on much flatter wickets. It became impossible to hit,"" De Kock reflected.Super Giants captain Keshav Maharaj acknowledged areas for improvement. “We got the balls in the right areas. If I am hyper-critical, we left 15 runs there. It happens in T20 cricket. Naveen is a champion bowler. We can be better in certain periods. The character needs to come through, but there were glimpses of positives,"" he said.JSK skipper Faf du Plessis expressed satisfaction with the team's performance. “Last year, the wicket was spin-heavy. It looked like a dry surface. I was surprised it was sticky - maybe because of the moisture. We thought 160 would keep us in the game. Those two sixes from Gerald at the end were huge. Donovan was hard to hit, and the spinners picked up wickets. Very happy to come here and win. To top the table is a great result for us,"" he said.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 Fixtures The Super Kings will look to maintain their form, while the Super Giants must regroup and address their middle-order struggles.","Joburg Super Kings beat Durban's Super Giants by 28 runs at Kingsmead.

Desert Vipers clinched their second consecutive victory in the ILT20 Season 3 , defeating the Gulf Giants by six wickets at the Dubai International Stadium on Tuesday.An unbeaten 42 from all-rounder Sam Curran , coupled with Sherfane Rutherford’s explosive 40 off 18 balls, ensured a comfortable chase for the Vipers, who reached their target of 120 in 17.4 overs.Gulf Giants, after being put into bat, struggled against the Vipers' formidable bowling attack. Skipper Lockie Ferguson led the charge, taking three wickets, while Mohammad Amir picked up two, restricting the Giants to 119/9 in their 20 overs. James Vince was the lone warrior for the Giants, scoring an unbeaten 76 off 62 balls, while the rest of the batting lineup faltered.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 The Vipers' chase began shakily, with Mark Adair removing Fakhar Zaman and Dan Lawrence in the second over. However, a steady partnership between Sam Curran and Alex Hales, who added 49 runs, stabilised the innings. Hales departed for 20 off 30 balls, but Curran continued to anchor the chase, finding the boundaries at crucial moments.Sherfane Rutherford joined Curran in the middle and launched a blistering assault, smashing two sixes and a four in the 18th over to seal the win. Curran finished unbeaten on 42 from 43 balls, including four fours and a six, earning him the Player of the Match award.Earlier, Gulf Giants struggled to build momentum after losing early wickets. Amir struck in the first over, trapping Adam Lyth lbw, while Ferguson and Curran added to the Giants’ woes by dismissing Rehan Khan and Jordan Cox.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 Schedule Despite Vince’s measured innings, the Giants found little support from the lower order. UAE’s Aayan Afzal Khan provided a brief respite with a 33-run stand, but his dismissal by Luke Wood in the 15th over ended any hopes of a substantial total. Vince fought valiantly, bringing up a half-century off 47 balls and adding a few late boundaries to push the Giants to 119/9.Reflecting on his performance, Sam Curran said, ""It is nice to be here for the start of the tournament and it is nice to win on a tricky pitch. It was almost a bit of a Test match out there, trying to trust your defence. I knew they are going to go for their best seam bowlers at the top, so had to adjust accordingly.""Gulf Giants skipper James Vince acknowledged the challenging conditions. ""It was a tough gig batting first, there seemed to be a bit more moisture in the wicket than the last game. 120 is always going to be tough to defend. We needed a bit of luck going our way on a wicket like that. If we had held onto our chances, it could have been a bit tricky for them,"" he said.Desert Vipers now stand as strong contenders in the competition, with their bowlers and middle order proving decisive in back-to-back victories.","Desert Vipers beat Gulf Giants by six wickets in ILT20 Season 3.

recalls the 1978 tour in new memoir

Poll Which India-Pakistan Player Duel Defined the Rivalry? Virat Kohli vs Mohammad Amir Sachin Tendulkar vs. Shoaib Akhtar

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

NEW DELHI: Indian cricketers received a tumultuous welcome when they arrived in Pakistan for a Test series in 1978. But the players were taken aback when a foreign-educated Pakistani cricketer referred to them as ""kafirs"", a pejorative term for those who don't adhere to Islam.""An unnecessary remark by a Cambridge-educated cricketer gave us a bit of a shock,"" writes Mohinder Amarnath in his newly-released memoirs, Fearless, penned with brother Rajender. The player who made the remark is not named.The incident occurred after a game in Rawalpindi. ""After the match, we were a bit casual boarding the bus. Gratuitously, this cricketer said, ""Bithao, bithao, in kafiron ko jaldi bithao (Board these nonbelievers quickly),"" writes Amarnath, further adding, ""What was the use of a good education if it could not change their negative attitude towards others?""Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 In contrast, the cricketers received a wildly joyous reception at the Karachi airport. About 40,000-50,000 turned up to welcome the visiting team. The crowd was double the number, but many had left beforehand because the flight was delayed.""The distance from the airport to the hotel normally took 20 minutes, but for us, it took four hours; people had occupied every inch of space on the pavement and the road, and they refused to leave unless and until they caught a glimpse of the Indian cricketers or shaken hands with us. They were warm and hospitable,"" says Amarnath, who played 69 Tests, scored 4,378 runs, hit 11 tons, took 32 wickets, was also Man of the Match in India's 1983 ODI World Cup final triumph.However, some Pakistani players behaved differently. The memoir says, ""… this artificial bubble burst quicker than anticipated and hostility emerged from an expected quarter. Apparently, certain Pakistani players acted on the advice of seniors and kept their distance. If we spoke to them, their tone and tenor was aggressive. At least two of them, Javed Miandad and Sarfraz Nawaz , and to a lesser degree Mudassar Nazar, took the advice a little too seriously. I don't think either Javed or Sarfraz ever kept quiet on the field.""Also See: Champions Trophy Schedule 2025 The cricketer, known to be one of the finest players of pace bowling, recalls an incident in the Karachi Test involving Nawaz and Sunil Gavaskar , who hit centuries in both innings (111 and 137) in the game.""Whenever he bowled a bouncer, Gavaskar allowed it to sail over his head. When the same bowler pitched the ball up to him, it was dispatched to the fence. This annoyed Sarfraz and he vented his frustration in crass Punjabi words, which Gavaskar couldn't understand. After the over, he came to me and asked, ""Why is Sarfraz calling me pant coat?' I laughed at his ignorance and whispered, ""He meant p…c…!"" Those who still cannot follow should recall the 'Ben Stokes' memes on social media.In the late 1970s, exceptions aside, alcohol was banned in Pakistan. Fateh Singh Rao Gaekwad, who was the manager of the team, hosted the players at his Bombay residence before the tour and, ""on a lighter note"" asked the players ""fond of drinks"" to carry their quota.""Many were taken aback by the suggestion, knowing the restrictions on alcohol in Pakistan. The next morning, crates of two-litre Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky arrived and was distributed among the players,"" the memoir says.","Mohinder Amarnath recalls 1978 tour of Pakistan in new memoir Fearless.

Liverpool 's charge towards the Premier League title was halted by stubborn Nottingham Forest in a 1-1 draw between the top two on Tuesday as Manchester City 's resurgence came undone in a 2-2 draw at Brentford.Chris Wood fired Forest in front early on at a raucous City Ground, but Liverpool dominated almost the entire 97 minutes and got back on level terms thanks to substitute Diogo Jota's goal with his first touch.Only a brilliant goalkeeping performance from Matz Sels denied the leaders victory, but the point maintained a six-point cushion over Forest for Arne Slot's men, who also have a game in hand.Forest had won their last seven games in all competitions to raise the possibility of matching Leicester's incredible title win of 2015/16.The in-form Wood had the home fans believing after just eight minutes when he slotted in Anthony Elanga's pass.Liverpool enjoyed over 70 percent possession and had 23 shots on goal but only posed a serious threat in front of goal after the break.Jota had only been on the field a matter of seconds when he nodded in Kostas Tsimikas' corner.Sels then made incredible saves to deny Jota, Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo a winner, while Salah also had a goalbound effort cleared off the line.""I could not have asked for more,"" said Slot. ""Second half was outstanding.""There are not many teams that can create so many chances against an opponent so defensively strong. Unfortunately we couldn't get a second.""Liverpool's second consecutive league draw opens the door for Arsenal to cut the gap at the top to four points when they host Tottenham in the north London derby on Wednesday.Any suggestion City could get themselves back in the title race was ended in a late collapse in west London as Brentford struck twice in the final 10 minutes for a deserved point.Phil Foden's double had City on course for a fourth consecutive win after a run of just one victory in 13 games.However, the English champions' defending was not convincing all night and they were punished as Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard netted for the Bees.Foden's return to the form that saw him crowned Premier League player of the year last season was the one positive for City.But Pep Guardiola will reflect on a missed opportunity to make up ground on the top four as City remain down in sixth, 12 points off the top.Foden produced a brilliant deft touch from Kevin De Bruyne's inviting delivery and then smashed in a rebound for his fourth goal in five league games.Brentford wasted a host of chances before conceding but finally got some reward for their attacking endeavour when Wissa slotted in from Mads Roerslev's cross to become the club's all-time leading goalscorer in the Premier League.They completed the comeback in stoppage time when Norgaard's header had too much power for Stefan Ortega.""We are not (at our best) and we didn't take the right decisions,"" said Guardiola. ""It's fine, it's not a good place to come. Unfortunately, we couldn't win.""Fourth-placed Chelsea's miserable run extended to five league games without a win but they were grateful for captain Reece James' stoppage-time equaliser salvaging a point in a 2-2 draw at home to Bournemouth.Cole Palmer's cool finish from Nicolas Jackson's through ball had given Chelsea the perfect start.But Bournemouth hit back through Justin Kluivert's penalty, before Antoine Semenyo's blistering near-post effort put the visitors in front.James has endured another injury-hit season but showed his quality by curling home a free-kick at the death.West Ham boss Graham Potter enjoyed a winning home debut as Fulham were beaten 3-2 at the London Stadium.Carlos Soler, Tomas Soucek and Lucas Paqueta were on target for the Hammers to take Potter's men above Manchester United and Tottenham into 12th.",Liverpool held to 1-1 draw by Nottingham Forest at the City Ground. Manchester City held 2-2 by Brentford at the Macron Stadium. Chelsea held to a draw by Bournemouth at Stamford Bridge.

We take the learnings and move forward: Durban's Super Giants' Prenelan Subrayen

Imran Tahir reflects on JSK's commanding victory over Durban in SA20

Durban's Super Giants spinner Prenelan Subrayen emphasised the importance of learning from their 28-run defeat against the Joburg Super Kings in the SA20 clash at Kingsmead on Tuesday. Despite Quinton de Kock ’s fighting 55 off 45 balls, the home side faltered, bowled out for 141 in their chase of 169/7.The spin trio of Tabraiz Shamsi, Donovan Ferreira, and Imran Tahir delivered a decisive performance, claiming five wickets collectively to secure JSK’s second consecutive win of the season.Reflecting on the defeat, Subrayen said, “I think the reflection had already started once the guys came off the field. I don’t think there will be any dwelling on it, but there will definitely be learning in terms of what we can do better going forward.”The Kingsmead pitch, which had seen recent rain, was not a significant factor, according to Subrayen. “I think it was kind of signature Kingsmead. I play a lot of my cricket here, so for me, it was normal. The field was a bit heavy because of the rain, but the wicket was fine.”Despite de Kock holding one end steady with five boundaries and two sixes, the Super Giants struggled to build partnerships. Subrayen attributed this to an off day rather than desperation. “I don’t think it was a sense of desperation. It was just probably not our day, with things not clicking. In a long tournament, you’re not going to play perfectly every game, but we definitely strive to.”Subrayen also addressed the extras conceded by the Super Giants, which amounted to 14 runs. “Over and above the 14 extras, there’s a lot of ‘should have, could have, would have’ moments you reflect on after a game. The first priority is to avoid extras, but no one’s perfect. It’s not like people are trying to bowl extras.”Looking ahead, Subrayen remained optimistic about the team’s ability to bounce back. “Every game is a new game, and the preparation leading up to those games remains the same. We take the learnings from this match and move forward.”With the SA20 season still in its early stages, Durban's Super Giants will aim to regroup and rebuild, drawing on lessons from their encounter with the formidable Joburg Super Kings.","Durban's Super Giants lost by 28 runs to Joburg Super Kings in SA20 clash.

And, in the two matches, she has shown a lot of confidence.""The big totals in the series may have given the impression that the matches are being played on flat deck, but Deepti said the bowlers have also received help from the pitches.""It is a very good wicket.

Rohit takes part in 45-min 'match simulation' at Mumbai Ranji team practice

MUMBAI: Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal , one of the few bright spots of India's recent tour of Australia, will turn out for Mumbai in their first match of the second leg of the Ranji Trophy against Jammu & Kashmir from January 23.""He has been asked to report for Mumbai practice from tomorrow. He is available for the match on January 23, and he will be picked for that game,"" a source in the Mumbai Cricket Association told TOI.The Mumbai selectors, led by Sanjay Patil, will pick the team soon for the J&K fixture.Jaiswal scored 391 runs in five Tests at an average of 43.44 in the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy , with one century and two half-centuries.Interestingly, as per sources in the BCCI, Jaiswal has been ""rested"" from India's five-match T20 home series against England, which begins from Jan 22 in Kolkata, so that he remains fit and fresh for the ODI series against England and the Champions Trophy thereafter.Searching desperately for form ahead of the Champions Trophy, Indian cricket captain Rohit Sharma practised for around 45 minutes with the Mumbai team at the Wankhede Stadium on Tuesday morning, before attending a promotional event. Also present in the practice session were senior batters Ajinkya Rahane & Shreyas Iyer, and allrounder Shardul Thakur.""He batted for almost 45 minutes on the centre wicket in a match simulation environment. He started with throwdowns, followed by some batting in match simulation, during which he faced Mumbai's fast bowlers and spinners. However, he has still not conveyed to the Mumbai Cricket Association whether he will play in Mumbai's (sixth round) Ranji Trophy match against Jammu & Kashmir on Jan 23, as he's still double-minded about playing the Ranji match. That's a red-ball game, and the Champions Trophy in Feb, where he's likely to lead India, will be a white-ball, limited overs event,"" a source told TOI.Rohit, who expressed his desire to train with the Mumbai team to head coach Omkar Salvi, last played for Mumbai way back in a Ranji Trophy match in 2015 against Uttar Pradesh.The BCCI had advised all the players to turn out for their teams in the forthcoming rounds of the Ranji Trophy unless they are unfit or on national duty.

Rohit could turn up for both these sessions,"" a source said.After India lost the BGT series 1-3 to Australia, India's head coach Gautam Gambhir had emphasised the importance of the Indian cricketers playing in domestic cricket and said that he would want everyone to play domestic cricket.""I would always like everyone to play domestic cricket. That is how much importance domestic cricket needs to be given. Not only one game but if they are available and have the commitment to play red-ball cricket, everyone should play domestic cricket. It's as simple as it can get. If you don't give importance to domestic cricket, you will never get the desired players that you want in Test cricket,"" Gambhir had said in a press conference after India's series defeat.The 37-year-old has been in the midst of a horror run with the bat, spread across the home Test series against New Zealand, and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia. Rohit managed to score just 31 runs in three Tests at an average of 6.20 in Australia, and opted out of the final Test in Sydney. Across the four Tests Down Under, his scores were 3,9, 10, 3, and 6.On Saturday, Rohit took part in a review meeting here to assess Team India’s performance in Australia, which was also attended by head coach Gautam Gambhir and BCCI’s new secretary Devajit Saikia.","Yashasvi Jaiswal will turn out for Mumbai in their first match of the second leg of the Ranji Trophy against Jammu & Kashmir from January 23.

Milan: Atalanta creeped closer to Serie A leaders Napoli on Tuesday after drawing an entertaining match with Juventus 1-1 and moving to within four points of the summit, while AC Milan came from behind to beat Como.Mateo Retegui salvaged a point for Atalanta with a close-range header 12 minutes from time, not long after returning to action from the bench following four weeks on the sidelines with a hamstring injury.The Italy striker's finish, which levelled Pierre Kalulu's 54th-minute opener for Juve, put him out on his own at the top of the Serie A scoring charts on 13 goals and pushed Atalanta to 43 points, ahead of table-topping Napoli's crucial trip to Bergamo this coming weekend.Gian Piero Gasperini's side, who are bidding for their first league title after winning the Europa League last season, sit level on points with second-placed Inter Milan.However, champions Inter have two games in hand on both Atalanta and Napoli and play the first of those fixtures against Bologna at the San Siro on Wednesday.""It was a great match tonight, and I'm very happy with the way my boys played,"" said Gasperini to Sky.""It was difficult going behind because we were hoping to go ahead but I think at the end of the day a draw is probably a fair result.""Tuesday's draw was Atalanta and Juve's rescheduled fixture due to their trip to Saudi Arabia to contest the Italian Super Cup earlier this month with Inter and winners AC Milan.Juve were again without a recognised striker due to an injury crisis which has left both Dusan Vlahovic and Arkadiusz Milik sidelined but Thiago Motta's side were a constant threat.Moments before his opener Kalulu watched on in frustration as his glancing header hit the inside of the post and was just scooped off the line by Atalanta goalkeeper Marco Carnesecchi.And Kenan Yildiz put wide a great chance to snatch a last-gasp win deep in stoppage time, shortly after substitute Nicolo Zaniolo slapped a golden opportunity for the hosts straight at Juve goalkeeper Michele Di Gregorio.""To draw like that in the closing minutes hurts a bit. We played well and had the chances to win today,"" said Kalulu.Juve remain unbeaten but have now drawn 13 of their 20 league fixtures and sit fifth, 13 points behind Napoli.Earlier, Theo Hernandez and Rafael Leao saved Milan from an embarrassing defeat at Como with the goals which gave Sergio Conceicao's new team a 2-1 win.Trailing to Assane Diao's fine low strike on the hour mark, star players Hernandez and Leao turned the match around by the 76th minute, handing Conceicao his first league win as Milan coach.Tuesday's victory in one of their two games in hand moved Milan up to seventh on 31 points, five behind fourth-placed Lazio as Conceicao tries to reignite the Italian giants' bid for Champions League qualification.""They (Como) are a good team with a good coach, it's not easy to play here,"" said Conceicao.""It was an even game but we can't concede as much as we did, we need to be more organised.""Left flank pairing Hernandez and Leao had reportedly been at loggerheads with Conceicao's predecessor Paulo Fonseca, who was sacked at the end of December following a dismal opening half of the season.Both praised their new coach after he arrived just before the new year and immediately won the Super Cup for Milan, who came from two goals behind to beat Inter in Saudi Arabia earlier this month.Hernandez levelled for Milan 11 minutes after Como new boy Diao's opener when his mishit volley sliced off his left boot and looped past goalkeeper Jean Butez.Leao dinked home the decisive goal shortly afterwards, meeting substitute Tammy Abraham's excellent through ball before netting his seventh goal in all competitions.",Atalanta draw 1-1 with Juventus in Serie A.

Sadaoui netted the winner in the 90+5th minute, having earlier provided the assist for Jesus Jimenez 's strike in the 73rd minute.The match sprang to life as soon as it started, with Odisha FC taking an early advantage through Mawihmingthanga's goal in the fourth minute. A clearance from Odisha's half landed in the Blasters' penalty area. Despite the ball bouncing in front of Pritam Kotal, the Indian international hesitated and failed to make a proper clearance. Odisha's striker Dorielton Nascimento capitalised on the defensive error and directed a header towards Mawihmingthanga, who gently guided the ball past Sachin Suresh to put the visitors ahead.After falling behind, Blasters launched numerous attacks on the Odisha goalmouth, clearly controlling the latter part of the first half and the initial minutes of the second half. Their persistence paid off in the 60th minute. Korou Singh, who was positioned in the attacking third, surprisingly retreated to the midfield, catching the Odisha defence off guard. He then provided Kwame Peprah with a precise pass from the right of the centre line, splitting two Odisha defenders. Peprah, left with only goalkeeper Amrinder Singh to beat, slotted the ball skilfully to draw the scores level.Soon after the equaliser, Blasters strengthened their strike force by substituting defender Alexandre Coeff with striker Jesus Jimenez. This tactical change proved beneficial for the hosts when Jimenez put Blasters ahead in the 73rd minute. Luna delivered a cross from the right flank to Sadaoui positioned near the far post, who directed a header towards Jimenez. The striker simply extended his foot to guide the ball into the net, securing a 2-1 lead for Blasters.Odisha managed to level the score when Dorielton Nascimento converted a rebound in the 80th minute. However, Odisha's fortunes took a turn for the worse when Carlos Delgado, who entered as a substitute in the 66th minute, received his second yellow card in the 82nd minute for consecutive fouls, reducing his team to ten players.Blasters made the numerical superiority count when Sadaoui found the back of the net during stoppage time. His strike from inside the penalty box took a fortunate deflection off Rahim Ali and looped into the net to give Blasters a much-needed victory.","Noah Sadaoui netted the winner in the 90+5th minute, having earlier provided the assist for Jesus Jimenez's strike in the 73rd minute. The match sprang to life as soon as it started, with Odisha FC taking an early advantage through Mawihmingthanga's goal in the fourth minute.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117221556,imgsize-56870,width-400,resizemode-4/117221556.jpg"

Coaching The Fundamental

Since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, Manchester United fans – particularly those who reached adolescence when the Class of 1992 made the first-team cut – have channelled their inner Ronin (Hawkeye’s murderous avatar into beg the team not to give hope. Over the years, there have been numerous false dawns, slivers of light ahead of the tunnel that have made United fans dream again before they were snatched away, like Morpheus’ Nebuchadnezzar’s lament: “I had a dream, but the dream was taken from me.”There was the Van Gaal era where fans were convinced that a former tactician – a man some claim invented modern football – could bring United back to the glory years. Then they convinced themselves that the Special One, by sheer dint of willpower and personality (and a little bit of the dark arts), the fallen Lucifer to Pep Guardiola’s Michael, would be the right person to resuscitate the Red Devils. They almost persuaded themselves, when Ole was at the wheel, that the good times were rolling again. It certainly felt like that on that night in Paris and when United were playing like the Fergie teams of yore. They even dared to hope that a man named Eric would lead the charge again, much like the collared Frenchman who did it in the early Fergie years.And now, Ruben Amorim, the youngest Man Utd manager in half a century, is playing the Pandora’s Box’s old trick again. Of course, on paper, Amorim’s record is nothing to write home about. His record in his first 13 games reads: five wins, two draws and six losses. Most other Man Utd managers actually have better records. Sir Alex Ferguson’s read: three wins, seven draws and three losses. It’s what came after those 13 games that makes Manchester United fans believe.But there has been something of the old grit that defined Fergie teams that has Utd fans daring to hope again. The back-to-the-wall performance evoked an older Man Utd vs Arsenal clash: the epic 1999 replay.The similarities are astounding between the 1999 FA Cup semi-final replay and the 2025 third-round showdown between the two clubs.The only difference in the 2025 match was that it was decided on penalty shootouts and not a wondrous Ryan Giggs goal that made Maradona look up from his cocaine pile.And in a strange way, it was a mirror image of the 2005 FA Cup final with its infamous Band of Brothers viral image featuring Paul Scholes, Roy Keane, Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney , Ryan Giggs, Mikaël Silvestre and Quinton Fortune.Incidentally, Manchester United battered Arsenal in that match – a follow-up to the infamous 4-2 “I will see you out there” Highbury fight – but still lost on a penalty shootout with Paul Scholes missing the last penalty. That day, United had eight shots on target, 12 off target, and 12 corners (far more than Arsenal) but still lost.It was a different ballgame in 2025. Arsenal had 26 shots to Man Utd’s seven, 71% of the possession, and a 3.3 xG to United’s 1.1 but failed to make their mark. United players have been struggling to adapt to Ruben Amorim’s style, but against Arsenal (like they did against Manchester City and Liverpool), there was a slight glimpse of the taste in the pudding.In the cult classic Coach Carter – when Samuel L. Jackson was whipping a bunch of askew young men into shape – he was asked by his team what they should do since they hadn’t practised attacking. To this, Jackson’s Carter had said: “Run.” And that’s what United players did in the match, all of them running together as a pack to keep Arsenal at bay.Harry Maguire, often the pantomime villain on the football pitch and even in parliaments around the world, was a colossus in defence. Equally driven were Lisandro Martínez and Matthijs de Ligt, the latter finally learning how to operate in a three-man midfield.Of course, Arsenal’s inability to finish was one of the major reasons this match went to penalties, with Kai Havertz moved around the pitch like Roy Keane was screaming “You can’t score in a brothel!” in his ear.But United fans will rejoice at the grit from a team that, during the last days of the Ten Hag era, looked like they were simply not interested in playing football. Whether it was Bayindir’s redemption after the horror performance against Tottenham in the Carabao Cup, academy graduate Toby Collyer’s gut-bursting runs, Bruno’s Roy Keane impression or Noussair Mazraoui and Manuel Ugarte in midfield, this was a team effort.And the performance came against refereeing that launched a thousand memes about Arsenal players diving with abandon, which included a soft penalty and a red card.A swallow doesn’t make a summer, and Manchester United will probably have to suffer for many more years before they finally have a team worthy of cleaning the boots of any of the vintage Ferguson teams. But for the moment, United fans can at least hope that the current side, even if they lack the sheer world-class talent of the Band of Brothers or the 1999 winning team or any of the great Fergie teams, will give it their all every time they are wearing the United shirt.Next up in the FA Cup: Ruud van Nistelrooy’s Leicester City, the last interim manager of Manchester United and a man who knows a thing or two about the gigantic expectations that come with wearing the Manchester United shirt.",Manchester United lost 3-2 to Arsenal in the 2025 FA Cup third round. The match was a mirror image of the epic 1999 FA Cup semi-final replay. The only difference between the two matches was that it was decided on penalty shootouts.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117203496,imgsize-67192,width-400,resizemode-4/117203496.jpg"
ISL: Mumbai left to rue another 0-3 defeat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/isl-mumbai-left-to-rue-another-0-3-defeat/articleshow/117186879.cms,"MUMBAI: One thing's for sure, two-time ISL champions and reigning Cup holders Mumbai City, are looking vulnerable this season, particularly at home!On Sunday, the Islanders crashed to their third defeat at the Mumbai Football Arena, falling to a 0-3 loss to Jamshedpur. In an alarming coincidence, each of their three home losses in this ISL campaign have come by that very scoreline.In a game that took until the second half to come to life, it was Mohammed Sanan who set the visitors on their way in the 64th minute with a clinical finish.Just as Mumbai City so nearly drew level when Nikolaos Karelis's left-footed effort stung Albino Gomes's palms in the closing minutes, Jordan Murray (86th) sealed the three points for Khalid Jamil's side following a quick break after Jamshedpur had won back possession.There was time for one final dagger which arrived in stoppage time as Javi Hernandez (90+6) fired home from inside the box.The win saw Jamshedpur climb to third place, level on points with Bengaluru (27pts) with a game in hand. Mumbai, meanwhile, still occupy sixth spot and that final playoff berth, but were left to rue another bitter outing at home. Although they went into this game with a confidence-boosting 3-2 win at East Bengal last week, there is no doubt that the Islanders are finding goals hard to come by this season.Coach Petr Kratky has even resorted to switching captain Lallianzuala Chhangte from his favoured position on the right of their usual three-man attack to playing in the hole behind the front three.It would yield no dividends on this occasion, as Jamshedpur's backline were disciplined enough to deal with anything Karelis, Vikram Partap Singh or Bipin Singh were able to ask of them.To make matters worse, Chhangte was sent off after the game for dissent.","Jamshedpur beat Mumbai City 0-3 at the Mumbai Football Arena. Mohammed Sanan, Jordan Murray and Javi Hernandez scored the goals for the visitors. The win saw Jamshedur climb to third place, level on points with Bengaluru.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117186854,imgsize-67518,width-400,resizemode-4/117186854.jpg"
