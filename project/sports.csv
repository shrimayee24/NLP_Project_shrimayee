“Nobody likes this guy”: Gary Bettman’s awkward interaction with Alex Ovechkin’s wife fuels criticism across social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nobody-likes-this-guy-gary-bettmans-awkward-interaction-with-alex-ovechkins-wife-fuels-criticism-across-social-media/articleshow/119965073.cms,"Alex Ovechkin continues his pursuit of Wayne Gretzky’s all-time goal record, scoring his 892nd career goal despite the Washington Capitals’ 5-1 loss to the Carolina Hurricanes. The hockey world watches as Ovechkin nears Gretzky’s milestone, while a celebratory moment with NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman sparks online criticism.

Awkward, cringeworthy handshake between Anastasia Shubskaya and Gary Bettman

One of the most compelling narratives in the NHL right now is Alex Ovechkin’s pursuit of Wayne Gretzky’s all-time goal record. On Wednesday night, despite the Washington Capitals falling 5-1 to the Carolina Hurricanes, Ovechkin was the lone bright spot for his team. The 39-year-old sniper unleashed a powerful shot from the high slot in the second period, beating goaltender Frederik Andersen and notching the 892nd goal of his storied career. Alex Ovechkin's wife shared a celebratory high-five with Capitals owner Ted Leonsis and then attempted to include NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman in the momentAlex Ovechkin, a 13-time NHL All-Star and three-time Hart Trophy winner, continues to edge closer to one of the greatest milestones in hockey history. With 892 goals under his belt, he's now just two away from tying Wayne Gretzky’s iconic all-time goal record and three from standing alone at the top. As the countdown narrows, the hockey world watches with anticipation, ready to witness history in the making.“If he breaks my record, I will be the first guy to stand there and shake his hand,"" Gretzky told reporters of Ovechkin’s chase for history. “I think it is great for our sport. I am proud of what I have accomplished. I know what I did was really hard, but I think it will only be positive for the game if he can break the record.”Following Alex Ovechkin’s latest goal—bringing him within one of his 14th 40-goal season—his wife, Anastasia Shubskaya, was visibly excited in the stands. She shared a celebratory high-five with Capitals owner Ted Leonsis and then attempted to include NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman in the moment. What followed was an awkward, cringeworthy handshake that quickly caught fans’ attention. Given Bettman’s already unpopular status among many NHL supporters, the uncomfortable exchange only fueled more criticism of him across social media.“‘Celly’ that man barely shook her hand,” one fan wrote. “Bettman try to care challenge impossible,” another joked. “The second she looked away his face got so sour,” added a third fan. “What an awkward celebration ..,” one mocked. “Gary like who dis ,” another one quipped.“Nobody likes this guy ,” remarked one fan.Also Read: “An idiot jumping around”: Alex Ovechkin’s epic response to Don Cherry’s criticism resurfaces as he nears Gretzky’s goal record Fans wasted no time reacting online, with many mocking the awkward moment and using it as yet another reason to criticize Bettman.

NEW DELHI: Tensions boiled over after Pakistan’s crushing 3-0 ODI series loss to New Zealand, as all-rounder Khushdil Shah was involved in a heated exchange with two Afghan spectators at Bay Oval on Saturday.The confrontation unfolded shortly after the match concluded, adding an unpleasant twist to an already disappointing day for the visitors.According to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), Khushdil was subjected to verbal abuse from individuals in the stands who reportedly hurled anti-Pakistan slogans and inappropriate language.In a statement, the PCB said, ""The Pakistan cricket team management has strongly condemned the abusive language directed at national players by foreign spectators. During the match today, foreign spectators hurled inappropriate remarks at cricketers present on the field.""Also See: RR vs PBKS Live Score, IPL 2025 “When anti-Pakistan slogans emerged, cricketer Khushdil Shah stepped in and urged the spectators to refrain. In response, Afghan spectators escalated the situation by using further inappropriate language in Pashto. Following the Pakistani team's complaint, stadium officials intervened and ejected the two disruptive spectators,” it added.Eyewitness videos circulating on social media showed Khushdil reacting emotionally, appearing to move toward the crowd before being held back by team officials.The incident comes amid an already turbulent tour for Pakistan, who were outclassed in all formats.In the final ODI, Pakistan fell 43 runs short of New Zealand’s 264-8 in a rain-shortened 42-over game.Once again, their batting crumbled under pressure despite a solid start, with Babar Azam (50), Abdullah Shafique (33), and Mohammad Rizwan (37) showing some resistance.Ben Sears continued his sensational run, claiming 5/34 to become the first New Zealander to take back-to-back five-wicket hauls in ODIs.He was ably supported by Jacob Duffy (2/40), who claimed the crucial wicket of Rizwan.Khushdil’s on-field performance was overshadowed by the post-match drama, but the PCB’s swift action and strong stance against spectator misconduct underscore the need for maintaining respect and decorum in international cricket arenas.ALSO READ: Lights out!

Players responded with cheers to Wayne Gretzky’s speech

During the 4 Nations Face-Off final in February 2025, hockey legend Wayne Gretzky gave a heartfelt locker room speech to Team Canada. His wife, Janet Gretzky, shared a video on Instagram showing Wayne shaking hands with team captain Sidney Crosby before addressing the players.In the speech, Wayne Gretzky announced the starting lineup and fired up the team with words about pride, teamwork, and representing their country. The moment sparked loud cheers from the players, showing how much his presence meant.""First of all, congratulations. You made the hockey world proud, ex-players, and of course the country, so good for you guys. It's been fun to watch,"" Gretzky said. ""I know you give up a lot of time to do these kinds of things, but nothing is more fun than playing for the country. So I wish you guys good luck tonight.”Canada went on to win the final in dramatic fashion—beating the USA 3-2 in overtime, with Connor McDavid scoring the winning goal. After the game, Gretzky gave each player a red “Be Great” cap as a personal gesture of encouragement.Though many fans celebrated his role, some criticized him for not wearing a Team Canada jersey and being too friendly with the American team. These reactions were fueled by his past ties with former U.S. President Donald Trump.Donald Trump’s tariffs and remarks about Canada becoming the 51st state have strained U.S.-Canada relations. This week, NHL legend Dominik Hasek criticized Wayne Gretzky’s perceived closeness to Trump, questioning his loyalty to Canada in light of recent events.“It is not surprising to me that Canadian people are asking about the attitude of a man who is a Canadian icon. To be honest, I am also interested in his attitude. He must know best why he does not express himself on this. Be sure to ask him.”Wayne Gretzky has been under fire from some Canadians over his perceived friendship with Donald Trump.

SRH vs GT IPL 2025, Hyderabad weather prediction

Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) face Gujarat Titans (GT) at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad today, desperate to halt a three-match losing streak.Despite an explosive 286-run start to the IPL season, SRH’s all-out attacking approach has backfired, with scores of 190, 163, and 120 in the subsequent games.Their batting stars, including Travis Head, Ishan Kishan, and Heinrich Klaasen, have failed to deliver consistently, and the bowling unit — led by skipper Pat Cummins — has struggled, with high economy rates and no bowler completing four overs in every match.Currently at the bottom of the points table, SRH risk slipping out of playoff contention.In contrast, the Gujarat Titans are gaining momentum, buoyed by a big win over RCB. With a strong top order of Gill, Sudharsan and Buttler, and finishers like Rutherford and Tewatia, they look balanced.While Rabada’s absence is a blow, options like Coetzee or Phillips could fill the gap. Titans also boast a more disciplined bowling attack, giving them an edge.Hyderabad’s red soil pitch promises bounce and carry, but it slows as the ball ages. Despite average boundaries (69m, 67m, 79m), on average 24 sixes are hit per game. It’s a dry, grassless, firm surface. Batting first is ideal, as past matches saw 200+ totals in all innings.Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Aniket Verma, Abhinav Manohar, Pat Cummins (c), Simarjeet Singh, Harshal Patel, Mohammed Shami– Zeeshan Ansari/Adam ZampaSai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill (c), Jos Buttler (wk), Shahrukh Khan, Rahul Tewatia, Arshad Khan, Rashid Khan, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Ishant Sharma– Sherfane Rutherford/Washington SundarPat Cummins (c), Ishan Kishan (wk), Atharva Taide, Abhinav Manohar, Aniket Verma, Sachin Baby, Heinrich Klaasen, Travis Head, Harshal Patel, Kamindu Mendis, Wiaan Mulder, Abhishek Sharma, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Mohammed Shami, Rahul Chahar, Adam Zampa, Simarjeet Singh, Zeeshan Ansari, Jaydev Unadkat and Eshan Malinga.Shubman Gill (C), Jos Buttler, B.

A rainy race day on the cards at the Japanese Grand Prix

After Australia, another wet and wild race is on the cards at the Japanese Grand Prix on Sunday. Red Bull’s Max Verstappen secured pole position on Saturday, setting the stage for the final race at Suzuka. According to the weather forecast, there are chances of rain during the race, which has made his fans even more confident about his victory. However, it's difficult to predict what will happen at the Suzuka Circuit , as it’s not just Verstappen in the race—McLaren’s Lando Norris is also a strong contender and is high on confidence after winning the rain-affected race in Melbourne.The race will start at 2 p.m. local time. It will take place over 53 laps of the 5.807-kilometre Suzuka Circuit and is expected to last around 2 hours.According to the weather forecast shared by the FIA, showers are likely in the morning, which could dampen the dry grass. The temperature is expected to be higher than on the first two days, hovering around 17 degrees Celsius. After the morning showers, it may become a bit cloudy, with slightly reduced chances of rain during the race. However, the timing of the rain is unpredictable, and track conditions could fluctuate between wet and dry throughout the day.The storm and rain in Australia had overturned race strategies for many, resulting in multiple incidents and crashes on the wet track. In Japan, there's more to worry about than just the track. The frequent grass fires during practice sessions and qualifying race left drivers frustrated due to multiple red flags and the loss of precious time. Drivers may lose sleep over the weather prediction for Sunday, but many Formula 1 fans are expecting a more unpredictable and exciting race.As the official X (formerly Twitter) handle of Formula 1 asked the fans, “Anyone packed an umbrella?” many expressed their desire to see a wet race. One fan tweeted, “That would make things interesting.” Another wrote, “I would actually like to see a wet race. More chances to see Max coming out on top.” “Oh, exciting... Australia repeat?” asked a fan. One fan also said sarcastically, “At least the grass won’t burn.” Another comment read, “What’s with F1 scheduling races on every rainy weekend? Get it together, FIA.”Also Read: Grass Fires at the Japanese Grand Prix: Causes, concerns and why current efforts aren't enough Many, including Lewis Hamilton and Oscar Piastri, struggled in the rain-hit season opener in Melbourne.

Gully To Glory: Ramandeep Singh's journey from Chandigarh to Team India via KKR

NEW DELHI: Around five years back, the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) organised open nets for its Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (SMAT) probables at a Delhi University (DU) college ground. Among the hundreds who had assembled was a young Digvesh Singh Rathi who got a chance to bowl after observing action from the sidelines.The batters, featuring plenty of Indian Premier League ( IPL ) regulars, were hitting the ball out of the small North Campus ground, and one of Rathi's deliveries received similar treatment. Without a ball to continue, he walked up to a member of the coaching staff and requested for a replacement, only to be asked to stand in a corner.Also See: IPL Live Score, RR vs PBKS His trial was done. He never got an opportunity to bowl again and didn't feature in the shortlist which was released.Rejection was not new, but the lesson learnt that afternoon changed his bowling and life for good. Not conceding a six became his new obsession, and with no state-level opportunities coming his way, the highly competitive club and corporate fixtures in Delhi-NCR were the only games he looked forward to. Even in those matches, where he was paid for an appearance, not conceding runs remained his motto to keep getting regular games and match fees.""Run lagte hai to bulate nahi hai ye dubara, isi liye kheech ke daalta hu (If I get hit for runs, they don't call again. That's why I bowl tight),"" Rathi would say whenever he was asked about his bowling.A bowler who modelled his game by watching Sunil Narine , Rathi began as the usual off-spinner who bowled a menacing carrom ball in his early days. The art of hiding the ball was picked up by watching Narine, and while it gave him control and kept the economy rate in check, the wickets column didn't have substantial contributions. He identified it as something to be worked on after attending trials for Delhi Capitals and Mumbai Indians, and a plan was prepared.After watching hours of Wanindu Hasranga footage on his phone, Rathi figured out that a googly was needed. He worked on it and finally cracked a delivery which turns differently, and more than his carrom. His regular celebration, before the notebook gesture went viral, was inspired by the Sri Lankan spinner and completed his bowling package.Rathi has played nearly 300 local games, had a stint with Delhi Capitals as a net bowler, played for Delhi U-25 in the 2022-23 season, but the magical paddle went up only at the IPL mega auction in 2024 when Lucknow Super Giants secured him for Rs 30 lakh.Part of the Delhi Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy squad that season, thanks to his exceptional bowling in the Delhi Premier League where he was the find of the season with 14 scalps from 10 games, the 25-year-old watched the auction from his hotel room and was a relieved man. ""IPL khelna hai... ,"" was something he would say often but was lost for words when his phone started buzzing after the bid.Just like his bowling, his cricketing journey has been anything but conventional. The payouts from local games, appearances for Delhi U-25 and net bowler stint allowed him to upgrade his two-wheeler to a Royal Enfield Bullet but the drive to challenge himself in different T20 games only increased.For those who have watched him from a young age, it doesn't come as a surprise that he has conceded just three sixes in four IPL games. All those sixes came against a marauding Sunrisers Hyderabad.He had learnt his lesson during those trials back in the day, and it was his life challenges and the obsession to play the IPL which shaped the bowler he is now.For a bowler who was picked as a backup for Ravi Bishnoi and M Siddharth, Rathi has stormed into a leading role for the Rishabh Pant-led unit and has become the toast of the nation for his celebrations and ice-cool temperament in pressure situations.","Digvesh Singh Rathi has become the toast of the nation for his celebrations and ice-cool temperament in pressure situations.

IPL: Fleming admits batting woes after CSK's third straight defeat

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings head coach Stephen Fleming has brushed aside retirement speculation surrounding MS Dhoni, stating that it’s not his role to end the legendary cricketer’s IPL career. The chatter gained momentum after Dhoni’s parents were spotted at the MA Chidambaram Stadium during CSK’s 25-run defeat to Delhi Capitals on Saturday — their third straight loss in IPL 2025 .“No, that’s not my role to put an end to it. I have no idea. I’m just enjoying working with him. He’s still going strong,” Fleming said at the post-match press conference. “I don’t even ask these days. You guys are the ones that ask.”Dhoni walked in at No. 7 with CSK reeling at 74/5 in the 11th over, but could only manage a 26-ball 30 not out , struggling to find momentum on a slowing pitch. Fleming defended the move, saying it wasn’t a damage-control tactic, but a reflection of tough batting conditions in the second half.“When he went out, the ball started to grip more. Vijay [Shankar] struggled throughout. That 12-16 over period was just very hard to bat. The game was slipping, and even with intent, it was just too much,” he added.On CSK’s continued inconsistency, Fleming stressed the need for more from the top order. “We need more production from the top three or four. That allows power hitters to come in at the right time. Right now, we’re having to introduce players at the wrong moments.”Despite the growing scrutiny, Fleming reaffirmed faith in Dhoni and the team's process.","CSK coach Stephen Fleming dismisses MS Dhoni retirement speculation.

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings ' lack of urgency in a tricky chase cost them dearly as they slumped to a 25-run defeat against Delhi Capitals in their Indian Premier League 2025 clash at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Saturday.Chasing 184, CSK were reeling at 74/5 in 10.4 overs when MS Dhoni walked in — his earliest entry in a full 20-over match since 2023. With 110 needed off 56 balls, he joined Vijay Shankar , who was on 24 off 23. The stage was set for a counterattack, but what followed was a sluggish and baffling passage of play.Despite their reputation as big-hitters, Dhoni and Shankar crawled to just 32 runs in the next 4.2 overs. Shankar eventually brought up his fifty in the 17th over off 43 balls — the slowest half-century of the season. Alarmingly, CSK now account for three of the four slowest fifties in IPL 2025 , raising concerns over the intent of their batters.Also See: IPL Live Score, PBKS vs RR Dhoni, too, endured a forgettable outing.

With this win, DC not only extended their unbeaten streak this season but also scripted their first win at Chepauk in 15 years.The foundation of Delhi’s 183/6 was built on Rahul’s elegant yet powerful 77 off 51 deliveries. Mixing finesse with brute force, the stylish right-hander struck six boundaries and three sixes, anchoring the innings masterfully. Despite a shaky start — losing Jake Fraser-McGurk early to Khaleel Ahmed — Delhi recovered through Abishek Porel’s brisk 33 off 20 and a steady middle-order partnership between Rahul and Sameer Rizvi (20).While Tristan Stubbs added a quickfire 24 not out at the end, Matheesha Pathirana’s tidy final over ensured CSK restricted DC from posting a bigger total.In reply, CSK stumbled early in their chase. Ruturaj Gaikwad, Rachin Ravindra and Devon Conway fell inside the powerplay, with Mitchell Starc, Mukesh Kumar and young spinner Vipraj Nigam (2/27) denting the top order. At 41/3, CSK were always chasing the game.Vijay Shankar fought hard with a well-made 69 not out, and MS Dhoni remained unbeaten on 30, but the asking rate kept climbing. With the pitch offering grip and Delhi’s bowlers maintaining discipline, Chennai managed only 158/5 in their 20 overs.Earlier, DC captain Axar Patel’s cameo (21 off 14) and his six off Jadeja hinted at a flourish, but he too fell after getting set. Rahul, meanwhile, held one end firmly and reached his 38th IPL fifty in style. His knock not only stabilised DC’s innings but also allowed others to play freely around him.With three wins in three games, Delhi Capitals look like early title contenders.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

In a unique farewell , a 55-year-old man was laid to rest in a Snickers-themed coffin , an idea he had often joked about in life and ensured was included in his will.According to a report from SWNS, Paul Broome , from England, was known for his sharp wit and mischievous sense of humour. His family honoured his final wish by commissioning a custom-made casket resembling the iconic chocolate bar. Adding a playful touch, the words ""I'm nuts"" were emblazoned on the coffin, a nod to Broome's fun-loving personality.""Paul's family told us he was a true character, and his farewell needed to reflect that,"" funeral arranger Ali Leggo said. ""His humour and quick wit left a mark on so many, and this was a fitting tribute to his one-of-a-kind spirit.""A passionate supporter of Crystal Palace FC , Broome's devotion to the club was also evident in his farewell, with the team's logo adorning the coffin. His love for the sport ran deep, boasting a collection of over 40 team shirts and treasuring match days at Selhurst Park with his brothers.The funeral procession made a special stop at Broome's favorite café in Bognor Regis , where friends gathered to pay tribute. Dressed in custom-made T-shirts in his honour, they clapped as he made his final journey, turning the moment into a celebration of his life rather than a sombre goodbye.""The family received overwhelming positive feedback from those who attended, many saying the personal touches made the service a true reflection of Paul’s life,"" Leggo added.

When will CSK legend MS Dhoni retire from IPL? Astrologer Greenstone Lobo predicts

HYDERABAD: The philosophy of the Sunrisers Hyderabad batters has been to go hard, no matter what. It took them to the final last season but with their batters struggling to put up similar displays this season, they may have to rethink their strategy.The 2016 champions have suffered three straight defeats and are languishing at the bottom of the table. Pat Cummins ’ side has a lot of ground to regain when they host Gujarat Titans at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Sunday — their first match at the venue after the row over free tickets.Cummins, a strong advocate of their brand of cricket, conceded that their game plan didn’t work in the last three games. “You have to be realistic — three games in a row, it has not come off for us. Our batters are at our best taking it on, but you have to think about if you could take different options,” he said after their 80-run loss to Kolkata Knight Riders.Having posted the league’s second highest total of 286 against Rajasthan Royals in their opener, SRH openers have struggled. While Travis Head has been silenced in the last two games, Abhishek Sharma’s form (33 runs in four matches) has been a concern. Ishan Kishan, after his century on debut, failed to make any impact. The struggle of the top three left too much on the middle-order consisting of Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen and Aniket Verma. A string of low totals—190 vs LSG, 163 vs DC and 120 vs KKR — has not offered enough cushion for their bowling unit.Cummins has an economy rate of 12.30 runs per over, Adam Zampa 11.75 and Mohammed Shami 10 runs per over with none of their top bowlers completing their quota of four overs. Only leg-spinner Zeeshan Ali has been impressive.Unlike the hosts, the visitors will be brimming with confidence after back-to-back wins — a 36-run win over MI followed by an eight-wicket win over RCB.Sai Sudharsan (186 runs) has been consistent at the top while Jos Buttler (166), both of whom are No. 2 and 3 in the batting charts, has struck form with an unbeaten 73 against RCB. Shubman Gill at the top and Sherfane Rutherford in the middle complete the Titans’ batting.Mohammed Siraj was the wrecker-in-chief against RCB and Prasidh Krishna has been doing his bit. Most batters seem to have decoded the Rashid Khan puzzle, but the Titans have been served well by R Sai Kishore. The left-arm spinner has troubled batters with his clever variations. The Titans, though, will miss Kagiso Rabada, who has returned home for personal reasons.","The 2016 champions have suffered three straight defeats and are languishing at the bottom of the table.

‘Pressure on Pant’

LUCKNOW: The thrilling 12-run win over former champions Mumbai Indians on their home ground on Friday night has brought immense joy to the Lucknow Super Giants camp. There was more good news for LSG when head coach Justin Langer confirmed that speedster Mayank Yadav is bowling at “90 to 95 percent” and is close to making his long-awaited return to the IPL.At the post-match press conference, he said, “I thought the 19th over by Shardul Thakur was outstanding. That really kept us in the game. And then obviously Avesh Khan — bowling those tight overs is something he prides himself on — finished off in style with an excellent final over.”Giving an update on Yadav, Langer said: “He’s working very hard at the NCA, and I saw some video of him bowling yesterday — he was bowling at about 90 to 95%. So, Mayank’s up and running, which is great for Indian cricket . For the IPL, we saw the impact he had last year. I don’t think there’s been a bowler in India who’s bowled faster than Mayank Yadav. And that’s why there’s so much talk about him.”Langer added, “He’s up, he’s keen to get going, he bowled well in Bengaluru at the NCA. I think there are a couple of other bowlers at the NCA as well, and hopefully, the NCA — credit to them — have done a very good job. They’ve got Avesh back for us, they’ve got Akash Deep back for us, so we really appreciate the work they’re doing to get the boys back playing. Hopefully, now Mayank too.”On the continued poor run of Rishabh Pant , Langer said, “I’ve got one job, and that’s to keep him smiling. When you come into a new franchise, very often you try too hard and there’s a lot of expectation. He’s the captain of the team, there’s high expectation, and with that often comes the pressure that none of us really understand. We’ll stay with him. We’ll keep him smiling, keep him relaxed—and when he comes good, my gosh. We’ve won 50% of our games so far and Rishabh hasn’t made many runs yet. Imagine when he does start making runs. I cannot wait to see it.”",Lucknow Super Giants beat Mumbai Indians by 12 runs on Friday night.

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals produced a commanding all-round performance to hand Punjab Kings a 50-run defeat in Mullanpur on Saturday. The win was set up by Yashasvi Jaiswal ’s classy 67 and sealed emphatically by Jofra Archer ’s devastating opening burst with the ball.Opening the innings, Jaiswal gave Rajasthan the perfect launchpad with a fluent 67 off just 45 balls. From the outset, Jaiswal looked in complete control, piercing the field with crisp boundaries and lifting the ball cleanly over the ropes. He struck three fours and five sixes in his knock, setting the tone for Royals’ massive 205/4.The left-hander paced his innings smartly, first settling in and then accelerating after the powerplay, particularly taking on leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal and Marcus Stoinis in the middle overs. His fifty was his first of the season and came at a crucial juncture with Rajasthan needing a strong start to bounce back from recent defeats.Jaiswal’s 89-run stand with Sanju Samson (38 off 26) put RR in control early. And after both departed, Riyan Parag (43* off 25) and Shimron Hetmyer (20 off 12) ensured the momentum never dipped, powering the Royals past the 200-run mark.While the batters did the job upfront, it was Jofra Archer who delivered the knockout blow with the ball.Bowling with pace and intent, Archer struck with the very first ball of the innings, removing Punjab opener Priyansh Arya for a duck. The searing delivery beat the batter for pace and rattled the stumps.But Archer wasn’t done.He returned later in the same over to deliver a body blow — the prized scalp of Punjab captain Shreyas Iyer. The right-hander was castled for 10, failing to read a skiddy delivery that breached his defense. Archer finished with figures of 3/25 from four overs, capping his fiery spell by dismissing Arshdeep Singh at the death.The rest of the Rajasthan attack supported him well, with Theekshana and Sandeep Sharma bagging two wickets each. The result was a comprehensive bowling effort that restricted PBKS to just 155/9 in 20 overs, falling 50 runs short.With this win, Rajasthan Royals not only boosted their net run rate but also regained some momentum, thanks to Jaiswal’s stroke-filled fifty and Archer’s thunderbolts with the new ball.","Rajasthan Royals beat Punjab Kings by 50 runs in IPL clash.

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings (CSK) head coach Stephen Fleming has responded sharply to criticism directed at his team on Ravichandran Ashwin’s YouTube channel after their defeat to Delhi Capitals (DC) on Saturday.In a post-match press conference, Fleming appeared surprised when asked about the remarks, admitting he didn’t even know Ashwin had a YouTube channel.The controversy arose after a video featuring former RCB analyst Prasanna Agoram, popularly known as Pdogg, aired on Ashwin’s channel.During the episode, Pdogg questioned CSK's decision to play Afghanistan spinner Noor Ahmad over veterans like Ravindra Jadeja and Ashwin himself. The video was later taken down, sparking curiosity and speculation among fans and the media.When asked about the criticism, Fleming responded with calm dismissal: “I have no idea. I didn’t even know he had a channel, so I don’t follow that stuff. That’s irrelevant.”The incident comes at a tough time for CSK, who suffered their third consecutive loss in IPL 2025 after going down to Delhi Capitals (DC) by 25 runs at Chepauk — their first defeat to DC at home in 15 years.With this victory, DC topped the points table, while CSK find themselves under pressure in the mid-table shuffle.Despite a solid start by DC, thanks to KL Rahul’s composed 77 and some finishing firepower from Tristan Stubbs, CSK faltered in the chase.Star players like Devon Conway, Shivam Dube, and Jadeja failed to convert, while MS Dhoni’s late cameo couldn’t turn the tide.As questions swirl around CSK’s team selection and performance, Fleming’s dismissive stance signals the team’s intent to stay focused on the field -- not the noise off it.",Stephen Fleming responds sharply to criticism directed at his team on Ravichandran Ashwin’s YouTube channel.

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals (RR), now back under the leadership of Sanju Samson , will take on an in-form Punjab Kings (PBKS) in a high-stakes Indian Premier League IPL ) 2025 clash on Saturday.A big focus of the match will be on a struggling Yashasvi Jaiswal , who will be eager to shift attention back to his batting. Jaiswal has had a turbulent few weeks — switching domestic allegiances from Mumbai to Goa amid reported internal rifts and posting underwhelming scores of 1, 29 and 4 in this IPL season. The 22-year-old southpaw, hungry for leadership roles, now finds himself needing runs more than ever, especially after being overlooked for the Champions Trophy squad.Samson’s return as captain comes after RR’s inconsistent run under stand-in skipper Riyan Parag, whose leadership failed to inspire despite a narrow win over Chennai Super Kings. The Royals’ batting remains heavily reliant on Samson, with Shimron Hetmyer expected to provide the finishing firepower. However, Jaiswal and Dhruv Jurel’s form will be key in putting up or chasing a big score.Punjab Kings, meanwhile, come in hot — led impressively by Shreyas Iyer , who has scored back-to-back half-centuries and already smashed 13 sixes in two games, equaling his tally from all of last season. Iyer's tactical nous has stood out too, with sharp field placements and smart bowling changes, including effective use of Glenn Maxwell the spinner, who’s looked sharper than even Yuzvendra Chahal.Rajasthan’s bowling attack — with Jofra Archer, Maheesh Theekshana, Wanindu Hasaranga, and Tushar Deshpande — is solid but not fearsome. Against a power-packed Punjab batting line-up, they will need a minimum of 210 on the board to feel safe.Shreyas Iyer (c), Priyansh Arya, Pyla Avinash, Harnoor Singh, Josh Inglis, Prabhsimran Singh, Vishnu Vinod, Nehal Wadhera, Azmatullah Omarzai, Aaron Hardie, Marco Jansen, Glenn Maxwell, Musheer Khan, Shashank Singh, Marcus Stoinis, Suryansh Shedge, Arshdeep Singh, Xavier Bartlett, Yuzvendra Chahal, Praveen Dubey, Lockie Ferguson, Harpreet Brar, Kuldeep Sen, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Yash Thakur.Sanju Samson (captain), Riyan Parag, Shubham Dubey, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Kunal Rathore, Shimron Hetmyer, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Dhruv Jurel, Nitish Rana, Yudhvir Singh, Jofra Archer, Maheesh Theekshana, Wanindu Hasaranga, Akash Madhwal, Kumar Kartikeya Singh, Tushar Deshpande, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Kwena Maphaka, Ashok Sharma, Sandeep Sharma.",Rajasthan Royals (RR) take on Punjab Kings (PBKS) in a high-stakes Indian Premier League IPL 2025 clash on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: The fans were all set—thunderous roars, cheers, claps, and deafening hoots echoed across the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. They had gathered in anticipation of seeing their beloved 'Thala', Mahendra Singh Dhoni, walk out for the toss on Saturday. But the excitement quickly turned to disappointment when it was Ruturaj Gaikwad , not Dhoni, who strode out alongside Delhi Capitals skipper Axar Patel.The buzz fizzled out. The crowd, expecting a nostalgic return of Dhoni as stand-in captain, fell silent. Dhoni was widely expected to lead Chennai Super Kings against Delhi Capitals in the absence of Gaikwad, who had suffered an elbow injury during CSK ’s last match against Rajasthan Royals.Gaikwad had taken a blow to his right forearm while charging down the pitch against Tushar Deshpande during the game in Guwahati last Sunday.After being put into the field by Delhi Capitals, Gaikwad said at the toss: ""We were looking to bat as well. Looks a bit dry. It's a bit cloudy, won't change much. You always want momentum in T20 cricket. Overall, the chat has been positive. Fielding is something we can improve day by day. We want to be proactive. Elbow is good. Conway comes in for Overton.

IPL 2025 | Kagiso Rabada: 'Even a No. 10 can hit a six... there's no mystery anymore'

MUMBAI: A major talking point during Mumbai Indians ' 12-run defeat to the Lucknow Super Giants at the Ekana Stadium in Lucknow on Friday night in IPL-2025 was the fact that MI retired out their India batter Tilak Varma in the closing stages of the match. In a decision which has triggered a debate and even a controversy-fans on social media are enraged- the left-hander, who has scored two T20I hundreds, was asked to return to the dugout in the penultimate over of a 204-run chase, after coming on as an 'Impact Player' making 25 off 23 balls.When Tilak left the field, MI needed 24 off seven balls with five wickets in hand. The visitors eventually couldn't cross the line, though.TOI has learnt that the decision, which seems harsh on the face of it on the talented batter, was purely taken as Tilak is suffering from a niggle in a finger.""He has a finger injury in his left hand (bottom hand). That’s why he was called back to the dugout. Due to the injury, he wasn’t able to hit with power. This is exactly the reason why he played as an Impact Player. There are otherwise no doubts in the team over Tilak's hitting ability,"" a reliable source tracking the developments told TOI on Saturday. Tilak replaced wrist spinner Vignesh Puthur when MI batted.Also See: IPL Live Score, DC vs CSK In his post-match press conference, MI head coach Mahela Jayawardene said it had been his decision to retire Tilak out. ""He just wanted to get going but he couldn't. [We] waited till the last few overs, hoping that [he would find his rhythm], because he had spent some time there so he should have been able to get that hit out of the way, but I just felt that at the end, I just needed someone fresh to go, and he was struggling. These things happen in cricket. Not nice to take him out but I had to do that, it was a tactical decision at that point,"" Jayawardene said.When Tilak walked out to bat, MI were on track at 86 for three after 8.1 overs. Tilak put on 66 off 48 balls with Suryakumar Yadav (67 off 43 balls) for the fourth wicket, but while Suryakumar contributed 46 off 30 to the partnership, Tilak struggled for fluency, managing to score just 17 off 18 balls.MI captain Hardik Pandya (28 not out off 16 balls), who took his maiden fiver (5-36) in T20 cricket earlier in the match, was at the other end when they took the decision to retire Tilak.""I think that was obvious. We needed some hits, and he was not [able to get them]. Sometimes in cricket one of those days comes, when you really want to try but it does not happen, but the decision [speaks for] itself, why we did it,"" ,"" Hardik told the broadcasters after the match.",MI coach Mahela Jayawardene said it was his decision to retire Tilak Varma.

NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants held their nerve to clinch a thrilling 12-run victory over Mumbai Indians in Match 16 of IPL 2025 at the Ekana Cricket Stadium on Friday.While Mitchell Marsh’s explosive 60 (off 31 balls) and Hardik Pandya ’s five-wicket haul dominated headlines early on, it was young leg-spinner Digvesh Singh Rathi who turned the tide in LSG’s favour with a sensational spell under pressure and notched up the Player of the Match award in the process.Batting first, LSG posted a commanding 203/8, thanks to Marsh’s 60 off 31 balls and late fireworks from David Miller (27 off 14).Hardik Pandya was the pick of the MI bowlers, bagging five wickets, including key dismissals of Nicolas Pooran, Rishabh Pant, David Miller, and Aiden Markram, keeping MI within reach.However, the real story unfolded in the second innings, where Mumbai seemed to be cruising with Suryakumar Yadav in ominous form.At 86/2 in the 9th over, MI looked set to chase the target down. But Digvesh Singh Rathi, playing only his second IPL match, changed the game with a crucial breakthrough. He removed the dangerous Naman Dhir for 46 with a sharp delivery that skidded on and bowled him, derailing MI’s momentum.The spinner's figures of 1/21 were not just economical, but tactically brilliant.Bowling with superb control and guile, he applied pressure in the middle overs, conceding just 11 runs in his final two overs when MI were gearing up for a final assault.His tight spell forced the batters to take risks at the other end, eventually leading to Suryakumar’s dismissal in the 17th over.Even with Hardik Pandya launching a late onslaught, LSG’s total proved just out of reach for MI, who ended at 191/5.Rathi’s composure and fearless approach stood out, marking him as a rising star in LSG’s ranks.This win lifts LSG to sixth on the table and gives their campaign fresh momentum.For MI, questions remain over their middle-order finishing and death bowling.

Jos Buttler Exclusive Interview: I owe Jayawardene for letting me open in T20

Saturday served up a doubleheader delight for IPL fans. In the opening clash, Delhi Capitals extended their unbeaten streak in IPL 2025 with a 25-run victory over five-time champions Chennai Super Kings at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Later in the evening, Rajasthan Royals produced a dominant performance, thrashing Punjab Kings by 50 runs at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium.Delhi Capitals climbed to the top of the IPL 2025 points table with a historic win at Chepauk, their first victory at the venue since 2010. Powered by a classy 77 from KL Rahul, who opened in place of the injured Faf du Plessis, DC posted a competitive 183/6. Chennai Super Kings, despite a valiant unbeaten 69 from Vijay Shankar, managed only 158/5 in response, handing Delhi a 25-run win.DC’s bowlers executed their plans to perfection on a surface that didn’t allow free stroke-play. Vipraj Nigam impressed with figures of 2/27, while the rest of the bowling unit chipped in, barring Mohit Sharma and Axar Patel.Mukesh Kumar gave DC the ideal start, removing Rachin Ravindra with a return catch off a leading edge. Mitchell Starc then trapped Ruturaj Gaikwad with a short ball that was pulled straight to deep square leg. Nigam joined the party by dismissing Devon Conway, and CSK’s powerplay ended at a shaky 46/3.With the pitch slowing down, DC kept Shivam Dube and Shankar in check. Dube eventually fell for 18 to Nigam, and Kuldeep Yadav struck with a googly to trap Ravindra Jadeja leg-before for two. Though Shankar was given a few lifelines—two dropped chances and a missed lbw—he broke a 28-ball boundary drought with a couple of crisp shots, bringing up his fifty off 43 balls.MS Dhoni, playing in front of his family, provided late fireworks with an unbeaten 30 off 26 balls, but the target proved too much as CSK suffered their second consecutive home loss. Yashasvi Jaiswal returned to form in style, scoring a fluent 67 to lead Rajasthan Royals to a commanding 50-run win over Punjab Kings at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium in Mullanpur.Jaiswal, who had struggled in his first three outings, struck three fours and five sixes in his 45-ball knock, sharing an 89-run opening stand with skipper Sanju Samson (38). Riyan Parag (43* off 25) and Shimron Hetmyer (20) provided the finishing touches as RR posted a daunting 205/4—the first 200-plus total at the venue in six matches.In reply, Punjab never recovered from the double blow inflicted by Jofra Archer in the first over. Archer dismissed Priyansh Arya with the first ball of the innings and sent back captain Shreyas Iyer with the last, finishing with 3/25.Despite a counterattacking 62 off 41 balls from Nehal Wadhera and a brisk 30 from Glenn Maxwell, Punjab’s chase crumbled. The pair added 88 runs before Maheesh Theekshana dismissed Maxwell, and Wanindu Hasaranga struck the next ball to remove Wadhera. Punjab eventually finished on 155/9, suffering their first loss of the season.","Delhi Capitals climb to the top of the IPL 2025 points table with a historic win at Chepauk, their first victory at the venue since 2010.

Munich: Bayern Munich legend Thomas Muller confirmed on Saturday the club will not offer him a new contract bringing an end to his 25-year career with the Bundesliga giants at the end of the campaign.The 35-year-old, whose contract was set to expire in the summer, said in a post on social media the decision was made by the club and ""not what I would have wished"".Muller said he did not like how the contract saga played out ""back and forth in public"" in recent months but he ""felt the appreciation from everyone involved after my long time with Bayern"".""The special connection to the club and our fantastic fans will always remain,"" he said.Muller came through the Bayern junior system and has won two Champions Leagues along with 12 Bundesliga titles.His focus was now on ""bringing the league title back to Munich"" as well as reaching this season's Champions League final, which will be held in Bayern's Allianz Arena home.Later on Saturday, Bayern issued a statement saying Muller would be honoured with a testimonial match and that the midfielder would play at the Club World Cup in July.""Thomas Muller had the definition of a Bavarian fairytale career,"" club president Herbert Hainer said.Muller was born in the nearby Bavarian town of Weilheim and joined the club aged 10, making his debut under coach Jurgen Klinsmann in 2008 against a Hamburg side featuring current Bayern coach Vincent Kompany.A one-club player, Muller's 743 matches for Bayern in all competitions is the most in the team's history. He has registered 247 goals and 273 assists for the club in that time.In recent seasons, Muller has started from the bench more regularly, leading to growing speculation he could leave the club.The midfielder did not reveal where he would play next season, although German media has speculated he could make a late-career move to the United States to play in the MLS .Former teammate at Bayern Eric-Maxim Choupo Moting, who plays for the New York Red Bulls in the MLS, told Kicker that Muller was ""welcome here"" in March.""Thomas is a Bayern legend so I would be happy for him if he continues there.
