Cardi B responds to the rising backlash

In late December, New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs was once again the center of attention on social media. This time, it wasn't because of how he played on the field, but because of a postgame incident with his partner Cardi B that went viral. The video, which looked like Diggs practicing a proposal at MetLife Stadium, rapidly went viral and brought up the couple's high-profile relationship again.The timing of the occasion made the reaction stronger, since it happened at a time when Cardi B was already getting a lot of hate and Diggs' personal life was getting a lot of attention again.After the Patriots beat the New York Jets, cameras caught Diggs kneeling in front of Cardi B on the field. The scene seemed like a proposal for a few seconds, with the rapper in a bright pink outfit and Diggs getting ready to do something big. A few seconds later, it was evident that the wide receiver was just fixing her gear before hugging her.Even though the explanation was innocent, the clip went viral on social media, with admirers picking apart every aspect. Some people complimented the couple for being confident enough to deal with the limelight, while others said Diggs was trying to get headlines at a time when his life off the field is already under a lot of scrutiny.The video that went viral came out only days after Cardi B openly defended her relationship with Diggs against criticism. The rapper used social media to talk to followers who were upset with her decisions, especially after the couple spent Christmas apart not long after they had their first child together.Cardi B told her detractors to ""calm down"" in a candid and emotional way, making it plain that she had no plans to change her life to please what others were saying online. Some people agreed with her comments, praising her honesty, while others disagreed and started more arguments.Diggs' romance is back in the news at a bad time for the veteran receiver. In early December, Diggs was charged with felony strangling or suffocation and minor assault in Massachusetts after an argument with a former coworker. Diggs has completely refuted the claims, and his lawyers say they are unfounded and based on a conflict about money.The New England Patriots have said in public that they back Diggs while they continue to gather information as the legal process moves on. Still, the crisis has put his personal life under more scrutiny than ever before.","New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs was once again the center of attention on social media.

These endorsements contribute to his wealth, but at the same time, they maintain his game-oriented image in the eyes of the public. He also invested carefully, instead of gambling on high-profile projects, Scherzer was interested in stability and long-term growth. Such a disciplined manner is a reflection of how he prepares for every start.Max’s wife, Erica May-Scherzer, is a former softball player who has experience at the collegiate administrative level, giving her an understanding of professional sports. Owing to her professional player background, Erica has been a great contributor to the success of Scherzer in his career and has helped the couple on and off the field.

NBA’s tunnel fashion game is evolving at a tremendous rate and has cemented itself as one of the major pre-game events, giving the players the feeling of walking down the red carpet. It features not just casual wear but also high-end luxury items from various labels. This opportunity provides the players to leverage their looks for personal branding and generate online buzz. From wearing clothes from different brands to promoting their own, the pre-game corridor is a social media phenomenon with incredible marketing force.Here are five active stars who have successfully traded the jersey for the designer’s sketchpad.Westbrook’s Honor the Gift is one of the best player-owned brands. Founded in 2016, this brand offers premium men’s and women’s apparel and accessories inspired by LA culture. The label has moved far beyond athlete merch and has become a staple in high-end boutiques, known for its heavy knits, vintage aesthetics, premium streetwear cuts, and high-quality material. It’s a brand built on self-belief and reflects Westbrook’s journey from the inner-city to global success.Kyle Kuzma launched Childhood Dream in collaboration with Puma with a motto that “dream works too.” Kuzma’s fashion taste from his tunnel outfits could be seen as bold, unapologetic, and loud. Be it the extremely oversized pink sweater or the rainbow knitted cardigan and face mask, he owns what he wears.Through Childhood Dreams, the brand has leaned more into nostalgia, utilizing retro color palettes and 90s-inspired silhouettes reflecting Kuzama’s personal style while focusing significantly on sustainable fashion.During the 2020 NBA season, Jimmy Butler found the coffee lacking, so he bought his own espresso machine and sold a cup for around $20. He filed for the trademark and launched BIGFACE in 2021. The brand opened its Miami flagship in 2024 and has since expanded its apparel line into high-end off-duty uniforms. The clothing mirrors Butler’s personality: focused, premium, and intentionally unique.While LeBron has a lifetime deal with Nike, his creative heart lives in UNKNWN. He co-founded this brand with his childhood friends, Jason Kanfer and Frankie Walker Jr. The brand’s physical store was opened in Miami’s Aventura Mall in 2011, offering various external labels and and in 2019, it introduced its first private “001 collection.”UNKNWN remains a massive influence in the streetwear scene, frequently collaborating with titans like Thom Browne.Taking a page from the Michael Jordan playbook, Stephen Curry launched Curry Brand under the Under Armour umbrella. While it focuses on performance, it also saw a massive push into lifestyle apparel this year. The line reflects Curry's understated but precise style, offering everything from technical golf gear to minimalist street pieces. As of late 2025, Stephen Curry and Under Armour parted ways after 12 years of partnership, making the Curry Brand fully independent.Also read: From Seoul to courtside: how many NBA games has BTS star Suga attended?","NBA's tunnel fashion game is evolving at a tremendous rate.

Stefon Diggs defended his little brother Trevon Diggs whenever necessary

NFL interceptions leader 2021 Trevon Diggs would often go to his big brother for football advice





MLFootball recently shared on X that Pro Bowl cornerback Trevon Diggs said his brother Stefon Diggs has been a “father figure” to him since their father passed away when he was 10. Trevon said Stefon is “like my dad” and “my father figure.” Let’s go back in time to see when the [now, former] Dallas Cowboys cornerback said that.“[Stefon] is like my dad, honestly,” Trevon said via ESPN’s Turron Davenport in April 2020. “He was there for me when my father passed, so he has always taken care of me. I always ask him everything, no matter what. Two o’clock in the morning, I’m asking him questions. I called him last night, every day, about this [2020 NFL Draft] process, and how he managed.”An age difference of nearly five years, combined with a heart-wrenching loss at a young age, could have affected Stefon. He was only 14 when he had to take on family responsibilities: caring for his mother, Stephanie, his sister, Porsche Green, and his brothers, Trevon and Mar’Sean. His father, Aron Diggs, passed away in 2008 at 39 from congestive heart failure.“Stefon could have gone to any college in the country, but he chose to stay close to home,” Stephanie said.“I sat Stefon down in high school and told him he had to make good decisions and set a good example because your brother looks up to you.”Diggs went to Our Lady of Good Counsel High School in Olney, Maryland. He used to watch Trevon to and from school. He was always there to defend his little brother when needed. “People didn’t want to mess with me because I would tell them I’d call my brother,” Trevon said.When he needed advice, the New England Patriots wide receiver would often tell him, “Do what’s best for your life.” Trevon chose The University of Alabama instead of Maryland to carve out his own football career. Knowing he would often be compared to his older brother, he picked a different school to create his own legacy.“He did the Maryland thing and tore it up. Why would I go somewhere where a bar is already set?” Trevon said. “I’d always be in comparison to everything that he did. I was even playing receiver at the time. I wasn’t trying to be under his shadow.”Talking about Alabama, Trevon said, “It was the best school for me. There were so many players down there. I wanted to be the best program and win championships.”Trevon’s Alabama teammate, Terrell Lewis, highlighted Stefon’s significant influence on Trevon: “His brother plays a big role. If there’s anybody he’s going to consult with, it’s his brother. You can tell he gets all of his insight and advice from his big brother. That’s a blessing to have someone in your corner like that.”Also Read: Patriots star WR Stefon Diggs’ full incident report from the Dedham Police Department made public",Trevon Diggs said his brother Stefon has been a “father figure” to him since their father passed away when he was 10.

Micah Parsons and CeeDee Lamb are two of the biggest stars on the Dallas Cowboys roster. Both are young, famous, and earning serious money in the NFL. Fans often ask the same thing when their names come up together. Who is richer right now? The answer comes down to contracts, endorsements, and how far each career has gone so far.Micah Parsons entered the NFL in 2021 as a first-round pick by the Dallas Cowboys. He signed a four-year rookie contract worth about $17 million, fully guaranteed.The Cowboys also picked up his fifth-year option, which keeps him under contract through the 2025 season.

Fernandes, older and with a longer global profile, boasts a higher net worth and lucrative endorsements. Ødegaard, though earning less, has performance-based incentives in his deal. Both are among England's highest-paid midfielders.

Bruno Fernandes vs. Martin Ødegaard: Financial differences

Earnings hierarchy

Casemiro (Manchester United): £350,000/week (~$470,000 Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United): £300,000/week (~$400,000) Bernardo Silva (Manchester City): £300,000/week (~$400,000) Kai Havertz (Arsenal): £280,000/week (~$370,000) Martin Ødegaard / Declan Rice (Arsenal): £240,000/week (~$320,000)





Bruno Fernandes and Martin Ødegaard are two names that are ruling the Premier League midfield. They both serve as captains for their teams - Manchester United for Fernandes and Arsenal for Ødegaard. And both have a strong fanbase when it comes to their talent and charisma both on and off the field. To understand where these two sit in the hierarchy of Premier League superstars, let's compare these two defining creative forces of this era.At 31, Bruno Fernandes is in the ""prime veteran"" stage of his career, allowing him to negotiate a higher base salary during his 2024 renewal. Martin Ødegaard, being 27, is on a high-value long-term deal signed in late 2023. While Ødegaard’s earning is lower, his contract has multiple add-ons with heavier incentives related to Arsenal’s recent title charges and Champions League qualification.Bruno Fernandes holds a slight edge in net worth due to his longer career span at the top of the global game and his status as a national icon for Portugal, alongside Cristiano Ronaldo. This has granted him access to lucrative global endorsements, like Nike and Gillette, that Martin Ødegaard is only now beginning to match. With his international profile with the Norway national team growing, the latter is making up for the late entry to the game.Bruno Fernandes is known for a conservative but high-value property portfolio in Lisbon, Manchester, and the Algarve. His investments are geared toward post-career stability in mind. Ødegaard, on the other hand, has focused heavily on tech investments and sports startups in Scandinavia, reflecting a younger generation’s approach to wealth management.In the current 2025/26 landscape, Bruno Fernandes and Martin Ødegaard remain two of the highest-paid midfielders in England. Here is how the top bracket looks:Both midfielders try to bring their best game in every match, and are two of the biggest names in the current English Premier League. Fernandes's net worth at current is around £50 million (~$63.5 million), while Ødegaard has accumulated a fortune worth of £20-25 million (~$25 - $35 million).Also Read: Bruno Fernandes and Ana Pinho Combined Net Worth in 2025: Manchester United career, salary, investments and more","Bruno Fernandes and Martin Ødegaard are two of the biggest names in the current English Premier League.

Joseph Parker and Andy Lee represent a boxing victory that still attracts fans. Wise investments and brand deals are also factors of their financial trajectory apart from boxing careers. The former WBO heavyweight champion, Parker, still brings in millions from fights and endorsements while the retired WBO middleweight champion, Lee, maintains his fortune through coaching, commentary, and making good financial choices.Joseph Parker has made a property investment and lives a nice lifestyle in New Zealand, where he manages family life and boxing training at the same time. Lee’s living comparatively and modestly is still an ongoing process that comes from Parker’s competition with him, and that is the reason he can still mentor others.Parker’s comeback victories over Deontay Wilder and Zhilei Zhang have also increased his fight purses. The reports say that he gets $1.5 million for each fight. Parker's financial status is probably to be significantly enhanced, though, as Wardley and Dubois are going to create difficult fights, earning him more money apart from his fight purses.Apart from this, he gets a cut from the pay-per-view revenues besides his fight purses and has endorsement contracts that steadily reinforce his position as one of the richest heavyweight boxers in this era.His sponsorships and public appearances are also contributing to his financial security. It is very easy to approach him, and he also keeps it simple. Parker is sometimes overtly issues his Samoan background and connections to the community.Lee’s career highlights are winning the WBO title in 2014 against Matt Korobov plus a record of 35 wins, 24 by knockout. After retiring, he began to coach and do television commentary, training boxers like Tyson Fury and participating in the boxing world, which still earns him money. Lee focuses on the coaching and commentary side of the sport, thus making sure that the income after retirement is not so unstable.Parker and Lee together will have a combined net worth of $25-$37 million in 2025, which proves that their relevance in the boxing world as well as in other fields has been continuous and strong.Also Read: Joseph parker net worth in 2025: Boxing career, earnings, endorsements, lifestyle and more","Former WBO heavyweight champion, Parker, still brings in millions from fights and endorsements.

With their star player injured, the Indiana Pacers were forced into a development and survival mode, leaning heavily on Bennedict Mathurin while their title window stays frustratingly closed for a year.Nuggets announced on 30th December 2025, that the MVP contender is out for at least four weeks after suffering a left knee hyperextension in a matchup against Miami.For the Denver Nuggets, Jokić isn't just a player, he is their core system, and his absence puts immense pressure on Jamal Murray and Aaron Gordon on the offensive side. With the Western Conference filled with heavyweights, this 4-week stretch turns the tables for the worse.The dunking star suffered an ankle sprain back in October and then another ankle sprain in December. These repetitive injuries could potentially become a stumbling block for the Grizzlies during the playoffs. Memphis remains a contender only when Morant is on the floor, and this constant uncertainty gives a shaky foundation for their championship dream.The Dallas Mavericks have spent most of 2025 trying to fill in the gap left by their superstar point guard, Kyrie Irving, who sustained a torn left ACL in early March against the Kings. Irving’s injury abruptly ended his 2024-25 campaign and forced the Mavericks into a difficult spot. Despite the arrival of Anthony Davis and the rookie sensation Cooper Flagg, the team has struggled in clutch situations without Irving’s elite shot-making.With Kevin Durant's addition to the team, Rockets are currently Houston to a top-four standing. But without their key two-way player, Fred VanVleet, who suffered an ACL injury in September, the Rockets are missing their vital component. VanVleet’s influence on the team’s culture is commendable, and his loss was a significant hit to the team. The 2019 NBA champion’s absence forces young stars like Amen Thompson into high-pressure roles.Also read: Is Nikola Jokic’s NBA MVP bid slipping away as knee injury lingers for Denver Nuggets star?","With the NBA's expansion, every game demands more from players on the hardwood.

Christian Barmore domestic assault charge explained as case heads to arraignment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/christian-barmore-domestic-assault-charge-explained-as-case-heads-to-arraignment/articleshow/126278689.cms,"Image credit: X

What the misdemeanor domestic assault charge against Christian Barmore means legally

Patriots acknowledge situation as NFL monitors case





Christian Barmore, one of the New England Patriots’ key defensive linemen, is facing a new off-field legal issue. Court records show the Patriots defensive tackle has been charged with a misdemeanor domestic assault and battery, a development that surfaced through Massachusetts court documents this week. The charge places Barmore under legal scrutiny at a time when NFL teams are closely watched for how they respond to off-field matters involving players. While the case is still in its early stages, it has already drawn attention from the Patriots organization and the league.According to court records, Barmore is facing a single count of domestic assault and battery, which is classified as a misdemeanor under Massachusetts law. He is scheduled to be arraigned in district court, a procedural step where the charge will be formally read and he will have the opportunity to enter a plea.At this stage, it is important to note that Barmore has been charged, not convicted. An arraignment does not determine guilt and is simply the beginning of the legal process. Any potential consequences, either legally or from the NFL, would come later and depend on how the case proceeds.Court documents state that the charge stems from an alleged incident that occurred in August at a residence in Massachusetts. The alleged victim is described in the police complaint as a woman with whom Barmore shares a child.According to the complaint, an argument between the two escalated, and the woman later told police that Barmore allegedly grabbed her phone, threw her to the ground, and grabbed her clothing near the neck area before letting her go. The incident was reportedly witnessed by their child. The woman later provided photos to authorities that she said showed bruising.All details referenced in this section are based solely on court documents and police reports. Barmore has not been convicted, and the allegations have not been tested in court.The New England Patriots have acknowledged awareness of the situation. The team said it informed the NFL and is monitoring the matter while allowing the legal process to play out. No immediate disciplinary action has been announced by the team or the league.Under the NFL’s personal conduct policy, the league can choose to review a case independently of the court system. Any potential league discipline would typically come after more information becomes available through legal proceedings.Barmore has been a significant piece of the Patriots’ defensive front, and any uncertainty surrounding his availability naturally draws attention. Even without immediate roster consequences, situations like this create added scrutiny for both the player and the organization.For now, the Patriots appear to be taking a wait-and-see approach, as is common in cases that are still in the early legal stages.Also read - Nikki Bella and Cooper DeJean dating rumors: how it all started and where things stand",New England Patriots defensive tackle Christian Barmore charged with misdemeanor domestic assault and battery.

Why Victor Wembanyama’s Availability Matters for the San Antonio Spurs (December 31, 2025)





on Tuesday night. He is not listed on the injury report for the Spurs’ December 31 game against the New York Knicks, confirming his availability for the New Year’s Eve matchup.The timing matters. This game is a rematch of the NBA Cup Final, and San Antonio enters it dealing with injuries elsewhere on the roster. With key teammates sidelined or uncertain, Wembanyama’s presence carries added importance for a Spurs team trying to finish the year on a strong note.Victor Wembanyama comes into the game healthy after playing heavy minutes in a recent loss to Cleveland. In that outing, he scored 26 points, grabbed 14 rebounds, and added three assists. There were no issues afterward, and the Spurs cleared him without restriction.Through the season, Wembanyama is averaging 24.0 points, 11.7 rebounds, and 3.0 blocks per game. His production places him among the league’s top performers, often mentioned in the same conversations as Nikola Jokić. Against New York, much of the focus will be on his work on the glass, where he has consistently cleared double-digit rebounds.San Antonio will be short-handed. Devin Vassell remains out with a right adductor strain and is not expected to return until early January.His absence removes a reliable scorer and perimeter defender from the lineup.Stephon Castle is listed as questionable due to a left thumb sprain. The former Rookie of the Year has played a key role this season, and his status will likely be decided closer to tip-off. Aside from those two, no other major Spurs players are dealing with confirmed injuries.Tuesday’s game revisits the NBA Cup Final, a result the Spurs have not moved past. Wembanyama has already said the team “owes” the Knicks one after that loss, making this matchup more than just another regular-season game.From a basketball standpoint, analysts expect San Antonio to lean heavily on Wembanyama at both ends. His size and reach present problems for New York, while the Knicks will look for contributions from role players such as Miles McBride to counter his impact.When Wembanyama is on the floor, defenses adjust. He draws attention in the paint, creates space for teammates, and protects the rim. In the earlier meeting with New York, he delivered several momentum-shifting plays, including a powerful finish inside.Also read: Is Josh Hart playing tonight vs the San Antonio Spurs? Latest update on the New York Knicks star's injury report (December 31, 2025) With Vassell out and Castle uncertain, the Spurs will once again ask Wembanyama to carry the load.

Against the New York Knicks, San Antonio’s chances begin and end with him.","Victor Wembanyama is not listed on the San Antonio Spurs' injury report for Tuesday's game against the New York Knicks.

Jarred Kelenic joins Chicago White Sox on minor league deal





Jarred Kelenic is getting another chance to stay in Major League Baseball. On Monday, in early 2026, the 26-year-old outfielder signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox, according to ESPN. The deal includes an invitation to major league spring training in Arizona. For Jarred Kelenic, this move is about one thing, finding a way back to regular MLB playing time.Once seen as a future star, Jarred Kelenic has spent the last few seasons fighting inconsistency. The White Sox offer him a new place, a new staff, and a clear chance to compete. With Chicago still reshaping its roster, this signing gives both sides something to gain.Jarred Kelenic was drafted sixth overall in the 2018 MLB Draft by the New York Mets. At that time, he was one of the most talked-about young players in baseball.By December 2018, the Mets traded him to the Seattle Mariners in a major deal that brought Robinson Canó and Edwin Díaz to New York.Jarred Kelenic made his MLB debut in May 2021 with Seattle, playing as a left-handed hitting outfielder known for speed and defense.However, his bat never stayed hot for long. Across five MLB seasons, he posted a .211 batting average, with a high strikeout rate of over 30 percent, according to MLB.com data.His best stretch came in 2023, when he hit .253 with 11 home runs and 49 RBIs in 105 games for Seattle.That season took a sharp turn in July 2023, when he broke his left foot after kicking a water cooler in frustration.Speaking to reporters in Seattle after the injury, Jarred Kelenic said, “I let emotions get the best of me. I take full responsibility. It can’t happen.”Seattle traded Jarred Kelenic to the Atlanta Braves before the 2024 season. He became Atlanta’s everyday center fielder and hit a career-high 15 home runs, but strikeouts remained an issue.In 2025, his season unraveled fast. He hit .167 in 24 games and was publicly criticized by Ronald Acuña Jr. for lack of hustle during a game in Atlanta.Now in Chicago, Jarred Kelenic joins a White Sox team that has stayed active this offseason. The club recently added Anthony Kay and Japanese slugger Munetaka Murakami.With the White Sox reportedly listening to trade offers for Luis Robert Jr., there may be a path for outfield playing time if Jarred Kelenic performs well in spring training.For now, this deal is small on paper.

How the Boston Celtics Have Adjusted





as he recovers from a right Achilles tendon rupture suffered during the 2025 playoffs. As December 2025 ends, the team has not set a return date. Boston is focused on getting him fully healthy rather than pushing for an early comeback.The Celtics have stayed consistent in their approach. Even with the team holding its ground in the standings, Tatum continues to be listed as out on injury reports. Clearance will only come once the medical staff is fully satisfied with his recovery.Tatum tore his Achilles in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the New York Knicks last spring. The injury ended his postseason immediately and changed the direction of the series. Boston went on to lose in six games, closing the season earlier than expected.He underwent surgery on May 13, 2025. For players at his level, Achilles recovery usually takes nine to twelve months, which made it clear early on that his return would likely come deep into the 2025-26 season, if at all.Jayson Tatum’s rehab has moved forward without setbacks. He returned to on-court workouts by late September and was dunking again by October.By December, people around the team said he wants to play this season and has been fully committed to the process.That progress has not changed Boston’s stance. The Celtics reportedly sought opinions from multiple doctors and have continued to rule him out for games, including late-December matchups. The message has been steady: no shortcuts.Head coach Joe Mazzulla and team president Brad Stevens have both stressed patience. With Boston Celtics posting a strong record without Tatum, there is no urgency to take risks. Some around the league expect a possible late-season return if conditions are right, while others believe he may sit out the entire year.Tatum has echoed that thinking, saying he feels no pressure to rush and wants to return only when he is fully ready.Jaylen Brown has taken on a larger scoring role and led the offense with consistency. Derrick White and the rest of the rotation have filled gaps on both ends, keeping Boston near the top of the Eastern Conference.The team has stayed competitive without its star. When Tatum does return, the Celtics expect to add him to a group that has already learned how to win without him.","Jayson Tatum tore his Achilles in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the New York Knicks last spring.

Mizkif reflects on OTK’s decline and explains why Jschlatt stepped away from streaming





Mizkif’s comments about One True King and its slow decay have recently caught the attention of fans. OTK was founded in 2020, with him being one of the co-creators, and quickly became one of the most recognizable names in esports and other content. Mizkif addressed OTK member ExtraEmily’s latest statement, where she revealed her contract would soon expire.The streamer offered a blunt take on what happened to the organization after he left, taking a dig at how his own organization kicked him out and how they thought they could make it grow without him. In his latest stream, Mizkif admitted that the company fizzled out once he left and has been on a downward trajectory ever since.During a Just Chatting livestream clip that surfaced on December 30, 2025, Mizkif reacted to ExtraEmily’s announcement and suggested her future may lie outside OTK. He used the moment to reflect on his own exit and the aftermath. The streamer took delight in the news and told his fans that it had been a great week for him.He said, “Damn! That's an interesting one. She's leaving OTK! Damn! Damn! Man, I remember when people were saying, when I was removed from OTK, how that, ‘We don't need Miz,’ and that they can fix the org, and they don't need me, and they can build it up themselves, and they can grow it, and it will be successful.”Later in the stream, Mizkif’s comments also addressed lingering questions about former OTK member Jschlatt, who quietly stepped away from the group in 2022. The streamer said, “I think Schlatt is someone that truly just doesn't like the spotlight.” He added that Jschlatt would need to be drunk on live streams to tolerate the spotlight.He continued emphasizing that Schlatt struggled with live attention, stating, “Every time I would hang out with him… I think he likes making videos. I just think he didn't like streaming. And that's fine.” These remarks come amid renewed scrutiny of Mizkif himself.

What is going on with Auston Matthews?

Auston Matthews' injury update for Maple Leafs' next games







Toronto Maple Leafs captain Auston Matthews is hospitalized and deemed day-to-day due to a lower-body injury that he got in the overtime defeat against the Detroit Red Wings on Sunday. Matthews, who blocked a shot in the second period, spent only a minute off the ice before coming back to complete the game. Nevertheless, there was an effort, and the team confirmed that he will not be playing on Tuesday in the home game against the New Jersey Devils.The Maple Leafs have already suffered a trail of injuries. Defenseman Chris Tanev is still out with a lower-body problem, and it is his second absence of the season of at least 23 games since he was out with an upper-body injury previously. Centre Dakota Joshua is also out as he undergoes treatment for a kidney trauma against the Red Wings.Toronto had Matt Benning and Jacob Quillan from the Toronto Marlies of the AHL to fill the gaps in the lineup. Quillan has been among the best performers of the Marlies this season, as he has been the leading scorer of the team, besides demonstrating consistent defensive performance. Benning is a veteran who has played in more than 460 NHL games and will be a good depth player on the blue line.This season, Matthews, 27, has been credited with 15 goals and 12 assists in 33 games, and is second in the Maple Leafs in goals and faceoff wins and fourth in points with 27. His absence is a big blow to the Toronto team, who are still in last position in the Atlantic Division but only four points behind a playoff position as they face off a difficult run of games.Also Read: Net worth of Auston Matthews in 2025: Details on Vegas Golden Knights captain's earnings, salary, and contracts",Toronto Maple Leafs captain Auston Matthews is hospitalized and deemed day-to- day due to a lower-body injury.

Chris Tanev out for Toronto Maple Leafs' next game and what it means for the team







The hopes of the Toronto Maple Leafs to have a healthy roster have been struck again. Another setback to Toronto will be the absence of defenceman Chris Tanev in the next game because of a lower-body injury, which will further hurt their quest to rise up the Atlantic Division ladder. Tanev is one of the most important shutdown defenders. Hence, his absence is especially frightening since he had missed an earlier 23 games of the current season due to an upper-body problem.Tanev is infectious on the ice, as the teammates and even the analysts of the team refer to his presence on the ice due to his leadership, positioning, and dependability during critical situations.Chris Tanev, the central shutdown defenceman of the Toronto Maple Leafs, is injured with a lower-body injury and is a game-time decision, which leaves a major defensive void. Auston Matthews, the team captain, is also a game-time decision, having suffered a lower-body injury in the overtime defeat to the Detroit Red Wings on Sunday. William Nylander is still on a day-to-day, and is unlikely to play a second consecutive game, which makes it even tougher on Toronto.The Maple Leafs recalled young centre Jacob Quillan in order to fill the gaps in the team, who is from the Toronto Marlies. He has been a promising prospect in the AHL this season, scoring 23 points in 26 games.The estimated team of Toronto will consist of both more experienced and younger players, where Tanev will most likely be missed on defence.

Rumors of a Tyreek Hill trade

After his close friend and former teammate Tyreek Hill was hurt badly, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes spoke out. This shocking event sent shockwaves through the NFL on Monday night.During their Week 17 game against the New York Jets, Hill, who now plays for the Miami Dolphins, was taken off the field on a cart after what seemed like a serious injury to his lower leg. In the third quarter, Hill caught a ball and then put his foot down in a weird fashion. Replays indicated that his leg was bending in a weird way, which made teammates, fans, and doctors all worry straight away.Mahomes quickly turned to social media to show his support. ""Prayers up man 🙏🙏,"" the Chiefs quarterback posted on X. It was a short but heartfelt statement that instantly went viral.During their tenure with the Kansas City Chiefs, Mahomes and Hill had some of the best seasons of their careers together. They were one of the league's most explosive quarterback-receiver pairs. The two were key players in Kansas City's Super Bowl-winning season in 2019. Hill's quickness and Mahomes' arm changed the way modern NFL offenses work.In 2022, Hill left Kansas City in a big deal, but the two stars have stayed close.

There had already been rumors about Hill's future in Miami, with reports saying he was frustrated with the Dolphins' problems and there were worries about the direction of the roster.It looks like any notion of a reunion with Kansas City is on wait for now. Hill, who will be 31 next year, has a big cap cost for the 2026 season, and a long rehab process might make things much harder for Miami's front management to decide what to do.Before leaving the game, Hill caught six passes for 67 yards, which was one of his better games in a season that has been tough for the Dolphins.It's still not known when Mahomes will be back, but his message to Hill showed how deeply personal events can break through professional rivalries and club loyalties.","Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes posted a heartfelt message to former teammate Tyreek Hill. Hill, who now plays for the Miami Dolphins, was taken off the field on a cart after what seemed like a serious injury to his lower leg.

Lamar Jackson’s injury status ahead of Week 18

How Lamar Jackson's return affects the Ravens vs. Steelers game

Also Read:





The Baltimore Ravens’ heading into Week 18 a major question arises: will Lamar Jackson be available for the final clash against the Pittsburgh Steelers? With the AFC North title on the line, Jackson’s status has become the defining storyline of the final week of the regular season.Jackson missed Baltimore’s Week 17 game against the Green Bay Packers after suffering a painful back injury in Week 16. While the Ravens managed to win without him, the absence of their franchise quarterback raised immediate concerns about his availability for the most important game of the season.According to Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, there is renewed optimism. Rapoport reported that Jackson is expected to practice midweek, a significant step forward after he was unable to participate at all last week. If confirmed, it would mark Jackson’s first on-field work since the injury occurred.Jackson's involvement in practice doesn't mean he'll be available, but it does strongly suggest that he's going in the right direction.John Harbaugh, the head coach of the Ravens, has said that the team will not rush Jackson back until he is completely ready. Internally, the injury has been called ""painful,"" and Baltimore is putting long-term health ahead of short-term goals.If Jackson is cleared, it would make things a lot easier for Baltimore. The two-time MVP has a level of explosiveness and playmaking that no backup can match, especially when playing against a division foe on the road.The Ravens have played it safe on offense since Jackson left. That method works well sometimes, but it might not be enough against a Steelers defense that does well when there is pressure and turnovers. In a close, low-scoring game, Jackson's ability to move around and make plays could be the difference.Jackson's possible comeback makes things harder for the Steelers. Not only would defensive game plans have to change because of his arm, but also because of his legs. This would force Pittsburgh to cover the whole width of the field.At this point, Jackson is officially day-to-day, and we should know more about his Week 18 status before the end of the week. Before coming to any conclusions, Ravens supporters should keep a close eye on injury reports and who is practicing.","Lamar Jackson is expected to practice for the first time since suffering a back injury in Week 16.

How the Detroit Pistons Controlled the Game Early

Mixed Nights for the Stars

Fans Point to Familiar Problems

Where the Los Angeles Lakers Stand Now





The night was supposed to mark another milestone for LeBron James. Instead, it ended with a flat loss that left the building quiet. On December 30, 2025, the Los Angeles Lakers were beaten 128–106 by the Detroit Pistons at Crypto.com Arena, spoiling James’ 41st birthday.The result dropped the Lakers to 20-11 and extended a rough stretch in which they have lost four of their last five games. The concern wasn’t just the loss, but how it happened. The same issues showed up again: poor defense, careless turnovers, and little help beyond the top players.Detroit Pistons took charge from the opening quarter and never let the Los Angeles Lakers settle. The Pistons shot 63 percent from the field and 46 percent from three. They scored 74 points in the paint and added 31 on fast breaks, repeatedly beating Los Angeles down the floor.Turnovers made things worse. The Lakers gave the ball away 20 times, and Detroit turned those mistakes into 30 points. After Los Angeles briefly tied the game at 79-79 late in the third quarter, the Pistons answered with a 16-6 run to start the fourth and pulled away for good. Even after Tobias Harris left early with a hip sprain, Detroit’s bench stayed productive and steady.James struggled to find rhythm. He finished with 17 points on 6-of-17 shooting, along with four rebounds, four assists, five turnovers, and a minus-16 plus-minus in his 1,577th regular-season game.Luka Dončić led the Lakers with 30 points, 11 assists, and five rebounds, but he also committed eight turnovers, which added to the team’s problems.Detroit’s guards set the tone. Cade Cunningham scored 27 points and handed out 11 assists, consistently breaking down the defense. Marcus Sasser added 19 points off the bench. The Pistons improved to 25-8 and continued to look like one of the league’s most reliable teams.Reaction online focused on the same themes seen in recent losses. Fans questioned the Lakers’ defense, the lack of bench production, and the pattern of close wins followed by heavy defeats. Some criticism was aimed at Dončić’s defense, while others focused on the roster as a whole.Head coach JJ Redick also drew attention, with fans asking for clearer direction as injuries to Austin Reaves and Gabe Vincent continue to affect rotations.Redick said turnovers changed the game and pointed to unstable lineups due to injuries. James said Detroit’s speed and physical play made the difference and accepted the result without blaming officials.The Lakers still have elite talent at the top, but repeated blowout losses have raised questions about depth and defense. Detroit, meanwhile, showed again that its young roster can overwhelm teams that fail to keep up.","The Los Angeles Lakers were beaten 128–106 by the Detroit Pistons at Crypto.com Arena on December 30, 2025.

Key moments expose a growing defensive concern

Playoff matchups make the issue harder to ignore

Also Read:





The Green Bay Packers are headed to the playoffs, but the path ahead looks far more complicated after losing their most impactful defender. The season-ending ACL injury to Micah Parsons has not just removed a star from the lineup it has revealed a structural flaw in the Packers’ defense at the worst possible time.Green Bay paid a premium to acquire Parsons and then doubled down with a record-setting contract, banking on his ability to tilt games with relentless pressure. Since his injury, the Packers have stayed competitive on the surface, but a deeper look shows a defense struggling where it matters most in January football. According to advanced metrics highlighted by ESPN , Green Bay has become alarmingly vulnerable on second, third and fourth downs. Without Parsons generating pressure, opposing quarterbacks are finding far too much comfort in obvious passing situations. The Packers now rank near the bottom of the league in defensive efficiency on later downs, allowing explosive plays precisely when stops are required.This isn’t about missed tackles or blown coverages alone. It’s about timing. Parsons’ presence forced offenses to rush decisions, alter protection schemes and abandon longer-developing routes. Without him, Green Bay’s defense lacks a disruptor who can end drives before they start.The concern grows sharper when looking at the playoff landscape. Several NFC contenders thrive on second- and third-down passing, precisely the area where Green Bay has slipped. Teams like the San Francisco 49ers and Philadelphia Eagles excel at extending drives, exploiting matchups, and punishing defenses that can’t consistently generate pressure without blitzing.For a Packers team locked into the No. 7 seed, that means road games, louder stadiums, and less margin for error. Asking a patchwork pass rush to survive against elite quarterbacks in those conditions is a dangerous gamble.Defensive coordinator adjustments can mask issues temporarily mixing coverages, dialing up creative blitzes, and rotating personnel but postseason football has a way of exposing limitations. When offenses know a defense lacks a one-on-one game-wrecker, they can plan patiently and execute confidently.Green Bay’s secondary has held up better than expected, but coverage only lasts so long. Without Parsons collapsing pockets, quarterbacks are buying time, and receivers are eventually winning downfield.As the playoffs approach, the Packers remain dangerous, disciplined, and well-coached. But Micah Parsons’ injury has exposed their biggest defensive weakness: the inability to consistently close passing downs against top-tier offenses. In January, that flaw can be the difference between a hard-fought exit and a deep postseason run.","The Green Bay Packers are headed to the playoffs, but the path ahead looks far more complicated after losing their most impactful defender.

Which NHL players were suspended or fined in 2025, and why?







This NHL season of 2025 has experienced a lot of disciplinary actions, which are not very common, and they include fines for infractions occurring during the games and even off-ice conduct suspensions for a long period of time. The league together with their commitment to putting players’ safety first and maintaining professional standards, has attracted public interest to these rulings not just on the basis of how often they happened, but also due to the different types of players involved—from stars who have already established themselves, to players who work mainly on the team’s depth, and even non-playing staff.Cases were thoroughly examined under the league’s Department of Player Safety and Collective Bargaining Agreement guidelines, according to official NHL rulings and reports from sources such as NHL.com and ESPN. In 2025, the season saw a number of extraordinary suspensions and fines that caused a stir, and the following is a comprehensive account, player by player, of the events that transpired and actions taken in response.To start breaking down the penalties of December 2025, Mathew Barzal, the New York Islanders player, on 29th December, was fined 5,000 dollars for cutting Mason Marchment. At the same time, Scott Sabourin from Tampa Bay Lightning was fined the previous day with an amount of 2,018.23 dollars for hitting Niko Mikkola.On 28th December, Florida Panthers player Anton Lundell paid the same amount of 5,000 dollars for high-sticking Jake Guentzel. In the earlier part of the month, the two were along with Ross Johnston of Anaheim Ducks, who received a sum of 2,864.58 dollars for being involved in the fight (roughing), and Matt Grzelcyk of Chicago Blackhawks, who was fined 2,604.17 dollars for cross-checking, and Frank Vatrano, another player from Anaheim Ducks, who was given 5,000 dollars for unsportsmanlike conduct.For November 2025, it was reported that Ben Chiarot, a player of the Detroit Red Wings, was fined a full amount of 5,000 dollars for butt-ending Simon Nemec, and then followed by a penalty that was issued to Mikko Rantanen of the Dallas Stars, who received 2,000 dollars for diving/embellishment. Brenden Dillon, New Jersey Devils, was fined a sum of 5,000 dollars for the boarding of Tyler Bertuzzi, while at the same time, Evgeni Malkin of the Pittsburgh Penguins was given a penalty of 5,000 dollars for slashing Logan Stanley.In the following month, October 2025, Jackson Blake (Carolina Hurricanes, $2,358.94), Tyler Myers (Vancouver Canucks, $2,500), Ian Cole (Utah Mammoth, $2,500), and Brad Marchand (Florida Panthers, $5,000) all received fines for slashing, trips, and unsportsmanlike conduct, respectively. The Tampa Bay Lightning players Gage Goncalves ($3,125) and Roman Schmidt ($2,098.52) were penalized for cross-checking, and the coach, Jon Cooper, was penalized $25,000 for conduct during a preseason game. The Tampa Bay Lightning team was also fined a total of $100,000 for the same incident.The rulings on off-ice conduct dated September 11, 2025, included Carter Hart (18-game suspension, $395,833.33), Alex Formenton (31 games), Dillon Dube, Cal Foote, and Michael McLeod (no salary impact due to contract status).The 2025 disciplinary record of the NHL shows how differently players are treated according to the situation, the severity of the act, and the financial aspect of the contract. Although every single case is unique, the whole season signifies the league's unwavering commitment to the uniformity of the applied standards in all play levels.Also Read: How much is Brad Marchand’s worth in 2025?

The series will begin on Jan 11 in Vadodara, with the next two matches scheduled to be held in Rajkot on Jan 14 and Indore on Jan 18.“The national selection committee, headed by (former India pacer) Ajit Agarkar, will hold an online meeting on Jan 3 to pick the squad,” a source in the BCCI said.The ODI leg of the series is expected to draw significant attention, particularly as it will feature superstars Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , who will be in action for the first time since the ODI series against South Africa in Dec. India have already picked the squad for the five-match T20I series against the Kiwis, which will start on Jan 21, while New Zealand have also named both their squads.Having recovered from a neck injury, skipper Shubman Gill, who was recently dropped from India’s squad for the 2026 T20 World Cup, is set to lead the team. However, India’s ODI vice-captain Shreyas Iyer ’s return to action has been delayed, as he will undergo rehabilitation at the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence for another week.In a move aimed at workload management, star all-rounder Hardik Pandya and pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah are likely to be rested for the New Zealand series.Both have missed the last two ODI series, and with the T20 World Cup drawing closer, the team management is keen to manage their fitness carefully.It will be interesting to see if the selectors pick Uttar Pradesh’s in-form wicketkeeper-batter Dhruv Jurel, who has scored 307 runs in three matches at an average of 153.5, including 160 not out off 101 balls against Baroda in Rajkot on Dec 29, or Ishan Kishan, if they look to replace Rishabh Pant as the second wicketkeeper.","The Indian team for the upcoming three-match ODI series against New Zealand will be picked on Jan 3.

India have already picked the squad for the five-match T20I series against the Kiwis.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126272684,imgsize-185024,width-400,resizemode-4/yearenders-2025-sports-cricket.jpg"

MLB trade rumors: What’s next for Ketel Marte after Arizona shuts trade door while Reds keep eying Luis Robert Jr.,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/mlb-trade-rumors-whats-next-for-ketel-marte-after-arizona-shuts-trade-door-while-reds-keep-eying-luis-robert-jr-/articleshow/126278632.cms,"MLB trade rumors: What’s next for Ketel Marte after Arizona shuts trade door while Reds keep eying Luis Robert Jr. (Image Via Getty)

Ketel Marte trade talks shut down as Mike Hazen speaks out

“We’re very likely to put an end to this shortly,”

“This isn’t going to linger. We need to focus on our offseason.”





Ketel Marte became the center of MLB trade talk again this week, but that noise is now slowing down fast. On Tuesday, Arizona Diamondbacks general manager Mike Hazen made it clear the team is ready to move on from trade talks involving the star infielder. At the same time, the Cincinnati Reds are still pressing hard in their pursuit of Luis Robert Jr., keeping the MLB trade market busy as the offseason continues.The update came during the Diamondbacks’ offseason media availability in Phoenix, where Hazen spoke openly about the situation. His words surprised many teams that had been checking in on Marte, including the Boston Red Sox, who were closely linked to him in recent weeks.Ketel Marte has been one of the biggest names on the trade market this offseason. The Arizona Diamondbacks second baseman is coming off another strong year and is owed $102.5 million over the next six seasons, making him both valuable and expensive.On Tuesday, Mike Hazen told reporters in Phoenix that the team plans to close the door on trade discussions soon.Hazen said.Hazen added that his belief all along was that a Marte trade was unlikely. That stance has now become clearer as the Diamondbacks shift attention to other roster needs.Marte also controls part of his future. He currently has a five-team no-trade list, which includes the New York Yankees, San Francisco Giants, St. Louis Cardinals, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Athletics. That limited flexibility has played a role in slowing talks.While Marte talks cool off, his value remains high. In the 2024 season, he hit .283 with a .376 on-base percentage, 28 home runs, and 72 RBIs in 126 games.He also earned his second straight All-Star selection, making him one of the top infielders in baseball.The timing matters too. Marte is expected to gain full no-trade protection early next season under MLB’s 10-and-5 rule, if he stays in Arizona.That adds urgency for teams but also strengthens the Diamondbacks’ position. Meanwhile, the Cincinnati Reds continue to show strong interest in Luis Robert Jr., according to league sources.Cincinnati has been aggressive this offseason and is looking to add a proven bat as they push toward contention in the National League Central.With limited infield options available and big names staying put, the MLB trade market is shifting quickly as teams adjust their plans.Also Read: MLB Trade Rumors: Detroit Tigers Eye Alex Bregman Cautiously As Pittsburgh Pirates Predict Strong Push For Kazuma Okamoto","Arizona Diamondbacks general manager Mike Hazen said the team is ready to move on from trade talks involving Ketel Marte.
