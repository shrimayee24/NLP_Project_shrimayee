GUWAHATI: PM Narendra Modi hailed Zubeen Garg as the ""Kohinoor of Assamese culture"" during his Mann Ki Baat radio address Sunday, while grief over the music icon's death continued to sweep Assam.Speaking partly in Assamese, Modi said: ""Zubeen Garg asil oxomor xomoskritir ujjol ratna. Janotar hridayot teyo xodai jiyai thakibo,"" translating it as, ""Zubeen was the Kohinoor of Assamese culture. Though he is physically gone, he will forever remain in our hearts."" He called Garg's music a lasting gift to future generations.Garg, 52, drowned while swimming in Singapore on Sept 19 and his death has plunged fans into mourning amid ongoing birth centenary celebrations of Assam's timeless legend Bhupen Hazarika The PM linked the loss to the centenary of Hazarika, recalling his presence at a Guwahati celebration on Sept 13 where 1,200 artistes performed a medley of the icon's songs.On Sunday's broadcast, he played a Sri Lankan rendition of Hazarika's ""Manuhe manuhor babey"" translated into Sinhala and Tamil, calling it evidence of music's power to bind nations.In Nagpur, Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari invoked Garg's life to stress the supremacy of talent. Addressing a Charmakar Seva Sangh scholarship event where 505 students were felicitated, Gadkari said: ""Crores of people paid their respects during Garg's final journey because he was talented, not because he had other privileges. No one becomes great due to caste, religion or gender. It's your talent and hard work alone which takes you to great heights. ""","PM Narendra Modi hails Zubeen Garg as the ""Kohinoor of Assamese culture"" Garg, 52, drowned while swimming in Singapore on Sept 19.

Rs 355 crore sale marks new high for Indian art market,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-355-crore-sale-marks-new-high-for-indian-art-market/articleshow/124200368.cms,"Vasudeo Gaitonde was a man who pursued perfection. He could spend months on a single canvas, only to destroy it if it failed his exacting standards. In his lifetime, his sublime abstractions-with their play of light and colour -were often overshadowed in a market enamoured of the decorative aesthetic of figurative art. Little could he have imagined that decades later, these same works would command millions in the auction room.On Saturday, a luminous yellow ochre canvas by the reclusive painter, who died in 2001, set a new world record for the artist at Saffronart's 25th anniversary sale in Delhi. The work sold for Rs 67.08 crore ($7.6 million), not only eclipsing his previous benchmark of Rs 42 crore but also making him the second priciest artist in India.The top slot still belongs to his fellow modernist M F Husain whose Gram Yatra sold for over Rs 100 crore earlier this year.The sale itself set a new benchmark. With total proceeds of Rs 355.8 crore ($40.2 million), it became the highest-value auction of South Asian art worldwide-a resounding signal of the Indian market's resilience even as global art sales waver. ""Indians are now seeing generational value in Indian art,"" said Dinesh Vazirani, Saffronart's CEO.""For the wealthy, it's not just about diversification alongside real estate, equity, and gold. There's also social pressure-you can't have a big home and bad art.""Several other artists set new records that night. Tyeb Mehta's Trussed Bull (1956) fetched Rs 56 crore, eight times its upper estimate. Jehangir Sabavala's The Anchorite (1983) sold for Rs 16.8 crore while F N Souza's Six Gentlemen of Our Times (1955) brought in Rs 20 crore, a global auction record for a South Asian work on paper.The evening also saw a breakthrough for contemporary art. Nalini Malani's Nursery Tales sold for Rs 3.6 crore, underscoring how young collectors are increasingly drawn to politically and socially charged work. Malani, whose practice has long been unapologetically feminist and political, transforms the whimsy of nursery rhymes into allegories of violence and resistance.Her presence in international museums is well established; now the auction house too is a stage where her narratives command attention. Her success at Saffronart signals that as prices for the modernists soar, buyers are turning to contemporary voices that better match both their pockets and their sensibilities.","Vasudeo Gaitonde's painting sets a new world record for the artist at Saffronart's 25th anniversary sale in Delhi.

Heated press conferences: How India and Pakistan went at each other in Asia Cup 2025

Team India celebrates the Asia Cup win on the podium without the trophy.

The Asia Cup 2025 final between India and Pakistan ended in ugly drama on Sunday night in Dubai, after Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman and ACC president Mohsin Naqvi allegedly walked away with the winners’ trophy, leaving the presentation ceremony in complete disarray.India, who defeated Pakistan by five wickets to clinch a record-extending ninth Asia Cup title, flatly refused to accept the silverware from Naqvi. The players stood firm at a distance from the stage, reportedly informing the organisers that they would not participate in the presentation if the PCB chief attempted to hand over the trophy.The standoff brought the ceremony to a grinding halt. As Naqvi waited awkwardly on the dais, Indian fans inside the stadium booed loudly, chanting “Bharat Mata Ki Jai”, making the atmosphere even more hostile. It was quite apparent that Naqvi didn’t want to see India getting photographed with the trophy, with organisers eventually whisking it away into the dressing room after prolonged delays.Sources revealed that the Indian team had already informed the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) that Naqvi, also Pakistan’s interior minister, was an unacceptable figure to present the cup. The refusal followed a series of frosty exchanges during the tournament — from no handshakes between players, to the absence of the traditional pre-toss photoshoot.An ACC source further revealed that the Indian team made it clear they didn’t want Naqvi on the podium.In another twist, the Pakistan players remained inside their dressing room for nearly an hour after the match, leaving Naqvi stranded on stage. When skipper Salman Agha and his team eventually emerged, they were greeted by deafening chants of “Indiaaaa, Indiaaaa” from the crowd.On the field, however, India’s win was emphatic. Tilak Varma anchored the chase with an unbeaten 69 off 53 balls, adding a crucial 60-run stand with Shivam Dube (33). Earlier, Kuldeep Yadav’s 4-30 dismantled Pakistan’s middle order, restricting them to 146 after a promising start from Sahibzada Farhan (57) and Fakhar Zaman (46).While India celebrated yet another continental crown, the night will be remembered as much for the cricket as for the chaotic and unprecedented trophy fiasco that followed.","India defeated Pakistan by five wickets to clinch a record-extending ninth Asia Cup title.

Heated press conferences: How India and Pakistan went at each other in Asia Cup 2025

Live Score:

NEW DELHI: Another storm brewed at the Asia Cup 2025 final between India and Pakistan on Sunday at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, as Pakistan pacers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf found themselves at the centre of a fresh controversy.Moments before the blockbuster clash got underway, both teams lined up for the national anthem s. Pakistan’s anthem played first, followed by India’s. While players from both sides stood in attention as per protocol, cameras captured Shaheen and Haris casually chatting during India’s national anthem — a gesture that quickly went viral and was widely slammed as “disrespectful.”The incident has only fuelled tensions in what was already a high-voltage summit clash. It came on the heels of another flashpoint: India skipper Suryakumar Yadav sticking to the “No Handshake” policy against Pakistan.At the toss, Suryakumar shook hands with broadcaster Ravi Shastri but pointedly ignored former Pakistan captain Waqar Younis. Just like in the group stage and Super Four encounters earlier in the tournament, he also skipped the customary handshake with Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha.Adding further intrigue, the toss itself was conducted in an unusual manner, with Shastri interviewing the Indian captain and Waqar handling Pakistan’s leader — a rare arrangement in world cricket.To make things worse, the Pakistan skipper also claimed that Suryakumar had shaken hands with him not once, but twice in private before the handshake snubs started on-camera.For India, the evening also began with a massive setback as skipper Suryakumar confirmed at the toss that star all-rounder Hardik Pandya was ruled out due to a niggle. The absence of Pandya, who has a proven record in big matches against Pakistan, leaves a significant void in India’s line-up.With controversies over handshakes, anthem etiquette, and team selection overshadowing the pre-match proceedings, the stage was set for an emotionally charged finale.In the end, it was India that came out on top after a tense affair in Dubai. After Pakistan were skittled out for a 146-run total, India too, had to overcome early challenges. After being reduced to 20/3 inside the powerplay, the Suryakumar-led side rode on the back of a sensational batting display from Tilak Varma (69* from 53 balls) and a solid partnership with Shivam Dube (33 from 22 balls) to clinch the trophy. In the end, it was Rinku Singh, who faced his first-ever ball of this tournament, who scored the winning runs with a four in the fourth delivery of the final over.",Pakistan pacers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf found themselves at the centre of a fresh controversy during the national anthem.

LeBron James met Savannah James when they were very young

LeBron James and his wife, Savannah James, have created a beautiful family and has kept their personal lives pretty private, despite the fame that the NBA legend has achieved in his life. LeBron James has often credited his wife, Savannah James, for taking care of the household while he was building his career in the NBA. But it seems, LeBron James’ wife, Savannah James, had lost herself in this process.A few months ago, LeBron James’ wife, Savannah James opened up about losing herself in the process of being a wife and a mother on her popular podcast, Everbody’s Crazy.Savannah James said, “It wasn’t just my kids, it was my husband, I felt like I didn’t have an identity outside of that.. I started my family really young and put on my time and energy there.”The popular mother of three added, “I was too wrapped up in just being their mom…My cup for myself was half empty… So I had to really go on a journey on finding out who Savannah was outside of Bronny and Bryce..”LeBron James’ wife, Savannah James also opened up about how she managed to build a life outside of her family. She said, “I hate to say it like it this, but just be selfish with my time…I was living in Ohio, so what I would do is I would go out of town for a weekend by myself.I was like, ‘Those kids they will be alright and I’ll see y’all when I get back.’”While Savannah James initially struggled to find her identity outside being a wife and a mother, she has a thriving podcast now and has been a huge source of support and strength to her family.LeBron James and Savannah James met when they were pretty young and quickly fell in love with each other.

A chance for Jaxson Dart to make history against the Chargers’ defense

Jaxson Dart’s NFL journey is off to a dramatic start. Just days before making his debut for the New York Giants, the 22-year-old quarterback found himself caught in the middle of a viral controversy involving a fake Instagram post linking him to pop star Madison Beer, who is rumored to be dating Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert Jaxson Dart hasn’t even taken his first official snap for the New York Giants, but the rookie quarterback is already at the center of controversy. Ahead of his debut against the undefeated Los Angeles Chargers, Dart’s name was linked to a digitally altered Instagram post that appeared to show him connected to Madison Beer — pop star and rumored partner of Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert.The image spread rapidly online, racking up nearly four million views before being debunked. While completely fabricated, the viral post fueled unnecessary drama around Dart’s first professional start, turning what should have been a straightforward quarterback storyline into an off-field distraction.Head coach Brian Daboll made the bold decision to bench Russell Wilson after an 0-3 start, handing the keys of the offense to 22-year-old Dart. The move marks a fresh chapter for the Giants, who have been searching for stability at quarterback since Eli Manning’s retirement.Justin Herbert, meanwhile, has guided the Chargers to a 3-0 start. His undefeated record combined with his rumored relationship with Beer has only heightened the intrigue surrounding this Week 4 showdown. Reports of Herbert attending Beer’s concert and later appearing alongside her in Brazil earlier this month gave the romance speculation more traction, adding to the media spotlight on his personal life.For Jaxson Dart, Sunday’s debut carries more than just personal significance. If the Giants manage to upset the 3-0 Chargers, he would become the first quarterback in 23 years to defeat an undefeated team in his very first NFL start.

Heated press conferences: How India and Pakistan went at each other in Asia Cup 2025

Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded India’s thrilling Asia Cup 2025 triumph over Pakistan with a striking message on X, writing: “#OperationSindoor on the games field. Outcome is the same – India wins! Congrats to our cricketers.”The post quickly went viral, framing the victory as not just a cricketing milestone but also a symbolic triumph in a tense rivalry.This Asia Cup marked the first cricketing encounter between India and Pakistan since the Pahalgam attack and the subsequent Operation Sindoor.The arch-rivals clashed three times in the tournament, and on each occasion, India emerged victorious.On this occasion, Union Home Minister Amit Shah wrote, ""A phenomenal victory. The fierce energy of our boys blew up the rivals again.""External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar wrote, ""Congrats to Team India on winning the Asia Cup. New India delivers.""Reacting to the victory, ICC chairman Jay Shah also congratulated India, penning, ""Congratulations to Team India on lifting the Asia Cup 2025! A proud moment for Indian cricket as Team India showcases excellence, consistency, and character on the biggest stage.Kudos to the players and support staff for a stellar campaign.""On Sunday, Tilak Varma’s unbeaten 69 was the cornerstone of India’s five-wicket win in Dubai, securing a record-extending ninth Asia Cup crown.Chasing 147, India endured early jolts at 20/3 and later 77/4, but the 21-year-old left-hander displayed poise well beyond his years.With three fours and four sixes, he anchored the innings, forging a crucial 60-run partnership with Shivam Dube (33).The final over held its share of drama.India needed 10 runs from six balls after Dube’s dismissal, but Varma swung momentum back with a towering six before Rinku Singh finished the job with a boundary, sparking joyous celebrations in a stadium dominated by Indian supporters.Earlier, Kuldeep Yadav’s spin heroics (4/30) turned the contest in India’s favour.Pakistan had raced to 84 without loss, thanks to Sahibzada Farhan’s 57 and Fakhar Zaman’s 46.Yet their promising platform crumbled as they lost nine wickets for just 33 runs, eventually bowled out for 146 in 19.1 overs. Kuldeep’s 17th-over burst, three wickets in four balls, including skipper Salman Agha, was the decisive strike.The rivalry’s political undertones loomed large. There were no handshakes at the toss or after the match, echoing tensions between the neighbours. Jasprit Bumrah even mirrored Haris Rauf’s earlier gesture to the crowd after bowling him out, adding another fiery subplot to the clash.India’s third win over Pakistan in this tournament not only reaffirmed their dominance but also served as a dress rehearsal ahead of next year’s T20 World Cup.For fans, though, the moment was captured in Modi’s words and Varma’s calm finish — #OperationSindoor had played out on the cricket field, and India had triumphed again.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded India's thrilling Asia Cup 2025 triumph over Pakistan with a striking message on X.

The Asia Cup final between India and Pakistan was so dramatic that it could easily inspire a web series, especially after Rinku Singh hit the winning runs at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday.Indian players celebrated the win in jubilation, with man of the moment Tilak Verma playing an exceptional unbeaten 69-run knock. While the Indian players were busy celebrating, the Salman Ali Agha-led Pakistan team went straight into their dressing room and locked themselves in.There was absolute chaos as the Pakistan team delayed the post-match presentation, stepping out only after an hour while Indian cricketers and coaching staff were speaking to broadcasters.TimesofIndia.com has learnt that the Indian team did not want to receive the trophy from Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman and Asian Cricket Council (ACC) president Mohsin Naqvi, who also happens to be Pakistan's interior minister.Upon learning about India’s stance, ACC officials held discussions to address the situation. The Indian team had requested to receive the trophy from Emirates Board vice-chairman Khalid Al Zarooni, but the request was denied.Mohsin Naqvi insisted on presenting the medals and instructed that the Asia Cup trophy be taken away.India had already shown its position by avoiding handshakes with Pakistani players during all three Asia Cup encounters and skipping the customary pre-toss photoshoot.When Naqvi approached the presentation stage, Indian supporters in the stadium responded with boos and chants of “Bharat Mata Ki Jai.” Pakistani players, especially fast bowlers Haris Rauf and Shaheen Shah Afridi, were also booed by the Indian fans.Simon Doull announced that the Pakistan team would receive the runners-up medals from Naqvi, who refused. Instead, Bangladesh Cricket Board president Aminul Islam handed over the medals and asked Naqvi to give the runners-up cheque to Salman Ali Agha, which the Pakistan captain threw aside.Simon Doull later stated, “I have been informed by the ACC that the Indian cricket team will not be collecting their awards tonight. So that concludes the post-match presentation.” After this, all ACC officials, including Mohsin Naqvi, left the stadium.The Indian team patiently waited for the trophy as the champions placard was brought twice by groundsmen and then taken back. Hardik Pandya was the first to step onto the podium, taking a selfie, followed by the rest of the team and coaching staff. Captain Suryakumar Yadav mimicked Rohit Sharma's iconic T20 World Cup 2024 walk, celebrating India’s victory with an imaginary trophy.In the post-match press conference, Suryakumar slammed the ACC for withholding the trophy: “I have never seen a champion team being denied a trophy, that too a hard-earned one.” Abhishek Sharma echoed him, taking a cheeky jab: “We actually got one — Surya bhai brought it! We felt it, we knew its weight.”Meanwhile, Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha criticised the Indian team: “If he (Mohsin Naqvi) is the ACC president, then he will only give the trophy. If you don’t want to take it from him, how will you get a trophy?”India Cricket Board secretary Devajit Saikia condemned the PCB’s actions: “We decided not to accept the Asia Cup 2025 trophy from the ACC chairman, who represents a country currently at odds with ours. That was our stance. But this does not give him the right to take the trophy and medals. It is extremely unfortunate and unsportsmanlike. We hope the trophy and medals are returned to India as soon as possible.

Kevin Stefanski rejects quarterback change talk, urging teamwide responsibility immediately

Game-by-game performance shows Joe Flacco struggling to find rhythm consistently

Career statistics highlight Joe Flacco experience despite current offensive struggles

Browns offensive issues go beyond quarterback play, require whole team fixes

The Cleveland Browns suffered a 34-10 defeat to the Detroit Lions, a game that exposed struggles across the offense and highlighted Joe Flacco’s inconsistent performance. Flacco threw three interceptions, including a pick-six, underlining both his own difficulties and the team’s broader execution problems. Despite the lopsided score, head coach Kevin Stefanski is keeping Flacco in place, emphasizing that accountability must come from the entire roster rather than a single player.Flacco’s rough outing naturally sparked chatter about a potential QB change, but Stefanski remained steadfast: “I understand the question. But it’s not our focus. It’s never going to be about one person. We’re not doing a good enough job. I put myself in there as well. We have to be better.” His words reinforce a collective approach, signaling that fixes will target the whole offense, not just the quarterback.This season, Flacco has battled for consistency. In the Browns vs Lions matchup on Sept. 28, he completed 47.1% of passes for 184 yards, threw two interceptions, and posted a 39.3 passer rating. Two weeks earlier against the Packers, he went 58.3% for 142 yards, with one interception (55.6 rating).Against the Ravens on Sept. 14, he completed 55.6% for 199 yards, throwing one touchdown and one interception, while the season opener against the Bengals saw a 68.9% completion for 290 yards, one TD, two picks, and a 75.2 rating.Despite recent difficulties, Flacco’s career totals are notable: 46,512 passing yards with 259 touchdowns and a 61.6% completion rate. His tenure across the Ravens, Broncos, Jets, and Browns has seen passer ratings often above 80, reflecting his ability to perform at a high level even when individual games don’t go perfectly.The Lions exposed systemic issues, pressuring Flacco consistently and forcing hurried throws. Protection breakdowns and timing errors magnified turnovers, showing that the team’s challenges are systemic. Stefanski’s insistence on shared accountability underscores that improvement must come across the entire offense, not just through one player’s performance.The Browns now face the task of converting reflection into results. With Flacco’s experience, the team has tools to stabilize, but success hinges on clean execution, sharper protection, and better decision-making. Stefanski’s backing signals continuity at quarterback, but the offense must deliver quickly to remain competitive and rebound from the 34-10 loss.Also read: Rookie Jalen Cropper steps into the spotlight to lead Cowboys’ offense during CeeDee Lamb’s absence","The Cleveland Browns suffered a 34-10 defeat to the Detroit Lions.

LeBron James enters 23rd NBA season after Los Angeles Lakers decline extension, forcing him to exercise his player option

LeBron James weighs retirement as L.A. Lakers grant him full control over his farewell journey

The 2025–2026 season will soon begin. Amidst all the excitement, the fresh rumors suggest that LeBron James might be retiring soon. The Los Angeles Lakers allegedly declined to re-sign the star this past summer. James attempted to sign an extension, but his team did not back his initiative during the offseason, according to Bleacher Report's Yaron Weitzman.The Lakers reportedly rejected LeBron James' request for an extension this summer, thus he was forced to exercise his player option. Yaron Weitzman said in the same article that James was reportedly certain that he wanted to extend his contract with the Los Angeles Lakers.Earlier this year, though, things did not turn out as planned. He was allegedly forced to exercise his $52.6 million player option as a result. One NBA source familiar with the situation said:“He obviously wanted an extension, and it's also clear that the Lakers wouldn't give it to him.”The news was further announced on X by Lake Show Yo and read:“LeBron James reportedly wanted an extension from the Lakers, but they weren't interested this summer, forcing him to pick up his player option, per @YaronWeitzman.”The Lakers appear to have made the decision to let James make his own decisions going forward. During a recent press conference, Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka , stated,""The first thing we want to do in terms of LeBron and his future is just give him absolute respect to choose his story with his family in terms of how many years he's going to continue to play.He's earned that right, and he's the best one to talk about that.""Towards the end, Pelinka added,""We would love if LeBron's story would be to retire as a Laker. That would be a positive story.""Having exercised his 2025-2026 player option, the final season of a two-year, $104 million deal with a no-trade clause, the winger will start his 23rd season in the league. The 21-time All-Star guided the Los Angeles Lakers to the third seed in the Western Conference during last season. This news, though, implies that the Lakers might reportedly lose the NBA legend.Meanwhile, Lakers officials have recently referred to LeBron's retirement plans and his future within the organization in a press conference. The comments suggested that LeBron is contemplating the next chapter in his life beyond basketball. Fans and commentators have been talking about this news a lot, with many voicing support and worry for LeBron's possible choice.Although he hasn't made a decision on his retirement date, the Lakers organization has granted him complete autonomy over his last decisions and whether or not he wishes to end his career as a Lakers player. James apparently intends to follow in Kobe Bryant 's footsteps and retire rather than follow in Michael Jordan's footsteps and move out of the team slowly.Bleacher Report's NBA writer Yaron Weitzman interviewed several league executives who are also close to James. They discussed with James the importance of storylines, his desire to avoid a quiet retirement like Michael Jordan, and his expectation of a farewell tour like Kobe Bryant .

India captain Suryakumar Yadav made a heartfelt gesture after leading his side to the Asia Cup 2025 title, announcing that he would donate his entire match fees from the tournament to the Indian armed forces The skipper also did not mince words in expressing his disappointment with the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) for denying the champions their trophy despite a hard-fought campaign.“I think this is one thing I have never seen. Since I started playing and following cricket, a champion team being denied a trophy. That too a hard-earned one,” Suryakumar said after India’s five-wicket win over Pakistan in the final at the Dubai International Stadium.India remained unbeaten throughout the tournament, defeating Pakistan thrice, including in the final. But the absence of the trophy presentation left a sour note amid the celebrations.“For me, the real trophies are sitting in the dressing room — my 14 teammates and the support staff. They are the reason we won this title. Still, a team winning a hard-fought tournament and not getting a trophy is something I have never seen,” he added.On the off-field developments, the Indian captain said it did not affect his captaincy.""I feel it was not that difficult. The boys took it in their stride. They were really happy with the way the campaign was going.""Since day one I have been telling them only one thing: Let's just focus on cricket on the ground. And when we go to the practice sessions, let's enjoy what we are doing. Do the same things that we want to do in the game.""I think the boys took it in a positive way. I feel unbeaten in the tournament, the boys stepped up whenever needed. I think those are the small moments, small trophies, which we won going forward into the World Cup year.""And as I said earlier also, I have never seen this — a team winning a hard-earned tournament and not getting a trophy. We can't say we were disappointed. But if you see, we had a lot of smiles on our faces as we were on the ground enjoying the moment on the podium,"" he said.The India skipper also opened up about his own batting form, brushing aside talk of being “out of form.”“I don’t think I am out of form; I am out of runs. I believe in my preparations. In matches, things go on autopilot. God is watching, and if you keep doing well, everything comes on time,” he said.Capping off his press conference with a surprise announcement, Suryakumar revealed: “As a gesture, I want to donate my match fees from all the games in this tournament to the Indian Army . I don’t know if people will call it controversial, but for me, it’s the right thing to do.”","India captain Suryakumar Yadav reveals he will donate his match fees from the Asia Cup 2025 to the Indian armed forces.

Heated press conferences: How India and Pakistan went at each other in Asia Cup 2025

As it happened:

Poll Do you believe Pakistan's batting collapse cost them the Asia Cup final? Yes, definitely No, India performed better It's hard to say Other reasons affected the match

Amidst all the drama off the pitch, cricket finally had the last laugh on the last day of the Asia Cup as the final between India and Pakistan went down to the wire.There is a saying that an India versus Pakistan match is not for the faint-hearted, and Sunday's contest proved that belief.Riding on the crafty bowling of Kuldeep Yadav (4/30) and a gritty unbeaten knock by Tilak Varma (69 off 53), India beat Pakistan by five wickets to win the 2025 Asia Cup at the Dubai International Stadium.India started as favourites, while Pakistan were cornered as underdogs. But Pakistan put on a spirited performance and, at multiple stages, had the match in their grasp.Sahibzada Farhan’s blistering 38-ball 57 gave them a flying start, but they collapsed like a pack of cards, losing nine wickets for just 33 runs. Pakistan also had an ideal start with the ball, removing the in-form Abhishek Sharma , Shubman Gill, and the out-of-form Suryakumar Yadav inside the powerplay, leaving India reeling at 20/3.It was a two-paced surface, and as Pakistan head back to Lahore on Monday, they will rue their batting collapse, which kept India in the game.The reigning T20 world champions held their nerves and registered another gritty win in this tournament.Chasing a tricky target, India overcame a shaky start to finish the powerplay at 36/3 before Tilak Varma’s composure, Sanju Samson’s important cameo, and Shivam Dube silencing his critics first with the ball and then with the bat steered India home.Pakistan were all over India at the start. The tone was set when Abhishek Sharma, who had been in red-hot form all tournament, fell cheaply for the first time. After punching a four through cover-point with a defensive stroke that raced away, he perished in single digits to Faheem Ashraf’s clever slower ball. Faheem celebrated animatedly as Haris Rauf clung onto a sharp catch at mid-on. Shubman Gill soon departed as well, miscuing another to the same fielder.Tilak Varma then walked in under pressure and made a statement. In the final over of the powerplay, he launched Faheem for a six and four in quick succession, breaking the shackles with fearless strokeplay. But India suffered another setback when Sanju Samson, dropped once by Hussain Talat, couldn’t capitalise and fell for 24, edging to backward point against Abrar Ahmed.From that point, India’s innings hinged on Tilak’s measured aggression. He mixed caution with calculated risks, slog-sweeping Abrar for six and piercing the gaps with crisp back-foot punches. His 41-ball fifty was a testament to his growing maturity on the big stage.Alongside him, Shivam Dube — who had struggled for timing throughout the tournament — finally found his range. A boundary through extra cover off Rauf gave him confidence, and soon he was clearing the ropes with his long levers, hammering Abrar for a six and punishing Rauf’s misfired yorker with a towering hit over cow corner.Pakistan’s tactics came under scrutiny as Salman Ali Agha turned to pace after spinners had kept things tight. Once Haris Rauf came on, India plundered runs aplenty. His pace-on approach backfired on a slow surface, with Tilak and Dube feasting on predictable lengths. The over that went for 13 against Dube summed up Pakistan’s missed trick—pace on this wicket was easier to hit, while spin posed the real challenge.By the time Tilak and Dube were done, India had transformed a precarious position into a platform. Their partnership not only rebuilt the innings but also shifted the momentum decisively, leaving Pakistan ruing another tactical lapse in a high-stakes match.Dube scored a fine 22-ball 33 before falling while trying to hit a six off the last ball of the 19th over against Pakistan’s best bowler of the night, Faheem Ashraf, who returned impressive figures of 3/29.It was fitting that Rinku Singh, who came in for the injured Hardik Pandya, hit the winning runs.Earlier, after being put into bat, Pakistan endured one of their most dramatic implosions in recent memory, crashing from 113/1 in 12.4 overs to 146 all out. Farhan’s fluent fifty had set them up for a formidable score, but India’s spinners — and Bumrah at the death — engineered a ruthless turnaround.Varun Chakravarthy removed Farhan for 57, sparking a chain reaction. Kuldeep, who was expensive early on, returned brilliantly to dismiss Saim Ayub and later tore through the middle order, finishing with 4/30. Axar Patel chipped in with key strikes, including Mohammad Haris and Hussain Talat, while Fakhar Zaman’s dismissal left Pakistan reeling. From a position of control, Pakistan slumped to 126/4 and then 134/8, undone by reckless strokes and India’s relentless spin choke.Bumrah applied the finishing touches, nailing his yorkers to remove Haris Rauf and Mohammad Nawaz. Pakistan’s innings ended in 19.1 overs, their final nine wickets tumbling for 33 runs.What had promised to be a challenging total turned into a modest one, the result of poor shot selection and India’s disciplined bowling. That, in effect, helped India seal the title in the end, their ninth continental triumph.","India beat Pakistan by five wickets to win the 2025 Asia Cup.

Poll Do you think the trophy controversy overshadowed India's victory? Yes, it detracted from the win. No, the win is what matters most.

India’s Asia Cup triumph over Pakistan on Sunday night in Dubai was overshadowed by unprecedented drama after the final whistle. The presentation ceremony turned chaotic when Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman and Asian Cricket Council (ACC) president Mohsin Naqvi allegedly walked away with the winners’ trophy, leaving the stage empty and fans stunned.India, who had just beaten Pakistan by five wickets, refused to accept the silverware from Naqvi. Players reportedly informed organisers beforehand that they would not step on stage if the PCB chief attempted to hand over the trophy.Speaking after the incident, BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia congratulated the team but made his protest clear over the post-match controversy. “My first reaction is that BCCI is extremely happy and we congratulate Indian cricket team for defeating Pakistan, hands down, at the group stage, at the Super 4, as well as in the final. All three matches were one sided and we congratulate our players as well as the support staff for bringing a lot of glory to our country. We are very proud of our team and they have excellently delivered on the cricket pitch,” Saikia said.He used the opportunity to link the victory to a larger sense of national pride, saying, “Our armed forces have delivered in the border area. Now the same thing has been repeated in Dubai.So this is an excellent moment, a momentous occasion for Indian cricket.”On the cash reward, Saikia confirmed what awaits the players following the win in the final. “We are very happy and they have done an extremely good job on the ground, defeating Pakistan 3-0. And there was absolutely no resistance. All the matches were one sided. So we have decided that there will be a cash reward to the Indian team, which will be 21 crores. It will be distributed among the players and all the support staff. ”But his strongest words were reserved for the trophy controversy. “In fact, we have decided not to take the trophy from the ACC chairman, who happens to be one of the leaders of Pakistan. But that does not mean that the gentleman will take away the trophy with him along with the medals. So it is very unfortunate, very unsporting and we hope that the trophy and the medals will be returned to India as soon as possible.”Saikia confirmed that a formal complaint will follow. “This is definitely we are going to do. There is an ICC conference in the first week of November in Dubai. In the next conference, we are going to launch a very serious and very strong protest against the act of ACC chairperson,” he stated.Even as off-field controversy stole the spotlight, the final itself had moments of brilliance. Kuldeep Yadav’s 4/30 broke Pakistan’s middle order after Sahibzada Farhan (57) and Fakhar Zaman (46) gave them a promising start. Bowled out for 146, Pakistan left India with a modest chase, which Tilak Varma (69 not out) and Shivam Dube (33) finished with a composed 60-run stand.Saikia stressed that the victory was in line with India’s sporting policy, adding, “Actually, BCCI from the very first day, we have followed the spirit and the policy formulated by the Government of India regarding all games, cricketers were no exception. When it is a bilateral tournament, India is not going to play against Pakistan or any other hostile country. And BCCI has been doing it for the last 12 to 15 years… But today, with this handsome win over Pakistan and the thumping victory of 3-0, I am sure we will bring a lot of happiness to our people. The country is really proud of the performance of Indian cricket team.”He summed up with a simple note, exclaiming, “Yes, absolutely. I follow your statement that everything is well that ends well.”",India beat Pakistan by five wickets in the Asia Cup final in Dubai.

Heated press conferences: How India and Pakistan went at each other in Asia Cup 2025

NEW DELHI: Dubai roared in blue on Sunday night as India clinched their record-extending ninth Asia Cup title with a five-wicket victory over arch-rivals Pakistan — and the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) wasted no time in rewarding the champions. Soon after the win, the board announced a massive Rs 21 crore prize money for the players and support staff, celebrating yet another milestone in Indian cricket’s glittering history.""3 blows. 0 response. Asia Cup Champions. Message delivered. 21 crores prize money for the team and support staff,"" the BCCI posted on X, underlining both the dominance and the significance of the triumph.On the field, it was Tilak Varma who starred with an unbeaten 69 off 53 balls. Calm under pressure, the 22-year-old anchored India’s chase of 147 with a match-winning 60-run stand alongside Shivam Dube. Despite India slipping to 20/3 and later 77/4, Varma held his nerve, striking three fours and four sixes before finishing the game in style with Rinku Singh , who hit the winning boundary.Earlier, Kuldeep Yadav ’s spell of 4-30 triggered Pakistan’s collapse from a commanding 113/1 to 146 all out in 19.1 overs. Sahibzada Farhan’s 57 and Fakhar Zaman’s 46 gave Pakistan early momentum, but the Indian wrist-spinner ripped through the middle order, including three wickets in a sensational 17th over.The atmosphere was as charged off the field as on it. From Jasprit Bumrah mimicking Haris Rauf’s earlier gesture after bowling him out, to yet another match without handshakes between the two teams, the clash reflected the political and sporting tensions surrounding the rivalry.For India, however, the night was about celebration.

Heated press conferences: How India and Pakistan went at each other in Asia Cup 2025

Poll Was Abrar Ahmed's celebration after taking Sanju Samson's wicket appropriate? Yes, it shows confidence! No, it was disrespectful.

The Asia Cup 2025 final between India and Pakistan will be remembered for more than just cricket. While India lifted their ninth Asia Cup title with a thrilling five-wicket win on Sunday night, celebrations on the field carried an added edge, particularly aimed at Pakistan spinner Abrar Ahmed Abrar, known for his trademark celebration of gesturing with his head towards the dugout after taking wickets, had repeated the act when he dismissed Sanju Samson for 24 in the 13th over. At that stage, India’s chase was in a tight spot, and the gesture drew plenty of attention.However, the move came back to haunt the Pakistan bowler. After India sealed victory, a clip was shared on social media showing Arshdeep Singh , Jitesh Sharma and Harshit Rana mimicking Abrar’s celebration. The trio directed their gestures towards Samson, drawing laughter from fans on social media.Arshdeep himself shared the moment on Instagram with the caption “No context,” which quickly went viral. Fans lauded the players for returning the favour in style, with many calling it a “bold” response after weeks of intense clashes and exchanges between the two teams.On the field, India’s win was hard-earned. Chasing 147, the innings wobbled at 20/3 inside the powerplay after Abhishek Sharma (5), Shubman Gill (12) and skipper Suryakumar Yadav (1) fell cheaply.Tilak Varma held his nerve with an unbeaten 69 off 53 balls, including a six off Haris Rauf in the final over, while Shivam Dube’s 33 off 22 balls provided vital support. Their 60-run stand turned the contest in India’s favour. Rinku Singh hit the winning runs with a boundary, sealing the game with two balls to spare.Earlier, Pakistan squandered a strong start of 113/1 to fold for 146 in 19.1 overs. Sahibzada Farhan (57) and Fakhar Zaman (46) set the platform, but Kuldeep Yadav’s 4/30 triggered a collapse as the last nine wickets fell for just 33 runs.The final also ended in controversy, with India refusing to accept the trophy from ACC president and PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi. While the presentation was abandoned, the Indian players still found time to celebrate, but with a twist. They uploaded one picture after the other without the trophy, but kept the mood in the Team India camp one of celebration and laughter. The perfect use of Abrar’s antics against himself made sure that the gesture did not go unanswered.","India beat Pakistan by five wickets in the Asia Cup 2025 final.

India’s thrilling five-wicket victory over Pakistan in the Asia Cup 2025 final should have been a night of celebration for the champions. Instead, the post-match proceedings descended into chaos as Asian Cricket Council (ACC) president and Pakistan minister Mohsin Naqvi refused to follow protocol, denying India the opportunity to receive their trophy and winners’ medals.The controversy began when India, citing Naqvi’s position as a representative of Pakistan, refused to accept the trophy from him. Officials from the ACC attempted to mediate, suggesting Emirates Cricket Board vice-chairman Khalid Al Zarooni present the awards instead, but Naqvi blocked the move. After a protracted standoff lasting nearly an hour, the trophy was quietly taken away by organisers while individual performers, including India’s Tilak Varma and Abhishek Sharma, were feted.Also read: The one-hour drama in Dubai: Inside details of how PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi ran away with Asia Cup trophy after India vs Pakistan final Fans in the stands expressed their displeasure, chanting “Bharat Mata Ki Jai” and booing Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha as he approached the stage. The Pakistani team, meanwhile, remained in their dressing room long after the match ended, leaving Naqvi stranded and visibly embarrassed.Adding fuel to the fire, Naqvi took to X (formerly Twitter), responding to Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s congratulatory message on India’s victory with a shocking statement: “If war was your measure of pride, history already records your humiliating defeats at Pakistan’s hands.No cricket match can rewrite that truth. Dragging war into sport only exposes desperation and disgraces the very spirit of the game.”Cricket analysts and fans condemned Naqvi for politicising sport and disrespecting the champions. The incident came after India’s team had already signalled their disapproval by avoiding handshakes with Pakistani players throughout the tournament and skipping the customary pre-toss photoshoot. Naqvi’s attempts to escalate tensions continued off the field, including demanding that Suryakumar Yadav be charged by the ICC for standing in solidarity with the Indian Army after the Pahalgam terror attack .","India beat Pakistan by five wickets in the Asia Cup 2025 final in Dubai.

Taylor Swift’s history with Ralph Lauren and the Kelce connection

Selena Gomez’s star-studded wedding to music producer Benny Blanco may have been her moment to shine, but it has quickly ignited another conversation: what Taylor Swift might wear when she eventually walks down the aisle with Travis Kelce . Gomez’s fashion choice—a halter-neck Ralph Lauren gown—has fans drawing parallels to Swift’s own style journey and relationship milestones.Selena Gomez tied the knot in Santa Barbara in a glamorous ceremony that felt more like a state event, complete with high security, private shuttles, and tightly controlled photo access. When the bride finally revealed her gown, fans immediately noticed the symbolism. Ralph Lauren wasn’t just a designer—it was a statement. The same American fashion house designed the silk-blend dress Taylor Swift wore to announce her engagement to NFL star Travis Kelce.This detail has sparked a frenzy of speculation. Could Swift follow her best friend’s lead and trust Ralph Lauren for her own wedding day? For fans, it’s not a far-fetched theory, especially given how often the two women align on style. From New York streetwear moments to coordinated trench coats and tights, Swift and Gomez have often leaned into a twin aesthetic.Swift’s connection to Ralph Lauren runs deeper than one dress.Over the years, she’s turned to the brand for red-carpet halters and polished looks that balance classic elegance with modern edge. Now, with her engagement to Travis Kelce making headlines across the sports and entertainment world, her wedding wardrobe has become one of the most anticipated fashion reveals of the decade.Adding to the intrigue, Gomez has been vocal about her admiration for Swift’s style. As she told Vogue in 2021, “When I was younger, Taylor inspired me a lot when it comes to wardrobe and stage outfits.” With their fashion paths so often intertwined, Gomez’s aisle moment feels less like coincidence and more like foreshadowing.Also Read: Taylor Swift makes a quick exit from Selena Gomez’s wedding to return to Travis Kelce before Chiefs vs. Ravens showdown While nothing is confirmed, fans are treating Gomez’s wedding dress as a stylish clue.

Charlie Kirk once mocked Taylor Swift’s political impact

Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce , and the politics of influence

The assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk has brought renewed attention to some of his most controversial remarks, including pointed criticism of Taylor Swift and her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce . Kirk, who was known for his sharp right-wing commentary, once accused Swift of wielding political influence that could sway elections.During a past segment on his radio show, Charlie Kirk dismissed Swift’s cultural power with biting remarks. “Taylor Swift is going to come out in the presidential election and she is going to mobilize her fans. I’ll be nice. And we’re going to be like, oh wow, where did all these young, female voters come from? We better have a plan for that,” he said.He doubled down with an even harsher comparison: “Newsflash, she ain’t Mother Mary.” Kirk also suggested that Swift’s fan base was primarily focused on progressive causes, claiming, “All the Swifties want is swift abortion.” His framing not only took aim at Swift’s politics but also at the power of her devoted fanbase, who have historically mobilized around issues such as voter registration.Taylor Swift has long been outspoken about her support for Democratic candidates and LGBTQ+ rights. She famously endorsed Joe Biden in 2020 and has continued to use her platform to speak on issues such as reproductive rights and voting access.California Governor Gavin Newsom once described her political impact as “profoundly powerful.”At the time of Kirk’s criticism, Swift was also making headlines for her relationship with Travis Kelce, one of the NFL ’s biggest stars.

Maple Leafs’ James Reimer teases Auston Matthews with hilarious ‘winner takes all’ jersey number challenge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/maple-leafs-james-reimer-teases-auston-matthews-with-hilarious-winner-takes-all-jersey-number-challenge/articleshow/124202697.cms,"James Reimer jokingly challenges Leafs star Auston Matthews in playful jersey number battle fans didn’t see coming (Imagn Images)

James Reimer’s Maple Leafs return on PTO



James Reimer’s jersey number joke with Auston Matthews



The Toronto Maple Leafs added a familiar face late this week, signing veteran goaltender James Reimer to a professional tryout contract. The move came shortly after Joseph Woll stepped away on personal leave, leaving Toronto thin in net behind new starter Anthony Stolarz. Reimer’s return to the organization brings both veteran insurance and a touch of nostalgia for Leafs Nation.Reimer, 37, is no stranger to Toronto fans. Drafted in 2006, he played six seasons with the Leafs, logging 207 regular-season games with a .914 save percentage and 11 shutouts. He backstopped the team during their dramatic 2013 playoff series against the Boston Bruins and was part of the 2017 return to the postseason. Since leaving in 2016, he has bounced around the league, suiting up for six NHL teams and accumulating more than 500 career appearances.While Toronto’s goaltending depth looked steady just weeks ago, Woll’s absence has shifted the picture. Reimer now arrives as insurance, hoping to show he can still contribute at the NHL level. The Leafs hinted at a possible debut during their exhibition rematch with Montreal, though he ultimately stayed on the bench as Toronto fell 4-2.Beyond the on-ice questions, Reimer quickly made headlines for his sense of humor. The goalie wore No. 34 during his first run with the Leafs, but that number belongs to Auston Matthews now. With a grin, Reimer told reporters, “We had a little bit of a tussle, and we kind of figured that probably Monday, in practice, we’ll have a bout at centre. Winner takes the number.”Of course, the captain isn’t expected to part with his iconic number, and Reimer has been skating in No. 47, which he has worn in recent years. Still, the joke struck a chord with fans, reminding many of why Reimer was such a beloved figure in Toronto despite the ups and downs of his tenure.Reimer’s signing might be a short-term solution, but his return has already sparked intrigue. Whether he gets into game action or not, his presence brings both stability in net and a lighthearted storyline that Leafs Nation can rally around.Also Read: How long will Cam Fowler stay with the Blues?

The Gretzky effect: How Wayne Gretzky made hockey cool in Hollywood and changed the NHL forever,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/the-gretzky-effect-how-wayne-gretzky-made-hockey-cool-in-hollywood-and-changed-the-nhl-forever/articleshow/124194409.cms,"Wayne Gretzky (Getty Images)

From Canadian ice rinks to Hollywood red carpets

Expanding the game beyond traditional markets

When Wayne Gretzky was traded from the Edmonton Oilers to the Los Angeles Kings in 1988, the NHL didn’t just gain a superstar in a new market — it gained Hollywood’s attention. The move, often described as “The Trade,” transformed hockey from a cold-weather niche sport into a spectacle that suddenly had the glitz and glamour of movie premieres.Before Wayne Gretzky, the Kings were largely an afterthought in Los Angeles, overshadowed by the Lakers, Dodgers, and Raiders. But once “The Great One” arrived, things changed overnight. Suddenly, celebrities like Sylvester Stallone, Tom Hanks, and Goldie Hawn were spotted in the stands at the Forum. His wife, actress Janet Jones, further linked Gretzky to Hollywood’s inner circle, making hockey part of the city’s social scene.Gretzky himself once reflected on that era, saying, “It was unbelievable to see all these movie stars at our games. It gave the sport a different kind of spotlight.” That spotlight not only boosted the Kings’ profile but also brought an entirely new audience to the NHL.The Gretzky trade didn’t just make hockey fashionable in LA — it reshaped the NHL’s strategy. The league saw proof that the sport could succeed in non-traditional markets.Teams later sprouted in places like Anaheim, San Jose, Phoenix, and eventually Las Vegas. Many hockey historians argue that without Gretzky, the NHL might never have expanded so aggressively into the American Sunbelt.Even decades later, his impact is visible. The Vegas Golden Knights, who won the Stanley Cup in 2023, and the surge of hockey in California youth programs can be traced back to Gretzky’s years in Los Angeles. He didn’t just make the Kings competitive; he made hockey aspirational in places where ice rinks were once an afterthought.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky and the politics of Canadian identity: Why The Great One became more than just a hockey legend Wayne Gretzky’s move to LA was more than a trade — it was a cultural shift.

Florida Panthers could target Evgeni Malkin to fill lineup gaps amid Aleksander Barkov and Matthew Tkachuk injuries

Barkov Injury, Kaprizov, and Capitals ft. Greg Wyshynski & Michael Russo | The Sheet with Jeff Marek

Challenges and considerations for a potential Evgeni Malkin trade for the Florida Panthers

The Florida Panthers are facing a significant injury challenge as the new NHL season approaches, with center Aleksander Barkov expected to miss up to nine months following knee surgery and star winger Matthew Tkachuk sidelined until December. Amid this crisis, ESPN insider Greg Wyshynski has suggested a potential solution: trading for veteran Pittsburgh Penguins center Evgeni Malkin. The move could provide immediate impact for a Panthers team chasing another deep playoff run.Wyshynski emphasized that acquiring Malkin could help address Florida’s offensive and leadership voids caused by injuries. The 39-year-old veteran is entering the final season of his four-year, $24.4 million contract and has spent his entire 19-year career with the Pittsburgh Penguins, winning three Stanley Cups. With Barkov out, Malkin could step directly into the Panthers’ top-line center role, bringing size, playmaking, and secondary scoring to the team.Malkin posted 50 points in 68 games last season, demonstrating he still has the ability to contribute offensively, even past his prime. ESPN insider analysis suggests that fitting Malkin into Florida’s system would be seamless, particularly on a top line that is short on scoring depth.The veteran’s experience could also provide invaluable guidance for younger players navigating playoff-level competition.Despite the benefits, acquiring Malkin comes with financial and logistical challenges. The Panthers are already approximately $4.5 million over the salary cap, meaning they would need to make adjustments to accommodate Malkin’s contract. Additionally, Pittsburgh is likely to demand significant assets in return, potentially including high draft picks or top prospects. Florida lacks first-round picks until 2028 but does have two 2026 second-round selections that could be leveraged in trade discussions.While the cost is high, the potential upside of adding a veteran center capable of filling Barkov’s role and providing playoff experience could make the Panthers a stronger contender. Analysts note that similar mid-season acquisitions, like Brad Marchand’s trade to Florida last season, had a measurable impact on the team’s performance and Stanley Cup chase.With Barkov and Tkachuk sidelined, the Florida Panthers face pressing lineup challenges, but a trade for Evgeni Malkin could provide a quick solution. While financial and asset-related hurdles exist, Malkin’s experience, scoring ability, and leadership could give the Panthers the boost needed to maintain their status as serious Stanley Cup contenders.Also Read: Montreal Canadiens rookie Ivan Demidov shows star potential in preseason vs. Toronto Maple Leafs","Florida Panthers could target Evgeni Malkin to fill lineup gaps amid Aleksander Barkov and Matthew Tkachuk injuries.

Caitlin Clark’s recent encounter with a tiny fan went viral

Caitlin Clark’s playoff return is now uncertain after season-ending injury

Despite being injured and unable to participate in the WNBA Playoffs, Caitlin Clark, a star of the Indiana Fever, still makes time to meet everyone who wants to see her, including a newborn. She was recently spotted at the courtside, speaking with a family and giving an infant fan a hug before the Fever's crucial Game 4 matchup on September 28. This wasn’t the first time Clark was seen admiring a baby. In recent years, she was spotted loving babies- sometimes babysitting the kid of the Fevers’ assistant, while sometimes interacting with a little fan.Clark was recently spotted with a tiny Fever fan. Along with interacting with the infant, she also signed autographs for fans. Meanwhile, a commentator remarked as she held the baby:“I mean, this right now.. This baby.. Cat just picked up is like I literally have that effect on babies except for my own luckily and sometimes my own... There's nothing worse than when you love a baby and they just don't want anything to do with you…”The commentator continued:“Oh, she's softened up to the baby. It was precious. I don't want this.. That baby's gonna regret that. I don't know...”This wasn't the first time she was spotted with a baby. In May, Clark was spotted strolling outside Baltimore's CFG Bank Arena while holding a toddler. Due to a quadriceps injury, Clark did not play in the Indiana Fever's matchup with the Washington Mystics.The infant is the son of Austin Kelly and Karima Christmas-Kelly, assistant coaches for Indiana, according to Sports Illustrated.Additionally, at an Indiana Fever event in August of last year, Clark met a very young fan. She was beaming as she met a fan's two-week-old child at the Fever Fore Change golf excursion, sponsored by HYPTE Branded Solution.A video of the encounter, in which an ecstatic Clark got to hold the infant and autograph the child's onesie, was posted by the Fever on X. The two-week-old is reportedly the ""youngest [fan] to get an autograph"" from the WNBA star, Clark informed the mother, adding that the infant was ""so cute.""The real question now is if Caitlin Clark is returning. She may return if the Indiana Fever make it to the finals and if she is considered healthy. The team recently hosted Game 3 of their best-of-five WNBA semifinal matchup with Las Vegas on Friday.Clark's 2025 season has been disappointing following a rookie campaign in which she earned the league's Rookie of the Year Award and set other WNBA rookie records. Before being cast out with a season-ending injury, she struggled with several injuries and missed a large portion of the season.On September 4, the Fever reported that Clark had incurred a season-ending injury and removed her from the active postseason roster. That is to say that the 2024 Rookie of the Year might not play in the 2025 playoffs. Now, the Fever risks losing to the Aces during Game 4. In order to force a decisive Game 5 in Las Vegas later this week, they will want to win and continue the series.Also read: ""Got fined $200 for this"" - Caitlin Clark claims WNBA fined her $200 for reportedly mocking refs after Fever’s playoff win","Caitlin Clark, a star of the Indiana Fever, was recently spotted with a tiny Fever fan.

Al Horford strengthens Golden State Warriors’ lineup as Boston Celtics face uncertainty at center position

Al Horford and the Golden State Warriors have finalized their long-awaited agreement. ESPN reported that veteran big man Al Horford is joining the Warriors on a multi-year contract. Horford's representative announced on Sunday that he has agreed to join the team in free agency, according to Shams Charania of ESPN. Horford is the most recent victim of the Boston Celtics' second apron. As part of their efforts to reduce money this summer, the team lost outstanding reserve Luke Kornet early in free agency and moved starters Kristaps Porziņģis and Jrue Holiday.The Golden State reportedly gains from Boston's loss because the Warriors are acquiring the kind of big man they need to contend for the 2026 title. According to ESPN's Shams Charania , Al Horford has agreed to a multiyear contract with the Golden State Warriors, guaranteeing that the renowned veteran big man will play in the NBA for the 19th time.However, the deal's terms and the contract were not disclosed. As per Charania’s X post:“BREAKING: Free agent Al Horford has committed to a multi-year deal with the Golden State Warriors, agent Jason Glushon tells ESPN. After seven of the past nine years in Boston and winning the 2024 title, Horford will enter his 19th NBA season as the Warriors' starting center..”He further said:""Horford verbally committed to the Warriors on Sunday, sources said..The sides are working through the final financial terms, with a signing in the coming days after the final decision from restricted free agent Jonathan Kuminga, a source said.""Horford might prove to be an asset for the Warriors. They depend on their players to make quick judgements and pass more than any other club in the league. Most significantly, being able to shoot threes at any other position is essential for a center because they play two guys, Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green , who aren't very good three-point shooters. Horford meets all the requirements.Horford had his last five seasons playing for the Boston Celtics, starting as a center in their 2024 NBA championship season. He is going to be part of a Warriors squad that is seeking to stay competitive in Stephen Curry's later years.During the 2023-24 season, Horford earned his first title with the Boston Celtics . Since being back in Boston in 2022, he has connected on more than 39% of his three-point attempts. Although he won't have enough ball to contribute five assists per game as he did at his best, the Warriors will benefit much from his passing.Although Kevon Looney, who signed with the New Orleans Pelicans on Monday, will be missed by Golden State, Horford is a significant improvement for a Warriors squad that is now loaded for victory.The Celtics do not currently have a center who is dependable and capable of starting. They signed Minnesota reserve Luka Garza to the roster, and bench players Xavier Tillman and Neemias Queta are still there. However, one of the biggest uncertainties is still regarding their center position.According to reports, they may attempt to reroute Anfernee Simons, whom they obtained in the Holiday trade, which might result in the acquisition of a big player. If not, the Celtics may fall behind because they have little spending money and a fast shrinking pool of free agents.Also read: Is Trey Murphy III on the move?

Brittany Mahomes shares family moment while Patrick Mahomes faces early season pressure with Kansas City Chiefs

Gilbert Arenas blames Taylor Swift for Travis Kelce’s slow start and Patrick Mahomes’ struggles with the Kansas City Chiefs

Gilbert Arenas RETURNS To The Arena to Preview Week 4

Brittany Mahomes, wife of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes , shared a viral Instagram video of her three kids ahead of a pivotal Week 4 game. Brittany posted a clip of 4-year-old Sterling behind the wheel of a luxury mini car with baby Golden in the passenger seat and 2-year-old Bronze riding in the back. She captioned the video “too blessed” as the siblings cruised through the Mahomes’ home.The post comes as the Chiefs prepare for a critical matchup against the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday night at Arrowhead Stadium. Kansas City is 1-2 and risks falling to 1-3 if it loses, a scenario that could threaten its bid for a 10th straight AFC West title. Brittany, who recently turned 30 and celebrated with friends including Taylor Swift , has stayed busy balancing game days and parenting while Patrick tries to stabilize a shaky start to the season.Kansas City’s slow start has made Sunday night’s game feel like a must-win. A loss would leave the defending division champions chasing the standings in October. The Baltimore Ravens arrive with the same 1-2 record after losing on Monday night but still bring a physical defense and a hungry roster.Former NFL quarterback Derek Carr said on the “Home Grown Network,” “I got the Ravens… You do not think that there is some toughness in that building that has been established.”The comment reflects a growing belief that Baltimore’s defense and rushing attack could push around Kansas City if the Chiefs do not find rhythm.Patrick Mahomes has faced uneven offensive production. Wide receivers Rashee Rice and Xavier Worthy have been unavailable due to injuries, forcing Mahomes to lean heavily on Travis Kelce , who has started slow. The star tight end dropped a key pass that became a late interception in a 20-17 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles last week and was caught in a sideline confrontation with head coach Andy Reid during the Week 3 win over the New York Giants.Former NBA player Gilbert Arenas added fuel to the narrative surrounding Kansas City’s offense. On his show “The Arena Gridiron,” Arenas said, “[Mahomes] lost his tight end to a woman. … Kelce done lost his name. The Gen Zs know him as what? Taylor Swift’s boyfriend.”Taylor Swift has been tied to any dip in Travis Kelce’s performance since their relationship became public in 2023. Kelce has 10 catches for 134 yards and one touchdown through three games, far below his usual pace. Arenas pointed out that Patrick Mahomes is missing key targets and operating with a depleted receiving group, making the offense easier to defend.The Chiefs need both Mahomes and Kelce to deliver against the Ravens to avoid a damaging 1-3 start. Fans will be watching Arrowhead Stadium closely Sunday night, and waiting to see if Brittany shares another family moment as her husband tries to keep Kansas City’s season alive.","Brittany Mahomes shared a viral Instagram video of her three kids ahead of a pivotal Week 4 game.

Team USA is fired up and rallied behind captain Keegan Bradley as the 2025 Ryder Cup plays out at Bethpage Black. Players, such as Xander Schauffele, have lauded Bradley's strategic moves and leadership style, which they say can clearly see the path to victory.Team USA's captain since July 2024 and for the Ryder Cup, Keegan Bradley, is wise beyond his years. He is the youngest American captain since Arnold Palmer in 1963 at age 39. Bradley told The Post that his bond with Bethpage Black, which he visited during college, played a big part in shaping the team's approach. Being so familiar with the course allows him to devise specific game plans for various players and should give Team USA an advantage.Bradley made several big calls, one of them being the six captain's picks he chose Collin Morikawa, Cameron Young, Sam Burns, and the like. His selections suggest a desire to build an aligned team rather than depend only on history.

Saleh’s earlier signal-stealing remarks sparked week-long tension between coaching rivals

Players and coaching staff intervene while quarterback uses the tension as motivation to win

Tensions erupted Sunday after the Jacksonville Jaguars eked out a 26-21 win over the San Francisco 49ers, as a week-long controversy between Jaguars coach Liam Coen and 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh reached its boiling point. Saleh’s earlier remarks about Jacksonville “legally stealing signals” sparked a fiery postgame confrontation that required staff intervention and instantly grabbed the attention of fans and the league.The postgame handshake quickly escalated when Coen returned to midfield to face Saleh. Video shows Coen shouting, “Keep my name out of your mouth. Keep my name out of your f---ing mouth,” while Saleh fired back, “I will f--- your world up.” Staff members rushed in—49ers personnel restraining Saleh, and Jaguars center Robert Hainsey holding Coen back—preventing a physical altercation.Fans had plenty to say online. @oliviaattalla joked, “They are too old to be fighting like this in front of the players lol🤣😂😂.” @thefootballdudes questioned the strategy, “If Saleh knew they were ‘stealing signs’ earlier this week, why not change them? Could have been an advantage.”And diehard Coen supporters like @LIAMCOENLOVER cheered, “THATS MY COACH, TALK SHIT GET HIT BALD AHH😂😂😂😂.”Saleh’s comments earlier in the week praising Jacksonville’s signal-reading ability set the stage for the clash. Though he emphasized the legality of the practice, some viewed it as a subtle critique of Coen’s coaching. The postgame confrontation was the culmination of a week of simmering professional pride and competitive tension.Coen initially avoided responding to Saleh’s comments in interviews but clearly felt compelled to defend his team’s reputation after the game. The intensity of the exchange reflected both coaches’ high stakes as top candidates for Jacksonville’s next head-coaching role.Quarterback Trevor Lawrence said the team used the situation as motivation. “If you’re going to give me free fuel, you take it,” he said, emphasizing that execution, not external drama, secured the win. Meanwhile, 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan suggested Saleh’s comments were misinterpreted. He said the defensive coordinator had intended to acknowledge Jacksonville’s offensive skill, not provoke a personal feud.What began as a discussion of strategy quickly evolved into a public display of pride and rivalry. The Jaguars’ narrow victory and the fiery postgame exchange underscored how perception, emotion, and professional ambition intersect in the NFL. Fans, players, and coaches alike were reminded that the league thrives not just on X’s and O’s, but on emotion, rivalry, and competitive fire.Also read: Rookie Jalen Cropper steps into the spotlight to lead Cowboys’ offense during CeeDee Lamb’s absence","Jaguars coach Liam Coen and 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh exchanged heated words after Sunday's game.

Minnesota Lynx struggles in the absence of Napheesa Collier



The Phoenix Mercury completed a thrilling comeback to defeat the Minnesota Lynx 86-81 in Game 4 of the WNBA semifinals, punching their ticket to the 2025 Finals for the first time since 2021. Trailing by double digits in the first and third quarters, the Mercury showed their prowess, turning a tense contest into a statement victory. With veteran leadership and clutch performances, Phoenix proved they are a team to watch in the postseason.Alyssa Thomas was at the heart of the Mercury’s comeback, finishing with 23 points, 10 assists, and eight rebounds. Her driving floater in the final minutes provided the spark that helped seal the victory. DeWanna Bonner added 13 points, including 11 in the fourth quarter, hitting all three of her crucial three-pointers down the stretch. Bonner and Thomas, teammates with the Connecticut Sun in 2022, have now earned another chance to chase a WNBA championship together.Forward Satou Sabally also played a key role, scoring 21 points and maintaining Phoenix’s offensive momentum throughout the game. The Mercury’s bench contributed as well, particularly Kahleah Copper, whose early scoring in previous games helped keep the series alive.Collectively, the Mercury outscored the Lynx 31-13 in the decisive fourth quarter, erasing a 68-55 deficit and demonstrating remarkable poise under pressure.The top-seeded Minnesota Lynx were hampered by the absence of star forward Napheesa Collier, who missed Game 4 due to a left ankle injury sustained in Game 3. Head coach Cheryl Reeve was also suspended, leaving associate head coach Eric Thibault to guide the team.Despite these setbacks, Kayla McBride put forth a career playoff-high 31 points, keeping Minnesota within striking distance. However, the Lynx could not overcome Phoenix’s defensive adjustments and scoring bursts in the final quarter.This comeback caps an emotional series for Phoenix, who rallied from 14-point deficits in key moments and exhibited veteran leadership, strategic adaptability, and unyielding team spirit. Their semifinal run, marked by consistent fourth-quarter surges, sets up a historic Finals matchup against the winner of the Las Vegas Aces–Indiana Fever series.The 2025 WNBA Finals will tip off on Friday, marking the first best-of-seven championship in league history.

Eagles ’ offense struggles after early dominance



Urgency over comfort defines Eagles’ season



Philadelphia Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni left no room for excuses following a hard-fought 31-25 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Despite the victory, Sirianni was candid about the team’s performance and the areas needing urgent attention. “We weren’t coaching, playing [well] second half — they got us,” he said postgame, via The Athletic reporter Zach Berman on X, formerly Twitter. His frank assessment highlighted a game that started strong but nearly slipped away.The Eagles stormed to a 24-6 lead behind Jalen Hurts’ precision under pressure and a spark from special teams when Sydney Brown returned a blocked punt for a touchdown. Saquon Barkley added a short-yardage score using the “tush push” family play. But the Buccaneers responded with explosive plays, including Baker Mayfield’s 77-yard strike, turning what seemed like a comfortable win into a tense finish. Philadelphia leaned heavily on takeaways and situational defense, ultimately surviving 31-25 to remain 4-0.Sirianni’s intensity was visible on the sidelines, notably in a heated exchange with Mayfield. The fiery moment, captured on live broadcast, reflected his protective leadership and readiness to ignite his team when momentum wavers.Despite the victory, the game exposed vulnerabilities in both the running and passing game, emphasizing that early leads alone won’t secure wins against quality opponents.The takeaway from Sunday’s contest is clear: urgency trumps comfort. Philadelphia has won 20 of its last 21 games and maintains a perfect record in 2025, but Sirianni’s blunt critique signals that excellence requires more than just holding on. Late interceptions and defensive stops were crucial, but a Super Bowl contender must dominate rather than merely survive. For the Eagles, this message will resonate as the season progresses, reminding players that margins for error are slim and standards remain sky-high.https://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/video/nick-sirianni-postgame-locker-room-speech-buccaneers-week-4-2025The Eagles’ 4-0 start is intact, yet the lessons from Tampa Bay offer a timely reality check: talent wins games, but discipline, focus, and relentless execution win championships.Also Read: Chicago Bears’ Week 4 comeback overshadowed by D’Andre Swift’s nightmare performance against Las Vegas Raiders","Nick Sirianni left no room for excuses following a hard-fought 31-25 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. “We weren’t coaching, playing [well] second half — they got us,” he said postgame.
