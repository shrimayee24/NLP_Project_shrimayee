NEW DELHI: South Africa will look to improve their batting performance when they face a spirited Bangladesh in their Group D match of the T20 World Cup on Monday. The match will be played at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, where both teams will need to adapt to the unpredictable pitch conditions .South Africa may have a slight advantage, having already played two matches at this venue. Bangladesh, however, have some familiarity with the conditions after facing India in a warm-up game here.The Proteas struggled to secure a victory against the Netherlands on Saturday, and their batting lineup also appeared shaky in the win over Sri Lanka, where they chased modest totals of 103 and 77 runs, respectively.South Africa are likely to retain their effective four-pronged pace attack, consisting of Anrich Nortje, Kagiso Rabada , Marco Jansen, and Ottneil Baartman, with Keshav Maharaj handling the spin duties.However, their batters need to step up. Against the Netherlands, South Africa were only 33 for 3 after 10 overs. It was the efforts of Tristan Stubbs at No. 4 and David Miller , who scored an unbeaten fifty, that helped avoid a potential third consecutive World Cup defeat to the Dutch.A win in this match would secure South Africa a spot in the Super Eight stage.Bangladesh, on the other hand, started their campaign with a morale-boosting win over Sri Lanka. Yet, like South Africa, their batters need to perform better, having struggled against India in the warm-up and also showing vulnerability against Sri Lanka.The top order's inconsistency is a concern, and although Liton Das has been reliable, others need to shoulder more responsibility, especially under challenging conditions.All-rounder Shakib Al Hasan 's form with both bat and ball has been subpar, which is worrisome for Bangladesh. Additionally, their pace attack lacks a genuine fast bowler who can trouble the opposition early on, potentially putting them at a disadvantage against South Africa's powerful batting line up.Historically, South Africa have dominated Bangladesh in T20Is, winning all their encounters, including in the last two World Cup editions.The Nassau County International Cricket Stadium features a bowling-friendly pitch that poses significant challenges for batters, resulting in low-scoring matches. The pitch provides substantial assistance to pace bowlers, making it difficult for batters to score runs freely. As a result, teams may find it advantageous to chase targets on this ground, considering the challenges faced by batters.Nassau County International Cricket Stadium has hosted four T20 World Cup matches so far, with teams winning three times while chasing and once while batting first. The average score for teams batting first is 103, while for teams chasing, it's 102. Canada holds the record for the highest total of 137/7 against Ireland, while Sri Lanka holds the record for the lowest total of 77/10 against South Africa.Given the pitch report, bowlers are likely to be the most valuable players in fantasy contests. It would be wise to select more bowlers in your team. Additionally, middle-order batters who can handle both spin and pace well are likely to perform better in this match.Mustafizur Rahman poses a significant threat to the South African batters with his exceptional form. He has been consistently taking wickets, both early on and at the death, showcasing his effectiveness throughout an innings. In the last match, he proved his prowess by claiming three crucial wickets.David Miller's impactful performance in the previous match, where he scored 59 runs off 51 balls, highlights his importance to the South African team. His ability to stabilize the innings and accelerate the scoring makes him a key player, especially if South Africa bats first. Miller emerges as a prime candidate for captain/vice-captain selection in this match.Anrich Nortje has been a standout performer for South Africa in the T20 World Cup 2024, claiming six wickets in their two matches so far. His ability to strike early in the powerplay and maintain pressure throughout makes him a valuable asset. If South Africa bowls first, Nortje will be instrumental in putting Bangladesh under pressure early on, making him a strong contender for captain/vice-captain selection in this game.Aiden Markram (c), Ottniel Baartman, Gerald Coetzee, Quinton de Kock, Bjorn Fortuin, Reeza Hendricks, Marco Jansen, Heinrich Klaasen, Keshav Maharaj, David Miller, Anrich Nortje, Kagiso Rabada, Ryan Rickelton, Tabraiz Shamsi, Tristan Stubbs.Najmul Hossain Shanto (c), Taskin Ahmed, Litton Das, Soumya Sarkar, Tanzid Hasan Tamim, Shakib Al Hasan, Tawhid Hridoy, Mahmud Ullah Riyad, Jaker Ali Anik, Tanvir Islam, Shak Mahedi Hasan, Rishad Hossain, Mustafizur Rahman, Shoriful Islam, Tanzim Hasan Sakib.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram on Monday criticised Babar Azam's team for their meek surrender to Team India in a low-scoring, high-octane ICC T20 World Cup 2024 clash at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York on Sunday.India, led by Rohit Sharma, defeated Pakistan by six runs in a tense encounter. With this win, Team India moved to the top of Group A.Pakistan won the toss and elected to bowl first, where Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf picked up three wickets each.Rishabh Pant was India's top contributor with a quick knock of 42, but India ultimately bowled out for 119.In response, Mohammad Rizwan set the platform for the chase with a patient knock of 31, but Pakistan lost wickets at regular intervals and were restricted to 113/7 in 20 overs. India's fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah made crucial dismissals, finishing with figures of 3-14.The result keeps India on top of the Group A standings with two wins in two matches, while Pakistan have zero points after two defeats, following their upset by the hosts, the United States, in their first game.Bashing Green Shirts' poor show against India, Akram said 'Pakistan doesn't need an enemy'.[Pakistan doesn't need an enemy, they have plenty themselves. Now should we put a pacifier in their mouths? Now we have to explain to them what situation awareness is? Babar will explain, the coach will explain],"" an angry Akram said on Star Sports.""Pichle 8-10 saal se khel rahe hain ye batsmen.

[These batsmen have been playing for the last 8-10 years. Now should I tell Rizwan that the main bowler has come for one over, to take a wicket? You didn't hit a boundary after 10 overs.

[Now it has started to become embarrassing. As a Pakistani, I want to back the Pakistan team. But there's a limit to everything]"", Akram said while slamming the Pakistan team.Pakistan now need to beat Canada and Ireland by a big margin so that they can improve their net run rate.Pakistan will qualify if India win their next two games against the USA and Canada, and the USA lose their remaining matches.","India defeated Pakistan by six runs in a tense encounter in New York on Sunday.

'Aapne pahle innings dekh li India ki...': Misbah-ul-Haq criticizes Pakistan's batting strategy after narrow loss to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/misbah-ul-haq-criticizes-pakistans-batting-strategy-after-narrow-loss-to-india/articleshow/110887964.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq has criticized the Pakistan team management following their narrow six-run defeat to India in the T20 World Cup match on Sunday. Despite a strong bowling performance that restricted India to just 119 runs, Pakistan's batting lineup failed to capitalize, jeopardizing their chances of progressing in the tournament.Misbah pointed out critical errors in Pakistan's approach during the run chase, particularly the underutilization of middle-order batter Iftikhar Ahmed , who came in to bat at No.7 despite being the lone specialist batter in the middle order.""Middle order par confidence nahi hai. Seedhi si baat hai. Hum unko jis tarike se utilize karte hai, Iftikhar hai or jo bhi khelta hai middle order me. Hum jab unke number jis tarah se hai, run-a-ball bhi hai toh hum unko nahi bhejte. Saal me unki baari aati hai do, woh bhi aisi situation mein pariyaan dete hai ki. Aapne agar middle order ki batsmen khilaya hai toh bhai uska jo number hai usme aap kyun nahi bhej rahe usko,"" Misbah said on Hum Sport.Elaborating on the batting order decisions, Misbah questioned the rationale behind sending all-rounders ahead of Iftikhar on a challenging pitch in New York. He stressed that on such surfaces, where power hitting is less effective, situational assessment is crucial.""Simple si baat hai, Iftikhar agar khel raha hai, batsman woh hena. Imad [Wasim] ussey pahle gaya, uske baad Shadab [Khan] ussey pahle gaya and he was the last. Aap unko 7th number par bhej rahe hai, aur yeh throughout chal raha hai. Aisi pitch par jahaan aapko pata hai power hitting ki jarurat nahi hai. Situation ko assess karne ki jarurat hai,"" Misbah added.Misbah also criticized Pakistan's inability to learn from India's innings, where their power hitters struggled to score.""Aapne pahle innings dekh li India ki, once you have to score over run-a-ball aakhri 10 overs me woh bada mushkil hai. Humne isko 6 ya under 6 rakhna hai, iske uper le jaake, chahe unke paas jitne bhi damage karne wale batsmen ho - Hardik Pandya , jeetne bhi aaye [Shivam] Dube, unse nahi huwe hai runs. Hit nahi lag rahi thi. Toh hume ye sochna chahiye tha ki Iftikhar ko bacha ke rakhne ka kya faida. End me toh aapse hit nahi lagegi. Jahaan 6 ya 7 nahi ho raha, toh ek dafa 9-10 me le jayenge toh woh kya karega. Agar aapne bhejna hi tha, okay fine Shadab ko run-a-ball tha, pichle match me usne perform kiya huwa hai toh usko uper bhejte phir. Uske baad Iftikhar aata,"" Misbah said.He further questioned the decision to send Imad Wasim ahead of Iftikhar and criticized the team for playing fewer batters on a bowling-friendly pitch.""Imad ko bhej rahe hai, theek hai ki jao abhi normal khelna hai. Yeh pitch nahi hai ki jahaan end pe maarke aap poora kar logey. Usko left hander ke liye bheja aur woh left-hander ka hi poora over dot khel gaya. Basically, you are building pressure aur apne batsman ko woh confidence nahi de rahe hai. Phir toh baat simple si hai ki aap specialist teen batsmen se khel rahe hai, bowling pitch pe. India 6 batsmen ke saath khelke bhi 2 all-rounder khela rahe hai. Sochne ki baat hai ki mushkil pitch pe, jo batting ke liye mushkil hai, under pressure kaun hoga - batting hogi.

‘Bat vs bat’ bores Bumrah

NEW YORK: A day has gone by, but we are still in a bit of a daze. Under a brilliant Sunday sun in New York , India engineered a magnificent come-from-behind win against Pakistan that was one of their best in recent times.The win is, probably, at par with what the same bunch did against Pakistan in Melbourne in their T20 World Cup opener one-anda-half years ago.On that day it was the best batsman in modern cricket — Virat Kohli — who cornered all the glory. This time, it was down to India’s greatest match-winner with the ball, Jasprit Bumrah , who was not part of the 2022 team due to a career-threatening back injury.At one stage, the match was slipping out of India’s grasp. With Pakistan needing 40 off 36 balls and Mohammed Rizwan fighting it out, it seemed game over for Rohit Sharma’s men, until Bumrah (3/14) decided he wouldn’t let that happen.His last two overs — the 15th and the 19th of the innings — cost merely five runs as Pakistan choked in the chase of 119.“That third over of mine, if that had gone Pakistan’s way, the game would have gone in their favour. We were very happy that we pulled it off and I think at that moment the game shifted our way,” Bumrah said about the game-changing 15th over, in which he dismissed Rizwan.Bumrah was the leader of the pack, guiding the bowlers on how to go about things when things looked to be spiralling out of control. The pitch had quite a bit in it but the challenge was to not get carried away or try for the magic ball that could well be counter-productive.“We had to be accurate because if we go for magic deliveries and try to be too desperate, run-making could become easy because they knew the target. So, we had to be very mindful of not overdoing it and add up to the pressure by using the big boundaries. We were able to create that and everybody got wickets,” Bumrah said.While the 30-year-old was more than happy to share the accolades with his teammates, there is no denying that the paceman has been in the form of his life in the last few months across formats.He was brilliant in the ODI World Cup last year, followed it up with match-winning spells against England in Test matches on pitches that had nothing for the faster bowlers. In the IPL, where his team Mumbai Indians played some of their worst cricket, Bumrah was the lone standout, taking 20 wickets at an economy rate of 6.48. And now he has got two back-to-back 'Player of the Match' awards on the biggest stage.Is the paceman in the best phase of his career?A smiling Bumrah said, “A year ago, the same people were saying that I might not play again and my career is over and now the question has changed. I don’t look at it that way. For me it is about bowling at the best of my ability and trying to solve the problem that is there in front of me.”When the outside noise becomes too much, Bumrah believes in creating “a bubble” for himself and tries to “control the controllables”.“I know this ‘sticking to the process’ idea is a cliché, but all I try is trying to find the best option for myself. If I look at people and pressure, then emotion takes over and it doesn’t work for me. So, I create my own bubble and try to do my best,” the champion bowler said.The bowlers are enjoying a great run and Bumrah doesn’t mind that one bit.“Our country is a batsman-loving country but I feel it’s good that bowlers are coming to the fore. I enjoy it when there is a challenge between bat and ball. When it becomes bat versus bat, I switch off the TV,” Bumrah said.","Jasprit Bumrah has been in the form of his life in the last few months across formats.

However, they fell short in the 20th over, chasing a modest 114.With six needed off the last two balls, Mahmudullah was caught brilliantly by Aiden Markram near the ropes off Keshav Maharaj (3/27), who emerged as South Africa's most successful bowler.

NEW DELHI: India's pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah couldn't help but laugh at the drastic shift in narratives about his career over the past year. Once doubted for his ability to return to form following a lower back stress fracture, Bumrah has now firmly reestablished himself as one of the world's leading fast bowlers.In 2022, Bumrah underwent surgery for a lower back stress fracture, causing him to miss the T20 World Cup in Australia.Just before his comeback, he suffered a strain, leading to an absence of more than ten months. This led to widespread skepticism about his capacity to manage the workload of playing in three formats.However, Bumrah has silenced his critics with his performances in the last one year.""See a year ago, the same people were saying that I might not play again and my career is over and then now the question changed,"" Bumrah said, addressing those who doubted his resilience and determination.Bumrah's return to form has been a masterclass in handling pressure and focusing on the controllables. ""I am not looking at whether I am bowling at the best of my ability. I try to solve the problem that is there in front of me,"" he explained. ""I know it's a cliched answer... but I was trying to focus on what is the best option over here on a wicket like this.""Avoiding external pressure has been key to his success. ""Because if I look at the outside noise, if I look at people and pressure and emotion takes over, then things don't really work for me,"" the 30-year-old said.Despite the challenges of the IPL, where bowlers faced tough conditions, Bumrah and the Indian bowling unit have adapted well to the T20 World Cup pitches. ""Obviously, the IPL that we played was not very bowler-friendly but we are very happy that we didn't come here with that baggage,"" Bumrah noted.Bumrah's deep understanding with captain Rohit Sharma , developed over years of playing together for Mumbai Indians , has been crucial. ""We were very clear the message in the huddle was that now that is over, what is next? What are the things that are in our control? So, we will try to focus on that and not to create panic,"" he said.In low-scoring matches, maintaining composure is essential. ""If we go for magic deliveries and try to be too desperate, run-making becomes easy and they know the target. So, we had to be very mindful of not overdoing it,"" Bumrah explained.Bumrah's advocacy for bowlers reflects his appreciation for the often under-recognized contributions of his peers. ""I always advocate bowlers, but we're very happy with the appreciation that bowlers have received because our country is obviously a batsman-loving country and we understand but we are very happy that bowlers are coming up front,"" he said.With this victory, India leads Group A with two wins from two games, while Pakistan's chances of advancing look slim.","Jasprit Bumrah has silenced his critics with his performances in the last one year.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan captain Salim Malik has accused all-rounder Imad Wasim of deliberately wasting balls during Pakistan's six-run defeat to India in their ICC T20 World Cup match in New York. Chasing a modest target of 120 runs, Pakistan fell short at 113 for 7, consuming a staggering 59 dot balls in the process.Imad Wasim's slow-paced innings saw him take 23 balls to score just 15 runs, which Malik criticized as detrimental to Pakistan's run chase.""You look at his (Wasim) innings and it appears as if he was wasting balls, not scoring runs, and making things difficult in the run-chase,"" Malik said on the 24 News channel.Adding to the controversy, another former captain, Shahid Afridi , hinted at internal discord within the team, suggesting that some players have issues with skipper Babar Azam . Afridi emphasized the crucial role of a captain in maintaining team unity and morale.""A captain brings everyone together; either he spoils the team environment or he builds the team. Let this World Cup finish, and I will speak openly,"" Afridi said. He also noted his close relationship with left-arm pacerShaheen Afridi , his son-in-law, who was removed as T20 captain just before the World Cup.The Pakistani team has been under fire following consecutive losses to the USA and India, putting their Super Eight chances in jeopardy.

'Arrogance and recklessness': Sunil Gavaskar rips apart Indian batters after dismal show against Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/arrogance-and-recklessness-sunil-gavaskar-rips-apart-indian-batters-after-dismal-show-against-pakistan/articleshow/110853869.cms,"NEW DELHI: Legendary Sunil Gavaskar strongly criticised the Indian batters following their poor performance against arch-rivals Pakistan in the T20 World Cup game at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York.India experienced a mid-innings collapse on a two-paced track, managing a meager 119 against Pakistan on Sunday. Despite a valiant effort from Rishabh Pant , who scored a fortuitous 42 off 31 balls at the new number three spot, the rest of the star-studded line-up struggled to adapt to the challenging surface.Pakistan's bowlers, led by Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf with three wickets each, bowled out India with an over to spare. India's innings crumbled as they lost seven wickets for just 30 runs, falling from a solid 89 for 3 in the 12th over.The legendary cricketer expressed his disappointment over their lackluster display, calling it unacceptable. He highlighted the batsmen's inability to handle pressure and questioned their technique and shot selection.""Disappointing batting performance. It bordered on arrogance and recklessness, if I might use the word. Because there was arrogance at the start of the innings as well. They were looking to hit every ball. This is not an Ireland attack. This is not an ordinary bowling attack,"" Sunil Gavaskar said during the mid-innings interaction on Star Sports.Gavaskar emphasised that such performances are not up to the standards expected at the international level, urging the players to take responsibility and improve their game.""I don't mean any disrespect to Ireland, but Pakistan is a very, very experienced attack. It should have been just that little bit of respect given when the ball was doing a little bit.

Despite a valiant effort from their bowlers, particularly Tanzim Hasan Sakib and Taskin Ahmed, who restricted South Africa to 113/6, Bangladesh couldn't capitalise fully in their chase.Heinrich Klaasen's 46 and David Miller's 29 for South Africa were pivotal in setting a defendable target. The narrow defeat leaves Bangladesh ruing missed opportunities and controversial decisions.The incident happened on the second ball of the 17th over of the innings when Mahmudullah, who was on 15 runs, was controversially declared out lbw by on-field umpire Sam Nogajski off the bowling of Ottneil Baartman . Crucially, the ball had actually deflected offMahmudullah 's pads and trickled to the fine leg boundary. However, since the on-field umpire had declared him out, the ball was deemed dead and Bangladesh lost crucial four runs which ultimately proved to be the margin of victory for the Proteas.

Afridi chose not to divulge details at that moment, stating that he would speak openly after the T20 World Cup finishes.""He knows many things, and so do I, but we cannot talk openly.

NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh praised India as an experienced and formidable team in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024, highlighting the superb bowling performances by Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya in Sunday's six-run win against archrivals Pakistan in New York.

India, who were bundled out for 119 after being asked to bat first — largely thanks to Rishabh Pant 's fighting 31-ball 42 — staged a brilliant comeback to restrict Pakistan to 113/7 in 20 overs. Bumrah claimed 3-14, while Pandya took 2-24.

This marked India's second victory in the tournament after defeating Ireland in their opening match. Harbhajan expressed his elation over the back-to-back wins, stating, ""The thrilling victory against Pakistan has fans buzzing with excitement.""

His contract with Chennaiyin spans two years, ensuring his presence in the team until 2026, and marks him as the fourth acquisition for the club for the season.Chukwu's contribution to Indian football is noteworthy, especially during his time with Jamshedpur under coach Owen Coyle , where he played a significant role in the team securing the ISL League Shield in 2022. Over three seasons in the ISL, he has appeared in 60 matches, scoring 20 goals and providing four assists.

KOLKATA: With his hands on the hip, Sunil Chhetri stood a little distance away from the pack of his teammates in the middle of the park. He stood motionless, as if dazed, for a few seconds, his eyes blank and without expression.

A few minutes ago, Chinese referee Fu Ming had blown the whistle to seal India's goalless draw with Kuwait in their second-round fixture of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, thus ringing the curtain on Chhetri's 19-year-old career in the Blue Tigers jersey.

Suddenly the Salt Lake Stadium stands roared into ""Chhetri, Chhteri"" chants, stirring the 39-year-old out of his trance as he was given a standing ovation He began a lap of honour around the ground. Then he broke down in tears as his teammates, coach Igor Stimac and his coaching staff members lined up to give him the guard of honour. After plethora of hugs and handshakes, he slowly walked down the tunnel, out of everyone's sight and into a new life, leaving behind a legacy Indian football has hardly experienced.

The build-up to Thursday's match was all about Chhetri's send-off. Before the kick-off, the famed Blue Pilgrims stand behind the goalpost unfurled a giant tifo, showing Chhetri holding the earth, a la Hercules. India failed to turn the occasion more memorable and meaningful for Chhetri following the stalemate but that tifo perhaps represents what Chhetri has stood for in Indian football in nearly two decades since making his senior de but against Pakistan in 2005.

He will be remembered as the defining player of his generation, someone who has transcended his sport more than any other, a reference point in Indian football in the true sense of the term.

Unlike IM Vijayan, he might not have an eye for the spectacular. Unlike Bhaichung Bhutia, he might not be a typical fox in the box. Chhetri's game has always been a fable of discipline, dedication and determination.

His goals were cheeky, audacious and brilliant - scoring from midfield to embarrassing the goalkeeper with a Panenka penalty. He made people fall in love with the game.

In a later post-match felicitation, organized by the Indian Football Association, he returned to the ground to receive accolades from the Big 3 clubs - East Bengal , Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting as well as the state government. A few former players like Vijayan, Mehtab Hossain, Alvito D'Cunha and Rahim Nabi then gave him a tight embrace one by one.

KOLKATA: Goodbye Sunil Chhetri. But not a welcome yet for India to a dream place in the third round of the 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifiers .India failed to give their captain a perfect farewell as Igor Stimac 's team was held to a frustrating 0-0 draw against Kuwait at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. As the tearful Chhetri left the international football stage after 151 caps and 94 goals and failing to make an impact in Thursday's game, India's chances of qualifying to the next round now hang in balance.With 5 points from as many matches, and both Afghanistan (4 points from 4 games) and Kuwait (4 points from 5 games) lurking close by, the Blue Tigers now have to beat the already qualified Qatar in their own den in the final Group A fixture next Tuesday to keep hopes alive.A top-two finish in the group is the prerequisite not only for opening the door for brushing shoulders with Asia's best in the third round of World Cup qualifiers, but also guaranteeing a berth in the next edition of Asian Cup .With stakes so high, it felt like a juncture match for Igor Stimac's side. Chhetri's farewell - which drew an official attendance of 58,921 in the stands - further elevated the sense of the occasion.But India never looked in sync with the challenge in question, dishing out another frustrating performance nearly three months after losing 1-2 to Afghanistan in Guwahati and making their job more difficult now.In fact, had Gurpreet Singh Sandhu not effected a string of saves, it could have been quite embarrassing for Chhetri and his team.Stimac started with a new and bold defensive set-up, giving FC Goa left-back Jay Gupta his debut in Blue Tigers jersey and pairing up Rahul Bheke with Anwar Ali in the heart of defence in absence of injured Sandesh Jhingan.But if the Croatian coach's 4-2-3-1 formation was meant to gain early ascendancy, it failed to instil the sort of organisation and obduracy that he would have expected to characterise his backline. The result was a streak of nervy moments invading the home team's play.The match was just four minutes old when Bheke failed to intercept a pass, allowing Mohammad Abdulah to stare at the goal with a world of time and space. But Kuwait's No. 9 ended up hitting straight at Gurpreet.Relieved and reprieved, India tried to make a statement, Liston Colaco seeing his cutback cleared by Kuwait defender Hasan Alanezi for a corner and Chhetri skying an attempt way over the bar.Just when India appeared to have started to establish a more recognisable rhythm, Kuwait shook the hosts out of a false dawn, threatening to upset the applecart.",India fail to give their captain a perfect farewell as Igor Stimac's team was held to a frustrating 0-0 draw against Kuwait at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: India's 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifier against Kuwait ended in a disappointing goalless draw, failing to provide a fitting farewell for the talismanic Sunil Chhetri in his last international match.The result leaves India in a challenging position to progress to the third round of the qualifiers, with only five points collected so far. India's final match is against Asian champions Qatar on June 11, while Kuwait, with four points, will face Afghanistan on the same day.Chhetri's international career spans an impressive 19 years, during which he scored 94 goals, making him the fourth most prolific scorer in international football, behind Portugal superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (128), Iran legend Ali Daei (108) and Argentine wizard Lionel Messi (106).This remarkable achievement is particularly noteworthy for a player from a country like India, and FIFA recognised Chhetri's legendary status upon his announcement of international retirement on May 16.Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium, with a capacity of 68,000, was packed with fans, officials, and former players who came to bid an emotional adieu to Chhetri.His parents, Kharga and Sushila, and wife, Sonam Bhattacharya, were also in attendance.

The first half was action-packed, with both teams creating chances but failing to find the back of the net.The crowd remained engaged, chanting ""Sunil, Sunil"" and ""Vande Mataram"" throughout the match.Kuwait's best chance in the first half came in the fourth minute when Eid Al-Rashidi set up Daham with a perfect through ball. However, Indian goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu made a crucial save to deny Mohammad Daham.India responded in the 11th minute with Liston Colaco's low cross, but Hasan Alanezi's sliding clearance prevented Chhetri from scoring his 95th goal.Debutant Jay Gupta was involved in the action, delivering a sublime low cross from the left in the 25th minute, but the Kuwait defense cleared it for a corner. India failed to capitalize on a freekick in the 28th minute, despite Poojary's impressive run and nutmeg.At the halfway mark, Thapa sent a fantastic ball into the box, which Kuwait cleared to deny Sahal Abdul Samad. The rebound fell to Liston Colaco, who fired a low strike into the side netting from a narrow angle.In the second half, Igor Stimac made changes to India's attacking lineup, introducing Rahim Ali, Brandon Fernandes, and Chheri. However, the desired result was not achieved, as Rahim failed to convert his chances.Kuwait's frustration peaked in the 74th minute when they were denied a penalty claim, leading to a confrontation between players and bench.Replays suggested a foul, but the referee deemed otherwise. Tempers flared up after a challenge on Indian debutant Edmund, resulting in a mini-brawl and yellow cards for both Edmund and Sultan Alenezi.Despite the tension, Edmund rallied the crowd's support with a free-kick opportunity, but Brandon Fernandes' poor delivery meant India's last hope for a win disappeared in the added seven minutes.Stimac handed left-back Gupta his international debut in a 4-2-3-1 formation, with Chhetri as the sole striker.
