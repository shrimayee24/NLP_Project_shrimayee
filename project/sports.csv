Randy Orton , Cody Rhodes and Kevin Owens lost the match against The Bloodline at Money in the Bank shockingly, and now the question is, who will Randy face at SummerSlam?Jacob Fatu made his first appearance in WWE 3 weeks ago on SmackDown and saved his Tribal Chief Solo Sikoa who was trapped between Cody, Randy and Kevin Owens. He not just secured Solo but also single handedly decimated all the three opponents of the Bloodline.He is a genuine force to be reckoned with. The size he has and the agility he possesses, it's only a matter of time before he makes a real mark in the WWE. Even at Money in the Bank, he was the real enforcer of The Bloodline and even saved Solo from the Triple Cross Rhodes Cody was about to deliver. He will be a worthy opponent against Randy to enthral the audience at SummerSlam.Randy Orton has had greed in his eyes whenever he looks at Cody’ WWE Undisputed World championship belt. The week before Money in the Bank, when Cody was addressing the audience and stating that he would have loved to defend his Championship that night, Randy's eyes lit up with a villainous grin across his face. If Cody has to defend his title against a worthy opponent, who better than the 14 time World champion, The Viper.Tama Tonga was brought in by Solo Sikoa to aid him in The Bloodline and as soon as he entered, he eliminated Jimmy Uso from The Bloodline. He has proved that he is a force to be recognised.

Solo Sikoa has always been a thorn in Randy's flash ever since he returned to WWE in November last year. When Randy was going to face Roman Reigns in a Fatal 4 way match for the World championship at Royal Rumble, he faced Solo for the first time and had an upper hand. Also Randy had to come to his friend Kevin Owens’ aid when The Bloodline was continuously troubling him. But now Solo is not the same force and has become even more fierce with a new Bloodline forming under him.Tanga Loa was the person who saved Solo Sikoa and Tama Tonga from losing to Randy and Kevin Owens at Backlash a couple of months ago. Since then, he must have been in Randy’s hitlist.

However, the BCCI remains steadfast in its policy of maintaining an all-Indian support staff for the national team, a practice that has been in place for the past seven years.According to a report by the Hindustan Times, the BCCI is not inclined to hire foreign personnel for the support staff. This decision comes as India transitions to a new coaching regime following the completion of the tenures of previous head coach Rahul Dravid and his support staff, which included batting coach Vikram Rathour, bowling coach Paras Mhambrey, and fielding coach T Dilip, post the T20 World Cup.As per the same HT report, Gambhir’s proposal for R Vinay Kumar as the bowling coach was also reportedly not supported by the board.Additionally, there were earlier reports from Cricbuzz about Gambhir advocating for the inclusion of former Netherlands international Ryan ten Doeschate in his support staff.

However, just before the 41-year-old Anderson walked out to a standing ovation from the packed crowd at Lord's, Mikyle Louis executed a brilliant run out to dismiss Shoaib Bashir, triggering exuberant celebrations among the West Indies players.As a result, when Anderson emerged from the pavilion, only former West Indies skipper Jason Holder was present to greet him with a handshake.At stumps on the second day, the West Indies trailed by 171 runs with only four wickets remaining, making it almost certain that this was Anderson's final innings with the bat for England.""We spoke about it before he came out to bat, that we were going to give him a guard of honour,"" West Indies fast bowler Jayden Seales was quoted by AFP.""Obviously the run out took us all the way down to Swiss Cottage (the neighbouring district in northwest London to St John's Wood, in which Lord's is located), so it was pretty hard to do the guard of honour for the great man. Luckily, Jason caught up with him.""However, as it turned out, Anderson had to return to the dressing room without even facing a ball as debutant Jamie Smith (70) was dismissed as the last England wicket to fall.""I think the biggest missed opportunity was not seeing Jimmy face one off their left-arm spinner,"" said Smith.""That's the one regret about my innings. I'm a bit disappointed I couldn't hit one more six to allow him his moment. It's been an honour to play alongside him in my first game. Everyone will miss him when he goes. If we're in a position where he has to bat in the second innings, I'd be a bit worried, so hopefully he can get wickets with the ball instead.""Anderson, England captain Ben Stokes and newcomer Gus Atkinson each claimed two wickets as the West Indies crumbled to 79 for 6 by the end of play on Thursday.

All that is laudable but they should never lose sight that there is a winner and a loser and losing isn’t much fun.""Test match cricket is not an exhibition.

Harsdeep Singh | A Rising Force in Cricket | Ramiz Speaks

Left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh ended the T20 World Cup 2024 as the joint highest wicket-taker with 17 wickets, the same as Afghanistan's Fazalhaq Farooqi; but it's the Indian fast bowler's willingness to learn and hold his nerves under pressure that has earned him a lot of praise and respect from cricket experts and former players.India won the T20 World Cup with an eight-match unbeaten run.Rohit Sharma and his boys defeated South Africa in the final on June 29 in Barbados, a game that went down the wire as the Indian bowlers scripted a thrilling comeback win by seven runs.Part of that comeback story was Arshdeep's bowling, as the left-armer delivered the penultimate over and gave away just four runs to finish with a spell of 2 for 20.While 'Player of the Tournament' Jasprit Bumrah (15 wickets) remained the go-to bowler for his captain, former Pakistan skipper Ramiz Raja feels that Arshdeep is learning the trade from Bumrah without getting overawed by his stature as the world's best and the spearhead of Indian bowling.""All the bowlers in India's attack played their role (in the T20 World Cup victory), some got hit but most of them delivered good performances with their tight bowling and cleverness on flat tracks that test you bowling quality, credibility and credentials. On that note, the name that first comes up is that of Arshdeep Singh,"" Raja said on his YouTube channel 'Ramiz Speaks'.""Bumrah ke hote hue, ye craft seekh bhi rahe hain, par unse dab nahi rahe hain (with Bumrah there, Arshdeep is learning from him and not feeling the pressure because of Bumrah's presence). It's very important for him to back himself and prove that he is at par with Bumrah, if not better than him. So to challenge himself that way is very important for Arshdeep's growth, because if he will compete with the world's best bowler, then his own bowling will touch the sky,"" the former Pakistan batsman, who was part of the 1992 ODI World Cup-winning team, said.Ramiz was particularly impressed with Arshdeep's willingness to learn and not let the pressure get to him.""He comes on to bowl in do-or-die situations (death overs), like if he doesn't deliver, the team will lose and he might be out of the squad. But he bowls cleverly and to his field, when to bowl length balls, slower balls, can bowl the slower bouncer as well. So he offers a lot of advantage to his team,"" said the 62-year-old, who has also served as the chairman of Pakistan Cricket Board.The development of Indian pace-bowling unit into one of the world's best has been the story of the past decade in world cricket, and the resources in Indian domestic circuit continue to improve. For Ramiz, Arshdeep is an example of that.""The important thing about Indian circuit is that we are witnessing improvement in skill level every six months, not that they fall apart or the performance dips. The skill level is going up and there is a willingness to learn. That's an important element you see in Arshdeep's bowling,"" he concluded.",India won the T20 World Cup with an eight-match unbeaten run. Left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh ended the tournament as the joint highest wicket-taker with 17 wickets.

""The BEST batter I have faced in my career is..."" 😮 | James Anderson Fan Q&A

NEW DELHI: Seasoned England fast bowler James Anderson , who is set to retire from Test cricket after the match against the West Indies at Lord's, praised legendary Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar as the greatest opponent he has ever bowled against.With 188 Test matches under his belt, he stands second on the list of players with the most appearances, after Tendulkar (200) in the longest format of the game.With an impressive tally of 700 wickets from 187 matches, Anderson currently holds the third spot on the list of highest wicket-takers in Test history.This final match also presents him with an opportunity to surpass legendary spinner Shane Warne's record of 708 wickets.During a Q&A session on Sky Sports Cricket , the 41-year-old pacer was asked about the best batter he has faced throughout his remarkable career.Interestingly, Anderson overlooked many contemporary stars, instead naming Indian legend as the most formidable batter he has encountered.""The best batter I would have to say is Sachin Tendulkar,"" Anderson stated.Having played 39 Tests against India, Anderson has claimed a total of 149 wickets, dismissing Tendulkar on nine occasions.When questioned about the best bowler he has faced, Anderson acknowledged the prowess of Australia's Glenn McGrath and South Africa's Dale Steyn .""The best bowler I faced probably Glenn McGrath or Dale Steyn. Hard to pick between the two. Slightly different bowlers, but both world-class,"" he remarked.Reflecting on his career, England's all-time leading wicket-taker in Tests singled out his dismissal of former Australian captain Michael Clarke in the 2013 Trent Bridge Test as his most memorable wicket. However, when it came to the achievement he takes the most pride in, Anderson surprisingly chose his batting performance.""Career achievement I am most proud of his getting 81 at Trent Bridge against India. I know, I probably should pick a wicket or bowling performance, but getting 81 with the bat, I think, it is just something I still can't believe I have done,"" he shared.","James Anderson is set to retire from Test cricket after the match against the West Indies at Lord's.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's captain Babar Azam has been facing constant criticism following the team's disappointing performances at the ODI and T20 World Cups.While in the ODI World Cup last year in India, Pakistan failed to qualify for the semis, in the recently concluded T20 World Cup in the Americas, Babar and Co. didn't even make it to the Super 8 stage.At the recent ICC's cricketing extravaganza, Babar, the batter, failed as well as he managed a lowly 122 runs in 4 group-stage matches.However, all-rounder Hassan Ali on Thursday came to his defence, expressing his unwavering support for the embattled batsman. In an interview with Cricket Pakistan on YouTube, Hassan defended Babar Azam while hailing the under-fire batsman as ""the King of Pakistan"".""I have certainly noticed how much abuse I've been receiving since that day for saying 'king kar lega' (the king will do it). He is my king, he is the king of Pakistan cricket , and he will always remain so because of the kind of batsman he is. I know maybe people will abuse me again and speak ill of me. But he is the best batsman of Pakistan, and he has proved it,"" he said.""I know he hasn’t won anything, and he should win as a captain. He should win trophies and series for Pakistan. But he is the best,"" he added.Hasan also pointed out that the 'Fab Four', consisting of Virat Kohli , Kane Williamson , Steve Smith, and Joe Root , became the ' Fab Five ' with the emergence of Babar.""He is the king of Pakistan’s batting lineup. He has performed everywhere, except in India where we went once last year and he didn’t score a hundred there (in the World Cup). You must have heard of the 'Fab Four', and now because of Babar Azam, it's the 'Fab Five'. Babar Azam is that fifth player. So Babar Azam has improved, and he is the best. I still stand by that statement,"" added Hassan.Amid Babar's poor run with the bat during the T20 World Cup 2024, Pakistan made an early exit from the tournament. This included an upset loss against USA and a defeat to arch-rivals India in the group stage.","Babar Azam has been facing constant criticism following Pakistan's disappointing performances at the ODI and T20 World Cups.

Euro 2024: Why Germany's labour law is prohibiting Lamine Yamal to play for 90 minutes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/uefa-euro-2024/euro-2024-why-germanys-labour-law-is-prohibiting-lamine-yamal-to-play-for-90-minutes/articleshow/111666779.cms,"Top Picks For You Lamine Yamal: The youngest player to score a goal in Euro finals

NEW DELHI: Lamine Yamal , that 16-year-old Barcelona star, has taken the Football world by fire. It seems that whatever he does becomes a record or breaks the one. The moment he took the field for Spain against Croatia, Yamal became the youngest player ever to play in the European Championship, aged 16 years and 338 days.Moments later he set another record by providing an assist to Dani Carvajal in Spain's 3-0 win against Croatia, becoming the youngest player ever to assist in Euro, although he didn't score in the match.But eventually, he would score.In the semi-final, France took the early lead against Spain with Randal Kolo Muani's goal in the eighth minute, thanks to a cross by Kylian Embappe. Spain was lagging when Yamal skillfully trespassed the French defence to score the equalizer. Yamal scored in the 21st minute of the match and added to his name the record of the youngest-ever player to score in Euros.Aged 16 years and 362 days, he broke the previous record of Switzerland player Johan Vonlanthen, who also scored against France, in 2004, at the age of 18 years and 141 days. Spain eventually defeated France 2-1 to enter the final. Spanish coach Luis de la Fuente praised Yamal's goal and described it as ""a touch of genius"".Despite all these achievements, coach Fuente has been finding it hard to play him for the full 90 minutes in Euros. Why? Because it is illegal in Germany, the host nation ofEuro 2024 .As per the labour law of Germany, minors are not allowed to work beyond 8 pm. Although there's some relaxation for athletes but even for them the deadline is 11 pm. While Spain's quarterfinal against Germany kicked off at 6 pm, many of their matches so far, including the semi-final against France, began at 9 pm German time. Given the 90 minutes of regulation time along with the injury time in each half, 15 minutes of break, and the post-match interviews, it would have pushed the Yamal to work beyond 11 pm.Due to German labour law, the Spanish coach was forced to sub-off Yamal in group stage matches at the 86th minute, 71st minute, and 19th minute in matches against Croatia, Italy, and Albania, respectively. If Yamal works (plays) beyond 11 PM then the Spanish FA will be fined 30,000 euros.Yamal featured for the entire duration of the match in the round of 16 match against Georgia where Spain emerged victorious with a scoreline of 4-1. However, this potentially puts the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in a position where they could face a penalty amounting to approximately $32,500. The uncertainty lies in whether the German authorities impose the fine on the RFEF or not.Interestingly, the Euro 2024 final on Monday is also scheduled to kick off at 9 pm German time, as three-time champions Spain is set to take on Harry Kane-led England. He will be, almost certainly, part of the starting XI but whether he will be subbed off or not is the question that looms large.The young Spanish winger is set to celebrate his 17th birthday just one day before the Euro 2024 final. Spain has the option to substitute him for the second half of the match. However, if they choose not to make this substitution, they can face significant legal consequences under German law.The decision to keep Yamal on the field for the entire game would result in a substantial financial penalty for the Spanish team. However, if Spain manages to secure the victory, the coaching staff and management will consider the money well spent.","Lamine Yamal, 16, is the youngest player ever to play in the European Championship.

Musetti, 6 ft 1', is slightly built, and has wheels that are both fast and sturdy.If the world No.25's win over Taylor Fritz in the quarterfinals on Wednesday, putting him in the last-four of a Grand Slam for the first time in his career, is any indication of the mental miles he may have covered in recent weeks, expect a cracker of a last-four clash against the seven-time champion Novak Djokovic on Friday.In the first of the last-four clashes -defending champion Carlos Alcaraz goes up against Daniil Medvedev in a replay of their US Open semifinals last September.Musetti trails Djokovic 1-5 in head-to-head clashes, their rivalry (so far) bookended by their only two meetings in majors, both at Roland Garros , and on both occasions Musetti going down in five-sets without winning a game in the deciding set. The first time was three years ago, a teenager then, he retired from the match (when trailing 0-4 in the fifth set) and again last month in the third round after Musetti had taken the second and third sets.The Italian was in a similar situation against Fritz, leading by two-sets-to-one. The American fell back 0-40 in the fifth game of the fourth set, where Musetti had four chances to break, but came up short.The Italian media groaned in unison, they had seen this before. In his box his long-time coach Simone Tartarini could hardly believe all that was playing out before him.Musetti was doing a Musetti again. Until he undid it in a stirring fifth set where he lost just 13 points. The 22-year-old's Roland Garros third-round match against Djokovic finished at 3 am. ""I had my chances. I didn't take the chances, especially in the fourth where I was leading,"" Musetti said at Wimbledon, some 40 days later. ""I have analyzed that match, the key moments and where I could do better. I put myself in that position again. In the past weeks, I started to feel more continuous with that attitude.""In his two grasscourt events before Wimbledon Musetti made the semifinal in Stuttgart and final at Queen's Club. ""Even against Fritz I have that attitude, especially after losing the first set where I didn't feel my serve really well. I didn't feel the ball. I was a little bit nervous,"" he said.""Then immediately with a positive attitude I changed my mindset, and also the feeling with the ball was better.""The Italian's victory over Fritz has given him a 4-6 win-loss record in five-set matches.""I've had many, many tough losses (at Grand Slams). Especially in the French Open ,"" he said. ""The losses made me think, made me work harder.""""With Djokovic, I always finished the match with a lesson,"" Musetti said. ""Against him you are probably more stressed because he's probably the best player ever or one of the best players ever. If I play in a certain way, I could have my shot in the next round.""",Lorenzo Musetti will play Novak Djokovic in the Wimbledon last four. The 22-year-old Italian beat Taylor Fritz in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. Carlos Alcaraz faces Daniil Medvedev in a replay of their US Open semifinals last September.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111675486,imgsize-44986,width-400,resizemode-4/111675486.jpg"
Wimbledon: Jasmine Paolini outlasts Donna Vekic to reach second consecutive Grand Slam final,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon/wimbledon-jasmine-paolini-outlasts-donna-vekic-to-reach-second-consecutive-grand-slam-final/articleshow/111675292.cms,"LONDON: Jasmine Paolini sprinted across the lawn and chased down a drop shot midway through the Wimbledon semifinal. Donna Vekic replied with a heavily spun topspin lob. The Italian had no business getting to the ball, she was almost kissing the net cord when she turned and charged back to the baseline. Racket on ball, she got it over the net. Vekic, whose forehand was calling the shots until that point, thumped the ball wide.Centre Court gasped.There was a hint of a smile on Paolini's expressive face, a reminder perhaps to never count her out. Vekic, hands on hips, also smiled, but for a whole different reason.That right there - with the sun casting a glow on SW19 for the second successive afternoon - was where the first of the ladies' semifinals turned. An extraordinary contest, where every nook and corner of the court was used and covered. Lines met angles and power met poise.Paolini, the No. 7 seed, stopped the inspired run of Vekic, 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (8) in two hours and 51 minutes in the longest women's singles match in Wimbledon history.Paolini, the first Italian woman to reach the Wimbledon final in the Open Era, and the first player to reach the final at Roland Garros and the Championships in the same year since Serena Williams in 2016, will play the winner of the Elena Rybakina-Barbora Krecjikova clash in the title match on Saturday.What turned the three-hour affair into gripping cinema was the back stories of these two women, both 28 years of age.Some of the shots Vekic hit, you could see a lifetime's work on it. The RPMs were singing. On the other side, Paolini's resolve shone brighter than the sun, while her craft sparkled.They have both loved and lived, had their hearts broken and wills tested. Vekic's body was so bruised and beaten that two months ago she was seriously considering walking away from the sport. The Croat made her first Grand Slam semifinal in her 43rd major, after losing in the first round 20 times. Paolini, 5'4"", had lost in the first round of her three previous Wimbledon main draw appearances, earlier she had fallen in the qualifiers thrice. It wasn't until January, in Australia, that she had made the second week of a Grand Slam.The semifinal then stood for everything women's sport stands for - titanic ability, physical and mental; pulsating power, lightning speed, resilience. And an unbendable steel.Vekic, clearly injured, and struggling to motor on, sobbed. Paolini screamed 'forza'.Then, when it was all over, the seventh seed led the Centre Court applause as Vekic walked off the court.""It was really tough today, she played unbelievable. She was hitting winners everywhere, I was struggling at the beginning, but I told myself to fight for every ball. I'm so happy with this win,"" Paolini said. She then added with a smile, ""This match I will remember forever."" She is not alone.",Jasmine Paolini beats Donna Vekic in three sets in Wimbledon semifinal. Paolini is the first Italian woman to reach Wimbledon final in the Open Era. She will play the winner of Elena Rybakina-Barbora Krecjikova clash on Saturday.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111675269,imgsize-42084,width-400,resizemode-4/111675269.jpg"
Jasmine Paolini beats Donna Vekic in nearly three-hour-long Wimbledon semi-final,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon/jasmine-paolini-beats-donna-vekic-in-nearly-three-hour-long-wimbledon-semi-final/articleshow/111667922.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Wimbledon women's semi-final match between the seventh seed Jasmine Paolini and Donna Vekic was a gruelling encounter that lasted for 2 hours and 51 minutes, making it the longest women's semi-final in the history of the All England Club.The match showcased the resilience, determination, and endurance of both players as they battled for a spot in the final against either Barbora Krejcikova or the defending champion, Elena Rybakina .In her on-court interview, Paolini acknowledged the intensity of the match and expressed her gratitude for the opportunity to compete at such a prestigious event.""These last months have been crazy for me. I am trying to focus on what I have to do on court and I love playing tennis . It is amazing to be here and it is a dream. I think it was an intense match and I tried to play my best and now it's time to recover. I think I need an ice bath as my legs are a little bit tired,"" Paolini said after the win, as quoted by Reuters.Vekic, playing in her first major semi-final, started strongly by claiming the opening set 6-2. Her combination of groundstrokes and well-timed dropshots proved too much for Paolini, who was a surprise finalist at the recent French Open.However, Paolini, buoyed by the vocal support of the Italian contingent in the crowd, became more aggressive in the second set, approaching the net more frequently and putting Vekic on the defensive. Her perseverance paid off as she broke Vekic's serve to level the match at one set apiece.The decider was a rollercoaster ride, with both players exchanging breaks and committing numerous unforced errors, particularly Vekic, who appeared fatigued and emotional as the match progressed. The Croatian was visibly distraught after saving Paolini's first match point and broke down in tears during a changeover following a successful challenge by Paolini that overturned a line call.Despite the emotional turmoil, Vekic rallied to save another match point and force a tiebreak. However, Paolini, who appeared as energized as she did at the start of the match, prevailed in the tiebreak to secure her second successive Grand Slam final appearance.The Italian's victory was a testament to her mental fortitude and physical endurance, as both players covered more than 3.5 kilometers during the epic encounter.","Jasmine Paolini beats Donna Vekic in epic Wimbledon women's semi-final. The match lasted 2 hours and 51 minutes, making it the longest women's semis in history. Paolini will face Barbora Krejcikova or defending champion Elena Rybakina in the final.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111668061,imgsize-39322,width-400,resizemode-4/111668061.jpg"
Wimbledon: Elena Rybakina ends Elina Svitolina run,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon/wimbledon-elena-rybakina-ends-elina-svitolina-run/articleshow/111650467.cms,"Kazakh crushes Svitolina in last 8, to face Krejcikova in semis

LONDON: For the first time, in what seemed like forever, the Centre Court roof was open. There was a steady stream of light, even though a cold drift blowing across the grounds made jumpers and jackets the go-to armor of the day. Brollies were temporarily binned. Later in the afternoon, as the sun made a reappearance at Wimbledon , Elena Rybakina 's point-precise play in the quarterfinals lent to the sharpness of the moment.The fourth-seed, champion here in 2022, had 28 winners in her 6-3, 6-2 victory over the world No.21 Elina Svitolina . In the semifinals on Thursday, Rybakina plays the No.31 seed Czech Barbora Krejcikova , who rallied from 1-4 in the second set to reach her first semifinal at SW19 with a 6-4, 7-6 (4) win over the heavy-hitting 13th seed Jelena Ostapenko.Rybakina, who likes to keep her exchanges short on and off the court, improved her impressive record at Wimbledon to 19-2 in main-draw matches. ""I'm staying really aggressive from the first shots. On the baseline I was playing pretty well and felt the ball good. I think my return has improved,"" Rybakina said of her play.""The serve is helping me, even though today maybe not a high percentage, but in important moments, I served it out."" Rybakina, who is tied with the world No.1 Iga Swiatek (seven, excluding the United Cup) for the joint-most WTA-level semifinals, said she was better prepared for the later stages of a major than she was two years ago. ""Back then I was not expecting to be that far in the draw.""Now with all the experience and with the time which has passed I want to be in this stage of the tournament,"" she said. ""I'm much more experienced and know what to do."" It's a different kind of nerves for the Kazakh now. ""Every time you go on the court there are nerves. This is still the same,"" the Moscow-born 25-year-old said. ""But I'm managing that much better than before.""In 2022 I was definitely more nervous than now. It was the first time for me to play on Centre Court. It was a lot of people, a lot of attention. Now, of course, I got used to it a little bit. I'm taking these matches in a different way.""Rybakina, who has the most aces served at the Championships in women's draw this year (31 -tied with Lulu Sun), trails Krejcikova 0-2 in head-to-head clashes, having lost twice on hard courts (in 2021 & 2022).In the first of the women's semifinals, seventh-seeded Jasmine Paolini will take on the battling Croat Donna Vekic, ranked some 30 places below her, in a battle of shot makers.","Elena Rybakina beats Elina Svitolina 6-3, 6-2 to reach Wimbledon semifinals.
