Why Taylor Swift might formally step away from her godmother role

How Travis Kelce’s relationship might play into Taylor Swift’s public positioning

The drama surrounding Taylor Swift ’s personal life is showing no signs of slowing down. The pop superstar, currently in the spotlight for her high-profile romance with NFL star Travis Kelce , is now reportedly planning a formal move to sever ties with actress Blake Lively . The alleged decision comes amid growing tension following the ongoing legal battle over the Colleen Hoover adaptation It Ends With Us...According to Radar Online, an insider revealed that pop sensation Taylor Swift feels compelled to “draw a line” in her fractured friendship with Lively. The source explained, “Taylor feels she has no choice but to draw a line. Their friendship collapsed months ago and she doesn't want blurred obligations lingering. That includes her godmother role.”The report claims that Swift is seriously considering delivering a formal notice, possibly through a mutual friend or lawyer, to clarify her intention of stepping back from the role..For years, Swift was closely connected with Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds’ family, even mentioning their children—James, Inez, and Betty—in her critically acclaimed folklore album. Their public appearances together had always made headlines, signaling a tight bond.However, that camaraderie seems to have unraveled amid the complicated legal war involving Lively and Justin Baldoni, during which Swift was unexpectedly dragged into the controversy.There were earlier reports that Swift would be subpoenaed, though that has since been dropped, and conflicting claims arose that Lively had threatened to expose private texts, which her legal team denied as “categorically false. ”Swift’s engagement to Travis Kelce has already generated massive media buzz, and distancing herself from the Blake Lively-Ryan Reynolds drama may also be part of a broader strategy to focus on her own narrative. The insider noted, “This goes beyond the question of a wedding invite. It's about setting limits. Taylor doesn’t want the godmother role hanging over her or being used against her.”Also Read: “Deeply wounded”: As Taylor Swift plans her wedding to Travis Kelce, Blake Lively faces exclusion after legal feud As this situation continues to develop, it remains a rumor.

Caleb Williams finally explains the real reason behind his painted nails and why fans shouldn’t be surprised,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/caleb-williams-finally-explains-the-real-reason-behind-his-painted-nails-and-why-fans-shouldnt-be-surprised/articleshow/123797548.cms,"Why Caleb Williams’ painted nails reveal more about his personality than his performance on the field (Via X/NFL)

Caleb Williams finds inspiration in his mom’s craft



Caleb Williams stays true despite criticism and setbacks



In the NFL, QBs are often celebrated for their passing accuracy, leadership, and ability to command the field. Yet, Chicago Bears’ star Caleb Williams has added something else to the mix—authentic self-expression. The No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft has become as well known for his bold personality and painted nails as he has for his rocket arm. For Williams, it’s more than fashion—it’s family, confidence, and staying true to who he is.Caleb Williams’ nail-painting ritual traces back to high school, when his mother’s career as a nail technician inspired him to experiment. “It started, I would say, three years ago,” Williams explained in a 2023 USC Athletics interview. “My mom does nails. Let’s just start it off there. She’s done it my whole life. It’s just kind of always been around me. Nobody else does it. I just kinda like to do new things.”What began as a personal nod to his mother soon became part of his game-day identity. From his debut in the 2024 regular season to several games afterward, Williams sported painted nails, instantly sparking conversation across the league. He’s not just comfortable standing out—he embraces it.Whether sitting courtside at NBA games in bold outfits or leading his team on Sundays, Williams carries the same message: confidence has no rules.Interestingly, his painted nails became linked to an odd statistic. According to OutSports, the Bears started 4-3 in games where Williams wore nail polish but lost seven straight once he stopped. While the connection is almost certainly coincidental, it added to the superstition and chatter surrounding the quarterback’s unique style.Williams’ rookie season wasn’t without struggles. Chicago endured a tough 10-game losing streak, and the quarterback faced relentless pressure, being sacked 68 times. In the midst of it, he briefly stopped painting his nails, focusing instead on regaining momentum. “I was trying to figure out how to get things back on track,” he admitted to ESPN. The pressure, he acknowledged, became “a little tiring at the end.”But the story didn’t end there. By the offseason, Williams had returned to his signature look, refusing to let outside opinions dictate his choices. “It doesn’t bother me,” he said of critics. “I’m not going to apologize.” For him, the ritual isn’t about gimmicks—it’s about identity. “It’s just me being myself,” he emphasized, describing his expression as “unapologetic.”As the Bears prepare for the 2025 season, Williams’ painted nails stand as a symbol of resilience and individuality. Whether it helps his win-loss record or not, one thing is certain—Caleb Williams will continue rewriting what it means to be a modern NFL quarterback.Also Read: Josh Allen turns Sunday night into must-see TV as Bills vs. Ravens pulls jaw-dropping 24.7 million viewers","Caleb Williams is the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft.

Travis Hunter set to become Jacksonville Jaguars’ superstar

Travis Hunter, who was the Jacksonville Jaguars' second overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, had an instant impact during his first NFL game in September 2025 against the Carolina Panthers in Jacksonville, Florida. Although the Jaguars won 26–10, Hunter's efforts made the headlines. Hunter logged at least five catches and five defensive snaps in his first game, becoming the first player in 20 years. With six catches for 33 yards and six defensive snaps, he showed his particular capacity to aid on both attack and defense. Already, fans and experts are speculating on his chances of being a league icon.Travis Hunter's first showing was legendary as he performed effectively on both sides. Catching six passes for 33 yards, wide receiver helped the Jaguars stay competitive. Hunter played six snaps at cornerback defensively, demonstrating great coverage despite limited exposure.He is now the only player in the last two decades to have at least five catches and five defensive snaps in a single game, CBS Sports claims.Jaguars head coach Doug Pederson praised Hunter after the game, saying,Analysts also noted that playing cornerback is one of the toughest jobs in football, second only to quarterback, and Hunter’s ability to step in and perform shows remarkable versatility.While Travis Hunter showed promise, experts say it is still early to call him one of the league’s best. Wide receiver seems like his strongest position, while cornerback remains a question mark due to the limited snaps.The Jaguars, however, are already realizing his worth. Hunter is a distinctive asset in the NFL since he may influence games both offensively and defensively. Travis Hunter and the Jacksonville Jaguars will next week play the Cincinnati Bengals.Fans will be keenly watching to see if Hunter can keep going with his legendary beginning. Should he continue to play like this, he might become among the most prominent stars in the league in the following years.","Travis Hunter was the Jacksonville Jaguars' second overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft.

Isaiah Foskey expected to sign with Bengals after short stint with Saints: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/isaiah-foskey-expected-to-sign-with-bengals-after-short-stint-with-saints-report/articleshow/123789592.cms,"Isaiah Foskey (Image Source: Getty)

Isaiah Foskey faced challenges during his time with the Saints



Isaiah Foskey could thrive in Cincinnati under familiar coaching



“4-3 defensive end with future starting potential”

Former Saints second-round pick Isaiah Foskey, who visits with the Bears today and the Eagles earlier, is headed to the Bengals, per reports by NFL reporter Jordan Schultz. Foskey, coming out of Notre Dame, was a disruptive player in college, but he struggled to replicate that success in the NFL. He now has a new chance in Cincinnati, and a chance to work with a familiar coaching staff; it might just be then that he finds the right environment to realize that talent.Foskey played at a high level at Notre Dame. He was drafted 40th overall in the 2023 NFL Draft and entered the league as he left the school. During that time, his name at the top of the sack list. But perhaps more disappointing than his tweener status was that his two years in New Orleans weren't marked by many snaps on defense. He produced poorly with no sacks to show for his efforts.Foskey had just under 84 defensive snaps as a rookie and found even less opportunity in his sophomore campaign. He had minimal impact, though he did play special teams, and was released during final cuts this year.Foskey’s NFL start is hardly ringing the bell for the Bengals to give up on him. They've had interest in him all offseason, and it finally resulted in the signing that was assumed. In particular, Foskey spent his last season of college football playing for Al Golden, the Bengals' new defensive coordinator, in a rare twist of consistency that could help Foskey grow. Foskey has been seen by analysts as aif he can work on his techniques as a pass rusher and improve his hands.Also Read: Chad ‘Ochocinco’ Johnson prioritizes gaming over sex if Bengals don’t win the Super Bowl If he finally ends up on the Bengals' 53-man roster, Foskey would factor into a rotation that includes Shemar Stewart, Joseph Ossai, Myles Murphy, and one more ex-Saints pass rusher, Trey Hendrickson. The addition is a low-risk, high-reward opportunity for Cincinnati, allowing the organization an opportunity to mold a still-long athlete yet to reach his football ceiling. For Foskey, it is a new beginning in a scheme and with a staff that already has familiarity with him.","Former Saints second-round pick Isaiah Foskey is headed to the Bengals.

Xavier Worthy, one of the most talented players in the league, has had a tough time with his ex fiancée, Tia Jones, earlier this year, after he ended up suing her.

He’s rehabbing and working his shoulder.

The prize for winning a gold medal is $70,000, but many people in track and field say this is not enough money anymore. Fans, experts, and athletes feel upset because the prize money has barely gone up in ten years, even when prices around us have climbed a lot. They say champions like Lyles and Richardson deserve more for all their hard work.Noah Lyles won big titles in the 100 m and 200 m before coming to Tokyo. Sha’Carri Richardson is the defending 100 m champion. World Athletics says the prize pool for this championship is $8.498 million, with $70,000 for gold, $35,000 for silver, and $22,000 for bronze.But people are not happy. A big reason is that the 2025 Diamond League will pay over $9 million, showing just how much more athletes can earn there.Olympic medalist and expert Rori Dunk shared a clear example. In 2015, gold medals paid $60,000. Now in 2025, they pay $70,000. If you add inflation, that should be about $81,778. So the prize has actually lost value.

NEW DELHI: Indian cricketer Shreyas Iyer has revealed the extent of the back injury that nearly ended his career, disclosing that he suffered paralysis in one leg before making a successful return to the sport. The setback also cost him a place in the BCCI’s central contract list.Two years ago, Iyer was hospitalised in England as his condition worsened, surviving on painkillers and cortisol injections while his spine and hip deteriorated.“No one can understand the pain I went through. I was totally paralysed in one leg. With spine surgery, you can place a rod in the back and still manage. But a snapped nerve, which is what I had, is really, really dangerous,” Iyer told GQ India.The batsman recalled how the pain shot “all the way down to my tiny toe,” calling the experience “horrendous and scary.”After surgery, Iyer needed a full year to recover, during which he slipped out of the central contract list.“People see athletes as robots who must perform every game. They don’t know what’s happening behind the scenes,” he said.Recently, Iyer’s omission from India’s Asia Cup squad raised eyebrows, especially after he emerged as Punjab Kings’ top scorer in IPL 2025.“I can only control the controllable. I’ll keep working on my skills and strength, and when the opportunity arises, I’ll grab it with both hands,” he added.His journey highlights not just the physical toll of elite sport, but also the resilience required to fight back.",Indian cricketer Shreyas Iyer reveals extent of back injury that nearly ended his career.

Suryakumar Yadav press conference: 'I will message you Playing XI', and more on India preparations

NEW DELHI: There’s an old video of Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma doing the rounds. In it, Abhishek on his Instagram Live asks Gill, “Fans are asking, who is your girlfriend?” Shubman replies, “Aawaaz nahi aa rahi (Your voice is breaking).” To this, Abhishek mischievously says, “Ab toh awaaz nahi hi aayegi (Now, you obviously won’t be able to hear me!). ”The conversation is aptly explained by Arun Bedi, former Punjab cricketer, who saw Gill and Abhishek right from their U-14 days for Punjab.“Ek shaant hai and dusra shaitaan (One is shy, whereas the other is naughty),” Bedi tells TimesofIndia.com.Come Wednesday, Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma will walk out to open for India against the UAE in the Asia Cup that got underway on Tuesday. It won’t be the first time — the duo have been opening since their U-14 days. Bedi shares one of the anecdotes about them when Shubman and Abhishek were 13 and 12, respectively.“Earlier, there used to be a Dhruv Pandove Trophy for U-14 players. Only North Zone teams - Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, J&K, and Himachal - used to play in it. Both of them played for the first time under my coaching. Abhishek Sharma was the captain and Shubman Gill was the vice-captain. Our tournament was in Una, Himachal Pradesh.Abhishek was the Man of the Series and Punjab won the tournament. We defeated Delhi in the final,” says Bedi.“In the league match against Himachal Pradesh, it was a two-day game. HP took a 10-run lead with five-or-six wickets in hand, and it was around Tea on Day 2. Maine in dono ko kaha ab toh haar jayenge (I told them, 'we’re going to lose').“After Tea, they came to me and said, sir kaise haar jayenge (Sir, how can we lose?),” he recalls.Bedi takes a pause and laughs before continuing.“First over after Tea, Abhishek took a wicket. The duo riled up the Punjab boys and they bowled and fielded with aggression. We ended up taking the rest of the wickets, and the target we got was around 90. We needed to chase it down in 10 overs and these two got us home inside seven overs.""Mai hairaan tha. itni choti umar mey ye aisa soch rahe (I was amazed — at such a young age, they were thinking like this).”After the match, Bedi called up Lakhwinder Gill and Rajkumar Sharma - fathers of Shubman and Abhishek - and told them their boys were special and would play for India one day.The duo did end up playing for India. And it was not only Bedi who predicted it, but also Late Desh Prem Azad, coach of Kapil Dev.“In the coming time, the two boys from Punjab who will represent India are going to be Abhishek and Shubman,” Desh Prem Azad’s voice still echoes in Rajkumar Sharma’s ears.“Dono captain bhi ban sakte hai (Both can even go on to become captains).“Jab bhi inki batting dekhta hun ye extraordinary nazar aate hai (Whenever I watch them bat, they look extraordinary). I can never forget his blessings,” he reminisces.Beyond opening partners, they have been childhood friends and understand each other’s game as well.Abhishek Sharma’s obsession with Shubman’s bat is well known. Abhishek scored his maiden T20I century with Shubman’s bat in Zimbabwe in 2024. “Whenever I need runs, I ask for his bat,” Abhishek had said.Meanwhile, Shubman in one of his interviews had revealed how once they had a big fight over the issue.“It actually started back in our U-16 days. Abhishek began playing with my bat — there’s a story behind it. He was batting on 80 or 90 runs using my match bat, and I didn’t want it to break, so I asked him to return it. We ended up having a bit of a fight over that! But whenever he asked for my bat, I always gave it to him — and he scored a lot of runs with it,” Gill had said in an interview with JioHotstar.Bedi says Abhishek was obsessed with Shubman’s bat and the current India Test captain used to take credit for all the runs he would score. “Sir, saare runs mere count hone chahiye. Khud ke bat se run nahi aate iske (His runs should be counted in my name, as he can’t score with his own bat!),” Bedi acknowledged.The duo were roommates right from their U-14 days and had a pre-match ritual. They used to crave pizzas and would gorge on the Italian dish before every game.In the same Instagram video where Abhishek teases Gill about his girlfriend, the current India Test captain had said: “Right from U-16 days and even in the U-19 days, we used to have pizzas before every match. It was a superstition. We did this for years. Pizza khao, run banao (Eat pizza and score runs). It used to be our mantra.”Now with diet and fitness in focus, it is unimaginable that the duo share a slice of pizza before their match, but both remain the same. Abhishek’s cheeky birthday post for Shubman’s 26th birthday is a reminder that one is still shy and the other mischievous.“With the bat they are ice and fire. They understand each other’s game so well and I am not surprised at the level they have reached,” Bedi says.","Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma will open for India against the UAE in the Asia Cup. The duo have been childhood friends and understand each other’s game as well. Arun Bedi, former Punjab cricketer, saw them right from their U-14 days for Punjab.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123797200,imgsize-70184,width-400,resizemode-4/shubman-abhishek-1009-s.jpg"

The festive build-up to the 2025 Asia Cup has been clouded by political tensions between India and Pakistan in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack and subsequent cross-border firing. The controversy deepened at Tuesday’s pre-tournament press conference in Dubai, when attention shifted to a handshake between India captain Suryakumar Yadav and Pakistan’s Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi.Early on, social media was abuzz with claims that Surya and Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha had refused to shake hands.However, video footage later disproved the rumours, showing Surya exchanging pleasantries instead with Naqvi, who also serves as PCB chairman and ACC chief, in addition to his political post.Clips of the handshake quickly went viral, fuelling backlash among Indian fans.Naqvi, known for his anti-India rhetoric in media, greeted all captains at the event. But his dual role as a political figure and cricket administrator has made the optics especially controversial.""Pakistan sponsored terrorists killed two of our bravehearts today and the bcci captain has all the smiles on his face while meeting Mohsin Naqvi , PCB Chairman who wanted a nuclear attack on Bharat Mata.

We are sorry to all the jawans. Cricket diplomacy is more important for our nation,” an user wrote.“How can anyone justify smiling while those who harm our people go unchallenged? Innocent lives lost, and here we are… handshakes and smiles. Absolutely shameful,"" another user wrote.“Shame on you Suryakumar Yadav.

NEW DELHI: Former world No. 1 all-rounder Azmatullah Omarzai etched his name in the record books by registering Afghanistan’s fastest T20I fifty during their Asia Cup opener at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium on Tuesday.Put in to bat as favourites, Afghanistan found themselves in trouble at 110/4 with five overs left, as Hong Kong’s bowlers applied pressure. But Omarzai’s arrival at the crease turned the tide. Showcasing his clean hitting, he stunned Hong Kong with a flurry of boundaries and towering shots. His maiden T20I half-century came off just 20 balls, eclipsing Mohammad Nabi’s previous record of 21 deliveries set against Ireland in 2017.In the 19th over, Omarzai dominated Ayush Shukla's bowling. He hit a six over the sightscreen, followed by a shot over deep extra cover. He then sent the third delivery to the mid-wicket boundary.He cleverly guided a full toss to third man for his fifty on the fourth ball. His innings ended at 53 runs from 21 balls when he hit the ball high, caught by Aizaz Khan.Omarzai's impact helped Afghanistan score 78 runs in the final five overs, reaching a total of 188/6.Hong Kong's fielding performance was poor, with five dropped catches, setting a record for most drops in a T20 Asia Cup innings.Opener Sediqullah Atal remained not out with 73 runs from 52 balls, surviving three dropped catches, including one in the first over. The fielding errors and inconsistent bowling in the final overs allowed Afghanistan to build a competitive score.","Azmatullah Omarzai hits fastest T20I fifty in history.

NEW DELHI: Carlos Alcaraz secured his second US Open title and sixth Grand Slam championship by defeating Jannik Sinner on Sunday, earning a record prize money of $5 million . But it would incur significant tax deductions under US laws.The 22-year-old Spanish tennis star's victory, which marked his fourth win over Sinner in five meetings, came with the largest single payout in tennis history, part of the US Open's 20 percent increase in total prize fund for 2025 The historic prize money, however, will be substantially reduced due to US tax regulations. Alcaraz falls into the highest federal income tax bracket of 37% for earnings above $609,351, resulting in approximately $1.7 million in federal taxes.Additional New York state tax at 9.65% on earnings between $1.08 million and $5 million will further reduce his take-home amount to around $2.5 million. These deductions occur before accounting for usual player expenses like paying for his coaches, travel, accommodation and equipment.A tax treaty between Spain and the United States provides some relief for Alcaraz, ensuring he won't face double taxation in his home country.The match itself showcased Alcaraz's dominance, with the Spaniard delivering 42 winners compared to Sinner's 21. His performance included dropping only nine points behind his first serve throughout the match.Sinner managed to claim the second set, marking the only set Alcaraz lost during the entire tournament. However, Alcaraz quickly regained control in the third set, ultimately securing the victory despite Sinner saving two championship points.The victory improved Alcaraz's head-to-head record against Sinner to 10 wins in 15 meetings, including a 4-2 advantage in Grand Slam encounters, with two of these victories coming at the US Open.Both Alcaraz and women's champion Aryna Sabalenka, who defeated Amanda Anisimova in the women's final, received equal prize money of $5 million, representing a 39 percent increase from the previous year's payout.","Carlos Alcaraz secured his second US Open title and sixth Grand Slam championship by defeating Jannik Sinner on Sunday.

Raiders fans top the list in negative social media reactions

Why the backlash matters in sports and celebrity culture

The engagement of NFL superstar Travis Kelce and global pop icon Taylor Swift has become one of the most talked-about celebrity news stories of 2025. But not all the attention has been positive. A recent analysis of social media activity reveals that some NFL fan bases are far from thrilled about the high-profile romance.A trends report from BetOnline.ag studied over 160,000 posts on X (formerly Twitter) following the couple’s engagement announcement. The analysis focused on negative sentiment linked to various NFL team hashtags, and the results were eye-opening. Raiders fans led the pack, posting more than 14,000 critical tweets — the highest of any NFL fan base.Following close behind were Bills Mafia supporters with 12,514 negative posts, and Broncos fans contributing 12,214 critical tweets. Bengals fans came in fourth with 10,783 negative mentions, while 49ers supporters logged 9,142. Notably, Kansas City Chiefs fans had the fewest negative posts, with only 703 tweets, showing strong support for Kelce.The engagement of Kelce and Swift has drawn mixed reactions from sports fans, many of whom appear unsettled by the blending of pop culture and professional football. For Raiders fans, longtime rivals of the Chiefs, the engagement is likely seen as another point of rivalry, especially since Travis Kelce plays for the Kansas City Chiefs.Some fans view the relationship as a media circus rather than a genuine connection, while others express jealousy or frustration over the attention it draws away from the sport itself.Also Read: “Being a mom full-time”: Taylor Swift shared her dream wedding plans 13 years before getting engaged to Travis Kelce This trend highlights a broader cultural tension where celebrity relationships intersect with fandom, causing polarized opinions across social media platforms.

Why Ivanka’s Trump's choice speaks volumes about her personal alliances

Ivanka Trump has long been known for navigating the worlds of business, politics, and high society with ease. But her recent public appearance has raised eyebrows, especially in the midst of the high-profile divorce between supermodel Gisele Bündchen and NFL legend Tom Brady. Rather than staying close to her Trump family circle or maintaining ties with Brady, Ivanka seems to have chosen an unexpected alliance – her close friendship with Bundchen.Photographs recently obtained by DailyMail show Ivanka Trump soaking up the sun in Miami alongside Gisele Bündchen and her boyfriend Joaquim Valente. The trio appeared relaxed and happy, enjoying each other's company away from the public eye. Interestingly, Ivanka skipped the US Open, where many expected her to be alongside her family, and instead opted for this low-key yet high-profile outing.Insiders revealed, “Now, of course, Ivanka is a student at Valente Brothers self-defence in Miami. Gisele and Ivanka have known each other for years, back when Tom Brady used to play golf with Donald Trump. They’re neighbours and both live in Miami’s Indian Creek Island.”It’s clear the friendship runs deep, strengthened by years of proximity and shared social circles in Miami.Ivanka’s decision to maintain close ties with Bündchen rather than Brady is telling. Despite her father, Donald Trump, reportedly having a close relationship with Tom Brady and even attempting to set him up with Ivanka in the past, she seems to have charted her own course. Her preference to align socially with Bundchen highlights a personal choice to separate herself from the political and sports worlds her family is entangled in.Also Read: “It gets him down”: Tom Brady sold his Miami mansion to escape emotional ties to Gisele Bündchen As public interest in celebrity friendships grows, Ivanka Trump’s bond with Gisele Bundchen offers a glimpse into the private alliances shaping today’s social elite – far from political power plays and media scrutiny.",Ivanka Trump seen enjoying time with Gisele Bündchen in Miami.

Eli Manning, special guests, and the big night in Chicago

Peyton Manning, the two-time Super Bowl champion, revealed on Monday night, September 8, 2025, during ESPN2’s “ManningCast,” that he tried to book Pope Leo XIV as a guest for the broadcast. The show aired during the Chicago Bears vs. Minnesota Vikings game at Soldier Field in Chicago. Manning explained that he personally wrote two letters by hand, one to “His Holiness” Pope Leo XIV and another to his executive assistant, inviting him to appear on the popular football broadcast.Speaking in the third quarter of the game, Peyton said, “I tried my hardest… Look at these two hand-written letters I wrote. I wrote his Holiness, himself, and I wrote his executive assistant… I made the effort… and if you’re watching your Holiness, this is an open invitation to come on the show anytime.”Peyton Manning, who co-hosts the program with his brother Eli Manning, compared this failed attempt to his earlier football days. “Kind of like when I failed to recruit Randy Moss to Tennessee, I couldn’t close the Pope. But I made the effort, Eli. And that’s the kind of effort we make here at ESPN2.”Eli Manning laughed as his brother shared the story, while viewers saw the two letters on the screen. Peyton Manning also noted that Pope Leo XIV, who grew up in Chicago and attended Villanova, was on the “most wanted” guest list for the show.Other names on that list include Tiger Woods, Bradley Cooper, President George Bush, and comedian Larry David. Peyton Manning said directly on air, “Y’all are on our most wanted list for the ‘ManningCast.’ Come anytime, we’d love to have you, your Holiness.”Also Read: Eagles Star Jalen Carter Fined $57K And Suspension Served After Spitting On Dak Prescott That night, the broadcast did welcome several other stars.

Dak Prescott reacts as NFL rules no further suspension

“I wasn’t spitting on somebody. I spit a thousand times in a game. I just spit ahead, and it’s unfortunate Jalen didn’t get a chance to play.”

Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter has been fined $57,222 for spitting on Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott during the NFL season opener on Thursday, September 4, 2025, at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia. The incident happened just before the first play of the game. Carter was immediately ejected and did not play a single down. The NFL confirmed the fine is equal to one game check, and the ejection will count as a one-game suspension already served. Carter is eligible to face the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday.The shocking moment unfolded only seconds into the Eagles–Cowboys rivalry game. As players lined up for the opening snap, Jalen Carter walked up to Dak Prescott and spat directly on him.Referees threw a flag for unsportsmanlike conduct and tossed Carter out of the game at once. According to CBS Sports’ Jonathan Jones, this was the fastest ejection in an NFL game since September 12, 2005, when Eagles linebacker Jeremiah Trotter and Atlanta Falcons cornerback Kevin Mathis were removed after a pregame fight.After the Eagles’ 24-20 win, Carter admitted he made a huge mistake. He told reporters,His agent Drew Rosenhaus added in a statement to ESPN that Carter will not appeal the fine and is focusing on Week 2.Dak Prescott later explained he had no intent to disrespect anyone before the play. He said,The NFL and NFL Players Association reviewed the matter and decided the fine plus ejection was enough punishment.That means Jalen Carter will return when the Eagles meet the Kansas City Chiefs. The league hopes this decision sets a strong standard against spitting incidents going forward.","Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter has been fined $57,222 for spitting on Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott.

Sources hint Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce eye lavish $38M spot for their highly anticipated wedding



When will Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s wedding take place?



It will be the biggest American wedding of the 21st century. Now that global music icon Taylor Swift and NFL superstar Travis Kelce are officially engaged, all eyes have shifted toward one question: where and when will the couple tie the knot? While countless details will fuel endless speculation, two outlets—Page Six and Realtor.com—claim to have the answers. And if true, Swift and Kelce’s plans are nothing short of monumental.Reports suggest the couple will exchange vows at Swift’s $38 million oceanfront estate in Westerly, Rhode Island. Known as the “Holiday House,” the 11,000-square-foot mansion offers unmatched privacy, a pristine coastal backdrop, and the kind of logistical control that a global superstar like Swift would require for such a momentous day. Purchased in 2013 for $17.5 million, the home is currently undergoing $1.7 million in renovations, which include a new wing, expanded bedrooms, and an upgraded kitchen—perfect upgrades for a grand celebration.Rhode Island, unlike some European destinations where lavish weddings often draw local backlash, is embracing the possibility of hosting the power couple. Governor Dan McKee even joined the speculation, cheekily reposting the engagement news with a “shifty eyes” emoji, later doing the same when the wedding rumors surfaced. It seems the Ocean State is eager to roll out the red carpet for its most famous residents.The property itself is steeped in history. Once owned by scandalous socialites who allegedly filled the pool with champagne, the estate inspired Swift’s hit “The Last Great American Dynasty.” It has also played host to her legendary July 4th parties, with recent guests including Kelce and his Chiefs teammate Patrick Mahomes.If insider reports hold true, the wedding is slated for next summer. The timing makes sense—warmer months would allow Swift and Kelce to take full advantage of the sprawling oceanfront property and its storied legacy of summer festivities.A superstar with 14 No. 1 albums and a three-time Super Bowl champion uniting in matrimony promises to be more than just a wedding. It will be a cultural moment, the start of what many are already calling America’s new great dynasty.Also Read: Who is Eddy Pineiro?

Frank Bruno, 63, the former heavyweight world champion from Britain, says he feels “really good” now after falling seriously ill during a flight earlier this year. On March 3, 2025, just two hours after leaving London Heathrow Airport for Thailand, Bruno collapsed on board and was rushed to the hospital when the plane landed in Doha, Qatar. Doctors said he had caught a virus and kept him in care for two weeks in Doha before another two weeks of treatment in London.Frank Bruno was traveling to Thailand in March 2025 for four scheduled shows when he suddenly became unwell two hours into the flight. He was described as weak and confused, and on arrival in Doha, airport medical staff placed him in a wheelchair and took him to Al-Wakra Hospital.Speaking later to Matchroom’s Modern Boxing Journal, Bruno recalled, “He remained in hospital in Doha for two weeks, where doctors carried out scans and tests before confirming it was a viral infection. A UK doctor then flew to Qatar and cleared him for travel back to London, where he stayed another two weeks in hospital under close observation.Because of the illness, Frank Bruno was forced to cancel his shows in Pattaya, Bangkok, Hua Hin, and Koh Phangan in Thailand.He also missed an event at Manchester’s Hotel Football and could not attend the British Boxing Awards on March 28, 2025, where he was due to collect a Lifetime Achievement Award.

Let’s gauge through the emotions each of these women went through when they were in a relationship with the Ayahuasca Retreat lover, Aaron Rodgers.Shailene Woodley described her relationship with former Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers in an interview with Melissa Johnson ofMagazine.actress said she had lost herself completely. She said she understood what anxiety and depression truly were. Her stylist, Kris Zero, would try her level best to keep theactress occupied, but she would feel depressed again.“I haven’t shared much about my relationship with Aaron(Rodgers) because it always makes me cry. It was not right. But it was beautiful. I had a really awful, traumatic thing happen in early 2022.I felt like I lost my soul, my self, my happiness, my joy. I really understood depression and anxiety, and like, complete soul detachment.”She chose to remain in a toxic situation because she was empathizing with someone else.“Empathy kind of kept me in this loop of feeling everything for everyone. I knew I was depressed when I looked at a tree and felt nothing. That was the lowest low of my life.”Shailene Woodley’s stylist, Kris Zero, would wake her up with blasting music just to get her out of bed. “Sometimes I was so angry at her. But then we’d go surf, and for ten minutes that day, I thought life could be okay again.Then the depression would come back, and she’d out–We’re volunteering at the horse ranch! – and we’d find a random f*cking horse ranch and we’d clean up horse sh*t.We’d clean hooves and brush the horses, and for 20 minutes that day, I thought like could be okay again. And then depression came back, and she’d wake up the next morning and go–Let’s go on a hike and bring trash bags and clean up trash!”Melissa reported that after about six months, the depression started to fade.Olivia Munn, theactress, appeared on thepodcast, where she talked about a past relationship in which she felt trapped in a tumultuous family dynamic. She said that her therapist encouraged her to stay in the relationship that she wanted to get out of.“I had a therapist who I really loved, and I know that she cared about me, or at least I thought she did. I would constantly, from the very beginning, say–I don’t know about this, I don’t think this is the right(relationship), I want to get out. I gotta get out,” Munn said.Theactress said her therapist encouraged her to stay in that relationship. “She thought that my ‘picker’ was off, and she would look at it as: this person on paper looked great. And when there was couples therapy, they knew how to present the right way. Then the stories I would tell seemed unbelievable.From that experience, learning that I gotta go with my gut and I gotta be decisive with some things if it’s coming from a place where I want to survive, and I realize that I’m not happy, and that days and weeks and months go by of unhappiness and fear.I don’t know if there’s a word to describe what that relationship was like. It was without a doubt the hardest period of my life, being in that,” she said she felt “really trapped in a tumultuous family dynamic.”Munn further said that the relationship taught her to stand up for herself. “It taught me how to stand up and fight for myself, so that was great. I truly had no idea that I could be manipulated and hurt that way, that I wouldn’t just get out of something that was dangerous to my psyche.It’s not just the period that you’re with the person, but, if you’re lucky to get out, (it’s) the years of healing yourself afterwards,” Munn told Lewinsky.She further shared, “The catalyst was getting out of a relationship that had drained me and left me just really...it's hard, I don't know if there's a word to describe it what that relationship was like...it was, without a doubt, the hardest period of my life, being in that.”Danica Patrick, the former professional racing driver and model, appeared onpodcast, where she disclosed that she was in an emotionally abusive relationship with the 41-year-old quarterback, Aaron Rodgers.“The breakup with Aaron(Rodgers) in 2020—because it was sudden, it felt like it was my life. When you live with somebody, it’s your whole life—your dentist appointments, your hairdo, your clothes, your mailing address, everything. Because the nature of the relationship was emotionally abusive, it wore me down to nothing.Something that people could never imagine is that I would lack any confidence or belief in the simple things about who I am. Everything was torn to bits.He leaves a trail of blood. I don’t think I’m saying too much earth-shattering stuff; there’s been enough out there.But it gave me the greatest gift, which was myself—how much I needed to show up for myself, take care of myself,” Patrick told Sage Steele.The former IndyCar Series and NASCAR driver said she felt like she was built for hard things when she was in a relationship with Rodgers,“Hindsight, I ignored it(emotionally abusive relationship), but in real life, it was just like, I would say all the time—I’m built for hard things. I can handle hard things. And so, I just saw it as a hard thing, and my nature is to try harder and do more.What if I don't do it for the right person? What if I get too proud and go like—I'm just I'm done. Instead of going—Man, just try a little harder. What if you look back and think—Man, I wish I would have tried. I would never want that in my life. I wish I would have tried. This is probably why I don't have regret and I don't have shame.”","Aaron Rodgers’ former partners have shared powerful excerpts from their past relationships, including phrases like “Depression would come,” “Dangerous to my psyche,’ and “Emotionally abusive.” Thanks to the podcast world, women have started expressing themselves beyond the fear of judgment.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123764899,imgsize-3192143,width-400,resizemode-4/nfl-aaron-rodgers.jpg"
