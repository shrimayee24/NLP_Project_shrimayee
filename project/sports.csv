How reality finally caught up with MTV,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-reality-finally-caught-up-with-mtv/articleshow/124593223.cms,".

In India, the M(usic) had gone out of MTV long ago. Now, the channel is shuttering its music channels in Europe. But its VJs, who had made TV cool, have banded together and are now making everyday life look cool, one reel at a time

Political revolutions happen on the streets, often marked by violence and chaos. Cultural revolutions are quieter, even surreptitious. MTV is the perfect example. The music channel was among the biggest cultural ‘influencers’ of the modern world much before Gen Z appropriated the word. And many of us didn’t even notice it.Born in Aug 1981, MTV fundamentally changed the way the global young consumed popular music. The first music video televised on the channel, “Video Killed The Radio Star” by The Buggles, was a cheeky declaration of intent.Till then, songs were auditory. Now, they morphed into the audio-visual. This was also the time when rhythm-driven disco had taken hold of the club and party scene in the West. A hot-stepping John Travolta, with the help of the Bee Gees, had seduced the only-toowilling in Saturday Night Fever (1977) and Grease (1978). MTV was perfectly poised to cash in on the perfect storm of opportunity. But the channel was struggling to find a larger, more diverse demographic.Enter Michael Jackson ’s Thriller. The album released in 1982 had recorded good sales, but it was nowhere close to becoming a monster success. But the music videos of its songs — Billie Jean, Beat It and, more specifically, title track Thriller (released in 1983) — took record sales to ginormous levels. Jackson and MTV synergised each other like nothing before or after. “Thriller sealed MTV’s reputation as a new cultural force…” Phile Hebblethwaite wrote in The Guardian in 2013. Equally importantly, it also widened the channel’s demographic reach and advertising appeal, making it a major success.Overall, MTV created the template of the singing-dancing star, shifted public tastes towards a more rhythm-oriented music and eye candy pop stars (think Duran Duran) and became the go-to channel for the 13 plus23 minus defining their idea of cool. Which translated into what outfit to wear and which condoms to use, spawning a parallel multi-billion-dollar consumer industry. MTV was also Money TV.By 1987, MTV even tailored news the way the young allegedly wanted it. A 2023 NYT article recalled how President Bill Clinton’s response to a town hall query put ‘MTV News’ under the spotlight in 1994. The existential question was: “‘Boxers or briefs?’ ‘Usually briefs’, Mr Clinton responded to a room full of giggles.” MTV had seamlessly constructed pop politics.MTV had impacted India long before the channel came to India. In the 1980s, India was a single-television channel country even though the country briefly sampled the new world of music videos, courtesy DD every week. But this was also the video cassette recorder age, when pirated tapes of foreign films and music videos were readily available countrywide. If you saw shades of Jackson’s moonwalk in a Mithun or Govinda move, you didn’t need to think twice how the song found its way to Bollywood. Thousands even in small-town India were already doing the same.In 1991, India opened its economy and the skies. Satellite TV brought in soaps such as ‘The Bold and the Beautiful’ bringing the forbidden to upwardly mobile middle-class homes. The urban young found a channel that spoke to — not at them — when MTV India happened in 1996, two years after Channel V, another channel of the same variety. The channels gave them vitality and identity. As in the West, the video jockeys were as pivotal as the music. The VJs — their relaxed flounce, their cool couture, their zany humour — seemed hipper than the Bollywood stars in the newly globalised universe. These channels seldom commanded high TRPs but they ranked high as influencers of the “with-it” as well as the “wannabe” urban young.Both Channel V and MTV eventually went desi, hoping to reach out to a larger audience, enabling the rise of local music talent in Indi-Pop (Silk Route, Alisha Chinoy, Lucky Ali, to name a few) and Bhangra pop (Daler Mehndi). But the times and the tech were a-changin’. Rampant online and offline music piracy caused the fall of record companies, forcing others associated with music to change tracks. Now lifestyle took frontstage.MTV recast itself with reality shows: the intense Roadies (2003) and the dating show, Splitsvilla (2008), to name two. Rannvijay Singha and Ayushsmann Khurana were two early winners of the show. And while these shows continue to enthuse a small section among the young and the restless, MTV ceased to inhabit the young’s cultural cosmos. As smartphones became an extension of the hand, the world got busy broadcasting itself; everyone making their own reels, short videos and video logs. In the new chaotically democratised world of entertainment, there was no space for an arbiter of hip. It was more than just a mid-life crisis. MTV was a great idea whose time had gone.","MTV fundamentally changed the way the global young consumed popular music.

"Pankaj Dheer, TV’s Karna, loses fight with cancer",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pankaj-dheer-tvs-karna-loses-fight-with-cancer/articleshow/124592568.cms,"Pankaj Dheer, Mahabharat's Karna, Passes Away At 68

Actor Pankaj Dheer , whose impressive turn as the wronged prince Karna in the television epic, ‘Mahabharat’ (1988), embedded him in a generation’s memory, passed away in Mumbai on Wednesday. He was 68. Dheer was suffering from cancer. “He had been in and out of hospital in the past months,” producer and friend Ashoke Pandit told PTI.In an interview to the video magazine, ‘Lehren Retro’, the actor once revealed that he had refused the part of Arjun in the BR Chopra production because he was asked to shave off his moustache. “It was foolishness,” he admitted. Six months later he was offered Karna which didn’t require him to shave off facial hair.Dheer’s family roots went back to Kasur, a town south of Lahore, in pre-independence India. But the son of producer-director CL Dheer (‘Bahu Beti’, ‘Alingan’) had grown up in Bandra, Mumbai. The TV show’s Sanskritised dialogues triggered performance anxiety.The actor sought tips from Rahi Masoom Raza, who had co-written the show. Among other things, Raza suggested that he should read aloud the Hindi daily, ‘Navbharat Times’, a sister publication of The Times of India, everyday.With his imposing presence and empathetic voice, Dheer executed an unforgettable Karna drawing the audience's sympathy. The role gave him what every actor yearns for: fame, adulation and a steady career.When the character died in the serial, many shaved off their hair in Bastar, then part of Madhya Pradesh. “At the behest of (then) chief minister Arjun Singh, I flew there and consoled the mourners, assuring them that I was alive. It was something you believe only when you see it,” he recalled in the interview.Pankaj Dheer also said, “Many people do not know my name, but they recognize me as Karna. Even today, my face is published as Karna’s face in textbooks.”The role opened doors in television and films leading to nearly 100 TV shows and films. One of his most remembered roles was of King Shivdutt in the mega fantasy, ‘Chandrakanta’ (1994). Two notable films were Bobby Deol’s ‘Soldier’ (1998) and Shah Rukh Khan’s ‘Baadshah’ (1999), where he played a scheming security chief.Dheer’s passing was mourned on social media. Among those who attended the funeral were fellow actors from Mahabharat, and Salman Khan, with whom he had worked in films such as ‘Sanam Bewafa’ (1991).","Actor Pankaj Dheer, who played Karna in Mahabharat, passed away on Wednesday.

"‘Nothing is well in NDA’: BJP bets big on Chirag, again; Bihar allies in a tizzy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nothing-is-well-in-nda-bjp-bets-big-on-chirag-again-bihar-allies-in-a-tizzy/articleshow/124580036.cms,"NEW DELHI: ‘This time, nothing is well in NDA … ’ Rashtriya Lok Morcha chief and former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha , who has been a key partner of the ruling Bihar alliance, has sent out clear signals of discontent within the NDA. The RLP leader, reports say quoting sources, is unhappy over Mahua assembly seat in Vaishali district being given to Chirag Paswan.Kushwaha is not alone in raising the banner of revolt. Another key NDA partner, Union minister and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) leader Jitan Ram Manjhi has also made it clear that he will field his party (HAM) candidates from at least two seats - Bodh Gaya and Makhdumpur assembly constituencies.Both the allies, who have got 6 seats each under the division, are upset over the relatively larger number of seats – 29 – allotted to Paswan’s LJP(Ram Vilas). This despite the fact that Chirag Paswan’s performance in the last assembly elections was anything but inspiring. In 2020, the party had walked out of the NDA and contested on all 243 seats, but could win only one seat. However, what it did manage to do was damage Nitish Kumar ’s JD(U) and make it a junior partner of the BJP in Bihar assembly.Chirag was perhaps rewarded by the BJP for this role when he was taken back into the NDA fold ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections and given five parliamentary seats – all of which the party won. That 100% strike rate perhaps could be the justification for giving the fledgling party 29 seats- way more than the other two allies.Political experts say Chirag Paswan remains part of BJP’s gameplan post elections once again. In 2020, he helped BJP by staying out of NDA. This time around, he could play a key role in ensuring that Nitish Kumar does not become the chief minister if NDA wins the elections.“The actual seat division in NDA is 130 for BJP and 113 for Nitish Kumar,” says political analyst Kumar Vijay. “The BJP has given 29 seats to Chirag Pawan so that in post-election scenario the numbers won by LJP can be used to sideline Nitish Kumar’s claims to the top post if NDA wins the elections,” he says.“Instead of giving so many seats to Chirag, the BJP should have tried to make all the allies, including Nitish Kumar, happy ahead of the elections. Post elections, after winning the required seats, it could have asserted and staked claim to the top post,” Kumar says. “In Bihar BJP, non-political persons are taking political decisions. Small people have been given big responsibilities and hence they have mismanaged everything,” the political analyst adds.The BJP has already initiated fire-fighting process. Upendra Kushwaha was summoned to Delhi to meet Amit Shah. ""We met with the Home Minister, and the issue was discussed. After this discussion, we now hope that there will be no difficulties ahead, and the NDA government will definitely be formed in Bihar. In every way, all the alliance parties within the NDA are ready,"" Kushwaha told reporters.But the bigger worry for the BJP would be Nitish Kumar. Reports say Nitish Kumar is unhappy with the way things have turned out. Already several senior JD(U) leaders have raised a banner of revolt. From open resignation letters to dharna, Nitish is under pressure from within to salvage the situation for his party. There are two camps within the JD(U) – one that favours close association with the BJP and the other that is opposing party’s alleged subjugation. It will be interesting to see how things pan out in the next few days, especially how the Bihar chief minister reacts to BJP’s “Chirag plan.”","Upendra Kushwaha is unhappy over Mahua assembly seat in Vaishali district being given to Chirag Paswan. Another key NDA partner, Union minister and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) leader Jitan Ram Manjhi has also made it clear that he will field his party candidates.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124583123,imgsize-1615519,width-400,resizemode-4/bjp-bets-big-on-chirag-again-bihar-allies-in-a-tizzy.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The race for Bihar’s 2025 Assembly elections intensified on Wednesday with a flurry of major developments across parties — from BJP’s new list of candidates to Prashant Kishor ’s decision to stay out of the contest and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav ’s filing of nomination papers from his family bastion of Raghopur.While the NDA allies have almost completed their ticket distribution, the opposition INDIA bloc remains entangled in talks over seat-sharing. With the first phase of polling just weeks away, the political heat in Bihar is soaring, here are the major developments of the day:Prashant Kishor confirmed he will not contest the upcoming assembly elections, saying his decision was made for the “greater good” of his party, Jan Suraaj.Speaking to PTI, Kishor said, “If I were to contest, it would distract me from necessary organisational work.” He added that his party had decided to field Chanchal Singh against Tejashwi Yadav in Raghopur instead.Despite stepping aside, Kishor exuded confidence about Jan Suraaj’s performance: “We will either win handsomely or face a complete drubbing. There’s no middle ground.” He further stated, “A tally below 150 will be a defeat for me.”RJD claimed Kishor has “accepted defeat for his Jan Suraaj Party even before going to the battlefield,” while the BJP said, “Kishor realised he would not win elections.” The JD(U) called it a “humiliation for his party workers.”Reacting, RJD’s Mrityunjay Tiwary said, “Kishor’s tyre has been flattened,” while BJP’s Niraj Kumar said his “bubble burst even before the elections.” JD(U)’s Neeraj Kumar added, “He has run away before the electoral battle.”Union minister Giriraj Singh mocked Kishor’s target as “Mungerilal ke haseen sapne,” calling Jan Suraaj a “vote katwa” and “RJD’s B team.”Janata Dal (United) released its first list, betting big on newcomers. Chief minister Nitish Kumar’s party announced its first list of 57 candidates, featuring 30 fresh faces alongside 27 sitting MLAs.The newcomer-heavy list targets key constituencies, including five seats reportedly sought by Chirag Paswan’s LJP (RV), signaling a direct challenge. JD(U) has also carefully balanced caste representation—fielding candidates across OBCs, Scheduled Castes, Extremely Backward Castes, and upper castes—to maintain its traditional social justice appeal.Notably absent in this list are Muslim candidates, a departure from past elections, which might impact JD(U)’s support among Muslim voters. The party has also included cabinet ministers, women candidates, and recent turncoats, showcasing a mix of experience and fresh energy.The Congress announced 17 candidates for the elections, even as it continued to remain silent on any formal seat-sharing arrangement with the Mahagathbandhan. The candidates were handed party tickets by Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president Rajesh Ram.The list includes Vijendra Chaudhary from Muzaffarpur, Om Prakash Garg from Gopalganj, Jitendra Singh from Amarpur, and Amita Bhushan from Begusarai. Also nominated are Lalan Kumar (Sultanganj), Rajesh Ram (Kutumba), Shashi Shekhar (Wazirganj), and Kaushalendra Kumar (Nalanda). Anand Shankar Singh will contest from Aurangabad, while Pratima Das has been fielded from Rajapakad. Shiv Prakash Garib Das will contest from Bachhwara, and Trishuldhari Singh from Barabigha.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) released its second and third list for the upcoming polls. With this the saffron party announced all the 101 candidates it had been allotted as part of the NDA.In its third list of 18 candidates, the party named Bina Devi from Kochadhaman and Sanjay Pandey from Narkatiaganj.In the second list of 12 candidates, it was announced that popular folk singer Maithili Thakur will contest from Alinagar in Darbhanga, while former IPS officer Anand Mishra, who earlier headed the youth wing of Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj party, has been fielded from Buxar.The list also includes Ram Chandra Prasad from Hayaghat, Ranjan Kumar from Muzaffarpur, Subhash Singh from Gopalganj, and Vinay Kumar Singh from Sonepur. BJP had released its first list a day earlier, featuring key figures such as deputy chief ministers Samrat Choudhary (Tarapur) and Vijay Sinha (Lakhisarai), along with former Deputy CMs Renu Devi (Bettiah) and Tarkishore Prasad (Katihar).Interestingly, Assembly Speaker Nand Kishore Yadav was denied a ticket from Patna Sahib, replaced by Ratnesh Kushwaha, while long-time MLA Arun Kumar Sinha was dropped in favour of Sanjay Gupta from Kumrahar. The list also includes nine women candidates, including Renu Devi and Sweety Singh from Kishanganj.RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav filed his nomination papers from Raghopur, the family’s traditional seat, in the presence of his parents — RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav and former CM Rabri Devi. He was accompanied by sister Misa Bharti and senior party aides.Addressing supporters, Tejashwi dismissed rumours of contesting multiple seats, saying, “The voters of Raghopur have reposed their trust in me twice. I am contesting only this one seat. But I want the people of Bihar to think they’re voting for Tejashwi in all 243 constituencies.”He pledged to transform Bihar’s governance, saying the polls were about “not just changing the government but changing Bihar.” The RJD, as part of the INDIA bloc, has promised to bring a Job Guarantee Act ensuring one government job per household if elected.Thousands of supporters lined the 40-km route from Patna to Hajipur as the RJD convoy moved towards the collectorate, showering the Yadav family’s car with flower petals. Lalu Prasad, in a wheelchair, accompanied his son into the nomination venue.","The race for Bihar’s 2025 Assembly elections intensified on Wednesday with a flurry of major developments across parties.

Player Age Contract Status 2025 WAR Team Need Fit Kyle Schwarber 32 Free Agent 3.6 Power DH Jarren Duran 28 Team Control (through 2028) 2.7 Speed / Defensive outfielder

Who Wins the Deal?

Theare once again linked to a potential reunion with Kyle Schwarber, one of the most powerful hitters in baseball and a former Fenway Park favorite. With the Philadelphia Phillies exiting the NLDS and Schwarber heading into free agency, the timing seems right for both sides to explore a comeback. Yet, the move comes with important considerations surrounding roster balance, defense, and the team’s long-term payroll structure.At 32 years old, Kyle Schwarber delivered one of the best seasons of his career, leading the National League in both home runs and RBIs while earning his second All-Star nod. His offensive numbers reaffirmed his reputation as one of baseball’s premier power bats.Technically, the Boston Red Sox wouldn’t need to trade for Schwarber - he’s now a free agent after completing his four-year, $79 million contract with Philadelphia. However, a sign-and-trade scenario could emerge if the Phillies seek to gain value rather than let him walk for nothing.A hypothetical trade could look like this:• Boston Red Sox receive: Kyle Schwarber (DH)• Philadelphia Phillies receive: Jarren Duran (OF) and a mid-tier pitching prospect such as Wikelman GonzalezThis framework would allow Boston to move an excess outfielder while gaining the middle-order slugger the lineup has lacked since Rafael Devers’ departure.For Philadelphia, Duran’s athleticism and defensive range would fill a major need in their outfield, offering youth and control through 2028.1. Elite Power Addition: The Boston Red Sox finished 18th in MLB in home runs (176), well below playoff-caliber teams. Schwarber’s 50-plus homer potential would immediately fix that deficiency.2. Clubhouse and Fan Familiarity: During his 2021 stint with Boston, Schwarber quickly became a fan favorite. His leadership and postseason experience could stabilize a young roster headlined by Roman Anthony and Ceddanne Rafaela.3. Perfect Fenway Fit: Schwarber’s pull-heavy swing from the left side matches perfectly with Fenway Park’s short right-field porch, reminiscent of how David Ortiz thrived in the designated hitter role.1. Luxury Tax Flexibility: Schwarber’s next deal is expected to command between $25 and $35 million per year. The Phillies already have major financial commitments to Bryce Harper, Trea Turner, and Zack Wheeler, so shedding that salary would bring relief.2. Improved Defensive Balance: Duran brings elite speed and defensive versatility - qualities the Phillies currently lack outside of Brandon Marsh.3. Future-Proofing the Roster: Acquiring controllable players would help Philadelphia stay competitive while avoiding the payroll crunch looming in future seasons.In 2025, Boston ranked 23rd in slugging percentage (.398), while Philadelphia finished top five (.448). Adding Schwarber’s production would likely boost Boston’s team OPS by around 20 points - enough to elevate the offense closer to league leaders.From an immediate standpoint, Boston clearly benefits more by acquiring one of baseball’s most dangerous power hitters. Kyle Schwarber’s bat alone could add several wins to the Boston Red Sox offense, potentially improving their team WAR by approximately +4.0 in 2026 projections.For the Phillies, the benefits lie in long-term strategy - saving roughly $30 million annually while replenishing their roster with younger, cost-controlled assets. Although losing Schwarber’s production would sting, the move would give them financial breathing room and lineup balance.If the deal materializes, the Boston Red Sox emerge as short-term winners, gaining the kind of middle-order thunder that has been missing in their lineup. Kyle Schwarber’s familiarity with Fenway Park and connection with fans make the move both sentimental and strategically sound.For the Phillies, it’s a calculated decision - trading short-term firepower for financial stability and roster flexibility.Also read: MLB Trade Rumors: Boston Red Sox Predicted to Land $10.15 Million Detroit Tigers Star to Bolster Squad Around Garrett Crochet Ultimately, this could turn out to be one of the most impactful reunions of the 2025–26 MLB offseason, especially if Boston leverages Kyle Schwarber’s power to reignite their postseason ambitions.","The Boston Red Sox are once again linked to a potential reunion with Kyle Schwarber.

Luka Doncic is expected to play tonight

Latest Injury Update on Los Angeles Lakers’ Stars

Summary

as the Los Angeles Lakers take on the Dallas Mavericks in a preseason matchup at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. After sitting out the team’s first three exhibition games, Doncic made his preseason debut recently and immediately reminded everyone why he’s among the NBA’s brightest stars. In just 22 minutes of action, he delivered a stellar performance with 25 points, 7 rebounds, and 4 assists, showing no signs of rust.The game holds special significance as Doncic faces his former team, the Dallas Mavericks, and the Slovenian superstar has expressed excitement about taking the court against them. His comments and recent on-court performance suggest he is ready and eager to play tonight.However, despite Luka Doncic ’s readiness and enthusiasm, the Lakers are proceeding with caution. The team’s coaching staff has been managing his workload carefully following his EuroBasket commitments and his return to preseason action. Reports suggest that the Los Angeles Lakers only plan to feature him in a limited number of exhibition games, possibly just two. Given that Doncic already made his debut, there remains a strong chance that he might sit out this game to avoid unnecessary strain before the regular season begins.The Lakers have emphasized preserving his long-term health and ensuring he enters the season in peak condition.The Los Angeles Lakers are currently navigating several injury issues as the regular season approaches.

Thesquare off on October 15, 2025, at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas for one of the most anticipated NBA preseason matchups of the year. Coming just a day after both teams play back-to-back games, this contest is heavily shaped by rest decisions, injury management, and the differing preseason priorities of each franchise.Under head coach Jason Kidd, the Dallas Mavericks approach this preseason finale with a clear focus on building chemistry among their projected starting lineup ahead of the regular-season opener against the San Antonio Spurs. Kidd fields a strong rotation that included Cooper Flagg at point guard, Klay Thompson on the wing, P.J. Washington and Anthony Davis in the frontcourt, and Dereck Lively II anchoring the paint. Anthony Davis will play a crucial role in this matchup as he continues adjusting to his role as a power forward. The Dallas Mavericks plan to give Davis over 25 minutes of playing time to help him find rhythm and cohesion with his new teammates.The spotlight shifted to Cooper Flagg, who might be given the opportunity to run the offense and showcase his ability to control tempo and facilitate scoring opportunities for veterans like Thompson and Davis.The Los Angeles Lakers enter the game facing a long list of injury concerns and load management decisions.LeBron James remained sidelined with ongoing sciatica issues affecting his right side, and his absence was confirmed for the early portion of the season. Other key contributors - Jarred Vanderbilt, Rui Hachimura, Gabe Vincent, and Jaxson Hayes - were also rested for the second game of their back-to-back schedule, signaling the Los Angeles Lakers’ commitment to preserving veteran health before the season tip-off.A significant update came from rookie forward Adou Thiero’s recovery process. After dealing with persistent knee swelling, Thiero’s rehabilitation showed positive signs as he gradually increased his on-court workload. Team doctors projected another evaluation within two to three weeks, reflecting the organization’s cautious but optimistic outlook on his development.With multiple veterans unavailable, the Lakers can test their bench and younger players. Gabe Vincent was expected to handle point guard duties alongside Dalton Knecht at shooting guard, with Vanderbilt, Hachimura, and Hayes rounding out the frontcourt - though this lineup was adjusted with several players sitting out. As a result, players like Nick Smith Jr. saw increased minutes, allowing the coaching staff to evaluate depth and individual readiness ahead of the regular season.The approaches of both teams stood in sharp contrast. The Dallas Mavericks leaned toward a regular-season simulation, playing their main core extended minutes to fine-tune chemistry and assess lineup combinations. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Lakers prioritized rest, recovery, and developmental minutes for their younger rotation members.Jason Kidd’s emphasis on integrating Anthony Davis into the Dallas Mavericks’ system was a key storyline. Davis’ combination of defensive versatility and frontcourt scoring offered a new dynamic for Dallas, particularly in spacing and rim protection. The absence of Luka Doncic provided an opportunity for the Mavericks’ supporting cast to shoulder offensive responsibilities and build confidence heading into the season.For the Los Angeles Lakers, the primary goal was long-term durability rather than short-term results. Head coach Darvin Ham’s conservative management of star players underscored a broader strategy focused on keeping the team healthy and cohesive for the long haul. Despite missing key figures like LeBron James and Rui Hachimura, the team’s younger players gained valuable experience in live-game scenarios against one of the stronger Western Conference rosters.While the Los Angeles Lakers managed their roster with caution, the Dallas Mavericks entered with higher intensity, reflecting a readiness for the regular season. Dallas’ deeper rotation and more aggressive approach positioned them as favorites heading into the matchup. For fans, this game offered an intriguing blend of youthful energy and veteran adjustments, setting the stage for both franchises’ ambitions in the upcoming campaign.Also read: Dallas Mavericks vs Los Angeles Lakers Preseason Showdown: Odds, Predictions, and Betting Guide (October 15, 2025) Though the final score was secondary to preparation, the preseason clash served its purpose - offering a glimpse into each team’s evolving identity, player health, and readiness for what promises to be a competitive 2025-26 NBA season.","The Dallas Mavericks and Los Angeles Lakers square off on October 15, 2025, at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.

Rashee Rice ready for a full workload against Raiders





Chiefs’ offense could reach a new level with Rice’s return





The Kansas City Chiefs are already buzzing after their gritty Week 6 win over the Detroit Lions, but their momentum could skyrocket even further in Week 7. Star wide receiver Rashee Rice, who’s been sidelined for six weeks due to suspension, is officially back — and the Chiefs aren’t wasting a second. As they prepare to face the Las Vegas Raiders, Kansas City looks ready to unleash its most dangerous version of the offense yet, with Rice set to play a massive role right out of the gate.According to ESPN insiders Dan Graziano and Jeremy Fowler, the Chiefs plan to throw Rice right into the mix. “The Chiefs won’t be easing Rashee Rice back into action,” Fowler reported. “They will be allocating a heavy workload for him as soon as possible.”Rice, who has been back at the team facility since late September, has impressed coaches with his conditioning and commitment. Fowler added, “Rice has been in the building for weeks, had an excellent training camp and is in peak physical shape. A team source says Rice will be ‘full bore’ this week as he gets back onto the practice field.”Head coach Andy Reid echoed that sentiment, emphasizing Rice’s readiness while keeping expectations grounded.“Listen, I know he’s been working like crazy,” Reid said. “I think it’s just a matter of getting him back in the swing… I know he’s in good shape, that’s the one thing that I do know.”Kansas City’s offensive plan this week could mark the debut of a long-anticipated trio: Rashee Rice, rookie sensation Xavier Worthy, and veteran deep threat Hollywood Brown — a combination that could redefine the Chiefs’ passing game. With Tyquan Thornton and JuJu Smith-Schuster providing depth, Kansas City suddenly boasts one of the deepest receiving corps in the league.Before his injury and suspension, Rice had already proven he could be a game-changer. As a rookie in 2023, he caught 79 passes for 938 yards and seven touchdowns. Even in a limited role early last season, he averaged nearly 100 yards per game before a knee injury ended his campaign. His return gives quarterback Patrick Mahomes another reliable and explosive option — something the Chiefs have missed through the first six weeks.Kansas City, now winners of three of their last four after a rocky start, leads this week’s Sports Illustrated NFL Power Rankings. Mahomes is once again the MVP favorite, Travis Kelce continues to dominate defenses, and now with Rice’s comeback, the Chiefs’ offense looks poised to reach another gear.As Fowler put it, the Chiefs “have long envisioned an offense” featuring Rice, Worthy, and Brown together. That vision might finally become reality this Sunday — and it could make the Kansas City Chiefs even scarier than before.Also Read: ""My heart now belongs..."": Why is Charles Leno’s retirement tied to the emotional anniversary of his daughter’s miscarriage?","Rashee Rice has been sidelined for six weeks due to suspension.

Jason Kelce shuts down fake quotes about Bad Bunny but makes a factual error

Fans react to Jason Kelce’s “honest mistake” and defend his intentions





Jason Kelce, one of the NFL ’s most beloved figures, recently found himself in an unexpected online storm after addressing a series of fake quotes falsely attributed to him. While his intention was to set the record straight, fans quickly noticed that his clarification included an embarrassing slip, one that sparked a new wave of reactions on social media.The controversy began when a fabricated quote started circulating online, claiming Kelce had commented on Bad Bunny’s upcoming 2026 Super Bowl halftime show. The viral fake quote read: “If Bad Bunny is a bad fit for the Super Bowl, then maybe the people making these comments are a bad fit for America’s future.”Kelce swiftly took to X (formerly Twitter) to clarify, writing, “I normally don’t comment on things like this, but I feel I need to address that there are several accounts posting fake quotes and attributing them to me on this platform right now.”He went on to thank the social platform’s community feature for helping identify misinformation: “I appreciate @X putting community notes on several, and I will not address the other accounts specifically, because I do not want to amplify their engagement. But please know, unless you hear something directly from me via one of my platforms, it is not real.”However, sharp-eyed users were quick to correct Kelce, noting that community notes are not issued by X itself but rather by users who volunteer to fact-check content.Fans pointed out the irony of Kelce unintentionally spreading misinformation while calling it out, turning the clarification into an even bigger talking point.Despite the blunder, fans rallied around the retired Eagles legend. “At least he’s trying to fight fake news — can’t say that about many athletes,” one fan commented. Another joked, “Jason just community-noted himself, and I kinda love that energy.”Others saw humor in the situation, posting memes about how quickly misinformation spreads, even among those trying to stop it. Still, most agreed Kelce’s response reflected his integrity and transparency.As one fan summed it up: “Jason may have misspoken, but at least he’s showing accountability.

Jimmy Butler has a clear goal for the Golden State Warriors. He wants to help Stephen Curry and Draymond Green win their fifth NBA title. The six-time All-Star recently joined the Warriors in February and accepted the role of Robin to Curry’s Batman. His arrival gave the team a big boost. Butler averaged 17.9 points, 5.9 assists, and 5.5 rebounds in 30 games as Golden State went 23-8 to end the season. Now, he is focused on one mission: winning the NBA 2025-26.Jimmy Butler has reached the NBA Finals twice before but has never won a ring. He now wants to change that story for himself, but more importantly, he wants Stephen Curry and Draymond Green to lift their fifth championship.“It would mean the world to me,” he told NBC Sports Bay Area’s Kerith Burke on “Dubs Talk.” “But it would mean the world to me if they won.”“You can’t question it. You can’t say, ‘Who was on your team?’ You’ve done it with multiple different types of players and rosters. You get five, nobody is questioning anything about anybody that got five”, he added.Ever since he joined the team, Butler has made winning his main goal. “They’ve already solidified themselves in the basketball hall of fame and in the league, we get that.But to separate themselves from other individuals, you get five, like, you’re there”, he continued.Curry has already built a strong legacy with four titles, one Finals MVP, and two MVP awards. Butler believes another title will push Curry into the NBA’s top 10 all-time players.Jimmy Butler's stint with the Miami Heat ended with tension over contracts. However, he stated that he holds no grudges. In fact, he is grateful to be with the Golden State Warriors. “I wouldn’t change it for the world…I love where I am at right now,” he said. “I don’t think I can be in a better place, organization-wise, team-wise, headspace-wise. When I say I’m genuinely happy, I’m really, really happy right now.”The Warriors will open their NBA 2025-25 season on October 21 against LeBron James’ Los Angeles Lakers. Butler will be hoping to play the Robin role again, hoping it leads to a fifth ring for the team’s icons Stephen Curry and Draymond Green.Also Read: ""Get Out, We don't need you""- Draymond Green sends stern message to Los Angeles Lakers' legend LeBron James ahead of upcoming NBA season",Jimmy Butler joined the Golden State Warriors in February.

My Final Thoughts on This Signing

has officially agreed to sign with the Sacramento Kings for his 18th NBA season, marking one of the most intriguing veteran signings of the 2025 offseason. This move represents a strategic shift for both Westbrook and the Kings, offering the former MVP a fresh opportunity to extend his legacy while providing Sacramento with much-needed experience and energy.After spending months as a free agent, Russell Westbrook - nine-time All-Star and 2017 NBA MVP - finalized an agreement with the Sacramento Kings following weeks of behind-the-scenes discussions. Sacramento had been in contact with Westbrook’s camp since the offseason, intent on strengthening their backcourt depth and locker room leadership.To make room for the veteran guard, the Sacramento Kings explored moving pieces like Malik Monk to balance a guard-heavy roster. The team’s front office, led by new GM Scott Perry, emphasized bringing in proven leaders capable of driving a high-effort culture.While specific contract terms have not been disclosed, Westbrook’s signing aligns with a busy Sacramento offseason that also included the addition of Dennis Schröder and trades for key names such as De’Aaron Fox , Zach LaVine, and DeMar DeRozan. Russell Westbrook is expected to fill a flexible role - either as a situational starter or more likely as a high-impact sixth man guiding the second unit.• Gains a veteran presence with unmatched motor and leadership experience.• Fills a major void in bench scoring and playmaking, as the Kings ranked 28th in bench points and 29th in bench assists last season.• Aligns perfectly with the team’s cultural reset under Scott Perry, emphasizing accountability, toughness, and intensity.• Joins a legitimate playoff contender with established stars and a clear role.• Reunites with familiar faces in both the locker room and front office, making for a smoother transition.• Has the chance to continue building on his legendary statistical resume, potentially chasing Oscar Robertson’s all-time point guard scoring record and the 10,000 assists milestone.• Younger players like Devin Carter may see a dip in playing time but gain invaluable mentorship from one of the game’s most respected competitors.• If Malik Monk is traded to facilitate the signing, another team could benefit from adding a dynamic scorer just entering his prime.• Bench Stability and Star Power: Westbrook averaged 13.3 points, 6.1 assists, and 4.9 rebounds on 44.9% shooting last season, thriving as a sixth man.• Playoff-Ready Mindset: His postseason experience brings an element of urgency and competitive fire to a roster featuring new stars like LaVine, DeRozan, and Sabonis.• Cultural Fit: Known as one of the league’s hardest workers, Westbrook’s presence reinforces Sacramento’s focus on effort and discipline.• Age and Decline: At nearly 37 years old, Westbrook’s athleticism has naturally declined, and maintaining consistent production could be a challenge.• Crowded Backcourt: The addition creates a logjam among the team’s guards, possibly hindering the development of younger players.• Ball Dominance: Sharing playmaking duties with other veterans could pose lineup challenges that require chemistry and trust to resolve.Russell Westbrook remains one of the most accomplished players in NBA history, holding the record for the most triple-doubles (203) and joining LeBron James as the only players ever to record at least 25,000 points, 8,000 rebounds, and 8,000 assists. He currently sits just 506 points away from surpassing Oscar Robertson as the highest-scoring point guard of all time.The Sacramento Kings ’ roster now blends seasoned stars like DeMar DeRozan, Zach LaVine, and Domantas Sabonis with emerging talents such as Devin Carter and Doug McDermott. Russell Westbrook’s addition injects a level of championship urgency and veteran stability that Sacramento has lacked in recent years.After missing the playoffs twice since their 2023 postseason return, the Sacramento Kings are clearly positioning themselves as a serious contender in the Western Conference. Russell Westbrook’s relentless style of play and leadership make him a strong complement to the team’s offensive firepower and evolving identity.Both parties emerge as winners in this deal. The Sacramento Kings address their glaring need for veteran playmaking and second-unit production, while Westbrook gains a fresh environment that values his experience and drive. The move enhances Sacramento’s playoff ambitions and provides Westbrook with a meaningful opportunity to extend his career, contribute to winning basketball, and continue climbing the all-time leaderboards.In the end, the partnership between Russell Westbrook and the Sacramento Kings represents a low-risk, high-reward scenario - one that boosts the team’s competitiveness and adds another compelling chapter to Westbrook’s remarkable NBA journey.","Russell Westbrook has officially agreed to sign with the Sacramento Kings for his 18th NBA season.

Chris “Mad Dog” Russo says Molly Qerim wanted to save face



“If I’m not going to do First Take, I don’t want to do SportsCenter,”

Marcellus Wiley and Burke Magnus share more reasons behind Qerim’s exit

“and more about her wanting to turn the page and try something new.”

Molly Qerim shocked everyone when she suddenly left ESPN and her longtime role as First Take host last month. Many thought she would stay until the end of the year, but she announced her exit early through Instagram. A day later, First Take co-host Stephen A. Smith revealed that she had left ESPN completely. Now, veteran broadcaster Chris “Mad Dog” Russo has shared a surprising reason for her sudden move. Russo believes Molly left early because she felt embarrassed about being quietly replaced on the show.Chris Russo spoke about Molly’s exit on the SI Media Podcast this week. He said ESPN bosses might have been planning to move her off First Take and “try something different,” even though the show’s ratings were fine. “It’s the nature of the beast,” Russo said. “You’re on air forever, and sometimes they just want to make a change.”According to Russo, ESPN probably wanted to keep Molly in the company but in a different role. He believes Molly didn’t want to take that offer because she may have seen it as a step down.he guessed she thought. Russo said she might have felt embarrassed if fans believed she was just waiting to be removed from the show.“I didn’t talk to her about the details,” Russo said. “But that’s what I think happened. She probably wanted to leave before everyone thought she was a lame duck.”Earlier, former ESPN host Marcellus Wiley claimed that Molly Qerim was unhappy with her pay. On his Dat Dude TV podcast, Wiley said she earned around $500,000 per year, while Stephen A. Smith makes close to $20 million annually.Marcellus Wiley said Molly felt disrespected by the difference, especially since she had co-hosted one of ESPN’s most popular shows for a decade.Also Read: Simone Biles Opens Up About Her Mental Health Struggles During Argentina Trip Inspiring Millions With Honesty He also said Molly wanted to start her own show, but ESPN didn’t approve it. “That wasn’t happening,” Wiley said. “They weren’t signing off on her doing her own show.

He told The Athletic that contract renewal talks had failed and that Molly wanted to “explore other things.”Burke Magnus called her “a wonderful person and teammate,” adding that after ten years, she likely wanted a fresh start. “It became less about her role,” he said,Molly Qerim’s sudden departure from First Take marks the end of a ten-year run that made her one of ESPN’s most familiar faces.

Skip Bayless speaks out for Jacksonville Jaguars two-way star Travis Hunter

Jaguars are not utilizing the rookie as much as Deion Sanders did at the Colorado Buffaloes

Revolutionize modern-day Pro Football

Unusual kid who likes football, video games, and fishing

No way should Travis Hunter have chosen to be baptized on a game-day morning - but here’s why he did

Little kid at heart—chasing footballs is like chasing frisbees

Also Read:

What started as a podcast episode about why Travis Hunter chose to get baptized at one o’clock before the Jacksonville Jaguars vs. Seattle Seahawks matchup on Sunday Night Football soon turned to what’s on the two-way star’s mind. Renowned sports commentator Skip Bayless centers his latest episode of “The Skip Bayless Show” on Hunter’s baptism. He also covers Hunter’s favorites—football, video games, and fishing—as disclosed by NFL legend and Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders. Bayless discusses how Sanders used Hunter to his best advantage. He also explores why Hunter may soon lose interest and say football’s not fun anymore if the Jaguars don’t use the cornerback and wide receiver combo more.On his latest episode, Skip Bayless strongly voiced his opinion on rookie two-way star Travis Hunter’s mindset before the Seahawks vs. Jaguars’ SNF game. Bayless shared, “The Jags are using him so little, especially on defense, where he is the most gifted, all-time gifted, that Travis Hunter is starting to lose interest. He's starting to check out mentally on the Jags.So, he was actually happy to be baptized on a game-day morning because football isn't taking that much concentration, focus, or pregame mental preparation. Nope. Not now. Now, I'm certainly not suggesting that getting baptized was any kind of protest on Travis's part.It was just a stunning indication of where his head is at or not at right now. It's not really into football right now.”Bayless further explained that after a big win against the Kansas City Chiefs, Hunter’s attitude before the Jaguars vs. Seahawks matchup was, “Hey, they're not using me that much anyway. Why not get baptized on a game day morning? Even after they had had one of the biggest wins in franchise history the previous Monday night at home against Kansas City. Why not get baptized before a 1 o’clock game against a very good Seattle Seahawks team in Jacksonville? Why not?”The Jacksonville Jaguars are currently not utilizing two-way star Travis Hunter to his full potential, especially compared to how Deion Sanders did at Colorado. This underuse is central to Bayless’s argument about maximizing Hunter's impact on the field. Bayless compared how Deion Sanders used Hunter at Colorado (87% offense, 83% defense) with how the Jaguars use him now (63% offense, 39% defense).“Last year at Colorado, my man Deion Sanders, spiritual to the core is Deion, he utilized Travis Hunter 87% on offense and 83% on defense. And Deion told me before this Travis Hunter draft that he would, if he coached Travis in Pro Football, utilize him. exactly the same way. And I am all for it 1,000%.Through six games so far with the Jacksonville Jaguars, Jacksonville has used Travis Hunter 63% of the time on offense. That's 24% less than Deion did last year at Colorado. And here's the killer — 39% on defense has Jacksonville used him. That's 44% less than Deion utilized Travis last year in college football on defense,” said Bayless.Bayless argues that Hunter has the potential to revolutionize pro football as a two-way player if the Jaguars utilize him as much as Sanders did. He asserts that minimizing Hunter’s defensive snaps is a mistake, and given proper opportunities, Hunter could achieve Pro Bowls on both offense and defense, possibly becoming the second-best cornerback after Deion Sanders. This emphasizes the main argument that full utilization is key to unlocking Hunter’s impact.Bayless shared, “Deion by far the greatest cornerback ever. Travis, potentially in his orbit in Deion's orbit, especially as a cornerback. But I'm going to say this again—what Jacksonville is doing to him, especially on defense, is just so wrong. Again, if given the correct opportunities, Travis Hunter will revolutionize modern-day Pro Football as a two-way player, offense and defense. Pro Bowls on offense, definite Pro Bowls on defense, where he will ultimately be the second-best cornerback who ever played Pro Football to his father figure, Deion Sanders. ”The long-standing journalist further shared what the NFL legend Deion Sanders told him about Hunter. “Deion said—well, it's a very unusual kid here. He likes three things in his world. He likes football. He likes video games. And he really likes to fish. Deion has told me that Travis Hunter can fish all day and all night and be totally content. And yet Troy (Aikman) added, as he talked about those three likes of Travis Hunters, he added—not necessarily in that order.As much as God has blessed Travis Hunter with extremely rare ability on defense and offense, just extraordinary ball in air ability, track ball, catch ball on both sides of the ball. So rare I get goosebumps even talking about it. But as gifted as he is, God did not give him football overdrive. God did not give him supreme dedication to football.Football's just something that comes pretty easily to him. Not that he isn't dedicated. Not that he practices hard. When it's time to practice, he practices. But his life doesn't revolve around football. It's something he really enjoys playing because he's really, really good at it and he enjoys winning and competing at the highest level.”Bayless further shared how to keep Hunter engaged in football: “Deion (Sanders)' point to Troy (Aikman) was and a point he has made to me is that you actually need to play Travis Hunter a lot to keep him engaged in football. He's so good at it and it does come so easily for him that you need to keep his interest peaked by playing him on both sides of the ball at a very high rate. He's one of those kids.He's got a lot of little kid in the big kid. He's still a little kid at heart. It's like chasing footballs is like chasing frisbees, you know? It's just like, ""Oh god, this is fun. I'm going to go snatch this ball out of the sky."" Like the catch he made on Monday Night Football on the deep ball from Trevor Lawrence. But if you don't play him, he's going to throw up his hands and say it's not that fun anymore.”",Skip Bayless spoke out on the Jacksonville Jaguars two-way star Travis Hunter's mindset before Sunday Night Football. Bayless argues that Hunter has the potential to revolutionize pro football as a two- way player if the Jaguars utilize him as much as Deion Sanders did at Colorado.

Breece Hall, one of the most popular and talented players in the league, has been dealing with strong trade rumors as his team, the New York Jets, continues to struggle in the new season.

'We got desperate': Rohit Sharma on what clicked at 2025 Champions Trophy

Former India head coach Ravi Shastri has shared his views on Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma 's future in ODI cricket, including their potential involvement in the 2027 World Cup, as the duo prepares to return for the upcoming three-match ODI series against Australia starting October 19. This marks their first appearance in India colors since announcing their Test cricket retirement earlier this year.Shastri expressed confidence in both players' abilities and their continued motivation to contribute to India's limited-overs cricket during his interaction with Fox Sports.""(Virat Kohli is) a master chaser, and Rohit is explosive at the top. They feel they've got enough cricket in them,"" Shastri said.The former coach emphasized that the players' longevity in international cricket would depend on multiple factors.""It depends how hungry you are, how fit you are, whether that passion for the game is still there. With their experience, it'll come in very handy,"" he stated.Regarding discussions about the 2027 World Cup in South Africa, Shastri advocated for a more immediate focus.""I would say take it one series at a time. It's still a long way to go,"" he commented.Shastri also addressed the possibility of the players deciding their own future in the format.""Virat retired from Test Cricket, as did Rohit. They were not asked to retire. They went on their own. I would think it's similar. If they're not enjoying it, if the form is not good, you never know. They might pull the plug themselves.""The BCCI has taken a clear stance on the matter, with Vice-President Rajeev Shukla dismissing reports suggesting the Australia ODIs could be the final international series for both players.The upcoming series against Australia holds significance as both Kohli and Rohit have retired from Test and T20I formats, making their presence in ODIs crucial for India's white-ball transition.Their performance in the three-match series will be closely watched to evaluate their potential role in India's future ODI plans, particularly with the 2027 World Cup in consideration.",Former India head coach Ravi Shastri has shared his views on Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma's future in ODI cricket.

Chaudary)

Twice in just two days, Pakistani teams received handshakes and high fives from their opponents—something you don’t often see with a Pakistan team these days. First, the Indian men’s junior hockey team extended High Fives and handshakes to their Pakistan counterparts after a match. Less than 24 hours later, the Pakistan cricket team handed reigning world champions South Africa a 93-run defeat in the first Test at Lahore, ending the Proteas’ 10-match winning streak—and were again greeted with handshakes.Yet, the celebrations were tinged with lingering resentment. On-air commentators Ramiz Raja and Aamer Sohail used the moment to drag India back into the conversation, revisiting last month’s Asia Cup controversy. During that tournament, Indian players had refused to shake hands with Pakistani counterparts on three separate occasions, sparking tensions that carried on even after India secured a five-wicket win in Dubai to claim their ninth Asia Cup title.Aamer Sohail remarked, “Good to see both teams shaking hands. It’s getting out of fashion these days.” Ramiz Raja added, “It’s getting out of hand,” before emphasising the tradition of sportsmanship in cricket and the importance of being “gentlemanly and fair,” even taking a jab at South Africa in the process.On the field, Pakistan’s win was emphatic. Shaheen Afridi led the bowling effort with 4/33, while left-arm spinner Noman Ali finished with 4/79 to bowl South Africa out for 183. Earlier, Tony de Zorzi’s maiden Test century and a fifty from Ryan Rickleton had propelled the Proteas to 269, still trailing Pakistan’s first-innings total of 378.Salman Agha and Imam Ul Haq both scored 93, narrowly missing out on hundreds, while Shan Masood and Mohammad Rizwan added crucial half-centuries. Pakistan’s second innings faltered with just 167, but Noman Ali ripped through South Africa’s middle order again, taking 6/112 and matching Senuran Muthuswamy’s earlier haul of 6/117.","Pakistani cricket teams received handshakes and high fives from their opponents.

Poll Do you agree with AB de Villiers' assessment that Team India has moved on from Mohammed Shami? Yes, it's time for new players. No, Shami should still be part of the team.

India pacer Mohammed Shami , who last played in the Champions Trophy and emerged as the country's joint highest wicket-taker alongside Varun Chakravarthy, has been left out of India's upcoming white-ball tour to Australia starting October 19, 2025. South African cricket legend AB de Villiers has suggested that Team India appears to have moved on from the 35-year-old fast bowler, who has been dealing with recurring ankle and knee injuries since the 2023 World Cup.Shami 's last Test appearance for India came in June 2023 during the World Test Championship final against Australia. Following that, he underwent surgery to address his injuries sustained during the 2023 World Cup campaign.Despite being sidelined from the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia due to knee issues, Shami made a strong comeback in the Champions Trophy in March 2025, delivering impressive performances for the Indian team.The experienced pacer has recently returned to domestic cricket but hasn't found his way back into the national team setup.""It is a big call from Team India. It feels like, in a certain way, they've moved on from him. I don't know the behind the scenes story, if there maybe a couple of niggles he's still carrying. Maybe he lost a yard of pace and he doesn't quite have that zip that he used to. Those could all play a part. It doesn't mean it's the end of the road for him,"" de Villiers stated on his YouTube channel.The former South African captain specifically pointed out observations about Shami's bowling speed in recent times.""If he can still find that extra yard of pace, as that is one thing I picked up - He lost a little bit of pace recently and maybe that is the reason why he is not in the national team anymore,"" de Villiers noted.De Villiers, who expressed his admiration for the Indian fast bowler, remained hopeful about Shami's potential return to international cricket.""He's a wonderful bowler. Always asks questions of the batters. He's a wicket-to-wicket bowler and a great asset to have in the team if he's in form, fit and raring to go. Obviously, it is very disappointing not to see him there as he's a very entertaining performer for Team India,"" the South African great commented.The non-selection of Shami for the Australian tour marks a significant period of absence from the national team for the veteran fast bowler, who has been a key figure in India's bowling attack across all formats of the game.The upcoming white-ball series against Australia represents another major international assignment where India will compete without the services of the experienced pacer, who has been an integral part of the team's success in recent years.Shami's current focus remains on domestic cricket as he works towards regaining full fitness and potentially making a case for his return to the national team through consistent performances at the domestic level.The decision to leave out Shami from the touring party to Australia indicates a possible shift in India's bowling strategy, with the team management possibly looking at younger alternatives for the fast bowling department.",Mohammed Shami has been left out of India's upcoming white-ball tour to Australia.

Australian cricket star Glenn Maxwell recently revealed his all-time ODI XI comprising players from India, Australia, and England, making some surprising selections while speaking to Fox Cricket. Initially picking David Warner over Sachin Tendulkar as an opener alongside Rohit Sharma , Maxwell later had to revise his choice due to team composition rules limiting the number of Australian players to five.Maxwell's initial selection for the opening partnership focused on creating a left-right combination with Rohit Sharma and David Warner at the top of the order.""Rohit Sharma has pretty good stats. he's got three double hundreds. 32 hundreds, averages 48, struck at 92 (strike rate). And I'm going to go Davey (David Warner) - average 45, strike-rate 97, 22 hundreds. Two pretty clear openers,"" Maxwell told Fox Cricket in a video.Maxwell explained his initial preference for Warner over Tendulkar, stating: ""Could've gone with Sachin, but I'm going to go right-left (combination) to start.""However, the limitation of including only five Australian players in the final XI forced Maxwell to reconsider his selection, as he had already chosen Ricky Ponting, Michael Bevan, Shane Watson, Glenn McGrath, and Brett Lee.Upon realizing this constraint, Maxwell acknowledged the necessary change: ""I might have to get rid of Davey.Davey goes, Sachin's in. To be fair, Sachin's got three times the runs.""The statistics supported Maxwell's final decision, with Tendulkar's impressive ODI record of 18,426 runs significantly surpassing Warner's 6,932 runs. Tendulkar's 49 ODI centuries also place him as the second-highest century-maker in the format.The final XI selected by Maxwell included four Indian players: Sachin Tendulkar, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli , and MS Dhoni, with the latter being chosen over Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist.Maxwell's bowling attack featured a combination of pace and spin, including Jasprit Bumrah and Anil Kumble from India, alongside Australians Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee.Notable omissions from Maxwell's team included several prominent players from all three nations, such as Kapil Dev, Yuvraj Singh, Andrew Symonds, Steve Waugh, Andrew Flintoff, Joe Root, and Ben Stokes .Interestingly, Maxwell's final XI did not include any players from England, despite the selection pool including cricketers from all three nations.The complete lineup of Glenn Maxwell's All-Time XI consisted of Rohit Sharma, Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, Ricky Ponting, Michael Bevan, MS Dhoni, Shane Watson, Anil Kumble, Jasprit Bumrah, Glenn McGrath, and Brett Lee.The selection came just days before India's limited-overs tour of Australia, with England also scheduled to tour Australia for the Ashes series following India's visit.",Australian cricket star Glenn Maxwell revealed his all-time ODI XI.

Brock Purdy could make his return to the San Francisco 49ers’ lineup in Week 7, and that possibility is already stirring buzz around the league. The quarterback has missed the past two games while recovering from a turf toe injury. According to head coach Kyle Shanahan, both Purdy and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall are expected to practice on Wednesday — a development that raises optimism about Purdy’s availability for Sunday’s game against the Atlanta Falcons.Brock Purdy has only played two games this season, and since he went down in Week 4, the San Francisco 49ers have leaned on backup Mac Jones. Despite some struggles on offense, oddsmakers still have confidence in the 49ers — they opened as 3.5-point favorites and remain 3-point favorites heading into midweek. That’s a sign many believe Purdy will return. At 4-2, the 49ers are in the hunt for the NFC West crown, and getting Purdy back could be a big boost. When healthy, he’s been one of the league’s most efficient quarterbacks, thanks to his ability to lead the offense, make plays on the move, and connect with top weapons like Deebo Samuel and George Kittle.In Purdy’s absence, the offense has lacked consistency. Mac Jones has held the reins for four starts and compiled a 3–1 record in that span.Still, Week 6 marked a low point: he failed to throw a touchdown and tossed two interceptions in a loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Bringing Purdy back this week could shift the offensive balance. His return would likely spark a more dynamic passing attack and reduce the burden on the ground game, which has been underwhelming without him.On the strategic front, Week 7 offers a critical momentum point. After facing Atlanta, San Francisco enters a stretch of NFC showdowns that could define their postseason path. Restoring Purdy to full health would be a major statement that the team isn’t derailed by injury.All eyes will be on Wednesday’s practice report. A full workout from Purdy could swing not just Sunday’s outcome — but the story of San Francisco’s season.",Brock Purdy has missed the past two games with a turf toe injury.

1. Don’t Go Lone Wolf

2. Stop Jumping Into Every Fight

How To Rank Up Fast In Fortnite Reload!

3. Respawn Like a Pro

4. Finish the Job, Always

5. Mobility = Survival

Final Tip: Squad Power = Win Power

If you hopped into Fortnite Reload thinking it’s just another casual mode, then you’re in for a surprise. Reboots flying, squads sweating, and someone named “NoScopeBaby” just wiped your team. It’s not that deep. Winning ranked matches here isn’t about aim-botting everyone; it’s about playing smart, staying alive, and knowing when to run like your Wi-Fi’s lagging. So, here are tips on how to easily win ranked matches in Fortnite Reload:Reload is squads-only, so forget that “I’ll solo clutch this” energy. If you don’t have your gang, hit that Squad Fill button. Randoms might not talk, but at least they can keep you alive.Stick close to your team like you’re glued, because if one of you survives, everyone respawns. Split up, and well… you’ll be spectating faster than you can say “where’s my reboot card?”You don’t have to push every sound you hear. Half the lobby dies because someone couldn’t resist third-partying a fight that wasn’t theirs. Early game? Loot, chill, and stack shields. Let the storm and other players do the dirty work. Once respawns turn off in the final circles, that’s when you go full demon mode.Until then, survive.Got knocked? Don’t start rage-quitting yet. In Reload, you respawn in 30 seconds, no reboot vans, no crying over lost loot. Use that time to ping where you died, grab your gear back when you drop, and help your team from the skies. You’re not useless, you’re basically a respawning drone with revenge issues.Killed three enemies? Great. But if one’s still crawling around somewhere in a bush, their entire team’s coming back in 30 seconds. Hunt that last survivor down like your life depends on it (because it literally does). Don’t let them sneak a reboot and ruin your vibe.Always keep something that helps you dip fast Shockwaves, Grapplers, whatever. Reload fights turn messy in seconds. Running away isn’t cowardly, it’s just smart math: 1 alive teammate = full team back soon. Escape now, flex later.Four players sticking together = death laser. If your team spreads out, you’re done. Play tight, cover each other, and when it’s time, push as one.Winning in Reload ain’t about cracked aim or sweaty edits; it’s about vibes, timing, and teamwork. Play smart, stay annoying, and boom: Victory Royale secured.","Winning in Fortnite Reload ain’t about cracked aim or sweaty edits; it’s about vibes, timing, and teamwork.
