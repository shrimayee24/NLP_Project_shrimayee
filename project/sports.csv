NEW DELHI: Indian skipper Harmanpreet Kaur 's experience helped secure a six-wicket victory for India against Pakistan in the Women's T20 World Cup, keeping their semi-final hopes alive on Sunday. Chasing a modest target of 106 runs, India struggled but managed to clinch the win thanks to Harmanpreet's 24-ball 29-run innings. She retired hurt with two runs needed to win, and Sajana Sajeevan, on her debut, sealed the victory with a boundary.Opener Shafali Verma (32 off 35 balls) and No.3 Jemimah Rodrigues (23 off 28 balls) adopted a cautious approach, affecting India's Net Run Rate (NRR) negatively.India's current NRR stands at -1.217, below Pakistan's -0.555. To keep semi-final hopes alive, India must win against Australia and Sri Lanka by significant margins.The Indian innings included only five boundaries, and the top three batters struggled to accelerate. With Smriti Mandhana out early, Shafali and Jemimah focused on singles.The heat impacted the running between the wickets, with easy doubles and triples left unattempted. Shafali's fitness issues and Jemimah's reliance on timing over power added pressure on the batting unit.Harmanpreet took charge after the dismissal of Jemimah and Richa Ghosh off consecutive deliveries by Fatima.Earlier, Indian bowlers contained Pakistan to 105 for 8. Renuka Singh Thakur (1/23) and Arundhati Reddy (3/19) maintained discipline in their line and length. Off-spinners Deepti Sharma (1/24) and Shreyanka Patil (2/12) focused on varying their pace.Leg-spinner Asha Sobhana (1/24) took the wicket of Pakistan skipper Fatima, thanks to a sharp catch by Richa Ghosh.India restricted Pakistan to 29 for 2 in the powerplay. Nida Dar's 28 runs provided some resistance but were insufficient to post a challenging total. Indian bowlers delivered 58 dot balls, reflecting their control over the game.India now needs to capitalize on this win and maintain momentum in their upcoming matches to advance to the semi-finals.","India beat Pakistan by six wickets to keep semi-final hopes alive.

Jody Fortson’s rejoining has sparked speculation on social media about Travis Kelce’s replacement

Kansas City Chiefs have signed tight end Jody Fortson off their practice squad. Fortson rejoined the Chiefs last week after spending the offseason and training camp with the Dolphins. He has not appeared in a regular season game since 2022 but has been with the Chiefs since 2019 before signing with Miami in free agency in March. In 19 career games, Fortson has 14 receptions for 155 yards and four touchdowns.Also Read: Billy Shaw, Pro Football Hall of Famer and Buffalo Bills great dies at 85 leaving a lasting legacy The Kansas City Chiefs have added Jody Fortson to their active roster, following his undrafted free agent status in 2019.Fortson played for the Chiefs in the 2021 and 2022 NFL seasons. He signed a $1.125 million deal with the Miami Dolphins but was released in August. The addition of Fortson has sparked speculation on social media about Travis Kelce, who has not been productive this season, and whether Fortson is Kelce's replacement.""Travis playing so bad they gotta active Jody fortson"", said one fan. ""Travis Kelce's career is over"", added another. ""How much help does Mahomes need?"", added another. ""He’ll somehow end up with 5 for 80"", said one fan while projecting Fortson's production. Kelce, despite a slow start, played a crucial role for the Chiefs in Week 4's win against the Los Angeles Chargers, completing seven receptions for 89 yards on nine targets. With injured Rashee Rice, Kelce will be utilized more, with Fortson potentially taking on the blocking role.Fortson signed with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2019. He was waived in August 2019 and signed to the practice squad. Fortson remained on the practice squad until the Chiefs won Super Bowl LIV. He resigned in February 2020, was waived in September 2020, and signed to the practice squad. He resigned in February 2021 and was added to the Chiefs' active roster in August 2021.Jody Fortson has played 19 games for the team, averaging 14 receptions for 155 yards and four touchdowns. With injured wide receivers, the Chiefs will heavily rely on running the ball and tight ends. Fortson, Kelce, and Noah Gray will play a significant role in the coming weeks. The presence of three tight ends will open up the field for wideouts like Xavier Worthy and help the Chiefs' running game, led by Kareem Hunt. The Chiefs are 4-0 heading into Week 5.Travis Kelce had faced criticism despite the fact that the Chiefs won against the Bills with a score of 22-17. The first three games did not help his cause with catching only eight passes for 69 yards, which is unusually low given his standards. Even before these games, it was one of his worst years because he did not exceed 1,000 receiving yards. As the season progresses, it will be intriguing to see what plays out, and if Kelce keeps missing his mark.Also Read: “A good frame job for a little 15 seconds of fame”: Mason Rudolph has cleared the air on a viral direct message exchange with Amanda Vance","Kansas City Chiefs have signed tight end Jody Fortson off their practice squad.

'Forget this-ball or that-ball': Gavaskar offers new name for India's Test approach,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/bangladesh-in-india/foot-licking-of-the-highest-quality-sunil-gavaskars-stern-message-for-gautam-gambhir-backers/articleshow/114013618.cms,"(Photo by Gareth Copley/Getty Images)

NEW DELHI: India earned widespread praise for their aggressive batting approach in the second Test against Bangladesh in Kanpur. Despite two and a half days being washed out due to persistent rain, the hosts still managed to secure a comfortable seven-wicket victory on the final day.Former England skipper Michael Vaughan sparked controversy when he commented on India's aggressive batting, noting, ""I see India are playing Bazball .""Vaughan's comment, posted on X (formerly Twitter), referenced England's ultra-aggressive approach under coach Brendon McCullum, dubbed ""Bazball.""In his latest column for The Hindu, Indian batting legend Sunil Gavaskar took a sharp dig at certain former experts, without naming anyone, suggesting that the old powers are eager to claim credit for India's current approach.""Sadly, while the batting was thrilling and refreshing, the names given to the approach were the same old, same old. Just as any scandal is now called this-gate or that-gate after the Watergate scandal over 50 years ago in the United States of America, this Indian batting approach was labelled this-ball and that-ball after the term ""Bazball"" was coined for the England team's batting attitude. It was called this because ""Baz"" is the nickname of their coach, Brendon McCullum from New Zealand, who batted exactly as his team is doing - throwing caution to the winds in an attempt to score runs.""Sunil Gavaskar praised the Indian captain Rohit Sharma for his transformative impact on the team's playing style.""While one paper called the Indian batting ""Bossball"" because the captain or ""boss"" of the team, Rohit, had shown the way, some from the old powers referred to it as ""Gamball"" after the Indian coach, Gautam Gambhir . While the England batting approach changed completely under the new regime of Ben Stokes and McCullum, we have seen over the last couple of years that Rohit has been batting like this and encouraging his team to do so as well,"" he said.""Gambhir has only been coaching for a couple of months, so attributing this approach to him is foot-licking of the highest quality. Gambhir himself hardly ever batted in this fashion like McCullum used to do. If any credit is due, it is solely to Rohit and nobody else,"" he added.""Instead of using the words this-ball or that-ball, I would suggest using the skipper's first name, Rohit, and term it the ""Gohit"" approach. Hopefully, brainier people will come up with a trendier name for this rather than the lazy option of calling it after ""Bazball,"" Gavaskar further added.","Former England skipper Michael Vaughan sparked controversy when he commented on India's aggressive batting.

NEW DELHI: Harmanpreet Kaur-led India are gearing up to face New Zealand in their opening Group A match of the Women's T20 World Cup at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Friday. This marks the ninth edition of the tournament, with India still chasing their maiden T20 World Cup title. Their closest opportunity came in 2020 when they reached the final but were defeated by a dominant Australian side at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.Determined to put past disappointments behind them, India will look for a strong start to their campaign as they set their sights on erasing the memories of previous near-misses.Ahead of India's opening clash against New Zealand in Dubai, TimesofIndia.com spoke with Harmanpreet during an event hosted by Puma India. The Indian captain shared her thoughts on the team's title prospects, potential combinations, and more. Edited excerpts:You are putting pressure on us by saying this (laughs). We are really excited and want to give our best. The team has done really well and prepared a lot for this big tournament. We will not leave a single stone unturned. We are positive, and I am confident we will come through with flying colors.Yes, hopefully. That's our aim. As I said, we are prepared, we are positive, and we just want to go out and give our best. We always talk in the dressing room about how this is a great opportunity for us. I tell my team one thing: go and enjoy your game. That's it.If you ask me as a captain, all players are equally important to me. They have different roles to play on the field, and I know what they can bring to the table. For me, every single player is important. Whoever is in the middle must take responsibility and win the game for us.Earlier, the tournament was going to be played in Bangladesh, and now it will be held in the UAE. The conditions will be tough, and I will adjust the combinations accordingly.That's quite natural. It's not something exaggerated or out of the box. The aggression in me is natural. It drives me forward, and that’s how I've always been. Whenever I'm on the field, I just want to see my team win. This is the mindset I’ve played with throughout.Yes. She is the heart of the team. She’s always cheerful and ensures the dressing room environment remains lively. She keeps a big smile on every single player's face. It's really good to have her on the side. It's always great to have such players who bring energy to the team and the dressing room.It’s helping us a lot, just like the IPL helps men’s cricket. We've been waiting for this league for so many years. It's a massive platform for all women's cricketers. The WPL is a great stage and has brought a lot of talent to Indian cricket.

He started playing tennis ball cricket, which allowed him to make a living.Later, at his father's urging, he moved to Bengal, where his cricket career blossomed. The beginning wasn't easy. He made his Bengal debut in 2015, but injuries, loss of form, and a lack of opportunities meant he only started playing regularly by the 201819 season.His career skyrocketed after the 2019-20 Ranji season, in which he took 32 wickets, including 6/61 against Karnataka in the second innings of the semifinal, bringing him to the national selectors' attention.Post-Covid, his life has changed for the better. Delhi Capitals bought him for Rs 5.5 crore during the 2023 IPL auction in Kochi, and last year he made his debut for India in all formats.While he doesn't have the same pace as his Bengal teammate Akash Deep, Mukesh bowls that nagging length around off stump which troubles batters. He moves the ball both ways and, most importantly, can bowl long spells.So, what has he learned from his time with the Indian team? ""Being with seniors, you learn the importance of being disciplined. Rahul sir (former coach Rahul Dravid ) and the (former) bowling coach ( Paras Mhambrey ) gave me valuable tips but also made me realise that there's not much difference in terms of skills at the domestic and international level. It's more about mental games at the highest level-being able to deliver in conditions that may be tailor-made or completely alien for you,"" said 30-year-old Mukesh.While he lost his father two years ago, his family's support keeps him grounded.""The support of family matters the most in such situations. Mummy, bhai, they have always stood behind me. They keep telling me that all these (selection) are byproducts, but I should keep doing what I can and what I am good at.""Ever since I started bowling, if you give me a ball, I'm ready to bowl in any match. I grew up playing in the farms, so for me, respecting every jersey I wear and every ground or stadium where I play is extremely important. I'm still eager to play a match, anytime, anywhere,"" said Mukesh.Setting short-term goals is how Mukesh's career has progressed. Initially, his only target was to ""play for India,"" and now that he has achieved that, he wants to test his skills in different countries and conditions. During the Zimbabwe T20I series, he bowled well and showed the selectors what he can do in unfamiliar conditions. Mukesh has been thinking about bowling in Australia, and if that opportunity arises, he will be ""ready"" for sure.",Mukesh Kumar was the best Rest of India pacer on display during last week's match in Lucknow. The right-arm pacer had a decent outing for India B in the Duleep Trophy. Delhi Capitals bought him for Rs 5.5 crore during the 2023 IPL auction.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114029004,imgsize-31520,width-400,resizemode-4/114029004.jpg"

ABU DHABI: Ireland captain Paul Stirling led from the front with a dashing 88 as his side completed their ODI series against South Africa with a convincing 69-run win in the final match in Abu Dhabi on Monday.Chasing 285 to win, South Africa slipped to 126/6 with only a fine 91 from Jason Smith keeping them in the game.But Smith was unable to prevent the Irish from claiming only their second ODI win over the Proteas.""It's a relief to get past it,"" said Stirling.""We talked about just winning the game and getting the job done. We let ourselves down in the first two games. We knew if we applied ourselves and kept our wickets in hand we'll get the runs.""Graham Hume, who was born in Johannesburg and played for South Africa Under 19s, was the pick of the Irish bowlers with 3-29 while Ulster-born Craig Young finished with 3-40.South Africa took the ODI series 2-1 with the two sides sharing the preceding T20 series 1-1.Stirling set the tone for Ireland's 284/9 after he won the toss and decided to bat.That was in contrast to the first two matches when Ireland chased, failing to survive past 32 overs as they made 132 and 169 in reply to big South African scores.On Monday, Stirling and Andy Balbirnie put on 101 for the first wicket before Balbirnie fell to Lizaad Williams for a steady 45 from 73 balls.Curtis Campher accelerated with 34 off 36 balls before he fell to Ottneil Baartman who then bowled Stirling in his next over. The captain had hit three sixes and eight fours in his innings.Harry Tector kept Ireland moving with a 48-ball 60 while Williams, the only South African bowler to get through his full 10 overs, finished with 4-56.South Africa's reply was soon in disarray at 10/3 as Mark Adair removed Ryan Rickelton and Rassie van der Dussen, standing in for injured captain Temba Bavuma. Reeza Hendricks edged Graham Hume to Balbirnie at second slip.Kyle Verreynne (38) and Tristan Stubbs (20) steadied the innings with a 49-run partnership but once Verreynne was leg before to Young the wheels came off again.At 126/6 South Africa looked out of it but Smith made sure the Irish would have to wait.The 29-year-old from Western Province, who made nought in his only other ODI against Afghanistan last month, made the most of his chance after being drafted in following Wiaan Mulder returned home for personal reasons.Smith hammered his 91 from 93 balls with nine fours and four sixes before slicing Hume to Adair at third man.",Ireland beat South Africa by 69 runs to win ODI series 2-1 in Abu Dhabi.

Impressed with India's dominating T20I win on Sunday, former Pakistan batsman Basit Ali also wondered what happened to the Bangladesh team that registered a historic Test series win in Pakistan before travelling to India.""Is this the same Bangladesh team that whitewashed Pakistan (2-0)? You saw in the Test matches (against India). They lost the first one and then were defeated in virtually two days, even the rain could not save them,"" said the 53-year-old Basit.India hammered Bangladesh by 280 runs in the Chennai Test and then won in Kanpur by seven wickets, despite two days getting washed out by rain, to sweep the series 2-0.Basit was particularly in awe of India's back-up strength, saying the team of young Indian Premier League (IPL) stars led by Suryakumar Yadav made Bangladesh look like an ""appetizer"".""India have changed cricket (with their dominance). Bangladesh is just an appetizer (for them),"" said Basit.The T20I retirement of Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja has thrown open spots in the playing XI.""Yeh IPL eleven hai, India ki team nahi hai,"" said Basit, before pointing at the notable absentees from India's playing eleven in the match atGwalior . ""There was no (Yashasvi) Jaiswal, no (Shubman) Gill, no Axar Patel, no Rishabh Pant, no (Shreyas) Iyer; (Ravi) Bishnoi did not play. And still they hammered them in just 11-something overs, finishing with a six from (Hardik) Pandya.""India awarded two debut caps for the match, with fast bowler Mayank Yadav and all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy making their first international appearance.After bowling out Bangladesh for 127, India raced home in 11.5 overs for a seven-wicket win to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. Arshdeep Singh (3 for 14) and Varun Chakravarthy (3 for 31) took three wickets each, while Hardik top-scored for the hosts with his stroke-filled 39 off 16 balls, including 5 fours and 2 sixes.""Why did Suryakumar Yadav opt to bowl after winning the toss?"" Basit wondered. ""They should have batted on that 200-run flat track. I don't think they will make that mistake in the second match.""Basit was happy to see Mayank sending the speed gun into an overdrive and hoped he remains fit for India's tour of Australia. The speedster began his stint in the international arena with a maiden over while bowling at top speed.""There were two debuts, but it was a dream debut for Mayank Yadav. The first over was a maiden, including a 149.8 kmph delivery. He could not bowl in the high 150kmph only because he has just recovered from an injury,"" said Basit""Darr baithaya usne aaj (he sent down a scare). Batsmen were always on the back foot. I pray that this kid remains fit and goes on the Australia tour.""Mayank, (Mohammed) Shami, (Jasprit) Bumrah, (Mohammed) Siraj -- four pacers.

In his return match against Bangladesh in Gwalior on Sunday, he recorded his best figures of 3 for 31, contributing in India's seven-wicket victory in the first T20I of the three-match series.Despite a challenging start, conceding 15 runs in his opening over, Varun bounced back by dismissing Towhid Hridoy in his second over and Jaker Ali in his third.Following the match, Team India's head coach Gautam Gambhir was observed having an extensive discussion with Chakravarthy.The 33-year-old spinner, who recently worked with Gambhir at Kolkata Knight Riders during the IPL 2024 season, was joined by bowling coach Mornel Morkel as they continued their conversation off the field.Former India head coach Ravi Shastri speculated on the nature of the discussion, saying: ""You can see Varun Chakaravarthy having a chat with Gautam Gambhir. He took three wickets. Gautam could have seen a lot of him at KKR as well. He's probably just telling him about either the pace at which he was bowling, or the fields which he should bowl.

NEW DELHI: India's star all-rounder Hardik Pandya surpassed legendary batter Virat Kohli to set a new record for finishing the most T20I matches with a six. Hardik achieved this milestone during the first T20I against Bangladesh in Gwalior.In the match, Hardik showcased his all-round brilliance. With the ball, he claimed one wicket for 26 runs in his four overs, maintaining an economy rate of 6.50.While chasing a target of 128, Hardik provided the perfect finishing touch, smashing an unbeaten 39 off just 16 balls, which included five fours and two sixes. His blistering knock came at a strike rate of 243.75.One of the highlights of his innings was a no-look ramp shot over the wicketkeeper’s head, a stroke that exemplified his confidence and trademark swagger. Trusting his power, Hardik effortlessly sent the ball to the boundary.By finishing the match with a six for the fifth time, Hardik moved past Virat, who had achieved the feat four times.Additionally, with his solitary wicket, Hardik (87 wickets) overtook pacer Arshdeep Singh (86 wickets) to become India’s fourth-highest wicket-taker in T20Is.Yuzvendra Chahal remains India's top wicket-taker in the format with 96 wickets.As for the match, India opted to bowl after winning the toss. Bangladesh struggled throughout their innings, with skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto (27 off 25, 1 four, 1 six) and Mehidy Hasan Miraz (35* off 32, 3 fours) offering the only notable contributions. Bangladesh was bowled out for 127 in 19.5 overs.Arshdeep was India's standout bowler, taking 3/14. Varun Chakravarthy, making his return to the side after a two-year gap, claimed 3/31. Mayank Yadav, Washington Sundar, and Hardik Pandya each took a wicket as well.India's chase started with an unfortunate run-out of Abhishek Sharma (16 off 7). However, Sanju Samson (29 off 19, 6 fours) and captain Suryakumar Yadav (29 off 14, 2 fours, 3 sixes) put together a crucial 40-run stand for the second wicket. Hardik then combined with debutant Nitish Kumar Reddy (16* off 15, 1 six) to secure a comfortable victory with a 52-run partnership for the fourth wicket.Bangladesh’s bowling attack failed to make much impact, with Mustafizur Rahman and Mehidy Hasan taking a wicket each.Arshdeep was named 'Player of the Match' for his superb spell, which included the key wicket of Litton Das.

NEW DELHI: India's defeat to New Zealand in the Women's T20 World Cup, followed by an ultra-defensive batting approach in their chase of 106 runs against Pakistan, has dealt a significant blow to their chances of reaching the semi-finals.India managed to chase down the modest target against Pakistan on Sunday with some struggle, losing four wickets but with only seven balls remaining.Currently fourth in the group standings with one win and one defeat in two matches and a poor net run rate of -1.217, India face a critical path ahead.Former India fielding coach Biju George expressed disappointment with India’s approach during the crucial clash against Pakistan.""India should have come out all guns blazing,"" George said in an exclusive interview with TimesofIndia.com.India’s bowlers, led by Arundhati Reddy (3/19) and Shreyanka Patil (2/12), restricted Pakistan to 105/8 in 20 overs. However, the Indian batters failed to accelerate and took 18.5 overs to reach the target.""India bowled well, and their fielding was decent, though there were some fumbles and missed catches. But it was the batting that disappointed. With only 106 to chase, it was a great opportunity to boost the net run rate. India should have chased the target within 14 overs, which would have helped them tremendously,"" George said.They will next take on Sri Lanka and then the formidable three-time defending champions Australia. To stay in contention for the semi-finals, India must defeat Sri Lanka by a substantial margin and edge Australia.George is concerned that India’s negative net run rate will hinder their chances of advancing to the semi-finals. While he believes India can beat Sri Lanka, the match against Australia, on a tricky Sharjah pitch, will be much tougher.""Yes, India won against Pakistan, but the performance must have hurt them. They now face a huge task. If they don’t secure a big win against Sri Lanka, the match against Australia might turn into a virtual knockout,"" George added.""Playing Australia in Sharjah won’t be easy, especially defending totals on that ground. India will need to go hard against Sri Lanka and then find a way to beat Australia. That’s the only path to the semifinals now,"" he said.When asked whether India were underprepared for the tournament, George disagreed.""I wouldn’t say they were underprepared. They had a long camp before the tournament and entered as one of the title contenders. However, several players are carrying injuries,"" he said.""Pooja Vastrakar is injured, and based on Yastika Bhatia’s movement on the field, I believe she’s carrying an injury as well. Fitness is a major concern. In a big tournament like this, you can’t afford to have players with injuries or niggles. They need to be fully fit,"" he noted.However, George concluded with a message to the Indian team and fans: ""Believe. We can still do it.""","Former India fielding coach Biju George expressed disappointment with India’s approach during the crucial clash against Pakistan.

""I don't think that kind of match happened again."" These were the words of Dhanraj Pillay when a chat in 2020 around the India-Pakistan rivalry took him back to Amstelveen in 2003. Maybe, if allowed to pick from among India's most famous wins since the turn of the century against any nation, the former captain will now surely go with the bronze medal win at Tokyo Olympics instead of that Champions trophy match 21 summers ago.Down 2-4 in the good old 70-minute match against a team that had Rehan Butt flying down the flanks and Sohail Abbas shooting rockets off his flicks, India staged a comeback for the ages in 23 minutes of magic.The backstory for Pillay personally had a narrative of revenge from a year ago, when the Pakistan players celebrated in India captain's face following their 4-3 win in the third-place match in the previous edition of the Champions Trophy.To see his team scoring five goals in 23 minutes a year later to come back from the dead and win made the revenge for Pillay a lot sweeter.The heroes of the day for India were Jugarj Singh, Gagan Ajit Singh and Deepak Thakur , who scored two goals each. But it was Pakistan who took a 2-0 lead in the first 20 minutes with Butt and Muhammad Nadeem scoring. Jugraj scored India's first goal through a penalty corner four minutes later, but Mudassar Ali restored the two-goal cushion for Pakistan by making it 3-1.(Screen Grab: FIH)India got another penalty corner just before half-time, and Jugraj once again cut Pakistan's lead to one goal with his second strike.The teams went in at half-time with Pakistan leading 3-2.Drag-flick legend Sohail Abbas got on the scoresheet in the 42nd minute by finding the net on a penalty corner to make it 4-2.With 28 minutes left on the clock, India needed a goal to stay in the match and put pressure back on Pakistan.

The comeback stunned Pakistan who had no answer to India's full-press.Six minutes later, between the 60th and 65th, the trio of Indian strikers took life out of Pakistan defence that had no answer to their speed and Pillay's brilliant feeding from the centre.The legend let the young Indian stars take centrestage, and they didn't disappoint.Gagan scored two goals in the 60th and 62nd minute to make it 6-4 and Thakur sealed it at 7-4 in the 65th, as all Pakistan efforts of a comeback in the last five minutes were thwarted by India.The match stands as one of the most epic comebacks ever scripted in India vs Pakistan hockey history.","India staged a comeback for the ages in 23 minutes of magic.

NEW DELHI: The return of the uncapped player rule, which had been there since the inaugural edition and only went away in 2021, is a shot in the arm for the Chennai Super Kings CSK ) as it allows them to retain one of most sought-after players in the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) for just Rs 12 crores spread over three seasons.That's a short-change for a player like MS Dhoni and the value he brings to the CSK brand and team alike.The IPL Media Advisory on September 28 read, ""A capped Indian player will become uncapped, if the player has in the last five calendar years preceding the year in which the relevant Season is held, not played in the starting XI in International Cricket (Test match, ODI, Twenty20 International) or does not have a Central Contract with BCCI . This will be applicable for Indian Players only.""Talking on the ESPNCricinfo show, former Australia all-rounder and ex-Sunrisers Hyderabad head coach Tom Moody said, ""I think it's a great rule. I think it allows, if you are good enough and you have got longevity, it allows a player to continue to play on the big stage and perform and have some sort of role; without them, I suppose, you are making it difficult, from a price perspective, to retain those players because they might be the identity, or in Dhoni's case, certainly he is the identity of CSK. So, I don't think that's an issue at all. I think the longer the likes of iconic players like Dhoni can play in the IPL and can physically deliver like he has been, it's good for the tournament.""Moody added that the five-year rule can be further cut down to three years.""I personally think five years is a long time; I would like to see it as a three-year window. Once a player has played his last international game, I think if you are out of international cricket or you haven't been considered to play for India over that three-year window, you should be given the right of passage to be able to come in at that four-crow level,"" he added.Dhoni and the CSK top brass are yet to have discussions regarding his future after the retention rules were announced.The former CSK captain had said at an event that he would take a call on his future after the retention rules are announced.

Bouncy, red-soil pitch in Chennai

pushed to No. 5

There is just one cult in that dressing room…

NEW DELHI: The template has been set. The character has been written. Now it is a question of head coach Gautam Gambhir 's consistent approach. If that happens, the legacies of Indian cricket will be written and rewritten.Sunday's T20 game in Gwalior was another mini-step towards establishing the Gambhir era. Picking youngsters, bringing them in at the right moment, packing the team with all-rounders, and going hard in the T20 format are all traits of Gambhir's mindset.You just need to cast your mind back to his Kolkata Knight Riders days as captain and later as mentor or with LSG as their mentor and you will understand. KKR won IPL titles in 2012 and 2014. Those teams were full of all-rounders and multi-utility cricketers. Andre Russell, Shakib Al Hassan, Yusuf Pathan, and Lakshmi Ratan Shukla were all part of KKR. Around them, other players like Rajat Bhatia, Piyush Chawla, and Vinay Kumar could add value in more than one department.Cut to the current T20 setup - Hardik Pandya , Washington Sundar, Axar Patel, currently-injured Shivam Dube, and new-kid-on-the-block Nitish Reddy all tick the box. Others who add value are Rinku Singh and Riyan Prag. The brand of cricket is fearless, something that three times IPL-winning captain and coach Gambhir has always professed.Another aspect that Gambhir swears by is the role of bowlers. ""Batters setup games, bowlers win you titles,"" he would say and ardently maintain. He'd always advocate for playing Test matches with 5 bowlers. Even in white ball format he will make sure that there is a large and rich pool of bowlers.Getting Mayank Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, Harshit Rana and Yash Dayal in the squad is part of that initiative. While the Gwalior T20I provided a small sample the real deal was on show during the recently concluded Test series against Bangladesh.Leading 1-0 in the Test series, India could have easily played for a dull draw in the rain-affected Kanpur Test. But we saw a new India come out all guns blazing on Day 4, shattering records and reputations.At the very bottom of this approach was Gambhir - an aggressive, in-your-face brand of cricket. He has always maintained that for winning in sport you should be prepared to lose, a mindset India happily embraced in Kanpur. The team could have easily been bundled out for a low score while trying to make a match of it but they were willing to risk it.It seemed that Kanpur was witnessing T20 carnage in whites. The fastest 50, fastest 100, 200 and then 250 in Test cricket kept coming. But the real story lies beyond numbers and records.India opted to play on a bouncy, red-soil pitch in the first Test match in Chennai. They wanted to beat Bangladesh and test their own batters keeping the Australia tour in mind. They could have easily opted for under-prepared, rank turners as has been the case in the past while playing at home. Rohit and Co. need to be credited for that because from the England Test series at home earlier this year, the side has adapted to sporting tracks.There is nothing more important than winning for Gambhir. Even when he was Delhi captain more than a decade back, the left-hander opted to play on the spicier surface of Roshanara Club instead of placid tracks at the then Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium. He could have beefed up his numbers by playing at Kotla but he took the tougher route to help the team pocket crucial home points.The 'team first' approach was again on show in another move. Virat Kohli, the most celebrated batter of the team, was asked to bat at number 5 instead of his usual number 4 in Test matches. Rishabh Pant was sent ahead of him to press on the accelerator.Anyone who has followed Indian cricket closely will tell you that it is hard to get a celebrated batter to change his batting slot. Credit to Kohli as well that he happily moved down the order for a bigger cause. It is indeed a very relaxed and happy dressing room.This is not the first time that Gambhir has ignored the stature of a player and based his selection calls on the team's benefit. In 2012 before the IPL final against Chennai Super Kings , he dropped one of the top KKR batters Brendon McCullum. The move was forced due to injury to regular pacer Balaji and Gambhir had to play Brett Lee instead. He recently revealed in an interview that he apologised to McCullum in front of the whole KKR team for that call but he doesn't regret it as it was for the team's cause. That final was won by KKR.Gambhir has always preached and practised that Indian cricket should stop hero-worshipping. From his playing days to his time as a commentator he has been extremely vocal about this facet. One of his first speeches delivered during the KKR training camp earlier this year had this message too.""So people who played with me will know one thing about me, that everyone in this group will be treated equally. There's no senior or junior. There is no domestic or international,"" he said at Eden Gardens before IPL 2024 started. KKR went on to win the title this year with Gambhir as its mentor. He is following that in the Indian team too. There seems to be no preferential treatment to seniors as everyone plays for the team's cause.Gambhir is here to win, to recreate legacies, to play the team sport the way it is meant to be played. All he needs is consistency, courage and of course support of his players to walk this path.","Head coach Gautam Gambhir's consistent approach will be written and rewritten. Picking youngsters, bringing them in at the right moment, packing the team with all-rounders, and going hard in the T20 format are all traits of his mindset. He has always maintained that for winning in sport you should be prepared to lose.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114008783,imgsize-88932,width-400,resizemode-4/114008783.jpg"

I made some changes to my technique, tried something new, but it failed.""Speaking about his preparation for red-ball cricket, Rana said, ""For two years during Covid, there was no red-ball domestic season, so I focused on white-ball cricket. Now, I've shifted my focus back. My favourite is red-ball cricket, and I want to score more runs in it.""""UP team has a lot of talent. I've played against UP in Under-16. When the option came, I discussed it with the association and joined UP,"" he said.""I am never after captaincy, and I never demand it,"" he added.Asked about his comeback in the Indian team , Rana said, ""With the kind of tournaments happening these days, whether it's first-class or IPL, you must score runs in every format and tournament. I am looking forward to making a strong comeback""On retention in IPL, he said, ""I have been serving KKR for the past seven years. It's not in my hands if I will be retained; it's up to KKR management to decide. I haven't received any calls yet.

Nitya shows shades of famous brothers with 94 vs Oz Colts

Brief scores:

CHENNAI: 'Pandya' rings a bell on the Indian cricket circuit and there's a new Vadodara boy with the surname who is following the footsteps of the more famous ones - Hardik and Krunal.Nitya J Pandya took inspiration from the famous Pandya brothers when he moved to Vadodara chasing his cricketing dreams.On Monday at the MA Chidambaram Stadium , the 18-year-old turned heads not because of the familiar surname, but for his valiant 94 (135b, 12x4) in the second Youth Test against Australia U-19 .The left-handed batter hails from a small village called Anjana in Rajasthan. ""I had to travel a lot to reach my coaching centre in Jaipur, which was far from my village. So my father and I decided to move to Vadodara. At that point in time, the Pandya brothers became famous, and we took inspiration from that and shifted. For the past six years, we have been living in Vadodara. I train at the Motibaug Cricket Club ,"" said Nitya.Apart from Nitya's promising knock, half-centuries from KP Karthikeya (71, 99b; 9x4, 1x6), skipper Soham Patwardhan (61*, 120b, 6x4) and Nikhil Kumar (61, 93b, 7x4) powered India U-19 to a solid 316-5 on the opening day.After electing to bat, India faced an early setback when opener Vaibhav Suryavanshi was dismissed in the seventh ball of the day, caught behind by keeper Alex Lee Young off a short ball from Harry Hoekstra (2-29).Nitya, who usually opens the innings, walked in at No. 3 and quickly set the tone by punishing left-arm pacer Harry for three boundaries - one driven through covers, another past mid-on, and the final one deftly placed to third man. However, Nitya soon lost his partner Vihaan Malhotra, who missed a sweep shot and was bowled by leg-spinner Vishwa Ramkumar.Nitya found an able ally in Karthikeya and the duo formed a strong partnership, adding 112 runs in 27.1 overs for the third wicket. Nitya carefully picked his shots to find the gaps and rotated the strike. This strategic approach not only helped him build his innings but also maintained the momentum for India.Nitya said the target for him was to play throughout the day. ""We lost an early wicket, so the focus was to not lose wickets. We were just focusing on building a partnership. We were not always eager to go for boundaries. Even if we were unable to hit boundaries, we kept rotating the strike. If the strike rotation is good, the opposition will automatically feel low,"" explained Nitya.Nitya eventually gave in to a short ball from Harry, who was making the most of the pitch, which offered low and inconsistent bounce. He mistimed a pull and was caught at deep square leg by Lachlan Ranaldo. A few overs later, Karthikeya followed him after giving a catch to mid-on fielder Aidan O Connor off Christian Howe.Following the sturdy groundwork done by Nitya and Karthikeya, the two new batters at the crease - Soham and Nikhil - kept the scoreboard ticking. The pair stitched a 105-run stand in 31.1 overs for the fifth wicket to further consolidate India's innings. As stumps approached, Soham closed the day on a high by striking Vishwa for two consecutive boundaries.India U-19 316-5 in 90 overs (Nitya J Pandya 94, KP Karthikeya 71, Soham Patwardhan 61 batting, Nikhil Kumar 61; Harry Hoekstra 2-29) Vs Australia U-19",Nitya J Pandya scores 94 in second Youth Test against Australia U-19.

SHARJAH: England put up an all-round show to outplay South Africa by seven wickets for their second successive win in the Women's T20 World Cup here on Monday.

NEW DELHI: South Africa's batting coach JP Duminy made an unexpected return to the field during the third and final ODI against Ireland in Abu Dhabi on Monday.Known for his distinguished international career before retiring from all formats of cricket in July 2019, Duminy was called upon to fill in as a substitute fielder due to fatigue and heat exhaustion affecting some of South Africa's players.The intense desert heat left several of the team's regular fielders struggling, prompting the team to look for immediate reinforcements.While it's unusual for a coach to step onto the field in an active game, Duminy’s experience and fitness made him an ideal candidate to temporarily fill the gap.Watch:His presence on the field added an interesting piece to the game, showing his willingness to step up for his team even in a non-playing capacity.Having lost their previous two games, Ireland, meanwhile, put up a strong fight in their final ODI of the series, with Paul Stirling leading the charge by smashing 88 runs.His partnership with captain Andy Balbirnie (45) helped Ireland to a much-improved total of 284/9, their highest of the series. Harry Tector also contributed a valuable 60, while Curtis Campher's quickfire 34 off 36 balls provided a boost in the middle order.Despite Ireland’s improved batting display, South Africa’s bowlers, especially Lizaad Williams, made crucial breakthroughs.Williams was the pick of the bowlers, taking four wickets for 56 runs in his 10 overs.Ottneil Baartman and Andile Phehlukwayo supported well, with two wickets each, ensuring South Africa remained competitive in the match.Duminy’s impromptu stint as a fielder, however, was the highlight as his enduring connection with the game and the lengths to which the team was willing to go to adapt to challenging conditions were on full display.",South Africa's batting coach JP Duminy made an unexpected return to the field during the third and final ODI against Ireland in Abu Dhabi on Monday.

Each match consists of five six-ball overs per side, with all players except the wicket-keeper required to bowl one over.



The batter must retire not out upon reaching 31 runs but can return to bat once lower-order players have finished their innings.



If five wickets fall before the completion of five overs, the last remaining batsman continues to bat while the fifth batsman acts as a runner, always taking strike until the sixth wicket falls, ending the innings.



This rule encourages aggressive batting and plenty of sixes, which is the hallmark of the tournament.



Wides and no-balls count as two runs.



Two points are awarded for match victories, making every game in the round-robin stage critical for progression.

NEW DELHI: Babar Azam 's struggles in Test cricket continued as the former Pakistan captain once again found himself in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons during the first Test against England in Multan on Monday.Despite Pakistan’s strong showing on Day 1, with Shan Masood (151) and Abdullah Shafique (102) putting up a mammoth 253-run stand, Babar failed to capitalize on a golden opportunity to silence his critics.Coming in at a comfortable position, Babar scored 30 off 71 balls, before being trapped lbw by England's Chris Woakes in the final session of the day.Woakes set him up brilliantly, beating him on both the outside and inside edges before delivering a full-length ball that nipped in just enough to hit Babar in front of the stumps.Babar reviewed the decision, hoping for a reprieve, but ball-tracking showed it was crashing into leg stump. The dismissal extended his poor run in Test cricket, leaving fans disappointed once again.What added salt to the wound was the reaction of fans in the stadium.Several spectators were caught on camera sleeping during Babar’s innings, a moment that quickly went viral on social media.Fans expressed their frustration online, trolling the Pakistan skipper for his continued lacklustre performances.Despite Babar forging a 61-run partnership with Saud Shakeel , his inability to convert starts into big scores is becoming a pattern that has fueled criticism, especially given Pakistan's dominance earlier in the day.Pakistan still ended Day 1 in a commanding position at 328/4, thanks to Masood and Shafique’s heroics. But with every failure, the pressure mounts on Babar to regain his form and silence the growing voices of doubt.",Babar Azam dismissed by Chris Woakes in the final session of the day.

KOLKATA: Beginning its journey with eight teams 11 summers ago, Indian Super League (ISL) has gradually expanded to 13 teams over these seasons.After being left out of the country's new top-tier ahead of the erstwhile premier division I-League, Kolkata giants Mohun Bagan and East Bengal were included into ISL at the start of the 2019-20 season. Then, honouring the AFC-AIFF envisaged future roadmap for Indian football, I-League champions Punjab FC were promoted to ISL last season.Keeping up with the promise, Kolkata giants Mohammedan Sporting Club - as the current I-League winners - were also added to the lot before the start of the ongoing 2024-25 season. However, despite being the country's highest level of competitive football, ISL is yet to achieve the desired level of fan following among the supporters of the participating clubs.However, Bhaichung Bhutia , the former India captain and one of the few legends to play the game in the country, believes that Mohammedan SC 's presence will add to the intensity of the Kolkata derbies , which in turn will make Indian football more exciting for the fans. The Sikkimese Sniper – as Bhutia was famously known in his playing days, also hopes that the huge fan-bases that come along with the teams like MSC will result in a wider popularity of ISL.""It's great for teams with a huge fan base such as Mohammedan SC to come into the ISL. I have always advocated for Mohun Bagan, East Bengal, and Mohammedan SC for coming into the ISL, because these are the teams that have huge passionate fans across India. To make the ISL competitive and interesting, you need those derbies and passionate fans to be there,"" Bhutia said in an exclusive interview shared with TOI.With talismanic India skipper and striker Sunil Chhetri hanging up his boots four months ago, Bhutia had a straightforward message for the youngsters who are shouldering the responsibilities of the Indian team under the stewardship of new head coach Manolo Marquez.""You need to be consistent with the national team. You need to start delivering, and it's teamwork. Obviously, you will have great coaches, but as a player there should be consistency in performances, and you need to keep working hard,"" Bhutia added.Asked to pick his favourite teams for the season, Bhutia said, ""It's difficult to predict the favourites for the title. Mohun Bagan (Super Giant) have put in a lot of budget to make a great team. Mumbai City FC, who didn't have a great Durand Cup, are a team that will always have a good side. FC Goa have been consistent throughout the years. I think these are the few teams that are going to be favourites for this season.""Over the years, ISL has moved on from its novelty factor as global stars - well past their prime - have stopped coming to India to join a developing league for a season or two. But Bhutia personally still loves to go down the lane when asked about his memorable moments from the league.""My best memory of the ISL will always be the first year, with some of the greatest footballers around the world coming and playing for us. In the first season, you had players like (Alessandro) Del Piero, Nicolas Anelka, Robert Pires, and a lot of big stars playing with our own local players!"" he said before signing off.",Bhaichung Bhutia believes Mohammedan SC will add to the intensity of the Kolkata derbies.
