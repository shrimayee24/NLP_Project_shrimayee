Mohammed Shami is on his way to recovery after undergoing surgery for an Achilles tendon injury he sustained during the ODI World Cup last year. The veteran India fast bowler, who is undergoing rehab at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru and only recently started rolling his arm over in the nets, took time out to appear on a podcast and shared some funny secrets from India's training sessions.With 24 wickets in just seven innings in the ODI World Cup last year, Shami not just topped the tally of wicket-takers in the tournament but also played a key role in India's unbeaten run to the final, where they lost to Australia.Speaking on a lighter note during the podcast about the little battles between the batsmen and bowlers during the Indian team's net sessions, the 33-year-old right-arm pacer said while Virat Kohli likes to get challenged, captain Rohit Sharma outrightly refuses to face him in the nets.""Virat se to mera hamesha se rehta hai ki hum ek dusre ko challenge dete hain (with Virat it's always like we challenge each other). He likes to hit good shots, I like to get him out. The bonding and the friendship reflects in that. It also helps you focus and put in the effort as you simulate (fielding positions), for example, two (imaginary) slips in place, two gully fielders. (So I challenge Virat) to come at me and score runs. We enjoy such things,"" said Shami.Talking about Rohit on the same subject, Shami smiled and said skipper ""mana kar deta hai"".""Rohit to pehle hi kehta hai 'mai isko khelna pasand nahi karta'.

His tenure with the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) saw the team rise from mediocrity to championship glory, clinching two IPL titles under his captaincy. Now, as the head coach of Team India, Gambhir brings with him a wealth of experience and a reputation for revitalizing struggling teams.Gambhir's knack for leadership was on full display when he led KKR to the knockout stages in his first year as captain and subsequently to IPL victories in 2012 and 2014.Now as the mentor, he brought the glory days back to KKR this year, though not single-handedly.With Ryan ten Doeschate orchestrating from behind the scenes, Gambhir had a man for whom he could, in his own words, even take a bullet.In a media interaction, Gambhir referred to Ryan ten Doeschate as the ""greatest team man"" he has ever played with. He recounted an anecdote from 2011 when ten Doeschate, despite having a stellar 50-over World Cup, carried drinks without a hint of disappointment. This act of selflessness left an indelible mark on Gambhir, shaping his own leadership ethos.""When I talk about selflessness, I have never said this in 42 years of my career, and I wanted to say this. The greatest team man I have ever played with, the most selfless human being, someone I can take a bullet for, someone who I can trust for life, and I can tell you this because in 2011, for my first game as a KKR captain, we only had four overseas players available, and this man had a fabulous 50-over World Cup. We went in that game with only three overseas players, and he was carrying drinks in that game with no disappointment on his face. He taught me selflessness. Ryan ten Doeschate. These are the people who made me the leader,"" Gambhir previously said during a media interaction.Born on June 30, 1980, in Port Elizabeth, Cape Province, Ryan ten Doeschate is a former Netherlands international, who has had a cricketing journey nothing short of remarkable.Discovered by Essex during a pre-season tour of South Africa, Ryan ten Doeschate's all-round abilities for Western Province caught their eye. His EU citizenship qualified him to play county cricket, paving the way for his impressive career.Standing at 5 feet 11 inches, the right-handed batting all-rounder and right-arm fast-medium bowler left an indelible mark on every team he played for.His impressive stats speak volumes: an average of 67 in ODIs, with five centuries and nine fifties in just 33 matches, and a strike rate of 132.92 in T20Is.In his IPL career, the part-time medium-pacer played 29 matches and took 2 wickets with a best bowling figure of 1/24 while maintaining an economy rate of 7.23.When it comes to his batting numbers, Ryan ten Doeschate scored 326 runs at an average of 23.29, with a highest score of 70* across 29 IPL matches.Ten Doeschate's talent took him across the globe, playing for clubs and franchise teams in the Netherlands, England, Australia, New Zealand, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, and Pakistan.In September 2021, Ryan ten Doeschate bid farewell to his illustrious cricketing career, announcing his retirement by year's end. His swan song came on October 20, 2021, in a final international match against Namibia during the group stage of the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.However, his association with the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL further cemented his reputation as a versatile and reliable player.What sets ten Doeschate apart is not just his statistics but his character. Known for his humility and dedication, he has often been described as the best associate player among non-Test-playing nations.His performances in the 2011 ICC World Cup, particularly his career-best 119 against England, showcased his ability to shine on the biggest stage.Yet, despite his individual brilliance, ten Doeschate remains a quintessential team player, always prioritizing the collective over personal glory.As ten Doeschate looks set to join Gambhir and Nayar in the Indian coaching setup, the anticipation for the upcoming tour of Sri Lanka is palpable.With Gambhir's strategic acumen, Nayar's all-around expertise, and ten Doeschate's selfless spirit, Team India is poised to benefit from a diverse and experience-rich coaching team.","Former India all-rounder Abhishek Nayar and former Dutch international Ryan ten Doeschate could join Gautam Gambhir as assistant coaches. The BCCI has not yet officially confirmed these appointments, but the cricketing world is already abuzz with anticipation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111889091,imgsize-36620,width-400,resizemode-4/111889091.jpg"

This makes him India’s leading wicket-taker in the ICC event and places him fifth overall globally.Reflecting on the 2019 World Cup, Shami recounted, ""In 2019 I did not play the first 4-5 games. In the next game, I took a hat-trick, then picked up a five-wicket haul and then four wickets in the next game. A similar thing happened in 2023. I did not play in the first few games and then picked a fifer, then four wickets and then a five-wicket haul again.""In the 2023 World Cup, Shami emerged as the highest wicket-taker with 24 scalps in seven games. He was only included in the playing XI after all-rounderHardik Pandya was ruled out due to injury.""The one thing I keep wondering is every team needs players who can perform well,"" Shami remarked. ""I took 13 wickets in three matches. What more do you expect from me?""During the 2019 edition, despite taking 14 wickets in fours matches, he was benched for the final league match against Sri Lanka and the semi-final against New Zealand, which India lost by 18 runs.Shami's bewilderment was palpable as he continued, ""I neither have questions nor do I have answers. I can only prove myself when I get the opportunity. You gave me a chance, and I took 13 wickets in three matches. Then we lost to New Zealand. Played four matches overall and picked 14 wickets. In 2023, I picked 24 wickets in seven matches.""In the 2019 World Cup, Shami was playing under the captaincy of Virat Kohli , with Ravi Shastri serving as the head coach.Shami's consistent performance when given the opportunity underscores the importance of utilizing players to their full potential, especially in critical tournaments like the World Cup.","Mohammed Shami expressed his confusion over team management's decisions to bench him during crucial stages of the tournaments.

Axar also mentioned that his IPL team, the Delhi Capitals (DC), has employed him in a similar capacity.""When the team needs someone to stand up, they are banking on me to deliver. That means they have seen something in me. When the team trusts you to deliver in such crunch situations, you start trusting yourself even more automatically. And once you deliver in one or two matches, it gives your confidence a different sort of boost altogether.""""It is not as if this has happened just once or twice. I have been asked to perform this role for Delhi Capitals and other teams as well. After a point, you get used to it and it does not matter which position you are batting in. You are confident in batting in any position and you know what to do in that situation,"" he added.Axar has had limited opportunities to showcase his skills on the international stage. Despite being a part of the squad for several years, he has only played in 14 Tests, 57 ODIs, and 60 T20Is. This is largely due to the presence of more experienced all-rounders like Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, who have been given preference in the playing eleven.The all-rounder is not looking too far ahead, as he is focused on short-term goals based on the roles he is expected to play.""It should not happen that I am asked to perform some role and my goals do not align with it,"" he says.

Maharashtra government

to make amends & announce reward to boost shuttler's morale before Paris Games

MUMBAI: Badminton player Chirag Shetty 's comments regarding Maharashtra government ignoring his achievements while rewarding cricketers from the state for winning the T20 World Cup have stirred up a hornet's nest.Chirag along with Satwiksairaj Rankireddy - the No.3 ranked men's doubles team in the world - played a crucial role in India winning their maiden Thomas Cup in 2022. Chirag, though, wasn't recognised for his effort. After seeing the cricketers being feted, the aggrieved shuttler told TOI on Sunday that ""if the state government can honour World Cup-winning stars, they should also honour him and treat other sports equally"".Besides the Thomas Cup success, Chirag has also won doubles gold at Asian Games , Commonwealth Games and bronze at World Championships. The 27-year-old Malad resident has now found support from prominent sportspersons of the city, who urged the state government to resurrect the situation by rewarding Chirag. Uday Pawar , coach and mentor of Chirag, felt that his ward's achievement is on par with that of cricketers and he should have been rewarded for it.Former India hockey captain MM Somaya said that he had sympathy for Chirag as ""winning the Thomas Cup is a truly historic achievement"". He went on to add that the state government can make amends by announcing a reward for him just before the Paris Olympics begin which will be good ""for his morale as well"".Pawar, a former Asian Games medallist and a prominent badminton coach in the city, said: ""I am not comparing sports but like the cricketers who have brought honour to Maharashtra, so has Chirag. I feel his achievement is on par (with the cricketers). A person who has brought honour to the state shouldn't be demanding but the state should recognise his efforts on its own.""He added that players shouldn't ask for recognition and instead the state government should have a mechanism in place where once they have achieved something of national significance, they should be rewarded.""I think the state's sports ministry should be more active. They should do their own homework and should be aware of who the top players from Maharashtra are. If they don't know about his/her achievement, then the ministry is not functioning properly. They should have people who will keep in touch with the respective associations from state and take updates on how their players are performing,"" said Pawar.Somaya said: ""I would fully agree with Chirag and I would quite understand his position. Since he was the only player from Maharashtra, he deserves the recognition. Need not be such a huge amount that they have given to cricketers but in some manner, he should be rewarded. He is seeking recognition from the state government which I think is only natural and I think it will be fair even if the state govt does it now. He is one of the key players from Maharashtra to participate in the Olympics and has a good chance of winning a medal with Satwik.""He also urged the state government to have a ""consistent policy"" to reward the performers from other sports as well. ""They should reward the players as soon as they know that someone from the state has achieved something big. It should be a standard process. A person shouldn't be applying for it. You should make a person feel a sense of pride when a state government recognises a player on their own,"" felt Somaya.","Badminton player Chirag Shetty's comments regarding Maharashtra government ignoring his achievements have stirred up a hornet's nest.
