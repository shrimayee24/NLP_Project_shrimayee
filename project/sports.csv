Bumrah discussed the difficulties Pandya encountered and the importance of mental resilience in dealing with criticism and adversity.Pandya, who assumed the captaincy role from Rohit Sharma just before the season began, was subjected to intense scrutiny and frequent booing from fans, particularly at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai Indians' home ground.The team's poor performance, finishing last in the IPL standings with only four wins in 14 matches, further exacerbated the situation.Bumrah stressed the importance of blocking out negative thoughts, a strategy Pandya employed during the challenging period.""We understand that we live in a country where emotion is really the talking point. It's an emotion-driven country. We understand that fans do get emotional, and players are also emotional,"" Bumrah stated. He acknowledged the impact of fan reactions on players, especially when playing in front of a home crowd.The fast bowler emphasized the difficulty of ignoring negative comments and boos, despite recognizing the necessity to do so.""It's not that simple saying 'just don't focus on it.' They're screaming, and you can hear it, but then, the inner circle helps you. We, as a team, don't encourage that, we don't promote that, we don't think that is warranted,"" Bumrah said.Bumrah highlighted the significance of team support and family during such times. ""Now, the world can think what they want to. We as a team were talking to him, if he needed support, his family will always be there. Certain things are beyond your control. If it happens, it happens.""The Indian pacer also pointed out the dramatic shift in public perception of Pandya following his outstanding performances in the T20 World Cup . However, he cautioned that the narrative could quickly change again with just one loss.Reflecting on the nature of sports and its emotional highs and lows, Bumrah remarked, ""You understand it now, because we play a sport that is so popular, every sportsman will go through these things. In football, you see fans booing the best players in the world. This is a part of the sportsman's journey, things will happen that are not great, sometimes, it might not be fair also, but it is the way it is.""Bumrah concluded by encouraging Pandya and others to take challenges in stride. ""We have had a great life, we're doing good things in our sport and for ourselves. All these challenges will come, but it will be better if you take it in the right manner.""","Jasprit Bumrah shares his thoughts on the challenges faced by Mumbai Indians skipper Hardik Pandya during the IPL season.

The city was on high alert. Heavily armed police personnel had started cordoning off the area close to the River Seine . This beautiful world city, which moves at a fast pace, had slowed down by the evening to welcome the Olympic Games home in an open ceremony.Not restricted to the confines of a stadium for the first time in its history, the opening ceremony was witnessed by many more than the normal thousands. Those who were not lucky to get tickets watched the spectacle on 80 giant screens as strategically placed speakers allowed the Parisians to enjoy the magical atmosphere.In an unprecedented move, all three Paris airports were closed as no-fly zone was imposed – from 6 pm to midnight – across northern France during the ceremony.The attack by arsonists on highspeed French railways, leading to fire on five lines, did cause some panic and led to a sense of apprehension, However, the spirit of celebration soon took over. The preparade show started at 4 pm at St Denis, which will be the venue for athletics. Rain took centre stage for a while as media persons and spectators scrambled to look for shelter. Those with umbrellas stayed put. It was merely a distraction.At the Trocadero, the makeshift stands slowly filled out and a festive fervour gripped everyone there as part of the history-making occasion. The river parade started at 7.30 pm and followed the course of the Seine, from east to west over 6 km. The riverside was full of spectators throughout this stretch.It started from the Austerlitz bridge beside the Jardin des Plantes and made its way around the two islands in the centre of the city (the Île Saint Louis and the Île de la Cité) before passing under several bridges and gateways.Greece, the hosts of the first Olympic Games, started it off followed by the refugee team under International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) flag.Athletes on board the parade boats waved at the fans in the riverside stands and the performers on the bridges. They got a glimpse of some of the official Games venues along the way before the parade came to its finale right in front of a gloriously lit Eiffel Tower.The Olympic flame was lit soon after that. The Games had officially begun. The opening ceremony was orchestrated by well-known stage director Thomas Jolly, who invited a stellar cast of local and international stars to celebrate the rich history and diversity of French musical culture.There were some very big names in the lineup. Aya Nakamura, France’s most listened-to singer, performed a Charles Aznavour classic, accompanied by the Republican Guard. Queen of ballads Céline Dion performed a song by Édith Piaf. American pop sensation Lady Gaga also graced the stage.Music flowed on a rainy Paris afternoon and the world across different time-zones stopped to celebrate a spectacle that it had been eagerly waiting for.","Not restricted to the confines of a stadium for the first time in its history, the opening ceremony was witnessed by many more than the normal thousands.

The first Test is scheduled for September 19 at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, and the second Test will follow on September 27 at Green Park in Nagpur.This decision suggests that Gill will also be Rohit's deputy in the home Test series against New Zealand in October and during the significant Border-Gavaskar series in Australia in December.BCCI chief selector Ajit Agarkar recently explained the reasoning behind Gill's elevation to the vice-captaincy role in white-ball cricket during a media interaction ahead of the team's departure for the Sri Lanka series.""With the T20 World Cup around, when Hardik Pandya got injured, it was a challenge. Rohit wasn't playing, but he was available to lead, which was fortunate. We don't want to face that situation again. Shubman is a three-format player who has shown quality over the last year or so,"" Agarkar stated.Agarkar emphasized the necessity for continuity and leadership development within the team.""You try and have somebody who can also learn from a couple of the senior guys that are there, like Surya or Rohit. We don't want to face the same challenges of suddenly trying to look for a captain in case of injuries or loss of form. Shubman has shown decent leadership qualities, and we want to give him the experience he needs to step forward. There are no guarantees in life, but that's the thought at this point,"" he added.The white-ball series against Sri Lanka, which starts on Saturday, will serve as a crucial test for both the new team management and Shubman Gill in his expanded leadership role.",Shubman Gill has been elevated to the vice-captaincy position for both the ODI and T20I teams.

NEW DELHI: Team India captain Suryakumar Yadav was recently reminded of a statement by the new head coach Gautam Gambhir during a pre-match press conference ahead of the first T20I against Sri Lanka in Pallekele. Gambhir, recalling their time at Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) a decade ago, expressed regret over not fully utilizing Suryakumar’s potential.In response, Suryakumar humorously suggested that the full potential could now be utilized.Reflecting on their past, Gambhir had noted that the team combinations at that time did not allow for Suryakumar to be placed at the No. 3 spot, a decision he now regrets. Suryakumar played for KKR in the IPL from 2014 to 2017 under the captaincy of Gambhir, before moving to Mumbai Indians ""A leader's biggest role is to bring out the best in a player. In my seven-year captaincy stint, if there is one regret that I have, it is the fact that we couldn't utilize the full potential of Surya. There were many reasons for it - the combination, etc. But, you can only play one batter at No. 3. As a leader, you think about the other 10 players as well,"" Gambhir had said in an interview with Sportskeeda.""If Surya had batted at No. 3, he would have been a lot more effective, but he was effective at No. 7 as well,"" he added.Responding to the comments, Suryakumar remarked with humor, ""Toh abhi kar lenge pura potential ko use (He will utilize his full potential now).""He praised Gambhir for his understanding and shared insights into their strong relationship as coach and captain.""Even when I say nothing sometimes, he understands what I want. So this bond is very special between coach and captain. I am very excited for this journey ahead,"" Suryakumar stated.Suryakumar, at 33, is currently leading the T20I team in Sri Lanka and has reunited with his former KKR captain with Gambhir now taking on the role of head coach of the Indian men's team. Since making his debut for India in 2021, Suryakumar has established himself as one of the top T20I batters in the world.In 68 matches, Suryakumar has scored 2340 runs at an average of 43.33 and a strike rate of 167.74, with four hundreds and 19 fifties.","Team India captain Suryakumar Yadav was reminded of a statement by new head coach Gautam Gambhir during a pre-match press conference ahead of the first T20I against Sri Lanka in Pallekele.

He will be 40 years old then. I mean, unless you are a super-fit person like MS Dhoni or Sachin Tendulkar , you can't play World Cup at 40s. Yeah, Virat Kohli could play in the 2027 World Cup, in my opinion, for sure. But for Rohit, Mr. Gambhir, you went overboard; he will faint in South Africa,"" Srikkanth said on his YouTube channel.Moreover, Srikkanth pointed out a perceived inconsistency in Gambhir's selection philosophy.""Gautam Gambhir has taken a U-turn. Before the T20 World Cup 2024, he was saying if Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma do not perform, they will not sit in my team. Then he took a U-turn now, saying there is no player like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. After becoming head coach, he said that both have a lot of cricket left and hopefully they will be fit for the 2027 World Cup,"" he added.Earlier, Gambhir had clarified during his first press conference as head coach that while he sees a considerable amount of cricket remaining for both Kohli and Sharma, the ultimate decision on their careers would rest with the players themselves.""One thing I can be very clear of is that both those guys have a lot of cricket left in them. More importantly, with the Champions Trophy (in 2025) and a big tour of Australia (from November 2024), obviously they would be motivated enough. Then, hopefully, if they can keep their fitness, the 2027 World Cup as well. But this is a very personal decision. I can't say how much cricket is left in them. Ultimately, it's up to the players to decide how much they can contribute to the team's success,"" Gambhir said during his first press conference since taking over from Rahul Dravid .This debate unfolds as India prepare for the upcoming cricket schedule, which includes a series against Sri Lanka featuring three T20 Internationals and three ODIs from July 27 to August 7, marking Gambhir's first assignment in the national colours.",Former Indian cricketer Krishnamachari Srikkanth doubts Rohit Sharma's ability to compete at such a level past the age of 40.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's veteran all-rounder Shoaib Malik has extended an invitation to the Indian cricket team to participate in the Champions Trophy 2025 , scheduled to be held in Pakistan.Malik emphasized the importance of keeping politics separate from sports, suggesting that any bilateral issues between India and Pakistan should be addressed independently of their cricketing engagements.""Whatever reservations there are between the countries, that's a separate issue and should be solved separately. Politics shouldn't come into sports. The Pakistan team went to India last year, and now it's a good opportunity for the Indian team too.

We're very hospitable people, so I'm sure the Indian team should definitely come,"" Malik told Cricket Pakistan Despite Malik's welcoming stance, there are reports indicating reluctance from the Indian cricket team regarding their travel to Pakistan for the tournament, primarily due to ongoing political tensions between the two nations.It has also been suggested that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) might seek to have their matches relocated to alternative venues such as Sri Lanka or Dubai.This development comes amidst a longstanding hiatus in bilateral cricket series between India and Pakistan, with the last series on Pakistani soil taking place during the 2008 Asia Cup .Since then, encounters between the two teams have been confined to ICC tournaments and Asia Cups, with their most recent bilateral series occurring in India from December 2012 to January 2013.The Champions Trophy 2025 promises to be a significant event, with Pakistan aiming to replicate their success from the 2017 edition of the tournament.

India vs Sri Lanka: Why Suryakumar Yadav is expected to take to captaincy like 'fish to water',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/india-vs-sri-lanka-why-suryakumar-yadav-is-expected-to-take-to-captaincy-like-fish-to-water/articleshow/112006293.cms,"NEW DELHI: With India gearing ready to embark on a new chapter in T20 cricket after winning the World Cup in June, much expectation surrounds Suryakumar Yadav 's captaincy in the three-match series against Sri Lanka that starts this Saturday in Pallekele.R Sridhar, the former fielding coach for India, saw Suryakumar's debut in Twenty20 international cricket in 2021 and is optimistic about the batsman's ability to lead by example because of his cool head and collected nature.""Surya has matured a lot from what I know of him from the earlier days, when I was at the National Cricket Academy (NCA), where he used to come as a young athlete, who was very aggressive and very upbeat. But now, if you see, he's much more mature. He's got a much more mellowed head on his shoulders, and he's an astute thinker of the game.""""I mean, he might not have led many matches over franchise cricket, or even for India - he's led about eight games. I remember doing commentary in one of the India-Australia series, where he did a tremendous job. He also did a fabulous job in South Africa in the very short rain-curtailed series which he captained.""Mind you, captaincy is not only about leading the team on the field. Captaincy is all about keeping your players in good space, even off the field, having those right conversations with them, and making sure that each and every player, who's not just only in the squad, but also outside the squad, on the fringe of making it to the eleven, they're also in good space, and they're also well taken care of.""So captaincy brings a lot more onto the table for Surya. It is going to be challenging initially, but I think Surya is someone who'll take to it like fish to water,"" says Sridhar in an exclusive conversation with IANS, facilitated by Sony Sports Network.When Suryakumar was named Mumbai's captain for the 2014-15 domestic cricket season, it was his first taste of leadership. However, it was a lackluster period, and rumors about his irascible persona leading to indiscipline meant Suryakumar missed out on the Mumbai leadership position.Mumbai restored Suryakumar as captain in 2019 after the calm and collected man turned a new page in his life, especially when it came to obtaining that India cap. From 2019 to 2021, he would captain Mumbai in 16 Twenty20 matches for the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.Sridhar thinks Suryakumar has what it takes to lead India as captain, but he needs to concentrate on picking the best playing eleven and communicating well.""He's got all the wherewithal to be a successful captain. But now that the captaincy is a full-time thing, with that comes more pressure, because his communication has to be more spot on. He needs to know what combination he needs. Obviously, he needs to gel with the new coach, Gautam Gambhir , who is also a no-nonsense person.""Sridhar claims that Suryakumar benefited from playing for the national team under Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma as well as from being Gambhir's vice captain for the Kolkata Knight Riders. ""The fact that Surya knows Gautam Gambhir very well from his days in KKR, before 2017 and 2018, that should hold him in good stead.""""The fact that he's played a lot of cricket under Rohit, and to an extent, under Virat, should have been a good learning for him. It should have been a good internship for him, watching them, observing them, how they go about captaincy.Normally, India vs. Sri Lanka matches would be low-key events, but there's an air of intrigue because both sides have new captains and coaches for the Twenty20 International series. ""That's what makes this series very exciting I guess, because it's the beginning of a new chapter in Indian cricket. We must say this because, especially in the T20 format, not just the coach is new, the captain is (also) new.""We're not going to be having Kohli, Rohit and Jadeja anymore in this particular format. So it opens up the opportunity for many of our intern youngsters to kind of take the legacy forward going ahead in the next T20 World Cup (which) is in India (in 2026).""So they have a good two years to kind of gel and set a platform, play a certain brand of cricket, and have a certain philosophy with which they will play this particular format. That is what makes this series very interesting, because this is where the foundation is going to be laid for that philosophy and vision,"" concluded Sridhar.",R Sridhar says Suryakumar Yadav has what it takes to lead India as captain.

From 2014 till now, it has been exactly 10 years. In 2018, I joined another (IPL) franchise and he joined another franchise. But we used to talk regularly about the game.

We used to discuss the game to see if we could do better in that match.""""The learning has been going on since six years when I was not with him. This bond is always special.

""I always think that what I have learned from Rohit Sharma, is he was always like a leader on the ground and off the field.""""He was not like a captain. There is a lot of difference in both.

It will be a full-strength Indian team for the series, how do you see the series panning out?

The Lankan team couldn’t perform to their potential in the 2023 ODI World Cup and also the recently-concluded T20 World Cup in the Caribbean. What are the reasons that the team isn’t able to convert their immense potential into desired results?

In

Yashasvi Jaiswal

, India has a left-handed, top-order batsman in the aggressive mould just like you. What’s your take on him and the progress he has made so far?

You were a pioneer in terms of aggressive batting at the top of the order. How would you’ve countered a bowler like

Jasprit Bumrah

, who seems to get the better of every batsman in contemporary cricket?

Sri Lanka too is known to produce unique bowlers. Even in the present team, you’ve Pathirana, Theekshana, Hasaranga… how do the Lankan bowlers manage to retain their uniqueness, considering there is a tendency among coaches at different levels to coach a talent too much?

There are changes at the management level in the Indian team with

Gautam Gambhir

assuming the role of head coach,

Suryakumar Yadav

getting the T20 captaincy, and Shubman Gill being elevated as the vice-captain in both limited-overs formats. What do you make of these changes?

NEW DELHI: With the Olympics going on, the India-Sri Lanka limited-overs series has hardly raised the fervour among fans. Sanath Jayasuriya , the interim head coach of Sri Lanka, however, believes the series holds “massive importance” for young players from both sides. The Lankan legend spoke to TOI on a number of topical subjects related to the two teams in this exclusive interview.We know how good they (India) are. They are playing really well – in the IPL, in the T20 World Cup . If someone isn’t playing well, the other one is taking responsibility. We have a tough task in hand, but I am confident that our players can win the series.In the T20 World Cup, our batters were in good form, they were getting starts but weren’t able to convert the starts into big scores. There were some little things that we were missing. The players also know that. Batters need to fire and fire big to win a match. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen. In this series (against India) when our batters get starts, they need to convert those starts into big scores. We have a good bowling side which can win us games.Jaiswal is another great talent from India. He has the passion and the want to do well, and to do that he has been working very hard. He has made sacrifices and is a dedicated kid, that’s why he is performing. I have heard about his work ethic, and that’s quite impressive. Recently, we had a session with Zubin (Bharucha), the director of high performance at Rajasthan Royals , and he told us how hard Jaiswal trains.He (Bumrah) is a unique bowler. We need to respect him and his skills. On his day, you’ll need to respect him, but then there are days when he is not up to the mark, it’s on those days you need to capitalise. Bowlers like him are on top because they’ve clear thinking in what they want to execute.We always tell the bowlers to keep their natural way of bowling. We don’t change much, but we make sure that they learn from their mistakes. Pathirana, for example, has also learnt a lot while playing for Chennai ( Chennai Super Kings ) in the IPL. He has improved a lot under (MS) Dhoni’s captaincy. Sri Lanka Cricket is also working with them quite a lot. We just make sure that we continue giving them confidence.All these changes have been made thinking about the future. They (India) are backing their players and giving them opportunity with responsibility. That’s how progress is made.","Sanath Jayasuriya is the interim head coach of Sri Lanka.

'The same train will go ahead': Suryakumar Yadav ahead of first T20I against Sri Lanka,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/the-same-train-will-go-ahead-suryakumar-yadav-ahead-of-first-t20i-against-sri-lanka/articleshow/112047417.cms,"NEW DELHI: Suryakumar Yadav , who has recently been named as the captain of the Indian T20I team, made a statement on Friday. He emphasized that the team will maintain the aggressive style of play that was a signature of the previous captain, Rohit Sharma 's tenure.India adopted a revolutionary attacking approach starting from the ODI World Cup held in their home country last year, under Rohit's leadership.This aggressive brand of cricket continued to be the team's hallmark even after the World Cup victory in the Americas, where Rohit bid farewell to T20I cricket.“The same train will go ahead; only the engine has changed and the bogies remain unchanged,” PTI quoted Suryakumar as saying on the eve of the first of the three T20Is against Sri Lanka in Pallekele.“Nothing changes; the brand of cricket remains the same. It (the captaincy role) doesn't change anything. It has given me an added responsibility. It is good that now I can do a 'walk the talk',” he added.Suryakumar expressed his desire to follow the approach that Rohit had established during his tenure as captain. He aimed to emulate the leadership style and strategies that Rohit had implemented.""What I have learnt from Rohit is that he was always a leader on the ground and off it,” he said.“He was not just a captain — there is a lot of difference between the two. He was a leader who stood in the middle of the group and showed people the way.""How to play T20 cricket and how to win a tournament? That is what I have learnt from him,"" he elaborated.Suryakumar, who was chosen as India's captain over Hardik Pandya, the vice-captain for the T20 World Cup, stated that Pandya's responsibilities within the team will not change.“Hardik's role has always been the same. He is a very important player for the team. The way he performed in the World Cup, I hope he will continue to do the same,” he said.Suryakumar expressed his desire for up-and-coming talents like Riyan Parag and Rinku Singh to showcase their skills and perform well during the upcoming matches against Sri Lanka. He believes that these young players have the potential to make a significant impact on the series.“Three players have retired (and) it will be difficult to fill the shoes. But new players have obviously practiced a lot and played a lot,” he said.“They are already doing well when they play franchise cricket and they have also done very well in the matches they played for India. I have a lot of faith in them that they will do well.""Suryakumar Yadav, reflecting on his past, acknowledged that he has undergone a significant transformation over the last decade. It was a time when he relinquished his role as the captain of the Mumbai team due to his inappropriate behaviour towards his fellow players during matches.“I think it is a complete swap. If you say 2014, it is almost 10 years now. In 10 years, a lot of things will change. You become a different person altogether. You get to learn a lot of things. I am also a completely changed man now,” he said.“In 2016, I got married. So, absolutely, you have to change after that as well. But yeah, things are completely different now,” he added.Once again, Suryakumar underlined the influence of Rohit on him.“I got to learn a lot of things from different captains I played under and obviously, Rohit Sharma, I have been playing with him for the last six years. There are a lot of learnings taken from him and in my own style, we will take the ship forward,” he said.Suryakumar, a key player in the Indian team, recently addressed comments made by the newly appointed head coach, Gautam Gambhir. The coach had expressed his regret for not fully utilizing Suryakumar's potential during their time together at the Kolkata Knight Riders franchise.However, Suryakumar remained optimistic, stating, 'there was enough to make a turnaround'. This suggests that despite the missed opportunities in the past, he believes there is still ample time and scope for him to showcase his skills and make a significant impact in the team.“We can fulfil that potential together now,” he said with a smile.“Our bond has always been special. We have talked a lot. We both understand what we want to say just by our body language.“Sometimes, even without expressing anything, we understand what each of us want to say. I am very excited for this journey. Let's see what happens,” he said.","Suryakumar Yadav has been named as the captain of the Indian T20I team. He says that the team will maintain the aggressive style of play that was a signature of the previous captain, Rohit Sharma's tenure.

Lancashire is a very historic county with a long history of welcoming Indian players to their Club,"" Iyer said in a statement.""To test my skills in both one-day and first-class cricket in English conditions is going to really benefit my game.

However, Styris believes that the talented Indian cricketer must demonstrate greater consistency in his performances.The Indian selectors opted for Suryakumar Yadav to lead the T20I team against Sri Lanka instead of Pandya.Chief selector Ajit Agarkar explained the decision, stating that he ""wanted someone who was likely to be available more often.""""This champion all-rounder (Pandya) has got as many skills as anyone. He's probably in a similar ability-zone as someone like Ben Stokes. He's got much more talent than that (his recent performances),"" Styris told PTI Videos in an interview.Styris had no doubt about Pandya's talent, but the Kiwi urged him to bring more consistency to his performances.""He is a phenomenally skilled cricketer. But he hasn't quite shown it yet as consistently enough for my liking. So, just let him get out there and just say, you've got to lead us now by your performance,"" he said.""I think the skills that Indian fans need to see from him now is being available all the time on the field and then delivering those performances with both bat and ball.""For that, Styris wanted Pandya to maintain peak fitness more consistently.""I want to see him get his body right and be that dominant all-rounder that we know. Bowling is really hard work and he is someone who's got all the skills and talent.""I want to see him be that genuine all-rounder and as someone whom you can rely on with both bat and ball, not just the odd over here with the ball and come in with a cameo,"" said Styris.Styris said left-arm all-rounder Axar Patel would play a crucial role in India's T20I and ODI series against Sri Lanka.""I'm a huge fan of Axar Patel. I picked him in my World Cup squad (of India) during the IPL. He's one of those players who always gets in the fight, always gets in the contest.""His bad games are pretty good and you can rely on him. That's why we often see him floating up and down the order.""Throughout the IPL, we wanted Axar to move up the batting order for Delhi (Capitals) because their top order wasn't going that well. It was pleasing that he did get that opportunity with India,"" he added.Styris expressed his desire for Rinku Singh to be given more opportunities in the Indian team. Despite Rinku's impressive performances, he was not included in India's 15-member squad for the upcoming T20 World Cup.""I would still like to see Rinku come in first. The way he's performed for India, he hasn't done anything wrong. Just continue to let him do that role. But then if there's another opportunity, Axar certainly would be a floater in my team,"" he said.The former all-rounder praised Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Ravindra Jadeja for their well-timed decisions to retire from T20 International cricket.""I think it was the perfect time for those three to step away. It's a real opportunity for India to give some experience to the next generation of players.""Styris praised the young Indian cricketers for their immense talent, which they've demonstrated throughout the IPL.""They won't have those senior guys around to lean on. But the one thing that we can take away from the IPL is the next wave of Indian batsmen are talented.""So, I love the opportunity this (retirement of veterans) is presenting to some of the younger players,"" he concluded.","Hardik Pandya possesses abilities on par with Ben Stokes, says Scott Styris.

Will support national team by developing players at Inter Kashi: Habas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/will-support-national-team-by-developing-players-at-inter-kashi-habas/articleshow/112029904.cms,"Last season, Habas guided Mohun Bagan Super Giant to the ISL Shield triumph

Panaji:

Antonio Lopez Habas was close to becoming the national team coach until he was pipped at the post by FC Goa ’s Manolo Marquez , who will now do a dual job of coaching club and country.Habas remains the most successful coach in the Indian Super League (ISL), the top-tier league in the country, and believed he had more than a decent chance of stepping into the boots of Igor Stimac, sacked last month for his failure to steer India to the third round of the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifiers.“I think I deserved the nomination (to coach the national team),” Habas told TOI after completing a surprise move to Inter Kashi in the I-League , Indian football’s second tier, on Thursday. “We won three (ISL) titles, played four finals and six semifinals. Within football (fraternity), I feel like another Indian. I have coached many players of the national team. I was not chosen, and I accept it. I will support the national team by developing players at Inter Kashi. It’s what I have done until now, and what I will continue to do.”Last season, Habas guided Mohun Bagan Super Giant to the ISL Shield triumph. But while title victories normally assure coaches of a contract extension, the experienced Spaniard was not considered, reportedly due to concerns over his health. Even while selecting the national coach, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) executive committee members made a mention of the 67-year-old’s age and health.Habas though said he has the same “strength and enthusiasm” as when he first arrived in India to take charge of Atletico de Kolkata and won the maiden ISL trophy in 2014.“I am very disappointed and saddened by the treatment that some journalists and others have given me, speaking about my health problems. Someone did it to justify my departure from Mohun Bagan, and at the same time, prevent me from training the national team. My medical tests are currently perfect,” said Habas.The serial trophy winner has won the ISL twice with ATK (2014, 2019-20) and the ISL Winner’s Shield with Mohun Bagan last season. Now, his focus is on ensuring that Inter Kashi – started last season – win the I-League and move to the ISL.Explaining his decision to take over Inter Kashi, Habas said the club’s “proposal is attractive, serious and ambitious.”“It offers me guarantees and seriousness to develop my work,” he said. “At the same time, it is a great responsibility to be able to have a great impact sportingly in such an important and fascinating region of India as Uttar Pradesh.”Besides winning trophies in India, Habas had a stint as Bolivia’s head coach and finished runner-up in the 1997 Copa America.Inter Kashi said Habas will spearhead a long-term project aimed at creating a sustainable football ecosystem in Uttar Pradesh. “This initiative will focus on the promotion of Inter Kashi to the ISL, ensuring the club competes at the highest level of Indian football.“Habas will also help Inter Kashi devise a concrete player pathway to Europe, collaborating with Inter Escaldes to establish a pathway for Indian players to gain opportunities in Andorra, providing them with invaluable international exposure and experience,” the club said in a statement on Thursday.","Antonio Lopez Habas was close to becoming the national team coach until he was pipped at the post by FC Goa’s Manolo Marquez.

However, it's an opportunity for players to take over the vacant spots and raise their standards to the next level.

"Opted to play Durand Cup with reserves, club wanted 6-week pre-season for first team: Chennaiyin assistant coach Noel Wilson",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/opted-to-play-durand-cup-with-reserves-club-wanted-6-week-pre-season-for-first-team-chennaiyin-assistant-coach-noel-wilson/articleshow/112019717.cms,"What was the reason behind fielding the reserve team for the Durand Cup?

Five first-team players – Samik Mitra, Bikash Yumnam, Vincy Barretto, Alexander Romario and Irfan Yadwad – have been included in the camp. What is the plan for them?

What do you make of the youngsters in the squad?

How has the preparation been so far?

Coyle is well known for his positive brand of football. Will the reserve team have a similar style of play going forward?

You have reunited with Coyle, after having worked at Jamshedpur FC. How does it feel?

CHENNAI: Chennaiyin FC ’s newly appointed assistant coach Noel Wilson said the club opted to play with the reserve team in the Durand Cup to ensure that the first-team gets a six-week pre-season ahead of the Indian Super League (ISL). In an interaction with TOI at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium – Chennaiyin’s current training base – Wilson spoke about head coach Owen Coyle’s plan for the main team, Durand Cup preparation and more.Excerpts:You (first team) need to have a six-week pre-season (ahead of the ISL), which is about one-and-a-half months. I think, after the Durand Cup, there is going to be a gap of two months. You cannot be stagnant in that period. Coyle will have better ideas. He does not want the main team to play in the Durand Cup as there are chances of players getting injured. Maybe he does not want to take risk with the main-team players. He knows what is right.The players who have come here did not get much game time last season. When you play competitive matches, your confidence level will increase. After playing here, they will perform better once they return to the main team.There are some young players who have good quality. They need the experience and exposure of playing with the bigger guys (seniors). The difference between playing in a reserve team and a senior team is huge. But I can see that there is potential.Besides players from the main and reserve teams, we have shortlisted a few players from the trials. The team is good; the young boys are working hard. No matter what the team is (opponent), you will win if you play well. That is what I believe in. I have asked the boys not to worry about the opponents, whether they are from the ISL or I-League.It is difficult to implement a style of play when you have only a month to prepare. We began training at the start of the month and our first match is on July 31. But in general, I like it when the boys keep the ball in the front (attacking areas). I do not want the boys to keep the ball at the back for a long time. I do not want them to do that because it might create problems; errors at the back could lead to goals. I would rather expect the players to take the ball forward and play in the opponent’s half. That will be safer for us.Coyle is a wonderful coach; we can see it in his personality and coaching. Last season, he got Chennaiyin to the playoffs. It is always good to work with good coaches. As an Indian coach, we always try to learn something which will help us in the future.",Chennaiyin FC will play with the reserve team in the Durand Cup to ensure the first-team gets a six-week pre-season ahead of the Indian Super League (ISL) Assistant coach Noel Wilson spoke about head coach Owen Coyle’s plan for the main team.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112019695,imgsize-827309,width-400,resizemode-4/112019695.jpg"

But the rival goalkeeper failed to judge the ball's trajectory as it sailed over him and nestled into the far corner of the net.Having broken the deadlock, East Bengal looked in control of the proceedings with more focus and hunger in the second half. Second-half substitute Ajad Saheem saw his shot blocked by the goalkeeper soon after his arrival. He came calling again, on the back of a sweeping move down the right before laying it off for Tanmay Das, who was denied by the goalkeeper again.
