Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

Poll Should the ICC consider changing the tournament venue for Bangladesh matches? Definitely, due to security concerns. No, they should stick to the original plan.

NEW DELHI: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), on Tuesday, has formally written to the International Cricket Council (ICC) expressing its support for Bangladesh’s refusal to play matches in India at the 2026 Men’s T20 World Cup. The development comes a day before the ICC Board is set to meet on Wednesday to take a final call on Bangladesh’s participation in the tournament.According to an ESPNcricinfo report, the PCB’s communication to the ICC also copied members of the ICC Board, underlining Pakistan’s alignment with the Bangladesh Cricket Board’s (BCB) stance amid what it termed political and security concerns in the region. Bangladesh, backed by its government, has asked for its group-stage matches to be shifted to Sri Lanka, co-hosts of the tournament.The report further indicated that the governing body has so far remained firm on its position. The ICC has repeatedly conveyed to the BCB that the tournament schedule will not be altered and that Bangladesh are expected to play their matches in India as originally planned.Despite multiple rounds of discussions between the ICC and BCB, neither side has softened its stance.While the ICC has insisted that logistical and security assessments do not warrant a venue change, the BCB has maintained that it cannot send the team to India under the current circumstances. January 21 had been set as the deadline for a final decision, with the tournament scheduled to start on February 7.The PCB’s late intervention follows days of speculation about its role in resolving the impasse. Unverified reports suggested that Pakistan had offered to host Bangladesh’s matches, while others claimed the PCB was even reassessing Pakistan’s own participation depending on how the situation unfolded.The standoff traces back to the BCCI’s decision to ask IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to remove Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman from their IPL 2026 squad — a move that was never fully explained but widely linked to deteriorating political ties. That episode prompted the Bangladesh government to formally state that the national team would not travel to India for the World Cup.The fallout has since escalated, triggering unrest within Bangladesh cricket, including a brief player boycott during the BPL after controversial remarks by a senior BCB official.","The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has formally written to the International Cricket Council (ICC) expressing its support for Bangladesh’s refusal to play matches in India at the 2026 T20 World Cup.

"First thing I did after reaching space was to locate countries of my father, mother; I missed meeting Grp Capt Shukla on ISS who came after I left: Sunita Williams",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/first-thing-i-did-after-reaching-space-was-to-locate-countries-of-my-father-mother-i-missed-meeting-grp-capt-shukla-on-iss-who-came-after-i-left-sunita-williams/articleshow/126886277.cms,"Indian-origin NASA Astronaut Sunita Williams Says Her First Act In Space Was To Spot India, Home

NEW DELHI: “When I reached International Space Station for the first time, the first thing I did was to locate India (on Earth), from where my father belonged to, and Slovenia, from where my mother belonged,” said Indian American astronaut Sunita Williams in Delhi on Tuesday — the only female astronaut who has set the world record for most cumulative spacewalking time by a woman with a total of 62 hours and 6 minutes. During her lifetime, Williams went to space three times as a Nasa astronaut, totalling 608 days in space.Williams’s father, Deepak Pandya, is from Jhulasan village in Gujarat’s Mehsana district, where he was born before migrating to the US. Her mother, Ursuline Bonnie Pandya, is of Slovenian-American descent. Nicknamed ‘Suni’ or ‘Soncka’ in Slovenia, Williams was born in the US state of Ohio and has an elder brother, Jay Thomas, and a sister, Dina Ann.“Though I spent nine months in space during my latest trip to the ISS, I missed meeting Group Captain Subhanshu Shukla who reached the station just after I left,” Williams said during an interactive session, 'Eyes on the Stars, Feet on the Ground' at American Center here.During her last trip to space before hanging her astronaut suit, Williams went to ISS in 2024 for a scheduled 8-day space trip but had to spend 9 months on ISS as the Boeing Starliner that took her to ISS malfunctioned and had to return empty-handed.Later, SpaceX's Dragon brought Williams and her crewmate Butch Wilmore back to Earth on March 18, 2025, with the duo ending up spending 286 days in space. India’s Group Capt Shukla went to space as part of the Axiom mission on June 25, 2025.Williams faced several health issues after returning to Earth after remaining in zero gravity for a long time. However, the 60-year-old was seen in high spirits in Delhi on Tuesday, guiding and inspiring Indian students to join the space sector. To cheer her at the Delhi event was the mother of another Indian-American astronaut, Kalpana Chawla, who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia crash in 2003. Williams, wearing a trademark deep blue space overalls and sporting a pair of space-themed canvas shoes, stepped off the dais and reached out to Chawla’s mother, Sanyogita Chawla, 90, who was sitting in the front row, and gave her a warm hug.When asked about the renewed global interest in the Moon, Williams acknowledged the existence of a modern “space race”. “I think there is a space race going on. We want to get back to the moon sustainably and start the conversation about rules of engagement— how we actually work together with other countries. We want to do this in a productive, democratic way, much like Antarctica,” she said.Williams asserted that the horizon of space exploration is rapidly expanding beyond traditional boundaries, stating that the commercialisation of space is creating unprecedented opportunities for innovation. “Commercialisation of space is great. It means there are opportunities for people to work in so many different companies— not only rockets and spacecraft, but parts of space, experiments, satellites, and 3D printing of metals,” she said.“In my childhood, I never dreamt of becoming an astronaut. We used to watch Star Trek on black & white TV. After I did my schooling and graduated, my brother pushed me to join the military and, thereafter, I became a Navy officer,” she said. Williams had logged more than 3,000 flight hours in more than 30 types of aircraft during her career in the US Navy before donning the astronaut suit. While flying aircraft as a Navy commander, I then wished that I should go to the Moon. From then on, I pursued the career of an astronaut,” Williams recalled.“When I reached the ISS, I was craving for Indian food. I was delighted to see that somebody sent me an Indian dish (in the food cargo) though others were making faces. I was glad to also receive 3D printed models of my dogs on ISS.” In Nasa circles, Williams was called the ‘samosa astronaut’, as she liked carrying samosas to space.An athlete since childhood, Williams wanted to participate in a marathon. “So, my sister told me, ‘I will run on your behalf on the ground and you run in space. So that is how I decided to run a marathon in space,” she revealed. Williams ran the Boston Marathon in space in 2007 after qualifying by running the Houston Marathon in 2006, marking the first time a marathon was completed in orbit. She ran on a treadmill aboard the ISS, finishing in 4 hours and 24 minutes while her sister and others ran on Earth.Recalling her most difficult space job, Williams said she went for a spacewalk after the Starliner faced a technical issue and returned to Earth and the Dragon spacecraft was docking at ISS. “While I was replacing a defected reflector, I had ensured that the Dragon capsule was not damaged with my steel helmet. So, I did the job of replacing the reflector by bending my head on one side for over 1.5 hours. After I returned to my space cabin, I faced neck cramps the whole time. ”Williams, during her extended 9-month stay on ISS, conducted along with her crew over 150 scientific experiments and technological demonstrations, accumulating more than 900 hours of research across various fields like space gardening, microgravity biology, and water recovery systems.The Nasa astronaut said the perception about life on Earth changes when people go to space. “I am married and I argue with my husband like other couples do. But after reaching space (seeing the vast expanse of universe), I used to wonder why we argue (on minor issues) at all,” she said, adding, “The first thing I ate after returning to Earth was the bread my husband baked for me.”","Indian-American astronaut Sunita Williams says her first act in space was to spot India.

A controversial call that changed the game

Travis Kelce’s light-hearted reaction

Bills New Coach, Championship Preview, Wedding Advice & The New Era of TEs with Greg Olsen | EP 176

The Buffalo Bills’ playoff exit against the Denver Broncos did not end quietly. It sparked a fresh debate over officiating, rule interpretation, and what really counts as a catch in the modern NFL. At the centre of the storm was a late interception ruling that many Bills fans felt cost them the game. But while the fanbase fumed, some of the league’s biggest names came out firmly in support of the officials including Joe Burrow and Travis Kelce The flashpoint came late in the contest on a deep throw from Josh Allen to Brandin Cooks. Cooks appeared to make a stunning grab before Broncos defender Ja’Quan McMillian wrestled the ball away as both went to the ground.After a lengthy review, officials ruled that Cooks had not completed the process of the catch. The interception stood, and within minutes Denver marched down the field to set up the game-winning score.For many Bills fans, it felt like another season had ended on a single ruling. Clips of the play spread quickly across social media, with thousands questioning how the call could go against Buffalo in such a crucial moment.Amid the backlash, Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow stepped in with a rare post on X, offering a firm defence of the officials.“The amount of ppl that don’t understand what a catch is in the rule book flabbergasts me,” Burrow wrote. “And it’s not the officials. The two plays yesterday were not difficult calls, and they got them both right.”It was Burrow’s first post on the platform in months, and his blunt tone immediately drew attention. While many Bills supporters disagreed, several players and analysts backed his interpretation of the rule.Burrow’s post soon made its way to the “New Heights” podcast, hosted by Travis Kelce and his brother Jason Kelce, with former tight end Greg Olsen also discussing the play.Kelce’s reaction, however, focused less on the ruling and more on Burrow’s choice of words.“I love it. I don’t even care what he said to the world,” Kelce joked. “I’m just glad he used the word flabbergasted.”Olsen quickly joined in, laughing, “Flabbergasted. What a great word.”Behind the humour, both Kelce and Olsen agreed with Burrow’s view. Olsen explained that because Cooks was going to the ground, he had to complete the process of the catch, which he did not.For Buffalo, the explanation brought little comfort. The loss reopened old wounds, with fans recalling past playoff exits that hinged on controversial moments. Calls for rule clarity and consistency grew louder online.Still, the support from players like Burrow, Olsen and Kelce carried weight. Their message was clear: the rule may be frustrating, but it was applied correctly.As the playoffs move forward, debates over catches, control and survival are unlikely to fade. For now, one word from Joe Burrow and Travis Kelce’s amused reaction to it has become an unexpected footnote in another painful chapter of Bills playoff history.",The Buffalo Bills lost to the Denver Broncos in the NFL playoffs. A controversial interception ruling cost the Bills the game. Joe Burrow and Travis Kelce came out in support of the officials.

Fans posted warnings, insults, and emojis, dragging Kelce into the controversy as he weighs major decisions about his NFL future.

Taylor Swift backlash reaches Travis Kelce as fans turn his Instagram into a battleground

The noise did not start on a red carpet or in a courtroom. It started in a comment section. As fresh legal details tied Taylor Swift to the escalating Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively dispute, fans went looking for a pressure point. They found it on Travis Kelce’s Instagram.Within hours, Kelce’s page shifted from game talk to relationship judgment. Supporters, critics, and spectators crowded the space, reacting not to his play on the field but to his proximity to a storm he did not create. The reaction exposed how fast celebrity controversy now travels and how little separation exists between personal and public lives.“According to the docs, Taylor was anything but an innocent bystander who was set up by Blake during her NYC penthouse showdown with Justin Baldoni,” the report from TMZ stated. “In fact, Taylor seemed to be involved in Blake’s strategy, texting Blake, ‘If Justin was strategic, he would be like no Taylor Swift in the trailer because that gives you more power over the film, that’s your ally not his.’""In Lively’s deposition, she said, ‘I sent Taylor the script on her way to my apartment because Justin was still there, and I asked her to read them. I told her she didn’t have to, I didn’t want her to feel pressure to do that, but I hope that she would.’Taylor responded in text, ‘I’ll do anything for you!!’ Lively said at the apartment, Taylor endorsed the revised draft.”Travis Kelce’s comment section explodes after th messages resurface . One comment read, “Taylor, and Blake are exactly like Amber heard.” Another added, “Wow. How disappointing TS…”As screenshots spread, the tone hardened. A user wrote, “Taylor's messages to Blake she is not a nice girl. I would run Travis”. Another warned, “Travy you better run for the hills.”Others went further. “Love that Taylor can't handle the drama and turned off her comments!!!! What a baby” appeared among the replies. One of the most pointed messages asked, “What does it feel like to be engaged to someone who is a mean girl and a bully, and who was complicit in Regina Lively's plan to destroy an innocent man? #justiceforjustin”.The comments landed at a delicate moment. Kelce is weighing his NFL future after a disappointing end to the season with the Kansas City Chiefs. Instead of focusing on football decisions, his social feed became a live debate about loyalty, character, and guilt by association.What makes this episode travel so fast is not just fame. It is access. Fans now speak directly into the digital spaces of athletes and artists, collapsing distance and amplifying emotion. Kelce has not responded, and his comments remain open. For now, silence is his only defense as the internet keeps talking.","Travis Kelce saw his Instagram flooded with criticism after texts linked Taylor Swift to the Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively legal drama.

John Harbaugh's New York Giants era puts family and future in focus



John Harbaugh's New York Giants era has officially begun, and the first signs point to a cultural reset inside one of football’s most scrutinized franchises. The moment the deal became final on January 17, the Giants signaled that stability and experience now sit at the center of their long-term vision. After years of inconsistency, New York turned to a coach known for structure, accountability, and sustained relevance in the NFL.John Harbaugh arrives with context that matters. His exit from Baltimore followed an 8–9 finish in 2025, the Ravens’ first missed postseason since 2021. Injuries to Lamar Jackson shaped that outcome, but after 18 seasons, both sides understood change was inevitable. For the Giants, it was not about chasing trends. It was about leadership, credibility, and setting a tone that can last beyond one season.The hiring did more than reshape the Giants’ coaching staff. It pushed the Harbaugh family into a new spotlight. Fans quickly turned their attention to his inner circle, including his daughter Alison, a former Notre Dame lacrosse player who later continued her academic and athletic journey at the University of South Florida.Just as visible is Ingrid Harbaugh, whose steady presence has followed John through every chapter of his coaching life.Their story began years ago at Western Michigan. John was working as a graduate assistant under his father Jack, while Ingrid held a role in the baseball office as a student. What started on campus became a lifelong partnership that has now landed in New York. That connection felt front and center when the Giants shared a video of the couple together, welcoming them with the caption, ""Coach Harbaugh has arrived"".Beyond the emotion lies real football intrigue. John Harbaugh steps into a roster filled with young talent and unfinished promise. Jaxson Dart represents a quarterback project with upside. Malik Nabers, if healthy, gives the offense a dynamic edge. The appeal of this move rests in Harbaugh’s ability to develop players while demanding discipline from day one.Expectations will rise quickly. The NY Giants are not asking for miracles. They are asking for direction. With John Harbaugh, they finally believe they have it.",John Harbaugh's New York Giants era has officially begun.

Jeanie Buss reacts to LeBron James report



What did the report say about Jeanie Buss and LeBron James?



The Los Angeles Lakers found themselves at the center of a fresh storm on Wednesday as a detailed ESPN report stirred questions about leadership, loyalty, and long-standing power dynamics. At the heart of the story was Jeanie Buss and her relationship with LeBron James . Certainly, their partnership is often viewed as one of the league’s most stable. The report challenged that perception and triggered immediate reaction across the NBA landscape.Buss did not allow the narrative to linger for long. Within hours, she publicly addressed the claims, revealing that her bond with the Lakers’ biggest star had never fractured. Her response reframed the discussion and redirected attention toward how off-court family matters had been intertwined with James’ name.Jeanie Buss moved quickly to distance LeBron James from what she described as internal family issues. Speaking to The Athletic, she rejected the idea that her appreciation for James had ever wavered. She further shared that the portrayals in the narrative are both inaccurate and unfair.“It’s really not right, given all the great things LeBron has done for the Lakers, that he has to be pulled into my family drama,” Buss said. “To say that it wasn’t appreciated is just not true and completely unfair to him.”Her words directly countered the ESPN report, which painted a picture of growing frustration behind closed doors. Buss emphasized respect for James’ contributions, including his role in delivering the franchise’s 2020 championship and helping sustain relevance during turbulent seasons.By responding early, Buss ensured James was not left answering questions about issues that were not his creation.The ESPN article, written by Baxter Holmes, described complicated internal dynamics following the sale of the Lakers’ majority stake to Mark Walter. According to team sources cited in the story, Buss had privately voiced concerns about James’ “outsized ego” and the influence of Klutch Sports within basketball operations.The report also revisited past flashpoints. These included frustration over accountability after the failed Russell Westbrook trade in the 2021-22 season and Buss’ belief that James did not show enough gratitude when the Lakers selected Bronny James with the No. 55 pick in the 2024 NBA Draft.“When the Lakers drafted James’ son Bronny with the 55th pick in the 2024 draft, Jeanie privately remarked that James should be grateful for such a gesture, but she felt that he wasn’t, people close to the team told ESPN,” the report stated.James’ agent Rich Paul brushed off the controversy on his podcast, offering a blunt dismissal of the speculation.“There’s an article written every day,” Paul said.James has not responded to the report as of writing.",Jeanie Buss responded quickly to the ESPN report on her relationship with LeBron James.

The Los Angeles Dodgers have just concluded their high profile acquisition of Kyle Tucker last week, and this move immediately changed the conversation surrounding the future of the team. Although the contract terms took over the headlines then, there was a more intimate feeling that emerged a few days later. It was an Instagram story posted by his wife Samantha, and it kind of indicated what this new chapter actually means to the family.Her post did not repeat the announcement or the figures. Rather, it embodied the spirit of change and provided fans with a glimpse of what was outside the baseball business.Samantha Tucker’s Instagram story featured Kyle from behind in his new Dodgers jersey, his name stretched across the back alongside his number. The caption read, “New number, new team! Let’s do this 💙🤍.” In just a few words, the message conveyed optimism, encouragement, and belief. It felt natural and unforced, echoing the excitement of starting fresh rather than the pressure that often follows a major contract.The post resonated because of its timing. The Dodgers deal was already done and the first buzz had subsided. Samantha’s message was received as a personal follow up and it indicated that the reality of the move was setting in. It contextualized the transition as something to experience, not act in front of the crowd.The role of family during times of professional change was also noted in the post. When Tucker is putting things together to accept the expectations in Los Angeles, the backing at home seems to be solid and assured. That balance is not always obvious but can prove to be very important in stressful seasons.In a bigger approach the post gave some warmth to what was otherwise a story of numbers and estimates. The four year contract worth $240 million, as reported by Associated Press has an extensive signing bonus structure, which highlights how the Dodgers had long term confidence in him.

Lately I’ve been leaning into simple joys—fresh air, good movement, and a little *friendly* competition on the court. 😜 There’s something about pickleball that feels like play again, not pressure, and I’ve been loving every minute of it.”Gracie Hunt added, “Weekend activities like this fill my cup and reset my heart in the best way.

StableRonaldo bans law firm account after viewers flag suspicious clips of FaZe house damage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/stableronaldo-bans-law-firm-account-after-viewers-flag-suspicious-clips-of-faze-house-damage/articleshow/127042186.cms,"Image Via Instagram

StableRonaldo reacts after law firm clips damage to former FaZe house

“Brother, did you not think my viewers would find you?”

“Is this the guy who comes to the house?”

“I don’t know if I’m getting trolled by my chat. It says clipped by Copete Law Firm… and every clip of them is just damages to the house. Do you think they’re actually watching me?”





Twitch streamer StableRonaldo shocked viewers after banning an account that appeared to belong to a real-life law firm during a recent livestream. The move came after fans noticed the account clipping moments that showed damage inside the former FaZe Clan content house. The incident quickly caught attention, especially as it followed the sudden collapse of FaZe’s creator division and the shutdown of the once-famous house.The situation unfolded on January 20, when viewers alerted Ronaldo that a newly joined account was quietly clipping his stream. What raised concern was the pattern, every clip focused on moments where something hit a wall or appeared to cause damage. The account never typed in chat, leading Ronaldo to question whether he was being watched for legal reasons or simply trolled.During the stream, Ronaldo appeared confused and unsettled as he learned more about the account. The profile name matched Copete Law, P.C., a real law firm based in California that specializes in real estate litigation. According to viewers, the account had followed Ronaldo for less than 30 minutes before clipping footage showing him throwing an object into a wall.Ronaldo said on stream.He later added,Shortly after reacting live, Ronaldo banned the account from viewing or clipping his stream. He also called others to check if they recognized the firm, still unsure whether the situation was serious or a coordinated prank by viewers.The controversy is tied to the recent downfall of FaZe Clan’s creator brand. In late December, major FaZe personalities announced they were leaving the organization, causing all non-esports operations to shut down almost overnight. As a result, creators like StableRonaldo and Lacy confirmed they would soon move out of the FaZe house.Since then, images and footage of the empty house have become a recurring feature on Ronaldo’s stream, often used as a screensaver or background visual. That context has fueled speculation over whether property damage could become a legal issue.For now, no legal action has been confirmed. While Copete Law, P.C. is a legitimate firm, it remains unclear if the account truly belonged to them or if viewers were simply having fun. Until more details emerge, the incident remains another strange chapter in the ongoing FaZe fallout.","Twitch streamer StableRonaldo shocked viewers after banning an account that appeared to belong to a real-life law firm.

Tyreek Hill hints at possible Chargers future after Mike McDaniel’s coaching move shakes up NFL fans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tyreek-hill-hints-at-possible-chargers-future-after-mike-mcdaniels-coaching-move-shakes-up-nfl-fans/articleshow/127037834.cms,"Mike McDaniel and Tyreek Hill (Image Via Getty)

Tyreek Hill reacts as Mike McDaniel is expected to join the Los Angeles Chargers

Tyreek Hill is once again getting NFL fans talking. On Tuesday night, the Miami Dolphins wide receiver reacted online after news broke that former Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel is expected to become the Los Angeles Chargers’ new offensive coordinator. Tyreek Hill’s short post quickly went viral and made many people wonder if he could one day follow his former coach to the West Coast.The timing of Tyreek Hill’s message stood out. As he continues to recover from a serious leg injury, his reaction suggested he is still closely watching coaching moves around the league. For many fans, it felt like a small hint that Tyreek Hill would be open to reuniting with Mike McDaniel again.On Tuesday, ESPN insider Adam Schefter reported that Mike McDaniel is expected to become the Los Angeles Chargers’ offensive coordinator.The report said McDaniel has told other teams he is no longer looking for a head coaching job and that the Chargers are his clear focus.Adam Schefter wrote on X, “Former Dolphins HC Mike McDaniel is expected to become the Chargers offensive coordinator barring a change of heart, per Jeff Darlington and me.McDaniel has informed other teams that they’re out, the Chargers clearly want him, and the two sides are having dinner tonight. But the expectation across the league is that McDaniel will be staying in LA.”Soon after that post went live on Tuesday night, Tyreek Hill shared his own reaction on X. He wrote, “Mike to the chargers hm.”The short message was simple, but many fans took it as a sign that Tyreek Hill liked the idea of Mike McDaniel working in Los Angeles.If the move becomes official, Mike McDaniel would be joining Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert . The pairing would give Los Angeles one of the league’s most creative offensive minds working with one of its strongest young passers.Mike McDaniel first became Tyreek Hill’s head coach in 2022, when the Miami Dolphins hired McDaniel and traded for Hill from the Kansas City Chiefs.That same year, Tyreek Hill had one of the best seasons of his career. He finished with over 1,700 receiving yards and was one of the most feared receivers in the NFL.Tyreek Hill followed that up with another huge season in 2023, again passing 1,700 receiving yards under Mike McDaniel’s offense.Those two years are widely seen as the most productive of Tyreek Hill’s career. The Dolphins later fired Mike McDaniel at the end of the 2025 regular season after the team failed to meet expectations.Tyreek Hill’s own 2025 season ended early and painfully. In September 2025, he suffered a serious leg injury during a game, dislocating his knee and tearing multiple ligaments, including his ACL.Since then, Tyreek Hill has been focused on rehab and recovery. Even while injured, Tyreek Hill has dropped hints about possible future moves.In November 2025, he posted “I need to go home” on X, which many fans linked to a possible return to the Kansas City Chiefs. Now, with Mike McDaniel heading toward Los Angeles, Tyreek Hill’s latest post has opened the door to another possible reunion story.",Mike McDaniel is expected to become the Los Angeles Chargers’ offensive coordinator.

Lara Trump shares viral golfing photos with Donald Trump and granddaughter

Bill Maher Clashes With Lara Trump After She Downplays Trump’s ‘Piggy’ Insult On Air Force One

Social media responds with warmth and nostalgia

How a shared family moment cut through public tension





Lara Trump has recently bestowed upon social media participants a rare treat with a glimpse into the less familiar, more personal side of the Trump family. Through the sharing of just a few images on X, she has reached the hearts of many with this intimate family picture involving her young daughter's fun-filled golf game with her grandfather, US President Donald Trump himself, with whom she gets to spend quality time while playing their favourite game, golf. This is one instance where the family, known for its political fervour, has been accepted with such fervour not for their political ideology but for this common family experience that speaks volumes about their humanity despite their fame and power, resonating widely with audiences who cherish authentic, tender moments beyond politics.The photographs depicted Donald Trump behind the wheel of a golf cart, with his granddaughter sitting alongside him, looking happy and carefree. Moreover, there were no signs of poses or dramatic settings, only a serene capture of moments spent with each other. The informal nature of this post was a major factor that led to its success. The post was not meant for any particular message or statement, but only for a casual share by Lara Trump. The post succeeded in gathering tens of thousands of views, not because it was political or held any significance, but because it was something that was widely understood.The online response was largely positive, with many people describing the photographs as “wholesome” and “heartwarming”. Several users reflected on the special bond between grandparents and grandchildren, sharing how the images stirred personal memories and emotions. One user wrote, “What a great moment for her! My kids miss their Gramps,” while another commented, “Core memory unlocked!”, capturing the sense of nostalgia the post evoked. Others reacted more light-heartedly, with remarks such as, “Awww, I was wondering what Grandpa Trump was up to today!” and “Cutest thing I have seen all day.”Part of the post’s impact lay in its timing and tone. At a moment when public discourse is often polarised, the photographs presented a version of public life stripped of commentary and conflict. They highlighted how figures who dominate global headlines also occupy familiar family roles, such as grandparents enjoying simple moments with their loved ones.","Lara Trump has shared intimate family photos on social media.

Cole Caufield’s last-second goal saves Montreal Canadiens from overtime

The Montreal Canadiens snatched victory from the jaws of defeat on Tuesday night in dramatic fashion. Cole Caufield scored with just 15 seconds remaining in regulation to lift Montreal to a thrilling 4-3 victory over the Minnesota Wild at Bell Centre.The dramatic winner gave the Canadiens their third and final lead of the evening. Caufield's heroics continued his remarkable track record of delivering in clutch moments throughout his young career. He also entered a very exclusive club with his latest goal and joined other all-time greats.Caufield positioned himself at the top of the right faceoff circle as the Canadiens desperately searched for the game-tying goal. Nick Suzuki found him with a perfect pass that the winger one-timed past Jesper Wallstedt's glove before the goaltender could react.The goal completed Montreal's comeback and sent the Bell Centre crowd into a frenzy. The Canadiens had battled back multiple times throughout the game before finally breaking through in the dying seconds.""We just found a way to keep the puck alive, and luckily it went in,"" Caufield said modestly after the game.""That's why you play the full 60 or 65, whatever it is. They all count the same, but it feels good to get two points tonight.""The dramatic goal represented Caufield's 21st game-winning goal in the third period or overtime since his NHL debut in 2020-21. That total puts the 24-year-old in elite company among the league's most clutch performers.Only four players have scored more such goals over that span. Leon Draisaitl and Sebastian Aho lead the way with 28 apiece, while Sidney Crosby and Steven Stamkos have each recorded 23.For Caufield to rank fifth on that list at his age speaks volumes about his ability to deliver when games hang in the balance. The former first-round pick has developed a reputation as a clutch scorer who thrives under pressure.The victory also marked the return of forward Kirby Dach to the Canadiens' lineup. The 24-year-old played 16:46 in his first game since breaking his foot on November 15.Dach registered two shots on goal while shaking off the rust after missing nearly two months of action. His return would finally give the Canadiens a reliable name in the 2C position as the franchise continues to battle through an extremely competitive Atlantic Division.With both the Tampa Bay Lightning and Detroit Red Wings giving Montreal a run for its money, Dach’s return has given head coach Martin St. Louis another possible choice for his top six.",Cole Caufield scored with just 15 seconds remaining in regulation to lift Montreal to a thrilling 4-3 victory over the Minnesota Wild at Bell Centre.

Cody Bellinger free agency drama heats up as MLB insider reveals why his versatility could help the New York Mets more than the Yankees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/cody-bellinger-free-agency-drama-heats-up-as-mlb-insider-reveals-why-his-versatility-could-help-the-new-york-mets-more-than-the-yankees/articleshow/127024229.cms,"Cody Bellinger (Image Via Getty)

Cody Bellinger’s versatility could help the New York Mets more than the New York Yankees

Cody Bellinger, the two-time All-Star outfielder and free agent, has become the most talked-about player in the MLB offseason this January 2026. Bellinger chose out of his contract to try free agency after having a very successful season with the New York Yankees in 2025, hitting .272 with 29 home runs and driving in 98 runs.While the Yankees sought him back and supposedly presented a significant deal, Bellinger and his crew have not settled on terms. Now, the New York Mets are also connected to him. A well-known MLB insider said Bellinger is more than just a hitter, he’s like a “Swiss army knife” who can fill many roles for a team.MLB insider Joel Sherman said on January 22, 2026, that Bellinger’s ability to play many positions makes him a special player, especially for the New York Mets.Sherman said Bellinger can play all outfield spots, can play first base, hits well against left-handed pitchers, and has a high baseball IQ. He also said Bellinger knows how to handle big media cities like New York, which is important for both fanbases.Sherman added that for the Mets, Bellinger could solve problems the team still has after trading away some players and missing out on other stars like Kyle Tucker.The Mets have changed their roster a lot, and Bellinger could add more value because he can be in many spots on the field.The New York Mets didn’t stop at talking about Bellinger. On January 20–21, 2026, the Mets traded for outfielder Luis Robert Jr. from the Chicago White Sox in exchange for infielder Luisangel Acuña and pitching prospect Truman Pauley.Robert is known for his defense and speed, even if his bat was not as strong last season, and he could fill a big role in left or center field for the Mets.Earlier in the offseason, the Mets also signed shortstop Bo Bichette to a large contract after losing out on free agent Kyle Tucker to the Los Angeles Dodgers.These moves show that the Mets are trying many ways to improve their roster this winter. As they add players like Bichette and Robert, their need for Bellinger might change, but his versatility still keeps him in the conversation.","Cody Bellinger, the two-time All-Star outfielder and free agent, has become the most talked-about player in the MLB offseason this January 2026.

Allan Donald on Virat Kohli’s legacy: Can he reach 100 centuries?

Abhishek Sharma began the T20 series against New Zealand with a 35-ball 84, leaving the New Zealand bowlers spaced out as India piled up a strong 238/7 in the first T20 International on Wednesday.The number one T20 international batsman reminded the Black Caps’ fielders about their helpless existence when facing him as he unleashed eight massive sixes and five fours with jaw-dropping hitting skills.Opening the batting, Abhishek smashed his fifty with ease in just 22 deliveries, thereby establishing a new T20I record for the quickest fifty by an Indian against New Zealand. This positive start put pressure on the New Zealand bowlers and set the tone for the rest of the batting lineup.During his innings, Abhishek became the only batter who has scored eight half-centuries in T20Is in 25 or fewer balls, surpassing the likes of Suryakumar Yadav, Phil Salt and Evin Lewis, who are all tied on 7 of such knocks.Abhishek achieved this feat in 22 balls, thus also breaking the previous Indian record for the fastest fifty in T20Is against the Kiwis, which was held jointly by KL Rahul (Auckland in 2020) and Rohit Sharma (Hamilton in 2020).Both of them took 23 balls. To better two of India’s best white-ball cricketers says a lot about the fearless approach that the newer generation possesses.Suryakumar Yadav, at the other end, struggled to find rhythm throughout, but a couple of shots-the crisp back-foot punch through covers off Duffy and a power-packed six off Clarke behind square-suggested that flashes of the vintage Indian skipper weren't all too far away. Overall, however, he was still short of his best.The usually reliable Black Caps skipper Mitchell Santner, 1/37 in 3 overs, tried to stem the flow and succeeded to a degree as Suryakumar was finally holed out at long-on, unable to find the requisite elevation.Meanwhile, Abhishek Sharma continued his dominance, though his innings ended in the very next over. A slightly shorter leg-break from Ish Sodhi proved enough for Jamieson to grab it with ease.Rinku Singh took advantage of the deliveries towards the end, smashing 21 runs off Daryl Mitchell’s final over as India stormed to a formidable total, raising the bar high enough to make the finish of the innings thrilling.",Abhishek Sharma smashes 84 off just 35 balls as India reach 238/7 in first T20 International against New Zealand.

Jackson LaCombe replaces Seth Jones in Team USA roster for Olympics

Anaheim Ducks defenseman Jackson LaCombe has recently been named to Team USA’s roster for the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026. He has replaced Panthers defenseman Seth Jones, who has been dropped from the roster due to an injury. With this, LaCombe became the third-youngest defenseman named to Team USA and the fifth-youngest player for the 2026 Winter Olympic Games.According to the NHL, LaCombe will appear in his first Olympic Winter Games with Team USA and his fourth international appearance for his country. He will join important marquee players like Cam Fowler (2014) and Ryan Whitney (2010). Other Ducks players to represent Team USA at the Olympics include Troy Terry (2018), Bobby Ryan (2010), and Guy Hebert (1998). Anaheim Ducks blueliner Jackson LaCombe has replaced Panthers defenseman Seth Jones in the Team USA roster for the upcoming Milano Cortina Winter Olympic Games 2026. The reason behind Jose’s replacement is due to an upper-body injury. The Panthers player was placed on LTIR by the club this week.Jones was also a potential choice for Team USA. The 31-year-old has six goals and 24 points in 40 games so far this season while averaging 23:29 of ice time per game. He has also been resurgent since being acquired by the Panthers from the Chicago Blackhawks ahead of the trade deadline last year, playing a key role as Florida repeated as Stanley Cup champions.However, Panthers head coach Paul Maurice said earlier this month that when Jones was first injured, he was expected to return before the Olympic break. Unfortunately, owing to this situation, Team USA has opted for LaCombe instead.Meanwhile, LaCombe has six goals and 31 points in 49 games with the Ducks this season, averaging 24:26 of ice time per game. He helped Team USA claim gold at the World Hockey Championship last spring, America’s first since 1933.As per TSN, the 25-year-old blueliner signed a nine-year, $72 million contract extension with the Ducks in October, which will kick in this fall and carry a cap hit of $9 million.LaCombe will join goaltender Lukas Dostal and defenseman Radko Gudas (both Czechia), center Leo Carlsson (Sweden), forward Mikael Granlund (Finland), and goaltender prospect Damian Clara (host Italy) as Anaheim’s six players selected to participate in the February Olympic Winter Games.The Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026 will take place from Feb. 11-22, and Team USA opens play in the Olympic tournament on Feb. 12 against Latvia.","Jackson LaCombe has replaced Panthers defenseman Seth Jones in the Team USA roster for the upcoming Milano Cortina Winter Olympic Games 2026.

Who was Wilbur Wood? The Chicago White Sox knuckleball pitcher who died at 84,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/who-was-wilbur-wood-the-chicago-white-sox-knuckleball-pitcher-who-died-at-84/articleshow/126718530.cms,"Wilbur Wood (Image Via Getty)

How Wilbur Wood built a long career and earned baseball’s respect

Wilbur Wood, the legendary Major League Baseball pitcher known for his knuckleball, has died at the age of 84. The Chicago White Sox confirmed the news on January 17, 2026. Wood passed away at a hospital in Burlington, Massachusetts, where he had been living after retiring from baseball.Wood played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball, with 12 of those years spent with the Chicago White Sox. He also pitched for the Boston Red Sox and the Pittsburgh Pirates. After news of his death broke, fans and former players shared memories of him. Many described him as a quiet, kind man who worked hard and threw a pitch very few could ever control.Wilbur Wood was born on October 22, 1941, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He signed with the Boston Red Sox and made his major league debut at age 19 on June 30, 1961.From there, Wood had a long journey before finding his greatest success with the Chicago White Sox.Wood became famous for throwing the knuckleball, a pitch that moves in strange ways and is very hard for hitters to hit. He mastered it and made it his signature pitch, which helped him last a long time in the majors.From 1967 to 1978, Wood appeared in hundreds of games for the White Sox.He was selected as an American League All-Star three times (1971, 1972, and 1974). He had four seasons with 20 or more wins, an achievement very few pitchers reach.One of his most amazing seasons came in 1972, when Wood pitched an incredible 376⅔ innings, a remarkable total that still stands out in baseball history.That same year he also started 49 games, a number no pitcher had reached since the early 1900s.Over his 17-year career, Wood finished with a 164–156 win-loss record, 1,411 strikeouts, and a 3.24 earned run average (ERA). He retired after the 1978 season, leaving behind a legacy of endurance and quiet greatness.Teammates, coaches, and fans remember Wood not just for his numbers, but for the way he played the game.“He was one of the toughest pitchers I ever saw,” one former White Sox player said on social media after Wood’s death.After news of his passing spread, the White Sox sent their condolences to his family, friends, and fans. The team said Wood was more than a pitcher, he was part of White Sox history.Former White Sox executive Roland Hemond said in a tribute, “Wilbur was a real competitor and a good man. He gave his all every day on the mound.”Fans also shared memories on social media, praising Wood for his toughness and character.Even now, many baseball historians say Wood’s records and unique pitching style will be talked about for years.His work with the knuckleball changed how many teams look at that pitch and the pitchers who throw it.","Wilbur Wood played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball, with 12 of those years spent with the Chicago White Sox.

Inside details of Shubman Gill's Test and 2027 ODI World Cup plans

Poll Should the mid-season break in the Ranji Trophy be removed? Yes, it disrupts the flow of the tournament No, breaks are necessary for player recovery It depends on the scheduling of other tournaments

BENGALURU/PUNE: Sixty-three days. That is the gap between two Ranji Trophy matches this season. In the intervening period, the domestic calendar was packed with two white-ball tournaments — the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and the Vijay Hazare Trophy.As the country’s premier domestic competition resumes from Thursday, it raises an uncomfortable question: Is the Ranji Trophy still premier in terms of relevance? The looming T20 World Cup or an IPL auction can hardly be a justification for shuffling tournaments in a manner that fractures continuity.While there is considerable focus on workload management for international cricketers, the burden on domestic players often goes unnoticed.On Sunday, just hours after New Zealand clinched their maiden ODI title in India, Vidarbha secured their first Vijay Hazare Trophy. Ironically, for all the rhetoric about prioritising domestic cricket, both the marquee contests were scheduled on the same day.And the churn has been relentless. Less than four days after lifting the trophy, Vidarbha are back in action against Andhra in Anantapur, while the runners-up have returned home to host Punjab — another reminder of how little breathing space the domestic calendar affords its protagonists.Maharashtra captain Ankit Bawne is not a fan of the mid-season break, “I feel the break shouldn’t be there. This is a very prestigious tournament and it would be ideal to play it in one stretch,” Bawne said on Wednesday. On managing workloads, particularly of fast bowlers amid a packed schedule, Bawne acknowledged the challenge. “We have to look after the health of the pacers because they’ve also played the limited overs formats. If we qualify for the knockouts, I’ll need them fit and available there as well. So it is a bit challenging, but it is what it is,” he explained.Echoing similar concerns, another player, who requested anonymity, pointed out that multiple factors — including the change of format and the semifinals and final being played under lights — could make the transition demanding for players. Calling the Ranji Trophy the toughest format to play, Bawne added that adaptability would be key. “Ranji is the most challenging format. We call it a grind. You can’t go out and play shots like in white-ball cricket. But cricketers are mature now. They’ll adapt quickly to conditions and adjust their game accordingly,” he said.As the domestic season heads into the home stretch with two rounds remaining, the focus will be on how players navigate the shift between formats. With the demands of white-ball cricket bleeding into the red-ball calendar, success in the Ranji Trophy may hinge on who manages the transition best.","Mid-season break in the Ranji Trophy disrupts the flow of the tournament.

Shubman Gill on missed chances, fielding lapses & World Cup preparation after ODI series loss

The Department of Sports and Youth Welfare, Government of Assam, in partnership with the Inspire Institute of Sport (IIS), is conducting a Coaches Orientation & Development Programme alongside a Talent Identification initiative for junior and developmental athletes in Guwahati from January 18 to 23, 2026. The programme is being led by Troy Douglas, former Olympian, World Championships medallist, and Head Coach of IIS Athletics, bringing Olympic-level coaching expertise into the state as part of a structured, long-term effort to strengthen Assam's athletics ecosystem and align it with India's Olympic ambitions.In a further boost to the programme's Olympic pedigree, Dr Klaus Bartonietz, the renowned coach who guided iconic javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra to India's historic Olympic gold medal, will be involved in specialised sessions and the evaluation of emerging talent as part of the initiative's long-term athlete development framework. The on-ground programme will commence at the Arjuna Bhogeswar Baruah Sports Complex in Guwahati, where athletes and coaches will work under a panel of national and international experts, as per a press release.The programme combines advanced coach education and structured talent identification, with 150 under-18 athletes from across Assam identified through a state-wide scouting process. In parallel, 11 athletics coaches from seven districts are being trained under a World Athletics-aligned curriculum, ensuring that international best practices are embedded within the state's coaching framework.Alongside Troy Douglas, the coaching team includes Dr Klaus Bartonietz, Ralph Mouchbahani from Germany, World Athletics Coaching Expert (online), and World Athletics Level-2 Coaches Saharsh Shah and Bala Chaitanya, who will deliver sessions focused on modern track and field techniques, sports science integration, nutrition, recovery, and long-term athlete development.The Guwahati phase builds on the programme's first phase, which was conducted earlier at the IIS Centre in Vijayanagar, Karnataka. During the initial week-long orientation, Assam's coaches underwent intensive classroom and practical training in scientific coaching methodologies, performance planning, and athlete management. The learnings from that phase are now being implemented on the ground in Assam through direct engagement with young athletes.As part of its long-term vision, the Department of Sports, Assam, and IIS plan to establish a satellite athletics centre in Guwahati, which will function as a junior training and development hub, creating clear pathways for promising athletes to progress from grassroots competition to elite national and international platforms.","The Department of Sports and Youth Welfare, Government of Assam, is conducting a Coaches Orientation & Development Programme alongside a Talent Identification initiative.

Bachchan, Waugh, Maxwell and Smith: Inside Europe’s New T20 League

NEW DELHI: As he begins his journey into yet another Olympic cycle, has Neeraj Chopra ’s celebrated tryst with foreign coaches come to an end? The new year began with an unexpected announcement for the Indian athletics community, with Chopra deciding to end his short yet fruitful partnership with Czech legend Jan Zelezny, which began in Nov 2024, and instead chose familiarity over form. Childhood coach Jaiveer Singh Chaudhary has returned to his training circle to guide him through his forthcoming season, it was announced.Chopra’s decision indicated that he would work with an allIndian coaching setup going forward, primarily taking greater control of his playing and professional career. TOI has even learnt that Chopra will no longer look for a foreign expert — something that was felt so vital for his development and domination, till not so long ago — and that the 28-year-old Olympic and world champion’s career will henceforth be managed by Indian coaches. On Wednesday, Athletics Federation of India’s (AFI) selection committee chairman Adille Sumariwalla told TOI that Chopra will begin his season training with Chaudhary and long-time physio Ishaan Marwaha by his side.“Chopra requested that Chaudhary be attached with him. He was his coach when he began his javelin journey. Chopra said he wasn’t looking to be coached by a foreign expert,” Sumariwalla said.Having been attached as Chopra’s physio since early 2017 when the two were managed by JSW Sports, Marwaha has even joined Chopra in his new venture Vel Sports, an athlete management firm coowned by the javelin thrower.“Chopra understands his body well. He is a champion thrower and knows the requirements of a professional athlete. Having been guided by four foreign coaches on different occasions, Chopra doesn’t feel the need to be mentored by another expert,” the AFI official added.“All I can say is neither the AFI nor Chopra are looking at engaging a foreign coach anytime soon. There are no talks around it. He will be coached by Chaudhary going forward, and the two are already busy in off-season training. Chopra will have Chaudhary and Marwaha as part of his coaching staff,” he said.Chopra could most likely begin his season with Doha Diamond League on May 8. He is currently training at his regular base in Potchefstroom, for a 32-day off-season camp, which will run until Feb 5.A source familiar with the development said this arrangement could work until the Asian Games in Japan, scheduled from Sept 19-Oct 4 this year, and possibly until the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028 if Chopra feels comfortable with the setup.Chopra was coached by three Indian and four foreign coaches in a stellar career. Being coached by relative Chaudharyat in Panipat, he was later trained by Naseem Ahmad as a 13-year-old from 2011 in Panchkula. Later, Chopra shifted his base to NIS Patiala as a national camper under Kashinath Naik.Later he trained under Australian Garry Calvert, Germans Uwe Hohn, Klaus Bartonietz and Jan Zelenzy of Czech Republic (see graphic).A possible reason behind Chopra and Zelezny parting ways, according to a well-placed source, was that the 59-year-old, in addition to coaching the Indian, was also fulfilling his duties as national coach with the Czech Athletics Federation. While Zelezny was accompanying Chopra to training trips and international assignments, the coach was apparently under pressure from the Czech athletics body to also report for national duties and camps. “It was getting difficult to work under such an arrangement,” a source said.",Neeraj Chopra will work with an allIndian coaching setup going forward.

Matthew Stafford owns the result, but he said he “didn’t get into a great rhythm” vs. Bears

Kelly Stafford has a very specific NFL complaint this week, and it has nothing to do with coverages or play-calling.On Tuesday, Jan. 21, Stafford posted an Instagram story showing herself bouncing between team apps while trying to secure a ticket for the Los Angeles Rams’ upcoming NFC Championship Game against the Seattle Seahawks. Multiple outlets reported the post and her frustration.Stafford didn’t dress it up. She shared the clip and wrote, “Honestly though … this whole you have to download the other team’s app to get your ticket to the game is getting a little absurd,” per Sportskeeda’s report.That’s the part that hits because it’s relatable. Most fans expect one clean path to their seat. Stafford’s post suggests she had to jump through extra steps even with a direct tie to the Rams’ quarterback. She showed herself scrolling through other teams’ apps, including the Chicago Bears app, before deleting it and downloading the Seahawks app to try to book tickets for the next game.The timing matters. Stafford attended the Rams’ divisional-round playoff game against the Bears at Soldier Field on Sunday and posted photos afterward, including matching outerwear with her daughters. Sportskeeda reported her caption from that post: “Anyone else feel like the stress of these games is shaving years off your life??!2-0.#mvd Thank goodness the Rams handled the cold better than my jacket,” with the family wearing matching “Stafford” coats and Matthew Stafford’s No. 9.While Kelly Stafford’s story centered on ticket access, Matthew Stafford’s week still sits under the playoff microscope.After the divisional-round win, Stafford addressed his own performance in his postgame press conference on Sunday, Jan. 18. He commented: “I definitely didn’t get into a great rhythm today,” Stafford said. “There’s no question about that. Had some opportunities in the past game. Just some things that made it tough. Obviously, I can be better. But playoff football is about winning the football game.”Stafford threw for 258 yards with zero touchdowns in that game.

Shubman Gill on missed chances, fielding lapses & World Cup preparation after ODI series loss

India batting star Rohit Sharma was at the centre of a major security scare recently after a woman allegedly grabbed his arm while he was entering the team hotel during the third ODI against New Zealand in Indore. A video of the incident, which has since gone viral on social media, shows the woman breaching the security cordon and approaching an unsuspecting Rohit, who appeared visibly startled by the sudden encounter.The clip later features the woman explaining her actions, claiming she was driven by desperation to seek help for her daughter, who is allegedly battling a serious illness and requires an expensive life-saving injection costing Rs 9 crore.“My name is Sarita Sharma. My daughter, Anika, is suffering from a serious illness, and to save her, we need an injection that costs Rs 9 crore and has to be imported from America. We have been organising small camps to raise funds, and so far, we have managed to collect Rs 4.1 crore. We are running out of time,"" she said in the video.The woman further revealed that she had been trying to reach out to Indian cricketers during the match in the hope of receiving assistance.“Yesterday, during the India-New Zealand match, we tried to reach out to cricketers in the hope of getting some help. We also set up a donation camp during the match, but it was not enough. I was trying to meet Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, as they have been helping children. In a desperate attempt to save my child, I went to the hotel where Rohit Sharma was staying. Emotions got the better of me, and I ended up grabbing his hand,"" she added.Apologising for the incident, the woman appealed directly to the senior cricketers.“I want to appeal to Virat sir and Rohit sir. You may not be aware of what I was trying to do. I was not there to click any selfies; I just want to save my child’s life. I also want to apologise to the authorities for my actions. I did not know what else to do. I request Virat and Rohit that if they receive my message, please help me,"" she concluded.Rohit, 38, has retired from Test and T20 cricket but continues to represent India in the ODI format.Meanwhile, the former India captain is set to be conferred with an Honorary Doctorate (D.Litt.) by Ajeenkya DY Patil University (ADYPU) during its 10th Convocation Ceremony on Saturday, in recognition of his “unparalleled contribution” and “exemplary leadership” in cricket.""While fans know him as the 'Hitman' of cricket, the convocation marks a different kind of milestone for Rohit Sharma,"" the University said.""Presided over by the University’s President and Chancellor, Dr. Ajeenkya D Y Patil, the ceremony will see Rohit being honored for his unparalleled contribution to sports and his exemplary leadership on the world stage.""By bestowing this Honorary Doctorate, ADYPU recognizes the values of resilience and strategy that he represents-qualities that resonate deeply with the graduating class of 2026.""",Rohit Sharma was at the centre of a major security scare recently.

Inside details of Shubman Gill's Test and 2027 ODI World Cup plans

Poll Who was the standout performer in India's first T20I match against New Zealand? Abhishek Sharma Rinku Singh Jasprit Bumrah Arshdeep Singh

238/7 - India recorded their highest total against New Zealand in T20Is, bettering the 234/4 in Ahmedabad on Feb 1, 2023. The said total is the highest by any team vs NZ in overseas T20Is.

240 - Strike-rate registered by Abhishek is his 2nd highest in an innings of 50-plus behind the 250 during his innings of 135 off 54 balls vs Eng at The Wankhede, Mumbai on Feb 2, 2025.

8 - Sixes hit by Abhishek are the joint second-highest vs NZ in a T20I innings alongside Kieron Pollard (75 not out) for West Indies in Auckland on Nov 27, 2020. Richard Levi hit 13 sixes during his innings of 117 not out for SA in Hamilton on Feb 19, 2012.

3 - India’s total of 238/7 is the third highest by a team vs New Zealand in T20Is behind the 245 for five by Australia on Feb 16, 2018 and England’s 241 for three in Napier on Nov 8, 2019.

NAGPUR: Ahead of the T20 World Cup next month, if India wanted to comfort their fans and give an indication of All Is Well, then the first T20I vs New Zealand in Nagpur provided them with that opportunity. They flexed their batting and bowling muscles to floor the rivals in the first game of the fivematch series. Two knocks at over 200-plus strike-rate — an opening onslaught by Abhishek Sharma and Rinku Singh’s mighty finish and some skilful bowling by Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh and Varun Chakravarthy enabled them to a 48-run win at Jamtha Stadium in Nagpur on Wednesday.Sharma hit eight sixes in his 84-run knock, while Rinku Singh hit three en route to an unbeaten 44 to set New Zealand a 239-run target.The total looked even more humongous as New Zealand lost two wickets in as many overs with just one run on the board. Arshdeep Singh got the big fish Devon Conway caught in the slips for a duck in the first over. Hardik Pandya, sharing the new ball, accounted for Rachin Ravindra in the second over.Barring a fourth-wicket partnership between Glenn Phillips and Mark Chapman, nothing much posed a challenge for the Indian bowlers. However, Axar Patel and Varun Chakravarthy sent the two back in successive overs as New Zealand slid to 143 for 5. Phillips’ (78; 40b; 4x4; 6x6) mistimed shot was caught at long-on by Shivam Dube.Chapman, earlier given a reprieve by Rinku Singh, was caught by Sharma off Chakravarthy. The two added 79 runs in 42 balls. The only worry for India will be the injury to the bowling hand of Axar, which stopped him from completing his quota of overs and compelled him to watch the closing moments of the match with his left hand bandaged from the dug out.They will also be upset with the two dropped chances by Rinku and Ishan Kishan. Apart from the toss, nothing went New Zealand’s way on Wednesday. The powerplay overs saw the Kiwis’ ploy of taking the pace off the ball yield two wickets — that of Sanju Samson and Kishan. The lack of pace, though, did not bother Sharma much, as he was in the mood to muscle sixes all over the ground.Sharma’s first scoring shot was a six, a straight drive off Jacob Duffy in the first over. In the 12th over by Ish Sodhi, Sharma hit two more sixes, taking his tally to eight and India’s score to 147. The opener tried for another maximum in the same over which saw the ball go high but not long enough. Kyle Jamieson took a well-judged catch to end Sharma’s whirlwind knock of 84 (35b; 5x4; 8x6).Prior to Sharma’s dismissal, Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav, coming in at his preferred No 4 spot, went past the 30-run mark for the first time in his last eight innings.The introduction of spin after the powerplay saw him stutter a bit. Santner induced two false strokes from Surya in his first two overs, before accounting for his opposite number in the third. SKY gave him the charge but failed to time the ball and holed out at long-on.—Stats: Rajesh Kumar",India beat New Zealand by 48 runs in the first T20I match in Nagpur. Abhishek Sharma hit eight sixes in his 84-run knock. Rinku Singh hit three en route to an unbeaten 44 to set New Zealand a 239-run target.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127096992,imgsize-195428,width-400,resizemode-4/ind-vs-nz-t20i.jpg"

Who was Sebastian Charles?

Academic Dedication: He was known for making his Year 4 lessons engaging and accessible to all.

Warm Personality: A ""steady presence"" who was deeply valued by his peers for his kindness and strong character.

Community Connection: He had already become a recognizable and loved figure around the school grounds, known for his welcoming smile and positive energy.

Impact





A beloved Year 4 teacher at Durham School Dubai tragically lost his life in a road accident over the weekend, sending shock waves through the school community. Principal Kieran McLaughlin confirmed the sad news in a message to parents, explaining that Sebastian Charles, who had joined the school only recently, was well-liked by pupils and staff alike and had quickly made a positive impact.Although he hadn’t been at the school long, Charles’s caring nature and professional dedication made him a favourite among the children, and his sudden passing deeply saddened the entire community.In his letter to parents, Principal McLaughlin expressed how devastating the loss is for a community built around learning and hope. He wrote that such moments are particularly hard because schools symbolise future aspirations, and losing a respected member of staff affects everyone deeply.To help students cope, the school has arranged for a grief counsellor from a private hospital to be available for any pupil needing emotional support. Parents were asked to communicate with their child’s class teacher if they think additional help is needed.McLaughlin also encouraged families to talk openly with their children about the tragedy, noting that every child may react differently and that extra care and understanding are important during such a difficult period.Sebastian Charles was more than just a teacher; he was described by the school leadership as a popular educator who ""quickly established himself"" and won the hearts of the children in his class. Colleagues and parents alike noted his infectious enthusiasm and the genuine care he showed for every student under his wing.The school's principal highlighted that even in his brief tenure, Mr. Charles had left an indelible mark:In recognition of the somber mood and to show respect for Charles’s memory, the school decided to postpone its planned sports day events for EYFS and Key Stage 1 that had been scheduled for the following Wednesday. These activities will now take place next week, allowing the community time to grieve.The principal asked the school community to honour Charles respectfully and avoid speculation, especially on social media, during this sensitive time. He assured parents that in due course the school will find an appropriate way to remember Mr Charles.The loss of an educator is a loss for the entire city. In a transient city like Dubai, teachers often become a ""second family"" for expat children, making such tragedies feel deeply personal for everyone involved. As the school prepares to honor his memory with a formal service, the outpouring of love from parents and former colleagues across the UAE serves as a testament to the fact that it is not the length of time one spends in a role, but the depth of the heart they bring to it.",Sebastian Charles was a Year 4 teacher at Durham School Dubai.

Canadian former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and pop star Katy Perry turned Davos into a very unexpected flirtatious event this week, cheekily winking at each other as the politician took the stage at the World Economic Forum The 41-year-old pop star slipped into the crowd at The Female Quotient lounge on Tuesday, keeping things low-key — until she locked eyes with the former Canadian prime minister. One wink later, Trudeau was grinning like a man who’d just won both an electionbackstage passes.In a clip shared to Instagram, Female Quotient wrote: ""The room was packed, the energy was high and Katy kept it low-key, cheering them on. A reminder that showing up matters.""Justin was joined on stage by his former Chief of Staff Katie Telford, to discuss women and under-represented voices. Katy prepared to watch the former Canadian Prime Minister discuss the importance of soft power in geopolitics.The couple, who first sparked dating rumours in July, have since forged a firm bond, frequently spotted out and about on lavish jaunts. In November, insiders told People about the couple's flourishing romance, which left both showbiz fans and politicos in shock when they went public in October in Paris.Katy and Justin's relationship debut came at her 41st birthday bash in the French capital, just days after images showed the duo enjoying a steamy boat day. The songstress announced her split from fiancé Orlando Bloom around the same time as the whispers began - something sources claim she did not 'expect'.Arriving at the event, Katy left her kooky style at the door in favour of a muted ensemble. The unlikely couple held hands as they entered the venue in the Swiss town, where other stars including Matt Damon and David Beckham were in attendance.Her chic ensemble comprised a tight skirt and cropped cardigan while her trademark raven locks were pulled into a conservative low chignon. The mother-of-one paired the look with chunky gold square earrings and a pair of oversized sunglasses while adding a splash of colour with pink lipstick.Katy looked stunning as she glammed up to throw her support behind the politician, who was being snapped by adoring viewers while giving his speech. Matt meanwhile was snapping selfies with fans while rocking a smattering of salt and pepper stubble and a smart suit and polo shirt combo, Daily Mail reported.Katy and Justin's latest jaunt was less posh eateries and more political discussions, however the stunner looked delighted to be joined by her boyfriend, with whom she previously said she is ""having a lot of fun.""Sources have now said: ""Justin keeps making a big effort to see her and she's excited about it. [She has] a lot of fun with him. It's exactly what she needs right now.""On how the relationship has changed the politician, the source added: ""He is a much happier person now.

She's very happy...""She's trying to keep it low-key, and they've spent a lot of private time together. She’s not looking to publicize this relationship.""Over the summer, representatives told Daily Mail: 'Orlando and Katy have been shifting their relationship over the past many months to focus on co-parenting....""They will continue to be seen together as a family, as their shared priority is — and always will be — raising their daughter with love, stability, and mutual respect.""","Justin Trudeau and Katy Perry attended Davos together.

An Indian origin investor has sparked a debate online after sharing his experience in India when he went to meet his mother back in the country and called life in Australia a ""gift.""Investor Bhavdip Sanghvi praised Australia and said that the country offers safety, clean air & water, rule of law, freedom to build wealth, dignity, opportunity without discrimination.In a post on X, Sanghvi said, ""I’m in India right now visiting my mum And every damn time I come back here, one thing becomes clearer than ever: Australia 🇦🇺 is a fucking gift. To all the people living in Australia who constantly whinge, abuse the system, disrespect the country, trash the values, and still enjoy every benefit it gives you .... get some perspective or shut the fuck up.""""And yet some people wake up every day in one of the best countries on earth and act entitled like it owes them more. I’m NOT saying India is bad....this is my blood, my roots, my family ❤️ Open your eyes. See how hard life actually is for billions of people. Australia didn’t have to give immigrants anything.

There is no question of abusing the “country” or “land” anywhere. If people have behaved differently in past or present, that is a separate matter and requires caution.""Another user said, ""Australia really is a great place and its easy to take it for granted. you are right about the need for perspective. gratitude and respect are key.""Some users slammed the investor and said, ""So Australians shouldn’t complain about over expensive and ahitty housing. Australians should not complain about the high cost of living crisis.
