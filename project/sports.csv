Cowboys stars spark fan fury by filming music video post-humiliating defeat



The Dallas Cowboys , a team synonymous with grandeur and high expectations, find themselves at the center of an emotionally draining season. Once considered strong Super Bowl contenders, their trajectory has been riddled with setbacks, culminating in Dak Prescott’s devastating hamstring injury. With their star quarterback sidelined, hopes for a playoff push are hanging by a thread, leaving fans grappling with frustration and disappointment.The turmoil only deepened after a video surfaced showing CeeDee Lamb and Trevon Diggs enjoying themselves at a nightclub just hours after a crushing defeat to the Houston Texans. For a team that dropped to a dismal 3-7 record, the optics of key players celebrating amidst the chaos did not sit well with the faithful. While some fans expressed outrage over the perceived lack of focus, others saw this as an inevitable sign of a season already ""cooked.""The Cowboys’ dwindling postseason hopes rest precariously on upcoming matchups against the Washington Commanders. With seven games left in the regular season, Dallas trails the Philadelphia Eagles by five games in the NFC East. To keep their playoff dreams alive, they must secure victories in both head-to-head clashes against their archrivals, along with substantial help from other results across the league.Adding to the challenges, backup quarterback Cooper Rush now shoulders the immense task of reviving the team's fortunes. While Rush has shown glimpses of potential, the lack of confidence surrounding his ability to lead a turnaround is palpable. Meanwhile, head coach Mike McCarthy finds himself under mounting scrutiny. The inability to inspire consistent performances or defend their home turf has intensified calls for a leadership overhaul.Critics have pointed out that while injuries and on-field inconsistencies have plagued the Cowboys , the off-field distractions are equally damaging. The team’s focus, questioned by a fan who remarked, ""So they lost because they had their mind on a music video,"" paints a bleak picture of a franchise struggling to balance its image with its aspirations.Also Read: Texans-Cowboys clash draws 17 million viewers, setting Monday Night Football records for week 11 As Dallas braces for a pivotal showdown in two weeks, fans are left to wonder: will the Cowboys rise to the occasion, or will this season serve as a painful reminder of what could have been?

A Strong Start and a Wake-Up Call

Perkins' Praise: Redick as the Engine Behind the Lakers' Success

The Coach Behind the Lakers' Success

Star Performances Under Redick's Coaching

The Missing Piece: Redick's Leadership

JJ Redick's leadership has transformed the LA Lakers' early season performance, drawing praise from former NBA player and analyst Kendrick Perkins. Perkins, known for his animated debates with JJ Redick on ESPN's 'First Take,' discussed Redick's influence on the team during an episode of the ""Road Trippin'"" podcast.Also read - What went down in Nick Nurse’s meeting with Sixers? The coach responds after humiliating defeat against Heat Kendrick Perkins began by praising Redick for the Lakers' strong opening to the season. The Lakers kicked off with impressive performances, especially on their home court, but faced a dip during their five-game road trip. Redick, however, didn't shy away from holding his players accountable.Perkins highlighted that Redick publicly called out his team for lacking effort after their struggles on the road, a bold move that paid off. ""JJ f**ing Redick, let me give him a whole lot of props,"" Perkins said. His straightforward approach seemed to spark the Lakers, as they quickly bounced back with a winning streak once they returned home.Perkins also took to social media to further emphasize Redick's importance in the Lakers' turnaround. In a tweet, he wrote:""The Lakers are on a 5-game winning streak… and yes, AD and Bron are playing on a different level, but the MF that’s making that engine run is JJ 'MF' Redick!!!""This tweet was Perkins’ way of underlining that while the superstar performances of Anthony Davis and LeBron James are crucial, Redick’s leadership is what has truly driven the team’s success.Since taking over as head coach, JJ Redick has helped the Lakers regain momentum and shape a more focused and disciplined team. For the first time in years, the Lakers started their season with a 3-0 record, a feat not achieved since the Phil Jackson era in 2010. This early success has been a welcome change for fans who were accustomed to inconsistent performances under the previous head coach, Darvin Ham.Despite some setbacks, such as the road trip losses, Redick's no-nonsense approach has delivered results. His leadership has been instrumental in pushing players to elevate their game, with star players like Anthony Davis and LeBron James showing remarkable performances.Under Redick, the Lakers have seen individual players reach new heights. Anthony Davis has been a standout, putting together an MVP-worthy season with impressive averages of 31.1 points, 11.2 rebounds, and multiple blocks and steals per game. LeBron James, not to be outdone, made history with four consecutive triple-doubles, a career first for him.Rookie Dalton Knecht has also impressed, scoring 27 points against the New Orleans Pelicans and proving his worth on the court. These performances show that Redick’s coaching has brought out the best in his players, pushing them to play at a higher level.For many Lakers fans, it seems clear that JJ Redick’s leadership was the missing link the team needed. His willingness to confront issues head-on and demand accountability has already begun to pay off in a big way. While it's still early in the season, the early signs point to Redick having a significant positive impact on the Lakers, and the team will be hoping to continue this momentum as the season progresses.Also read - Former Warriors Gilbert Arenas lashed out at Doc Rivers' coaching method for Bucks","JJ Redick's leadership has transformed the LA Lakers' early season performance, drawing praise from former NBA player and analyst Kendrick Perkins.

Mohammed Shami returns, India get boost ahead of Border-Gavaskar Trophy | BTB Highlights

NEW DELHI: As Indian cricket holds its breath over Mohammed Shami 's fitness, TOI has learnt that the Indian cricket board's ( BCCI ) medical team have a tentative timeline of another 10 days to infer if he is ready for international cricket.Shami made his comeback in competitive cricket after a year in Ranji Trophy match for Bengal last week. While he came out of the match claiming seven wickets in two innings, it is learnt that the BCCI's medical team has been travelling with him and is checking up on him after each spell.TOI understands that the medical team and the selectors want to see how his body holds up after a round of Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (SMAT) matches. BCCI's head of sports science Nitin Patel and National Cricket Academy (NCA) trainer Nishant Bordoloi have taken over Shami 's training and recovery routine even when he is with the Bengal team.One of the issues with Shami's recovery is that he needs to shed a decent amount of weight that he put on during his recovery from an ankle surgery and then developing swollen knees last month.""The Indian team management wanted him to ideally play a couple of first-class matches before taking a call on his participation in the five-Test series in Australia. Since the Ranji Trophy first leg is over, the first round of SMAT matches has been kept as a makeshift yardstick. The medical team feels he will start losing weight as he keeps playing matches that will help him build his endurance,"" a BCCI source told TOI.Patel and Bordoloi will be reaching Rajkot on Thursday where Shami will be with the Bengal for SMAT that begins on Nov 23. ""Shami too has been very careful. His bowling skills are never in doubt. He is clocking 135 kmph and above consistently. But one needs to be seen is that when he can let go of the dependency on BCCI's medical team which is treating him after every spell that he is bowling. They are checking if his knees are swelling up again,"" the source added.While there is speculation that Shami may be sent to Australia for the latter half of the tour, TOI understands that it won't be a straightforward call for the selectors.""Bowling two-over spells in T20 matches in SMAT isn't the ideal parameter. To maintain intensity in high-profile Test series is a different ball game. There is a chance he could be sent to train with the Indian team if he clears the SMAT challenge but to play him will be a good call. The selectors are also wary about the ICC Champions Trophy in Feb,"" the source said.","Medical team travelling with him monitors weight, timeline of another 10 days to judge fitness.

Hamstring woes behind him, Mike Evans rejoins Buccaneers



Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans is set to make his long-awaited return to the field this week against the New York Giants . Evans, who has been sidelined for the past three games due to a hamstring injury, is expected to provide a significant boost to the Buccaneers' struggling offense. The absence of Evans and fellow receiver Chris Godwin has been keenly felt by the Buccaneers. Since their injuries, the team has struggled to maintain their earlier offensive momentum. With Evans back in the lineup, the Buccaneers hope to rekindle their offensive firepower and improve their chances of clinching a playoff berth.After a challenging three-week absence, Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans is set to return to the field against the New York Giants. Evans, sidelined by a hamstring injury sustained during Week 7 against the Baltimore Ravens, left an undeniable void in Tampa Bay's offense. His injury came moments after a career milestone, becoming only the 11th NFL player to record 100 receiving touchdowns, all achieved with the same team—a feat matched by just four other players. While diagnosed as ""moderate"" by head coach Todd Bowles, the impact of Evans' absence was anything but moderate for the team.Tampa Bay's offensive rhythm faltered without Evans and fellow receiver Chris Godwin, who also exited the Ravens game due to injury. The Buccaneers, who had averaged an impressive 248.3 passing yards per game during their 4-3 start, saw a decline to 208 yards over the next four games, compounded by a series of one-score losses. Even with quarterback Baker Mayfield maintaining respectable efficiency, the absence of Evans and Godwin shifted the offensive focus to tight ends and running backs, as new faces like Sterling Shepard were integrated into the lineup.Evans' return against a struggling Giants defense—ranked 31st in passing DVOA against WR1s—offers a glimmer of hope for Tampa Bay. His chemistry with Mayfield has been evident all season, commanding a 20.4% target share. When Evans was active in Weeks 1-7, Mayfield’s passer rating stood at 107.1, compared to 96.3 during Weeks 8-11 in Evans' absence. Although Mayfield’s performance didn’t collapse without Evans, the team’s decline was unmistakable.The upcoming schedule provides a favorable opportunity for the Buccaneers to regain momentum. With matchups against the Giants, Panthers, and Raiders—all teams with subpar records—the path back to playoff contention is achievable. Tampa Bay's playoff chances, currently at 23%, could improve significantly if they capitalize on these games. However, a long-term push requires defensive improvements, as their recent struggles on that side of the ball have been costly.Also Read: Commanders’ Legend Rips Giants’ QB Shuffle, Calls Tommy DeVito Move a Desperate Attempt Evans' presence might not solve all the Buccaneers' woes, but his return injects much-needed energy and leadership.

Three-time Davis Cup winners Germany eased into the semi-finals with a 2-0 victory against Canada on Wednesday.Jan-Lennard Struff defeated Denis Shapovalov 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7/5) to avenge Germany's defeat in the 2022 quarter-finals by eventual victors Canada.Daniel Altmaier beat Gabriel Diallo 7-6 (7/5), 6-4 in the opening singles rubber to send Germany ahead in the quarter-final clash.Germany, who last won the competition in 1993, will face Netherlands in the final four after they defeated Spain to bring the curtain down on Rafael Nadal's 23-year career ""It was a very good, tough game, Shapa was firing his serves in, first serves and second serves... he was changing directions a lot, it was tough to read the serve,"" said Struff.""The court was pretty fast so it was tough to stay calm.

They counted on me to deliver and I didn't deliver, so that's on me,"" said Diallo.Altmaier admitted he felt extremely nervous ahead of the match.""Definitely the nerves were a lot, I was saying to the captain in the morning when I was warming up I was really nervous coming up to the match,"" he said.""I guess (it) helps me a lot to communicate this openly, not to hide away my nerves.""","Germany beat Canada 2-0 in Davis Cup quarter-final in Malaga.

IND vs AUS 1st Test Live: India Need to Take Some Tough Playing XI Calls for WACA Test

NEW DELHI: All eyes will be on spinners as they may have a subtler, but significant, role in the high-profile Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, starting on November 22 in Perth, where pace-friendly conditions typically dominate.Australia's Nathan Lyon could be a game-changer, leveraging bounce and turn on dry, deteriorating pitches late on. For India, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, and Washington Sundar -- who was given the chance ahead of left-arm spinner Axar Patel -- will need to be spot-on with their skills to extract bounce and maintain accuracy.While the primary impact is likely to come from fast bowlers, spinners can still influence outcomes by breaking partnerships and exploiting rough patches on days four and five. Their effectiveness will depend on the pitch conditions and match situations throughout the series.Team India has preferred Jadeja over Ashwin on foreign tours in recent years, but the time has come for Team India to change their plans in Perth and come up with an out-of-the-box thinking and bring Ashwin in to outplay the mighty Aussies on their home ground.Former India captain Sourav Ganguly recently voiced his opinion on the key selection debate, suggesting that Ashwin should feature in India's playing XI for the opening Test in Perth. Ganguly backed Ashwin due to Australia's heavy reliance on left-handed batters, against whom the offie has proven highly effective. His record of exploiting left-handers with sharp off-spin and tactical variations could provide India with a critical edge in the series opener.Without a doubt, Jadeja and Sundar are stronger batters compared to Ashwin. However, Ashwin's exceptional ability to claim wickets during critical moments sets him apart as a match-winner. His mastery over spin bowling coupled with his tactical variations, make him an indispensable asset in challenging conditions.Ashwin and Jadeja have contrasting records in Australia, showcasing their unique strengths. Ashwin, with 39 wickets in 10 Tests at an average of 42.15 and a best of 4-55, has been a consistent performer. Meanwhile, Jadeja's record stands out for its efficiency: 14 wickets in just four Tests at an impressive average of 21.78, with a best of 4-62.Sundar, who recently delivered impressive performances against New Zealand at home, has also made a strong case for inclusion in the playing XI. His Test debut at the Gabba in 2021 was nothing short of remarkable, showcasing his prowess with both bat and ball.Sundar picked up four wickets in that match, his only Test appearance in Australia to date. More notably, he played a crucial match-winning innings, scoring 62 runs in a vital 123-run partnership with Shardul Thakur.Off-spinner Lyon, who has the ability to pose a significant threat to Indian batters, recently revealed that he has been closely analysing footage of Ashwin's bowling to gain valuable insights.“He’s taught me a lot. I’m a big believer in the players that you play against are your best coaches that you eventually come across. I’ve watched a lot of his footage heading over to India, the way he goes about it here in Australia, see if I can pick up anything,” Lyon toldLyon, who has had considerable success against India over the years, sees Ashwin's tactical brilliance as a source of inspiration.“There’s so much to learn in this great game, and there’s so much for me to learn off Ash. He’s a world-class bowler. He’s taken over 500 Test match wickets and he should be extremely proud of that,” the 36-year-old added.Lyon has an outstanding record against India, with 121 wickets in 27 Tests, including nine five-wicket hauls and two 10-wicket match hauls. His ability to consistently trouble India's batters underlines his dominance in this high-stakes rivalry. In home conditions, Lyon has been even more formidable, amassing 259 wickets in 67 Tests played in Australia.Australia will be keen to make amends for their previous defeats to India in the five-match Border-Gavaskar Trophy , having lost at home in both the 2018-19 and 2020-21 series.","Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Nathan Lyon will carry the spin bowling responsibilities in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

India Need to Take a Big Call on the Pace Bowling Department for Perth Test

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Harbhajan Singh voiced his concerns about the team's composition ahead of the opening Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Perth.Team India is reportedly considering giving all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy his first Test cap in the opening match. Nitish has received an unexpected call-up after his recent debut in T20 Internationals against Bangladesh.Harbhajan Singh, during a discussion on Jatin Sapru's YouTube channel, emphasized the limited experience in Reddy's first-class career. The 21-year-old has played 23 matches, accumulating 779 runs at an average of 21.05 and claiming 56 wickets at an average of 26.98.Harbhajan questioned the decision to place such a crucial responsibility on Reddy in the demanding conditions of Perth. The former spinner also highlighted the absence of Shardul Thakur , who played a key part in India's notable series victory in Australia during the 2020-21 season.""You needed an all-rounder like Hardik Pandya . But you don't have an option but to play Nitish Kumar Reddy. Where is Shardul Thakur? Where is Hardik Pandya? We just confined them to shorter formats. Suddenly, on a tour like this, you're asking Nitish to bowl,"" Harbhajan said.Harbhajan suggested that Reddy's role might be comparable to the bowling contributions of former captain Sourav Ganguly , providing a few overs of medium pace and potentially picking up crucial breakthroughs.""What he can do is just bowl a few overs here and there like Sourav Ganguly did, and if he gets 1-2 wickets, then that would be a bonus,"" Harbhajan added.As the first Test is set to commence at Perth's Optus Stadium on Friday, there are questions being raised about the team's approach to selection.","Harbhajan Singh questions India's selection of all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy.

Why India will miss Cheteshwar Pujara in Australia? | #BTBHighlights

A typical cricket highlights package is curated for fans who've missed live action due to work or school. In the past, those highlights lasted 30 minutes and the contents featured boundaries and wickets. But to cater to modern diminished attention spans and the swipe generation, even highlights these days last only 15 minutes or less.Hence, the ball that is left alone by the batter is not captured.""Well left"". An event that frustrates fast bowlers after pounding in from 30 yards and they see no result. They then bowl in areas where the batter wants, only for him to cash in. Cheteshwar Pujara , one of the architects of India's last two series wins Down Under, built his entire game around defence and leaving deliveries on length.If you were lucky to wake up in the early hours on that miracle Tuesday of Jan 19, 2021, to witness India take the first steps towards engineering that incredible heist at Gabba, that one shot-the Pujara leave-especially against Pat Cummins , became a vital recurring theme.Cummins, named Player of the Series for his lung-bursting exploits of labour and skill, dismissed Pujara five times in that series, but the Saurashtra rock faced 459 balls from him. Overall, he faced 928 deliveries. That meant Australia's most potent weapon used up 49% of his bowling arsenal and energy reserves at just one Indian batter.On THAT Day Five in 2021, when Cummins largely operated from the end where the ball was misbehaving from a length, Pujara 56 (211b), literally sewed that end up, chewing deliveries, taking nine painful blows (finger, elbow, box, helmet, repeat) and was there till the last hour of the chase, by when most of the bowlers', especially Cummins' fuel tanks, were running empty.He had done the same during India's 'victorious draw' at Sydney, where he made 77 in 205 balls.In the 2018-19 series where Pujara scored three tons and was player-of-the-series, he faced 1258 deliveries. Pujara will be a part of the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy too, but only as a commentator on the Hindi feed.And Australian pacer Josh Hazlewood expressed happiness at not having to deal with Pujara.Speaking to reporters ahead of the first Test at Perth on Friday, Hazlewood said, ""I'm happy that Puj isn't here. He's one that bats time, makes you earn his wicket every time and has done well in Australia on all these tours."" Tim Paine , former Australia wicketkeeper and the skipper when they lost back-to-back series at home to India, stressed, ""A lot of people talk about Rishabh Pant in the last series in Australia, but the guy who won them the series was Pujara. He wore us down and wore our fast bowlers down. He kept getting hit on the body but kept getting up. There is still place for that in cricket,"" Paine said in the Grade Cricketer podcast.Australia are hoping that Marnus Labuschagne will do that role for them as they hope to cook the inexperienced Indian fast bowlers, especially Jasprit Bumrah with attritional play before the series gets to the flatter surfaces of Melbourne and Sydney.Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Labuschagne hinted that playing the long game will help Australia. ""We understand that getting the Indian bowlers back for their second and third spells, putting them under pressure and letting them come to us and us putting pressure back on them through overs in the field and time in the game, especially over a five-Test series, that's important. Because as you get into the third, fourth, fifth Test, if they're trying to play the same team, and those bowlers are rolling into 100, 150, 200 overs by the third Test, it's going to make a big difference,"" the No. 3 batter said.The question for India though is who will essay Pujara's role in a line-up that is not short of bravado, but woefully short of form and confidence. KL Rahul , who is now tipped to open with Yashasvi Jaiswal, left a lot of deliveries during successful outings in England and South Africa in 2021. If he recalibrates his defensive game, he could do the Pujara role, as pace does not hurry him.Dhruv Jurel used up more than 300 balls while scoring twin fifties on a helpful MCG track batting for India 'A' vs Australia 'A'. With the ability to play close to the body, could he do a Pujara, even at No. 6?","Cummins dismissed Pujara five times in that series, but the Saurashtra rock faced 459 balls from him. That meant Australia's most potent weapon used up 49% of his bowling arsenal and energy reserves at just one Indian batter. Australia are hoping Marnus Labuschagne will do that role for them as they hope to cook the inexperienced Indian fast bowlers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115510350,imgsize-36002,width-400,resizemode-4/115510350.jpg"

Champions Trophy in PAK: More drama as Jay Shah strongly objects PCB's PoK plans

NEW DELHI: In a recent viral video , a Pakistani cricket fan faced an unusual situation at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Australia.The fan, proudly sporting a Pakistan cricket jersey and holding a photo of former Prime Minister Imran Khan lifting the 1992 World Cup trophy, was approached by a stadium steward.The official issued an ultimatum: surrender the photo or leave the premises. ""Either you give it to me or you go home,"" the steward is heard saying in the clip.Watch:The incident has sparked heated debate online, with fans questioning whether the steward’s actions were warranted.Imran Khan, a legendary cricketer and captain of Pakistan’s historic 1992 World Cup victory, remains an iconic figure in cricket.However, his political career has made him a polarizing figure internationally, and the display of his image in a public venue may have prompted the steward’s intervention.This comes at a time when Khan’s political and legal battles dominate headlines. After being ousted from power in a no-confidence vote in 2022, Khan faces over 150 cases, including graft allegations involving state gifts.While a Pakistani court recently granted him bail in one case, Khan remains entangled in multiple trials and convictions, some carrying hefty sentences.He has denied all charges, maintaining they are politically motivated.Meanwhile, Pakistan cricket faces its own challenges. Recently, the national team suffered a 3-0 whitewash in a T20I series against Australia.On the other hand, the country is looking forward to hosting the ICC Champions Trophy in 2025. India is reluctant to send its team to Pakistan for the prestigious ICC tournament, prompting a standoff situation between the two nations.Amid the uncertainties, the trophy tour, currently underway in Pakistan, aims to rekindle excitement among fans by travelling through cities like Islamabad, Abbottabad, and Karachi.",A Pakistani cricket fan faced an unusual situation at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Australia.

NEW DELHI: India's recent batting struggles against teams like Bangladesh and New Zealand have raised concerns, particularly ahead of the crucial Border-Gavaskar Trophy series in Australia.India's batting order has been a cornerstone of their success, but performing in Australian conditions has historically presented challenges. With fast, bouncy pitches and aggressive bowlers, it demands a solid strategy, adaptability and resilience.India has struggled to build strong partnerships and early wickets against Bangladesh and middle-order collapses against New Zealand exposed this weakness.Against Bangladesh, quick dismissals left India playing catch-up. Versus New Zealand, the middle order crumbled under pressure.In Australia, Indian batters need to focus on rotating the strike and avoiding extended dry patches, ensuring a steady flow of runs even under pressure.Swinging conditions exploited by Trent Boult and disciplined spin bowling from Bangladesh exposed technical gaps. Indian openers and middle-order batters failed to adapt quickly to movement and slower surfaces.India's top-order must set the tone in Australia. Players like Rohit Sharma Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill need to negotiate the new ball effectively against Australia's world-class pace attack, featuring the likes of Pat Cummins Josh Hazlewood , and Mitchell Starc India's middle order has seen frequent changes recently. Consistent contributions from Virat Kohli , KL Rahul and Risbhan Pant would be crucial. Kohli, with his vast experience in Australia, could be pivotal in anchoring the innings.India's batting often leans heavily on players like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. When they fail, the team struggles to post competitive totals. In recent games, Kohli's early dismissals left a void that others couldn't fill.Australia's pitches, particularly at grounds like the Gabba and Perth, can be intimidating. Indian batters need to stay patient, play late, and avoid over-committing to drives. The middle order must take more responsibility. Youngsters like Shubman Gill need to seize opportunities.All-rounders like Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin must provide depth and finish strongly. Their ability to counter-attack and rotate strike is essential for the lower middle order.Each batter should have a defined role and India should consider left-right combinations to disrupt Australian bowlers' rhythm.If India can adapt to the conditions, maintain partnerships, and utilize their batting depth, they stand a strong chance to succeed Down Under.There's no doubt that India's batting order has the talent to bounce back stronger and perform consistently against a top-quality opposition like Australia.","India's batting order has been a cornerstone of their success, but performing in Australian conditions has historically presented challenges.

Champions Trophy in PAK: More drama as Jay Shah strongly objects PCB's PoK plans

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan pacer Shoaib Akhtar recently took centre stage as he joined the Champions Trophy tour in Pakistan, displaying his excitement for the prestigious ICC tournament set to take place in 2025.Sharing a moment of pride on social media, Akhtar posted a photo on platform X (formerly Twitter), captioned: “Landed back in Pakistan to this beauty. Champions Trophy in the house!!”Despite the celebratory mood, the road to hosting the Champions Trophy remains steeped in uncertainty.Tensions persist over whether the tournament will occur in Pakistan, feature a hybrid model, or be shifted entirely.The debate gained momentum when the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) informed the International Cricket Council (ICC) that India would not send its team to Pakistan, citing security and diplomatic concerns.In response, the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) has firmly opposed a hybrid model, arguing that hosting the tournament in its entirety is vital for showcasing Pakistan as a viable venue for international cricket.The ICC, meanwhile, faces a challenging balancing act as it considers the implications of the standoff.Akhtar recently weighed in on the issue in an interview, saying, ""It's really up to the governments. It's nothing to do with the BCCI. It is up to the BJP government. They will decide.""""There will be back channel talks. Even in days of war, there are back channel talks. We should not lose hope. We have to look forward to a solution. We know a fact that 95-98 per cent of sponsorship for ICC comes from India,"" the former fast bowler added.The stakes are high. Akhtar noted that Pakistan risks losing significant revenue if the Champions Trophy is relocated, while also missing a crucial opportunity to shed the stigma of being an unsuitable host for marquee events.""If Pakistan fails to convince India to come to Pakistan, then two things will happen: Pakistan will lose about 100 million dollars of the sponsorship that will go to ICC and the host country will earn. Second, it would be better if India comes and plays in Pakistan. But it's really, really up to the government. It has nothing to do with BCCI.""In a lighter vein, Akhtar also pictured the excitement of Indian star Virat Kohli playing in Pakistan, adding, “Virat Kohli is trying to play in Pakistan for the first time. Entire Pakistan wants to see Virat play in Pakistan. Imagine him scoring a century in Pakistan. It will be good; he doesn't score a century here and gets out early. It will be a full circle for him.”","Former Pakistan pacer Shoaib Akhtar joined the Champions Trophy tour in Pakistan.

As the impasse over the Champions Trophy hosting and scheduling continues, former Pakistan batsman Basit Ali has claimed that the tournament's official broadcaster has said 'no' to the hybrid model or to have India and Pakistan in different pools.After the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) refused to send the Indian team to Pakistan -- the designated hosts of the tournament, the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) has taken a tough stance with strong objection to a hybrid model, which will allow India to play their matches at a neutral venue, while the rest of tournament is hosted in Pakistan.In fact, the PCB chairman, Mohsin Naqvi, has gone on record to say that the hybrid model is not acceptable to Pakistan.With huge amounts of financial gains from an International Cricket Council ( ICC ) tournament dependent on the India vs Pakistan game and both the nations sticking to their decisions, the announcement of the schedule is understandably on hold as a tournament without either of the teams will take the sheen off it.""What did I tell you about the Champions Trophy...Broadcaster isn't agreeing to (hybrid model or India and Pakistan in different pools) and it won't,"" said Basit in a video on his YouTube channel. ""If there is no India-Pakistan match in a tournament, then it would be like a tasteless dish.""The former middle-order batsman added that Pakistan has made the right moves, which has put the ICC in a fix, where they have to not only satisfy both the BCCI and the PCB, but also the broadcaster, who won't be ready to bear any financial losses in the event of no India-Pakistan match.""PCB has played its cards very well, well done!...If you want to go ahead with the hybrid model, do it. But India and Pakistan won't be in the same pool, and Pakistan will play all their matches at home,"" said Basit.""Mohsin Naqvi is quietly sitting now. He has played his cards correctly.""Basit added ""ICC pareshan hai (is worried)"" while the world is watching the four-way game being played in the apex body's corridors.""BCCI sends a message to the ICC, and it is relayed to the PCB. Then the PCB sends a message to the ICC, and it is forwarded to the BCCI. Then the broadcaster jumped in and asked 'what's happening, this is not agreeable to us'.""Both broadcaster and the ICC are having sleepless nights.""The Champions Trophy, which is scheduled for February 19 to March 9 next year in Pakistan, is making a return to the ICC calendar after seven years.",Former Pakistan batsman Basit Ali claims that the tournament's official broadcaster has said 'no' to the hybrid model or to have India and Pakistan in different pools.

CUMMINS, SMITH, LYON AUSSIES TO WATCH

The Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) is less than 48 hours away, and Ravi Shastri is one who knows the inside-out of a tour of Australia both as a former all-rounder and former India coach. In the latest episode of the 'The ICC Review', Shastri picked the Indian and Australian players to watch out for.Australia will host India for a five-match BGT beginning Perth on November 22, where India will not just defend the trophy but also try to stay in the top two of the World Test Championship (WTC) table after conceding their top spot to Australia after the 0-3 whitewash at home against New Zealand.Shastri, who was India's coach during the historic triumphs on the last two tours of Australia, said Yashasvi Jaiswal among the batters and Jasprit Bumrah among the bowlers are the two players who would be his pick to make an impact for India.""Jaiswal at the top because if he gets in, he can be devastating. You know he plays spin very well, he plays at his own tempo, he's got all the shots in the book,"" Shastri said.""He's an entertainer, so if he gets in as we've seen in his career already, you know he has the ability to get the big scores. You don't hit two consecutive double hundreds, you know, just like that. You've got to have the hunger, you have to have the quality and the ability.""Jaiswal announced himself in international cricket with two consecutive double hundreds in the Test series at home against England earlier this year.Vice-captain and India's bowling spearhead Bumrah has an enviable record in Australia, which has seen him taking 32 wickets in seven matches at an average of just 21.25.Bumrah will lead India in the BGT opener in Perth as the team's regular skipper Rohit Sharma won't be available. Rohit has stayed back in India after the birth of his child earlier this month and is likely to join the team ahead of the second Test.""I think Jasprit, no question,"" said Shastri about his second pick. ""Because he's the best fast bowler in the world. There's no question about that...and you'd expect him at this stage of his career, where at times he makes the ball talk, to be the highest wicket-taker,"" said Shastri.Among the Australia squad, Shastri said seasoned campaigners in captain and fast bowler Pat Cummins, veteran batter Steve Smith and off-spin great Nathan Lyon will be the players that can make the difference for the hosts.Talking about Cummins, he has 35 wickets to his credit from the last eight BGT Tests at home, averagint 23.14.Putting Lyon in the same bracket, Shastri said you can't ""take your eye"" off a man who has always troubled India, both in India and at home.""Pat Cummins will be at you. He's relentless. I mean, don't take your eye off Nathan Lyon because he has a fantastic record against India, both at home and away. So he'll be someone to watch but Pat Cummins because if Australia have to damage early doors and then later on, it will be Cummins,"" Shastri reckoned.Picking Smith as his choice among the Australian batting unit, Shastri said: ""Steve Smith because of his experience, because of his past record; and he's at that stage of his career where he needs a challenge. He needs a challenge, and I think he'll be up for it,"" said the 1983 World Cup winner.""It could be his final series against India, so that's another way to look at it. And just seeing his form in that couple of games against Pakistan makes me think in that fashion. And it's again, with these players, the Kohlis, the Smiths, it's how you start,"" he added.Shastri felt India need to put pressure on Smith early in the series because if he gets going in the first 2-3 innings, he will continue to plunder runs.""In the first three innings of the series, if he gets away with a hundred, then they'll keep badgering you. I think India will have to come hard; they'll have to be tight and they'll have to keep the pressure on. They have to be relentless with Smith early.""",The Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) is less than 48 hours away. Australia will host India for a five-match BGT beginning Perth on November 22.

Uttar Pradesh rode a brace from Mohammad Tauseef to defeat Jharkhand 2-1 in the day’s earlier match.Bengal came into the game with a scintillating form, blowing away Jharkhand (4-0) and UP (7-0) in their previous two matches and looked well-placed to top the group — a prerequisite for progressing to the next round. However, Sen was also aware of the challenge on hand given that Bihar could advance with a win by upstaging the hosts on a head-to-head count.Bengal started on the offensive but couldn’t breach Bihar’s well-planned defensive set-up.

KOCHI: Kerala will look to put their struggles behind them and stamp their authority in the Santosh Trophy National Football Championship when they begin their group campaign at home in Kozhikode on Wednesday.With a dozen newcomers in their roster, Kerala are banking on them to deliver and lay their hands on a trophy they last lifted three years ago in Kolkata.They face Railways in their opening fixture at the EMS Corporation Stadium, Kozhikode, on Wednesday.The group also includes Puducherry and Lakshadweep.

We will be taking one step at a time,” said Biby.The hosts’ defence seems to be their biggest strength, led by captain Sanju G and supported by experienced players Manoj M, Muhammed Aslam, and Adil Amal.

Uninspiring Argentina

Jeers for Brazil

Lautaro Martinez's goal gave Argentina a 1-0 win over Peru on Tuesday in a South American qualifying match in Buenos Aires and left the hosts close to a spot in the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada.Their main continental rivals Brazil drew 1-1 against Uruguay in Salvador, Brazil with two impressive goals in an otherwise lackluster match. Federico Valverde gave Uruguay the lead with a curled shot from the edge of the box, and Gerson netted his first for Brazil in similar fashion at the Arena Fonte Nova.Argentina lead South American qualifying with 25 points from 12 matches, five points clear of its closest competitor, Uruguay. Ecuador and Colombia are next with 19 points each.Brazil lag in fifth position with 18 points after several uninspiring performances, still hoping that striker Neymar will return from injury and fit in again. Paraguay, with 17 points, are in sixth place.South American qualifying will give six direct berths in the next World Cup. Seventh-place Bolivia, with 13 points, are in the international playoff position. Venezuela (12), Chile (9), and Peru (7) are out of qualifying spots.The next round of South American World Cup qualifying will be played in March.Martinez's goal was his 32nd for the national team, which puts him level with the legendary Diego Maradona.Until Martinez scored, Argentina's best chance was in the 21st minute, when striker Julian Alvarez hit the Peruvian goalkeeper's right post. Messi once again had a modest performance, as he did in his team's 2-1 defeat at Paraguay on Thursday.Messi crossed the ball in the penalty area in the 55th minute to give Martinez one of the few clear opportunities of the match. The striker moved his body with more grace than power to put the ball in the back of the next.Despite the disappointing performance at home, Lionel Messi's team will finish the year with few question marks beyond its performances in November.“We won Copa America, we lead South American World Cup qualifying,” said goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez. “We must be proud of ourselves.”Brazil fans at home in Salvador jeered their team after the final whistle. In a match with few opportunities for either side, Uruguay seemed closer to winning for most of the second half.Valverde opened the scoring in the 55th minute after Brazilian defenders failed three times to clear the ball from their penalty area. The Real Madrid midfielder hit the ball to the left corner to score. Gerson equalised in the 61st minute.Striker Raphinha said he understood the frustration from his team's fans, but disagreed with them.“We played great. We did everything we could to leave here with a victory. We must have our heads high up, it will be very tough to beat us,” he said.Also on Tuesday, Ecuador won 1-0 at Colombia with a goal by Enner Valencia in the seventh minute, in which he dribbled through three players before scoring. Ecuador lost defender Piero Hincapié to a red card in the 34th minute but held on for the win.Bolivia and Paraguay drew 2-2 in a match between teams that could end up fighting for the seventh position in the region's qualifying. Chile, one of the worst performing teams in the region this year, showed some fighting spirit and beat Venezuela 4-2.","Argentina lead South American qualifying with 25 points from 12 matches, five points clear of its closest competitor, Uruguay.

On the rebound, Safawi Bin Rasid's shot sailed over.Coach Marquez called it a fair result. ""We conceded an easy goal. We knew the game would not be easy. But in the end, the score is fair.
