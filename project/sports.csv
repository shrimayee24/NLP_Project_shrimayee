This defeat has intensified the pressure on them, and now they must secure victories in their remaining two matches to solidify their position in the playoffs .Meanwhile, the Rajasthan Royals find themselves in a slightly more comfortable position, sitting second in the standings with 16 points.

Chennai Super Kings have held a slight edge with 15 victories, while Rajasthan Royals have closely followed with 14 wins to their name.The pitch at Chennai's M. A. Chidambaram Stadium traditionally favors spinners, offering them assistance while still providing opportunities for batsmen. In the IPL 2024 season, the average first innings total at this venue has hovered around the early 180s across six matches. Given the trend, the team winning the toss is likely to choose to field first, as chasing teams have emerged victorious in four out of the six games played here this year.In terms of fantasy picks, the MA Chidambaram Stadium pitch has been favourable to batters who can build their innings steadily.

NEW DELHI: In the 60th IPL match, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) exhibited resilience against Mumbai Indians (MI) despite facing an early challenge. Venkatesh Iyer's explosive 21-ball 42 and Nitish Rana's resurgence with 33 runs laid a solid foundation for KKR, propelling them to a competitive total of 157/7 in 16 overs at Eden Gardens.The pivotal 37-run partnership between Iyer and Rana for the fourth wicket showcased their fine shot-making abilities and determination.Iyer's aggressive stroke-play, featuring six boundaries and two sixes, set the tone for KKR's innings, while Rana's composed batting provided valuable momentum. Andre Russell's quickfire 24 off 14 deliveries, along with contributions from Rinku Singh and Ramandeep Singh towards the end, further bolstered KKR's score.MI's opener, Ishan Kishan, launched a spirited attack with five fours and two sixes, including an inventive switch-hit boundary off Sunil Narine. Despite Kishan's aggressive start and MI's strong position of 59/0 in five overs, Narine and Harshit Rana orchestrated MI's downfall with clever bowling tactics, ultimately turning the tide in KKR's favour.Varun Chakravarthy 's 2 wickets helped him maintain his third position with 18 wickets, while Jasprit Bumrah's two crucial wickets for MI saw him reclaim the IPL 2024 purple cap with 20 wickets.In the 60th IPL match, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) displayed resilience against Mumbai Indians (MI).

In short:

How we calculate the chances:

With 10 games left to be played in the league stage of IPL 2024, there remain 1,024 possible combinations of match results. KKR are now sure to make the playoffs while MI and PBKS are totally ruled out.We look at the chances of each team:The team currently topping the table, their chances of finishing sole toppers have moved up to 50% with Saturday's win.Their chances of finishing joint toppers on points also moved up to 75%. At worst they can finish tied for second spot with one other team ( SRH ).KKR beating MI on Saturday meant that RR's chances of being sole toppers fell from 36% to 25% and their chances of at least tying for the top spot from 62.5% to 50%. They are still not sure of making the playoffs. If they lose all their remaining games, they could end up tied third with any two of CSK DC or LSG depending on results in other games. But there's an under 0.8% chance of such a scenario.Currently in third place, SRH have nearly 97% chance of finishing among the top four in terms of points. The best they can hope for is a joint first spot with one or two other teams and the chances of that are only at 1.6%.In fourth place, CSK have a little over 56% chance of finishing within the top four slots either singly or jointly. The best they can do is tied for second spot with one to three other teams. And the chances of that are just under 5%.Fifth placed DC have no chance of finishing the toppers or even joint toppers. Their chances of ending up among the top four singly or jointly are about 58%. Their best case scenario is joint second on points and there's a 2.3% chance of that happening.Sixth placed LSG's chances of making the top four singly or jointly are also about 58%. Like DC, the best they can do is tie for the second spot with one to three other teams. The chances of that happening are just 2.3%.RCB remain in seventh place and their chances of finishing among the top four on points, singly or jointly, are a tad over 20%. Their best case scenario is joint third with two to five other teams and the chances of that are a little under 5%.Currently eighth, GT still have a nearly 16% chance of making it to the top four on points, singly or jointly. Their best case scenario is joint third with three to five other teams and there's a less than 5% chance of that happening.Their run for the playoffs have ended. Even the chances of a joint fifth spot are a lowly 0.6%.MI too are out of the playoffs. They can at best end up joint 7th and even that is just a 2.3% chance.KKR are through to the playoffs. Bet on RR too making it and SRH most likely to join them, leaving CSK, LSG and DC battling it out for the fourth spot. For RCB or GT to get into the mix would need many results to go their way.With 10 games remaining, there remain 1,024 possible combinations of match outcomes. We look at each one of those and what it would mean in terms of the final rankings of the teams. Then we work out the percentage of outcomes that would give team ""A"" a chance of finishing in the top four, or the first spot and so on. The underlying assumption is that any given match is a 50-50 game, not unreasonable given how the IPL has unfolded this year and in other years. For instance, of the 1,024 combinations, RR finish at the top slot singly or jointly in 512 combinations, which means a 50% chance of being sole or joint toppers.","With 10 games remaining, there remain 1,024 possible combinations of match results.

NEW DELHI: The Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) will take on the Delhi Capitals ( DC ) in the 62nd match of the Indian Premier League (IPL 2024) at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium. Royal Challengers Bengaluru, after a series of wins, have revived their playoff hopes, but they face a different challenge against Delhi Capitals, who will be without their suspended captain Rishabh Pant.Pant was penalised for maintaining a slow over rate in a match against Rajasthan Royals, leading to his suspension for one game and a fine of Rs 30 lakh.Despite Pant's absence giving Royal Challengers Bengaluru an advantage, they must not become complacent. Currently seventh in the IPL 2024 points table with 10 points from 12 matches, a loss against Delhi Capitals will knock them out of the IPL 2024.Delhi Capitals, on the other hand, need to win their remaining two matches to strengthen their chances of making it to the top four. With six wins and six losses in twelve games, they are on fifth position in the IPL 2024 points table.In their head-to-head record, Royal Challengers Bengaluru have the upper hand, winning 18 out of 30 matches against Delhi Capitals, who have won 11 times, with one match ending without a result. IPL live score || IPL match result The pitch at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium is known to be batting-friendly, with good pace and bounce, making it conducive for stroke play.

The highest recorded total was 287/3 by Sunrisers Hyderabad against Royal Challengers Bengaluru, and the lowest recorded total was 147/10 by Gujarat Titans against Royal Challengers Bengaluru.The pitch is not a typical batter's paradise.

Spinners and bowlers with effective cutters have been successful on this pitch in IPL 2024.Virat Kohli has been in outstanding batting form throughout IPL 2024, amassing 634 runs in 12 innings. He is the safest choice for fantasy contests and leads the IPL 2024 orange cap list.The young Australian has impressed with his aggressive batting style, scoring 309 runs in 7 matches at a strike rate of 235.87.

NEW DELHI: A huge drama unfolded at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai during a match between Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Rajasthan Royals (RR). CSK's star allrounder Ravindra Jadeja became only the third cricketer in the history of the Indian Premier League (IPL) to be dismissed for obstructing the field.With this dismissal, Jadeja joined an exclusive list in IPL history, alongside Yusuf Pathan and Amit Mishra , as one of the few players to be dismissed for obstructing the field.In the crucial 16th over of the match, Jadeja steered a delivery from RR's Avesh Khan towards third man and took a single.However, he attempted a second run despite hesitation from his teammate and CSK captain Ruturaj Gaikwad.As Jadeja sprinted midway down the pitch, RR skipper and wicketkeeper Sanju Samson threw the ball towards the non-striker's end in an attempt to run Jadeja out, but it struck the allrounder on the back.An irate Samson swiftly appealed for obstructing the field, prompting the umpires to review the incident.Upon review by the third umpire, it was evident that Jadeja had changed his running path to avoid being run out, thus obstructing the field deliberately.The giant screen displayed the verdict OUT, indicating Jadeja's dismissal. Jadeja looked disappointed and made his way back to the pavilion.","CSK's star allrounder Ravindra Jadeja became only the third cricketer in the history of the Indian Premier League (IPL) to be dismissed for obstructing the field.

Royal Challengers Bengaluru registered their fifth straight win to improve their IPL playoff hopes with a 47-run thrashing of Delhi Capitals on Sunday.We look at the chances of the teams in contention: KKR have a 62.5% chance of finishing sole toppers and a 87.5% chance of finishing at least joint toppers, The worst they can do is tied for second with one other team ( SRH ). RR despite the loss on Sunday have a 12.5% chance of finishing sole toppers and a 37.5% chance of finishing joint toppers. The worst they can do is tied for third with two other teams ( CSK and LSG ), which means they could still theoretically fail to qualify.Third placed CSK have a nearly 91% chance of finishing among the top four on points, singly or jointly. Their best case scenario is tied for second with one to three other teams.SRH have a nearly 97% chance of making it to the top four slots on points, but only a 3% chance of tying for third spot with two other teams (KKR and RR). RCB , now in fifth place, have a better than 40% chance of making it to the top four on points. The best they can do, however, is tied for third spot with three to five other teams. The good news for them is that they currently have the best net run rate among all of those.Sixth placed DC have a 31.3% chance of making it to the top four slots on points, singly or jointly. Their best case scenario is tied for third with three to five other teams.Seventh placed LSG have a little over 56% chance of making it to the top four on points thanks to the extra game in hand. Their best case scenario is tied for second with one to three other teams.Eighth placed GT have a less than 16% chance of making it to the top four on points. Their best case scenario is tied for third with four or five other teams and their net run rate at the moment does not make that an attractive prospect.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru registered their fifth straight win to improve their IPL playoff hopes with a 47-run thrashing of Delhi Capitals on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: That MS Dhoni has a legendary stature in India is an open secret. And in Chennai, home of the Chennai Super Kings , the former captain is revered as a demi-god. CSK ended their home league stage in IPL 2024 with a five-wicket victory against Rajasthan Royals on Sunday.Speculation was rife that Dhoni may have played his last match at the Chepauk with rumours going around that this may be his last IPL season.But Dhoni, as always, is keeping his cards close to his chest and hasn't yet spilled the beans on his retirement and there is no doubt that an ear will end once ' Thala ' decides to call it quits.The official broadcaster of the tournament shared a video of Navjot Singh Sidhu in which the former cricketer-turned-commentator salutes the legendary status of Mahendra Singh Dhoni in his typical style.In the video Sidhu says, ""The world bows to the strong, not to the weak. It's the thoughts that count. Thoughts can make humans god or demon. All the miracles in the world are of thoughts. Your thoughts are the real interpreters of your actions."". And when he will retire from the game, an era will end. It's rare that mothers give birth to a great man and the stature of that great man grows and spreads like a cult, the legend grows, it happens every second. And the world always remembers great people like an institution. Mortals like me will come and go but an institution like Dhoni will continue to inspire generations to come and will be immortalized,"" Sidhu adds.Defending champions CSK rose to the third spot with the victory over the Royals and are in the running to make the playoffs and ended their highly successful home leg, winning five out of their seven matches at the Chepauk.",CSK ended their home league stage in IPL 2024 with a five-wicket victory against Rajasthan Royals on Sunday.

Left-arm pacer Yash Dayal (3/20) consumed Abhishek Porel, caught at covers by Lockie Ferguson, in the first ball of the third over.Delhi suffered a body blow in the very next ball. The in-form Jack-Fraser McGurk, who smashed Mohammed Siraj for two fours and a six in the second over, backed up too far as Shai Hope's straight drive rattled the stumps after taking a deflection of Dayal's outstretched left-hand.Siraj trapped Kumar Kushagra, who came in for the suspended Rishabh Pant, plumb in front with a nip-backer as DC slumped to 30 for four.Axar and Hope (29, 23b) added 56 runs for the fifth wicket off 36 balls but the partnership offered only temporary relief than any real hope to the visitors.Axar, who took over the reins of DC in the absence of Pant, played a handy innings, but it just delayed the inevitable.The rest of the DC batters were bogged down by a confused mind, best exemplified by the run out of Tristan Stubbs.Stubbs sprinted out of the non-striker's crease as if chased by a lion after Axar defended a length ball from Cameron Green, who quickly grabbed the ball and completed the simple task of hitting the stumps.Earlier, RCB could not exploit Patidar's quick fifty to the optimum, settling for an underwhelming 187 for nine.Patidar (52, 32b, 3x4, 3x6) and Jacks (41, 29b, 3x4, 2x6) added 88 runs off 53 balls for the third-wicket as RCB overcame the early departures of skipper Faf du Plessis and Virat Kohli .Du Plessis' slice off pacer Mukesh Kumar was gobbled up by McGurk near third man.Kohli gave signals of another T20 masterclass while creaming 27 off 13 balls, including two sixes off Ishant Sharma and one off Khaleel Ahmed (2/31).But a waft outside the off-stump with little foot movement resulted in a catch to stumper Abhishek Porel.RCB, however, found Patidar in full flow. His first scoring shot was a magnificent cover driven four off Mukesh and he never let that early momentum fade.The elegance soon gave way for brute force as Patidar brought forth his six-hitting abilities, smashing Axar for two sixes and sending Kuldeep Yadav over long-on for a maximum.The DC fielders too helped Patidar copiously. Hope dropped the right-hander on 42 off Kuldeep and five runs later Axar grassed him off pacer Rasikh Salam.At the other end, Jacks, who was given a reprieve on 19 by Axar off Kuldeep, displayed his untrammelled power and the left-arm wrist spinner was at the receiving end, watching the ball sailing over long-on twice.Just as the alliance was blossoming, DC managed to latch on to a catch.Axar atoned for his previous failures as he made a fine tumbling catch off Salam to terminate the stay of Patidar.Jacks soon followed his partner as a weak slap off Kuldeep ended in the hands of Axar at the edge of the ring.The dismissals of two set batters affected the run-scoring rate of RCB. From 137 for four in 14.4 overs they could only add 50 runs in the remaining overs.(With inputs from PTI)","Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Delhi Capitals by 47 runs in IPL.

(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings kept their hopes alive of securing an IPL playoffs berth, registering a five-wicket win against Rajasthan Royals at the Chepauk on Sunday.The win came courtesy a disciplined bowling performance led by pacer Simarjeet Singh -- who recorded his career-best figures of 3/26 at the home ground.The low-scoring affair also had its share of controversy when Ravindra Jadeja was given out obstructing the field.Despite the challenging pitch conditions, CSK successfully chased down the target of 142 with 10 balls remaining.The hero of the day for CSK was also their captain, Ruturaj Gaikwad , who remained unbeaten on 42 off 41 deliveries, guiding his team to a crucial victory in pursuit of a playoff berth.Rachin Ravindra (27 off 18 balls) and Gaikwad managed a 32-run stand before the former was dismissed by Ravichandran Ashwin in the fourth over.However, that did not have any impact on Gaikwad and Daryl Mitchell (22 off 13 balls) as they maintained a run rate of over nine and ended the powerplay at 56 for one.Pacer Sandeep Sharma was the most expensive bowler for the visitors during this phase and was hammered for 23 runs.Mitchell appeared to be the man on a mission, but his stay was cut short by spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, who trapped him leg-before wicket in the eighth over to end a 35-run partnership with Gaikwad.Moeen Ali (10 off 13 balls) came in next, but he holed out to Nandre Burger in the 12th over.With the score reading 92 for three in the 13th over, Shivam Dube decided to have a go at Ashwin in his final over.While Dube hammered Ashwin for a six and two fours in the over, the veteran had the last laugh, which also turned out to be his 50th IPL wicket at this venue.Also, Jadeja (5 off 6 balls) survived a scare in the subsequent over after Jos Buttler dropped him off Chahal at long-on.Rookie Sameer Rizvi then hit an eight-ball 15 not out with three fours to end the game in a jiffy after Jadeja became the third batter in IPL history to be adjudged out for obstructing the field after miscommunication with Gaikwad, who refused to go for a second run even as the all-rounder was halfway down the pitch.The third man hurled it to Sanju Samson, who aimed the ball at the bowler's end but the throw hit Jadeja. RR appealed, and the third umpire was convinced that Jadeja knew in which direction the ball was heading.CSK needed 21 off the final four overs, and the duo of Gaikwad and Rizvi got the job done.The win took CSK to the third spot on the points table, while RR suffered their third straight defeat but remained in second position.Earlier, Simarjeet dished out his best performance in the IPL while helping CSK restrict RR to a modest total.For the visitors, the in-form Riyan Parag top-scored with a 35-ball unbeaten 47 on a slow wicket.Opting to bat, the RR openers were off to a cautious start. After RR ended the powerplay at 42 for no loss, the 26-year-old Simarjeet made the first breakthrough in the seventh over, getting rid of Jaiswal (24 runs off 21 balls).Simarjeet came up with the second breakthrough in the ninth over, with Jos Buttler (21 off 25 balls) departing.Samson failed to get going, and it was Simarjeet again who grabbed the prized wicket of the RR skipper, ending his 42-run partnership with Parag.Deshpande, bowling the final over, got rid of Jurel and Shubham Dubey (0 off 1 ball) in consecutive deliveries. Eventually, the visitors didn't get a big enough total on the board.",Chennai Super Kings beat Rajasthan Royals by five wickets at the Chepauk.

And it should be exactly like that. Everything is fine when things are normal. Anybody can be a pilot when the sea is calm. But a person's character is tested when the going is tough.""Sidhu adds in another video, ""KKR is the only team which has bowlers who have taken 10-10 wickets and the sixth has taken 9. Show me one team who has this. The most valuable player in the tournament is Sunil Narine. Who got Starc (Mitchell)? Everybody was saying 23 crore, 23 crore. The cynic knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. It is the value addition, boss. Don't measure him in crores, just see what value addition he is bringing. Look at KKR's bowlers, top batsmen, everybody is in form. They stand like recruits, padded-up, all ready to go in anytime. They have one parallel power centre. Everybody will feel they deserve to do that. They have balance, they have a great mentor, they have a superb captain. They have everybody in form. What else do you want?

CHENNAI: A 35-run defeat against Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad on Friday night has left Chennai Super Kings in a spot of bother.A top-two spot seems off and now the entire focus will be on making the playoffs, for which CSK need to win both their matches. And with no time to recover and reflect on the performance against Titans, a tired CSK will be up against a powerful Rajasthan Royals in a day game on Sunday.It is CSK's last home game and if they do not manage to stay alive for the final two games of the season - second qualifier and final - this may well become MS Dhoni's last match at Chepauk.Royals, who will look to book a playoff berth, came to Chennai on Thursday night, had a couple of good practice sessions and are now ready to put CSK under some serious pressure. Royals might have lost a couple of games back-to-back in the lead-up to this high-voltage clash, but they have the wherewithal to match CSK in every department.Speaking after the loss against Titans, Chennai skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad said that the RR match would be a tough battle. ""It is (the next match) real quick, actually. We get a flight tomorrow (Saturday). It is going to be tough as we will just get up there. And, it will be difficult playing a day game in Chennai, especially against a really good side. But I feel that to stay in the tournament, we need to turn up really well,"" Ruturaj said on Friday.The dew has been a huge factor in the past few games at Chepauk. But on Sunday, with the match being played in the afternoon, dew won't be a factor and the spinners should enjoy the conditions. While the hosts will bank on the spin trio of Ravindra Jadeja , Mitchell Santner and Moeen Ali to make the most of the conditions, Royals are on par with them in this department.Home boy R Ashwin knows Chepauk conditions like the back of his palm and for company, he has leggie Yuzvendra Chahal, who found a place in the T20 World Cup side on the basis of his performances in the IPL CSK will also be wary of RR's formidable battling line-up that has the dependable duo of Yashasvi Jaiswal and Jos Buttler, in-form Sanju Samson and young gun Riyan Parag, who can turn the match on its head. The firepower of this line-up can be a big headache for Ruturaj, given the fact that his pace attack is still coming to terms with the departure of Matheesha Pathirana, Mustafizur Rahman and Deepak Chahar.The only bright spot for CSK in their defeat against Titans was the bowling form of Shardul Thakur, who was landing his yorkers and mixing his pace well. CSK will hope the senior bowler keeps doing the job and coupled with the comfort of home conditions and passionate fans, the team does enough to take the survival battle to the final lap.",Chennai Super Kings face Rajasthan Royals in a day game on Sunday.

The heroics of spinner Varun Chakravarthy stole the show, leaving a lasting imprint on KKR 's journey to the playoffs.Former India cricketer Virender Sehwag applauded the decision making from KKR, allowing Varun to bowl the maximum four overs [only one bowler was allowed to bowl four overs in an innings as the rain has curtailed the match to 16-overs-a-side] instead of more established international bowlers like Sunil Narine and Mitchell Starc .""They have Sunil Narine and Mitchell Starc - who play international cricket and different T20 leagues. They didn't get the four overs. Toh yeh bhi toh unhone samajhdari ki na ki meri yeh bowler achcha kar rahi hai to inhi se chaar karaung. Udhar se Mumbai bhi yeh kar sakti thi na, yeh bowler achcha kar raha hai toh isko khelke nikaale, aur dusre ko maar lenge. Toh samajhdari jaruri thi aaj ke match mein, aur kuch nahi tha, sirf samajdari se khelte aur wicket nahi jaati toh nikaal le jaate [KKR took the right decision to use four overs from Varun, who was bowling extremely well. Mumbai could have also done the same and played Varun cautiously and attacked the others. Good decision making was required in the match. If MI had played with better planning and didn't lose wickets, they could have won],"" Sehwag said in a post-match discussion on Cricbuzz.Sehwag, though, lamented the timing of Varun's stellar displays, expressing regret that they came too late for consideration in the T20 World Cup squad .""Not only in this match but in the previous matches also he was bowling brilliantly, but somehow he missed the flight to the T20 World Cup. If these performances came a bit earlier, selectors would have at least considered him for the squad. It came a bit late for him,"" Sehwag said.Manoj Tiwary , another former India cricketer, agreed with Sehwag and heaped praise on Varun.""Brilliant bowling. It was a dream spell which every bowler wishes to bowl once in every 2-3 games,"" remarked Manoj Tiwary, encapsulating the essence of Chakravarthy's performance. His figures of 2-17 throttled Mumbai's chase.""The speed he was bowling, his mystery ball which leg-spin was turning more and his googly was also coming good,"" noted Tiwary, underlining the difficulty batters faced.Reflecting on the dynamics of KKR's bowling unit, Sehwag drew parallels between Chakravarthy and Sunil Narine's partnership, likening it to the famed 'KulCha' duo. ""They are hunting in pairs like 'KulCha' used to do when bowling in tandem,"" he mused, emphasizing the pressure generated by their combined prowess.With Chakravarthy's wizardry complemented by Venkatesh Iyer's explosive batting and Harshit Rana's crucial contributions, KKR stamped their authority as they became the first team to secure a spot in the IPL playoffs",Kolkata Knight Riders secure spot in IPL playoffs with win over Mumbai Indians.

But Narine had the last laugh and dismissed the destructive Kishan.Narine deceived Kishan with a seam-up delivery as the left hander holed out to midwicket for KKR's first breakthrough.Chakravarthy ended Rohit's forgettable stint at the crease in the next over and finished his four-over spell by dismissing MI skipper Hardik Pandya .Coming in as an impact player, Indian skipper Rohit Sharma 's patchy run of form continued as he looked out of sorts.Rohit was going run-a-ball in his scratchy knock, but that was not a problem for MI as Kishan took the attack to the KKR camp with his flat-batted approach.The left-hander smashed Harshit Rana for two fours and one six, and then took on Narine with successive fours and a six.MI were well on course with 59 for no loss in five overs with a required run-rate of exactly nine runs per over at that stage. But then, KKR's spin duo plotted MI's downfall.Earlier, on a tacky wicket that remained under covers for three days owing to persistent rain in the city, KKR lost their openers -- Phil Salt (6) and Sunil Narine (0) -- in seven balls.Battling a strained hamstring, Iyer lifted KKR after their worst start of the season with his counter-attacking knock after MI won a good toss following a late start because of rain.The highlight of the left-hander's innings was the way he hit Jasprit Bumrah for a six and two fours.Having missed their last 10 matches because of a finger injury, Nitish Rana made a 23-ball 33 during a key partnership with Iyer before getting run out.But Mumbai bounced back well with leg-spinner Piyush Chawla returning figures of 2/38 from his three overs, taking the two key wickets of Iyer and Andre Russell (24 off 14 balls; 2x4, 2x6).Bumrah (2/39 from four overs) ended his splendid spell by dismissing Rinku Singh for a 12-ball 20.(With inouts from PTI)",Kolkata Knight Riders beat Mumbai Indians by 18 runs in IPL match.

The former India opener expressed his doubts about the likelihood of Rohit being retained by the franchise.During a discussion with Cricbuzz on Saturday, Sehwag suggested that apart from Jasprit Bumrah and Suryakumar Yadav, no player in the MI dressing room could assure themselves of retention ahead of the mega auction next season.This observation also raises questions about Hardik Pandya 's position on the team.""If you get Shahrukh Khan, Aamir Khan and Salman Khan for one movie, it doesn't mean it will be a hit film. You have to perform. There has to be something in the script. Look at these big names...they all have to perform. Rohit scored one hundred and it was in a losing cause. In the remaining matches, when did he perform? Ishan Kishan has not gone beyond the powerplay the entire season. So the only two players who are certain are Bumrah and Suryakumar. If they have a third and a fourth, we'll see,"" he said.Rohit's performance in this IPL season wasn't great, as he only managed 330 runs in 12 matches, with one century. However, a video circulating on social media shows Rohit expressing his deep affection for the franchise, likening it to a second home for him while talking to KKR assistant coach Abhishek Nayar.Though the noise in the video is not clear due to constant cheering by fans for Rohit in the background, he can be heard saying, ""Ek ek cheez change ho raha hai...Woh unke upar hai...Jo bhi hai woh mera ghar hai bhai, woh temple jo hai na maine banwaya hai."" The last audible line in the chat is ""Bhai mera kya mera to ye last hai"".Though the rest of the conversation is not audible, fans were quick to react to it and speculated that Rohit was talking about the MI captaincy and some fans even alleged that KKR had deleted the video after uploading it on X.Rohit and Nayar go back a long way from their Mumbai domestic cricket days and are good friends.

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals captain Sanju Samson acknowledged that his team fell short of their expected score by 20-24 runs against Chennai Super Kings in Match 61 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024.He mentioned that the Chennai pitch had lower bounce than anticipated, making it challenging for his team to adjust to the conditions. Despite their best efforts, Rajasthan Royals couldn't quite capitalize on the batting front.Chennai Super Kings, on the other hand, demonstrated a better understanding of the conditions, particularly at home.After restricting Rajasthan Royals to 141/5 in their 20 overs with a superb bowling performance, CSK put on a clinical display with the bat.Led by captain Ruturaj Gaikwad 's unbeaten 42-run knock, CSK chased down the target comfortably, showcasing solid batting performances from Rachin Ravindra, Daryl Mitchell, and Shivam Dube . Gaikwad played the role of the anchor, while the explosive batting from his teammates ensured a smooth victory for CSK.CSK's victory was also buoyed by fine bowling efforts from pacers Simarjeet Singh and Tushar Deshpande , who applied continuous pressure on the Rajasthan Royals' batting lineup throughout the game.With this important win, Chennai Super Kings moved closer to securing a spot in the playoffs with just one game remaining in the league stage. Their all-round performance, combining effective bowling and composed batting, showcased their potential as strong contenders in theIPL 2024 tournament.Sanju Samson agreed that they failed to get to the score they had in mind after the first few overs.""I think after the Power-play, the message was the wicket was slow and two-paced. The bounce was also not as much as we expected. When I was batting in the middle, the score I was expecting was around 170. We were 20-25 runs short. We tried our best, they knew the conditions and they bowled smartly,"" said Samson at the post-match presentation ceremony on Sunday.He admitted that Chennai Super Kings bowler Simarjeet Singh bowled well. ""Simarjeet bowled well today. We are not very sure what to expect in away games. Looking at the venue, we thought batting first might be better. I think when you have a score to chase, on these wickets, they had a better idea and a better hand in this,"" he said.Samson, who set the record for leading Rajasthan Royals in the greatest number of matches by leading them out in the 57th match and getting past Shane Warne, said the wicket did not slow down as much as they had expected in the second innings.""We expected it to be slower in the second innings, but it was a touch better. When you play here in night games, it is a no-brainer (to chase) with all the dew coming in. The summer is getting hotter in India and as the wicket heats up, I was expecting it to slow down. They also batted really well. The way the game went to the 18th over, the wicket was tough to bat on,"" he added.Samson said the race for qualifying spots in the playoffs was top-most of their minds. ""Very normal to keep thinking about the qualification at this stage. The conversations we are having is to control what we can do. At the team brief, I will probably ask them to continue the process and hope to get on the better side next game,"" he said.Rajasthan Royals are currently on 16 points in the points table with eight wins from 12 matches. They have suffered losses in three successive matches and now have two more games to play.Rajasthan Royals will take on Punjab Kings at the Barsapara Cricket Stadium, Guwahati on Wednesday followed by a clash with Kolkata Knight Riders at the same venue on May 19.

He did try to turn around, so he changed his angle a little bit. But he didn't change his angle while running straight,"" Hussey told reporters during the post-match interaction.""I can see both sides of the story. I can understand the umpire making the decision. The rule says you cannot change your line, so maybe, it was a fair call.""CSK won the match by five wickets to keep their playoff hopes alive.",Michael Hussey says Ravindra Jadeja's dismissal could have gone either way.

However, their victory at Old Trafford was far from convincing, as they battled stifling heat and a determined United side.United's injury woes and defensive vulnerabilities were exposed once again, with Casemiro's error leading to Trossard's decisive goal. The absence of key players like Bruno Fernandes only added to their struggles.Despite a spirited second-half display from United, Arsenal held firm defensively, securing their sixth clean sheet in their last seven away league games.

NEW DELHI: Manchester United clinched their first Women's FA Cup title with a commanding 4-0 triumph over Tottenham Hotspur in the final on Sunday. Under the guidance of manager Marc Skinner , the team avenged their defeat in last year's final to Chelsea by putting on a dominant display.The match saw United assert their authority, with midfielder Ella Toone breaking the deadlock on the stroke of halftime with a spectacular strike.After the break, Rachel Williams extended their lead with a well-timed header, followed by two goals from Spanish forward Lucia Garcia , sealing a comprehensive victory.This triumph marks a significant milestone for Manchester United's women's team, who have steadily progressed since their reformation in 2018. Winning their first major trophy will undoubtedly serve as a source of pride and motivation for the players and staff alike as they continue to make strides in women's football.""Wembley is always special. Last year we spoke as a group and said 'one day that will be ours' and today's the day so I'm buzzing,"" said goalkeeper Mary Earps.The atmosphere at Wembley Stadium was electric on a sunny day, with a staggering 76,082 fans in attendance, including Manchester United's co-owner Avram Glazer and Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy. Despite the anticipation, the first half of the match produced few noteworthy chances, with the breakthrough coming in the second minute of stoppage time.It was England's Ella Toone who seized the moment, driving the ball forward and unleashing a powerful strike from outside the area that found the top corner of the net. This stunning goal gave Manchester United a crucial lead heading into halftime.Tottenham, appearing in their first-ever FA Cup final, struggled to pose any attacking threat throughout the match, failing to register a single shot on target. Their hopes were further dashed after the break as United's Rachel Williams, a former Spurs player who had previously won the FA Cup with Birmingham City, rose high to head in a free kick, extending United's lead.Spanish forward Lucia Garcia capitalized on a mistake from Tottenham goalkeeper Becky Spencer, intercepting a poor pass and slotting the ball into the net to make it 3-0 in the 57th minute. Garcia then secured her brace, and United's victory, with another goal in the 74th minute, this time via a deflection.This triumph comes as a bright spot in Manchester United's challenging season, where they have struggled in the league standings, currently sitting fifth. Winning the Women's FA Cup represents a significant achievement for the club and underscores their progress since reforming the women's team in 2018.""We don't like to admit it but it does mask over the issues we've had,"" goalscorer Williams, 36, told the BBC. ""We have had some ups and downs this year. That's for Marc (Skinner) and the backroom staff to be like 'right, this is what we have to do in the summer'.""We are going to have change things next year. We have had some injuries, three or four ACLs, at the start of the season.""That's football, teams go through transition. You have a good year, you have a dip.

NEW DELHI: Lionel Messi played the full 90 minutes in Inter Miami's 3-2 victory over Montreal on Saturday night, despite a brief injury scare in the first half. Benjamin Cremaschi scored the decisive goal in the 59th minute, helping Inter Miami secure their fifth straight Major League Soccer win after overcoming a two-goal deficit.Luis Suarez and Matías Rojas also found the back of the net for Inter Miami, while Jules-Anthony Vilsaint and Bryce Duke scored for Montreal (3-5-3).Inter Miami (8-2-3) stretched their unbeaten run to seven matches (5-0-2), even though Messi failed to score or assist for the first time in his nine MLS appearances this season. The team has a 7-0-2 record in those nine games, with one of their losses coming against Montreal in March when Messi was not playing.Messi experienced a concerning moment towards the end of the first half when he was fouled by George Campbell . The impact of the challenge caused Messi to fall to the ground, visibly in pain and clutching his left knee.Inter Miami's medical staff attended to Messi on the field, and after about two minutes, he got up and walked to the sideline. He was not substituted, allowing him to return to the game shortly after.Remarkably, the match dynamics shifted following Messi's injury scare. Inter Miami was trailing 2-0 when Messi got hurt, but the score was 2-1 when he returned, and they equalized moments after he re-entered the field. Rojas scored from a free kick that Messi would typically take, putting Inter Miami on the scoreboard. Suarez then tapped in a goal from a corner kick late in first-half stoppage time, becoming the third player in MLS history to score 11 goals in his first 800 minutes of a season.Cremaschi's go-ahead goal came when Rojas sent a ball into open space, and the young midfielder ran it down, nudging the ball just past two defenders and into the net for a 3-2 lead. Messi had two chances to extend the lead in the final minutes but narrowly missed both.The match attracted a sellout crowd of 19,619 spectators, with Montreal selling out its 15,000 season tickets for the first time since joining MLS in 2012, largely due to Messi's arrival in the league last summer.

Kylian Mbappe announces his departure from Paris Saint-Germain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/kylian-mbappe-announces-his-departure-from-paris-saint-germain/articleshow/110026031.cms,"(Inputs from AFP)

NEW DELHI: Kylian Mbappe confirmed on Friday his decision to depart from Paris Saint-Germain ( PSG ) at the conclusion of the current season. The French champions, who signed Mbappe from Monaco in 2017 for a staggering 180 million euros ($194 million), are expected to bid farewell to their star player as he likely moves to Real Madrid .""I wanted to announce to you all that it's my last year at Paris Saint-Germain.I will not extend and the adventure will come to an end in a few weeks,"" Mbappe, 25, said in a video posted on social media. ""I will play my last game at the Parc des Princes on Sunday.""PSG, owned by Qatar, have already clinched their 10th Ligue 1 title in the past 12 seasons and will be presented with the trophy following Sunday's match against Toulouse, their final home game of the campaign. However, the team's Champions League aspirations were dashed by Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals, with a 1-0 home defeat sealing a surprising 2-0 aggregate loss. Consequently, Mbappe will not have the opportunity to bid farewell in the Champions League final at Wembley on June 1, and his seven-year tenure at PSG will conclude without having secured Europe's most prestigious club competition.Mbappe had privately informed PSG of his intention to leave when his contract expires at the end of the season back in February. Although he had not publicly confirmed his departure or his next destination, it is widely believed that he will join Real Madrid. Spanish media reports have suggested that Mbappe has already signed an agreement to join LaLiga champions in July once his PSG contract concludes.""It's a lot of emotions, many years where I had the chance and the great honour to be a member of the biggest French club, one of the best in the world,"" said Mbappe.""It allowed me to arrive here, to have my first experience in a club with a lot of pressure, to grow as a player of course, by being alongside some of the best in history, some of the greatest champions,"" he added. ""It's hard and I never thought it would be this difficult to announce that... but I think I needed this, a new challenge, after seven years.""Mbappe's arrival in Paris as a teenager in 2017 came after he had helped Monaco secure the league title. His transfer fee, initially on loan before becoming permanent, remains the second-largest in football history, coming just weeks after PSG paid a world-record 222 million euros to acquire Neymar from Barcelona.Despite the Qatari takeover in 2011 and the subsequent dominance of French football, PSG have struggled to achieve European success, even with the addition of Lionel Messi to their lineup for two seasons. The closest they came was the 2020 Champions League final defeat by Bayern Munich, where PSG academy graduate Kingsley Coman scored the winning goal against his former club.Mbappe, who has scored 43 goals in all competitions this season, including 26 in Ligue 1, will aim to add to his club-record tally of 255 goals for PSG and secure another medal in the French Cup final on May 25. During his seven years at his hometown team, Mbappe has won six Ligue 1 titles, three French Cups, and the now-defunct League Cup twice.Following Sunday's game, PSG will conclude their league campaign with away matches at Nice and relegation-threatened Metz before Mbappe's final appearance for the club in the Cup final in Lille.Mbappe's relationship with PSG boss Luis Enrique has come under scrutiny since he informed the club of his plans to leave earlier this year. The club had initially frozen him out at the start of the campaign, pressuring him to either sign a new deal or agree to be sold rather than simply running down the final year of his contract.",Kylian Mbappe confirms he will leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the season.
