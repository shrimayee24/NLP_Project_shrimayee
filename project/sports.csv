In January 2022, Virat Kohli surprised his fans by stepping down as India's Test captain , and the team's former batting coach Sanjay Bangar believes that he should have continued to lead India in red-ball cricket at that time.Speaking on 'The Rao Podcast', Bangar said: ""I personally feel that he (Kohli) should have continued slightly for longer as a Test captain.He probably captained India in 65 Test matches, and one of things I feel is that he could have probably continued as a Test captain for a longer period.""Kohli achieved unparalleled success as the captain of the Indian Test team. He took charge from MS Dhoni and led the team in 68 matches, securing an impressive 40 victories with a win percentage of 58.82.Kohli's first series win as captain came against Sri Lanka in 2015, marking India's first victory in the island nation in 22 years.Kohli's leadership has been instrumental in Team India's historic achievements, including their maiden Test series triumph in Australia in 2018, victories in the West Indies, claiming the top spot in the Test rankings, and reaching the inaugural ICC World Test Championship Final in 2021.Kohli boasts an exceptional home record as captain, having won 24 out of the 31 Tests played in India, with only two losses.After Kohli's decision to retire, Rohit was named India's skipper in all formats.Both Kohli and Rohit decided to quit T20Is after the T20 World Cup triumph earlier this year. Since then, Suryakumar Yadav has been leading in T20Is while Rohit continues to lead the team in ODIs and Test cricket.","Virat Kohli retired as India's Test captain in January 2022.

NEW DELHI: While the prospect of an India vs Pakistan World Test Championship (WTC) final remains theoretically possible, recent results have made it a near-impossible scenario. Pakistan's historic defeat to Bangladesh in Rawalpindi has further diminished their already slim chances of reaching the WTC final . With India among the favorites to make it to the final again, a match-up between the two rivals would have been a blockbuster.However, Pakistan's road to the final now looks more challenging than ever.Pakistan currently sit in the eighth position on the WTC points table, with just two wins in six matches and a winning percentage of 30.56. This significant decline in form, especially in red-ball cricket, has left them with a steep mountain to climb if they hope to reach the WTC final.Pakistan still have eight Tests remaining in the current WTC cycle. To have a strong chance of making the final, they would need to win all of these matches. This task will be challenging, as they face tough opponents, including England, West Indies, and South Africa, with the series against the Proteas being played away from home.Meanwhile, India and Australia remain the favorites to face each other again in the WTC final next year. Both teams are at the top of the standings with a considerable lead. India lead with six wins in nine matches and a winning percentage of 68.52, while defending champions Australia are just behind with eight wins in 12 matches and a percentage of 62.50. The upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy later this year will be crucial for both teams as they aim to secure their places in the final.Bangladesh's recent victory over Pakistan has moved them up to sixth place in the points table, with two wins in five matches and a winning percentage of 40.00. This victory marks a significant improvement for Bangladesh in Test cricket .In another notable match, England defeated Sri Lanka by five wickets in the first Test, climbing from seventh to fourth in the WTC points table. This result caused Sri Lanka to slip to the fifth position.While an India vs Pakistan final remains a tantalizing prospect, Pakistan's path to the WTC final now appears increasingly improbable given their current position and recent performances.",Pakistan currently sit in the eighth position on the WTC points table.

Both Vengsarkar and Patil made strong, and sometimes unpopular, decisions during their tenure as chief national selectors, but are still appreciated for identifying young talent and picking players at the opportune moment.In early March 2013, it was at Patil's insistence that Dhawan was picked for India's squad for the third Test against the visiting Australians in Mohali.Replacing the great Virender Sehwag , who was then going through a lean patch, Dhawan immediately made his mark by smashing a magnificent 187 off just 174 balls, including an 85-ball century - the fastest by any batter on Test debut.""You should support a young cricketer who's in form. Getting the right opportunity at the right time is extremely important. At that point, Shikhar had just returned from India A's South African tour after scoring a double century and a century there. Unfortunately, we had to make a tough call. All my four co-selectors opposed my decision (to select Dhawan over Sehwag), but ultimately, something good happened. He scored a hundred on his Test debut. It proved that my idea of picking him was right. I don't want to take credit for this. I give credit to Shikhar because he proved my decision right. He saved me!"" Patil told TOI on Sunday.Years before this, Dhawan shot into the limelight during the 2004 Under-19 World Cup in Dhaka, where he emerged as the tournament's highest run-getter. The left-hander set the event on fire, amassing 505 runs in seven innings at an average of 84.16.Few know that it was Vengsarkar who played a crucial role in Dhawan's selection for that tournament after he had initially been dropped by the then India Under-19 selectors due to poor performance in a couple of trial matches in Mumbai.Recalling that episode, Vengsarkar told TOI: ""In 2004, I was the chairman of the BCCI's TRDW (Talent Research Development Wing), and Jagmohan Dalmiya (then BCCI president) asked me to attend all the selection committee meetings of the India Under-19 team as well.""Before the squad was announced, the BCCI had organized two one-day selection trial matches at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, which I couldn't attend due to a prior commitment. When the squad was announced, I noticed Shikhar's name was missing. I had been watching him since his Under-16 days. When I asked the selectors why he was dropped, I was told that he didn't score in those two matches. Pushing for his selection, I told them, 'So what if he failed in these two matches? He's a good player, just pick him.' To their credit, the selectors respected my opinion, and Dhawan was picked. He ended up being the highest run-getter of the tournament.""","Former India selectors Dilip Vengsarkar and Sandeep Patil played a key role in Shikhar Dhawan's success.

NEW DELHI: In a stinging rebuke of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), cricketer Ahmed Shehzad has criticized the board's strategy and selection policies following Pakistan's historic 10-wicket loss to Bangladesh in the Rawalpindi Test on Sunday. This defeat marks Bangladesh's first-ever Test win over Pakistan, achieved on the latter's home soil.After being bowled out for just 146 runs in their second innings, Pakistan set Bangladesh a modest target of 30 runs, which the visitors chased down effortlessly.Expressing his frustration in a video posted on X, Shehzad described the defeat as a ""new low"" for Pakistan cricket.""Pakistan ki cricket ka haal yeh ho gaya hai ki aaj Bangladesh ne Pakistan ke home soil pe pehli dafa zindagi me Pakistan ko hara diya. Maine apni zindagi me Pakistan cricket ko itna low jaate huye kabhi nahi dekha. Kabhi zindagi me nahi dekha. Batting, bowling, fielding, achcha, bura ye toh baad ki baat he. Lekin yeh ek naya low hit kiya he Pakistan ne, jo ki maine apni Zindagi me kabhi nahi dekha [Pakistan cricket has reached a point where today Bangladesh defeated Pakistan on home soil for the first time ever. I have never seen Pakistan cricket sink so low in my life. This is a new low that Pakistan has hit, which I have never seen in my life],"" Shehzad said.Shehzad also suggested that Pakistan will struggle to recover from this loss, much like they have struggled since their defeat to Afghanistan in the 2023 ODI World Cup. He criticized the PCB for making short-term decisions that have led the team towards a decline reminiscent of the fall of Pakistani hockey.""Aur Pakistan iss defeat se bahut mushkil se nikal payega, jaise Afghanistan ki defeat se aaj tak nahi nikal paa raha hai. Issi tarah Pakistan is defeat se bahut mushkil se nikal payega. Humne pehle bhi bola tha. Agar aapne short term decision liye hai toh Pakistan ki team already he na zero ki taraf he, hockey wala haal ho raha hai. Lekin humne yeh nahi expect kiya tha ki aap Bangladesh se bhi har jayenge. Aaj aapne woh bhi kar dikhaya,"" he stated.Despite the poor performance, Shehzad did not place blame on the players but instead targeted the PCB for its lack of vision and poor selection policies.""Isme players ki koi galti main nahi manta. Mujhe nahi lagta isme players ki galti hai. Galti Pakistan Cricket Board ki hai. Kyunki players kabhi bhi aapko zabardasti nahi keh rahe he ki humein aap team me daale. Aap log he jo unko lagataar khilaye jaa rahe he. Aap log he jo domestic ke players ko aane nahi de rahe. Aap hi log he jo khud hi yeh bata rahe hai ki humare paas domestic me he hi kuch nahi. Toh aapke paas domestic mein iss tarah ke players nahi he jo in logon ko replace kar sakenge, toh aapne banaya kya hai abhi tak,"" he argued.Before this clash, Pakistan and Bangladesh had met in 13 Test matches, with Pakistan winning 12 and one ending in a draw. The Rawalpindi loss has prompted calls for introspection and changes within the PCB, as the cricketing community grapples with the implications of this historic defeat.","Ahmed Shehzad criticizes Pakistan Cricket Board's strategy and selection policies.

Bangladesh ease to first-ever Test victory over Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/history-created-bangladesh-ease-to-first-ever-test-victory-over-pakistan/articleshow/112780538.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bangladesh achieved a momentous victory in the first Test against Pakistan, securing a 10-wicket triumph on the final day. The win came despite political turmoil in their home country.Pakistan's batting lineup crumbled, managing only 146 runs before being dismissed. The Bangladeshi pace attack effectively dismantled Pakistan's top order, setting the stage for the spinners to dominate, AP reported.Mehidy Hasan Miraz, an off-spinner, and Shakib Al Hasan, a left-arm spinner who previously served as a lawmaker under the government of ex-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, combined to take seven wickets.This remarkable performance marked Bangladesh's first-ever Test win against Pakistan in 14 encounters, making it a historic moment for the team.As the tea interval approached, Bangladesh's opening batsmen Zakir Hasan and Shadman Islam remained undefeated, scoring 15 and 9 runs respectively. The team reached a total of 30 runs without losing a wicket, securing only their seventh victory in an away Test match and their first since triumphing over New Zealand at Mount Maunganui in January 2022.Despite declaring at 448-6, Pakistan found themselves trailing by 117 runs in the first innings. The team resumed play at 23-1, still 94 runs behind, but was ultimately dismissed by a well-disciplined combination of pace and spin bowling from the Bangladeshi side.Mohammad Rizwan, who scored an unbeaten career-best 171 in the first innings, once again top-scored with 51 runs. However, many of his teammates fell victim to impulsive shots, which were exacerbated by the aggressive field placements employed by Bangladesh's captain, Najmul Hossain Shanto.Miraz and Shakib were the standout performers with the ball, taking seven wickets between them. Mehidy finished with impressive figures of 4-21, while Shakib claimed 3-44. The pace trio of Shoriful Islam, Hasan Mahmud, and Nahid Rana chipped in with a wicket apiece, contributing to Pakistan's downfall.The morning session proved to be a turning point in the match, as Bangladesh tightened their grip on the game.Pakistan struggled to cope with the pressure, losing five crucial wickets and limping to a score of 108-6. The tone was set early when Hasan Mahmud found the edge of captain Shan Masood's bat, dismissing him for 14 in the second over of the day, with the wicketkeeper completing the catch.Masood clashed with on-field umpire Richard Kettleborough for the second time in the match, following a controversial caught-behind decision in the first innings. Television replays, however, showed that the left-hander had indeed edged the ball after Bangladesh's successful referral.Hasan nearly dismissed Babar Azam for a second duck in the game, but wicketkeeper Litton Das dropped a straightforward catch on the first ball Babar faced. Babar then looked to counterattack, hitting three boundaries before fast bowler Rana (1-30) claimed his wicket when he reached 22.Pakistan's middle-order batters faltered, recklessly losing their wickets to spinners Shakib and Mehidy.First-innings centurion Saud Shakeel, attempting an unnecessary extravagant shot against Shakib, was stumped for a duck - the first time in his brief Test career.Abdullah Shafique also lost patience, playing an overly ambitious shot off Shakib, which resulted in a top-edge catch at point. Mehidy soon followed by finding the outside edge of Salman Ali Agha's bat in his second over.Bangladesh maintained the pressure on Pakistan after the break, with Mehidy taking three wickets post-lunch. Rizwan, just after completing his half-century, under-edged a sweep off the offspinner back onto his stumps, and No. 11 Mohammad Ali was trapped leg before wicket.The defeat extended Pakistan's winless streak in home red-ball cricket to five losses and four draws since their last victory against South Africa at Rawalpindi in 2021.The second Test will also be played in Rawalpindi, starting next Friday, after being relocated from Karachi due to ongoing construction at the National Bank Stadium.","Bangladesh beat Pakistan by 10 wickets in the first Test match in New Delhi.

Wood becomes more important player than Stokes on flat pitches: Vaughan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/wood-becomes-more-important-player-than-stokes-on-flat-pitches-vaughan/articleshow/112784067.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former England captain Michael Vaughan emphasized the significance of Mark Wood 's role in the team, particularly on pitches that offer little assistance to bowlers. Vaughan asserted that in such conditions, Wood's presence becomes even more vital than that of Ben Stokes .The ex-skipper expressed his concern over Wood's unavailability for the remaining two Tests against Sri Lanka, considering it a significant setback for the English side.Wood sustained an injury to his right thigh muscle during the first match of the series at Old Trafford, which England eventually won by five wickets on Saturday.The pacer had to leave the field after delivering just two balls in his 11th over during Sri Lanka's second innings on the third day and was unable to bowl on the fourth day.""When you get on a flat pitch, Mark Wood is the most important player for England's Test match team. Yes, even more than Ben Stokes. Wood is that good – and his injury that rules him out of the rest of the series against Sri Lanka is a blow.""""Stokes is a colossus. Talismanic, an incredible leader, a brilliant player. But I just can't see how England can replace Wood. He's just got something very special about him,"" wrote Vaughan in his column for The Telegraph, as quoted by IANS.He also pointed to Sri Lanka's second innings on day four as an example of England feeling the absence of Wood. Without Wood available to bowl, Sri Lanka's Kamindu Mendis and Dinesh Chandimal batted through the morning session, setting a target of 205 for England, which they successfully chased down with five wickets in hand.""How much England miss him was evident on the fourth morning with that fantastic partnership from Dinesh Chandimal and Kamindu Mendis when the pitch got flat and it became much easier for batting. We might get a lot of those conditions in the next year or so – definitely in Pakistan, and maybe a bit in New Zealand too. England need to find a way to take 20 wickets on wickets like that.""Vaughan went on to explain what sets Wood apart from other England fast bowlers. ""The point of difference that Wood brings is so important. England have got to wrap him in cotton wool to try and get him available for 60 or 70 per cent of Tests in the next year. Realistically, having Wood available that much would be a great outcome for England. A bowler like him is never going to be able to play every single game.""""Wood is now the most important cog in this England Test match wheel for them to go and beat India, for them to go and win in Australia. He's the player that opponents would most like to see not in the England side.""""Even Jofra Archer, who is fantastic, doesn't bowl 95mph. This is a guy that is doing something that we've never seen in English cricket. There's not many around the world that bowled at Wood's pace with that amount of ferocity. Every time he's come on to bowl this summer, he's made something happen.""""He is not only obviously brilliant for the team, he's brilliant for the game. We used to talk about Ian Botham, Andrew Flintoff and Stokes, how they'd get spectators out the bar to go and watch. Well, get out of the bar and make sure you're there watching Mark Wood. He is that bowler. A bowler like that doesn't just give a team a great point of difference. It also sends a shudder to the opponents' dressing room,"" he concluded.","Former England captain Michael Vaughan stresses significance of Mark Wood's role in the team.

NEW DELHI: Former cricketer Basit Ali on Sunday came down heavily on Pakistan's star batter Babar Azam following his poor performances against Bangladesh in the Test series opener.Babar, who has often been hailed as one of the top batsmen in the world, failed to impress, scoring a duck in the first innings and a slow 22 off 50 balls in the second in Rawalpindi.In a scathing critique on his YouTube channel, Basit expressed his disappointment: ""I'm feeling very disappointed that it seems as if you’ve forgotten how to bat, or have the Bangladesh bowlers cast some magic on you, or is it the pitch that’s done the trick?

Athletic goalkeeper Alex Padilla made a brilliant save to deny the Polish striker from another Raphinha cross.Barcelona's pressure finally paid off when Lewandowski fired home his third goal of the season in the 75th minute, following a cross from Pedri that Padilla could only palm into the striker's path.The victory against Ernesto Valverde's Copa del Rey winners is another confidence booster for Barcelona after their opening day win at Valencia.Despite injury issues and the absence of key players like Frenkie de Jong, Gavi, and Ronald Araujo, Flick's team has made a perfect start in their quest to reclaim the title from defending champions Real Madrid, who are expected to mount a strong challenge after signing Kylian Mbappe .",Barcelona beat Athletic Bilbao 2-1 in La Liga on Saturday.

At Wimbledon, she was eliminated in the fourth round by fellow American Emma Navarro.Subsequently, she suffered a third-round defeat to eventual silver medalist Donna Vekic of Croatia at the Olympics.The young star's struggles continued in the following tournaments.In Toronto, Gauff was overwhelmed by Russia's Diana Shnaider in the third round. Her next appearance at the Cincinnati Open, where she was the defending champion, ended abruptly in the second round (her opening match) against Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva, a match in which Gauff committed nine double faults.As the third seed at the U.S. Open, Gauff's recent performances have not provided the ideal lead-up to a Grand Slam event.

Novak Djokovic 'feels the drive' heading into US Open title defense,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/us-open/novak-djokovic-feels-the-drive-heading-into-us-open-title-defense/articleshow/112784640.cms,"NEW DELHI: Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic , currently aiming to become the first man in 16 years to successfully defend his US Open title, is setting his sights on breaking multiple records at the tournament.Djokovic, the second seed and fresh off an Olympic victory in Paris, faces Moldovan qualifier Radu Albot as he begins his campaign on Monday night.Djokovic, at 37, seeks to join the ranks of Jimmy Connors, Pete Sampras, and Roger Federer as one of the oldest winners of the championship in the Open era.Additionally, a victory would give him his 25th Grand Slam title, allowing him to hold the record for the most grand slam victories outright, a title currently shared with Australian legend Margaret Court. Successfully defending his title would make him the first man since Federer, who won five consecutive US Opens from 2004 to 2008.""I didn't know about that,"" Djokovic said. ""I knew it was probably the case for five, 10 years, but I didn't know it was that long.""Hopefully that changes this year. That's the goal.""A win at Flushing Meadows would also extend Djokovic's streak of years with at least one Grand Slam title to seven. Remarkably, from 2011 to 2023, he only failed to win a major in one year, 2017.In 2024, however, the Grand Slam titles have mostly gone to the younger generation. Carlos Alcaraz from Spain is aiming for his third straight Grand Slam, having won Roland Garros and Wimbledon. Italian Jannik Sinner clinched the Australian Open title and surpassed Djokovic in the world rankings.With Roger Federer retired and Rafael Nadal dealing with injuries, Djokovic acknowledged that his emerging rivalries with players like Alcaraz and Sinner keep him motivated.""These kind of rivalries that I have with Jannik and Carlos are the kind of matchups that still bring that joy of competition to me and inspire me to really push myself to perfect the game,"" Djokovic said.""People ask me 'now that you have basically won everything with the golden medal, what else is there to win?'""I still feel the drive. I still have the competitive spirit. I still want to make more history and enjoy myself on the tour.""Djokovic called the medal ceremony after his Paris Games triumph ""probably the most intense emotions I have ever had on a tennis court"".""I think the moment of when I achieved it, how I achieved it, after years of trying, the journey... makes it even more unique.""However, he doesn't envision any let-down as he tries to close out the season with yet another Grand Slam title.""Grand Slams are the pillars of our sport,"" Djokovic said. ""They are the most important historical tennis events that we have.""So if you don't get pumped and inspired to play your best tennis at Grand Slams, it's hard to do that anywhere else.""",Novak Djokovic is aiming to become the first man in 16 years to successfully defend his US Open title.
