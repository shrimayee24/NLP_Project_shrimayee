Dwyane Wade on Telling Gabrielle Union He Was Having A Kid With Another Woman | CLUB SHAY SHAY

Dwyane Wade, the NBA legend, recently went through a tough battle against cancer, and his wife, famous actress, Gabrielle Union , stayed by his side all through it.

She kept showing up.”But all worked out well for Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union as the two ended up getting engaged in December 2013, one month after his son with Aja Metoyer, Xavier, was born in November 2013.However, it seems like the couple faced some problems in their marriage. Dwyane Wade spoke about his marriage to Gabrielle Union and said, “It hasn’t been perfect, it will never be perfect but that was nine years ago.”He added, “We go to therapy, we’ve had shouts about it, we’ve had regular conversations about, and so it’s been something that going to be something that I have to work at and work on.”When Dwyane Wade spoke about this in 2023, he had not gone through one of the most painful experiences of his life - his cancer diagnosis . It was in December 2023 when he was first tested and later underwent a major kidney surgery.His wife, Gabrielle Union, became a huge source of strength during his battle with cancer and the couple has continued to be very much in love with each other even today.

The contest remains even, with both players exchanging blows in different seasons, making it one of IPL’s most compelling duels.Kohli, in his 18th consecutive season for RCB, has started IPL 2025 strong, scoring 97 runs in three matches at a strike rate of over 134.

NEW DELHI: Former cricketer Basit Ali has called for the resignation of Pakistan's selection committee in the wake of the national team's disappointing performance, culminating in a 3-0 clean sweep loss to New Zealand in a recent One Day International (ODI) series.This call for change comes amid a period of underwhelming performances by the Pakistani cricket team, notably since their exit from the Champions Trophy at the group stage, an event they previously won.Also See: MI vs RCB, IPL Live Score Basit Ali, expressing his dissatisfaction with the selection committee's decisions, suggested that the committee, which includes Aleem Dar, Aqib Javed, Asad Shafiq, Azhar Ali, and Hassan Cheema, lacks expertise in team formation.He highlighted the committee's failure to include spinners in the Champions Trophy squad as a critical oversight.""The selection committee should resign. They don't know how to make teams. From the Champions Trophy until now, it has been a flop show. Even the tomato seller was asking why you didn't include spinners in the Champions Trophy. Aqib should step down. If you stay for four months, you will lose against Bangladesh as well,"" Basit said on his YouTube channel, as quoted by ANI.In an effort to rebuild and focus on future competitions, including the 2026 T20 World Cup and the 2027 ODI World Cup, Pakistan embarked on a tour of New Zealand, which included five Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is) and three ODIs.For the T20I series against New Zealand, Pakistan opted for a younger, less experienced squad, excluding key players such as Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan.Despite the infusion of new talent, Pakistan was defeated 4-1 by a relatively young New Zealand team led by Michael Bracewell.The subsequent ODI series, aimed at preparing for the 2027 World Cup, also ended in disappointment for Pakistan, even with the return of Azam and Rizwan to the lineup.Additionally, Basit proposed that the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) Chairman, Mohsin Naqvi, should consider organising a T10 cricket tournament.""PCB chairman should host a T10 tournament. Babar, Rizwan, Imam-ul-Haq, Salman Agha, Tayyab Tahir , and Abdullah Shafique need to learn power hitting,"" he added.",Former cricketer Basit Ali has called for the resignation of Pakistan's selection committee.

NEW DELHI: India's middle-order batter and Punjab Kings skipper Shreyas Iyer experienced an emotional moment during the first practice session of the Champions Trophy 2025, where he found himself in tears due to his inability to perform as expected.Despite coming off a successful series against England, Iyer struggled with his form in the nets, leading to a rare display of vulnerability. This incident marked a significant moment for Iyer, who admitted to rarely crying.Also See: IPL Live Score, MI vs RCB ""Last time I cried was during Champions Trophy, first practice session. Like literally crying, crying. Because I batted in the nets, and it didn't go well. I was so angry with myself that I started crying. And I was also shocked at the fact that I don't cry that easily,"" Shreyas Iyer said on Punjab Kings' show.However, his resilience and ability to quickly understand the playing conditions paid off, as he became a crucial player for India throughout the Champions Trophy. His contribution was particularly notable in the finals, where he scored 48 runs off 62 balls, helping his team in the middle overs.Under Iyer's captaincy, Punjab Kings suffered a heavy 50-run defeat at the hands of Rajasthan Royals in Mullanpur, as their IPL 2025 campaign tasted its first defeat.Chasing a daunting 206, PBKS faltered early with both openers, including captain Shreyas Iyer, dismissed inside the powerplay by a fiery Jofra Archer.Archer finished with 3/25, setting the tone for Rajasthan’s commanding bowling performance.Earlier, Yashasvi Jaiswal starred with the bat, scoring a fluent 67 off 45 balls, supported by Sanju Samson (38) and a late flourish from Riyan Parag (43 not out). Their efforts propelled RR to a formidable 205/4. Despite some resistance in the middle order, PBKS couldn’t recover from early blows and ended at 155/9.The loss raises concerns for Punjab, particularly around their top-order fragility and captain Iyer’s underwhelming form, while Rajasthan Royals regained much-needed momentum and a healthy net run rate boost with the victory.","Shreyas Iyer found himself in tears during the first practice session of the Champions Trophy 2025.

However, the fourth delivery from Dayal — a sharp inswinger — sneaked past Rohit’s bat and crashed into his leg stump.It marked his highest score of the season so far, after three disappointing outings earlier: 0 vs CSK, 8 vs GT, and 13 vs KKR.

Travis Kelce vs. Rob Gronkowski: A simple debate post turned into pure chaos, with fans flooding X with stats, jokes, and Swiftie warnings



""It's kelce. Gronk missed almost 40 games in New England.""

""Not even close. Gronk. Kelce isn’t a TE. He’s a receiver positioned in the TE slot.""

""IDC about the numbers, Travis Kelce never was and never will be a better FOOTBALL PLAYER than Rob Gronkowski. Let’s end this today lol. The film don’t lie. Kelce hands are covered in doo doo butter, all Gronk did was make men look like kids weekly.""

the

So who’s really ahead: let’s break down the numbers and see which tight end is leading the legacy game



Rob Gronkowski – The powerhouse who bullied defenses

Super Bowl wins:

Career receiving yards:

Touchdowns:

Pro Bowls:

Blocking:

Record highlights:

Holds the most combined receptions (23) and receiving yards (297) by a tight end in Super Bowl history

NFL fans are usually divided on teams, but now the trenches have shifted to the tight end position. One simple question—Travis Kelce or Rob Gronkowski? This has snowballed into a full-blown civil war. Every corner of the football internet is sounding off, and no one seems willing to back down. Whether it’s about stats, rings, blocking, or even Taylor Swift, the lines have been drawn.Forget team rivalries—this is nowvs., and it’s getting personal.It all started with a viral post that reignited the age-old question: who’s better—Rob Gronkowski or Travis Kelce? From there, the comment section became pure mayhem.People brought receipts, emotions, and even their inner Swiftie energy:""I’m surprised the Swifties weren’t barking in this comment section.""Yes, that was a real post. Yes, this is how deep the internet is in.Some fans argued Gronk was a once-in-a-generation force who bulldozed defenses and made blocking an art form. Others said Kelce’s route running, longevity, and chemistry with Mahomes make himguy of the modern era.And then came the wildcards—shoutouts to Tony Gonzalez, Jay Novacek, and even “15K yards > rings” energy. It’s safe to say the post opened Pandora’s box.With all the noise online, let’s get into the facts.4 rings (XLIX, LI, LIII, LV)9,28692 career TDs5-time selectionWidely respected as one of the best blocking tight ends everGronk was the total package—physical, explosive, and nearly impossible to cover or stop once the ball was in his hands.

Kelce is a surgical route technician whose longevity and production have set new standards for the position.Gronk's legacy is already sealed, but Kelce’s still-unfolding career is giving fans every reason to believe he could finish as the most statistically dominant tight end in NFL history.Also read - Erin Andrews and Charissa Thompson tease a wild new podcast chapter after FOX exit So who's the GOAT?

The match, originally scheduled for April 6, had to be postponed for technical reasons.KKR, however, won’t offer Pant an easy passage. The Knights are on a high after a thumping win over Sunrisers Hyderabad in their last game here. Middle-order mainstay Venkatesh Iyer not only found his touch, but also showed how to pace an innings on a wicket that isn’t tailor-made for batting.KKR assistant coach Otis Gibson said, “If we take wickets with the new ball, then we can be very dangerous in the middle overs, of course, with Varun and Sunil (Narine). And if we don’t take wickets with a new ball, then we’ve still got those guys that we can utilise in the middle-overs.”An all-round show from KKR in the last game proved that they are not dependant on just a few names to see them through. That’s an ideal situation any coach would want.With pacer Vaibhav Arora and spinner Varun Chakravarthy getting three wickets each, the KKR attack showed that the Eden track truly has something for everyone.Ajinkya Rahane, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Rinku Singh all have contributed with the bat. Once Andre Russell starts firing, the KKR package will look complete.

They had lost by 12 runs against Lucknow Super Giants as well in their last match. The only solace for MI was Bumrah, who finished with figures of 0/29 in his four-over spell. He conceded just 14 in the last two overs he bowled towards the end of the match.Earlier, thanks to contributions by Virat Kohli (67, 42b; 8x4, 2x6), skipper Rajat Patidar (64, 32b; 5x4, 4x6), Devdutt Padikkal (37, 22b; 2x4, 3x6) and Jitesh Sharma (40*, 19b 2x4, 4x6), RCB posted 221/5 on the board Kohli, who had a sedate outing in the last two matches, came out with a positive intent to get his 57th IPL half-century and set the platform for RCB to reach a mammoth total.It wasn’t the best of starts for RCB as Phil Salt was sent packing by Trent Boult (2/57) in the first over of the innings. The New Zealand quickie rattled Salt’s stumps to continue his impressive run of wickets in the opening overs and took his tally to 31 first over dismissals.But despite the ball moving a bit in the initial phase, Kohli and Padikkal put the pressure on the home side with their 52-ball 91 -run partnership for the second wicket.The duo made sure that MI bowlers were kept under the pump as RCB reached 73/1 in the Powerplay. Kohli started with a four through mid-wicket off Deepak Chahar (0/29) in the second over. Then two fours off Boult towards the end of third over followed.Then came the moment of the match in the fourth over and the first one bowled by Jasprit Bumrah . On the first ball he faced up to returning Bumrah, Kohli backed away and swathed it for a six through the mid-wicket region. That’s the pattern which followed till Kohli was at the crease.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) held on to record a narrow 12- run win over Mumbai Indians (MI) in the Indian Premier League on Monday. MI needed 41 runs in the last three overs, but both perished in the space of four balls as RCB heaved a sigh of relief and closed out the contest.

Victor Wembanyama joins Hakeem Olajuwon courtside for NCAA title game



Fans react to Victor Wembanyama and Hakeem Olajuwon’s moment



Two towering figures from different eras of the game shared the spotlight courtside at the 2025 NCAA men’s basketball national championship. Victor Wembanyama , the San Antonio Spurs phenom, and NBA legend Hakeem Olajuwon were seen sitting side-by-side at the Alamodome in San Antonio. Wembanyama, who has been sidelined due to his season-ending injury, was seen with his new hairstyle.Hakeem Olajuwon, who played college ball for the Houston Cougars and led them to back-to-back national title game appearances in 1983 and 1984, was on hand to cheer on his alma mater in their long-awaited shot at NCAA glory. Meanwhile, Victor Wembanyama, though sidelined with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder, made waves with a bold new hairstyle that drew its fair share of attention.This meeting also came at a time of contrasting chapters in each man's basketball journey. Olajuwon, a Hall of Famer who has long since retired, was once again rallying behind Houston.For Wembanyama, the night was a brief escape from a challenging season. After making a dominant impact in his rookie campaign — averaging 24.3 points, 11 rebounds, and an NBA-best 3.8 blocks per game — the French star saw his season cut short in February due to a health setback.Fans were quick to respond. As the clips of the duo made it into the social media, basketball fans rushed into share their thoughts on the moment.“Greatness right there,” one fan wrote.“The braids are sick 😤” one fan commented on Wembanyama’s new hairstyle.“I don't like his haircut” another said of his haircut.“Good to see Wemby seemingly healthy and in very good spirits.”Also Read: Magic Johnson sends heartfelt message for Billie Jean King Crystal after joining Jamie Lee Curtis for tennis legend’s latest honor Wembanyama’s presence at the title game was a reminder of his place in the NBA’s future. As the Spurs look ahead and the Cougars fight for their first-ever national title, this moment between the basketball legend and the rising star offered a rare, heartwarming glimpse at the connection between generations. So far, it is unclear when Wembanyama will make his return to the league for action.","Victor Wembanyama and Hakeem Olajuwon were seen courtside at the 2025 NCAA men’s basketball national championship.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Florida Gators secured the 2025 NCAA March Madness championship



In a game that will be remembered for its drama, grit, and late-game chaos, the Florida Gators completed an incredible comeback to defeat Houston 65-63 and claim the 2025 NCAA men’s basketball national championship at the Alamodome. The victory marks Florida’s first title since 2007 and the third in program history, cementing a season that saw the Gators overcome seemingly insurmountable odds again and again.Florida Gators trailed by as many as 14 points in the second half, but the Gators refused to fold. Senior guard Will Richard delivered when it mattered most, finishing with 18 points to lead all scorers. Florida stormed back from a 12-point deficit in the second half to edge Houston 65-63 in a nail-biting thriller, securing their third NCAA men’s basketball national championship on Monday.This was a game of fine margins. In the final minute, Houston had multiple chances to reclaim the lead. With just under 27 seconds left and Florida clinging to a 64-63 advantage, Houston’s Emanuel Sharp dribbled the ball off his leg under defensive pressure, turning the ball over at a critical moment.After Florida’s Denzel Aberdeen missed one of two free throws, Houston had the ball with a chance to tie or win. But their final possession unraveled in a scramble, with Sharp nearly double-dribbling and no clean shot ever materializing before the buzzer sounded.The heartbreak continues for the Houston Cougars , who now fall to 0-3 in national title games and have made seven Final Four appearances without winning a championship. Their first-half performance had them poised for a breakthrough. Houston locked down Gators sharpshooter Walter Clayton Jr., holding him scoreless in the first half, and looked fully in control on both ends. But Florida flipped the script in the second half, as they have all tournament long.The Gators finished the season 36-4, knocked off top-ranked Tennessee and Auburn during the regular season, captured their first SEC tournament title since 2014, and eliminated tournament favorite Auburn again to reach the championship.Also Read: Victor Wembanyama’s new hairstyle turns heads as he steals spotlight with Hakeem Olajuwon at NCAA final At just 39 years old, head coach Todd Golden made history of his own, becoming the youngest to win an NCAA title since 1983.

Currently sitting out of the India white-ball set-up, Siraj is serving a timely reminder to the national selectors with result-determining performances for Gujarat Titans (GT) in the ongoing Indian Premier League IPL season.The fast bowler on Sunday extended his purple patch, with a four-wicket haul to engineer GT’s comprehensive win over Sunrisers Hyderabad.Siraj is proving one of the biggest beneficiaries of the lifting of the saliva ban in the league, stressing that the return of the old rule has taken some burden off the bowlers.“Yes, 100%,” the paceman said on whether the old rule is helping him in the IPL, “If the ball tails a bit, there is a wicket. When saliva is not applied on the ball, it comes onto the bat easily. Even if the ball tails only a bit, there is a chance for bringing bowled and leg-before dismissals into play.”Former India pacer and current Tamil Nadu head coach L Balaji felt that saliva has more impact on the ball than sweat.“There is more sodium content in sweat and the ball gets heavy when sweat is applied on it. Saliva, on the other hand, helps in maintaining the balance of the ball better. The ball absorbs saliva well. By applying saliva, Siraj could be getting a better grip on the ball and purchase off it,” Balaji, former bowling coach of Chennai Super Kings, told TOI on Monday.The application of saliva helps in maintaining a shinier side on the ball and brings reverse swing into the equation. Siraj on Sunday displayed the benefits fast bowlers could reap, dishing out in-swingers which led to a double haul in the penultimate over.The IPL first prevented the use of saliva during the Covid-19 pandemic and lifted the ban just ahead of the ongoing season. The ban, though, is still there in international cricket.Balaji said that using saliva was what bowlers of this generation had grown up with and when suddenly taken away, it became difficult.“There is a thing called comfort level. I am sure that is in Siraj’s case as well. Add to that his experience and he is really looking good,” said the former pacer.While saliva has been a help as the frequency of 200-plus chases has come down significantly, ex-Australian legend Glenn McGrath had earlier said: “I do not think that saliva is the issue; soaking on mint and other things is. I have no issue with using saliva as long as there is nothing else being used.”",Mohammed Siraj has been a standout for Gujarat Titans this IPL season.

I was sleeping a lot.""From there it's been a tough year, a lot of the symptoms didn't go away, which has led me to this decision.""The first few months were horrendous, but things didn't leave me.""Pucovski also revealed some of the serious side effects of concussion including fatigue, headaches and motion sickness.""There’s the mental health symptoms which is one part of it.

I struggle with motion sickness.""Yes (it’s scary), at 27, I have so much ahead of me and I have so many things I want to achieve in my life.
