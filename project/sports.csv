's comeback story with the franchise faces uncertainty as the guard is listed as “questionable” for the upcoming game against the Indiana Pacers due to a right shin contusion. The injury occurred during the recent Philadelphia 76ers matchup, where Russell managed 5 points, 4 assists, 2 steals, and 1 rebound in limited 14-minute playing time.The setback comes at an inopportune moment for the Nets, who are already dealing with Cam Johnson's absence due to an ankle sprain. Russell had shown promise in his Nets return debut, posting 22 points and 8 assists against the Toronto Raptors.Russell said after his initial performance.The guard's return to Brooklyn marks his second stint with the organization, following his previous tenure from 2017-2019. The Los Angeles Lakers traded Russell along with Maxwell Lewis and future draft picks to acquire Dorian Finney-Smith and Shake Milton, positioning him for a reunion with former Montverde Academy teammate Ben Simmons.However, D'Angelo Russell's statistical performance has declined this season, with his three-point shooting percentage dropping from 41.5% to 33.3%. Currently averaging 12.4 points in 26.3 minutes per game, these numbers reflect a challenging period in his career.The Nets, amid a rebuilding phase, suffered a significant 123-94 loss to the 76ers. Russell's potential absence could further complicate their upcoming matchup against the surging Indiana Pacers, who enter the game riding a two-game winning streak.The timing of D'Angelo Russell's injury raises questions about the Brooklyn Nets ' immediate future, as they attempt to integrate their returning guard while managing multiple player absences. The team's medical staff continues to monitor his condition, with a final decision on his availability expected closer to game time.Also read: Stephen Curry shares a strong opinion on the Golden State Warriors' roster following their humiliating loss to the Sacramento Kings: ""Nobody likes to get embarassed like that"" Let us know in the comments who you are supporting tonight.

NFL fined Travis Kelce $14K for paying tribute to Tony Gonzalez with a TD celebration dunk

The NFL has imposed a $14,069 fine on Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce for unsportsmanlike conduct during his Christmas Day touchdown celebration . In the fourth quarter, Kelce dribbled the ball on the crossbar of the goalpost after receiving a 12-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Patrick Mahomes, paying tribute to Hall of Fame and former Chiefs tight end Tony Gonzalez.The Kansas City Chiefs end their regular season on Sunday but have playoff hopes that do not matter in significance. The No. 1 seed for the AFC has been guaranteed; their game with the Denver Broncos would actually secure the position in the final playoffs for the Chiefs, a win may still allow a pathway for either Miami Dolphins or Cincinnati Bengals.The Chiefs will be resting top starters, including Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, and Chris Jones, for two weeks to prepare for the postseason. The NFL has fined Kelce for a mistake in Week 17, causing a slight upset during Kelce's holidays and time off.On Christmas Day, Kelce caught a touchdown pass from Mahomes against the Pittsburgh Steelers, dunking the ball through the goal posts in celebration. The celebration was intended to pay homage to Tony Gonzalez, a legendary tight end and former Chief, but Kelce's attempt was deemed inappropriate and ultimately failed.However, the NFL banned a controversial celebration that led to a penalty flag and a $14,069 fine for Travis Kelce. Fans were shocked by this decision, but the NFL is known for its strict stance on bizarre events. Kelce acknowledged the Steelers' win as a commendable offense, despite its perceived snobbery to casual No Fun League viewers.""You know I had to show love to the greatest of all time!! you did mention you’d help me with the fine tho,"" Kelce stated, meaning that Gonzalez will be pitching in some dough.Travis Kelce has been penalized before for a questionable action in a 2020 game against the New York Jets. With the record, he probably won't do it again. But Kelce's exuberant personality might make for some thrilling celebrations in the postseason as the Chiefs pursue the first Super Bowl three-peat in NFL history.Also Read: The Chiefs' flight finally departed after being delayed for four hours in Kansas City due to an ice storm that disrupted operations The NFL Collective Bargaining Agreement mandates that 50% of fine money collected from players should go to the Players Assistance Trust, run by the NFLPA, for the care of retired players, and the remaining half goes to charitable organizations jointly determined by the NFL and the NFLPA.","NFL fined Travis Kelce $14K for paying tribute to Tony Gonzalez with a TD celebration dunk.

NEW DELHI: An out-of-sorts Indian team succumbed to a six-wicket loss in the fifth and final Test, handing Australia a 3-1 series victory and reclaiming the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after a decade. This defeat, coupled with India's inability to make the World Test Championship final, underscores a period of transition fraught with challenges and questions about the team's direction.Despite flashes of brilliance, India's campaign lacked consistency. Jasprit Bumrah 's 32 wickets in five matches earned him the Player of the Series award, yet his absence due to back spasms in the final Test highlighted India's over-reliance on their star players. Bumrah's absence left the bowling attack toothless, while the batting unit failed to provide the fight required in a high-stakes clash.The series loss marked back-to-back defeats for India, a rarity since 2014. While the players seemed burdened by the weight of expectations, Virat Kohli , in what could be his last Test on Australian soil, garnered attention for his ""sandpaper gesture,"" a move that Australian media widely criticized but dismissed as irrelevant to the outcome.The Australian press, in contrast, celebrated their team's triumph with unrestrained praise. The Sydney Morning Herald emphasized Australia's resilience: ""Australia responded in emphatic and clinical fashion, going on to win three of the next four matches and consigning India to back-to-back series defeats for the first time since 2014.""News.com.au ignited debate by dubbing this Australian team the ""greatest ever,"" crediting captain Pat Cummins for completing a collection of every major cricketing trophy. The outlet remarked: ""Cummins' legacy is quickly becoming a guy who just wins things for fun.""It also took note of Kohli's actions during the Sydney Test, stating, ""Virat Kohli then elected to fire up the crowd with a bizarre sandpaper gesture, the act raised eyebrows but it didn't do anything to stop the Aussies.""The ABC Sport called the series win ""the defining moment of the Pat Cummins era,"" remarking on Australia's historic comeback after an opening-Test loss. ""This is now the defining victory of the Pat Cummins era,"" it declared.The Weekend Australian credited Australia's ""cult heroes"" for the victory while hinting at India's flawed planning: ""India might have been better off if some of their heroes had stayed at home.""Meanwhile, The Courier Mail criticized Kohli's antics, labeling them as a parting shot from a ""pantomime villain.""For India, the series defeat raises pressing concerns.

The Chiefs might lose two coordinators

The NFL 's Black Monday has shifted focus to the upcoming head coaching carousel, with teams that have already fired their head coaches beginning their searches early. The Jets have already done so, while the New Orleans Saints are reportedly considering a prominent candidate.The Kansas City Chiefs will likely lose two coordinators after New Orleans Saints consider Matt Nagy as their head coach. The Saints will look for a new coach following the axing of Dennis Allen on November 4, who was axed despite holding a 2-7 record and second-last in the NFC South. Since then, Darren Rizzi has led them to a 3-4 record and gotten some life out of Derek Carr and Alvin Kamara but the damage was already done and they have missed out on the 2024/25 NFL Playoffs.""Expect the Saints to show interest in former Bears head coach and current Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy,"" The Athletic's Dianna Russini reported in her column on Saturday. ""I also expect interim head coach Darren Rizzi to get a shot at the job full-time.”She added that Mike McCarthy could also be a candidate if the Cowboys don't retain him. In November, the Saints fired Dennis Allen after a 2-7 start. Matt Nagy, a former quarterback coach and senior assistant, has been the offensive coordinator since 2023 to help Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Rashee Rice, and DeAndre Hopkins.Nagy was once the OC for Kansas City and head coach of the Chicago Bears, where he was praised for his successful team culture. He took the Bears to two postseason appearances in the NFC Wild Card games, before being sacked in his fourth year after finishing with a 6-11 record. He then returned to the Arrowhead Stadium.Spagnuolo, who was a former head coach for the St Louis Rams, was fired after a 10-38 record after three seasons.

A Touchdown Worth Screaming Over



10 Burning Questions with Simone Biles | Sports Illustrated

From Sidelines to Social Media: Simone's All In



The Ultimate Power Couple



From world-class gymnast to number-one NFL fan, Simone Biles is doing it all. Fresh off her incredible year—three Olympic golds, no less—Simone has swapped the spotlight for the stands, cheering on her husband, Jonathan Owens, during his debut season with the Chicago Bears .And boy, has she made her presence felt! Whether it's her over-the-top reactions or sweet sideline moments, Simone is proving that being Mrs. Owens might just be her favorite title yet.When Jonathan Owens scored his first touchdown as a Chicago Bear, Simone's reaction was nothing short of dramatic. ""I screamed so hard and loud, I thought I was going to pass out!"" Simone revealed during a recent chat with Sports Illustrated. ""I couldn't breathe—I was very ecstatic.""That moment will be remembered when, in September 2024, Jonathan recovered a blocked punt and ran it into the end zone for the Bears' first touchdown of the season. It was a thrilling play, but more than that, it changed the game. It narrowed the score to 17-10 and set up a 24-17 Bears victory.On X (formerly Twitter), Simone captioned one of her excited posts to her fans: ""I ALMOST HAD A HEART ATTACK."" Well, let's just say that if cheering were an Olympic sport, Simone would already win another gold by now.Jonathan's stay with the Bears hasn't been an easy journey, but through it all has been his pillar, Simone. She recently ventured out in a cold weather match between the Green Bay Packers and Bears at Lambeau Field where she donned her signature energy with her white jersey repping Jonathan's number 36. The drama that played out there in that thrilling 24-22 win that gave Bears is still in vivid memories for a long time.After the win, Simone lit up Instagram with a celebratory post: “A Bears win babyyyyyyy! Bear Down!” But the night wasn’t without its lighter moments. Jonathan, in an attempt at the iconic Lambeau Leap, slipped and fell short—earning chuckles from fans and commentators alike. Fox NFL’s analysts couldn’t resist a jab, joking that Simone might need to give him a crash course on how to land a perfect jump.While Simone has spent the year dominating gymnastics, she's also been Jonathan's biggest supporter. Whether it's enduring freezing sidelines or celebrating his big plays, Simone has shown up for her husband in every way.And Jonathan knows just how much it means. ""I always look for her on the sidelines,"" he's admitted before, crediting Simone with bringing him good vibes before every game.Despite the ups and downs that the Bears have been experiencing this season, one thing has been constant: the love and partnership between Simone and Jonathan. They prove that teamwork makes the dream work in both sports and life, with Simone always encouraging him and Jonathan gaining confidence on the field.Also read - What Bo Nix’s Wife Izzy Posted After Broncos Shut Out the Chiefs Will Surprise You!","Simone Biles has been cheering on her husband, Jonathan Owens, during his debut season with the Chicago Bears.

Gautam Gambhir press conference: On Kohli, Rohit and dressing room

Former cricket stars Ravi Shastri and Ricky Ponting have praised the record-breaking attendance at the recent five-match Test series between India and Australia. They suggested this rivalry might now surpass the Ashes in significance.Australia triumphed 3-1, ending India's decade-long dominance of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. The series attracted a remarkable 837,000 spectators across the five Tests.Former India coach Shastri described the rivalry between the two teams as ""unreal"" in the modern era.""One stat stands out: 375,000 people coming through the gates in that Melbourne Test match, beating the record set 90 years ago of 350,000,"" Shastri said on 'The ICC Review'.""(In) 1936/1937, when the 'G' could hold 120,000 people and when Bradman was playing.""It just goes to show the sudden interest in the modern era. The bar has been raised. The bar has been raised big time.""""For people to get out there and watch cricket when there is television, when there is OTT platforms, where all that is there, still for 375,000 people to come (to Melbourne) and then replicate that in Sydney with full houses, it's unreal,"" Shastri added.Shastri, who coached India during their consecutive Test series wins in Australia in 2017-18 and 2020-21, also commended Australian captain Pat Cummins. ""He (Cummins) amazes me,"" said the former India all-rounder.""Even when I was the coach in the dressing room, I would just admire his determination, his willingness to compete. He never gives up and it's like that session after session – he'll come at you with the ball.""And just when the chips were down, various times in the series, he rose to the occasion. And not just with the ball, but with the bat as well.""Ponting echoed Shastri's sentiments, emphasising the unprecedented attendance numbers in Australia.""So now that this series has happened, Australia have England coming out next summer so we'll get a better idea then. If the numbers aren't the same, then there'll be no doubt that the (Border-Gavaskar) rivalry (is bigger), certainly from the fans' point of view.""There's two separate parts to this: There's what the fans want to see and the rivalry that they want to make of it, but it's also how the players view the rivalry between the three teams now,"" Ponting said.Ponting noted that the attendance figures could have been even higher if not for weather interruptions and early finishes.""Perth only went four days, Adelaide only went three days, Sydney only went three days. Those numbers would have been astronomical if those Test matches all went five days. So exactly this time next year, we'll have a great idea of the biggest rivalry in world cricket.""The fans, understanding how good these two cricket teams are, want to be there and want to be part of it and want to see Test match cricket at its absolute best,"" Ponting said.""Right now, it's really hard to argue that this isn't the biggest rivalry in world cricket. It's grown.""Year on year and Ravi (Shastri) and I, we've been a part of most of these the last 15, 20 years. We've felt how it's been growing and growing and the rivalry gets bigger and now the fans are into it as well.""Ponting also praised Australia's ability to bounce back after a loss.""When you lose a Test match (in Perth) like that against another very strong opposition side, you do have to do a bit of soul searching and do a lot of talking,"" he said.""It's been a really good turnaround, especially when at the start of the series, I thought Australia would win 3-1, but I actually thought they'd win the early Test matches.""I thought they'd win Perth, I thought they'd win Brisbane and probably Adelaide and find it harder in Melbourne and Sydney.""The conditions that you think India would normally play better in, Australia's found a way to outplay them in Melbourne and Sydney.""It was a really good turnaround and one that they'll be happy with.""","Ravi Shastri and Ricky Ponting have praised the record-breaking attendance at the recent five-match Test series between India and Australia.

So, we can expect a strong roster for the Bucks tonight.Lillard’s availability comes after an impressive showing in the Bucks' recent 105-102 loss to Portland, where he posted 31 points and 11 rebounds. His performance against the Trail Blazers demonstrated no apparent limitations from the knee condition.The Milwaukee Bucks , currently positioned fifth in the Eastern Conference with a 17-16 record under Doc Rivers, will need Lillard’s presence as they aim to improve their standing. His career numbers against Toronto showcase consistent impact, averaging 25.8 points, 4.1 rebounds, and 7.3 assists across 23 matchups.Milwaukee has made a number of roster changes based on the injury report. Andre Jackson Jr. is still doubtful with a non-COVID sickness, while Johnson, Livingston, Robbins, and Smith are absent because of G League assignments. Due to bilateral ankle issues, veteran Khris Middleton has joined Antetokounmpo on the probable list. Giannis Antetokounmpo is more dominant on the court than Damian Lillard. His current lead in fan votes for his conference's NBA All-Star Game, which he shares with Nikola Jokić of the opposing conference, is proof that the latter's supremacy goes beyond regular season play. Lillard is still an extremely important player for the Bucks, though.With 36 points, 5 rebounds, and 6 assists in their earlier meeting this season, Damian Lillard put on a strong effort against the Raptors, raising the possibility of another significant performance on Monday.Also read: Will Giannis Antetokounmpo play against the Toronto Raptors tonight?

Will Sinner and Swiatek's positive tests take the sheen off the Australian Open?

Nick Kyrgios has had a go at Sinner and Swiatek on social media, even hoping to play Sinner...

Novak Djokovic (Reuters Photo)

Would you say Djokovic has a few more years left in tennis?

What motivates Djokovic?

How do you like Alcaraz's chances at Melbourne Park?

How does on-court coaching help someone as gifted as Carlos Alcaraz?

Who would you pick as the surprise factor?

What are Sinner's chances of defending his title?

With the transition from the Big Three era, how do you envision the future of men's tennis?

What is the future of doubles?

The 22-time Grand Slam doubles and mixed-doubles champion Todd Woodbridge dismissed the effect of Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek's positive tests on the Australian Open, starting on Sunday in Melbourne Park.The 53-year-old believes the cases were handled swiftly and will not weigh on the first major of the year. In an interview with select media, Woodbridge liked Carlos Alcaraz's chances while warning that Novak Djokovic is motivated to extend his lead at the top of the game.Definitely not! One of the great positives to come out of those cases is the fact that our sport is dealing with them properly. It means our testing is rigid, we have a 52-week policy that players must abide by. The next part is the process they went through.There was negativity about Simona Halep's process, how long it took, why it took so long and then our processes were fixed. So you've had two of the best players in the world that had an issue, they have both been able to prove what those issues were. And remember, you are innocent until proven guilty.They were able to show cause and effect and the process was fast. It has allowed everybody to get back to normal. That is important because they're not going to be the last. There will be other players that are going to trip over or some that may deliberately cheat. There are going to be issues, but I am pleased with the process.As a former athlete, I would never want to put more pressure on myself, that's probably putting more pressure on his own self to have to perform. If that ( Sinner vs Kyrgios ) were to play out, it would be interesting viewing.Nick has been out of the game for a long time (almost two years), which is going to be a difficult thing for him. I hope he hasn't set his expectations too high because it's going to take time to get back to the level that he was playing at before that.He's certainly one of the favourites for the Australian Open. He comes in as little more of an underdog (this year) because he didn't do the best at Grand Slams in 2024, but he was in the Wimbledon final, he won the Olympics, he is knocking on the door. He's fit and motivated. While you've got the motivation, you don't stop. There's at least another two years in Novak, particularly if he has a strong start to this season in Australia.The thing that motivates him is winning Grand Slam titles, it's about extending his lead. No one is ever going to catch him. What drives an athlete like him is having somebody push him and that was Andy Murray Roger Federer , Rafa (Nadal) they challenged him. Now Alcaraz and Sinner have come along and I think he's got a bit to prove to them, that I'm not willing to give it all up yet. That's his motivating factor right now.This is his best chance yet. He didn't get to Australia after winning his first major (US Open, 2022), was injured. Then last year, he didn't have his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero, and he looked tactically unsure and didn't play his best. This time, he has done a proper pre-season. Alcaraz is so dangerous. He's the most enjoyable player to watch since Federer. He has the flair and finesse of Roger, fitness and movement of Novak and then the Spanish determination that Rafa had. He is probably my pick for the Australian Open based on the time he's had to prep. It will be some feat if he was able to win the Australian Open and then have all four majors at such a young age.As he's getting older he's starting to accumulate his own experiences to know what to do at the right time. One of the joys of watching him is that he has so many options, that's why it's so important for him. I'm hoping it's going to be a long career as he learns how to discipline his play because sometimes he plays a lot of drop shots and it's fancy and he can let an opponent back into a match.As you get older, you get more disciplined, you understand how to get that done. That was what Roger started to do very well when he was at his absolute prime, would just demolish players with the right shots at the right time. Carlos is still really putting all that together, he's still got a lot to improve on.I'm waiting for Mirra Andreeva to step up. She has this incredible allcourt game that's modern. It resembles Martina Hingis at her best, but with that modern power.Very high. He is the best player in the world right now. He's the defending champion, but that for me is going to be the one thing he's going to have to learn to live with. He hasn't defended a Grand Slam title yet in his career, this is his first.Everyone was worried. Will the quality drop? And I seriously didn't think that the younger generation would be able to play well this quickly, but they have. Some of their plays are quite extraordinary.They are stronger, more physically trained through technology and data. All of that has made the next generation better. There's still room for this generation to add nuance to their game, add that feel, soft hands, volleys, playing in different parts of the court.It depends on how much the governing bodies continue to make it important. When you see it as an Olympic sport, it remains something everyone focuses upon. When you look at the Grand Slams, it's important, huge events where they need content on all courts, not just Centre Court. So, I don't see it ever leaving the game. And throw in the team competitions like Billie Jean King Cup, Davis Cup , United Cup, they become crucial. Let's be honest, not every player will end up like a Sinner or an Alcaraz or a Sabalenka.(Tune in to watch the Australian Open 2025 from January 12, 2025, 5:30 AM IST onwards live on Sony Sports Ten 1, 2 & 5 channels)",Todd Woodbridge says Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek's positive tests will not have an impact on the Australian Open. The 22-time Grand Slam doubles and mixed- doubles champion also likes Carlos Alcaraz's chances.

Charvarius Ward may consider leaving the team in free agency due to dealing with PTSD

Charvarius Ward may not return to the San Francisco 49ers next season because of PTSD that he is still dealing with from the loss of his 1-year-old daughter. Ward has revealed that this offseason might mark the end of his time with the 49ers as he decides what he wants to do in his NFL career. Ward announced last October that his daughter, Amani Joy , died due to two heart holes and Down syndrome, which he had previously revealed last year. No cause of death was given.San Francisco 49ers cornerback Charvarius Ward will face a difficult year in free agency in March after his daughter, Amani Joy, died before her second birthday due to heart issues. Ward spoke publicly about the season's challenges, his future in San Francisco, and his thoughts on what might be next after his daughter's death. Ward, in a 10-minute conversation, acknowledged that a more likely outcome is a fresh start elsewhere, where the pain of his daughter's loss is less prevalent.""I've got a lot of trauma in California,"" Ward said. ""I had a lot of great times, but the worst thing that's ever happened to me, that's probably going to ever happen to me -- knock on wood -- happened in California. It can just bring up bad memories. Every time I get on a plane and come back to California, Santa Clara, San Jose, and show up here, it just brings up bad memories.”He added, ""I go through that every day. I go home every night by myself because my girl, she doesn't want to come back to California because of what happened. So, it is hard being alone, and she's my strength right now. I need her, and so her not being able to be around me if I'm in California, it'd be tough.”Ward has continued to deal with post-traumatic stress disorder because of his daughter's death, which at times causes nighttime sweating and even occasional vomiting. After Amani's death, Ward stepped out of the team for three games before returning on December 1. He featured in five of the last six games, aside from the Detroit Lions loss, to return to Dallas for the birth of his son, Charvarius Jr.""It took everything physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually,"" Ward said. ""It took all of that every day for me to just come here and be able to practice. I wasn't going to meetings half the time. My social battery was so low. It was just hard being around people. I didn't want people to feel sorry for me and everything like that. I just tried to show up and be there for my teammates.”Also Read: The Jacksonville Jaguars have terminated head coach Doug Pederson after their 18th loss in last 23 games Ward, who told ESPN he wanted to be ""the most motivated I've ever been"" entering 2025, signed with the 49ers on a three-year, $42.5 million deal March 17, 2022, and immediately becomes their top corner. Ward says 49ers general manager John Lynch expressed interest in bringing him back, but both sides understand it will come down to what kind of offers the 28-year-old corner might receive elsewhere.","Charvarius Ward may not return to the San Francisco 49ers next season due to PTSD.

He told me his wife Brittany is due to give birth to their 3rd child on Sunday. If she doesn’t give birth by then, she will be induced Monday. There was def extra motivation for Patrick to get that bye week!""Throughout the season, Mahomes had been mindful of his wife's due date, knowing that the birth could fall during the critical playoff period. “Brittany says I've been stressing her out too much this season,” Mahomes revealed in a pre-Christmas interview. “So, I gotta try to not put so much stress on her through these football games and get the bye. Hopefully, God works the right way and maybe we can have the baby on the bye week somewhere and then everything will work out perfectly.”This new addition to the Mahomes family will be their third child, joining their two other young children, Sterling Skye (born on February 20, 2021) and Patrick “Bronze” Lavon Mahomes III (born on November 28, 2022).

Sydney Cricket Ground is love at first sight: SCG museum, walk of fame and all the facilities

Former India cricketer Harbhajan Singh has raised concerns about the Indian cricket team's sudden decline in red-ball and ODI formats following their T20 World Cup triumph in Barbados under Rohit Sharma's captaincy.In a video posted on his YouTube channel, Harbhajan highlighted the team's struggles, particularly in Tests, and urged the management to prioritise performance over reputation in player selection.""Everything was fine till Rahul Dravid was there. India won the World Cup, and everything was fine. But what happened suddenly?"" Harbhajan questioned, seemingly pointing to the drastic dip in results since the coaching transition to Gautam Gambhir's regime. He noted that while the team retained its dominance in T20Is, their performances in Tests and ODIs have been inconsistent.India suffered a historic home Test series whitewash against New Zealand and a 3-1 defeat to Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, marking the first time in a decade that Australia reclaimed the trophy. Harbhajan said, ""In the past six months, we lost to Sri Lanka, a series whitewash against New Zealand, and now a 3-1 defeat in Australia. Everything seems to have fallen apart.""Senior players Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have come under scrutiny for their lackluster performances during the Australia series. Kohli managed just 190 runs at an average of 23.75 in eight innings, frequently dismissed by Scott Boland, while Rohit scored only 31 runs across three Tests. Harbhajan suggested that the management should move beyond the ""superstar attitude"" and focus on form and potential.""Every player has a reputation. If this is the thing, then add Kapil Dev , Anil Kumble, or those who have been India's biggest match-winners. BCCI and selectors should take hold. India should leave behind the superstar attitude,"" he said.He also criticised the lack of opportunities for promising players like Abhimanyu Easwaran and Sarfaraz Khan , who were part of the squad but did not play. ""Abhimanyu Easwaran was taken on tour, but he didn't play. He can become a player for India if he is given the opportunity. Sarfaraz is the same case. The player who performs should go [to England]. You should not pick players on reputation,"" Harbhajan added.With no immediate Test matches before the tour of England in seven months, Harbhajan believes India have time to reflect and rebuild. He called on the BCCI and selectors to ensure performance-based selections and take decisive steps to steer the team back on track. ""The ball is in the selectors’ court now. They have to decide,"" Harbhajan concluded.","Former India cricketer Harbhajan Singh has raised concerns about the Indian cricket team's sudden decline in red-ball and ODI formats.

As the match ended, cricket memes went viral on social media platforms. Here are some of the viral memes that just capture the emotion/sadness of Indian Cricket fans.

Record number of spectators

Australia clinched a thrilling 184-run victory over India in a dramatic final session of the fourth Test in Melbourne, taking a 2-1 lead in the five-match series. India, needing 340 to win, collapsed to 155 all out, losing their last seven wickets for just 34 runs in 20.3 overs. India appeared to be heading for a draw after Yashasvi Jaiswal (84) and Rishabh Pant (30) steered them to 112-3 at tea. However, Pant's dismissal, attempting a six off Travis Head, triggered a batting collapse.Controversy arose with Jaiswal's dismissal. Initially given not out to a caught-behind appeal, the TV umpire overturned the decision based on visual evidence of the ball changing direction, despite the absence of audible noise. Jasprit Bumrah was exceptional for India, taking 5-57 in the second innings and nine wickets in the match. He had reduced Australia to 91-6 at one stage, a lead of less than 200.The match set a record attendance for cricket in Australia, with 373,591 spectators. Head described the atmosphere as inspiring and hailed the match as one of the best he has been involved in.

Gautam Gambhir press conference: On Kohli, Rohit and dressing room

How Australia celebrated Border-Gavaskar Trophy win in Sydney

NEW DELHI: 151.2 overs or 908 deliveries and 32 wickets — these are the astonishing stats of Player of the Series Jasprit Bumrah in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Despite that, Australia regained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after 10 years. Bumrah's phenomenal performances Down Under, did however, firmly establish him as one of the most reliable workhorses in modern Test cricket.The immense workload Bumrah shouldered throughout the series raises concerns about his physical limits.The 31-year-old pacer bowled over 150 overs, called upon every single day of the tour, either with the ball or bat. His stellar series average of 13.06 and an economy of 2.77 highlight his effectiveness, with best figures of 6/76.During the fifth and final Test in Sydney, anxiety gripped the Indian camp when Bumrah, who had bowled 10 overs and taken two wickets, left the field during the second session with the physio. He later departed the venue in a car, accompanied by the team doctor and BCCI integrity manager, Anshuman Upadhyay.Bumrah didn’t return to bowl in the second innings. Instead, he remained in the dugout, missing out on the action as India lost both the Test and the series.Is the workload catching up with Bumrah?Former India pacer and 1983 World Cup-winner Balwinder Sandhu believes that bowling 15-20 overs in a Test innings should not be a significant challenge for a pacer at the highest level.""Workload? How many overs did he bowl? 150-something, right? But in how many matches or innings? Five matches or nine innings, correct? That comes down to 16 overs per innings or 30 overs per match. And he didn’t bowl those 15-plus overs in one go. He bowled in spells. So, is it a big deal? Workload management is bull****. These are Australian terms, created by Australians. Workload management is nothing. I don’t agree with this. I come from an era when cricketers used to listen to their bodies and no one else. I don’t agree with this at all,"" Sandhu told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.""Bowling 15 overs in a day, and that too in different spells, is not a big deal for a bowler. You’re not bowling on all five days of a Test match. He took three or four spells to bowl those overs. Today, you have the best physios, the best masseurs, and excellent doctors to take care of your body. If a bowler can’t bowl 20 overs in an innings, he should forget about playing for India.If you want to represent India, you should have the strength to bowl at least 20 overs in an innings. If you can’t, then it’s better to go back and play T20s, where you only need to bowl four overs. Even those four overs are bowled in three spells,"" he said.""We used to bowl 25–30 overs in a day. Kapil (Dev) has bowled long spells throughout his career. Your body and muscles get conditioned when you bowl, bowl, and bowl. So, I don’t agree with this workload management concept,"" the former pacer said.","Jasprit Bumrah was named Player of the Series in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

How Australia celebrated Border-Gavaskar Trophy win in Sydney

SYDNEY: There is no way to sugarcoat this. The long Australian summer has broken Indian cricket's back. The team now needs to spend time in the infirmary before the next big challenge, the five Test series in England in the middle of the year.What would have been a celebration of a wonderful series which drew record crowds now needs to be a dissection of India's failings. For Rohit Sharma 's men, this has been a series of missteps, one bigger than the other. Any introspection must feature some key considerations. Most of them revolve around team composition and dressing-room atmosphere.One is whether the team paid the price for its conservative approach of lengthening the batting order by including allrounders. The second is whether that decision was prompted by the desire to safeguard the spots of some spent forces.The third is owning responsibility for the decision to bowl Jasprit Bumrah to the ground by consistently denying him the support of a frontline fourth pacer in seaming conditions.Over-reliance on Bumrah led to his breakdown in Sydney, preventing him from playing a part as India failed to draw the series. Was it merely wishful thinking that Bumrah would pull through, or was a more scientific assessment made of his increasing workload through the series?That brings us to the role of the backroom staff, and whether new head coach Gautam Gambhir and his support personnel did enough to quell the chaos as panic and confusion set in the ranks following the MCG defeat.That last bit is important because Australia skipper Pat Cummins, whose team resembled India in many ways at the start of the series - a bevy of senior players, two main batters facing prolonged run drought, talk of transitioning to the younger lot - said staying calm after defeat in the first Test in Perth had played a big role in their success.""When you start a series behind, a lot of things get questioned, fairly or unfairly. It shows the strength of the group to stay strong, know that we weren't at our best but can get better, know we won't get caught up in the external noise and clutter, and just focus on what makes us good players and a good team,"" Cummins said here after Australia reclaimed the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after a decade. ""More than what you change, it's about what you don't change.""In contrast, as rumours swirled around captain Rohit dropped for the fifth Test, the team management added to the intrigue by refusing to make things official. What happened off the field seemed to affect India on it.The team was flying high after Perth on the form of Bumrah, a generational talent with the uncanny ability to peak at the right moments. It was the return of their regular captain from paternal leave that seemed to upset the balance of the XI.Some baffling decisions were made, all to goad Rohit into regaining some sort of form. KL Rahul was retained as opener, shuffled to No. 3 and shifted back again once Rohit realized in Sydney that runs had deserted him.Shubman Gill's overseas record is poor, but he had got starts in Adelaide before being unceremoniously dropped in Melbourne as Rohit decided to reclaim his opening slot.There were other strange decisions, like playing two spinners on the Sydney green top, the most difficult batting surface in the series. Why wasn't a fourth frontline seamer or even a regular batter picked in place of Washington Sundar?With Bumrah unavailable, the end result was that Prasidh Krishna and Mohammed Siraj bowled 24 of the 27 overs as Australia cantered to the 162-run target.Nitish Reddy as fourth seamer was another contentious choice. His gentle medium-pace let off the pressure on the Aussie batters and ensured the main seamers didn't get enough breaks. The other bowling options were spinners, in Ashwin, Jadeja and Sundar, and were of little use on these pacy surfaces.At times, the team composition even seemed T20 driven, no surprise given that the coach and captain's credentials stem from T20 success.Asked after the Melbourne defeat if he was happy to pack his side with batting allrounders instead of another frontline seamer, Rohit said, ""Akash (Deep) and Siraj are the frontline seamers (to support Bumrah). It's just that they've been very unfortunate not to be seen on the wickets column. These are the three frontline seamers and whoever plays needs to get the job done for the team.""Reddy's momentous century at No. 8 at the MCG was an immediate pointer to the poor form of stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit up the order. Both came to Australia hoping to tide over what seemed like terminal decline. Both failed in spectacular fashion.Kohli's weaknesses outside off-stump and technical failings eventually made him a walking wicket after a strong start in Perth, where he got to face the old Kookaburra ball and scored a century.Kohli now averages 32.29 from his last 40 Tests, 22.47 in 2024, and 23.75 from these five Tests Down Under. All eight of his dismissals were identical, caught behind on the off side, trying to drive deliveries on the fifth or sixth stump line. Scott Boland got him four times, making for one those nice subplots which lit up the series.Surely there is something more going on with Kohli than a temporary dip in form? It could be slowing reflexes or ageing eyesight. It doesn't seem like it is a loss of focus, given the extraordinary effort Kohli has put in the nets across these five Tests here. What should Team India do with its biggest brand and batting talisman? Shouldn't his Test place be up for debate? Are the stars taking their places for granted?As for Rohit, he is a lesser Test batsman than Kohli but an important one, nevertheless. His entire season has been a horror run and that affected his captaincy too. He dropped himself in the fifth Test to save face and his return cannot be dependent on white-ball form.""Not a lot of people are playing for the first time in Australia, probably two in the top eight,"" Gambhir said. ""(Other than) Nitish (Reddy) and Yashasvi (Jaiswal), all the others have the experience of Australia. I'm not going to say it is only because some of the young guys (that India lost). There are a lot of experienced players as well,"" Gambhir said.Even if the team management and selectors are in a hurry to see the backs of Kohli and Rohit, where are the replacements? Can Reddy be a regular Test No. 4? Can KL Rahul, and if so, who opens with Jaiswal?Where are the new breed of Test pacers to support Bumrah? Can Bumrah, given his injury breakdowns and workload-management necessities, take on regular captaincy duties?This was the shortest-ever five-Test series played in a century, lasting 7,664 balls. How much did India's batting failures contribute to that? It's all right saying players must return to domestic cricket, like Gambhir did after the Sydney defeat, but the watered-down standards of tournaments like the Ranji Trophy are unlikely to be of much help.""Ultimately, it is neither my team nor your team, it's the country's team. There are very honest players in our dressing room who know how hungry they are, and how the Indian team (can) go ahead with their contributions. As far as my question is concerned, my biggest responsibility is that I have to be fair to everyone, not only one or two individuals,"" Gambhir said.Known as a confrontational character in his playing days, Gambhir knows his own job is under the scanner, given India's poor record since he took over.Questions are being raised why the assistant coaches need to be changed with every new head coach.Gambhir's role may have started with talk of transition, but it will eventually need to move on to identifying and nurturing top talent. England will be a stern test.",India failed to draw the series against Australia after losing the fifth Test. India paid a heavy price for its conservative approach of lengthening the batting line-up. Over-reliance on Jasprit Bumrah led to his breakdown in Sydney.

Sam Konstas horoscope: 'He will be like Rishabh Pant and Yuvraj Singh'

When India head coach Gautam Gambhir lost his cool in Australia

The astrological analysis of Australia's latest Test player Sam Konstas by Greenstone Lobo on 'StarPlay: Cricket & Astrology ' indicates that the opening batter can go on to become one of the greats of Australian cricket.Konstas made his debut in the Boxing Day Test of the 2024-25 Border Gavaskar Trophy after another youngster Nathan McSweeney failed to deliver in the first three matches of the series.Looking for someone to partner Usman Khawaja at the top after the retirement of David Warner, Australia put their faith in Konstas for the last two matches and he repaid that with a stroke-filled 60 off 65 balls on debut. En route that knock, he stunned Jasprit Bumrah by hitting him for a six and a four off ramp shots.Konstas irritated the Indian team with his aggressive approach, which led to many verbal duels between him and the Indian players, particularly Virat Kohli and Bumrah, before the series ended 1-3 in favour of Australia.Giving details about what the future has in store for Konstas according to his horoscope, Lobo said, ""Sam is a combination of Leo and Virgo, more a Leo; and Leos love to play these audacious shots, which shocks people, mesmerizes them and makes them leap in joy. So the ramp shot and the gallery shots is something you would love to do.""Lobo said that Konstas has traits similar to Rishabh Pant and Yuvraj Singh.""This is somewhere similar to what Rishabh Pant does. Pant also has something in Leo and even Yuvraj Singh. All of these players play these audacious shots to stun people. So he's going to be doing that forever, that is his playing style,"" he said.""But together with that, Sam is also a Virgo. He has his sun in Mercury and Virgo, which makes him a perfectionist. What it means is that all of those shots he plays, they are pure talent. They are not manufactured or agricultural shots. He plays those shots with perfection, perfecting them 100 times.""So the combination is lethal. He is a perfectionist with audacity,"" he added.Lobo said that Konstas's stars suggest that he has the potential to replace Warner.""He can even go on to be a great of the game. Konstas is not a two-Test wonder or five-Test wonder. He is going to play for many, many years to come...He can even go on to replace David Warner.""",Astrological analysis of Australia's latest Test player Sam Konstas by Greenstone Lobo on 'StarPlay: Cricket & Astrology'indicates that the opening batter can go on to become one of the greats of Australian cricket.

Gautam Gambhir press conference: On Kohli, Rohit and dressing room

NEW DELHI: Following India's 3-1 Border-Gavaskar Trophy defeat to Australia, Yograj Singh , father of legendary Yuvraj Singh , offered his analysis of the senior Indian batters' performance struggles. Yograj particularly noted Virat Kohli 's dismissals, suggesting the need for proper guidance regarding shot selection.Kohli scored only 190 runs across five Tests, with eight dismissals whilst chasing deliveries outside off-stump. Rohit, absent from the Perth Test due to his second child's birth, scored merely 31 runs in three Tests before opting to rest for the Sydney Test.Yograj emphasised that whilst India's players might not require conventional coaching, they need effective man-management to enhance their performance.""The role of a coach becomes a significant question when you are playing for India. When you're an exceptional player representing India, you might not necessarily need coaching in the traditional sense. What you truly need is someone for man management. Sometimes, a player's mind gets blocked; they might not be scoring runs, or they keep getting out. No matter how great a player is, they can't be bigger than the game itself,"" Yograj said.""Such players need someone to guide them, to say, 'Let's go to the nets and work on this.' For example, Virat Kohli got out many times playing his favourite shot - the right-hand push. That shot works on Indian pitches, in England, and elsewhere. But on certain pitches where the ball bounces and carries more, someone should have told him, 'Virat, don't play this shot.' Just play straight or leave this ball.""This illustrates the difference between coaching and management. Identifying and pointing out a player's technical fault is coaching. Someone needs to recognise and convey these technical issues to the players. But who will tell Rohit Sharma or Virat Kohli? Even they want someone to come and tell them what's going wrong,"" he added.""I believe what's needed is proper management - someone who understands when a player's mind is blocked, when they're feeling low, and reassures them, saying, 'Don't worry, we're here for you. You'll do it because you're a great player.' Every player faces a downfall, even the greatest ones. It's part of the game,"" he continued.Regarding head coach Gautam Gambhir 's approach, Yograj noted, ""Gambhir is a brilliant cricketer with a brilliant mind. He has the ability to guide the team forward. However, where there's a mistake, he points it out - and rightly so. But to hold the younger players together, proper management is essential.""""Someone needs to tell them, 'Virat, it's no big deal; it happens to everyone.' 'Rohit, don't worry, these phases come and go.' 'Bumrah, you're doing great; just stay focused.' The younger players, especially fast bowlers like Siraj, need to be guided and supported. Someone should stand with them, show them the way, and help them understand the nuances of the game,"" he further said.""When players are down, struggling to perform, management becomes that magic wand that lifts them up,"" Yograj concluded.Following their six-wicket defeat in Sydney, India failed to secure a position in the 2025 World Test Championship final, with Australia set to face South Africa at Lord's for their potential second consecutive title.","Yograj Singh says India's players need effective man-management to enhance their performance.

Gautam Gambhir press conference: On Kohli, Rohit and dressing room

NEW DELHI: The Border-Gavaskar Trophy series between India and Australia drew unprecedented attendance, leading former Australia captain Ricky Ponting to assert that the rivalry is arguably the biggest in world cricket.Traditionally, the England-Australia Ashes rivalry held this status, but the five-Test series saw a record 8,37,879 spectators. Melbourne Cricket Ground alone hosted 3,73,691 fans across five days, surpassing the 1937 record of 3,50,534.Ponting, astonished by the numbers, emphasised the fan-driven intensity of the rivalry.“I had a look at the numbers yesterday, it was something like 837,000 people came to watch the Test matches, which is unheard of here in Australia,” Ponting told The ICC Review. “So now that this series has happened, Australia have England coming out next summer so we'll get a better idea then. If the numbers aren't the same, then there'll be no doubt that the (Border-Gavaskar) rivalry (is bigger), certainly from the fans’ point of view.“There's two separate parts to this: There's what the fans want to see and the rivalry that they want to make of it, but it's also how the players view the rivalry between the three teams now.”Former India head coach Ravi Shastri praised the spectators for elevating the bar for Test cricket. “One stat stands out: 3,75,000 people coming through the gates in that Melbourne Test match, beating the record set 90 years ago of 3,50,000. (In) 1936/1937, when the ‘G’ could hold 120,000 people and when Bradman was playing. It just goes to show the sudden interest in the modern era. The bar has been raised. The bar has been raised big time,"" he said.“For people to get out there and watch cricket when there is television, when there are OTT platforms, where all that is there, still for 375,000 people to come (to Melbourne) and then replicate that in Sydney with full houses, it’s unreal,” Shastri added.Ponting echoed Shastri’s sentiments, crediting the series' narrative for drawing global attention.“The fans, understanding how good these two cricket teams are, want to be there and want to be part of it and want to see Test Match Cricket at its absolute best,” he said. “Right now, it's really hard to argue that this isn't the biggest rivalry in world cricket. It's grown. Year-on-year, and Ravi (Shastri) and I have been a part of most of these for the last 15, 20 years. We've felt how it's been growing and growing and the rivalry gets bigger and now the fans are into it as well,"" Ponting added.The series concluded with Australia reclaiming the trophy after a decade and securing a spot in the World Test Championship (WTC) Final. Ponting lauded Australia's resilience, particularly in Melbourne and Sydney, where they outperformed India in challenging conditions.Shastri also praised Pat Cummins ’ leadership and determination.“He (Cummins) amazes me. Even when I was the coach in the dressing room, I would just admire his determination, and his willingness to compete. He never gives up and it's like that session after session – he'll come at you with the ball,” Shastri said.“And just when the chips were down, various times in the series, he rose to the occasion. And not just with the ball, but with the bat as well.”","The Border-Gavaskar Trophy series between India and Australia drew unprecedented attendance.

The Sydney Pink Test , focusing on cancer awareness, carries deep meaning for Australian cricketer Sam Konstas , who has experienced the impact of cancer within his family.The Pink Test tradition began in 2009, honouring Glenn McGrath 's late wife Jane, who lost her battle with breast cancer in 2008. The McGrath Foundation has since raised millions of dollars for the cause.Konstas shared his personal connection to cancer during a Triple M cricket interview. He spoke about the loss of his cousin to leukemia and his grandfather to bowel cancer. He expressed his desire for the SCG match to continue raising cancer awareness.""Obviously it's a special event, the McGrath Foundation, and hopefully we spread more awareness for cancer, get the funds in, because I remember my cousin passed away with leukaemia and my grandpa with bowel cancer.""So obviously we hope we spread awareness and get the cure,"" Konstas said.Konstas was involved in an on-field exchange with Indian captain Jasprit Bumrah. This happened during the fifth Test match. The incident, however, didn't seem to affect the young batter.The confrontation arose when Konstas approached Bumrah. Bumrah was expressing frustration over Usman Khawaja 's perceived delay in taking guard. The umpires intervened to de-escalate the situation. Bumrah subsequently dismissed Khawaja with the last ball of the day and gave Konstas a send-off.Konstas downplayed the incident and acknowledged Bumrah's skill. He also took some responsibility for the situation.""Oh, I didn't get too fazed. Unfortunately, Uzi got out. He was trying to buy some time a little bit. It was probably my fault, but it happens. It's cricket,"" Konstas said.""Credit to Bumrah. He got the wicket, but obviously great performance from the team.""Konstas was asked about his on-field demeanour. He simply stated his intention to give his best and acknowledged that he might sometimes get on his opponents' nerves.""Don't know. Whatever's on the field, I just try to do my best and, yeah, I guess I got a few nerves on the other team.""Konstas enjoyed a dream debut during the Boxing Day Test at the MCG, showcasing his flair with a daring 60 off 65 balls, including a bold battle against Bumrah, in front of a nearly packed stadium.The home team dominated the match, securing a commanding 184-run victory. They followed it up with a six-wicket win at the SCG, clinching the five-match series 3-1 and ending a 10-year wait for triumph against India.""Yeah, it's been quite special. Obviously Mark Taylor presenting my bag and to top it off with the win today was, yeah, outstanding from the team,"" he said.""I don't think it's kicked in yet, but hopefully in the next few days we'll soak up, reflect on it, but it's been awesome.""The team's been outstanding to me and just letting me play my natural game. Pat Cummins is a great leader and hopefully we can keep going on.""The series defeat dashed India's hopes of reaching the World Test Championship (WTC) final, paving the way for Australia to set up a summit clash with South Africa.Asked if he was feeling nervous before his debut, Konstas said, ""No, I was very calm. I was talking to my parents and all my teammates.""But obviously, it was a packed stadium and Uzi (Khawaja) said my journal was pumped when I was batting, but I didn't feel that, but obviously it was a good debut and glad to get two wins.""After impressing against India, Konstas is expected to be included in the squad for the upcoming Sri Lanka tour.When asked if the fans would see the same Konstas, he said, ""Yeah, I'm not too sure if I'm selected yet. I think we'll find out in the next few days, but obviously adapting to different conditions, maybe we'll find a new Sam, but I think so, but time will tell.""",Australian cricketer Sam Konstas has experienced the impact of cancer within his family.

Gautam Gambhir press conference: On Kohli, Rohit and dressing room

NEW DELHI: Former England captain Michael Vaughan shared his analysis on the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , noting that Team India lost their way following their initial victory against Australia at Perth.The Indian team's promising start with a historic Perth win couldn't be maintained as they ultimately succumbed to a 1-3 series defeat. This victory marked Australia's first Border-Gavaskar Trophy success since their 2014-15 campaign. Virat Kohli 's performance was particularly underwhelming, as the senior batter accumulated only 190 runs across eight innings at a modest average of 23.75, with Scott Boland emerging as his frequent nemesis, dismissing him four times.In his appearance on the Club Prairie Fire Podcast, Vaughan acknowledged the high quality of cricket displayed throughout the series, while pointing out Australia's dominance in the final three matches.""India win the first game in Perth, played great. Since then, they've been blown away, really... You've got to say this series, as much as it's been brilliant cricket, a lot of it, particularly the last three games, has been very one-sided. Australia has managed to get the upper hand and play some great cricket and India have not been able to find a way of throwing a punch back. They've thrown a shoulder barge back, but they haven't been able to throw a punch back,"" Vaughan said.In the final Test at Sydney, India's decision to bat first after winning the toss proved costly. The Indian batting lineup delivered a sub-par show. Australia established control from the beginning, with Scott Boland's impressive bowling spells and newcomer Beau Webster 's excellent batting display.Australia, requiring 162 runs for victory on Day 3, achieved their target with four wickets in hand, securing a convincing win in the fifth and final Test match.","India lost 1-3 to Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series.

NEW DELHI: Pat Cummins ' post-match press conference in Sydney took a heartwarming turn when his son, Albie , made an unexpected yet adorable appearance. The little one stole the spotlight as he toddled into the room.Cummins, beaming with pride, briefly paused to interact with his son, creating a wholesome moment that highlighted the human side of cricket beyond the competition.Reflecting on the 3-1 series win, after beating India by six wickets at Sydney, Cummins said the team felt very privileged over winning the series on their home soil.""It's unreal. It is the one that a few of us didn't have. The boys have had their eye on it and it has lived up to the hype. We were just clear with the plans. Wanted to minimise the runs. We knew it was going to be a tricky wicket. The batters had a good method. Ultimately it worked out.""Immensely proud. We have spent a lot of time as a group. Perth was not as bad as it seems. We have had a lot of fun along the way. Some success along the way is always nice. We feel so privileged to have achieved what we have. It's such a special group. Really proud with what we've been able to achieve and hopefully having the best time of our lives as we're doing it all together,"" said Cummins.Cummins, who has been part of a T20 World Cup-winning squad, triumphed in the 50-over World Cup, claimed the World Test Championship mace, led Australia to Ashes glory, and recently secured a series win in India that his predecessor Tim Paine had lost twice, remains at the peak of his career as skipper.When questioned about a succession plan, Cummins tactfully sidestepped the topic, leaving the future of Australia's captaincy an open-ended discussion.""First of all I just absolutely love what I do. So, I mean that's probably the biggest driver in wanting to play Test Cricket and work with this team and support staff.""So does he feel that he has done it all?""Unfortunately, I have got to keep playing. We'll stay on this side guys and then we'll come over here,"" he smiled and everyone laughed.","Pat Cummins' son, Albie, makes surprise appearance at post-match press conference.

The fourth strikes came in the second half from Modric before Guler completed his brace to seal the scoreline.Madrid introduced strikers Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior only in the second half, as manager Carlo Ancelotti rested them in view of the Spanish Super Cup commencing in Saudi Arabia later this week.The match's early momentum was established when Valverde struck a volley at the far post, followed by Camavinga's header after 13 minutes to extend the advantage.Endrick nearly secured a third goal for Los Blancos, followed by Guler's successful strike, which deflected in after he moved inwards from the right wing.Early in the second period, Brahim Diaz struck the woodwork before veteran Modric, aged 39, scored with an elegant curling shot.In the final moments, Guler converted smoothly after receiving a setup from Fran Garcia, completing an impressive performance by the Turkish midfielder.Barcelona and Atletico Madrid progressed to the subsequent round on Saturday, whilst Athletic Bilbao, the current champions, narrowly advanced via penalties against third-tier Logrones.","Real Madrid thrash Deportivo Minera 5-0 in Copa del Rey.

We haven't achieved anything yet, we need to work until the end and this can lead us to good moments,"" said Espirito Santo.Gibbs-White savoured his return to the club where he spent the early part of his career.In front of the watching new England manager Thomas Tuchel, the midfielder did his case for further international recognition no harm with a cool finish from Antony Elanga's pass.Forest's unexpected rise from battling relegation until the final day of last season into Champions League contenders has been build on a solid defence and Wood's purple patch.The New Zealand international turned in Callum Hudson-Odoi's low cross for his 12th goal of the season to double the visitors' lead just before half-time.Wolves pressed and probed for a way back into the game after the break but were toothless in the absence of talisman Matheus Cunha through suspension.Mats Sels was forced into one brilliant save to deny Jorgen Strand Larsen to preserve a ninth clean sheet of the season and fourth in a row.That solidity is familiar to Wolves fans from Espirito Santo's time in charge of their club between 2017 and 2021.The Portuguese coach led Wanderers from the Championship into Europe for the first time in 39 years.Now after troubled spells at Tottenham and Saudi club Al-Ittihad, he is recreating that magic to leave Forest fans in dreamland.""As coaching staff we have this natural ambition of improving the players, this is what we are obsessed with,"" he added.""If we improve the players then the team will improve and if the team improves then the club will improve and the city will be happy.""",Nottingham Forest beat Wolves 3-0 at Molineux on Monday night.

NEW DELHI: In a dramatic 2-2 draw at Anfield on Sunday, Manchester United came back to end a four-game losing streak and stop Liverpool's run at the Premier League title.With one game remaining, Liverpool leads second-place Arsenal by six points at the top of the league.However, Arne Slot's team lost this chance after rallying from behind to take a 2-1 lead thanks to goals from Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah Amad Diallo tied the score on the 80th minute to give United the point they so richly deserved after breaking their six-year goal drought at Anfield with a superb opening strike from Lisandro Martinez.The Red Devils are now seven points above the relegation zone and in 13th place in the standings.Prior to the match, Liverpool manager Slot warned that United was ""much better"" than their startling league place indicated, and it turned out to be true.In Monday's dreadful 2-0 loss to Newcastle, United was sliced open at will, prompting manager Ruben Amorim to declare the team in a relegation fight.The return of Manuel Ugarte and captain Bruno Fernandes from suspension, as well as Kobbie Mainoo to the starting lineup, strengthened Amorim's hand.Although the Portuguese's strategy of frustrating Liverpool was successful, the home team did have early opportunities to break through.Gakpo poked past the far post after a through pass from Ryan Gravenberch.Shortly after, Salah found Alexis Mac Allister with a sumptuous pass that the Argentine snatched up and caused Andre Onana to make a wonderful physical save.United should have been ahead before halftime, but it took some time for them to establish themselves as an attacking danger.With the goal gaping from Diogo Dalot's cross, Diallo made a mistake with his header.After racing in behind the Liverpool defense, Rasmus Hojlund had the finest opportunity of the first half, but he was unable to defeat Alisson Becker.However, United players who had been dejected in recent weeks were suddenly regaining their confidence.The visitors' breakthrough came from an unexpected source as Martinez scored his second goal for the team with a blazing hit that landed off the underside of the bar, teaching his strikers how to finish.The league leaders were momentarily in disarray, and the Anfield crowd was starting to grow restless.But Liverpool's breadth of weaponry is largely responsible for their top-of-the-table standing.They had a forward who was in form to come up with the magic moment needed to change the game, even on a quiet day for Salah.At the hour, Gakpo scored his 10th goal in 15 games by turning inside his Dutch international teammate Matthijs de Ligt and blasting high beyond Onana.Slot made two forward substitutions right away after the equalizer, introducing Darwin Nunez and Diogo Jota, and he was rewarded for it.With a VAR review, a spot-kick was awarded when MacAllister's header brushed off De Ligt's outstretched arm within the penalty area.Salah scored his 18th Premier League goal in 19 games with a low, powerful smash past Onana.But United's strong performance earned the point it deserved, ending Amorim's worrying losing run so early in his tenure.Alejandro Garnacho's new manager has questioned his temperament, but the Argentine came off the bench to equalize when Diallo turned in his low cross.And with the goal gaping deep into stoppage time, Harry Maguire should have made it even better for United by spooning a pass from Joshua Zirkzee over the bar.",Manchester United came back from 2-1 down to draw 2-2 with Liverpool. Goals from Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah Amad Diallo equalized for Red Devils. Lisandro Martinez opened the scoring for United with a superb strike.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116977005,imgsize-78774,width-400,resizemode-4/116977005.jpg"

City turned corner?

Arsenal blew a chance to make up significant ground on Premier League leaders Liverpool on Saturday with a frustrating draw at Brighton as Manchester City pummelled West Ham 4-1.In-form Newcastle inflicted another painful defeat on Ange Postecoglou's struggling Tottenham and Chelsea's recent woes continued with a 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace.Mikel Arteta's Arsenal, Premier League runners-up over the past two seasons, travelled to the south coast hunting a fourth straight league win in the evening kick-off.Seventeen-year-old Ethan Nwaneri, in for the injured Bukayo Saka, scored a first-half goal to put them on course for a vital three points.But after being felled by an accidental headbutt from William Saliba, stand-in Seagulls captain Joao Pedro fired home from the spot in the 61st minute.The 1-1 draw means the second-placed Gunners are five points behind Liverpool, having played two games more, with Arne Slot's in-form leaders hosting crisis-hit Manchester United on Sunday.Arteta said his team had under-performed in the second half, failing to build momentum, adding that the penalty award was ""bizarre"".""We are really disappointed with the decision that leads to the goal because I have never seen something like this in my life,"" the Spaniard told the BBC.""He (Saliba) touches the ball as well.""Manchester City's win at home against West Ham means they have now won successive matches for the first time since October and Pep Guardiola will hope they are back on track after a horror run of one victory in 13 games in all competitions.The defending champions took an early lead through a Vladimir Coufal own goal and two goals from Erling Haaland put City in total command.Phil Foden made it 4-0 before Niclas Fullkrug grabbed a consolation for Julen Lopetegui's men, who suffered a 5-0 mauling by Liverpool last week.Despite their shocking run, sixth-placed City are just two points behind Chelsea, in fourth, but Guardiola said his team were still not back in the groove.""I'm very pleased for the result but you cannot ask me if the old City is back,"" he said. ""If you saw the game, we are not.""You saw many times during the years what we have done with the opponents.""In the early kick-off, Newcastle came from behind to clinch a fifth straight Premier League win and heap more misery on injury-hit Spurs.The home side went ahead in the fourth minute through Dominic Solanke.Newcastle levelled two minutes later when Anthony Gordon arrowed an effort into the bottom corner, but Postecoglou stood in disbelief on the touchline looking at referee Andrew Madley after Joelinton intercepted Lucas Bergvall's pass with his hand in the build-up.VAR deemed Joelinton's arm to be in a natural position and the contact to be accidental.In-form Alexander Isak scored what turned out to be the winner towards the end of the first period.The 2-1 victory, watched by new England manager Thomas Tuchel, leaves Newcastle in fifth spot, which may yet prove enough to secure a place in the Champions League next season.But Spurs have slumped to 12th in the table after five defeats in seven matches.Postecoglou said he was proud of his players but was the ""angriest I think I have ever been in my career"".""I think it's clear,"" said the Australian. ""Now whether people agree with me or not whether it wasn't handball or it was accidental, I'm just not interested in any of that discussion.""I know what everyone wants me to say, but all I'll say is that on any other day, on a fair and even playing ground, we would have won that game. Simple as that.""Enzo Maresca's Chelsea were breathing down Liverpool's necks just two weeks ago but have taken just two points from four games over the festive period.The prolific Cole Palmer gave the visitors a first-half lead, but they could not capitalise on their possession and Jean-Philippe Mateta levelled in the 82nd minute.Aston Villa beat relegation-threatened Leicester 2-1 at home, with goals from Ross Barkley and Leon Bailey.Brentford recorded their first league win on the road this season, smashing hapless Southampton 5-0, and Bournemouth beat Everton 1-0.",Arsenal blow chance to make up significant ground on Premier League leaders Liverpool.
