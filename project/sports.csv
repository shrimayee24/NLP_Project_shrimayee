GEORGETOWN: In most parts of the West Indies, the old-fashioned way of walking down the runway to the plane still prevails. It's fun on most days, but at night with the rain lashing down, the walk to take the flight, or to deplane, can get a little tricky.On Tuesday night, a small flight of about 80 people, consisting mostly of people related to the T20 World Cup, landed in Georgetown and were greeted by persistent showers.As the passengers all dashed for the shade, one could see the tall figure of Australian umpire Rod Tucker running alongside. When somebody asked Tucker whether he would be officiating the game, he laughed: ""Well, yes, if it happens"".""If it happens."" That's the operative word on everybody's lips as India get ready to play England in Rohan Kanhai land on Thursday.It's been raining for the last couple of days in Guyana and it didn't stop through the morning on Wednesday. What the locals are hoping is that if it rains on one day, it doesn't on the other. But then, that's clutching at straws, especially when the forecast is as bad as it is for Thursday.Probably the only ones who don't care are the Indian fans who have tickets for the final in Barbados on Saturday but couldn't manage one for the semifinal here. India will make the final if it's a washout because they topped their Super 8 group.The ICC has extended the cut-off time for calling the game off by four hours than what it was earlier, but for all that to happen, the rain has to stop first. ""This is rain time in Guyana, why did they even schedule the game here? That too without a reserve day,"" mused a local in anguish.But the guys who will benefit the most if it keeps raining - the Indian team - are the ones who don't want it to happen this way. The sun came out here after the morning showers on match eve and after India completed a practice session at the quick drying Providence Stadium , captain Rohit Sharma said: ""We are not looking at a curtailed game. When we come tomorrow, we will hope that it is a full game, but if it is so, we will adapt.""This game has a lot riding on emotionally as well for the Indian team because it is their chance to get revenge on a team that had humiliated them in the 2022 T20 World Cup semis. Though the return of Jasprit Bumrah , who missed that World Cup with an injury, has been the single most important change that has happened since then, Rohit insists ""not much has changed"".""We have thought and discussed and thrashed out numerous times what needs to be done. It's about keeping it going,"" the skipper said.Bumrah apart, it's Kuldeep Yadav who has been another superb inclusion once India landed in the West Indies. His quality and guile have been difficult to deal with for most opponents and England shouldn't be any exception.The defending champions, though, have a bit of firepower with the likes of Jos Buttler , Phil Salt and the rest finding some form. They have three spinners - Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid and Liam Livingstone - who can make use of spin-friendly conditions in Guyana, but the biggest England supporter would say that a curtailed game would be their best chance.Man to man, on current form, India are much superior, but if it's a shorter game, many of those things go out of the window. It becomes a bit of a shootout and with rain in the air and Messrs Duckworth, Lewis and Stern calling the shots, the toss, too becomes important.India know that they may have to deal with these variables, because that's the nature of the beast these days if it's a 365-day cricket season. Rohit and Co. will believe they are good enough for whatever comes in their way as they look to break their ICC silverware drought.It will be cloudy in Guyana on Thursday with 75% probability of rain. While forecast for match hours are slightly better, if it rains heavily before the starts, it can have an impact. With an inefficient stadium drainage system, many hours could be lost.There is no reserve day for this game. However, play can extend to 4 hours and 10 minutes to complete the game. India advance in case of a washout.Providence Stadium is a spinner's haven with low, sharp turn on offer. Spinners have conceded less than 7 runs per over here in recent times, good news for India's spin troika - Kuldeep, Axar and Jadeja. England too boast of Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid and Liam Livingstone in their ranks for this day game.In the previous WC game here, West Indies struggled to chase down PNG's 137, with the variable bounce raising eyebrows. Don't expect the ball to come on to the bat and expect the surface to play a few tricks.This is precisely what India didn't do in Adelaide last time around. If Rohit Sharma can reprise his heroics against Australia, India will be home free.On paper, England have more six-hitters in the lineup but India's middle order enforcers like Suryakumar Yadav , Rishabh Pant and Shivam Dube will worry the England attack.India have been traditionally shaky in knockout rounds. But the current England white-ball dispensation too is under pressure after the failure to defend the ODI World Cup last year.",India face England in T20 World Cup semifinal in Guyana on Thursday. Rain forecast for Guyana with 75% probability of rain. ICC has extended the cut-off time for calling the game off by four hours. India will make the final if it's a washout because they topped their Super 8 group.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111302417,imgsize-55884,width-400,resizemode-4/111302417.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India dominated South Africa to end their long global trophy drought, winning the 2024 T20 World Cup title. It was India’s second title in the tournament as they joined the West Indies and England as the multiple time T20 World Cup champions.The rich history of India’s global triumphs in both ODI and T20 formats stands as a testament to their enduring legacy in the sport.From the historic win in 1983 to the thrilling triumphs in 2007, 2011 and 2024, each title has contributed to the rich legacy of Indian cricket.India’s first major breakthrough in world cricket came in 1983 when Kapil Dev led the team to an unexpected and historic victory in the ODI World Cup held in England. Defying all odds, India defeated the mighty West Indies in the final at Lord’s. Kapil Dev’s leadership, along with memorable performances from Mohinder Amarnath, and the all-round efforts of the team, played a crucial role in this triumph. This victory marked the beginning of India’s rise as a cricketing powerhouse.In the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy held in Sri Lanka, India emerged as joint winners alongside Sri Lanka after rain disrupted both the initial final and the subsequent reserve day. Led by Sourav Ganguly, India showcased a strong performance throughout the tournament, highlighted by exceptional batting displays from Virender Sehwag and Rahul Dravid, and crucial contributions from their bowlers. The final saw India in a competitive position before rain intervened, preventing the completion of the match.The 2007 T20 World Cup in South Africa saw India clinch the title in the inaugural edition of the tournament. Under the dynamic leadership of MS Dhoni , a young Indian team, filled with fresh talent and fearless approach, won the hearts of fans worldwide.

GEORGETOWN: The wait kept getting longer. The world's eyes were on the weather radar and as the clouds seemed to keep moving away, the smiles were back on the faces of the fans who have been trooping into Guyana from across the United States and other parts of the world. The toss got delayed, the super-soppers were on, but nothing mattered more than the hot sun that was burning in full glory after morning showers.But as the teams got on to the field and started to prepare themselves for a long day, quite a few questions about how the tournament has been scheduled surfaced.To start with, there is no reserve day between games in the knock-out stage, which is beyond belief for anybody who is associated with cricket in this part of the world. To compensate for that, the rule of the tournament was amended at the 11th hour, with two days to go for the match, allowing four hours of extra time.Pakistan, who had been knocked out in Lauderdale because their game could not be started despite a hot sun blazing through the day, are justified to ask a few questions after rules got amended before the semis.While that's one issue, the fact that India knew way before the World Cup started that their semifinal would be played in Guyana has also come up for discussion. India captain Rohit Sharma tried to shut it down saying that ""it's the same for all teams"" and that ""England have enough experience of playing in these conditions"", the theory that India got a bit of unfair advantage cannot be disputed.Former England captain Michael Vaughan didn't mince his words when he said that the T20 World Cup is ""purely set up for India"" and ICC should have been a bit more ""fairer"" to other countries because this is not a bilateral event.""Well, it's their tournament isn't it? Literally it's that. You know that. They get to play whenever they want, they know where their semifinal is, they play every single game in the morning so people can watch them at night, obviously in India on TV,"" Vaughan said during a podcast with Australian great Adam Gilchrist on the YouTube channel Club Prairie Fire.The Ashes-winning captain feels it is purely the financial might of Indian cricket that has led to such a situation. ""I get that money is a big play, and I get that in bilateral series but when you get to a World Cup, the ICC should be a little bit fairer to everybody. There can't be sympathy or any kind of sway towards one team and this tournament is purely set up for India,"" Vaughan said.","Former England captain Michael Vaughan says T20 World Cup is ""purely set up for India"" ICC should have been a bit more ""fairer"" to other countries because this is not a bilateral event, says Vaughan.

He went on to win three more IPL titles with CSK, including being named player of the match in the 2023 final against Gujarat Titans after hitting the winning four off the last ball.In his international career in the shortest format, Jadeja played 74 matches, scoring 515 runs and taking 54 wickets. His precision and subtle variations made him a challenging opponent for batters looking to score freely, especially in the middle overs. Throughout his T20I career, Jadeja consistently provided breakthroughs for his team at crucial moments, turning matches in India's favor with timely strikes.Apart from his bowling, Jadeja's fielding set him apart as one of the finest all-rounders of his generation, known for his lightning-fast reflexes and athletic prowess. His exceptional catches, direct hits, and game-changing run-outs will be a significant part of his T20I legacy.Jadeja's all-round abilities were further highlighted in the 2014 World T20, where his economical bowling (five wickets at an economy of 7.36) and crucial lower-order contributions helped India reach the final.The retirement of Rohit, Kohli, and Jadeja signifies the end of an era in T20Is for India, with BCCI President Roger Binny acknowledging that it would take at least two years from now for the side to settle down.","India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja announces retirement from T20 Internationals.

Arshdeep Singh is one of the most underplayed stories of India's T20 World Cup triumph, while the left-arm pacer's swing with the new ball up front and ability to bowl tight overs peppered with yorkers in the dying stages of the match have been crucial to India's success.To finish this T20 World Cup ahead of spearhead and 'Player of the Tournament' Jasprit Bumrah (15) in the wickets column speaks volumes about the evolution of Arshdeep as India's premier left-arm pacer in the white-ball format.And he couldn't have celebrated that success in a better way than by playing a key role in India winning the T20 World Cup.While Arshdeep took 17 wickets to finish as the joint-highest wicket-taker in the tournament, along with Afghanistan pacer Fazalhaq Farooqi, he once again displayed calmness in pressure situations of a World Cup final to deliver a fine spell of 2 for 20.As the families celebrated India's historic triumph in Barbados, Arshdeep's parents also joined in on the ground at the Kensington Oval; and in a heatwarming moment captured in a video, the pacer honoured them by taking off his winners' medal and making his mom and dad wear it to get clicked.India, having chosen to bat first, managed to put up a competitive total of 176 for 7, largely due to Virat Kohli's outstanding innings of 76 off 59 balls, which earned him the 'Player of the Match' award. Axar Patel's valuable contribution of 47 runs off 31 balls also played a crucial role in India's total.In response, South Africa suffered two early setbacks but managed to stage an impressive comeback through the efforts of Heinrich Klaasen (52 off 27 balls) and Quinton de Kock (39 off 31 balls). Their partnership brought the required run rate down to just one run per ball.However, Hardik Pandya's timely intervention, dismissing the dangerous Klaasen, helped India regain control of the match. 'Player of the Tournament' Jasprit Bumrah's exceptional 18th over, in which he conceded only two runs and picked up a wicket, further tilted the balance in India's favour.Arshdeep then bowled the penultimate over and kept the pressure on the Proteas by giving away just four runs.The defining moment of the match came at the start of the 20th over when Suryakumar Yadav took a spectacular catch at the boundary off Pandya's bowling. Pandya's impressive figures of 3 for 20 were the best on the bowling chart as South Africa's chase fell short, finishing at 169 for 8, securing a thrilling victory for India.",Arshdeep Singh is one of the most underplayed stories of India's T20 World Cup triumph.

Timely departure of big guns gives space to groom players for 2026 World Cup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/timely-departure-of-big-guns-gives-space-to-groom-players-for-2026-world-cup/articleshow/111385255.cms,"NEW DELHI: The retirement of Virat Kohli , Rohit Sharma , and Ravindra Jadeja from T20 cricket signifies the conclusion of a remarkable chapter in Indian cricket history. However, their decision to step away at this juncture is well-timed, as it provides the selectors and incoming team management with ample opportunity to strategize for the upcoming World Cup, set to take place in India in 2026.Jadeja's announcement came as no surprise, following closely on the heels of Rohit and Kohli's decision to bid farewell to the T20 format, just a day after the team's triumphant World Cup victory.Filling the void left by these three exceptional players in the starting lineup will undoubtedly require time and effort. Nevertheless, the transition process is set to commence as early as the following week, when a second-string Indian squad will face off against Zimbabwe in a series of five T20Is, beginning on July 6.During this well-deserved break, Hardik Pandya , who has been given a rest from the series, is anticipated to take over the reins as the T20I captain from Rohit. He will be closely monitoring the progress and performance of the fringe players during this period.“The 2026 T20 World Cup is a long time away. Very happy for Rohit and Virat. Two giants of Indian cricket who thoroughly deserved this,” said Hardik after holding his nerve with the ball in the final over on Saturday against South Africa.The Indian cricket team faces the challenge of filling the void left by the retirement of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli in the opening slots. The squad for the Zimbabwe tour includes four openers: Yashavsi Jaiswal, a member of the World Cup winning team, Shubman Gill , Ruturaj Gaikwad, and Abhishek Sharma. It is expected that Gill and Jaiswal will be the opening pair for the first T20I in Harare on Saturday.Ravindra Jadeja's retirement positions Axar Patel as the primary spin-bowling all-rounder in the Indian team. During the World Cup, Axar demonstrated his versatility by batting in the middle-order and taking on the challenging task of bowling in the powerplay.His crucial 47 off 31 balls in the final against South Africa helped India recover from a subpar powerplay, and he delivered a man-of-the-match performance in the semi-final against England.However, Jadeja's role in the tournament was limited, as he bowled the fewest overs among the spinners and batted in the lower-order.Jadeja's retirement opens up more opportunities for the injury-prone Washington Sundar in the T20 setup. Abhishek Sharma, despite being an opener, has a better chance of establishing himself as a spin all-rounder in the middle-order, given the abundance of options at the top of the batting order.Roger Binny, the BCCI president and a member of the 1983 World Cup winning team, witnessed India's second T20 World Cup triumph at the Kensington Oval and remains optimistic about the team's future prospects.“There is so much talent in the IPL. Lot of cricketers are coming through but it is going to take some time to bridge the gap (after the retirement of Rohit and Kohli from T20Is),” Binny told PTI.“They have contributed so much. It's going to take time. We will probably see in the next two-three years, the team coming back into its own without them,” he added.","Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja retire from T20 cricket.

But, our girls bowled and fielded their hearts out,"" he added.""But, rather than focusing on what the South Africans did, we thought of having a word just before they came out. We said - 'This is what we play for when we put on the jersey'. The first two sessions would be crucial.""Jemimah Rodrigues was absent from the field following the conclusion of the morning session. Head coach Muzumdar provided an update on her condition, stating that Rodrigues experienced slight muscle cramps, and the decision to rest her was taken as a preventive measure to ensure her well-being.""She is fine. She has had some cramps since morning. So, after the opening session, we decided that she should take a rest,"" he said.Muzumdar praised the Indian men's cricket team for their triumphant victory in the T20 World Cup , where they defeated South Africa by a narrow margin of seven runs in the final match held in Barbados, securing their second title in this format.""It was a historical moment for Indian cricket.

Ravindra Jadeja: A thoroughbred who found his own course,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/ravindra-jadeja-a-thoroughbred-who-found-his-own-course/articleshow/111384032.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ravindra Jadeja recently concluded his T20I career with the World Cup, where he was often overshadowed by his more illustrious teammates. Throughout his career in white-ball formats, the spotlight tended to shine on Jasprit Bumrah and the spin duo Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal. In Tests, Ravichandran Ashwin was often seen as the lead spinner.Jadeja never publicly complained or shared cryptic social media posts about his role. Even as he concluded his T20I stint, Jadeja remained in the shadows of cricket icons like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.At 35, Jadeja's decision to retire from T20Is may have been influenced by the recognition that any announcement concurrent with Kohli and Sharma might have been overlooked. During India’s eight matches in the Americas, Jadeja's contributions were minimal, scoring 35 runs and taking one wicket across 14 overs. However, he garnered more attention during India's victory parade at Kensington Oval after their historic win over South Africa in the final.Jadeja's performance in T20Is did not reach the heights of his contributions in other formats. Over 74 T20Is, he accumulated 515 runs and took 54 wickets at an economy rate of 7.1. These statistics may seem underwhelming for someone known for his consistent bowling and batting abilities.In the recent World Cup, Axar Patel emerged as a key player for India, often filling Jadeja’s usual role by bowling more overs and batting higher in the order. This was not a reflection of the team management's view of Jadeja's abilities. Instead, Jadeja was kept in reserve as an insurance for potential top or middle-order collapses that eventually did not occur.Under coach Rahul Dravid, who concluded his tenure with the World Cup, selection metrics for the Indian side went beyond mere numbers. Dravid appreciated what Jadeja brought to the team across all formats.“If you look at the numbers, we look at stats, we look at data, we look at it quite a lot, and Jadeja has been exceptional.“Our seamers are often fantastic upfront, so, the performances of people like Jaddu and Kuldeep (Yadav) have probably gone slightly unnoticed,” Dravid had said.Jadeja struggled as a batsman during the T20Is, often coming in at No. 7, a challenging position for someone who isn't a natural hitter like Hardik Pandya.In the semifinal against England in Guyana, he demonstrated his ability to make crucial runs down the order. Jadeja scored an unbeaten 17 off 9 balls, helping India strengthen their total from 146 for six to 171 for seven, laying the groundwork for a 68-run victory.Despite Jadeja's performance, Rohit's fluent 57 off 39 balls overshadowed his contribution. Additionally, Jadeja was economical in his three overs, conceding just 16 runs, yet it was Axar who bagged the player of the match award for his three wickets for 23 runs.That match exemplified Jadeja’s typical performance—he fulfilled his role effectively, but the spotlight remained on others.“As an allrounder, my role is to make an impact in tough situations. When you need the crucial 30-40 runs or when there is a partnership going on and you need a wicket. Change the game,” he had said.Jadeja altered the game's dynamics with precise mathematical strategies and keen understanding of cricket angles. His adeptness lies in comprehending the geometric aspects of the sport. The effective application of angles and calculations distinguishes his gameplay.",Ravindra Jadeja recently concluded his T20I career with the World Cup. Jadeja's performance in T20Is did not reach the heights of his contributions in other formats. He accumulated 515 runs and took 54 wickets at an economy rate of 7.1.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111384017,imgsize-63450,width-400,resizemode-4/111384017.jpg"

Brazil Vs Paraguay: Vinicius Junior nets brace in Brazil's 4-1 Copa America victory over Paraguay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/vinicius-junior-nets-brace-in-brazils-4-1-copa-america-victory-over-paraguay/articleshow/111354745.cms,"NEW DELHI: Brazil displayed a convincing 4-1 victory over Paraguay in their second Group D match of the Copa America on Friday, with Real Madrid 's Vinicius Junior playing a pivotal role by scoring two goals. The result helped Brazil bounce back strongly from a disappointing opening performance.Vinicius, who had a subdued outing in the previous game, was a constant menace down the left flank throughout the match.His movement and trickery caused significant problems for the Paraguayan defence.His first goal, arriving in the 35th minute, exemplified Brazil's fluid attacking play. A well-worked team move culminated in Lucas Paqueta delivering a precise first-time pass to Vinicius, who calmly slotted the ball home.Brazil doubled their lead shortly after through Girona winger Savio, who reacted quickest to a rebound inside the penalty area. Vinicius then added his second and Brazil's third just before half-time, capitalizing on a defensive error by Omar Alderete .The Paraguayan defender's attempted clearance struck Vinicius's outstretched leg and deflected into the net.Paraguay showed resilience early in the second half, pulling a goal back through a spectacular long-range strike from Alderete. However, any hopes of an unlikely comeback were dashed when Lucas Paqueta atoned for an earlier penalty miss by converting a spot-kick in the 68th minute.This victory leads Brazil to second place in Group D with four points from two matches. Colombia currently lead the group with a perfect record of two wins from two, securing their place in the quarter-finals. Costa Rica, on the other hand, occupy the third spot with one point, while Paraguay sit at the bottom of the table with two losses.","Brazil beat Paraguay 4-1 in their second Group D match of the Copa America.

On the other hand, Gareca was late in bringing on a player at halftime during Chile's match against Argentina on Tuesday.CONMEBOL cited articles 104 and 145 of the tournament's regulations, which stipulate that teams must take the field on time for the scheduled start or restart of play. Failure to do so has resulted in the one-match suspension for both Scaloni and Gareca, preventing them from being present on the substitutes' bench during their respective teams' final group stage matches on Saturday.In addition to the suspensions, the Argentine and Chilean football federations have each been fined $15,000 as a consequence of their teams' tardiness.As things stand, Argentina currently top Group A with six points and have already secured their place in the quarter-finals. They will face Peru on Saturday without the presence of Scaloni on the sidelines.Meanwhile, Chile, with only one point, will take on group runners-up Canada in their final group match, also without the guidance of Gareca from the bench.While the suspensions and fines may seem harsh, they serve as a reminder to teams and coaching staff of the need to respect the established rules and schedules, ensuring the smooth and timely progression of the competition.","The South American football governing body, CONMEBOL, has taken disciplinary action against the coaches of Argentina and Chile, Lionel Scaloni and Ricardo Gareca.

The goals from Luis Diaz , Davinson Sanchez , and Jhon Cordoba ensured that Colombia finished in the top two positions in Group D.With this win, Colombia extended their unbeaten streak to 25 games, a remarkable achievement that dates back to February 2022 when they suffered a defeat against Argentina.Nestor Lorenzo's well-drilled side displayed a composed and organized performance, never allowing Costa Rica to threaten their unbeaten record.The opening goal came in the 31st minute when Liverpool's Luis Diaz converted a penalty kick with authority after Costa Rican goalkeeper Patrick Sequeira committed a reckless challenge on Jhon Cordoba near the edge of the penalty area. Diaz's powerful strike found the top corner, giving Colombia the lead.Colombia came close to doubling their advantage in the 37th minute when veteran midfielder James Rodriguez picked out Diaz at the back post with a precise cross. However, Diaz's attempted cutback across the face of the goal narrowly evaded the outstretched Davinson Sanchez.Sanchez made amends for the missed opportunity in the 59th minute, glancing in Jhon Arias's left-wing cross to extend Colombia's lead to 2-0. Three minutes later, Cordoba scored the third goal with a clinical finish, latching onto Rodriguez's incisive through ball and firing a low shot across the goalkeeper and into the far corner.With this comprehensive victory, Colombia will qualify for the quarter-finals as group winners if they can secure at least a point against Brazil in their final group game on Tuesday.

This unexpected result has given the Slovaks belief that they can overcome their higher-ranked opponent and progress further in the competition.""The English have quality, but every opponent they have played were able to torment them,"" Slovakia midfielder Ondrej Duda told TV Markíza.Slovakia's head coach, Francesco Calzona , referred to his squad as the unexpected success story of the group stage following their victory against Belgium. Meanwhile, the underdog team from Georgia also exceeded predictions by stunning Portugal with a 2-0 win, demonstrating that no team should be underestimated.Although England supporters celebrated their team's placement on the more favorable side of the tournament bracket, potentially providing a less challenging path to the final, this advantage exists only in theory.""I think everyone has seen in this competition that there is not a favourable side of the draw,"" England defender Marc Guehi told reporters on Thursday. ""Every team, every opponent, is really tough to come up against. I think we need to remain calm.""England demonstrated some progress in the latter half of their goalless draw against Slovenia on Tuesday, with Kobbie Mainoo and Cole Palmer making a positive impact as substitutes.Although England's backline was a significant worry prior to the tournament due to the absence of experienced players like Harry Maguire, it has been the strongest aspect of the team's Euro performance . Throughout the group stage, England have conceded the fewest expected goals (xG) - a metric that quantifies the quality of scoring opportunities allowed to opponents.Southgate will be hoping for an improved display from Jude Bellingham , who excelled in the first half of their 1-0 victory against Serbia but faded in the subsequent two matches.Slovakia's key player is the skillful Napoli midfielder Stanislav Lobotka , whom Italian legend Andrea Pirlo described as ""the best playmaker in the Italian league.""Calzona, who had served as an assistant throughout his career before being named Slovakia's manager in 2022, stated that his team had already achieved their primary objective of reaching Euro.
