'Wrong call': Gautam Gambhir slammed for risking Washington Sundar; reminded of 'injured' Shubman Gill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-new-zealand/gautam-gambhir-slammed-for-risking-washington-sundar-reminded-of-injured-shubman-gill/articleshow/126497172.cms,"Gautam Gambhir and Shubman Gill (AFP Photo)

Harshit Rana press conference: 'Team wants to groom me as an all-rounder'

NEW DELHI: Washington Sundar ’s decision to walk out to bat despite a visible injury during the first ODI against New Zealand in Vadodara has sparked debate around the Indian team management’s handling of injured players. Sundar was seen limping and struggling to walk but still came out to the middle when India needed support for KL Rahul in a tense chase of 301 runs.The spin-bowling all-rounder was risked despite his fitness concerns, and the move backfired as his injury worsened. Sundar remained unbeaten on 7 off 7 balls in the series opener, playing a supporting role as Rahul guided India to a four-wicket win. However, shortly after the match, Sundar was ruled out of the remainder of the series and was replaced by Ayush Badoni.Sundar’s appearance at the crease raised several questions, particularly about the Gautam Gambhir-led team management’s approach to player welfare. Among those critical of the decision was former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif , who openly questioned the logic behind sending an injured player into the middle.Kaif pointed out what he described as a double standard, drawing parallels with Shubman Gill ’s injury management during the South Africa Test series.He reminded the Indian team management that Gill was rested and not allowed to bat to prevent aggravation of his injury.""You will remember when Shubman Gill was injured, he did not come out to bat in that Test match, the Kolkata Test. It was a high-scoring game and people thought that even 20 or 30 runs from him could help India win, but he still did not bat. That was done to give full protection to the player so the injury would not aggravate. But the same approach was not applied with Sundar. That is why I feel it was a wrong call. KL Rahul's running between the wickets was affected. Even though India won the match, I feel there were higher chances of aggravating the injury in yesterday's game,"" Kaif said on his YouTube channel.Kaif further explained why sending Sundar in such a situation carried unnecessary risk.""If he is injured and you need runs at a run-a-ball, you should first try someone else. When a player is injured and you send him in under pressure, the injury can worsen. He couldn't run doubles even though the ball was going to deep point or square leg, and he was only managing singles. Although the required run rate was around a run-a-ball and the match was under control, I felt that sending an injured player was risky. What might have been a one-week or ten-day injury could stretch to 20, 25, or even 30 days,"" he added.""I believe that was a wrong call. You could have sent Kuldeep, or anyone else, even Siraj or Prasidh Krishna, if you just needed to play out the run-a-ball situation. Only when it becomes absolutely unavoidable, right at the end, should you send Washington Sundar,"" Kaif asserted.Sundar is part of India’s squad for the T20 World Cup 2026, which begins on February 7, making his fitness a key concern going forward.","Washington Sundar was seen limping and struggling to walk during the first ODI against New Zealand in Vadodara.

When wedding bells loom, most couples start with colors, venues, or guest lists. Travis Kelce, however, has zeroed in on something far more revealing. The Kansas City Chiefs star is already thinking about how people will interact once they sit down, laugh, and spend hours together. It is not about numbers or status. It is about chemistry.As his engagement to Taylor Swift continues to dominate headlines, Kelce’s comments have offered fans a rare glimpse into how seriously he approaches personal relationships. Even before venues or menus enter the picture, the focus is on creating a room that feels natural, warm, and drama free.On New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce, a casual question turned into a telling moment. When asked if members of the podcast team would make the guest list, Kelce laughed it off before delivering an unexpectedly thoughtful answer..“Bachelor party, man, how do you even know there's a bachelor party coming?” he said. He followed with, “I haven't thought about it one second. But I invite you guys everywhere.”.The tone shifted when the conversation turned to the wedding itself. Kelce explained his philosophy without hesitation.“You know, we're going to see how it all shakes out because I don't want to put them at a table that they wouldn't mesh with, so I would just probably not invite them at all if that was the case.”That mindset reflects how the couple has handled their engagement so far. Travis Kelce recently shared how meaningful it felt introducing Taylor Swift as his fiancée to teammates, calling the experience exciting and personal. “It's been really fun telling everybody who I'm going to be spending the rest of my life with,” he said. “It was my first time introducing Taylor as my fiancée to a few of my teammates. So yeah, it was pretty cool. ”From celebrating privately with loved ones to making their first engaged appearance together at Arrowhead Stadium, Kelce and Swift are shaping their next chapter with intention.

By the time Wayne Gretzky finally called it quits in 1999, he wasn’t just the greatest hockey player; he was also the most dominant sportsman in North American sports. But knowing the Great One, he wasn’t quite done with the spotlight.As soon as he retired, he decided that the legacy of most goals, most assists, most NHL points, and 58 other records wasn’t enough for him. He wanted to break some off-ice records. And he did so by 2016, as he had a net worth of $200 million. But even that pales in comparison to his net worth a decade later in 2026.2016 was a special year for Gretzky, as it was 10 years ago that he was appointed the vice-chairman and partner of the Oilers Entertainment Group. The owners of the very same franchise for whom he won four Stanley Cups.But it was his wealth that really proved that while Gretzky’s hockey IQ might be unparalleled, he was also one of the league’s savviest businessmen. Now, a decade later, it feels as if 2026 is the new 2016. And his net worth is proof of that.As per Celebrity Net Worth, Gretzky currently stands with a net worth of $250 million, a $50 million increase from a decade ago.This 25% growth proves his continued brand power.This amount also dwarfs his career earnings by a good $4 million. This again proves just how good the Great One has been with his financial decisions to nearly quadruple his career earnings over the 26 years since his retirement.During his NHL career from 1979 to 1999, Gretzky earned approximately $46 million in salary. While that's a substantial figure, it represents only a fraction of his total wealth. His peak earning years came with the New York Rangers, where he commanded $6.5 million annually.This wasn't unjust, as in his career Gretzky did some things that modern hockey fans just can't understand. This included four seasons with 200+ points. Something that only he had done and even the legendary Mario Lemieux couldn't repeat. Not to mention, the Great One also had the record for 894 career goals and still holds the all-time record for most points at 2857 points.But compared to these numbers, his earnings seem modest compared to today's mega-contracts, but Gretzky played in an era before the salary explosion that would follow. What set him apart wasn't just what he earned on the ice, but his understanding that his playing days would finance much larger opportunities.Those career earnings became the foundation upon which he built an empire worth more than five times his hockey salary alone. Soon, endorsements came for the “Great One.”Gretzky understood early that his brand could transcend hockey. During and after his playing career, he earned an estimated $50 million from endorsements, appearances, and licensing deals with powerhouse brands including Nike, Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and Upper Deck.His association with these companies wasn't just lucrative but also strategic. His decision to join the trading card giants meant that his name remains in printed media and collectibles for a long time. So while the younger generation might not remember his on-ice miracles, they will remember him in another way.But while some legends wane after retirement, Gretzky continued to be the center of brand deals, and his partnership with betting giants BetMGM once again showed his understanding of the market in this age of sports betting.Gretzky's post-retirement investment portfolio showcases remarkable diversity and timing. His real estate deals alone have been particularly profitable—he sold his family's Los Angeles estate to MLB star Lenny Dykstra for $18.5 million and later flipped a California mansion purchased for $13.5 million for $22.9 million.The journey from $200 million in 2016 to $250 million in 2026 tells a story of sustained excellence in a second career. It’s proof that the same vision and work ethic that produced 2,857 career points can build generational wealth.Wayne Gretzky didn't just change how hockey is played; he changed how hockey players think about life after the game, setting a standard for athlete entrepreneurship that endures today.","Wayne Gretzky's net worth in 2016 was $200 million.

Milwaukee Bucks vs Minnesota Timberwolves Tip-Off and Context (January 13, 2026)

The Minnesota Timberwolves travel to Milwaukee on January 13, 2026, to face the Bucks at Fiserv Forum. On paper, this game looks like a clash between two teams with playoff expectations. In reality, it is a test of who can survive with what remains of their rotation.Injuries and a suspension have stripped both sides of important contributors. With lineups shortened and roles expanded, this game is less about star power and more about execution, minutes management, and which team avoids mistakes.Minnesota Timberwolves will be without Anthony Edwards, who is sidelined due to foot injury management. His absence removes the team’s leading scorer. Rudy Gobert is also unavailable after receiving a one-game suspension for accumulated flagrant foul points.The injury list does not end there. Terrence Shannon Jr. remains out with a left foot abductor strain, while Enrique Freeman and Rob Dillingham are also unavailable. With limited options, the Timberwolves will rely heavily on Julius Randle, Naz Reid, Jaden McDaniels, and Donte DiVincenzo to carry extended minutes on both ends of the floor.Milwaukee Bucks also enters the game short-handed. Taurean Prince is out following neck surgery, though some reports describe the injury as a herniated disk. Myles Turner is listed as questionable due to illness, which could affect the Bucks’ frontcourt depth if he is unable to play.What Milwaukee does have is a healthy Giannis Antetokounmpo, who remains the focal point of the offense. He will be supported by Kevin Porter Jr. and Ryan Rollins, both of whom have taken on larger roles this season.Randle is averaging 21.1 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 5.4 assists, while Reid adds 16.0 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 2.8 three-pointers per game. Minnesota also loses Gobert’s 11.4 rebounds per night.For the Milwaukee Bucks, Antetokounmpo is posting 29 points, 9 rebounds, and 5.7 assists. Porter Jr. averages 17.7 points, 7.6 assists, and 2.2 steals, while Rollins contributes 14.8 points and 2.3 made threes. Turner, if available, brings 11.8 points and 1.4 blocks.The game tips off at 8 p.m. ET (7 p.m. CT) on Tuesday. It will air on FanDuel Sports Network, TNT, NBA League Pass, and Fubo.Minnesota enters around 26-14, built on defense but missing key pieces. Milwaukee sits near 17-23 and leans heavily on Giannis. With rotations thin on both sides, this game is likely decided by which supporting cast holds up longer.","Minnesota Timberwolves will be without Anthony Edwards, who is sidelined due to foot injury management.

Mike Tomlin daughter Harley Tomlin shines beyond the NFL spotlight



Mike Tomlin’s daughter Harley Tomlin stepped into the national conversation as news of the Steelers icon walking away reshaped both football and family focus. The unexpected shift sent ripples through Pittsburgh, but it also pulled fresh attention toward a young athlete building her own name far from the NFL sidelines. The timing felt poetic. As one chapter closed after nearly two decades of leadership, another gained momentum under bright arena lights. Harley Tomlin, already climbing within college gymnastics, suddenly found her journey intersecting with a historic moment in pro football.A late and unexpected vacancy has spun the NFL's offseason coaching carousel into overdrive. Mike Tomlin is stepping down from the Pittsburgh Steelers after a 19-year run leading the storied organization, the team announced Tuesday. Steelers president Art Rooney II confirmed the decision, sharing Tomlin’s words after the Wild Card loss to Houston.""During our meeting today, coach Tomlin informed me that he has decided to step down as our head coach,"" Steelers President Art Rooney II said in a statement. ""Obviously, I am extremely grateful to Mike for all the hard work, dedication and success we shared over the last 19 years. It is hard for me to put into words the level of respect and appreciate I have for coach Tomlin.He guided the franchise to our sixth Super Bowl championship and made the playoffs 13 times during his tenure, including winning the AFC North eight times in his career. His track record of never having a losing season in 19 years will likely never be duplicated.”With more time suddenly available, Tomlin’s role as a proud father has come into sharper focus. His sons, Dino and Mason, carved their own football paths, but Harley has long held a special place in his heart. ""Even my boys know that Harley is my favorite. #GirlDad"" -- Tomlin tweeted in 2020.Harley’s gymnastics roots run deep. Her mother Kiya, a former collegiate gymnast, passed along both technique and toughness. Now a sophomore at Georgia, Harley is thriving. She helped the GymDogs defeat No. 21 Ohio State, opening lineups with confidence and posting a career high 9.875 on the beam. Her earlier debut told the same story. Big stage. Calm execution.Tomlin once called her the “best athlete in the house no doubt”, praise that feels earned rather than sentimental. With Georgia set for seven nationally televised meets this season, Harley Tomlin is not borrowing attention from her last name. She is commanding it, one composed routine at a time.Also Read: Drake Maye’s wife Ann Michael sparks curiosity with ‘baby steps’ post that quietly grabs fans’ attention",Mike Tomlin is stepping down from the Pittsburgh Steelers after a 19-year run leading the storied organization.

Drake Maye wife Ann Michael draws attention with subtle TikTok moment

Drake Maye's wife Ann Michael has quietly become one of the most talked about figures in New England, sharing the spotlight with the Patriots quarterback during a remarkable season. As Drake Maye continues to command national attention with his calm control and sharp decision making, fans have also turned their eyes toward the woman who has stood beside him since childhood. Her presence adds a personal layer to a year already filled with momentum and belief.The Patriots did not reach a 14-3 finish by accident. Maye’s leap in his second season reshaped expectations and pushed the franchise back into the AFC title conversation. Yet behind the wins and headlines sits a story rooted in patience, loyalty, and shared growth. Ann Michael Maye has been part of Drake’s journey since they were 12 years old. Their bond began long before sold out stadiums, draft buzz, or playoff pressure entered the picture.Ann Michael Maye has built her own following through TikTok, where fans often see her baking, preparing for game days, and sharing quiet slices of life.Her latest post, released on January 13, sparked curiosity for its soundtrack choice. She paired her full game day routine with Olivia Dean’s song “Baby Steps,” a detail that did not go unnoticed by a fan base always reading between the lines.The meaning remains open. Some viewers saw it as a gentle nod to progress, a reminder that even Super Bowl runs happen one step at a time. Others believe it was simply a song she enjoys. Neither Drake nor Ann Michael has hinted publicly about expanding their family, despite natural speculation given their long history and recent marriage in the summer of 2025. The post felt personal, not performative, which only deepened the intrigue.What is not subtle is the support they show each other. After the Patriots’ January 11 win over the Los Angeles Chargers, Drake made sure to acknowledge his wife while speaking to reporters. “And obviously Ann Michael, can't forget about her,” Drake said with a smile on his face while telling reporters about his family's attendance at the game.In a season defined by growth and belief, the Mayes continue to move forward together. Sometimes, as Ann Michael’s post suggests, progress really does come in baby steps.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers retirement: Steelers playoff collapse raises serious questions as veteran QB dodges direct answers about what comes next","Drake Maye's wife Ann Michael has quietly become one of the most talked about figures in New England.

Why was Jordan Addison arrested? Details emerge after the Vikings star’s Tampa incident that could impact his NFL future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-was-jordan-addison-arrested-details-emerge-after-the-vikings-stars-tampa-incident-that-could-impact-his-nfl-future/articleshow/126515145.cms,"Jordan Addison was arrested Monday in Tampa, Florida, on a trespassing charge and later released on a $500 bond. His agent says Addison will fight the case and expects exoneration. The incident raises concern for the Vikings after Addison previously served a three game suspension stemming from a DUI before the 2024 season.

Legal response and growing stakes for the Vikings

Trouble has a way of following talented players when momentum matters most. Jordan Addison, one of the Minnesota Vikings’ most promising young receivers, is again facing unwanted headlines during a critical offseason stretch. This time, the issue unfolded far from the football field, raising fresh questions about judgment, accountability, and timing.According to police records, Addison was arrested Monday in Tampa, Florida, on a trespassing charge. Authorities booked him, took a mugshot, and later released him after he posted a $500 bond. While the legal process is still in its early stages, the situation immediately drew attention because of Addison’s recent history and the potential ripple effects for both player and team.Addison’s camp moved quickly to push back. His agent, Timothy Younger, addressed the situation publicly, signaling a firm legal stance. “He looks forward to the legal process and upon full investigation, we are confident Mr. Addison will be exonerated,” the statement said. Younger also noted that Addison’s legal team is gathering witnesses and evaluating whether a false arrest claim is appropriate.This latest arrest carries extra weight because it follows an earlier incident.Addison was charged with a DUI before the 2024 season, a case that resulted in a three game suspension to open the 2025 campaign. For the Vikings, the concern is no longer isolated behavior but a developing pattern that could invite further league scrutiny.On the field, Addison’s value remains clear. He caught 42 passes for 610 yards and three touchdowns last season, production that came despite unstable quarterback play in Minnesota. Coaches and fans alike see him as a core piece of the offense, someone expected to grow into a larger role.Now, that progress feels paused. The Vikings have to consider trust and dependability as well as talent even though the legal issue is solved on his behalf. To Addison, the future of his career is beyond football abilities. It is a matter of demonstrating that learning is not forgotten and all the more when the prospect and demands continue to grow.","Jordan Addison was arrested Monday in Tampa, Florida, on a trespassing charge.

Anthony Davis gets a major injury update



Anthony Davis trade speculation intensifies



There has been a new development surrounding Anthony Davis ’ injury update. Trade chatter around Davis surged again this week as new injury details extended the speculation about how teams view his availability and value. Reports out of Dallas suggested a clearer recovery window for the Mavericks star, opening the door to renewed conversations ahead of the February 6 trade deadline.The timing of all rumors surrounding the trade aligned perfectly with AD’s consistent injuries. Davis remains sidelined with ligament damage in his left hand, yet league insiders now see a path that keeps both Dallas and rival front offices engaged rather than resigned.The sudden shift triggered a swift and public response from Davis. As speculation spread across platforms, the 32-year-old also fired back. He challenged the accuracy of circulating timelines and assumptions.ESPN’s Shams Charania reported that Anthony Davis will not need immediate surgery and is expected to miss at least six weeks before a re-evaluation. That update softened earlier fears of a season-ending absence and aligned with Marc Stein’s reporting that there is internal belief Davis could return around March.Stein wrote, “There is some optimism in Dallas that Anthony Davis could return at some point in March, even if he is forced to undergo surgery on his left hand. ”Charania also framed how rival teams interpret that window. “These are teams that feel like, ‘OK, maybe Anthony Davis has a chance to return during the playoffs’ and also could have a long-term future with said team for the next two to four years,” he said on ESPN’s NBA Today. The injury occurred late against Utah while Davis defended Lauri Markkanen, yet he finished with 21 points and 11 rebounds, reflecting how effective he remains when available.As trade noise grew louder, Davis addressed the rumors directly on X. “Y’all better stop listening to all these lies on these apps!” The message appears to be aimed at days of conflicting reports and signaled his intent to control the narrative around his recovery.Dallas continues to evaluate options without urgency. Davis has played 29 regular-season games for the franchise and remains under contract with significant salary commitments ahead, including a $62.7 million player option. He is also eligible for a major extension this summer.League interest has not faded. Charania noted on X, “The Mavericks are having renewed Davis trade talks with multiple interested teams,” pointing to a market that still believes in his impact if he returns in time for meaningful games. For now, Dallas gathers medical clarity, and Davis focuses on rehab.Also Read: ""Stop listening to lies"": Anthony Davis responds after reports suggest hand surgery could impact his season",Anthony Davis is expected to miss at least six weeks with ligament damage in his left hand.

Candace Owens recounts vivid dreams that point to betrayal around Charlie Kirk





Candace Owens publicly described a series of vivid dreams involving Charlie Kirk . The story, which was posted on fresh doubts about old partnerships and domestic divisions, created a heated debate within the political and social media sphere. What is most exceptional about it is not the statement alone, but the emotional clarity of the way Owens describes the experience.Owens did not make it symbolic or metaphorical but portrayed the dreams as recurring, particular, and disturbing. They, according to her, had a message, which she could not hear at first. The narrative grew in public attention following the revelation pointed out by commentator Keith Woods, and the story rekindled discussion on the concept of trust, loyalty and silence on the influential political networks.Candace Owens explained that in the dream, Kirk appeared urgent and distressed. She recalled him saying, ""Charlie said to me, I don't have much time."" He then insisted she needed to understand what had happened, adding that ""they betrayed me multiple people.""Each time she tried to ask who was responsible, the moment slipped away, her voice failing as if she were waking mid sentence. She described his words sounding distant, almost muffled, leaving her frustrated and shaken.Weeks later, the dream returned with startling clarity. Owens said one face finally came through clearly. “It wasn't until the third week after his death that finally one face came through this dream. It came through as clear as day around the corner of the restaurant and it was Andrew Colbett,” she said.Owens shared the exact message she sent Colbett afterward, explaining the weight she felt compelled to act on. ""I rarely have vivid dreams, but I had one clear as day this weekend. Charlie came to me and he sat down and he told me that he did not have much time that I needed to know that he was in fact betrayed and that they are hiding what happened to my left. I believe his soul is in purgatory and I believe that you know much more than you've said publicly or privately. ""Owens said Colbett never responded. The silence, she implied, only deepened the unease surrounding an already haunting experience.Also Read: Candace Owens opens up about personal struggle after podcast intro plan hits licensing wall","Candace Owens shared a disturbing account of recurring dreams in which Charlie Kirk appeared urgently, claiming he had been betrayed.

Cole Ragans Performance Snapshot

Who Comes Out Ahead

The Boston Red Sox and Kansas City Royals are at the center of a growing trade rumor that has drawn attention across MLB circles. The idea is simple but significant: a straight swap sending Jarren Duran to Kansas City in exchange for left-handed pitcher Cole Ragans.Both teams are trying to solve clear problems. Boston needs another reliable arm at the top of its rotation. Kansas City needs a dependable everyday outfielder who can impact games on the bases and at the plate. This proposed deal addresses both without involving prospects or complex contracts.The trade would be a one-for-one exchange. Boston sends Duran, who is arbitration-eligible and under team control through 2028. Kansas City sends Ragans, also controlled through 2028, with a salary path that stays manageable and peaks at $7.5 million in 2027. From a financial standpoint, the move fits both clubs. Boston adds pitching without tax concerns, while Kansas City gains a controllable position player without long-term risk.For the Boston Red Sox, the appeal is rotation stability. Ragans has shown frontline ability when healthy and would slot in behind Garrett Crochet and Sonny Gray.His strikeout rate stands out, even in a shortened 2025 season affected by injury. Trading Duran also helps Boston manage an outfield logjam, with younger options like Ceddanne Rafaela already in place and Roman Anthony nearing readiness.The concern is durability. Ragans dealt with rotator cuff and groin issues in 2025, which lowers the margin for error in a division as demanding as the AL East.The Kansas City Royals get a clear everyday center fielder. Duran brings speed, power, and flexibility in the lineup, and his presence would help lengthen the order around Bobby Witt Jr. Kansas City avoids sacrificing prospects and fills a long-standing outfield need.The downside is obvious. Ragans has shown the ability to miss bats at an elite level, and moving that kind of arm always carries long-term risk, especially for a team building around sustained contention.Duran is a left-handed hitter with top-end speed and average center-field defense. He was born September 5, 1996, stands 6’1”, weighs 205 lbs, and was the 2024 All-Star Game MVP.Ragans struck out 223 batters in 2024 and posted a 14.4 K/9 with a 2.50 FIP in limited 2025 action. He remains under team control through 2028.Also read: MLB Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Dodgers emerge as lone Big-Money Suitor for $300 million AL hits leader prior free agency If Ragans stays healthy, Boston likely gains more long-term value by strengthening its rotation.

Who is Sam Beal and why his disappearance is drawing attention now

Sam Beal’s NFL career and life after football

Former New York Giants defensive back Sam Beal has been missing for nearly seven months, according to his sister, who has now publicly asked for help in locating him. The case is now gaining attention after family members shared details of his disappearance and urged anyone with information to contact authorities. While officials continue to investigate, much about Beal’s whereabouts remains unknown and no official updates have been provided by law enforcement beyond confirming that he is now listed as a missing person.Sam Beal, 29, is a former NFL cornerback who was once part of the New York Giants organization. His disappearance has gained public attention largely because of his past as a professional football player and because his sister has recently spoken out about how long he has been missing.According to his family, it has been approximately seven months since they last heard from him. The public appeal marks the first time many outside his immediate circle have learned about the situation.According to Beal’s sister, Sam was last seen in July 2025. She has said that he dropped off his girlfriend and borrowed her car, telling her he was heading toward Virginia Beach, Virginia. He never returned and contact with him stopped shortly afterward.The vehicle was later found in Virginia Beach reportedly containing his shoes and socks, but Beal himself was not located. His sister has described the lack of information since then as devastating for the family saying they have had no communication from him for months.All known details about his last movements come from family statements and publicly reported information.Beal played college football at Western Michigan before entering the NFL. He was selected by the New York Giants in the 2018 supplemental draft and spent time with the team over the following seasons.His professional football career was relatively brief and he largely stayed out of the public spotlight after stepping away from the NFL. Since leaving football, Beal did not maintain a high-profile presence which has contributed to the limited public information available about his life in recent years.Law enforcement agencies are aware of Beal’s disappearance and his case is listed in the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System. Authorities have not publicly shared many details about the investigation, nor have they indicated whether foul play is suspected.There has been no official update on leads or developments and police have not released a timeline beyond confirming when Beal was last reported missing. As of now, the case remains open.Also read - Cardi B responds to Offset blackmail involving Stefon Diggs, released by Celina Powell","Former New York Giants defensive back Sam Beal has been missing for nearly seven months, according to his sister.

Ravens head coach search: AFC North rival emerges as surprise favorite to replace John Harbaugh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/ravens-head-coach-search-afc-north-rival-emerges-as-surprise-favorite-to-replace-john-harbaugh/articleshow/126511138.cms,"Image via IMAGN

Why Kevin Stefanski is suddenly in the mix

A bold but calculated move

Also Read:

The Baltimore Ravens are officially in unfamiliar territory. After moving on from long-time head coach John Harbaugh, Baltimore has begun a high-stakes search for its next leader and a surprising name from within the AFC North is now emerging as a serious favorite. According to ESPN Insider , former Cleveland Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski is gaining strong traction inside league circles as a potential replacement. The idea of a division rival stepping into the Ravens’ locker room may seem bold, but the logic behind it is becoming increasingly clear.Stefanski’s resume quietly checks many of the boxes Baltimore is prioritising. During his time in Cleveland, he was widely respected as a calm, detail-oriented leader with a strong offensive background. While his Browns tenure had mixed results, many around the league believe he was limited more by instability at quarterback than by coaching ability.That context matters because in Baltimore, Stefanski would inherit one of the NFL’s most dynamic players in Lamar Jackson.Unlike his time in Cleveland, where Stefanski cycled through multiple starting quarterbacks, the Ravens job offers something rare: a true franchise QB in his prime.League executives believe the chance to build an offense fully around Jackson’s strengths could be extremely appealing to the former Browns coach.Another factor working in Stefanski’s favor is familiarity. He has faced Baltimore twice a season for several years and understands the Ravens’ roster, culture, and defensive identity. That inside knowledge could allow for a faster transition, something ownership may value after an unexpected coaching change.Baltimore is also viewed as one of the most attractive openings on the market. The roster remains playoff-ready, the front office is stable, and expectations are clear: compete for a Super Bowl immediately.Hiring a former AFC North rival would certainly raise eyebrows among fans. But the Ravens have never been afraid of bold decisions when they believe the football logic makes sense. Stefanski is known as a steady presence, not a headline-chasing hire, a trait that may appeal to a franchise built on consistency.There are still other candidates expected to receive interviews, and no final decision has been made. But as the coaching carousel spins, Stefanski’s name continues to surface more frequently in league conversations.For now, Baltimore’s search remains open but one thing is clear. The Ravens are thinking creatively, and the next head coach may come from a place few expected.","Former Cleveland Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski is being considered as a potential replacement for John Harbaugh.

The Canucks faced a massive 5-0 loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs tonight. Despite Vancouver outshooting Toronto, the Canucks were unable to defend efficiently against the Maple Leafs' offensive onslaught.As per Sekeres and Price, trade talks have elevated after the embarrassing loss, and at this point, the Canucks are listening to offers on just about every player.According to reports, the Canucks were given numerous opportunities to score during the first period, as the Maple Leafs took four different penalties. However, things went topsy-turvy for the Canucks, as their power play went 0-for-4 during the first period despite putting up their best chances while playing at 4-on-3.Due to the inconsistent performance and repeated defeat, trade talk around the Canucks has reportedly heated up. In the wake of this incident, NHL insider Darren Dreger revealed that Vancouver’s management is open to exploring offers for nearly every player.Let’s take a look at the trade rumor of the Canucks and the players in detail. The Vancouver Canucks faced a huge 5‑0 loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs this past weekend, which extended the Canucks’ losing streak to six games. In the wake of the defeat, trade talk around the Canucks has reportedly heated up, and they are planning to trade almost all players.On this week’s Sekeres & Price podcast, NHL insider Darren Dreger revealed that Vancouver’s management is open to exploring offers for nearly every player. In the podcast, Dreger stated, “I know that trade talk around certain individuals with the Vancouver Canucks has elevated of late, and maybe that's coming off the weekend loss in Toronto, and they're getting set for the Montreal Canadiens here.”He further stated, “That's not what the Canucks are trying to do here. So use any 'r' word you want: renovate, retool, rejig, whatever. It doesn't matter, but they're moving pieces. For sure, they are… And I think, for the most part, Alvin and Jimmy Rutherford are open to any communication about just about any player.”Speculations suggest that the potential trade targets include veteran defenseman Tyler Myers, with a $3 million cap hit and one year left. Another player includes a forward like Jake DeBrusk, and others such as Evander Kane.Meanwhile, on the ice, the Canucks also suffered a 6‑3 loss to the Montreal Canadiens on Monday. They are currently sitting at the bottom of the NHL standings with a 16‑24‑5 record and 37 points, extending their losing streak to seven games following their humiliating blowout by Toronto.","The Vancouver Canucks are open to trade inquiries for almost any player, according to NHL insider Darren Dreger.

The Washington Capitals are once again facing the problem of injuries, as Justin Sourdif's presence or absence is the main issue to discuss before their duel against the Montreal Canadiens. As changes in the lineup are about to happen and the fight for the playoffs is still on, the team from Washington is compelled to modify its plans again; thus, the condition of Sourdif is a pressing issue for the coach and the fans alike.The Sourdif injury is an issue that the Capitals have to face, and it is quite serious, especially with the Canadiens coming to Capital One Arena. The situation is changing dynamically, and the Capitals are careful, realizing that short-term injuries can develop into long-term ones very quickly during a congested schedule.Capitals head coach Spencer Carbery has announced that Justin Sourdif is day-to-day and that he will be absent after suffering an upper-body injury during his encounter with the Nashville Predators. The incident took place in the second period when a puck that had been deflected hit Sourdif in the face during a forecheck, thus sending him to leave the game prematurely. He was on the ice for a very short time and did not come back as Washington lost 3-2.Sourdif's absence presents a bad scenario as he has been one of the key contributors among Washington's forwards recently. The 23-year-old has accumulated 10 points in his last seven games and is having a breakout year in his first full NHL season. After playing 45 games, he has scored nine goals and made ten assists, besides being a major contributor defensively, as is shown by his +15 rating.Connor McMichael is likely to move to center with Sourdif being out, and Sonny Milano will come back to the team. If the injury lasts longer than expected, then a call-up is still an option. On the other hand, Jakob Chychrun is a decision of the day because of sickness, while Tom Wilson is still out, but Carbery said he is “getting closer” to coming back.The Capitals have to depend on their flexibility and depth to remain competitive as injuries keep piling up. The situation of Sourdif will be watched closely, as his coming back could give a timely boost to Washington’s fight to stay in the Eastern Conference.Also Read: Detroit Red Wings retire Sergei Fedorov’s iconic No. 91 jersey, closing a long‑awaited chapter","Justin Sourdif suffered an upper-body injury against the Nashville Predators.

How will Erik Karlsson’s two-week absence affect Pittsburgh Penguins’ defense?

Which players were called up or sent down as injuries impact multiple NHL teams?

The Pittsburgh Penguins have put Erik Karlsson on the injured reserve list due to a lower-body injury, and he will not be activated until two weeks later, creating a huge void in the defense. Such a situation is being experienced by the Penguins as they are going through the phase of injuries to star players, just like the Tampa Bay Lightning and Seattle Kraken.Aside from Karlsson, there are other players experiencing roster changes due to injuries or personal issues. The AHL has sent Ryan Graves and Tristan Broz to support Pittsburgh, while in Tampa Bay, Brayden Point sustained a lower-body injury while scoring, and Chandler Stephenson from Seattle has finished his personal leave. These shifts have consequences for team rotations and strategies just before the Olympic break.Erik Karlsson, the veteran defenseman, who has achieved four goals and 29 assists, thus totaling 33 points, in 44 games, is going to be out for a minimum of two weeks because of a lower-body injury. He spent more than 23 minutes on the ice during Pittsburgh's last game against Boston, then he left the rink. The Penguins can not afford to lose Karlsson right now since it will be the turning point of the season, so they have to change the patterns of their defense and use their remaining defenders more while passing through the tough schedule that leads up to the Olympic break.Ryan Graves and Tristan Broz have been called up from the AHL to join the Pittsburgh lineup to support their defense and the center positions. On the other hand, Rafael Harvey-Pinard was demoted to the minors after not being included in the active player pool for recent games. In Tampa Bay, Brayden Point got a lower-body injury after scoring and had to leave Philadelphia. His recovery will be under careful observation. For Seattle, Chandler Stephenson came back from personal leave, while Oscar Fisker Mølgaard was sent down to the AHL.Erik Karlsson’s injury is bad luck for the Penguins, but bringing back Graves and Broz reveals the team’s ability to cope with difficult situations. The next few weeks of the Penguins’ performance will be monitored with great interest, and each game will be important to stay in the standings race.Also Read: Detroit Red Wings retire Sergei Fedorov’s iconic No. 91 jersey, closing a long‑awaited chapter","Pittsburgh Penguins have put Erik Karlsson on the injured reserve list due to a lower-body injury.

What problems did NHL find during Milan Olympic hockey test run?

Milan’s beleaguered Olympic hockey arena gets 1st test

The NHL, the Milan Winter Olympics, the Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena, and the Olympic hockey preparations have all become topics of interest after NHL officials, including Commissioner Gary Bettman, inspected the site during its first test events. With NHL players getting ready for their Olympics return, the league is very interested in monitoring the ice quality, construction progress, and player safety in Milan. It was a critical checkpoint ahead of the international competition that representatives from the NHL and the NHL Players’ Association (NHLPA) were on site to make the evaluation.At the time of the arena’s first obligatory test run, Santagiulia hosted Italian Cup games as part of its pre-Olympic preparations, and that is where the worry started. The organizers conceded that the venue would not be entirely ready before the onset of the women’s tournament, although the officials were confident that the ice surface would be fit for play. That guarantee was quickly put to the test as some of the visible problems arose during competitive play.As per ESPN, the executives of the NHL and NHLPA were present at the observation of seven Italian Cup games during the period of January 9 to 11.These games included the semifinals and finals. Officials categorized the occurrence as a ""good trial run,"" yet the worries came up right after that. Right before that particular game, a pit in the ice layer had appeared and had to be mended before the start of the game. The league accepted that such situations might happen with fresh ice, especially in the case of venues that are still being constructed.Later on, Commissioner Gary Bettman mentioned that these difficulties were anticipated given the conditions, and he added that the local organizers have assured the league that all the remaining work will be done on time. In support of those efforts, the NHL has provided ice specialists who are going to be based in Milan for the purpose of assisting with preparation. IIHF President Luc Tardif has also shown his faith and said that ice quality and player safety are the main concerns.Concerns are still there due to the ice not being ready, also locker rooms not being finished, seating capacity being reduced, and the rink not meeting NHL size standards. The inspection will go on.With Olympic hockey piling up, the NHL’s attention on Santagiulia is a reflection of how much it is for the world’s best players to be in perfect conditions.Also Read: Detroit Red Wings retire Sergei Fedorov’s iconic No. 91 jersey, closing a long‑awaited chapter","NHL officials, including Commissioner Gary Bettman, inspected the site during its first test events.

Jon Cooper remains the greatest coach for Tampa Bay Lightning with recent milestone

Also Read:

Jon Cooper etched his name further into NHL history Monday night when the Tampa Bay Lightning defeated the Philadelphia Flyers 5-1, giving the veteran coach his 600th career victory. The milestone came in Cooper's 1,005th game behind the bench, making him the second-fastest coach to reach 600 wins in league history.Only Hockey Hall of Famer Scotty Bowman reached the mark faster, accomplishing the feat in 1,002 games with the St. Louis Blues and Montreal Canadiens. Cooper becomes the 25th coach in NHL history to hit the 600-win plateau, joining an elite group that includes only three other active coaches above that threshold.Every single one of Cooper's 600 victories has come with Tampa Bay, a remarkable display of longevity and sustained success with one organization. The 58-year-old Prince George, British Columbia, native was hired as Lightning head coach in March 2013 after Guy Boucher was fired and has built a dynasty in Florida.His winning percentage has been a testament to his strategic mind, as in the 1005 games that the Lightning played under him, they've lost just 319 games.Not to mention, he also led the franchise to back-to-back Stanley Cups in 2020 and 2021 while also making it to the finals twice more in 2015 and 2022.He transformed the side from a mid-table team to a constant playoff contender and raised the competition in the Atlantic Division. However, what really makes his time in Tampa special is how long he has managed to remain the head coach.In an era where your average tenure as a coach lasts barely 2.5 years, he's been leading the Lightning for the past 12 seasons. In those 12 years, he's missed the playoffs just once. His recent victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on Monday just proved why.Brandon Hagel, Jake Guentzel, and Nikita Kucherov each recorded a goal and an assist in Monday's victory, helping the Lightning extend their winning streak to 10 games. The win keeps Tampa Bay second in the Atlantic Division with a 28-13-3 record.Cooper's coaching excellence extends beyond the NHL. He won the Calder Cup with the Norfolk Admirals in 2012 and recently guided Team Canada to victory at the 4 Nations Face-Off. He will serve as head coach for Canada at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan.Despite his remarkable success, Cooper has never won the Jack Adams Trophy as coach of the year, having been a finalist twice. The milestone victory came during his 1,000th game week with the Lightning, cementing his status as one of the greatest coaches in franchise history.","Jon Cooper became the second-fastest coach in NHL history to reach 600 wins.

This year’s NHL scoring race has been one of the most thrilling years. Gone are the days when Connor McDavid single-handedly dominated the charts. This year, his Canadian teammate and Avalanche star Nathan Mackinnon has also entered the discussion.The two veterans are separated by just one point, with Mackinnon (81) currently holding the lead over McDavid (80). Meanwhile, rookie sensation Macklin Celebrini has also impressed the critics this season as he tries to break his way into the claim for the Art Ross Trophy.MacKinnon has picked up right where he left off after winning the Hart Trophy in 2023-24. With 81 points (36 Goals, 41 Assists) across 45 games this season, he has been in sensational form. His two-way play has even helped the Avs maintain a 33-4-8 record as they sit atop the Central Division.He rarely experiences extended slumps and maintains production even when the Avalanche struggles as a team. That reliability has helped him build a slim lead in the scoring race. However, that doesn’t mean he has an undisputed claim to the Art Ross Trophy.McDavid sits just one point behind MacKinnon with 80 points through the same number of games.The Edmonton Oilers captain remains on pace for another remarkable season despite the razor-thin margin.The 29-year-old continues rewriting the record books with his otherworldly offensive production. McDavid has won the Art Ross Trophy five times in his career and appears destined to challenge for a sixth scoring title this season.His ability to create offense from seemingly nothing separates McDavid from every other player in the league. The generational talent routinely makes plays that leave opponents and fans alike shaking their heads in disbelief. But just behind Mackinnon and McDavid is a name no one expected.Macklin Celebrini remains the most shocking member of this three-man race. Trailing considerably behind the two former MVP winners, the 19-year-old has scored 70 points through the first half of the season. He remains the sole driving force behind the Sharks this season.With the youngster already making his way to the Team Canada roster, the fans remain thrilled about just how far he can push. Many even believe that if by any miracle San Jose does make the playoffs, Celebrini poses the best argument for the Hart Trophy.While other veterans like Nikita Kucherov (67) and McDavid’s linemate Leon Draisaitl (64) are also in the top five, most experts believe that the race will be limited to the first two men.

Why India need leader Shreyas Iyer for 2027 World Cup | Greenstone Lobo prediction

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma continue to play an active role in India’s long-term plans for the ODI team, including preparations for next year’s World Cup, batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said on Tuesday.Kotak said both batters, who remain central to India’s 50-over batting line-up, are fully aligned with the team management, including head coach Gautam Gambhir ""They definitely make plans. Now that they're playing only one format, they want India to win everywhere when they are there,"" Kotak said on the eve of India’s second ODI against New Zealand.""With the amount of experience they have, they can share a lot of ideas with other players, and they do discuss. They discuss with Gautam the ODI format, the matches that we have and our plans for South Africa.""Kotak added: ""Most of the time I'm there and if I'm listening, they definitely share the experience and I always see them talking. Obviously, on social media, you see a lot of things which I try to avoid seeing. But (from) what I see, there are a lot of positives.""The relationship between Kohli, Rohit and the new coaching setup has been under discussion recently, particularly after India’s struggles in Tests and both batters’ decision to step away from red-ball cricket before last year’s England tour.Kotak said India would need to revise its ODI batting strategy once the T20 World Cup concludes in March, taking into account the new one-ball rule after the 34th over. Under the new rule, bowling teams must select one of the two balls to continue from overs 35-50.""It's still a huge difference between T20Is and ODIs. More or less every game is going over 300, particularly in India. We see more 300-plus scores and then (at times) you're chasing as well,"" Kotak said.""After (the) T20 World Cup, I think there'll definitely be more ODIs. We'll have to set up one template as to how we play after this new rule of (having) 34 overs only have one ball.""Kotak also explained the rationale behind Ayush Badoni’s maiden call-up when Washington Sundar was ruled out.""He’s been performing and it’s (the) selectors who pick the team. If we had only five bowlers (in first ODI) and Washington got injured on fourth (or the) fifth over, then who would have bowled those overs?,"" Kotak said.""Somebody should be able to bowl four-five or (even) three-four overs, whatever (the situation) requires. I think that would be the reason (for his selection) and he has scored runs (and) he can bowl. He's been performing in IPL also,"" he added.Kotak dismissed concerns over Badoni’s recent lack of runs in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, saying a few low-scoring innings do not matter.“Our boys, (the) amount of cricket they play, I don't think for any batter two (or) three innings would make any difference, and it shouldn’t,"" he said.",Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma continue to play an active role in India’s long- term plans for the ODI team.

Allan Donald on Virat Kohli’s legacy: Can he reach 100 centuries?

LONDON: Former England cricketer Stuart Broad rubbished the talks of the England men's team indulging in heavy drinking during their Ashes tour to Australia, saying that senior players are not ""party animals"" and just a ""couple of guys who made mistakes"" got viral across all media.England lost the Ashes Down Under by 4-1, snapping their 18-match winless streak in Australia at Melbourne, Joe Root's two centuries, which broke his Test ton duck in Australia and the rise of Jacob Bethell towards the back end of the series being the key positives.However, after the Ashes were lost during the Adelaide Test, a few clips of opener Ben Duckett seemingly drunk and Jacob Bethell partying went viral on social media, which seemed to be coming from their trip to Noosa after the loss at Brisbane in the second Test. The pictures did not go down well with several English fans, and players were trolled for their off-field indulgences.Speaking on the For the Love of Cricket podcast with co-host and star batter Jos Buttler, Broad said, ""I look at this England team, they are not drinking. I have seen loads of things about a drinking culture, but there is not one. (Zak) Crawley, (Ollie) Pope, (Ben) Stokes, (Joe) Root, they are not really drinkers.They are not party animals.""Broad said it was just a couple of guys making mistakes and them surfacing in the media, and it is upto the teammates to get their players out of such situations.""And that is when your culture is really strong,"" he added.Ahead of the fourth Test, England team's managing director Rob Key had said that he would examine what actually happened during the break and decide whether any action was needed.""If there are things where people are saying that our players went out and drank excessively, then of course we will be looking into that,"" Key said, as quoted from ESPNcricinfo.""Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol for an international cricket team is not something that I would expect to see at any stage, and it would be a fault not to look into what happened there. But from everything that I have heard so far, they were very well behaved,"" he noted.""I have read what has been written in the last day or so, and if it goes into where they are drinking lots and it is a stag do, all that type of stuff, that's completely unacceptable. I am not a drinker. I think a drinking culture does not help anyone in any stretch whatsoever,"" he added.","England lost the Ashes Down Under by 4-1, snapping their 18-match winless streak in Australia.

Harshit Rana press conference: 'Team wants to groom me as an all-rounder'

Poll Which aspect do you think has the greatest impact on an athlete's career? Talent Hard Work Opportunities Coaching

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the second ODI against New Zealand on Wednesday, India wicketkeeper-batter KL Rahul struck a powerful, reflective note while interacting with budding cricketers during the Men in Blue's training session in Vadodara. In a video shared by the BCCI , Rahul's words underlined patience, perseverance and readiness — themes that have shaped his own international journey.“It's not like you'll never get the opportunity. You'll be sitting outside for 2-3 years. If you don't get the opportunity in the state, then you'll get some other tournament to perform and show your skills and talent,” Rahul said, urging youngsters to trust the process rather than chase instant results.Emphasising self-discipline, the 33-year-old added, “You just have to constantly keep working on yourself and keep yourself ready. If you get a chance, you'll have to perform in such a way that you can't drop after that. But even in that, you'll have to enjoy the process. There's no other option for the player. That's all you have in your hands.”When asked about dealing with difficult phases, Rahul offered a candid response shaped by experience. “That phase is difficult for everyone. It's not like no player goes through that phase. He's always at the top.It won't happen with anyone. You'll get angry and frustrated. But you have to snap out of it. Don't give up. I'll do what I can. And when God gives me a chance, I'll use it,” he said.Reiterating the message, Rahul told the youngsters, “You will definitely get a chance to show your talent, whether it's in a domestic, international, or local tournament. You just have to work hard and be ready when your opportunity comes, and grab it with both your hands. As a cricketer, it's the only thing we can do.”","India wicketkeeper-batter KL Rahul spoke to budding cricketers. Rahul's words underlined patience, perseverance and readiness.

Sitanshu Kotak press conference: Conversations between coach Gambhir, Virat and Rohit, and more

RAJKOT: After a closer-than-expected victory in Vadodara, India will look to iron out vulnerabilities such as the lack of wickets with the new ball and the spinners’ inability to strike in the middle overs. They will also be keen to maintain their unbeaten record of never having lost a home ODI series against New Zealand when the teams clash at the Niranjan Shah Stadium here on Wednesday.With allrounder Washington Sundar ruled out due to a rib injury, it will be interesting to see who is drafted in as his replacement. Delhi batter Ayush Badoni has been named in the squad but it remains to be seen if he gets a game. India’s power-packed top order — Rohit Sharma, captain Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli — will look to feast again on what appears to be a placid wicket against a largely inexperienced bowling attack. With vice-captain Shreyas Iyer also returning to form with a well-composed 49 and KL Rahul scoring 29 not out, India’s middle order has been among runs, barring Ravindra Jadeja. The hosts won’t want a rerun of the collapse they suffered in the first ODI after Kohli fell, which allowed the match to drag to the penultimate over.The New Zealand attack, barring the lanky Kyle Jamieson (4/41), failed to pose any threat to India.Debutant Kristian Clarke (1/73) and leg-spinner Adithya Ashok (1/55 in 6 overs) were the other wicket-takers but their wickets came at the cost of runs — something the Kiwis can least afford if they want to stop India from running away with the game.Indian pacers Mohammed Siraj and Harshit Rana too lacked penetration with the new ball, but they kept things tight and didn’t allow the openers to get away with the scoring. While Rana, Prasidh Krishna and Siraj held their own in the middle and death overs, the lack of wickets from the spinners in the middle overs remains a concern.The only breakthrough there came when wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav had Will Young caught at point. With strips offering next to nothing for bowlers in ODIs, spinners have found it difficult to break through, while pacers have had to depend on cutters and cross-seamers to outfox batters. Despite being smashed at the death, Prasidh delivered a fuller-length ball to trap the marauding Daryll Mitchell, the visitors’ best batter in the first ODI.The Black Caps’ openers Henry Nicholls and Devon Conway got starts but failed to convert their half-centuries into three-figure scores. Will Young and Glenn Phillips also didn’t get going, which meant New Zealand were 25 runs short in the final analysis. This anomaly, Nicholls said, is something the visitors are looking to correct in Rajkot.“From a batting point of view, we did a lot of things pretty well and it’s a case of us being able to do them for a bit longer. Partnerships at the top and to be able to bat for an extended period of time are important. That’s always the case in One-Day cricket. If you are able to have wickets in hand, have a set batter in for the last 10-15 overs, then it certainly extends your death period,” said Nicholls.","India beat New Zealand by three wickets in the first ODI in Vadodara. Hosts will be keen to maintain their unbeaten record of never having lost a home ODI series against New Zealand.

Why teams are monitoring Elias Pettersson, Kotkaniemi, Kadri , and Coleman

This was unexpected: See what the entire NHL said about the Elias Pettersson trade! CANUCKS NEWS

Trade conversations throughout the NHL have started to increase once more, and players such as Elias Pettersson, Nazem Kadri, Jesperi Kotkaniemi, and Blake Coleman are beginning to be mentioned more frequently in the talks between the teams. Although there is no imminent activity at the moment, the league sources indicate that the players are under observation as the teams consider their performance, contracts, and how their line-ups will be in the future.None of these scenarios seems to be on the brink of happening; nevertheless, the constant low volume indicates that the teams are already doing their research. From Vancouver to Carolina and Calgary, the same standard is up to weighing the risk against the reward, and even more so since contracts, no-trade clauses, and recent performance trends complicate the potential deals.Patrick Johnston from The Province states that the clubs are nevertheless inquiring about Elias Pettersson, even though the Vancouver Canucks openly have faith in their top player. Pettersson, who has just turned 27, is already in the second year of an eight-year deal, which has a huge salary cap hit of $11.6 million attached to it. Johnston actually said that the player has definitely scored fewer points, but he is still very reliable on the defensive end.Nevertheless, with his full no-trade clause and high salary, any transaction is very difficult except in the case where Vancouver is prepared to pay part of the deal.Also, Johnston pointed out that the Carolina Hurricanes were already keeping an eye on the whole situation and that they are currently mulling the possibility of trading Jesperi Kotkaniemi. Elliotte Friedman of Sportsnet claimed that the Carolina team was willing to hear trade solicitations for the young center, who is only 25. Even if Kotkaniemi still isn't a guaranteed top-six forward, Cory Lavalette from The Athletic believes that the fact of Kilimi's age and salary cap making him easy to handle could be a great attraction for teams that are interested in a reclamation project.Calgary's difficult times during the season have turned Nazem Kadri and Blake Coleman into trade material again. TSN's Darren Dreger reports that Kadri's future is still uncertain, and he might end up in a playoff team, but the 13-team no-trade clause and the $7 million cap hit through 2028-29 make the situation a bit complicated.On the other hand, Pierre LeBrun said that Coleman has already been associated with the Montreal Canadiens, making him a trade possibility. The Flames will have to consider the likes of the players, the salary, and the team's needs before they take any action.These rumors denote quiet interest rather than panic, with playoff battles becoming fiercer and financial constraints coming down the line. Nevertheless, as the past reveals, the quiet of today can turn into major deals of tomorrow.Also Read: Detroit Red Wings retire Sergei Fedorov’s iconic No. 91 jersey, closing a long‑awaited chapter","Elias Pettersson, Nazem Kadri, Jesperi Kotkaniemi, and Blake Coleman are being mentioned more frequently in the talks between the teams.

Lauren Kyle Celebrates Draisaitl’s 1,000-Point Milestone

The Edmonton Oilers are still chasing consistency this season, but Leon Draisaitl’s historic milestone has given the team a spark. Edmonton currently sits second in the Pacific Division with a 22-16-7 record, having won two of its last three games. Saturday’s 4-3 shootout loss to the Los Angeles Kings stung, yet it also marked a special night for Draisaitl, who officially reached 1,000 NHL points.For the Edmonton Oilers superstar, the journey to this achievement was long and challenging. “There were a lot of nights my first year when I came home and thought ‘I don’t know if I can play in this league.’ It’s so hard. The game is different from juniors, you’re not as strong, not as fast as you need to be… I needed to become a better player in every facet, a better athlete. I put in the work and it helped me immensely,” Draisaitl reflected. The ceremony saw him joined on the ice by his wife Celeste, his parents Peter and Sandra, and even the family dog, Bowie. He received a golden stick and a Tiffany crystal, while teammates gifted him a Rolex to commemorate the moment.The milestone drew attention beyond the arena. Connor McDavid’s wife, Lauren Kyle, shared her pride on Instagram, captioning her post: “So proud of you guys!! @celestedesjardins @ drat_29.”Draisaitl followed the celebration with a two-goal performance against the Kings, marking the 71st multi-goal game of his career and moving past Mark Messier to fourth on the Oilers’ all-time scoring list.Connor McDavid also added to the night’s significance, extending his career-long point streak to 18 games, recording 19 goals and 41 points during the stretch. Despite the personal achievements, McDavid kept the focus on the team: “It’s a fun night for him, an exciting night, celebrating his 1,000 points and having his family in town.”The Edmonton Oilers will have little time to reflect, with a Monday matchup against the Chicago Blackhawks, on the horizon. Yet, Draisaitl’s milestone has already left an indelible mark, reminding fans of the skill, resilience, and dedication required to reach 1,000 NHL points.Also Read: “This is business”: NHL trade rumors heat up with $63 million ex-Maple Leafs target potentially on move from New Jersey","Edmonton Oilers forward Leon Draisaitl reached 1,000 NHL points on Saturday.

Chase Carter’s Role in the Spotlight

Fan Reaction and What Comes Next

Cody Bellinger’s free agency has dragged into mid-January, and with little public movement from teams, fans have been searching for signs that something is finally happening. That sign, at least for many, came from Instagram rather than a front office update.Bellinger’s wife, Chase Carter, posted a short story that quickly caught attention. The timing, paired with stalled talks between Bellinger and the New York Yankees, was enough to spark fresh speculation across MLB circles.Chase Carter shared a photo of herself and Cody Bellinger raising their glasses together. The caption read, “My dry January has turned into a very, very wet January.”On its own, the line looks like a joke about giving up the popular no-alcohol challenge. Fans, however, quickly read into it. Many took “very, very wet January” as a hint that something has changed behind the scenes, possibly related to Bellinger’s contract talks.This is not the first time social media activity connected to Bellinger’s personal life has fueled rumors. Similar posts in the past led to speculation about interest from other teams, keeping fans alert to even the smallest clues.Cody Bellinger remains unsigned after turning down the Yankees’ most recent offer.That proposal was reportedly a five-year deal worth more than $30 million per season. While strong, it did not meet what Bellinger’s camp is aiming for in either length or annual value, with expectations closer to a longer deal in the $36-37 million range.There is still interest on both sides. Meetings have taken place, and the Yankees continue to view Bellinger as a key addition to their outfield. Even so, the former Chicago Cubs standout remains without a team as January moves on.Chase Carter, a model, has been open about the difficult start to her career, including early rejections from agencies that criticized her appearance when she was just 13. She met Bellinger in 2020, the couple got engaged in 2023, and they are now married.They share two daughters, Caiden, born in 2021, and Cy, born in 2023. As Bellinger’s free agency continues, Carter’s online presence has added a personal angle to an otherwise quiet and tense negotiation period.Yankees fans have reacted with a mix of hope and impatience, with many calling for a deal to be completed before spring training. Media coverage has focused on how a single Instagram post managed to restart conversation around a stalled situation.For now, nothing has been confirmed. Until a contract is signed, every small detail will continue to be examined. Bellinger’s free agency remains unresolved, and one short caption has become part of the story.","Cody Bellinger’s free agency has dragged into mid-January.

Career stability and leadership of Chris Bassitt

Financial growth timeline from 2016 to 2026

Chris Bassitt was never a high draft pick in his career, but he turned his consistent, predictable climb into being a Major League starter at the end of the decade. Bassitt entered pro ball without the hype of a top prospect, but worked his way up through the ranks by being reliable, versatile, and an innings-eater on teams both in transition and in playoff contention.That reliability had secured them financially by the mid 2020s. Across arbitration years, a couple of one-year contracts, and rounding it all out with a big multi-year deal, Bassitt’s arc provides an obvious illustration of how veteran stability and mentorship help generate long-term profits in the modern MLB.A resume for Bassitt that tells the story of a pitcher who survived early career uncertainty and turned into a rotation regular beginning in 2016. He bounced back from Tommy John surgery early in his career and became a reliable workhorse of a starter with Oakland. In New York, that reputation came with him and was a part of a formidable Mets rotation in 2022.Beyond his stats, Bassitt was a clubhouse presence. His preparation and ability to adjust during a game were traits that younger pitchers often mentioned striving to mimic. Those qualities are only becoming more valued by teams, particularly as rotations turn over via injury and untested arms.Bassitt did a lot to reinforce himself as a trusted veteran who would help stabilize pitching staffs during playoff pushes.Bassitt's ascension is also reflected in his financials. His earnings from 2016 to 2020 were relatively modest because he was paid league minimum for most of the time and then saw small raises. His salary soared into the high single-digit millions, a considerable step up for the arbitration years, especially with the Mets.Bang in the middle of his financial timeline was December 2022, when Bassitt inked a three-year, $63 million contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. It was a deal that was clearly a show of faith in his durability and consistency, and pulled his career earnings into the tens of millions. Most estimates by the mid-2020s have his worth in the low double-digit millions, all guaranteed rather than a risky incentive.Also Read: Teoscar Hernandez net worth timeline (2016 to 2026): How the elite outfielder built his fortune, MLB star","Chris Bassitt entered pro ball without the hype of a top prospect.

Rich Paul thinks trading Austin Reaves is the price Los Angeles Lakers must pay to build around Luka Doncic,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/rich-paul-thinks-trading-austin-reaves-is-the-price-los-angeles-lakers-must-pay-to-build-around-luka-doncic/articleshow/126511230.cms,"Rich Paul and Austin Reaves (Image via Getty)



Rich Paul suggests Lakers to trade Austin Reeves



For the Los Angeles Lakers, Austin Reaves has long been the golden boy, he undrafted success story who became a cornerstone for them. But as the 2026 trade deadline approaches, Rich Paul has tossed a grenade into the conversation. His recent suggestion on the Game Over podcast wasn't just idle chatter, it was a cold and calculated blueprint on how to build a team around Luka Doncic. According to Paul, if the Lakers want to maximize their championship window with Luka, they have to be willing to part with their most beloved role player to land a defensive titan like Jaren Jackson Jr.The lack of defense on Lakers’ roster was a horrible sight to see when they traveled to Sacramento on Monday night, only to receive a blowout loss. Emphasizing the defensive perspective, Rich Payl said, “If I was the Lakers I would be targeting the Memphis Grizzlies as a trade partner for Jaren Jackson… If you’re building around Luka you need that anchor. Jaren doesn’t want to be a part of a rebuild… if you’re able to trade out expirings and trade the last 1st you got or you can withhold and give up less but this comes with a more unemotional attachment because Austin is beloved.There’s a world you can do what’s best for your team, and what’s best for Austin. Austin deserves to get paid… Memphis would definitely pay Austin. He would become their leading scorer and PG.”Paul also added, “But if you can keep Austin, have Jaren some kind of way, and have Luka, but they are going to take up most of your money, and I don’t get into the discount thing for any player…I don’t know Austin’s value to the Lakers or anybody else, but he deserves to get paid a lot of money. Memphis would definitely pay Austin. He would become their leading scorer and point guard.”Reeves has been averaging 26.6 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 6.3 assists while shooting 50.7% from the field and 36.5% from beyond the arc this season and is currently out after suffering a left calf strain in late December 2025.Rich Paul’s point is simple: you can’t build a house without an anchor. While the Lakers have elite offensive gravity with Doncic and a 41-year-old LeBron James still providing steady production, they lack a defensive anchor. And, Jackson is the 2022-23 Defensive Player of the Year. With the Grizzlies' (17-22 ) struggling performance this season, JJJ might take a chance at the championship with this trade.Also read: The Sacramento Kings take a dig at LeBron James’ patch debut after it ended in a blowout loss","Rich Paul suggests Lakers to trade Austin Reeves for Jaren Jackson Jr. Reaves has been averaging 26.6 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 6.3 assists while shooting 50.7% from the field and 36.5% from beyond the arc this season.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126511227,imgsize-45272,width-400,resizemode-4/rich-paul-and-austin-reaves.jpg"
