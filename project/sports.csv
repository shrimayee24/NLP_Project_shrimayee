Bengaluru Headlines Today — The Biggest Updates You Need to Know.

BENGALURU: What began as a tattoo of ""another woman"" on the husband's forearm ended in the murder of his wife and a sentence of life imprisonment for him.Earlier this week, a city court convicted 33-year-old Vinay Kumar, a resident of A Narayanapura in Mahadevapura, of killing his wife Ashwini D, 29, inside their home in April 2021. Since his arrest, Kumar had remained lodged in Bengaluru Central Prison at Parappana Agrahara, with his attempt to secure bail failing.Kumar and Ashwini, an engineer and his younger sister's classmate, met at a family wedding, fell in love, and married in 2018. But the marriage began to unravel three years later when Kumar returned home with a tattoo reading ""Roopa"" inked on his right forearm. When Ashwini questioned him about the tattoo and demanded to know who Roopa was, Kumar gave evasive answers. She later discovered that he was having an affair.According to the prosecution, Kumar feared she might take legal or personal action against him. Unwilling to end the relationship with Roopa, he decided to eliminate his wife.Public prosecutor Satyavati HR told TOI the murder was planned carefully. On the night of April 16, 2021, Kumar purchased a can of beer and a strip of 10 sleeping tablets before returning home.After having chicken biryani for dinner, he forced Ashwini to drink the beer, secretly mixed with the tablets. She soon slipped into a deep sleep. Kumar believed the overdose would be fatal. When he found Ashwini still breathing early the next morning, Kumar strangled her using her dupatta.""Afterwards, he stepped out of the house and raised the alarm, claiming his wife was lying motionless,"" Satyavati said. With a neighbour's help, he took Ashwini to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared her brought dead. Kumar initially managed to convince Ashwini's parents and relatives that it was a natural death. However, Mahadevapura police ordered an autopsy, while viscera samples were sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory.The autopsy revealed the death was due to strangulation, leading to Kumar's arrest. Subsequent FSL reports confirmed the presence of alcohol and sleeping tablets in Ashwini's system.During the trial, circumstantial evidence sealed Kumar's fate. Testimonies from a wine shop cashier and a medical store assistant, backed by CCTV footage, established that Kumar had purchased the beer and sleeping tablets on the night of the murder.After police filed the charge-sheet, Kumar filed his bail application. Police, however, discovered that the surety documents submitted were fake and informed the court that his family had distanced themselves from him after the crime. The bail plea was rejected, forcing him to spend time in prison.","Vinay Kumar, 33, convicted of killing his wife Ashwini D, 29, inside their home in April 2021.

First Indian among world’s top 10 richest women



In 2025, women were no longer the footnote to the big story — they were the story. Across crises and celebrations, ballots and battlefields, podiums and boardrooms, women emerged as the decisive force shaping outcomes and narratives.This year ender traces how women became the X factor of 2025: from the symbolism and steel of Operation Sindoor , to the women voters who once again decided Bihar’s fate; from new women heads of state reshaping global politics, to athletes who carried India’s sporting year; and finally, to a woman who climbed into the world’s richest ranks, redefining economic power.These were not isolated moments. Together, they marked a year when women didn’t just influence events — they changed the balance.A newlywed wife, sitting silently beside her husband’s body — the image that came to define the Pahalgam attack.A terrorist strike. Twenty-six dead. All men.“Go, tell Modi,” a terrorist told a woman after shooting her husband.Operation Sindoor was the response. Its imagery was stark and deliberate — red and black, vermillion smeared like a warning. A symbol of vengeance, resolve, and the state’s answer to terror.""Terrorists dared to wipe 'sindoor' from the foreheads of our sisters; that is why India destroyed the very headquarters of terror,"" PM Modi had said in his first address to the nation after the launch of the operation.The symbolism did not stop at words or posters. It took shape on the world stage when two women officers stepped forward to brief the global media on Operation Sindoor.Their presence was widely seen as intentional messaging — women not just as victims or symbols, but as the face and force of India’s response to terror.Operation Sindoor also saw women in direct combat. In the Akhnoor sector along the IB, a six-member women’s BSF team led by Assistant Commandant Neha Bhandari defended forward posts under sustained Pakistani fire for three days and nights, forcing enemy positions across Sialkot to retreat. For several of the young recruits, it was their first combat test — marking a decisive shift from symbolism to frontline action.Women decided Bihar’s verdict once again, delivering Nitish Kumar a victory that numbers make hard to dispute. While their support for the JD(U)-BJP government’s pro-women agenda has been steady since 2005, this election saw a decisive surge.The turnout told its own story. As many as 71.6% women voted, nearly nine percentage points higher than men, and a sharp rise from 59.7% in 2020.A Rs 10,000 cash transfer to over 1.5 crore women in the run-up to polls acted as a turbo-boost. Like Rakhi after Diwali, the ‘das-hazariya’ payout — along with the mobilisation of Jeevika Didis — became the catalyst for the NDA’s sweeping win.For many women, this loyalty has been shaped over two decades — beginning with schemes like free bicycles for schoolgirls in Nitish Kumar’s first term.In 2010, smiling girls cycling to school became the defining image of his landslide victory, much like women voters have shaped this one.Even contentious policies have found unlikely champions. Prohibition, despite widespread criticism from men, continues to draw strong backing from women, particularly the poor, who often credit it with tangible household benefits.Add to this structural reforms — 35% reservation for women in government jobs, 50% in local bodies, and the expansive Jeevika self-help group network — and the pattern is clear.In Bihar, elections may be fought by parties, but they are increasingly won by women.Across continents in 2025, the ascent of women to the highest political office began to look less like an exception and more like a long-delayed correction. In March, Namibia’s Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah was sworn in as the country’s first woman president. In a region where power has long been shaped by patriarchal traditions, her presidency carries the promise of something deeper: a recalibration of institutional culture, with greater emphasis on accountability, environmental stewardship, and gender-balanced governance.That same shift echoed months later in South America. In July, Suriname elected Jennifer Geerlings-Simons as its first woman president at a moment of economic uncertainty and cautious optimism, driven by newly discovered offshore oil reserves. A physician by training and a respected parliamentary leader, Geerlings-Simons embodies a quieter, steadier form of authority — one rooted in consensus-building and institutional continuity. Her victory underscored an important truth: the gender wave in politics is no longer confined to large economies or global power centres. It is reaching smaller, diverse nations where leadership had remained stubbornly homogeneous for decades.By October, the tremor reached East Asia. Sanae Takaichi’s elevation as Japan’s first female prime minister shattered one of the country’s most enduring political glass ceilings. In a system long dominated by men, her rise signalled a shift not only within party hierarchies but also in public expectations. For Japan, where women’s political representation has historically lagged, Takaichi’s appointment was as much a cultural moment as a political one — a sign that the contours of leadership are slowly expanding, allowing future generations of women to imagine themselves not at the margins of power, but at its very centre.Harmanpreet Kaur, Jemimah Rodrigues, Divya Deshmukh, Sheetal Devi, Nikhat Zareen , Stanzin Dolkar, Anahat Singh and India’s women footballers defined Indian sport in 2025, delivering results that cut across disciplines.The landmark moment came when the Indian women’s cricket team won its first-ever ODI World Cup, that too in front of a home crowd, with Jemimah’s match-winning knock in a pressure semi-final and a controlled final performance sealing a long-awaited title.Beyond cricket, Indian women asserted themselves with authority. Divya Deshmukh became the youngest Women’s World Cup champion in chess, while archer Sheetal Devi added a para-world title and earned selection to the able-bodied compound team purely on scores. In squash, Anahat Singh claimed the national spotlight by winning the SRFI Squash Indian Open, and in boxing, India’s women powered the country to seven of nine gold medals at the World Boxing Cup Finals, led by Nikhat Zareen.Some of the year’s most powerful moments came from inclusive and emerging sport. The Indian Blind Women’s Cricket Team won the inaugural Women’s T20 World Cup for the Blind, while Stanzin Dolkar’s decisive goals earned India its first international bronze in women’s ice hockey. Football completed the surge, with the women’s national team qualifying outright for the AFC Asian Cup for the first time in over two decades, and the U-20 and U-17 sides also sealing continental berths. In 2025, Indian women didn’t just shine — they set the standard.Roshni Nadar scripted history in 2025 by becoming the first Indian woman to break into the world’s top 10 richest women, ranking fifth on the Hurun Global Rich List with a net worth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore ($40 billion).The milestone followed the transfer of a 47% stake in HCL Technologies from her father, Shiv Nadar, firmly establishing her as India’s richest woman and the country’s third-richest individual this year.","This year ender traces how women became the X factor of 2025.

Shashi Tharoor Responds To Digvijaya Singh, Says Congress Needs Discipline, Not Lessons From RSS

NEW DELHI: Congress functionary Shashi Tharoor on Sunday came out in support of party colleague Digvijaya Singh 's views, saying the party's organisation should be strengthened and there should be some discipline.On Saturday, ahead of the CWC meeting, Singh had stirred a controversy by praising RSS-BJP's organisational power as he shared Narendra Modi's old picture on X: ""I found this picture on Quora.

Also, there should be discipline in our organisation.""On X, Tharoor, who was seen seated next to Singh at the event, said, ""Since its first session in 1885, the party has remained a cornerstone of the nation's democratic journey and political evolution.

Alex Rodriguez says baseball Hall of Fame recognition would feel hollow despite 696 home runs for surprising reason,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/alex-rodriguez-says-baseball-hall-of-fame-recognition-would-feel-hollow-despite-696-home-runs-for-surprising-reason/articleshow/126222262.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Why would Hall of Fame recognition feel hollow to Alex Rodriguez?

Alex Rodriguez reflects on life changes at age 50 after retiring

Alex Rodriguez built a Hall of Fame level resume with the Seattle Mariners, Texas Rangers, and New York Yankees

Alex Rodriguez is one of those names that still makes baseball fans pause. Not because of what he did on the field, but because of how complicated his legacy became. On paper, his resume screams Hall of Fame. The numbers, the awards, the championships, they all line up perfectly. Yet when Rodriguez talks about Cooperstown now, something surprising comes out. He does not sound bitter. He sounds relieved.In a candid conversation with, Rodriguez admitted that a Hall of Fame plaque might actually leave him feeling empty. That is not something you expect from a player who spent decades chasing greatness. Therapy changed the way he looks at success, validation, and his own past decisions. Instead of viewing the Hall as closure, Rodriguez sees it as something that would not fix the emotional weight he carried for years. This story is not really about baseball anymore. It is about what happens when achievement stops being enough.Rodriguez's thoughts come from some serious self-reflection, thanks to therapy that changed how he sees things. He mentioned feeling like he got ""divorced"" from his Hall of Fame aspirations, saying that the sessions helped him understand his past actions better.In the same interview, Rodriguez elaborated on his therapy experience to Jones, “I’m like, ‘Whoa, what the hell am I doing here? This doesn’t make any sense,’” he recalled initially. But persistence paid off. “But the more I stayed with it, the more it started to really affect me in a positive way. Seeing things in a different way and then looking at my past, definitely not as a victim but understanding some of my behavior and making sure that I’m learning from those behaviors and it never happens again,” Rodriguez added.This growth sheds light on the ""hollow"" feeling he expects from induction. For Rodriguez, getting a plaque in Cooperstown won't wipe away the unresolved inner struggles from his past, including the pressures and decisions that shaped his career. Therapy has helped him focus on emotional healing rather than seeking outside approval, making the Hall seem inadequate in comparison.Rodriguez opened up during a chat with Jason Jones from The Athletic, which came out on December 28, 2025. Now at 50, he looked back on how much his life has changed since he hung up his boots in 2016.""I have a life today that I didn't have for the first 40 years,"" Rodriguez told Jones. He continued, explaining his stance on a potential Hall of Fame plaque: ""If I went to the Hall of Fame, in a weird way, I would be hollow inside. I would still be in a lot of pain.""Rodriguez pointed out his preference for his current state of being. ""I would rather have what I have today, because it really helped me unlock a lot of the work that I needed to do,"" he told Jones. This chat happened during the ongoing talks about his Hall of Fame eligibility, which started back in 2022.Before the scandals, Rodriguez's on-field prowess was unmistakable. He started his career with the Seattle Mariners in 1994 and played through 2016, also donning the jerseys of the Texas Rangers and Yankees.He has a bunch of achievements, like winning the World Series with New York in 2009, snagging three American League MVP awards in 2003, 2005, and 2007, and earning a batting title in 1996 with a .358 average.He also picked up two Gold Glove Awards for shortstop in 2002 and 2003, 10 Silver Slugger Awards, and made it to the All-Star game 14 times. Statistically, he sits at fifth place all-time with 696 home runs and fourth with 2,086 RBIs, plus he has a .295 career batting average.These stats put Rodriguez in a solid spot for first-ballot induction in a PED-free environment, showing his power, defense, and reliability with three different teams.Rodriguez was first considered for the Hall of Fame on the BBWAA ballot in 2022. While his backing has increased a bit, it still falls short of the 75% needed for induction.The 2025 results were revealed on January 21, 2025, showing that he earned 146 votes, or 37.1%, a 2.3 percentage point bump from the previous year, landing him fourth among the returnees. His ballot eligibility will end after 2030. Voters mention PED associations as the key hurdle, based on analyses from Baseball-Reference and MLB.com.Also Read: Ricky Tiedemann injury update: Toronto Blue Jays left-handed pitcher expected to be fully healthy for spring training","Alex Rodriguez is one of those names that still makes baseball fans pause.

Risk and Reward for Both Sides

The Detroit Tigers are weighing a free-agent move that would directly address one of their weakest spots. Outfielder Harrison Bader has come up in discussions as a possible addition after a strong 2025 season that showed both improved offense and steady defense.Detroit’s interest reflects where the team stands right now. The Tigers want to stay competitive while their young core develops, and questions around the long-term future of Tarik Skubal make short-term roster upgrades more important. Adding a proven center fielder would reduce pressure on younger players and stabilize the lineup.The expected price for Harrison Bader sits in the range of two years and $20–25 million. Detroit Tigers would prefer a shorter deal but are open to flexibility because of Bader’s defensive value. This would be a straight free-agent signing after Bader declined a $10 million mutual option with Philadelphia and accepted a $3 million buyout.If the Tigers bring him in, Parker Meadows would likely lose his everyday role. Meadows has struggled to stay healthy and consistent, and the club could shift him into a platoon role or send him back to Triple-A to continue his development without daily responsibility in center field.Harrison Bader offers a clear upgrade in reliability. His speed and arm fit well in the large outfield at Comerica Park, where covering ground matters. Offensively, his 2025 season showed enough power to justify a regular spot in the order, especially compared to Detroit’s recent production at the position.For Bader, Detroit offers steady playing time and a defined role on a team trying to move forward without committing to a long-term contract.Bader also posted a 10.2% barrel rate, nearly double Meadows’ 5.1%, and brings a Gold Glove résumé that Detroit lacks in center field.The Tigers would gain defensive stability and more dependable offense, but there is risk tied to Bader’s age and past inconsistency. The contract size also matters if Detroit needs flexibility later.Also read: MLB trade rumors: San Diego Padres potentially eyeing $40 million pitcher to bolsdter squad and improve title odds Even with those concerns, this move favors Detroit.

Sugar Ray Leonard’s overall net worth in 2025, boxing earnings, and legacy

Bernadette Robi and their combined financial picture

Sugar Ray Leonard is more than just a name in the history books. He is a standard by which many fighters’ achievements are still measured to this day. Sugar Ray Leonard is an Olympic legend and Hall of Famer who stunned the world of boxing through his electrifying performances in the 1970s and 1980s and translated his style and agility into wealth, which is still being enjoyed today through his astute business ventures outside of his fighting days of swinging punches and dodging others.Already in 2025, his achievement is as widely celebrated in wealth circles as it once was in boxing rings that resounded to roaring crowds of supporters and fans loyal to Sugar Ray Leonard and his illustrious career in the ring, his achievements and path to success in and outside that ring, and his life after boxing with his loving wife, Bernadette Robi Leonard.At the end of 2025, the net worth of the boxing legend, Sugar Ray Leonard, stands at an estimated 120 million dollars, and this treasure trove has been accumulated through his boxing purses, endorsements, public speaking, and lucrative investments. Long before the days when sportspeople even began to speak about extending their brands for financial gain, Sugar Ray Leonard began to redefine the financial rule book for boxers. He became the very first boxer to take home more than 100 million dollars in his heyday.His Hall of Fame career has been marked by world championships in five weight divisions, as well as his legendary fights against the likes of Roberto Duran, Thomas Hearns, and Marvin Hagler, pitting him not merely against a generation, but also lining his pockets with lucrative sums of money.After his active career, he did not just melt into the sunset longingly, but carved himself a niche as a sports commentator for HBO, NBC, and more, a speaker, television personality.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Leonard has leveraged fame to produce returns on his investment as well, real estate investments that include his dearly-loved villa in the Pacific Palisades and earn residual income from contracts related to his publications, speaking events, and licensing deals that see his name and face popping up every corner of the globe .Bernadette Robi, Leonard’s wife since 1993, has a quieter but very important role in this joint life. A former model, she is his lifelong companion and has her own net worth, which is quite small at $500,000, but she is also the joint manager of theirs.Robi has been able to parlay the Sugar Ray Leonard Foundation into a platform where the foundation’s mission of juvenile diabetes research and relevant projects is combined with their popularity. Currently, the combined net worth of the couple in the year 2025 is estimated at around $120 million, largely due to Sugar Ray’s earnings through boxing and other contracts, but also as a result of the lifestyle choices they make in their lives.Also Read: Mike Tyson confirms timing and location for Floyd Mayweather Jr exhibition fight","At the end of 2025, the net worth of the boxing legend, Sugar Ray Leonard, stands at an estimated 120 million dollars.

Can Virat Kohli chase down Sachin Tendulkar's hundred hundreds?

India vice-captain Smriti Mandhana joined an elite club on Sunday, becoming only the second Indian woman after Mithali Raj and the fastest ever to surpass 10,000 international runs.Smriti, who made her India debut against Bangladesh in April 2013, needed 27 runs to reach the milestone in the fourth T20I against Sri Lanka at the Greenfield International Stadium in Thiruvananthapuram. She achieved it in just 20 balls and went on to score a brilliant 80 off 48 deliveries, hitting 11 fours and three sixes at a strike rate of 170.2, marking her 32nd fifty in international cricket.With this achievement, Smriti joins New Zealand’s Suzie Bates and former England captain Charlotte Edwards as the only other women to cross 10,000 international runs.Her career statistics are equally impressive: 629 runs in seven Tests, 5,322 runs in 117 ODIs, and the chance to surpass Mithali Raj’s all-time record of 10,868 international runs. Smriti had already etched her name in T20I history, becoming the first Indian and second overall after Suzie Bates to reach 4,000 runs in Women’s T20Is during the series opener against Sri Lanka in Visakhapatnam.The left-handed opener was also a key figure in India’s victorious Women’s ODI World Cup campaign, scoring 434 runs in nine innings at an average of 54.25. She finished 2025 as the highest run-scorer in ODIs, amassing 1,362 runs across 23 innings, including five fifties and five centuries.Smriti also became the first Indian woman to score a century in all three formats of the game.After the five-match T20I series concludes on December 30, Smriti will lead Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the 2026 Women’s Premier League, which kicks off on January 9.

Tyler O’Neill's record-setting opening day blast

Cameron Meisner's walk-off first career homer

Eugenio Suárez's four-homer onslaught

Cal Raleigh 's record-shattering 60th homer

Shohei Ohtani 's franchise-record 55th home run

The‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ 2025 MLB season is likely to be recalled more as a collection of moments where one player's swing changed the whole narrative. Certain home runs didn't just win the games; they shifted the momentum, gave trust to the decisions of the line-ups, and even upended the traditional views about the players' capacities.O’Neill’s home run on the opening day set a tone that, at the highest level, consistent performance is rarely a matter of luck. Meisner’s walk-off illustrated that sometimes, a player who is only a benchwarmer can have the moment of their life. Suárez’s four home run game was a testament to how little changes in one's style can result in peak-level performance extremely ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌fast.The 2025 baseball season kicked off with a memorable event. Boston Red Sox outfielder Tyler O’Neill smashed a home run on Opening Day for the sixth consecutive year. This time, he achieved it in his home country of Canada, playing in Toronto against the Blue Jays. The opposite-field blast to right field left the local fans in shock and excited Red Sox supporters all around.ESPN announcer Joe Buck really nailed the excitement during the broadcast, yelling that O’Neill had once again come through on Opening Day.His streak, which kicked off in 2020, is one of a kind in Major League Baseball history. No other player has ever hit a home run in six consecutive season openers.The home run was off a hanging slider and showcased O’Neill’s knack for clutch hitting. He wrapped up the 2024 season with a .285 batting average and 28 home runs, and this shot gave Boston a strong start in a season where they made a deep playoff run.On April 5, 2025, rookie Cameron Meisner gave Tampa Bay Rays fans a moment to cherish. With the team down 3–2 against the Baltimore Orioles in the ninth inning, the 23-year-old took his turn and smashed the very first pitch he faced into right field. That walk-off home run turned the score to 3–2 in favor of the Rays, igniting a wild celebration among the 18,000 fans at Tropicana Field.It was Meisner's first career home run, which made the moment even more intense. Broadcaster Dewayne Staats exclaimed that the rookie had ""wrapped this one up in dramatic style,"" perfectly capturing the crowd's shock and excitement.Meisner had just made his debut, coming off a pretty average spring training, but this swing immediately put him in the spotlight. He ended up hitting 12 home runs and driving in 48 runs that season, although this walk-off was the only one he had all year. The win also ignited a hot streak for Tampa, who went on to win seven out of their next 10 games.On May 18, 2025, Eugenio Suárez playing against the Colorado Rockies at Chase Field, the 33-year-old tied the game several times and led Arizona to a thrilling 12–8 comeback victory.Suárez hit three consecutive home runs early in the game and then added a fourth in the seventh inning. All of his homers came from poorly thrown pitches, showcasing his knack for capitalizing on mistakes.This was a historic moment only the 19th instance in Major League Baseball history where a player has hit four homers in one game, and just the second time for a Diamondback, the first being J.D. Martinez in 2017.Broadcasters were all about the excitement as the home runs kept coming, with Greg Schulte expressing his shock after Suárez hit his third and fourth homers. Fans at Chase Field got to see a record-tying show of strength that quickly became a part of Diamondbacks history.Suárez attributed his success to some changes he made to his swing during the offseason. By the middle of the season, he was leading the National League with 34 home runs, just trailing his teammate Corbin Carroll in the hunt for the league's top spot.His impressive performance contributed to Arizona's 92 wins and a Wild Card playoff berth, while also earning Suárez his third All-Star nod.On‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ September 15, 2025, Cal Raleigh, the catcher for the Seattle Mariners, made baseball history. He hit his 60th home run of the season, a three-run shot off of the Kansas City Royals' pitcher, going beyond Johnny Bench's record for catchers. This moment went down during a 7-4 win and crowned Raleigh the AL MVP.Cal Raleigh's show in baseball was gorgeous from start to finish. Before the All-Star break, he had already hammered 38 home runs; in addition, he had 8 games where he went deep twice. Furthermore, he proved to be very consistent as he caught more than 1,200 innings. Witnessing his power was something that not only players but fans got to relish at the same time.The announcers couldn't contain their excitement as they called his 60th homer ""an MVP moment."" His 50th and 55th home runs had already left the records for catchers and switch-hitters shattered, so with his latest one, he became an indelible part of baseball history.Raleigh, who was first drafted in the fourth round in 2018, sees this milestone as the culmination of years of steady growth. Besides changing the record books, his sparkling performance injected enthusiasm among the Mariners in their run to the AL West division title.Raleigh was just simply amazing in having brought the power in the catcher position unheard of before. It takes tremendous strength, stamina, and perfect timing to be able to do what Raleigh has sadly setting the new floor of expectations in the ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌field.On October 29, 2025, Shohei Ohtani created one of the most unforgettable moments in baseball history. In Game 7 of the World Series at Dodger Stadium, he hit his 55th home run of the season during the 11th inning, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 5–4 walk-off victory against the Houston Astros and securing their eighth championship.This homer not only broke his own single-season home run record for the team but also capped off a year where he struck out 200 batters as a pitcher.Earlier in the series, Ohtani had already hit three home runs, including two in Game 3, showcasing his dominance on the grandest stage. Broadcasters referred to his 55th homer as “a record-breaking moment,” while analysts were in awe of his knack for hitting tough pitches with impeccable timing.The postseason was packed with highlights for Ohtani: a leadoff homer in Game 1, a three-homer game in another matchup, and numerous clutch hits that kept the Dodgers in the hunt. His blend of power hitting and top-notch pitching earned him the National League MVP award unanimously.For fans, Ohtani’s season was about more than just stats. His 55 home runs and 25 pitching wins demonstrated that he is a once-in-a-generation talent, changing the way we view a single player’s impact on a team.Also Read: Alex Rodriguez says baseball Hall of Fame recognition would feel hollow despite 696 home runs for surprising reason","The 2025 baseball season kicked off with a memorable event.

What the New York Mets Gain - and Risk

The New York Mets are adjusting quickly after moving on from a player who had been part of the franchise for nearly a decade. With Brandon Nimmo now in Texas, the Mets are looking for a short-term outfield solution that keeps spending under control while maintaining roster stability.That search has led them to Max Kepler. The veteran outfielder is viewed as a practical replacement rather than a headline move. A reported one-year deal worth $7.6 million would give the Mets defensive reliability and left-handed power without limiting future flexibility.The New York Mets’ plans shifted after a rare one-for-one trade with the Texas Rangers sent Nimmo to Texas in exchange for second baseman Marcus Semien. Nimmo agreed to waive his full no-trade clause to complete the deal, ending his eight-year, $162 million run in New York.On the field, Nimmo remained productive in 2025. He played 143 games and finished with a .261 average, 23 home runs, and 82 RBIs. Still, the Mets chose to prioritize infield stability and payroll balance. Semien now fills second base, but the move left a clear opening in left field.Max Kepler became a free agent after a one-year, $10 million season with Philadelphia that was slowed by knee issues.His overall numbers dipped, but the Mets see value in his defense and underlying power metrics. In 2025, he ranked among the league’s best outfield arms and remains well-suited for corner work.A short-term deal also fits the Mets’ longer view. Top prospect Carson Benge is expected to push for a larger role soon, and Kepler would serve as a bridge rather than a blocker. The savings compared to Nimmo’s contract also leave room to pursue pitching upgrades.Max Kepler gives the Mets steady corner defense, a strong throwing arm, and power against right-handed pitching at a lower cost. His projected salary is far below Nimmo’s annual average, which helps keep the luxury tax in check.The concern is durability and age. Kepler is entering his mid-30s and coming off a down year. He also does not solve the center-field question long term, which leaves the Mets relying on internal options.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Detroit Tigers predicted to chase $6.25 million Minnesota Twins star to address center field and bolster squad Even with those risks, the move fits the moment.

What are the NBA punishments for Jose Alvarado and Mark Williams ?



Pelicans- Suns fight fallout shapes aftermath of New Orleans loss



The NBA finally addressed the heated moment that crossed the line during Saturday night’s Pelicans-Suns matchup in New Orleans. It started as a tense, physical game turned chaotic in the third quarter, forcing officials to eject two players and shift the spotlight away from the score. The league’s response arrived later, confirming discipline for both sides involved in the altercation.The incident occurred during Phoenix’s 123–114 win at the Smoothie King Center. It was a game that completed a back-to-back set between the teams. Amid the intense game, a routine defensive sequence spiraled into an ugly exchange that demanded league intervention. But not without consequences.ESPN’s Shams Charania shared that the NBA is taking strict action against Jose Alvarado and Mark Williams. “The NBA is suspending New Orleans Pelicans guard Jose Alvarado for two games and Phoenix Suns center Mark Williams for one game after their fight Saturday night, sources tell ESPN,” senior NBA insider Charania shared on X.The fight occurred late in the third quarter near midcourt. As Suns guard Collin Gillespie moved off the ball, Williams stepped in to set a screen. Alvarado fought aggressively through the contact and was called for a foul.Moments later, Williams shoved Alvarado from behind, triggering a face-to-face confrontation. The exchange escalated quickly as both players threw right hands before teammates and officials rushed in. Referees ejected both players immediately.Neither Alvarado nor Williams spoke to the media after the game. Suns head coach Jordan Ott acknowledged the moment without assigning blame, pointing to the strain of the schedule.“I saw it start, and then all of a sudden everyone jumped in,” Ott said. “Second night of a back-to-back, lack of sleep — something always tends to happen. They got tangled up, and obviously, they both got thrown out.”Despite the disruption, Phoenix maintained control on the floor. Williams finished with 10 points and eight rebounds in only 11 minutes before his ejection. Devin Booker led the Suns with 20 points, while Royce O’Neale highlighted the collective effort required to close out the win.“Yesterday was a dog fight, and today was a dog fight,” O’Neale said. “It took everybody to get this win.”For New Orleans, the loss dropped the Pelicans to 8–25. Alvarado ended his night with seven points and two steals, while Trey Murphy III paced the team with 24 points, including six three-pointers.The suspensions now remove two rotation players from upcoming games as both teams press forward.

Why the rumor didn’t add up, and what Jordan Chiles has said about her dating life

Jordan Chiles is an Olympic gymnast and competed for the U.S. at the 2020 and 2024 Olympics. Chiles had to deny a recent rumor that allegedly included an engaged woman on Dancing With the Stars, Ezra Sosa. This rumor was circulating online after the show’s season 34 finale. The news about the possibility that Chiles and Sosa would join them after they had won the third round prompted much speculation on social media. Sosa quickly abandoned the claim, posting a photo of the headline on Instagram, saying, “News to me,” and then tagging Chiles, “Congratulations to us.”Jordan Chiles reshared Ezra Sosa’s post using laughing emojis, hinting that both were in agreement that it was funny and false. Their public response to the question essentially ended this speculation, and neither one stated that the claim had any factual basis.This was a rumor, largely because the pair had chemistry on screen throughout the season. They performed at every turn for judges and viewers, and their close collaboration became one of the most talked-about aspects of the competition. Jordan Chiles and Ezra Sosa, though, did not suggest they were actually together beyond the dance floor.Ezra Sosa’s engagement claim was likely to fail, despite its immediate negation. Sosa is gay and has also previously talked about how he “came out of the public eye” since joining Dancing With the Stars in 2021. He has also said in previous interviews that while he did not initially discuss his sexuality publicly, it was a journey for him and not an attempt to hide who he was.In addition to the denial, a number of details made the engagement claim unlikely. Ezra Sosa is also a publicly gay man who has previously spoken of coming out as an outspoken critic since joining Dancing With the Stars in 2021. In the past interviews, he has stated that although he did not initially publicly describe his sexuality, it was a journey and not an attempt to hide who he is.Jordan Chiles has also recently been talking about her life. On the Keke Palmer podcast, Baby, This Is Keke Palmer, the gymnast admitted she’s currently single. She said the first relationship she had with another woman was because she had problems communicating due to distance, time zone differences, and inconsistent dates.Jordan Chiles has tended to keep her dating life private, but she has publicly spoken about her tastes. She has said she would not marry another gymnast, but she would be open to someone else dating outside of her sport. Fans briefly linked her to Tariq Woolen, an NFL player, in 2024, although he never officially told anyone about it.Jordan Chiles and Ezra Sosa’s marriage is one of the highlights of the season, though the official engagement promises were false. After weeks of consistent performances and performance, the duo dropped to third place in the final. In a touching Instagram post before the finale, Chiles declared Sosa his “best partner ever.”The engagement rumor quickly became public, but the two athletes made it out in plain English and with humor, showing that they were related more to professionalism, trust, and teamwork than to romance.Also Read: Unexpected star guest sends fans into frenzy during Jordan Chiles’ DWTS finale rehearsal","Jordan Chiles is an Olympic gymnast and competed for the U.S. at the 2020 and 2024 Olympics.

NEW DELHI: India registered a commanding 30-run victory over Sri Lanka in the fourth women’s T20I on Sunday, but skipper Harmanpreet Kaur acknowledged she had to urge her bowlers to speed up their overs towards the end to avoid a potential slow over-rate penalty. With the win, India moved to an unassailable 4-0 lead in the five-match series and will head into the fifth and final T20I aiming for a 5-0 clean sweep. The fifth T20I will be played on Tuesday.Harmanpreet appeared visibly animated late in Sri Lanka’s chase as she repeatedly instructed her teammates during the closing stages of the innings.Explaining her reaction at the post-match presentation, she said, ""We were getting short in time and I wanted everyone be on time. I didn't want three fielders outside the in-field. I try to improve from my mistakes.""Earlier, the hosts laid the foundation for the win through a record partnership between Smriti Mandhana (80) and Shafali Verma (79), before spinner Vaishnavi Sharma returned impressive figures of 2/24 to seal the result and take India to a 4-0 lead in the series.""(We) should give credit to Shafali and Smriti and then me and Richa finished well.""With the series already secured, Harmanpreet hinted at the possibility of further changes for the final T20I, scheduled to be played on Tuesday.""We thought we will give chance to Harleen (Deol), but (given) how it went (today), we sent (in) Richa early. Smriti and Shafali didn't let Harleen bat,"" she said.","India registered a commanding 30-run victory over Sri Lanka in the fourth women’s T20I on Sunday.

From MCG to T20 World Cup snub: How Indian cricket let Shubman Gill down

NEW DELHI: Former England cricketer Monty Panesar has criticised India’s Test captain Shubman Gill , saying the youngster is complacent and not yet equipped to handle the demands of all three formats at the international level.While acknowledging Gill’s natural talent, Panesar pointed out that the batter tends to play “lazy shots” during matches and lacks the intensity that defined Virat Kohli ’s game across formats.""He is a complacent cricketer. He has a lot of talent, but he starts playing lazy shots in the game. Virat Kohli's intensity and aggression are evident in all formats. Shubhman Gill can't do that. Too much burden for him. He can't be the captain of all formats. It is too much for him,"" Panesar told ANI.Panesar’s remarks come at a time when India have struggled in Test cricket under head coach Gautam Gambhir , with the side suffering two whitewash defeats — 3-0 against New Zealand and 2-0 against South Africa.Speaking about Gambhir’s tenure, Panesar said the former India opener has proven himself as a white-ball coach but still needs time and experience in red-ball cricket.""Gautam Gambhir is a good coach in white-ball cricket because he has been successful. He could become the Ranji Trophy coach, and he should talk to the coaches who have coached in the Ranji Trophy about how you build a team in red ball cricket.Right now, the Indian team is weak in Test cricket. This is the reality. It's not that strong. It will take time. When you retire three big players, it becomes difficult to keep the remaining players ready,"" the former England cricketer said.Panesar also underlined Virat Kohli’s absence in the longest format, stating that while India have managed without him in white-ball cricket, his impact is clearly missing in Tests.""In white-ball format, you won't miss Virat Kohli that much. But yes, in Test Cricket, it's evident that Virat Kohli is not there, and the team's intensity is lower.""The former left-arm spinner further claimed that Indian cricketers are not adequately prepared for red-ball cricket, arguing that the focus of young players is largely on securing IPL contracts rather than putting in the hard yards required in four-day cricket.""Indian players are not ready for Test Cricket. In India, players who perform well in T20 and ODI don't perform well in Test Cricket,"" he said.Highlighting systemic issues, Panesar added that the gap between domestic cricket and the national Test side remains wide.""The gap between Ranji Trophy and India's Test team is significant. The Ranji Trophy system is also very weak. The boys just want to play in IPL. They want to get a big contract. They want to play in T20I and ODI. It takes a lot of hard work in 4-day cricket. That's why they want to give less time,"" Panesar said.""They make more money in T20 cricket. They make less money in Test Cricket. But the reality is that the domestic cricket of the Ranji Trophy is very weak. It will take some time for India to make a comeback in Test cricket,"" he added.","Former England cricketer Monty Panesar has criticised India’s Test captain Shubman Gill.

Can Virat Kohli chase down Sachin Tendulkar's hundred hundreds?

Poll Do you think the pitch quality at MCG is suitable for Test cricket? Yes, it should support bowlers No, it should be more balanced It depends on the match conditions

NEW DELHI: The Melbourne Cricket Ground, long celebrated as one of the sport's grand theatres, became the stage for another uncomfortable debate about pitch quality after the Boxing Day Test ended inside two days, prompting biting sarcasm from batting great Sunil Gavaskar What was expected to be a five-day spectacle unraveled at alarming speed. All 20 wickets fell on the opening day as the ball swung extravagantly and jagged sharply off a surface that offered uneven bounce and relentless movement. The carnage continued on day two, and by the evening session England had sealed a four-wicket win — their first Test victory in Australia since January 2011.In total, 36 wickets fell in just 142 overs. The rapid finish not only shocked fans but also delivered a heavy financial blow. Cricket Australia chief executive Todd Greenberg estimated the shortfall from the Melbourne Test at over AUD 10 million, compounding the damage after the Perth Test earlier in the series also finished within two days. It is the first time in 129 years that the same series has produced multiple two-day Tests.MCG head curator Matt Page admitted he was in a “state of shock” watching the mayhem unfold. Ten millimetres of grass had been left on the pitch, a decision that produced excessive seam movement and bounce, making survival with the bat a near-impossible task.Gavaskar, however, cut through the official explanations with trademark wit and sting. Reacting to yet another short-lived Test in Australia, he pointed to the irony of the Perth pitch earlier in the series receiving a glowing assessment.“Another Test match in Australia has finished in less than two days of cricket,” Gavaskar wrote in his column for Sportstar. “The Australian Cricket Board's CEO says it is not good business and most, if not all, cricket fans in the sub-continent (read India) are screaming blue murder about the quality of the pitch given in Melbourne.”He expressed astonishment at the earlier verdict on the Perth surface, adding: “They were astonished when the first Test match pitch in Perth was given a very good rating by the match referee Ranjan Madugalle.”Turning his attention to Melbourne, Gavaskar sharpened the blade further. “Since there is a new match referee, Jeff Crowe, for the Melbourne and Sydney Test matches, the rating could be different,” he wrote. “Since 36 wickets fell in the Melbourne Test instead of 32 in Perth, Crowe might drop the word ‘very' from the ‘very good' that Madugalle gave for the Perth pitch and rate the MCG pitch as good. Surprises never cease, of course, so we may get another rating. ”With tongue firmly in cheek, Gavaskar also toyed with Crowe's background. “Since he is a Kiwi and we all know that the Oz vs Kiwi clashes often have more passion in them than an Ashes contest… will the Kiwi in him want to let the Aussies have it?” he asked, before adding that Crowe now lives in the USA and “the passion may have calmed down a bit.”He concluded by defending the MCG turf staff while skewering perceived double standards. “The curators… may make a human error and get it slightly wrong,” Gavaskar wrote, but they are not treated like the “devious” groundsmen in India. “Tut tut,” he signed off — a gentle phrase, delivered with an unmistakable bite.",Sunil Gavaskar criticises MCG pitch after Boxing Day Test ends in two days.

Why Mumbai's iconic Azad Maidan is no longer safe for cricket | Bombay Sport Exchange

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Anil Kumble has shed light on the evolving role of Afghanistan leg-spinner Rashid Khan for the Gujarat Titans ahead of the 2026 Indian Premier League season, pointing to a strategic shift in how the franchise may use its premier spinner.Speaking on the ‘TATA IPL Auction Review’, JioStar expert Kumble said Rashid’s workload will need careful management, particularly alongside bowlers such as Sai Kishore. He also felt that all-round options like Rahul Tewatia and Washington Sundar could play a bigger role for Gujarat Titans in IPL 2026.""I think the novelty of Rashid Khan has worn off a little. There are many similar bowlers available now, so he is not as intimidating as before. His workload has to be managed more, along with bowlers like Sai Kishore. Even Rahul Tewatia and Washington Sundar can contribute more for GT this season,"" Kumble said.Former India all-rounder and JioStar expert Irfan Pathan also weighed in on Gujarat Titans’ decision to place faith in West Indies veteran Jason Holder ""Their bet on Jason Holder is interesting. He is an amazing bowler with the new ball, but his batting has improved, especially his six-hitting abilities.GT has put a lot of faith in that. Their main strength is their top three batters: Shubman Gill, Sai Sudharsan, and Jos Buttler. How they use Washington Sundar will be important, as his batting has gotten better too. The role of Glenn Phillips, or whoever plays at number four or five, will also be very big,"" Pathan said.Meanwhile, former India opener and JioStar expert Abhinav Mukund explained Gujarat Titans’ preference for left-arm pacers and all-rounders like Holder while shaping their squad for the upcoming season.""Gujarat Titans love fast bowlers, especially left-arm pacers like Prithviraj Yarra and Luke Wood. Ashok Sharma had a great Syed Mushtaq Ali season. But Jason Holder is there because they need someone to bat and finish innings at number six or seven, and bowl a couple of overs. They want someone to finish at the death. The team is so strong at the top that they felt they needed this. Last year, GT often did not play all four overseas players. So maybe if Glenn Phillips is fit, he plays in the middle order and Jason Holder finishes. Overall, they still look like a brilliant side. They have the best young Indian talent. I don't know who will control them on the bench. Good luck to Parthiv Patel and Ashish Nehra,"" Mukund said.","Former India captain Anil Kumble shed light on the evolving role of Afghanistan leg-spinner Rashid Khan for the Gujarat Titans.

Kenny Stills believes “Trump curse” played a part in Detroit’s late-season setback



What looked like a season heading toward meaningful January football has ended with frustration, questions, and a sense of opportunity wasted. The Detroit Lions’ campaign unraveled at the wrong time, and their 23-10 loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Christmas night finally closed the door on any postseason possibility while clearing the way for the Green Bay Packers to secure their place instead.The defeat was not an isolated stumble. It capped a worrying run of form in which Detroit simply could not hold its footing during the most demanding stretch of the schedule. Performances dipped, execution failed, and the Lions repeatedly found themselves second best. By the time Minnesota controlled Thursday night’s contest, it felt like the end result had been building for weeks.As the disappointment settled, an unexpected angle resurfaced online. Former Miami Dolphins receiver Kenny Stills revisited an earlier moment from Detroit’s season, sharing a clip of Amon-Ra St. Brown’s celebration from the Lions’ convincing win over Washington. Stills suggested that the celebration invited bad luck, even calling it a “Trump curse” on Twitter, sparking debate rather than being brushed aside as harmless commentary.That celebration once symbolized Detroit’s swagger, coming in a game they controlled comfortably.What followed tells a harsher story: only two wins in seven outings, momentum gone, confidence shaken, and ultimately the playoff push slipping away. Supporters can joke about superstition, but the real issue lies in how quickly standards dropped when pressure intensified.Against Minnesota, the shortcomings were clear. Drives failed to sustain, defensive gaps appeared at crucial moments, and the Vikings showed greater composure in decisive situations. It wasn’t a curse that ended Detroit’s season; it was a mix of stalled offense, lapses in execution, and timing that worked entirely against them.Now the Lions head into the offseason knowing this one will hurt. A promising position dissolved into a late-season slide that cost them everything they were chasing. The challenge ahead is not about addressing online narratives; it is about restoring consistency, rediscovering belief, and ensuring a collapse like this does not define the group moving forward.",Kenny Stills believes “Trump curse” played a part in Detroit’s late-season setback.

Quinton Rampage Jackson gifts son Elijah Jackson a rare Audi R8 after keeping childhood promise

Quinton Rampage Jackson made Christmas very special this year. The former UFC light heavyweight champion surprised his youngest son with a gift many people only dream about. Just days before Christmas, Jackson shared that he spent about $275,000 on a car for his son, Elijah “Rampage” Jackson. This was not a last-minute idea. Jackson said it was a promise he made when his son was very young. Years later, he finally kept that promise.The moment quickly went viral after Jackson posted it on X. Fans saw a proud father and a shocked son sharing a quiet but powerful moment together. The gift stood out not just because of the price, but because of the meaning behind it. Jackson did not buy something for himself. He chose to reward his son and celebrate family during the holidays. That message made the story travel fast across social media.Jackson revealed the surprise on X, where he posted a video from his garage. In the clip, Elijah Jackson walks in and sees a black Audi R8 waiting for him. He pauses, clearly stunned, and asks if the car is really his.Jackson replies with a calm smile and says, “Like I promised you when you were a kid.” He then reminds his son to drive carefully, warning him that the car is very fast.After that, he hands over the keys.The Audi R8 is one of the brand’s top sports cars. It comes with a V10 engine and a carbon-fiber body. According to Edmunds, newer Audi R8 models can cost up to $275,000, depending on features. Older versions can be cheaper, but Jackson did not share the exact model.Audi officially ended R8 production in March 2024, as confirmed by Audi. That has made existing models more valuable among car lovers.Jackson shares Elijah with his former wife, Yuki Imoto. He is also a father to other children, including daughter Naname Nakia Jackson. Still, this moment was fully about a father and son.Later, Jackson also spoke about his income today. During a livestream, he said streaming has paid him more than fighting ever did. “I have been streaming for eight months, and I made more than I did in my fighting career,” he said. He added that sponsors support him more now because more people watch his streams.Quinton Rampage Jackson streams travel videos, home life clips, and content with other creators. He also shared that having two kids in college pushed him to focus on streaming full-time. The success of that move made this Christmas promise possible.Also Read: Ex-UFC Champion Sean O’Malley Flags Trouble For Dana White As The White House Card Faces Major Concern","Quinton Rampage Jackson surprised his son with a rare Audi R8 for Christmas.

Ex-Rockstar developer has a GTA 6 warning: ‘If the game is delayed again…',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/ex-rockstar-developer-has-a-gta-6-warning-if-the-game-is-delayed-again/articleshow/126189019.cms,"Former Rockstar developer Mike York warns that further delays to Grand Theft Auto 6 could significantly diminish public interest. He believes Rockstar is prioritizing polish to meet high expectations, but prolonged waits risk alienating fans. York anticipates a November 2026 release, citing it as an optimal period for sales.

“We’ve been waiting so long for

GTA 6

already that if there was to be another delay, people will probably stop caring about its release even more. If

Rockstar

Games delay GTA 6 again then the hype around the game will die down almost completely. Right now, nobody is searching for GTA 6. Everyone knows there’s no news, there’s nothing to talk about… There’s a point to where you delay something so much that you start to make people angry.”

“People aren’t itching to find new details or a latest leak anymore, they’re over it. They are thinking, ‘it will come out when it comes out’, as they’re so burnt out from thinking it will come out soon and then it doesn’t… And then they’re like, ‘OK, whatever…’”

Why Ex-Rockstar developer thinks Rockstar has been delaying the game

“If I know Rockstar Games, and I know the guys over there, one of the reasons for the delay in releasing GTA 6 is because they’re trying to make it look as best as it can possibly be. They’re polishing stuff.

I don’t think they’re completely finished with the game, given how much is on the line and how big everyone’s expectations are for it.”

“I think the game will be released in November 2026 as it’s a good time for the game to come out for Rockstar for multiple reasons to sell video games. If you want to sell a big amount of video games then that’s the perfect time for GTA 6 to come out with it being a month before Christmas. Usually companies only delay these things once or twice when they need to, so I think it will come out around that time,”





Former Rockstar Games developer Mike York has a critical warning for the Take-Two-owned gaming studio. He has warned that the hype and public interest around Grand Theft Auto 6 will “die down” almost completely if the game faces any more delays. In an interview with Esports Insider (as seen by Dexerto), York said:York cited fan reactions showing growing frustration, with some saying they “don’t even care anymore” because repeated delays keep letting them down.he added.The game’s delay from May to November 2026 even caused anger in Poland’s parliament, with an opposition lawmaker calling the postponement “a huge scandal” during a session.Explaining Rockstar’s reason behind GTA 6 delay, York said:York believes Rockstar is aiming to meet very high internal standards and may not feel it has reached that level yet.York noted.Till date, Rockstar has released two official trailers of the highly anticiapted game which have confirmed that GTA 6 is set in a modern Vice City. The game will feature dual protagonists, deeper RPG systems, realistic physics, new heist tools and a more evolving open world.","Former Rockstar developer Mike York warns that further delays to Grand Theft Auto 6 could significantly diminish public interest.

Vince Zampella, the gaming industry titan behind the blockbuster Call of Duty franchise and leader of the Battlefield series, died Sunday in a single-vehicle crash on Angeles Crest Highway near Los Angeles.

NAGPUR: Magnus Carlsen is nothing but the undisputed king of 64 squares. A day after he suffered a seventh-round defeat to Russia’s Vladislav Artemiev, the fighter in him emerged on Sunday and he won five successive games to take the world rapid crown for a record sixth time in Doha, Qatar.At the end of the 12th and penultimate round in the World Rapid Championships, Carlsen jumped to sole lead with 10 points and within just touching distance from regaining the title he had lost last year, while Artemiev and Hans Niemann trailed him jointly on nine points.In the final round, Carlsen played out a quiet 24-move draw with Anish Giri to emerge champion with 10.5 points.India No.1s Arjun Erigaisi and Koneru Humpy won bronze medals in the open and women’s sections. While two-time champion Humpy secured her fourth medal, Arjun became only the second Indian after Viswanathan Anand to register a podium finish in the open section. Anand had won the rapid title in 2017.Arjun had missed the medal by half a point in the last three editions. In Doha, too, he was almost out of medal contention after losing the 11th round, but bounced back to win the penultimate and the last round.As luck would have it, the joint second leaders drew, and Arjun found himself on the podium by just a half-point margin in the tiebreak. Arjun, who was joint third with 8.5 points after the 12th round, outclassed Aleksandr Shimanov of Russia to finish joint second on 9.5 points with Artemiev, Niemann, and Leinier Dominguez Perez.Both Artemiev and Niemann drew their last games with Wesley So and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, respectively, while Perez defeated young Yagiz Kaan, who had stunned Arjun in the 11th round.Artemiev took the silver with a tie-break score of 105.5. Based on his Buchholz tie-break score of 98, Arjun prevailed over the other two.Russian Grandmaster Aleksandra Goryachkina clinched the women’s title after beating China's Zhu Jiner in a play-off.It was heart-break for defending champion Koneru Humpy. The India No. 1 had tied with Jiner and Goryachkina on 8.5 points at the end of the 11th and final round, but her poor tie-break score meant the 38-year-old had to be content with bronze medal.With a better Buchholz tiebreak score of 72.5-71.5 than Humpy’s 69, Jiner and Goryachkina entered the play-off to decide the winner.As per Fide rules, in case of a tie for the first position, only the top two players in women will advance to a playoff — two blitz games — whereas in the open section all those in a tie will enter the play-off.If only the same open rule had been applied to the women!",Magnus Carlsen and Aleksandra Goryachkina take World Rapid titles in Doha.

The Indian-American community raised the issue of growing online hatred against India and Indians and sought answers from Elon Musk's X as to why such hate comments are being allowed on the platform. American journalist Matt Forney recently called for violence against Indians and Indian places of worship -- veiled as a prediction-- and deleted the post. Now, social media commentators, apparently from the US, are attacking Vivek Ramaswamy 's children because of the GOP leader's Indian origin as a massive movement against Ramaswamy is taking place inside MAGA.A post with photos of Vivek Ramaswamy's children went viral with the Indian-hating commentator saying that Ramaswamy who bashes American children is miserable in raising his own children who have 'awful facial expressions'. ""They are feral,"" the disrespectful post said.Matt Forney chimed in with his filthy post, where he said Vivek Ramaswamy probably threatens his children that he would smack them like a ""brown parent"".While Ramaswamy is facing strong resistance from inside the MAGA for his upcoming Governor election, many commentators called out the targeting of his children. But haters, provoked by Nick Fuentes, are crossing all limits now.Indian-origin techie Jitin Pillai reacted to the attack on Ramaswamy's children and said there is no coming back from this level of low. He said the Indian community does not even have as much presence or influence in the US as it is made out to be. But this level of hatred was unthinkable a year ago, he said.""I know the natural instinct of many Indian Americans is to dismiss this outright, and at times even refuse to acknowledge this rising hatred under the garb of some freedom of expression. I hope this cohort is able to see the slope vs intercept. If there is a time for course correction, it’s now. Democrats will not always be your friends,"" Pillai said.Neither Ramaswamy nor his campaign commented on the targeting of his children yet.","Indian-American community raised the issue of growing online hatred against India and Indians.

British TV host and commentator Narinder Kaur posted a video from New Delhi, India, in which she was surprised to see how a country with such a small Christian population (2%) celebrates Christmas “like it’s the majority. ”Kaur shared the video on X from Delhi, alongside footage which appeared to show Christmas decorations in hotels and malls, including trees, Santa figures, and staff wearing Santa hats.In her post, she claimed that if British people celebrated Diwali the same way in UK, the ""right-wing"" would become angry: “Around 2% of the population of India is Christian, yet they are celebrating Xmas like its the majority! Its amazing! Respectful. Staff all have Santa hats on..can you imagine uk hotel staff wearing turbans during Diwali? The right-wing would have a meltdown.”She called the celebration respectful and said everywhere she travelled in India, people were in the festive spirit: “Everywhere I’ve gone—hotels, restaurants—they’re celebrating Christmas big time in India,” she says. “Now I think 2% of the population of India is Christian, but they’re still celebrating, respecting.”Kaur also said that such displays in India are happening “without any fear.” She added that there is no sense in people complaining that Christians or “white people are taking over.”The comments divided the internet. Many social media users said Kaur was flattening complex religious and cultural differences between India and the UK. Some also challenged her comparison between Christmas decorations and religious dress, while others noted that Christmas in India is often treated as a commercial or seasonal event rather than a religious one. Several users said her remarks felt needlessly provocative and played into ongoing culture-war arguments.One user wrote: ""I think you make a good point. However, I would never wear a turban during Diwali because I would feel that it would not be respectful.
