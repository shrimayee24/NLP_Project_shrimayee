As NHL free agency approaches, Winnipeg Jets winger Nikolaj Ehlers is quickly becoming one of the most sought-after names on the market. After 10 seasons in Manitoba, the Danish forward has reportedly told the Jets he intends to test free agency on July 1—news that has sparked interest from multiple franchises across the league.NHL trade rumors are swirling as Winnipeg Jets forward Nikolaj Ehlers prepares to hit free agency, drawing serious interest from contenders like the Hurricanes, Kings, and Sharks ahead of July 1.“Hearing Nikolaj Ehlers has informed the Jets he will go to free agency on July 1.

Among them, the Carolina Hurricanes—valued at $1.25 billion by Forbes—are reportedly “very serious” about signing Ehlers, according to Friedman, who spoke during Oilers Now with Bob Stauffer.“I think there are definitely some things in motion,” Friedman said. “I’ve heard Carolina is very serious about Ehlers, but I also think he could end up just about anywhere.

The Kings are exploring multiple roster moves, while the Sharks, facing pressure to reach the salary cap floor, could view Ehlers as a strategic addition despite their ongoing rebuild.“Some teams are looking at shorter-term fits,” Friedman noted. “Then you’ve got teams like San Jose who need to hit the cap floor. So, Ehlers could have multiple types of suitors. ... I’ve also heard L.A. has a few irons in the fire.”Despite Nikolaj Ehlers' intention to explore options, Winnipeg GM Kevin Cheveldayoff hasn’t given up hope.

A nickname born out of early dominance on the ice

Acceptance of a name that would define a legacy

Panthers Win Game 5 to Take 3-2 Lead in Stanley Cup Final | NHL on TNT

Wayne Gretzky is a name synonymous with greatness in the NHL , but the origin of his famous nickname, ""The Great One,"" has a surprising twist. During a recent segment on NHL on TNT’s Face Off, Wayne Gretzky shared that his father, Walter Gretzky, was not a fan of the moniker when it first appeared during his youth hockey days.Long before the Great One, Wayne Gretzky shattered NHL records, he was just a ten-year-old prodigy from Brantford, Ontario, netting an unbelievable 400 goals in a single season. A reporter from the London Free Press came to profile the young phenom.At the conclusion of the article, the journalist proposed a fitting nickname: “The Great One,” drawing inspiration from legends like “Mr. Hockey” and “The Golden Jet.”“They said, ‘We should just call him The Great One,’” Gretzky recalled. “Well, my dad tried to kill that right away — it just kept coming back.”Gretzky believed such a title placed unnecessary pressure on his young son. He didn’t want Wayne to bear the weight of premature hype. But despite his father's objections, the nickname gained traction and became permanently linked to the budding superstar.Over time, the family had no choice but to embrace the label.“Finally, I just was like, ‘Well, we’re going to have to live with it,’” Wayne Gretzky admitted. And live with it he did.By the time he retired in 1999, Wayne Gretzky had not only fulfilled but exceeded the expectations that came with such a grand title. With 894 goals, 2,857 career points, and 61 NHL records, “The Great One” wasn’t just a nickname—it became his rightful legacy.Switching gears to current NHL action, Gretzky also shared his thoughts on the Edmonton Oilers' Game 5 loss to the Florida Panthers. “Right from the get-go, Florida played a really smart, intelligent road game,” he said, noting that Edmonton looked “cautious” and “on their heels” early on.Also Read: No longer Canadian: Wayne Gretzky’s Canadian identity questioned after Donald Trump friendship sparks controversy Gretzky’s nickname, “The Great One,” once resisted by his father, ultimately came to represent not just early talent, but a lifetime of excellence, From a childhood nickname to a storied NHL career, Gretzky’s story remains one of humility, brilliance, and enduring greatness.","Wayne Gretzky's famous nickname, ""The Great One,"" originated from a profile of his youth hockey dominance.

Toronto Maple Leafs era ends as Mitch Marner moves on



Mitch Marner's impending departure from the Toronto Maple Leafs, added an emotional twist to the 2025 offseason. As for many years, Marner has been a mainstay in Toronto's top lines, producing two-way play of the highest calibre. His farewell, a nostalgic media appearance. Also with past-tense references, fans and analysts believe the writing is on the wall.Mitch Marner’s expected departure is more than just a roster change. It necessitates a comprehensive reassessment of Toronto’s structure, identity, and short-term objectives. The club now has a rare opportunity to reset over $10 million in cap space and recalibrate a roster that has long underperformed in the playoffs, especially in high-pressure postseason moments where offensive depth and defensive reliability often faltered.Trade and free agent speculation will dominate the coming weeks, with potential targets like Elias Lindholm or Martin Necas being floated but nothing can truly replace the consistency and chemistry Marner brought to the Maple Leafs lineup.What truly made Marner’s farewell resonate was his candid reflection on the off-ice toll of playing in Toronto. He spoke of the strain on his family, especially his wife Stephanie, as the hockey-mad city often directed its frustrations toward him during playoff losses.The stress of being a high-profile figure in a market as intense as Toronto likely played a large part in his decision, and the opportunity to play elsewhere, in a quieter market like Anaheim or Seattle. This could bring the balance and freedom his personal life demands.For Marner, this isn’t just a hockey decision, it’s a personal pivot aimed at preserving both performance and well-being in the next chapter of his NHL career.Mitch Marner’s career with the Maple Leafs was more than numbers. It was connection, growth, and at times, heartbreak, from a hometown hero to a polarizing figure under pressure.

Rasmus Andersson could offer the Toronto Maple Leafs the right-handed defensive stability they urgently need

The Toronto Maple Leafs are at a crossroads again. Another painful playoff exit, a likely Mitch Marner departure, and a restless fanbase are heavy burdens on the accused to recalibrate. But the offseason has come with opportunities and perhaps redemption. The Leafs are now refocusing on the defensive front, and Rasmus Andersson of Calgary looks like the prime candidate for trade who would bring a new face to Toronto's blue line and a couple of seconds of stability to a team in transition.The Maple Leafs' playoff shortcomings, once again, have been their inability to stop teams that have applied high offensive pressure, like the Florida Panthers. They made the series last seven games, and yet the Game 3 collapse was a testament to how exposed they are in the right-side defense position. With Tanev and Carlo providing the gritty presence the Leafs would love to have, recent internal evaluations in Toronto further cemented the grasp that there needed to be a defenseman who has leadership qualities and a very good hockey sense, traits that Andersson has always displayed in his career.Team sources suggest that if this deal is going anywhere, it might turn into a multi-asset affair prior to the draft. The spotlight now shifts to Flames veteran Rasmus Andersson: skilled, tough, and the right-shot defenseman with nine seasons under his belt.According to Kypreos, starting from the trade deadline, there has been interest shown by Toronto in Andersson, and that interest may soon be rekindled. With three years having passed without making it to the Playoffs for Calgary since the exit of Matthew Tkachuk, the Flames are at their crossroads. With young goalie Dustin Wolf heralded as a new face of the franchise, Calgary may want to shed some valuable veterans, and Andersson, with just one year left on a deal worth $4.55 million, fits the bill perfectly.An Andersson contract could be beneficial for both teams. For Toronto, this would be a low-risk and high-reward option, therefore not interfering with any long-term cap considerations. Having a whopping $25 million plus in cap space with major decisions on John Tavares and Matthew Knies looming, the best course of action might be to acquire Andersson for prospects and picks. He brings scoring from the back end at an elite level, but he also has the grit and hockey sense the Maple Leafs would be desperate for when it comes to facing playoff competition.Also Read: Calgary Flames blueliner Rasmus Andersson appointed Captain of Team Sweden at 2025 World Championship If the Maple Leafs are serious about ending their Stanley Cup drought, acquiring Rasmus Andersson might be a savvy move.

It appears that Irving has already welcomed Cooper, long before their meeting in the Mavericks locker room.Just days after hearing his name called at the 2025 NBA Draft, Cooper Flagg was already soaking in the atmosphere of his future home court from a suite at the American Airlines Center. The Duke standout, who went to the Dallas Mavericks, was spotted attending Friday night’s WNBA matchup between the Dallas Wings and Indiana Fever. But the real highlight came when he met one of the city’s biggest names, Kyrie Irving.Flagg and Irving crossed paths during the Wings game in a suite above the action. The brief but meaningful exchange was captured in a video posted by the Mavericks. It’s a fitting start to what Dallas fans hope becomes a strong on-court relationship.Both players share notable similarities. They were each selected first overall in the NBA Draft, and both proudly represent Duke University on their basketball résumés.Now, they’ll share the Mavericks locker room. Of course, it would take a while for them to share the floor. According to ESPN’s Shams Charania, Kyrie Irving is expected to be sidelined until at least January 2026 after tearing his ACL in March.Irving recently signed a new three-year, $119 million deal with Dallas, finalized just one day before the team drafted Flagg.While Flagg’s future was the center of excitement off the court, the action on it nearly delivered a dramatic finish. The Dallas Wings staged a fierce comeback after trailing the Indiana Fever by 20 points, ultimately falling short 94–86.Rookie sensation Paige Bueckers stole the show for Dallas, tallying 27 points, six assists, and zero turnovers in 36 commanding minutes. Her performance lit up the arena, but it was her courtside moment with Kyrie Irving that went viral. Irving, sitting courtside with his daughter, greeted Bueckers after the buzzer.“He’s been my favorite player forever now,” Bueckers had said during her rookie presser in April. “I’m super excited to be in the same city as him. Hope I can learn a lot from him.”The WNBA’s official X account captured the exchange with the caption, “That Dallas love. Paige and Kyrie link up after the Fever-Wings game!”Also Read: Kyrie Irving fires up after Paige Bueckers hits buzzer-beater three for Wings against Clark-less Fever Flagg’s handshake and Bueckers’ courtside moment showed the unity in the city’s basketball divisions.","Cooper Flagg, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, met Kyrie Irving at the Dallas Wings vs Indiana Fever game.

Poll Should Rohit Sharma consider returning to Test cricket after his ODI commitments? Yes, he should return. No, he should focus on ODIs.

Gambhir & Agarkar Plot at the Birmingham Nets | Key Talks Ahead of 2nd Test vs England

NEW DELHI: Former India Test captain and current ODI skipper Rohit Sharma , who recently retired from red-ball cricket at the age of 38, was seen vacationing in Milan even as Team India battles England in the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy five-Test series. His successor, Shubman Gill , came under fire following India’s five-wicket defeat in the series opener at Headingley — his first match as Test captain.Rohit, now focused solely on One-Day Internationals, shared glimpses of his holiday in Italy on social media, including a photo of the iconic Duomo di Milano cathedral. His next cricketing assignment is scheduled for August, when India tours Bangladesh for a three-match ODI series starting on August 17.Meanwhile, India endured a frustrating loss at Headingley, where England chased down a steep target of 371 runs in the fourth innings — their second-highest successful chase in Tests and the highest ever against India.Former England captain Nasser Hussain, speaking on Sky Sports, was critical of Gill's captaincy debut.""I saw someone finding his way. He didn't quite have that on-field aura of Rohit and Kohli. I thought he followed the ball a lot and was reactive rather than proactive.When Rohit and Kohli captained, you looked down and immediately knew who was in charge. In this game, I saw two or three captains — captaincy by committee,"" Hussain said.England’s victory was anchored by Ben Duckett’s explosive 149, aided by Joe Root’s unbeaten 53 and debutant Jamie Smith’s steady 44 not out.Despite India boasting five individual centuries across both innings — with Shubman Gill, KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and Rishabh Pant all reaching triple figures — the team failed to convert that dominance into a win.While highlighting Gill's leadership struggles, Hussain also noted that the young captain wasn’t solely to blame for the loss.""India lost the match because of two things Gill couldn't control — dropped catches and batting collapses,"" he said, referencing India's sloppy fielding and key middle-order failures.India had England at vulnerable positions — 276/5 in the first innings and 333/4 in the second — but failed to capitalise. Crucial batting collapses saw India lose 7 wickets for 41 runs in their first innings and 6 for 31 in the second, ultimately swinging the match in England’s favour.","Former India Test captain Rohit Sharma is vacationing in Milan, Italy.

Strategic Implications of Lonzo Ball

Thehave made a notable move ahead of NBA free agency, acquiring point guardfrom the Chicago Bulls in exchange for forward Isaac Okoro. This trade marks Ball’s fourth NBA franchise and signals a strategic shift for both teams as they prepare for the upcoming season.- The Cavaliers receive Lonzo Ball , a 27-year-old guard and former No. 2 overall pick, who has struggled with injuries in recent years, missing two full seasons (2022–2024) due to persistent knee problems.- The Bulls acquire Isaac Okoro, a 24-year-old wing known for his defensive upside, who had seen his role diminish in Cleveland after the team’s midseason acquisition of De’Andre Hunter.- Ball returned to the court last season, playing 35 games and averaging 7.6 points, 3.4 rebounds, and 3.3 assists on 36.6% shooting from the field.- His contract includes $10 million for the upcoming year, with a club option for 2026–27, giving the Cavaliers valuable salary cap flexibility.- Ball is expected to serve as a quality backup point guard behind Darius Garland, addressing a key weakness exposed during the Cavs’ recent postseason run. His playmaking and perimeter defense could also allow him to share the floor with Donovan Mitchell when needed.- Okoro, a former top-5 pick, averaged 6.1 points per game last season and is set to earn $11 million this year.- The Bulls see Okoro as a young, defensive-minded wing who could still develop into a reliable 3-and-D player.- For the Cavaliers , this trade is a calculated risk: Ball’s injury history is a concern, but his upside as a facilitator and defender fits Cleveland’s needs, especially with Garland’s health uncertain and Ty Jerome’s future in doubt.- For the Bulls, moving Ball’s contract and acquiring a younger, healthy wing aligns with their ongoing roster refresh after losing other veterans like DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine.Also read: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/nba-trade-news-devin-booker-close-to-historic-150-million-extension-with-the-phoenix-suns/articleshow/122122145.cms The Cavaliers hope that Ball’s addition will solidify their backcourt depth and boost their chances in an Eastern Conference that remains wide open due to injuries to other contenders. If Ball can stay healthy, he could be a difference-maker for Cleveland’s playoff ambitions. The Bulls, meanwhile, add a promising young piece as they continue to reshape their roster for the future.","Cleveland Cavaliers acquire point guard Lonzo Ball in exchange for forward Isaac Okoro.

After his record NHL season and $64 million deal, Sam Bennett and Zoe Zeleny restate their commitment to ‘Benny’s Buddies’

Big money and star power. Sam Bennett has come to a real inflection point by signing an eight-year, $64 million contract with the Florida Panthers that runs through the 2032-33 season, almost doubling his existing cap hit and marking his evolution to the franchise player. The Panthers are rejoicing since they are able to hold onto a playoff hero, but Bennett looks beyond 'hockey'. Together with fiancée Zoe Zeleny, he is already planning how to leverage this success for their off-ice cause, meaning his reach now extends way beyond the ice.This contract extension could not have been better timed. Fresh off his second straight Stanley Cup win and Conn Smythe Trophy, Bennett set pen to paper on an eight-year, $64 million contract extension. The Florida Panthers winger will now be taking home $8 million a year for his services until the 2032-33 season, vastly overshadowing his old cap hit of $4.425 million.Bennett's 2024-25 stat line was peak Bennett: 51 points; 25 goals, 26 assists, and seven power-play goals occur rarely. The playoffs, however, sealed his reputation. Performing in clutch moments, he set an NHL record by scoring 13 goals on the road and racking up 15 goals in total, earning him MVP honors.But off the ice, it was something very personal that defined what this contract was all about. On a recent Zoom call, he was wearing a ""Benny's Buddies"" cap, referring to the charitable foundation which he and his fiancée, Zoe Zeleny, started. The two started that program to help children and families in the local community, and this new deal will allow them to do so on a much bigger scale.According to Panthers TV reporter Katie Engleson, Bennett said, “That was one of the first things me and my fiance talked about. We get to continue Benny’s Buddies.” The quote not only speaks to the excitement surrounding the contract but also to the couple's commitment to turning professional success into action.Also Read: Rasmus Andersson trade buzz: Toronto Maple Leafs eyeing a $27 million veteran to fix defensive woes The $64 million contract for Bennett guarantees much more apart from just his tenure with the Panthers-the investment continues to hold a bit of the commitment Brennan and Zoe have retained for the community.

James Harden faces lawsuit from Houston party incident while Los Angeles Clippers await his decision

James Harden may be lighting up Paris Fashion Week with style and swagger, but trouble is brewing behind the scenes. As fans obsess over his bold fashion statements, a serious lawsuit tied to an incident at his Houston home has surfaced. And just days before a critical decision with the Los Angeles Clippers, the timing couldn’t be more intense.On June 24, a lawsuit was lodged in Harris County, Texas, accusing James Harden of negligence following an alleged sexual assault that happened at his Houston home on New Year’s Day 2025. The plaintiff, Marisa Watley, alleges that she and two friends were drugged by Harden’s nephew, Justice Armani Blackburn, and that the security personnel at Buffalo did not prevent the assault or permit her friends to re-enter the house to assist her. The suit is asking for over $100,000 in damages and claims that Harden is vicariously liable due to the inaction of his security team.As legal issues hover, Harden grabbed attention with his fashionable look at Paris Fashion Week. He shared a photo with the caption “Paris Fashion Week, I went all Luther V I feel like Vandross #Uno,” he drew reactions ranging from 🐐 emojis to fashion praise. Fans implored him to return to Houston, with comments like “That jacket so 🔥” brightening up his feed.Simultaneously, teammates Kawhi Leonard and Russell Westbrook were noticed, making a cultural impact that for the moment overshadowed the courtroom stress.In the midst of the legal turmoil, Harden is faced with a crucial athletic decision that could shape his career. By June 29, he has to choose whether to pick up his $36.3 million player option for the 2025–26 season with the Clippers. After a 50-win season and a first-round playoff exit against the Denver Nuggets, the Clippers are banking on him opting out to pursue a longer-term contract. With four main players approaching or over 30, LA is eager to secure their veteran star before the free agency buzz intensifies.Also Read: “Day 45… this is some bull**” — Jayson Tatum Gets Real About How Tough Achilles Rehab Has Been At 35, Harden continues to be an essential offensive force — he averaged nearly 23 points, 9 rebounds, and 6 assists in 79 games, earning All-NBA recognition.

Jalen Williams on the insane female attention the NBA players get

Jalen Williams keeps focus on basketball

The Oklahoma City Thunder have won their maiden NBA championship, a victory that brings with it not only name, fame, and money — but also an increase in female attention. With million-dollar contracts and stardom reaching new heights, NBA players often find themselves vulnerable to situations that can go far beyond admiration. Some women go to extreme lengths, with a few even using the opportunity to deceive or exploit them. Jalen Williams, now a member of an NBA title-winning team, once opened up about this aspect of fame, speaking candidly about how players can be susceptible to the wrong kind of attention — and the consequences that may follow.In a 2023 appearance on the Don’t Trip We Got You podcast, Jalen Williams — popularly known as J-Dub — was asked if he had personally experienced any of those “crazy” situations involving women seeking the attention of NBA stars.“Me personally, no. I try and stay out the mix as far as… like girls… during the season,"" Williams responded.He said, ""I've seen some stuff just in general. Like I know girls be hanging out in the hallways and hotel rooms all the time and kind of do that just to see who they can get to come upstairs. They know your schedule and stuff, and you always get the random DMs like ‘fly me out.’”When the host pointed out that such attempts sometimes work, Williams explained why many young players fall into the trap.“You guys definitely see it, but like, that's the trap that I think a lot of—especially younger—guys fall into. You got girls at 2 a.m., 3 a.m., you’re already tired, you’re vulnerable. Just played a back-to-back. You might have had a good game. Then they’ll be at your hotel room like, ‘Take me upstairs, let’s go out to eat,’ blah blah blah,” he said.Williams called it “insane,” suggesting that such encounters have, at times, ended in theft or blackmail involving compromising photos. “There’s been all kinds of stuff. People get their wallets stolen, or they’ll take a picture of you while you’re asleep. So you always gotta be careful in that regard,” he added.Despite his rising popularity, Jalen Williams has kept his personal life extremely private. There have been no public confirmations of a relationship, and if he is dating someone, he's kept it well under wraps.As a result, the spotlight has remained firmly on his performance. In Game 7 of the NBA Finals, Williams scored 20 points along with four assists and four rebounds, becoming the second-highest contributor for the Oklahoma City Thunder behind Finals MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. After the win, Alexander called Williams a “once-in-a-lifetime player” — and it seems he just might be right.","The Oklahoma City Thunder have won their maiden NBA championship.

Poll Do you think Vanessa Bryant handled the pregnancy rumors well? Yes, very cleverly No, she should have addressed them directly

Met Gala Surprise: Rihanna Stuns With Baby Bump Reveal, A$AP Rocky Confirms It’s Baby No 3





After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant ’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip. No press release needed when you’ve got Rihanna energy with a direct middle finger gesture.The rumors had emerged out of nowhere, with some users pointing to photos allegedly showing a ""baby bump,"" though no timestamps or context were attached to those images. Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there’s been zero confirmation from her side—until now.In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa Bryant shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.“The only way to impress me, is by being a good person,” the quote read. “I don’t care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.”Adding one final touch to her trilogy of clapbacks, she posted another Rihanna meme, this one stating, “I’m not mean, I’m just not the one.”With the classic Rihanna memes, Vanessa showed that she is busy being a proud mom to her daughters while being the powerhouse of her business ventures. While she does not care about the rumor mill, her reaction explicitly showed that she is urging privacy.Vanessa Bryant, who shares four daughters with Kobe— Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and the late Gianna— has remained devoted to family and philanthropy. Most recently, she shared footage of a joyful family ski trip over the holidays, showing the tight-knit bond she maintains with her children.Vanessa and Kobe Bryant tied the knot in April 2001. Tragically, in January 2020, Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna lost their lives in a helicopter crash that also killed seven others. They were headed to Kobe’s Mamba Sports Academy for a youth basketball game when the accident occurred. Kobe was 41 at the time. The loss shook the sports world and left a lasting impact on fans, friends, and loved ones across the globe. Kobe has left a huge legacy to his name as well, he is considered one the of the elite NBA superstars of all time with astounding stats, records and intense playmaking abilities. His demise created a huge void in the NBA world as fans are still mourning his untimely passing.Since their passing, she’s kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work. Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Foundation in 2016, aiming to support young athletes. After his death, Vanessa renamed it the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in honor of both Kobe and Gianna. Today, the foundation helps underserved boys and girls in sports, pushing forward the mission they believed in. It's her way of carrying on their legacy with purpose and heart.Vanessa Bryant’s response was indeed witty and empowering as she hinted that she deserves privacy and reminded the world that while she may be a public figure, her peace and dignity aren’t up for debate, especially not over unfounded gossip. After the viral response via memes, Vanessa has seemingly closed the chapter as she did not extend the matter any further with any other comments about it afterwards.Days after shutting down the pregnancy rumor, Vanessa Bryant made a glowing courtside appearance with her daughters at the New York Liberty vs. Chicago Sky game. The WNBA shared a sweet clip showing Vanessa alongside Natalia, 22, Bianka, 8, and Capri, 5, all smiling and waving for the camera.Later, Vanessa uploaded an image of her in a restaurant, candidly posing as she waited for the food to be arrive. Considering the dress, it appears that the photograph was shot after her recent attendance in the game.Their family moment quickly caught fans’ attention online, adding a warm highlight to the evening. It was a rare and heartwarming public outing for the Bryant family, showing their strong support for women’s basketball. It was Vanessa's first public outing since she debunked the horrendous pregnancy rumors.Recently, Vanessa honored her husband Kobe's memory with a heartfelt Instagram post on Instagram, sharing a throwback photograph of the family with the NBA legend, ""Happy Fathers Day @kobebryant 💕 You are so missed.

Poll Will Praggnanandhaa become the next World Chess Champion? Yes, definitely! Maybe in the future. No, he won't. Unsure at this moment.

Dutch No.1 Grandmaster Anish Giri, 31, sparked conversation across the chess world on Friday with a tongue-in-cheek reaction to R Praggnanandhaa becoming the new World No.1 junior.“Chess juniors nowadays have to be at least U16, keeping track of U20 players is totally pointless,” Giri, who currently holds the live rating of 2748.0 and is world no. 10, wrote, hinting at how elite young talents are now already competing at the top of the senior world rankings.The remark came shortly after 19-year-old Praggnanandhaa’s remarkable victory at the UzChess Cup Masters 2025 in Uzbekistan, which propelled him to a live rating of 2778.3 — making him the World No.4 overall and officially India’s highest-rated chess player.He leapfrogged both World Champion D Gukesh (2776.6) and Arjun Erigaisi (2775.7), reshuffling the Indian chess hierarchy.Praggnanandhaa’s road to victory was nothing short of dramatic. Starting the final day behind both Nodirbek Abdusattorov and Javokhir Sindarov, he scored a crucial win over Abdusattorov in the last classical round to force a three-way tie.In the blitz tiebreaks, Praggnanandhaa showed nerves of steel, eventually winning the tournament in the second set of rapid games — his third major classical title of the year.Five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand applauded the youngster, stating, “This win seemed the least likely with just two rounds to go… An impressive demonstration of character.”With this triumph, Praggnanandhaa adds the UzChess Cup to his 2025 title haul, which already includes victories at the Tata Steel Chess Tournament and the Superbet Classic in Romania. He also recently finished runner-up at the Stepan Avagyan Memorial.While Giri’s comment playfully downplays the relevance of junior rankings, Praggnanandhaa’s performance makes one thing clear — the future of world chess is already here, and it’s thriving in India.",R Praggnanandhaa is the new World No.4 chess player.

Jasprit Bumrah Breathes Fire in the Nets | IND vs ENG 2nd Test Prep

As India gears up for the crucial second Test against England at Edgbaston, changes in the playing XI seem certain after the defeat in the series opener. One major talking point is the workload management of Jasprit Bumrah , who may be rested for this match. Besides him, a couple more players could be left out as the team management led by Gautam Gambhir looks for a stronger combination to level the series.Former Australia captain Michael Clarke has made his stance clear about one change. He feels wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav simply must play the next match. Speaking on the Beyond23 Podcast, Clarke said including Kuldeep is an “absolute no-brainer.”India’s bowlers struggled to make an impact at Headingley. While Bumrah stood out with his control and skill, his support cast of Mohammed Siraj, Ravindra Jadeja , Shardul Thakur and Prasidh Krishna could not maintain pressure or pick up wickets consistently. Clarke believes Kuldeep can solve that problem.“Bowling-wise, I do not want to single out anyone for blame, but India have to play Kuldeep Yadav. He is a genuine wicket-taker and could have made a big difference in the last Test,” Clarke said.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Clarke also pointed out that India sometimes focus too much on extending their batting depth, even if it means dropping their frontline spinner. He feels that in English conditions, picking bowlers who can take 20 wickets should be the priority.Echoing similar thoughts, former England batter Nick Knight has also backed Kuldeep’s inclusion. Knight said England’s aggressive batting approach could be tested by Kuldeep’s variations, especially if the Edgbaston pitch offers even a hint of turn. Knight believes Kuldeep’s presence could create match-defining moments if he hits his rhythm.The team announcement for the second Test is awaited, but calls for Kuldeep’s return are only growing louder.",Kuldeep Yadav must play in the second Test against England at Edgbaston.

Poll Will Yashasvi Jaiswal break Sunil Gavaskar's record for fastest Indian to 2,000 Test runs? Yes, he will definitely break it. No, he won't reach it in time.

Indian opener Yashasvi Jaiswal is on the brink of rewriting history as he stands just 97 runs away from becoming the fastest Indian to reach 2,000 Test runs. The young left-hander could break Sunil Gavaskar’s 49-year-old record when India face England in the second Test at Edgbaston starting July 2.Jaiswal’s consistency has been a huge positive for India during a tricky transition phase in the longest format. He recently showcased his class with a brilliant century in the first Test at Headingley, though his effort could not prevent India from slipping to a five-wicket defeat. Despite setting England a daunting 371-run target, India were stunned by Ben Duckett, Zak Crawley and Joe Root ’s calm chase, giving England a 1-0 lead in the five-match series.Jaiswal’s personal form, however, remains one of India’s biggest hopes as they aim to bounce back at Edgbaston. In just 20 Tests so far, he has scored 1,903 runs at an impressive average of 52.86.The current record for the fastest Indian to 2,000 Test runs belongs to batting legend Sunil Gavaskar, who reached the milestone in his 23rd Test back in 1976. Gavaskar went on to become the first cricketer ever to score 10,000 Test runs. Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag are next on the elite list, having crossed 2,000 runs in their 25th Tests.Quiz: Who's that IPL player?

Mohammed Siraj sharpens his batting at Edgbaston

If Shardul can start the bowling with Bumrah and Siraj can come in as one change, that will be great Ajinkya Rahane

Former India player Ajinkya Rahane has urged captain Shubman Gill to give more bowling opportunities to all-rounder Shardul Thakur , following India's 5-wicket loss to England in the opening Test at Headingley, Leeds. Thakur's performance was notably poor, scoring only five runs across two innings and claiming just two wickets in his limited 16 overs of bowling during the match.Rahane emphasised the crucial role of an all-rounder in the team through his YouTube channel, specifically addressing Thakur's underutilisation in the recent Test match.""I feel an all-rounder's role is very important. Shardul Thakur has been an experienced player and has done well in Test cricket overseas. I want to see more overs from Shardul. If the Indian team can use Shardul Thakur in a better way, that will be really great. Whatever I have seen with him, he can swing the ball both ways and is a wicket-taker. If Shardul can bowl the first change or even given the new ball he can swing it both ways,"" Rahane said.Rahane suggested specific bowling strategy changes to maximise Thakur's effectiveness on the field.""With the Dukes ball, it generally starts to behave after 10 or 12 overs. If Shardul can start the bowling with Bumrah and Siraj can come in as one change, that will be great.I would like to see Shardul bowling more overs. Give him that freedom, he will get you more wickets,"" he added.While commending Bumrah's performance, Rahane also highlighted the need for better support from other bowlers. ""Bumrah's five wicket-haul in the first innings was amazing. Apart from his five wickets what I liked about Bumrah was his intent. The way he was running in his run-up. His intensity throughout his bowling was amazing. The lines and lengths that he bowled. He was aggressive throughout in his bowling approach,"" Rahane stated.""What I would like to see is support from the other end. Bumrah is obviously bowling his attacking lengths but if he can support from Siraj and Prasidh, that will be great for him. You don't want Bumrah to go under pressure and start bowling too many overs and the pressure comes on the team. I want to see Siraj taking that responsibility and also Prasidh if he plays that second Test match,"" he concluded.","Former India player Ajinkya Rahane has urged captain Shubman Gill to give more bowling opportunities to all-rounder Shardul Thakur.

Why Florida Panthers GM Bill Zito was ignored for NHL GM of the Year despite back-to-back Stanley Cups

Is playoff success being undervalued in NHL honors?

Despite leading the Florida Panthers to three straight Stanley Cup Finals and winning two, general manager Bill Zito was once again denied the NHL ’s Jim Gregory GM of the Year Award. The decision to give the honor to Dallas Stars GM Jim Nill has sparked debate across the hockey world and left many fans questioning the league’s priorities.When Bill Zito was named general manager of the Florida Panthers in 2020, he inherited a team that had missed the playoffs in 7 of the last 10 seasons. Fast forward five years, and the Panthers are a full-blown dynasty—appearing in three consecutive Stanley Cup Finals and winning two championships under his leadership.Zito didn’t just patch holes. He made franchise-altering moves: trading for Matthew Tkachuk, investing in depth pieces, and hiring the right coaching staff. The Panthers’ rise has been nothing short of elite front office execution.And yet, the NHL’s Jim Gregory General Manager of the Year Award—meant to honor the top-performing executive—went to Dallas Stars GM Jim Nill for the third year in a row. Nill’s Stars did reach the Western Conference Final and posted a strong regular-season record (50-26-6), but fans were quick to point out that Zito’s playoff dominance carried more weight.“Zito was completely robbed,” one fan wrote under Frank Seravalli’s post.While regular-season consistency is important, building a Stanley Cup-winning roster is the true measure of a general manager’s impact. Zito’s ability to take a struggling franchise and turn it into the NHL’s most dominant postseason team in recent years should have been enough.Instead, his back-to-back Stanley Cup victories still weren’t enough to secure the Jim Gregory GM of the Year Award, highlighting a growing disconnect between postseason success and how the NHL rewards front-office leadership.Also Read: NHL trade news: Evander Kane heads to Vancouver Canucks after controversial season with Oilers But for Panthers fans and the hockey world watching closely, Zito’s impact is already etched in championship history",Florida Panthers GM Bill Zito was once again denied the NHL’s Jim Gregory GM of the Year Award.

Cooper Flagg is secretly making a stunning physical transformation as Matt MacKenzie showers praise on the new Dallas Mavericks star

Cooper Flagg has been earning widespread praise, and his name has been in the discussion among basketball fans. Now, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft has been in the headlines for a different reason as he has made an incredible physical transformation ahead of his pro debut. While many viewed him as a sure thing in the draft, Flagg and those closest to him never took the moment for granted. Behind the scenes, he’s been putting in serious work, and the results are already turning heads, most notably from his longtime personal trainer, Matt MacKenzie.After a deep run with Duke that ended in the Final Four, Flagg jumped into a two-phase training program in Los Angeles led by MacKenzie. The focus early on was about recovery and rebuilding, and then it shifted to fine-tuning his jump shot or refining his footwork. It.“We kind of broke the pre-draft process up into two phases… the first couple weeks were focused on just recovery because he had just come off a very long season playing for Duke, and then from there, it was building his body back up. So, Cooper ended up shaving nearly 10% body fat in the time that we were together, which is just unbelievable!” MacKenzie shared.The transformation has been both mental and physical. While most players in Flagg’s position would ease up knowing they’re the projected top pick, his inner circle says that’s never been his mindset.“He’s just wired differently,” Andy Bedard, Flagg’s former club coach, told Bangor Daily News in April. “In his mind when he’s working out, he’s not thinking that he’s already assumed the number one pick. I think that there’s a lot of his game that can continue to improve, and I think he’s just focused on doing that.”When Flagg officially declared for the draft, he described his lone college season as “probably the best year of my life.” MacKenzie called the decision one that Flagg “didn’t take lightly” but had “been looking forward to for a long time.”Now in Dallas, Flagg’s humility has followed him. At his introductory press conference, he told reporters, “I’m coming in just trying to learn and trying to get better every single day… I’m just trying to come in and be the best that I can be and just win at the highest level.”Of course, Flagg has been hailed as a generational talent, but he knows the NBA will bring a set of new challenges. Bedard pointed out that Flagg will need to adjust to the pace, physicality, and the pressure of being the league’s top rookie: “He’s gonna have to move his feet on defense quicker… and understand and quickly adapt to a 24-second shot clock… All the reads in the NBA game, it’s just different.”Also Read: Cooper Flagg shares courtside moment with Kyrie Irving for the first time at Dallas Wings vs Indiana Fever game just days after NBA Draft Still, Bedard hopes the rising star from Maine takes a moment to appreciate how far he’s come. “I’m hoping he has a few moments and he knows how many people he’s impacted… and that he maybe takes a second and just enjoys this and reflects back on how special this is.”","Cooper Flagg is secretly making a stunning physical transformation as Matt MacKenzie showers praise on the new Dallas Mavericks star.

Poll Should the selectors change their approach to player selection? Yes, they need to be more flexible No, the current strategy is fine

Former India opener and current head coach Gautam Gambhir is facing mounting pressure after Team India’s worrying run in Test cricket, despite continued success in white-ball formats including winning the Champions Trophy.The latest setback came at Headingley, where India, under new captain Shubman Gill , lost to England by five wickets. This adds to previous series defeats against New Zealand and Australia. India have now won only one of their last nine Tests under Gambhir’s watch. The stretch includes a 3-0 whitewash in New Zealand and a 3-1 loss to Australia that saw India surrender the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.This rough patch has coincided with a transition period marked by the retirements of senior players Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma from Test cricket following the Australia series loss. A fresh team under Gill’s leadership is still settling in, but the start in England has been disappointing.Former India batter Aakash Chopra analysed the situation on his YouTube channel, urging patience with Gill but warning of rising pressure on Gambhir. “There is a lot of pressure on Gautam Gambhir. The pressure is absolutely mounting. He has won two matches against Bangladesh and one against Australia, but we lost three to New Zealand, three to Australia and now one to England.He has been losing and losing.”Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Chopra stressed there are no excuses left. “The selectors have given everything the coaching staff has asked for. So, if this is the case, then you also need to deliver the results.

Dwyane Wade sends an emotional message to Marquette standout Kam Jones as he joins the Indiana Pacers



Kam Jones' NBA dream took a big leap forward on draft night when the Indiana Pacers selected him with the 38th overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft. While Jones was celebrating, he received a heartfelt note from Dwyane Wade. The three-time NBA champion and Marquette icon sent a powerful video message to Jones, praising the young guard’s hard work and encouraging him for what lies ahead. Wade’s message was quite personal. He was right there on campus at Marquette, celebrating alongside the very team that helped shape Jones’ path.Dwyane Wade, who also came through the Marquette program before being drafted No. 5 overall in 2003, made it a point to return to Milwaukee on draft night. As Jones heard his name called, Wade’s pride was evident in a video posted by Marquette’s social media team.“I’m on campus right now. I’m with the team. We’re all thinking about you. We all cheered for you. We’re all rooting for you. Congratulations on getting drafted tonight,” Wade said. “Your dreams are starting to become true. There’s more work to do, but congratulations on where you’re at. It’s a start.”Jones, a 23-year-old senior, ended his college career as one of the most dynamic scorers in the Big East.He averaged 19.2 points and 5.9 assists per game in his final season. His 2,044 total points rank second all-time at Marquette, showing the impact he left behind. While his three-point shooting dipped to 31.1% this season, he still finished his career at 36.6% over four years. Indeed, it was the evidence of his deep-range potential.But beyond scoring, Jones brings NBA-ready skills with solid size and high-level playmaking. The Pacers finalized a trade with the San Antonio Spurs to secure his draft rights. Now, he joined the team that lost their 2025 NBA championship to OKC Thunder by a thin margin.Also Read: Cooper Flagg shares courtside moment with Kyrie Irving for the first time at Dallas Wings vs Indiana Fever game just days after NBA Draft Jones becomes the fourth Marquette player drafted in the last three years and the sixth Marquette guard drafted since 1990.

Kyrie Irving fires up after Paige Bueckers hits buzzer-beater three for Wings against Clark-less Fever,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/kyrie-irving-fires-up-after-paige-bueckers-hits-buzzer-beater-three-for-wings-against-clark-less-fever/articleshow/122123166.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Paige Bueckers hit a wild logo three at the buzzer and the crowd lost it

Paige Bueckers lit up the first half with a logo-range dagger that had fans on their feet and Kyrie Irving jumping out of his seat. It wasn’t just a buzzer-beater, it was a statement. As the Fever struggled without Caitlin Clark, Bueckers grabbed her moment, bringing energy, belief, and a little NBA magic to the floor. Her 12th point of the half might just be her most unforgettable.The vibe was electric at the American Airlines Center on June 27, 2025. During a close contest, Dallas Wings rookie Paige Bueckers pulled off a daring logo shot to finish the first half—her 12th point of the half—doing it in true Caitlin Clark style, even with Clark out due to a groin injury. The crowd erupted, and as the referee's whistles still echoed, Bueckers sprinted to the sideline. Right there, Kyrie Irving—Bueckers’s self-proclaimed favorite NBA star—jumped up and gave her a quick dap, sealing the moment and merging WNBA talent with NBA stardom.At the end of the half, Indiana was still in the lead by 13, but the momentum had noticeably changed. The Fever, who were missing their superstar Caitlin Clark averaging 18.2 points, 8.9 assists, and 5.6 rebounds, but going through a rough patch with a 1-for-23 shooting slump from three-point range on the road, were feeling the pressure.Bueckers’s signature shot not only reduced the lead but also energized the Wings and their star-studded audience.Bueckers has always talked about her dream of having a big-game moment with Irving—ever since she got to Dallas on Media Day, where she referred to him as her favorite player ""forever"". Now that dream has become a reality, proving her journey from an ACL comeback in college to thriving as a WNBA rookie in the same city as the nine-time NBA All-Star.Their shared background goes further: both dealt with ACL injuries (Irving’s in March 2025, Bueckers’s in 2022) and bounced back stronger, creating a natural connection. When Irving was courtside on Thursday, the combination of chants, whistles, and Bueckers’s shot resulted in one of the standout rookie moments of the young WNBA season.Even with her amazing performances, Bueckers’s team started this season at the bottom of the standings with a record of 4–12. Still, her personal stats—17.7 points, 5.8 assists, and 4.6 rebounds per game—are similar to Clark’s impressive numbers. She’s gaining national recognition, not only for her skills on the court but also for advocating for her fellow players—publicly supporting Caitlin Clark and challenging the “inhumane” pressure put on young talents.Also Read: LeBron James celebrates his electric boat team’s strong finish in Italy but the real test is still ahead As the Wings strive to narrow the distance, Bueckers keeps evolving amidst both attention and challenges.

Which WWE Championship changed hands on SmackDown before Night of Champions 2025 Premium Live Event?

WWE Night of Champions is only a day away from emanating from the Kingdom Arena in the rich city of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. WWE built much hype for the Premium Live Event in the same venue by presenting the June 27th edition of Friday Night SmackDown. It featured three top title matches on the card. While two titles managed to stay with their respective titleholders, a major championship changed hands following a highly spectacular showdown that captivated the Riyadh audience.On the June 27th edition of WWE SmackDown, Zelina Vega was scheduled to defend her WWE Women's United States Championship against Giulia. The international sensation had been having multiple encounters with Vega over the last few weeks since she was called up from WWE NXT. After Vega defeated Pipe Niven in a match with Giulia's help, she immediately turned on her and held the star-spangled prize high. This clearly hinted at her intentions, and the match was made official for SmackDown taking place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.The duo clashed in an epic encounter that was a thrilling sight to witness. The Beautiful Madness unleashed her fury on the defending champion, who fought through it valiantly.From stunning drops to power-packed moves, Vega and Giulia stole the show.

She put a conclusion to the bout by delivering a Northern Lights Bomb on Zelina Vega and pinned her shoulders to the mat for the three count.With that win, Giulia became the new WWE Women's United States Champion, marking her first singles title on the main roster. It was a sight of similar success being replicated by Giulia that she did when she arrived in NXT last year. While Zelina Vega did her best, her effort ultimately fell short at the hands of The Beautiful Madness. With Giulia winning her first major championship in WWE, it will be interesting to see her title reign on Friday Night SmackDown.Also read: Seth Rollins’ Money in the Bank cash-in — 4 possible WWE victims!

Instagram war explodes as Jordon Hudson exposes Linda Holliday’s 'delusional' letter to Bill Belichick



Things are heating up off the football field for former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick, but this time, the drama isn’t about playbooks—it’s about a fiery love triangle making waves on social media. His current girlfriend, 24-year-old pageant contestant Jordon Hudson, has allegedly taken direct aim at his longtime ex-partner Linda Holliday in a now-viral Instagram exchange.According to the Daily Mail, Hudson was engaged in a heated back-and-forth with someone she believed to be close to Holliday. The argument ignited when the woman allegedly branded Hudson a “gold digger” and accused her of taking advantage of the 73-year-old NFL legend. Hudson, however, did not hold back in her response and delivered a blistering message that included references to a letter Holliday wrote to Belichick nearly a decade ago.“Hey babes! Since you are tight with Ms Holliday, would you please ask her what she would like me to do with this letter I found from 2015?” Hudson reportedly wrote in a message shared via screenshot. She added, “Due to its pathetic and embarrassing content, I imagine she wants it back.She should make the point to burn it so she continue [sic] to live in delusional denial.”The letter in question was supposedly found by Hudson at Belichick’s $2.2 million Hingham home in an old invoice file. In it, Holliday had allegedly poured out her frustrations over being excluded from aspects of Belichick’s life and his ongoing loyalty to ex-wife Debbie Clarke. Holliday had written, “I’m the one that loves and adores you... tries to ALWAYS remind you how grateful I am of your love,” expressing feelings of being sidelined in favor of Clarke, despite her love and commitment to the coach.Belichick and Holliday were together for 16 years before parting ways in 2023. Shortly after, Belichick's romance with Hudson became public. The couple reportedly first met on a flight in 2021 and have since been spotted attending high-profile events, including the NFL Honors.But Hudson's entry into Belichick's world has been far from seamless. Page Six reports that she has been “iced out” by Nantucket’s elite social scene—where Holliday remains a central figure. Her growing influence in Belichick’s post-Patriots chapter has raised eyebrows too, especially after she was seen on the field at UNC, where Belichick has taken a new role. Some reports suggest she’s even being looped into work emails and possibly pitching involvement in media projects like Hard Knocks.Despite the noise, Belichick has publicly defended Hudson, stating she leads his “professional opportunities” outside UNC. Whether this storm settles or intensifies remains to be seen—but one thing is clear: this isn’t your typical offseason drama.Also Read: How Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen built their marriage on trust and acceptance of each other’s pasts?","Bill Belichick's current girlfriend, 24-year-old pageant contestant Jordon Hudson, has allegedly taken direct aim at his longtime ex-partner Linda Holliday in a now-viral Instagram exchange.
