Skip Bayless calls Tom Brady a bad look for the NFL after headset appearance

Skip Bayless disappointed after praising Tom Brady as the greatest of all time for years

Tom Brady might be done playing, but the controversies just keep coming. His recent appearance with the Raiders staff on Monday Night Football sparked a heated tirade from Skip Bayless that’s still being talked about. Skip Bayless accused Brady of 'bullying the NFL' and even said he should decide between his role at Fox Sports and team ownership.Sports analyst Skip Bayless really didn't hold back on his thoughts about Brady's two roles during a segment on his show ""The Arena,"" which you can find in a YouTube video. Bayless, famous for his bold opinions, called it a ""bad look"" for the NFL and everyone connected to it.He specifically said to his audience, “He’s bullying this league. He took a deal to work for Fox, 10-years for $375 million. Then, he turned right around on top of that, and he bought five percent of the now Las Vegas Raiders… I fell out of my chair last night when I saw him sitting in the coaches box with a head set on… He is blatantly ‘f-you’ing’ the entire league and my former network.”Bayless shared more about his reasoning, emphasizing that Brady might be able to access confidential information through his broadcasting position, which could also help the Raiders.He elaborated, “His duties as a Fox broadcaster allow him, without any connection with the Raiders, to obviously interview all of you the day before he would commentate on your game.”He later added, “In that session… the players and coaches are going to confide in you… They are going to open up to you… Now, if I’m the Bears, I am shutting up, man. I am closing down.” These comments were a direct reaction to the sighting on Monday night and Carroll's confirmation, stressing Bayless's perspective that Brady's actions hurt fairness in the league.In a related X post on September 16, 2025, Bayless tweeted, ""Wait, Raiders owner Tom Brady is sitting in the coaching box with a headset & ESPN says he talks often during the week to O.C. Chip Kelly??? How can the NFL allow Brady to even remotely interview players/coaches of other teams as part of his Fox prep? This is just wrong.""A follow-up post stated, ""I have defended Tom Brady for years as the runaway NFL GOAT. But now he wants his cake and eat it, too? He took a reported $370 mil for 10 years from Fox then bought 5% of the Raiders, which severely limits his ability to do his Fox job? Now he's advising/coaching? Big-footing.""Bayless thinks Brady is using his power to take conflicting stances, giving the Raiders an unfair edge while cashing in on his Fox deal.He pointed out that this arrangement lets Brady tap into confidential info from competitors, which he might pass on to his own squad, jeopardizing the game's fairness.Historically, Skip Bayless has regarded Brady as the all-time greatest in the NFL, yet he's voiced his discontent over what he believes is Brady focusing on personal benefits rather than league integrity, especially with the constraints that ownership puts on his broadcasting responsibilities.His statements were influenced by the visual evidence from the broadcast and Carroll's public acknowledgment of Brady's role.In conclusion, Bayless urged Brady to let go of his Fox deal so he can focus exclusively on ownership, mentioning, “He should just drop the Fox deal. He wants to be an owner and operator of the franchise? Go do that.”Also Read: Marcus Spears calls out NFL for letting Tom Brady be the Las Vegas Raiders owner and Fox analyst at the same time Given the hefty $375 million value of the decade-long contract, it's pretty unlikely that Brady will just leave. The NFL is now dealing with a PR challenge and may need to create new guidelines to manage these overlaps, keeping the league's credibility intact along with that of players like Brady.","Skip Bayless accused Tom Brady of 'bullying the NFL' and even said he should decide between his role at Fox Sports and team ownership.

Who is Alix Earle beyond TikTok fame?



When Houston Texans wide receiver Braxton Berrios went public with his relationship in 2023, fans quickly realized his girlfriend wasn’t just another name. Alix Earle, already a TikTok sensation, had built an enormous following through her candid videos and unfiltered storytelling. Together, they’ve become one of the most-watched young couples, merging the worlds of sports and social media into a story fans can’t get enough of.Berrios admitted early on that dating a high-profile influencer came with new challenges. “Obviously when I met her and we started talking and then dating, I knew that [her being an influencer] came with it,” he shared on SiriusXM Sports. But he also drew a surprising parallel between their careers, pointing out the similarities in work ethic. “We as athletes, we dream of this and do so many things our whole life to get to where we are. And I think there’s a wrong connotation about a lot of the creators or social media stars, because … they do the same thing. Maybe it didn’t take as much time, maybe it didn’t take as many years. But it still takes thought, it takes planning, it takes sacrifice.”Fans first spotted the couple together in 2023, when a TikTok video of them meeting a fan in Miami went viral.Their red carpet debut came at the ESPY Awards that same year, cementing their status as one of sports and entertainment’s rising power couples. By April 2025, the relationship reached another milestone when Alix moved into Berrios’ Miami home.Their romance stirred headlines after Berrios’s ex, model Sophia Culpo, accused him of cheating around the time he began seeing Earle. Despite the noise, the couple continued to grow stronger, even moving in together in Miami in April 2025. Both the Miami Dolphins star and the TikTok personality have insisted that their relationship did not begin while Braxton was still with Sophia.Born and raised in New Jersey, Alix carved her own path after graduating with a marketing degree from the University of Miami in 2023. Her career took off when she started posting “get ready with me” videos, sharing not just her makeup routines but also personal struggles, including acne and anxiety. That honesty resonated with millions, helping her grow to 7.5 million TikTok followers and 4.5 million on Instagram.She later launched her podcast, Hot Mess with Alix Earle, which briefly topped Spotify’s charts, even surpassing The Joe Rogan Experience. In 2025, she was named to the Time100 Creators list, solidifying her influence. Now, she’s preparing to take on a new challenge—competing on season 34 of Dancing With The Stars.From TikTok star to mainstream personality, Alix Earle has built a career on authenticity.

Gracie Hunt steps into homeownership as a statement of independence

A love story written in the Arrowhead corridors

Gracie Hunt, daughter of Kansas City Chiefs owners Clark and Tavia Hunt, is taking bold steps toward carving out her own identity beyond the NFL spotlight. At 26, the heiress is well known for her glamorous presence on Chiefs game days, but now she’s focusing on personal milestones—most notably purchasing her own home and embracing a meaningful relationship.Despite growing up in luxury, surrounded by sprawling estates and high-profile events, Gracie’s recent Instagram reveal of her new home signals a fresh, independent chapter. Accompanied by a photo of white hydrangeas, Veuve Clicquot champagne, and a card from her real estate agent, the post symbolized more than just a property purchase—it represented her intent to establish her own space with style and grace.“Thank you, my dear friend Gianna Cerullo,” she wrote, acknowledging the support behind the move.

Erik Johnson: The veteran presence the New York Rangers could rely on

Erik Johnson Availability | March 8, 2025

Veteran value on a budget: Why Erik Johnson could be the Rangers’ safety net

With the 2025 NHL season fast approaching, the New York Rangers are exploring every option to strengthen their roster. Amid trade rumors surrounding stars like Artemi Panarin and Mika Zibanejad, one unexpected name has emerged: 37-year-old defenseman Erik Johnson. A former Stanley Cup winner and seasoned veteran, Johnson could provide the Rangers with much-needed leadership, depth, and mentorship on a young but inconsistent blue line.Johnson, once a first overall pick and a key part of Colorado Avalanche’s Stanley Cup run in 2022, is no longer the 20-minute-a-night defenseman he once was. But what he lacks in ice time, he makes up for in experience, leadership, and defensive reliability. Over 1,023 NHL games, Johnson has collected 348 points while delivering 1,717 blocked shots and 1,695 hits, proving his ability to make an impact even in the twilight of his career.For the Rangers, Johnson’s presence isn’t just about numbers. He could be instrumental in guiding young defenders like Adam Fox, K’Andre Miller, Zachary Jones, and Victor Mancini, helping them navigate the pressures of a long season and the intensity of New York hockey.His championship experience adds credibility and a calm, steadying influence in high-stakes situations.Signing Erik Johnson comes with minimal financial risk for the New York Rangers. A league-minimum deal keeps the team comfortably under the salary cap while providing crucial insurance against injuries or defensive slumps. At 37, Johnson may be considered a late-career veteran, but as seen with stars like Alex Ovechkin and John Tavares, experience can still translate into significant on-ice impact.Also Read: NHL stars’ guilty pleasure cheat meals revealed ahead of 2025 season: From Charlie McAvoy craving chicken wings to Connor Bedard’s Burgers The Erik Johnson twist may surprise some fans, but it’s a practical and strategic decision. In a season where depth and veteran leadership often separate playoff contenders from pretenders, adding a seasoned defenseman could give the Rangers the stability they need. For a team navigating uncertainty on the blue line, Johnson offers leadership, reliability, and a cost-effective way to bolster their roster without jeopardizing cap flexibility.","The New York Rangers are exploring every option to strengthen their roster.

Charlie Kirk’s remarks drew sharp criticism for being misogynistic

Why the controversy matters in today’s culture

The death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has reignited heated debates after his controversial remarks about Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce resurfaced online. Kirk, who founded Turning Point USA, tragically passed away at age 31 on September 10, 2025, after being shot during a speaking event at Utah Valley University. However, it’s his relationship advice to the global pop icon that is now making waves across social media.During an August 26 episode of The Charlie Kirk Show, Kirk addressed Taylor Swift’s recent engagement to Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce. His statements went beyond typical political commentary, instead offering personal and judgmental advice. “She should have more children than she has houses,” Kirk declared, “That is my challenge, Taylor Swift, and I’m not being sarcastic. I think that if she ends up having children, she’ll stop this kind of liberal, endorsing Joe Biden nonsense. ”Kirk went further, calling Swift “not a good role model for young women” because she focused on her career instead of settling down earlier. His most contentious remarks urged Swift to “Reject feminism. Submit to your husband, Taylor. You’re not in charge.”These comments were met with swift backlash. On Reddit, many users condemned Kirk’s statements as “deeply regressive and misogynistic.”One user pointedly remarked, “’Submit to your husband’ is straight up Handmaid’s Tale vibes.” Another argued, “Why can’t folks just say ‘They seem happy. I wish them well.’ and move on.”Taylor Swift, a global superstar with massive influence, especially among women, became an unintended focal point in the culture wars. Kirk’s comments highlight how some figures attempt to shape public opinion by leveraging celebrity relationships as political symbols. His words were not just about Swift’s personal life but aimed at pushing a broader conservative agenda, suggesting that personal choices could politically influence millions of fans.Also Read: Houston Texans draw outrage for ‘tone-deaf’ pregame tribute to victims of violence without mentioning Charlie Kirk As the nation processes Kirk’s shocking death, his comments continue to fuel discussion around feminism, celebrity influence, and the power dynamics in modern relationships.

NFL’s lack of consistency compared to past public statements drew more criticism



""Last night’s moment was the league’s decision. It’s up to the clubs for this Sunday’s games,""

""There have been moments following school shootings or an attack on a house of worship such as the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018. There also have been moments following major international incidents such as Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023 and weather-related incidents such as major hurricanes and fires,""

The Green Bay Packers and the NFL held a moment of silence for conservative activist Charlie Kirk before Thursday Night Football against the Washington Commanders at Lambeau Field. Kirk, 31, was shot and killed Wednesday during a speaking event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.The tribute took place about 25 minutes before kickoff. The in-stadium announcement said, “The National Football League asks that you please join us in a moment of silent reflection following the murder of Charlie Kirk. The NFL condemns all violence in our communities. It will take all of us to stop hate. Thank you.”Former President Donald Trump confirmed Kirk’s death on Wednesday and later said he would posthumously award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The FBI released a photo of a person of interest Thursday, but no arrests have been made.Fox News senior NFL writer Armando Salguero shared video of the silence. The MLFootball account also circulated the clip, describing the moment as a league-wide honor. Critics, however, said the execution fell flat.One frustrated fan in attendance wrote, “They did it when the stadium wasn’t even half full half an hour ago, and it went right to. It was terrible.” Another attendee added, “It was ridiculous; they didn’t even display it on the jumbotron.”On social media, the pushback was even stronger. One user posted, “We doing for just anyone now? There was a school shooting yesterday (AND today) AND a shooting at a US naval academy but I guess that’s not important.” Another wrote, “That wasn’t even a moment. Couldn’t even count one second of silence.”After Oregon’s Week 3 win over Northwestern, coach Dan Lanning used his postgame press conference to reflect on the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Lanning said the Ducks’ locker room, filled with players of different races, religions, and backgrounds, shows how love can exist despite differences, something he believes the country has lost sight of.He also shared that he recently learned Kirk was an Oregon fan, noting Kirk and his wife attended last year’s win over Ohio State. Lanning expressed sympathy for Erika Kirk and their children, calling the killing “evil” and adding, “Life matters. I think we’ve lost sight of that.”Several NFL teams paused before kickoff on Sunday to honor Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old conservative activist who was fatally shot last week. The New York Jets, Miami Dolphins, Tennessee Titans, New Orleans Saints, Pittsburgh Steelers, Dallas Cowboys, and Arizona Cardinals all held moments of silence, with some displaying his picture on jumbotrons or lowering flags to half-staff. The Dolphins tied their tribute to both Kirk and the victims of the 9/11 terror attacks, while the Saints held silence before the anthem in New Orleans. The Steelers chose to mark the occasion by flying their flag at half-staff during their matchup with the Seattle Seahawks.Other teams took different approaches. The Detroit Lions, Cincinnati Bengals, Baltimore Ravens, Indianapolis Colts, and Minnesota Vikings did not hold tributes before kickoff. Indianapolis said it had already planned a moment of silence for Forrest Lucas, the founder of Lucas Oil, after his death last month. The Lions, Bengals, Ravens, and Vikings did not initially respond when asked why they made no tribute. Notably, the Ravens previously held a moment of silence for George Floyd in 2020, with players from both sides kneeling in protest months later. Earlier in the week, the Green Bay Packers also observed a moment of silence for Kirk before facing the Washington Commanders, but the NFL left the decision to individual teams moving forward.The NFL’s silence in the immediate aftermath of Kirk’s assassination frustrated many. The league has issued statements in the past on events such as the killing of George Floyd and support for LGBTQ rights. The absence of a message for Kirk led some to accuse the NFL of picking and choosing when to speak up.Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker posted Kirk’s final text message, calling him a “strong witness for Christ.” Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson also paid tribute, as did New York Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart, who wrote, “Praying for him and his family. Charlie did great things for our country!! Political Violence NEEDS TO STOP!! Pray for our country man. This is disgusting and Sad!!”ESPN analyst Pat McAfee called the shooting “startling, saddening, and maddening.” Former NFL players Tim Tebow and Julian Edelman also acknowledged Kirk’s death.Former NFL punter Chris Kluwe, on the other hand, stirred controversy on BlueSky this week after the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Kluwe, who earlier this year lost his job as a high school football coach for calling the MAGA movement “Nazi,” posted a profanity-laced message backing Sen. Elizabeth Warren for rejecting claims that Democratic rhetoric had fueled the attack. In his post, Kluwe argued that Republicans are responsible for the hostile climate, writing that they “could stop it at any time” and shouldn’t be treated like “children. ”The NFL addressed its tribute to Charlie Kirk in a statement released Friday, noting that teams will decide for themselves whether to observe a similar gesture on Sunday. During Thursday night’s matchup between the Green Bay Packers and Washington Commanders, the league held a moment of silence for Kirk before kickoff.the statement read, according to multiple reports.The league explained the decision by pointing to its history of holding moments of silence after tragedies or significant losses.the statement continued. It added that tributes have also honored figures within the NFL family, from Damar Hamlin to Kobe Bryant, and reflected on changes to pre-game protocols after the death of George Floyd.The Colts addressed why they didn’t hold a tribute for Charlie Kirk before Sunday’s game. Some fans noticed the absence and raised questions, given the national attention around his death.A team spokesperson told Newsweek the decision was tied to an existing plan. ""The Colts already had a moment of silence planned for Forrest Lucas, founder of Lucas Oil and namesake of our home at Lucas Oil Stadium,"" the spokesperson said in an email.Outside football, the New York Yankees held a moment of silence before their Wednesday game against the Detroit Tigers. Trump later appeared at Yankee Stadium during a separate 9/11 ceremony.","Fans say the NFL’s Charlie Kirk tribute felt rushed and poorly executed.

Molly Qerim’s exit from ESPN marks the end of an era.

Is Tom Brady facing any penalties for his role in the Raiders’ coaching booth while broadcasting?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/is-tom-brady-facing-any-penalties-for-his-role-in-the-raiders-coaching-booth-while-broadcasting/articleshow/123932817.cms,"Tom Brady (Getty Images)

What the NFL rules say about Tom Brady’s dual role

Is this a smart business decision or a conflict of interest?

Tom Brady’s unusual dual role as a Fox analyst and minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders has ignited debate across the NFL world. After calling the Washington Commanders game in Week 1, Brady was seen sitting in the Raiders’ coaching booth during their Week 2 matchup against the Chargers. His presence raised eyebrows, with many questioning the potential conflict of interest.Despite the controversy, ESPN’s Adam Schefter clarified that Tom Brady did not break any NFL rules. “There are no policies that prohibit an owner from sitting in the coaches’ booth or wearing a headset during a game,” explained NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy. Brady, in his capacity as a limited partner and Raiders minority owner, is allowed to sit in the booth. However, the league has strictly barred him from attending team practices, production meetings, or visiting the Raiders’ facilities in a non-broadcast capacity.This unusual arrangement stems from Tom Brady’s massive 10-year, $375 million deal with Fox, along with his decision to invest in the Raiders after retiring from the quarterback position. The NFL clearly limits his interaction to broadcasting duties and prevents any involvement that could give him inside competitive advantage.Critics like Grant Paulsen of 106.7 The Fan called it “a ridiculous conflict of interest,” especially considering Brady’s close involvement with the Raiders as an owner and broadcaster. The debate intensifies ahead of Week 3 when the Raiders face Washington, where Brady previously called their game as an analyst. While legally allowed, many wonder if the optics of his dual role threaten journalistic neutrality.Also Read: “I used to date…”: Sofia Vergara dated this Chiefs’ star amid rumored fling with Tom Brady, her Modern Family co-star reveals Ultimately, Brady’s position highlights the fine line between business savvy and ethical responsibility in the NFL.

Colts prioritize tribute to Forrest Lucas amid political tension

Public reaction highlights deepening political divide

The Indianapolis Colts faced public backlash after choosing not to pay tribute to Charlie Kirk , the conservative activist who was fatally shot during his “American Comeback Tour” at Utah Valley University. Instead, the Colts held a moment of silence for Forrest Lucas, founder of Lucas Oil and namesake of their stadium.A spokesperson for the Indianapolis Colts told Newsweek via email, “For Week 2, the Colts already had a moment of silence planned for Forrest Lucas, founder of Lucas Oil and namesake of our home at Lucas Oil Stadium. He passed away in late August. A few days after his passing, we announced that we would honor him before and during our Week 2 game as he was a monumental business and community leader and a dear friend to our city, state, and country. ”While several NFL teams, including the Arizona Cardinals, Dallas Cowboys, and New York Jets, paid tribute to Kirk before their games, the Colts, along with the Baltimore Ravens, Detroit Lions, Cincinnati Bengals, and Minnesota Vikings, did not. The NFL had earlier stated that each team could decide independently whether to honor Kirk.Kirk’s assassination has triggered national debate about political violence and growing divisions in the U.S. Social media posts exposing the teams that did not hold tributes garnered millions of views. One widely shared tweet pointed out, “Every one of these teams honored George Floyd back in 2020,” stirring further controversy. Meanwhile, some voices argued, “Leave politics out of football,” reflecting a desire to separate sports from political discourse.Also Read: Houston Texans draw outrage for ‘tone-deaf’ pregame tribute to victims of violence without mentioning Charlie Kirk The suspect, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, is in custody, but tensions remain high as the nation processes the tragedy and its implications for political safety in America.","Colts held a moment of silence for Forrest Lucas, founder of Lucas Oil and namesake of their stadium.

Josh Allen aims to extend dominance over Miami Dolphins



A bruised nose won’t keep Josh Allen off the field. The Buffalo Bills quarterback, who briefly left Sunday’s 30-10 win over the New York Jets after blood poured from his nose, is set to play on Thursday night against the Miami Dolphins. This time, he will be wearing something new — a clear helmet visor.Allen tested the visor during practice earlier this week and confirmed he will “probably” use it during the primetime showdown. While he has worn visors at Wyoming and in practice sessions, this marks his first time trying it in an NFL game.“Just trying to get used to it ... It doesn’t really impact much,” Allen explained. “It’s weird to say, but it’s a little warmer in there. Your voice kind of echoes off it, too, so it’s just a little bit weirder.”The 29-year-old was struck hard in the opening quarter against the Jets, leaving him briefly sidelined with gauze stuffed in his nose. Yet he returned quickly and finished with 148 passing yards, 59 rushing yards, and complete command in a wire-to-wire victory.His durability remains one of Buffalo’s greatest assets. Since his rookie season in 2018, when an elbow injury sidelined him for four games, Allen has not missed a single start.His streak now stands at 107 consecutive starts, the longest active run among NFL quarterbacks.Coach Sean McDermott and teammates even found lighthearted ways to address the injury. McDermott joked, “Yeah, his nose didn’t get any bigger, I don’t think. It always looked good to me.” Right tackle Spencer Brown teased that Allen resembled defensive end Joey Bosa, to which Allen quipped he was “the third Bosa brother in the league.”Allen’s presence against Miami carries weight beyond just toughness. His record against the Dolphins is staggering: 12-2 with 37 passing touchdowns, five rushing scores, and a 108.8 passer rating. The Bills have not lost to Miami since 2022, and Allen himself piled up 400 passing yards in that defeat.For Buffalo, Thursday’s divisional clash is more than just another game. It’s an early-season statement against a key AFC East rival. And while the Bills may think twice about calling quarterback sneaks, Allen’s message is clear — a bruised nose won’t keep him from leading the charge under the lights.Also Read: Is Tom Brady facing any penalties for his role in the Raiders’ coaching booth while broadcasting?",Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen set to play against Miami Dolphins.

Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen’s marriage once seemed like the perfect pairing of sports and supermodel stardom.

In interviews, Bündchen opened up about her concerns over the sport’s violence and its long-term impact on Brady’s health. “I have my children and I would like him to be more present,” she said.Their differing priorities became more evident as Brady continued to chase records rather than retiring as planned. In a Facebook Watch docuseries, Bündchen recalled, “He did tell me that he was going to play only for 10 years… now you know, now we’re going to go and live in Costa Rica.” But that plan never materialized.Brady admitted later, “She didn’t feel like I was doing my part for the family… she would take care of the house.” This imbalance strained their relationship. Gisele even wrote him a “very thought-out letter,” which Brady kept as a reminder that priorities evolve.When they publicly announced their divorce in October 2019, both emphasized co-parenting their children with care and respect.

The NBA is still feeling the effects of the February 2025 deal that brought Luka Doncic from the Dallas Mavericks to the Los Angeles Lakers. NBA commissioner Adam Silver has now addressed the whole situation. He referred to the super controversial Doncic trade by the Dallas Mavericks to the Los Angeles Lakers. Apparently, Silver has become the subject of a conspiracy theory that suggests that he has reportedly orchestrated the Doncic deal so that he could allegedly favor the Lakers.NBA commissioner Adam Silver recently shared his thoughts on the trade, calling it a ""blow to Doncic"" and expressing his hope that the player would take the opportunity to start over. In his comments about the trade, Silver expressed his surprise and empathy for the angry Mavericks supporters. He also gave them hope by stating that ""only time will tell whether it was a smart trade.""More than seven months after the transaction, Silver made some intriguing remarks about it in a report titled ""Welcome to the Luka Doncic Revenge Tour"" in the Wall Street Journal. During the same, he said:“Putting aside the merits of the trade, you could argue that it was a bit of a kick in the a** to Luka...""According to Silver:“Another player could have said, ‘Oh, now I’m part of the Los Angeles Lakers organization’. He didn’t try to hide his disappointment, and I think he was in a bit of a funk for a while, because it was probably the first true professional setback of his career. And I was hoping personally for him that he would ultimately see this as an opportunity to reset.”Regarding Doncic's response, he said,""He didn't try to sugarcoat this trade.""Silver further noted that it was likely the first professional setback of Luka's career, so he was in a bit of a funk for a while. The Commissioner, however, feels that the trade has evolved beyond a simple transactional shock.In a shocking and unexpected turn of events, the Utah Jazz arranged a three-team trade that saw Luka Doncic go from the Dallas Mavericks to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Anthony Davis. Following this, Doncic discussed his shock at the trade, speaking with the Wall Street Journal Magazine for its Fall Men’s Issue. He said:""I didn't know how to react, how to act, what to say. It was a lot of shock. I felt Dallas was my home. I had many friends there. The fans always supported me. I didn't want to upset Dallas fans. And I didn't want to upset Laker fans.""Additionally, talking about it, he told Men’s Health Magazine:“This summer was just a little bit different, you know. It kind of motivated me to be even better.. If I stop now, it was all for nothing.”Moreover, in an interview with ESPN's Malika Andrews, Doncic disclosed that when he found out the Mavericks were trading him, he threw his phone in anger and frustration and broke the glass. He acknowledged that he was devastated, not knowing why it happened. However, that setback only made him more determined. Even though he reportedly hasn’t moved on from the Mavs, he is seemingly doing well with the Lakers.Also read: Mark Cuban admits regret over Luka Doncic trade, says he “f**ked up” after selling Mavericks","Luka Doncic was traded from the Dallas Mavericks to the Los Angeles Lakers in February.

Steve Ballmer addresses Aspiration controversy , says Los Angeles Clippers and Kawhi Leonard deals were independent

NBA investigates Steve Ballmer, Los Angeles Clippers and Kawhi Leonard after $28M alleged Aspiration deal

Kawhi Leonard Scam with Steve Ballmer | Gucci Turban Podcast

Steve Ballmer, the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers , is currently being investigated for allegedly evading the salary cap with star forward Kawhi Leonard. However, he claimed to be innocent and apparently doesn't mind the NBA investigating him. On Tuesday, he expressed his approval of the NBA's inquiry into the matter. He also reaffirmed his remarks and hinted that the NBA's probe will turn up nothing unusual. During an interview, he further said that “this too shall pass.”Steve Ballmer reportedly invested $50 million in 2021 in Aspiration, a now-bankrupt company, according to Pablo Torre. Later, Kawhi Leonard and the company reportedly reached an endorsement agreement that allegedly required almost nothing of him.Now, Ballmer claimed that he has nothing to hide and the NBA investigating him will not find anything. He made such remarks while appearing as a guest speaker at the Sports Business Journal's Drive event. At one point, the host said:“I know that you've had a lot going on including allegations against the team about the partnership with aspiration and know if you want to address it right off. Sure, we're not, we're not, this is not a fun thing to be through. I was personally defrauded through our interactions with the company and some of the staff…”He then replied:“The fraud sort of extended broadly through that. We had many relationships with the company sponsor, activation was through carbon credits, all a bunch of complicated stuff. But the important thing is our relationship with the company and our players' relationship with the company were independent, which is important under the rules of the NBA…”Ballmer also claimed that he had been duped and that the NBA would discover that Leonard's relationship with Aspiration and the L.A.Clippers' relationship with Aspiration were ""independent.""He continued:“I feel quite confident that we abided by the rules. And so I welcome the investigation that the NBA is doing. It's a great way from our perspective to get the facts out there. And as I say, there's nothing fun about being highlighted in this way. It's a whole lot more fun to be highlighted for building a great arena. But this too shall pass… And like I said, I feel very good about what we did and we welcome the NBA, taking a look at it and hopefully agreeing with us…”For context, the Los Angeles Clippers, Steve Ballmer, and Kawhi Leonard made the news since Pablo Torre ’s claims of possible salary cap evasion. The NBA is now looking into Ballmer, the Clippers, and Leonard after it was revealed that a company Ballmer invested in paid Leonard $28 million for ""no-show jobs"" in an apparent attempt to get around the NBA's pay cap.Journalist Pablo Torre reportedly uncovered the whole thing and in his ""Kawhi Leonard Signed a Secret $28M Deal” podcast episode, he revealed everything. Torre then described how Leonard reportedly broke NBA regulations by accepting money from a now-bankrupt company in addition to his club salary.Torre made enough connections to start the NBA's investigation in the matter. Following these revelations, Ballmer and the Clippers refuted the claims, claiming that Aspiration had misled Ballmer and that he had ""no oversight"" into Leonard's independent endorsement deal with Aspiration.Also read: Smoking gun’ emerges in Kawhi Leonard and Los Angeles Clippers Aspiration payment controversy","Steve Ballmer, the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, is currently being investigated for allegedly evading the salary cap with star forward Kawhi Leonard.

Brian Windhorst drops bold claim that LeBron James could walk away from NBA for another basketball league,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/brian-windhorst-drops-bold-claim-that-lebron-james-could-walk-away-from-nba-for-another-basketball-league/articleshow/123927154.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Brian Windhorst says LeBron James still ranks among the top 10 to 15 players in the NBA today

LeBron James’ age and physical toll spark questions about his career path

LeBron James’ future questioned as player option leaves him with no long term security in Los Angeles Lakers

Brian Windhorst recently ignited conversations about LeBron James ' future on an episode of the Hoop Collective podcast. During the chat, Windhorst mentioned that LeBron James has been associated with the idea of possibly playing in other basketball leagues outside of the NBA . This remark surfaced during wider discussions regarding James' contract and performance, leading to speculation about whether the Lakers star might explore other options if he decides to leave the league.During the conversation, Windhorst focused on LeBron James' play style and mental approach. He remarked, ""He played the last two seasons he's played 71 in 70 games. Um, he this last year averaged 24 points, eight rebounds, eight assists, shot 51% overall from the field. His three-point percentage was 37% 38% if you round up, which was down from the year before.""Windhorst pointed out that James' performance doesn't indicate he's about to retire, stating, ""What I can tell you is his play on the court is not indicating somebody who's near retirement now. No, he's still one of the 10 or 15 best players in the league. Easy.""Still, he threw out a bold assertion regarding other leagues when he was addressing co-host Tim McMahon's observation about anticipating a decline in James' output. Windhorst stated, ""I keep saying I keep hearing people like this might be the last year. This might be the last year. Look, he's been linked to potentially playing in other leagues. I don't know.Maybe. But if he stays healthy, I do not see LeBron James slowing down. ""Windhorst's remarks seem to be based on the current buzz and the changing phase of James' career. He noted that there's been a lot of talk suggesting that ""This could be James' final year"" in the NBA, influenced by his age, the physical toll, and his uncertain contract situation.The mention of other leagues was brought up as a potential scenario during these talks, with Windhorst adding, ""I don't know. Maybe,"" which shows it's more about the rumors he's picked up rather than any solid plans.This fits perfectly with Windhorst's position as someone who frequently shares insights on James' career, having followed him closely since the beginning. The remark was made after defining the steadfastness and elite position of James as a decision made by Windhorst to balance his optimistic projection of the duration James will serve in the NBA with the presence of external publicity.Windhorst shared some in-depth insights into why James' future is up in the air. He pointed out that James can't get a contract extension and has a no-trade clause, which sets him up for unrestricted free agency after the 2025-26 season. This is a first for James, as he's always had some level of security beyond the current year.Windhorst also mentioned comments from Rich Paul, James' agent. Paul told Shams Charania that James is feeling uncertain about his future after opting in for his player option. Moreover, Paul personally told Windhorst that the Lakers haven't had any serious discussions about a new deal, saying, ""They didn't have material conversations with the Lakers about a new contract.""Also Read: Mario Chalmers claims Kevin Durant avoided Miami Heat to dodge the pressure of following LeBron James’ legacy There’s a lot of instability in the Lakers' roster, with many players such as Rui Hachimura, Austin Reaves, Gabe Vincent, and others entering contract years or having options.

Revisiting Matt Grzelcyk’s performance with the Pittsburgh Penguins

Former Pittsburgh Penguins defenseman Matt Grzelcyk has reportedly signed with the Chicago Blackhawks in a professional tryout (PTO) contract. It was reported by Elliotte Friedman on September 16, 2025, Tuesday, that the Blackhawks are signing Grzelcyk to a professional tryout contract (PTO). As training camps are already planned to be hosted by the Chicago Blackhawks, it will give the 31-year-old blueliner a chance to appear and represent the team.As per his recent performance, Grzelcyk impressed in 2024-25, scoring around 40 points in 82 games (1 goal, 39 assists) with the Penguins. His performance was particularly noteworthy on the power play, where he tied Sidney Crosby for the most assists on Pittsburgh's power play. Pittsburgh Penguins defenseman Matt Grzelcyk has reportedly signed a PTO with the Chicago Blackhawks, as confirmed by Elliotte Friedman on Tuesday. Taking to Twitter, Friedman wrote, “Hearing Matt Grzelcyk is signing a PTO with Chicago...was surprised to still see him on the market after a 40-point season.”Grzelcyk, a 31-year-old defenseman, saw a production boost last season due to his career-high power-play time, recording 15 assists.He struggled to find a team that was willing to take him on. Some wondered if perhaps he was waiting for the right offer or fit. However, this PTO proved that the Blackhawks were vying for him.For the rebuilding Blackhawks, who are already above the salary floor, this PTO is an intriguing choice. It might be argued that they don't really need another veteran because they have an abundance of defenseman who are ready for the NHL. Grzelcyk might also provide much-needed expertise to the relatively new Chicago group.Grzelcyk signed a one-year contract with the Penguins before the 2024–25 season and proved to be a valuable addition to their power play. Grzelcyk tied captain Sidney Crosby for the most power-play assists on the team with 15 power-play assists.As per reports, Grzelcyk was considered a major contributor to the Penguins' power play, which finished sixth in the NHL with a success rate of 25.79%. Despite finishing with a 34-36-12 record and missing out on the playoffs once more, they made progress when they had the man advantage. It will be interesting to witness what Grzelcyk will bring to the Blackhawks this season.","Former Pittsburgh Penguins defenseman Matt Grzelcyk has reportedly signed with the Chicago Blackhawks in a professional tryout (PTO) contract.

Is Madison Beer the secret weapon fans think could take Justin Herbert to the Super Bowl?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/is-madison-beer-the-secret-weapon-fans-think-could-take-justin-herbert-to-the-super-bowl/articleshow/123926623.cms,"Image - X

Justin Herbert and Madison Beer’s rumored romance keeps heating up



Fans are calling it the “Madison Beer effect”



“Ohhh look at me I’m Justin Herbert I’m 6’6 and make 50 million a year and I’m dating Madison Beer ohhhh look at me.”

When it comes to the NFL, most people think it’s the arm strength, the O-line, and the playbook that determine a quarterback’s fate. But if you scroll through Twitter right now, you’ll see a much spicier theory: that Los Angeles Chargers star Justin Herbert is about to ball out this season because of one person, pop sensation Madison Beer. Fans are already calling it the “Madison Beer effect,” and some believe she might just be the off-field spark that fuels a Super Bowl run.The chatter didn’t come out of nowhere. Herbert has been linked to Madison Beer for weeks, with sightings ranging from West Hollywood dinners to her music video shoot where he was reportedly on set. Fans even caught him liking her Instagram post promoting her single “Yes Baby,” which set off speculation that there’s more than friendship between the two.Neither Herbert nor Beer has confirmed a relationship, but that hasn’t stopped the NFL world from running with it. From hand-holding paparazzi shots to his sudden glow-up on game day, supporters are convinced the pop star is giving Herbert a confidence boost like never before.On social media, the jokes and theories are endless. One fan wrote,Another joked that Madison is “the real Chargers offensive coordinator.”It’s not the first time fans have credited celebrity relationships for fueling NFL success, just look at the Taylor Swift–Travis Kelce frenzy. Now Herbert has his own pop-culture storyline, and people are convinced that Beer’s presence is adding a new level of swagger to his game.Of course, football reality is a little more complicated. Herbert is a top-tier QB with a rocket arm, but the Chargers have struggled with consistency, injuries, and late-season collapses. Whether they can push all the way to the Super Bowl depends on a lot more than who he’s dating.Still, fans argue that confidence and mentality matter. A happy, motivated quarterback plays looser, takes more chances, and rallies the locker room. If Beer really is in Herbert’s corner, that kind of support could quietly make a difference even if it’s just psychological.For now, both stars are letting the internet do the talking. Whether it’s real love or just well-timed buzz, the hype around their connection has turned Herbert into one of the most talked-about players this season.Also read - Who is Stephanie Niles?

He exited after just 15 snaps due to an injury early in the game.Early tests gave rise to optimism, but an MRI, which was conducted on Tuesday, ultimately confirmed the worst fears. It is a pectoral muscle tear requiring surgery that will take Calijah Kancey out for the season. The Bucs’ DL is set to undergo the procedure later this week, and the team is expected to place him on injured reserve, officially ending his sophomore season.Losing Kancey is a tough loss for the Bucs, since the rookie defensive lineman was starting to have more of an impact every game. He was immediately ruled out following his exit in the second quarter of Monday night's game.Further assessments confirmed a torn ACL, and doctors with the team have recommended that the ligament be repaired surgically and rehabilitated aggressively. But the timeline to recover from a torn pectoral typically runs into the several-month range, and thus was expected to preclude him from appearing before the end of the regular season or the playoffs.It presents a major roadblock in what had been a strong sophomore campaign to date for Kancey, who had recorded 7.5 sacks in 12 games as a rookie and was expected to take on an even greater role this season.Kancey leaves a sizable void in the middle of Tampa Bay's defensive front. He brings a versatile, disruptor presence and can line up inside and out, allowing the Bucs to mix and match their pass-rush schemes. The team will miss Gay, but have guys like Greg Gaines and rookie Elijah Roberts that will step up and help fill that void.Although they both have played with potential, neither one provides the same explosiveness and burst off the line that Kancey does. Now the Buccaneers march straight into their toughest slice of the schedule with one of their most dynamic young defenders sidelined, but with their record at 2-0. Not only is this injury a personal blow to Kancey, but it is also the biggest test of the team's ballistic defense depth as the 2025 season rolls on.","Calijah Kancey is set to miss the rest of the 2025 season after suffering a torn pectoral muscle in the team’s Week 2 win against the Houston Texans.

Tom Brady ’s booth appearance sparks conflict, Adam Schefter confirms NFL rules

Tom Brady’s off-field roles raise questions on NFL ethics and transparency

Tom Brady is back in the spotlight, but this time off the field. During Week 2 of the NFL season, the legendary quarterback-turned-analyst was spotted in the Las Vegas Raiders’ coaches’ booth, sparking debates over the boundaries between broadcasting and team ownership. His dual role as Fox analyst and Raiders minority owner has prompted discussions on ethics, access, and potential conflicts in live game coverage.Tom Brady’s presence in the booth drew attention due to his dual role as a Fox analyst and Raiders minority owner. He had called the Washington Commanders’ Week 1 game while holding an ownership stake in the Raiders, raising questions about access to insider information and its potential impact on live game commentary.Despite the scrutiny, ESPN’s Adam Schefter confirmed that Brady was operating within NFL rules. While the league prohibits him from attending Raiders’ practices or joining production meetings because of his ownership role, sitting in the coaches’ booth during a live game is permitted. This distinction ensures Brady can deliver on-air analysis without violating league policies.“NFL announced today that Tom Brady, a minority owner with the Raiders and a broadcaster for Fox, is “prohibited from going to a team facility for practices or production meetings.”But he is allowed to sit in the coaches’ booth, per the league,” Adam Schefter tweeted.The situation highlights the growing complexities in NFL broadcasting, where former players often occupy dual roles within the league.

Handshake drama becomes ugly! India vs Pakistan Asia Cup 2025 in DANGER?

Clips of the handshake between Suryakumar Yadav and Mohsin Naqvi quickly went viral, fuelling backlash among Indian fans. (Image credit: ACC)

Former Pakistan cricket captain Shahid Afridi has criticised the Indian cricket team for refusing post-match handshakes after India's seven-wicket victory against Pakistan in the Asia Cup Group A match at Dubai International Stadium on Sunday.The incident led to tensions between the teams, with Pakistan Cricket Board threatening to withdraw from the tournament over match referee Andy Pyrcroft's role and Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha skipping the post-match presentation.The situation escalated when Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav and his team declined customary post-match greetings with their Pakistani counterparts. Pakistan coach Mike Hesson expressed disappointment over the incident.""When the Asia Cup began, social media was filled with the boycott campaigns ahead of the match between India and Pakistan. Considering there was pressure, it is no surprise that the players and the BCCI were told not to shake hands with our team,"" Afridi stated during a discussion on Samaa TV.The match was preceded by widespread calls for boycott on social media in India, with fans opposing the game due to national sentiments.""In my opinion, there was no sportsman spirit. They would once again be shamed in front of the world. I think our stance was bang on. Our PCB chairman has taken the right stand. Overall, it's outstanding,"" Afridi commented.""I have always said that players should be great ambassadors and not an embarrassment. I don't want to fault the Indian cricketers; they were given orders from up above,"" he added.The Pakistan Cricket Board had threatened to pull out of the Asia Cup if the International Cricket Council (ICC) did not remove match referee Andy Pycroft for the remaining tournament matches. Their official complaint with the ICC, however, has been quashed. Yet, as TimesofIndia.com reported, Pycroft will not be part of the officials team for Pakistan's match against the UAE on Wednesday.Following India's victory, Suryakumar dedicated the win to the Indian Armed Forces, expressing solidarity with Pahalgam terror victims.The controversy extended to events before the tournament when Suryakumar faced criticism on social media for shaking hands with ACC head Mohsin Naqvi and Pakistan captain Agha during the official captain's press conference.""The same Suryakumar Yadav shook hands with Salman Agha and Mohsin Naqvi at the captain's press conference. Now in front of the crowd, the government was not able to handle the social media pressure.

The Saudi Pro League 2025-26 season is about to begin, and anticipation is high. As clubs have invested in experienced names. But there’s also a spotlight on younger players. These rising stars are expected to make a strong impact. Also offers both skill and energy. From local talent to international prospects, five players stand out as ones to watch this year.Musab Al Juwayr is widely seen as one of Saudi Arabia ’s brightest midfielders. At just 22, he already carries the weight of expectation after winning the 2024-25 RSL Young Player of the Year award. His move from Al Hilal to Al Qadsiah was one of the most notable transfers of the summer.Al Juwayr spent two seasons on loan at Al Shabab, where his passing vision and control in midfield drew praise. Last season, he registered five goals and ten assists. This underlines his ability to both create and finish chances. With Al Qadsiah now boasting a stronger squad, his partnership with their attackers could shape the club’s progress this campaign. Fans see him as the heartbeat of the side, and his performances will be under the microscope from the first whistle.South African forward Mohau Nkota is another young name set to make headlines. Al Ettifaq surprised many with his signing. But the decision reflects confidence in his potential, and at 20, Nkota has already shown promise for Orlando Pirates. Also, scored both in domestic matches and the CAF Champions League His pace and direct style of play are expected to give Al Ettifaq more options in attack, and manager Saad Al Shehri has built a reputation for developing youth, and Nkota could benefit from that environment. Last season, his numbers included three goals and three assists in South Africa’s top league, as well as four goals in continental competition. With the club's backing, Nkota has a chance to turn raw promise into consistent output in Saudi football.Alongside Al Juwayr and Nkota, three more players complete the list of exciting prospects. Unai Hernandez, the 20-year-old Spanish midfielder, joined Al Ittihad after leaving Barcelona. He has already settled into life in Jeddah, collecting a league winner’s medal last season. With more playing time expected under Laurent Blanc. Hernandez’s technical ability could make him a regular starter.Renne Rivas, a 22-year-old Venezuelan left-back, impressed in his debut RSL season for Al Taawoun, his defensive strength and ability to contribute in attack helped the team secure a top-eight finish, along with the return of coach Pericles Chamusca, Rivas is tipped to build on his progress.Finally, Marcos Leonardo of Al Hilal has already proven himself as a reliable striker. The Brazilian scored 17 goals in 24 RSL matches last season and delivered a standout performance in the FIFA Club World Cup. At just 22, his scoring instincts make him one of the league’s most dangerous young forwards.The Saudi Pro League has become a stage for both experienced stars and rising talents. Musab Al Juwayr and Mohau Nkota lead the way. But Hernandez, Rivas, and Leonardo are equally important to their teams.Read More: Why top European stars are choosing Saudi Arabia over Europe","The Saudi Pro League 2025-26 season is about to begin.

Indian javelin thrower Sachin Yadav grabbed headlines earlier this year when he made a massive throw of 84.39m to clinch the gold medal and break the decade-old meet record at the National Games in Dehradun.It wasn’t his first throw above 80m, but his performance at the National Games made people take notice of the 6-foot-5 athlete from Uttar Pradesh. He continued his fine form in the Asian Athletics Championships, his first international meet, and grabbed the silver medal with another huge throw of 85.16m, behind Arshad Nadeem’s 86.4m.His focus now is on delivering another strong performance as he makes his maiden appearance at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo on Wednesday. Sachin, who has been training under coach Naval Singh, believes that none of this would have been possible without Neeraj Chopra ’s gold medal-winning feat at the Tokyo Olympics four years ago.“Before Neeraj bhai won the gold in Tokyo, whenever I used to go and train, people used to make snide remarks and ask me whether I was going on a hunt or going to impale somebody,” said the 25-year-old. “But after 2021, people got to know that javelin throw is also a sport. My friends keep asking me about how I am doing. My parents, too, feel proud because they never dreamt that something like this would happen.”And now that he will compete at the Worlds, all he wants to do is give his best.“I just hope that there will be two athletes on the podium from India, if not more,” added Sachin.He is also looking forward to competing with Neeraj at one of the biggest stages for the first time since the Neeraj Chopra Classic, where he injured his left ankle. “After I twisted my ankle, like an elder brother, he kept enquiring whether I was doing alright and motivated me to stay confident. He reminds me not to do anything that will hamper my health,” the athlete added.His training trip to Poland was sadly affected by the injury, which forced him to focus primarily on rehabilitation. As a result, he couldn’t perform at his best at the Bronze-level Continental Tour meet in Bhubaneswar either.However, he made a strong comeback at the Inter-State Senior Championships in Chennai, securing a silver medal with a throw of 83.20m. Whether he can maintain this momentum remains to be seen, but it will certainly be a sight to behold with four Indians competing together on the biggest stage.","Indian javelin thrower Sachin Yadav will compete at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo.

Chris Broussard explains why Jalen Hurts is still left out of the elite quarterback club with Patrick Mahomes and Joe Burrow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/chris-broussard-explains-why-jalen-hurts-is-still-left-out-of-the-elite-quarterback-club-with-patrick-mahomes-and-joe-burrow/articleshow/123934476.cms,"Jalen Hurts (Image credits: IG/X)

Why Jalen Hurts continues to be left out of the elite quarterback club

Passing numbers still leave him outside the elite tier

Running ability praised but not seen as exceptional

Success alone may not win the “elite” tag yet

Jalen Hurts has transformed the Philadelphia Eagles into perennial contenders and earned admiration for his calm leadership. Yet when conversations turn to the NFL’s most elite quarterbacks, his name rarely lands alongside Patrick Mahomes Joe Burrow , or Lamar Jackson. Analysts argue that while Hurts inspires confidence on the field, his statistical record hasn’t convinced the wider football world.On First Things First, analyst Chris Broussard laid out why Hurts still gets overlooked. “The reason he’s not viewed like Lamar, Patrick and Joe Burrow is because he doesn’t put up the numbers,” Broussard said. “He’s never thrown for 4,000 yards. He’s never thrown 25 touchdowns in a year. He’s never averaged 250 yards in a game for a season.”Those benchmarks may sound arbitrary, but in a league dominated by aerial fireworks, they’ve become the thresholds for elite recognition. For Hurts, who thrives in efficiency and versatility, the absence of these markers continues to shape the perception of his ceiling.Beyond yardage and touchdowns, Broussard spotlighted Hurts’ passer rating as another missing piece in the puzzle. “He’s never had a passer rating of even 105,” Broussard emphasized. “He hasn’t put up the numbers.”That critique underscores a harsher reality — quarterbacks are often defined not by wins or leadership, but by whether their stat lines dazzle on spreadsheets.Hurts’ measured playmaking and balanced approach, though effective for Philadelphia, hasn’t fed the narrative of numerical dominance.Hurts’ dual-threat ability should, in theory, tilt the scales in his favor. Yet here, too, Broussard drew comparisons that leave him trailing behind. “Even though he’s a dual-threat quarterback and a very good runner, he’s not Josh or Lamar as far as running the football,” he explained. “Most of his running touchdowns are the tush push.”It is a paradox that defines Hurts’ career — his most effective weapon also gets downplayed because it doesn’t look as explosive as Jackson’s bursts or Allen’s improvisations.The debate over Hurts reveals the tension between production and perception in modern football. While he has led his team to consistent success, critics like Broussard argue that greatness in today’s NFL is measured as much by gaudy numbers as by victories. Until Hurts rewrites his statistical story, the “elite” tag may remain just out of reach.Also read: Antonio Brown sets social media on fire with bold, viral comment about Baker Mayfield’s heated moment with C.J.

Breaking records and looking ahead

Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone caught all the eyeballs in the women's 400 meters semifinal at the 2025 World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, crushing the field in 48.29 seconds. Not only did this stunning time earn her the semifinal win, it also broke the 14-year-old American record of Sanya Richards-Ross (48.70 seconds, in 2006). That result makes McLaughlin-Levrone the world No. 7 all-time in the event, a testament to her amazing abilities and will.Racing under the floodlights of the National Stadium, McLaughlin-Levrone proved too strong to be anything but first off the line and remained in full control of her race. After winning the semifinal in a personal best and world-leading times, she's ready for a great final. In the lead-up to perhaps the most-anticipated race of the day, she and two other elite athletes, currently looming to challenge 400m World Champion from Paris 2024, Marileidy Paulino (Dominican Republic), and Bahrain's Salwa Eid Naser, who have run the closest-to-field top times of the season, would be expected to go head-to-head against one another later.Also Read: World Athletics C'ships: Duplantis breaks world record for 14th time; New Zealand's Beamish makes history Breaking the American record is something that McLaughlin-Levrone said was surprising and something to be grateful for.

However, she wasn't celebrating too hard because ""focus"" is the name of the game when it comes to the final, where she hopes to keep going with her 400-meter rise. Owing to her run, a fresh debate sparks over whether the world record of 47.60 seconds, set in 1985 by East Germany's Marita Koch, is now a prospect for the current generation of athletes.As the final race approaches in a few days, all eyes will be on Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, whose blend of speed, strategy, and resilience has made her a formidable contender on the global stage.","Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone won the women's 400 meters semifinal in 48.29 seconds.

Why Majed Abdullah was nicknamed the “Desert Pelé”

Majed Abdullah’s lasting legacy on and off the pitch

Majed Abdullah was not just a footballer; he was a beacon for a generation when he took to the football pitch. A revered figure all over the kingdom and the greater Arab world, Majed was bestowed with his affectionate moniker the ‘Desert Pelé’ due to his skill, his goalscoring record, and his impact being a transposed mirror image of Pelé set in the sun-drenched sands of the Arabian Peninsula.His journey, from the youth sides in Jeddah and Riyadh through to becoming the all-time top scorer in the history of the national team, and a one-club legend with Al-Nassr, is the story of the national game in Saudi Arabia.During Saudi Arabia’s maiden FIFA World Cup finals appearance in 1994, Western media referred to Majed Abdullah as the ‘Desert Pelé’. Back then, he was characterized as dribbling beautifully, scoring numerous goals, and leading the field, characteristics of the world's top forwards. The comparison was never one Abdullah himself saw as fair, yet fans and journalists clung to the nickname out of admiration.In multiple ways, he copied Pelé and made use of Pelé's signature characteristics: scoring goals with high frequency in his club and national team, capable of big match performances, and faithful to his club. He spent his entire club career at Al-Nassr from 1977 to 1998, being the top scorer of the league six times.A total of 72 goals in 117 appearances for the Saudi national team made him the country’s all-time leading scorer. He also secured two AFC Asian Cup titles with the country, his influence brought the national side into the international arena.Also Read: Partner of the Saudi Pro League star Cristiano Ronaldo, Georgina Rodriguez, stuns in chic NY looks Majed Abdullah’s impact on the field was greater than his number of goals. He helped in making Al-Nassr a powerhouse in Saudi Arabian football, winning numerous league championships and domestic cups. His international play raised the profile of Saudi football, which in turn led to more frequent and deeper runs in Asian competitions and World Cup qualifiers.Abdullah remains a legendary figure off the pitch. Even years after his retirement back in 1998, he continued to have the persona of a popular amazement. He has been showered with testimonial matches, polls among Gulf players and fans consistently name him as one of the best, and he is often mentioned as a representative of sport in the region. His status as “Desert Pelé” is more than a nickname; it encapsulates what he meant for a country and for Arab football.","Majed Abdullah was nicknamed the ‘Desert Pelé’ due to his skill, his goalscoring record, and his impact.
