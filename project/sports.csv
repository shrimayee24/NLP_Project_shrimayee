England playing XI for fourth Test vs India:

Poll Is Liam Dawson's inclusion a good decision by the England selectors? Definitely Not sure No, they should have picked someone else

England have confirmed one change to their playing XI for the fourth Test against India at Old Trafford, starting Wednesday. Hampshire all-rounder Liam Dawson replaces the injured Shoaib Bashir, marking his first Test appearance since July 2017.Dawson, a seasoned domestic performer, offers depth with both bat and ball on what is expected to be a spin-friendly surface in Manchester.Dawson steps in for Shoaib Bashir, who suffered a broken finger on his left hand during the first innings of last week's Lord's Test but showed great resilience by taking the final wicket to secure a 2-1 series lead for England. Bashir has since undergone surgery, with a wire inserted into his left pinkie to ensure proper healing. In Bashir's absence, Dawson will earn his fourth Test cap, with his last appearance dating back to July 2017 against South Africa.As a left-arm spinner, Dawson has claimed 371 first-class wickets. He has been particularly impressive in recent seasons, with 12 of his 15 five-wicket hauls—including three ten-wicket matches—coming since 2021. Since the start of the 2023 season, he has taken 124 wickets for Hampshire at an average of 25.64, complemented by 956 runs at 59.75, which earned him the prestigious men's PCA Player of the Year award last year.This summer, Dawson's performance includes 21 wickets at an average of 40.04, with an economy rate of 2.55, along with 536 runs at 44.66. Over the past five seasons, he has scored nine first-class centuries, including three in 2023 and three in 2024.His recent recall to the England squad marks a surprising turnaround, after seeming to have finished his international career. Earlier this summer, he returned to the T20I side after a three-year hiatus, delivering a notable performance of 4 for 20 against the West Indies in his comeback match, captained by England's newly appointed limited-overs captain, Harry Brook.""He's a wily, old fox,"" Brook said at Emirates Old Trafford on Monday. ""He's very experienced and a very skilful cricketer. He's played everywhere, played against everyone so hopefully he can have an amazing performance this week.""As we've seen over the Test series, the footholes have been for the left-handed batters outside off, so hopefully he can land it in the footholes and create a bit of spice and some opportunities to take wickets.""He's willing to always fight for the team, he's very competitive and it's good to have him here."" Zak Crawley , Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (c), Jamie Smith (wk), Liam Dawson, Chris Woakes, Brydon Carse, Jofra Archer.For India, the spotlight is on Anshul Kamboj, the 24-year-old right-arm pacer who could be in line for a memorable Test debut , as reported earlier by TimesofIndia.com.Called up as injury cover, Kamboj has had a whirlwind few days, joining the team on Saturday, meeting Manchester United players on Sunday, and bowling full tilt in Monday’s net session.He impressed the coaching staff, including Gautam Gambhir and Ajit Agarkar, with his accuracy and relentless line and length against top-order batters like KL Rahul, Shubman Gill, and Yashasvi Jaiswal.India’s pace attack has been hit by fitness issues, with Akash Deep still recovering from a groin strain and Arshdeep Singh ruled out due to a hand injury.This leaves Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Shardul Thakur, Prasidh Krishna, and Kamboj as the available seam options. Prasidh’s limited involvement with the new ball during practice hints at a possible debut for Kamboj.Meanwhile, Rishabh Pant has resumed wicketkeeping duties during practice, looking comfortable despite minor discomfort in his left hand.His return behind the stumps is a major boost for India. However, Akash Deep’s fitness test did not go as hoped, making his participation in the Test unlikely.","England confirm one change to playing XI for fourth Test against India.

NAVI MUMBAI: This is no flight of fancy. A Greater flamingo found injured in Nerul's NRI wetland, whose left leg had to be amputated, could soon take to the skies again.Makarand Saraf, a lecturer from Mumbai's All India Institute of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, and his team have successfully fitted a prosthesis on the adolescent bird. However, since the artificial leg only enables it to walk, not fly, the team's next goal is an improvised prosthesis that will help it take wing.The bird, suspected to have got its leg entangled in a fishing net or nylon fishing line, was first spotted by wildlife photographer Abhijit Chattopadhyay, who alerted forest officials led by Vikas Bairagi. After initial treatment, it was released back into the wetlands on May 15. But with it hovering around the same spot, the team decided to give it a prosthetic leg to help it move around.With Dr Anil Gaur, director of the institute, green-signalling the project, Saraf, Chattopadhyay and Bairagi took measurements for the prosthesis on May 17 using a plaster of Paris cast but abandoned a foam impression after noticing the bird's distress from human contact.Two firms then stepped in. Amit Mukerji, director-special projects at Otto Bock Healthcare India Pvt Ltd, supported prosthesis fabrication, while Rushabh Shah of Podiapro India Pvt Ltd provided the inner lining material, with technical inputs from Bhoomiksha Rathore.The team redesigned the leg from a closed-foot to a single-toe open foot with side support to solve buoyancy challenges and fitted it on July 6. The artificial leg has improved the flamingo's balance, mobility and its survival chances.A July 19 check showed no fitment or skin issues.Saraf said, ""The carbon fibre impregnated with a matrix of acrylic resin (carbon fibre used in manufacture of aeroplane parts and F1 racing cars) helped keep the prosthesis light, strong, waterproof, and durable - suitable for a wading bird's lifestyle.""","Greater flamingo found injured in Nerul's NRI wetland.

Poll What impact do you think this policy will have on the 2028 Summer Olympics? Positive, it promotes fairness Negative, it creates division No significant impact

In a sweeping policy shift aligned with a recent federal directive, the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has officially barred transgender women from competing in women’s events at the Olympics and Paralympics.The ban, effective July 21, 2025, stems directly from President Donald Trump’s executive order titled “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports.” The USOPC updated its Athlete Safety Policy with a new subsection titled “Additional Requirements,” referencing both the executive order and the Ted Stevens Olympic & Amateur Sports Act.""The USOPC is committed to protecting opportunities for athletes participating in sport,"" the policy states. ""We will continue to collaborate with stakeholders... to ensure women have a fair and safe competition environment consistent with Executive Order 14201.""In a memo, USOPC CEO Sarah Hirshland and President Gene Sykes told Team USA athletes: “As a federally chartered organisation, we have an obligation to comply with federal expectations.”Trump’s executive order, issued in February 2025, mandates that any school or institution permitting transgender girls to compete in girls' sports will risk losing federal funding.It requires the immediate enforcement of single-sex sports teams and locker rooms, citing Title IX protections for women’s sports.""Our revised policy emphasises the importance of ensuring fair and safe competition environments for women,"" the USOPC reiterated in its message to national governing bodies, urging all affiliated organisations to align with the new standards.The decision also mirrors changes within the NCAA, which recently revised its transgender participation rules to restrict women's competitions to athletes assigned female at birth.The timing of the policy change is significant, as Los Angeles prepares to host the 2028 Summer Olympics.","The United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has officially barred transgender women from competing in women’s events.

Los Angeles Rams take no chances as Jimmy Garoppolo steps in and Matthew Stafford rests to manage back soreness

Jimmy Garoppolo takes the reins at Los Angeles Rams camp, but Matthew Stafford’s hold on QB1 stays firm

The Los Angeles Rams opened 2025 training camp in Thousand Oaks this week without their longtime quarterback under center. Matthew Stafford, now entering his 17th NFL season and fifth with the Rams, is dealing with back soreness—a recurring issue that has prompted a precautionary pause. Instead of participating in drills, Stafford is working off to the side, part of a deliberately modified schedule the team hopes will extend his durability through the regular season. While fans might flinch at the word “back,” head coach Sean McVay isn’t sounding any alarms—he’s doubling down on experience and patience.Speaking to reporters at camp on Monday, July 22, Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay explained the logic behind Stafford’s absence from early training sessions. “He’s been throwing, feeling good. It’s not anything that’s necessarily new — something that he’s dealt with before,” McVay said.Rather than push Matthew Stafford through discomfort, the team has scheduled a ramp-up period lasting the first five or so days of camp. “Going into Year 17, we were going to take a modified approach with him, kind of similar to what we did in the offseason program,” McVay added.The Los Angeles Rams’ approach reflects both Stafford’s medical history and his deep command of the offense.McVay emphasized that if this were a younger quarterback, the story might be different. “If he was a first-year player, then I think you’d say, man, every rep really matters,” he said. “But because of his ability to communicate to me, to [the training staff], I feel really good.”The Rams were already planning to rest Stafford every fourth day during camp, making this adjustment an extension of that long-view strategy.Until Stafford returns later in camp, Jimmy Garoppolo is taking first-team reps. Now in his second season with the Rams, Garoppolo offers security in a pinch and is expected to lead early practices while Stafford works individually.“You do feel fortunate that you’ve got a guy like Jimmy that will step in and do a great job for the first few practices. And then Matthew will be ready to roll,” McVay said.Stafford, who turns 38 in February, threw for 3,762 yards with 20 touchdowns and 8 interceptions last season. The Rams rested him in Week 18 after clinching the NFC West—a move similar in tone to this one.“He feels good about that, I feel good about that,” McVay said. “Ultimately, it’s about having him feel as good as possible — mentally, physically, emotionally — going into Year 17.”With Stafford sidelined to start camp, the Rams aren’t sweating the optics—they’re sticking to the plan. McVay’s messaging is clear: this is about preserving their veteran leader, not replacing him. As the team builds toward Week 1, Stafford’s rest today is part of ensuring he’s ready tomorrow. Training camp may have started without its star quarterback under center, but the Rams are betting that patience in July pays off when it counts in September.Also Read: Russell Wilson won’t save the New York Giants—but Brian Daboll is counting on him to fix them","The Los Angeles Rams opened training camp this week without their longtime quarterback under center.

Familiarity and Culture Could Tip the Scales

Themay be looking at a reunion with one of their most valuable defensive assets,, as the 2025 NBA free agency market heats up. The veteran guard is reportedly drawing serious interest from multiple contenders, but the Warriors remain firmly in the mix as a possible landing spot.According to NBA insider Evan Sidery, five teams have expressed strong interest in Gary Payton II:- Milwaukee Bucks- Miami Heat- Los Angeles Lakers- Phoenix Suns- Golden State WarriorsEach of these teams is hoping to bolster their perimeter defense and bench depth heading into the 2025-26 season. However, for Golden State, this isn’t just about plugging a gap — it’s about bringing back a familiar face who already understands their system and championship culture.From the Golden State Warriors ’ viewpoint, a potential return of Gary Payton II makes more than just sentimental sense. He was a key piece during their 2022 title run, anchoring the perimeter defense and injecting energy whenever he stepped on the floor. The Warriors know exactly what Payton brings — and that kind of reliability is hard to find in free agency.Last season, Payton played 62 games and put up the following stats:While his scoring numbers may not jump off the page, it’s Payton’s defensive prowess and hustle plays that make him invaluable — especially for a Warriors roster in need of better point-of-attack defense.With the Golden State Warriors aiming to maximize the remainder of Stephen Curry ’s prime, every move this offseason carries weight. Adding a player like Payton — who already knows the Warriors’ playbook and thrives in a fast-paced, switch-heavy defensive scheme — could solidify their second unit and help bridge the gap between stars and role players.The Phoenix Suns have also emerged as a prominent suitor. According to the data available, the Suns made 14.3 three-pointers per game last season, shooting 37.8% from beyond the arc. Payton’s addition could bring them more balance defensively, but it’s unclear if Phoenix can offer him the same opportunity — or familiarity — that Golden State can.It’s not just about the numbers. Gary Payton II is deeply connected to the Golden State Warriors’ identity — and they know how to use him effectively. His last stint in the Bay Area proved he could thrive under Steve Kerr’s system, playing a hybrid guard-forward role and often defending the opponent’s best perimeter scorer.Sidery reports that Payton’s return to Golden State is “a possibility,” indicating that the front office remains open to bringing him back into the fold.“The Milwaukee Bucks, Miami Heat, Los Angeles Lakers, Phoenix Suns, and Golden State Warriors are all keeping tabs on the defensive-minded guard,” wrote Evan Sidery, outlining the level of league-wide interest.For the Golden State Warriors, bringing back Gary Payton II isn’t just about nostalgia — it’s a strategic move that could solidify their bench defense and add a trusted locker room presence. As free agency continues to unfold, Golden State remains in the hunt, hoping that familiarity, fit, and the lure of another title run can tip the scales in their favor.Also read: Colin Cowherd Claims LeBron James Has Accepted He’ll Never Surpass Michael Jordan’s Legacy: ""MJ makes you feel something but LJ Doesn't"" With contenders circling, the next few days may determine whether Payton suits up in blue and gold once again — or becomes a defensive anchor elsewhere.",The Golden State Warriors may be looking at a reunion with Gary Payton II.

Marcus Smart

Luka Doncic Steps Into a New Role

A Pitch Built on Fit and Purpose

Why Smart Chose LA Over Other Contenders

How Luka Doncic’s Influence is Growing in LA

Thehave made headlines by signing, a former NBA Defensive Player of the Year, to a two-year, $11 million contract after his buyout with the Washington Wizards . While the front office worked diligently to fill the team’s defensive void, it was the unusually direct involvement of superstar Luka Doncic that tipped the scales in LA’s favor—an effort Smart himself has described as both surprising and impactfulIn a surprising shift from his usual stance of staying away from personnel matters, Luka Doncic took a proactive role in recruiting Marcus Smart. According to multiple reports, Luka contacted Smart several times, selling him on the Los Angeles Lakers’ vision and how vital his presence would be to their success.Smart, who’s had his share of battles with Doncic on the court, was taken aback by the gesture.“When you get a guy like Luka calling, referencing, checking on you, trying to see where you’re at, to see if you want to come, join something special that he’s trying to cook up over here… that meant a lot,” Marcus Smart said. “I’ve played against Luka a lot… and now being on his side means a lot.”Doncic’s pitch went beyond the glamor of Los Angeles . He made a basketball-first argument, highlighting two key areas where Smart could make an immediate difference:- Defensive Leader: Luka emphasized Smart’s ability to be the Los Angeles Lakers’ defensive cornerstone, especially after the departure of Dorian Finney-Smith left a hole in on-ball defense and perimeter toughness.- Veteran Presence: Doncic underscored how Smart could be the vocal locker room leader on a team blending young talent with veterans, a trait LA sorely lacked during last year’s playoff shortcomings.Marcus Smart recalled how the recruitment started to feel serious after repeated outreach from Doncic: “I’m working out, and I get a call from my agent—‘Hey, Luka’s reached out.’ I brushed it off at first. But then it happened again. And now it’s real. That’s when it hit me—this is something worth exploring.”Smart reportedly received interest from playoff hopefuls like the Suns and Bucks. But Doncic’s involvement and the clear role offered by the Los Angeles Lakers tipped the scales. The opportunity to be a centerpiece of the Lakers’ defensive scheme—and to partner with Doncic, one of the league’s premier stars—proved irresistible.Marcus Smart Career Snapshot:- Points: 10.6 PPG- Assists: 4.6 APG- Rebounds: 3.4 RPG- Awards: 2022 Defensive Player of the Year, 3x All-Defensive First Team- 2024-25: Played 34 games, shot 34.8% from three, remained a top-tier defenderIf Marcus Smart stays healthy, the Lakers now have the versatile, gritty defender they’ve lacked—someone who can guard multiple positions and provide structure to a team chasing another title.Luka Doncic’s successful recruitment of Marcus Smart signals more than a roster move—it shows a shift in his evolution as a franchise player. Once hesitant to meddle in front office decisions, Doncic is now stepping into a leadership role that extends off the court. His involvement helped shape the Los Angeles Lakers’ offseason narrative and could redefine how the team operates in the post-LeBron era.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers Reportedly Among Five Contenders Eyeing $26.2 Million Golden State Warriors Star in Free Agency With Luka Doncic orchestrating the offense and Smart anchoring the defense, Lakers fans have every reason to be optimistic.

Following a disappointing first-round playoff exit, thehave wasted no time reshaping their roster for the 2025-26 NBA season. In a Western Conference that has only become tougher, the front office is swinging for the fences, and a new trade idea floated by Sports Illustrated’s Rohan Raman could be the biggest move yet.According to Raman, the Lakers could be looking to offload point guardin a blockbuster deal that brings two-time All-Star center Nikola Vucevic to Los Angeles.“Vucevic would be able to drastically improve LA’s spacing and give them another offensive option that can relieve pressure from their big three,” Raman wrote. “He’s also a presence on the boards and can generate second-chance points for LA.”Here’s how Raman’s full trade scenario would look across three teams:This trade sees the Lakers parting ways with a struggling point guard, two second-round picks, and a first-round swap to land a skilled veteran center.The Los Angeles Lakers have already made notable offseason moves:- Signed Jake LaRavia and Deandre Ayton - Re-signed Jaxson Hayes- Waived two guards to accommodate Marcus SmartWith Ayton now the starting big man, Vucevic wouldn’t be an urgent need. However, Hayes’ consistency as a backup remains uncertain. That’s where Vucevic becomes a valuable option.Despite not being a rim protector, Vucevic’s ability to stretch the floor, score in the low post, and rebound effectively makes him an enticing option. His pick-and-pop game could be a seamless fit next to stars like LeBron James and Anthony Davis, especially in half-court sets.Gabe Vincent’s time in Los Angeles appears to be nearing its end. After two lackluster seasons, the Lakers likely see him as a movable piece.“Vincent has been a good perimeter defender and capable shooter in the past for the Heat, and it’s possible he could find that form with Chicago,” Raman noted.The Bulls, on the other hand, may view Vincent as a reclamation project who could thrive in a new setting.While the starting center role belongs to Ayton, adding Vucevic would deepen the Lakers’ frontcourt and bring in another proven scorer and rebounder. Here’s a quick look at how the depth chart could shape up if this trade were to happen:This kind of depth would give the Lakers more flexibility, especially in playoff matchups where spacing and offensive rebounding can tip the scales.Though speculative, this trade idea underlines the Lakers’ aggressive stance this offseason. They’re clearly not content with just small upgrades, and if they can find the right deal, Nikola Vucevic could be the next major addition in their title pursuit.As Rohan Raman emphasized, the move “would be able to drastically improve LA’s spacing,” something the Lakers sorely lacked during their postseason run.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors Predicted to Land $48 Million ex-Boston Celtics Star in Bold 3-Team Trade Proposal Whether this idea gains traction or remains on the drawing board, one thing is clear — the Lakers are not standing still.",The Los Angeles Lakers have wasted no time reshaping their roster for the 2025-26 NBA season.

My Verdict on This Trade Proposal: A Trade to Avoid

A new trade proposal circulating online has stirred debate amongfans and analysts alike. The hypothetical three-team deal would land the Warriors a promising but injury-prone center, a pair of second-round picks, and two additional players. However, it may come at a significant cost to their current rotation and long-term strategy.The trade idea, originally shared by OhhGabe on Fanspo, outlines the following exchange among three NBA teams:This deal is designed to address Golden State’s most pressing issue: their lack of a consistent starting center. With the front office hesitant to play Draymond Green at the five for extended stretches, there’s a clear need for a rim protector who can ease the defensive burden on their aging core.At 6-foot-9, Robert Williams III offers elite shot-blocking and rebounding when healthy. His athleticism and paint presence could potentially solidify Golden State’s defense during the regular season. With veteran bigs like Al Horford being speculated as short-term free agent options, Williams might seem like a more dynamic, long-term solution.Adding Matisse Thybulle would also give the Golden State Warriors a perimeter defender who can guard multiple positions, and Rayan Rupert brings upside as a young, versatile wing.The inclusion of two second-round picks adds some future draft capital.Despite its surface appeal, the deal has significant flaws — particularly for the Golden State Warriors . As Jeremy Kruger of The Sporting News wrote, “This Warriors trade idea makes absolutely no sense.” That sentiment is echoed across several points of concern:- Robert Williams III has only appeared in 61 games over the last three seasons due to repeated injuries.- Matisse Thybulle has struggled with availability and hasn’t proven he can stay healthy for a full season either.- Thybulle is widely recognized as an elite defender, but his offensive game remains virtually non-existent. In a system built around spacing and shooting, that’s a serious limitation.The Warriors would be giving up too many rotation pieces, including their best bench scorer in Buddy Hield and a developing young guard in Moody, who is slated to start. Even Jackson-Davis, despite a lackluster second season, could provide more reliable minutes than Robert Williams III due to the latter’s constant injury concerns.While the idea of acquiring a rim protector might appeal to Golden State’s front office, this particular trade lacks balance. It sacrifices too much depth and relies heavily on the health of two players who’ve proven unreliable.Unless the Warriors can acquire a healthier and more well-rounded center without dismantling their rotation, staying the course may be the wiser move. As Jeremy Kruger aptly puts it, “The Warriors should absolutely stay away from this ludicrous trade idea.”Also read: Bradley Beal’s Selfless Jersey Move Honors Chris Paul’s Clippers Homecoming This deal may stir debate on fan forums, but when the dust settles, it’s clear the Warriors have more to lose than gain.","A new trade proposal circulating online has stirred debate amongfans and analysts alike.

What is Bradley Beal's

Clippers’ Bold Roster Reload

Thehave made major waves this offseason, but perhaps the most talked-about moment isn’t a blockbuster trade or flashy signing—it’s a jersey number. When, one of the team’s newest additions, learned that veteran point guardwas returning to the Clippers, he made a selfless decision: he gave up his jersey number without hesitation. Chris Paul , a future Hall of Famer and beloved figure in Los Angeles Clippers history, is rejoining the franchise for what could be his final NBA season. From 2011 to 2017, Paul was the engine of the “Lob City” era, and he still ranks among the franchise’s all-time leaders in assists and steals. Just as iconic as his play is the number on his back—No. 3.Throughout his storied career with the Hornets, Los Angeles Clippers, Rockets, Suns, Warriors , and Spurs, Paul has always worn No. 3. It’s more than a jersey; it’s his identity—“CP3.”Bradley Beal, who’s worn No. 3 since his rookie days with the Wizards and most recently with the Suns, was faced with a choice when Paul’s return was imminent. Rather than let it become a point of contention, Beal immediately offered to give up the number. Los Angeles Clippers president Lawrence Frank shared the story during a media session: “Once Brad learned that Chris might be returning, he expressed: ‘I want to give my number, and I don’t think Chris is even aware of this yet.’It’s fantastic that Brad made such a generous gesture.”No negotiations, no ego—just respect.Beal’s decision is about more than a number:- Respecting Legacy: Despite being a three-time All-Star, Beal acknowledged Paul’s deeper connection with No. 3 and the Los Angeles Clippers.- Setting a Culture: Beal’s unselfish act establishes a tone of humility and teamwork—crucial for a roster full of big names and big expectations.- Boosting Chemistry: With stars like Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, John Collins, and now Paul and Beal, team dynamics will be under the microscope. Beal’s move is a positive early sign.As Paul reclaims his iconic No. 3, Beal hasn’t announced what number he’ll wear next. While that decision is pending, the lasting impact of his classy gesture is already being felt in the locker room and among fans.The jersey handoff comes amid a massive roster revamp:- Chris Paul’s return- James Harden re-signing- John Collins added via trade- Bradley Beal signed after his Suns buyoutOn paper, the Los Angeles Clippers are stacked with veteran talent. But success will hinge on chemistry, sacrifice, and health. Beal’s gesture is an early sign that egos may be checked at the door.In an NBA landscape often dominated by stats and contracts, Bradley Beal’s decision to hand over his long-held No. 3 jersey to Chris Paul stands out as a rare and powerful moment of respect and sportsmanship. It’s a reminder that greatness isn’t just about what players do on the court—but how they carry themselves off of it.Also read: Pacers Star Tyrese Haliburton Reacts to Myles Turner’s Departure to the Milwaukee Bucks Amid Injury Setback: "" He Has Done Some Great Things Here!""

FAQs



1. Why are the

Edmonton Oilers

targeting the Chicago Blackhawks for a goaltender?

2. Which Blackhawks goalies could be available for trade?

3. What’s delaying the Oilers’ goaltending decision?

Desperation is building in Edmonton, and for good reason. With Connor McDavid in his prime and the Oilers still falling just short of Stanley Cup glory, patience is thinning fast. After the Vancouver Canucks refused to trade promising goaltender Arturs Silovs within the division, the Oilers are reportedly shifting their gaze eastward—toward Connor Bedard’s Chicago Blackhawks, who may soon find themselves with one netminder too many.It’s no secret that goaltending has been Edmonton’s Achilles' heel. While Stuart Skinner and Calvin Pickard have done enough to guide the Oilers deep into the playoffs, their inconsistency has become too loud to ignore. Edmonton hasn’t lifted the Stanley Cup since 1990, and every passing year without silverware only adds to the urgency.Now, with the Silovs door slammed shut by Vancouver—reportedly refusing to trade him “at any price,” per Kurt Leavins of Edmonton Journal—the Oilers have resumed their search with a different target in mind. Initially, Michael DiPietro of the Boston Bruins seemed like a potential backup option. However, recent rumblings suggest that Blackhawks General Manager Stan Bowman might be open to discussions before the season kicks off.“[Oilers GM] Stan Bowman will continue to look for a goaltender before the start of the season. The Blackhawks might have three healthy NHL netminders in training camp—just something to keep tabs on,” Chicago Hockey Now reported.The Blackhawks might soon face a logjam in net, especially if Arvid Soderblom remains on the roster. While he’s currently filed for salary arbitration as a restricted free agent, it’s widely expected that the Blackhawks, who have over $21 million in cap space, will ink him to a one-year deal. If that happens, Chicago could enter camp with Soderblom, Drew Commesso, and Spencer Knight all competing for two spots.Of the trio, only Knight appears untouchable, having been acquired in a high-profile move. That leaves Soderblom and Commesso as potential candidates should Edmonton wish to bolster its depth chart. After missing out on Silovs due to inter-divisional politics, the Oilers might now find a more cooperative trade partner in Chicago.Whether or not Edmonton can pull off a deal, one thing is clear: the clock is ticking. For a franchise this close to glory, failing to upgrade the crease might not just stall momentum—it could shatter the entire structure built around McDavid’s prime.The Oilers are exploring Chicago’s goaltending surplus after Vancouver refused to trade Arturs Silovs within the division.Arvid Soderblom and Drew Commesso are the most likely trade options, as Spencer Knight is expected to be untouchable.Edmonton is still assessing trade possibilities after missing out on Silovs, with the timing of any deal still uncertain.Also Read: How will Porter Martone’s NCAA decision impact the Flyers’ long-term roster plans?",The Edmonton Oilers are reportedly looking to trade for a goaltender.

FAQs

1. What was Brad Marchand's infamous invisible Stanley Cup kiss?

2. Why did Ryan Kesler criticize Marchand after that game?

3. Has Marchand won the Stanley Cup since that moment?

Brad Marchand, ""The Rat,"" secured his second consecutive Stanley Cup with the Florida Panthers, following a significant trade from the Boston Bruins. His move generated considerable fuzz, yet he quickly became a vital player in the Panthers' back-to-back championship run. Marchand's notorious antics, including an iconic invisible Stanley Cup celebration against the Canucks in 2013, underscore his reputation for getting under opponents' skin.After a heated on-ice exchange, former Canucks player Ryan Kesler expressed his strong belief in sportsmanship. He emphasized the importance of conducting oneself with dignity, regardless of the outcome, phrasing, ""Obviously no class. I’m a firm believer you win with class and you lose with class.""Marchand, nevertheless, offered a different perspective on the incident. He clarified that his actions were a direct response to what he perceived as a physical provocation, articulating, ""I did it after he was eye-gouging me.

1. How long is Kaapo Kakko's new contract with the Seattle Kraken?

2. What is the average annual value of Kakko's contract?

3. How did Kakko perform last season with the Kraken and Rangers?

The Seattle Kraken are locking in their future with a bold move, officially signing forward Kaapo Kakko to a three-year, $13.575 million contract that extends through the 2027–28 NHL season. The 24-year-old Finn, who was acquired from the New York Rangers in a mid-season trade, has quickly earned the trust of Seattle’s front office and coaching staff, carving out a crucial role in the team’s offensive scheme.Since his arrival in December, Kakko has made a strong impression. In just 49 games with the Kraken, he tallied 10 goals and 20 assists, blending his physical presence and high hockey IQ to elevate Seattle’s attack. His January performance against the Los Angeles Kings — where he tied his career-high with three assists — further underlined his ability to produce under pressure. That showing helped solidify his spot as a top contributor, finishing the season ranked second in team points and third in assists.Kraken general manager Jason Botterill didn’t hide his enthusiasm about the extension. “Getting a contract done with Kaapo was a top priority this summer,” Botterill said.“We knew quickly he’d be a big part of our team moving forward. He’s got size, skill and tremendous playmaking ability, and isn’t afraid of going to the net. He fit in immediately with our group, and we’re thrilled to have him under contract.”Originally selected second overall in the 2019 NHL Draft by the Rangers, Kakko came to Seattle as part of a trade that sent defenseman Will Borgen and two draft picks to New York. The change of scenery has proved fruitful. Last season, split between both franchises, Kakko recorded a career-best 44 points, with 14 goals and 30 assists — showcasing consistency and an evolving offensive edge.As the Kraken continue building toward long-term success, securing Kakko sends a strong message. He’s no longer just a promising prospect — he’s now a cornerstone of Seattle’s present and future.Kaapo Kakko signed a three-year deal with the Kraken, running through the 2027–28 NHL season.The average annual value of Kakko’s contract is $4.525 million.Kakko recorded a career-high 44 points, including 14 goals and 30 assists across 79 games.Also Read: How will Porter Martone’s NCAA decision impact the Flyers’ long-term roster plans?","Seattle Kraken sign forward Kaapo Kakko to a three-year, $13.575 million contract.

Behind the glitz of NFL sidelines and red-carpet glamour, sports broadcaster Erin Andrews has quietly faced one of the toughest journeys in celebrity motherhood—one marked by loss, resilience, and raw courage. In recent appearances, including the Calm Down Podcast, she has been open about her nearly decade-long struggle with fertility, IVF rounds, surrogacy heartbreak, and a battle with cervical cancer.Reflecting on her experience with IVF, Andrews didn’t hold back. “Full disclosure, it’s not great,” she admitted on the podcast. “But it’s not that bad.” She described how the process, while draining, becomes manageable when viewed in context: “It’s like a month of your life,” she reassured listeners. She advised hopeful parents to prepare early, “Start taking your vitamins and all your supplements now.”Her advice came not from textbooks, but from enduring nine rounds of IVF. Blood draws, daily injections, skipped workouts—she went through it all, often breaking down in fast food drive-thrus just trying to keep going. Andrews admitted she didn’t sugarcoat any of it, nor did she want to.When IVF failed, surrogacy became the next step—but it wasn’t a fairytale.The first attempt ended in devastating loss. But with one embryo left, Erin and her husband, former NHL star Jarret Stoll, found hope. Their surrogate delivered their son Mack after just one push. “Golden embryo,” she called him. That surrogate remains a part of their lives today.Even after Mack’s birth, Andrews faced more pain. A second surrogate miscarried in 2025, and again, she opened up—not for sympathy, but to make others feel less alone.Diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2016, she kept working through surgeries. “I don’t have time for this,” she said. Five days post-op, she was back on the NFL sidelines. Declared cancer-free later that year, she began advocacy efforts and partnered with AstraZeneca to promote screenings. Even in 2025, she revealed a “pre-skin cancer situation,” yet she remains a voice of strength and vulnerability.Also Read: “They live everywhere together”: Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift reportedly share homes across the country as love deepens She went through nearly nine rounds of IVF over the span of a decade.After multiple failed IVF attempts and a heartbreaking surrogacy loss, her son Mack was born via a second surrogate in 2023.Yes, she returned to NFL sideline reporting just five days after surgery and kept her diagnosis private until after recovery.","Erin Andrews has faced one of the toughest journeys in celebrity motherhood.

Micah Parsons Sends Message to Jerry Jones



“I Want to Be Here”: But does the front office want the same?



FAQs



1. What is Micah Parsons' current contract status with the Cowboys?

2. How does Micah Parsons feel about staying with the Cowboys?

3. Why is there tension between Micah Parsons and Jerry Jones?

The Dallas Cowboys are stepping into the 2025 NFL season with renewed leadership but also rising tension. With Brian Schottenheimer now steering the ship and Mike McCarthy stepping aside to eye future coaching opportunities, attention has shifted to one of the team’s brightest stars—Micah Parsons. Once again, contract drama takes center stage in Cowboys Nation, and this time, it’s Parsons laying it all out on the table.Micah Parsons isn’t just another player asking for a raise—he’s the engine of Dallas’ defense, a four-time Pro Bowler, and one of the NFL’s most feared linebackers. Yet as he enters the final year of his rookie deal, he remains without a contract extension. During the team’s training camp in Oxnard, California, Parsons took the opportunity to make his feelings known—and he didn’t hold back.When asked about how close a deal might be, Parsons calmly replied, “...We’ll see.” But it was his next answer that cut deeper. ""You see a lot of people around the league who are taken care of, you wish you had something, you know, that same type of energy,” he said.It’s not hard to see why frustration is creeping in. Players like T.J. Watt, Maxx Crosby, and Myles Garrett have all received top-tier deals—some with multiple years left on their contracts.Parsons, meanwhile, watches from the sidelines, literally and figuratively. Though he’s shown up to camp, he's holding in, choosing not to participate until the Cowboys show their commitment.Despite his frustration, Parsons insists he wants to stay in Dallas. “At the end of the day, they sign the checks. Let’s see if they want me to be here,” he told The Athletic’s Jon Machota. Still, there’s no hiding the sting behind his words: “This isn’t for Jerry. I’m doing this for myself and my teammates.”Owner Jerry Jones hasn't helped the situation. Instead of reassuring fans, he pointed to injury concerns as a reason for not locking down his All-Pro linebacker. His hesitation hasn’t gone unnoticed—nor uncriticized. NFL great J.J. Watt even fired back in a tweet that Parsons eagerly retweeted, reinforcing that the respect Parsons seeks isn’t just about money—it’s about recognition.“If they don’t want me here, they don’t want me here,” Parsons said bluntly. “I’ll go about my business. I understand the nature of the business.” That may be true, but the ball is undeniably in Jerry Jones’ court.If history is any indication, the Cowboys might eventually backtrack with a record-breaking deal—just as they did with Dak Prescott. But every day they wait, the risk grows: of damaging trust, and possibly, of losing one of the NFL’s premier defenders.Parsons is entering the final year of his rookie deal and has yet to receive a contract extension.Parsons has expressed his desire to stay but says, “Let’s see if they want me to be here.”Tension has grown due to Jerry Jones' hesitancy to offer Parsons a new deal, citing injury concerns.Also Read: “I don’t have time”: Erin Andrews exposes dark side of IVF, miscarriage, and cancer in emotional reveal","Micah Parsons is entering the final year of his rookie deal and has yet to receive a contract extension.

In January 2018, NFL legend Tom Brady shocked listeners when he abruptly ended a live radio interview after a host made a crude remark about his young daughter. The incident sparked heated debate about how far is too far when it comes to media criticism—and whether Brady overreacted or drew the line where it needed to be.The controversy began when WEEI radio host Alex Reimer was asked about Tom vs. Time, Brady’s Facebook documentary. Reimer dismissed the opening scene—where Brady’s daughter tells him she’s going to play soccer—as scripted and overly sentimental. But it was his language that made headlines.""His kid’s being an annoying little pissant,"" Reimer said, sparking immediate backlash from fans, media figures, and parents alike. The use of a derogatory term for a child was widely condemned as mean-spirited and unprofessional.A few days later, Brady appeared on WEEI for his regular segment. But instead of talking football, he delivered a calm but firm response: “Someone had made a comment about my daughter,” Brady said. “I’ve tried to come on this show for many years and show you guys a lot of respect... They certainly don’t deserve that.”He added, “I really don’t have much to say this morning.So, maybe I’ll speak with you guys some other time,” before ending the interview early.Reimer was suspended following the backlash, and the station quickly issued an apology. But public opinion was divided. While many praised Brady for defending his daughter, others accused him of being overly sensitive and dodging criticism under the guise of parental outrage.The incident remains one of the most talked-about off-field moments in Tom Brady’s career.

In an era where celebrity power couples dominate headlines, Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift have become a cultural juggernaut. But despite their high-profile relationship, only one of them landed a cameo in Adam Sandler ’s much-anticipated sequel, Happy Gilmore 2—and it wasn’t the global pop sensation.Adam Sandler, 58, revealed the real reason behind choosing NFL star Travis Kelce for a role while leaving Taylor Swift out of the comedy project. Speaking on the red carpet, Sandler said, “Yeah, they love Taylor. I love Taylor. Travis was just nice enough—he wanted to do something so we wrote something for Travis, and when he said yes, my girls were very excited. Including my wife. Everybody loves her.”While many expected Swift to make an appearance alongside her boyfriend, Sandler clarified that it was never in the cards. “We didn’t want to bother Taylor,” he explained. “Just let Taylor entertain the world like she does. I listened to All Too Well three times in a row with my kid. [Taylor's] done a lot for our planet so we love her.”Though Kelce might be new to acting, he impressed his Happy Gilmore 2 co-stars. Actress Julie Bowen sang his praises, saying, “Please, is anybody surprised? He’s a star. He’s always been a star… He continues to be a star.”With that kind of endorsement, it seems Kelce’s Hollywood debut could open doors beyond the gridiron.Despite being arguably one of the most in-demand celebrities in the world, Swift’s absence from the sequel is rooted in respect. Sandler’s sentiment reflects a growing understanding in Hollywood: not every star needs to be everywhere.

In a stunning turn of events that rocked the NFL back in September 2019, wide receiver Antonio Brown — fresh off his controversial exit from the Oakland Raiders and just days into his tenure with the New England Patriots — was hit with a federal lawsuit accusing him of rape and sexual assault. The accuser, Britney Taylor, a former gymnast and trainer who had known Brown since their days at Central Michigan University, filed the civil suit in the Southern District of Florida, detailing three alleged incidents spanning 2017 and 2018.According to the lawsuit, Antonio Brown exposed himself and kissed Taylor without consent during a training session in June 2017. Later that month, while they were watching religious programming together, Brown allegedly masturbated behind Taylor and ejaculated on her back. Taylor reportedly ended their professional relationship but later agreed to resume it after Brown apologized and assured her the behavior would stop.The most severe allegation occurred in May 2018, when Taylor claimed that Brown forcibly raped her in his home. “She tried to resist him, screaming and repeatedly shouting ‘no’ and ‘stop,’” the lawsuit stated. “But Brown refused and penetrated her.”Brown’s legal team immediately denied the claims, issuing a statement that “Mr.Brown denies each and every allegation in the lawsuit.” His lawyer added, “He will pursue all legal remedies to not only clear his name but to also protect other professional athletes against false accusations,” characterizing the lawsuit as financially motivated.Taylor, however, spoke out with a powerful statement: “As a rape victim of Antonio Brown, deciding to speak out has been an incredibly difficult decision. I have found strength in my faith, my family, and from the accounts of other survivors of sexual assault.”The Patriots acknowledged the seriousness of the accusations and said the NFL would be launching its own investigation. Though Brown played one game with New England, he was released just 11 days after joining the team.This controversy became one of the defining scandals of Brown’s career, marking a turning point in how off-field behavior could derail even the most elite athletic legacy.Also Read: Antonio Brown mocks Tom Brady's ex-wife Gisele Bündchen with kiss cam stunt after CEO Andy Byron’s viral concert scandal Former trainer Britney Taylor filed a lawsuit in 2019 accusing Antonio Brown of rape and multiple instances of sexual misconduct.Antonio Brown denied all claims, calling the accusations false and financially motivated through his lawyer.As of the time of the lawsuit, no criminal charges were filed, and the case proceeded as a civil matter in federal court.","Antonio Brown faced a federal lawsuit filed by former trainer Britney Taylor.

What’s next for Ben Askren?



After nearly two harrowing months in the hospital battling severe pneumonia and undergoing a double lung transplant, former UFC and wrestling champion Ben Askren has finally returned home. The 41-year-old fighter, known for his dominance inside the Octagon, shared a heartfelt update from the passenger seat of his car, offering an emotional look at a journey that nearly cost him his life.Ben Askren is out of the hospital and the danger line. “Day 59, I’m out, with my beautiful wife, supporter,” Askren said, his voice cracking in a video shared online. “Man, that was a long journey, and it’s not over because I still can’t really walk. I’ve got to reteach myself to do that, among many other things.”Askren was hospitalized in late May with a severe case of pneumonia, which quickly spiraled into something much more dangerous. A serious staph infection complicated his condition, eventually leading doctors to recommend an emergency double lung transplant. The operation reportedly costs close to $2 million.In an earlier hospital update, Askren revealed, “So, I only died four times, where the ticker stopped for about 20 seconds.”The Olympian’s tone was light, but the situation was anything but. “That’s not ideal, you guys know that,” he joked from his hospital bed in a video dated July 9.Though Askren has little memory of the first month in the hospital— “I don’t remember 35 days of this journey,” he admitted— he’s grateful to have pulled through. The transplant happened just over three weeks before he was discharged. He lost nearly 50 pounds during the ordeal and is currently unable to walk without assistance.Askren, who famously fought Robbie Lawler and Jorge Masvidal in the UFC and was knocked out by Jake Paul in a viral 2021 boxing match, now finds himself in a different spotlight— this time surrounded by compassion instead of competition.“I said this already in one of the videos, but the support you guys gave me, whether it was starting a GoFundMe, whether it was helping my kids and wife get through it… it meant so much,” he said tearfully. “Hopefully I’m not in this situation again for a really, really, really, really long time. I plan on living a while.”Notable names in the combat sports world rallied to help, with UFC president Dana White confirming a $10,000 donation and reports circulating that Jake Paul may have contributed up to $500,000 toward Askren’s medical expenses.Also Read: WNBA star Courtney Williams made a bold move at the All-Star party without knowing the DJ was Diplo Despite stepping away from the cage in 2019, Askren remains heavily involved in youth wrestling through his Askren Wrestling Academy.

Brad Marchand vs Jack Hughes: A tale of two contracts



FAQs



1. What did Brad Marchand say about Jack Hughes' rookie year comments?

2. Why did Jack Hughes say he ""hated"" his rookie NHL season?

3. How do Jack Hughes’ and Brad Marchand’s rookie contracts compare?

Brad Marchand, the 37-year-old Florida Panthers veteran, recently chimed in on viral comments made by 24-year-old New Jersey Devils star Jack Hughes, offering a sarcastic reminder that NHL life, even for rookies, isn’t exactly a hard knock. Marchand's response wasn’t just cheeky—it perfectly illustrated the growing generational gap in hockey, both in mentality and in million-dollar contracts.Jack Hughes, reflecting on his rookie year, sparked buzz when he told ESPN, “I hated it. I was in high school, driving a car my parents paid for. Then the following year, you’re making a million bucks. And then it’s like, oh okay — you’ve got McDavid one night, then you got Marchand the next night, then Crosby the next night.”While Hughes was clearly speaking to the mental and emotional toll of suddenly going pro, the internet found his ""I hated it"" line ripe for interpretation. So did Marchand. The Panthers forward caught the quote on Hockey Forever’s Instagram and didn’t hold back. “Tough making 1m at 18, I can see why ya hated it,” he commented, dripping in sarcasm.It was classic Marchand—equal parts dry wit and subtle jab. But behind the humor lies a veteran perspective, one shaped by years of grinding through the NHL’s system before becoming a mainstay.Jack Hughes and Brad Marchand both cracked the NHL at different stages in league history, and their early paydays reflect that. Marchand, selected 71st overall in 2006, entered on a modest three-year, $2.55 million deal with Boston. Hughes, by contrast, was a No. 1 overall pick in 2019, immediately signing a three-year, $11.325 million rookie contract.Their paths have led them to big money now. Marchand, aging like fine wine, secured a six-year, $31.5 million extension that runs through age 43. Meanwhile, Hughes is locked into a deal with an $8 million AAV until 2029-30.While their timelines and experiences differ, both stars have found their lane in the league. Still, Marchand's well-timed dig proves that with age comes not just wisdom—but the confidence to poke fun at the next generation.Marchand sarcastically responded, “Tough making 1m at 18, I can see why ya hated it,” mocking Hughes’ complaint.Hughes described the sudden transition from high school to facing NHL stars nightly as overwhelming.Hughes signed a $11.325 million rookie deal, while Marchand’s first contract was worth only $2.55 million.Also Read: NHL Trade Talk: Connor McDavid’s Oilers shift focus to Blackhawks after failed goalie trade with Canucks","Brad Marchand responded to Jack Hughes' ""I hated it"" comment on Instagram.

Vladimir Orszagh’s journey from player to Olympic coach

Early, rather than mature, 2026 Olympic roster composition in balance with a mix of experience and youth



FAQs

1. Why did Vladimir Orszagh replace Craig Ramsay?

2. What NHL experience does Vladimir Orszagh have?

3. When will the rest of Slovakia’s Olympic roster be announced?

Through the year 2026, the Slovak path toward the Winter Olympics will form a new chapter in the book behind the coaching bench. Former NHL forward Vladimir Orszagh was appointed head coach after many years of international and professional experience. The decision follows his interim head coach role at the 2025 IIHF World Championship and is another signal from the Slovak hockey authorities toward planning. With NHL players returning for the Olympics, Slovakia now hopes to regain the bronze medal-winning form under his stewardship from 2022.In his first act as the full-time head coach, replacing an ailing Ramsay toward the end of the 2025 World Championship, Vladimir Orszagh now takes the helm for the upcoming Olympics. Slovakia ranked 11th out of 16 in that tournament-they were hardly at their best-but it gave Orszagh that great international experience. He knows the national setup well as the former assistant coach to Ramsay during the 2018 Olympics and several World Championship campaigns.Orszagh's coaching bio will tell you that he spent the 2022-23 season coaching in the top-tier league in Slovakia, Banská Bystrica, in his second season.As a player, he had a solid career, producing 119 points in 289 NHL contests from 1997 through 2006 with the New York Islanders, Nashville Predators, and St. Louis Blues. Orszagh competed internationally for Slovakia five times at the World Championships and also at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey.Slovakia has already named six Olympic roster players worthy of mention for having NHL years behind them as defense, while promising forwards are being named to the team. Erik Cernak, Martin Fehervary, and Simon Nemec will take care of the blue line, while the offensive line of Martin Pospisil, Juraj Slafkovsky, and veteran Tomas Tatar will soak up the glory. With a few more announcements to come later this year, this core group already shows that Slovakia wants to mix the old with the young on the big stage.The event to be held from February 11 to 22 will be the return of Slovakia to NHL-level Olympic-level competitions. The team will seek, under Orszagh, to follow in the footsteps of finishing 3rd at the event in 2022 or any better ranking.Also Read: Yegor Chinakhov’s trade request opens the door for the Colorado Avalanche opportunity Vladimir Orszagh’s promotion brought about a major turn for Slovakian ice hockey, melding experiences from different segments of both on-ice and coaching. With NHL players expected to come back into the Olympic arena in 2026, the preparations under the Orszaghs' leadership will be intensely scrutinized. The challenge lies in propelling forward a legacy left by Craig Ramsay while developing a respectable road to success for the national team.Ans- Orszagh started as an interim coach when Ramsay went into illness during the 2025 World Championship and was then reinstated to the full-time position.Ans- Orszagh represented the Islanders, Predators, and Blues in the NHL for nine seasons, putting up 119 points in 289 games.Ans- The complete roster is forwarded to be finalized and announced later in 2025.",Vladimir Orszagh was appointed head coach of Slovakia for the 2026 Winter Olympics.

Carmelo Anthony puts respect on Michael Beasley’s name



Michael Beasley finds his rhythm outside the NBA spotlight



FAQs



Did Michael Beasley play in the NBA?



What did Carmelo Anthony say about Michael Beasley?



Is a one-on-one game between Michael Beasley and Carmelo Anthony happening?



Once a top NBA prospect and now a BIG3 headliner, Michael Beasley ’s basketball journey has rarely followed the expected script. Despite being drafted No. 2 overall in 2008, Beasley’s career was often seen as a story of missed opportunities. But today, that narrative is shifting, thanks in part to NBA legend Carmelo Anthony’s honest words about Beasley’s real talent, words that are finally putting a long-overdue spotlight on his misunderstood greatness.While the NBA world often focused on what Beasley didn’t become, Carmelo Anthony is choosing to focus on what he is: one of the most naturally gifted players of his generation. During an episode of 7PM in Brooklyn, Anthony opened up about Beasley’s rise in the one-on-one basketball scene and the respect he’s earning.“He really wanna play. He love to play and he love the game,” Anthony said. “And I think now, you start to see him get that attention and the respect that he deserves.”Beasley recently made headlines for his one-on-one win over former teammate Lance Stephenson, dominating the pay-per-view showdown 31–21. That performance not only showed Beasley’s enduring skill but also gave fans a glimpse of what might’ve been if things had gone differently during his NBA career.Carmelo went a step further, praising Beasley’s sheer ability and expressing real confidence in him.“I think now having the opportunity, get back out there on the court, showcase to a newer generation a newer game when it come to 1v1, he is that guy,” Anthony added. “I would put my own money up on Beas against people … Beas is one of the most talented players to ever play our game.”Beasley may not have lived up to the franchise star expectations in the NBA, but his raw talent was never the issue. Standing 6’9” and weighing 236 lbs, he was capable of scoring from anywhere on the floor. However, a lack of consistent structure, guidance, and coaching early in his career kept him from unlocking his full potential.S till, his lasting impact can’t be ignored. Eleven seasons in the league is no small feat, and his resurgence in the BIG3 and the one-on-one circuit proves that Beasley’s love for the game hasn’t faded.The back-and-forth with Carmelo added fuel to a growing rivalry that fans now want to see played out. “If y’all really wanna jump on my f--king line with that s--t, we can really do it. We can really do it,” Beasley fired back on the 3s and Ones podcast last month. “No cop outs. Throw the f--king money up.”Also Read: Luka Doncic expected to sign long-term extension to stay with Los Angeles Lakers through prime years If this matchup ever happens, it won’t just be about pride—it’ll be about legacy, and the chance for Michael Beasley to show the world what many NBA players have always known: the man can flat-out hoop.Yes, Michael Beasley played 11 seasons in the NBA, showcasing elite scoring talent but falling short of initial expectations.Carmelo Anthony praised Beasley as “one of the most talented players to ever play our game” and said he’d bet money on him in one-on-one matchups.While no date is confirmed, both have publicly expressed interest, with Beasley challenging Anthony and fans eager for it to happen.","Carmelo Anthony praised Michael Beasley as “one of the most talented players to ever play our game” and said he’d bet money on him in one-on-one matchups.

How many times was Kyrie Irving an NBA All-Star?

Kyrie Irving revealed a major fact from his days of suspension. The player was suspended by the Brooklyn Nets for not taking the COVID-19 vaccine. Irving believed that it was his personal choice. He was free to do whatever he felt was right. The Nets, on the other hand, prohibited players without a vaccine from entering the home arena. Irving revealed that he had requested the Nets to let him go instead of just suspending him from the games.In a recent appearance, Kyrie Irving opened up on his suspension. It was during his Brooklyn Nets days. Even though Irving was cleared for the away games, the player was not allowed to play the home games. Irving, on the other hand, was quite firm on his decision not to get vaccinated.A clip went viral that showcases a major fact from that incident. Kyrie Irving revealed the request that he had made to the Nets during his suspension. In the video, Irving stated, “Even the people I was in business with were pro-vaccine. I was like, ‘Okay, that’s fine, but leave me the fuck out of this and let me go somewhere.’”He further continued, “I even told the nets to release me.I said, ‘Yo, can you just please release me?’ I could obviously see the money situation. Different situation. I am f*cking Kyrie. I say that while being very aware of my position. They weren’t just gonna let me rock out. Just go anywhere.”Kyrie Irving was an asset for the Brooklyn Nets alongside Kevin Durant and James Harden. However, Irving had his own set of beliefs and hence refused to take the COVID shots. Owing to his decision, the player was banned from the home games. However, Irving was still allowed to play the away games. The General Manager of the Nets Sean Marks had issued a comment on it then. He stated, “He has a choice to make and he made his choice. And my job here is to make what we deem is the best choices for the organization moving ahead and as a whole. They’re not always ones that are going to be met with open arms and a thumbs up. These are hard decisions.”He further continued, “And just like I’m sure it wasn’t easy for Kyrie, either, to have to not be around his teammates.”Irving’s rigid decision was criticized by fellow NBA mates like Raja Bell and Karl-Anthony Towns.Kyrie Irving signed with the Dallas Mavericks in 2023Kyrie Irving plays as the point guard for the Dallas MavericksKyrie Irving became the NBA All-Star 9 timesAlso Read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors Predicted to Land $48 Million ex-Boston Celtics Star in Bold 3-Team Trade Proposal",Kyrie Irving revealed a major fact from his days of suspension.

Poll Do you agree with Ben Stokes' view on different over-rate norms for subcontinental conditions? Yes, it's necessary No, rules should be uniform





England team brings in All Blacks psychologist



England captain Ben Stokes has refused to sign the over-rate form provided by the ICC match referee. Signing it will be an admission of guilt that his team didn’t abide by the necessary stipulations, but Stokes is of the view that there should be different over-rate norms for subcontinental conditions and SENA countries, where seam bowlers are in action most of the time.England were docked two World Test Championship (WTC) points after the end of the last Test last week.“Over-rate isn’t something that I worry about, but that’s not saying that I purposely slow things down. I do understand the frustration around it, but I honestly think there needs to be a real hard look at how it’s structured.“You can’t have the same rules in Asia — where a spinner is bowling 70% of the overs — as in New Zealand, Australia, England, where it’s going to be 70-80% seam,” he said on Tuesday.“Throughout the course of a game, the time of overs is going to come down because you’ve just got tired bodies. That was our 15th day of cricket. We obviously had an injury to our spinner Shoaib Bashir. We couldn’t turn to our spinner as much as we would have liked to on Day Five. The scoring rates are high. That means there are more balls hit to the boundaries. It takes time to fetch the balls and get started again.”The England team has hired the services of Enoka Gilbert, a former mental skills coach with the New Zealand rugby and cricket teams.“Me and Baz (McCullum) spoke a lot about what we want to do and how we want to take the team forward.“We can say as much as we want, but we don’t have the knowledge or the experience in pushing teams on to the next level. He (Gilbert) been able to put into words what we want to do a lot better than what me and Baz would ever be able to do,” Stokes said.",England captain Ben Stokes has refused to sign the over-rate form provided by the ICC match referee.

Poll Do you agree with Shubman Gill's accusation about England's time-wasting tactics? Yes, it goes against the spirit of the game No, it's a common strategy in cricket I'm not sure I don't follow cricket closely

Captain Shubman Gill on Tuesday accused the England team of not adhering to the spirit of the game when openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett came out to bat late on the fourth evening. “A lot of people have been talking about it. Let me just clear the air once and for all. The English batsmen on that day, they had seven minutes of play left. They were 90 seconds late to come to the crease. Not 10, not 20, 90 seconds late,” Gill said.“Most of the teams use such delaying tactics. Even if we were in that position, we would also have liked to play lesser overs, but there’s a way to do it. We felt if you get hit on your body, the physios are allowed to come in. That is fair. But to be able to come 90 seconds late to the crease is not something that I would think comes in the spirit of the game,” Gill said. Things started to get ugly when Gill used cuss words after Crawley kept pulling away in the middle of Jasprit Bumrah ’s run-up. The entire Indian team went hard at the openers.Gill, however, conceded he was not exactly proud of the way things transpired. He claimed that emotions got the better of him because the England batters were wasting time. “Leading up to that event, a lot of things happened that we thought should not have happened. I wouldn’t say it is something that I’m very proud of, but there was a build up to that. It didn’t just come out of nowhere.We had no intention of doing that whatsoever,” Gill offered as way of explanation.“You’re playing a game. You’re playing to win and there are a lot of emotions involved. There are things happening that should not happen. But sometimes the emotions come out of nowhere,” he added.The English camp has claimed that their aggression on the field on the final day was just a reciprocation of India’s outburst against their openers. “Obviously, it started off that night when Zak and Ben had to go out. We had the advantage of bowling last in the Test match to win. We just threw everything that we possibly could at India, not only with our skills, but also with our energy in the field as well,” England captain Ben Stokes said while addressing the media before Gill on Tuesday.“I guess it was a really nice moment as a team when you speak about something like that and everyone buys into that,” he added.Stokes has maintained that his team won’t go out to pick a fight with the opposition in the remainder of the series.“We’re (not) going to purposely go out and look to start (riling up the opponent) because then that will take our focus off what we actually need to do out in the middle. But by no means are we going to take a backward step and let any opposition try to be confrontational towards us. That goes for most teams. But the series has been great to play. It has been great to watch,” Stokes said.It will be interesting to see how England respond after Shubman Gill’s accusation.","England batsmen were 90 seconds late to come to the crease, says India captain Shubman Gill.
