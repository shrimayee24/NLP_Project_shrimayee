Connor McDavid stays composed amid speculation

As the Edmonton Oilers prepare for the 2025-26 NHL season, all eyes are on their captain, Connor McDavid, who is entering the final year of his eight-year, $100 million contract. Despite his incredible impact on the franchise, McDavid’s future in Edmonton remains uncertain and according to NHL insider Darren Dreger, that uncertainty is starting to make the organization nervous.During a recent segment, Dreger revealed that Oilers owner Daryl Katz is becoming “a little antsy” as Connor McDavid continues to deliberate on his next move. While Darren Dreger clarified that there’s “no animosity” between McDavid and the front office, he admitted there’s growing unease within the organization about the lack of progress..“There's no animosity here,” Dreger explained. “Is there nervousness building? Sure, you know, I mean, Daryl Katz is probably getting a little antsy, the owner of the Edmonton Oilers. And then that message would be delivered to Jeff Jackson and on to Stan Bowman, the general manager.”Dreger noted that Edmonton is “ready to close whenever Connor is ready,” but the timeline remains entirely in Connor McDavid’s hands. He estimated the chances of an extension happening soon at “50-50” and suggested that any potential deal could be short-term, possibly just two years, a prospect that could unsettle both management and fans.While some worry about the distractions, NHL analyst Eddie Olczyk believes McDavid won’t let the situation affect his performance. “Well, I don't think it's going to hang over Connor McDavid because, just, he breathes different air,” Olczyk said. “I don't think it's going to affect him one bit.”Also Read: Edmonton Oilers reportedly exploring shocking reunion with 40-year-old Marc-Andre Fleury Since his debut in 2015, McDavid has consistently proven to be a generational player, leading Edmonton to consecutive Stanley Cup Final appearances and surpassing the 100-point mark eight times.

Ravens struggle to find rhythm without Lamar Jackson under center

When could Lamar Jackson return to action?

The Baltimore Ravens are facing growing concern over the health of their franchise quarterback, Lamar Jackson, who has now missed his fourth straight practice. Jackson has been sidelined since Week 4 with a hamstring injury, raising serious questions about when he’ll return—and whether the Ravens can stay afloat without him.Lamar Jackson suffered the injury during the third quarter of Baltimore’s Week 3 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, and his absence has been glaring ever since. Without their two-time MVP, the Ravens’ offense has sputtered, averaging fewer than 14 points per game and lacking the explosiveness that once made them one of the AFC’s most feared units.In Sunday’s 44–10 loss to the Houston Texans, backup quarterback Cooper Rush stepped in but couldn’t generate momentum. Rush completed 14 of 20 passes for just 179 yards and three interceptions, finishing with a 58.1 passer rating. The Ravens’ offense managed only 207 total yards and converted a mere three third downs, a performance that exposed how dependent the team is on Jackson’s dual-threat magic.Coach John Harbaugh remained cautious about setting a timeline for his star’s return, saying Monday, “We’re in the process of figuring that out right now.Through the week we’ll know, we just have to see how they progress.”Initial reports indicated that Jackson would miss two to three weeks, hinting at a possible comeback after Baltimore’s bye in Week 7. Still, there’s a glimmer of hope for an earlier return. Fox Sports insider Jay Glazer revealed that there’s an “outside shot” Jackson could suit up for Week 6 against the Los Angeles Rams.Also Read: ""I'm not going to..."": Saquon Barkley breaks silence on crucial meeting with Jalen Hurts and A.J.

With every missed practice, the pressure intensifies, not just for Jackson to heal, but for the Ravens to rediscover the spark that made them early Super Bowl contenders.","Lamar Jackson has been sidelined since Week 4 with a hamstring injury.

Stephen Curry, the NBA legend, and his wife, Ayesha Curry, have been getting brutally criticised ever since she made a few controversial remarks about how she wanted different things in her life. Amid all the mess, a resurfaced video of Ayesha Curry making a controversial gesture while spotting a shirtless man has sparked outrage among fans.A couple of years ago, Stephen Curry’s wife, Ayesha Curry, appeared on The Real Daytime, where she was spotted sitting with the hosts.At one point, a shirtless waiter walks in on the set and Ayesha Curry makes a gesture of trying to take off her wedding ring as soon as he spots him.While this was a humorous and playful gesture, the video has sparked outrage among fans as many feel their marriage is “on the rocks”.A fan by the username @misfit8089421 wrote, “She’s literally the worst, Steph is a goofy for marrying this disrespectful & pathetic, she’s so jealous of him & desperate for attention it’s cringy.

Jordon Hudson’s high-profile encounter sparks fresh questions about UNC ’s leadership

Legal turmoil, communication bans, and questions of control at UNC

The University of North Carolina’s football season continues to unravel and not just because of its performance on the field. During Saturday’s 38–10 loss to the Clemson Tigers, head coach Bill Belichick and his program faced renewed scrutiny after his 24-year-old girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, was spotted in a visible sideline conversation with ACC Commissioner Jim Phillips before kickoff.The brief but animated exchange between Hudson and Phillips at Kenan Memorial Stadium quickly went viral, igniting social media debates about her increasing visibility within the Tar Heels program. Critics say the optics were disastrous for an already struggling team that has now dropped to 2–3 on the season, each defeat by a margin of at least 25 points.Hudson, who first drew headlines for giving Belichick an impromptu “pep talk” earlier this season, has become a lightning rod for controversy. Many fans believe her presence has blurred professional boundaries around the team, especially with her growing involvement in Belichick’s public appearances. The fact that the ACC commissioner paused for a private conversation only fueled speculation about her influence.While the content of their discussion remains unknown, the scene reinforced perceptions that off-field distractions are undermining Belichick’s first year in Chapel Hill.As one insider put it, the optics “couldn’t have come at a worse time” for a program already facing public and internal unrest.Beyond the sideline spectacle, UNC faces deeper structural issues. A pending lawsuit filed in September accuses the university of improperly hiring Belichick and concealing internal discussions tied to potential conference realignment, further shaking confidence in his leadership.Former Patriots linebacker Ted Johnson didn’t mince words: “To me, those are bad decisions that make him and the university look really bad. And question whether or not he is of sound mind and should be running a football team at the University of North Carolina.”Adding to the turmoil, reports from 247Sports claim Belichick instructed his staff not to reference the New England Patriots online after their recent 23–20 win a move that angered Tar Heels fans who saw it as petty and insecure.Also Read: How much did Jonathan Gannon have to pay after the Cardinals’ shocking sideline punishment?

Jason Kelce shuts down critics over Travis Kelce touchdown legality

Travis Kelce praises Jacksonville Jaguars for finishing strong

Jason Kelce’s remarks struck hard, reminiscent of a sudden tackle. The ex-lineman utilized his ""New Heights"" platform to blast critics who questioned Travis Kelce ’s touchdown against the Jaguars. His defense was fervent, spirited, and right out of the locker room playbook. However, under the playful banter, there was an unmistakable tension from a Chiefs team that knows it missed an opportunity, along with brothers who are weary of the noise.On the October 8, 2025 episode of the ""New Heights"" podcast, which is hosted by brothers Jason and Travis Kelce, retired Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce addressed online critics who were questioning whether his brother's touchdown was legal.In the episode, Jason talked to Travis and waved away the complaints by detailing the NFL 's rule about contact near the line of scrimmage. ""A lot of people talking about the contact or whatever. They don’t know the rule, within a yard, yada yada yada,"" Jason said.He pointed out that the incidental contact was allowed according to the rules, blaming the outrage on viewers not fully grasping the situation. Jason also mentioned that the game was pretty ""sloppy on both sides"" but pointed out that it was""particularly uncharacteristically sloppy for the Chiefs,"" based on AOL's overview of the episode.This defense arose during larger conversations on the podcast about the Chiefs' struggles with performance.After the loss, Travis Kelce, the Chiefs' tight end, was really frustrated. In his post-game remarks on the Chiefs' official website, he mentioned how the team failed to keep their early lead. He also talked more about it on the ""New Heights"" podcast with Jason, saying, ""14-point lead, and on top of that, 14 f**king penalties,"" Identifying the penalties as a key reason for the loss. He called the defeat ""super frustrating"" even though the Chiefs had 157 more yards than the Jaguars.Travis praised the Jaguars for their determination, mentioning to Jason, ""Hats off to the Jags, they finished the game and we didn't, and they played a cleaner game than we did."" He added, ""We go up 14 points, we can't let them get back into it,"" and stressed the need for improvement: ""We've gotta be better, man."".Travis pointed out the involvement of Jaguars rookie wide receiver/defensive back Travis Hunter, suggesting in a clip shared on X by user JaKi that enhancing Hunter's deep routes helped Jacksonville succeed.Jason Kelce’s passionate defense shows one thing: the Kelces aren’t shy about calling out the oblivious. Rules are more important than anger, and anyone who thinks differently just isn’t really paying attention.Also Read: “His music transcends language” — Jennifer Lopez fires back at critics slamming Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show","Jason Kelce addressed critics who were questioning whether his brother's touchdown was legal.

Shedeur Sanders on Joe Flacco: mentor, teammate, and friend



What’s next for Sanders and Flacco



Shortly after Cleveland Browns benched veteran quarterback Joe Flacco for rookie Dillon Gabriel, the team moved quickly, trading the 40-year-old quarterback to the Cincinnati Bengals on Tuesday. Flacco started four games this season, but after a 1–3 start, the Browns opted to give their third-round pick a chance. The trade not only reshaped Cleveland’s quarterback room but also elevated fifth-round rookie Shedeur Sanders to the backup position.Shedeur Sanders, who had been listed as the third-string quarterback, will now serve as Dillon Gabriel’s backup. The rookie spoke candidly about Flacco’s impact, telling John Sabol of Fox 8 News, “Dang, that happened quick.” Despite the sudden move, Sanders expressed admiration for Flacco’s guidance.“He’s definitely somebody I leaned on for wisdom, and I feel like he helped me a lot,” Sanders said. “He helped a lot while my time being here in Cleveland and his time being here in Cleveland. Everybody has their own destinies and has their own plans in life, so I’m just happy for him.”Even though Flacco never considered himself a formal mentor, his presence proved supportive.Sanders recalled Flacco offering encouragement after a challenging final preseason outing. “He’s definitely a person that adjusts to any situation he’s in,” Sanders added. “He’s an old man, so it’s funny though. … I always bring the youngness out of him, and he always smiles at the funny things I do.”The trade, though surprising, reinforced the bond between the veteran and the rookie. Sanders’ reaction shows the respect and friendship that grew during their time together, highlighting how mentorship in the NFL often comes from the locker room, not just the playbook.With Flacco heading to Cincinnati, he faces an immediate challenge: stepping in for the struggling Bengals offense, which has felt the absence of Joe Burrow. Flacco could replace Jake Browning as soon as this week, potentially rejuvenating a team that has struggled with passing efficiency.Meanwhile, Sanders will lean on the lessons he learned from Flacco as he embraces his new responsibilities with Cleveland. His positive outlook on Flacco’s future emphasizes maturity beyond his years. “Everybody has their own destinies and have their own plans in life. So, I’m just happy for him,” Sanders reiterated.As the NFL season continues, this trade illustrates more than a strategic move; it’s a moment of growth for a rookie and a fresh opportunity for a seasoned quarterback seeking a second wind.Also Read: Deshaun Watson flaunts luxury private jet date night with wife amid Browns quarterback drama",Cleveland Browns traded veteran quarterback Joe Flacco to the Cincinnati Bengals on Tuesday.

When Will Jayson Tatum’s Return to Play for the Celtics?

will not take the court tonight against the Memphis Grizzlies in the 2025 preseason matchup, as he continues to recover from a serious Achilles tendon injury. The latest update from October 8, 2025, confirms that Tatum remains sidelined while progressing through rehabilitation from the ruptured Achilles tendon he suffered during last season’s playoffs. Jayson Tatum ’s Achilles rupture was a major setback, with early expectations suggesting he might miss the entire 2025-26 NBA season. However, recent reports indicate that his recovery has been faster than anticipated. The Boston Celtics forward has described his rehab as “tedious” but also uplifting, revealing that he feels “great” and is confident about returning in peak condition. His commitment to recovery has drawn admiration from teammates and fans alike, with co-star Jaylen Brown calling his progress “superhuman. ”Despite the encouraging signs, the Celtics have opted for caution by keeping Jayson Tatum out of tonight’s preseason game against Memphis. The team is prioritizing his long-term health over an early return, ensuring that he regains full strength before returning to competitive action. For now, Boston will have to rely on its revamped roster to navigate the preseason without its franchise cornerstone.Tatum’s absence naturally puts more responsibility on Jaylen Brown and the rest of the Boston Celtics ’ supporting cast to set the tone for the season. The team underwent significant roster changes during the offseason, and the preseason is a crucial testing ground to evaluate chemistry and new rotations.Without Tatum, the Celtics will need to showcase depth and adaptability when they face the Grizzlies at FedExForum on Wednesday, October 8.The matchup itself is shaping up to be a lower-profile affair, with several stars from both sides unavailable due to injuries. While that limits the star power on display, it offers a valuable opportunity for younger players and new signings to prove their worth ahead of the regular season.Although Celtics fans won’t see Jayson Tatum in action tonight, optimism remains high about his potential return later in the 2025-26 campaign. The 27-year-old forward has made it clear that he intends to take his time, aiming to come back only when fully ready rather than risk aggravating the injury. Boston’s coaching and medical staff are fully supportive of this approach, focusing on long-term success rather than short-term gains.Tatum’s rapid progress has become a source of hope within the organization. His eventual comeback will be a massive boost to the Boston Celtics’ championship aspirations, especially given his leadership role and offensive prowess. Until then, the focus remains on maintaining competitive play and keeping momentum alive during his absence.Also read: Memphis Grizzlies vs Boston Celtics Preseason Game 1 Injury Report: Who's In, Who's Out, and More (October 8, 2025) In conclusion, Jayson Tatum has officially been ruled out of tonight’s preseason clash against the Memphis Grizzlies as he continues his recovery from an Achilles tendon rupture.

Joe Flacco named Cincinnati Bengals’ starting quarterback ahead of Week 6 clash against Packers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/joe-flacco-named-cincinnati-bengals-starting-quarterback-ahead-of-week-6-clash-against-packers/articleshow/124394650.cms,"Joe Flacco takes over as Bengals’ starting QB (Image via: Getty Images)

Bengals turn to Joe Flacco after Jake Browning struggles



Joe Flacco’s experience could spark Bengals’ offense



The Cincinnati Bengals are looking to keep their playoff hopes alive despite a rocky 2-3 start. With Joe Burrow sidelined for much of the season, head coach Zac Taylor has made a bold move — naming veteran quarterback Joe Flacco as the new starter ahead of Week 6 against the Green Bay Packers.The Bengals’ offense has struggled to find rhythm since Burrow’s injury, and Jake Browning’s inconsistent play in Weeks 3–5 only deepened concerns. In response, Cincinnati made a surprise trade with the Cleveland Browns, acquiring Super Bowl-winning quarterback Joe Flacco in exchange for late-round draft picks. Less than a week later, Taylor confirmed that Flacco will start under center in Week 6.The 40-year-old quarterback brings veteran leadership and playoff experience that the Bengals desperately need. Flacco has already faced the Packers this season, leading Cleveland to a 13-10 victory in Week 3, the only loss Green Bay has suffered so far. That familiarity could work in Cincinnati’s favor as they travel to Lambeau Field for a must-win matchup.During his press conference, Zac Taylor praised Flacco’s fit within the Bengals’ offensive system, stating, “His style fits our style.” The Bengals’ coach also confirmed that Flacco will take every snap on Sunday, signaling complete confidence in the veteran’s ability to command the offense.In four starts for Cleveland this season, Flacco threw for 815 yards with two touchdowns and six interceptions. While those numbers aren’t stellar, his poise and decision-making give Cincinnati a much-needed sense of stability. Compared to Browning’s 757 yards, six touchdowns, and eight interceptions in fewer games, Flacco’s track record suggests fewer costly mistakes and better ball control.The Bengals have no shortage of offensive weapons, including Ja’Marr Chase, Tee Higgins, and running back Chase Brown. With Flacco under center, the hope is that the veteran can distribute the ball effectively and reignite an offense that has struggled to find consistency.As the Bengals prepare for their Week 6 clash against the rested Packers, all eyes will be on Joe Flacco. His leadership, experience, and familiarity with Green Bay’s defense could be the difference-maker Cincinnati needs to stay competitive in the AFC North race.Also Read: Joe Flacco traded to Bengals: Top three players who could shine after QB addition",Cincinnati Bengals traded Joe Flacco to Cleveland Browns for late-round draft picks.

What to Expect from tonight's Memphis Grizzlies vs Boston Celtics Preseason Game

Thegame will the 2025-26 preseason opener for both teams, giving fans a first look at both teams’ revamped rosters in live action. The matchup is set for Wednesday, October 8, at the FedEx Forum in Memphis. While the Grizzlies head into their second preseason contest after falling to the Detroit Pistons, the Celtics will take the floor for the first time since last season’s playoff exit. Both sides enter the game with compelling storylines involving roster changes, health updates, and lineup experiments.The Memphis Grizzlies dropped their preseason opener to the Pistons, 128-112, struggling to contain Detroit’s offense. They’ll look to rebound in front of their home crowd but could once again be limited by injuries. Brandon Clarke and Zach Edey remain sidelined, while Ja Morant, Jaren Jackson Jr., and Javon Small are considered day-to-day. In their previous outing, Ty Jerome and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope impressed with 16 and 15 points respectively, showing potential to become key rotation pieces this season.For the Celtics, this marks their first preseason contest following last season’s second-round playoff elimination against the New York Knicks. The biggest question surrounds Jayson Tatum, who is dealing with Achilles and knee issues and will be a game-time decision. Boston’s offseason additions - Anfernee Simons , Chris Boucher, and Luka Garza - are expected to bolster an already strong core led by Jaylen Brown and Derrick White.The Celtics ended last season among the league’s top offensive teams, ranking second in offensive rating (120.6) and tenth in three-point percentage (36.8) over their final ten games.Prop markets for this matchup may include player totals for Ty Jerome, Caldwell-Pope, Jaylen Brown, Payton Pritchard, and Derrick White’s assists. With Boston’s emphasis on perimeter shooting, bettors should expect heavy action on three-point props and scoring overs for key guards.Early analytics and betting models slightly favor the Boston Celtics to come out on top, particularly if Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson Jr. remain limited. Boston’s superior depth, combined with Jaylen Brown’s leadership and the potential emergence of new contributors, gives them an edge even without Tatum on the floor.• Projected Celtics win probability: 52–58%, depending on final lineup announcements.• Community predictions lean toward Boston at -1.5 on the Asian Handicap line, citing consistent value across sportsbooks.• Anfernee Simons Points: Simons could see extended minutes if Tatum is ruled out, increasing his scoring upside.• Kentavious Caldwell-Pope Threes: With multiple Memphis injuries, KCP’s outside shooting could lead to solid value on three-point overs.• Team Total Over/Under: The Celtics have historically leaned toward team total unders, but Memphis trends toward overs. If key players return, the Over 229.5 line has value.• Baylor Scheierman 15+ Points: Boston’s preseason rotation could give younger players like Scheierman a chance to showcase their scoring ability.• Spread: The Celtics hold a slight advantage at +1.5, though lines could tighten closer to game time.• Moneyline: With both sides nearly even, Boston’s odds are more appealing unless Memphis fields a fully healthy lineup.• Props: Focus on shooters and high-usage players, especially given injury-driven minutes for secondary scorers.Boston has performed well on the road against the spread, finishing last season with a 20-18 ATS record in away games. Memphis, meanwhile, has struggled against Boston early in contests - dropping six of their last eight first halves at home versus the Celtics - leading sharp bettors to target the Grizzlies’ first-quarter under (set at 29.5).The Celtics continue to emphasize volume three-point shooting, a trend expected to carry into the preseason. Jaylen Brown has highlighted the team’s focus on intensity and fast starts, while head coach Joe Mazzulla aims to experiment with smaller, quicker lineups built around spacing and pace.Fans can anticipate a high-tempo game featuring plenty of shooting. The Celtics will likely look to establish their new offensive flow, taking advantage of open perimeter looks, while the Grizzlies aim to push the pace with Jerome, Caldwell-Pope, and Santi Aldama providing energy and scoring versatility.Despite both teams missing key stars, the preseason atmosphere opens the door for under-the-radar performers and intriguing betting angles. Expect Boston’s depth and perimeter play to be the deciding factors, but preseason unpredictability means either team could seize momentum depending on rotations and shooting streaks.Memphis Grizzlies vs Boston Celtics Prediction: Celtics narrowly defeat the Grizzlies behind balanced scoring and defensive cohesion. Look for a total trending over 229 if both sides prioritize pace and experimentation.Also read: Memphis Grizzlies vs Boston Celtics Preseason Game 1 Injury Report: Who's In, Who's Out, and More (October 8, 2025) In essence, this preseason clash offers more than just a warm-up - it’s a glimpse into how both franchises plan to evolve in the 2025-26 season. Boston’s structured depth and shooting identity face off against Memphis’ fast-paced resilience, setting the tone for an entertaining early-season showcase.","Memphis Grizzlies vs Boston Celtics is the 2025-26 preseason opener for both teams.

As the NFL season hits October, Week 6 is packed with exciting games and unique scheduling highlights. This week includes a Sunday morning London matchup, two teams on bye, a rare Monday Night Football doubleheader, and several prime-time showdowns featuring some of the league’s top teams. After an unpredictable Week 5 where all undefeated teams lost, the landscape is wide open, making this week critical for teams pushing to separate themselves from the pack.The Green Bay Packers come into Week 6 as the biggest favorites, hosting the struggling Cincinnati Bengals with a 14.5-point spread. Bengals wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase continues to be a bright spot, especially after helping his team nearly erase a big deficit last week, but it’s still a tough road matchup against Green Bay. Other teams favored by about a touchdown include the Philadelphia Eagles (at the New York Giants), Denver Broncos (facing the Jets in London), and Los Angeles Rams (at the Baltimore Ravens). The Eagles are looking to bounce back against a Giants team dealing with another loss and still missing Saquon Barkley. The Broncos head overseas with their tough defense for Sunday morning, and the Rams will be tested by a physical Ravens team in Baltimore.The highest over/under total of the week is 50.5 points for the Bears vs. Commanders matchup, while the lowest is, unsurprisingly, in whichever game the Cleveland Browns are playing.Two 4-1 NFC teams meet when the San Francisco 49ers visit the 4-1 Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Buccaneers enter as 3-point favorites in this pivotal NFC showdown. Meanwhile, the Eagles should handle the Giants at home, but the Giants, still feeling the impact of Barkley’s absence and boosted by a recent upset win, won’t make it easy. The Detroit Lions, also 4-1, face a challenging primetime game at the Kansas City Chiefs, who hold a narrow 1.5-point advantage and are fighting to avoid a 2-2 start.The Indianapolis Colts continue their surprising 4-1 run as they host the Arizona Cardinals with a 5.5-point edge. The Colts have shown consistency on both offense and defense. Monday Night Football features a rare doubleheader, beginning with the Buffalo Bills at the Atlanta Falcons. The Falcons are coming off a bye week and are 4-point underdogs at home. Later, the Chicago Bears meet the Washington Commanders to close out the night.With last week’s upsets reshaping expectations, Week 6 is a must-watch as contenders and dark horses battle for control of their divisions and playoff positioning.

Andrew Luck ’s new role gets a major boost from a familiar name

Why this gift could reshape Stanford’s next coaching hire

Freeman’s deep ties to the university go beyond football

As Stanford football tries to bounce back from several tough seasons, a former player has stepped up in a big way. On Wednesday, the school announced a whopping $50 million donation from longtime supporter Bradford M. Freeman — a move that could help reshape the program’s future to a great degree. Freeman, who played for the Cardinal and graduated in 1964, is giving what Stanford says is the biggest individual gift in the program’s history not tied to buildings or facilities. Instead, the money will go directly toward football operations, including scholarships and NIL (name, image, and likeness) support for players. The timing is critical. Stanford is 2-3 this season under interim head coach Frank Reich and has finished 3-9 in each of the past four years. With a coaching search underway and a full rebuild on the line, the donation arrives at a rather key moment.The timing of the donation is especially meaningful for former NFL quarterback Andrew Luck, who took over as Stanford’s general manager in November 2024. One of Luck’s core responsibilities has been fundraising — and this marks the first major financial win of his tenure.“With Brad’s incredible gift, we are positioned to win on the field and build a bridge to a sustainable future for Stanford football,” Luck said in a statement. “The ability to support our players through new scholarships and institutional NIL will reinforce Stanford as the preeminent place in the country to be a football scholar-athlete.” Luck’s belief in the long-term potential of the program remains clear. “I believe that Stanford has the opportunity to be a leading program in college football, and we are entirely motivated to field championship-caliber teams.”Stanford has made it known that Reich will not return next season, and the search for a full-time head coach is ongoing. Freeman’s donation doesn’t just inject money into the program — it also sends a message to coaching candidates across the country: Stanford is serious about competing again. With new NIL support and scholarship flexibility, the next head coach will inherit more tools to build and retain a roster in today’s college football environment.This isn’t the first time Freeman has left his mark on the Cardinal. In 1988, he funded the nation’s first endowed head coach position — now formally known as the Bradford M. Freeman Director of Football. He’s also served as a Stanford trustee and contributed to multiple areas of the university over the years. Stanford will honor his latest donation by naming both a tunnel and a gate at Stanford Stadium after him. In a written statement, Freeman reflected on what Stanford has meant to him personally: “The trajectory of my life was impacted by my time at Stanford,” he said. “I hope this gift will herald a new era of excellence for Stanford football.”Whether Stanford can turn funding into wins remains to be seen. But this donation proves one thing: the right people still believe in what the program can be.","Bradford M.

Jalen Hurts is critical of the Philadelphia Eagles’ lack of cohesion

Jalen Hurts hopes to bounce back strong despite recent Eagles setbacks

The Philadelphia Eagles started strong this 2025 NFL season with a record 4-0 start. With Jalen Hurts leading the pack, the Eagles were destined for greater things. With the team’s reputation and its consistency well known, things were going in the right direction for the team. However, this past Sunday proved to be a shocker for the NFL giants as they dealt a devastating blow with their first defeat at the hands of the Denver Broncos in Week 5. Hurts has now spoken out regarding the loss and what went wrong with the team during the match.The Philadelphia Eagles’ shocking 21-17 loss to the Denver Broncos this past Sunday sent shockwaves as the team suffered its first loss of the season so far. Although they started pretty strong till the 4th quarter, some big inconsistencies and lack of teamwork were big faults that led to the Broncos slowly making their comeback through their quarterback Bo Nix.At the post-game press conference, Eagles’ quarterback Jalen Hurts addressed the defeat, even taking accountability for not living up to the team’s past laurels. Hurts’ frustration also seems to have aimed indirectly at his coach, Nick Sirianni, regarding the underwhelming team-building. He said, “It's like having all the same ingredients but a different chef in the kitchen. Somebody can make the same dish, and it tastes different.The famed NFL star was also critical of the flawed team dynamic and lack of cohesive execution in their latest game. The quarterback pointed out the “lack of execution and maybe lack of sense of urgency in how our operation is”. Hurts is clearly bummed about the big loss but is not afraid of pointing out the flaws within the team. Although the team’s standing is still strong, fans hope they never suffer a blow like this again.Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts recently explained what went wrong with the team's recent loss. However, he is certain that the superteam will come back strong and still believes in his team. This sentiment was echoed in his post-game remarks saying,“I know this is a hungry group,” he said. “I know we’re hungry and excited for all the opportunity in front of us to continue to improve.

Baker Mayfield’s Week 5 performance shows Tampa Bay QB turning critics into believers

Tampa Bay QB Baker Mayfield turns polarizing reputation into on-field dominance



Baker Mayfield is off to an explosive start this NFL season, silencing critics and winning over the very fans who once doubted him. Once labeled “immature” for his fiery personality, Mayfield’s unapologetic attitude is now being praised as grit and leadership — proof that perception in the NFL can change as fast as the scoreboard.Mayfield’s journey has been anything but easy. Drafted No. 1 overall by the Cleveland Browns, he entered the league as a confident, outspoken competitor. His early years, though filled with flashes of brilliance, were overshadowed by media criticism. His fiery demeanor and off-field visibility, including numerous commercials, led many to question his maturity rather than his skill.The narrative worsened when his Cleveland stint soured and his time with the Carolina Panthers fell short. It seemed the former Heisman winner might fade into NFL journeyman territory. But a brief resurgence with the Los Angeles Rams reminded everyone of his talent, and his hunger to prove himself wasn’t gone.Then came Tampa Bay. Stepping into the post-Tom Brady era was no small task, yet Mayfield embraced it. His Week 5 performance against the Seattle Seahawks — completing 29 of 33 passes in a thrilling win — marked one of the best outings of his career.And ironically, the same fiery attitude that once drew backlash is now fueling admiration.When Baker Mayfield recently got into a heated spat with Seahawks fans during a tense moment on the field, he took the encounter in stride and reflected on it with his trademark humor. He pointed out that earlier in his career, such behavior would have instantly made headlines as a sign of immaturity and recklessness.Today, however, that same fiery competitiveness is being recognized as a clear competitive edge — fans have started calling him “a dog,” a term of respect that highlights his relentlessness and leadership on the field. Even Mayfield himself seemed unbothered by the attention, brushing off the incident with his now-famous line: “Same shit, different day.”It shows how much he’s grown as a quarterback. Instead of reacting to every critique, he lets his play do the talking, staying focused on leading Tampa Bay and making big plays when it matters most.Also Read: Joe Flacco named Cincinnati Bengals’ starting quarterback ahead of Week 6 clash against Packers","Tampa Bay QB Baker Mayfield turns polarizing reputation into on-field dominance.

Early challenges for Rangers highlight need for system adjustments under Mike Sullivan

The New York Rangers opened their 2025-26 NHL season with a 3-0 defeat against the Pittsburgh Penguins, leaving fans concerned about the team’s early form. New head coach Mike Sullivan, making his Rangers debut after a decade-long stint with the Penguins, emphasized that one loss does not define the season and vowed to stay focused on long-term growth.Mike Sullivan, appointed head coach earlier this summer to replace Peter Laviolette, brought with him a proven championship pedigree, having led the Pittsburgh Penguins to two Stanley Cup victories over ten seasons. Despite his decorated resume, Sullivan acknowledged that the Rangers have significant improvements to make following their first game.“I think my first observation is we got a long way to go to become the team we want to become. I'm not going to overreact to it. It's one game. We've got a lot of hockey to play. So is it disappointing? Yeah. We're going to see what we can take from it. We're going to move on,” Sullivan said after the match.The New York Rangers kicked off their 2025-26 NHL season with a disappointing 3-0 loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins, raising early questions about their form under new head coach Mike Sullivan. Despite the setback, Sullivan emphasized resilience and a long-term approach, insisting the team will learn from the defeat and move forward.The 3-0 scoreline included two empty-net goals by the Penguins in the final minutes, but the Rangers struggled to control play and generate consistent scoring chances throughout. Analysts noted that integrating a new coaching system often takes time, and early-season results may not reflect the roster’s true potential.Sullivan’s immediate focus will likely be on tightening defensive structures, improving offensive chemistry, and building confidence in his squad. Fans can expect incremental adjustments over the next few games as the Rangers adapt to his system.While the season opener was disappointing, Sullivan’s calm and measured response signals a long-term approach.

The team is struggling in close games, a stark contrast to previous years.

Chiefs’ late-game failures and offensive inconsistency raise red flags

Week 6 against Detroit could define Kansas City’s season



The Kansas City Chiefs’ 2025 campaign has gone from concerning to alarming. After their Week 5 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, the reigning AFC champions now sit at 2-3, an unfamiliar position for a team that’s spent years dominating the league under Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid. What’s worse, the numbers behind their slump paint a picture of a team struggling to close games and losing its championship edge.According to B/R Gridiron, the Chiefs are 0-3 against teams with winning records this season, a shocking contrast to the dominance fans have come to expect. ESPN’s Bill Barnwell added another worrying stat: “Chiefs in games decided by seven points or less, 2024: 10-0. 2025: 0-3.” Last year, Kansas City was unbeatable in tight situations; this year, they’ve fallen apart when the pressure mounts.Patrick Mahomes didn’t shy away from acknowledging the team’s self-inflicted mistakes after Sunday’s defeat. “We’ve kind of done that to ourselves all year long... In this league, it’s so close that those [plays] change games,” he said. The Chiefs’ offense, usually one of the league’s most efficient, has been hindered by key absences, most notably wide receiver Rashee Rice, who has yet to play this season due to injury.NFL insider Albert Breer struck a hopeful tone on X, writing, “What I saw last night was an offense that’s getting better and still hasn’t played a single snap with its best (by a good margin) skill-position player.”With Rice expected to return in Week 7, Kansas City could finally find the spark it’s been missing.The Chiefs now face a critical Week 6 matchup against the 4-1 Detroit Lions, a team known for its balance and grit. The Lions’ explosive offense will test Kansas City’s inconsistent defense, while Mahomes will once again be tasked with carrying an offense that’s still finding its rhythm.Despite the turbulence, Mahomes remains optimistic: “We’ve lost too many games already.

Is this the end for Bill Belichick? UNC reportedly exploring exit after rough start and rules violations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/is-this-the-end-for-bill-belichick-unc-reportedly-exploring-exit-after-rough-start-and-rules-violations/articleshow/124399400.cms,"Jared C.

Why UNC is reportedly considering an exit strategy

Bill Belichick’s contract and financial implications

Bill Belichick’s legendary coaching career may be facing an unexpected challenge and it’s happening at the college level. Just five games into his debut season at North Carolina, reports indicate the program has begun discussing a potential “exit strategy” for the NFL icon. The Tar Heels are 2-3 so far, and off-field controversies, including recent NCAA rules violations, are reportedly fueling the situation. For a coach known for precision and control in the NFL, this is a high-profile college nightmare in the making.Fans and analysts are shocked, the man who built dynasty after dynasty in New England might already be in hot water at UNC.The Tar Heels’ on-field struggles are part of the problem. Losses to TCU, UCF, and Clemson have left the program below expectations just a few weeks into the season. Early reports suggest the team is struggling to adjust to Belichick’s system, and performance issues on both sides of the ball are raising concerns. For a school investing $50 million in a coaching legend, the results so far have fallen short of what many expected.The situation became even more complicated after assistant coach Armond Hawkins was suspended for violating NCAA rules by providing sideline passes to a player’s family.While minor compared to some college infractions, this incident reflects broader compliance concerns and has reportedly contributed to UNC’s internal “exit strategy” discussions. The combination of on-field struggles and off-field controversies has created an unusually tense environment for Belichick so early in his tenure.Belichick’s $50 million contract makes any decision about his future particularly tricky. An early termination could cost the university a significant payout, though reports indicate UNC is exploring ways to minimize financial obligations if they do decide to part ways. This is standard practice for high-profile coaches, but it also adds a layer of complexity to any potential exit.Belichick shocked the football world by leaving the NFL to take over at UNC, bringing decades of championship experience to the college ranks. Expectations were sky-high: fans anticipated immediate improvements and a strong program rebuild. That the program is already exploring an exit strategy underscores how unusual and high-stakes this situation has become.UNC’s options could include negotiating an early buyout, reassigning staff, or waiting until the end of the season to make a decision. With the combination of poor results and off-field controversies, the program faces pressure to act swiftly. Players, fans, and media are all watching closely, making this one of the most talked-about coaching situations in college football right now.Also read - Shocking conspiracy in the Jets’ front office: Fired exec accused of orchestrating false harassment claims","North Carolina is reportedly considering an exit strategy for coach Bill Belichick.

Edmonton Oilers' core building continues

Oilers' Brett Kulak Reflects On Journey To NHL Growing Up In Stoney Plain, Alberta

In making major player signings, the Edmonton Oilers have not only restructured their roster but also caught the whole league's attention. The rumors about the possible trades of Connor McDavid and Jake Walman have now been joined by the speculations on the future of the veteran defender Brett Kulak. The trending topics, such as the Brett Kulak extension and the Edmonton Oilers contract talks, are now across the NHL news outlets, indicating that there is a strong interest in figuring out whether the 31-year-old will still be part of the Oilers’ blue line for years to come.As per TSN insider Ryan Rishaug, ""Sounds like there have been some extension discussions with Kulak camp, but nothing imminent. It will be interesting to see which way he goes with it.” Kulak, who is in the last year of his four-year contract worth $11 million, set a new personal record for goals (seven) and assists (18) during the regular season 2024-25, playing over 82 games.In addition, he scored one goal and made four assists in the playoffs, demonstrating his ability to perform well when the stakes are highest. Although he was always a third-pairing defenseman, Kulak proved to be a reliable and sturdy defensive player in Edmonton while occasionally contributing offensively.This probable extension is a result of the major changes in Oil Country over the past week. The group secured Connor McDavid with a two-year, $25 million extension, followed by Jake Walman on a seven-year, $49 million contract and Mattias Ekholm on a three-year, $12 million deal. With Leon Draisaitl, Zach Hyman, and Darnell Nurse among the 10 players who are signed up until at least 2027-28, it’s very clear that Edmonton is planning to keep a great core to fight for its first Stanley Cup in decades.Brett Kulak’s possible extension is not yet a done deal, but it might fortify the Oilers’ defense for many years to come. Edmonton has been securing the core of its team, and thus, every move this summer signifies a franchise that is determined to be in the top tier of contenders.Also Read: Alex Pietrangelo injury: Vegas Golden Knights star ruled out for 2025–26 NHL season amid retirement speculation","TSN insider Ryan Rishaug reveals latest on Brett Kulak’s future with Edmonton Oilers.

Theare set to host thein their first preseason game of the 2025-26 NBA season on October 8, 2025, at Chase Center in San Francisco. Both teams enter this matchup with key injury concerns that could significantly influence their rotations and early-season strategies.The Golden State Warriors begin the preseason in relatively good health compared to many other teams, but will still be without a few important names. De’Anthony Melton continues to recover from a knee injury and will not be available for the opener. Rookie forward Alex Toohey is also sidelined as he works his way back from an undisclosed injury. Seth Curry, who recently joined the team and happens to be Stephen Curry’s younger brother, is expected to see little to no action during the preseason. Reports suggest that Seth might be released after the exhibition slate concludes.The Golden State Warriors are taking a cautious approach with their veteran players, prioritizing rest and recovery ahead of the regular season. The coaching staff is expected to rotate minutes strategically, giving younger players more opportunities to gain experience while key contributors stay fresh for when the games start to matter.The Portland Trail Blazers ’ situation, however, looks much more concerning. The Trail Blazers will be without several of their most important players heading into this contest. Franchise star Damian Lillard remains out for the entirety of the 2025-26 season after suffering a torn Achilles. Rising guard Scoot Henderson is also unavailable due to a torn hamstring sustained a few weeks earlier. He is expected to return closer to the start of the regular season, depending on his recovery timeline.Adding to the challenges, center Robert Williams III has not yet been cleared for contact and remains questionable moving forward. These absences leave the Portland Trail Blazers with a depleted core, forcing the team to rely on its bench and younger prospects to step up during the preseason.The Golden State Warriors are expected to showcase a backcourt rotation featuring Jrue Holiday and Shaedon Sharpe, supported by promising frontcourt players such as Donovan Clingan and Toumani Camara. On the other hand, Portland’s lineup adjustments are expected to include players like Moses Moody, Stephen Curry (not to be confused with Golden State’s superstar), and veterans Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green taking on expanded forward roles due to the injury situation.The contrast between the two sides could make this matchup an interesting test of depth and adaptability. While the Warriors aim to fine-tune their rotations and build team chemistry, the Portland Trail Blazers will focus on evaluating young talent and finding lineup combinations that work amid adversity.Despite being a preseason contest, this game has generated strong fan interest. Many are curious to see how Portland copes without its star players and whether any new faces emerge as reliable contributors. Meanwhile, the Golden State Warriors’ faithful will be eager to see how their largely healthy roster looks in early action, especially as the team integrates new additions and adjusts its defensive schemes.Preseason games like this one often offer glimpses of developing players, tactical experimentation, and early signs of how injuries might influence a team’s season. For Golden State, it’s about preparation and pacing. For Portland, it’s about resilience and depth.The upcoming Warriors vs. Trail Blazers preseason opener sets up a clear contrast: a Golden State team managing its health with strategic rest versus a Portland squad battling through key absences. With stars like Damian Lillard and Scoot Henderson out, the Portland Trail Blazers face an uphill challenge, while the Golden State Warriors look to use this game as a platform to test rotations and maintain their momentum heading into the regular season.Also read: Golden State Warriors vs Portland Trail Blazers Preseason Game 1 Prediction, Odds, Spread, Moneyline, Best NBA Prop Bets, and Betting Breakdown This matchup may not affect standings, but it offers valuable insight into how both franchises are positioning themselves for the long campaign ahead.","The Golden State Warriors host the Portland Trail Blazers in their first preseason game of the 2025-26 NBA season on October 8, 2025, at Chase Center in San Francisco.
