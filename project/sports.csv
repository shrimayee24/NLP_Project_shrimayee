The constituency has been a BJP stronghold in recent years, although contests have remained competitive, particularly with strong INC and JD(U) showings.In the 2020 assembly elections, BJP’s Ram Singh won with 90,013 votes (49.51%), defeating INC’s Jayesh Mangal Singh, who secured 59,993 votes (33.00%), by a margin of 30,020 votes.In 2015, BJP’s Raghaw Sharan Pandey had emerged victorious with 74,476 votes (44.45%), defeating JD(U)’s Bhishm Sahani, who polled 66,293 votes (39.56%), by 8,183 votes.Bagaha has thus consistently witnessed close contests between BJP and INC candidates, with Jan Suraaj emerging as a new entrant in the constituency this year.According to recent exit polls, the NDA is projected to secure a strong performance in Bihar, with People's Pulse suggesting the alliance may win around 133–159 seats, while the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan could secure 75–101 seats.Smaller parties like Jan Suraaj are expected to have minimal impact, though individual seats such as Bagaha may see tighter contests.With Bagaha’s electorate increasingly engaged, the results are likely to be closely watched, reflecting both local dynamics and the broader political trend across Bihar.

NEW DELHI: The stage is all set for Bihar assembly elections results 2025 that will be declared today. With a strong voter turnout and exit polls suggesting a possible return of the Nitish Kumar-led NDA government, all eyes are on the actual results.The counting will begin at 8 am, according to the Election Commission of India (ECI). As Bihar waits for the verdict, here's a look at the most talked-about fights.Sitting MLA: Tejashwi Yadav (RJD)A stronghold of the Lalu Prasad family, Raghopur remains one of Bihar’s most-watched seats. Tejashwi Yadav is eyeing a third straight win here. His main opponent, BJP’s Satish Kumar, lost in both 2015 and 2020, after holding the seat in 2010 as a JD(U) member.The seat made headlines this year when speculation swirled that Jan Suraaj’s Prashant Kishor might contest from here, but he didn’t.Sitting MLA: Chandra Shekhar (RJD)Known for its deep Yadav roots, Madhepura has never elected a non-Yadav MLA. Locals still quote the saying, “Rome Pope ka, Madhepura Gop ka”, meaning the head of Rome is the Pope, and the head of Madhepura is a Yadav.RJD’s Chandra Shekhar is seeking a fourth straight term, while JD(U)’s Kavita Saha hopes to rewrite history as the first woman and non-Yadav MLA from the seat.Sitting MLA: Mishri Lal Yadav (VIP)Singer Maithili Thakur’s political debut has made Alinagar one of the most talked-about constituencies this season. Her campaign, coloured by Maithili cultural symbolism and outsider debates, has drawn controversy. The seat, won by VIP in 2020, now sees Thakur take on VIP's ally and RJD’s Binod Mishra, who finished second in the last election.Sitting MLA: Dr C N Gupta (BJP)In Chhapra, Bhojpuri star Khesari Lal Yadav’s debut has turned the contest into a spectacle. The BJP has fielded Chhoti Kumari, hoping to retain the seat it has held since 2010. The campaign trail has looked more like a film set with stars from both camps joining rallies, from Tejashwi and Akhilesh Yadav to Ravi Kishan and Nirahua.Sitting MLA: Anant Singh (JDU)Mokama’s election season turned volatile after the killing of a Jan Suraaj supporter, Dularchand Yadav, allegedly by associates of JD(U)’s Anant Singh. Known as one of Bihar’s most notorious “bahubali” figures, Singh has switched parties multiple times, yet continues to win. Since 2010, he’s been MLA as a JD(U), RJD, and independent candidate, making him one of the most resilient faces in Bihar politics.Sitting MLA: Alok Ranjan (BJP)Traditionally a BJP seat, Saharsa swung to RJD in 2015 but could surprise again this time. The BJP’s Alok Ranjan faces a tough challenge from the Indian Inclusive Party’s Indrajeet Prasad Gupta, whose massive rallies, backed by the Pan and Tanti communities, pushed Tejashwi Yadav to bring IIP into the Mahagathbandhan fold.Sitting MLA: Awadh Bihari Choudhary (RJD)This is a heavyweight clash between the sitting MLA, RJD veteran Awadh Bihari Choudhary and BJP’s Mangal Pandey. In 2020, BJP’s Om Prakash Yadav came within a narrow 2% margin. Siwan’s legacy runs deep. It’s the birthplace of India’s first president, Dr Rajendra Prasad and the old base of strongman Mohammad Shahabuddin.Sitting MLA: Rajeev Kumar Singh (JDU)A symbolically charged seat this time, Nitish Kumar handed Tarapur to BJP leader Samrat Choudhary, ending JD(U)’s decade-long control. The seat is steeped in family history for Choudhary, whose parents both represented it earlier. RJD’s Arun Kumar Sah, who lost by a 2% margin last time, is hoping for a comeback.Sitting MLA: Chetan Anand (JDU)Chetan Anand, son of former MP Anand Mohan, won Sheohar last time but has since joined the NDA. This time, the JD(U) has fielded Shweta Gupta, while the RJD bets on Navneet Jha, grandson of veteran leader Raghunath Jha.Despite being allies under the INDIA banner, Congress and RJD are set to face each other head-on in several constituencies, exposing the uneasy truce within the opposition alliance. As a result, “friendly contests” are unfolding across the state. Congress and RJD will lock horns in Vaishali, Warisaliganj, Lalganj, and Kahalgaon, while Congress is also up against CPI(ML) in Bachhwara, Rajapakar, Rosera, and Biharsharif. These overlapping fights risk splitting the opposition vote in several key districts, a scenario that could benefit the NDA.","Bihar assembly elections results 2025 will be declared today.

Bihar Exit Polls 2025: Poll of Polls Show NDA Poised For Majority, MGB Trails, No Impact of JSP

Candidates Party Votes polled Vote percentage Maithili Thakur BJP Binod Mishra RJD Biplaw Chaudhary Jan Suraaj Margin of difference

NEW DELHI: Singer Maithili Thakur has taken an early lead, securing 7,637 votes and establishing a margin of 3,004 votes after the first round of counting. RJD candidate Binod Mishra is trailing behind with 4,633 votes as the counting continues.Dominating the early trends, Thakur is giving the BJP a strong lead in this closely watched contest. The party’s decision to field Thakur, banking on her wide popularity and cultural connect, appears to be paying off. If the trend continues, the BJP could secure this seat for the first time since 2008.Thakur faces a direct contest with RJD’s Binod Mishra, who finished runner-up in 2020, and Jan Suraj’s Biplaw Chaudhary.The seat, falling under Darbhanga district and part of the Darbhanga Lok Sabha constituency, is in the General category.Political observers say the Alinagar outcome will indicate how far the BJP’s outreach through youth icons and cultural identity politics resonates in the region. Thakur’s candidature marks a strategic shift, with the party hoping her appeal among young and first-time voters could swing the seat its way.In the 2020 Bihar Assembly elections, the Alinagar contest was among the closest in the state. Mishri Lal Yadav of the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) had edged out Binod Mishra (RJD) by just 3,101 votes, securing 61,082 votes to Mishra’s 57,981.Five years earlier, in 2015, RJD’s Abdul Bari Siddiqui had comfortably won the seat with 67,461 votes, defeating his nearest rival by over 13,000 votes.With Thakur entering the fray, this year’s race has taken on a new dimension. The BJP is seeking to expand its base in north Bihar beyond its traditional urban and upper-caste strongholds. The RJD, meanwhile, is counting on its organisational network and caste arithmetic to retain its edge.Counting for all 243 assembly constituencies begins at 8:00am, and early trends from Alinagar are expected to set the tone for the broader Darbhanga region.","Singer Maithili Thakur has taken an early lead, securing 7,637 votes and establishing a margin of 3,004 votes after the first round of counting.

Rampravesh Rai of the BJP dominated the seat for four consecutive terms — 2000, February 2005, October 2005, and 2010. The only break came in 2015, when Mohammad Nematullah of the RJD captured the seat. Nematullah, a veteran leader, had earlier won Barauli in 1995 as a Janata Dal candidate, before returning under the RJD banner two decades later.The BJP regained control in 2020, with Rampravesh Rai reclaiming the seat by a decisive margin.","Barauli went to polls in the second phase of the Bihar Assembly Elections 2025.

NEW DELHI: In early counting trends, BJP ’s Sanjiv Chaurasia has opened up a sharp lead, pulling in 9,226 votes, putting him 4,541 votes ahead of his nearest rival. Trailing him is CPI(ML) Liberation’s Divya Gautam , who stands at 4,685 votes, struggling to bridge the growing deficit. The margin, while still fluid at this stage, signals a strong early advantage for the BJP as counting continues.Candidates from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Liberation (CPI(ML)L), and the Jan Suraaj Party (JSP) are locked in a close three-way contest in Bihar’s Digha Assembly constituency, one of the largest and most politically significant seats in the state. As polling took place on November 11, 2025, in the second phase of the Bihar Assembly Elections, incumbent MLA Sanjeev Chaurasia (BJP) is facing a strong challenge from Divya Gautam (CPI(ML)L) and Ritesh Ranjan Singh alias Bittu Singh (JSP), making this a crucial battleground in Patna district.The Digha constituency witnessed a voter turnout of 74.85%, reflecting high civic engagement compared to its 2020 turnout of 60.12%. Bihar as a whole recorded a historic 66.91% turnout, marking the state’s highest in over two decades.Located in Patna district, Digha is one of six Assembly segments forming the Patna Sahib Lok Sabha seat. Created in 2008 after the delimitation exercise, Digha was designed for a more balanced voter distribution but has since grown into Bihar’s largest constituency by electorate size.In the 2020 Assembly polls, Sanjeev Chaurasia (BJP) retained the seat by a margin of 46,073 votes, defeating Shashi Yadav (CPI(ML)L) in a straight contest. He had earlier won the 2015 election as well, reinforcing the BJP’s urban dominance in the area.The constituency comprises six panchayats and 14 municipal wards, largely falling under the Patna Municipal Corporation, making it a politically vibrant mix of urban and semi-urban voters. The electorate has grown steadily, from 460,868 registered voters in 2020 to 473,108 in 2024, underlining its expanding political weight within Patna’s urban belt.Digha has consistently leaned toward BJP. With the Jan Suraaj Party also entering the fray this year, the 2025 contest has evolved into a three-cornered battle, potentially reshaping the region’s urban political dynamics. The BJP’s challenge will be to maintain its dominance amid growing anti-incumbency and voter fatigue.","In early counting trends, BJP’s Sanjiv Chaurasia has opened up a sharp lead, pulling in 9,226 votes.

Madison Beer may draw most of the spotlight as Justin Herbert 's girlfriend, and it makes sense. Her rising music career, her fashion profile and her massive fanbase always place her at the center of attention. Yet the scene at the Chargers' recent Sunday Night Football win over the Pittsburgh Steelers shifted the focus in a surprising way. The singer arrived with her mom, Tracie, and that moment created its own buzz. It was Tracie’s first football game, and her presence added a warm and unexpected layer to the night.The timing for their outing could not have been better. Beer is celebrating the excitement around her new single ""Bittersweet"" and gearing up for the release of her album ""Locket"" in January 2026. Herbert, meanwhile, continues his strong run as a 27-year-old Pro Bowler with a five-year, $262.5 million extension, including $218.7 million guaranteed. While the star quarterback carries pressure on the field, the support system around him and Madison seems steady.Beer has been a dedicated presence at Chargers games and their team Halloween events. Her matchy sailor costume with Herbert became one of the cute highlights of the season.But this time, her mom unintentionally stole the scene with a charming Instagram Reels selfie. Viewers quickly noticed how much she looks like Madison. Tracie already has 126k followers and describes herself with the line, ""Proud Mom of @madisonbeer & @ryderbeer. .. Inventor of the @halterhanger... Dog lover, who loves fashion, skincare & makeup! 💝""She wore a full Chargers outfit and later panned the camera toward Madison, who did a playful shimmy next to her. Their close bond shows up often. When Madison announced her album, her mom posted, ""😍😍amazing 😍😍 so proud of you 😍😍."" Tracie also attended the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, where Madison owned the pink carpet with her all-black look and performance. Tracie even shared her own outfit from the night.Her quiet support continues behind the scenes too. At the Blue Jacket Los Angeles fashion show, she avoided talking about Madison's relationship, making a lips-zipped gesture. But she did tell TMZ that Madison ""is happy."" That happiness seemed clear during their cheerful night at SoFi Stadium, months after dating rumors began when Herbert appeared at one of her music video shoots in Los Angeles.","Madison Beer's mom, Tracie, attended the Chargers' win over the Pittsburgh Steelers.

The election was necessitated after Abdullah vacated the Budgam seat following his victory from his family stronghold of Ganderbal in last year’s assembly polls.A traditional stronghold of the National Conference since 1962, Budgam has seen the party dominate in nearly every election, barring a lone Congress win in 1972. NC’s Srinagar MP Aga Ruhullah Mehdi had represented Budgam for three consecutive terms — 2002, 2008, and 2014 — before Omar Abdullah’s win in 2024.This time, Aga Syed Mehmood of the ruling NC faces a tough fight from PDP’s Aga Muntazir, making it a rare Shia-versus-Shia contest in the Valley. Other key contenders include BJP’s Syed Mohsin, Awami Ittehad Party’s Nazir Ahmad Khan, AAP’s Deeba Khan, and Independent candidate Muntazir Mohiuddin.As counting proceeds amid tight security, the results are expected to indicate not only the public mood in central Kashmir but also serve as a referendum on the Omar Abdullah-led government’s performance in its first year in office.","Counting of votes began for Budgam assembly bypoll in Jammu & Kashmir on Friday.

Congress contender Bijendra Chaudhary trails in second place, while Jan Suraaj’s Dr A.K. Das stands third, lagging by 2,280 votes according to initial trends.The Muzaffarpur Assembly constituency, located in north Bihar’s political heartland, has remained a key contest ground between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress, reflecting the broader political currents shaping the state. A general seat, Muzaffarpur has been a stage for some of the most closely fought electoral battles in recent years, with both parties alternating victories.In the 2020 Assembly elections, Congress candidate Bijendra Chaudhary defeated BJP’s Suresh Kumar Sharma by a narrow margin of 6,326 votes, securing 81,871 votes to Sharma’s 75,545.The constituency had 3,22,538 registered voters and recorded 1,70,011 valid votes.

He polled 72,301 votes, while Jamal received 25,862 out of 1,21,797 valid votes.The alternating results between Sharma and Chaudhary underscore Muzaffarpur’s shifting political landscape, shaped by both local dynamics and evolving alliance equations in north Bihar.The 2024 Lok Sabha elections further highlighted the BJP’s strength in the region. Raj Bhushan Choudhary of the BJP won the Muzaffarpur parliamentary seat by a commanding margin of 2,34,927 votes, defeating Congress candidate Ajay Nishad.Voter participation across Bihar has reached historic levels in the 2025 elections, with an overall turnout of 66.91 percent recorded for both phases combined.

NEW DELHI: As counting begins, all eyes are on Kargahar Assembly constituency in Rohtas district, where the Congress is defending a slender victory margin amid a four-way contest this time.Sitting MLA Santosh Kumar Mishra (INC) is seeking to retain the seat he won in 2020, facing a renewed challenge from JD(U)’s Bashisth Singh and Jan Suraaj’s Ritesh Ranjan Pandey, the Bhojpuri singer-actor making his political debut. It also sees a friendly fight between MGB partners INC and CPI, with left candidate Mahendra Prasad Gupta also in the fray.The entry of Pandey has turned the contest into one of the most closely watched battles in southwest Bihar, bringing a mix of traditional party loyalties and celebrity appeal.In 2020, Santosh Kumar Mishra of the Indian National Congress secured victory with 59,763 votes (30.76 per cent) defeating Bashisth Singh of the Janata Dal (United) who secured 55,680 votes (28.66 per cent) - a margin of 4,083 votes. Historically, the JD(U) had held the seat since its creation post-2008 delimitation: Ram Dhani Singh (JD(U)) won in 2010 and Bashisth Singh (JD(U)) in 2015 before the Congress breakthrough in 2020.With roughly 20.4 per cent of the electorate from Scheduled Castes and around 6.4 per cent Muslim voters, the constituency remains entirely rural, and caste equations are considered critical. Political analysts are watching Kargahar closely this year because of the slim winning margin in 2020 and an emerging triangular contest in 2025. The result will indicate whether Congress can consolidate its hold or if JD(U) and its allies can reclaim the seat.The vote share of other major candidates in 2020 included Uday Pratap Singh (BSP) with 47,321 votes (24.35 per cent) and others trailing behind. As counting starts this morning, Kargahar’s outcome will be among the early indicators of how party-waves and local dynamics are shaping up ahead of broader results across Bihar.","Sitting MLA Santosh Kumar Mishra (INC) is seeking to retain the seat he won in 2020.

NEW DELHI: Indian women's cricket team and World Cup-winning batter Jemimah Rodrigues has spoken publicly for the first time about the Khar Gymkhana controversy, which led to the suspension of her club membership last year.The controversy began in October 2024 when Khar Gymkhana terminated Rodrigues’ playing membership, alleging that her father had used her membership to book a hall for religious activities. Rodrigues, who became the first woman cricketer to receive membership in March 2023, denied any wrongdoing.Now nearly a year after the controversy, Rodrigues, who played a big role in India's triumphant ODI World Cup campaign, described the incident as one of the most difficult moments of her career.""To be honest, I remember when that happened. It was one thing for me to face it, but when my parents were dragged into it for something we didn’t do, it really hurt,"" she said while talking to India Today.She added, ""Everything we did at that time was according to the rules and regulations — and we had proof of that. But the allegations made against me and my family really affected us deeply because we had done nothing wrong.""Khar Gymkhana president Vivek Devnani had also denied the allegations at the time, calling them politically motivated ahead of the club’s elections.Recalling the timing of the controversy, Rodrigues said, ""That happened right after the (T20) World Cup in Dubai, where we hadn’t done well. I personally hadn’t performed to my expectations and was already feeling low. Then suddenly, I started seeing news, messages, and people saying terrible things about me — and worse, about my family and my church. That broke me. I remember my brother calling me, and I just started crying. I didn’t know what to do. It felt like one blow after another — first my performance, and then false allegations about my family.”Rodrigues bounced back strongly in the 2025 ODI World Cup, scoring 292 runs at an average of 58.40. Her unbeaten 127 in the semifinal against Australia helped India chase down 339 to reach the final and eventually lift the title.","Jemimah Rodrigues has spoken publicly for the first time about the Khar Gymkhana controversy.

Pakistan’s military chief helps save the series

The tension began on Tuesday when a suicide bombing outside a judicial complex in Islamabad killed 12 people and injured many others. The first ODI between Pakistan and Sri Lanka had taken place the same day in nearby Rawalpindi, where Pakistan edged a six-run win. News of the attack travelled quickly to the Sri Lankan camp, and the mood shifted from competitive focus to deep concern.By the next morning, worry had taken hold. PTI reported that eight players from Sri Lanka’s 16-member squad told team officials they wanted to return to Colombo. Their concerns centred on the proximity between Islamabad and Rawalpindi, the venue for all three ODIs. With so many players uncertain about staying, the second match scheduled for Thursday immediately became doubtful.Sri Lanka were also due to stay on for a tri nation T20I series involving Pakistan and Zimbabwe, but even that future plan became uncertain as the squad debated what to do next.Sri Lanka Cricket soon issued a statement confirming that several players had asked to fly home because they were uncomfortable with the situation. SLC said it was speaking closely with the Pakistan Cricket Board and local authorities to review the security situation.The board instructed the squad to continue the tour as planned, while also stating that any player or staff member who still wished to leave would be replaced immediately so the series could carry on.Later, the board adopted a stronger position. SLC directed all players to remain in Pakistan and warned that anyone returning against instructions would face a formal review on arrival back home. The intention was clear: the tour must go on.The PCB moved quickly as well, rearranging the remaining ODIs. The second match was pushed from Thursday to Friday, and the third match moved from Saturday to Sunday, with both fixtures still in Rawalpindi. PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi thanked Sri Lanka for agreeing to continue and said their willingness showed real sportsmanship. To strengthen confidence, Naqvi met the Sri Lankan players at their Islamabad hotel and assured them of complete protection.The worry among the visiting players was understandable. In 2009, the Sri Lankan team bus was attacked by armed men while travelling to the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. Several players, including Ajantha Mendis, Chaminda Vaas and Mahela Jayawardene, were injured, and Pakistani security officers were killed. That incident forced international cricket out of Pakistan for nearly a decade, and Sri Lanka were the first major team to return in 2019. The memory of that attack still lingers.While the ODI schedule was being sorted out, the PCB confirmed the updated plan for the T20 tri series. All matches featuring Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe will now take place in Rawalpindi. The tournament will start on 18 November with Pakistan playing Zimbabwe, and the final is set for 29 November, with all games beginning at 6 pm. Zimbabwe reached Pakistan early on Thursday, sticking to the original timetable.On Thursday, Mohsin Naqvi took direct charge of the situation. He arrived at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium with Sri Lankan High Commissioner Rear Admiral (R) Fred Siriweera and state minister Talal Chaudhry. Together, they inspected every layer of security prepared for the remaining ODIs. Naqvi urged security teams to give their best, and Siriweera expressed satisfaction with what he saw.From the stadium, Naqvi went straight to meet the Sri Lanka squad. He thanked them for deciding to stay at a difficult moment and reminded them that their safety in Pakistan was the country’s responsibility. He called their decision a stand for peace and said it proved that terrorism would not dictate the future of cricket tours.Later that day, Naqvi told the Senate that Pakistan’s Field Marshal Asim Munir had played a crucial role behind the scenes. Munir had spoken directly to Sri Lanka’s defence minister and secretary, offering full assurances when the visiting players first expressed reluctance to continue. Naqvi said the Sri Lankan team had initially made up their minds to fly home after the bombing, but the combined efforts of the PCB, SLC and senior officials on both sides eventually convinced them to stay. He described their decision as an act of courage at a very difficult time.",Sri Lankan players asked to fly home after suicide bombing in Islamabad. Concerns centred on the proximity between Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Mohsin Naqvi met the players at their Islamabad hotel and assured them of complete protection.

10. Chennai Super Kings – Devon Conway

The Indian Premier League 2026 retention deadline is just around the corner, with teams set to announce their lists by 15 November. As IPL franchises prepare for the upcoming mini auction next month, intense discussions are underway over who stays and who goes. Teams are weighing purse balance, player form, injury concerns, and overall value before finalising their lists of retentions.Since this is not a mega auction, franchises have the flexibility to retain or release as many players as they wish, provided they adhere to the rules: a maximum squad size of 25 players, up to 8 overseas, and a salary cap of ₹120 crore.The retention window has already been dominated by the sensational trade news between Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings, involving Sanju Samson Ravindra Jadeja , and Sam Curran. As reported by TimesofIndia.com, Royals have traded Samson to CSK in exchange for Jadeja and Curran — a deal all but finalised and expected to be announced soon.Ahead of the retention deadline, here are the Top 10 players who might be released before IPL 2026 mini auction:Veteran pacer Mohammed Shami failed to justify his ₹10 crore price tag after SRH went all out for him last season. Having released Bhuvneshwar Kumar earlier, SRH banked on Shami as a reliable seamer, but he only managed 6 wickets in 9 games at an average of 56.17. SRH might now look to reinvest that money in a more consistent performer.KKR splurged a massive ₹23.75 crore on Venkatesh Iyer during last year’s mega auction, but the move hasn’t paid off. The all-rounder managed just 142 runs in 11 matches at an average of 20.29 and strike rate of 139.22. With such a hefty amount tied up, KKR are expected to release him and possibly buy him back at a much lower price to boost their purse.MI signed Deepak Chahar for ₹9.25 crore in 2025, but his returns were modest — 11 wickets in 14 matches at an average of 34.18 and economy rate of 9.17. His recurring injuries and struggles in the death overs have made him a liability. MI might consider releasing him to free up funds or re-sign him for cheaper.Injuries have derailed Mayank Yadav’s promising IPL career. Retained last year for ₹11 crore, he featured in only 2 games in IPL 2025. With uncertainty surrounding his fitness, LSG may release him to recover a sizeable chunk of funds for the mini auction.Retained for ₹11 crore, Ravi Bishnoi’s form dipped drastically in IPL 2025. He managed just 9 wickets in 11 matches with an economy rate of 10.84. LSG could release him to refresh their bowling department and potentially bring him back at a lower cost.Bought for ₹6.5 crore, Anrich Nortje’s recurring injuries have limited his impact. The South African pacer played only 2 matches in IPL 2025, taking a solitary wicket at an economy of 11.86. KKR are likely to release him to make room for fitter overseas options.Defending champions RCB have a largely settled squad but could part ways with Liam Livingstone to strengthen their purse. Purchased for ₹8.75 crore, he scored just 112 runs in 10 games at an average of 16 and a strike rate of 133.33, while picking up only 2 wickets.DC spent ₹9 crore (using the RTM card) to bring in Jake Fraser-McGurk, but the Australian batter failed to impress.

It's incredible.""De Minaur's mindset improved following his personal struggle after Tuesday's loss to Musetti.""Regardless of the result today, I had made peace with myself. That was a big, big moment. I knew the way I wanted to play. I was going to commit to it from the first point to the last. I was okay with the result not going my way. I had made peace with that.

Harmanpreet Kaur gets emotional after leading India to World Cup glory

CHENNAI: Fourteen — nine in T20I and five in 50-over format — that’s the number of World Cups Harmanpreet Kaur has played. And over all these years, it had been the same story of heartbreaks and near-misses. Till it all changed earlier this month when Harman’s girls clinched the World Cup beating South Africa in the final. Having lived through every almost-there moment, Harmanpreet, still processing the victory, knows the weight of an ICC title and how hollow the cabinet can feel without it.“It’s still hard to believe that we have won the trophy but it feels good. I feel winning the World Cup trophy means a lot because even before this triumph we had been playing good cricket, we won so many bilateral series.But as a team we knew that the World Cup is something which is very important. The moment you don’t have an ICC title, it feels empty. I think we really wanted to fill this spot, so now that we have done that, I hope there are many more to come in the future,” said Harmanpreet after being felicitated by Sathyabama University here on Thursday.This historic first-ever ODI World Cup triumph is being hailed as a turning point in Indian women’s cricket.“It feels very good because the entire country is celebrating this victory. As a team we all wanted to do that...to inspire more girls to pick up any sport, not just cricket,” said Harmanpreet.The 36-year-old now wants to see more competition on the field, with more girls playing cricket so that the pool of talent grows. “I think already a lot of changes have happened, that’s why we were able to lift this cup. As cricketers we only demand for more matches which we are already getting now. We asked for the WPL (Women’s Premier League), and that’s there too. Now, it’s only about getting more players, more girl cricketers to the field so that we can have the same level of competition that men have in their game, ” said Harmanpreet.","Harmanpreet Kaur has played in 14 World Cups, nine in T20I and five in 50-over format.
