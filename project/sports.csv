"Bihar: Humble gamcha has its moment under the sun, courtesy PM Modi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-humble-gamcha-has-its-moment-under-the-sun-courtesy-pm-modi/articleshow/125474458.cms,"NEW DELHI: If one moment conveyed NDA's triumphant mood at the swearing-in ceremony in Patna after its massive poll win, it was the sight of PM Narendra Modi waving a 'gamcha' to the crowd of happy supporters, many of whom cheerfully responded by swinging their own 'gamchas'.A utilitarian accoutrement in everyday life, especially for the working class, the humble 'gamcha' had its proud moment under the sun courtesy Modi. He often wore it during his campaign, and waved it at jubilant BJP supporters at the party's headquarters on Nov 14 when he delivered his victory speech after NDA's massive win of 202 seats in the 243-member assembly.The gamcha is now part of mainstream Bihari dressing culture and the state's distinct identity, a change many will welcome. Parag Goswami, a professor at Pearl Academy, said Modi understands semiotics of culture and fashion and has tapped into the rural and working class identity by taking to the gamcha. As a political prop, it is a great identity marker and Modi conveys to the masses in states like Bihar and UP that he shares their culture code and symbols, he said.He noted that Modi had often connected with people in a similar manner, be it wearing the Assamese gamosa or vesti and angavastram, both associated with TN. These carry layers of meaning are valuable in populist identity-making.","PM Narendra Modi waved a 'gamcha' to the crowd of happy supporters at the swearing-in ceremony in Patna.

Watch: Nitish tries to touch Modi's feet at Patna airport; this is how PM reacts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/watch-nitish-tries-to-touch-modis-feet-at-patna-airport-this-is-how-pm-reacts/articleshow/125466473.cms,"Marking a Political Milestone, Nitish Kumar Sworn In as Bihar CM for the 10th Time





NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Thursday attempted to touch Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s feet in an unusual moment at the Patna airport, shortly before the PM departed after attending the Janata Dal (United) leader's swearing-in ceremony for a record 10th term.A video of the incident went viral, showing the 74-year-old JD(U) leader walking up to the prime minister and bending down in an apparent attempt to touch his feet.PM Modi immediately stopped him, holding Kumar firmly by the shoulders and clasping both hands of the JD(U) supremo, uttering a few niceties before heading up the aircraft stairs.RJD shared the clip on X, commenting, ""In the video, chief minister Nitish Kumar touches Prime Minister Modi's feet at the airport to receive his blessings!""Nitish Kumar, the longest-serving chief minister of Bihar, retained the post despite the BJP outperforming the JD(U) in the recently concluded assembly elections, which saw the NDA win a strong majority.The BJP won 89 seats, JD(U) 85, LJP(RV) 19, HAM 5 and RLM 4, giving the alliance 202 seats in the 243-member House.The NDA’s performance has been credited to the combined appeal of Modi and Nitish, both in their seventies—who have cultivated reputations for governance and women's empowerment, themes that strongly resonated with voters in this election.This is, however, not the first time the JD(U) chief has attempted to touch PM Modi’s feet.Many social media users also pointed out that Kumar had displayed similar behaviour before.In November last year, during an event in Darbhanga, Nitish Kumar bowed down as he approached PM Modi on stage, appearing to touch his feet.The Prime Minister immediately held Kumar’s hands, stood up, and shook hands with him instead.Later in June, during a gathering in Parliament's Central Hall, he attempted the same gesture, catching everyone off guard. In April, he had momentarily touched PM Modi's feet during a Lok Sabha campaign rally in Nawada, an incident that also drew wide attention.","Nitish Kumar is longest-serving chief minister of Bihar.

4 of 5 Bihar seats with max & min SIR deletions won by NDA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/4-of-5-bihar-seats-with-max-min-sir-deletions-won-by-nda/articleshow/125446144.cms,"Nitish Kumar To Take CM Oath For Record 10th Time At Patna's Gandhi Maidan, PM Modi To Attend

NEW DELHI: Though a push from women supporters on account of incentives, including a Rs 10,000 transfer in their bank accounts, was a big factor in NDA's landslide win in Bihar, the alliance wasn't the only beneficiary of high participation in the polls by women. AIMIM walked away with three of the five seats with the highest women voter turnout - namely Kochadhaman, Baisi and Amour - indicating that the correlation between women turnout and electoral outcome was not always straight. AIMIM's total tally was 5 seats. JDU, meanwhile, won in Thakurganj assembly constituency (AC) where 90% of the women turned up, while BJP was the victor in Pranpur, which saw 89% women turnout.The special intensive revision (SIR) exercise in Bihar, conducted amid resistance from the opposition led by Congress, saw NDA parties winning four of the five seats that accounted for the maximum as well as minimum deletions of electors in SIR. Significantly, Congress, with an overall tally of six seats, won Kishanganj despite the AC having recorded the fifth highest deletion among the state's 243 ACs, as well as Chanpatia, which saw second lowest deletion.As per Bihar poll datasets released by EC on Wednesday, BJP won three of the five seats with the highest net deletions - Gopalganj, Purnia and Motihari - followed by JDU, which won Kuchaikote. As regards the five ACs with the least net deletions, BJP and LJPRV won from two each. The datasets linking SIR and poll outcome, thus, do not fit into a pattern. Even so, the four seats (of total five) with the maximum and minimum deletions bagged by NDA are proportional to its overall 83% share in Bihar's 243 seats. Four of the five ACs with the maximum additions made to the Bihar electoral roll between Sept 30 and Oct 20 (the last date of nomination for Phase 2) are now represented by NDA parties, with BJP having its candidates elected from Nautan and Tarari, JDU from Thakurganj, Congress from Araria, and LJPRV from Chenari. The seats that saw the least number of additions to the roll in this period are now represented by JDU, BJP and LJPRV. Among the five seats with the highest winning margin, JDU won in Rupauli and Gopalpur, BJP in Digha and Aurai, and LJPRV in Sugauli. The list of top five ACs with the lowest victory margin includes Sandesh and Nabinagar won by JDU, Ramgarh won by BSP, Agiaon by BJP and Dhaka won by RJD.Congress won from Manihari (ST), the last among the five ACs that clocked the highest male polling percentage. BJP won two of the seats with the highest male voter turnout and three with the lowest male turnout. JDU and LJPRV each bagged one of the five seats with the highest and lowest male polling percentage.Kasba, which recorded the highest total polling percentage at 81.9%, ended up in LJPRV's kitty, Barari and Thakurganj ACs went the JDU way with 81.7% and 81.6% polling, respectively, while Congress bagged Kishanganj with the fifth highest overall turnout of 80.2%. BJP won four of the five seats with the lowest polling percentage - namely Kumhrar, Bankipur, Digha (all in Patna) and Biharsharif - even as JDU bagged Nawada.","AIMIM walked away with three of the five seats with the highest women voter turnout.

Delhi Student Suicide Case: Massive Protest Outside School After Note Alleges Harassment By Teachers

NEW DELHI: Four teachers of St Columba's School, named in an FIR filed in connection with the suicide by Class X student Shourya Patil (16), were on Thursday suspended.""The matter is under investigation... In view of the seriousness of the allegations, the competent authority has decided to place you under suspension with immediate effect,"" the order said, adding the teachers ""must stay available for official communication, avoid visiting the school or interacting with students, staff or parents without written permission"".Shourya's family returned for his last rites to Sangli, Maharashtra, where his grandparents live. He was cremated at his ancestral village, Dhawaleshwar, in Vita tehsil.Speaking to TOI on the phone, Shourya's father, Pradip Patil, said: ""For the past six months, he kept telling us he was being singled out and targeted even for normal conversations, and that teachers were humiliating him. We were repeatedly called to school over very small issues, especially in the past four months.""Days before the school vacations, Shourya had pleaded with his father to pull him out. His father had promised he would be shifted after the break. But the harassment was so relentless the teenager could no longer bear it, alleged his family.""His vacations were just 8-10 days away. After that, he only had to come for his pre-boards. We had assured him that once this was over, we would shift him to another school for the next two years.Because 20 internal marks are with the school, we didn't want to risk his board performance. We thought it was better not to create conflict with the teachers and just wait it out,"" he added.Patil described his son as charismatic and cheerful, someone who loved dancing and had recently represented the school at a competition just a month ago. ""We were planning a family trip to China after his board exams. It was his wish, everything was already planned,"" he said.The suicide note found in Shourya's bag stated that he was sorry and that his body parts should be donated to someone in need. It also mentioned the names of the teachers who allegedly humiliated him. ""My last wish is that action is taken against them, I don't want any other child to do something like me (sic),"" it said.A grief-stricken Patil said, ""Especially after reading his note — and I'm staying strong — we will not stop fighting for justice.""On Thursday, several parents, former students and family friends gathered in anger and grief. Copies of Shourya's handwritten suicide note were pasted outside the school gates and boundary walls, drawing crowds of parents who stopped to read his final words.Chandrashil Dhawan (35), a relative of the Patils at the protest, said, ""Several children have now told us they faced harassment from the same teachers. They were even planning to write everything down and go to the police.""He alleged Shourya had been threatened by teachers on the morning of the incident for not performing a dance because of a sprained ankle. He left through the back gate and never reached his pick-up point for his driver to find him. ""The next we heard,"" Dhawan said, ""was that he had jumped from the metro station.""Parents at the protest said the school's counsellors exist ""only on paper"" and students do not feel safe approaching them. Former students said the school must end what they described as a ""pick-and-point culture"" that singles out students repeatedly. Aditya Sagar (18), an alumnus, said, ""The school has counsellors, but students rarely approach them about teacher-related issues. They are all part of the same ecosystem, so it doesn't feel like a safe space to complain. ""A police team visited the school and interacted with the students. They also secured CCTV footage related to the incident. ""We have collected the details of the teachers named in the FIR, and summons will be issued to them to join the investigation,"" an officer said.","Four teachers of St Columba's School, Delhi, named in an FIR filed in connection with the suicide by Class X student Shourya Patil (16) were on Thursday suspended.

How “Tweaker” Became a Cultural Phenomenon

GELO - Tweaker (Official Video)

Tweaker 's Chart Domination and Viral Impact on Fans

How LiAngelo Ball Went From Basketball to Music Trailblazer

LiAngelo Ball’s transformation from overlooked basketball prospect to music industry headliner has officially reached a historic milestone. His debut single “Tweaker,” released under the stage name Gelo, has achieved platinum status - an achievement that puts him in the same conversation as heavyweight artists like Drake . For an athlete-turned-musician, this level of success is both unprecedented and culturally significant, signaling a genuine crossover moment that few have ever achieved.This accomplishment not only redefines LiAngelo’s public identity but also marks the peak of a rapid rise that began in early 2025. From a player often overshadowed by his brothers Lonzo and LaMelo Ball, LiAngelo has carved out an entirely new lane, proving that his artistic instincts and musical ambition were far more than a curiosity.Released in January 2025, “Tweaker” exploded online almost instantly. Its nostalgic, bouncy beat - powered by piano, organ keys, and lush synth pads - captured the spirit of early-2000s hip-hop. Paired with Gelo’s melodic, sing-song delivery and a catchy “whoa” hook reminiscent of Big Tymers-era anthems, the track resonated widely. Produced by Kunica and Glockie Cheez, the song painted a picture of luxury, swagger, and newfound fame, creating an irresistible vibe that appealed to both younger listeners and fans of classic hip-hop aesthetics.Its momentum grew even stronger as the song spread into sports culture.NBA and NFL teams, including the Detroit Lions, Chicago Bulls, and Cleveland Cavaliers, embraced “Tweaker” as a celebratory anthem in locker rooms and warm-up sessions, pushing its reach far beyond the usual music circles.The success of “Tweaker” eventually led to a massive $13 million record deal with Def Jam and Universal Music Group. The contract included an extraordinary $8 million guaranteed signing bonus—more than what many current NBA players earn annually. This landmark deal solidified Gelo’s credibility and marketability within the hip-hop and R&B world.Adding even more momentum, a high-profile remix featuring Lil Wayne elevated the track’s status, giving it a stamp of approval from one of rap’s most influential figures.“Tweaker” made history by reaching No. 1 on the US Rhythmic Billboard chart - an exceptional feat for a debut single from a former basketball player. The song sparked viral dance trends across social platforms and earned praise from artists like T-Pain, Lil Yachty, and Joe Budden. Its appeal spanned music, sports, and online culture, cementing LiAngelo Ball as 2025’s breakout music star.Before his rise in music, LiAngelo Ball spent years navigating international basketball leagues and the NBA G-League. Eventually, he stepped away from the sport entirely - a decision validated by his explosive success. His debut album League of My Own, released in July 2025, showcased his evolution as an artist and reaffirmed his place in the industry.LiAngelo Ball’s platinum achievement for “Tweaker” is more than a win for himself - it is a defining cultural moment. By stepping into music and dominating charts, he has written a rare success story that bridges athletics, entertainment, and mainstream culture.","LiAngelo Ball’s debut single “Tweaker,” released under the stage name Gelo, has achieved platinum status.

Candace Owens claims the story about the day Charlie Kirk was shot does not make sense to her. She shared her thoughts during Myron Gaines’ livestream, which was uploaded to YouTube on November 18, 2025. Owens said she has been looking into the case on her own, and from what she has seen, the clips and details shown to the public feel incomplete. She pointed out that the public has not seen the exact moment when the shot was fired, and only a short clip of a person running after the shooting was released.Owens also said that Tyler Robinson, the man accused of shooting Charlie Kirk, may not have played the role many people think. She claimed that his fingerprints were found on the gun but said they were not the only fingerprints present. She also said another person named Lance Twiggs might have had a bigger role that day. Candace Owens stressed that these are her claims based on what she has seen so far.During the livestream, Candace Owens explained what she believed happened on the day Charlie Kirk was shot. She said she thinks the whole situation looked like a planned setup with many people involved, not just one person acting alone.Myron Gaines asked her why she thought the story felt wrong, and she said there were gaps that did not add up.Candace Owens said that in her view, Tyler Robinson’s only real link to the case was that his fingerprints were found on the gun. She said his prints were not the only prints and claimed that this detail was not openly talked about.She also said that she does not believe Robinson stepped onto the campus that day.

Details of the elevator confrontation involving Trevon Diggs

Legal fallout and implications for Trevon Diggs and his family

The new Trevon Diggs violence allegations claim his involvement in an elevator situation that has become highly publicized. Now, the surveillance footage of an incident taking place inside a Los Angeles apartment building has rekindled debate over who was ever in the lift that night and just what went on inside.The video, along with legal allegations made by the alleged victim, has given rise to speculation about the involvement of people associated with the Diggs family despite Trevon Diggs not being officially named in any criminal complaint. The authorities are closely monitoring further details as they become available.Surveillance video shows the alleged victim, Christopher Blake Griffith, remaining within an elevator when its doors opened for a man outside the doors. After a quick exchange of words on the ground level, Griffith tried to go back into the elevator when the person standing at the doorstep had the front elevator doors continue to open, thus preventing the doors from closing.A few moments later, two more men got into the elevator and began to attack Griffith. In the footage, one attacker is seen taking a chain from the victim's neck while the others punched him repeatedly.And they took a different elevator to leave post-attack. Later, police revealed a robbery report listed jewelry among the items taken.Although the clip doesn't name all those present, the incident has become controversial due to alleged connections of the Diggs family to the altercation. Diggs was never charged, though similar implications have ignited a media firestorm.Also Read: Jerry Jones breaks silence on Trevon Diggs after mysterious home accident before Washington game The legal fallout from the incident has drawn a civil suit from Christopher Blake Griffith, who claims he was physically injured, traumatized, and financially harmed during the attack. He is suing for damages and the value of the property he said was stolen, and his lawyers argue that several people helped plan for the attack.One of the Diggs brothers, Darez Diggs, has already faced legal proceedings connected to the confrontation and entered a no-contest plea to a related charge, resulting in probation. Meanwhile, separate accusations made by Griffith against Stefon Diggs prompted Stefon to file a defamation lawsuit aimed at clearing his name.The investigation continues, but analysts will certainly be monitoring whether Trevon Diggs will be charged further. If confirmed, it could affect his personal brand, team status, and sponsorship deals as well. The story is ongoing, and legal entities and the NFL community at large are watching the developments as they continue to unfold the matter.","Surveillance video shows alleged victim, Christopher Blake Griffith, remaining within an elevator when its doors opened for a man outside the doors.

It’s there in sharpened form.When Taylor Swift sings, “All that time, I sat alone in my tower / You were just honing your powers,” listeners immediately connected it to Joe’s famously private lifestyle and his recent role in a new Hamlet film.The overlap between Ophelia, Hamlet, and Taylor’s real-life history is simply too on-the-nose for fans to ignore.What makes the moment hit even harder is how openly Swift seems to be reclaiming her narrative. Rather than turning her breakup into bitterness, she’s framing it as the final chapter of a darker era, one that allowed her to rise stronger and choose a love that fits her world rather than hides from it. Joe Alwyn, for his part, has subtly signaled he’s over the conversation, reportedly saying he’s moved on and suggesting fans do the same. But Swifties aren’t budging it.For Swift, this track feels like a mic-drop: a poetic goodbye to the past, a wink at the present, and a reminder that she’ll always turn heartbreak into art, even if some people would prefer not to be name-checked in her mythology..","Swifties interpret lyrics about rescue and rebirth as a nod to her current relationship, contrasting it with her past.

How Michael Irvin discovered his wife’s early-onset Alzheimer’s

“We recognized some things were going wrong with her about ten years ago… We thought it was menopause… We buried my mom. She had Alzheimer’s. My mother-in-law was living with us because she had Alzheimer’s. And now we thought my wife was going through menopause at 49 because she’s coming at 50.”

Michael Irvin On Wife Having Alzheimer's In Her 50s | CLUB SHAY SHAY

“It’s quite hard to take care of someone 24 hours a day… I have to keep a 24-hour nurse with her all the time.”

“If anyone has earned the right to stay in her house, MY WIFE HAS!!! … That I shall honour. No matter what it takes.”

Being a football legend is one thing, but facing life’s toughest plays off the field is a whole different ballgame.

At the time, they thought it might be normal aging or menopause but it soon became clear that something more serious was happening and it needed attention. His emotional revelation gives fans a glimpse of the human side of a public figure often celebrated for his athletic prowess.Talking candidly, Irvin shared:This initial uncertainty highlights how subtle the early signs ofcan be especially in someone so young. Very early-onset Alzheimer’s (diagnosed under 65) is rare, and Irvin’s story shows the complex emotions families face when symptoms first appear.Irvin didn’t shy away from describing the realities of caring for his wife:Balancing the responsibilities of caregiving with his public life has been a profound challenge. Yet, Irvin’s dedication never wavered. He emphasizes the emotional labor behind every decision, reflecting a side of him fans rarely see, the deep and unwavering devotion of a husband navigating one of life’s hardest battles.For Irvin, the focus has always been on Sandy’s comfort and dignity. He explained :Rather than placing her in a facility, the couple relies on a live-in caregiver to ensure Sandy remains in the home they built together. This choice underscores both love and respect, showing that Irvin’s heroics aren’t just on the football field they’re at home, too.Michael Irvin’s story is a reminder that real strength often comes in quiet, daily acts of love and care. Through sleepless nights, emotional trials, and public attention, he stands by Sandy, determined to honor her wishes and protect her dignity. His devotion paints a powerful picture of resilience, showing that heroism isn’t always loud or celebrated. Sometimes, it’s found in quiet loyalty, unwavering faith, and the courage to love without limits.Also read - “The plot of a rom-com”: Madison Beer and Justin Herbert’s Lakers date goes viral after his heroic move melts the internet",Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin has opened up about one of the most personal challenges of his life.

Philadelphia 76ers Injury Report vs the Milwaukee Bucks (November 20, 2025)

Theenter tonight’s matchup against the Philadelphia 76ers facing a major setback, as they will be without their franchise cornerstone. The anticipation surrounding this Eastern Conference meeting was already high, with both teams dealing with significant injuries, but thechanges the tone of the contest entirely. Fans expected a high-intensity duel between two playoff contenders, yet the spotlight now shifts to how each side adjusts without key contributors.This matchup was also meant to serve as an early-season measuring stick for both squads. The Bucks have been working to build chemistry under Doc Rivers while navigating depth challenges, and the 76ers are trying to stay competitive amid injury turbulence of their own. But with Giannis officially out, Milwaukee’s offensive and defensive systems will undergo their toughest test of the season so far.Giannis Antetokounmpo will not be available tonight as he recovers from a low-grade left groin strain suffered during a recent game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. The injury occurred in the second quarter, after which he did not return, prompting immediate concern across the organization. Following evaluations and consultations with the medical staff, head coach Doc Rivers confirmed that Giannis is expected to miss roughly one to two weeks.Losing the player who leads the team in both scoring and usage - averaging more than 31 points per game - creates a massive void for Milwaukee.Giannis’ impact extends beyond offensive production; his presence anchors the Bucks’ pace, rim pressure, transition attack, and interior defense. His absence naturally forces the team to rework rotations and identify new offensive initiators.With Giannis Antetokounmpo sidelined, Bobby Portis is expected to take on an expanded role. Historically, Portis has thrived when stepping in for the former MVP, boosting his scoring, minutes, and physical presence on the court. However, Milwaukee’s depth issues extend beyond Giannis: Taurean Prince remains out due to neck surgery, and Kevin Porter Jr. is unavailable following right knee surgery. These combined absences strain the team’s flexibility and reduce Rivers’ lineup options.Also read: Philadelphia 76ers vs Milwaukee Bucks regular season game: Full injury report, who's out, and more (November 20, 2025) The 76ers enter the game with their own health setbacks. Kelly Oubre Jr. is out for at least two weeks because of a knee sprain, while Joel Embiid is listed as doubtful as he continues managing knee discomfort. Even with these injuries, Philadelphia still retains a more stable core for tonight’s matchup compared to Milwaukee, given the magnitude of losing Giannis Antetokounmpo.","Giannis Antetokounmpo will not be available tonight as he recovers from a low- grade left groin strain suffered during a recent game against the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Japanese slugger Kazuma Okamoto ready to make impact

Pitcher Kona Takahashi brings rotation depth and Japanese craftsmanship

It is a historic moment for baseball in Japan. With that, two of the best developed talents in Japan, Kazuma Okamoto and Kona Takahashi, have been posted for the Major League Baseball market and are now able to negotiate with clubs in the U.S.The dual posting is certainly a step forward in international baseball relations, as it highlights the increased prominence of Japanese players around the world. Each being an elite talent with wide-ranging skills and plenty of success in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), their arrival could change the upcoming player segment of MLB free-agency. Both players now enter a critical 45-day window to secure MLB deals, after which they would return to their Japanese clubs if unsigned.At 29, Okamoto is seen as one of the premier power hitters in Japan. Since 2014, he's been mostly a corner infielder with the Yomiuri Giants, where he's hit 248 home runs in 1,074 games total, including six seasons in a row of 30 or more homers from 2018-23. Despite injuries constraining him to 69 games in '25, he turned in a superb. 327 batting average with a .598 OPS – showing his bat is still quite potent.Because he can play either end of the infield, Okamoto is not only one of the most powerful bats available in free agency but also one of the most flexible, something most MLB rosters will always be in the market for.His experience and production make him one of the most sought-after players on the international market this offseason.Takahashi, a right-handed starter from the Saitama Seibu Lions, brings a solid pitching resume with him into this posting. He's also sustained more than 1,500 innings of tough work through 2022-23 seasons with a 2.20 ERA and 1.13 WHIP in 330⅔ innings. His numbers did fall off a bit in 2024 and 2025, with ERAs in the low-3. Scouts think of him as a solid mid-rotation option with added potential, still, in the 00s range.His style emphasises command and precision rather than overpowering velocity, an approach that could translate well in MLB if managed carefully. Takahashi presents some good value for the clubs that are going to want solid starters without shelling out for top-shelf arms.Okamoto & Takahashi jointly highlight how Japanese baseball churns Major League-ready talent at the highest levels. Yes, their posting this year adds another layer of strategy and urgency to MLB's international market, and teams that act quickly to lock them down can obtain an unparalleled competitive advantage next season.Also Read: MLB trade rumors: Bo Bichette declines Blue Jays' qualifying offer for 2026 as Toronto braces for a pivot","Kazuma Okamoto and Kona Takahashi have been posted for the Major League Baseball market.

Similarly, San Jose has found in Celebrini the centerpiece needed to steer the Sharks out of rebuild mode and back into contention. Looking ahead, both stars are likely to feature prominently on Team Canada rosters for the 2026 Olympics and future World Cup of Hockey tournaments, cementing their legacy as NHL game-changers.Connor Bedard and Macklin Celebrini are doing more than chasing the Art Ross Trophy—they are reshaping the NHL landscape.

AJ Lee and fan Chris Horror clash after altered “kissing” video goes viral

AJ Lee had a very serious moment this week after a fan posted a fake video of her. AJ Lee, the former WWE star, met fans at The Big Event Entertainment & Sports Expo last weekend. One fan, who goes by @Chris_HorrorYT on X, took a normal meet-and-greet video with her. But later, he changed the clip and posted an altered video that made it look like AJ Lee and he were kissing. The fake video upset many people online because it was not real, and it was made without AJ Lee’s permission. When AJ Lee saw the post, she replied on X and wrote, “This is inappropriate and it is harassment. Please delete.”Even after AJ Lee asked him to take the video down, the fan did not remove it. This made fans even more angry, and the story spread across many wrestling news sites.Reports from NoDQ, SEScoops, and Fightful say the problem started after the fan edited the clip to make it look like he kissed AJ Lee at the event. The video was not true and was changed using simple editing tools. AJ Lee spoke up right away because the clip could harm her image and was very disrespectful. Her message made it clear that she did not agree to this and wanted it removed.But instead of deleting the video, @Chris_HorrorYT answered another user who called the clip “flattering.”He replied, “Thank you!!!!” and even added a GIF of Vince McMahon. This reply made the situation worse because it looked like he was proud of the fake clip.Many fans online said the video crossed a line because it changed a normal meeting into something false. WWE fans also pointed out that wrestlers already deal with many tough fan situations, and this adds more stress. The video also stayed up all week, even after AJ Lee clearly told him to delete it.Wrestling fans on X/Twitter kept asking the fan to take the clip down and respect AJ Lee’s wishes. This story spread fast online because AJ Lee is a very popular name in wrestling.Her strong and clear response showed that she did not accept this kind of behavior. Fans are now asking for better rules at fan events and on social media to protect wrestlers from altered videos like this in the future.Also Read: WWE RAW Madison Square Garden Became Historic With Three Bombshell Returns","AJ Lee met fans at The Big Event Entertainment & Sports Expo last weekend.

Aaron Rodgers eyes return against Bears after Wrist injury, Adam Schefter confirms

Steelers’ Aaron Rodgers won’t need surgery on fractured wrist | Pro Football Talk | NFL on NBC

Aaron Rodgers’ past battles with Bears adds extra motivation for Steelers match



Aaron Rodgers’ return for Sunday’s showdown against the Chicago Bears remains uncertain after he suffered a broken wrist in last week’s 32-14 win over the Cincinnati Bengals. The 41-year-old four-time NFL MVP is determined but cautious, aware that rushing back too soon could aggravate the injury. Adam Schefter reveals Rodgers is pushing to practice and hopes to take the field, a potential boost for the Steelers as they aim to maintain their position in the division standings.Despite the injury, Rodgers’ drive to play is high. Now leading the Steelers’ offense, he brings veteran leadership and experience to Pittsburgh. Sunday’s matchup against Chicago carries extra significance, offering Rodgers a chance to write another memorable chapter in his legendary career while facing one of the NFL’s most historic rivalries.Rodgers injured his non-throwing wrist late in the first half against Cincinnati when he rolled to his left and landed awkwardly. While it’s not his throwing wrist, he must be able to protect himself and handle the ball safely to be cleared. Rodgers could return to practice as early as Thursday, with Steelers coach Mike Tomlin highlighting Friday as a crucial day for deciding the starting QB. “As for Aaron Rodgers, a big test today,” ESPN’s Adam Schefter said.“He plans to try to practice despite the fact that he has a fracture in his left wrist. We’ll see how that practice goes. Clearly didn’t practice yesterday. Wants to play on Sunday in Chicago. Has been pushing to play.”If Rodgers cannot play, Mason Rudolph is prepared to step in. Rudolph has excelled in previous appearances, posting a QB rating near 120 and helping Pittsburgh stay competitive. He’s ready for any scenario, drawing on past experiences to handle a sudden start. The quarterback room remains upbeat, with Rodgers offering support and guidance, helping maintain focus and cohesion ahead of Sunday’s matchup.Rodgers’ motivation to return goes beyond the Steelers’ playoff push. The 41-year-old four-time MVP has a long history with Chicago, having clashed memorably with the Bears throughout his Green Bay career. “There’s incentive for every opponent, but I have enjoyed many Sundays, Mondays, and Thursdays in that city,” Rodgers said. “It’s a great sports town, phenomenal fans, and a great place to play.” This experience adds another layer of significance to Sunday’s game, even as he navigates recovery from a broken wrist.Rodgers’ return would strengthen the Steelers’ playoff aspirations while testing his recovery from a broken wrist. Pittsburgh’s offense hinges on his leadership, and his performance against the Bears could define the team’s push in the NFL’s competitive division, adding another milestone to Rodgers’ storied career.Also Read: Isaiah Rodgers subtly mocks with $17K penalty comment on Isaac Rochell’s reel after Allison Kuch reacts to Ja’Marr Chase’s $507K fine","Aaron Rodgers could return to practice as early as Thursday.

Jason Kelce shares solution for Jalen Hurts, Eagles reported issues

The Eagles are in the running for the No. 1 seed after beating the Detroit Lions. At 8–2, the Eagles are tied for the NFC’s best record as they try to defend their Super Bowl crown. But despite their strong start, the team has faced constant reports of internal issues. Star receiver A.J. Brown is reportedly frustrated with his reduced role in an offense that has been under constant scrutiny. Needless to say, some of that frustration has been directed at quarterback Jalen Hurts, whose numbers are good overall but who has struggled at times to consistently feed the team’s top weapons.Jason Kelce, who spent his entire 13-year career with the Philadelphia Eagles, recently opened up about his unhappiness over what he’s hearing about the Eagles this season.After their trip to the Super Bowl in 2022, the Eagles’ 2023 season was full of escalating tensions and even talk that coach Nick Sirianni could be fired. That team exited in the wild-card round, only to rebound and win the Super Bowl the following year.That chaotic 2023 season was also the final one for longtime centre Jason Kelce. Now, it goes without saying that the 2025 squad is showing some similar warning signs. Kelce went on local station SportsRadio 94WIP to talk about what the Eagles can do to fix things inside the locker room.“I think the quotes on Jalen—I think there are frustrations on a team that build up continually. I think Jalen gets a lot of the highlighting of that because he’s the quarterback,” Kelce said. “... This is part of being part on a team, there are so many ups and downs.”Kelce then got emotional while recalling a story about how he and Eagles right tackle Lane Johnson didn't speak for an entire offseason because of a fight they had.""Me and Lane Johnson, one year, at the end of Chip Kelly's career, Lane made a comment in the media and said something along the lines of, 'The up-tempo offense is way too hard on us in practice and we're working too difficult and guys are getting fatigued.' And I remember reading that... and I went out and said something in the media and said, 'What does Lane know? Lane's only been with the Philadelphia Eagles. How does he know what it feels like to do other practices? He's only practiced with Chip Kelly. ..'""Lane then made another comment. Lane and I didn't talk for an entire offseason. Lane is like one of my best friends. Like, I love that guy. And this is part of being on a team. There are so many ups and downs... this thing brings out emotions and sides of people because you all want to win so bad...""Kelce used this reference to address what the Eagles can do to move forward. He added that the only way the Eagles can solve the issues is by being accountable and talking about it.He said, “I think by and large, the body of work Jalen has put out there, you can’t deny, in my opinion. I think you need to continue to work through this and be accountable and maintain these relationships in a healthy way.”Also Read: More coverage from the NFL","The Philadelphia Eagles are 8–2 and tied for the NFC’s best record.

WTC Final: Steve Smith on future, facing South Africa and revised format

Poll Who do you think won the battle of words between Monty Panesar and Steve Smith? Monty Panesar Steve Smith It's a tie

The first Test of the Ashes has begun with an unexpected off-field storm, as former England spinner Monty Panesar unleashed a blistering response to Australia's stand-in captain Steve Smith , escalating what has become the most unlikely feud of the series. Smith had earlier mocked Panesar's infamous Celebrity Mastermind appearance while reacting to the former cricketer's advice that England should needle the Australian skipper by resurrecting memories of the 2018 Sandpaper Gate scandal. The Australian star told reporters to “do yourself a favour” and watch Panesar's quiz-show errors — including mixing up Athens' location and calling America a city — calling it “pretty comical”.But Panesar struck back with ferocity in a Telegraph column, claiming he had “won the battle” and branding Smith's press-conference comments as proof of “mental vulnerability” ahead of a blockbuster series opener.“To think that he wanted to talk about me before one of the biggest days of his career… is flattering and nothing short of hilarious,” Panesar wrote. “I cannot believe he has dug out the old YouTube clip of my shocker and memorised it word by word.”Panesar conceded his Mastermind performance was “terrible” and “a shocker”, but insisted it was still preferable to Smith's own missteps. “We've both made mistakes, but at least mine was on a celebrity quiz show.His was on a cricket field, and we both have to live by them. It seems right now only one of us can.”The former spinner went further, saying if he ever confronted Smith, he would question whether the 36-year-old could “look himself in the mirror yet” after Cape Town 2018. “I would ask Steve whether he can actually admit he was part of Sandpapergate — the worst example of Australian cheating in history.”Panesar suggested Smith's reaction proved England had already succeeded in getting inside his head. “I am delighted to have got so far inside his mind… imagine how much damage Ben Stokes and his side are going to be able to do once play starts in Perth?”He even offered sledging scripts for England players: “If I was Jofra Archer, I'd be telling him ‘I'm swinging the ball even without sandpaper'; if I was Joe Root: ‘Fine or coarse paper, mate? Tell us the tricks of your trade.'”With both sides gearing up for the brutal on-field contest, the Panesar–Smith saga has added an unexpected psychological subplot to an already high-voltage Ashes opener.",Former England spinner Monty Panesar hits back at Steve Smith.

Poll Do you believe off-spinners are becoming an endangered species in Indian cricket? Yes, definitely No, they are still competitive Unsure

Ashwin bhai se

milna hai. Kuch baatein puchni hai, who nahi bata sakta aur bas wickets lene hai

Growing up in Rohtak, Nikhil Kashyap spent his teenage years playing tennis-ball cricket and foxing batters with his carrom ball -- an art he learnt after spending hours on YouTube watching R Ashwin 's bowling videos.""He (Ashwin) is my idol. I have spent hours watching his videos. He is a magician,"" Kashyap tells TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.""I am a big fan of his variations, especially the way he tricks the right-handed batters,"" he says.With 24 wickets in five matches, the 25-year-old, in his debut season, has set the Ranji Trophy on fire. The Haryana off-spinner is ninth on the leading wicket-takers list and is the lone off-spinner in the top 20.In a country full of cricketing talent across skills, there is a lack of quality off-spinners coming through the system. They have become an endangered species in Indian cricket . After R Ashwin, Washington Sundar is carrying the baton, but in domestic cricket, the crop seems to have dried up. There are very few who can challenge Washington's place. With leg-spinners and left-arm spinners dominating both white-ball and red-ball formats, off-spinners have slipped down the pecking order.The selectors had their eyes on Pulkit Narang before focus shifted to Tanush Kotian, who was even flown to Australia during the Border Gavaskar Trophy when R Ashwin dropped the retirement bombshell. Madhya Pradesh's Saransh Jain's name is also constantly doing rounds but none have made a pressing case for selection.""Being an off-spinner is a challenge,"" admits Kashyap, who made his first-class debut this season only after veteran off-spinner Jayant Yadav moved to Puducherry.""The offies get the ball only if a left-handed batter is at the crease. If the opposition is right-handed heavy, you will see left-arm bowlers operating from both ends. It happens in age-group cricket as well,"" he says.However, Kashyap, who first held the leather ball at the age of 17 when he joined the Shri Ram Narain Cricket Club (SRNCC) academy in Rohtak, where his coaches Ashwani Kumar and Tejinder Mann not only honed his skills but also made him realise that if he wanted to have a successful career, feels he must not think about match-ups.""There is no fear in me. I love bowling to the right-handed batters. There is a different level of satisfaction if you get them out after setting them up in a spell on a flat track,"" laughs Kashyap.Kashyap, who is a late bloomer, didn’t play age-group cricket for Haryana. But the Haryana Cricket Association (HCA) kept faith in him, and he played two seasons at U-23 level. Last year, he was picked for the Ranji camp, but an unfortunate injury cost him an entire season.""The side strain delayed my senior debut for Haryana. I was a bit angry with my luck, but it made me hungry,"" he says.Like his childhood hero R Ashwin, Kashyap stands 6 feet 2 inches, and he believes that with his height he doesn't rely much on surfaces.""A good spinner will take wickets on all pitches. Why R Ashwin is considered a great is because he has done well wherever he has played,"" he says.""I feel bowling on a turner is also an art. You have to pick that one spot and it is not easy because you get greedy as a spinner when you see the turn and bounce. So, you need to be very cautious with your speed, your variations and length,"" he explains.The lanky spinner says what has helped him in his debut season is his variations.""I have four different variations. There is one normal stock ball (off-spin), one slider, arm ball and then carrom ball. I am also working on getting that drift if the pitch is seam-friendly,"" says Kashyap.Off-spinners are struggling to create an impact in red-ball cricket too, even at the domestic level. In the shorter formats, they rely on multiple variations and can often get away with minor errors because of the spread-out field. But red-ball cricket offers no such cushion; one loose delivery that goes for a boundary immediately releases all the pressure on the batter.""It is challenging. But I am relishing every opportunity. I see myself as a wicket-taker, and it has helped me. I go for wickets. The more revs I put on the ball, the better I will become. When the batters step out and hit me over the top, it makes me smile, because I have won half the battle. Because for them, it is a release shot, but for me, I will try and get him out the next time he uses his feet,"" he says.In modern cricket, white-ball cricket offers more lucrative opportunities and financial rewards than red-ball cricket. However, Kashyap, who is yet to receive a call from an IPL franchise, wants to perform well for Haryana in white-ball cricket and hopes to meet R Ashwin at some point.(I want to meet Ashwin. I need to ask him a few things. I can’t reveal what they are, and I just want to take wickets),"" he says.","Haryana off-spinner Nikhil Kashyap is ninth on the leading wicket-takers list. The 25-year-old has set the Ranji Trophy on fire with 24 wickets in five matches. With leg-spinners and left-arm spinners dominating both white-ball and red-ball formats, off- spinners have slipped down the pecking order.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125475787,imgsize-33890,width-400,resizemode-4/nikhil-kashyap.jpg"
'Not even allowed to fail': Former cricketer questions Sarfaraz Khan's omission from Indian Test team,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/not-even-allowed-to-fail-former-cricketer-questions-sarfaraz-khans-omission-from-indian-test-team/articleshow/125468978.cms,"Sarfaraz Khan

NEW DELHI: Sarfaraz Khan ’s continued absence from the Indian Test team has led to questions from several former players. The Mumbai batter has not played a Test since November 2024.Meanwhile, former India cricketer Aakash Chopra said Sarfaraz has been affected by a perception issue. Sarfaraz has played six Tests so far, scoring 371 runs at an average of 37.10, with three fifties and one century. His highest score in Tests is 150.""I think there is a clarity issue in the case of Sarfaraz. I think it is a case of perception and understanding. I am trying to think—they might have a perception that he may not do as well in swinging conditions or play fast bowling well. Maybe he is not our guy in SENA countries. So he did not get the chance. But even to make that perception, I have to allow him to fail. He is not even being allowed to fail. And now there is no place in the team as well,"" Chopra said on Shubhankar Mishra's YouTube channel.Chopra added, ""I think Sarfaraz should play, or else it would be unfair.""Sarfaraz has also has had a difficult Ranji Trophy season so far, scoring 178 runs in five matches with one fifty.The right-hander batter’s returns are indeed low for the lofty standards he has set in the Ranji Trophy in the seasons preceding his India Test call-up. He made 556 runs in 2022-23 season in six matches at 92.66, piled up as many as 982 runs in 2021-22 at 122.75 in six matches, and before that, Sarfaraz smacked 928 runs in the 2019-20 season in six matches at 154.66.","Former India cricketer Aakash Chopra said Sarfaraz has been affected by a perception issue.

Milwaukee Bucks Injury Report vs the Philadelphia 76ers (November 20, 2025)

Decisive Final Moments

The injury reports for the highly anticipated matchup between the Philadelphia 76ers and Milwaukee Bucks on November 20, 2025, reveal significant absences for both teams, setting the stage for a game of resilience and strategic adjustments. Early-season battles like this often help shape the tone for the months ahead, and both sides will look to make a statement.What will elevate the stakes even further is the sense that this contest could foreshadow a future playoff collision. With each team managing injuries and experimenting with rotations, observers will be watching closely to see how depth, adaptability, and coaching strategy will unfold in real time.The 76ers face their own set of challenges. Kelly Oubre Jr. is out for at least two weeks due to a left knee sprain sustained in a recent game against Detroit Pistons. Joel Embiid’s status remains uncertain; he is currently managing a right knee injury, and after missing four consecutive games, his return is doubtful for the game against the Bucks. Meanwhile, Paul George, who recently returned from knee issues, is listed as questionable but has been managing workload carefully.Adem Bona is also out with a right ankle sprain, which could impact Philadelphia’s rim protection and bench depth. The injury situation compels the 76ers to adapt their lineup, likely relying heavily on Tyrese Maxey, Jaren McCain, and veterans like Tobias Harris to carry the offensive and defensive load.The Milwaukee Bucks will be entering this game without their superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is dealing with a low-grade left groin strain sustained in their recent match against the Cleveland Cavaliers. According to trusted sources, Antetokounmpo is expected to miss approximately one to two weeks, which is a significant blow given his role as the team’s leading scorer and defensive anchor. His absence forces the Bucks to rely more heavily on players like Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, and emerging talents like Ryan Rollins, who may see increased responsibilities.Additionally, Taurean Prince remains sidelined indefinitely with a herniated disk in his neck. Kevin Porter Jr. is also out recovering from right knee meniscus surgery, with a return projected for early December. This series of injuries has thinned Milwaukee’s wing depth, compelling coach Mike Budenholzer to optimize rotation and tactical flexibility.Also read: Is Joel Embiid playing tonight vs the Milwaukee Bucks?

Why this Vancouver Canucks vs. Dallas Stars matchup could become a high-scoring showdown

NHL Picks & Predictions Today 11/20/25 | The Wraparound

The Vancouver Canucks and the Dallas Stars, two teams that everyone has been waiting for, face off on Thursday, November 20, 2025, and the start of the game has been set for 10 p.m. ET. The venue for this match is none other than Rogers Arena in Vancouver, British Columbia. American viewers will be able to watch the game live on ESPN+, whereas FOX Sports will provide the fans with real-time updates and boxscore coverage. The clash of two offensive juggernauts on the big stage makes this match-up one of the most exciting fixtures of the week, even before the actual game starts.Both teams are coming to this match with powerful offences and a win behind their backs, which is why the scoring could go either way. The Canucks can score thanks to the extraordinary skills of Elias Pettersson, the experience and stability of Quinn Hughes, the sharpshooting of Brock Boeser, and the less predictable but equally efficient Kiefer Sherwood. Dallas, on the other hand, is well equipped to fight back with a strong offensive trio consisting of Jason Robertson, Mikko Rantanen, and Wyatt Johnston, all of whom have been delivering multi-point performances consistently.ESPN and FOX Sports provide information that there is a tendency for both teams to score a lot of goals regularly. The Dallas team has played nine games out of 20 where the total number of goals scored has been more than 6.5, while the Vancouver team has done it in 15 games, which means the Over is quite possible. The Stars are eighth in goals and converting at the stunning rate of 31.88%. Vancouver is just ahead of the Stars in goals scored at seventh place, but the team’s defensive issues are worrying as they have conceded 77 goals, the most in the league. The forecasts are in favor of a victory for the Stars by 4–3, while Vancouver will not lose by more than 1.5 points, and the total number of goals scored will exceed 6.5.The encounter between the Canucks and Stars on Thursday will certainly be filled with energy, intensity, and many goals, as there will be elite playmakers, powerful power-play units, and momentum-shifting scorers on both sides.Also Read: Will John Tavares play tonight against the Columbus Blue Jackets?

Shaquille O'Neal has people talking to Stephen Curry's people

Stephen Curry's decades long partnership with Under Armour came to an end recently, and since then the free agent on the marketing board has been taking his time to decide on which way to go. He has been wearing classic cleats from different sports apparel brands like Nike and Reebok. And now, we hear some chatter that some talks are ongoing, and he might finally choose one over the other.Curry was with UA for 13 years, almost as long as he has been married to his wife, Ayesha Curry. But now he has decided that partnership has run its course for good, and is looking for a new venture. And who better to rope him in for a new journey than NBA veteran, and Curry's good friend, Shaquille O'Neal. Shaq is a Reebok man, a brand that currently has athletes like Chicago Sky's Angel Reese and Chicago Bulls star Matas Buzelis. Now, it seems like a pretty good possibility that Curry and Reese could share the screen for some good ol' marketing masterclass.Yes, the people are talking to the people backstage, or that's what Shaquille O'Neal says. As people might already know, Shaq is the President of Reebok Basketball, and who better to bring in to boost the brand name, then one of the biggest names when it comes to sports - Golden State Warriors' golden boy, Stephen Curry. After Curry was seen sporting the Reebok Shaqnosis, Shaq himself spoke on the matter saying,""Well, he is a good, personal friend of mine, and I think our people are having conversations with his people, I think...It was a big moment for me, a big moment for the brand. It puts everyone in a 'What's he gonna do?' phase, so I wish him well.""Previously, Curry had said that he wants to try everything at the moment, without making any commitment so soon. He said, ""I'm going to have some fun with this in terms of being open to whatever opportunities are the right fit."" But if a good enough deal comes his way, he would hardly say no to that. And a partnership between Curry and Reebok, brought together by Shaq himself, seems like a pretty good deal.Also Read: Stephen Curry’s wife achieves another milestone with nomination at 2025 Glossy Beauty and Wellness Awards","Shaquille O'Neal has people talking to Stephen Curry's people.

Edmonton Oilers 2025-26 season at risk: Kris Knoblauch demands secondary scoring as Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl face pressure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/edmonton-oilers-2025-26-season-at-risk-kris-knoblauch-demands-secondary-scoring-as-connor-mcdavid-and-leon-draisaitl-face-pressure/articleshow/125469986.cms,"Kris Knoblauch warns Oilers can’t rely on McDavid and Draisaitl alone (Image via: Getty Images)

Kris Knoblauch calls for balanced scoring across the Oilers’ lines



The Edmonton Oilers are facing a critical stretch in the 2025-26 NHL season, and inconsistency is putting their playoff hopes on shaky ground. Superstar duo Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl continue to dominate offensively, but the team’s reliance on just two players has left the Oilers vulnerable. Fans in Edmonton are growing anxious as repeated one-dimensional performances threaten to stall the team’s momentum.Head coach Kris Knoblauch has now sent a clear message to the roster: it’s time for everyone to contribute. The Oilers cannot afford to depend solely on McDavid and Draisaitl, no matter how dominant they are. “We need to have secondary scoring,” Knoblauch said, via NHL.com. “We can’t rely on Connor and Leon or whoever’s playing with them. We need some bottom-six contributions. Tonight we got some of that, which is good. ”For years, Edmonton’s offense has revolved almost entirely around its superstar duo, Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl. While their talent is undeniable, relying solely on them leaves the team vulnerable. Analysts warn that one-dimensional attacks rarely succeed in the playoffs, where defensive schemes are designed to neutralize top players.Kris Knoblauch’s call for secondary scoring is a crucial step toward creating a more balanced and resilient Oilers lineup.The 2025-26 season represents a pivotal moment for Edmonton. Success now depends on contributions from the bottom six, consistent secondary scoring, and improved defensive support. The roster must rise to the challenge, relieve pressure on the superstar duo, and position the Oilers as legitimate contenders. Knoblauch’s message is totally relying on individual brilliance alone will not carry the team through the season.Adding depth beyond Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl has long-term implications for Edmonton’s championship aspirations. Developing reliable secondary scorers not only strengthens playoff prospects but also boosts confidence across all lines. If the supporting cast consistently contributes offensively, the Oilers can diversify their attack, making it harder for opponents to shut down their stars while positioning the team for sustained success in 2025-26 and beyond.Also Read: Canucks forward David Kampf and wife Elisha expecting baby no. 2; Son Michael to become big brother soon","Kris Knoblauch calls for balanced scoring across the Oilers’ lines.
