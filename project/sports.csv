What’s Next for Golden State?

Theface an uncertain future after a challenging playoff run. Stephen Curry is nearing the end of his of his illustrious career and so is Draymond Green. Even though they acquired Jimmy Butler earlier this year, their path to the Western Conference could look bleak given the injuries that these players succumb to. Could a blockbuster move for a Lakers superstar change their fortunes next season?(Disclaimer: The data and analysis in this post are based on conjecture as of right now.Although the information is based on reliable sources, it's crucial to remember that these are not official declarations or verified actions. It is advised that readers use caution when interpreting this analysis and wait for official updates as the offseason progresses.) Sports Illustrated’s Alex Kirschenbaum recently suggested that the Golden State Warriors might pursue Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James this offseason. James, a four-time NBA champion, could provide Golden State with much-needed frontcourt size and experience.Kirschenbaum noted: ""(LeBron) James has long been linked to Golden State, in part because his rivalry against Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Draymond Green (they've played each other in five playoff series, during which James has gone 2-3) eventually blossomed into a bromance.""However, age and injury concerns loom large. A potential lineup featuring James (39), Curry (37), Jimmy Butler (35), and Draymond Green (34) would raise questions about durability.According to Caleb Hightower of the Sporting News 1. Championship Pedigree: James brings unmatched playoff experience and leadership.2. Fit with Curry: Their contrasting skill sets could create an unstoppable offensive duo.3. Lakers’ Struggles: With L.A. failing to advance past the first round, James may seek a new challenge.- Injury Risks: James, Curry, and Butler all dealt with significant injuries this postseason.- Contract Hurdles: James holds a $52.6 million player option, complicating any trade or signing.- Lakers’ Plans: His commitment to playing alongside Luka Dončić could keep him in Los Angeles.If the Warriors exit the playoffs early and seek a roster shakeup, James could emerge as a high-risk, high-reward target. While his arrival would electrify the Bay Area, logistical and financial challenges make this move far from guaranteed.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers predicted to sign $197,230,450 Memphis Grizzlies star to bolster squad around LeBron James and Luka Doncic For now, fans can only speculate—but the idea of LeBron in a Warriors jersey remains a fascinating possibility.","The Golden State Warriors face an uncertain future after a challenging playoff run.

Shedeur Sanders picked off on Day 1, but Browns still see upside in rookie QB



The NFL dream has finally begun for Shedeur Sanders, as the former Colorado standout took the field in Berea, Ohio, for his first rookie minicamp with the Cleveland Browns . While the spotlight was bright and the expectations even brighter, Sanders' NFL debut was a mixture of rough starts and promising flashes.The very first pass Shedeur Sanders threw during team drills didn’t go according to plan.Under pressure from a free rusher, he attempted a play-action pass in the red zone, lofting the ball toward the left sideline—only to have it intercepted by a defender. A forgettable first impression? Perhaps. But for a quarterback known for his 74 percent completion rate in his final college season, this was less about mechanics and more about adjusting to the unforgiving speed of the NFL.Yet, Sanders didn’t let that early mistake define his day.Despite the shaky beginning, Sanders settled in and delivered a performance that revealed why the Browns were willing to bet on him, even after his surprising draft slide to the fifth round at No. 144 overall. Participating in various drills and 7-on-7 sessions, Sanders demonstrated his passing range—from sharp short throws to tight-window touchdowns.Browns insider Brad Stainbrook captured and shared glimpses of Sanders in action, highlighting two touchdown passes during scrimmage plays and several well-placed throws over defenders. Stainbrook later noted that Sanders “looked sharper than Dillon Gabriel,” the other quarterback in the rookie camp, who was selected by the Browns 94th overall.The quarterback competition is already becoming one of the more intriguing storylines of Cleveland’s offseason. Sanders and Gabriel, both entering the league with impressive college résumés, will have every opportunity to climb the depth chart. And while Gabriel got the first reps, Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski made it clear that nothing is set in stone. “I wouldn't look into anything,” Stefanski remarked. “I think you'll see the whole weekend, going through the spring. I mean, we don't pay too close attention to who is in there first.” When asked if the order would change, he simply replied, “I’ll see who.”For Sanders, Friday marked more than just his first practice—it was a statement of intent. Dressed in shorts, a jersey, and helmet—far from full NFL gear—he still managed to showcase glimpses of poise and precision that hint at his potential to grow under center.“This is only the beginning,” Stainbrook wrote. And for Shedeur Sanders, whose college career spanned from Jackson State to the bright lights of Colorado, this beginning may come with challenges—but also a chance to shape his legacy in Cleveland, one pass at a time.Also Read: Despite buzz, Aaron Rodgers not locked in with Steelers; retirement rumors keep gaining steam",Shedeur Sanders made his Cleveland Browns rookie minicamp debut on Friday.

Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma , known for his calm approach and exquisite leadership qualities on the field, surprised many with a strong statement about the idea of natural talent in cricket .Speaking in an interview with senior journalist Vimal Kumar, Rohit dismissed the label of “naturally gifted” in a brutally honest manner.READ ALSO: Rohit Sharma breaks silence on ODI retirement, says 'I will stop when ... ' “Beekar hai (It's useless),” Rohit said when asked about natural talent and leadership.“Nothing comes naturally. To appear effortless takes a lot of effort. People don’t see the hard work behind what looks ‘natural’. Whether it’s being a player or a leader, it all comes from hours of work, not magic. I myself started out as a bowler,” he added.READ ALSO: Rohit Sharma hits back at criticism: 'Defending myself is waste of time' Rohit’s comments shed light on the myth of raw talent in Indian cricket , emphasising that behind every great performance lies immense dedication and preparation, not just innate ability.With 11,168 runs in 273 ODIs and a record highest score of 264, Rohit has proven his value in white-ball cricket. Under his captaincy, India won the 2024 T20 World Cup and the 2025 Champions Trophy, reinforcing his legacy as one of the game’s top leaders.Recently, the 38-year-old called time on his Test career, just weeks before India's five-Test series against England starting June 20. Over 11 years, he played 67 Tests, scoring 4,301 runs with 12 centuries. His top score of 212 came against South Africa in 2019, a turning point in his red-ball journey.Though his early Test years were inconsistent, especially in overseas conditions, Rohit bounced back strongly as an opener in the ICC World Test Championship. With 2,716 runs and nine centuries in the WTC era, he became India’s highest run-getter in the competition.While his Test and T20I journeys are over, Rohit continues to lead India in ODIs, with the same message: greatness isn’t gifted, it’s earned.","Rohit Sharma has dismissed the idea of natural talent in cricket.

India's probable Test squad for England Tour

Former India opener Navjot Singh Sidhu says India will need the experience of Virat Kohli in the upcoming five-match Test series against England, starting June 20, and has requested the star Indian batter to rethink his decision to retire from Test cricket .Ashad reported, Virat Kohli reached out to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and said he wanted to call it a day in the longest format.However, Navjot Singh Sidhu believes Virat Kohli's timing to step away from the red-ball format is not correct.""Virat Kohli’s decision — that he wants to retire — has created a stir across the cricketing world. His intention is right, his motive is noble — that 'the old order must change, yielding place to the new.' But the timing and occasion are not appropriate, because the pride and prestige of India are on the line,"" Sidhu said in video posted on X.""We are heading into a tour that is the toughest litmus test even for other Test-playing nations. Why do I say that Kohli can be our 'knight in shining armor' in England? Because he has the experience, especially after Rohit Sharma's departure. You can’t send an inexperienced side to England,"" he added.Sidhu also cited the example of legendary India cricketer Sunil Gavaskar , who played for India under a high fever in a crucial fixture during the 1987 ODI World Cup.""In the 1987 ODI World Cup, which was my debut tournament, Sunil Gavaskar was down with a high fever. Captain Kapil Dev asked Gavaskar whether he was fit, and the reply came, 'skip 50-50.' Kapil Dev, with a smile on his face, said, 'Sunil Gavaskar at 50 percent is much better than anyone in this world at 100 percent. The same goes for Virat Kohli,"" he said.""He should be India's stop-gap captain for the next six and seven months and lead India from the front,"" he added.If Virat indeed retires, it would mark the end of an illustrious Test career of 14 years, during which he made 9,230 runs in 123 Tests at an average of 46.85, with 30 centuries. He is also India's most successful Test captain ever, having won 40 out of 68 Tests with the armband.","Former India opener Navjot Singh Sidhu says India will need the experience of Virat Kohli in the upcoming five-match Test series against England.

India's probable Test squad for England Tour

Shami's Test future in doubt

Virat Kohli has not yet clarified to the Indian cricket board (BCCI) whether he is amenable to touring England for the upcoming five-Test series, after having communicated his wish to call time on a stellar red-ball career.has learnt that Kohli, after having received a request from the board to reconsider his decision — in the wake of Rohit Sharma also retiring from the format ahead of what will be a crucial series — has not backed down from his stand.Sources, however, said the BCCI and the selection committee are still trying to convince him to tour and shore up India’s inexperienced middle-order on such an important tour.“Kohli had informed the selectors two weeks ago (about his desire to quit Tests). They were trying to persuade him to play in the Test series against England. However, he is still firm on his stance. The final call will come close to the selection meeting next week,” sources said.Kohli has had a stellar Test career but has struggled in the format in recent times. In Australia late last year, the repetitive manner of his dismissals — caught fishing outside off stump — even raised questions about whether he still deserved a permanent place in the side.Despite his recent struggles and prolonged dip in form, the selectors are keen that he be present in India’s squad in England to lend experience to a new-look team in which Shubman Gill has emerged as the likely frontrunner for the captain’s post.Kohli’s unavailability, if it comes to pass, could present a new headache for the selectors regarding his replacement at No. 4 in the batting order. If Kohli doesn’t budge, the selectors may be forced to look at either Shreyas Iyer or Karun Nair as likely replacements.Meanwhile, Rajat Patidar has emerged as a strong contender to replace Sarfaraz Khan in the squad.The selectors may be forced to take a tough call on veteran pacer Mohammed Shami. TOI has learnt that there are serious concerns about Shami’s form and fitness and his ability to endure the rigours of Test cricket following a long injury-enforced layoff. India’s frontline pace lineup is looking shaky, with workload concerns surrounding Jasprit Bumrah adding to the worries.“As of now, Shami isn’t an automatic pick. It’s been months since he has come back to international cricket but he has barely been in rhythm. While IPL performances are not usually considered while picking India teams, Shami is struggling to finish his run-up and the ball is not carrying to the wicketkeeper like it used to before his Achilles tendon injury after the 2023 ODI World Cup. He invariably goes back to the dressing room after a short spell for recovery,” BCCI sources said.The selectors, it is understood, are expecting to get Bumrah’s services on the tour for two or three Tests only. In such a scenario, they were pinning their hopes on 35-year-old Shami to perform. “The initial plan was to ensure the team can at least play either of Shami or Bumrah in every Test. However, if Bumrah is rested for a match and Shami struggles to pull through, it will be a big issue. They are trying to understand the problem Shami may be facing,” sources said.Selectors are also concerned about Mohammed Siraj not being able to step up as lead pacer in Bumrah or Shami’s absence. The England tour could also be a makeor-break one for him.There are also talks about choosing between left-arm pacers Arshdeep Singh, Khaleel Ahmed and Yash Dayal. While Arshdeep has shown his potential to swing the ball both ways, it’s his lack of first-class experience that could pose a problem.","Virat Kohli has not yet clarified to the Indian cricket board whether he is amenable to touring England for the upcoming five-Test series.

Why Travis Hunter’s actions on a flight have fans cracking up and going wild online



The Jacksonville Jaguars ' latest draft sensation, Travis Hunter , is already making headlines—and not just for what he does with a football. Drafted second overall in the 2025 NFL Draft, Hunter’s athletic skills have been widely praised, but a recent encounter on a commercial flight has shown that his character off the field is just as impressive as his performance on it.Travis Hunter, the dynamic two-way player out of the University of Colorado, is currently turning heads at the Jaguars’ rookie minicamp.But it was a moment in mid-air, far from the roar of stadium crowds, that made just as big an impact. A woman named Sandy Hawkins Combs shared a heartfelt story on Facebook after sitting next to Hunter during a flight from Denver—a post that has since gone viral for all the right reasons.“I had the most wonderful flight home from Denver,” she began. “I met the nicest young man who sat next to me. He offered to put my bag in the overhead compartment and helped me with my tray. He was always polite, saying ‘yes ma’am’ or ‘no ma’am.’ Anyone would be proud to have him as a son or grandson—so polite.”At first, Combs had no idea she was sitting beside an NFL star. But as other passengers walked by offering congratulations and snapping photos, her curiosity grew. “I turned and asked him, ‘Who am I sitting next to?’ I looked at his Jaguar pants, smiled, and asked, ‘Are you an athlete?’ He smiled and said, ‘I’m Travis. Yes, I was drafted by the Jags.’ I already told my sons I want his jersey.”That brief exchange says a lot about Hunter—not just his humility, but his grounded nature despite being on the cusp of NFL stardom. “He’s so humble and down-to-earth—I would have never guessed he was a professional athlete,” she added. “JACKSONVILLE JAGS, you did good! I will be buying tickets. United Airlines , thank you for my seat assignment!”This kind of organic, fan-first connection is rare in a time when athletes often seem distant behind brands and sponsorships. For Hunter, who also carried an impressive GPA of 3.7 or 3.9 during his college years, the moment revealed a level of maturity and kindness that mirrors his discipline on the gridiron.While the Jaguars are expecting big things from him on the field, Hunter's ability to leave such a lasting impression off the field proves he's more than just a top pick—he's a role model. And now, thanks to a simple act of kindness on a routine flight, the rookie cornerback has gained more than a new fan in Combs—he’s captured the admiration of football fans everywhere.As the NFL season approaches, it’s safe to say that Travis Hunter won’t just be one of the easiest players to cheer for—he might just be one of the most beloved.Also Read: Bill Belichick seen front row for girlfriend Jordon Hudson’s swimsuit round at Miss Maine USA",Travis Hunter was drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars second overall in the 2025 NFL Draft.

Fans erupt in praise, calling Pat McAfee a warrior in defeat

In a moment few saw coming, former NFL punter and current ESPN analyst Pat McAfee stepped out from behind the desk and into the ring at WWE Backlash in St. Louis. Facing off against Gunther—one of WWE's most dominant and feared superstars—McAfee entered the bout not just as an underdog, but as a wild card in a match that quickly became the talk of the night.While the match ended with Pat McAfee unconscious in a devastating sleeper hold, it was his refusal to tap out that truly stole the show.The crowd roared, and social media lit up. McAfee later posted, “Never tapped aht. #WWEBacklash,” a statement that felt like both a badge of honor and a subtle shot at Gunther, who himself had tapped out to Jey Uso not long ago. The implication? McAfee may have lost, but he didn’t give in.The WWE Universe didn’t just watch; they felt the match. One fan summed it up: “Pat McAfee is one BAD— MO———-!!! Stood up to Gunther and got back on his own two feet.” Another added, “Falling asleep, but in a way gaining respect in defeat.” That sentiment echoed across platforms—McAfee may have fallen, but he fell with fire.His backstage hug with Michael Cole, the emotional ovation from the crowd, and his battered Instagram story all underscored that this wasn’t just a one-off stunt. It was a passion play, an ode to standing up even when the odds—and Gunther’s forearms—are against you.From NFL standout to charismatic commentator to fearless in-ring fighter, McAfee’s trajectory mirrors a Marvel-level transformation. Think Captain America outmatched but never outwilled. Think Iron Man standing tall without the suit. And when fans say, “Pat McAfee should get more matches in the future,” it’s not just hype—it’s a demand.Also Read: Shedeur Sanders shares how Tom Brady’s draft history mirrors his own NFL slide, says ""My story is going to be similar"" As for what’s next?

Tyreek Hill mocks iShowSpeed and takes aim at Noah Lyles

The Noah Lyles rivalry escalates from social media banter to track reality

Tyreek Hill isn’t just known for his game-breaking speed on the football field—he’s also gaining attention for his growing list of rivals off it. After publicly taunting both internet sensation Darren “iShowSpeed” Watkins Jr. and Olympic sprint champion Noah Lyles , the Miami Dolphins wide receiver has sparked a flurry of buzz in the world of sports entertainment and track competition.It all started with Tyreek Hill’s $100,000 race challenge to iShowSpeed, which was set up to benefit his foundation if he won. Speed, who once ran against Noah Lyles himself, took the offer seriously and even showed up at the Dolphins’ training camp. “If you beat me, I won’t say anything. You got it, what I’m saying?” he told Hill in person. But instead of racing, Hill ran off, prompting a stunned Speed to laugh and declare, “He’s scared!”Hill later doubled down in a separate interview, flipping the narrative by saying, “He’s scared. Speed’s scared.” The moment quickly went viral, especially after a clip surfaced showing Hill avoiding the race when Speed showed up ready.While his beef with Speed has comedic undertones, the challenge against Noah Lyles is much more serious. Lyles, who previously mocked Hill by holding up a sign reading “Tyreek could never” after winning the 60m at the New Balance Indoor Grand Prix, fired a competitive shot that went straight to Hill’s pride. Hill clapped back on X, saying, “Get a load of this guy,” setting the stage for a potential 60-meter clash between NFL explosiveness and Olympic precision.Fans are now clamoring for two high-profile races: one against the $10M YouTuber and the other against a world-class sprinter. While iShowSpeed may lack elite times—reportedly running just 11 mph—his charisma and fearlessness have made the challenge fun. Lyles, on the other hand, represents a real athletic test that could humble even the fastest NFL star.Also Read: Why Derek Carr’s sudden retirement could shake up the Saints' future—for the better With both matchups buzzing online, all eyes are on Hill.

Hours after TimesofIndia.com reported that star India batter Virat Kohli has reached out to the Board of Control for Cricket in India BCCI ) and said he wanted to call it a day in the longest format, the X handle of County Championship took a shot at the Indian legend, indicating that he is afraid of facing the England quicks in the upcoming five-match Test series, starting from June 20.In a ten second video posted on the X by the County Championship, the England speedster Gus Atkinson and Josh Tongue can be seen shattering the stumps in the ongoing four-day tournament in England.The post was quoted with the comment ""We don't blame you Virat.""In Border-Gavaskar Trophy held earlier this year, Virat Kohli could manage only 190 runs in nine innings and 100 of those came in a single knock at Perth.Down Under, the right-hander struggled after the early high and was nowhere close to the high standards he had set in that part of the world.It is worth noting that Kohli expressed desire to lead the side again but it wasn't entertained by the BCCI as they had an eye on the future, and wanted to groom a young leader for the new World Test Championship cycle.""As TimesofIndia.com had reported, Shubman Gill was earmarked as the leader for the future as the Indian cricket board didn't want to look back as far as captaincy is concerned.Kohli, who made his Test debut in 2011, has represented India in 123 Tests, scoring 9230 runs at an average of 46.85.He also led India in 68 Tests, making him the country's most successful captain in the format. His intensity, fitness, and leadership transformed India into a dominant Test side both at home and overseas.With Rohit Sharma having recently retired from Test cricket, Kohli’s exit would leave the team without its two most experienced batters.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Shikhar Dhawan unleashed a blistering response to Pakistan’s ceasefire violation just hours after a mutual truce was agreed upon.On Sunday, May 10, at around 8 PM, Pakistan reportedly launched multiple drone attacks targeting key Indian regions such as Srinagar and Kutch, barely three hours into the ceasefire.The truce, which was announced jointly by India’s Ministry of External Affairs and US President Donald Trump, was intended to pause escalating tensions.However, Pakistan's latest provocation has drawn condemnation from both officials and public figures across India.Taking to social media platform X, Shikhar Dhawan expressed his outrage in no uncertain terms.“Ghatiya desh ne fir apna ghatiyapan poori duniya ke aage dikha diya (The filthy nation has once again shown its filthiness to the whole world),” he posted, calling out Pakistan for once again showing its ""true colours.""His sentiment echoed the growing frustration among Indian citizens who see Pakistan's repeated breaches as deliberate and deceitful.Dhawan wasn’t alone. Virender Sehwag, Yuzvendra Chahal, and Rahul Tewatia also criticised Pakistan’s duplicity, with Sehwag sharing a stinging Hindi proverb that likened Pakistan’s actions to something inherently incorrigible.The implications of this breach have spilled into the sporting world as well.

‘Bombs Are Coming’: India-Pak Aerial Clash Sparks Panic During IPL; Chilling Video from Dharamsala

The Board of Control for Cricket in India has suspended the Indian Premier League , with 16 games remaining, due to escalating conflict between India and Pakistan, and England has emerged as a potential host for the final stages of the tournament. The BCCI will prioritise hosting the remaining matches in India if security concerns are resolved, but the England and Wales Cricket Board is open to discussions about hosting if approached.ECB chief executive Richard Gould confirmed England would be willing to step in if needed.“We will help our counterparts at the BCCI where we can,” he was quoted as saying by English media outlet Mail Online.The initial postponement is for a week , following consultations with the 10 franchises who expressed concerns about player safety, broadcaster views, and fan sentiments.Former England captain Michael Vaughan suggested completing the IPL in the UK before India's Test series against England begins on June 20.""I wonder if it's possible to finish the IPL in the UK,"" Vaughan wrote on X. ""We have all the venues and the Indian players can then stay on for the Test series… Just a thought?""The timing of the remaining matches presents a significant challenge. Hosting the tournament before India's Test tour would require quick agreements between the BCCI, ECB, and English venues, complicated by ongoing domestic cricket schedules.Another possibility is rescheduling IPL games for September during the Asia Cup window , which is unlikely to proceed.England's schedule includes South Africa white-ball series from September 2 to 14, suggesting the IPL could potentially resume in England afterward, utilising grounds not needed for the County Championship.A potential clash with England's three-match T20 tour of Ireland from September 17-21 is considered less problematic.Devajit Saikia, the BCCI's honorary secretary, confirmed the decision to suspended the league was made after consultation with franchises who ""conveyed the concern and sentiments of their players, and also the views of the broadcaster, sponsors and fans.""The BCCI released a strong statement of national solidarity: ""At this critical juncture, the BCCI stands firmly with the nation. We express our solidarity with the government of India, the armed forces and the people of our country. The Board salutes the bravery, courage, and selfless service of our armed forces, whose heroic efforts under Operation Sindoor continue to protect and inspire the nation, as they lead a resolute response to the recent terrorist attack and the unwarranted aggression by Pakistan's armed forces.""The statement continued: ""While cricket remains a national passion, there is nothing greater than the nation and its sovereignty, integrity, and security of our country. The BCCI remains firmly committed to support all efforts that safeguard India and will always align its decisions in the best interest of the nation.""",The Indian Premier League has been suspended due to security concerns.

Donovan Mitchell injury update: MRI scheduled Monday



The Cleveland Cavaliers find themselves in serious trouble, both on the scoreboard and on the injury report, following a lopsided 129-109 defeat to the Indiana Pacers in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals. The loss pushed the Cavs into a 3-1 hole, but with that, the team came at a cost of losing their top performer, Donovan Mitchell , to a left ankle injury that forced him to sit out the entire second half.Donovan Mitchell’s injury could not have come at a worse time. After averaging an incredible 41.3 points per game through the first three games of the series, his scoring punch was Cleveland’s only consistent weapon. But during the final minutes of the first half on Sunday, the 28-year-old appeared visibly uncomfortable. He was seen gingerly walking into the locker room at halftime due to discomfort in his left ankle. Despite attempting some warm-up shots, he did not return to the floor or even the bench for the second half. The Cavaliers later confirmed he had suffered a left ankle injury.Postgame, Cavs head coach Kenny Atkinson offered no clarity, saying only that Mitchell would undergo an MRI on Monday and that he had ""no idea"" about his availability for Game 5. The uncertainty hanging over Mitchell’s status has left fans and analysts speculating about whether Cleveland has enough left in the tank to mount a comeback without him.It was a brutal night overall for the Cavaliers. They were down 80-39 at halftime — a deficit that tied the record for the largest halftime gap in NBA playoff history. The Pacers executed a dominant performance from start to finish, shooting 52.7% from the field and scoring 35 points off 22 Cleveland turnovers.To make matters worse, tension boiled over early in the game. Pacers guard Bennedict Mathurin was ejected after throwing a punch to the chest of Cavs swingman De’Andre Hunter, who retaliated by shoving Mathurin to the ground. That skirmish may have been Cleveland’s only sign of fight in an otherwise lethargic showing.Mitchell finished with just 12 points on 3-of-11 shooting before exiting. Darius Garland led the Cavs with 21 points and six assists, but it wasn’t nearly enough. Ty Jerome took over for Mitchell in the second half, but Cleveland never got close, trailing by as many as 44.Now, if Mitchell stays out, the Cavaliers must win three straight games without him, including one on the road in Indiana, just to advance.Also Read: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Indiana Pacers (05/11): Box score, player stats, game summary and more Mitchell’s health is uncertain, and with a roster already plagued by other injuries, the Cavs' season is hanging by a thread.

NEW DELHI: In a truly unique moment during the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier 2025 in Bangkok, the UAE women’s cricket team made headlines by retiring all ten of their batters in one of the strangest scorecards in T20 history.Playing against Qatar at the Terdthai Cricket Ground , UAE openers Esha Oza and Theertha Satish put on a stunning show, adding 192 runs for the first wicket in just 16 overs.Oza smashed a sensational 113 off 55 balls, while Satish contributed a rapid 74 off 42. But what happened next stunned everyone. Every other UAE batter retired out at the start of the 17th over.Ten players walked off without facing a single delivery. The reason? Rain was approaching.Coach Ahmed Raza explained that with the weather worsening, he approached the match officials. “I went to the umpires and checked whether we could declare but in white-ball cricket you can not declare,” he said. “I then asked the match referee if I could retire my whole team out.”The strategy worked. UAE bowled out Qatar for just 29 runs in 11.1 overs, sealing a massive 163-run win and boosting their net run rate in the process.Despite the unusual method, Raza clarified that everything was within the rules and done with transparency. “By doing this I meant no disrespect to anyone involved, our opposition. Everything that happened was within the laws and was well communicated with the match referee,” he added.While the 10 retire-outs stole the spotlight, the UAE’s dominating all-round performance — from Oza’s century to Michelle Botha’s 3/11 — showed their strong intent in the tournament.This win marked UAE’s second straight victory and put them in prime position to advance to the Super Three stage of the qualifiers. And despite the headlines, Raza reminded everyone: “This extraordinary series of events should not overshadow our captain's hundred and our opening stand of 192 and our bowlers doing the remaining job.”","The UAE women's cricket team made headlines by retiring all ten of their batters in one of the strangest scorecards in T20 history.

During the third unofficial One Day International between Bangladesh A and New Zealand A , Bangladesh wicket-keeper and captain Nurul Hasan faced an embarrassing moment when his unconventional positioning behind the stumps led to the ball hitting the protective helmet, resulting in a five-run penalty on Saturday.The incident occurred in the fifth over of New Zealand A's innings while chasing 228 runs.With the score at 35-0, Ebadot Hossain bowled a straight delivery to Rhys Mairu, which the batter left alone. Nurul, positioned closer to first slip rather than in the traditional wicket-keeper's spot, failed to collect the ball as it struck the helmet and rolled towards short third man.Both Nurul and the batters appeared confused by the situation. Phillips and Mairu eventually took a single, with the umpire awarding an additional five runs as penalty.According to rule 28.3.2 of Marylebone Cricket Club's cricket laws: ""If the ball while in play strikes the protective helmet the ball shall immediately become dead and he umpire shall signal No ball or Wide to the scorers, if applicable or umpire shall award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side.""New Zealand A successfully chased down the target of 228 runs in the 48th over, with Dean Foxcroft guiding the team to victory.Nurul Hasan, 31, brings significant experience to the game with 157 List-A matches, 214 T20s, and 109 First-Class appearances.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

A 5.7-magnitude earthquake struck Pakistan on Saturday morning, Reuters reported. The tremor occurred just hours after a 4.0-magnitude quake had hit the region.Shallow earthquakes tend to be more dangerous than deeper ones because their seismic waves have a shorter distance to travel to the Earth's surface. This results in stronger ground shaking, increasing the potential for structural damage and higher casualties.Pakistan is among the most seismically active countries in the world due to its position along the boundary between the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. The ongoing collision between these plates generates frequent and often destructive seismic activity.Several major fault lines run through the country, further heightening its vulnerability. The provinces of Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, and the former FATA lie on the southern edge of the Eurasian Plate, while Sindh, Punjab, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir sit on the north-western edge of the Indian Plate.",Shallow earthquakes tend to be more dangerous than deeper ones because their seismic waves have a shorter distance to travel to the Earth's surface.

What’s the tile game Meghan Markle played on Netflix? A beginner’s guide to mahjong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/whats-the-tile-game-meghan-markle-played-on-netflix-a-beginners-guide-to-mahjong/articleshow/120736644.cms,"Meghan Markle played the game of Mahjong in her Netflix series

From the Qing dynasty to pop culture

How is mahjong played?

Connor Wan, a 29-year-old British-Chinese artist, learned mahjong while visiting family in Hong Kong. He enjoyed it so much that he started the Four Winds Mahjong Club in London, and later brought it to Toronto after moving there in 2024. “Moving countries is hard, especially when you don’t know anyone,” he said. The club became popular quickly, not as a place for gambling, but for making friends and celebrating Asian culture. Nicole Wong, a writer and audio producer from California, started playing mahjong as a teenager with her grandparents. She later began The Mahjong Project in 2019 to share the game’s cultural stories and organise pop-up game nights. This year, she published a book called Mahjong: House Rules from Across the Asian Diaspora. Nicole says the sound of the tiles is especially powerful. “Mahjong is more than just fun,” she says. “It has a deep history and brings back strong memories.” In Toronto, Robyn Feldberg has taught over 250 people how to play mahjong through her courses. She donates all the money—about $50,000 so far—to charities like Save A Child’s Heart. She says the game is especially popular with young mothers who want a fun way to relax and connect with others. “They tell me, ‘We want something that’s just for us,’” she said.

A centuries-old Chinese game called mahjong is having a modern revival across continents, from luxury cruise ships and trendy hotel lounges to Meghan Markle’s Netflix series.In the sixth episode of her docuseries With Love, the Duchess of Sussex invites friends for a cosy game night – playing mahjong, reports the Globe and Mail.The four-person tile-based game, traditionally associated with Chinese culture, is now catching on with new generations across the globe. “The game itself is really so fun,” says Markle. “But what was so great was the idea of learning something new with your friends, together... the mahjong becomes the background of the expansion of friendship. It’s the feeling of community.”Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China. Traditionally played with 144 tiles, the game blends skill, strategy and a touch of luck. Players pick and discard tiles to form winning hands, much like the card game rummy.The game’s expansion across the world has now erupted into a full-blown trend. The World Mahjong Championship was recently held in Mississauga, Ontario – the first time it’s been hosted in North America. Hotels such as the Ace Hotel New York and Thompson Hotel Dallas regularly hold mahjong-themed nights.Fans with money to spare are buying fancy mahjong sets from Hermès, Louis Vuitton, and Ralph Lauren. Some are even splashing out on luxury tables that shuffle the tiles automatically – costing over $4,500.Even cruise ships have joined the trend, offering mahjong tournaments and special rooms just for playing the game.Mahjong is played with 144 tiles. Players begin by shuffling the tiles face down. Everyone rolls dice and the highest roller becomes the dealer. Each player picks 36 tiles and builds a wall—two rows of 18 tiles. The walls are pushed forward, creating a space in the middle for discards. Each player then draws 13 tiles (the dealer starts with 14), and the game begins.Players take turns drawing one tile and discarding one, always keeping 13 tiles in hand. You can draw a new tile or pick up someone’s discarded one. If a discarded tile helps complete a set (called a meld), you can grab it, announce the set, and show the tiles. To win, a player must have four melds (like three or four matching tiles or a sequence of three in a suit) and one pair (two matching tiles)—making 14 tiles total.There are five types of tiles: Bamboo, Characters, Dots (these are the three main suits), and special tiles called Honors (Dragons and Winds) and Bonus (Flowers and Seasons). Each suit goes from 1 to 9. Honors and Bonus tiles add extra excitement but aren't needed to win. Mahjong mixes strategy and memory with a bit of luck—and it’s all about building the right sets before your opponents do.For many mahjong fans, it’s not just a game but a deeply social experience.","Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China.

LONDON: Over 30 years after Britain's elite Magic Circle expelled a woman for posing as a man to gain admittance, the formerly male-only society is to welcome her back as a full member.The London-based international magic organisation ejected Sophie Lloyd after she masqueraded as a male in 1991 to win membership.But after her story came to light last year, the society's first female chair Laura London launched a search to track down Lloyd and apologise.She was eventually located living abroad and will later on Thursday be presented with a membership certificate at a special ceremony at the organisation's London headquarters.""It is so exciting after all these months tracking Sophie... I can't tell you how happy we are as a society to welcome her back into the fold,"" London told BBC radio.Lloyd posed as Raymond Lloyd for 18 months before unmasking herself as a woman.But members, who voted to admit women in September 1991, were so angered by her ""deliberate deception"" that they went ahead with her expulsion.The deception was in fact a two-person act involving the late magician Jenny Winstanley, who recruited Lloyd to help her prove that women magicians were just as good as men.""I did a 20-minute show in front of 200 people, three examiners, and spoke to the examiner for an hour-and-three-quarters afterwards,"" Lloyd said, recalling how she managed to pull the wool over everyone's eyes.After the Magic Circle changed its stance on allowing women in, Winstanley, who died in 2004, phoned the society to explain.""Two days later we got a letter to say Raymond's been expelled,"" said Lloyd.""We couldn't get our heads round it. We just thought, 'come on it's funny, it's amusing' but they didn't think so and Jenny was completely snubbed, unfortunately.""After the expulsion, Lloyd continued to perform magic for 11 years in an anti-bullying variety show before eventually moving overseas.She said the Magic Circle had changed out of all recognition in the 30 years since she was thrown out, adding: ""This is for Jenny really, Jenny would have loved it.""London said Thursday's ceremony would also be a chance to recognise Winstanley both for her contribution to magic and her audacious trick at the Magic Circle's expense.""I just think she's a wonderful woman and I know she'd have loved to be here and I just wish more than anything I could have met her myself,"" she said.The Magic Circle was founded in 1905 by around 20 magicians at a restaurant in London's Chinatown district.Members must vow never to give away the secrets of magic.Although women have now been admitted to the Magic Circle for over 30 years, they still make up only around five percent of the society's 1,700 membership.The body says, however, that increasing numbers are now coming through in the 10-18-year-old age group.","Sophie Lloyd was expelled from the Magic Circle after posing as a man to gain admittance.

NEW DELHI: India’s white-ball captain Rohit Sharma has finally addressed questions surrounding his future in One Day Internationals (ODIs). In a candid conversation with senior journalist Vimal Kumar, Rohit made it clear that while he’s not done just yet, he’s very aware of when to walk away.The veteran opener emphasised his evolved approach to batting, saying, ""I used to play the way I used to, I took my time.Earlier, I would play 30 balls in the first 10 overs and be at just 10 runs. But if I play 20 balls now, why can't I score 30, 35, or even 40 runs? And on the days when I get going, hitting the accelerator, scoring 80 runs in the first 10 overs isn't bad at all.

Barring former England captain Jos Buttler and South Africa's speedster Gerald Coetzee, all the overseas players stayed back.""Our entire squad stuck around. Only Jos and Gerald, but they will come back as required,"" said the official.GT have looked like one of the favorites to win the title.

NEW DELHI: Former England skipper Michael Vaughan has stirred discussion by backing Virat Kohli to lead India in the upcoming five-match Test series against England, starting June 20.Taking to social media platform X, Vaughan posted, ""If I was India I would give the captaincy to Virat for the Test series in England .. Shubman Gill can be his VC for the tour ..""Kohli, who stepped down from Test captaincy during the South Africa tour in 2021–22, has remained a central figure in India’s Test setup, even as he has refrained from leadership duties.According to a recent TimesofIndia.com report, the veteran batter has expressed a desire to retire from Test cricket and has communicated the same to the BCCI , raising questions about his long-term future in the format.Nevertheless, Vaughan’s endorsement reflects the belief in Kohli’s unmatched leadership pedigree, especially in challenging overseas conditions like England. Kohli is India’s most successful Test captain, with 40 wins in 68 matches. He has led India to memorable overseas wins and helped build one of the most aggressive and fit Test units.With 9230 runs from 123 Tests, including 30 centuries, Kohli continues to be a key figure in India’s red-ball ambitions. The idea of pairing him with young talent like Shubman Gill, as Vaughan suggests, could offer a transitional bridge for India as they prepare for a new leadership era in Tests.","Former England skipper Michael Vaughan has backed Virat Kohli to lead India in the upcoming five-match Test series against England.

Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

Rohit Sharma’s last press conference as a captain

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma ’s decision to step away from Test cricket has sparked widespread debate, and former cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar didn’t hold back when weighing in.Taking to his official ‘X’ handle, Manjrekar pointed to Rohit’s recent slump and waning fitness as key reasons why the decision made sense.“164 in his last 15 innings. Out of which 10 were at home v Bangladesh & NZ.Average 10.9. With his current fitness levels… Rohit Sharma’s days as Test opener were over. So…” Manjrekar posted, summarising his view with stark clarity.Rohit, 38, officially announced his Test retirement on Wednesday via Instagram. In a brief but heartfelt note, he wrote, “It’s been an absolute honour to represent my country in whites. Thank you for all the love and support over the years.”His exit comes at a time when his place in the Test squad was under scrutiny. With a five-match Test series against England looming and reports of potential leadership changes within the BCCI, the timing of his decision seemed inevitable.While Rohit bows out from the longest format, he remains committed to white-ball cricket. After leading India to T20 World Cup glory in 2024 and retiring from the format, he confirmed that he will continue playing ODIs.Despite finishing with an impressive Test career tally of 4,301 runs, 12 centuries, and a highest score of 212, his recent form had noticeably dipped.In his final nine matches, Rohit averaged just 10.93 and even dropped himself during the Sydney Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.Away from the pitch, Rohit also took aim at the current state of cricket commentary in India, calling it “disappointing” in a candid interview.ALSO READ: 'It is very disappointing': Rohit Sharma not happy with Indian commentary standards He criticised the shift in focus from the game to sensationalism, highlighting a growing disconnect between the media and cricket itself.As he moves on from the whites, Rohit’s legacy—especially in white-ball formats—remains firmly intact.",Rohit Sharma announced his Test retirement on Wednesday.
