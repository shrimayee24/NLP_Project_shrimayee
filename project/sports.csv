Malaysian diaspora gears up for tryst with PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/malaysian-diaspora-gears-up-for-tryst-with-pm-modi/articleshow/127813769.cms,"PM Modi

KUALA LUMPUR: The stage is set for PM Narendra Modi to once again showcase India’s soft power on the global stage. This time round it’s Malaysia, on Feb 7, as thousands of Indian diaspora members will be waiting to see and hear Modi.Adding to the excitement is the murmur of Malaysia’s prime minister Anwar Ibrahim joining Modi at the event. For Anwar, the Thaipusam festival which is largely an occasion to assert Indians’ cultural and political identity, Modi’s visit, and address to the Indian diaspora, could all blend together to provide some sort of firm ground in changing electoral scenarios.Further, with Chinese New Year celebrations also round the corner, and the Dragon Dance as one of the elements of the cultural extravaganza, the opportunity for affirming India’s image as the unifier in the Global South is huge.Around 15,000 Indians, including ‘Malay Indians’ as PM Modi had referred to them in his last community address in 2015, and expatriates, will gather at MINES International Exhibition & Convention Centre (MIECC) in Kuala Lumpur to listen to Modi. More than 60 Indian community organizations and NGOs in Malaysia have come together to form the `Selamatdatangmodiji’ event.Talking to TOI, Nabhesh Khanna, director of MI Cultural Events, which is supervising the event, said, “The event has been conceptualised in such a way that it will highlight the unity and diversity of Indians and Malaysians; reminding that our bonds transcend boundaries and are rooted in everyday culture, lives.”Malaysia Hindu Dharma Maamandram, a Hindu NGO with 40 branches across Malaysia, has reached out to various temples in the country for participating in the grand event. Rishi Kumar Vadivelu, head of the NGO said, “Modiji has brought our culture, tradition, our roots, in the international arena. He has been promoting Thiruvalluvar, the great philosopher.”Pradip Batra, head of OFBJP in Malaysia, said, “The excitement is huge. Senior BJP functionaries have already reached here for preparations and everyone is working to make this event a grand success.”","Around 15,000 Indians, including ‘Malay Indians’ as PM Modi had referred to them in his last community address in 2015, will gather at MINES International Exhibition & Convention Centre (MIECC) in Kuala Lumpur.

The penguin walked away quietly. But what was it trying to say?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-penguin-walked-away-quietly-but-what-was-it-trying-to-say/articleshow/127803414.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. The internet loves noise, but this time it fell in love with silence. A short video went viral: a lone penguin walking away from its colony, not toward the sea, not toward its companions, but straight toward the frozen mountains of Antarctica. No drama. Just a steady, deliberate walk into white nothingness. Memes followed, as they always do. Even the White House posted one where the American President escorts the penguin to Greenland. Social media crowned it the nihilist penguin . Laughter spread, but beneath it lay recognition. This penguin wasn’t protesting. It wasn’t rebelling. It wasn’t asking to be saved. It was simply walking away. And that quiet exit felt deeply familiar, especially to Gen Z—a generation tired of performing happiness, exhausted by constant comparison, crushed by the pressure to prove that life is “working out”. Somewhere inside, many whispered the same thought the penguin seemed to carry: Enough is enough. What many forgot — or never knew — was that this was not a new moment. The footage came from a 2007 documentary by Werner Herzog , titled ‘Encounters at the end of the world’. At the time, the scene passed quietly, almost uneasily, without commentary or conclusion. It was neither analysed nor celebrated. The internet was not yet ready for it. Two decades later, in an age of burnout and quiet quitting, the clip resurfaced and suddenly felt uncannily current, as though the penguin had been walking all this time to meet us here. From a Western philosophical lens, the label came easily: nihilism. The word itself comes from nihil , Latin for nothing. Nihilism argues that life has no inherent meaning, no objective values, and no moral truths beyond human invention. It emerged in modern Western thought, especially in the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche, who saw it as a dangerous vacuum left by the collapse of religion and tradition. For Nietzsche, nihilism was a crisis, not a destination. Closely allied is existentialism, articulated by thinkers such as Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus and Simone de Beauvoir. Existentialism claims that humans are not born with purpose; we exist first and define ourselves later through choice. Meaning is not given; it is made. Everyone saw the solitary walk of the penguin to be in synchronisation with western philosophical ideas that inherently indicated purposelessness. But here is where the Eastern lens gently interrupts the Western conclusion. Indian philosophy talks about renunciation. At first glance, nihilism and renunciation seem similar. But nihilism often carries a bleak tone, disillusionment after belief collapses. Renunciation, or vairāgya , begins not in emptiness but in insight. The world is not denied; it is understood as transient. Suffering does not arise from existence itself, but from clinging. The renunciate does not walk away in despair, but in clarity. There is freedom here, not apathy; compassion, not cynicism. Thiruvalluvar captures this radical lightness with stunning economy. In Kural 345, from the chapter on renunciation, he writes: Matrum thodarpaadu evankol pirapparukkal Utraarkku udambum migai. “For those who have renounced, even the body itself is a burden; what more could they desire?” This is where the penguin begins to look different. Perhaps it is not rejecting life. Maybe it is stepping out of the noise. Perhaps it is not a nihilist at all, but an accidental symbol of letting go.","The classic Tamil text 'Thirukkural' is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality.

Sanju Samson headache for Team India | Is Ishan Kishan the right choice?

Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has softened his earlier stance on calling for a boycott of the upcoming T20 World Cup, admitting that the moment for such a move has passed. While ruling out a full withdrawal, the former wicketkeeper-batsman floated a different form of protest, suggesting Pakistan could take part in the tournament but decline to play fixtures against India. He stressed, however, that any such call would have to come from the Pakistani government rather than the cricket board.“If the government says we won’t play against India, the ICC will have to accept it,” Latif said. “If they don’t, that’s where the real confrontation begins.” Asked what would happen if India and Pakistan met in the final, Latif replied, “nahi khelenge’ (we won’t play)”.Latif, who had earlier urged Pakistan to boycott the World Cup to challenge what he described as India’s influence over global cricket administration, said on Wednesday that the opportunity slipped away when the Pakistan Cricket Board did not act immediately after Bangladesh were excluded from the event.“The time for a strike has passed,” Latif said on the YouTube channel CaughtBehind. “Every decision has a timing. When the iron is hot, that’s when you strike. That time was last week during the ICC meeting.”Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland after 14 votes went against their participation, with the ICC citing logistical and contractual issues. Pakistan backed Bangladesh in the vote but eventually went along with the final decision.“We showed our support. We voted for them. That chapter is over,” Latif said. “If we boycott now, it won’t have the same impact.”Pakistan chairman Mohsin Naqvi had hinted earlier this week that the board could consider a principled stand similar to Bangladesh’s, but no formal announcement followed. The T20 World Cup will go ahead with Pakistan participating under a hybrid model, with matches involving India scheduled at neutral venues until 2027.",Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has softened his earlier stance on calling for a boycott of the upcoming T20 World Cup.

Sunetra seen as ideal choice as she could provide a smooth transition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sunetra-seen-as-ideal-choice-as-she-could-provide-a-smooth-transition/articleshow/127810162.cms,".

Sunetra Pawar To Be Named NCP Leader, Dy CM Oath Likely Tomorrow: Chhagan Bhujbal

Ajit Pawar's wife and Rajya Sabha MP, Sunetra Pawar, is set to take over the reins of the party after his passing as she ticks the boxes of seniority, parity (with the rest of the Pawars), continuity and stability that the party wants bold and underlined.While the names of Ajit's sons Jay and Parth are also doing the rounds, what weighs things far more in Sunetra's favour is the feeling that there needs to be continuity, which the 62-year-old widow of the Maratha strongman will provide more than anyone else as she is the spouse, plus the fact that seniority considerations have to be kept in mind to some extent while picking a successor.Ajit had a team of senior politicians around him in his NCP. Praful Patel, Dilip Walse Patil, Chhagan Bhujbal, Hasan Mushrif, Sunil Tatkare, Dhananjay Munde are all politicians with experience in politics, legislature and administration. The party would accept the sons without hesitation as Parth and Jay are carriers of Ajit's name and legacy. But Sunetra's name would not require a negotiation with even the most experienced of the lot.The transition would be smooth and unquestioned, and acceptance of responsibilities would be genuine under her leadership among both seniors and juniors in NCP. Crucially, it is expected to stymie attempts to wean away a section of the outfit or some of its 40-odd MLAs either owing to injured egos or groupism or simply the promise of greater benefits and stability in other political camps.Sunetra's loss to Supriya Sule in 2024 Lok Sabha elections had rankled with Ajit, and placing her in the top position now would be one way of making amends, of assuaging sentiments of those in NCP who have a sense of hurt about that defeat, and of also making a political statement in the process.Sunetra's parity with the other seniors in the Pawar household would be another key factor. She would be able to speak to the leadership of the other faction of NCP as an equal and make acceptable decisions, including those about a merger. If, say, she decides to assert the identity and independence of the Ajit-led NCP, all forces within the party would instantly rally around her.Jay and Parth would also be able to negotiate or talk to the other faction, but Sunetra at the helm would be enough to scotch the rank and file's fears of a hasty decision taken by an impressionable person or one weighed down by thoughts of deference to elders, which is natural in a household as famously close-knit as those of the Pawars.Sunetra is the sister of former state minister and education baron Padamsinh Patil. Apart from her experience in Rajya Sabha, she has seen political activity up close all her life. She has also been engaged in social work for nearly two decades. She founded Environmental Forum of India in 2010, which works on promoting adoption of eco-friendly practices by villages and creation of eco-conscious communities.She's been a trustee of educational institution, Vidya Pratisthan in Baramati, on whose grounds Ajit's mortal remains were kept for people to pay their respects and where his last rites were carried out. The party believes that this experience in the social sector also makes her the ideal pick to lead it.","Ajit Pawar's wife and Rajya Sabha MP, Sunetra Pawar, is set to take over the reins of the party after his passing.

NEW DELHI: Shaheen Malik does not call it a victory. When her petition came up before the Supreme Court on Tuesday, the Bench made observations that could reshape how acid attack cases are treated—flagging the need for “extraordinary punitive measures”, questioning why the assets of convicted attackers cannot be seized and auctioned to compensate victims, and stating that a reformative approach has “no place” for attackers.While stopping short of issuing binding directions, the court assured Malik legal assistance of her choice, urged high courts to fast-track trials, and sought detailed data from states on acid attack cases. But for Malik, there is a long way to go. “This is not closure or a win. For survivors, it is only a beginning,” she toldon Friday.In 2009, acid was thrown on Malik’s face outside her workplace in Panipat. Since then, her life has unfolded inside hospital wards, police stations and courtrooms. She accused her employer’s wife and two students, one a juvenile, of carrying out the attack.Earlier data submitted by 15 HCs showed UP with the highest number of pending acid attack cases (198), followed by West Bengal (160), Gujarat (114), Bihar (68) and Maharashtra (58).For Malik, the numbers only echo what her body has carried for years.“For one second, I thought it was a prank,” she recalled. “Then the burning started.”Her parents and brothers rushed to bring her back to Delhi, hoping she would be admitted immediately, but they were turned away. “Hospitals initially refused to admit me unless we deposited lakhs of rupees, saying it was a criminal case,” she told the court. Even after an FIR was registered, she said, nothing moved. “Years passed… The case didn’t move. ”What followed was not only physical devastation, but systemic abandonment. Survival itself came at a cost that never stopped mounting.The corrosive liquid caused third-degree burns and permanent disfigurement, melting skin and facial tissue across nearly 90% of her face and parts of her body. Malik permanently lost vision in one eye. After more than two dozen reconstructive surgeries, her remaining eye still requires lifelong treatment and specialised cylindrical lenses.In 2012, after writing to then Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, she received Rs 3 lakh towards medical expenses. Malik said, “Justice was never about the money. But the cost of surviving is crushing.”Years blurred into each other—endless travel, hospital visits followed by court dates, and a support system that slowly shrank. “I lost friends, connections… everything.”Then came 2025. After more than 15 years of litigation, a Delhi court acquitted the three accused, citing lack of substantial evidence and serious gaps in the investigation. “I was disfigured, visually impaired, mentally shattered—and the people responsible walked free.” That moment became the trigger for her PIL in the SC. “I woke up and decided, this needs a fight,” Malik said.“I could give up—or continue fighting for every woman facing injustice.” She chose the latter not just for herself but to flag what she calls a ""structural failure"".Malik spoke of time slipping away. Pleading for an expedited hearing, she told the court the violence does not end with the crime. It stretches across years of trauma, isolation, treatment, hearings and waiting. “I told the SC that the pain I carry, no one else should have to carry for this long. I have given this case sixteen years of my life. I cannot give another sixteen,” she said.If Malik has one demand, it is not sympathy but sensitisation with consequences. Her petition sought police training, time-bound investigations, fast-track courts, judicial sensitivity and stricter punishment. “Acid violence comes from patriarchy, entitlement. When there is no fear, crimes continue.”Like hundreds of hearings she has attended before, that Tuesday began with cautious hope. She reached early, even though her case was listed for the afternoon. When the order finally came, she wiped away a tear.Malik believes the court’s suggestion to auction assets of convicted attackers is crucial. She said, “Medical care for acid survivors is primary for their survival. No one should live wondering if better treatment could have saved their sight, face, or future.”Acid violence, she said, imposes lifelong financial, psychological and social costs. “If the crime is created by society, then society must step in—not through charity, but accountability.”The violence stripped her of an ordinary future, with marriage out of the picture long ago. She lives alone, often wishing she had a companion. “No one wants to accept you with this face… this disability. I have to live like this for the rest of my life.”In 2021, Malik founded Brave Souls Foundation in Delhi, supporting over 300 acid attack survivors with medical aid, legal assistance, trauma counselling and rehabilitation. But stigma remains. “People don’t want to rent us houses, don’t want to give us jobs. They say our faces bring bad luck. The culprits, meanwhile, blend back into normal life.”Still, Malik says she has purpose. “My work is my life’s goal. If I can ease someone else’s struggle, it’s enough.” She hopes to be remembered not as a victim, but as proof that fighting yields something.“This isn’t personal anymore,” she said.","Shaheen Malik was attacked with acid outside her workplace in Panipat in 2009.

BENGALURU: A toxic chemical long considered hostile to life on Mars, may not be an obstacle to building on the Red Planet after all. Instead, it could turn out to be an unlikely aid. Researchers at IISc, working with scientists at IISER-Kolkata and Isro astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla , have found that perchlorate, a chlorine-based compound known to stress living cells, can strengthen bacteria-made “space bricks” under the right conditions.“Mars is an alien environment. What is going to be the effect of this new alien environment on Earth organisms is a very, very important scientific question to answer,” Aloke Kumar, associate professor, mechanical engineering at IISc and corresponding author, says.Perchlorates have been detected at several Martian landing sites and are considered hostile to life. They interfere with microbial growth and pose health risks to humans. For scientists exploring biological routes to construction on Mars, the compound has long been seen as a constraint that must be eliminated or avoided. The new study, however, points to a more complex interaction between chemistry, biology, and soil.The team focused on bacteria that can bind loose soil into solid blocks through biocementation. In earlier work, IISc researchers showed that the soil bacterium “Sporosarcina pasteurii” can produce calcium carbonate crystals that glue together particles of lunar or Martian soil simulants.The process requires urea, calcium, and guar gum, a natural polymer that supports bacterial survival.In the new study, published in PLOS One, the researchers used a more robust bacterial strain isolated from soils in Bengaluru. After confirming its mineral-forming ability, the team examined how it responded to perchlorate levels comparable to those measured on Mars, reaching up to about one per cent.The biological response was studied in collaboration with IISER-Kolkata, where Professor Punyasloke Bhadury’s group examined how perchlorate alters cell behaviour. The bacteria grew more slowly, became rounder in shape, and began clumping together, all clear signs of chemical stress. They also released higher levels of proteins and other molecules into their surroundings, forming an extracellular matrix.When these stressed bacteria were added to synthetic Martian soil in the lab, the outcome surprised the researchers. With guar gum and a small amount of nickel chloride present, the resulting bricks were stronger than those produced without perchlorate. Microscopy revealed more mineral precipitates and fine “microbridges” formed by the extracellular matrix, linking bacterial cells to soil grains and minerals.“When the effect of perchlorate on just the bacteria is studied in isolation, it is a stressful factor. But in the bricks, with the right ingredients in the mixture, perchlorate is helping,” says IISc’s Swati Dubey, the study’s first author.Ultimately, the team’s goal is to deploy this method as an alternative, sustainable building strategy, to rely less on carbon-intensive cement-based processes – both on Earth and Mars. Co-author of the study, Shukla, who is pursuing his Master’s degree with Kumar at IISc, says such technologies can also help make future Mars landing missions smoother, by helping build better roads, launch pads, and rover landing sites.“The idea is to do in situ resource utilisation as much as possible. We don’t have to carry anything from here; in situ, we can use those resources and make those structures, which will make it a lot easier to navigate and do sustained missions over a period of time,” ,” Shukla added.","Perchlorate, a chlorine-based compound known to stress living cells, can strengthen bacteria-made ‘space bricks’ under the right conditions.

Sanju Samson or Ishan Kishan? | Greenstone Lobo predicts the ideal player for T20 World Cup

Pakistan have suffered a major setback ahead of their mouth-watering Under-19 clash against India at the Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo, a match that will decide the fourth semi-finalist of the ICC Under-19 World Cup in Zimbabwe. Afghanistan and England joined Australia as the latest entrants into the semi-finals on Friday following impressive performances in their Super Six clashes, with an unbeaten England becoming the first team from Group 2 to reach the final four. Sunday’s marquee India-Pakistan encounter now shapes up as a virtual knockout.Pakistan’s preparations were dented after wicketkeeper-batter Mohammad Shayan was ruled out due to injury, the Pakistan Cricket Board confirmed.“Pakistan U19 wicketkeeper-batter Mohammad Shayan has been ruled out of the ICC U19 Men's Cricket World Cup after being struck on the nose by a ball while wicketkeeping to a fast bowler during a scenario-based practice match,” the PCB said in a statement. He was taken to hospital, where X-rays confirmed a fracture, with a replacement set to be named in due course.Australia had already progressed to the final four from Group 1, while Afghanistan grabbed the remaining spot following a commanding 191-run win over Ireland.England sealed qualification from Group 2 after defeating New Zealand by 65 runs, courtesy a five-wicket haul from Manny Lumsden. India currently enjoy an advantage heading into their clash with Pakistan, sitting on six points from three matches with a superior net run rate, while Pakistan have four points.In Harare, Afghanistan rode on a scintillating 163 from Faisal Khan to post 315/7 after electing to bat first. Faisal struck 18 fours and a six in his 142-ball knock, which stands as the highest individual score by an Afghan batter in tournament history. Afghanistan were in early trouble at 27/2 before a 75-run third-wicket partnership between Faisal and Uzairullah Niazai steadied the innings. The game swung decisively in Afghanistan’s favour during a 188-run fourth-wicket stand between Faisal and captain Mahboob Khan, who scored 89 off 79 balls with five fours and two sixes.Ireland’s Reuben Wilson and Olly Riley picked up three wickets apiece, but the Irish chase never took off. Ireland were bowled out for 124, with Marko Bates (34) and Wilson (31) adding 55 for the sixth wicket in a brief show of resistance. Abdul Aziz led Afghanistan’s bowling with 3/21, while leg-break bowler Aqil Khan wrapped up proceedings with three wickets for 36 runs.Earlier in Bulawayo, New Zealand, already out of semi-final contention, restricted England to 234/7 on a tricky surface. Ben Dawkins made a cautious 42, while Ben Mayes (53) and Caleb Faloner (47) chipped in with vital contributions. Mason Clarke was the pick of New Zealand’s bowlers with 2/38. However, Lumsden turned the game on its head with figures of 5/17 as New Zealand were bowled out for 169 in 38.5 overs, despite Senith Reddy’s 47 and a 58-run stand with Callum Samson.",Pakistan's wicketkeeper-batter Mohammad Shayan ruled out of Under-19 World Cup.

Gabrielle Union contemplated ending her marriage with Dwyane Wade once

Dwyane Wade stood beside Gabrielle Union through their difficult days

Dwyane Wade and his wife, the popular actress Gabrielle Union, have had a beautiful and a healthy marriage ever since they tied the knot in 2014.While things have always been good between them, Gabrielle Union went through a traumatic struggle as she tried to conceive their baby early on in their marriage. Unfortunately, the popular actress went through a number of miscarriages and had to opt for surrogacy later. While the miscarriages affected her health, Gabrielle Union opened up how it changed her relationship with Dwyane Wade.A few years ago, in 2021, Gabrielle Union wrote an essay for TIME where she revealed how she thought of ending her marriage with Dwyane Wade because of her fertility issues.Gabrielle Union wrote, “Because at that point I would have sold my soul to get out of the endless cycle of loss. What was the going rate for souls? What was mine worth, anyway?”The Being Mary Jane actress added, “Clearly, my feelings weren’t originating from a healthy place. So much of what made the decision so difficult was that if I didn’t submit to a surrogacy, then I was convinced I needed to let Dwyane go.”Dwyane Wade’s wife, Gabrielle Union, continue, “Even if he didn’t want to, I had to let him find someone who could give him what he wanted.”When Gabrielle Union wanted to try on new experimental medicines to conceive, it was Dwyane Wade who stopped her from harming her health further.Despite Gabrielle Union’s strong doubts over how their marriage will last, the NBA legend Dwyane Wade stood by his wife and became a strong source of strength and support to her.In 2017, Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union ended up choosing a surrogate to give birth to their baby and in 2018, they were blessed with a healthy child, Kaavia Wade.Close to a decade later, Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union are in one of the happiest phases of their lives as they choose to celebrate their daughter everyday.","Dwyane Wade and his wife, the popular actress Gabrielle Union, have had a beautiful and a healthy marriage ever since they tied the knot in 2014. The popular actress went through a traumatic struggle as she tried to conceive their baby early on in their marriage. She contemplated ending her marriage with Dwyane Wade once because of her fertility issues.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127784877,imgsize-838270,width-400,resizemode-4/dwyane-wade.jpg"

Who comes out ahead?

A trade idea making the rounds this offseason imagines a bold swap between the Atlanta Braves and the Chicago Cubs. In this scenario, Chicago sends versatile infielder Nico Hoerner to Atlanta, while the Braves move hard-throwing reliever Robert Suarez to the Cubs to fix Chicago’s late-inning problem.It is not an official offer, but the structure lines up cleanly with what both teams need right now. Atlanta would be turning bullpen depth into everyday infield stability. Chicago would be turning infield depth into a true ninth-inning stopper. Both players are in their primes and under multi-year control, which makes the idea more than a short-term gamble.The core of the deal is straightforward.• Nico Hoerner (SS/2B, under control through at least 2027 with club options after)• Robert Suarez (RHP, under a three-year, $45 million deal running through 2028)Atlanta would be trading a top late-inning arm for a reliable everyday infielder who can move around the diamond. Chicago would be flipping that idea, giving up a regular position player to secure a steady closer for the next few years.Atlanta Braves’ plans up the middle changed when Ha-Seong Kim suffered a torn tendon in his right middle finger that could sideline him for four to five months. Even with Orlando Arcia and Vaughn Grissom on the roster, that injury opens a real gap at either shortstop or second base.Nico Hoerner fits as an immediate plug-in option. Over his career he has logged more than 1,000 innings at shortstop and nearly 800 at second base, giving Atlanta flexibility without forcing a defensive downgrade.Offensively, he offers a different look from a power-heavy lineup. In 2025 he played 156 games with a .297 batting average, strong on-base skills, and 31 steals. He does not rely on home runs, but he puts the ball in play and pressures defenses.That profile slots neatly alongside hitters like Ronald Acuña Jr., Matt Olson, and Austin Riley. He lengthens the top of the order with contact, speed, and reliable defense rather than adding more swing-and-miss power.Chicago Cubs’ biggest roster uncertainty is the ninth inning. A closer-by-committee approach has worked in stretches but lacks a single trusted finisher.Robert Suarez brings that role with recent proof. In 2025 he recorded 40 saves with a 2.97 ERA and a 0.90 WHIP over 63.2 innings. Across 2024 and 2025 he piled up 76 saves, more than any pitcher in that span. His combination of velocity, strikeouts, and control is built for high-leverage work.At 29 years old and under contract through 2028, he would give Chicago both immediate stability and multi-year certainty at the back of the bullpen.• Age: 28• Positions: shortstop and second base• Team control: through at least 2027, with club options after• Style: contact hitter, strong on-base skills, plus defender, impact baserunner• Age: 29• Position: late-inning reliever/closer• Contract: three years, $45 million, fully guaranteed• Style: power fastball, swing-and-miss slider, high strikeout rate, low walk rateNeither side is trading a rental. Both would be moving a core-age player with several years of control left.• A versatile everyday infielder who can cover shortstop and second• A contact and speed threat near the top of the lineup• Defensive stability in the middle infield while Kim is sidelined• A high-end reliever who could anchor late innings or be moved later for other needsAtlanta can soften that blow because it still has established relief options, including closer Raisel Iglesias.• A proven closer who immediately settles the ninth inning• Long-term control of a high-leverage arm through 2028• A valuable bullpen piece that could also be moved later if needed• A reliable, controllable middle infielderChicago can point to internal options such as James Triantos and other depth pieces to help cover second base if Hoerner is moved.• Fixes an infield hole created by Kim’s injury without a stopgap move• Adds a high-contact bat that complements the existing core• Improves defensive flexibility up the middle• Removes a premium bullpen arm• Could create crowding later if Kim returns and everyone is healthy• Turns a bullpen question mark into a strength• Secures a closer for several seasons, not just one run• Creates flexibility to reshape the infield mix• Gives up a multi-position everyday player• Takes on the added injury risk that always comes with pitchersThe trade is balanced, but the edge tilts slightly toward Atlanta. The Braves would be converting excess relief value into an everyday, two-way infielder at a moment when they have a clear positional need. Chicago would get a major bullpen upgrade, but it would be parting with a controllable position player to do it.If the Cubs are confident their in-house infield options can replace most of Hoerner’s production, the deal makes strong sense for them as well. If not, the opportunity cost becomes heavier on Chicago’s side.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Houston Astros potentially eyeing $7,725,000 Cleveland Guardians star in stellar win-now move ahead of deadline This idea works because it targets specific weaknesses rather than chasing star power for its own sake. Atlanta shores up the middle of the diamond during an injury window. Chicago locks down the final three outs of close games.If it ever moved from rumor to reality, it would be a classic win-now exchange: an everyday infielder for a shutdown closer, each filling a gap the other team cannot easily solve internally.","Chicago sends versatile infielder Nico Hoerner to Atlanta, while the Braves move hard-throwing reliever Robert Suarez to the Cubs.

For those not familiar, the term sigma male is a modern-day Jungian internet archetype used to describe a man who is ostensibly independent, self-assured, and operates outside traditional social hierarchies. Think Tyler Durden, Travis Bickle, or John Wick.Of course, like most internet slang, it has become a parody of its original meaning, with the term used to describe malignant (and often misogynist) internet personalities that appeal to incels. The term was rather in vogue last year after influencers Jake Paul and Andrew Tate lost fights to professional athletes, with some even dubbing the losses “9/11 for sigma males”. Soliloquies on internet culture aside, the losses were a reminder of the gap that exists between regular people and athletes. Like the time billionaire Bill Ackman learnt this while participating in the Hall of Fame Open, where he could barely lay racket on ball.Most non-athletes wouldn’t last in a cage, ring, or court with a professional. But even amongst professional athletes, there’s a rare breed that has access to a metaphorical place their less hallowed peers wish they could reach.They operate at a level that even fellow professionals fail to comprehend. It’s both mental and physical.As Andre Agassi said after his 2005 US Open Final loss to Roger Federer : “In the tiebreak, he goes to a place that I don’t recognize…. I feel for the man who is fated to play Agassi to his Sampras.”Now Agassi is no shrinking violet; he is the first man to win a Career Golden Slam. One of the greatest returners in the game, and yet he couldn’t believe what Federer was doing.During their time, the Big Three showed how they were a cut above the rest. Their dedication to the craft was unmatched. Novak Djokovic has spent the last decade living like a hermit. Rafa Nadal pushed his body to a level that seemed unfathomable, perfectly epitomised by the John McEnroe line: “This kid is sensational, is he going to play every point like that?” Federer, as Agassi observed, looked like he could play a professional match without breaking a sweat, as if he should wear a smoking jacket instead of tennis gear. Federer looked like he was dancing on the court. Nadal covered every blade of grass, every grain of sand, every inch of clay. Djokovic looked like — and still looks like at 38 — he could go on for days, seemingly powered by a perpetual motion machine from another universe.Ivan Lendl, another man who knows his way around the tennis circuit, observed in 2017 while coaching Andy Murray, who was attempting a comeback after hip surgery: “The top guys are top guys because they do things a little bit better than the other guys. Yes, they can get upset, or the others can upset them, but if they play 100 times they are going to win more than half. They are better in stroke production, movement, physically. You put all that into a package and the package is slightly better than the guys below.”And at Melbourne Park, Carlos Alcaraz reminded us how he is cut from the same cloth as the GOATs before his era.Before the semi-final, the murmur around the Australian Open — and the online chatter that follows it — suggested this had been too one-sided a tournament so far. One that could have been an email instead of a whole tournament because a Sincaraz final looked inevitable. Sinner and Alcaraz met in six finals in 2025, three of them Grand Slams. They have evenly split the last eight majors. And their meeting in the first Slam of 2026 seemed inevitable until it seemed impossible as Alcaraz lay on the floor.We have seen Alcaraz do remarkable things in his career so far. His drop shot can leave opponents wrong-footed. In the last few years, he has made good on his promise to become a serve bot. At times, he hits shots from angles that even cameras cannot catch.Alcaraz was cruising against Zverev with a two-set lead when cramps laid him low. And suddenly, he couldn’t walk, swing, or move at will. His movement was oddly reminiscent of Aussie cricketer Glenn Maxwell against Afghanistan in the 2024 ODI World Cup, where the Aussie was laid low by cramps. But like Maxwell, Alcaraz found a way out.His medical timeout will be discussed ad nauseam. Zverev’s infuriated response has already launched a million reactions on Tennis Twitter. Boris Becker added his two cents, which he is wont to do on issues outside tennis as well.Perhaps the organisers at Slams go out of their way to help the stars, given that it’s their presence that draws the big bucks and eyeballs. But what’s undeniable is that Alcaraz managed to reach into that special fountain of fortitude available only to the greatest players. Zverev’s outrage during the timeout foreshadowed the things to come.Even after getting back on his feet, Alcaraz could barely keep up. And yet he would not give up. After the match he explained: “I always say you have to believe in yourself, no matter what you’re struggling [with], what you’ve been through, you’ve got to still believe in yourself all the time.”As Lendl had explained: “That’s how people win tournaments — they fight. It doesn’t come easy. You don’t always play your best and you have to get through that and fighting is part of it. When you play, sometimes you feel tired and you have to push through that pain barrier as well…”The Spaniard never stopped believing, and neither did the crowd, even when Zverev was serving for the match at 5-4. But in what seemed like an instant, Alcaraz had his arms aloft, level at 5-5, and suddenly ahead at 6-5.Watching them side by side was watching two responses to pressure unfold in real time. Zverev had the match on his racket, serving at 5-4, physically strong and dictating rallies, a player built to impose order. Alcaraz could barely move an hour earlier, yet he kept reaching for variety — drop shots, angled returns, sudden changes of pace — as if chaos itself were a weapon. One tried to close the door through force. The other kept opening windows through imagination. In the end, it wasn’t the healthier body that prevailed but the player willing to keep inventing solutions when logic said the match was over.One shot summed up the contrast. Appearing to hit a normal return, Alcaraz suddenly feinted a drop shot at 5-5 that seemed to send Zverev crumbling.Zverev is a good player trying to become great. He was the youngest player to debut in the top 20 since Novak Djokovic. He beat Roger Federer on grass when he was 17. At home, Zverev is called Sascha, the Russian diminutive for Alexander the Great, who wept after believing there was no world left to conquer. But as the match progressed, one wondered whether Sascha could conquer the demons in his mind — the ones that need to be exorcised to win a Grand Slam title.Alcaraz, on the other hand, has no such demons. The Career Grand Slam remains the Holy Grail of tennis. Eight men have done it, with four in the Open Era. The youngest so far is Don Budge, who was 22 years and 11 months when he completed it, though it was during an era when tennis was played on two surfaces: grass and clay. The youngest to do it in the Open Era was Rafael Nadal at 24 years and three months.Alcaraz, on the other hand, could become the youngest to complete the set. The ones standing in his way will be his great rival Sinner or Novak Djokovic, who is 38 now but refuses to go quietly into the night and wants to become the first man to win 25 Slams. Time will tell who emerges triumphant, but one thing is for sure: no matter what happens on Sunday, Alcaraz’s renaissance from the face of defeat will live long in the annals of the Australian Open.","Carlos Alcaraz will play Alexander Zverev in the Australian Open final in 2026. The pair have met in six finals, three of them Grand Slams. They have split evenly in the last eight majors. Al caraz has made good on his promise to become a bot.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127802079,imgsize-133618,width-400,resizemode-4/alcaraz-fends-off-zverev-and-cramps-in-an-epic-five-set-semifinal-to-reach-the-australian-open-final.jpg"

Why Khamzat Chimaev’s timing could reshape UFC matchmaking

Khamzat Chimaev has injected fresh uncertainty into Jon Jones’ long-discussed UFC White House showdown by calling out Alex Pereira at a critical moment. Just as momentum was building for a legacy fight between Jones and Pereira, Chimaev used social media to publicly challenge the reigning light heavyweight champion. The timing could not be worse for Jones, whose long-awaited return has already faced delays and shifting plans from UFC officials.Chimaev, currently competing at middleweight, targeted Alex Pereira through a series of posts on X. He highlighted differences in their win records while mocking Pereira’s “Chama” catchphrase. Chimaev also resurfaced past knockout and submission clips involving Pereira’s inner circle, escalating an already tense rivalry. His actions immediately fueled speculation that the UFC may pivot matchmaking plans, potentially sidelining Jones’ hopes of headlining the rumored White House event.The callout arrives at a moment when neither Alex Pereira nor Chimaev has a confirmed opponent. UFC leadership has only recently begun discussing possible fights tied to the proposed White House card. Chimaev’s aggressive push puts pressure on the UFC to consider a superfight because of his unbeaten record and growing popularity.If the UFC moves forward with Chimaev, Jon Jones’ fight with Pereira could lose priority. Chimaev also raised tension by saying he no longer respects Pereira due to constant talk from the Brazilian camp. The rivalry has existed for quite some time. This includes one incident where there was apparently a public altercation between Pereira and Jones in a hotel lobby. Pereira continues to publicly pursue Jones; the challenge by Chimaev complicates the already complicated title picture.At the same time, Chimaev faces competition within his own division. Sean Strickland remains a potential opponent, with his coach, Erick Nicksick, expressing confidence in Strickland’s wrestling and ground game. Strickland is scheduled to fight Anthony Hernandez, a result that could directly impact Chimaev’s next move. Nassourdine Imavov also remains in the mix, adding further uncertainty. For now, Chimaev’s perfectly timed callout has forced the UFC to reconsider its options. Whether he earns a shot at Alex Pereira or returns to middleweight business first may ultimately decide the fate of Jon Jones’ White House ambitions.","Khamzat Chimaev’s ‘Chama’ callout threatens Jon Jones’ UFC White House dream as Alex Pereira responds.

Steelers coaching staff update: Former Saints star Jahri Evans joins Mike McCarthy team,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/steelers-coaching-staff-update-former-saints-star-jahri-evans-joining-mike-mccarthy/articleshow/127807861.cms,"Image via IMAGN

A reunion years in the making

Why Jahri Evans’ track record matters in Pittsburgh

The Pittsburgh Steelers’ new era under head coach Mike McCarthy continues to take shape. In the latest development, former New Orleans Saints star and Hall of Fame finalist Jahri Evans is expected to join McCarthy’s coaching staff.According to multiple reports, Evans will take up a role as an assistant offensive line coach in Pittsburgh. The move reunites him with McCarthy, who was Evans’ head coach during the final season of his playing career with the Green Bay Packers in 2017.Evans is widely regarded as one of the greatest offensive linemen in Saints history. Drafted in the fourth round in 2006, he became a cornerstone of New Orleans’ dominant offense for more than a decade. During his time with the Saints, Evans earned six Pro Bowl selections and four first-team All-Pro honors. He was also part of the team that won Super Bowl XLIV.After retiring from playing, Evans returned to New Orleans in 2022 to begin his coaching career. He started as a coaching intern and gradually worked his way up, serving as the assistant offensive line coach over the past season. His steady growth within the Saints organization made him a respected young coach.Since being hired to replace longtime head coach Mike Tomlin, McCarthy has been working quickly to assemble his staff. Bringing in Evans shows a clear pattern McCarthy is leaning on coaches and former players he knows and trusts.Evans’ familiarity with McCarthy’s system and coaching style likely played a big role in this hire. The two worked together during Evans’ final NFL season in Green Bay, and that connection appears to have remained strong.The Steelers are also in the process of changing their offensive staff after some recent changes. With new leaders in place, making the offensive line stronger will be a top objective, especially because the team wants to stabilize its attack before the 2026 season.Evans is also a finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2026, with the official announcement expected soon. His decorated playing career adds credibility to his coaching profile, particularly when working with offensive linemen.This move is good for Pittsburgh since it gives them both experience and stability. Evans knows what it takes to be the best because he played for one of the league's most dynamic attacks when he was at his best.McCarthy is still putting up his staff, and the signing of Evans shows that he wants to build a strong foundation in the trenches. The Steelers' new coaching staff is slowly coming together for the 2026 season, with more additions expected in the next few weeks.","Former New Orleans Saints star Jahri Evans is expected to join Mike McCarthy's coaching staff.

Gervonta Davis’ arrest, bond release , and legal battle explained

Boxing fans woke up to shocking news this week as Gervonta Davis was released from jail after spending a night behind bars in Miami. Once praised as one of boxing’s biggest stars, Davis is now facing serious legal trouble again. The 31-year-old boxer was arrested on Wednesday after Miami Gardens police acted on an active arrest warrant. The case involves allegations made by his former girlfriend, Courtney Rossel, who has accused him of multiple crimes. Davis was taken into custody without resistance, booked, and held overnight before posting bond the next day.While Davis is now out of jail, the situation around him is far from over. The case has already damaged his public image, and his legal team is now trying to turn the story around by claiming that Davis himself is the real victim. With court cases, past incidents, and strict bond conditions in play, this latest chapter could shape his future inside and outside the ring.Miami Gardens police arrested Davis after working with the United States Marshals fugitive task force. Officers tracked him across three counties before finding him at the Miami Design District. He was arrested without incident and taken to the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center, where he spent Wednesday night in custody.On Thursday, Davis appeared in bond court through video. The hearing was led by Mindy S. Glazer, who set his bond at $16,000. She also placed strict conditions on his release, including a no-contact order with the alleged victim. Davis posted bond later that day and was released.The case dates back to an alleged incident involving Rossel. According to authorities, Davis and Rossel met in 2022 and dated briefly before ending their relationship. After the alleged incident, Rossel filed a complaint with Miami Gardens Police and also filed a civil lawsuit against Davis.Rossel’s attorney, Jeff Chukwuma, said the criminal case matches the civil claims. He told ESPN on January 14, “What the police said is exactly in line with our lawsuit. So whatever investigation they did, they determined it was enough to get a judge to sign off on an arrest warrant.”Davis’ legal team strongly disagrees. His attorney, Simon Steckel, told The Associated Press, “Gervonta Davis is actually a victim here, and I look forward to establishing that shocking narrative in court.”This is not Davis’ first legal issue. In 2023, he served house arrest and probation after a hit-and-run case in Baltimore. With this new arrest, questions remain about how it may affect his probation in Maryland. For now, Davis is free on bond, but his future remains uncertain.","Gervonta Davis was released from jail after spending a night behind bars in Miami.

What are the trade options for the Blackhawks to consider this season?

Blackhawks vs. Penguins | NHL Highlights | January 29, 2026

The Chicago Blackhawks, who are quite far from the playoff hopes in the Western Conference, are planning to be poised as buyers ahead of the March 6 deadline rather than fire-sale assets. With a 21-22-7 record through 50 games, they trail the San Jose Sharks by eight points for the final wild-card spot but boast ample cap space and draft picks to become a major buyer before the NHL deadline.As the Blackhawks are out of a playoff spot as February approaches, many have naturally wondered if they trade some of their players ahead of the deadline. Meanwhile, Connor Murphy, Ilya Mikheyev, Jason Dickinson, Matt Grzelcyk, and Nick Foligno are the Blackhawks' most notable pending UFAs with the potential to be moved. This would prompt them to trade the players, but they should also pivot to buyer mode ahead of the trade deadline.As the Chicago Blackhawks currently hold a 21-24-9 record and sit in sixth place in the NHL's Central Division, they are drawing attention around this year's 2026 NHL trade deadline as discussions heat up about whether they should rebuild their club or trade players.Despite looming speculation about moving pending free agents such as Connor Murphy, IIlya Mikheyev, Jason Dickinson, Matt Grzelcyk, and Nick Foligno, the hockey community thinks that the team should remain open to acquiring players under contract beyond this season to accelerate its long-term competitiveness.As reported by the Hockey News, the Vancouver Canucks could make sense as a trade partner for the Blackhawks, as they have two top-six wingers, Conor Garland and Jake DeBrusk, who are signed for multiple years beyond this season. The Canucks sit last in the NHL and announced plans to rebuild, which could make these players available to acquire.Meanwhile, the Blackhawks can keep an eye on players like Alexis Lafreniere, who could be a great fit on a Blackhawks club on the rise. Vincent Trocheck, on the other hand, would be a fantastic top-six veteran center for the Blackhawks to bring in.Also, as Calgary Flames center Nazem Kadri's name is considered for trade deals and is currently doing the rounds, he could be a strong veteran for Chicago to add to their group. Even Blake Coleman would be a nice addition for the Blackhawks to add, as he is a well-respected leader who has good offensive strengths and plays a heavy game.","The Chicago Blackhawks are planning to be buyers ahead of the March 6 deadline rather than fire-sale assets.

Why LeBron James' presence is important for the Los Angeles Lakers

What to watch during the game at Capital One Arena (January 30, 2026)

’ road game on. He is not listed on the injury report, which means there are no restrictions on his minutes.This gives the Lakers some stability going into the game. They have been dealing with minor injuries in the backcourt, so having their main ball handler fully fit makes a clear difference. With him active, the team can run its normal offense from the start. There is no need for last-minute lineup changes or reduced playing time.The official report does not mention LeBron James at all. Players who are at risk of sitting or being limited are usually marked as questionable or probable. That is not the case here. Guard depth is still not at full strength while Austin Reaves works back from a calf strain. Because of that, the Lakers will continue to rely on LeBron to bring the ball up, set up teammates, and control the pace.Another key teammate, Luka Dončić, has been dealing with a leg and ankle issue and was listed as questionable earlier in the day. In contrast, there has been no similar concern around LeBron.Even at 41, LeBron is putting up strong numbers. He is averaging a little over 22 points per game, along with around six rebounds and six assists.He is still one of the team’s main scorers and also its primary passer. Late in close games, the ball usually goes through him so he can either take the shot or find an open teammate.His outside shooting has held up, and he remains reliable in the final minutes when the result is on the line.The Washington Wizards have struggled to stop opposing offenses this season. They give up a lot of points and often react slowly on the perimeter. That type of defense suits the Los Angeles Lakers when they run plays through LeBron. He can attack mismatches, get into the paint, and force help defenders to move before passing to an open shooter.If Washington cannot contain his drives, the Lakers should be able to create good shots throughout the game.The Los Angeles Lakers are fighting for position in the Western Conference and need to beat teams below .500. Games like this are ones they are expected to win. LeBron helps keep the game under control. He reduces rushed plays and limits empty possessions by slowing things down when needed.He is also the first option at the end of tight games. Without him, the offense would lean heavily on Dončić and a thinner rotation. With him on the floor, the team has more balance.First, who handles the ball in the final minutes if the score is close. The Lakers may choose between LeBron creating from the top or letting Dončić take the main scoring role. Second, his three-point attempts. He averages just under two made threes per game, but this matchup could give him more open looks. Lastly, his total minutes. With a busy road stretch and his age, the coaching staff may try to find short rest periods unless the game stays tight.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers vs Washington Wizards injury report: Who's playing, injured and questionable players, head-to-head records, team stats, and more (January 30, 2026) There is no doubt about his status.

Los Angeles Lakers vs Washington Wizards game timing for fans in India (January 30, 2026)

for the road game between theand the Washington Wizards because of soreness in his left ankle. The team plans to make the final call shortly before the game starts.This is not a ruling that he is out. It means the Lakers want to see how his ankle feels after warm-ups before deciding.Luka Doncic's problem started earlier this week against the Cleveland Cavaliers. After taking a shot, Doncic stepped back and lost his footing near the edge of the raised court. He slipped into the gap between the playing surface and the sideline area. His left leg twisted as he fell and he had to leave the game for a short time.He later returned and still finished with 29 points, six assists and five rebounds in about 30 minutes. After the game he said he was not fully healthy. Since then, the team has treated the issue as left ankle soreness and limited his load in practice.For the game at Capital One Arena, Luka Doncic is officially marked as questionable with left ankle soreness. Austin Reaves is also listed as questionable because of a left calf problem.Rookie Adou Thiero is ruled out with a right MCL sprain. A questionable tag usually means the player has a real chance to play, but nothing is certain until closer to tip-off.The Los Angeles Lakers are fighting for playoff position in the West. Luka Doncic has carried a large part of their offense this season. In 38 games he is averaging 33.6 points, 8.7 assists and 7.7 rebounds. He handles the ball, creates shots and scores at a high rate.If he cannot play, the Lakers will have to rely more on role players and bench scorers. That could make it easier for Washington to control the game.The decision will likely come after shootaround and pre-game warm-ups. Updates will appear on team channels and the official feeds of the NBA in the hours before tip-off. Players in this situation often end up playing, but the team may be careful because the fall in Cleveland was unusual and could have made the ankle unstable.Tip-off is 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time. That means the final update should come around 5:30 to 6:30 a.m. IST, one to two hours before the game starts.Also read: Is LeBron James playing tonight vs the Washington Wizards?

Sha'Carri Richardson arrested after alleged 104 MPH speeding stop

It was a tense and emotional moment on a Florida road when Sha'Carri Richardson pleaded with a police officer not to take her to jail. New police bodycam footage shows the Olympic track star begging for mercy after being stopped for alleged speeding. The video, obtained by TMZ Sports, shows Richardson trying everything she could to avoid arrest. She repeatedly asked the deputy to give her a chance and let her go.Despite her efforts, the officer did not change his decision, and Richardson was taken away in handcuffs. The stop happened after a deputy from the Orange County Sheriff's Office pulled her over for allegedly driving more than 100 miles per hour. While Richardson later posted bond and was released the same day, the video has quickly drawn attention because of her emotional response and the officer’s firm stance during the stop.The bodycam video begins with the deputy catching up to Richardson’s Aston Martin before turning on his lights and sirens. After pulling her over, the officer approached her car and immediately addressed her behavior.“I’d wipe that smile off your face,” the deputy said, before explaining why she had been stopped. He told Richardson she was being pulled over for “dangerous, excessive speeding.”The officer then listed the reasons for the arrest in detail.“You’re driving at 104 miles per hour in a 65 miles per hour zone, with subpar equipment, flashing people to get out of your way, following too close, using every lane to pass everybody, cutting me off, passing a car on the inside shoulder with their hazard lights on,” he said. “You’re going to jail for dangerous excessive speeding.”Richardson tried to calm the situation and speak her way out of the arrest. “I really want to work with you, sir. I am a law-abiding citizen,” she said. “Sir, please don’t allow me to go to jail. Please. Please, sir.”Her pleading continued as she explained her situation. “Please, sir. I’m begging you. Don’t take me to jail. I will do everything. My tire, I cannot go to jail. I promise you, I don’t want to go to jail,” Richardson said. “I’m right here. I have a team here. I have a coach, everything. I was not intentionally doing anything.”The officer, however, made it clear his decision was final. He told Richardson there was nothing she could say to change the outcome. As a result, she was arrested and taken to jail.

NHL Insider says Artemi Panarin demands a staggering amount of $50 million contract extension

Is Artemi Panarin on the Move? 🤔

Artemi Panarin, who has been making headlines due to his trade from the New York Rangers, seems to have made their trade efforts more complicated as the Rangers star is reportedly demanding a staggering amount of $50 million contract extension, as reported by NHL insider Elliotte Friedman.The New York Rangers are going through a significant roster shake-up, the team is preparing to move a high-profile player, and they have apparently decided to scratch star forward Artemi Panarin in a 5-2 loss to the New York Islanders at UBS Arena on Thursday.As per reports, Panarin will not play for the New York Rangers in their last two games before the NHL roster freeze for the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026, which begins Feb. 4, 2026. Meanwhile, the Rangers are sitting at the bottom of the Eastern Conference with very limited possibilities to be back in form.As the trade buzz around Artemi Panarin has attracted huge traction, NHL Insider has stated that the star winger has made trade efforts for the New York Rangers complicated by asking for a staggering amount of $50 million contract extension.According to Sportsnet, NHL insider Elliotte Friedman revealed on his 32 Thoughts Podcast that he's been hearing from teams that Panarin and his agent, Paul Theofanous, are seeking a $50 million contract extension. Friedman stated, “I think everybody understands that if you're going to get Panarin, he is going to try to hit a contract home run, even though he's 34 years old. And the number I was hearing, and a few teams backed me on this, was $50 million,""NHL Insider Kevin Weekes reported this week that as many as 14 teams have expressed interest in Panarin, including Anaheim, Los Angeles, San Jose, Vegas, Dallas, Utah, Colorado, Minnesota, Seattle, Toronto, Carolina, Washington, Tampa Bay, and New York Islanders.“Per sources, as of today, I’m told the following have expressed interest in Panarin: ANA, LA, SJ, VGK, DAL, UT, COL, MIN, SEA, TOR, CAR, WAS, TBL, NYI. More clubs will join, and importantly player has to approve any move first,” the insider tweeted.As per reports, among them, the current Stanley Cup champions Florida Panthers, have gained traction as a team, and according to NHL insider Pierre LeBrun, the Panthers sit near the top of Panarin’s personal list, due to the team’s approach and recent success. “If I had to think of a team that would probably be number one on Panarin’s list, I would say the Florida Panthers, like almost every other player in the league,” LeBrun said.While Friedman says that the Colorado Avalanche and Anaheim Ducks could only acquire Panarin as a rental. However, the Dallas Stars would only do a trade and contract extension if they move on from Jason Robertson.It is important to note that Artemi Panarin is in the final year of his seven-year, $81.5 million contract, with $11.64 million in average annual value. Now, it will be interesting to witness which team will choose Panarin with a good trade deal.","Artemi Panarin has been making headlines due to his trade from the New York Rangers.

Main factors in the Portland Trail Blazers vs New York Knicks game (January 30, 2026)

What to expect on Blazers vs Knicks Jan 30

Thein New York with both teams in very different situations. Portland is trying to stop a three-game slide while dealing with several injuries. New York is coming in on a four-game winning streak and has most of its main players available.This game is likely to be decided by depth and basic execution. Portland is missing key guards and needs replacement players to handle the ball and score. New York’s job is not as difficult. They need to defend well, take care of the ball, and use its size advantage.The game will be played at Madison Square Garden, where the Knicks have been strong this season. New York already beat Portland once earlier in the year, and the Blazers are even more short-handed for this meeting.Portland Trail Blazers are 23-25 and have lost three straight. Head coach Chauncey Billups has to rely on a thin rotation.• Damian Lillard - left Achilles management• Scoot Henderson - left knee tear, out for weeks• Matisse Thybulle - right knee tendinopathy• Kris Murray - undisclosed issue• Blake Wesley - sidelined• Duop Reath - right foot stress fracture• Deni Avdija - low back strain, around 25 points and 7 rebounds per game• Robert Williams III - knee managementIf Avdija cannot play, Portland will depend more on Shaedon Sharpe for scoring and on Jerami Grant for defense and secondary offense.Without Lillard and Henderson, Portland lacks steady ball handling. That has led to many turnovers this season.New York Knicks are 29-18 and has won four in a row.• Josh Hart - ankle soreness• Miles McBride - ankle management• Jalen Brunson - around 26 points and 6 assists per game• Karl-Anthony Towns - about 20 points and 11 rebounds• Mikal Bridges• OG Anunoby - around 16 points and 5.4 reboundsIf Hart or McBride sits, Brunson will handle the ball more often, with Bridges and Anunoby helping to create plays.These teams have met 126 times in the regular season. Portland leads the series 70-56. New York won the first meeting this season 123-114 on January 11, 2026. In that game, Brunson and Towns scored more than 40 points combined, and Portland struggled with turnovers.Portland now enters the rematch with fewer healthy guards than it had in that loss.Portland’s last few games include losses by scores of 111-115 and 94-102. The team averages about 16.1 turnovers per game, one of the highest marks in the league.New York has won games by wide margins during its streak, including 119-92 and 103-87. The Knicks have controlled rebounds and limited easy fast-break chances for opponents. Towns anchors the middle, and the wings cover ground on defense. This sets up a simple contrast: Portland must avoid mistakes, while New York looks to force them.Portland needs reliable offense without its top two guards. Sharpe has to score efficiently, Grant has to defend without fouling, and Avdija, if he plays, has to contribute on both ends.New York needs steady guard play if Hart or McBride cannot go. Brunson will see more pressure, so wing support is important. Turnovers will likely decide the pace. If Portland protects the ball, the game can stay close. If New York forces early mistakes, it can build a quick lead.This matchup favors New York. The Knicks are healthier, at home, and have already beaten this opponent once this season. Avdija’s status is the biggest variable. If he plays well, Portland can stay competitive. If he is out, New York should control rebounds, limit mistakes, and manage the game from start to finish.For Portland, the path is simple and that is fewer turnovers and balanced scoring. For New York, it is strong defense, good rebounding, and letting its main players carry the offense.","Portland Trail Blazers are 23-25 and have lost three straight. New York Knicks are 29-18 and has won four in a row. Portland is missing key guards and needs replacement players to handle the ball and score.

‘I Did That on Purpose’: Tony Romo Admits Taylor Swift ‘Wife’ Line Was a Troll Note,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/i-did-that-on-purpose-tony-romo-admits-taylor-swift-wife-line-was-a-troll-note/articleshow/127804194.cms,"Tony Romo admitted he intentionally called Taylor Swift Travis Kelce’s “wife” on air in 2023 to mess with fans.

Tony Romo Says He Dropped the ‘Wife’ Line to Make Fans Spiral

The Real Story Is the Pressure Romo Admitted Came With the Swift-Kelce Spotlight

Tony Romo is owning it. The former Dallas Cowboys quarterback says his viral on-air slip in December 2023 was not a slip at all. He intentionally called Taylor Swift Travis Kelce’s “wife” to mess with fans while the relationship was turning into the NFL’s biggest side show.Romo made the confession Thursday, Jan. 29, during SiriusXM’s “The Morning Mash Up.” He said he wanted people to “think for a second,” then realized the internet took the bait exactly like he expected.Romo admitted he leaned into the moment on purpose. “I did that on purpose and people were like, ‘Do you know something?’” He followed it with the real point of the prank. “Nah, I just wanted to make you guys think for a second [and] just mess with you a little bit.”The original moment happened on Dec. 10, 2023, during a Kansas City Chiefs loss to the Buffalo Bills, when Romo referred to Swift as Kelce’s “wife,” then corrected himself. A week later, he did it again during Chiefs vs. Raiders, then quickly walked it back with “girlfriend,” setting up the booth banter that made the clip travel.At the time, it was obviously inaccurate. Swift and Kelce did not announce their engagement until Aug.26, 2025, when they posted, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married 🧨.”Romo’s “trolling” confession is funny, but the subtext is the tell. He also said it was difficult to stay neutral and balanced while the Swift-Kelce coverage exploded and cameras kept hunting for her reaction shots. That’s not a small thing for an analyst. The job is the game. The broadcast also knows what drives attention.And that’s why this clip never died. It wasn’t just “did he misspeak.” It was “is the booth playing along with the circus.” Romo’s answer is basically yes. He pushed a button because he knew fans would fight about it, clip it, repost it, and keep the conversation going long after the final whistle.","Romo made the confession Thursday, Jan. 29, during SiriusXM’s “The Morning Mash Up.” He said he wanted people to “think for a second,” then realized the internet took the bait exactly like he expected.

Kevin Durant momentised the viral Ashy legs joke

Kevin Durant’s dominance on and off the court

Kevin Durant’s stature as an NBA superstar is equipped with relentless scoring on the court and sharp wit on social media. However, his latest victory didn't involve a buzzer-beater, but rather a clever pivot in the world of skincare.On Tuesday, January 27, 2026, NBA superstar Kevin Durant released a viral video addressing the internet’s long-standing obsession with his ashy legs, while officially announcing a partnership with the global skincare brand CeraVe. Durant gave some hilarious replies to tweets posted by fans. By leaning into the meme culture rather than fighting them, the 15-time All-Star has successfully monetized one of the most persistent jokes in his NBA career.Kevin Durant via his X account on Thursday posted, “Y’all keep bringing up my legs…might be time to address it with @cerave? #ad.” But to understand how and what led to this moment, let’s rewind to November 2021.During a game, a close-up photo of Durant’s dry, cracked ankles went viral. This led to NBA fans’ roast show. But Durant’s performance that night remained elite, a fact he pointedly highlighted in his new promotional video.“I had 35 points on 12 shots that night. That is way more important than my ashy ankles,” remarked Durant.The partnership with the global skincare brand CeraVe, owned by L'Oréal, marks a significant branding shift for Durant. In the clip, Durant responds with a shrug and a background cash register sound to a fan tweet that said, “Going to be the first NBA player with a lotion deal.”In December 2025, on an episode of the Unguarded podcast, the 37-year-old admitted that he had stopped minding his grooming. He said, “I really used to care at one point about like, ‘Man, let me get a [haircut] this week. Then after a while, I was like, ‘I'm way more relaxed when I'm just not giving a f***.’ I just stopped getting cut. Stopped lotioning.”Now, from that to this partnership, Durant’s laid-back attitude and raw honesty have laid the perfect foundation for an ad campaign with a global skincare brand.While Durant is making headlines for his skin, his on-court production for the Houston Rockets remains stellar. Playing in his 18th NBA season, Durant is averaging 26.5 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 4.5 assists per game while shooting at an efficiency of 51.4% from the field and above 40% from the arc.Currently, Durant sits at 6th place in the NBA’s all-time scoring list, a feat that he recently achieved. He is just 556 points away from surpassing Michael Jordan and entering the league elite 5.",Kevin Durant turns “ashy legs” joke into skincare deal with CeraVe.

When Kevin Durant went candid on how playing beside Kobe Bryant changed his understanding of leadership and pressure

How Kobe Bryant’s historic 81-point night strengthened Kevin Durant’s bond with his father?

Kevin Durant’s NBA career has been shaped by many great players, but none appeared larger than the late Lakers legend Kobe Bryant . Growing up in a league transitioning from one generation to another, Durant admired and looked up to players who showcased hard work, focus, and a strong competitive spirit, and Kobe represented all of that.Over the years, Durant’s admiration evolved into something deeper. With time, what started as looking up to a legend turned into a relationship built on competition and respect. Their connection later became one of the most meaningful connections in today’s NBA As Kevin Durant entered the NBA in 2007 with the Seattle SuperSonics, his relationship with Kobe Bryant gradually began to shift. During the 2012 U.S. Olympics, that was held in London, playing on the same team alongside Bryant allowed Durant to see Bryant’s leadership up close.“I did idolize Kobe Bryant. I studied him, wanted to be like him. He was our Michael Jordan”, Durant once said, reflecting on the relationship he shared with Bryant. After Bryant’s retirement from the NBA, Durant continued to reflect on the influence Braynt had over him. He often spoke about how Bryant helped him understand leadership and pressure.Kobe Bryant’s famous 81-point game against the Toronto Raptors is remembered as one of the greatest scoring performances in NBA history.For Kevin Durant, that night carried a meaning that helped strengthen his relationship with his father. What started as a simple decision to watch basketball late at night slowly turned into a memory Durant still holds close. At the time, Durant was just a teenager, still figuring out his own dreams.“It was going close to midnight as he was going up to 81. My dad had just bought the NBA package that year for the first time, and we were so excited in the house watching games. We finally said, you know what, we’re going to stay up a little bit longer and watch some Lakers basketball”, Durant said.Durant's relationship with his father wasn't always easy growing up. “That was a great decision by us. Me and my dad, that brought us closer as a father and son, to be watching that live like that”. What a memorable time. Somebody who set the standard for all of us basketball players, what a moment”, Durant once stated. When Kobe passed away, Durant honored the loss as deeply personal, like losing a mentor rather than just a basketball legend.","Kobe Bryant’s 81-point game against the Toronto Raptors is remembered as one of the greatest scoring performances in NBA history.

Isiah Thomas is glad that Dallas traded Mark Aguirre to the Pistons

Mark Aguirre's unceremonious trade from Dallas

On February 15, 1989, the Detroit Pistons found their missing piece through a trade with the Dallas Mavericks that sent Mark Aguirre to the Motor City. And the rest is history.In a special halftime ceremony on Thursday, when the Mavericks hosted the Hornets, the franchise also retired Mark Aguirre’s #24 jersey, honoring his career from 1981-89. He was the only 5th player whose jersey the Mavericks have retired.Mark’s childhood friend and former teammate, Isiah Thomas, was also in attendance and took the opportunity to send a thank-you note to Dallas, appreciating Aguirre’s trade in 1989 that sent him to the Pistons.The Hall of Famer, Isiah Thomas, during Mark Aguirre’s #24 jersey retirement on 29th January at American Airlines Center, acknowledged that the Bad Boys era in Detroit would have never reached its summit without the Mavericks' cooperation. The trade, which sent Detroit's Adrian Dantley and a first-round pick to Dallas, remains one of the most lopsidedly successful mid-season moves in league history.Thomas talked about the impact of the trade and how Aguirre’s arrival shifted the Pistons from contenders to champions stated: “I wanna thank the Mavericks and make sure we get this on television. So, I wanna thank the Mavericks organization, the city of Dallas, because if Mark Aguirre doesn’t come to the Detroit Pistons, we never win a championship.He is the reason why it all happened and the way it all worked out. When he came, we were six games behind Cleveland in the Central Division. After he came, we went 37-4 for the rest of the way and ended up winning the championship. That’s how good he was. So, thank you, Dallas. Thank you, Mavericks.”Thomas’ statement is backed by numbers. Before the trade, Detroit was 31–13 but trailed the Cleveland Cavaliers in the standings. Following Mark’s acquisition, the Pistons finished the season on a blistering 32–6 run (completing a 37–4 stretch including the early playoffs), finishing with a 63–19 record.Mark Aguirre was traded due to personality clashes in Dallas and was labelled as difficult, despite being a 3 time NBA All-Star and averaging 24.6 points per game. In comparison, while with Detroit, his scoring dropped from his career average of 20.0 PPG to 15.5 PPG in the 1989 playoffs, but his chemistry with Thomas was the building block of a championship dream.The Pistons swept the 1989 NBA ring with a 4–0 against the Lakers, with Mark Aguirre averaging 7.5 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 1.5 assists. The following year, during the 1990 playoff, Mark played a crucial starter role and averaged 11 per game helped Pistons compete in their 2 consecutive NBA championship finals. In a dominating fashion, the Pistons registered a 4-1 victory over the Trail Blazers to win back-to-back rings. This cemented Mark Aguirre's legacy that started with a phone call to Dallas.",Mark Aguirre's #24 jersey was retired by the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday. Former teammate Isiah Thomas thanked the Mavericks for their cooperation in the trade that sent Mark to the Detroit Pistons in 1989.

Was Lindsey Vonn injured before Milano Cortina? Crash raises concern days before Winter Olympics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/was-lindsey-vonn-injured-before-milano-cortina-crash-raises-concern-days-before-winter-olympics/articleshow/127802942.cms,"Was Lindsey Vonn injured before Milano Cortina Crash raises concern days before Winter Olympics (Image via Getty)

What Lindsey Vonn’s crash means for her Olympic plans

Lindsey Vonn suffered a worrying crash during her final downhill World Cup race just one week before the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics, creating uncertainty around her Olympic readiness. The 41-year-old American lost control after landing a jump, slid into the safety nets, and was visibly limping while keeping weight off her left knee. Medical staff attended to her on the slope before she cautiously made her way down and entered a medical tent. The race itself was later canceled after three of the first six competitors crashed amid poor visibility and challenging conditions.The incident raised immediate concern because this was scheduled to be Vonn’s final downhill appearance before the Olympic opening ceremony. She had been skiing aggressively and was among the early leaders, posting one of the fastest splits at the first checkpoint before the error. With her first Olympic race, the women’s downhill, set for February 8, questions now surround her physical condition, especially since no official injury diagnosis has been released.The timing of the fall is especially troubling given Vonn’s recent comeback. After undergoing a partial titanium knee replacement, she returned to top-level competition and delivered one of the strongest seasons of her career resurgence.Entering this race, Vonn was the World Cup’s leading downhiller, recording two victories and three additional podium finishes. That consistency placed her firmly among Team USA’s top medal hopes heading into Milano Cortina.Vonn also has a long track record of significant injury-related issues, specifically her knee injury during the 2013 World Championships. This resulted in Vonn not being able to compete in the 2014 Sochi Olympics due to not being able to recover in time. While she managed to stand and ski away after this latest fall, observers noted her cautious movements, visible discomfort, and hesitation when putting weight on her left knee.Vonn was also planning to compete in a super-G event the following day, which would have been her final race before the Games. That plan now appears uncertain as medical evaluations continue. Women’s alpine skiing at the Olympics will be held in Cortina d’Ampezzo. At this venue, Vonn holds a record 12 World Cup victories, underscoring both her dominance there and the stakes involved.Throughout the next few days, officials and supporters of Team USA will continue to watch for news about how she is doing. With the start of the Olympics approaching, anything less than full recovery could undermine not only preparation and confidence but also likely medal expectations for this impressive skier and Olympic performance.","Lindsey Vonn suffered a worrying crash during her final downhill World Cup race just one week before the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics.

The Maple Leafs are sinking fast. Toronto sits near the bottom of the Atlantic Division with only the Rangers below them in the Eastern Conference standings, a far cry from the playoff expectations that existed when the season began.The slide has sparked questions about whether Auston Matthews might reconsider his future in Toronto. The franchise center signed an extension last year after telling management he would commit as long as things did not go off the rails, and recent weeks have tested that promise.NHL insider Elliotte Friedman addressed the growing speculation on the latest episodes of the 32 Thoughts Podcast, dismissing the notion that Matthews is looking for an exit despite the team's struggles. Friedman understands how bad the situation is in Toronto.""I've been kind of hearing there's been a lot of talk about Matthews and whether or not he wants to stay,"" Friedman said. ""I don't think that's a question.""Friedman referenced his reporting from last week about Matthews telling the organization a year before he could sign his extension that he would stay as long as the situation did not deteriorate beyond repair.Despite the current mess, Friedman believes Toronto has not crossed that threshold.""I had a couple of people ask me about it because I wrote that in that Marner piece last week about how he told them a year before he could sign the extension that he would sign as long as it didn't go off the rails,"" he explained. ""And he did.""The insider made clear that while the season has been disappointing, it would take significantly more dysfunction before Matthews would consider requesting a trade.""I still don't think that's the case,"" Friedman said.

So I don't think that's going anywhere right now.""Toronto faces a critical stretch leading into the Olympic break with questions mounting about roster changes and whether management will make moves at the trade deadline.The Maple Leafs need to string together wins quickly to climb back into playoff contention in a tightly packed Eastern Conference where several teams remain within reach of a postseason spot despite Toronto's current standing near the bottom of the division.",Elliotte Friedman says it will take much more for Auston Matthews to leave Toronto.

Shared history brings Joe Brady and Pete Carmichael together

What it means for Josh Allen and the offense

The Buffalo Bills have made their first major coaching addition under new head coach Joe Brady, hiring veteran assistant Pete Carmichael Jr. as offensive coordinator.The move was reported by NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport and comes just days after Brady was officially introduced as Buffalo’s head coach. Carmichael brings decades of NFL experience and a deep connection to the Sean Payton coaching tree, something that aligns closely with Brady’s own background.Carmichael is best known for his long stint with the New Orleans Saints, where he spent 18 seasons on staff, including 15 as offensive coordinator. He played a key role during the franchise’s most successful era, helping guide the Saints to a Super Bowl victory in the 2009 season.Brady and Carmichael previously worked together in New Orleans from 2017 to 2018, when Brady was an offensive assistant. That shared history is expected to ease the transition as the Bills look to reshape their offense heading into the 2026 season.Most recently, Carmichael served as senior offensive assistant with the Denver Broncos under Sean Payton. His title in Denver was created to bring another trusted voice into the offensive room.Now, he steps into a more prominent role in Buffalo.Despite the hire, Brady is expected to retain play-calling duties. Carmichael will focus on game planning, offensive structure, and weekly preparation, providing experience and stability alongside the first-time head coach.The Bills’ offense remains centered around quarterback Josh Allen, who is recovering from a foot procedure this offseason. With Brady continuing as the primary play-caller, the system should remain familiar for Allen.Carmichael’s arrival adds a veteran presence who has overseen high-powered offenses before. During his time with Drew Brees in New Orleans, the Saints consistently ranked among the league’s best in passing yards and scoring.Buffalo will hope that combination of Brady’s creativity and Carmichael’s experience can help the team take the next step after another playoff disappointment ended the Sean McDermott era.Carmichael’s departure is also significant for the Broncos. He had been one of Payton’s most trusted assistants for nearly two decades. With Denver already making changes to its offensive staff, his exit signals further reshuffling within Payton’s coaching circle.For Buffalo the focus is clear. Brady has made a deliberate first move by surrounding himself with someone he trusts and knows well. As expectations remain high in Western New York, the partnership between Brady and Carmichael will be closely watched.","The Buffalo Bills have hired Pete Carmichael Jr. as their new offensive coordinator.

NHL teams express interest in signing Rangers star Artemi Panarin amidst trade buzz

As the New York Rangers are going through a significant roster shake-up, the team is preparing to move a high-profile player, and they have apparently decided to scratch star forward Artemi Panarin in a 5-2 loss to the New York Islanders at UBS Arena on Thursday. This trade move has prompted at least 14 NHL teams to acquire the Rangers star, as reported by an NHL Insider recently.Earlier, Insiders Jeff Marek and Pierre McGuire discussed potential landing spots for New York Rangers forward Artemi Panarin, who was informed last week by general manager Chris Drury that he will not be offered a new contract by the club.As per reports, Panarin will not play for the New York Rangers in their last two games before the NHL roster freeze for the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026, which begins Feb. 4, 2026. Meanwhile, the Rangers are sitting at the bottom of the Eastern Conference with very limited possibilities to be back in form.The trade buzz around Artemi Panarin has attracted huge traction, with at least 14 teams expressing their interest in signing the New York Rangers star. As Panarin will not play for the New York Rangers in their last two games before the NHL roster freeze for the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026, due to a major roster change, several teams have rooted for the winger to acquire him.NHL Insider Kevin Weekes reported this week that as many as 14 teams have expressed interest in Panarin, including Anaheim, Los Angeles, San Jose, Vegas, Dallas, Utah, Colorado, Minnesota, Seattle, Toronto, Carolina, Washington, Tampa Bay, and New York Islanders. “Per sources, as of today, I’m told the following have expressed interest in Panarin: ANA, LA, SJ, VGK, DAL, UT, COL, MIN, SEA, TOR, CAR, WAS, TBL, NYI. More clubs will join, and importantly player has to approve any move first,” the NHL Insider posted on Twitter.As per reports, among them, the current Stanley Cup champions Florida Panthers, have gained traction as a team, and according to NHL insider Pierre LeBrun, the Panthers sit near the top of Panarin’s personal list, due to the team’s approach and recent success. “If I had to think of a team that would probably be number one on Panarin’s list, I would say the Florida Panthers, like almost every other player in the league,” LeBrun said.Besides, Artemi Panarin is in the final year of his seven-year, $81.5 million contract, with $11.64 million in average annual value. Now, it will be interesting to witness which team will choose Panarin with a good trade deal that a star player like Panarin highly deserves, and if it matches his expectations.","Artemi Panarin will not play for the New York Rangers in their last two games before the NHL roster freeze for the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026, due to a major roster change.

What led to Michael Brennan’s disqualification

""more than what is permissible under the rule,""

A tough setback in an otherwise promising season

Michael Brennan was in position to win his first title as a pro until he was disqualified from the Farmers Insurance Open for a serious rules violation. One of the more promising young talents in the game, the 23-year-old opened his round at Torrey Pines with a solid two-under-par 70 and, while he was looking good to make the cut, had even higher aspirations.However, what should have been a fairly easy homecoming turned into an excruciating wake-up call, a reminder of just how cruel the pettifoggery of professional golf can be. The impressive day for Brennan ended almost before it began when officials disqualified him from the tournament after the round for a violation involving equipment.It was a breach of Model Local Rule G-11, which covers the type and size of green-reading materials allowed for use in competition. If implemented, golfers would be allowed to only use permissible yardage books and hole-location sheets, with any form of handwriting only their own notes made at any time while practicing or playing.Brennan's materials wereaccording to tournament officials. The actual details weren't made public, but it was serious enough to receive a two-stroke penalty, followed by disqualification for a second violation.And that is a rule that is heavily enforced on the PGA Tour as governing bodies continue to try to stem the tide of the reliance on sophisticated green-mapping programs and other data-driven devices. Brennan had completed his round when the violation was identified, but he was still taken off the leaderboard.Brennan had been gaining momentum over the past year, making this ruling a setback. Having solidified his place on the PGA Tour with impressive outings on the secondary circuit, he added his first win as a pro late last season and rode into '26 with momentum.It was just the third tournament of the new season for him, which begins with the Farmers Insurance Open, held yearly at Torrey Pines Golf Course. His on-course game looked promising with a few flashes, but the DQ taught him a lesson about how cruel professional golf can be on the operational side of the game.",Michael Brennan was disqualified from the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines. The 23-year-old was found to have used more green-reading equipment than permitted. Brennan was in position to win his first title as a pro.

Same-game parlay ideas

Thein Washington on. The Lakers are fighting for playoff position in the West, while the Wizards are near the bottom of the East. Because of that gap, sportsbooks have made Los Angeles a clear favorite.Even so, this is not only about picking the winner. The size of the spread, Washington’s recent results at home, and the high scoring expectation all create different betting options beyond the moneyline.Most books list the Lakers around -344 to -350 on the moneyline. The Wizards are roughly +271 to +300. The point spread usually sits between Lakers -7.5 and -9.5. The total is around 229.5 to 230 points. These numbers say the Lakers are expected to win, but not necessarily by double digits.The Lakers enter at 28-18. They score efficiently and shoot close to 50 percent from the field as a team. Points are rarely their problem. Defense has been less steady. They allow about 116 to 117 points per game, which keeps many of their games high scoring.Washington is 12-34 and has one of the weakest defenses in the league, giving up around 122.8 points per game.That is a bad sign against a strong offensive team. The Wizards score about 113 to 114 points per game. In this matchup they are projected to shoot well below the Lakers’ efficiency. Turnovers also hurt them. They average about 15.2 per game, which can lead to easy baskets the other way.The Lakers have won six of their last seven games. Over the season they are 24-22 against the spread and have covered four of their last six. Large spreads have been harder for them. When favored by nine points or more, they are 3-5 against the spread.Washington just ended a nine-game losing streak with two straight wins. In both games they also covered. At home, the Wizards have covered in four of their last five games. For the full season they are 20-26 against the spread and 13-17 when getting nine or more points.Los Angeles is the better team and should win most of the time in this spot. Many projections land near a 120-114 Lakers win. That is a margin of about six points. It is enough to win the game but close to the lower end of the spread.That makes Lakers -7.5 easier to back than -9.5. It also keeps Wizards +9 in play for bettors who expect a close finish.The total around 230 is based on two things: the Lakers score well and the Wizards defend poorly. Recent meetings between these teams have often gone over. In the last four matchups, the Lakers have averaged 126 points. Several projections place the combined score in the low to mid-230s. Because of that, over 229.5 is a reasonable lean, especially if the number drops slightly.Dončić carries the Lakers’ offense. He averages about 33.6 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 8.7 assists for the season. In his last five road games he has been even better across all three categories. Against one of the worst defenses in the league, his volume should stay high.Common options are over 31.5 points, over 8.5 assists, or over 7.5 rebounds. A triple-double bet is a higher risk choice but fits the matchup.Washington struggles to protect the rim and secure rebounds, which suits his game. Overs on around 21.5 points and 10.5 rebounds are logical plays. Blocks can also be in play if the line is around 2.5.If Washington falls behind, its main scorers should take more shots. Points plus rebounds props for a lead scorer or young big can benefit from the extra attempts. Team turnovers are another angle. With their season average above 15 per game and the Lakers playing at a quick pace, an over on Wizards turnovers is worth a look.For a straight win, the Lakers are the safer pick. For the spread, Lakers -7.5 is more comfortable than -9.5, while Wizards +9 has value if the game stays close. For the total, over 229.5 matches both teams’ profiles. For props, Dončić scoring or assist overs and Davis points or rebound overs are the clearest matchup plays.Also read: Will Luka Doncic play tonight vs Washington Wizards? Latest injury report on the Los Angeles Lakers Star (January 30, 2026) One option is Lakers to win, over 229.5 total points, and Dončić over 31.5 points.

"NHL Trade Rumors: Detroit Red Wings target Nazem Kadri, Charlie Coyle and Robert Thomas for second-line center role",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-detroit-red-wings-target-nazem-kadri-charlie-coyle-and-robert-thomas-for-second-line-center-role/articleshow/127809560.cms,"Nazem Kadri (Image Via Twitter)

What are the Detroit Red Wings’ best options at center ahead of trade deadline?



This was INEVITABLE...

The Detroit Red Wings are searching for a second-line center who can improve their roster before the upcoming NHL trade deadline. The team has identified Nazem Kadri, Charlie Coyle, and Robert Thomas as possible acquisition targets who can provide both veteran experience and high-impact young talent.The team is currently examining immediate roster requirements while its general manager, Steve Yzerman, investigates potential trades. The Red Wings will use their trade options to decide between short-term solutions and blockbuster deals, which will determine the team's playoff success this season.TSN's Darren Dreger has reported that Nazem Kadri from the Calgary Flames has expressed to the team his willingness to accept a trade. Kadri has consistently produced 60-70 points when playing a top-six role. The player possesses a three-year contract that costs the team $7 million, which allows the Detroit Red Wings to use him together with defenseman Zach Whitecloud (whom they obtained from Calgary in the Rasmus Andersson trade) to fulfill two roster requirements.According to The Athletic's Pierre LeBrun, Charlie Coyle has become a main target for teams seeking to acquire him through trade.The 33-year-old veteran center has 35 points in 52 games this season. The Detroit Red Wings can use his $5.25 million cap hit and upcoming unrestricted free agency status to finalize a temporary contract extension through a trade deal.Daily Faceoff’s Frank Seravalli reports that Robert Thomas, who plays for the St. Louis Blues, possesses the ability to change Detroit's top two forward lines because he plays center at a high level. The trade package would require Justin Faulk, who plays defense, to be included, but the team would need to give away multiple high draft picks, together with their best emerging players.The Detroit Red Wings need to evaluate three factors, which are experience and cost, and long-term potential, when selecting a second-line center. The team received two dependable short-term options through Kadri and Coyle, yet Thomas would provide a greater impact. The NHL trade deadline activities will determine how aggressively Detroit operates, which will establish its playoff path.","The Detroit Red Wings are searching for a second-line center before the NHL trade deadline.

“put on a pedestal”

Pokelawls questions Emiru’s silence amid ongoing controversies

“alarming”





Pokelawls, a Twitch streamer, has reignited the debate among the streaming community by questioning why content creator Emiru has not received any backlash for being silent about the serious controversies surrounding Tectone and Lacari. Pokelawls was heard in one of his recent streams questioning why Emiru is still beingwhen she has previously worked with both of these content creators and has chosen to remain silent about the controversies instead of making a public statement.The situation is rooted in Emiru’s past collaborations with Tectone and Lacari, including podcast appearances and gaming sessions. While both creators have since been surrounded by major controversies, Emiru, an OTK member, has neither unfollowed them on social media nor publicly addressed the issues. Pokelawls suggested that this lack of response has gone largely unquestioned, leading fans and critics alike to debate whether remaining silent in such situations sends an unintended message.Pokelawls specifically pointed to the allegations made against Tectone by his former partner Pinkchyu, which included claims of sexual assault and harassment. These allegations resulted in a protective order and ultimately led to Tectone’s exit from OTK in late 2024. Despite the seriousness of the claims and their impact on the wider community, Emiru has not commented publicly on the situation, something Pokelawls described asgiven her proximity to the people involved.He also highlighted Lacari’s recent bans from Twitch and Kick after a stream incident in which a Notepad file containing links to CSAM was accidentally shown on screen. Lacari initially downplayed the situation before later apologizing and entering treatment. Once again, Emiru chose not to comment or distance herself publicly, which Pokelawls argued stands in contrast to how other creators are often scrutinized for similar silence or associations.Pokelawls’ statements have contributed to a broader online discussion regarding double standards in online streaming culture. While some online viewers share Pokelawls’ opinion on the matter, others disagree and think that content creators are not necessarily required to address issues they are not a part of, even if they have worked with the people involved.Ultimately, the debate brings to light a growing conflict within online communities regarding responsibility, visibility, and the expectations of popular content creators. Although Emiru has yet to respond, Pokelawls’ comments have ensured that the debate regarding silence and accountability is anything but finished.","Pokelawls, a Twitch streamer, questioned why content creator Emiru has not received any backlash for being silent about the serious controversies surrounding Tectone and Lacari.
