'Tu suicide kar le': Paralympics champion Navdeep Singh reveals heart-wrenching past,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/others/tu-suicide-kar-le-paralympics-champion-navdeep-singh-reveals-heart-wrenching-past/articleshow/113360616.cms,"WATCH:

NEW DELHI: Navdeep Singh , the Paralympics gold medalist, shared a powerful story of resilience and triumph at the Paris Games. Initially securing a silver medal, Navdeep’s achievement was later upgraded to gold, marking a historic milestone in his athletic career. His remarkable performance in the men's javelin F41 final at the 2024 Paralympic Games brought immense pride to the nation.However, the road to his success was filled with personal challenges, which Navdeep opened up about during an emotional podcast interview.Born with dwarfism, Navdeep endured severe criticism and societal rejection throughout his life. In the podcast, he revealed the hurtful taunts he faced because of his condition. He shared how some people went as far as to suggest that he should consider suicide, dismissing his potential and undermining his worth.“Aapko kya lagta hai hume hausla kaha se aata hai? Jab wo bolte hain ki tu kuch nahi kar sakta. Isse acha to tu suicide kar le. Ye kya jeewan hai tera [Where do you think we get our courage from? When they say you can't do anything. It's better if you just commit suicide. What kind of life is this for you?],” Navdeep recalled, recounting the harsh words he had to endure.Instead of breaking him, these brutal comments only fueled Navdeep’s determination to prove his critics wrong. His gold medal at the Paris Paralympics wasn’t just a victory in sports, but a bold statement against discrimination and doubt.Navdeep’s triumph came when he launched the javelin to a distance of 47.32 meters in the final, clinching the prestigious gold medal. His victory silenced those who doubted his ability due to his condition.During the podcast, Navdeep also became emotional when discussing his late father, who had been a pillar of support throughout his journey.“Shuruwat unhone karwai thi. Har jagah saath they [He was the one who got me started. He was with me every step of the way],” Navdeep said, reflecting on his father's impact, though he is no longer alive to witness his son's ultimate success.","Navdeep Singh won gold in the men's javelin F41 final at the 2024 Paralympic Games.

When 18-year-old Sachin Tendulkar exhibited a batting masterclass at the WACA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/when-18-year-old-sachin-tendulkar-exhibited-a-batting-masterclass-at-the-waca/articleshow/113360102.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian batting legend Sachin Tendulkar had a remarkable cricketing career in Australia , where he built a reputation as one of the greatest batsmen of all time.Sachin's performances in Australia, particularly against the formidable Australian bowling attack, stand out as some of the most iconic moments in cricket history.When Tendulkar landed in Australia as an 18-year-old in 1991, he already had a reputation of being a batting wonder-kid, who had saved a Test for India against England in Manchester in 1990.And by the time the Indian team reached Perth for the fifth Test of the series, Tendulkar had already given the Australian public glimpses of his marvellous batting genius with a swashbuckling unbeaten 148 in the third Test in Sydney.But what unfolded that day at the WACA Ground on the bounciest pitch in the world at that time, was a batting masterclass against a bowling attack that had the likes of Craig McDermott, Merv Hughes , Paul Reiffel, Mike Whitney and Tom Moody. And that it came from an 18-year-old when only four of his teammates reached double figures in that innings, showcased a very mature head on very young shoulders.Batting after Australia's 346, Tendulkar arrived at the crease with India at 69/2. The Aussies tried to bounce him out, but Tendulkar dug in deep and displayed an array of shots consisting of cuts and pulls, smashing 16 fours to reach his third Test hundred.With India folding up for 272, Tendulkar's was the last wicket to fall. Though India lost the Test by 300 runs, Tendulkar's innings is still regarded as the one of the best knocks played by an overseas batsman in Australia.Tendulkar's rivalry with Australian legends like Shane Warne Glenn McGrath , and Brett Lee is a highlight of his career. Warne once mentioned that bowling to Tendulkar in India was his worst nightmare, especially after Tendulkar's counterattacking innings during the 1998 series.Tendulkar's performances in Australia solidified his place as one of cricket's all-time greats. His ability to dominate the best bowlers on challenging pitches earned him immense respect, even among Australian fans.","Sachin Tendulkar had a remarkable cricketing career in Australia.

"3 Reasons Why Hell in a Cell Tag Team Match Between Cody Rhodes, Roman Reigns and The Bloodline 2.0 Would Be perfect for Bad Blood 2024",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/3-reasons-why-hell-in-a-cell-tag-team-match-between-cody-rhodes-roman-reigns-and-the-bloodline-2-0-would-be-perfect-for-bad-blood-2024/articleshow/113372142.cms,"Here are three reasons why these are the perfect opponents for a Hell in a Cell match

1) Cody Rhodes and Roman Reigns are both feuding with the Bloodline 2.0

2) Cody Rhodes has never had the chance to punish Solo Sikoa

3) Roman Reigns needs help to take the Ula Fala back from Solo Sikoa

SmackDown finally made its debut on the USA Network tonight and to kick things off we got to see Cody Rhodes defend his WWE Championship against Solo Sikoa in a steel cage match. Solo never rolls alone, and this time was no exception. Even though he lost the match to Cody, he had his goons from the Bloodline 2.0 launch an assault on the champ.Luckily, Roman Reigns showed up and beat the Bloodline together with the help of Rhodes.Nick Aldis liked what he saw and presented Reigns and Cody with a contract. At the end of the show, both Cody and Roman signed the contract and are now set to face Solo Sikoa and Jacob Fatu at Bad Blood 2024 . Today we’ll be taking a look at three reasons why this fated encounter would be perfect as a Hell in a Cell match. Let’s get into it.Also Read: Masters Of ‘Hell in a Cell’: How The Undertaker and Triple H Revolutionized The Devil's Playground Cody Rhodes and Roman Reigns have put their differences aside after a legendary feud and have now joined forces to take down The Bloodline 2.0. Both Rhodes and Reigns have a score to settle with Solo Sikoa and his enforcer Jacob Fatu who has been an absolute menace to many on the main roster.This feud involving Roman, Rhodes and Solo has seen championship matches and a handful of PLE main events. Now, WWE has the opportunity to finally let these superstars rip into each other, but something of the sort will only be possible if they compete in a Hell in a Cell match. Nothing gives these stars a better opportunity to punish each other for everything that has unfolded over these past few months.We’ve already seen how Hell in a Cell has immortalized plenty of rivalries in the past, now it could be time for Rhodes, Roman Reigns and Solo Sikoa to write their name in the history books.Cody Rhodes has a total of three title defenses against Solo Sikoa alone. The two have been fighting against each other ever since Rhodes was feuding with Roman while he aimed to be champ. Now, Cody might have won more matches against Solo, but he has never had the opportunity to punish him for all his mischief. This is because Solo always has backup with him.Tama Tonga, Tonga Loa and his enforcer, Jacob Fatu are always looking out for Solo, so no one can give him the punishment he deserves. But, all of this can be changed if Cody Rhodes and Roman Reigns take on Solo Sikoa and Jacob Fatu in a Hell in a Cell match. This will give Cody enough opportunities to exact revenge on Solo and give him the beating he so thoroughly deserves.Roman Reigns has dubbed himself as the Original Tribal Chief, but so far he has been unable to take his Ula Fala back from the clutches of Solo Sikoa. Reigns got close once and even had the Ula Fala in the palm of his hands. Unfortunately, he was ambushed by Solo’s goons from the Bloodline 2.0 and Sikoa managed to hold on to the Ula Fala.Now, it is quite obvious that this will be the result if Roman keeps heading in without any help. But at Bad Blood 2024 Roman won’t be without help. Now, if the match between him and Rhodes and Solo and Fatu ends up being a Hell in a Cell match, he can claim the Ula Fala back safely. All Roman and Rhodes have to do is beat Solo and Fatu inside the cage, and then deal with Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa.It seems like a long shot, but after a brutal Hell in a Cell loss, Solo and Fatu won’t be able to help the other two out. This will also be perfect to end Rhodes’ feud with Solo Sikoa, which will allow WWE to focus on the Bloodline wars. Hell in a Cell at Bad Blood 2024 could lead to a lot of excitement in the Bloodline’s story, and that alone is reason enough to make it happen.Also Read: Devil's Brutality: 5 most brutal Hell in a Cell Matches","SmackDown made its debut on the USA Network tonight.

NEW DELHI: One centimetre. That was the agonising difference which kept India's star javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra from reclaiming a second Diamond League Final title in Brussels. It was the distance which separated Neeraj from eventual champion, Grenada's Anderson Peters , and a top podium finish on a cold and windy Saturday night in the Belgium capital.In the end, double Olympics medallist Neeraj narrowly missed out on the title after finishing second with a best throw of 87.86m on his third attempt, falling just 0.01m short of Grenadian's effort of 87.87m – achieved on his very first heave of javelin.Germany's Julian Weber, who threw 85.97m, finished third despite an underwhelming 77.75m on his last attempt.With his runner-up finish, Neeraj brought the curtains down on another successful 2024 athletics season, during which he finished second at the Doha Diamond League and won Paris Olympics silver medal. He also registered three throws beyond the 89m-mark this season.Neeraj's series of throws read 86.82m, 83.49m, 87.86m, 82.04m, 83.30m and 86.46m. Anderson came up with efforts of 87.87m, 86.96m, 85.40m, 85.85m, 84.11m and 87.86m -- the last one matching Neeraj's mark.The reigning World and Asian Games champion had won the Diamond League trophy in 2022. This was Neeraj's fifth appearance in the DL Final. He finished seventh in 2017, fourth in the following year and won the crown in 2022 with an 88.44m throw. Last year, he finished second behind Jakub Vadlejch with an effort of 83.80m.Neeraj later revealed that he competed in the Brussels DL Final with a broken hand while expressing his displeasure over not meeting his own expectations this season.""As the 2024 season ends, I look back on everything I've learned through the year - about improvement, setbacks, mentality and more. On Monday, I injured myself in practice and x-rays showed that I had fractured the fourth metacarpal in my left hand. It was another painful challenge for me. But with the help of my team, I was able to participate in Brussels,"" Neeraj wrote on 'X'.""This was the last competition of the year, and I wanted to end my season on the track. While I couldn't meet my own expectations, I feel this was a season in which I learned a lot. I am now determined to return, fully fit and ready to go. I want to thank all of you for your encouragement. 2024 has made me a better athlete and person. See you in 2025,"" he added.Neeraj has had his fair share of struggles this season, revealing after his medal-winning show in Paris that he was carrying a groin injury coming into the Games which hampered his performance. Neeraj is expected to consult doctors upon his return to India and will look to recover and rehabilitate before commencing another athletics season.It was a tough night for all the competitors in Brussels as Weber put out later. ""It was rather cold and, in the warming-up area there was no track, only grass. When we come to the stadium, the track is rather hard and the difference is big, so that made it a little difficult for us javelin throwers,"" he said after the event.",Neeraj Chopra misses out on second Diamond League Final title in Brussels.

, good spin attack should help visitors challenge India in Test series

FIGHTING SPIRIT IN THE GROUP

SPIN STRENGTH

EXPERIENCE IN THE RANKS

CHENNAI: After conquering Pakistan for the first time, Bangladesh arrived in Chennai on Sunday with renewed hope ahead of their next long-format assignment in India. Having achieved half of a south Asian 'double' that once appeared impossible - winning Test series in Pakistan and India - Najmul Hossain Shanto 's Bangladesh now have a spring in their step.Bangladesh have shown that they have it in them to punch above their weight and India cannot afford to take the visiting team lightly in the forthcoming two-match contest, beginning with the game at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Thursday.Bangladesh displayed a never-say-die attitude when the chips were down in the recent Pakistan series; the best case in point being the miraculous recovery they produced in the second Test in Rawalpindi.The Shanto-led side turned the tables in stunning fashion after tottering at 26-6 while responding to Pakistan's first innings total of 274. Even in the first Test, Bangladesh never gave up; they emerged victorious by 10 wickets after Pakistan managed to post a huge first-innings score of 448-6 declared.A similar fighting spirit will be much needed in the Chennai Test, if Bangladesh are to execute what Shanto is expecting of them. ""We want to play well on all five days, that is our goal. We want to get the result in the last session of the Test match. At that time, the match can go in any direction. It is an opportunity (first Test victory in India), we will play for the win,"" Shanto said in the pre-departure press conference in Dhaka.It is to be recalled that Bangladesh ran India close in the second match of the two-game series at home in December 2022.India may have to think twice in case they plan to dish out a rank turner at Chepauk, given the spin strength in the opposition camp. Bangladesh have three potent slow bowling operators in Shakib Al Hasan , Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Taijul Islam , with each one of them capable of feasting in favourable conditions.The pace pack does not have the highest quality, but will draw confidence from their superb show in the second Pakistan Test - the fast bowlers bagged all 10 wickets in the second innings. ""We are in a good place with our bowling attack, both spin and pace. Our pacers are behind them (India's fast bowlers) in terms of experience, but our spin attack is close to theirs. They can bowl in any condition. All I can say is that we will give our 100 per cent,"" said Shanto, who will miss injured left-arm pacer Shoriful Islam In pressure situations, Bangladesh can turn to experienced campaigners like Shakib and Mushfiqur Rahim. Most of the other members in the core group also have enough matches under their belt to handle crunch moments. ""We can make a difference only if we play as a team. The whole team has to play together. As for Shakib, I am hopeful that he will do well. The expectations are always the same with him. He has been in good form with the ball,"" Shanto said.The Bangladesh players are not alien to the conditions as the main members were in action in the 2023 ODI WC contest against New Zealand.","Bangladesh have shown that they have it in them to punch above their weight.

How Sachin Tendulkar mastered the upper cut shot to perfection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/how-sachin-tendulkar-mastered-the-upper-cut-shot-to-perfection/articleshow/113377586.cms,"NEW DELHI: Sachin Tendulkar , one of the greatest cricketers of all time, was known for a wide array of classic shots that demonstrated his technical brilliance and adaptability.Tendulkar's shot-making was a perfect blend of technical mastery and timing. His ability to play a wide range of strokes against all types of bowling made him one of the most feared and respected batsmen in cricket .Tendulkar had one of the most refined techniques in cricket. His balance, footwork, and head position were exemplary. He made sure to get his body in the right position before playing a shot, whether against pace or spin. His compactness at the crease allowed him to play both on the front and back foot with ease, making him equally strong in defense and attack.Tendulkar popularized the uppercut, particularly during the latter part of his career. It involved slicing a short-pitched delivery over the slips or third-man boundary. It became a potent weapon, especially against fast bowlers.There is a video doing the rounds on the internet where Tendulkar talks about how he came up with the upper cut shot and how he mastered it to perfection.Talking about facing short-pitched deliveries from pacers, Tendulkar says in the video, ""We were asked to leave the ball any shorter than that, then to let the ball go, because you cannot be on top of the ball to something which is there. I mean if you look to keep it down then it's exactly at a catching height where the fielders are.""Tendulkar continues, ""So in 2001, we were playing South Africa in Bloemfontein and I thought being on top of the ball is not helping us score runs, why not get under the ball and play over the slip cordon in Test cricket. In Test cricket, very rarely you would find a third man in place, so I felt that was a scoring opportunity rather than letting the ball go because by nature instinctively I wanted to hit the ball and score runs.""Tendulkar's cut shot against fast bowlers like Brett Lee and Shoaib Akhtar was a demonstration of his brilliant hand-eye coordination, quick reflexes, and mastery of the game's technique.Both Lee and Akhtar were among the fastest bowlers of their era, regularly bowling over 150 kmph, but Tendulkar had the skill to turn their pace to his advantage, particularly with his cut shot.Brett Lee, known for his express pace and aggressive bowling, often tested batsmen with short-pitched deliveries outside off-stump. Tendulkar , with his impeccable footwork and technique, would use the pace of Lee to execute his cut shot, playing it late and using the width Lee provided. The late cut was one of Sachin's specialties against Lee, sending the ball racing past backward point or gully.Shoaib Akhtar, known as the "" Rawalpindi Express ,"" bowled with menacing speed and aggression. Tendulkar's ability to deal with Akhtar's pace was evident during the 2003 ODI World Cup and India's tour of Pakistan in 2004. Against Akhtar's fast, short-pitched deliveries outside off-stump, Tendulkar often used the cut shot to exploit the gaps between point and gully.One of the most famous moments in cricket history occurred in the 2003 World Cup when Tendulkar uppercut a short-pitched delivery from Akhtar over third man for a six. Although it was more of an uppercut than a traditional cut shot, it was another demonstration of Tendulkar's brilliance in using pace to his advantage. This shot, in particular, stands out in the minds of cricket fans for its audacity and timing.Tendulkar's ability to play the cut shot late allowed him to use the pace of the bowler, particularly against deliveries outside off-stump. His control over the shot meant that even if it went in the air, it was over the fielders and into the stands.Tendulkar would quickly move his feet into position, getting inside the line of the ball to either play the shot late or early depending on the bounce and pace. This allowed him to manipulate the field with precision.Even against bowlers as fast as Brett Lee and Shoaib Akhtar, Sachin displayed exceptional control, ensuring that the ball was placed in the gaps, often racing to the boundary with little effort.Tendulkar's cut shot against these two fiery fast bowlers exemplified his ability to neutralize extreme pace with finesse and technical superiority. These moments, especially his uppercut shots, remain etched in cricketing folklore.Tendulkar's shot-making was a mix of flawless technique, immense mental strength, and the ability to adapt to every situation. This is what made him one of the most complete and successful batsmen in cricket history.","Sachin Tendulkar's shot-making was a perfect blend of technical mastery and timing. His ability to play a wide range of strokes against all types of bowling made him one of the most feared and respected batsmen in cricket. He popularized the uppercut, particularly during the latter part of his career.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113377580,imgsize-67194,width-400,resizemode-4/113377580.jpg"

In the context of results, India has ticked all the boxes at the Asian Champions Trophy at Hulunbuir, China. Having remained unbeaten in five league matches, India have scored 21 goals - the highest by a stretch - and the four goals conceded are the least among the six teams in the fray.Despite the overriding dominance over the rest of the Asian teams, chief coach Craig Fulton will expect much from the talent he has at his disposal.India seemed to drop intensity in their attacks towards the business end of the league. They started well, routing hosts China 3-0, before registering convincing 5-1 and 8-1 wins against Japan and Malaysia respectively. But they were tested by both Korea (3-1) and Pakistan (2-1).Up against a plucky Korea in the semifinal on Monday, they need to up their game. The young strikers, who were scrappy in patches against Pakistan on Friday, will have to make amends. Collection of aerial balls and stopping inside the striking circle will have to be shored up. The midfield, led by the seasoned Manpreet Singh and Vivek Sagar Prasad, needs to plug the holes which were exposed during the last two league fixtures.On the brighter side, the form of skipper Harmanpreet Singh has been the USP for the defending champions. Apart from stoutly defending the backline, Harmanpreet has also been at the heart of India's penalty corner conversions, which has resulted in five goals. The Indians will also hope for the variations in penalty corners to work better for them.Although India will have the upper hand, Korea is no easy meat. Their forward line is quick on the counter, and they have thrived in the form of their drag flick ace Jihun Yang in penalty corners. With seven goals, Yang is currently the leading goal-scorer of the competition, and he could well prove a handful for goalkeepers Krishan Pathak and Suraj Karkera, who guard the posts equally during a match.""Korea is a tough team, they defend very well and can counterattack fast and skillfully,"" conceded Harmanpreet.In the other semis, Pakistan, who finished second behind India on the points table, will take on China.",India have remained unbeaten in five league matches.

With a combined 30 Grand Slam singles titles, the tennis duo stands as one of the most successful pairs in sports history.Agassi, known for his powerful baseline game and charismatic personality, was a dominant force in tennis during the 1990s, while Graf’s elegance and dominance on the court earned her 22 Grand Slam titles.The couple, who married in 2001, initially kept their relationship low-key despite both being global superstars. Agassi and Graf have since focused on their family and philanthropic efforts, founding schools and engaging in charitable work through the Agassi Foundation.Bastian Schweinsteiger, the German football icon who lifted the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and Ana Ivanovic, a Serbian tennis star and former world No. 1, are one of sports' most adored couples.

SACHIN TENDULKAR - THE RUNOUT THAT TRIGGERED A HUGE RIOT AND EMPTIED AN ENTIRE STADIUM!!

NEW DELHI: The 1999 Kolkata Test between India and Pakistan remains one of the most iconic—and controversial—matches in cricket history due to the controversial run-out of India's hero Sachin Tendulkar involving Shoaib Akhtar The Test was initially scheduled to be the third and final match of the series between India and Pakistan. However, it was later designated as the opening match of the inaugural Asian Test Championship .Pakistan had set a daunting target of 279 for India. The Indian team had a strong start, reaching 143 for the loss of two wickets. However, an unfortunate incident occurred on the fourth afternoon of the match, which marred the spirit of the game.Sachin Tendulkar had scored 7 runs when he played a shot off Wasim Akram towards deep midwicket. He completed two runs, achieving the milestone of 5000 Test runs, and attempted a third. However, substitute fielder Nadeem Khan threw the ball from the deep, hitting the stumps directly.Under normal circumstances, it would have been an easy third run, even with the direct hit. But as Tendulkar was running, he collided with Shoaib Akhtar, who was positioned near the stumps to collect the throw. As a result of the collision, Tendulkar ended up outside his crease, although he might have been just inside at the moment of impact.The on-field umpire, Steve Bucknor, referred the decision to the third umpire, KT Francis. After a prolonged deliberation, Francis declared Tendulkar out. Notably, this series marked the first instance where all officials were neutral.The third umpire reviewed the footage, and despite the crowd's disbelief, Tendulkar was given out. The dismissal was legal under the laws of cricket, but the circumstances were seen by many Indian fans as unfair, as it was clear the collision had slowed Tendulkar down.The crowd at Eden Gardens erupted in anger. Boos filled the stadium, and tensions boiled over. Some spectators even resorted to throwing objects onto the field, halting the game. Security forces had to intervene, and the situation grew so intense that police were deployed to clear the stands.Tendulkar's departure had ignited not just disappointment but fury among the fans, as they believed India's greatest hope had been unfairly removed from the game.After a period of uncertainty, the umpires decided to escort the players off the field, signaling an early break for tea. It was solely due to the heartfelt appeals made by Tendulkar and the ICC president, Jagmohan Dalmiya, that the game was given the green light to proceed.After the interruption, the match continued in an eerie atmosphere. India's batting lineup struggled without Tendulkar, and Pakistan went on to win the Test by 46 runs.","The 1999 Kolkata Test between India and Pakistan remains one of the most iconic—and controversial—matches in cricket history.

""It's going to be a dangerous game. They will push us a lot to show in the field that they deserve to be here. And the northeast players in their team will want to show me and the club that they deserved to be here,"" he admitted at the pre-match press conference on Saturday in Guwahati.""We are playing against a good team with excellent players and a coach.

We have a game plan in place, we need to keep calm and play our game.""While former NEUFC players like Rochharzela and Gaurav Bora might have a reason to impress at Kishore Bharati Stadium in Kolkata on Monday, the Highlanders current recruits like poster boy Parthib Gogoi will be eager to prove otherwise.And with 90% of the squad retained from the last season by the club representing eight northeastern states, the close-knit group that Benali calls a ""small family"" will have their sights on adding to their maiden trophy soon.""After a training recently, we had all the technical staff in the office and I asked ‘do you remember this same day when we started last season?'"" the coach said about their last ISL campaign when they couldn't even match their best-ever shows of making the playoffs.""What we see now is a huge difference. Players are more motivated, focussed on work and they have learnt to suffer. That's very important in football.

The only scare for the home side came in the 43rd minute when Punjab managed to put the ball into the Blasters’ net, but the goal was disallowed after their forward Mushagalusa Bakunga was ruled off-side.Blasters coach Mikael Stahre made a couple of changes during the break by replacing Kwame Peprah and Mohammed Aimen with Jesus Jimenez and Vibin Mohanan, respectively.

His second strike before the break was a well-guided finish from the edge of the box, further cementing Barcelona's control.Dani Olmo and Pedri Gonzalez added to the scoreline in the second half, with Olmo's sublime finish from a tight angle and Pedri's composed effort after being played through by Marc Casado highlighting Barcelona's attacking acumen.Girona, who had a remarkable third-place finish in the previous season, struggled to cope with Barcelona's intensity. Despite Cristhian Stuani's late consolation goal, the hosts were unable to mount a significant challenge, having lost several key players during the summer transfer window.The only blemishes for Barcelona were Gazzaniga's denial of Robert Lewandowski 's chipped effort and Ferran Torres's late red card for a high tackle on Yaser Asprilla. However, these incidents did little to dampen Barcelona's overall dominance and their 100 percent record at the start of the campaign.On Saturday, reigning champions Real Madrid secured a 2-0 win over Real Sociedad, moving them to second place, four points behind Flick's Barcelona.Later on Sunday, Atletico Madrid will host Valencia, while Athletic Bilbao are set to visit Las Palmas.",Lamine Yamal scores twice as Barcelona thrash Girona 4-1.

However, his drastic on-field actions made headlines around the globe.The match started with high tension, as fouls and disputes between players escalated quickly.In the second half, the game turned ugly when a player from one of the teams allegedly assaulted Murta after disagreeing with one of his decisions.The situation got heated, and rather than using a red card to discipline the players, Murta left the field and returned holding a firearm.Watch:Murta, who had the gun in his possession as part of his duties as a law enforcement officer, brandished the weapon in front of players.Players, coaches, and fans were stunned as they tried to de-escalate the situation.Fortunately, no shots were fired, and other match officials and players eventually calmed Murta down, convincing him to put the gun away.The shocking incident didn’t lead to any serious injuries, but it raised concerns about security and professionalism in Brazil’s lower football divisions.Murta later explained that he felt threatened after being assaulted and reacted instinctively as a police officer.Brazilian authorities investigated the incident, and Murta was required to undergo a psychological evaluation to determine his fitness to continue officiating.","Gabriel Murta pulled out a gun during an amateur league game in Brazil.

Chernyshov has his feet on ground as Md Sporing gear up for ISL debut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/chernyshov-has-his-feet-on-ground-as-md-sporing-gear-up-for-isl-debut/articleshow/113371314.cms,"KOLKATA: Mohammedan Sporting , by their coach Andrey Chernyshov ’s own admission, are gearing up for a “historic” beginning. Yet amid the euphoria of debuting in the Indian Super League — as they prepare to host NorthEast United FC at the Kishore Bharati Stadium on Monday — the Russian coach is also keeping his feet on the ground.“It's a good feeling because we are finally at the top level. Last season it was a dream to play in the ISL and now we are here.This is really a special match, a historic match for me and the players,” Chernyshov told reporters on Sunday.The Russian shepherded the black-and-white brigade to the I-League summit in the last season, thus becoming the second team to have gained promotion to the ISL. But being aware of the challenge ahead, he wants to keep the team’s ambitions rather subdued.According to their defender Samad Ali Mallick, the team is raring to go, banking on a good pre-season and youthful exuberance. Interestingly, a number of Mohammedan Sporting players — like Rochharzela, Gaurav Bora, and Joe Zoherliana — have had previous stints with the Highlanders as well. However, an ACL injury to Ghanaian Abdul Kadiri — who was supposed to be the team’s defensive mainstay — has possibly ended his season before the start of ISL, leaving the Russian facing the ground reality more coldly and less excitedly.""It’s easy to say we want to be in the top six, we want to be first or second and so on. But we have not played before in ISL and we need to know where we stand. We have so many young players in the team and they have good futures. But it’s after playing 4-5 matches you start understanding what you need to change in your game and what is needed to win,” Chernyshov further noted.It will be a different beginning for NorthEast United as well.Having announced their intent by winning the Durand Cup a fortnight ago, Juan Pedro Benali’s Highlanders will return to the city of their conquest with more conviction and perhaps carrying the favourites’ tag. However, the NorthEast coach is not in the mood of taking the debutants lightly.“It will be a dangerous game for both teams. Mohammedan SC, playing in front of their fans, will try to show that they deserve to be in ISL, that they deserve it as champions of the I-League.

It was the younger Borg's first win in the Davis Cup, having lost all the three matches he had played earlier. And it came in his first Cup match at home with dad watching, which made it even more special.""It was a great feeling, I could really feel the support of the fans today. And having my dad out there, I feel really happy,"" Borg said.For the Indian team, the first day rout exposed the lack of depth in their ranks. With the country's No. 1 player Sumit Nagal , currently ranked 82, as well as top doubles player Yuki Bhambri unavailable, their hopes of beating Sweden - who are 5-0 in head to head - for the first time ever were dashed even before the first ball was hit.And the ball proved to be a key factor.Captain Rohit Rajpal had spoken in the lead-up to the tie about the surface playing ""medium"" - neither fast nor slow - and how it might suit his players. But the Indians didn't account for the ball changing its character during the course of play.""After a few points, the ball was becoming fluffy and sitting,"" Ramkumar said. ""He (Borg) was staying really back and coming up with great returns."" Rajpal said, quite helplessly, ""Well, we had to do something different. We are not going to beat them from the back of the court. It was a bad day at the office.""The captain also made a pointed remark: ""The idea was not to come in at the net at the right moments, not for the sake of going to the net.""So, while the visitors aimed to take the fight to the hosts and put the pressure on them, the script played out just the opposite way.Ymer, son of Ethiopian immigrants, broke Balaji in the very first game and that set the tone for the rest of the day. Ramkumar, formerly 111 and adept at serve and volley, broke Borg early on but it proved to be false dawn. It had more to do with Borg's nerves.","India's serve-and-volley strategy fails to yield result as Balaji and Ramkumar lose their singles ties.
