NEW DELHI: The Grambusch brothers, Mats and Tom, were writing Germany's comeback scripts for fun at the World Cup last year. It had a happy ending as well. The Germans lifted the trophy in a final that can only be described as 'madness refusing to end'. The penalty shootout went to sudden death and required 14 attempts to give the World Cup its winner and dethrone Belgium.The point of reference is obvious for those having their eyes on Paris. India are playing Germany in the semifinal of the Summer Olympics.A place in the final, confirmation of a medal -- the stakes are pretty high, even higher for India, who haven't played an Olympic hockey final for 44 years and have not won successive hockey medals at the Games for 52 years. And PR Sreejesh will hope that he finishes his career with a medal in the biggest game of his iconic career, an Olympic final.For each of the above to happen, India will have to beat Germany.A little part of the narrative for the Germans is also revenge. The wounds of that epic bronze-medal match at the Tokyo Olympics are fresh at three years old. The Germans sank into the turf after ending on the wrong side of 5-4 final score, while the Indians celebrated a long-awaited return to the Games' podium after 41 years.The storyline of Tuesday's semifinal has enough sub-plots to make any player nervous. But this Indian team has played like one that doesn't carry butterflies requiring Dr. Rajendra Kalra's psychological tricks to settle.Forty-nine years ago, Dr Kalra, a physician settled in Chandigarh, was named as the official doctor of the Indian team travelling to Kuala Lumpur for the 1975 World Cup.Before the final against Pakistan, a couple of players complained to him about a stomach ailment. Reading the players' minds and it coinciding with the enormity of the occasion, Dr Kalra played a psychologist instead of a physician.He asked the organisers for some jaggery and black sesame seeds. Once it was delivered to him, he melted the jaggery, added the sesame seeds to it and rolled the mixture into tiny balls resembling medicine pills.Dr Kalra asked the jittery players to take that before stepping onto the field.It worked. India won the World Cup. But not because of Dr Kalra's pseudo pills, but because of 11 confident players on the field.Back to Paris, this Indian team has come of age.If the win over Australia in the Olympics after 52 years was like claiming lost territory, coach Craig Fulton's men turned its defence into fortresss in the quarterfinal. Playing with 10 men for over 40 minutes after Amit Rohidas was shown the red card, India put adversity to shame by not just holding Great Britain to 1-1 in 60 minutes, but also by stamping its authority in the shootout. India scored all four, Sreejesh saved two. A 4-2 (1-1) win took India to a second consecutive Olympic semifinal.But that Rohidas red card, for flaying his stick in anger across the face of England striker Will Calnan, came back to haunt the Tokyo bronze medallists.The defender, most importantly India's first rusher on penalty-corner defence, was handed a one-match suspension and will sit out of the semifinal on Tuesday.If there is one thing that can make India nervous before running into the Germans, it's Rohidas's unavailability, which hampers rolling substitutions, short-corner defence and a reduced drag-flick backup for skipper Harmanpreet Singh.Where it can also hurt India is in manufacturing counter-attacks after a successful defence of a penalty corner, because one of the midfielders might have to be pulled back to complete the set of five in India's post with Rohidas out on the suspension chair.Perhaps one way to look beyond that disadvantage is that it remains 11 vs 11 on the battlefield. The dugout can take care of the 15 vs 16.The massive occasion reminds of the comment once made by former India coach Michael Nobbs.""You need to put coffins on the sidelines and give it your all when playing for your country,"" the Australian once said.You can't doubt this Indian team about giving it their all. If they can do it for 120 more minutes across two days in the French capital, the 'Holy Grail' will be back to where it belonged for eight Olympic editions, six of those in a row.All roads for the Indians on Tuesday in Paris will lead to the Yves-du-Manoir Stadium, while millions back home cross their fingers.",India play Germany in the semifinal of the Summer Olympics. India haven't played an Olympic hockey final for 44 years and have not won successive hockey medals at the Games for 52 years.

WATCH:

NEW DELHI: The ongoing three-match ODI series between India and Sri Lanka has faced controversy following a Decision Review System (DRS) incident during the second ODI on Sunday. Sri Lanka secured a 32-run victory, taking a 1-0 lead after the first match ended in a tie. The issue arose from a contentious DRS call involving Virat Kohli .Sri Lankan spinner Jeffrey Vandersay 's impressive performance, taking 6 for 33, was pivotal in bowling India out for 208 in 42.2 overs as they chased a target of 241.Despite Vandersay's efforts, attention shifted to a DRS decision that left the Sri Lankan team frustrated.In the 15th over of India's chase, Akila Dananjaya bowled an off-break that sharply spun in, beating Kohli's inside edge. Initially ruled lbw by the on-field umpire, Kohli opted for a review. The UltraEdge technology indicated a spike near the bat, leading TV umpire Joel Wilson to overturn the decision. Kohli's relief was evident as he smiled following the reversed call.The decision did not sit well with the Sri Lankan players. Kusal Mendis expressed his frustration by throwing his helmet to the ground, and Asalanka conveyed his displeasure to the on-field umpire, Raveendra Wimalasiri. Sri Lankan coach Sanath Jayasuriya also came down from the dressing room to discuss the decision with the reserve umpire.Despite the reprieve, Kohli's innings was short-lived. Four overs later, Vandersay bowled Kohli with a flipper that trapped him in front of the middle stump. Although Kohli considered another review, his partner Axar Patel dissuaded him, resulting in Kohli's departure.As Kohli approached the Sri Lankan unit for the customary post-match handshake, Jayasuriya stopped him for an intense but brief chat. The exchange ended amicably, with both men patting each other on the shoulder.India now face a do-or-die situation in the third ODI in Colombo on Wednesday, needing a win to level the series.",Sri Lanka beat India by 32 runs in second ODI in New Delhi.

For the 100m race, advanced technology was employed, utilizing red lines to analyze the photo finish, akin to the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system in football. Torso first, not foot: The analysis revealed that Lyles' chest was the first part of his body to breach the finish line.

PARIS: The world stopped, as did the 80,000 at the Stade de France . Even Noah Lyles and Kishane Thompson - fighting for the crown of the fastest man on the earth - didn’t know. The race had lasted less than 10 seconds, and those minutes of wait that followed felt like an eternity. Till the scoreboard flashed - Noah Lyles.Trailing through the race from start to finish and only leading at the finish line, the man from the United States was the king of 100m.He had edged Jamaican Thompson by five thousandths of a second in a race where eight of the participants ran sub-10. Even world champion and Tokyo silver medallist Fred Kerley, who took the bronze in 9.81s, was barely 0.01s ahead of Akani Simbine, who finished fourth.From the moment Noah arrived at the scene, he looked to be the showstealer. Jumping around and getting the fans on his side, the man from USA tried to tell the world that this stage belongs to him. But those around him were champions in their own right, they were not ready to give an inch.And over the next 10 second blitz, which produced the greatest 100m dash of all time, the first and eighth were separated by 0.12s, the smallest ever gap in an Olympics or Worlds final. Thompson’s foot reached the finish line before Lyles, but the 27-year-old had put his torso forward, which had pipped the Jamaican to the post.""I was like, 'I'm going to be honest, I think you got that one.' But then my name popped up, and I was like, 'Oh my god, I'm amazing',"" Lyles said, when asked what he told Thompson after the photo finish .The sprinter said the moment ""was a lot to deal with"".""I had so many commercials going around and so many people saying that I'm going to be the one. I'm not going to say it's not pressure. Saying that the moment is not bigger than me, that moment was meant for me.""Earlier in the semis, the American star came second to Oblique Seville, who clocked 9.81s, 0.02 ahead of Lyles. ""To be honest, if I'm running 9.83 in the semifinals I'm going to be hard to beat. I called my therapist, and she told me to let go, to let it flow... And I was like, 'Alright I'm going to trust you'.""Lyles also thanked the crowd. ""Oh my god that crowd was amazing. I couldn't have a better crowd."" And over the next 9.8 seconds, he proved why he has become the darling of the crowd.In a tightly contested race, a photo finish occurs when multiple competitors cross the finish line in close proximity.

At the end of the first round, she lost a point due to passivity and narrowly avoided losing her footing, which could have resulted in a 0-3 score. However, she successfully defended herself.Surprisingly, Vinesh did not alter her strategy in the second round and found herself trailing 0-2 after conceding another passivity point to Susaki, who is considered one of the greatest wrestlers in this weight class.Just as it appeared that Vinesh's chances were slipping away, she executed a last-minute inspirational takedown, pushing Susaki out of the mat and pinning her on her back to earn two points.Vinesh was emotional as he sprinted towards her corner and hugged her coach Woller Akos and then let out an emotional war cry.The Japanese team challenged the decision, but when it was overturned, Vinesh was awarded an additional point, resulting in a final score of 3-2 in her favour.","Vinesh Phogat defeated Ukraine's Oksana Livach in the quarterfinals on Tuesday.

Algerian boxer Imane Khelif advances to gold medal match amid gender row at Paris Olympics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/algerian-boxer-imane-khelif-advances-to-gold-medal-match-amid-gender-row/articleshow/112331675.cms,"NEW DELHI: Imane Khelif , the Algerian boxer at the center of a significant gender controversy during the Paris Olympics , emerged victorious in her semi-final bout on Tuesday. Competing in the women's 66kg category, Khelif secured at least a silver medal after defeating Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng, the 2023 world silver medallist, by a unanimous points decision.The match took place in front of an enthusiastic crowd at Roland Garros, who passionately chanted Khelif's name throughout the contest.In a separate weight class, Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting, another boxer involved in the eligibility controversy, is also assured of winning at least a bronze medal. Both Khelif, 25, and Lin participated in the Tokyo Olympics three years prior without any controversy and did not secure medals at that time.The two boxers faced disqualification from the world championships last year after failing to meet gender eligibility requirements. However, they were subsequently cleared to participate in the Paris Olympics.""I am focusing on the competition and other things are not important. The important thing is that I am in the final now,"" Khelif told BeIN Sports.""I am very proud of this new achievement. I gave everything I had. We worked as a team for years and the dream has become a reality. I hope to focus and be up to the responsibility in the dream final.""Khelif, the Algerian boxer, received a thunderous ovation as she stepped into the arena at Roland Garros, which is typically known for hosting Grand Slam tennis tournaments.The venue was packed with a considerable number of Algerian fans waving flags and chanting ""Imane, Imane"" throughout the bout.Khelif's opponent, the Thai boxer Janjaem, who was visibly shorter, took a standing count in the third round after feeling the full force of the Algerian's superior skills.Despite the intense atmosphere, the two fighters showed great sportsmanship at the end of the fight, warmly greeting each other and shaking hands.Khelif celebrated her victory with a dance in the center of the ring, eliciting even more cheers from the crowd.She will face Yang Liu for the gold medal, after the Chinese boxer defeated Taiwan's Chen Nien-chin on points in the other semi-final.The gender controversy surrounding Khelif and another boxer, Lin, began when Khelif defeated Angela Carini in just 46 seconds during her opening bout. Carini, who suffered a severe nose injury, was reduced to tears and forced to abandon the fight. The 2023 world championships, from which both Khelif and Lin were expelled, were organized by the International Boxing Association (IBA). However, due to concerns over the IBA's financial, governance, and ethical practices, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has taken charge of the sport at the Olympic Games.IBA president Umar Kremlev, who has ties to the Kremlin, made a controversial claim during a chaotic press conference, stating that both fighters had undergone ""genetic testing that shows that these are men.""The IOC has strongly defended Khelif and Lin, with president Thomas Bach emphasizing that they were born and raised as women and hold passports reflecting their gender.",Imane Khelif beats Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng in women's 66kg semi-final.

She made quick work of Livach, employing her technical acumen to secure a decisive win just when it was needed most.Facing Cuban opponent Lopez in the semi-final, Phogat exhibited strategic brilliance.

The semi-final was a testament to her tactical prowess and her ability to stay calm under pressure, earning a crucial win to advance to the finals.It was more than just the matches that made this journey remarkable. Off the mat, Phogat had been fighting a far tougher battle. Her credibility was constantly questioned, and she underwent knee surgery less than a year before the Olympics , causing many to doubt her chances of success.But for 18 minutes on Tuesday, Vinesh didn't have the option of failing. After all, she came here as a representative of all those women who have been severely wronged by the wrestling establishment.When Phogat overcame Susaki, she let out a cry of relief and lay flat on her back, a moment of release after immense pressure. In contrast, her coach, Woller Akos, stood teary-eyed on the sidelines. Akos has been by Phogat's side through thick and thin, offering support and serving as a confidant throughout her battle for justice.The past year and a half of Phogat's life have been tumultuous. She became a prominent figure in the protest against former Wrestling Federation of India chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who has faced allegations of sexual harassment.The semi-final bout saw Vinesh maintaining her balance, not allowing the Cuban to get her leg. Her feet were positioned perfectly to avert any crisis.Phogat earned a point for passivity in the first round of her semi-final, which proved beneficial. However, she also received a warning in the second round for not being aggressive enough. True to her nature, Phogat fought back fiercely, targeting Lopez's right leg to gain two points and finishing the match with a leg hold.Vinesh's final is scheduled for tomorrow.",Vinesh Phogat becomes the first Indian woman wrestler to reach the final of the Olympic Games.

She was pitted against Japanese grappler Yui Susaki in the Round of 16 who never tasted a defeat at the international level.Vinesh, however, had a different plan as she caused the most stunning upset of the Olympic Games by bringing an end to the undefeated streak of Sasaki, the world's top-ranked wrestler and the defending Olympic gold medalist, which had spanned an impressive 82 matches.In the first six minutes, the wrestling community was left stunned by her performance.

ONE-MATCH SUSPENSION FOR ROHIDAS

HOW ROHIDAS'S ABSENCE AFFECTS INDIA

The Indian men's hockey team has received a jolt ahead of their Paris Olympics semifinal against Germany and are already at a disadvantage in their quest for a place in the final after 44 years.The Tokyo Olympics bronze medallists will have only 15 players available to play the last-four clash instead of a full squad of 16 after defender Amit Rohidas was suspended for one match following his red card in the quarterfinal against Great Britain.The 31-year-old Rohidas was spotted swinging his stick across the face of British forward Will Calnan in the second quarter of the match on Sunday. The on-field umpire did not rule the offence as serious to get a red card, but Rohidas was shown red and given the marching orders after a video referral.Subsequently, India played the British team with 10 players for more than 40 minutes. However, the Harmanpreet Singh-led side defended heroically, thanks largely to PR Sreejesh's presence in the goalpost, to hold onto the 1-1 scoreline and take the game to a shootout.Goalkeeper Sreejesh once again turned out to be the star, saving two attempts by the GB team in the one-on-one shootout to help India earn a dramatic 4-2 win and a second successive entry into the semis at the Olympics.After the match, India officially raised a concern ""about the quality of umpiring and decision-making"" and citied ""several inconsistencies in officiating"" that ""potentially influenced the game's outcome"".Among the issues raised by India were ""inconsistent video umpire reviews, particularly regarding the red-card decision"" and the fact that the British goalkeeper was being coached from behind the goalpost during the shootout.""Hockey India calls for a thorough review of these matters to uphold the integrity of the sport and ensure fair play in future matches,"" the complaint read.However, later in the evening, the tournament's organising committee handed Rohidas a one-match ban for breaching the FIH Code of Conduct, which means India will have one player less in their usual squad of 16 men for the semifinal against Germany.“Amit Rohidas was suspended for one match for a breach of the FIH Code of Conduct which occurred during the India vs Great Britain match on August 4,” read the official statement by the FIH.“The suspension affects match No. 35 (India’s semi-final match against Germany), where Amit Rohidas will not participate and India will play with a squad of 15 players only.”Rohidas's absence will seriously hamper the Indian defence, their options of drag-flickers on penalty corners and rolling substitutions. Most importantly, the team will miss the rushing skills of Rohidas.He is considered one of the best rushers in the world when it comes to penalty-corner defence, and his absence will force India's chief coach Craig Fulton to alter India's short-corner strategy against Germany.",Amit Rohidas has been suspended for one match by the FIH. The 31-year-old defender was shown a red card in the quarterfinal against Great Britain.

NEW DELHI: India's key defender and first rusher Amit Rohidas will not be able to participate in Tuesday's Olympic men's hockey semifinal against Germany . This is due to the rejection of India's appeal against his one-match suspension by the international body FIH .Rohidas was red-carded in the quarterfinal match, which means India will have only 15 players available for the crucial encounter, a significant setback for the eight-time Olympic champions.The official statement from the FIH, authored by Joshua Burt, stated, ""Amit Rohidas was suspended for one match for a breach of the FIH Code of Conduct which occurred during the India vs Great Britain match on August 4.""The suspension affects match No. 35 (India's semi-final match against Germany), where Amit Rohidas will not participate and India will play with a squad of 15 players only.Hockey India's appeal against Rohidas' suspension was rejected by the International Hockey Federation (FIH) Jury Bench, confirming his absence in the semifinal.The International Hockey Federation (FIH) has selected five Australian hockey officials to be part of the officiating team for the upcoming Olympic hockey tournament in Paris.Interestingly, Joshua Burt, who serves as the Technical Delegate from Australia in the Paris Olympics , portrayed the head coach of the Australian women's team that competed against India in the climactic match of the movie ' Chak de India '.In the film, Burt played the role of a determined and self-motivated coach who consistently created strategic plans to guide his team to triumph.

3rd ODI: Will India stave off Sri Lanka to keep a nearly three-decade long record intact?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/3rd-odi-will-india-stave-off-sri-lanka-to-keep-a-nearly-three-decade-long-record-intact/articleshow/112308862.cms,"The Indian batsmen will need to tactically navigate the spin challenge in the third and decisive ODI on Wednesday to prevent their first series loss to Sri Lanka in nearly three decades, 27 years to be precise. The path has been set by captain Rohit Sharma , and it is up to the rest of the batting lineup to follow the skipper.In his maiden ODI series as head coach, this is definitely not the start Gautam Gambhir would have envisioned, given his emphasis on winning.India were last defeated in a bilateral ODI series against the Lankans in 1997. India haven't lost for 11 series of 50-over internationals between the two teams since then.However, the visitors find themselves in an unfamiliar position, after a tie in the opening match and a 32-run defeat in the second. Winning the three-match series is now beyond India's grasp, and the team will be determined to avoid a defeat in the final match of the series at Colombo 's R Premadasa Stadium on Wednesday.This position of discomfort is brought upon the team largely by their batsmen, who seemed to have been plagued by indecisiveness on a pitch that offered plenty of turn to the spinners.Star batter Virat Kohli epitomized the team's fragility more than anyone else. Besides scoring only 38 runs in two matches, it's the nature of Kohli's dismissals that has raised concerns.Kohli has appeared subdued in the middle, after the explosive starts provided by Rohit in the two games. The master batter within Kohli remained dormant as he struggled against the leg-spin of Wanindu Hasaranga in the first match and Jeffrey Vandersay, who claimed six wickets, in the second, before eventually succumbing to them.Perhaps, Kohli should focus on the happier memories rather than allowing his mind to be shackled by the current challenges. India's success in the middle overs, whether chasing or setting a target, heavily relies on a free-flowing Kohli.Shivam Dube, India's designated spin-basher, failed to read a simple leg-break from Vandersay in the second one-dayer, resulting in an lbw dismissal. Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul, known for their prowess against spinners, have struggled to use their feet and wrists effectively against the Lankan slow bowlers.The solution possibly lies in observing Rohit's batting, not necessarily his approach, but the confidence and strategy behind his innings.Rohit's mastery over the Lankan bowlers, both pace and spin, has been remarkable. His 44-ball 64 was a display of well-calculated strokes that never seemed risky.The team management may reconsider Dube's position in the lineup when deciding the eleven for the match on Wednesday.Given the conditions in Colombo and the nature of the pitch, batting allrounder Riyan Parag's spin bowling can prove more useful than Dube's straightforward medium pace.On their end, the Indian bowlers need to step up their performance in the crucial stages of the game as the previous matches highlight their failure to bowl the hosts out for a low score despite reducing them to 142 for 6 and 136 for 6.","India were last defeated in a bilateral ODI series against the Lankans in 1997.
