Allen Iverson shares posts dedicated to son Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson and wife Tawanna Turner





Former NBA legend, Allen Iverson shares a heartwarming post for his son, Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson on his Instagram. The post contains photos from Isaiah’s childhood, teenage years, and graduation ceremony. Allen went on to praise him saying that he’s the true definition of what a son should be, and the way he always looks out for family is what makes him better than others. He goes on to say how proud of a father he is. However, this post came days after Allen dedicated an entire post for ex-wife, Tawanna Turner.Allen Iverson talks profoundly about his son Isaiah on his recent Instagram post. He talks about Isaiah’s qualities and how he is a son that every father will be proud of.“The true definition of a son,” says Allen as he starts the post, showing how proud he is of Isaiah.However, this post comes days after Allen dedicated an entire post to ex-wife Tawanna Turner, with whom he shares five children, Allen Iverson II, Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson, Dream Alijha, Tiaura, and Messiah Lauren. The post had a montage of the couple’s photos from prom, early court days, and as such. Allen captioned the photo as “HER” followed by heart and crossed fingers emoticons.Allen and Tawanna tied the knot in 2001, and had a happy marriage for quite some years. However, trouble entered their married life in the form of lavish expenditures, Iverson’s questionable parenting skills, and alcohol habits. In 2013, when Iverson retired from the world of NBA, his married life also came to an end. The couple called it quits in 2013 and agreed to co-parenting their kids.However, it seems Allen’s life turned upside down soon after his lady luck left. After retirement, Allen spent all of his fortune on expensive cars, and lavish lifestyle. Due to this, he became bankrupt by 2015. However, things have started taking turn for Iverson as he recently signed a deal with Reebok and agreed to be the Vice President of basketball division for the brand. He had earlier made a lifetime deal with Reebok back in 2001, which brought him $800,000 per year. The contract also had a clause that stated Iverson will get an additional $32 million at the age of 55. Will the new role help Iverson turn the course of events or will he fall back into old habits?

Cam Skattebo's viral moment provokes criticism over NFL history blind spot



Does Cam Skattebo know ball? 🧠

A generation gap or something more?







New York Giants first-year running back Cameron Skattebo became the focus of an unintended NFL tempest—nothing on the field, but for seemingly not knowing anything about the league's greatest legends. In one recent video making its rounds on the internet, Cameron Skattebo can't recognize NFL legends from their pictures, kicking off an emotional Reddit discussion in which fans toggle between anger and empathy.Cameron Skattebo, who played college football at Sacramento State Hornets and Arizona State Sun Devils before the New York Giants drafted him in the fourth round of the 2025 NFL Draft, soon found himself a topic of conversation on Reddit—but not the kind related to his athleticism.In one clip of him now circulating, Cameron Skattebo misidentifies players during a quiz segment. When presented with a picture of Calvin Johnson, better known as ‘Megatron,’ confusion set in.Redditors were both amused and frustrated. One of the top comments stated, “Not knowing Calvin is wild, but an NFL player not knowing Brett Favre is crazy ffs.”Another commenter joked, “Banish him from the league for this,” and others reluctantly empathized, one of them noting, “To be fair, though, Calvin retired when Skattebo woulda been like 13 or 14, and he wasn’t a guy who was in many commercials or broadcast booths.So it’s not thaaaat crazy with all that in mind.”The discussion soon escalated beyond Skattebo, with wider questions about how younger players identify with the history of the league. One commenter wrote that most players don't grow up watching the NFL but rather center on their own development or college careers. “A lot of these guys don't even follow the NFL til they get to the league. Might have been a college fan, or just doesn't watch football,” another Redditor wrote.Even fans conceded trouble identifying helmet-wearing players by face alone. “Not really. I wouldn’t recognize Joe Montana from face alone probably. I definitely wouldn’t recognize megatron from face alone. I think people here are forgetting these dudes play in helmets lol. Outside of a handful of players there’s probably not many non-Eagles I could recognize,” admitted one commenter.Nevertheless, the overall opinion was tilted towards incredulity, particularly in light of Johnson's place in NFL legend.Also Read: ‘I still have more to prove’: Giants rookie Cam Skattebo’s giant ambitions While the NFL fan base in turn roasted and justified Cameron Skattebo's viral blunder, the moment highlighted something greater—the transience of fame, the changing tides of fandom across generations, and the way legacy players disappear from popular consciousness sooner than we want them to.

2026 NBA All-Star Game to go global as Adam Silver greenlights United States versus World format

In a major move to inject new life into the NBA All-Star Game, Commissioner Adam Silver has confirmed that the 2026 edition will feature a “Team USA vs. Team World” format. The decision, designed to boost player motivation and fan engagement, marks a shift from recent attempts that failed to inspire competitive play. The game, set for February 15, 2026, in Inglewood, California, will be broadcast by NBC as part of the league’s new media deal and scheduled to air in the afternoon to align with Winter Olympic programming.Following years of experimenting with All-Star formats, from captain-led drafts to the recent four-team mini-tournament, the NBA is now embracing the league’s international identity to bring back intensity. Commissioner Adam Silver confirmed on FS1’s Breakfast Ball, “Next year, as part of our new media deal, the All-Star Game returns to NBC where it was when we were younger, and it so happens that next season will be smack in the middle of the Winter Olympics. ”Silver further explained, “The lead-in will be Winter Olympic events, and then coming out of the All-Star Game... more Olympic events. So what better time to feature some form of USA against the world?”While the format details are still being finalized, the commissioner admitted, “I’m not exactly sure what the format will be yet. I obviously paid a lot of attention to what the NHL did, which was a huge success.” The NHL’s Four Nations Face-Off has proven that national pride can transform showcase games into must-watch events.The league’s latest All-Star tournament in San Francisco was widely seen as a misfire. The 211–186 final score in 2024 showed the lack of effort. Even the introduction of mini-games and point targets couldn’t raise the stakes. But now, Silver believes he’s found the answer. “Last summer, our Olympic competition was a huge success... USA, Serbia — I loved watching it.”This shift comes with challenges. While about 70% of NBA players are American, the top international talent is undeniable. The last seven MVPs have all been international players. Fans are hyped, imagining Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Victor Wembanyama, and Luka Doncic teaming up to challenge LeBron James , Stephen Curry, and Tyrese Haliburton.Also Read: Not $1.2 billion — LeBron James’ post-retirement priorities will melt every NBA fan’s heart International stars are already fired up. “I would love to. My opinion is that it’s more purposeful,” said Wembanyama in February. “There’s more pride in it. More stakes.” Giannis echoed the sentiment: “I think that would be the most interesting and most exciting format. I would love that... I think it would be fun. That would be the best format.”As Silver confirmed, fans might finally get a fiercely contested All-Star Game again.","The 2026 NBA All-Star Game will feature a ""Team USA vs. Team World"" format.

'A particularly special feeling': Andy Flower hails Virat Kohli, RCB after historic title win





NEW DELHI: The celebrations were in full swing outside Bengaluru's M Chinnaswamy Stadium, with loud cheers, hoots, and roaring chants filling the air as fans gathered in massive numbers to catch a glimpse of their victorious Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) stars. The scenes reflected the joy of a fanbase that had waited 18 years for this moment. On Tuesday night, RCB clinched their maiden IPL title with a six-run win over Punjab Kings in a thrilling final at a packed Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.For franchise icon Virat Kohli , who has been with RCB since the league’s inception in 2008, it was a particularly significant milestone—finally lifting the trophy after years of near misses.RCB players are scheduled to meet Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Wednesday, after which they will head to their home ground, M Chinnaswamy Stadium, for a fan engagement event. Huge crowds have already assembled at the stadium, hoping to witness the team’s moment of glory up close.The Karnataka State Cricket Association has organised a special felicitation ceremony for the RCB squad at the stadium to honour their historic achievement.In videos circulating on social media, the crowd outside the stadium grew so large that Karnataka Police had to use mild force to manage the swelling numbers and maintain order.Tragedy struck during the RCB victory celebrations at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, as reports indicate that seven people, including a child, lost their lives in a stampede. Over 25 others have sustained injuries in the incident, with six individuals reported to be in critical condition.Earlier in the day, the Rajat Patidar-led team was received at the airport by Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar. As the players made their way to the Chief Minister’s office at Vidhana Soudha, fans lined the streets, cheering their champions with unbridled enthusiasm.However, the much-awaited open-top bus parade from Vidhana Soudha to the stadium may be cancelled due to heavy traffic congestion, according to a tweet by Bengaluru Traffic Police. The city's rainy weather and the challenges of crowd control—especially following last night's massive celebrations—also contributed to the uncertainty around the parade.That said, the parade could still happen if Chief Minister Siddaramaiah grants special permission. The open-top bus remains parked near his office, awaiting the final nod.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) won their maiden IPL title on Tuesday.

Controversy around the Imane Khelif’s gold medal at Paris Olympic



IOC calls findings misinformation



Response of World Boxing

Fairness and safety concerns from athletes and federations



Ongoing debate on gender and sport eligibility





A leaked medical report from the 2023 World Championships has revealed that Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelifis biologically male, according to chromosome analysis. The report, made public just days after World Boxing ordered Khelif to undergo sex testing for eligibility in future female competitions, shows she has a male XY karyotype. This revelation challenges the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) earlier dismissal of such tests and has intensified debate over fairness and safety in women’s boxing. The findings come amid ongoing controversy surrounding Khelif’s participation in women’s events, sparking calls for stricter verification procedures in sport.The report, published on the 3 Wire Sports website, states that Khelif’s chromosome analysis is “abnormal” and confirms a male karyotype. It was conducted by Dr Lal PathLabs in New Delhi, a lab accredited by the American College of Pathologists and certified by the International Organisation for Standardisation. This directly challenges the IOC’s spokesperson Mark Adams, who had described such test results as “ad hoc” and “not legitimate” during a press conference at the Paris Olympics.The controversy surrounding Imane Khelif ’s Olympic gold medal run began as early as her first bout in Paris, where she faced Italy’s Angela Carini.Carini, an experienced and respected boxer, was visibly shaken during the match. Overwhelmed by Khelif’s strength and intensity, she appeared distressed and left the ring in tears after the fight, later telling media she had feared for her safety. The unease only deepened in the final bout, where Khelif defeated Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting in a dominant display that many felt was physically one-sided. The power difference between the fighters drew sharp criticism, with commentators and athletes calling it “uncomfortable to watch” and likening it to watching a man beat a woman in the ring. The moment became one of the most controversial of the Paris Games, fuelling an international debate over fairness and inclusion in women’s sport.IOC president Thomas Bach dismissed the report as part of a Russian-led misinformation campaign, citing ethical and financial issues within the International Boxing Association (IBA), which conducted the tests. Despite these claims, the legitimacy of the Indian lab’s certification has increased pressure on the IOC to clarify its position and respond to questions about Khelif’s eligibility.Following the leak, World Boxing has declared that Khelif must pass mandatory chromosome testing before competing in any future female events. The 26-year-old Olympic champion, who was allowed to compete in Paris due to her female passport status, has so far not provided evidence to confirm female chromosomes. World Boxing now requires all athletes over 18 in its competitions to undergo PCR genetic testing to verify their sex, a measure introduced in response to this controversy.The case has raised serious safety and fairness concerns within the boxing community. Opponents like Italy’s Angela Carini and Mexico’s Brianda Tamara have spoken out about the physical challenges they faced competing against Khelif. Latin American federations have been particularly vocal, urging that women’s competitions be restricted to athletes assigned female at birth, in order to protect fairness and athlete safety.The Khelif controversy highlights the complex and sensitive issues surrounding transgender and intersex athletes in competitive sport. It underscores the need for clear, consistent policies that balance inclusivity with fairness and safety. As governing bodies reassess their rules, the case remains a key example of the challenges faced in maintaining the integrity of women’s sports.The ongoing debate around Imane Khelif’s case brings to light just how complex and emotionally charged the conversation about gender and eligibility in sport has become. At the heart of it are real athletes — women who train for years and step into the ring expecting fairness. Many feel blindsided and unheard when competing against opponents whose physical attributes raise legitimate concerns about safety and equality. This isn’t about exclusion, but about protecting hard-won opportunities for women in sport. Khelif’s story reminds us that governing bodies must act transparently, thoughtfully, and with empathy for all athletes involved.","Imane Khelif is biologically male, according to chromosome analysis.

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Yograj Singh launched a scathing attack on Punjab Kings captain Shreyas Iyer for his reckless dismissal in the IPL 2025 final, terming it a “criminal offence” that proved costly in the team’s narrow six-run defeat to Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB).In a high-voltage final at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Tuesday, RCB lifted their maiden IPL trophy after 18 seasons. However, Iyer’s early exit — caught behind for just 1 off 2 balls while attempting an ill-judged shot off Romario Shepherd — emerged as the turning point in Punjab’s failed chase of 191.Speaking to ANI, Yograj Singh didn’t mince words. “The shot which Shreyas Iyer played in the final was a criminal offence, according to me. Ashok Mankad told me about this criminal offence, which comes under Section 302. He also told me that the repercussions of this is that you will be banned for two matches. What Shreyas did yesterday is not acceptable. There is no apology for that.”Batting first, RCB posted 190/9, with contributions from Virat Kohli (43), Rajat Patidar (26), and Jitesh Sharma (24). PBKS responded strongly with Shashank Singh’s unbeaten 61 and Josh Inglis’ quickfire 39, but a disciplined bowling effort from Krunal Pandya (2/17) and others held them back at 184/7.Despite Shashank’s 22-run blitz in the final over, PBKS fell just short, with Iyer’s early departure drawing heavy scrutiny as RCB celebrated long-awaited glory.",Former India cricketer Yograj Singh launches scathing attack on Punjab Kings captain Shreyas Iyer for his reckless dismissal in the IPL 2025 final.

: Much like the team, RCB’s backroom boys also came together as a cohesive unit. Andy Flower and Mo Bobat, the head coach and director of cricket respectively, forged a successful partnership during their stint with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). Add to that the astute Dinesh Karthik and the tactical acumen of bowling coach Omkar Salvi, and RCB had a mix of intentional flavour and men who had their ears to the ground in domestic cricket. Also, with the likes of Malolan Rangarajan, the Indianness among the coaching staff is unmistakable.Flower, acknowledging the role of the Indian coaches — Karthik in particular — pointed out, “I think having that Indian insight and knowledge in our coaching staff has been really important for this campaign this year. DK particularly, I think, as mentor and batting specialist, he’s been brilliant. I’ve loved working with him.”Karthik went from one of RCB’s best finishers last year to batting coach and mentor this season. On the former wicketkeeper-batter’s growth, Flower stated, “He’s got great energy. He’s got a smile on his face most of the time. And I think he’s really enjoyed his job this year.

Alex Caruso’s elite defense and playoff hustle fuel Oklahoma City Thunder's Finals push







With the 2025 NBA Finals tipping off Thursday night at the Paycom Center in Oklahoma City, all eyes are locked on the clash between the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Indiana Pacers, two teams hungry for their first championship. But while stars like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Tyrese Haliburton dominate the headlines, LeBron James has singled out a different name as a potential game-changer. On the eve of the Finals, James delivered high praise for his former Lakers teammate, Alex Caruso, calling him the ultimate defensive Swiss Army knife, one that could tilt the series in OKC’s favor.During a Wednesday episode of the “ Mind the Game ” podcast, hosted alongside Steve Nash LeBron James didn’t mince words when breaking down Oklahoma City’s playoff success. The four-time NBA champion took a moment to celebrate a player he believes embodies everything a championship team needs.“Then they come off the bench with one of my favorite teammates of all time in Alex Caruso,” James said.When Nash chimed in with “He’s a DOG,” James quickly agreed and expanded on it.“He’s like the ultimate Swiss Army knife. We’ve seen him guard Giannis, the Joker, ANT, Julius Randle, Jamal Murray, all in this postseason,” James noted.“You check the plus/minus after the game, and AC might have five points, three rebounds, two assists, and his plus/minus will be a god damn +17.” Alex Caruso , who joined the NBA as an undrafted rookie in 2016 and later won a title with James on the Lakers in 2020, has become a staple of OKC’s defensive identity. That was clear in Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals, where LeBron broke down one of his favorite moments.“When I was watching the game yesterday,” James recalled, “AC was guarding Anthony Edwards on the wing. Edwards got middle, something you try to prevent, but AC didn’t stop. After the help defense rotated, he sprinted all the way to the corner to contest a three. That type of effort wins games.”The 31-year-old guard has carved his career out of hustle plays, anticipation, and grit. In 2024–25, he averaged 7.1 points over 54 games and earned his second consecutive All-Defensive Team honor. His playoff numbers, 8.8 points, 2.5 assists, 2.3 rebounds, might not leap off the page, but it’s the impact behind those stats that matters.In a previous interview on The Old Man & the Three, Caruso credited LeBron and Rajon Rondo for shaping his defensive instincts.“They’re just so smart,” Caruso said. “Watching them operate was like chess, they were two moves ahead.”As the Oklahoma City Thunder prepares to host Game 1, head coach Mark Daigneault will lean on Caruso to shadow top Pacers like Tyrese Haliburton and Pascal Siakam . According to LeBron, that’s where the series could shift. “With that kind of effort,” James said on the podcast, “they’re going to keep winning.”Also Read: “I just played, that was my training”: LeBron James reveals shocking truth about his early basketball days and how streetball forged his NBA legacy When LeBron James breaks down your hustle frame by frame on a podcast, calls you the “ultimate Swiss Army knife,” and once coached you on the floor, you know you’re doing something right.

Talking about that moment, he revealed:“No, I wasn't crying first of all,” he clarified.He further elaborated, “I don't I don't I don't have emotions. i was raised by a dril,l so I don't have.So I have allergies and my eye leaks a ,lot so like right now it's leaking so I was going like this so of course when you have that moment it makes it look emotional. I don't get emotional.”Referring to his current mental state amidst his show Inside the NBA’s renewal, he said:“Am I sad that the show is leaving? Yes but I've been programmed to do something new after every four years so I've been with Inside the NBA 12 years that's three military terms and now it's just time to do something else.”Opening up further on the insinuations regarding new format of the show, he hilariously pointed out, “But if you look at the reality of the situation we all resigned we're going to be there, we're shooting in the same place, everybody's coming back the name and the title is going to be different.”He further joked about the restrictions they might face in the new show and said, “Only thing I'm concerned with is we're going on a bigger network, will they be able to handle handle our shenanigans? can Charles talk about fat women in San Antonio? can you know can we talk about people's hairlines and you know make them cut their hair, that's the only thing I'm worried about.”Shaquille O’Neal showed up his entertaining side on the podcast and provided the fans with the proof why his 36-year old show was a hit as he held the front with his sheer wit and knowledge.Further in the podcast, he got very candid talking about the real ‘emotional’ moments of his life when he actually cried.

He said:“like being a a a high level juvenile delinquent she was the only one that didn't discipline me everybody discipline me I get in trouble she'd be like ""Baby it's all right."" So one day I said ""If grandma when I get rich I'm going to buy you a house.""“You know what she says i want that house across the street it wasn't no fancy {----} like we lived there it was a house across the street we I grew up in 100 Oak Street in Jersey City she wanted cuz the lady was over there her her [ __ ] was nice it was manicured so when I got some money I knocked on the lady's door said ""I want to buy your house."" And she gave me a price and I doubled her price and I bought my grandmother her house, bought her our first car like she like so I got to do things for them but I never got to tell him thank you so that's why I cry. ”Sharing another recent loss he bore, which made him cry, he elaborated, “My My father recently passed yes yes and it's the most I've cried in my life for that week it kind of help it it helped me crying it helped me to show I guess, we used to call it weakness right you know what I'm saying is it healthy that you like it's almost like we take a pride in not being emotional but we canbe we allowed to i don't know if it's healthy or unhealthy,but you know the old saying, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.. mhm I am who I am and I've been very successful doing it this way, I got to I got to keep it like this.”Shaquille O’Neal revealed why he tried not to lose his cool ever during games in the same podcast.

Rick Pitino shuts down New York Knicks rumors while showing support for Thibodeau



Tom Thibodeau was dismissed after five seasons as New York Knicks head coach, despite leading the team to the 2024 Eastern Conference Finals. Image via: Getty Images





The New York Knicks' sudden decision to part ways with head coach Tom Thibodeau sent shockwaves through the basketball world, especially after the team’s strong playoff performance. Naturally, speculation swirled about who might step into the high-pressure role next, and some eyes turned to longtime college coaching legend Rick Pitino. But during a recent public appearance in the Bronx, Pitino made it very clear: a move to Madison Square Garden is not on his agenda.Rick Pitino, now the head coach at St. John’s University, was at Yankee Stadium on Wednesday to throw out the ceremonial first pitch. But the baseball diamond didn’t stop the basketball questions. When asked if he had any interest in replacing Thibodeau as head coach of the Knicks, Pitino gave a response that was both blunt and final.“Absolutely not,” Pitino said with a smirk, quickly shutting down the conversation.Though he firmly declined the idea of returning to the NBA sidelines, Pitino did express empathy for Thibodeau, who led the Knicks to one of their most competitive stretches in decades.“I feel bad for Thibs because he captured all of New York, built something very, very special,” Pitino told reporters. ""A lot of us don't comprehend what happened, but Thibs is going to be well taken care of and he'll move on to other pastures. ""The move to fire Thibodeau came just days after the Knicks’ playoff run ended in the Eastern Conference Finals, marking their first appearance at that stage in 25 years. Under Thibodeau’s leadership, New York posted back-to-back 50-win seasons, something the franchise hadn’t seen since the 1990s.In a formal statement, Knicks president Leon Rose credited Thibodeau for his impact. ""We can't thank Tom enough for pouring his heart and soul into each and every day of being the New York Knicks head coach,"" Rose said. ""He led us not only with class and professionalism for the past five seasons, but also to tremendous success on the court... Tom will always be a part of our Knicks family and we truly wish him nothing but the best in the future. """"Only time tells with those things,"" Pitino remarked when asked if the Knicks made the right call. ""So we'll see.""Pitino, now 72, also shared about his career prospects. “As long as you’re mentally and physically sharp, you do it as long as you can. Because coaching is a blessing. It’s the second-best thing to playing. I have been blessed with over 50 years of coaching, and I hope it continues as long as I can do it,” Pitino said (via SNY).Pitino, known for his impressive track record both on the basketball court and in promoting academic excellence among his players, has held head coaching positions at several prominent programs. His career includes leading the University of Louisville from 2001 to 2017, highlighted by a national championship win in 2013, and guiding the University of Kentucky to the 1996 NCAA title during his tenure from 1989 to 1997. He also coached at Providence College (1985–1987), Boston University (1978–1983), and served as interim head coach for the final six games at Hawaii during the 1975–76 season.Also Read: Who’s responsible for Tom Thibodeau’s exit from New York Knicks?

3. Second in command to a WWE authority figure

2. Manager



1. Occasional wrestler





Samantha Irvin could have explored new directions in WWE if she had been given the opportunity.Samantha Irvin rose to prominence as one of the captivating and enthralling WWE ring announcers of the modern era. Her distinctive voice, taking her antics to the next level, and her unique style made her a prominent figure in the company. However, Irvin shocked her esteemed fanbase by announcing her resignation from WWE last summer. Irvin stated that she only took up the role of ring announcing to transition into more directions within the WWE.Not only that, her music aspirations also contributed to her WWE departure. However, had the regime decided to give her that opportunity to explore more, here are three directions for Samantha Irvin that could have presented her in a different way on WWE television:Samantha Irvin had a remarkable presence on WWE television programming. She could have followed in the footsteps of past wrestlers like Stacy Keibler and Eve Torres. They were in-ring competitors, but took the role of assistants to the authority figures on WWE television. This could have been a new direction that could have been exciting for Irvin and possibly not led to her exit from the Stamford-based promotion.Another possible role for Samantha Irvin that could have occurred in WWE was that of a wrestling manager.The most obvious choice for Irvin to manage would have been her now husband, Ricochet. He was a mid-card attraction for the company, and pairing up with his wife would have been an exciting booking for his career, too. Moreover, this could have happened during Ricochet's feud with Logan Paul when he brought up Irvin, which could have been a stellar sight to witness.While many fans may be unaware, Samantha Irvin has undergone training to become an in-ring athlete. She could have created history by becoming the first WWE ring announcer to also step in the ring. She could have had occasional feuds with top stars of the women's division that would have seen her compete in singles and tag team matches. Irvin handling double duties, both as a wrestler and a wrestler, would have made Monday Night RAW a must-see program, especially during her onscreen time.Also read: Tony Khan urges AEW fans to welcome WWE viewers with “arms wide open”",Samantha Irvin announced her resignation from WWE last summer.

The roof on Philippe Chatrier was closed, the stadium was packed to its near 15,000-capacity. The fans were loud, chanting ‘Lois, Lois, Lois’ like it were a prayer, lifting Lois Boisson when she trailed, helping her stay the course and finally pushing her over the finish line after a little over two-hours.The crowd was always going to be a factor in this French Open last-eight clash.Mirra Andreeva, 18, the sixth-seed, was up against the world No. 361 Boisson and a full house that refused to settle down, not even between serves. They whistled, they booed, they cheered, most of the time it was over-thetop. The Russian led in both sets, 3-1 and 5-3 in the first, and even had two set points.In the second set she jumped to a 3-0 lead, but struggled with the boisterous crowd that came alive to her every error.That Andreeva may have played herself out of the tournament is only part of the story, the other half is the inspiring run of the wildcard entrant Boisson. The 22-year-old fought back, showcasing her whiplash fore - hand, slamming 11 winners of that flank, as she reeled off six straight games to clinch a memorable 7-6 (6), 6-2 win.“I love to play with the crowd. I love to hear my name when I win a point. For me it’s a plus, not pressure.It’s also really difficult for players from other countries,” Boisson said. “I ex - pected it,” Andreeva said of the behaviour of the home fans. “The first set I managed it pretty well. I didn’t really pay attention to that, but obviously with nerves and with pressure, it became a little harder.”Boisson, who played in the qualifying draw here in 2021, 2022 and 2023, debuted in the main draw this year and became the first French semifinalist at Roland Garros since Marion Bartoli in 2011. She’s also the first wild card to do it in the Open era. Her win over An - dreeva is her second top-10 win, she clocked the first against the world No.3 Jessica Peg - ula in the fourth-round. Boisson underlined that her charge here was the result of the hard work she has put in over the years.“My dream is to win it, not to be in the semifinal,” Boisson said. In the semifinals on Thursday, she plays American Coco Gauff, the world No.2, who beat compatriot Madison Keys 6-7 (6), 6-4, 6-1.","Lois Boisson beat Mirra Andreeva 7-6 (6), 6-2 to reach the French Open semifinals. The 22-year-old is the first wildcard entrant to reach this stage in the Open era.

‘Wherever I go, I see single-use plastic littering up the place’

‘I’m that guy with the steel bottle, cloth bags and no excuses’

‘Be a guest, not a pest’

‘I treat every trail, mountain, or beach like a home that deserves respect’

For Amit Sadh World Environment Day isn’t just another date on the calendar — it’s deeply personal. “The day falls on June 5, which also happens to be my birthday. It’s also a reminder that this planet’s on rent, and we’re all tenants,” says the actor and travel enthusiast. It’s this perspective that shapes how he approaches the day. He says, “If I’m not working, I usually spend it unplugged — no fancy posts, just getting my hands dirty planting trees or cleaning a trail. We all need to focus on small acts that make a big impact.”He has long been a vocal advocate against single-use plastics — a stance that didn’t develop overnight. “Wherever I go, I see single-use plastic littering up the place. Solo cups, chips packets, chocolate wrappers — it’s everywhere,” he says, adding, “It all started when I saw this mess on a trail or by a roadside dhaba and thought, enough is enough.”Amit’s mantra is simple, and he walks the talk. He shares, “Aapki chocolate, aapka wrapper, aapki zimmedari! I’m that guy with the steel bottle, cloth bags and no excuses.I believe small steps add up. The planet’s not going to clean itself — we’ve all got to do our bit.” Despite being vocal, he doesn’t see himself as someone lecturing others. He clarifies, “Look, I’m no preacher. I just share my journey — photos, videos and small wins. When we camp, we clean up after ourselves and even pick up the garbage left behind by others.”As an avid mountaineer and biker, Amit has seen some of nature’s most pristine corners and how they’re being affected by irresponsible tourism. “Travel is a privilege,” he emphasises, adding, “I always say — leaveno trace, take your trash back, respect the locals, and don’t treat nature as just a backdrop for selfies. Be a guest, not a pest.”Reflecting on his travels, he says, “Every time I ride or climb, I see two things — majestic landscapes and the mess we leave behind. That contrast hits hard. It’s why I talk about it, and why I pick up trash when I see it. It’s not a heroic act — it’s just necessary.”These experiences have strengthened his message. He asserts, “Nature’s not a backdrop for Instagram; it’s our lifeline. I try to treat every trail, mountain, or beach like a home that deserves respect. I share these stories through my socials and YouTube channel, hoping it sparks a change, maybe one person picks up that wrapper or refuses that plastic bottle and teaches the next. That’s all I’m hoping for.”When asked about one mindset he’d like to see change globally, Amit, who has been part of films like Kai Po Che!, Sultan, and Gold, says, “To stop seeing nature as just ‘a place to visit’ and start treating it like our only home. Because that’s exactly what it is. When you see it as your home, you care for it. You protect it. And hopefully, we give it a future we can be proud to pass on to the next generation.”While he has witnessed troubling changes in nature during his expeditions, he remains hopeful. “Forest services are collaborating with locals and spreading awareness. Mahila Mandals are working closely with the government on conservation efforts. There’s a lot of good work happening,” he signs off.","World Environment Day falls on June 5, which also happens to be Amit Sadh's birthday.

Former Indian cricket legend Syed Kirmani expressed concern over the tragic death of 11 Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) fans during victory celebrations at M Chinnaswamy Stadium. The incident occurred when local authorities failed to manage the massive turnout during celebrations organized by RCB management and Karnataka government to honor the newly crowned IPL champions.Kirmani, who was part of India's 1983 World Cup winning team, offered his condolences to the bereaved families while reflecting on the changing nature of fan culture.""My condolences to bereaved families. This was a deadly welcome to IPL champions. In our times, there was no such media hype and there was no TV and there was no such thing which could lead to such things,"" Kirmani told India Today.The former wicketkeeper, who played 88 Tests for India, suggested that the celebration could have been better planned with proper arrangements.""On that count I suppose if RCB waited for 17 (18) years to become champions and organizers whosoever it may be could have waited for a while for things to settle down and then organize a show to felicitate these great heroes of RCB.""Kirmani questioned whether similar fan enthusiasm would be shown for Karnataka's potential Ranji Trophy victory, highlighting the evolution of cricket fandom.""The fans of our times were not as crazy as fans of today and especially in the IPL, the crazy fans are unimaginable particularly as you could see lakhs and lakhs were around just to get a glimpse of these great heroes.""The stampede resulted from an unexpectedly large crowd gathering to celebrate RCB's championship victory, leading to the unfortunate loss of lives at the stadium.","Syed Kirmani expresses concern over tragic death of 11 Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) fans during victory celebrations at M Chinnaswamy Stadium.

Jhonkensy Noel’s struggles at the Major League level

Guardians' executive offers honest comments

“There are things with Jhonkensy, in particular with his swing, that he could benefit from just more regular playing time. But that’s hard to do at the major league level because we’re trying to win each night and figure out what the best matchups are for us to win on any given day.”

Path forward for Jhonkensy Noel





Jhonkensy Noel is having trouble making the jump to the major leagues, having once been considered a strong power-hitting prospect for the Cleveland Guardians. Recent performances by the 23-year-old outfielder have allowed the front office to be candid about the obstacles young players face when attempting to succeed at the top level of the sport.Notably, May was a month in which the opportunity for Jhonkensy Noel's participation with the Guardians was particularly limited. With 39 plate appearances and six starts, he did not enjoy any defined playing opportunities. This lack of opportunities has not been conducive to him finding his groove or displaying his skill set. Needing to win games and pick the best matchups for wins has limited his ability to develop at the major league level even further.Chris Antonetti, the Guardians' president of baseball operations, reflected upon Noel's circumstance, conceding the challenges of developing talent in a competitive situation. He said-Antonetti's remarks highlight the delicate balancing act between player development and team success, emphasising the challenge of affording serviceable opportunities for a player to learn to find his edge while still trying to maintain that edge.Jhonkensy Noel's present condition throws light on the grim realities that face prospects during the major level transition. Limited playing time notwithstanding, the team's myopic view towards ""win now"" ethos put a damper on so much of what an adjustment and development are really about.Also Read: Will Jasson Dominguez play tonight against Cleveland Guardians? Latest update on New York Yankees star's injury report (June 4, 2025) Going forward, the Guardians may have to look to some other options for his development, whether that be increased playing time in less important situations, or assignments to minor league affiliates where he can work on his skills without the glare of 'perform-now' expectations.Persistence and adaptability will be key for Noel. By embracing opportunities for growth and addressing areas of improvement, he can work towards realising his potential and contributing meaningfully to the Guardians' future success.","Jhonkensy Noel is having trouble making the jump to the major leagues.

2025 highlights: Familiar faces and dramatic falls



Is it just madness or tradition





Every year on a steep hill in Gloucestershire, England, hundreds gather to chase a rolling 7-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down a dangerously steep slope. Known as the Cooper’s Hill Cheese Rolling Contest, the event is chaotic, absurd, and completely thrilling. With participants tumbling, somersaulting, and crashing their way to the bottom, the headline “People sprint to catch a 7-pound wheel of cheese” is technically accurate, but it doesn’t quite capture the madness, tradition, and injuries that define this bizarre British spectacle. So, is it a good headline? That depends on what you’re hoping to convey.The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. Dating back at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize. It sounds simple, but the event is notorious for its steep incline, dangerous tumbles, and frequent injuries.The hill is so steep that it's nearly impossible to stay upright. Most participants end up tumbling head over heels, colliding with each other or the ground.Gravity takes over quickly, and the cheese, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, is almost never actually caught. Still, competitors willingly risk sprains, fractures, and concussions for a shot at glory and a round of cheese.This year, German YouTuber Tom Kopke claimed victory for the second year in a row. Shirtless and triumphant, he declared, “I risked my life for this. It’s my cheese. Back to back.” On the women’s side, Ava Sender Logan from London tumbled repeatedly but emerged victorious, saying, “It felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head. I’m fine.” Around them, spectators packed the woods and fences for a glimpse of the chaos.While the event may seem absurd to outsiders, for locals and returning participants, it’s a point of pride and cultural identity. Despite calls to regulate or cancel it over safety concerns, the contest continues to thrive, drawing international competitors and media attention. Volunteers, medics, and long-time residents treat it as an important local tradition","The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire.

BENGALURU: A perfect storm of giddy, overenthusiastic fans, poor planning by officials, bad stadium management, stretched police force, shortage of time, clueless event management and lack of communication between stakeholders resulted in the tragic and totally avoidable, deaths of 11 RCB fans and left 75 injured.At the crack of dawn, RCB lit up social media with the big news: The champions were flying home with the coveted IPL trophy and would celebrate with a grand victory parade in Bengaluru. It was an announcement that caught the cops unawares as they had no communication about it. But it sent the already-electrified fanbase into overdrive.Then came the colossal collective failure: Cops failed to act swiftly and draw up crowd-control plans. Politicians turned the celebration into a photo-op frenzy, brushing aside warnings in their race to bask in reflected glory. Many brought their families to Vidhana Soudha to pose with the cricketers.""RCB gave the city a reason to celebrate. But police and netas turned that joy into grief with their sheer incompetence. It's shameful that Bengaluru couldn't manage a 1km victory parade,"" said the grieving brother of one of the victims.Even senior bureaucrats admitted that the lives could have been saved with proper planning and coordination. ""The RCB management did not consult us before announcing a victory parade. We would not have allowed it given the crazy celebrations that unfolded on the streets on Tuesday night. But the political bosses were in no mood to listen, they wanted us to go ahead with bandobust,"" a senior police officer said.Till mid-afternoon, there was no clarity whether there was a parade and where the events would be held. Senior cops were informed only around 2pm to be at the stadium and the assembly.By which time, the crowds had already gathered.At the cricket stadium, the scenes from early afternoon held bad portents. Fans had started flocking to the gates by noon and it was apparent to any bystander that things would get of control soon.TOI reporters, who could not even get in, found that most gates stayed shut and false rumours of gate numbers led to a huge rush. Naturally, barricades collapsed, metal grills broke down and those who fell — mostly young people and women were unable to get up and got crushed and trampled.","A perfect storm of giddy, overenthusiastic fans, poor planning by officials, bad stadium management, stretched police force, shortage of time, clueless event management and lack of communication between stakeholders resulted in the tragic and totally avoidable, deaths of 11 RCB fans.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121635580,imgsize-109324,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/121635580.jpg"

Portugal secured a 2-1 comeback victory against Germany in their Nations League semifinal in Munich on Wednesday. While the side by Cristiano Ronaldo made it to their second final in the history of the competition, it was their 40-year-old skipper scoring his 137th international goal to become the oldest player to score against Germany that grabbed all the headlines.Ronaldo's goal came five minutes after substitute Francisco Conceicao equalized with a powerful shot in the 63rd minute, helping Portugal overcome their initial deficit and ending Ronaldo's personal losing streak against Germany.Florian Wirtz had given Germany the lead in the 48th minute with a precise header inside the right post, but Portugal coach Roberto Martinez's strategic substitutions proved decisive.Champions League winner Vitinha, who helped Paris Saint-Germain triumph against Inter Milan at the same stadium just four days earlier, made a significant impact after coming on as a substitute. German goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen stood his ground to prevent Portugal from extending their lead further.PSG wing backs Joao Neves and Nuno Mendes were in the starting line-up for Portugal, while Nick Woltemade made his debut start for Germany.Conceicao made an immediate impact after coming on, scoring with an impressive long-range strike past Robin Gosens. Mendes then provided the assist for Ronaldo's comfortable finish five minutes later. The Al-Nassr man was in the right place to guide the pass from his teammate into an empty net.While Portugal have already booked their spot in the final, they will have to wait to know who they are to face in the title decider. Spain and France face off at MHP Arena in Germany. Defending Euro and Nations League champions Spain will look to become the first side to defend the Nations League trophy if they manage to go through Kylian Mbappe and Co.The victory was particularly significant for Ronaldo, who had previously lost all four games he had played against Germany during his career.
