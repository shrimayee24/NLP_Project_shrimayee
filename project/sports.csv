He neither listens, nor realises what he does; such a person

Is a disease until death departs

A delayed domestic flight finally touched down in Chennai, and we were herded into a bus that crawled another 25 minutes before reaching the terminal. By the time the luggage arrived, irritation had settled like dust on my tiredness. I was eager to leave when a woman stopped me. I thought she might ask for a selfie but instead, she whispered, “In one of your speeches or columns, please share some tips for women who put up with toxic relationships.”She looked like someone in their forties, but her face carried the fatigue of many more years. The circles beneath her eyes seemed carved into her skin. Her gait was heavy, as though she carried an invisible cross.“Ma’am, I am not a counsellor,” I started, when she interjected, “But women like me cannot even dream of approaching a counsellor or a lawyer.”I decided to address the issue quickly and move away. ‘If you sit and talk it out, any issue can be resolved’, I told her. I knew it sounded hollow. She shook her head. “He will not listen. The moment I initiate a discussion, my words dissolve in his abuses and emotional storms. There is no space for a conversation.” Her eyes carried rage, not directed at me, but at the futility of hearing the same empty counsel from many.In front of me was a tortured soul. I cannot be beating around the bush. I looked at her in the eyes and said, “It is never too late to sever a relationship that has become unbearable.” She smiled, that of someone who is unable to cry. “It’s too late. The children will suffer.”Grasping at another thread, I said, “Sometimes suffering can be seen as karma cleansing. If you believe in karma, think of it as reducing your karmic debt.” She gave me a faint smile, but it did not reach her eyes. I simply held her hand. And in that silence, I understood; people in such prisons do not always seek answers. They have tried, failed, endured. What they crave is not solutions , but empathy .It is not only women who suffer. Men too fall into such traps. Wives who threaten to commit suicide, to go to the police station. The husbands won’t even be able to say a word. Dialogue is strangled before it can begin. In toxic relationships, love hardens into control, care mutates into manipulation, protection becomes possession.Thiruvalluvar noticed such people centuries ago. He doesn’t offer comforting illusions; that patience can reform them, or love can redeem them. With the sharpness of a razor, he delivers the truth:Valluvar ’s brilliance lies in what he does not say. He spares us futile remedies and, in doing so, clears the fog. Acceptance itself can be strength to endure when there is no escape, and the courage to disunite when the moment comes.Love is meant to give wings, not chains. Care is meant to bring comfort, not fear. That night at the airport, I realised that the deepest form of kindness is not advice, but a quiet hand, held in the silence of shared humanity.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123853828,imgsize-68632,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/123853828.jpg"

NFL’s lack of consistency compared to past public statements drew more criticism



The Green Bay Packers and the NFL held a moment of silence for conservative activist Charlie Kirk before Thursday Night Football against the Washington Commanders at Lambeau Field. Kirk, 31, was shot and killed Wednesday during a speaking event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.The tribute took place about 25 minutes before kickoff. The in-stadium announcement said, “The National Football League asks that you please join us in a moment of silent reflection following the murder of Charlie Kirk. The NFL condemns all violence in our communities. It will take all of us to stop hate. Thank you.”Former President Donald Trump confirmed Kirk’s death on Wednesday and later said he would posthumously award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The FBI released a photo of a person of interest Thursday, but no arrests have been made.Fox News senior NFL writer Armando Salguero shared video of the silence. The MLFootball account also circulated the clip, describing the moment as a league-wide honor. Critics, however, said the execution fell flat.One frustrated fan in attendance wrote, “They did it when the stadium wasn’t even half full half an hour ago, and it went right to. It was terrible.” Another attendee added, “It was ridiculous; they didn’t even display it on the jumbotron.”On social media, the pushback was even stronger. One user posted, “We doing for just anyone now? There was a school shooting yesterday (AND today) AND a shooting at a US naval academy but I guess that’s not important.” Another wrote, “That wasn’t even a moment. Couldn’t even count one second of silence.”The NFL’s silence in the immediate aftermath of Kirk’s assassination frustrated many. The league has issued statements in the past on events such as the killing of George Floyd and support for LGBTQ rights. The absence of a message for Kirk led some to accuse the NFL of picking and choosing when to speak up.Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker posted Kirk’s final text message, calling him a “strong witness for Christ.” Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson also paid tribute, as did New York Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart, who wrote, “Praying for him and his family. Charlie did great things for our country!! Political Violence NEEDS TO STOP!! Pray for our country man. This is disgusting and Sad!!”ESPN analyst Pat McAfee called the shooting “startling, saddening, and maddening.” Former NFL players Tim Tebow and Julian Edelman also acknowledged Kirk’s death.Outside football, the New York Yankees held a moment of silence before their Wednesday game against the Detroit Tigers. Trump later appeared at Yankee Stadium during a separate 9/11 ceremony.","Green Bay Packers and the NFL held a moment of silence for conservative activist Charlie Kirk before Thursday Night Football against the Washington Commanders.

Why Travis Kelce ’s role in the engagement matters to fans

How Travis Kelce became an unexpected focal point in Gaylor discussions

Global popstar Taylor Swift’s surprise engagement to Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has sent shockwaves across pop culture—and ignited intense debate among her most devoted fans. While millions of Swifties celebrated the union of one of music’s biggest icons and one of the NFL’s top players, a vocal sub-fandom known as Gaylors spiraled into despair, convinced that Taylor’s true self has long been hidden behind a carefully crafted public image. ..Travis Kelce, known for his dynamic play on the field and charismatic media presence off it, became an instant headline magnet when news of his engagement to Taylor Swift broke. The engagement not only signifies the merging of two megawatt celebrity worlds—pop music and professional football—but also intensifies the narrative for Gaylors who believe Taylor’s public relationships are smokescreens.Many argued Travis Kelce’s rising fame and charm were leveraged to obscure Taylor’s supposed hidden love life. When she announced Kelce's proposal, the community spiralled into despair.Posts flooded in: fans were ""speechless and disappointed"", called it ""the worst news of my life"", confessing they were ""so confused"" and even ""going to vomit"".For Rosy York, a long-time Swift fan interviewed by Slate Magazine, Kelce’s involvement didn’t negate her belief. “She can be with whoever she wants to be with… There's a limit to how disappointed a person could reasonably feel. She's not your friend,” York said. Yet she pointed to Taylor’s Lover era and rainbow-drenched promotion as suggestive of a queer identity, now complicated by Kelce’s presence in her life.Travis Kelce’s engagement announcement, far from just another celebrity milestone, became a lightning rod for controversy within the Gaylor community. The subreddit r/Gaylor_Swift, which counts nearly 50,000 members, erupted into emotional posts—some calling the news ""the worst news of my life,"" others clinging to the theory that the relationship was staged for public consumption.Screenshots of their despair flooded social media, often accompanied by mocking comments. To shield members from trolling, the moderators locked the subreddit, leaving Travis Kelce unwittingly at the center of a cultural debate about celebrity, identity, and marketing.Also Read: “It's gonna ruin some relationships”: Why Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s romance is toxic for love lives Some fans eventually embraced a more balanced view.

Defenseman Scott Morrow determined to secure place on New York Rangers defense after K’Andre Miller trade

“K’Andre was a big part of the team here. If they value me enough to want me back in a package like that for a player that good, it shows that they think somewhat more highly of me.

I just want to prove them right.”

Scott Morrow’s skillset, development, and rookie camp focus with New York Rangers

“Being more reliable defensively is something I’m working on,”

The New York Rangers’ acquisition of defenseman Scott Morrow in the blockbuster trade that sent K’Andre Miller to the Carolina Hurricanes has placed immediate attention on the 22-year-old. Viewed as the central return piece, Morrow arrives with both expectations and opportunity, and he’s making sure to seize it by committing early to the Rangers’ rookie camp ahead of the 2025-26 season.Morrow, a native of Darien, Connecticut, understands the magnitude of being traded for a player of Miller’s caliber. Speaking to the Rangers’ official media, he noted,With Adam Fox and Vladislav Gavrikov projected as the top pairing and Will Borgen the only other defenseman locked into a roster spot, there’s legitimate room for Morrow to stake his claim. His arrival signals not only a fresh start but also a test of whether he can quickly transition into an NHL-ready role under head coach Mike Sullivan.Despite being a centerpiece of a high-profile deal, Morrow isn’t assuming he’ll be granted a place on the roster.Instead, he’s putting in extra work at rookie camp to demonstrate initiative and progression. Known for his strong physique, puck-moving ability, and offensive upside, he is focusing on shoring up the defensive side of his game.he explained.His versatility makes him an intriguing option for the Rangers, particularly in a defensive corps that could benefit from both mobility and physicality. Morrow emphasized that his approach is centered on steady growth, maintaining that his focus remains on the process rather than the hype surrounding his arrival.Scott Morrow’s path with the New York Rangers is still being written, but the opportunity is real. By taking part in rookie camp and openly committing to becoming a more complete defenseman, he has positioned himself to make a strong impression. With the context of the K’Andre Miller trade framing his arrival, Morrow now has the chance to validate the Rangers’ belief in his potential.Also Read: Toronto Maple Leafs prospect Easton Cowan to rent apartment from Fraser Minten during rookie training camp",The New York Rangers signed defenseman Scott Morrow in the K'Andre Miller trade.

Staub’s performance forces coaches and fans to reconsider starting quarterback assumptions



Why Shedeur Sanders’ support carries weight



Can Staub carry the momentum into the Houston showdown?

When redshirt sophomore Ryan Staub stepped onto the field for the Colorado Buffaloes in relief of Kaidon Salter and Julian Lewis against Delaware, few expected the result. Staub completed 7 of 10 passes for 157 yards and two touchdowns in a commanding 31‑7 win. But beyond the stats, what resonated most was a personal call from former Colorado starting quarterback Shedeur Sanders. In a conversation shared by head coach Deion “Coach Prime” Sanders, Shedeur said he reached out to congratulate Staub and offer encouragement. “Yes, of course, Shedeur has called Staub. Everybody who played has called and reached out to Staub because they love him,” Deion Sanders said.Staub’s surge in that Delaware game didn’t just earn applause – it shifted expectations. Having been third on the depth chart, his sharp timing and efficiency in a high‑pressure moment have thrust him into serious consideration for the starting role in the upcoming game versus Houston. Salter, long seen as the frontrunner, has yet to establish commanding performances; Lewis, a five‑star freshman with substantial NIL backing, is expected to redshirt this semester. After Staub’s display, those narratives feel less assured.Head Coach Deion Sanders has stressed that the quarterback position remains open, but Staub has undeniably forced his name into contention.In Boulder, football legacies matter. Shedeur Sanders is more than a former starter – his jersey now joins Travis Hunter’s among those retired in honor, hallmarks of the Buffaloes’ recent golden era. His call to Staub is more than a gesture – it’s a voice of the old guard acknowledging possibility in a new voice. For teammates, recruits, and fans, knowing someone of that stature believes in Staub adds credibility. It’s a moment that suggests leadership, trust, and continuity.Looking ahead, Staub enters the spotlight this Friday against Houston under different expectations than he had just a week prior. If Colorado wants to seize control of its offense, they’ll need him to execute not just cleanly, but confidently. The offensive line, receivers, and play‑makers all must rise; coaching staff must decide who earns the starter nod.If Staub builds off his relief performance, Friday night could mark the point where the conversation around Colorado’s quarterback battle becomes real.",Redshirt sophomore Ryan Staub played in relief of Kaidon Salter and Julian Lewis against Delaware.

Kelvin Gastelum's history of weight issues

Fight status and potential penalties for Kelvin Gastelum

Kelvin Gastelum sissed at official weigh-ins for Noche UFC, 191 lbs (five lbs over 186-lb limit for non-title fight vs. Dusko Todorovic) on September 12, 2025. Hearing this news is sending shockwaves throughout the MMA community, especially since Gastelum has been under much scrutiny from fans and analysts alike regarding his constant weight problems.It was, however, the first time Gastelum had missed weight in a middleweight fight, and the fourth time in his 25-fight UFC career overall. This not only raises eyebrows and questions about how ready he actually was for this bout, but it could also affect how he performs when he gets inside the Octagon.We all know Gastelum's love/hate relationship with weight management during his long tenure in the UFC.

Flyers leadership confident Aleksei Kolosov can still develop into a top NHL goalie

Aleksei Kolosov’s journey is far from over

The Philadelphia Flyers are aiming to stabilize their goaltending situation this season, but they remain steadfast in giving young prospect Aleksei Kolosov a genuine chance to shine. Despite Kolosov’s inconsistent performances in the past, the organization is determined not to write him off, keeping the door open for the 23-year-old Belarusian goaltender to prove himself.Flyers president Keith Jones recently made it clear that the franchise is invested in Kolosov’s potential growth. “We had hoped their ability to adjust would occur quicker than it did. I wouldn’t write off either guy, Fedotov or Kolosov,” Jones said during a press conference. He added, “Kolosov is obviously younger and is an extremely athletic goaltender. And, if he can put all the pieces together in the future, he could turn into a very good goaltender. ”The club’s general manager, Danny Briere, echoed this sentiment, stressing that both Kolosov and fellow Russian Ivan Fedotov must be ready when called upon. The addition of Dan Vladar this offseason is expected to help solidify the goaltending duo alongside Sam Ersson, though both have faced struggles and injuries.Still, the Flyers are determined to develop their homegrown talents rather than simply rely on external acquisitions.Kolosov’s path hasn’t been straightforward. After arriving late to last year’s training camp, he made his NHL debut on October 27 but struggled to maintain consistency and was sent back to the AHL with the Lehigh Valley Phantoms. Jones admitted, “Developmentally, we would prefer that last year he spent a little more time in the American Hockey League. It just was not in the cards.”Also Read: “He’s got a lot”: Amid Oilers extension drama, Canada PM reveals how Connor McDavid remains humble and approachable Now, as the Flyers prepare for the new season, the organization is optimistic that Kolosov can harness his athleticism and talent, prove his commitment, and finally make a lasting impact at the NHL level.",Flyers leadership confident Aleksei Kolosov can still develop into a top NHL goalie.

How Gráinne Walsh's semi-final bout unfolded

Gráinne Walsh's impressive journey to the semi-final

Gráinne Walsh has won a bronze medal at the 2025 World Boxing Championships in Liverpool after losing her 65 kg semi-final match to Aida Abikeyeva of Kazakhstan. Despite the valiant effort, she could not dislodge the tactical strength of Abikeyeva across three rounds, and in the end, all the judges gave their cards unanimously. Although Walsh had his usual lively and aggressive front-foot approach, the gap could not be closed as Abikeyeva landed the more telling and scoring counter shots from distance.Gráinne Walsh came out firing from the get-go, stepping forward, looking to put the pressure on. Inside, she connected with combinations and looping overhands that made Aida Abikeyeva wobbly. For her part, Abikeyeva stayed calm, maintaining Walsh at bay with a rigid left jab thrown at a distance and accommodating spread measures.It was a second-round turning point. Abikeyeva started to establish a rhythm of her own, started to find Walsh with straight shots and counters, which often occurred as Walsh closed the distance. This increasing control was reflected on the cards of the judges, too: the Kazakh boxer won each of the final seven rounds on the scorecards.Walsh was able to land her heaviest shots in the final round, flaring that strength and aggressiveness to keep coming forward.But the deficit from the previous rounds was just too big to bounce back from. Walsh lost four of the five rounds, though two judges only had Walsh up one round in the last stanza, in which the Russian was fighting for dear life; that meant a unanimous decision for Abikeyeva.Also Read: 'Boxing is always bigger': Canelo Alvarez takes a jab at MMA in heated debate with Max Kellerman Gráinne Walsh’s road to the semi-final was quite impressive. Earlier, she beat China's one-time World Championship silver medallist Yang Liu, and one of the strong contenders for the 2024 Olympic Games, closely, 3-2. She also won by unanimous decisions in earlier rounds, demonstrating her skills in both close battles and more decisive contests.This bronze marks Walsh's top amateur performance on the world stage. It joins her resume that includes Paris Olympic qualification and European Games bronze from 2019.Walsh is not the only Irish athlete bringing medal glory at these championships. Her teammates Aoife O’Rourke and Patsy Joyce are also assured at least bronze with semi-final spots in their respective weights.","Gráinne Walsh has won a bronze medal at the 2025 World Boxing Championships in Liverpool.

WWE takes WrestleMania global with Saudi Arabia debut



FULL ANNOUNCEMENT: WrestleMania 43 is heading to Saudi Arabia in 2027

Fans and future of WrestleMania



For nearly four decades, WrestleMania has stood as WWE ’s crown jewel, drawing fans from across the globe. But in 2027, history will be made as the event leaves North American soil for the very first time. WWE officially confirmed that Saudi Arabia will host WrestleMania, cementing the Kingdom’s growing presence on the sports entertainment stage.The announcement came during a high-profile news conference in Las Vegas, where Triple H stood alongside Saudi sports advisor Turki Alalshikh and WWE icons including The Undertaker, Shawn Michaels, Seth Rollins, Logan Paul, Bianca Belair, and Charlotte Flair. Triple H summed up the moment with one simple message: “We could not be more excited for this opportunity.”Since its debut in 1985, WrestleMania has never ventured beyond the United States and Canada. With Riyadh now set to host, WWE has made it clear that it sees its future firmly on the global stage. The move follows a lucrative 10-year, $500 million partnership signed with Saudi Arabia in 2018, which has already brought premium events like Crown Jewel and Elimination Chamber to the Kingdom.While Europe, particularly London and Paris, had long been rumored as frontrunners for the first overseas WrestleMania, the decision underscores Saudi Arabia’s aggressive push into international sports.Triple H credited both WWE leadership and passionate Saudi fans for making it possible, stating, “Without the fans in Riyadh, without the fans in Jeddah that have shown up time after time… it wouldn’t happen. ”The Kingdom has already hosted several groundbreaking WWE moments, including the first women’s match in its history. WrestleMania’s arrival in 2027, alongside the Royal Rumble in 2026, signals an even deeper commitment to transforming Saudi Arabia into a global hub for live entertainment.Ticket information has yet to be released, but given WrestleMania’s legacy of spectacle, fans can expect an event unlike anything seen before. For WWE, this isn’t just a change in location. It’s a bold declaration that WrestleMania truly belongs to the world.Also Read: Jacob deGrom set for emotional return to Citi Field as Rangers and Mets battle for Wild Card spots","WWE officially confirmed that Saudi Arabia will host WrestleMania 43 in 2027.

The National Football League confirms review of allegations against Tyreek Hill

Tyreek Hill is under a lot of pressure after domestic abuse allegations from his ex-wife, Keeta Vaccaro, but the Miami Dolphins player is staying focused on the game. In his first public comments on Friday, Hill referred to the accusations as mere ""noise"" and emphasized that his main focus is on football and spending time with his children. With the NFL looking into the matter and Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel supporting him, Hill's remarks show his resolve to keep his personal issues separate from his professional game.Tyreek Hill, the standout wide receiver for the Miami Dolphins, spoke to the press on Friday, September 12, 2025, in light of the ongoing domestic abuse allegations from his estranged wife, Keeta Vaccaro.In his first public remarks since the allegations emerged, Hill highlighted his commitment to his work and personal life, saying that his top focus continues to be on football and family. ""My focus right now is just playing ball, and spending time with my kids and just doing what I’m best at: providing for my family,"" Hill spoke to the media at a press conference held at the Dolphins' training center in Miami Gardens, Florida.He added, ""So all the noise, I feel like if you allow that kind of stuff to get in the way of what you’re trying to do, it can only cloud what you’re really trying to get accomplished.""Hill's statement seems like a calculated move to shift focus from his personal legal issues back to his game.By calling the allegations ""noise,"" he made it clear that he wants to separate the situation, steering clear of directly addressing the claims so they don't mess with his sports career and team objectives.Hill's reply is rooted in a heated divorce battle with Keeta Vaccaro, his wife since November 2023. TMZ reports that Vaccaro claimed there were eight incidents of domestic violence that took place starting in January 2024.The claims were laid out in documents tied to their ongoing divorce proceedings in a Florida court. Vaccaro has accused his spouse of physical abuse throughout their marriage, but the initial reports didn't go into specifics about each incident. These documents were included in Vaccaro's plea for protective measures and financial assistance during the separation.Ever since Hill married Vaccaro in a hurry in the middle of the 2023 NFL, the relationship between both women attracted a great deal of attention. In January 2024 they originally filed divorce, but had briefly gotten back together before Vaccaro filed a repeat filing in May 2024.Together with the recent happenings related to a household brutality accusation, their legal battle has gotten all the more complex, continuing to debate on property and custody of children.The NFL has started looking into the allegations, as a league spokesperson confirmed in a statement to ESPN on Wednesday, September 10, 2025. The spokesperson mentioned, ""It is standard policy for the league to review a matter such as this,"" showing that the investigation is still in process and continuing.According to the NFL's Personal Conduct Policy, players might get disciplined, which can include suspensions, if any violations are proven, even if there aren't any criminal charges. They didn't give a timeline for when the investigation will be done.Miami Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel spoke about the situation in a press conference at the team's facility.

Draymond Green doubts Josh Allen’s ability to “be the guy”



Do Josh Allen’s playoff struggles justify Green’s criticism?



The Buffalo Bills head into Week 2 of the NFL season riding high after a dramatic 41-40 comeback win over the Baltimore Ravens. Quarterback Josh Allen once again showcased his brilliance, throwing for nearly 400 yards and adding two rushing scores. Yet, not everyone is convinced he can lead Buffalo to the promised land. Golden State Warriors star Draymond Green has made his doubts loud and clear, and his words are sure to stir debate among football fans.Speaking with NFL insider Jordan Schultz, Green did not mince words when asked about Allen’s standing among top quarterbacks. “He’s not the guy,” Green said bluntly. “Yeah, no. And like I said before, Josh Allen is like a damn good quarterback, but just because he’s a damn good quarterback, don’t make you a guy. He’s never going to get it done when it matters the most.”Green, a four-time NBA champion, pointed out that true greatness is defined by postseason success. For him, Allen’s lack of a Super Bowl appearance overshadows his regular-season heroics. “Jalen Hurts is the guy. Patty Mahomes is the guy. Josh Allen isn’t the guy, when it matters the most,” Green added. “By the way, they can go at me all they want until they win a Super Bowl, I’m right.”His comments came despite Allen’s spectacular Week 1 performance, which many considered a statement game to open Buffalo’s season.While Green’s assessment may sound harsh, the numbers do highlight a frustrating truth for the Bills. Allen has made 13 playoff starts but has yet to reach the Super Bowl — the most postseason starts without an appearance for any active quarterback. Time and again, Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs have blocked Buffalo’s path, leaving Allen and his team stuck on the outside looking in.That said, Allen’s individual playoff performances have rarely been the issue. He owns a strong passer rating of around 100 in the postseason, with big plays both through the air and on the ground. In many of Buffalo’s exits, the defense has faltered at critical moments, making it difficult to pin all the blame on the quarterback.For now, Green’s critique hangs over Allen’s legacy. Regular-season magic has never been in question, but until Buffalo breaks through with a Super Bowl run, skeptics like Green will keep questioning whether Allen is truly “the guy.”Also Read: ""Eliminate distractions"": Julian Edelman spills truth on Bill Belichick’s no-nonsense dating advice before coach’s romance with Jordon Hudson","Draymond Green says Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen is not ""the guy"" Allen has made 13 playoff starts but has yet to reach the Super Bowl.

NFL star Julian Edelman weighs in on Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson



Julian Edelman reacts to Bill Belichick coaching Tar Heels



Former New England Patriots star Julian Edelman has opened up about his old coach, Bill Belichick, and his new relationship. Speaking to People, Edelman reflected on the legendary coach’s long-standing philosophy of “eliminating distractions” and admitted he found it ironic that Belichick’s own girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, is now drawing headlines.Bill Belichick, 73, is regarded as one of the greatest football coaches of all time, with six Super Bowl victories under his belt. He is now leading the North Carolina Tar Heels, but off the field, his relationship with 24-year-old Jordon Hudson has become a talking point. The couple, who share a 48-year age gap, met in 2021 and went public in early 2023.Edelman, who played 12 seasons under Belichick in New England, recalled how strict his coach was when it came to focus. “Everyone has their life outside of the sport. What he always told me is that we had to eliminate distractions. So, I don’t know. You could take what you want with that,” Edelman said.The former wide receiver even remembered times when Belichick scolded him for letting personal matters interfere with football. “I remember getting yelled at for being a distraction, so I think we’re all in the business of eliminating distractions.That’s just from what I learned from him.”The comments highlight the irony many fans see today: a coach who once preached about avoiding outside noise is now under the spotlight for his own personal life. For Edelman, it seems like a reminder that no one, not even Belichick, is immune to distractions.Beyond Belichick’s personal life, Edelman also shared his thoughts on seeing his former coach back on the sidelines. Watching North Carolina’s first games of the season, he was impressed by the energy and execution. “The first thing that came to my mind, ‘They look great in that first drive.’ Boy, did they look good. Man, Coach Belichick had them firing on all cylinders,” Edelman said.Still, Edelman acknowledged that Belichick faces challenges with a roster full of fresh faces. “TCU looked like they had a bunch of really good football players, and North Carolina had 70 new players on the roster. That’s a lot of players, and they have some catching up to do in that talent department.”Despite those hurdles, Edelman believes Belichick’s presence brings attention and credibility. “It was good to see him follow up that first week with the win against Charlotte, which he needed to win, but we’ll see how he does this week.”For Edelman, watching Belichick adapt to a new chapter is both exciting and ironic. The same coach who once drilled “eliminate distractions” into his players is now navigating distractions of his own.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes' wife Brittany seemingly speaks out on Charlie Kirk’s death with cryptic post about hate and division","Former New England Patriots star Julian Edelman has opened up about his old coach, Bill Belichick, and his new relationship.

Brown’s tweet raises shocking allegations, suggesting Zinn was involved in both the 9/11 attacks and a recent attempt on conservative commentator Charlie Kirk's life.Antonio Brown, known for making headlines off the field as much as on, tweeted: ""Wait a minute.... The Jew that was used as a decoy in the Charlie Kirk assassination was also used for 9/11 propaganda? YOU CAN’T MAKE THIS SHIT UP.""His comments followed a tweet from Jackson Hinkle, who claimed a resurfaced video shows George Zinn confessing to being part of a diversion during the alleged Charlie Kirk assassination attempt. The video allegedly shows Zinn linking Al Qaeda to the 9/11 attacks immediately after witnessing the collapse of the Twin Towers.Antonio Brown’s tweet quickly drew widespread attention, but it also raised significant backlash. Many have condemned the post as anti-Semitic and dangerous, noting that it fuels baseless conspiracy theories while putting individuals at risk.The identity and role of George Zinn remain highly controversial, and there has been no verified evidence linking him to either 9/11 or the Charlie Kirk incident.Despite this, conspiracy theorists have latched onto the narrative, further muddying the waters of public discourse.

Jacksonville Jaguars rookie Travis Hunter is making headlines both on and off the field.

The couple managed to keep the pregnancy a secret until after the baby boy’s arrival, stunning fans across the league.

Meanwhile, Hunter received advice from none other than his former coach Deion Sanders, who reminded him that fatherhood will shape him just as much as football will.While Hunter is embracing life as a new dad, his professional responsibilities are growing too. In Week 1, the rookie impressed by playing 87.5% of the Jaguars’ offensive snaps, recording six catches. Head coach Liam Coen confirmed that the team now plans to expand Hunter’s defensive role as well.“The goal is to increase and continue to increase,” Coen said. “It just so happens that we’re playing Cincinnati with two good wideouts this week.”The Jaguars face the Bengals in Week 2, and Hunter’s two-way potential could be a difference-maker.

NFL’s biggest early-season spectacle could draw record 30 million viewers



Eagles-Chiefs rivalry continues to fuel fan interest



In a time when divisions often define society, the NFL still manages to bring people together. On Sunday, nearly 30 million Americans are expected to gather around their screens for the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs’ highly anticipated Week 2 clash. Media insiders told The Athletic that Fox is projecting a record-breaking audience, setting the stage for one of the most-watched September games in NFL history.This isn’t just another early-season matchup. It is the 11th time in NFL history that a Super Bowl rematch takes place the very next season, and only the fourth to happen this early. Historically, the defending champion has won seven of the previous 10 rematches. With those stakes in play, Sunday’s game already feels bigger than Week 2 football.For Fox, the setup could not be more favorable. Competing games on CBS feature smaller markets, leaving the national spotlight solely on Eagles-Chiefs. Add in the fact that both teams draw strong fan bases, and it becomes clear why projections are climbing. If the broadcast reaches 30 million, it would surpass last year’s Week 2 record of 27.87 million from Bengals-Chiefs and challenge the all-time September mark of 31.1 million, set in 1993.Fox is treating the showdown like a playoff game. “Fox NFL Sunday” will air its first-ever two-hour pregame show on location, broadcasting from Kansas City’s Power & Light District and Arrowhead Stadium. Producers say they expect more than 3,000 fans to watch the pregame broadcast in person, bringing a festival-like atmosphere before kickoff.Richie Zyontz, the game’s producer for Fox, compared the event to NASCAR’s Daytona 500, saying, “Boom, right out of the box, you’ve got the biggest event of the year.” He added that the early-season timing forces the network to sharpen up quickly: “Truth be spoken, it would be great if it was cold and it was November or December, but it certainly gets us to shake out the cob webs early in the season and really sharpen up for what should be a great game. ”This is not the first time these two teams have drawn monster ratings. Their Super Bowl LIX meeting attracted a record 127.7 million viewers, while their 2023 regular-season clash pulled in more than 29 million, making it the most-watched Monday night game in nearly three decades.The NFL has strategically stacked its early schedule with marquee games, but Sunday’s matchup is clearly the crown jewel. Whether or not it breaks the September record, the Eagles-Chiefs showdown will showcase once again why the NFL remains America’s most powerful television force.Also Read: NFL clarifies decision to observe moment of silence for Charlie Kirk during Packers-Commanders game","NFL’s biggest early-season spectacle could draw record 30 million viewers on Sunday.

Why the NFL chose to honor Charlie Kirk and what it signifies

The NFL’s ongoing commitment to social responsibility

During Thursday night’s Packers vs. Commanders game broadcast on Prime Video, the NFL took an unexpected step by asking fans to join in a moment of silent reflection. The public address announcer solemnly declared, “The National Football League asks that you please join us in a moment of silent reflection following the murder of Charlie Kirk. The NFL condemns all violence in our communities. It will take all of us to stop hate. Thank you.”This decision was not made by the Green Bay Packers, but by the NFL itself, reflecting the league's stance against violence and hate in society. When asked by ProFootballTalk about the gesture and whether it would be repeated at other Week 2 games, the NFL responded that “last night’s moment was the league’s decision. It’s up to the clubs for this Sunday’s games.”Historically, the NFL has held moments of silence or tributes during emotionally charged or tragic events. From memorials for victims of school shootings and attacks on places of worship to recognizing international tragedies like the Hamas attacks in 2023, the league has consistently shown a willingness to use its platform to raise awareness and promote unity.In 2025 alone, the NFL has already integrated several tributes into its calendar.Notably, “Lift Every Voice and Sing” has been a regular performance since 2020, first introduced in response to the murder of George Floyd. The league also honored victims of the 345 Park Avenue attack, the Bourbon Street terrorist attack, and multiple fatal crashes impacting NFL families.Also Read: “F**ing finally”: Chris Kluwe’s controversial comments stir debate after Charlie Kirk’s assassination This silent reflection serves as a stark reminder that football is more than just a game. It is a platform with a powerful voice, one the NFL continues to use to confront pressing social issues.

Packers Jayden Reed's injury could be a plot twist, believes Andy Herman

Packers’ depth and strategy could soften the blow of Jayden Reed’s absence

The Green Bay Packers have made one of their strongest starts in recent memory, beginning the 2025 season 2-0 for the first time since 2020. In just four days, they beat last year’s NFC runner-up and the reigning NFC North champions by a combined 54-31, sending a clear message to the league. But while the early dominance has lifted spirits in Green Bay, the story took a sudden turn with Jayden Reed’s injury.Reed left Thursday night’s victory with a shoulder injury that is expected to sideline him for several weeks. Though not season-ending, the setback comes at a time when the second-year wide receiver had quickly established himself as a reliable option for Jordan Love in key situations. Losing him is no small blow, especially for an offense that had finally found rhythm against quality defenses.While the injury might appear damaging on the surface, some within Packers circles see it differently. An insider view suggests Reed’s absence could actually serve as a “blessing in disguise.” The wideout had been battling a Jones fracture in his foot since training camp, an injury that usually lingers throughout the season. The forced rest gives Reed the rare opportunity to recover from both the shoulder setback and his lingering foot issue, potentially returning closer to full strength later in the campaign.Even with Jayden Reed sidelined, the Packers have options to keep their offense moving. Romeo Doubs, Dontayvion Wicks, and rookie Matthew Golden are expected to take on larger roles, while Matt LaFleur’s flexible offensive schemes allow the team to adapt personnel without losing efficiency. Combined with an early bye week, Green Bay is well-positioned to minimize the impact of Reed’s absence.Also Read: Meet Jake Ferguson’s parents: The driving force behind Cowboys Tight End’s rise to NFL Starting 2-0 for the first time in five years, the Packers are building more than just early momentum.

Marc-Andre Fleury returns to Pittsburgh Penguins after 22 NHL seasons

Marc-Andre Fleury honored with PTO as tribute in Pittsburgh

The Pittsburgh Penguins have taken a touching step to pay tribute to one of their legendary players by bringing goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury on board with a professional tryout contract (PTO). This gives Fleury, who played his first 13 seasons in the NHL with the team, a chance to hit the ice in Pittsburgh for a memorable preseason appearance.After a 22-season NHL career that concluded with the Minnesota Wild, Fleury is making his return. He was the first overall selection by the Penguins in the 2003 NHL Draft and began his professional career in Pittsburgh in the 2003-04 season.He stayed with the team all the way through the 2016-17 season, playing a key role in the franchise's achievements. The PTO signing is a meaningful full-circle moment, giving Fleury the chance to wear the black and gold of the Penguins again in front of their home crowd.The move to welcome Fleury back is driven by the organization's aim to pay tribute to his legacy and the close relationship he has with the team, the fans, and the city. In the press release, Dubas elaborated on the reasoning, mentioning, ""The entire Penguins organization is honored to welcome Marc-Andre Fleury back to the ice in Pittsburgh.This past year, everyone witnessed how beloved and respected Marc is in the game of hockey, but the adoration goes beyond his accolades and career. ”He later added, “Marc means so much to our team, our fans, and the City of Pittsburgh because of the person he is and the example he set. The Penguins feel he and his family are most deserving of this opportunity to celebrate this full-circle moment back where it all started in front of the black and gold faithful."".The main reason for giving Fleury the PTO was to honor his contributions and provide a festive farewell in the city where his NHL journey started. The press release emphasized Fleury's achievement as a three-time Stanley Cup champion with the Penguins in 2009, 2016, and 2017.It also highlighted his record-setting accomplishments in the franchise, such as 691 games played, 375 wins, and 44 shutouts, which are the best for any goaltender in Penguins history. These facts were shared straight from the Penguins' official announcement.Dubas's comments in the press release made it clear just how emotionally and culturally important Fleury is, highlighting his influence that goes beyond just numbers. The organization saw this as a great way to honor Fleury's character and the standard he set while he was with them, as reflected in Dubas's statements to the media in the release.Also Read: “Everyone’s got to find a new level”— Connor McDavid sets the tone for Edmonton Oilers heading into 2025–26 This PTO appearance is a cool way for the Penguins to mix nostalgia with their current preseason events, making sure Fleury's return is short but unforgettable.

Minnesota Wild negotiations with Kirill Kaprizov create uncertainty

What's Kirill Kaprizov's future in Minnesota?

Could Kirill Kaprizov secure a bigger payday elsewhere?

This may just be among the biggest contract decisions in franchise history as Kirill Kaprizov mulls over his future. Reports come in that the star right winger panned an eight-year extension promising him $128 million, the top pay in the NHL. The pressure on Minnesota is now mounting as the current deal expires in July of next year, and he will almost be an unrestricted free agent by then. Fans and analysts alike are asking if Kaprizov will remain in the State of Hockey or go for a record-grossing deal elsewhere.GM Bill Guerin has tried to calm the worries: he said talks between the players' representatives and the organization are ongoing; there is no panic within the organization. He also emphasized the good relationship between the team and the player's camp.Beyond those reassurances, the fact remains that Kaprizov never gave his word on the Wild’s offer. For the fans, the uncertainty is deeply unsettling. Kaprizov is not merely a top scorer, but the very pulse of the franchise. Should he go away, the team loses strength, and the Wild loses the intention of hanging out among the occasional contenders.His contract decision is also expected to have a bearing on the negotiations that other elite forwards across the league will go through.Insiders have revealed that Kaprizov’s camp believes they can fetch something between $18 and $19 million annually, especially with the salary cap expected to inch higher in the coming years. Some even conjecture that he might rather wait till Connor McDavid’s next contract is settled because that will certainly set the market.While speculation abounds that a short-term contract will lead to multiple lucrative contracts in the future, others maintain that he still wants to stick to the long-term side. However, rumors have it that a trade request might have surfaced, but sources close to the Wild strongly deny that the Wild management has asked for lists of preferred destinations.Also Read: Jack Eichel’s contract year: Will the Vegas Golden Knights keep their superstar?

Why Mike Tyson’s Story Matters: Lessons on Resilience and Athlete Well-Being

’s recent revelation thatduring his boxing days has shaken his long time fans and admirers. The admission, made in September 2025, has reignited discussions about athlete health, the dangers of prescription opioids, and the hidden struggles elite competitors face while trying to perform at the highest levels.During an interview on the Katie Miller Podcast, Tyson openly admitted that he used fentanyl “quite a few times” in the late 1990s to alleviate excruciating pain in his toe after fights. He explained how he initially thought it was just another form of pain medication and used it as a patch. However, he soon realized the drug’s withdrawal effects were extremely harsh: “Once it wears off and you take the Band-Aid off, you start withdrawing, throwing up, just like if you were on heroin or something. ” Tyson’s testimony sheds light on how quickly reliance on strong opioids can spiral into dangerous dependence.Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid far stronger than many commonly known drugs - 100 times more potent than morphine and 50 times stronger than heroin. While approved by the FDA for managing extreme pain, fentanyl’s illicit use has contributed to a dramatic rise in overdose deaths. In the United States alone, more than 48,000 deaths were linked to fentanyl misuse last year.Tyson’s use of the drug underscores how even world-class athletes can resort to powerful painkillers without fully understanding the long-term consequences.When Mike Tyson first encountered fentanyl, it was a new and largely unknown substance. Even drug commissioners and fight regulators hadn’t widely recognized its potency and risks at the time. Tyson recalled asking a friend, “Can I use this? Nobody ever heard of it,” highlighting his initial ignorance. He only discontinued its use after learning it was classified as a narcotic and could endanger his boxing career.This confession adds to Tyson’s long history of substance abuse, which includes struggles with cocaine and alcohol during and after his boxing career. In the years following his retirement, Tyson has become a vocal advocate for legal cannabis and openly discusses his past battles with addiction. Through his podcast Hotboxin’ with Mike Tyson, he shares his experiences and now promotes cannabis as a safer alternative to prescription opioids, arguing that it carries far fewer risks than fentanyl, heroin, or alcohol.Mike Tyson’s admission has sparked an important conversation about how athletes cope with chronic pain. The pressure to perform despite injuries often drives them toward opioids and other substances. Tyson is far from alone in this experience - his close friend and fellow boxer Arturo Gatti also suffered from a prolonged opioid addiction. Tyson’s story shines a light on the temptation and danger athletes face, while encouraging discussions about better pain management strategies, increased awareness, and stricter oversight of prescription drugs.At 59 years old, Tyson remains a prominent figure in the boxing world. Following his controversial defeat to Jake Paul in November 2024, he is reportedly preparing for an exhibition match with Floyd Mayweather in spring 2026. As Tyson continues to speak candidly about his past, his legacy is being shaped not only by his achievements inside the ring but also by his efforts to raise awareness about athlete welfare and substance abuse.Mike Tyson’s journey serves as a powerful reminder of both the human cost of professional sports and the resilience required to confront personal demons. His openness offers a rare, no-filter glimpse into the physical and emotional toll of competing at the highest levels. More importantly, it has reignited a broader discussion about athlete health, the dangers of opioid misuse, and the need for better support systems to ensure long-term well-being.","Mike Tyson used fentanyl to manage severe pain in the late 1990s.

Quinn Hughes opens up about his concerns

What the Canucks must deliver to keep their star

The Vancouver Canucks are entering a make-or-break stretch, and no player has made that point more than Quinn Hughes. The star defenseman has pointed out that his becoming a Vancouverite depends on whether the team can be competitive in the immediate few years. Hughes has a contract with the Canucks until 2027, so he's not looking to jump ship right now. Yet, he's been very open about the Canucks having to show that they can go after the Stanley Cup to retain him for the long haul.In a Sportsnet's 32 Thoughts Podcast, Quinn Hughes unapologetically admitted another dismal campaign would test his loyalty. By all means, in the prior season, Hughes had appeared outstanding, worthy of a Norris Award, but the Canucks could not grasp hold of consistency, spilling out dramas and awful performances. Hughes was frustrated that there was no winning culture supporting his efforts. It seems like a shout from the heavens: The team should not only barely squeeze in through the playoffs, but the team needs to compete with the best in the league. Otherwise, he may consider moving on, possibly even to join his brothers Jack and Luke sometime soon.There have been several attempts at changing the momentum thus far in Vancouver.Adam Foote has been promoted to the key coaching post, the front office acquired the power forward Evander Kane, and respective contract extensions were handed out for Thatcher Demko, Brock Boeser, and Conor Garland. The more pressing question is still on the core players; that is, for Demko to start well in goal and for Elias Pettersson to find his elite scoring touch once more after he has had a career-worst season. With teams such as Vegas, Edmonton, and Los Angeles seeming clear-cut playoff locks, the Canucks simply cannot afford to go into the tank again. Hughes best said it: winning brings happiness back into the room - and convincing him to stay will only come through winning.Also Read: Twitter explodes after Kirill Kaprizov reportedly rejects $128M extension Quinn Hughes has set forth a note.

His candid reflections, the circumstances of his accident, and the support he’s received have resonated deeply with baseball fans, prompting wider discussions about stadium safety, responsible fan behavior, and resilience in the face of injury.On April 30, during an intense matchup between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Chicago Cubs, Markwood’s celebration took a disastrous turn. As Pirates star Andrew McCutchen hit a crucial RBI double, Markwood - overcome with excitement - leapt from his front-row seat atop the Roberto Clemente Wall in right field. Moments later, he lost his balance, fell headfirst over the railing, and plunged 21 feet onto the warning track below. The entire stadium fell silent as players from both teams immediately signaled for medical assistance. The game was halted while emergency personnel rushed to carry Markwood off the field on a stretcher, transforming the festive atmosphere into one of shock and concern.The impact of the fall left Kavan Markwood with life-threatening injuries.He suffered a broken back and neck, a punctured lung, and fractures to every rib - describing the condition bluntly as “broken everything.” Doctors at Allegheny General Hospital quickly stabilized him, placing him in critical care and connecting him to a breathing machine. Medical professionals also confirmed he had a brain injury and required extensive physical therapy and rehabilitation. Support poured in from family, friends, and fans, with a GoFundMe campaign raising more than $53,000 to help cover medical expenses and ongoing care.Markwood’s path to recovery has been fraught with persistent pain and physical limitations. In a heartfelt interview with Inside Edition, he shared, “I wake up with pain every day. My arm, I can’t feel my two fingers still.

Team form, key players, and what to expect

The marquee team, Al-Ittihad, will be hosting Al-Fateh in Round 2 of the 2025–26 Saudi Pro League, where both teams will give it a fight. The defending champions, Al-Ittihad, will be in the spotlight in tonight’s match. In their first match, the reigning champions, managed by Laurent Blanc, brushed aside Al-Okhdood 5-2, while Al-Fateh slumped to a surprising 1-0 home defeat to Al-Fayha. The game provides Al-Ittihad a chance to reaffirm their title contender status at home, with Al-Fateh looking to come out to play and upset.The highly anticipated matchup is scheduled for Friday, 12 September 2025, at the Al-Inma Bank Stadium in King Abdullah Sport City, Jeddah.Kick-off times:Where to watch:Al-Ittihad will come into this game in some intense attacking form. Although they showed some cracks in the defensive unit corridor against here, a 5-2 opening win, this showcased the firepower out there. The opponent was hit with a hat-trick from star striker Karim Benzema that evening, where he once again established his place as their number one source of attack. There will be plenty of goals and assists as well from winger Steven Bergwijn.Al-Fateh, in contrast, is expected to take a more patient and counter-attacking style. Combining Youssouf and Bendebka in midfield will be vital for them to keep the ball and transition into the attack. Defensive issues remain a concern, and they will face their biggest test yet as they try to handle the pressure on the road.Also Read: Will Karim Benzema play tonight against Al-Fateh? Latest update on Al-Ittihad star’s availability History strongly favors Al-Ittihad. They also benefited from their home fans as they have clinched their most recent five league clashes against Al-Fateh in Jeddah. This will leave Al-Fateh hoping to remain tactically disciplined and score from set pieces or capitalize on the few opportunities that come their way. If Al-Ittihad can keep up their attacking threat without being too careless, they are very much the favorites for all three points.Prediction: Al-Ittihad 3-1 Al-Fateh. The champions are likely to dictate possession and have a larger share of goal-scoring opportunities, though Al-Fateh could get on the score sheet via the counter or from a set piece.","Al-Ittihad host Al-Fateh in Round 2 of the 2025–26 Saudi Pro League.

How Josh Jacobs could impact Thursday Night Football in Week 2

Josh Jacobs remains one of the biggest offensive weapons for the Green Bay Packers, and fans are eager to know if he will suit up for the primetime showdown against the Washington Commanders. With Green Bay looking to build early momentum in the 2025 NFL season, Jacobs’ availability is crucial to their offensive rhythm and overall game plan at Lambeau Field tonight. The clash comes under the bright lights of Thursday Night Football in NFL Week 2, adding even more spotlight to this matchup.Yes, Josh Jacobs is expected to play against the Washington Commanders. He has not been listed with any injury designation, and his Week 1 performance showed he is in good shape to lead the Packers’ rushing attack. Fantasy projections give him a near-certain chance of being active, meaning fans can count on seeing him on the field for Thursday Night Football fantasy points and NFL rushing stats.Jacobs got off to a solid start in Week 1, but he could be in line for a much bigger performance in Week 2. Even though Thursday games often bring concern because of the short turnaround, Jacobs reportedly embraces the challenge. According to ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler, Jacobs could be “primed for a big role” on Thursday night, and he is pushing for a “rather large volume of touches.”Thursday, September 11, 20258:15 p.m. ETLambeau Field, Green Bay, WisconsinAmazon Prime VideoIn Week 2 of Thursday Night Football, the Green Bay Packers will take on the Washington Commanders at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The game kicks off at 8:15 p.m. ET, setting up an exciting primetime NFC matchup.Josh Jacobs has a quality that bettors love to see in running backs: he is Green Bay’s favorite goal-line option. In 2024, he scored 15 rushing touchdowns, many of which came in the red zone. While Jacobs isn’t known for breaking off long runs, he thrives in short-yardage situations, running with power and determination.Also Read: Miami Dolphins’ Week 1 struggles could turn real ugly with direct connection to Tyreek Hill trade talks and Mike McDaniel’s job uncertainty Washington, meanwhile, did an excellent job of stifling the New York Giants’ rushing attack in Week 1. However, the Giants’ offensive line has been a major weakness, particularly with Andrew Thomas sidelined. Green Bay, by contrast, boasts one of the strongest offensive lines in the league, giving Jacobs an advantage in the trenches. While he might not crack 100 yards on the ground this week, his chances of finding the end zone remain very high.","Green Bay Packers running back Josh Jacobs is expected to play in Thursday Night Football.

Let’s gauge through the emotions each of these women went through when they were in a relationship with the Ayahuasca Retreat lover, Aaron Rodgers.Shailene Woodley described her relationship with former Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers in an interview with Melissa Johnson ofMagazine.actress said she had lost herself completely. She said she understood what anxiety and depression truly were. Her stylist, Kris Zero, would try her level best to keep theactress occupied, but she would feel depressed again.“I haven’t shared much about my relationship with Aaron(Rodgers) because it always makes me cry. It was not right. But it was beautiful. I had a really awful, traumatic thing happen in early 2022.I felt like I lost my soul, my self, my happiness, my joy. I really understood depression and anxiety, and like, complete soul detachment.”She chose to remain in a toxic situation because she was empathizing with someone else.“Empathy kind of kept me in this loop of feeling everything for everyone. I knew I was depressed when I looked at a tree and felt nothing. That was the lowest low of my life.”Shailene Woodley’s stylist, Kris Zero, would wake her up with blasting music just to get her out of bed. “Sometimes I was so angry at her. But then we’d go surf, and for ten minutes that day, I thought life could be okay again.Then the depression would come back, and she’d out–We’re volunteering at the horse ranch! – and we’d find a random f*cking horse ranch and we’d clean up horse sh*t.We’d clean hooves and brush the horses, and for 20 minutes that day, I thought like could be okay again. And then depression came back, and she’d wake up the next morning and go–Let’s go on a hike and bring trash bags and clean up trash!”Melissa reported that after about six months, the depression started to fade.Olivia Munn, theactress, appeared on thepodcast, where she talked about a past relationship in which she felt trapped in a tumultuous family dynamic. She said that her therapist encouraged her to stay in the relationship that she wanted to get out of.“I had a therapist who I really loved, and I know that she cared about me, or at least I thought she did. I would constantly, from the very beginning, say–I don’t know about this, I don’t think this is the right(relationship), I want to get out. I gotta get out,” Munn said.Theactress said her therapist encouraged her to stay in that relationship. “She thought that my ‘picker’ was off, and she would look at it as: this person on paper looked great. And when there was couples therapy, they knew how to present the right way. Then the stories I would tell seemed unbelievable.From that experience, learning that I gotta go with my gut and I gotta be decisive with some things if it’s coming from a place where I want to survive, and I realize that I’m not happy, and that days and weeks and months go by of unhappiness and fear.I don’t know if there’s a word to describe what that relationship was like. It was without a doubt the hardest period of my life, being in that,” she said she felt “really trapped in a tumultuous family dynamic.”Munn further said that the relationship taught her to stand up for herself. “It taught me how to stand up and fight for myself, so that was great. I truly had no idea that I could be manipulated and hurt that way, that I wouldn’t just get out of something that was dangerous to my psyche.It’s not just the period that you’re with the person, but, if you’re lucky to get out, (it’s) the years of healing yourself afterwards,” Munn told Lewinsky.She further shared, “The catalyst was getting out of a relationship that had drained me and left me just really...it's hard, I don't know if there's a word to describe it what that relationship was like...it was, without a doubt, the hardest period of my life, being in that.”Danica Patrick, the former professional racing driver and model, appeared onpodcast, where she disclosed that she was in an emotionally abusive relationship with the 41-year-old quarterback, Aaron Rodgers.“The breakup with Aaron(Rodgers) in 2020—because it was sudden, it felt like it was my life. When you live with somebody, it’s your whole life—your dentist appointments, your hairdo, your clothes, your mailing address, everything. Because the nature of the relationship was emotionally abusive, it wore me down to nothing.Something that people could never imagine is that I would lack any confidence or belief in the simple things about who I am. Everything was torn to bits.He leaves a trail of blood. I don’t think I’m saying too much earth-shattering stuff; there’s been enough out there.But it gave me the greatest gift, which was myself—how much I needed to show up for myself, take care of myself,” Patrick told Sage Steele.The former IndyCar Series and NASCAR driver said she felt like she was built for hard things when she was in a relationship with Rodgers,“Hindsight, I ignored it(emotionally abusive relationship), but in real life, it was just like, I would say all the time—I’m built for hard things. I can handle hard things. And so, I just saw it as a hard thing, and my nature is to try harder and do more.What if I don't do it for the right person? What if I get too proud and go like—I'm just I'm done. Instead of going—Man, just try a little harder. What if you look back and think—Man, I wish I would have tried. I would never want that in my life. I wish I would have tried. This is probably why I don't have regret and I don't have shame.”","Aaron Rodgers’ former partners have shared powerful excerpts from their past relationships, including phrases like “Depression would come,” “Dangerous to my psyche,’ and “Emotionally abusive.” Thanks to the podcast world, women have started expressing themselves beyond the fear of judgment.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123764899,imgsize-3192143,width-400,resizemode-4/nfl-aaron-rodgers.jpg"

""Agar main dive maar raha hoon iska matlab main theek se move nahi kar raha (If I am diving it means, I am not moving and anticipating quickly),"" quipped India all-rounder Hardik Pandya after missing a catch.He was conversing with Team India fielding coach T Dilip, who had introduced a new drill for the Indian cricketers in the ongoing Asia Cup TimesofIndia.com has learnt that Dilip had come up with the idea to enhance the ability of Indian cricketers to cut the gaps in the field.It is like a goalkeeper's drill. There was a goalpost-sized safety net put up by T Dilip far away from the batting nets. The task for each fielder was to protect their goal. And interestingly, the catching practice was being done with the new balls. The reason behind using the new ball for this drill was that it travels quickly.Each player was taking two sets of five catches, and just like they bat in the nets, they were changing guards.Hardik Pandya, after missing one, pulled off a stunner and immediately rushed to the fielding coach T Dilip and gave him a tight hug. The Indian all-rounder grabbed another blinder, which even left Shivam Dube impressed, who was watching the action from close quarters.After Hardik, vice-captain Shubman Gill and Rinku Singh , fresh from completing their batting practice, joined the fielding coach.Gill was outstanding. He took four full-stretched catches — two to his left and two to his right — and left Rinku and Dilip stunned. The fielding coach shouted, ""You are making it a habit.""Meanwhile, Rinku Singh struggled in his first set but bounced back in the second with a little help from Gill, who guided his former Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) teammate, and then Rinku was off the blocks.They were followed by Abhishek Sharma and Tilak Varma.Abhishek's first question was, ""Isn't it too big?"" The fielding coach smiled and said: ""You can pull it off easily."" And Abhishek did pass the test with flying colours. So did Tilak. The duo gave each other a fist pump before moving on to other fielding drills.The day started with all 15 Indian players divided into two groups.Each group was given three targets to hit. One was a full stump, the second was a half stump and then there was a back roller. It was Shivam Dube who hit the first target but it was Rinku Singh who won the drill. He was later awarded a medal by the fielding coach T Dilip.Team India’s strength and conditioning coach Adrian Le Roux has shed light on the Bronco Test, the latest fitness assessment introduced for the players.It looked like the players have started to adapt to the new fitness drill. Under the watchful eyes of Le Roux, the players were doing the 60-metre sprint and they were doing it four times to cover 240 metres by sprinting back and forth in a set sequence.The Bronco Test, widely used in rugby, is designed to push players’ aerobic and cardiovascular capacity to the limit.""We’ve now brought it into the team’s environment. It serves two purposes: we can use it as a training mechanism and also as a measurement. It gives us a clear picture of the players’ aerobic fitness and whether we’re moving in the right direction,"" Le Roux had told BCCI.TV recently.""If you’re physically prepared, you can play more seasons.

The Pittsburgh Steelers are set to take on the Seattle Seahawks on September 14, 2025, looking to kick off the season with a 2-0 record after their exciting 34-32 victory against the New York Jets in Week 1. Even with injuries keeping key defenders Joey Porter Jr., DeShon Elliott, and Derrick Harmon off the field, coach Mike Tomlin is still feeling optimistic.This game has a bit of a revenge angle, as DK Metcalf will be up against his old team following a trade in March 2025. Seattle, under the leadership of Sam Darnold, is eager to bounce back from their 17-13 defeat to the 49ers. Pittsburgh’s strong roster, featuring Jalen Ramsey and Darius Slay, is gearing up to take on Seattle’s fierce offense.Joey Porter Jr., who is the starting cornerback for the Steelers and was picked in the second round of the 2023 draft from Penn State, hurt his hamstring in the second half of the Week 1 victory against the Jets on September 7, 2025. The injury happened while he was covering a route, which made him leave the game after only 18 out of 19 snaps in the secondary.He couldn't make it back, and the Jets took advantage of his absence in the high-scoring game.After the game, Tomlin spoke to reporters in East Rutherford, New Jersey, ""Joey tweaked his hamstring — we'll evaluate it, but it's the usual bumps and bruises.""However, Porter did not participate in practice all week (DNP on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday), leading to his official ""out"" designation on the Friday report. ESPN's Brooke Pryor reported the ruling via X.Safety DeShon Elliott, who joined the team as a free agent from the Miami Dolphins in the 2024 offseason, suffered a knee injury classified as an MCL sprain during the second quarter of the game against the Jets. This occurred during a run play with Jets running back Breece Hall, where Elliott's left knee twisted awkwardly after another player collided with the side of his leg while he was tackling outside the pile.He was assisted off the field and didn't come back, with veteran Chuck Clark taking his place. Tomlin talked about it after the game on September 7, 2025, telling CBS Sports' Tracy Wolfson on the sidelines, ""DeShon's got a knee issue—we'll get imaging, but he's out for now.""Elliott was marked as DNP all week and was officially ruled out in Friday's report. A doctor who knows the team confirmed the diagnosis, telling the reporter, ""Elliott's MCL sprain should sideline him 2-4 weeks, similar to Harmon's timeline.""Elliott himself posted on Instagram on September 12, 2025, ""Be back soon—minor setback for a major comeback,"" addressing fans directly.Newbie defensive tackle Derrick Harmon, who was Pittsburgh's first-round selection (No. 18 overall) in the 2025 NFL Draft from Oregon (via Michigan State), has been coping with an MCL sprain since the preseason finale against the Carolina Panthers on August 21, 2025.The injury happened in the second quarter when Harmon took a weird fall while trying to tackle quarterback Jack Plummer during a clash with an offensive lineman. He was taken off the field on a cart, and Tomlin shared with reporters after the game at Acrisure Stadium, ""Derrick has a knee sprain of some description—he's being evaluated.""Harmon completely missed Week 1 and was DNP all week as he headed into Week 2, getting an ""out"" status on the Friday report.ESPN's insider Adam Schefter mentioned that the sprain would keep him out for roughly a month, which matches up with his ongoing absence.As a newcomer, Harmon demonstrated potential during training camp, receiving compliments from defensive line coach Karl Dunbar, ""Derrick's explosive—he's going to be a force inside."" His stats from college include 85 tackles and 5.5 sacks, but the injury has delayed his NFL impact.Despite these absences, the Steelers are ready to face off directly. The secondary includes experienced players like Jalen Ramsey, who is expected to go up against Smith-Njigba, and Darius Slay, forming a solid pair to handle Seattle's passing game.Brandin Echols is expected to fill in for Porter, with Tomlin noting in his September 12 presser to WPXI's Jenna Harner, ""Echols has versatility—he can play outside or slot."" The recent signing of Jabrill Peppers boosts our safety depth, as Tomlin shared with ESPN's Jeremy Fowler, ""Peppers is here because of Elliott's injury—he brings energy and experience."" Up front, Cameron Heyward and Keeanu Benton will anchor the line in Harmon's stead.Rodgers' connection with Metcalf—who's up against his former secondary—might be crucial for the offense. Tomlin finished his Week 2 preview on Steelers.com, telling the digital media crew,""Injuries happen, but we're built for this. Seattle's aggressive after their loss, but so are we.""Also Read: “All the noise can only cloud what you’re trying to accomplish” — Tyreek Hill responds to alleged domestic violence claims The Steelers' use of 12 personnel (two tight ends) was quite high in Week 1 at 53.7%, which is a stark contrast to how Seattle's defense dealt with it last season, creating a fascinating tactical battle. Pittsburgh is favored by 3 points, and while injuries are tough, the depth of the team and Tomlin's 'next man up' approach have them set to strive for a 2-0 record.","The Pittsburgh Steelers are set to take on the Seattle Seahawks on September 14, 2025, looking to kick off the season with a 2-0 record after their exciting 34-32 victory against the New York Jets in Week 1. Joey Porter Jr., DeShon Elliott, and Derrick Harmon are all expected to miss the game against the Seahawks. Porter Jr. hurt his hamstring in the second half of the Week 1 victory, while Elliott suffered an MCL sprain. Harmon was injured during the preseason finale against the Carolina Panthers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123863075,imgsize-73100,width-400,resizemode-4/joey-porter-jr.jpg"
