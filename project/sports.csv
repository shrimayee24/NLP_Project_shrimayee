'My job is to play': Haris Rauf stays calm as Pakistan ride out Asia Cup drama

Poll Do you think political posturing is overshadowing sportsmanship in cricket? Yes No

The Asia Cup has once again become a stage for political posturing rather than cricket . Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi has sparked outrage after posting a video of Cristiano Ronaldo making a fighter-jet gesture. The act is being seen as a deliberate provocation and an attempt to legitimise behaviour that has already drawn heavy criticism.This comes on the heels of Haris Rauf’s controversial ‘6-0’ and fighter-jet gesture during the Super Four clash against India in Dubai. Rauf’s actions, aimed at Indian fans chanting “Kohli, Kohli,” were slammed across social media as cheap, classless, and unbecoming of an international cricketer. Adding to the embarrassment, Sahibzada Farhan mimicked firing a gun with his bat, showing how quickly Pakistan ’s players turned a sporting contest into a theatre of political provocation.Instead of calming matters, Naqvi has only worsened the situation. A board chairman using Ronaldo’s image to back such behaviour has shocked fans, who expect administrators to rise above pettiness. Pakistan cricket, instead of focusing on its on-field struggles, is hiding behind provocative symbolism that damages the spirit of the game.While Pakistan wrestles with controversy, India have done their talking on the pitch. Abhishek Sharma ’s sparkling 75 set up a strong total, and Kuldeep Yadav alongside Varun Chakravarthy dismantled Bangladesh to seal a 41-run win on Tuesday. With this result, India stormed into the Asia Cup final, knocking out Sri Lanka and leaving Pakistan to battle Bangladesh in a virtual semifinal for the remaining spot.Naqvi’s actions, however, have ensured that Pakistan’s cricket remains in the headlines for the wrong reasons.",Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi has sparked outrage after posting a video of Cristiano Ronaldo making a fighter-jet gesture.

Micah Parsons vs Dak Prescott: A battle of respect and rivalry



Cowboys seek stability without Parsons in critical matchup



When Micah Parsons steps back into AT&T Stadium this Sunday wearing Green Bay colors, the spotlight won’t just be on his talent—it will be on his bond with former teammate Dak Prescott. The star pass rusher, now with the Packers, made it clear he plans to get after Prescott, even if it comes at a personal cost.Parsons admitted the matchup carries weight beyond football. “It’s going to be painful,” he said of sacking Prescott. “That’s my guy. He was always like a good mentor for me. But you know how it is. He always told me if I ever faced him that it'll be a great matchup, so I’m excited to see what Sunday brings itself.”Prescott, though, is hoping the “pain” doesn’t fall on him. With five sacks already allowed in three games, Dallas faces an even tougher challenge without two key linemen and top receiver CeeDee Lamb. Still, Prescott trusts his line and his preparation: “I hope it’s not (painful) for me. And I hope he doesn’t get to me… Just getting to go out there and compete with a guy that’s a good friend… I’m excited to go and have that matchup.While Parsons is eager for a “revenge” game, it’s not rooted in animosity. During his contract standoff with the Cowboys, Prescott and other teammates openly supported him. That respect has carried into this week, even as the Packers defense—with Parsons and Rashan Gary—enters the matchup with a league-leading 10 sacks.The Cowboys, meanwhile, continue to feel Parsons’ absence. Their defense has managed only four sacks this season while giving up explosive plays through the air. Defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus acknowledged the chatter around Parsons but insisted, “Our eyes are forward. We have guys in the building that we’re coaching, guys are working their tail off.”Prescott praised the Packers’ pass rush, calling it “great” and stressing how it changes the rhythm of a game. Yet, he downplayed the personal storyline. “This is Dallas Cowboys vs. the Green Bay Packers, and we’ve got to go get a win.”For fans, however, the duel between Parsons and Prescott is unavoidable. It’s a clash of friendship, loyalty, and competition—one that could define Sunday’s outcome.Also Read: Tory Horton emerging as Seattle’s breakout star and earning Justin Jefferson comparisons","Parsons admitted the matchup carries weight beyond football.

Rookie Tory Horton makes an early impact on offense and special teams

Why Tory Horton’s rise matters for Seattle’s offensive identity

The Seattle Seahawks took a bold step this offseason by parting ways with veterans Tyler Lockett and DK Metcalf, signaling a new era for their passing game. While many expected Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Cooper Kupp to dominate early on, it’s rookie wide receiver Tory Horton who is stealing headlines with his dynamic play.Through his first games in the NFL , Horton has been making the most of his opportunities. He has converted eight targets into five receptions for 64 yards and two touchdowns, proving himself to be a reliable red-zone weapon. Beyond his contributions as a receiver, he has also impressed on special teams with six punt returns totaling 156 yards.That dual-threat ability has not gone unnoticed by Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak. Having worked closely with Justin Jefferson during his time with the Minnesota Vikings, Kubiak drew a direct comparison between the rookie and the All-Pro wideout, saying Horton’s skill set reminds him of Jefferson’s early career flashes. For a young player, such praise speaks volumes about his ceiling.Cooper Kupp’s underwhelming start, with just 136 yards and no touchdowns so far, has created an opening for Horton to carve out a bigger role.Smith-Njigba has lived up to expectations with solid production, but Horton’s versatility and explosiveness bring a new wrinkle to the offense.With Kubiak’s history of developing Jefferson into one of the league’s best receivers, Horton is in a prime situation to grow into a legitimate star. If his early performances are a sign of what’s ahead, the Seahawks may have found their next franchise wideout.Also Read: Kenneth Walker trade prediction: Why the Patriots could make a bold move for the Seahawks running back Tory Horton’s emergence adds excitement to Seattle’s future and raises the possibility that fans could be watching the beginning of another Justin Jefferson–like rise, only this time in a Seahawks uniform.",Rookie wide receiver Tory Horton is stealing headlines with his dynamic play.

Kenneth Walker trade prediction: Why the Patriots could make a bold move for the Seahawks running back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/kenneth-walker-trade-prediction-why-the-patriots-could-make-a-bold-move-for-the-seahawks-running-back/articleshow/124136652.cms,"Kenneth Walker's future with the Seattle Seahawks is uncertain due to Zach Charbonnet's increasing role, fueling trade rumors as the deadline nears. The New England Patriots emerge as a potential destination, seeking backfield stability after recent costly fumbles. While Walker outperforms Charbonnet statistically, Seattle aims to integrate the younger back more.

Seattle’s running back dilemma may push Kenneth Walker out

Why New England emerges as the most logical landing spot

Kenneth Walker’s future with the Seattle Seahawks remains uncertain as the team leans more on Zach Charbonnet. With the trade deadline approaching, speculation grows that Walker could be moved. Among possible destinations, the New England Patriots stand out, needing stability in their backfield after costly fumbles in recent weeks.The Seattle Seahawks entered the season with Kenneth Walker listed as their starter, but the coaching staff’s reliance on Zach Charbonnet has kept trade speculation alive. Walker, who currently leads the team with 163 rushing yards on 39 carries, is producing at a higher rate than Charbonnet, who has just 57 yards on 27 attempts.Still, Seattle seems committed to finding more ways to integrate the younger back. With the team eyeing a playoff push, dealing Walker could allow the Seahawks to plug roster holes before the trade deadline.If Walker becomes available, the New England Patriots appear to be the most natural suitor. Their backfield has been shaky, as fumbles from Rhamondre Stevenson and Antonio Gibson directly cost them a key game against the Pittsburgh Steelers.While rookie TreVeyon Henderson has generated excitement, the Patriots’ coaching staff has been cautious about giving him too much responsibility too soon.ESPN’s Dan Graziano explained, “As for the Patriots, I know all eyes in the fantasy community are on the running back situation after Rhamondre Stevenson fumbled twice and Antonio Gibson fumbled once in that painful loss to the Steelers... They seem reluctant to hand a full-time, between-the-tackles role to Henderson at this early stage.”Adding Walker to the mix would immediately stabilize the Patriots’ offense. His power, balance, and ability to gain yards after contact make him an ideal complement to Henderson. Over his four NFL seasons, Walker has already compiled 2,749 rushing yards and 28 touchdowns—production that signals reliability.Also Read: Bills superstar Josh Allen shares his ultimate buffalo wings guide with one shocking underrated choice included If Bill Belichick and his staff want to avoid putting too much pressure on a rookie while also holding veterans accountable, Walker is the missing piece. Pairing him with Henderson could give New England one of the league’s most balanced backfields, allowing them to protect the ball, control tempo, and keep their offense moving.","Kenneth Walker’s future with the Seattle Seahawks remains uncertain as the team leans more on Zach Charbonnet.

NFL insider weighs in on how Kirk Cousins can be linked to three teams amid Raheem Morris’ controversial statement



Kirk Cousins has stayed away from making any statements about his future in the league



The Atlanta Falcons’ quarterback and one of the most popular players in the league, Kirk Cousins, is in a pretty awkward situation with his team. While there have been many speculations about Kirk Cousins’ time as a starter is now over because of Michael Penix Jr. , the Atlanta Falcons’ head coach, Raheem Morris, made things clear recently. Amid this, NFL insider Nate Davis thinks there might be a few teams that could sign Kirk Cousins.A few hours ago, the Atlanta Falcons’ head coach, Raheem Morris shocked fans as he said, “Kirk lost his job last year. We’re not even close to that with Mike [Penix]...”The head coach added, “He had a bad day. We had a bad day. Mike is our quarterback. We got a lot of confidence in Mike. We’re moving forward with Mike. Mike’s the guy.”While this has sparked chaos among fans, NFL insider USA Today’s Nate Davis weighed in on Kirk Cousins’ situation and linked him to possibly three teams.USA Today’s Nate Davis wrote, ""Acquiring him would be a break-glass-in-case-of-emergency situation….It would also require ample cap room from potential suitors given Cousins would be owed the prorated version of the $27.5 million he’s owed in base salary this season.”Nate Davis also weighed in on Kirk Cousins nearing 40 and recovering from his Achilles surgery. He added, “The conditions would certainly be specific – especially since Cousins’ no-trade clause permits him to kill any deal – but if a team like the Lions, Rams or Seahawks suddenly found itself with a long-term need behind center and lacking sufficient confidence that in-house backups could persevere for an extended period. ""Amid all the mess that the Atlanta Falcons’ quarterback, Kirk Cousins, has found himself in, he has stayed silent and has not made any statements about his current situation.The Atlanta Falcons have not had a good start in the new season as the team ended up losing in the first match against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and in its last match against the Carolina Panthers.With the Atlanta Falcons gearing up for a match against the Washington Commanders, all eyes are on the team.Also Read: “He pulled his d*ck out and licked my ears”: Stefon Diggs faces serious sexual assault allegations from Chris Blake Griffith as Cardi B defends her boyfriend",NFL insider weighs in on how Kirk Cousins can be linked to three teams amid Raheem Morris’ controversial statement.

Easton Cowan earns top-line role as standout performer in Toronto Maple Leafs preseason

Hildeby to lead as starter amid depth moves and Robertson’s absence

The Toronto Maple Leafs are set to take on the Montreal Canadiens in preseason action with a roster that leans heavily on youth and depth rather than veterans. Head coach Craig Berube and his staff are using this contest as another evaluation opportunity, giving players like Easton Cowan and Matias Maccelli prominent roles. With lineup spots still up for grabs, the game presents a critical test for several hopefuls.Easton Cowan continues to impress after a strong start to the preseason, skating on the top line alongside Scott Laughton and Steven Lorentz at the morning skate. His performance so far has not only drawn praise from Berube but also from captain Auston Matthews, suggesting he has a legitimate chance to crack the NHL roster out of camp. Cowan’s versatility and poise have made him one of the top storylines of Toronto’s preseason, and Thursday’s matchup offers another chance for him to showcase his readiness against NHL competition.Matias Maccelli is also in focus, shifting into a second-line role with Bobby McMann and David Kampf. After struggling last season, Berube emphasized that Maccelli needs to work his way up the lineup, making this assignment a key test.Having previously skated on the top line with Matthews and Matthew Knies, the Finnish winger now has the opportunity to prove he can be effective in a middle-six role.Goaltender Dennis Hildeby is the projected starter and is expected to carry the load against the Canadiens. After showing improved composure compared to his rookie season, Hildeby is positioning himself as a reliable option, especially with Joseph Woll sidelined. A strong performance in Montreal could solidify his chances of starting early in the regular season.The roster also includes Dakota Joshua, Philippe Myers, and Henry Thrun, providing further depth to the lineup. However, one notable omission is Nick Robertson, who impressed in the preseason opener but did not make the trip this time. His absence raises questions about his role moving forward, given his past opportunities during preseason travel assignments.With Cowan rising quickly and Maccelli working to re-establish himself, the Leafs’ preseason clash against the Canadiens is about opportunity and evaluation. Hildeby’s presence in net and Robertson’s absence only add to the intrigue. For Toronto, this matchup is less about the scoreline and more about determining who is ready to contribute when the regular season begins.Also Read: Jamie Benn day-to-day with upper-body injury as Dallas Stars continue preseason",The Toronto Maple Leafs take on the Montreal Canadiens on Thursday.

Auston Matthews, the Toronto Maple Leafs’ star player and one of the most talented players in the league, had spent the last season recovering from an upper body injury.

He was back here early in the summer. It is amazing; when he shows up, it seems like everyone else is here now, too. He was here probably a month before we got going, and with the preparation he puts toward his craft and the way he practices, he sets the standard.”Brad Treliving added, “He has been dialed in since the start of camp. He feels good physically. He looked dangerous [on Tuesday] in the first preseason game.”The Toronto Maple Leafs GM continued, “He is the tip of the spear for us, and everyone else follows.I have been really happy that, number one, he is healthy, ready, and looks good.”While Auston Matthews has not responded to the Toronto Maple Leafs GM Brad Treliving's comments about him, the star player looks fully ready and committed to return to the ice.At the last preseason game against the Ottawa Senators, Auston Matthews ended up scoring a goal but the Toronto Maple Leafs ended up losing the match 3-2.However, what surprised fans was how the Toronto Maple Leafs’ captain put together a couple of pucks to make a smiley face.

The NHL trade scenario is intensifying as two top defensemen, Quinn Hughes of the Vancouver Canucks and Rasmus Andersson of the Calgary Flames, face uncertain futures this season. With contract situations still unresolved and potential trades on the horizon, every game could influence their next move. How teams respond could significantly reshape the league’s defensive landscape this year.Detroit is reportedly monitoring Quinn Hughes closely as the Canucks navigate a crucial season. Hughes has recorded over 300 career NHL points in just six seasons, making him one of the top young defensemen in the league. The 25-year-old defenseman has been part of trade conversations ever since Canucks management hinted at his desire to eventually play alongside his brothers, Jack and Luke Hughes, both with the New Jersey Devils.Vancouver isn’t actively looking to move him, but a disappointing season could make Hughes hesitant to commit long-term, prompting the team to consider options. His ties to Michigan playing in the USA Hockey National Team Development Program and spending time with a collegiate program in the state make the Red Wings a natural landing spot.Detroit Hockey Now’s Bob Duff suggests that if Hughes is interested in returning to Michigan, the Red Wings might explore a deal, possibly including one of their top young prospects.Although Hughes has no no-trade protection, any potential trade would require assurance that he’s willing to sign an extension and play a central role in Detroit’s defensive core.Calgary Flames defenseman Rasmus Andersson could be entering a crucial season with the team. Andersson has consistently been among the Flames’ top defensemen in scoring, blocked shots, and average ice time, making him a critical piece for Calgary’s playoff ambitions. He is approaching unrestricted free agency next summer, and recent contract negotiations reportedly stalled, sparking speculation about a possible move. While some reports linked him to a few potential destinations, Andersson emphasized he isn’t restricting his options.Insiders suggest a trade could happen before the March 6 deadline, though a new deal with Calgary is still on the table. Despite the uncertainty, Andersson says he’s concentrating on his on-ice performance and is committed to staying professional for his teammates.Also Read: Anaheim Ducks Training Camp: Mason McTavish contract extension holdout creates NHL opportunities for young forwards With Quinn Hughes and Andersson both in possible transition phases, any moves involving these defensemen could significantly impact the NHL landscape.

What to expect from Walker and the Seahawks in tonight’s divisional matchup

Also read

The Seattle Seahawks are on the road tonight for a crucial NFC West showdown against the Arizona Cardinals, and all eyes are on running back Kenneth Walker III. As the Seahawks look to improve to 3–1, Walker is expected to play a central role in the offensive game plan. Known for his breakaway speed and ability to bounce off tackles, the third-year back is poised to challenge an Arizona defense that’s struggled to contain explosive runners. With no injury concerns heading into Week 4, Walker will be counted on to set the tone early and help Seattle control the tempo in one of the most tightly contested divisions in football.Yes, Kenneth Walker III is active and will start in tonight’s Thursday Night Football matchup against the Arizona Cardinals. Head coach Mike Macdonald confirmed earlier this week that Walker is “fully healthy and ready to go,” putting any speculation to rest. Walker has been a key figure in Seattle’s offense this season, offering dual-threat value as a rusher and receiver. The Cardinals will need to stay disciplined in gap control, as any missed assignment could lead to a big gain from one of the league’s most dangerous open-field runners.The Seahawks enter the contest relatively healthy, but a few names remain on the watch list. Defensive lineman Leonard Williams is listed as questionable with an elbow issue, while standout cornerback Devon Witherspoon is also questionable due to a knee injury. For the Cardinals, the backfield has been significantly impacted with James Conner officially ruled out for the season following foot surgery. Right tackle Paris Johnson Jr. is questionable with a knee injury, potentially weakening an already thin offensive line.Expect Seattle to lean heavily on Kenneth Walker III early, especially if they look to keep Arizona’s young quarterback and offense off the field. Designed outside zone runs, quick screens, and misdirection plays should highlight Walker’s burst and elusiveness. Arizona may try to load the box or bring safeties down to slow him, but Walker’s ability to slip out of contact and hit second gear makes him difficult to bottle up. If the Seahawks’ offensive line can control the trenches, look for Walker to post another standout performance under the lights.With both teams sitting at 2–1, this game could go a long way in shaping the NFC West standings — and Walker will be at the heart of Seattle’s effort to grab a critical divisional win.","The Seattle Seahawks take on the Arizona Cardinals on Thursday Night Football.

Stefon Diggs and Cardi B have found themselves in a huge controversy ever since the Grammy winner went public with the news of her pregnancy. While Stefon Diggs has been reportedly involved in a paternity dispute with another woman, the NFL star player has been accused of threatening to harm a man named Chris Blake Griffith, who has also accused him of sexual assault.A few hours ago, a man named Chris Blake Griffith, who works as a sports and culture marketing executive at W&L Entertainment Relations and Management, has accused Stefon Diggs of trying to “unalive” him.In an interview with Tasha K, Chris Blake Griffith said, “He attempted to have me unalive because of him making a sexual pass at me. It wasnt the sexual pass that frustrated me, what frustrated me the most was he tried to unalive me after it…”Chris Blake Griffith then went on to detail how Stefon Diggs allegedly drugged him and took out his pen*s in front of him, in an attempt to sexually assault him.Chris Blake Griffith has also accused Stefon Diggs of “licking his ears”, possibly in an attempt to get close to him.While such details are new, Chris Blake Griffith had filed a lawsuit against Stefon Diggs’ younger brother, Darez Diggs of allegedly “attacking” him in an elevator, in order to reportedly “silence” him, in October 2024.Chris Blake Griffith had also previously accused Stefon Diggs of sexual assault through a Facebook comment but has not filed any legal complaints against him.The new interview has also gone viral because Cardi B’s rival, former CIty Girl JT, reshared Chris Blake Griffith’s interview with Tasha K.As soon as former City Girl JT reshared Chris Blake Griffith’s interview, Cardi B wrote a post that said, “Chris lied because he was stealing and got caught.. there’s receipts for that.

Green Bay Packers star Josh Jacobs limited to 30 rushing yards despite full workload in Week 3

Dallas Cowboys recent struggles against the run may give Josh Jacobs an opportunity to shine

All week, Josh Jacobs' ankle has been the center of attention, leaving Green Bay Packers fans feeling uneasy. Despite having limited practice reps, the star running back still took on his full workload in Week 3 against the Cleveland Browns, but his performance left some doubts. With Week 4 against the Dallas Cowboys coming up, the big question is: can Jacobs power the Packers' offense or will he struggle with that nagging ankle issue?On Wednesday, September 24, 2025, Josh Jacobs was marked as limited in practice because of an ankle injury. This limitation mirrors what happened last week, when Jacobs also had restricted practice reps but didn’t get a game designation and managed to play his full load in Week 3.The Week 4 injury report lists Jacobs among 14 players, but he’s been pushing through some minor issues.According to Tom Christ, a physical therapist and injury analyst, he shared on X that the limited practices all week indicate that the ankle injury is mild. Running backs generally experience only an 8% reduction in fantasy points, which isn't enough to sway starting lineups.For the last few weeks, Jacobs has been dealing with an ankle issue, which first appeared on the injury report leading up to Week 3.According to the Packers' injury report from September 17, 2025, Jacobs was noted for his ankle trouble while preparing for the game against the Cleveland Browns. There’s no specific incident cited as the source, but it has been a factor in his limited practice participation.In a YouTube video uploaded on September 19, 2025, Jacobs said, ""It's going to be a battle,"" when talking about the challenges ahead, but he didn't specifically mention the injury.In Week 3, the Packers suffered a surprising defeat against the Cleveland Browns due to a last-minute field goal following a blocked attempt by Green Bay. Even with limited practice time, Jacobs maintained his usual performance, tallying 16 carries for 30 yards against a formidable Browns rush defense that had previously contained both Derrick Henry and Chase Brown.His performance was rated as the 30th-best running back in PFSN’s RBi metric for the week, earning a grade of 67.44, which is a D+. Analyst Daire Carragher shared on X that Jacobs has averaged under 3.6 yards per carry in each of the first three games, a feat he only achieved three times throughout the entire last season. Moreover, 177 out of Jacobs' 180 rushing yards this season have been gained after contact.Since wide receiver Jayden Reed is out for a long stretch, Jacobs had a 36% target share in Week 3, which is his highest since 2021.Jacobs is likely to keep his workhorse position in Week 4 against the Cowboys, just like he managed the previous week's challenges without missing any game time. This matchup could be in Jacobs' favor since the Cowboys have had a tough time against the Bears' running game lately.Analyst Murden shared on X that Jacobs' rushing yards might fall below 79.5 because of the injury and going up against a top-tier defense, but that was regarding Week 3. There hasn't been a final game status released yet, but reports suggest there are no significant worries about his availability. The Packers are regrouping after their loss in Week 3, which has made the NFC North competitive with the Vikings, Lions, and Bears all improving their records.Also Read: Richard Sherman wins deferred prosecution in Washington DUI case avoids trial with five year program Jacobs' effectiveness is crucial for balancing the offense, particularly with Reed out, to enhance the passing game.","Green Bay Packers running back Josh Jacobs was limited in practice on Wednesday.

Career trajectory and market value trends

Role at Al Hilal and contributions to the team

The 26-year-old Saudi Arabian right-back Hamad Al-Yami has a market value of €300,000 on his transfer until September 2025 with Al Hilal. This valuation makes him one of the more reasonably priced players in the Saudi Pro League and indicates that, while he is a significant signing, he is not the marquee player many at Al-Hilal expected him to be, but rather a squad rotation option. He may not be renowned for his market value, but his consistent performances and versatility make him a man of value in all of his teams.Al-Yami is contracted to Al Hilal until 30th June 2025 with an estimated gross salary of €100,000 for the 2025–2026 season. That works out to roughly €1,923 a week, not including any performance-based bonuses. His salary pales in comparison to some of his more high-profile teammates, like Kalidou Koulibaly, with an annual salary of €34.7 million. To underline the quality of the talented individuals they paid for, Al Hilal's total salary bill for the 2025–2026 season is €193,130,000.Also Read: Top Domestic Pro League Players: Salem Al-Dawsari, Al Hilal, Firas Al-Buraikan, Al Ahli, more Al-Yami began his career at Al-Qadsiah. He made 67 appearances and scored 6 goals between 2018 and 2021. After joining Al Hilal in 2021, he has made a total of 46 appearances, despite a loan spell at Al Shabab during the 2023–2024 season. His market value stabilized at €300,000 in May 2025, and he has emerged as one of the top right-backs in the Saudi Pro League.Al-Yami mainly features as a backup right-back at Al Hilal and adds squad depth. His ability to play many defensive positions is immensely valuable during rotations and due to injuries. Even though he doesn't start every match, his professionalism and his versatility always benefit the team.Al-Yami's future at Al Hilal is in doubt following his contract with the club expiring in June 2025. His low wage and even lower market value likely indicate he will be looking for another club, either domestically or internationally. His experience and versatility make him a player who could be valuable to a number of potential suitors.","Saudi Arabian right-back Hamad Al-Yami has a market value of €300,000 on his transfer until September 2025 with Al Hilal.

“Having met Ronaldo on the pitch previously, both in Italy and England, it remains an honourable challenge to go head-to-head with one of the all-time greats,”

In Roshn Saudi League's latest Captain’s Column, William Troost-Ekong described the experience as both a test and a privilege, recalling his past battles with Ronaldo in Italy and England while embracing the challenge in Saudi Arabia When Troost-Ekong, Nigeria and Al Kholood captain, walked into Riyadh’s Al Awwal Park in Matchweek 2 of the Roshn Saudi League, it wasn’t just another fixture.

Putting Health First After Major Surgery

Tiger Woods Ruptures Achilles - Career Over? Doctor Explains

Turning Down Captaincy to Focus on Golf Governance



A Temporary Step Back in the Spotlight, Not Retirement



Missing at the Ryder Cup at the nearly perfect Bethpage Black Golf Course in Farmingdale, New York, one stylish absence was Tiger Woods. This 15-time major champion has always defined golf in America, and this is the year he will not be competing. Here's a deep study on the reasons behind Woods not being on the U.S. team.Primarily due to health concerns, Tiger Woods was absent. In March 2025, he underwent surgery after rupturing his left Achilles tendon-a terribly serious injury that kept him out of competitive golf for a number of months. Whilst he has been recovering gradually, there was limited play and that included a handful of TGL matches-a technological golf league he co-founded along with Rory McIlroy-anyway; those must be some serious recuperation exercises. His last PGA Tour exhibition was at the Open Championship in 2024, having missed the cut therein; it is a glaring indication that Tiger is not ready just yet to face the Ryder Cup intensity.The interesting thing here is that Woods was once considered for the captaincy of the American Ryder Cup team. However, he turned down the post, wishing to concentrate instead on his off-course commitments. Presently, Woods sits on two boards: the PGA Tour Policy Board and the PGA Tour Enterprises Board of Directors.Both are time-intense appointments and can shape future directions in professional golf. Some sources feel that Woods' choice does not shut down captaincy opportunities in the future, thereby keeping fans' hopes for Woods’ Ryder Cup captaincy alive.Without a doubt, Woods' stepping out of the 2025 Ryder Cup is far from a formal retirement from the game of golf. Analysts feel that by concentrating on his recovery and governance matters, he extends his impact in the game beyond the golf course. Fans will most probably witness the competitive comeback of Woods as soon as he sufficiently regains fitness, which might well take place this year or 2026 in a PGA event.The absence of Woods in the Ryder Cup continues to be the shadow of his great legacy. Record-breaking majors and Ryder Cup moments of all time still cannot have a shadow cast on him. Now the focus is on health and administrative duties, taking his time to come back on his own terms and inspire yet another generation of golfers.Woods misses the 2025 Ryder Cup to pursue priorities of health while doing valuable off-course activities. Surely fans would have wanted to see him at Bethpage Black, but the player is still somehow carrying the torch for golf throughout and off the golf course.","Tiger Woods missed the 2025 Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black Golf Course in Farmingdale, New York.

The Arizona Cardinals face the Seattle Seahawks tonight in a crucial NFC West showdown at State Farm Stadium. With star running back James Conner sidelined for the season, rookie Trey Benson steps into a larger role as the team’s lead back.

With the Packers at 2-1 and the Cowboys struggling at 1-2, all eyes will be on Parsons to see if he can disrupt Dak Prescott and make a statement against his old team.Parsons has never been one to shy away from a challenge, and this game carries added intensity due to his history with the Dallas team.

Philadelphia Sixers guard Jared McCain faces setback with thumb injury ahead of season

Jared McCain’s injuries force Sixers to rethink backcourt rotation

According to ESPN's Tim Bontemps, Philadelphia 76ers ’ guard Jared McCain tore his right thumb's UCL during a workout on Thursday. The Sixers are now consulting with a doctor to decide how to treat the injury. McCain would probably be out for the start of the regular season because a tear of the UCL typically takes four to six weeks of rehabbing. However, the length of McCain's downtime is yet to be determined until the team knows how badly he's hurt. Meanwhile, he hasn’t addressed the injury as of yet.Guard Jared McCain was one Philadelphia 76ers player that many were eager to see return to action as the season got underway. It seems that his NBA sophomore season may get off to a rough start given previous events. The Philadelphia 76ers revealed less than 24 hours after the Media Day that guard Jared McCain tore his right thumb's ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) during a practice on Thursday.His availability for the season's opening was called into question when the team made the announcement. Tim Bontemps of ESPN reported on X:“Philadelphia 76ers guard Jared McCain suffered a UCL tear in his right thumb during a workout today, sources told ESPN.He and the team are working with specialists to decide how they will proceed, sources said. Philadelphia is set to hold media day tomorrow.…”In a press release, the Sixers formally announced the news as well. McCain has just been sidelined with a new injury. This happened shortly after he returned to the field following a ruptured meniscus that ended his first season.McCain was anticipated to contribute significantly to Philadelphia's campaign, either starting in the backcourt with All-Star Tyrese Maxey or coming off the bench. Both All-Star wing Paul George and superstar centre Joel Embiid are already facing unclear injury situations for Philadelphia.Since undergoing surgery on his left knee this spring, Embiid has not yet provided any update on his condition. He has only participated in 19 games this season and hasn't played since February. In the midst of all of this, Philadelphia will begin training camp on Friday.McCain was chosen by the Sixers with the 16th overall choice in the previous year's draft, out of Duke. In the 23 games he participated in, he averaged 15.3 points. He also shot 38.3% from three and added 2.6 assists and 2.4 rebounds.His position on the veteran-heavy squad was initially unknown, but that soon altered as the roster suffered a slew of unlucky injuries . He was recovering from a meniscus tear in his left knee that had kept him out of action for the rest of the 2024-25 season.McCain's minutes will now be split between youngster VJ Edgecombe , veteran Kyle Lowry, and Quentin Grimes, assuming the restricted free agent eventually agrees to return to Philadelphia this season.On the other hand, the Sixers may start the season without Paul George, their star forward, in addition to McCain. This summer, George had an injury during a workout that required an arthroscopic treatment on his left knee. As the team starts training camp, it is anticipated that the veteran wing will undergo another evaluation.Also read: Paul George’s successful knee surgery poses new challenge for 76ers’ 2025 training camp","Philadelphia 76ers guard Jared McCain tore his right thumb's ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) during a practice on Thursday.

Analyst Bryan Hayes suggests Ovechkin's drive may diminish without the record chase, also pointing to his age of 40 as a potential factor. Despite doubts, Ovechkin's legacy as a goal-scoring icon remains secure, approaching the 900-goal milestone.

Bryan Hayes questions Alex Ovechkin’s drive after chasing history

Alex Ovechkin’s legacy is secure even as questions linger



Alexander Ovechkin, one of the greatest goal scorers in NHL history, made hockey history earlier this year when he finally surpassed Wayne Gretzky’s long-standing record. On April 6, 2025, the Washington Capitals captain buried his 895th career goal against Ilya Sorokin, sending shockwaves through the sport. For many, that milestone cemented Ovi’s place alongside Gretzky in hockey immortality. But now that the chase is over, some wonder if the fire that fueled his career might be fading.Sports analyst Bryan Hayes recently offered a blunt assessment of Alex Ovechkin’s future. Appearing on SC with Jay Onrait, Hayes suggested that the Capitals’ leader may no longer have the same motivation that drove him to history.“He’s not chasing Gretzky anymore. Okay, so that’s not like a carrot hanging in front of him, where he was obsessed and he was scoring goals like crazy, and everything broke the Capitals’ way,” Hayes said. “They had a brilliant season, right? First place in the East. They had an unbelievable year, but I don’t see that happening again.”Hayes even hinted that Ovechkin’s age—40 years old—could mean the NHL is seeing the twilight of his career. “I think this is probably it. I think he’s done in the NHL. He’s 40 years old.”Despite the doubts, Ovechkin continues to defy expectations. He has racked up 1,623 career points across nearly 1,500 games and still ranked among the league’s top wingers last season.He currently sits at 897 goals, just three shy of the elusive 900 mark, which would set yet another historic milestone.Also Read: Tage Thompson’s future in Buffalo under scrutiny as Sabres’ struggles raise doubts Even if Hayes’ prediction proves correct, Ovechkin’s relentless pursuit of Gretzky’s record showcased his unmatched determination and cemented a legacy that will never be forgotten.

New York Rangers rising star Gabe Perreault impresses, NHL role not yet locked

“I don’t think he needs to be a top-six player. It’s important that he gets minutes for his overall development,”

“Whether that takes place in New York or in Hartford is yet to be determined. We’re really encouraged by his game. He seems to get better with each game he plays.”

Preseason performance and Rangers’ top-six battle shape Perreault’s future

The New York Rangers’ young forward Gabe Perreault has been turning heads in the 2025 preseason, showcasing his skill and scoring ability. Despite his standout performances, head coach Mike Sullivan confirmed that Perreault’s NHL roster spot has not been finalized. While the 20-year-old prospect demonstrates clear NHL potential, the team is weighing whether he should start in New York or continue his development in Hartford, keeping fans eager for updates.Gabe Perreault, selected 23rd overall in the 2023 NHL Draft, has quickly made an impression during the early preseason games. Scoring in both of his first two outings, the 20-year-old forward has shown excellent game IQ, composure, and offensive instincts, traits that made him a standout in the US National Team Development Program (USNTDP) and at Boston College. Coach Mike Sullivan praised Perreault’s development but emphasized that his role in the Rangers’ lineup remains undecided.Sullivan said.Sullivan’s comments underline that while Perreault has NHL talent, the team is managing his progression carefully to ensure long-term success.Perreault’s preseason efforts have highlighted his readiness, but the Rangers’ current top-six forwards, including Vincent Trocheck, J.T. Miller, Artemi Panarin, Mika Zibanejad, Alexis Lafreniere, and Will Cuylle, make an immediate NHL roster spot competitive. His entry-level contract allows flexibility to alternate between the NHL and AHL, giving the Rangers the option to maximize his playing time without hindering development.Fans have already seen glimpses of Perreault’s talent. Beyond scoring, he has focused on increasing strength and improving skating to handle the physical pace of the NHL. Although starting in Hartford is a possibility, a midseason NHL call-up could allow him to contribute once he adjusts to the team’s speed and systems. With the regular season starting on October 7, every preseason game is critical for Perreault to make his case for consistent NHL action.Gabe Perreault remains one of the most closely watched prospects in the Rangers organization. While his NHL spot is not yet set, his early preseason performances and development trajectory indicate that he could soon become a key contributor to New York’s lineup.

I promised Luke I would only talk about the European team today. I'm going to stick to it”.

It's so easy to play into narratives this week and to get swept up in this whole rivalry and Ryder Cup and whatever it is. All I want to do is go and try to put blue points on the board. I don't care who it's against”.

If I come up against Bryson at some point, I think that's great.

That's wonderful for the championship and wonderful for us, as well, in some ways”.

It has been a really cohesive group for the last three years. We all know what to expect. We all know what our roles are... that has us prepared to give it an excellent go this week”.

Poll Which aspect of Pakistan's game needs the most improvement? Batting Bowling Fielding

Pakistan endured an embarrassing moment of chaos in the field during Bangladesh’s chase in their Asia Cup Super 4s clash on Thursday, when a straightforward run-out chance went begging in the fifth over.Shaheen Afridi had just started a new spell when Bangladesh were 23/1.Towhid Hridoy cut his strike to backward point. Saim Ayub dived brilliantly to stop the ball and threw it to the bowler’s end, where Saif Hassan was stranded almost halfway down the pitch. But no one was backing up. The fielder at the receiver's end then failed to collect cleanly, allowing Saif to run back to safety.Ayub, who had done all the hard work, looked visibly frustrated. Pakistan skipper Salman Agha too, was not impressed with the way his team let an easy wicket chance slip in this must win match.The grand escape, however, lasted just one delivery. On the very next ball, Hridoy went for a reckless hit across the line and mistimed it poorly. This time, Ayub made no mistake, as settled under it to complete the catch. Shaheen had his second wicket and finally something to smile about after the confusion of the previous delivery.Earlier in the match, Pakistan’s batting line-up faltered again under pressure. Bangladesh’s bowlers Taskin Ahmed (3/28), Mustafizur Rahman (1/33) and Rishad Hossain (2/18) controlled the innings as Pakistan ended at 135 for eight.Sahibzada Farhan (4) became Taskin’s 100th T20I wicket, while Saim Ayub’s run of low scores continued with his fourth duck. Fakhar Zaman (13), Hussain Talat (3) and Salman Ali Agha (19) also fell cheaply.But even that recovery was quickly overshadowed by the bizarre run-out blunder, as this moment summed up Pakistan’s struggles in this high-stakes encounter.","Pakistan spurned an easy run out chance against Bangladesh in the 5th over.

Xander Schauffele hails Bradley's leadership and motivation

“Keegan has done a nice job of bringing everyone in as a big family. There's a lot of warm and fuzzy feelings on that front.”

Team USA is fired up and rallied behind captain Keegan Bradley as the 2025 Ryder Cup plays out at Bethpage Black. Players, such as Xander Schauffele, have lauded Bradley's strategic moves and leadership style, which they say can clearly see the path to victory.Team USA's captain since July 2024 and for the Ryder Cup, Keegan Bradley, is wise beyond his years. He is the youngest American captain since Arnold Palmer in 1963 at age 39. Bradley told The Post that his bond with Bethpage Black, which he visited during college, played a big part in shaping the team's approach. Being so familiar with the course allows him to devise specific game plans for various players and should give Team USA an advantage.Bradley made several big calls, one of them being the six captain's picks he chose Collin Morikawa, Cameron Young, Sam Burns, and the like. His selections suggest a desire to build an aligned team rather than depend only on history. He didn't even choose himself as a player, bringing home his focus on captaincy and winning the tournament.Also Read: Xander Schauffele net worth in 2025: How the golf star built his multi-million dollar fortune One of the best in the sport, Xander Schauffele, who is also an automatic qualifier for the U.S.team, has been effusive in his praise for Bradley.

Marvin Harrison Jr.’s impact in crunch time



Rebuilding momentum for the Cardinals



Marvin Harrison Jr. experienced a rollercoaster night as the Arizona Cardinals hosted the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday Night Football. The second-year wide receiver struggled early with drops, including a costly miscue in the second quarter that led to a Seahawks interception. Despite the rough start, Harrison delivered a clutch 16-yard touchdown grab from Kyler Murray in the fourth quarter, giving the Cardinals a chance to fight back and showing flashes of the form that made him last year’s No. 4 overall pick.Marvin Harrison Jr.’s performance says what he can bring under pressure. The 23-year-old receiver, who had 10 receptions on 17 targets for 142 yards and a touchdown in the first three games of 2025, added six catches for 66 yards and a score on 10 targets against Seattle. His 16-yard touchdown came with just under six minutes remaining, cutting the Cardinals’ deficit to 20-13 and reigniting hope in State Farm Stadium. Harrison also made an 18-yard catch on the next drive, setting up a game-tying opportunity.“This was the moment he was looking for,” a source close to the team said. Harrison’s former Ohio State teammates remain confident in his ability to rebound, and Thursday’s performance could mark the turning point in his sophomore season.Though Arizona ultimately fell 23-20, Harrison’s late-game heroics offer a morale boost for a team sitting at 2-2. Head coach Jonathan Gannon has high expectations for the second-year star, viewing him as a potential top target in the offense. Harrison’s rookie season set a high bar with 62 catches, 885 yards, and eight touchdowns, but consistency has been the missing link in 2025. Thursday’s clutch plays against a strong Seattle squad, led by Sam Darnold’s 123 first-half yards, suggest he is finding his stride.Looking ahead, the Cardinals will aim to carry Harrison’s momentum into their next matchup against the Tennessee Titans on October 5. If he continues to capitalize on opportunities in critical moments, Harrison could prove to be the offensive spark Arizona needs for the rest of the season.
