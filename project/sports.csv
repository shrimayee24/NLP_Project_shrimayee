NEW DELHI: India etched their name in Central Asian football history on Monday, by securing a bronze medal in their maiden appearance at the CAFA Nations Cup.

Oman were reduced to ten men when Ali Al Busaidi was sent off in the 96th minute, but despite India’s late dominance, the match went to a penalty shootout.In the shootout, Lallianzuala Chhangte, Rahul Bheke, and Jithin MS held their nerves to score for India, while Anwar Ali’s effort was saved and Udanta fired wide. For Oman, only Thani Al Rushaidi and Muhsen Al Ghassani converted, with Harib Al Saadi and Ahmed Al Kaabi missing the target.

Aryna Sabalenka has been open about navigating personal tragedy while continuing to dominate the tennis world. Following the sudden passing of her ex-boyfriend, Konstantin Koltsov, in March 2024, the Belarusian star found support in a new relationship with Brazilian entrepreneur Georgios Frangulis. The two went public in spring 2024, and since then, he has become a familiar face courtside, cheering her on at major tournaments.Aryna Sabalenka admitted that her new relationship came during an incredibly difficult chapter in her life. She credited Georgios Frangulis with helping her focus on joy beyond the pressures of tennis.“There was a really tough period where I was really happy to have him by my side, always cheering me up, always making sure that we are doing some fun stuff,” Sabalenka told People. “But I make sure I kind of forget about tennis and focus on the good things and enjoy my life. Even when things are going wrong in my career. So yeah, he was my biggest support and yeah, really happy to have him by my side.”Their relationship became public when they were first pictured together in April 2024. Since then, Frangulis has been spotted regularly in her player’s box, including at her title run at the 2024 US Open.Born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil, to a Greek family originally from Thessaloniki, Frangulis pursued law at Fundação Armando Alvares Penteado but never became a lawyer. His passion was always in entrepreneurship. After graduating in 2014, he moved to the United States, first living in Miami and later in California.A spiritual person, Frangulis has spoken about how faith shaped his outlook. “I go to church a lot, talking to God does me good. I was influenced by both branches of the family. The spiritual side has always been important to me – as well as intuition,” he told Forbes Brazil.In 2016, Frangulis founded Oakberry, an açaí-based brand that has since expanded worldwide. Known for its bowls and smoothies, Oakberry now has hundreds of locations across more than 40 countries. By January 2024, Sabalenka herself became an ambassador for the brand, later launching her own signature bowl.“Most of the time I go for Oakberry bowl; I think it's healthy and a good thing to start your day,” Sabalenka said in an interview. “It has everything you [want]: protein, carbs, vitamins, fruit. It's like an energy bowl, so I feel ready to go after I have it.”Beyond business, Frangulis balances his entrepreneurial career with his passion for motorsports. He has raced in Porsche GT3 Cup Challenge events and the Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup, finding in racing both adrenaline and escape.Georgios Frangulis has a visible presence in Aryna Sabalenka’s careerWhile Oakberry has sponsored tennis tournaments before, Frangulis admitted the experience of sitting in Sabalenka’s box is far more intense. “The toughest part is being in the box. It’s one of the most stressful situations I’ve ever experienced,” he said.“I never say anything during matches. I try not to show too much emotion, because Aryna notices everything – what everyone is doing in the box. I just clap as loudly as I can and make sure she feels supported.”Also Read: Who is Naomi Osaka’s husband?

Tom Brady seeks peace amid emotional challenges of divorce

Tom Brady remains focused on fatherhood and personal growth

Tom Brady’s decision to sell his $150 million Miami mansion marked a major step in his life after parting ways with supermodel Gisele Bündchen. Once a dream home shared by the power couple, the estate became a constant reminder of their past, especially after Gisele moved in with her new partner, Joaquim Valente, and their newborn child.Sources close to the former NFL superstar revealed that Brady, now 47, found it increasingly difficult to live so close to his ex-wife. The two finalized their divorce in 2022 after a 13-year marriage, and while they maintained a respectful co-parenting relationship, the proximity of their homes complicated his ability to move forward emotionally.""Every time he looks out across the water,"" an insider told RadarOnline, ""he sees Gisele's refurbished home and perfect life with her martial arts hunk and their new baby, and it gets him down.""This emotional struggle appears to have driven Brady’s decision to downsize and relocate. His goal was clear: to establish a more private space where he could focus on fatherhood and his professional life as a Fox Sports analyst. The move wasn’t about leaving Miami altogether but about distancing himself from painful memories embedded in the lavish mansion’s walls.Brady’s public image remains composed, but those close to him say he has been privately struggling.He continues to co-parent three children – Benjamin and Vivian with Bündchen, and Jack with actress Bridget Moynahan.His focus on fatherhood is unwavering, and amid this personal transition, he posted a cryptic yet poignant quote on Instagram: ""I really think the secret to being loved is to love. And the secret to being interesting is to be interested. And the secret to having others find beauty in you is to find beauty in others.

The final drive with Walter Gretzky that meant more than the farewell ovation

Lessons from Walter Gretzky that shaped a hockey icon

Wayne Gretzky’s last NHL appearance on April 18, 1999, at Madison Square Garden is remembered as a celebration of the “Great One’s” extraordinary career. Yet, for Gretzky, the moment wasn’t only about the sold-out crowd, the ovations, or the history—it was about a quiet car ride with his father, Walter Gretzky.On the 25th anniversary of his retirement, Wayne Gretzky aka The Great One reflected on why he asked Walter to drive him to Madison Square Garden that night. “For my final game, I decided that since my dad drove me to the first game I ever went to, it would be great to drive my dad to my last game,” he told NHL.com.That ride, however, was far from ordinary. Gretzky admitted, “The ride was good, but it was kind of awful in the same sense because every three minutes, he kept hitting my leg and telling me that I could play one more year. I said, ‘No, dad, I’m done.’”While the NHL and fans worldwide treated the day as a fitting farewell to the greatest player in hockey history, Gretzky cherished that personal moment most. To him, it was the perfect full-circle memory, blending his first steps in hockey with the end of his iconic journey.Wayne Gretzky's father, Walter Gretzky was more than just a supportive parent—he was the guiding force behind Wayne’s rise.When officials tried to block young Wayne from moving to Toronto in 1974, Walter stood firm, saying, “No, they can't tell me where to send my own boy… If he will be happy elsewhere, we decide between the family.”Also read: What is the Wayne Gretzky Rule and how it changed the modern NHL forever Walter’s philosophy of family first left a lifelong mark on Wayne, who carried those values into his career and personal life.

Walter taught Wayne, Keith, Brent, Glen, and their friends hockey on a rink he made in the backyard of the family home, nicknamed the ""Wally Coliseum"".After his retirement in 1999, Wayne Gretzky was immediately inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, making him the most recent player to have the waiting period waived. The NHL retired his jersey number 99 league-wide. Gretzky was one of six players voted to the International Ice Hockey Federation's (IIHF) Centennial All-Star Team.The Great One's career achievements include a record nine Hart Trophies as the most valuable player in the NHL. Between 1981 and 1994, he won the Art Ross Trophy, presented to the NHL's season points leader, 10 times.Wayne Gretzky had a major influence on the style of play of the Edmonton Oilers and the NHL as a whole, helping to inspire a more team-based strategy. Using this approach, the Oilers, led by Wayne Gretzky, became the highest-scoring team in NHL history.","Wayne Gretzky's father, Walter, was the guiding force behind Wayne's rise.

""There's a man who gave so much to this city and this organization,""

“He loved the Colts, the horseshoe, and was the kind of owner every player dreams of playing for,”

When the Colts clinched a stupendous win during Sunday’s season opener over Miami, Coach Shane Steichen breathed a sigh of despair. It’s as contradictory as it sounds. The moment Daniel Jones ran for two touchdowns and threw for another one, the Colts dodged the most ruthless record of an 11-winless opening game streak. Fans burst into celebration, the locker room beamed with pride, a slew of franchise legends, and someone from the sky chuckled a little as if he knew what his boys could do. Late Jim Irsay, who died in May, had watched down on the team from afar, as the coach believed. Moreover, Irsay’s daughter had something special to add to mark the team’s first win without his dad.Steichen said of Irsay in a heartwarming mid-game speech.quarterback Peyton Manning added to the overflowing emotion after the legend was inducted into the Ring of Honor, and the Irsay daughters couldn’t help but join.

Jim has left so many unfinished wishes and works that the next generation automatically took the chair and let the legacy flow. Irsay has been a fixture on and off the field.Payton Manning rightly articulated.Jim was and is deeply loved across Indianapolis. His death brought his broad philanthropic gestures and thoughts to the surface, making him more of an idol to future generations. Starting from kicking the stigma campaign that contributed significantly to the mental health industry to paying for the funerals of the people who lost their loved ones, the former Colts owner carved a path that’s beyond football. That’s not just it. Jim also left a wish to donate an enormous amount of money to every Colts staff member as a token of his last thank you!

NEW DELHI: Choreographer Dhanashree Verma’s separation from Indian cricketer Yuzvendra Chahal has remained one of the most talked-about controversies of the year.

Jordon Hudson fuels speculation with mysterious game-day accessory



Jordon Hudson continues to craft her own narrative



When Jordon Hudson showed up at Bill Belichick’s latest UNC game, she wasn’t just cheering from the stands—she appeared to be making a statement. The 24-year-old former cheerleader, often in the spotlight for her bold fashion choices and subtle digs at critics, carried a clear purse that had everyone talking. Inside were crumpled papers, highlighted notes, and even what looked like contracts—items too deliberate to be accidental.Hudson has been a consistent presence during Belichick’s early days at the University of North Carolina, but it’s her bag, not her outfits, that’s now fueling conversation. At the Tar Heels’ season opener against TCU, she sported a snakeskin ensemble and a clear bag filled only with folded papers. A week later, against UNC-Charlotte, she carried the same purse—but again, no wallet, phone, or lip gloss, just layers of paper with certain words highlighted.Among the visible notes were fragments like “anything with any,” and references to “moral rights” and “fictional,” sparking guesses that Hudson was addressing rumors or disputes in her own cryptic way. A neon-yellow highlighter sat inside the purse as well, making the setup seem even more intentional.While the meaning behind the items remains unclear, the display seemed too curated to dismiss as coincidence.For Hudson, these choices aren’t entirely surprising. She has often used fashion, emojis, and even Taylor Swift lyrics to communicate without saying much at all. Her social media is filled with snakeskin looks, sly captions, and music references that many interpret as subtle messages aimed at detractors. Earlier this year, she teased a “statement coming soon” following backlash over an interview moment, only to later change the caption to “Read it closer this time. ”Whether her purse was a playful metaphor, a quiet clapback, or something more personal, it certainly captured attention. And while Belichick celebrated his first win with UNC in a 20-3 victory over Charlotte, Hudson’s game-day look may have been the real headline. As the Tar Heels prepare to face Richmond, fans won’t just be watching the field—they’ll be keeping an eye on Hudson’s next move.Also Read: Who is JJ McCarthy’s girlfriend Katya Kuropas?

When people think of the Curry family, basketball immediately comes to mind. Yet behind the success of Stephen Curry, Seth Curry, and Sydel Curry, stands Sonya Curry, a woman whose influence stretches far beyond the court. The proud mother and author reflected on the essentials in her life, opening up about what she holds closest to her heart and the lessons she would pass down to her younger self.Introducing herself with a playful warmth during her appearance at TV One TV last year, Sonya Curry said, “Hi my name is Sonya Curry and I am the mother of three children, eight grandchildren and I call them my picks of the litter. I am an entrepreneur, founder of Christian Montessori School in Huntersville, North Carolina. I am now recently and so proud of this an author, the name of my book is Fierce Love: A Memoir of Family, Faith and Purpose. Oh, and by the way, I’m the mother of Stephen Curry, Seth Curry and Sydel Curry.”When asked about things she cannot imagine life without, her answer was firm. “I don’t think I could do without my faith in my Bible and the word. Because times when I have not been reading or feeding my spirit, I just feel me going south all the time.So I really need to have that time in my life.”She added that her family sits right beside her faith as a non-negotiable. “What I cannot absolutely do without is my children, my family, children and grandchildren.”Sonya Curry’s reflection also carried advice shaped by her own early experiences as a young mother. “I’d probably tell young Sonya slow down a little bit. You know I had my kids at 21, a little earlier than what I would have liked. Sometimes I look back and I’m like, did I provide enough nurturing for them? Or was I so busy just trying to make sure that nothing messed up, that I didn’t mess them up?”She admitted that her constant focus on keeping things together sometimes left her questioning if she had paused enough to breathe. Her advice was simple yet came from the years of experience as a mother of three kids, “I would say just breathe and slow down a little bit.”Sonya is the mother of Sydel Curry and basketball stars Stephen Curry and Seth Curry.Also Read: Magic Johnson and wife Cookie Johnson share their victorious Sunday as multi-sport fans attending multiple big games","Sonya Curry is the mother of Sydel Curry and basketball stars Stephen Curry and Seth Curry.

Let's get into what happened at the show tonight right away!The show starts with a shot of Becky Lynch and Seth Rollins entering the venue. Lynch looks a little scared of the cameras pointing towards her, and Rollins tries his best to shield her as they make their way in. Next, we see The Usos, who are making a grand entrance together for the first time in a while. Echoes of YEET fill the arena as Jey, followed by Jimmy, enters the ring to greet the audience.Jey begins by saying that Rollins and the Bronies, the Bronses, the Brusos, whatever the fans wanted to call ‘em, have screwed up. Of course, this is when the Bron 'n Bron Connection makes their way in. The Usos are the crowd favorite, while the heels play their part perfectly. We learn that a tag team match between the four of them has been scheduled for Wrestlepalooza.While the back and forth is happening, LA Knight attacks The Vision crew out of nowhere. Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed overwhelm him soon, but The Usos come to his rescue. Things are not rainbows and sunshine between the Usos and Knight, but the three end the segment by sending the heels packing. Knight then goes to Adam Pearce backstage, when fans see Byron Saxton rolling up to do an interview. Knight asks Pearce for a match with one of the Brons, but if he can't get that, he will take anyone. Looks like we have an opponent for him.The first fight of the night was between AJ Styles and El Grande Americano, who was responsible for Styles losing his Intercontinental Championship title. The bell rings and the match starts right away, as Styles launches Americano through the ropes with a dropkick. The match moves from inside the ring to the outside and back inside in minutes, as the two men continue to gain control over the other.The match has been ongoing for a while when El Grande Americano II makes his way to the stage to run interference. After a near fall for Styles, he tries to make a comeback, but it's difficult with two opponents. Just then Dragon Lee makes his entrance to even the playing field. Styles takes advantage of that and hits Americano with a Styles Clash to take the win.Styles and Lee hug after the win and lead the show to the next segment. Backstage, we see Adam Pearce talking to IYO SKY, informing her that the contract signing between her and Stephanie Vaquer has been postponed because Vaquer couldn't make it tonight, but the show is still on. Next, we see Sky talking to Nikki Bella when the Kabuki Warriors roll in.Of course, Asuka tells Nikki to leave who doesn't like the way she is being treated. Bella tells Asuka that she doesn’t have to like her but she has to respect her. In turn, Asuka tells her she’ll beat the respect into her tonight and leaves. Looks like we got another match in our hands. Kairi Sane, as usual, looks awkward, trying to smooth things over, but is called off by Asuka soon enough.Last week, Adam Pearce gave in to the demands of Lyra Valkyria, and now we have an official match between her and one of the Judgment Day members - and it looks like it's going to be Raquel Rodriguez. The latter has an advantage over Valkyria with her towering physique, which she takes full advantage of.They both are powerhouse performers, and try to gain an advantage over the other. From Rodriguez throwing Valkyria into the turnbuckles to the latter hitting Rodriguez with a reverse chinlock - the fight goes on for a while, as both women have their advantages and disadvantages over one another. Finally, with a one-armed powerbomb, Rodriguez manages to clinch the win against Valkyria.Backstage, we see Penta with the War Raiders, before he walks away with Adam Pearce. He tells Pearce that he wants a title match, when Rusev walks in, complaining that things are not going according to what they had planned. Penta gets in his face and Rusev is not one to back down either. Instead, the RAW GM books Rusev and Penta for a first-time-ever match tonight.In the next segment, we see AJ Styles chatting with Dragon Lee, grateful for his help tonight. Elsewhere, Big Jim is looking for his big brother and finally rings him near the exit. He tells Jey they should help LA Knight in his fight tonight, but Jey isn't interested in that. Jimmy says he is starting to sound less like himself and more like Reigns, and Jey says maybe that's not a bad thing.Finally, the much-awaited segment arrives - as AJ Lee makes her way into the ring wearing Becky Lynch's International Championship belt. She apologizes for keeping everyone waiting, and fans give her a loud ""welcome back!"" She talks to the audience for a while and reminds everyone who she is and what she has been doing for the last 10 years. She talks about her journey through mental health, and the time she took to heal herself. She then brings up Lynch, and says in another world they could have been friends as they have a lot in common.Lynch of course, makes her way in at that moment and says they have nothing in common - she’s the greatest female wrestler of all time. She says Lee should give her the title belt back and gets mad when AJ recounts all that she has done while wearing the belt so far. She then lays the belt down and asks Lynch to come and get it herself, but the latter hesitates.Seth Rollins comes in next and tells AJ to give the title back to Becky so that they can all leave. But Lee says she has a better idea - Lynch could come inside the ring and take back her title belt, or she will give it to her if they agree to a tag team match - AJ Lee and CM Punk vs. Becky Lynch and Seth Rollins. Rollins says she doesn't make the rules here, but before he can grab the belt, she blocks him.CM Punk, of course, makes his way into the stage then and cold shoulders Lynch. He gets in the ring and fireman’s carry Rollins, but he gets away and joins Lynch on the ramp. He picks up the mic he had dropped while trying to get away and accepts the mixed tag match for Wrestlepalooza. AJ Lee, as promised, gives Lynch her title back by throwing it out of the ring towards her, and then hugs Punk with a massive grin on her face.Both Penta and Rusev get in position as soon as the bell rings. Rusev runs at Penta and the latter retaliates with chops. Penta has a near fall after a clothesline from his opponent. He then takes down Rusev with a headscissors and then hits a backstabber, but the latter kicks out immediately. The fight continues, as Rusev slams Penta’s head onto the announce desk, and then when he runs at him again, Penta moves out the way, making Rusev crash into the steel steps.The New Day alongside Grayson Walker make their way in, who are no doubt pissed off for losing against Penta and the War Raiders. They try to run interference, but Penta hits them with a dive. Penta then dives off the top-rope, but gets hit with a machka kick from Rusev on the way down, who covers him for a win.Backstage, Jimmy Uso meets with LA Knight, and asks him if what happened with Jey tonight was an accident. Knight says it wasn't in his hands, to which Big Jim says that they should keep aside their beef and focus on the Bron's. But Knight doesn't want his help - Jey cost him his last world title match, while Jimmy cost him the match when he faced Roman Reigns. So it's better that they don't try to help him anymore.Nikki Bella and Asuka lock up once the bell rings. Bella hits with a dropkick, Asuka counters with a knee to the nose. Nikki then hits Asuka with one of her huge elbows, followed by a spinebuster, and covers for two counts. Nikki goes for another hit, but Asuka uses Kairi Sane as a human shield, and this could be the straw that broke the camel's back in the long run.Bella pulls Kairi aside, which gives the Empress time to blast her with a flash kick. Asuka goes for a huge German suplex, heads up to the top for a missile dropkick, but Bella dodges it. She then charges in with a lariat, followed by springboard roundhouse to cover, but Asuka kicks out before the three count. Finally, it is yet another Asuka Lock that gives the Empress the win.Backstage, we see The Judgment Day celebrating Raquel Rodriguez's win over Lyra Valkyria tonight when Dominik Mysterio rolls in. Finn Balor asks him where he had been, and also warns him against El Grande Americano, but Dom isn't concerned about that. Mysterio says it’s a lucha thing and they wouldn’t understand, and says it’s their fault for getting ejected, before leaving.In another setting, Nikki Bella faces Asuka once more for the night, where the latter gloats about her win, asking if she is ready for Round 2. Rhea Ripley shows up, getting in Asuka's face, and asks if they’ve got a problem. Asuka says yes - the two of them. The Japanese then says she’s the top woman in WWE when Ripley points out that it is IYO SKY who has a title match next. Asuka storms off as Kairi Sane is left standing awkwardly, before a growl from the former makes her move again.Both LA Knight and Bronson Reed look fired up for the last match up of the night. Knight backs Reed into the corner with punches, and though the latter tries to circle back, Knight blocks him and keeps raining punches. Reed hits his opponent with a hammer whip, throwing Knight out of the ring, where of course, Bron Breakker is waitingKnight gets to the top-rope and hits a flying elbow for a close two-count. Breakker, inevitably, gets involved again, leading to a Jagged Edge from Reed for the pin and win.Of course, now it's time for a post-match beatdown of Knight by the Bron 'n Bron Connection. Jimmy Uso runs into the ring attempting to make the save, but gets hit with a spear. The Vision duo are relentless, and keep hitting Knight and Jimmy when Jey Uso finally shows up. He hits Breakker and Reed, but the two overwhelm him soon enough. Knight though, now recovered after a little break, uses a steel chair to finally run off Reed and Breakker.As The Vision walks off the stage, fans see Knight asking Jimmy Uso if they’re good now, who says they are. But then the very next moment, Jey hits Knight with a spear to end the show.Also Read: WWE SmackDown results and highlights (09/06/2025): John Cena’s final SmackDown, Brock Lesnar appears, AJ Lee returns, and More","This edition of Monday Night RAW comes live from the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Caleb Williams' stats reveal high potential and mounting pressure as Chicago pins its future hopes on rookie quarterback,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/caleb-williams-stats-reveal-high-potential-and-mounting-pressure-as-chicago-pins-its-future-hopes-on-rookie-quarterback/articleshow/123777028.cms,"Caleb Williams stats (Image credits: IG/X)

Caleb Williams’ first game showed calm but needed spark

Season numbers reveal balance amid rising expectations

Career foundation strong yet demands more growth

Chicago now awaits growth beyond just numbers

Caleb Williams’ first NFL stat sheet with the Chicago Bears is more than just numbers — it is the portrait of a rookie quarterback stepping into immense expectations, balancing flashes of efficiency with the weight of carrying a franchise hungry for stability. His debut against the Vikings, his season totals, and his career-opening record each reveal a different layer of his journey, from composure under pressure to the unpolished edges that need sharpening.Caleb Williams faced the Minnesota Vikings in his first regular-season outing. He completed 63% of his passes for 147 yards, finishing the night with a 77.2 passer rating. No touchdowns and no interceptions meant he played safe, avoiding costly errors but also missing a chance to ignite Chicago’s offense. For a debut, it was measured, almost restrained, showing that Williams valued security over spectacle.Across the 2024 regular season, Williams’ stat line sharpened into focus: 3,541 yards, 20 touchdowns, and just 6 interceptions with a 62.5% completion rate. The efficiency and ball security stood out, proving his decision-making already mirrors that of more seasoned quarterbacks. Yet, critics pointed to missed explosive plays and a passer rating of 87.8 — respectable, but not the kind of elite mark that silences skeptics in Chicago.With only one season logged, Williams’ career stats mirror his rookie totals — and that alone is historic. Few quarterbacks in Bears history have opened their careers with over 3,500 yards and 20 touchdowns. Still, the pressure lingers. His numbers show a strong foundation, but they also underline the need for greater consistency in finishing drives and elevating his team against elite opponents.Numbers don’t capture the entire storm around Caleb Williams. For Bears fans, his debut season was less about cold percentages and more about glimpses of leadership, resilience, and untapped brilliance. His rookie year didn’t end with a playoff push, but the stats etched his promise into Chicago’s future. Now, the task is clear: transform solid numbers into defining wins.Also read : Will Caleb Williams play against the Minnesota Vikings tonight?

Security response leaves injured fan outraged and isolated

Injured supporter signals intent to pursue attorneys

A Houston Texans fan left battered and bloodied during a violent clash with Los Angeles Rams supporters at SoFi Stadium has signaled plans to pursue legal action, saying her injuries and the stadium’s handling of the situation demand accountability.

Spectators watched in horror as security rushed to intervene, but not before the damage was done and the footage spread across social media.In a video recorded immediately after the incident, the fan criticized stadium officials for leaving her alone. “Security just took my boyfriend inside to retrieve my property. They left me out here with zero f***ing anybody, no phone, no nothing,” she said, still visibly bleeding.Her account has sparked debate over whether stadium security acted swiftly and responsibly during the melee.The pivotal moment came when she declared that her ordeal would not end at the gates. “I just want this documented for the attorneys going forward,” she said, signaling a potential lawsuit.

Poll Do you think Chris Gayle was treated fairly during his time at Punjab Kings? Yes, he deserved better No, he was treated appropriately Not sure It depends on the circumstances

NEW DELHI: West Indies legend Chris Gayle, one of the most iconic figures in the history of the Indian Premier League ( IPL ), has opened up about the most difficult phase of his career, revealing that his stint with Punjab Kings (formerly Kings XI Punjab) left him disillusioned and pushed him towards depression.Speaking on a podcast with Shubhankar Mishra, Gayle recalled how he felt “disrespected” during his time with the franchise between 2018 and 2021, despite being one of the biggest stars to ever play the tournament.“My IPL ended prematurely with Punjab. I was disrespected at Kings XI. I felt I wasn’t treated properly as a senior who had done so much for the league and brought value. They treated me like a kid. For the first time in my life, I felt like getting into depression,” Gayle revealed.During his tenure at Punjab, Gayle played 41 matches, scoring 1,304 runs at an average of 40.75 and a strike rate of 148.65, including one century and ten fifties. Yet the memories remain bitter.He recalled breaking down during a conversation with then-head coach Anil Kumble. “I actually broke down talking to Anil because I was really hurt.I cried and told him I was disappointed with him and with the way the franchise was run,” Gayle said.The “Universe Boss” also recounted how then-captain KL Rahul tried to convince him to stay. “KL Rahul even called me saying, ‘Chris, stay, you’ll play the next game.’ But I just said, ‘I wish you all the best,’ packed my bag, and walked out,” Gayle recalled.Gayle’s decision came during the 2021 season, played under strict bio-bubble restrictions. He admitted that the mental toll was too heavy. “At that stage, money meant nothing. Your mental health is more important. I felt like I was destroying myself inside, and I just had to walk away,” he said.Gayle ended his IPL career with 4,965 runs in 142 matches, including the highest individual score in the league’s history — 175*. While his exploits with Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bengaluru made him a T20 legend, his exit from Punjab Kings left him with scars.“That was the first time I ever felt depression. I was destroyed inside,” Gayle concluded, giving fans a rare glimpse into the emotional struggles behind his larger-than-life persona.","West Indies legend Chris Gayle has opened up about the most difficult phase of his career.

Workload management? Jasprit Bumrah proves he's an outlier

Excerpts...

There has been a fair amount of criticism of Bumrah playing only three out of five Tests in England during the recent series due to

workload management

. Why was he available for only such a limited time in the series? As someone who has been involved with his treatment for a long time, could you explain why some fast bowlers are being subjected to workload management all of a sudden?

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!

Having known Bumrah for a while now, do you think that he’s the sort of athlete who would pick and choose games willingly?

In comparison, his fellow India pacer

Mohammed Siraj

played all five Tests and bowled long, tiring spells in the same series. Is it fair to say that the term workload management is exaggerated in that case?

Poll Do you think workload management is crucial for fast bowlers? Yes, it's essential for long-term health No, they should play every match It depends on the player's condition Not sure

Workload management is a term that itself has come under fire from a lot of former cricketers. How important is this concept in today’s cricket, when you have a busy season every year in all three formats?

There is speculation that Bumrah may not play Test cricket after this WTC cycle. How long do you think he can last in the red-ball format?

India’s top sports surgeon Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala, who has closely monitored Jasprit Bumrah , has an explanation for why the 31-year-old star pacer participated in only three out of five Tests in England this summer to manage his workload. Bumrah, who underwent back surgery in March 2023 in New Zealand, has been under Pardiwala’s care for the past three years.In an interview with, Pardiwala detailed the complexities of fast bowling on the human body.Look, nature never intended for us, humans, to be fast bowlers, and our anatomy did not evolve such that we could perform this biomechanically challenging action repetitively. During fast bowling, the delivery stride involves back-foot strike, followed by front-foot strike, and ball release. Significant hip rotation and shoulder counter-rotation occur between back-foot strike and front-foot strike. Simultaneously, the lower body suddenly brakes to allow the upper body and arm to pivot and use the kinetic energy to deliver the ball. Additionally, on front-foot strike, considerable ground reaction forces are transmitted along the leg to the lower back. The brunt of all these excessive rotational and compressive forces is borne by small bones in the back (lumbar vertebrae) that were never meant to endure such stresses.This is even more pronounced in fast bowlers who adopt a mixed action (front-on foot and shoulder orientation at back-foot contact, followed immediately thereafter by realignment of the shoulder to a side-on profile), and this makes them more prone to stress fractures of the lumbar vertebrae.Lumbar vertebrae stress fractures in fast bowlers are recognised as the worst injuries to endure since they take a long time to heal and often run an unpredictable course. These are primarily repetitive overuse injuries, and there is a consensus today that preventing them is much better than curing them. This is even more critical if a fast bowler has already undergone surgery to fix these injuries in the immediate past. There are two means of prevention: control the frequency of bowling and allow adequate recovery time between spells and matches (workload management), or decrease biomechanical loads by altering the bowling action. The latter is not always possible or desirable in a fast bowler who is effective because of his action, and hence workload management is the only effective tool to ensure longevity in cricket for certain fast bowlers.No athlete wants to miss games, and certainly not someone as competitive as Bumrah. However, sometimes, a cautious approach may be prudent. An effective elite fast bowler is a rare asset, and protecting this talent for long-term gains is in the best interest of the team and the sport.Although workload management is important in all fast bowlers, not all fast bowlers have the same predispositions for injuries. Age, bowling action, and a history of prior lumbar vertebral stress fractures or surgery dictate the level of risk. This, in turn, decides the extent of protection. Mohammed Siraj has a classical fast bowling action which is side-on, and this has a lesser risk for a lumbar vertebral stress fracture.Prevention is always better than cure. As far as repetitive stress and overuse injuries in fast bowlers are concerned, workload management is the most scientific and effective tool we have for this as of now. We could opt to flog an athlete for short-term gains or preserve an asset for long-term benefits. Which is the better option is a collective decision made by the player, coach, and the medical team. And it's not always an easy decision, since when you are on national duty, every match and every win is important.This speculation is unfounded, and with appropriate workload management and fitness maintenance, Bumrah can expect to play many years of successful red-ball cricket.","India’s top sports surgeon Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala has closely monitored Jasprit Bumrah.

World Champion D Gukesh's biggest defeat? How American GM Abhimanyu Mishra aced the battle of youngest chess icons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/world-champion-d-gukeshs-biggest-defeat-how-american-gm-abhimanyu-mishra-aced-the-battle-of-youngest-chess-icons/articleshow/123777304.cms,"GM Abhimanyu Mishra defeated world champion D Gukesh (Image credit: FIDE)

NEW DELHI: Since becoming the youngest-ever world chess champion at the age of 18 last year, Grandmaster (GM) Gukesh Dommaraju has been on the receiving end of countless potshots, not just from the past champions but also from those who have only managed to hold the title in their dreams so far.The latest to join that chorus was Uzbekistan No. 1 GM Nodirbek Abdusattorov, who stirred the pot ahead of the Grand Swiss with his “unpopular chess opinion”: “Gukesh will lose his title in the next match. Is that controversial?”Five-time world champion GM Viswanathan Anand was quick to defend the 19-year-old, brushing aside Abdusattorov’s jab with a smile: “Respect to these boys. They know how to make content. He is so innocent, no? Is that controversial? No, it’s good fun. That’s how the game is played these days.”But Samarkand had its own reality check in store.Gukesh, under no compulsion to play the Grand Swiss as reigning world champion, still threw himself into the mix to test his mettle against the elite, subsequently opening the run of games with two wins and two draws.However, Monday delivered the shocker: a fifth-round defeat to 16-year-old American prodigy GM Abhimanyu Mishra, arguably the most scathing blow yet of Gukesh’s reign as world champion.Mishra, born in New Jersey to Indian parents, had already carved his place in history as the youngest-ever to earn the GM title at 12 years and four months. With this win, he set another record, becoming the youngest to defeat a reigning world champion in classical chess, eclipsing Gata Kamsky’s 1992 mark at 18, when he beat Garry Kasparov.With Abhimanyu playing the whites, the game itself began innocuously enough as the king’s pawn opening steered into the Giuoco Pianissimo.The first major jolt came with Abhimanyu’s 12. dxe5, after which Gukesh invested 21 minutes before launching the fatal 12…g4 push.""He went with h5, and when I played d4, I saw this idea of going dxe5. He was still in preparation, and I wasn’t sure whether I should do it. But I decided, whether it’s Gukesh, the world champion, or anybody else, if I think a move is best, I’m going to play it. So I went for the dxe5 piece sacrifice,” Mishra explained after the game.""Instead of giving up the piece (pawn on e5), I was also considering ideas like Bh4, then if Black goes Qd7, I could play Nd4. Compared to the game, which also keeps an edge. So I was debating: should I go for exd6, which is basically all or nothing, or take the safer route with a pleasant position? In the end, I chose 13.exd6. I thought, let's have some fun today.""A couple of moves later, his pawn on c7, achieved through 14.dxc7, soon paralysed Black’s pieces.While the position swung dramatically, Mishra admitted to “panicking” after overestimating Gukesh’s counterplay. His 20. Nd4 handed the world champion a way back into the game.“He found this idea with 19...Kd7, which I think was practically nice. I sort of panicked... Maybe I overestimated it. Later, I considered b4, and that looked quite good; if he goes Kc8, I go a4, b5, and soon he probably has to resign. But instead, I went Kd4, and that was just a horrible decision. I spent around 10 minutes on it. Honestly, it’s inexplicable,” he further added.Having lost his early advantage, Mishra opened up on the middle-game: “This period was frustrating because I knew I’d blown my position. I was just trying to somehow keep up the pressure.""Abhimanyu slipped again with 32. Rff7, offering Gukesh a fresh chance to claw back. But after 36…Ne2+, Mishra’s precise rook play and the relentless march of his g-pawn from move 37 sealed the champion’s fate, forcing Gukesh to resign in a 61-move game that almost touched the six-hour mark.“Of course, I knew I was winning, but from there I just saw it till the absolute end. My rook was optimally placed, so there were no more tricks. He resigned,” Mishra recalled.ALSO READ: Historic chess victory! How Divya Deshmukh beat higher-ranked Africa No. 1 Bassem Amin at FIDE Grand Swiss For Gukesh, the loss is symbolic, with his aura of invincibility cracked further.For Mishra, it is another milestone of his short, storied chess career as he concluded, “This is going better than I could have possibly imagined. I’m gaining around 20 points already. If I keep up this form, I have a very real chance of winning the tournament. Throughout the game, I never felt like I was really inferior to these players. I think I’m at par with even the top of the top.”",Gukesh Dommaraju loses to 16-year-old American prodigy GM Abhimanyu Mishra.

Their relationship carried through his college days at Michigan, where Kuropas was a familiar face cheering from the stands.McCarthy has never shied away from expressing his admiration. On their fifth anniversary, he wrote, “1,825 days with the love of my life but a million moments that will be remembered and cherished for the rest of my life. I couldn’t be more grateful for who you are and everything you do! You make me the best version of myself and it has been a complete blessing to continually watch you grow into the amazing woman you are. I love you my queen!!!”Earlier this year, just weeks after helping Michigan capture a national title, McCarthy proposed to Kuropas in a beachside moment that the couple shared on Instagram.Their post, captioned “Me, You & Marley Forever & Ever✨🤍”, reflected not just their commitment to each other but also to their dog Marley, who has been a beloved part of their journey.The joy didn’t stop there. In May, the couple announced they were expecting their first child, a baby boy due in September. “The best surprises come when you least expect them. Our sweet baby boy is arriving in September and we couldn’t be happier🩵🍼”, they shared with followers.As McCarthy steps onto the NFL stage, he does so with more than football on his mind.

Pittsburgh Steelers veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers ’ former partners—Shailene Woodley, Olivia Munn , and Danica Patrick—have shared powerful excerpts from their past relationships, including phrases like “Depression would come,” “Dangerous to my psyche,” and “Emotionally abusive. ” Thanks to the podcast world, women have started expressing themselves beyond the fear of judgment. Let’s gauge through the emotions each of these women went through when they were in a relationship with the Ayahuasca Retreat lover, Aaron Rodgers.Shailene Woodley described her relationship with former Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers in an interview with Melissa Johnson ofMagazine.actress said she had lost herself completely. She said she understood what anxiety and depression truly were. Her stylist, Kris Zero, would try her level best to keep theactress occupied, but she would feel depressed again.“I haven’t shared much about my relationship with Aaron(Rodgers) because it always makes me cry. It was not right. But it was beautiful. I had a really awful, traumatic thing happen in early 2022.I felt like I lost my soul, my self, my happiness, my joy. I really understood depression and anxiety, and like, complete soul detachment.”She chose to remain in a toxic situation because she was empathizing with someone else.“Empathy kind of kept me in this loop of feeling everything for everyone. I knew I was depressed when I looked at a tree and felt nothing. That was the lowest low of my life.”Shailene Woodley’s stylist, Kris Zero, would wake her up with blasting music just to get her out of bed. “Sometimes I was so angry at her. But then we’d go surf, and for ten minutes that day, I thought life could be okay again.Then the depression would come back, and she’d out–We’re volunteering at the horse ranch! – and we’d find a random f*cking horse ranch and we’d clean up horse sh*t.We’d clean hooves and brush the horses, and for 20 minutes that day, I thought like could be okay again. And then depression came back, and she’d wake up the next morning and go–Let’s go on a hike and bring trash bags and clean up trash!”Melissa reported that after about six months, the depression started to fade.Olivia Munn, theactress, appeared on thepodcast, where she talked about a past relationship in which she felt trapped in a tumultuous family dynamic. She said that her therapist encouraged her to stay in the relationship that she wanted to get out of.“I had a therapist who I really loved, and I know that she cared about me, or at least I thought she did. I would constantly, from the very beginning, say–I don’t know about this, I don’t think this is the right(relationship), I want to get out. I gotta get out,” Munn said.Theactress said her therapist encouraged her to stay in that relationship. “She thought that my ‘picker’ was off, and she would look at it as: this person on paper looked great. And when there was couples therapy, they knew how to present the right way. Then the stories I would tell seemed unbelievable.From that experience, learning that I gotta go with my gut and I gotta be decisive with some things if it’s coming from a place where I want to survive, and I realize that I’m not happy, and that days and weeks and months go by of unhappiness and fear.I don’t know if there’s a word to describe what that relationship was like. It was without a doubt the hardest period of my life, being in that,” she said she felt “really trapped in a tumultuous family dynamic.”Munn further said that the relationship taught her to stand up for herself. “It taught me how to stand up and fight for myself, so that was great. I truly had no idea that I could be manipulated and hurt that way, that I wouldn’t just get out of something that was dangerous to my psyche.It’s not just the period that you’re with the person, but, if you’re lucky to get out, (it’s) the years of healing yourself afterwards,” Munn told Lewinsky.Danica Patrick, the former professional racing driver and model, appeared onpodcast, where she disclosed that she was in an emotionally abusive relationship with the 41-year-old quarterback, Aaron Rodgers.“The breakup with Aaron(Rodgers) in 2020—because it was sudden, it felt like it was my life. When you live with somebody, it’s your whole life—your dentist appointments, your hairdo, your clothes, your mailing address, everything. Because the nature of the relationship was emotionally abusive, it wore me down to nothing.Something that people could never imagine is that I would lack any confidence or belief in the simple things about who I am. Everything was torn to bits.He leaves a trail of blood. I don’t think I’m saying too much earth-shattering stuff; there’s been enough out there.But it gave me the greatest gift, which was myself—how much I needed to show up for myself, take care of myself,” Patrick told Sage Steele.The former IndyCar Series and NASCAR driver said she felt like she was built for hard things when she was in a relationship with Rodgers,“Hindsight, I ignored it(emotionally abusive relationship), but in real life, it was just like, I would say all the time—I’m built for hard things. I can handle hard things. And so, I just saw it as a hard thing, and my nature is to try harder and do more.What if I don't do it for the right person? What if I get too proud and go like—I'm just I'm done. Instead of going—Man, just try a little harder. What if you look back and think—Man, I wish I would have tried. I would never want that in my life. I wish I would have tried. This is probably why I don't have regret and I don't have shame.”","Aaron Rodgers’ former partners have shared powerful excerpts from their past relationships, including phrases like “Depression would come,” “Dangerous to my psyche,’ and “Emotionally abusive.” Thanks to the podcast world, women have started expressing themselves beyond the fear of judgment.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123764899,imgsize-3192143,width-400,resizemode-4/nfl-aaron-rodgers.jpg"

MS Dhoni returns as CSK Captain, confirms coach Stephen Fleming

Poll When did you first realize MS Dhoni's potential as a game-changer in cricket? During the A series in Kenya When he became captain of the Indian team After the 2007 T20 World Cup I don't remember

Veteran wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik has opened up on the moment he first realised MS Dhoni was destined to change the face of Indian cricket . Speaking about their time in an ‘A’ series in Kenya, Karthik revealed how Dhoni’s raw power and unique technique left everyone in awe.“I hadn’t seen him play much but during that A series in Kenya, everyone was talking about one player, because he brought something new,"" he told India Today.""The power with which he hit the ball was something people said they hadn’t seen before. Some were even comparing him to Gary Sobers, known for those massive sixes.""Karthik admitted that although Dhoni’s batting style wasn’t conventional, the sheer force with which he struck the ball set him apart.“MS Dhoni had a very different technique, but he was hitting the ball as hard as anyone people had ever witnessed. That was the buzz at the time.”At that stage, India were using Rahul Dravid as a makeshift wicketkeeper to balance the team combination. But as Dravid sought relief from the gloves to focus on his batting, the selectors began searching for a long-term solution.""Back then, India were using Rahul Dravid as the wicketkeeper but Dravid had reached a point where he said, ‘Boss, I just want to focus on my batting.My body’s going through a lot trying to keep wickets.’ So the team started looking for a proper wicketkeeper. I stepped in briefly like a guest appearance in a movie but the lead role was always meant for Dhoni.Once Dhoni was handed the gloves, he didn’t just impress Indian selectors, but quickly became a sensation on the international stage. Karthik summed it up by saying, “When he arrived, he didn’t just impress India, he completely swept everyone off their feet.”The rest, as cricket fans know, is history — Dhoni went on to become one of India’s most successful captains and finishers, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire.",Dinesh Karthik opened up on the moment he realised MS Dhoni was destined to change the face of Indian cricket.

Logan Webb reaches 200 strikeouts



Fans react to Logan Webb's 200th strikeout



San Francisco Giants ace Logan Webb delivered a performance that spoke volumes about his durability and grit. Against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Webb struck out seven over six innings, reaching the 200-strikeout mark for the first time in his career. While he allowed four runs, only one earned, he battled through defensive miscues and gave the Giants a fighting chance in a crucial game for their NL Wild Card hopes.For years, Logan Webb has been tagged a “sinkerballer,” a label that often undersells his ability to miss bats. That narrative took a hit with his latest milestone, and his numbers now back it up. Webb came close last year with 194 strikeouts, but in 2025, he pushed past the threshold that separates good pitchers from dominant aces.A key factor in this leap has been his improved four-seam fastball up in the zone, a weapon that induces more swings and misses than ever before. It’s a subtle adjustment that has paid major dividends, elevating him from dependable starter to one of the league’s elite arms.Reaching 200 strikeouts is proof of Webb’s consistency. He’s also on pace for his third straight 200-inning season, reinforcing the value he brings to a Giants team clawing to stay in contention.Webb may not always get the national spotlight, but within San Francisco, he’s the ace steering their playoff push.MLB fans were quick to celebrate the astonishing milestone of the California native.Jeff Young wrote, “Logan Webb recorded 7 strikeouts tonight, giving him 201 strikeouts on the year. Only Garrett Crochet (225 strikeouts) and Tarik Skubal (222 strikeouts) are ahead of him in that category.”“Most underrated ACE over the last three seasons,” Zordan Morty shared on X.JP Mingo congratulated the MLB star for the latest milestone, “Congratulations Webb 200ks!”“Fire flames that’s our guy! We are so lucky. 🔥” Zackariah shared.Alex Pavlovic wrote, “One of Logan Webb's goals this season was to reach 200 strikeouts for the first time and he did it with three weeks to go. He currently leads the National League in strikeouts and innings pitched.”Webb’s latest milestone shows that he is on a mission to take his MLB career to a new height and by the look of it, he is pretty serious about it.Also Read: Phillies Karen clash revisited as family shares shocking details of Harrison Bader home run fight","San Francisco Giants ace Logan Webb struck out seven over six innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks.
