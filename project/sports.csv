NEW DELHI: India skipper Rohit Sharma shared a lighthearted moment during his latest appearance on The Great Indian Kapil Show , where he and some of his teammates were invited on the back of their 2024 T20 World Cup triumph.Rohit, along with Suryakumar Yadav Axar Patel , and Shivam Dube , represented the title-winning Indian team, and the episode was filled with fun and laughter, as the players took part in a mimicry segment.During the show, Rohit found himself in a hilarious situation when he was tasked with guessing a famous cricketer's identity based on Axar Patel's imitation.The name on the placard was none other than MS Dhoni , but Axar struggled to pull off Dhoni's shot imitation, leaving Rohit clueless.Despite Axar’s attempt, Rohit couldn’t figure out who the imitation was for—until Suryakumar Yadav stepped in with a helicopter shot.The moment Suryakumar recreated the famous shot, Rohit instantly recognized that the impersonation was of ""Thala"" MS Dhoni, much to the delight of the audience.Watch:Rohit’s response was filled with humour as he playfully scolded Axar for not thinking of the helicopter shot earlier.Speaking at an event in Rashin, Maharashtra, where he laid the foundation for a sports complex under CricKingdom on Wednesday, Rohit shared how winning the World Cup had transformed his life.He expressed his joy and satisfaction, stating that after India's long-awaited triumph, ""Our big goal was to win the World Cup, after winning the World Cup, my life has come to life.""The victory ended an 11-year drought for India in ICC tournaments, with Rohit leading the team to glory after several near misses, including losses in the 2022 T20 World Cup semi-final and the 2023 ODI World Cup final.","India captain Rohit Sharma appeared on The Great Indian Kapil Show.

In 2021, Virat Kohli stepped down as India's T20I captain, which was soon followed by him vacating the position in the ODIs and Tests as well. He left the post without an ICC trophy under his leadership, but former off-spinner Harbhajan Singh believes that doesn't make Kohli a ""lesser captain"".Speaking to 'Sports Yaari' in an interview, Harbhajan said Team India is now reaping benefits of the fire that was lit by Kohli during his days as captain.""Kohli ki kaptaani mei chaahe aap World Cup nahi jeete (you may not have won a World Cup under Kohli's captaincy), but it doesn't make him a lesser captain or lesser player,"" said Harbhajan, one of the best spinners India has produced.Harbhajan went on to explain that Kohli instilled the belief of taking a challenge head on and to not go down without a fight. He cited the example of the third and fourth Tests during the 2020-21 tour Australia when India clinched the Border Gavaskar Trophy with a heroic finish.Kohli, however, had to leave the four-Test series after the first match for the birth of his child, handing over the mantle to Ajinkya Rahane.""Jo usne aag lagayi na team mei (the fire that he ignited in the team), like it may be a target of 400 in the fourth innings of a Test, we'll go for the chase, we won't' panic. If we go down, we do it while chasing,"" Harbhajan said.India entered the third Test in Sydney on that tour with the series locked at 1-1. Set a daunting target of 408 to chase in the fourth innings, India sent a scare down in the Aussie camp before ending up with 334 for 5. The match ended in a draw.""...it takes a lot of guts and brain, which Kohli has instilled in the team. So every person has left his legacy,"" said the 44-year-old Harbhajan, who now wears the hat of a commentator.He then mentioned the knocks played by Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant in the fourth Test at the Gabba, which India won by three wickets while chasing a target of over 300 to clinch the series.While Gill contributed 91 runs, Pant's iconic 89 not out took India to a famous victory.""That determination to fight till the end, which Shubman and Rishabh showed to win that Test in Gabba. It was because the way the team's thinking changed,"" Harbhajan concluded.","Virat Kohli stepped down as India's T20I captain in 2021.

If you need to pick one player from the current Indian team who never loses his smile and sense of humour whatever be the situation, it has to be Rishabh Pant , who celebrates his 27th birthday on October 4.Most famous for his knock in the 2021 Brisbane Test, which ended Australia's dominance at the Gabba, the year 2024 has been a special one for the attacking wicketkeeper-batsman as he returned to international cricket after more than a year since his horrific car accident in December 2022.In the recently concluded home Test series against Bangladesh, which India swept 2-0, Pant made his Test comeback and announced it with his sixth Test century to join the legendary MS Dhoni for most Test hundreds by an Indian wicketkeeper.The ton positioned Pant as India's first-choice Test wicketkeeper-batsman once again, which will strengthen Rohit Shama & Co's defence of the Border Gavaskar Trophy later this year in Australia.The five-Test series commencing in the second half of November will bring back memories of Pant's 89 not out to script a memorable victory for India in Brisbane three years ago when the visitors chased a daunting 328 while playing with an understrength team.Talking about Pant's comeback this year, he marked his return to competitive cricket with the Indian Premier League (IPL), where he once again led Delhi Capitals. The Delhi franchise had picked Pant in the 2016 IPL auction.Pant's biggest moment in his new lease of life as a cricketer came in June this year when he was part of India's T20 World Cup triumph in the US and the Caribbean islands, where India defeated South Africa in a thrilling final to become the T20 champions once again after 17 years.The left-handed batsman from Delhi has so far played 35 Tests, 31 ODIs and 76 T20Is, scoring 2432, 871 and 1209 runs respectively.","Rishabh Pant celebrates his 27th birthday on October 4.

After Pakistan got the ICC Women's T20 World Cup off to a winning start on Thursday against Sri Lanka , it is time for a double header at the extravaganza in the UAE. South Africa, West Indies, India and New Zealand will be in contention today (4 October).The day begins with South Africa vs West Indies in Dubai in the sweltering afternoon heat followed by India against New Zealand in the evening.South Africa and the West Indies both suffered defeats in their warm-up matches leading up to the tournament, with South Africa's losses being particularly unexpected.They were bowled out for just 92 runs against New Zealand, resulting in an eight-wicket loss, and fell short of their 145-run target against India.In contrast, the West Indies lost to teams ranked significantly higher than them, first falling to India by 20 runs and then to Australia by 35 runs, struggling to chase down scores in the 140s on both occasions.South Africa finished as runners-up in the 2023 T20 World Cup and aim to maintain their momentum following a 2-1 series victory against Pakistan. Although they hold a 7-14 win-loss record against the West Indies, South Africa have triumphed in three of their last four T20 encounters with them.The West Indies also bring some positive momentum, having secured a 2-1 series victory in Sri Lanka, although that was back in June.South Africa might opt for a spin-heavy lineup, potentially including 18-year-old legspinner Seshnie Naidu along with allrounders Chloe Tryon and Sune Luus.The weather in Dubai is expected to be quite hot, with temperatures around 37°C at the time of the 1:30pm local time toss, remaining warm even after the match concludes.Laura Wolvaardt (capt), Anneke Bosch, Tazmin Brits, Nadine de Klerk, Annerie Dercksen, Mieke de Ridder, Ayanda Hlubi, Sinalo Jafta (wk), Marizanne Kapp, Ayabonga Khaka, Sune Luus, Nonkululeko Mlaba, Seshnie Naidu, Tumi Sekhukhune, Chloe TryonHayley Matthews (capt), Aaliyah Alleyne, Shamilia Connell, Deandra Dottin, Shemaine Campbelle (vice-capt, wk), Ashmini Munisar, Afy Fletcher, Stafanie Taylor, Chinelle Henry, Chedean Nation, Qiana Joseph, Zaida James, Karishma Ramharack, Mandy Mangru, Nerissa CraftonIndia secured victories in both their warm-up matches, winning by convincing margins of 20 runs against the West Indies and 28 runs against South Africa In contrast, New Zealand won one and lost the other warm-up game, defeating South Africa by eight wickets but going down to England by five wickets.Two players in the India squad, all-rounder Shreyanka Patil and wicketkeeper-batter Yastika Bhatia, are being monitored for fitness. Both participated in the warm-up matches, which is a positive sign for India. Head coach Amol Muzumdar confirmed on the eve of the match that captain Harmanpreet Kaur would bat at No. 3 , as she did in the warm-ups, although she has only batted in that position five times since 2019. The last occasion was against Ireland during the 2023 T20 World Cup when India’s opening partnership lasted 9.3 overs.Meanwhile, New Zealand enter the tournament after suffering ten consecutive losses in T20Is, including a 3-0 sweep by Australia. They will be eager to secure a win today to improve their chances of reaching the semi-finals.While India may have made a last-minute decision regarding their No. 3 batting position, New Zealand have opted to move their powerful captain, Sophie Devine, into the middle order, with Georgia Plimmer and Suzie Bates set to open.Both teams are anticipating significant dew during the evening match, making the toss crucial.

NEW DELHI: Batting maestro Virat Kohli feels that the fierce rivalry between India and Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy has evolved over the years.Initially marked by intensity and fierce competition, Kohli noted that the relationship has shifted towards respect especially after India's two successive Test series Down Under.Regarded as one of the most high-profile rivalries in Test cricket , the series has often seen heated exchanges and aggressive gameplay.However, Kohli explained that with time, both teams have developed a greater understanding and admiration for each other’s skills and achievements.Kohli echoed his sentiments on the Star Sports promo for the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy, starting on November 22, which will also be the first five-match Test series between the two teams since 1991/92.Talking about rivalry, Kohli said: ""It was quite intense at the beginning, but I think since the time we had won two Test series in Australia, the rivalry has turned into respect.""""We are not taken lightly now as a Test team. The respect looks quite visible when you play against Australia since we have beaten them for back-to-back series wins at their own backyard,"" Kohli further said.The all-important five-match series will begin at Perth followed by Adelaide (pink-ball game), Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney respectively.India's recent Test series win against Bangladesh consolidated their position at the top of the WTC standings with eight wins, two losses and a draw from 11 matches played for a collective 98 points.

NEW DELHI: Batting legend Sachin Tendulkar 's performances against Pakistan are some of the most memorable moments in cricket history. His battles with Pakistan's fierce bowling attack, featuring legends like Wasim Akram Waqar Younis , and Shoaib Akhtar , have become iconic.Sachin Tendulkar 's innings in the 1999 Chennai Test at the MA Chidambaram Stadium against Pakistan is remembered as one of his most valiant and heartbreaking performances.This Test was part of Pakistan's tour of India in 1999, which also marked the resumption of bilateral series between the two countries after almost a decade. It was an emotionally charged series with high expectations from both sides.In the first innings, Tendulkar was dismissed for a duck by Saqlain Mushtaq as India posted a modest total of 254.In the second innings, with India chasing a target of 271 for victory, Tendulkar played a heroic knock.Tendulkar came in to bat with India in trouble at 6/2. The situation worsened as India lost more wickets, and they were reduced to 82/5.Battling against Pakistan's world-class bowling attack of Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, and Saqlain Mushtaq, Tendulkar put together a crucial partnership with Nayan Mongia (52) to resurrect India's chances.Sachin batted with extreme patience, displaying a blend of defense and aggression, especially against Saqlain Mushtaq, who had dismissed him in the first innings. However, during his knock, Sachin was suffering from severe back spasms, making it even more remarkable.Tendulkar reached his century under immense pressure and brought India to within touching distance of victory. His 136 was a masterclass in handling pressure and tackling a quality attack on a deteriorating pitch.With India needing just 17 more runs to win, Sachin was dismissed by Saqlain Mushtaq, caught by Wasim Akram at mid-off trying to loft a delivery over the infield. His wicket turned the tide of the game.After Sachin's dismissal, India lost their last three wickets for just four runs, collapsing from 254/6 to 258 all out, falling short of the target by just 12 runs.In a viral video, former BCCI president the late Raj Singh Dungarpur, who played a key role in Tendulkar's early career and development and as chairman of selectors had selected Tendulkar for India's tour of Pakistan in 1989 he was just 16 years old, recalls what happened after the Chennai Test when Sachin didn't come to collect his Man of the Match award.Dungarpur says, ""I came down to the dressing room, I think it's fair for me to say he was weeping like a school boy. I kept on telling him, 'why are you taking the whole blame on yourself, by then we had lost the match. You made impossible possible by playing this great innings.' He said 'no sir, I have lost this match'.""Dungarpur continues, ""We were at the podium, I think very few times you get the Man of the Match on the losing side. He got the Man of the Match on the losing side. From the podium I signaled to Anshuman Gaekwad, the coach of the Indian team, and asked where is he (Tendulkar). He said 'not coming'. I think that's what commitment is all about.""Pakistan's win was hailed as one of their finest, and Saqlain Mushtaq's five-wicket haul in the second innings, including the crucial wicket of Tendulkar, was instrumental. Tendulkar was left devastated after the match, sitting alone in the dressing room for hours after the game ended.Despite the heartbreaking defeat, Sachin Tendulkar's 136 is considered one of his greatest innings. He single-handedly brought India to the brink of victory, battling both the opposition and his own physical pain.Tendulkar's decision to play through severe back pain showcased his dedication and fighting spirit and this knock cemented Tendulkar's reputation as a master of tough situations and a cricketer who could take on the best bowling attacks under immense pressure.Though India lost the match, Tendulkar's effort remains legendary, demonstrating his resilience and class in one of the most dramatic Test matches between India and Pakistan.","Sachin Tendulkar's innings in the 1999 Chennai Test against Pakistan is remembered as one of his most valiant and heartbreaking performances. The Test was part of Pakistan's tour of India in 1999, which also marked the resumption of bilateral series between the two countries after almost a decade. Sachin's 136 was a masterclass in handling pressure and tackling a quality attack on a deteriorating pitch.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113901750,imgsize-116188,width-400,resizemode-4/113901750.jpg"

SHARJAH: Pakistan staged a determined fightback to beat Sri Lanka by 31 runs in their opening game of the Women's T20 World Cup campaign in Sharjah on Thursday.Left-arm spinner Sadia Iqbal claimed three wickets with Nashra Sandhu , Omaima Sohail and Fatima Sana all taking two each for Pakistan as Asia Cup champions Sri Lanka fell comfortably short of their target of 117.Pakistan needed a crucial lower-order knock from their captain Sana to post a competitive total, having slumped to 84-8 after winning the toss and choosing to bat.Sugandika Kumari had both Pakistan openers caught behind off her left-arm spin and the wickets continued to tumble at regular intervals.Sohail made 18 and Nida Dar added 23 but Pakistan looked in danger of failing to reach 100 as Sri Lanka skipper Chamari Athapaththu picked up three wickets with her off-spin.Athapaththu finished with 3-18 and Kumari took 3-19 but Sana's 30 off 20 balls, featuring three fours and a six, frustrated Sri Lanka and proved a match-winning contribution.She was eventually dismissed by left-arm seamer Udeshika Prabodhani, who ended with 3-20.Pakistan lost opening bowler Diana Baig to a calf strain after just one ball of the Sri Lanka innings, but her replacement Sana picked up the vital wicket of Athapaththu -- caught at extra cover for six.Sohail bowled Harshitha Samarawickrama and Hasini Perera cheaply, but while Vishmi Gunaratne remained at the crease there was hope for Sri Lanka.Kavisha Dilhari holed out to long-on off Sandhu while trying to increase the run rate to leave Sri Lanka reeling at 47-4 in the 11th over.Nilakshika Silva earned a reprieve when she was trapped lbw from a delivery called a dead ball after Sandhu's towel fell out of her pocket.But Gunaratne perished for 20 three balls later as she was caught just inside the boundary attempting to hit Sandhu straight down the ground.Silva departed for 22 in the penultimate over after a top edge to short fine leg.Neither team has ever made it out of the group stage in eight previous attempts at the T20 World Cup.Pakistan face arch-rivals India in their next game on Sunday, while Sri Lanka take on tournament favourites Australia who are bidding for a seventh title in nine editions.",Pakistan beat Sri Lanka by 31 runs in their opening game of the Women's T20 World Cup in Sharjah.

NEW DELHI: The Indian women's team will begin its 2024 T20 World Cup campaign against New Zealand at the Dubai International Stadium on Friday and head coach Amol Muzumdar has said that captain Harmanpreet Kaur will be batting at the no.3 slot throughout the tournament.Jemimah Rodrigues, who usually bats at three, has been moved to number five, prompting India to experiment with Yastika Bhatia, Dayalan Hemalatha, Sajeevan Sajana and Uma Chetry at that slot.Harmanpreet however took the no.3 position in the warm-up wins against the West Indies and South Africa and will continue in that role.“Absolutely, not just the warm-up games, but we had already decided back in India and in the camps that happened before we set off from Mumbai. We had a lovely camp in Bangalore, and we decided there. Basically, these pre-World Cup matches absolutely stamped that for us. Go through the scorecard, you'll find out,” said Muzumdar in the pre-match press conference.Harmanpreet, capable of delivering useful off-spin, hasn’t bowled in T20 matches for some time.Muzumdar discussed the lack of a sixth bowling option for India, stating, “We've paid a lot of attention to the sixth bowling option. Also, for a fact that we have had multiple discussions within our top six, at least three to four have to bowl. If we can get those overs out of them, then nothing like it.”“All of them could bowl. So, it's just a question of applying and just putting in those hard yards in the nets and then converting that into a match performance. So, Harman hasn't bowled, but she bowled in the second T20 warm-ups, and is experienced enough to bowl those overs.”Muzumdar emphasized improvements in the team’s fitness and fielding, areas he has focused on since taking charge. “Basically, if you see in the first press conference, I had said that fielding and fitness would be of prime importance. We have worked upon it, thoroughly gone deeper into it, and tried to absolutely work individually.”“First in regards to the volume as far as fielding is concerned, and then in fitness, we have paid attention to each individual to take their fitness levels to the next level. So, I think we have put in that effort. The effort has been there. I think you will definitely see the results.”As the team embarks on its first T20 World Cup since the advent of the Women’s Premier League (WPL), the tournament has produced more statistics and breakout stars. New talents like Sajeevan Sajana, Shreyanka Patil, and Asha Sobhana are part of the Indian squad for the tournament.Muzumdar also acknowledged the significance of the WPL in shaping the current team.“WPL has been a very successful tournament so far in the last couple of editions. You have seen what response WPL has had. Obviously, the stats have helped and we have dug into a lot of statistics and we have seen the results.”“Some of the players that have come into the Indian squad here at the World Cup, are a product of WPL as well. Of course, not undermining the first-class cricket as well back home, but WPL has given us a strong base to find players.”“That's actually a good headache to have. We do have a lot of talent in the team, talent in this 15 and beyond as well. So, as I said, good headache to have. But me, Harman, Smriti, we enjoy that kind of stuff where we try out different combinations, and then finally we have figured out the right combination that we are going to play tomorrow.”“Whoever has got an opportunity, they have performed at their own numbers, whether it is batting number or, bowling, they have performed really well and that's why they are there in the team. So we found the right combination I guess.”","Harmanpreet Kaur will be batting at the no.3 slot throughout the tournament. Jemimah Rodrigues, who usually bats at three, has been moved to number five.

LUCKNOW: Run-machine Sarfaraz Khan had made a promise to his Mumbai teammates and his family after his younger brother Musheer was ruled out of the Irani Cup match against Rest of India , following a road accident: score a double hundred .Known to amass big scores, Sarfaraz kept his word with a magnificent knock of 222 to guide Mumbai to a mammoth 537 all out on the third day of their match, even as Musheer was recovering from the accident he suffered while travelling to the city for the game along with his father Naushad Khan ""Yes, it has been an emotional week for me. I had promised my family and teammates that if I am set, I will score 200 - a hundred for me and hundred for my brother (Musheer),"" Sarfaraz told reporters at the end of day's play.""If he (Musheer) had played in the match, abbu (father) would have been prouder. Unfortunately, he met with an accident. So, I thought I must somehow score a double ton in this match.""Sarfaraz, 26, said he has spoken to his brother who is seven years younger to the man who is once again knocking on the national selectors' doors.""Yeah, I spoke with him. He is fine but will take two-three months to recover,"" said Sarfaraz, who struck a half-century against England in the Dharamsala Test in March.Sarfaraz became the first player to score an Irani Cup double hundred for Mumbai.His 15th first-class centurywill certainly dispel all doubts about his slot as a reserve middle-order batter for the remainder of the Test season (8 games).Asked about his penchant for making big scores, Sarfaraz said, ""I'm known to play big knocks. I feel good doing things I'm known for. Mumbai also needed me to bat long,"" he said.""It's a big opportunity for us to win the Irani Cup after a long time. Back of the mind, I thought of playing as long as possible, putting as many runs on the board as possible which will help the team win,"" Sarfaraz added.The Ekana Stadium track had underlying moisture on the second day and the dampness contributed to the ball seaming around initially and the extra bounce made it challenging for batters.Sarfaraz's driving on the off-side was regal and there is nothing more to add to his footwork against spinners. He was brutal, especially against left-arm spinner Manav Suthar (0/137 in 37 overs), who looked clueless.After a certain point, he employed the negative leg-stump line and Sarfaraz would either slightly go inside out or bent down on one knee to slog sweep it for maximums.Speaking further about his monumental effort, he said, ""I have played in the Irani Cup earlier and scored a century for the Rest of India. But this is a very emotional innings for me as I'm playing for my home team. I am putting an extra effort so that Mumbai can lift the Cup.""If you look at it, weather was obviously a challenge. We are up against some of best players in India right now,"" he said.""Most of them have played international cricket. I was looking to make runs against them. It was an opportunity to give my best. I am satisfied with the time I spent in the middle.""The whole bunch has put in lot of effort to reach the Irani Cup by winning the Ranji Trophy last season. It's not like our team can't win this tournament). In fact, we are one of the best teams in India. So, we hope to do well and win it.""","Sarfaraz Khan scored 222 to guide Mumbai to a mammoth 537 all out against Rest of India. His brother Musheer was ruled out of the Irani Cup match following a road accident.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan great Zaheer Abbas on Thursday cited focus on T20 cricket and the influx of money as key reasons for the decline of Pakistan cricket .At a cricket conclave, Abbas shared his concerns over the current state of cricket in Pakistan. ""There's too much T20 cricket being played in Pakistan, and because of that, our players have forgotten the essence of Test cricket.This is why we're not performing well in the longer format,"" news agency ANI quoted Abbas as saying.The growing popularity of T20 cricket has created an imbalance between formats. Abbas, who once elevated Pakistan cricket to great heights, expressed his disappointment with the modern players' focus on financial gains.""So much money has come into cricket that the players today are only focused on making money, and their attention is diverted from the game itself,"" he remarked.According to Abbas, the shift towards financial priorities is a key reason why Pakistan has struggled to maintain its dominance in international cricket, especially in Test matches.The former Pakistan captain strongly critiqued the leadership within the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). ""It is the misfortune of Pakistan cricket that those who run it do not understand cricket,"" he said, expressing frustration with cricket administration in the country.""We took Pakistan cricket to great heights. The world admired our cricket. But today, those in charge are only concerned with their own interests, not with cricket or the players.""Abbas also spoke the upcoming 2025 ICC Champions Trophy , which is set to take place in Pakistan, calling for smooth cricketing relations between India and Pakistan.""The Indian team is a great ambassador of cricket. If they come and play in Pakistan, it will take cricket forward in our country.""The strained relations between India and Pakistan have affected their cricketing ties, with no bilateral series taking place for several years.Abbas called for renewed engagement, which could help revive cricket in Pakistan.The legend also shared a memorable and humorous incident from a Test match against India in 1978, where he faced an unexpected bowler in Sunil Gavaskar.""When I saw Gavaskar coming to bowl, I thought it would be tough for me. I wasn't taking him seriously,"" Abbas chuckled. However, his light-hearted approach cost him dearly. ""I played a shot, it went in the air, and I was caught,"" he said.The moment marked Gavaskar's only wicket in Test cricket, a fact the Indian great would later fondly recall. ""Gavaskar said he'll always be proud of the fact that his first and only Test wicket was that of Zaheer Abbas,"" Abbas shared with a smile.","Former Pakistan captain Zaheer Abbas spoke at a cricket conclave in New Delhi.

India then scored 285/9 decl. quickly and managed to take two Bangladesh wickets late on the penultimate day. On the final day, India bowled out Bangladesh for 146 and then chased down 95 for an brisk win.""I actually do (If India will play same cricket in Australia).

It was not about 'How many runs I score', it is about finding enough time to bowl Bangladesh out. They played a great brand of cricket, but it was all about giving them enough time.

SHARJAH: Bangladesh kicked off the Women's T20 World Cup campaign with a scrappy 16-run win over tournament debutants Scotland in the searing heat of Sharjah on Thursday.After winning the toss and batting first, Sobhana Mostary top-scored with 36 for Bangladesh in a below par total of 119-7.Their bowlers then strangled the Scotland reply and in spite of Sarah Bryce's 49 not out, the newcomers could only muster 103-7 in reply, handing Bangladesh their first win in a T20 World Cup in a decade.It was a tough opener for both sides with temperatures hitting 38 degrees celsius and the batters stymied by a sluggish pitch and slow outfield.There were just 15 fours in the match and no sixes to cheer the sparsely-populated stands.The Bangladesh innings got off to a solid start with an opening partnership of 26 before Murshida Khatun, dropped on 12, slogged the next ball she faced from Katheryn Bryce to mid-on where Katherine Fraser took the catch.Shathi Rani then combined with Sobhana Mostary to add 42 for the second wicket before Shathi's attempt to accelerate the scoring resulted in a skied catch to Saskia Horley at mid-on, her 29 coming off 32 balls.Taj Nehar, on her 27th birthday, was run out for a duck before Mostary charged down the wicket to Olivia Bell and was comfortably stumped by Sarah Bryce for 36 from 38 balls.The end of the innings fell away with Bangladesh's star batter Nigar Sultana Joty, playing her 100th T20I, falling in the final over for 18, a third wicket for Saskia Horley who finished with 3-13 in two overs.Scotland's reply began poorly with the early dismissal of Horley, stumped off the impressive Fahima Khatun.When Marufa bowled Katheryn Bryce with one that nipped back and kept low, Scotland were already behind the pace at 31-2 at the end of the six-over powerplay and they never made that up.Player of the match Ritu Moni nipped in with 2-15 from her four overs as Bangladesh chipped away at the Scottish batters, while Sarah Bryce, who also kept wicket, began to feel the effects of the heat.Her 49 off 52 balls featured just one boundary which tells the tale of Scotland's defeat.Pakistan play Sri Lanka in the day's second match later in Sharjah.","Sobhana Mostary top-scored with 36 for Bangladesh in a below par total of 119-7.

TIEBREAK UPSET

BEIJING: Carlos Alcaraz rallied from a set down and held his nerve in a deciding tiebreak to beat defending champion Jannik Sinner 6-7(6) 6-4 7-6(3) in the China Open final on Wednesday and win his fourth title of the season.French Open and Wimbledon champion Alcaraz, who won both of his previous meetings with Sinner this year, recovered from a slow start to wrap up victory in three hours, 21 minutes and improve his head-to-head record with the Italian to 6-4.While the stage might not have been as grand as it was in some of their recent encounters, Sinner and Alcaraz pushed each other to the limit in the latest chapter of the burgeoning rivalry that has taken the ATP Tour by storm.""He could have won in two, I could have won in two, it was a really close match. Jannik once again showed that he's the best player in the world, with the level that he's playing,"" Alcaraz, 21, said.""It is unbelievable, it's a really high quality of tennis , physically, mentally, he's a beast.""I had my chances in the first set but didn't make it, but in general I'm proud of myself. The way that I dealt with the match, the way that I managed everything. For me, it was a really good match.""After both players defended break points in a cagey start, Alcaraz seized the early break for a 3-1 lead when Sinner's backhand went wide, before consolidating the advantage in the next as his Italian opponent netted a shot.World number one Sinner, whose last win over Alcaraz came in the semi-finals of this tournament last year, gradually found his range to level at 5-5 and save two set points in the tiebreak to clinch the first set.Alcaraz was on the ropes early in the second set and Sinner pushed him hard in a 15-minute game, but the second seed successfully held serve for 4-4.Sinner's failure to break in the lengthy game appeared to take the wind out of his sails, as Alcaraz sped through the next two games to level the match at a set apiece.The Spaniard cranked up the intensity on his forehand and broke for a 2-1 lead in the third set, but with victory seemingly in sight, he suffered a lapse in concentration and allowed Sinner to level at 4-4.In the deciding tiebreak, Sinner snatched control to take a 3-0 lead, but some excellent work at the net helped Alcaraz edge a couple of rallies and go ahead 4-3, before finally clinching the title with an emphatic cross-court forehand winner.The tiebreak defeat was uncharacteristic for Sinner, who had won 18 out of his past 19 tiebreaks.Asked if Sinner's record had caused him any doubt, Alcaraz said: ""I never lost hope, but honestly, I know that stat. Every time that Jannik plays (a tiebreak), it goes to his side.""I'm not going to lie, at 3-0 down and with two mini breaks for him, I thought, 'Okay, I have to give everything that I have just to try to give myself the opportunity to be close'.""I played great points just to make it 3-3 and after that, I just thought 'go for it'. If I lost it, at least I went for it.""The result denied Australian Open and U.S. Open champion Sinner becoming the first man to retain the crown at the China National Tennis Centre since Novak Djokovic won four straight titles between 2012-15.",Carlos Alcaraz beats Jannik Sinner 6-7(6) 6-4 7-6(3) in the China Open final.

BEIJING: Jannik Sinner ignored the bubbling controversy over his steroid case and a roaring home crowd to set up a China Open final against Carlos Alcaraz on Tuesday.The world number one and defending champion defeated the 96th-ranked Chinese wildcard Bu Yunchaokete 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) to avoid a major upset.The Italian faces Spanish second seed Alcaraz, who was in fine form in a 7-5, 6-3 victory over Russian third seed Daniil Medvedev in the other semi-final.In front of a packed house on China's national day, US Open champion Sinner was facing a player he had never met before and who was competing in the biggest match of his life.China's 22-year-old Bu was also in the form of his life, having similarly reached the semi-finals last week in Hangzhou.Bu had Sinner under pressure on the Italian's serve early in the first set, but Sinner staved off the threat and the storm gradually blew itself out as the set wore on.They went to the tie break in the second set, with Sinner serving an ace to convert his third match point after just over two hours.Nobody has won more matches on tour this season than Sinner, 23, who failed two doping tests in March but was cleared of wrongdoing and allowed to keep playing.Tennis authorities accepted Sinner's explanation that trace amounts of a banned steroid unintentionally entered his system from a physiotherapist who used a spray containing it to treat a cut, then provided massage and sports therapy.The World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) reignited the case on Saturday, saying it had appealed the decision and is seeking a ban of up to two years.Sinner has admitted to having sleepless nights over the issue.Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz reached his first final in the Chinese capital and is in ominous form, yet to drop a set.""I think I played really well. Obviously if I want to beat Daniil, I have to play really good tennis, high-quality tennis,"" said Alcaraz, who is chasing a 16th ATP Tour title -- which would equal Sinner.""I felt great on the court once again, so I'm really happy about it. I think I couldn't ask for a better semi-final.""The final is on Wednesday.In the women's draw, 595th-ranked home hope Zhang Shuai -- one of the storylines of the tournament -- rolled into the quarter-finals to make more history.Her 6-4, 6-2 victory over Magdalena Frech was her fourth win in Beijing and all in straight sets -- having come into the event after losing 24 singles matches in a row.The barren run lasting more than 600 days was the second-longest on the WTA Tour in the Open Era, which began in 1968.The 35-year-old Zhang, a former two-time Grand Slam quarter-finalist who has been plagued by injury, said she had come close to quitting singles tennis before coming to Beijing.""I had no idea how to win and I didn't want to lose another, especially with all the Chinese fans,"" she said.""Walking back to the locker room, I didn't know if I should continue or not before this tournament.""The former top-25 player will face Spain's 19th-ranked Paula Badosa in the last eight.Zhang is the lowest-ranked player to reach this stage of the China Open and struck a defiant pose -- a tribute to Kylian Mbappe -- after beating 31st-ranked Frech.Former world number two Badosa dumped out US Open finalist Jessica Pegula 6-4, 6-0 to make the second-seeded American the biggest casualty so far.","Jannik Sinner beats 96th-ranked Chinese wildcard Bu Yunchaokete 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) Italian faces Spanish second seed Carlos Alcaraz in the other semi-final.

BEIJING: Top-ranked Jannik Sinner rallied to beat Roman Safiullin 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 in the second round of the China Open on Saturday and learned afterward that his steroid case is far from over.While Sinner was on court in Beijing, the World Anti-Doping Agency announced it was seeking a ban of one to two years for the U.S. Open champion who tested positive twice for an anabolic steroid in March but was not suspended in a decision by an independent tribunal announced by the International Tennis Integrity Agency on Aug.20 because the ITIA determined he was not to blame.Sinner's fate will now be determined by the Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sport after WADA said it filed an appeal on Thursday.""Obviously, I'm very disappointed and also surprised of this appeal, to be honest, because we had three hearings,"" Sinner said at a press conference after his match Saturday. ""All three hearings came out very positively for me.""You know, I was not expecting it. I knew it couple of days ago, that they were going to appeal, that today it's going to go official. But yeah, it's surprise.""On court Saturday, the two-time Grand Slam champion again found himself behind in the Chinese capital after Safiullin broke serve twice to claim the opening set.Sinner's power and laser-like accuracy from the baseline gradually chipped away at his Russian opponent and helped the Italian to win seven straight games from 2-2 in the second set to take the ascendancy and close out a gritty win.Sinner, who has reached at least the quarterfinals at every tour-level event he has played in 2024, will next play Jiri Lehecka, who earlier defeated Roberto Bautista Agut 3-6, 6-2, 6-1.Third-seeded Daniil Medvedev , who lost to Sinner in this year's Australian Open final, also reached the last eight after beating French veteran Adrian Mannarino 7-6 (6), 6-2.Medvedev, the 2021 U.S. Open champion, had eight aces and broke Mannarino's serve four times as he advanced to his 75th tour-level quarterfinal.""Titles are more important obviously than finals. But even then 75 quarterfinals are great,"" said Medvedev, who is Russian. ""When I made my first quarterfinal (it) was (in) Moscow and I was pretty happy. And now it's 75. I am still happy, but not the same way.""He next faces Italy's Flavio Cabolli, who advanced with a 6-4, 6-2 win over Pavel Kotov.In the women's draw, U.S. Open champion Aryna Sabalenka advanced to the third round with a 6-4, 6-1 win over Thai qualifier Mananchaya Sawangkaew.""In the first set, I was struggling a little bit with the rhythm,"" said Sabalenka, who's best run in Beijing has only been to the quarterfinals. ""In the second set, seems like everything started working much better. I think that's why it was more smooth and better quality.""The second-ranked Sabalenka is the top seed in Beijing in the absence of Iga Swiatek .Next up for the three-time major winner is American Ashlyn Krueger, who beat New Zealand's Lulu Sun 6-1, 7-6 (4).Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen of China, seeded fifth, also advanced with a 6-1, 6-1 win over unseeded Kamilla Rakhimova. Her next opponent, Nadia Podoroska of Argentina, is also unseeded.Third-seeded Jasmine Paolini of Italy rallied from a poor first set to beat Denmark's Clara Tauson 1-6, 7-5, 6-4. Paolini, the French Open and Wimbledon runner-up, will play Poland's Magda Linette after the 31st-seeded player also needed three sets to progress past Moyuka Uchijima 6-4, 4-6, 6-3.Ninth-seeded Daria Kasatkina of Russia beat Croatian Jana Fett 6-1, 6-2. She will play Amanda Anisimova, who beat Camila Osorio of Colombia 1-6, 6-3, 6-4.Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova was upset 1-6, 6-4, 7-5 by Romania's Jaqueline Cristian.American Madison Keys, seeded 18th, won 6-2, 6-1 against Spaniard Sara Sorribes Tormo and next faces 13th-seeded Beatriz Haddad Maia of Brazil.Japan Open Tomas Machac upset fifth-seeded Tommy Paul 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (4) to advance to the quarterfinals and continued a disappointing week for the top-seeded players in Tokyo.Top-seeded Taylor Fritz, third-seeded Casper Ruud and fourth-seeded Stefaos Tsitsipas were all beaten in the first round, before second-seeded Hubert Hurkacz was also eliminated as he lost to U.S. Open semifinalist Jack Draper 6-4, 6-4 in the second round.Sixth-seeded Holger Rune is the highest-ranked seed remaining in the draw. Rune, from Denmark, beat home favorite Yoshihito Nishioka 6-2, 6-4.Defending champion Ben Shelton , the No. 8 seed, is the only other seeded player left in the quarterfinal draw.Alex Michelsen of the U.S. also advanced after a 6-1, 6-4 win over Australian Christopher O'Connell to set up a quarterfinal match against Machac.Kei Nishikori beat Jordan Thompson 6-2, 6-3 and will play Rune in the quarterfinals.","Top-ranked Jannik Sinner rallies to beat Roman Safiullin 3-6, 6-2,. 6-3 in the second round of the China Open.

South Korean Lee Hyun Il is Sindhu's consulting coach

BENGALURU: After a disappointing Paris Olympics , PV Sindhu has a new coach, though temporarily, in former Olympian Anup Sridhar . The two-time Olympic medallist will work with the Karnataka man for the remainder of the year and the duo will sit down by the year-end to decide upon the future.Sridhar came into the picture after Sindhu's coach Indonesian Agus Dwi Santoso's contract got over after the quadrennial event.The former international player was taken on board after a successful meeting with the star player and her team. For the last three weeks, the ace shuttler, who trained at the Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy (PPBA) before Paris, has been sweating it out for almost five hours daily under the watchful eyes of Sridhar at the Gachibowli Stadium in Hyderabad. She has been involved in sparring sessions and fitness routines too. The current coaching team also includes former Korean shuttler Lee Hyun Il .Sridhar is pleased with the way the new partnership has begun and is keen to work on different aspects of Sindhu's game in the coming weeks. ""The start has been good so far. The first thing was to get her pain free, playing and moving freely on the court, which we have achieved. Now we're working on getting her speed and endurance levels up. There's a decent amount of improvement,"" Sridhar told TOI. ""I have tried to devise training programmes and routines around the areas that she's finding a little bit difficult.""The last 21 months has not been great for Sindhu as she did not win a single BWF singles title. The task is now cut out for Sridhar as her results in the next three months could prove to be the difference between a long or short-term association with Sindhu. However, the Bengaluruean is looking beyond the results.""The results are certainly important, but I wouldn't say it is the only important thing to look at. No miracles are going to be performed either by me or by anybody else, real change takes time. But I think this period is important from the point of view of how we work together, how we communicate. The working relationship will be important,"" he said.To start with, Sindhu has marked two events for next month, the Arctic Open in Finland (Oct 8-13, Super 500), and Denmark Open in Odense (Oct 15-20, Super 750).

HYDERABAD: Amid the uneasy quiet caused by Saina Nehwal 's repeated hints at retirement and PV Sindhu 's indifferent form of late, Anmol Kharb has quietly announced her arrival on the big stage with two back-to-back titles.Many pundits, including Pullela Gopichand , say the 17-year-old shuttler from Haryana can fill the gap, following her international triumphs in Belgium and Poland in the last two weeks.Sunday last, she routed Milena Schnider of Switzerland 21-12, 21-8 in the final of the Poland Open . A week before that, Anmol started the Belgium Open as a qualifier and went on to win her first women's singles title with a 24-22, 12-21, 21-10 victory against Amalie Schulz of Denmark in Leuven.And to think that she nearly missed the event. Anmol reached the Belgium Open venue an hour before her match after a long flight due to a visa issue. But she won seven straight matches to clinch the title.Anmol is also credited with helping the Indian women win the Badminton Asia Team Championship by pulling off crucial matches against top-ranked opponents in February. A gritty player, Anmol became the women's national champion last year when she was just 16.It is this never-say-die attitude and her willingness to work hard with a smile that makes Gopichand see a Saina in Anmol.""She is like Saina, very gritty and never leaves without putting up a tough fight,"" Gopichand told TOI on Tuesday after Anmol won her second international title in Poland.Gopichand, who shaped the careers of Saina, Sindhu, Kidambi Srikanth and several others, is not surprised by Anmol's progress. ""I am not at all surprised by her results. She will win more tournaments. A few basics in her game need correction. She has a good future and is on the right track,"" Gopichand added.A big fan of Saina, Anmol is being trained by Saina's husband Parupalli Kashyap, RMV Gurusaidutt and former international Rahul Yadav.Currently ranked 165th, Anmol's target is to get into the top-15 as soon as possible. In a bid to improve her ranking, the teen is busy collecting ranking points by winning as many tournaments as possible.","Anmol Kharb has quietly announced her arrival on the big stage with two back-to- back titles.
