China Anti Doping Agency: China vs USA - Intense Doping Allegations Amid Medal Standings in Paris Olympics 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/at-paris-olympics-china-vs-usa-verbal-duel-over-doping-allegations-boils-over/articleshow/112365396.cms,"The Chinese anti-doping agency has demanded increased testing of US athletes on Thursday, alleging that the United States is hiding ""systemic"" doping violations. This comes amidst an escalating verbal dispute between the two nations, which are currently leading the Olympic medal standings.The feud began after a media report in April revealed that 23 Chinese swimmers had tested positive for a prohibited substance prior to the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, but were still permitted to participate in the competition.The World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) accepted the Chinese authorities' explanation that the positive results were due to contaminated food, and as a result the athletes were not sanctioned.These disclosures led to widespread criticism of WADA, especially from the United States, which angered China by accusing the global governing body of engaging in a cover-up. The ongoing exchange of accusations between the two countries has further intensified the tension surrounding the issue of doping in international sports.The China Anti-Doping Agency ( CHINADA ), hit back on Thursday in a statement, stating that ""there is reason to suspect that there is a systemic doping problem in track and field in the United States"".CHINADA has raised questions regarding the handling of a doping case involving Erriyon Knighton, a sprinter from the United States. In March, Knighton tested positive for a prohibited substance, but an independent arbitrator determined that the positive result was likely caused by contaminated meat, allowing him to participate in the Paris Olympics .Knighton has successfully advanced to the final round of the men's 200-meter event, scheduled for Thursday in Paris.CHINADA expressed concerns about the apparent lack of additional positive tests for the steroid, which is commonly used in livestock, among other US athletes. The agency also questioned why the US Anti-Doping Agency ( USADA ) had not provided sufficient warnings to American athletes about the potential risks of contamination from this substance.China has further alleged ""deep-rooted stains in... US athletics and USADA's repeated disregard for procedures and standards"".CHINADA did not present any proof that US athletes participating in the current Olympic Games had tested positive for banned substances.In the Paris Olympics medal standings currently, the United States holds the top position with 27 gold medals, narrowly ahead of China, which has secured 25 gold.Despite the doping controversy, China selected 11 of the implicated swimmers to compete in their team for the Paris Olympics. The Chinese swimming team concluded the competition with a total of 12 medals, including two gold, three silver, and seven bronze.In June, CHINADA firmly stated that it would ""never"" comply with the United States' request to disclose information regarding its probe into the 23 swimmers involved in the scandal.","The Chinese anti-doping agency has demanded increased testing of US athletes.

PARIS: South Paris Arena is spread across 35 hectares. It is a hub of convention centres, a part of the Paris Expo. Found myself inside Hall 6 after a frantic walk through a sea of bodies. This looked like the busiest venue at the Paris Games.Saikhom Mirabai Chanu had just walked on the stage during the introduction to loud applause; she was No. 10 on the competition list in a field of 12.But that number did not matter. The Indian lifter who won a silver at Tokyo Games was in medal contention. She always is. Sadly, she finished fourth, just 1kg behind her Thai rival who took bronze.In the snatch, which has pulled her down sometimes, becoming the difference between gold and silver, Mirabai finally ended the jinx of 85kg. She lifted 85kg in her first try. She looked comfortable. But she missed when the bar was raised to 88kg on her second try.She returned determined. On her third try, she snatched the barbell well, sat on her haunches for a while and got up for a ‘good lift’. Who knows, if she had managed 88kg in the second, she could have gone for 89 or 90kg.Mirabai finished third in snatch. Tied with her was Thailand’s Surodchana Khambao . They were behind Valentin Cambei of Romania (93) and Hou Zhihui of China who lifted 93kg. The gap with the leader was 5kg. The real battle had begun. The fight for the medals was between these four ladies.Clean and jerk is where Mirabai shows her true mettle. Her first try began at 111kg. Before that Cambei started with 106kg and went for 110kg on her second try. Zhou and Suradchana also cleared 110kg.Mirabai then came in, touched the barbell and her forehead in a personal prayer, then went for it. She missed it. But she returned and cleared it on her second try. She had a total of 199kg. A medal was looking likely. She missed 114kg on her third try and waited for Zhou who was tied with her with two tries to go. Zhou and Mirabai were tied at 199kg after her second try. She lifted 117kg on her third try to win the gold with 206kg. Cambei was second and the Thai girl won bronze, a kg ahead of Mirabai.",Saikhom Mirabai Chanu finished fourth in the women's snatch at the Paris Games.

He grew up in a region once covered in sugar cane fields, assisting his father with the harvest. His introduction to golf came from hitting tin cans with a guava tree stick, and he later found employment as a caddie.Following his service in the US Army from 1955-57, Rodriguez joined the PGA Tour in 1960. Throughout his 21-year career, he secured eight victories and participated in one Ryder Cup team. His first win was at the 1963 Denver Open, and his final triumph came at the 1979 Tallahassee Open. On the Champions Tour, he amassed 22 victories from 1985-2002, with combined career earnings surpassing $7.6 million. In 1992, he was enshrined in the PGA World Golf Hall of Fame.Rodriguez was renowned for his entertaining antics on the fairway, such as twirling his club like a sword or performing a celebratory dance after making a birdie putt. Despite suffering a heart attack in October 1998, he recovered and continued competing for a couple of years before shifting his focus to community and charity endeavors, notably the Chi Chi Rodriguez Youth Foundation.In his later years, Rodriguez primarily resided in Puerto Rico, engaging in various projects and events. He is survived by his wife of nearly 60 years, Iwalani, and his wife's daughter from a previous marriage, Donnette.PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan expressed his condolences, saying, ""Chi Chi Rodriguez's passion for charity and outreach was surpassed only by his incredible talent with a golf club in his hand. A vibrant, colorful personality both on and off the golf course, he will be missed dearly by the PGA Tour and those whose lives he touched in his mission to give back. The PGA Tour sends its deepest condolences to the entire Rodriguez family during this difficult time.""","Juan ""Chi Chi"" Rodriguez died on Thursday at the age of 88.

Nonetheless, Neeraj's accomplishment makes him the second male athlete from post-independence India to secure two Olympic medals in an individual event.Sumariwalla expressed his belief that people often place excessive emphasis on medals, a perspective he personally disagrees with.

settles issue with monstrous second throw in final

PARIS: It was hot and humid at the Stade de France on Thursday night. The air was still, and heavy with anticipation. Not the best of conditions for an athlete to give his best. But that would have been the last thing on Neeraj Chopra 's mind.He came here with the tag of the defending javelin throw champion. ""It gives you motivation. Helps you focus better on your performance."" Just two days ago, Chopra got his second-best throw ever at this arena, 89.94m, during the qualification. ""Don't go by this throw. Final alag cheez hai (final is a different thing),"" he had said.It was different. Very different. The Indian, who had topped the qualifications, started with a foul. So did Pakistan 's Arshad Nadeem, Neeraj's challenger and a friend on the circuit. But that was not a worry for these two sub-continental heroes.They went top of the chart on their second try. Nadeem set an Olympic record with a huge throw of 92.97m. It was a sensational throw, almost unbelievable. The javelin kept soaring and soaring before it fell to a huge roar in the stadium. The earlier record stood at 90.57m. He had just gone way, way ahead of the others.Neeraj managed 89.45m on his second try to be second on the list, 3.52m behind the Pakistani. He indicated with his right hand that it was not where he wanted to be at. There was a lot of catching up to do, for him and the others.Nadeem's third throw was around 88m. He looked satisfied as he pumped his fist. He knew he had done his best. Neeraj fouled his third throw. It was a weak one anyway. The Indian usually gets his best throws on his initial tries. Three gone. So, could he improve now? Had Nadeem's throw put extra pressure on him?The other challengers - Anderson Peters of Grenada, Jakub Vadlejch of Czech Republic, Keshorn Walcott of Trinidad and Tobago and Germany's Julien Weber - were just behind Neeraj after four attempts. In the third spot was Vadlejch with 88.5m.The script could still change. The gold looked to have been secured by the Pakistani in his safe vault. The competition was in his pocket. It was about the other two medals.Neeraj fouled his fourth and fifth throws too. Out of five attempts, he had managed just one valid throw. It was very uncharacteristic. He was still second on the list, but there was a throw left and he could be upstaged.At this stage, it was Pakistan gold, India silver. Not many would have predicted this before the event. Nadeem is a World Championship silver medallist and has crossed the 90m-mark often in his career. He had chosen this venue, this stage to get a throw he would have often dreamed about.Neeraj fouled his sixth and final throw too. He raised his hands to thank the crowd. Nadeem then went for his final throw. It again went like the first one, just short at 91.79m. He then went down on his knees to thank God.Chopra was looking to become the fifth athlete in the history of the Games to defend the men's javelin throw Olympic title. He failed to do that but with the silver here, he has gone a step ahead of other Indian Olympians.","Neeraj Chopra fails to defend men's javelin throw Olympic title.

However, Harmanpreet (30th, 33rd minutes) responded by converting two penalty corners, securing the win for India.The Indian team demonstrated their resilience and fortitude, securing yet another podium position at the pinnacle of global sports competitions.

There were not a lot of runs scored down the ground. They did not use the feet as much as we expected. It was about using sweeps and piercing that deep square leg and midwicket field. That is something we failed to do as a batting unit. We did not play enough sweeps, reverse sweeps, or paddle sweeps, and used our feet too much. That was the difference,"" said Rohit.""If you look at Kusal Mendis and Avishka Fernando today [who put on an 82-run stand], they got a lot of runs square of the wicket. They were using the turn, and sweeping, making the fielder move left and right. They were smart with how they batted and we were not,"" he added.The Indian captain acknowledged that the Men in Blue were under siege from Lankan spinners rather than dominating against them. Additionally, he stated that players are allowed to devise their own strategies for overcoming spin and playing on turning tracks.""It starts with your training, When you get to your sessions, I can see the guys are working hard in the nets whenever we get the opportunity to train as well. I do not see there being a lack of effort when we want to try and play different shots,"" he added.According to Rohit, it's crucial to score as many runs as you can during the first ten overs of the powerplay because these pitches slow down later on.""My personal effort was to ensure that I score as many runs as I could.

We knew playing in Premadasa, if there's a little bit of turn, we can take advantage because we have good spinners,"" Theekshana stated.Theekshana's comments shed light on the strategic differences that played a crucial role in the series outcome.

In contrast, Sri Lanka's batsmen, familiar with such conditions from domestic cricket, navigated the challenges effectively.""Even in domestic, the wickets are like this and our batters know how to play,"" Theekshana added, crediting the team's batting performance to their experience on similar pitches.The series win was a significant morale boost for Sri Lanka, especially after their 3-0 defeat in the preceding T20 series.""For me, it's a confidence-booster as a team. We lost the T20 series 3-0. The whole team was disappointed and we took it as motivation. Very happy to play the last game and win the series after 1997. It's a huge victory for us and I am really proud to be part of the XI,"" Theekshana expressed.The third ODI saw Sri Lanka's bowlers dominate from the start.""When we were batting first, we thought the wicket would be much better than the first two matches. We had to bowl more good deliveries than the last couple of matches.

""We need to think which players could play on these kind of tracks but you also need to give consistent chances as it's not easy to perform in one or two chances.It was a bad series and we need to accept it,"" Rohit remarked after the defeat.While acknowledging the challenging nature of the pitches, Sharma stressed the importance of individual accountability and adaptability.""We have to accept where all we made mistakes. We couldn't show more intent and aggression against spinners, and they put pressure relentlessly on us. It's about individual plans. We have had these issues in the past as well where the ball has spun a little bit.

We will let players know this is what we want and if we have to be different in terms of choosing personnel, we will do that,"" he added.Sharma's assessment was devoid of excuses, reflecting a pragmatic approach to addressing the team's shortcomings, acknowledging, ""I don't think we were brave enough throughout the entire series and hence we lagged behind throughout.

The result also highlighted the challenges faced by the Indian team on turning tracks, as acknowledged by Maheesh Theekshana in his post-match comments.""We knew they are used to small grounds and good wickets in India.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan cricket team has opted to retain senior players Babar Azam , Mohammad Rizwan , and Shaheen Shah Afridi in the Test squad for the upcoming two-match series against Bangladesh, despite earlier plans for a significant overhaul following a disappointing T20 World Cup performance. The adjustments in the squad were influenced by the advice of foreign head coaches Jason Gillispie and Gary Kirsten as per PTI report.In June's T20 World Cup, Pakistan was eliminated in the opening round after losses to the USA and India. Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) chairman Mohsin Naqvi had indicated a need for a ""major surgery"" in the team.There were subsequent reports of player misconduct during the tournament. Nonetheless, the PCB chose not to take any drastic measures against the players, moving past the World Cup debacle.The PCB has maintained Shan Masood as the captain for the red-ball format, with Saud Shakeel promoted to vice-captain, replacing Shaheen Shah Afridi, who was the vice-captain for the previous Test tour of Australia. The squad includes two uncapped players, Mohammad Huraira and Kamran Ghulam.Kamran Ghulam, who was previously included in the Test squad but did not make his debut, has been recalled. Pacer Mohammad Ali, after playing only two Tests against England in 2022, has also been selected again. Most of the squad for Pakistan's opening Test series of the 2024-25 season remains consistent with the 13 players involved in the last series against Australia at the end of 2023-24.Selectors rewarded Mohammad Huraira, Kamran Ghulam, and Mohammad Ali for their consistent performances in domestic cricket and for Pakistan Shaheens. Naseem Shah returns to the red-ball format following his recovery from injury.Players dropped from the previous Test series include opener Imam ul Haq, spinners Noman Ali, Muhammad Nawaz, and Sajid Khan, all-rounder Faheem Ashraf, and pacer Hasan Ali.

Virat Kohli , Shreyas Iyer , Shubman Gill and KL Rahul had fairly long batting sessions. Neither Mohammed Siraj nor Arshdeep Singh bowled.Ryan ten Doeschate adds, ""We're trying to be very specific and learn from the mistakes in the first couple of games since the conditions have been very tough, guys have come up with their own plans and how they want to go about it. It's more of a mental point of view, they're all fantastic players of spin, that's not likely to be an issue. We're trying to just form an environment where the guys feel positive where they can really express themselves and go out to show how good they are. I think it's admirable how the guys one-up with themselves under pressure. They feel that we'll at least share the series with Sri Lanka. And the preparation has been made around that we can be our best.""With the second match ending in a loss, India now has the choice of fielding their strongest XI or experimenting ahead of the next major ICC tournament, which takes place in just six months.Abhishek Nayar concludes, ""I think as Indians we are emotional people and normally when sometimes you don't get results our way, there is a lot of passion and integrity at stake for every individual so every cricketer in that dressing room knows what's at stake and a lot of time that sort of brings the best out of the team and it bring out that fighting spirit that you want to often see in our team, then you obviously try to implement that in the centre with all the strategies that you come with, all the discussions that we have in the dressing room, sometimes, being pushed against the wall brings the best out of us.""A loss would come as a shock to the recently recruited Gautam Gambhir-led coaching staff, who took over a team that had played some of the best ODI cricket in India less than a year ago.

Rohit Sharma, the Indian skipper, has been in excellent form throughout the series, looking comfortable at the crease while other Indian batters have struggled. His current form and momentum make him one of the safest picks for fantasy contests.

On the other hand, Kuldeep Yadav, the Indian left-arm wrist-spinner, has not been at his best in the series. However, given the nature of the wicket, he has the potential to emerge as one of the highest point earners in this game.

For Sri Lanka, young all-rounder Dunith Wellalage has been impressive with both bat and ball in the series. His current rhythm in both departments makes him one of the top picks for the game.

Additionally, Jeffrey Vandersay, the Sri Lankan skipper, had a remarkable performance in the last ODI, dismissing six Indian batters. With his current form, he can be a valuable asset in fantasy contests.

NEW DELHI: The Indian batsmen, especially Virat Kohli , will need to strategically handle the spin challenge in the third and final ODI on Wednesday to prevent their first series loss to Sri Lanka in 27 years.This is not the ideal start for Gautam Gambhir in his debut ODI assignment as the team's head coach.India's last bilateral ODI series defeat against Sri Lanka was in 1997 when Arjuna Ranatunga's team inflicted a 0-3 defeat on Sachin Tendulkar's side.Since then, India has won all 11 bilateral ODI series against Sri Lanka, both at home and away.India cannot win the current series after losing the second ODI by 32 runs and tying the first match. The batsmen's indecisiveness on the spin-friendly RPSC pitch has put the team in this uncomfortable position.Kohli's struggles have been the most evident, scoring only 38 runs in two matches. More concerning than the number of runs is the manner of his dismissals, falling to the leg-spin of Wanindu Hasaranga and Jeffrey Vandersay. Kohli appeared subdued and failed to capitalise on the strong starts provided by Rohit Sharma .A confident and in-form Kohli is crucial for India's success in the middle overs, whether chasing or setting a target. However, his struggles reflect the overall difficulties faced by the Indian batting unit.Shivam Dube, the designated spin-hitter, failed to read a straightforward leg-break from Vandersay in the second ODI. Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul, known for their prowess against spinners, have struggled with their footwork and wrist play against the Lankan slow bowlers.The Indian batsmen need to learn from Rohit's approach, particularly his confidence and planning, to effectively rotate the strike and keep the spinners at bay on the Premadasa pitches. Rohit's exceptional batting against both pace and spin has been a standout performance in the series.India (IND) and Sri Lanka (SL) are set to face off in the third and final ODI of their three-match series at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on August 7 at 2:30 PM IST.The two teams have a long history of playing against each other, with India holding the upper hand in their head-to-head record. Out of the 170 ODI matches played between the two sides, India has emerged victorious in 99 games, while Sri Lanka has managed to win 58 times.The pitch at the R. Premadasa Stadium has been a typical Sri Lankan wicket, offering slow and challenging conditions for the batters. The best time to score runs on this surface is when the ball is new and hard, as it comes onto the bat nicely. However, as the match progresses, the ball tends to slow down and starts to turn, making it difficult for the batters to score freely.Considering the pitch conditions, top-order batters from both teams have the best chance of scoring well and earning fantasy points. While the new ball bowlers might not get much assistance from the wicket, spinners from both sides could prove to be valuable assets in fantasy XIs.Rohit Sharma (C), Ꮪhubman Gill (VC), Virat Kohli, KL Rahul (WK), Rishabh Pant (WK), Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohd.

Mohun Bagan hit Air Force for a sixer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/mohun-bagan-hit-air-force-for-a-sixer/articleshow/112384077.cms,"KOLKATA: In a major boost before the Kolkata Derby, Mohun Bagan Super Giant thrashed Indian Air Force FT 6-0 to go on top of Group 'A' in Durand Cup at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. While both Bagan and their arch-rivals East Bengal FC have the same number of points (six), the former took the pole position by virtue of a better goal difference.It will thus boil down to the upcoming derby clash on August 18 to decide which team will end up as the group toppers and progress to the knockout stage. However, with Thursday's big victory, Bagan will hold the edge as a draw will see them making the quarters.It was one-way traffic as Bagan's Jason Cummings scored a brace - one in each half - and Thomas Aldred, Greg Stewart, Anirudh Thapa and Liston Colaco netted the other goals for the Kolkata giants.Head coach Jose Molina returned to the sideline as Mohun Bagan fielded their star players for the game with only Suhail Bhatt, Thomas Aldred and Abhishek Suryavanshi keeping their place from the last game.Bagan meant business right from the word go as they went ahead in the fourth minute. Sahal Abdul Samad put Cummings through inside the box and the Aussie striker put it past the rival goalkeeper easily. Aldred doubled the lead within six minutes. Suhail Bhatt's header from a Liston Colaco free-kick was saved by goalkeeper Subhajit Basu, but the rebound fell in the path of Aldred who smashed the ball in.
