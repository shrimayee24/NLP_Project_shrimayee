NEW DELHI: Afghanistan secured a spot in the Super Eight phase of the 2024 T20 World Cup with a seven-wicket victory over Papua New Guinea, knocking New Zealand out of the competition. Fazalhaq Farooqi led Afghanistan’s bowling, taking three wickets and contributing to PNG’s total of 95.Despite early losses, Afghanistan chased down the target in 15.1 overs, finishing at 101-3. Gulbadin Naib, unbeaten on 49, and Mohammad Nabi, with 16 not out, anchored the chase. This win, Afghanistan’s third in a row, guarantees their place alongside hosts West Indies in the next round. Farooqi’s performance brought his tournament wicket tally to 12, four more than his closest rivals, showcasing Afghanistan’s growing prowess in T20 cricket.As the group stage of the tournament edges towards its climax, numerous teams have solidified their positions in the Super Eight.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan cricket team has become a centre of criticism since their humiliating first-round exit from the T20 World Cup . The 2009 champions were eliminated following the abandonment of the USA-Ireland match due to rain.The team endured a startling loss against tournament debutants USA and subsequently fell short against arch-rivals India. Pakistan's sole triumph came in their encounter with Canada.Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram , who has been a staunch critic of Pakistan's poor performances in the past, didn't hesitate to express his disappointment and even took a jab at his own team.On the official Instagram account of the ICC, Akram responded to the news of USA qualifying for the Super Eight stage. While he extended his congratulations to Monank Patel's team, Akram also had a blunt message for the Pakistani side, led by Babar Azam .""Congratulations to the USA, They've done amazingly well. When you talk about globalization of the game, this is it. USA qualified for the Super Eight, they deserve to be there. They defeated Pakistan, in their group match. For Pakistan, what's the plan? EK 601 (flight number) to Dubai, to their respective cities. From then, we will see what happens,"" said Akram.Earlier, Akram also blamed biased selection for Pakistan's below-par performances in the T20 World Cup.""Pakistani players think that if they don't perform well, the coaches will be sacked, and nothing will happen to them,"" Akram said during a broadcast after the defeat to India.""It is time to keep the coaches and change the entire team.""Former player Kamran Akmal said Shadab Khan was chosen to play because he is close to captain Babar Azam, and that meant leaving out leg-spinner Usama Mir, the top wicket-taker in this year's Pakistan Super League.""When you select players based on friendship, you'll get these results,"" Akmal told AFP. ""Mir should have been in the squad... That was a big injustice.""",Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram takes a jab at his own team.

NEW DELHI: As the initial group stage of the T20 World Cup approaches its end, two spots remain open for the 'Super 8s' round. Defending champions England and Bangladesh are currently the frontrunners to join the six already qualified teams.The tournament has seen notable exits, with Pakistan, New Zealand, and Sri Lanka already eliminated.Currently, India leads Group A, Australia tops Group B, Afghanistan holds the number one spot in Group C, and South Africa is the frontrunner in Group D.The one remaining spot on offer in Group B is being contested between neighbours England and Scotland. England's first game in the group was washed out against Scotland, and they lost the next to traditional rivals Australia. England's comprehensive victory over Oman in 19 balls has improved their chances immensely, but they still need to beat Namibia and hope the Scots don't upset Australia.England are currently in third position with three points from their three games and a net run rate of +3.081. They need to win their last match in the group stage to secure five points. That will bring them on equal points with Scotland (5 each) if the Scots lose their concluding group game against Australia, which is likely. In that eventually, England, who already have a better net run rate than Scotland, will go through.With England's qualification still not confirmed, Australia fast bowler Josh Hazlewood said, ""In this tournament, you potentially come up against England at some stage again, and they're probably one of the top few teams on their day. We've had some real struggles against them in T20 cricket, so if we can get them out of the tournament, that's in our best interest as well as probably everyone else's. It'll be interesting to see. We've never really been in this position before as a team.""Hazlewood has no doubt that Australia will aim for a clean sweep in the group by defeating Scotland, but there is also the temptation to assist Scotland in maintaining their net run rate over England. ""There are a few options, like getting close and just knocking it around to drag it out,"" Hazlewood added.As of June 14, six teams have secured their spots in the T20 World Cup Super 8s stage. India, USA, Australia, Afghanistan, West Indies, and South Africa have all advanced to the next round. Among these, only the USA has suffered a defeat in their group matches, with all other teams remaining undefeated.An exciting match is on the horizon when Afghanistan take on co-hosts West Indies in Group C. The result in this match will end the unbeaten run of one of these two teams before entering the 'Super 8s'.Group 1: A1 (India), B2 (Australia), C1 (New Zealand), D2 (Sri Lanka)Group 2: A2 (Pakistan), B1 (England), C2 (West Indies), D1 (South Africa)The USA will now play as A2 after Pakistan's elimination from the T20 World Cup 2024.Meanwhile, Afghanistan will take the C1 spot following New Zealand's exit from the tournament.Bangladesh are emerging as a strong contender for the D2 position, potentially replacing Sri Lanka, which has also been knocked out.On the other hand, if Scotland manage to upset Australia, they will take England's spot as B1. If Scotland fail to win against Australia, the decision will come down to net run rate.","England and Bangladesh are currently the frontrunners to join the six already qualified teams. Pakistan, New Zealand, and Sri Lanka already eliminated. India leads Group A, Australia tops Group B, Afghanistan holds the number one spot in Group C, and South Africa is the frontrunner in Group D.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110991865,imgsize-74408,width-400,resizemode-4/110991865.jpg"

T20 World Cup: 'Petrol nahi tha': Navjot Singh Sidhu reveals super-sopper conked off during USA vs Ireland washout in Florida because it ran out of petrol,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/petrol-nahi-tha-navjot-singh-sidhu-reveals-super-sopper-conked-off-during-usa-vs-ireland-washout-in-florida-because-it-ran-out-of-petrol/articleshow/111031355.cms,"NEW DELHI: Florida 's unpredictable weather has been a significant concern for teams and players in the T20 World Cup over the past few days. Continuous rain has led to numerous ground inspections and ultimately resulted in back-to-back washouts.The unfavourable weather has brought bad luck for the Pakistan team, while the ICC has faced criticism for lack of facilities at venues in the US and the preparedness to tackle inclement weather, especially when it was known that the flood-hit Florida will face such situations.SEE ALSO: T20 WORLD CUP 2024 Schedule The washed-out USA vs Ireland game in Lauderhill was an important Group A fixture that ended without a ball being bowled due to the wet outfield. The India vs Canada match at the same venue the following day met the same fate.Voicing his frustration, former India opener Navjot Singh Sidhu emphasized that the International Cricket Council (ICC) should ensure that the outcomes of matches are determined by the teams' skills rather than weather conditions.In a Star Sports video on social media platform 'X', Sidhu expressed his discontent, stating, ""There is a lot of room for improvement. The ICC should not let the weather dictate conditions; it should be based on the teams' abilities. Yesterday, the super sopper conked off because 'petrol nahi tha' (it didn't have petrol ), and the entire ground isn't covered.""Sidhu further highlighted the disparity between cricket and other sports, saying, ""When you play basketball or rugby, the stadiums are fully covered. This is a great country with enough resources, so it's essential to ensure that the teams' abilities are fairly assessed. If strong teams fall behind due to rain, it takes the sting out of the tournament.""The washout had a particularly harsh impact on Pakistan, who, after losing group matches to the USA and India earlier, had their chances of advancing in the tournament hanging by a thread. A win against Canada provided a glimmer of hope, but the rain-abandoned match between USA and Ireland ultimately dashed their chances of progressing in the tournament.Pakistan's inconsequential last group match against Ireland is also scheduled to be held at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground in Lauderhill, Florida, as the city reels under flood-like conditions.","Navjot Singh Sidhu says ICC should not let the weather dictate conditions.

MIAMI: When Imad Wasim lost his way to the press-conference room at Broward Park, it was, in a way, metaphorical. That's exactly how his team Pakistan went about in this World Cup - losing two matches against the United States and India, both from winning positions.A win against Canada was not enough and even before they play Ireland at Broward Park here, their fate had been sealed.""It's definitely the lowest point for Pakistan in my career,"" Imad, who has been playing for the country for quite a decade now, said.The allrounder, who has played under quite a few coaches and has experienced the fluctuating fortunes of the nation on the field, feels that in Pakistan, a change of personnel won't really make for a big change.""It has to be the mindset. We have to change the mindset. We are playing our cricket , we cannot be scared to lose all the time. The game is changing and we will have to deal with it. As far as I am concerned, playing fire with fire is the way to go,"" Imad said, looking extremely disappointed.Constant questions kept coming up about what exactly went wrong, but the player, who had come back from retirement to play this tournament, didn't want to single out anybody for the early exit.""When a team wins, it is a collective effort. When the team loses, it is also a collective effort. There is no point blaming one person for the debacle,"" Imad said.Pakistan have been on a downward curve for a while now. While they had crashed out of the ODI World Cup in India a few months ago after losing to Afghanistan, the defeat to USA here was definitely one bitter pill to swallow. ""Yes, you can say that the loss to the USA was unacceptable. We should not have lost,"" Imad, who missed that game due to an injury, said.But the discussions seemed to surround more on the defeat to India, a game which Pakistan controlled for most parts, only to lose in the last five overs. Imad, too, was held responsible for the defeat, because he could not translate his form in franchise cricket and failed to get big runs off Axar Patel in the 16th over.""Yes, I am sorry I couldn't do it. They bowled really well as well, but it's true that we should have won that game,"" the 35-year-old said.","Imad Wasim says Pakistan's World Cup exit is the lowest point in his career.

All-rounder Imad Wasim isn't shying away from admitting that the Pakistan team was at fault and committed mistakes that led to a sorry group-stage exit at the ongoing T20 World Cup , but he urged the fans and media to understand that the players too are humans.The washed-out Group A match between co-hosts USA and Ireland in Florida put Pakistan out of the race to 'Super 8s' and helped tournament debutants USA to make a historic entry into the next stage of the showpiece T20 event.In effect, however, it's the US team that knocked out Pakistan with their upset win over Babar Azam & Co in their campaign opener.It followed the match against archrivals India, where Pakistan let a win slip out of their hands and lost by six runs. Ever since that game, the team has been lambasted by Pakistan media, former players and on social media.""A bad thing has happened, but who knows it might be a blessing in disguise. It (the T20 World Cup flop) should be revisited...(we need to) play white-ball cricket the way it should be played,"" said Imad while addressing the media in the US.Talking in context of the heavyset wicketkeeper-batsman Azam Khan, the allrounder said that he has never body-shamed anyone and never talked about individuals.""As far as you said about me being an analyst as well, I have always talked only about cricket,"" said Imad. ""I haven't talked about individuals, neither have I body-shamed anyone nor talked personally about that person. A cricketer's job is to analyse cricket and to tell you whatever is going wrong and whatever is going right...""""It happens during group stages, there are other teams who have been eliminated...There is a lot of disappointment. We are disappointed more than you guys because this is our profession...It's all about how you get up and approach the world after falling, how do you react,"" he added.Concluding his reply to a journalist's question, Imad, who was alleged to be playing the tournament with an injury, requested everyone to not take out the human element while doing a post-mortem of the team's performance.""We want to tell the Pakistan public that we couldn't perform, and we are the ones to be blamed. Ek baat ye bhi kehna chahunga.

INDIA-CANADA GAME CALLED OFF DUE TO WET OUTFIELD

MIAMI: Hardik Pandya has endured a lot in recent times. It all started with an injury in the ODI World Cup which cost him his T20 captaincy. That was followed by a disastrous million-dollar move to Mumbai Indians which led to internal rift in the team and reportedly, some not-too-happy vibes with Rohit Sharma .The horrible show in the IPL by the five-time champions didn't help. Hardik's own performances were poor as well. His personal life, too, allegedly went for a toss. Question marks were raised about his inclusion in the team for the T20 World Cup. The BCCI , however, kept the faith in the star allrounder and now, slowly, Hardik is finding his mojo just when it matters the most.In the three World Cup games so far, Pandya has registered figures of 2-24, 3-27 and 2-14, albeit all in extremely favourable conditions.However, he has shown the happy knack of bowling the difficult overs, the 17th against Pakistan being a case in point.Team India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey was particularly happy with the way Hardik kept trying even when the chips were down.""I'm definitely sure about one thing, he has confidence in his ability. Sometimes there's no rhythm in a tournament (IPL), sometimes, even if you try, the rhythm doesn't come, it takes time…that was a phase where the rhythm didn't come,"" Mhambrey said.While Hardik did his bit to get his rhythm back, there's somebody else who also deserves a bit of credit - his captain Rohit. His personal differences with Hardik following the batter's ouster as MI captain has been speculated on every platform, but when it came to choosing the Indian team, Rohit kept all that aside.He knew four allrounders would be his best bet in the World Cup, and for that he needed Hardik to deliver.""Four allrounders allow me the flexibility and in all probability, we are going to stick to that,"" Rohit had said before India's game against Pakistan.Hardik, too, knew this could be his last chance, and that pushed him to go 100 % in every training session, a fact lauded by Mhambrey. ""It would have been worrisome if he hadn't put in the hard work. But we noticed that despite the difficult times, his work ethic never took a beating. He kept bowling a lot and that meant the rhythm would return, especially when he understands his own bowling so well,"" Mhambrey said.Despite going for runs in IPL, Hardik tried bowling difficult overs, even after being taken apart quite brutally by MS Dhoni . But as Mhambrey pointed out, it was the confidence in his own ability that stood the allrounder in good stead. ""If you compare his rhythm in the IPL and the rhythm now, you can see he has got it back,"" Mhambrey added.Once the bowling bit is sorted, Hardik needs to score a few runs with the bat as well.India are now moving to the West Indies, where the conditions will be more favourable for the batters compared to the United States. All the team needs from him is a couple of cameos over the next five games and Hardik could well become one of the heroes of this World Cup.The crowds had come in, the enthusiasm was there, but the rains that south Florida had endured over the last few days was good enough for India's last group game against Canada to be called off at Broward Park.It didn't rain on Saturday, but the Friday afternoon downpour that had washed out USA's game against Ireland had damaged the outfield so much that India's game couldn't be started despite the best efforts of the groundsmen. India finished on top in Group A. They will now face Afghanistan in the Super-8 stage in Barbados on June 20.",Troubled seam-bowling allrounder seems to have laid all controversies to rest.

India's T20 World Cup match against Canada abandoned due to wet outfield,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/indias-t20-world-cup-match-against-canada-abandoned-due-to-wet-outfield/articleshow/111025366.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's plans to further fine-tune their Super Eight preparations were disrupted by the adverse weather, which washed out their match against Canada on Saturday. Despite this, they head to the Caribbean brimming with confidence after a strong performance in the T20 World Cup group stages.The final Group A game between India and Canada was called off without a single ball bowled due to wet conditions on the field. Both teams received one point each, with India topping Group A with seven points. The USA, with five points, also advanced, while Canada finished third with three points.A significant confidence boost for India comes from the impressive performance of their fast bowlers in the group matches. Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, Hardik Pandya, and Mohammed Siraj collectively took 20 wickets.They had the advantage of a challenging, double-paced drop-in pitch at the Nassau County stadium. However, they will have more traditional surfaces in the West Indies for the rest of the tournament.Nevertheless, if their performances in New York are any indication, their opponents have plenty to worry about. The Indian pacers displayed technical skill and a deep understanding of the conditions, effectively capitalizing on what was available.Arshdeep Singh particularly stood out. His delivery to trap USA’s Shayan Jahangir with a ball swinging in from over the wicket and a short-pitched ball that troubled Andries Gous showcased his adaptability and skill.These deliveries could potentially get wickets on any pitch, highlighting Arshdeep's prowess.Another positive sign for India is the form shown by their key batsmen, including skipper Rohit Sharma, Rishabh Pant, and Suryakumar Yadav. Both Rohit and Suryakumar had a subdued IPL 2024 campaign but showed glimpses of their potential here, which they hope to build on in the Super Eight.In contrast, Rishabh Pant had a good run in the IPL, and many were keen to see how he would perform in a high-stakes environment. Pant exceeded expectations, showcasing his trademark stand-and-deliver flicks, innovative scoops, and one-handed smashes.Behind the wickets, Pant was equally impressive, displaying acrobatics with his dives, runs, and leaps to make catches and stops.Hardik Pandya, who was portrayed as a ""silent villain"" on social media during a lackluster IPL while leading the Mumbai Indians, seemed to find his rhythm in the World Cup. Although his batting hasn't peaked yet, his bowling was impactful, troubling batters with his pace and variations.However, not all aspects of the team are in perfect shape. The spinners, except for Axar Patel, received limited game time during the group stages due to the nature of the pitch.Axar bowled six overs across three matches, taking three wickets. Ravindra Jadeja bowled only three overs against Ireland and Pakistan, and did not bowl against the USA.Other spinners in the squad, Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal, will enter the Super Eight without having played in the group stages. They might have had some game time had the match against Canada taken place.This lack of game time for the spinners might pose a challenge as the pitches in the West Indies are expected to be more spinner-friendly progressively.However, this Indian squad has repeatedly shown their ability to handle pressure situations with ease. They will need to rely on this resilience as they compete in the Super Eight in the Caribbean.","The final Group A game between India and Canada was called off without a single ball bowled due to wet conditions on the field.

I see him as a Test and 50-over captain. In those two formats in which he excels as a player. In T20 cricket, his game is very good, a pure player, but he is not up there with the top 15 batters in the world in T20 cricket. I think there are better players than him up the order,"" Vaughan said on Cricbuzz""But I don't want them to change it (captain) again. You assume they got to have some consistency. There's no point changing once again. Even if he is not perfectly suited to captain in T20 cricket, I do think for this period, its worth him staying consistent because the last thing Pakistan need is a bit more kamikaze, swapping in and changing and overreacting. I think most Pakistan fans will be realistic with this team's performance. They have actually not got a great team, at the minute, on paper, its just not a very good team. Its down to the coaches, selectors and the system back in Pakistan to try and give those in power (captain and coaches) to choose a pool of players,"" he added.Pakistan are set to host Champions Trophy in 2025 and there are calls for a major shake-up in the team and the management.Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi -- who is also the country's interior minister -- recently said changes were imminent.""Pakistan team needs a major surgery,"" he told local media after the India defeat.""We must endeavour to make the Pakistani cricket team one of the best in the world.

The tournament has seen some surprises, including the defeat of top seed Jessica Pegula, which has opened up the draw significantly.""For me today it was just about trying my best to stay in the present moment. She has a great serve, my focus was just to get the ball back into the court on return,"" Andreescu said after the match.""Staying mentally tough was key today.""The match was punctuated by two lengthy rain breaks, causing both players to struggle with consistency in the early stages.

She solidified her lead with a love service game, taking advantage of multiple mistakes from Osaka.Andreescu then clinched the first set 6-4 in 40 minutes, using heavily sliced drop shots to disrupt Osaka's rhythm.However, Osaka made a strong comeback in the second set.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli 's recent run of single-digit scores in the ongoing T20 World Cup doesn't worry India's batting coach Vikram Rathour . The coach emphasized that Kohli has been performing exceptionally well in practice sessions and is more motivated than ever as the Super Eight approaches.Despite being the highest run-scorer in the IPL, Kohli has managed to score only 1, 4, and 0 in his recent matches against Ireland, Pakistan, and USA, respectively.When asked about Kohli's form in the post-match media conference after the game against Canada was washed out in Florida, Rathour had his response ready.""I love it when every time I come there is a question about Virat Kohli, whether he is doing well or not. No concern at all, no concern at all,"" Rathour said.""He (Kohli) has been batting superbly from the tournament that he came from (IPL). Couple of dismissals here, doesn't change anything, he is batting really well.""Rathour expressed confidence that India's top batter will deliver when it matters the most.""Actually, it's good that he is a little hungrier, he is really keen to do well and really switched on. It's a good space to be as a batsman, I think.""Looking forward to some good games and we've watched some good innings from him.""The batting coach sidestepped questions about the team's strategy of playing four all-rounders, including Shivam Dube and Axar Patel , suggesting flexibility based on conditions.""Again, we need to be a flexible team. We need to look at the conditions that are in front of us and be ready to deal with those. So as a team, we are going to be really flexible, I think.""We'll react to what (conditions) we get on the day. We have enough sources in our team to deal with any kind of conditions,"" Rathour explained.He acknowledged that some game time in Florida ahead of the Super Eights would have been beneficial.""But if the game had happened that would have really helped us. We were really looking forward to playing a game, to play a good game of cricket. There's always a concern when you play a game in conditions like this that some injury can happen.""You're already in Super 8 and that's the last thing (injury) you want to happen before you enter the serious part of the tournament.""Rathour noted that the tight schedule of the Super Eight, with little time between games, is not ideal but manageable.""Again, not ideal. It would have been great if we could have gotten a game today. But now this is what it is. So, we look forward to having a couple of good practice days in Barbados and getting into the game. So again, now the matches will happen simultaneously after one day.""So, as a team I think we are ready. We are used to this kind of schedule. We have done it in the past and I am sure we will do it really well this time as well.""He also commented on the issue of the ground in Florida not being fully covered, raising concerns to the ICC.""This question should be asked to the ICC people. I won't be able to answer that. I don't know the reason why it was not covered and why it didn't have enough covers to cover the whole ground.""If they would have covered it, definitely that would have helped. But now it's not there and this is what we've got.""Regarding the challenging New York drop-in strip, Rathour downplayed its impact on the team's performance.""It's good. You should be able to play on all types of wickets. We have the skills to play in all types of conditions and do well. So, we have got the difficult wickets.Hopefully, we will get good wickets in the tournament.""And if we get turning wickets, we have 4 spin options, we have enough fast bowlers as well. So, whichever conditions come, I think we are really equipped to deal with that,"" he added.","Vikram Rathour says Virat Kohli has been performing exceptionally well in practice sessions.

We gave them enough time to prove themselves and get ready for the international games.“I am really happy the way Arundhati played in the WPL during the last two seasons. Priya has also performed well in domestic cricket especially in ODI format. When they are back, our team gets quite balanced,” she added.Skipper Laura Wolvaardt said South Africa will have to play “positive and aggressive” cricket to overcome a formidable opponent like India in their own backyard.“India is quite a daunting place to come. I'm just sort of trying to prepare the group mentally for what to expect. But we are confident and our batters are licking their lips to get into that surface tomorrow.“Playing a brave, aggressive brand of cricket is what we need to do. The Indian girls are playing a very positive brand of cricket. I think we are definitely going to have to try and match that,” said Wolvaardt.The 25-year-old said SA have analysed the Indian batters closely and she hoped to execute their plans to the ‘T' during the series.“India have a lot of world-class batters, and just to really analyse their scoring areas and how we can possibly keep them quiet. And if we have those plans in place then hopefully, we're able to execute them,” she added.Wolvaardt said South Africa have prepared extensively to counter Indian spinners.“After the Sri Lanka series (at home) we got together for a few camps.

The latter then doubled the advantage just before halftime with a stunning curling effort from outside the box.Hungary managed to pull one back in the 66th minute when Barnabas Varga stooped low to head Dominik Szoboszlai's curling cross into the bottom corner.This sparked a desperate attempt to get back into the game, but the Swiss remained resolute and sealed the win when substitute Embolo took advantage of a mistake in stoppage time.Switzerland, aiming to reach the knockout stages in their sixth consecutive major tournament, displayed a polished performance. They were composed and well-organised in defence, and swift in attack, with Granit Xhaka orchestrating the play and Dan Ndoye causing constant problems for the Hungarian backline.Coach Murat Yakin's decision to recall Aebischer and Duah to the Switzerland side proved to be a masterstroke, as Aebischer played a pivotal role in several first-half attacks that exposed the weaknesses in the Hungarian defense.Hungary's start to their third consecutive Euros was underwhelming, especially considering their impressive run of 14 matches unbeaten that had only recently come to an end. They had the first opportunity of the game in the ninth minute when Attila Fiola squared the ball to Roland Sallai, who blasted his shot over the bar.The Hungarians, who reached the round of 16 in 2016 and were eliminated in the group stage of Euro 2020, improved in the second half and briefly rallied after scoring.However, the Swiss maintained their composure, with Xhaka and Ndoye creating good chances late on before Embolo calmly lifted the ball over the keeper to secure the third goal.",Switzerland beat Hungary 3-1 in their opening Euro 2024 qualifier in Cologne.

He further underlined that they have had open communication, shared meals, and aligned their ambitions for the team's success.""We are adults enough to clarify everything.

His impact was immediate, as he scored twice and provided an assist, highlighting his ability to influence the game's outcome.The first goal came as a result of a fortuitous mistake by the Guatemalan goalkeeper, who misplaced a pass directly to Messi, allowing the Argentine superstar to coolly slot the ball into an open net from 12 yards out.This early equalizer set the tone for Argentina's dominance.Messi's creative brilliance was on full display in the 38th minute when his incisive pass released Valentin Carboni into the penalty area, leading to a foul and a subsequent penalty kick, which Lautaro Martinez converted to give Argentina the lead.The second half witnessed Messi's continued influence as he orchestrated Argentina's third goal. Receiving a well-weighted pass from Enzo Fernandez , Messi expertly laid the ball off for Martinez, who scored his second of the night with a clinical finish.Capping off his impressive performance, Messi scored Argentina's fourth goal in the 77th minute. After a slick give-and-go with Angel di Maria, Messi deftly chipped the ball over the Guatemalan goalkeeper, showcasing his composure in front of goal.While Guatemala managed to take a surprise early lead through an own goal, their resistance was short-lived as Argentina's quality and Messi's individual brilliance proved too much to overcome.With Argentina preparing to face Canada in their group play opener next Thursday, Messi's display against Guatemala has undoubtedly instilled a sense of optimism and belief within the team and their supporters. With the legendary forward firing on all cylinders, Argentina's quest to defend their Copa America crown appears more formidable than ever.","Lionel Messi scored twice and provided an assist in Argentina's 4-1 win against Guatemala.

Scotland managed to get on the scoresheet in the 87th minute through Antonio Ruediger's deflected own goal, but it was merely a consolation in an otherwise one-sided affair.Germany's performance was a stark contrast to their recent struggles in major tournaments, where they had lost their opening matches at the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, as well as the previousEuropean Championship in 2021.The Germans' dominance was evident in their possession statistics and the ease with which they carved open the Scottish defence. Their clinical finishing and relentless attacking play left Scotland with no respite, as the visitors failed to register a single shot on or off target throughout the match.For Scotland, who were making their second consecutive appearance at the European Championship under coach Steve Clarke, the defeat was a harsh reality check. They now face an uphill battle to progress from the group stage for the first time in a major tournament, with their next match against Switzerland on Wednesday taking on added significance.Germany, on the other hand, will look to build on this impressive start when they face Hungary in their second Group A encounter on Wednesday.

Eight years ago I didn't even think I would play for India (at the Olympics) again. I missed Tokyo and I wasn't anywhere close to representing the country,"" Bopanna said on Thursday.The 44-year-old Karnataka lad will be pairing with Tamil Nadu's Sriram Balaji in Paris after the All India Tennis Association went along with Bopanna's choice of partner.Bopanna earned automatic qualification by virtue of his world No. 4 ranking -- the top 10 ranked players in men's and women's doubles are given direct acceptance and can choose a player ranked in the top-300 as their partner.Sumit Nagal, ranked 77 in singles as on Monday -- the ranking cut-off date for Olympics entries, is on the list of alternates.June 14 is the deadline for national federations to submit their nominations to the ITF, which will announce the final list on July 4.The tennis competition will be played at Roland Garros, where Bopanna had won the mixed doubles crown with Canada's Gabriela Dabrowski in 2017.He will be at his best in terms of form and mental space too, despite being the oldest player on the ATP Tour.""I have been playing very good tennis. Got into the top-10 in rankings and qualified for the Games, the only way I could do it. I have been able to do it twice (having done it in 2016 as well), really happy about it,"" he said.The past two editions when he competed in the quadrennial showpiece had been marred by controversies with AITA initially refusing to pair him with the partner of his choice before climbding down due to public backlash.This time, however, the selection committee headed by former Davis Cupper Nandan Bal, who had also nurtured Bopanna in his formative years, had respected his decision to pair with Balaji.""It is really great that AITA has supported me, and it is a very progressive way moving forward,"" the Bengaluru lad said.Looking ahead at the Paris Games, Bopanna said: ""I am feeling extremely positive, I have been playing some great tennis over the last 18 months and enjoying my time on court. And I want to be able to translate that positivity to my partner.""It is going to be a new experience, playing with someone who will be making his debut at the Olympics.""I played Balaji in his last match as well (in the third round of the French Open). He had a good match in Paris. The last time I played with him was in the Davis Cup in Bengaluru (against Uzbekistan in 2017).""Bopanna said that the good thing for Balaji would be that he would be playing the Olympics at a ""familiar"" venue but sought to play down expectations.""Balaji has an explosive game and has all the shots,"" he said before adding, ""Olympics will be a very different scenario. He had nothing to lose and played freely (during the French Open).""It is a great opportunity for him.

The decision was reached during a selection committee meeting, presided over by Nandan Bal, a former Davis Cup Captain.

Balachandran Manikkath, who is affiliated with Bopanna's Sports School in Bengaluru, will accompany the team as their coach, while Rebecca Van Orshaegen will serve as the physiotherapist.
