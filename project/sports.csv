NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli 's introduction to international cricket was characterized not only by his extraordinary talent but also by his fiery demeanor on the field. His fierce competitiveness, boldness, and refusal to back down from any confrontation—whether with opponents or spectators—quickly became defining traits.One of the most infamous incidents highlighting Virat's temperament occurred during India's 2012 tour of Australia, widely known as ""Virat's middle finger incident .""During the second Test in Sydney, while fielding near the boundary, Virat was repeatedly targeted by verbal abuse from a section of Australian fans.Aggravated by the continuous taunting, Virat responded by raising his middle finger toward the crowd.The gesture immediately caused controversy, drawing heavy criticism and substantial media attention.""I agree cricketers don't have to retaliate. What when the crowd says the worst things about your mother and sister. The worst I've heard,"" he had posted.The International Cricket Council (ICC) subsequently fined Virat 50% of his match fee for breaching the Code of Conduct, citing unsportsmanlike behavior.In an interview with Wisden, Virat opened up on the controversy and recalled how he pleaded with the match referee Ranjan Madugalle to not ban him.""Yeah, the one thing I remember most is when I'd had enough of the Australian crowd at Sydney and I just decided to flick a finger at them. 'I'm so cool'. The match referee called me to his room the next day and I'm like, ‘What's wrong?'. He said, ‘What happened at the boundary yesterday?'. I said, ‘Nothing, it was a bit of banter',"" Virat had said.""Then he threw the newspaper in front of me and there was this big image of me flicking on the front page and I said, ‘I'm so sorry, please don't ban me!',"" he added.Madugalle reportedly asked Kohli to admit to his guilt which he accepted and got away with 50 per cent deduction of his match fee. ""I got away with that one. He was a nice guy, he understood I was young and these things happen,"" Virat said.",Virat Kohli has opened up about his controversial middle finger incident.

'What he might be able to...': Kane Williamson on Joe Root breaking Sachin Tendulkar's Test records,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/what-he-might-be-able-to-kane-williamson-on-joe-root-breaking-sachin-tendulkars-test-records/articleshow/113160397.cms,"Talking about 'Fab 4', NZ star calls England batsman 'phenomenal'

GREATER NOIDA: It was first coined by the legendary Martin Crowe in one of his articles a decade back. The term 'Fab Four' was a collective expression for four of the best ""young Test batters"" - Virat Kohli Joe Root and Kane Williamson - of that time.The four have gone on to captivate the cricketing world with their exceptional skill and batting prowess in the last 10 years.Crowe had, in fact, drawn their comparison to The Beatles in his article.Interestingly, in the last decade, at varying time points, all four have also captained their respective sides in international cricket.As the four enter the final phase of their careers, the debate still rages on as to who is the best among them with the scales tilting towards all four of them at different points. Recently, Australian women's cricket team's wicketkeeper-batter Alyssa Healy ranked the four, and placed Williamson on the No. 1 spot, while consigning Kohli to fourth.In the last five years, Williamson and Root have been in sparkling form in Test cricket, while Smith and Kohli have struggled to even come close to their golden years in the red-ball format, which was between 2014-19.Root's recent twin hundreds against Sri Lanka at Lord's last week underscored his appetite for runs. Root's twin hundreds, in fact, are as many as Kohli's in the Test arena in the entire period from 2020-24.In this period, Root has 17 Test centuries to his name. While Williamson has 11 hundreds to his credit, the former New Zealand Test captain has played much less than Root in the period between 2020-24. Williamson's average in this period is 67.54.As Williamson himself continues to scale new heights, the affable New Zealander lauded Root for his ""consistent performances"" in Test cricket. Speaking before the one-off Test against Afghanistan here, Williamson said, ""I am a big fan of him (Root).""""He has been phenomenal. He has been something else for a long period of time. Obviously, there is a lot of attention on what he might be able to achieve in the years to come. It's just incredible that the kind of conversion (from fifties to hundreds) he has been able to achieve, can even be had,"" Williamson added, while referring to talks from the cricketing fraternity that Root is in a position to break Sachin Tendulkar 's Test record for most centuries as well as runs.Besides his high praise for Root, Williamson also applauded the other ""two members"" of Fab Four. ""I enjoy watching Virat Kohli, Steve Smith bat in Test cricket. It's just amazing how they have sort of moved the game forward in a big way,"" Williamson said.Williamson, however, downplayed the discussions about whether performances from Kohli, Smith and Root serve as a motivation for him to push harder. ""Not really! Playing for my country, for my team, makes me perform on the field,"" said the 34-year-old.New Zealand, the champions of the inaugural World Test Championship (WTC), will be playing six Tests in the next two months in the sub-continent. Following the one-off game against Afghanistan, New Zealand will travel to Sri Lanka for a two-Test series from September 16-30. Subsequently, they will return to India to face Rohit Sharma 's team in a three-Test series from October 16 to November 5.""In some ways, it's like a tournament sport, even though it's over a long period of time in the World Test Championship. Naturally, having six Test matches together is a big part of our calendar. It's one that we are very excited about,"" said Williamson.","'Fab Four' was a collective expression for four of the best ""young Test batters"" - Virat Kohli Joe Root and Kane Williamson.

First in 147 years of international cricket! Ollie Pope becomes only batter in the world to score...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/first-in-147-years-of-international-cricket-ollie-pope-becomes-only-batter-in-the-world-to-score-/articleshow/113142409.cms,"Top Picks For You 3rd Test: Ton-up Ollie Pope back in the runs as England make Sri Lanka struggle

Ollie Pope's seven centuries against seven opponents:

Pope's journey to these seven centuries began in January 2020 against South Africa, where he scored an unbeaten 135 while batting at No.6. This was the only century Pope made outside the No.3 position.

He waited two years for his next century, which came against New Zealand in Nottingham in January 2022, where he scored 145. This marked his first hundred while batting at No.3.

In December 2022, Pope scored his third Test century, a quick-fire 108 off 104 balls against Pakistan in Rawalpindi.

The fourth century came in June 2023, a majestic 205 off 208 balls against Ireland at Lord's, marking his first Test double hundred.

In January 2024, Pope played one of the best innings by a visiting batter on Indian soil, scoring 196 runs against India in Hyderabad.

Pope's sixth Test century was in July 2024, when he scored 121 runs against the West Indies in Nottingham.

With Friday's unbeaten 103 against Sri Lanka at The Oval, Pope completed his seven centuries against seven different Test-playing nations in six different venues. This achievement is a first in cricket history.

NEW DELHI: England 's stand-in captain Ollie Pope marked a significant milestone in Test cricket history on Friday. Playing his 49th Test match, Pope became the first cricketer to score his first seven Test centuries against different teams.Pope’s milestone century led England on the opening day of the third Test against Sri Lanka at The Oval, scoring an unbeaten 103 runs off 103 balls.This performance not only boosted England's score to 221/3 but also cemented his name in the history books.Ollie Pope's return to form was notable, especially considering his recent struggles. Before this match, he had only accumulated 30 runs in four innings since stepping in as captain for the injured Ben Stokes at the beginning of the series.Pope’s innings on Friday marked his first century as England captain. It was his 12th first-class hundred and his seventh in Test cricket. This feat is particularly impressive given the diversity of opponents he has faced.Australia, Bangladesh, Zimbabwe, and Afghanistan are the only Test-playing nations against whom Pope has not yet scored a century. With the exception of Australia, he has not faced these teams in his career to date.Ollie Pope's ability to notch centuries against such a diverse set of opponents reflects his adaptability and skill, securing his place as a noteworthy figure in the annals of Test cricket.",Ollie Pope becomes first cricketer to score first seven Test centuries against different teams.

Samoa Joe had quite the action-packed run at WWE NXT from 2015 to 2022. His three times NXT Championship win was anything but smooth-sailing. He finally lost the title to Shinsuke Nakamura , after two title defenses, and was let go by WWE two times in a single year.

When you're building a new brand and an imprint like we were in 'NXT,' you know a major thing is we want people to come to our live events.”Joe continued, “We were running live events around the nation, and if you knew if you showed up to an 'NXT' live event that a world title could change hands, I mean it just makes that event so much more exciting. So much more fan interactive, so much more better that you know, potentially on one night, any given Sunday, you could see something amazing happen.""His first title defense in June 2016 was successful after he took down his rival Bálor in a steel cage match at the NXT TakeOver: The End, effectively putting an end to the intense feud.

The NFL is known for touchdowns and tackles but in 2024 it may also be a fashion runway of sorts with some league stars showing off their style on the field, as well as away from it. These are more than just world record-breaking outfits—they're rule-breakers that drive headlines on and off Fashion Twitter. So, gather 'round as we browse the latest Madden NFL Fashion Hall of Fame inductees for 2024…where ""suiting up"" is about more than just a new three-piece.This guy is not a tight end by any means, he's a style MVP extraordinaire.With a penchant for bold red carpet suits and game-day getups that look as though they just stepped off the runway, Kelce mixes high-end labels with streetwear seamlessly. Whether he's wearing a designer suit or something custom, Kelce has made his post-game press conference the runway. When he can't catch passes, you know they are going to see the fits.While Stefon Diggs has been very sharp running routes in the field, here is what his fashion game looks like! A master of relaxed meets high-fashion aesthetic, Diggs gets a layering lesson by mixing casual and tailored suits. Even his accessories game is on point, showing that he doesn't just play with finesse – he dresses with it. Diggs is a first-round draft pick in style, regardless if he's heading into the stadium or to some fashion shoot.Not only does Christian McCaffrey run through defences — he's also running the fashion world too.

NEW DELHI: Cristiano Ronaldo , the iconic Portuguese forward, recently etched his name deeper into the annals of football history by scoring his 900th career goal during Portugal's UEFA Nations League match against Croatia.The 39-year-old’s goal, a tap-in volley from Nuno Mendes' cross, sealed a 2-0 lead, and eventually, Portugal triumphed 2-1. Ronaldo’s emotional reaction on the field, as he hit this incredible milestone, speaks volumes about the dedication, hard work, and excellence that have driven his illustrious career.With 900 goals across club and international football, Ronaldo has set a bar that seems almost untouchable.His tally includes 450 goals for Real Madrid , 145 for Manchester United, 101 for Juventus, 68 for his current club Al Nassr, 5 for Sporting Lisbon, and a stunning 131 for Portugal.However, some footballers are still in the race, albeit at a distant pace. Below are the top three footballers who are chasing Cristiano Ronaldo’s 900-goal mark .Lionel Messi, Ronaldo’s eternal rival, is closest to his 900-goal mark with 859 career goals to date. The Argentine forward's career has been nothing short of legendary, with countless records for both club and country.Messi has amassed 672 goals for Barcelona , 32 for Paris Saint-Germain, and now plays for Inter Miami in Major League Soccer. His international career with Argentina has been equally spectacular, with 103 goals, including helping Argentina lift the 2022 FIFA World Cup.At 37 years old, Messi continues to score regularly, especially in MLS, and his pursuit of Ronaldo's milestone adds yet another layer to their age-old rivalry.Polish striker Robert Lewandowski has been one of Europe’s most consistent goal-scorers over the last decade.With 635 career goals to his name, he ranks among the top in football history. Having played most of his club career with Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich, Lewandowski is now at Barcelona, where he continues to add to his tally.Known for his technical prowess and finishing ability, Lewandowski has also scored 81 international goals for Poland.At 36, while catching Ronaldo seems far-fetched, Lewandowski's legacy as one of the most clinical strikers is firmly established.Luis Suárez, the Uruguayan forward, has been an integral part of football's elite strikers over the past two decades.With 578 goals in his career, Suárez has left an indelible mark on every club he’s played for. His exploits for Liverpool, Barcelona, Atlético Madrid, and now Gremio have made him one of the most feared forwards of his generation. Suárez’s 68 international goals for Uruguay further underscore his reputation as a top performer.Though nearing the twilight of his career at 37, Suárez’s hunger for goals remains undiminished, and he could well climb the all-time rankings before hanging up his boots.Cristiano Ronaldo’s 900-goal achievement has set a monumental benchmark in the world of football. While Lionel Messi remains the closest contender to challenge Ronaldo’s record, other greats like Robert Lewandowski and Luis Suárez are making their way into football’s all-time top scorer lists.However, Ronaldo’s legacy as the first male footballer to cross the 900-goal mark will remain an awe-inspiring achievement, setting an almost insurmountable challenge for the next generation of players.","Cristiano Ronaldo recently scored his 900th career goal against Croatia.

They then shifted gears offensively in the middle quarters, building a 15-point lead by the start of the fourth period.Despite two of India's top performers fouling out in the final quarter, Lebanon mounted a spirited comeback, but their efforts were thwarted by a sensible play of 5-foot-9 point guard Ankush from Haryana. Ankush scored a game-high 14 points on 47.6-percent shooting to take control of the proceedings after India's tallest cager Mohammad Ishan and skipper Lavish left the court one after the other for committing five personal fouls.Before being fouled out, Ishan and Lavish played crucial roles in India's impressive performance in the second and third quarters, which ultimately propelled the team to a 55-40 lead at the start of the final period. Ishan recorded a double-double with 10 points and 12 rebounds, along with 4 assists, a steal, and 3 blocks, resulting in an efficiency rating of 21. Lavish contributed nine points and six assists. With timely baskets, Sahibjit Singh Bhullar and Mirthun Danasekar scored identical 10 points.The quarter-wise scores in India's favour read 16-16, 19-13, 18-11, 11-22. This two-point victory over the higher-ranked Lebanon also served as sweet revenge for India's 2016 quarterfinal defeat against their West Asian counterparts.India's American head coach Scott Flemming was a happy man. Speaking with TOI, Flemming said, ""This is a great win for India. I was pleased with how we competed. We struggled late with 2 of our top players fouled out. Overall, we outplayed a very good Lebanon team. Really happy for our players.""Explaining the strategy, Flemming added, ""Defensively, we wanted to protect the paint. Make them beat us from the perimeter. We needed to rebound with them. When we made our run, we executed that. Offensively, we wanted to push the ball but run our offences when they stopped our break. We needed more consistency, but overall we did what we needed to do to secure the win.""Though India were outrebounded by Lebanon 53-43, the 26.39% three-point shooting and 68.4% free throw conversion did the trick for the boys donning blue outfits. The quarterfinal will be the biggest test for India as they face the tournament's winningest nation, China, on Saturday.",India beat Lebanon 64-62 to confirm their last eight berth at the U-18 Asia Cup in Jordan. The boys in blue ended a six-year winless streak in the biennial tournament.

This was the seventh time in six matches that Mendis has passed 50, a run that includes three centuries.Sri Lanka had a stroke of luck when De Silva remained at the crease despite a mistake. He should have been out for 23 but Test debutant Josh Hull dropped a straightforward catch at mid-on. The ball went through Hull's hands after a miscue off spinner Shoaib Bashir.Earlier in the innings, an unfortunate mix-up cost Sri Lanka their first wicket. Dimuth Karunaratne was run out for nine due to Olly Stone's direct hit from short cover following Pathum Nissanka's ill-advised dash for a single. Nissanka went on to score an impressive fifty, highlighted by seven boundaries from 40 balls, but the middle-order wobbled soon after.Stone, returning for his second Test in three years, made a significant impact. The injury-prone paceman took the wicket of veteran all-rounder Angelo Mathews for just three runs, enforcing an edge to Pope in the gully in only his second game since the 190-run win at Lord's last week.Hull strikesHull's first Test wicket, removing a set Nissanka for 64, marked a significant moment in the third Test. England gained momentum, reducing Sri Lanka to 91-4 and subsequently 93-5 after Stone trapped Dinesh Chandimal lbw for zero.Kamindu Mendis, batting at No. 7, displayed composure during a precarious situation as dark clouds loomed.To counter potential bad light after tea, England deployed spinners from both ends, with Bashir and part-timer Dan Lawrence bowling in tandem. The tactic aimed to prevent the umpires from pausing the match.De Silva responded by late-cutting Lawrence for four to reach his half-century off 81 balls, while Kamindu Mendis reached his fifty in just 60 balls.Joe Root also bowled briefly with his occasional off-breaks before bad light halted play for the day.By then, Sri Lanka had added 69 runs without losing a wicket in 17 overs of all-spin bowling post-tea.Earlier in the day, England saw a collapse, losing six wickets for 35 runs after starting at 221-3. Pope, who resumed on 103 not out, had struggled in previous innings.The Sri Lankan pace attack, initially lacking precision, found their rhythm, with fast bowler Milan Rathnayake ending with figures of 3-56 from 13.1 overs.Left-arm quick Vishwa Fernando dismissed Pope, who scored 126 off 156 balls, including 19 fours and two sixes. Despite his dismissal, Pope's first-class average on his Surrey home ground remained above 84.England are aiming for a clean sweep -- their for the first since 2004.","Sri Lanka captain Dhananjaya de Silva and Kamindu Mendis form unbroken century partnership.

When legendary Lala Amarnath made the 12th man bat in inaugural Irani Cup match in 1960,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/a-masterstroke-or-madness-when-legendary-lala-amarnath-made-the-12th-man-bat-in-inaugural-irani-cup-match-in-1960/articleshow/113152613.cms,"In the annals of Indian cricket history , one of the most remarkable episodes involves the legendary Lala Amarnath and the first-ever Irani Cup match held way back in 1960.Lala, a cricketer known for his fierce determination and sharp mind, had long retired from active cricket by then, but his presence loomed large over the cricket scene in India as he was the chairman of the national selection committee.The Irani Cup, named after the late ZR Irani, was introduced to put the reigning Ranji Trophy champions against a Rest of India team . It was during this inaugural match that Lala’s audacious decision made headlines.The match was played at Delhi’s Karnail Singh stadium, also known as Railway stadium, from 18-20 March 1960.Lala, who had the distinction of scoring the first century for India in his debut Test, was leading the Rest of India team and cricketer Polly Umrigar was the captain of the Bombay team.In an extraordinary move that shocked everyone, Amarnath decided to send in a player who was not originally in the batting lineup — the 12th man .During the match, both Lala and the umpires disregarded the rules of cricket. When Lala sustained an injury, he instructedPrem Bhatia , who was designated as the 12th man for the Rest of India team, to bat in his place.The 12th man Bhatia was allowed to bat in both innings — at No. 9 in the first innings and at No. 3 in second innings — of the first Irani Cup. Bhatia scored 22 and 50 in the game.The incident remains a testament to Lala’s audacity but who would have known then that after many years later the International Cricket Council (ICC) would come up with a substitute rule where a player who was not originally named in the XI can come out to bat/bowl.Lala, a prominent figure in Indian cricket history, held the distinction of being the first Indian to lead the national team in ten consecutive Test matches. During his tenure as captain, which spanned 15 Tests, Amarnath achieved a significant milestone for Indian cricket.Under Amarnath's leadership, India secured their maiden Test victory against their arch-rivals, Pakistan. This groundbreaking match took place at the Feroz Shah Kotla ground in Delhi in October 1952.India's performance was nothing short of dominant, as they comprehensively defeated Pakistan by an innings and 70 runs, asserting their superiority on the cricket field.","Lala Amarnath was the chairman of the national selection committee.

Pant's brisk 61 from 47 balls (4x9, 6x2) highlighted the day.The lead seemed tenuous when pacers Khaleel Ahmed (2/56) and Akash Deep (2/36) reduced India B to 22 for three within the first eight overs, cutting the overall lead to 132 at that juncture.Skipper Abhimanyu Easwaran and first innings centurion Musheer Khan (0) were dismissed by Akash Deep, while Yashasvi Jaiswal fell to Ahmed, with all three catches secured by wicketkeeper Dhruv Jurel. At tea, India B was 33 for three.In this situation, Pant and Sarfaraz (46 off 36 balls, 7x4, 1x6) were expected to play with caution as the ball was moving considerately. However, both players defied the conditions and bowlers. Their partnership yielded 72 runs in just over nine overs, shifting the match's momentum towards India B.Sarfaraz targeted Akash Deep, hitting five consecutive fours, while Pant dealt effectively with Ahmed, producing a late cut and a cover punch for boundaries.Sarfaraz was dropped on 28 by Ahmed off his own bowling, but soon after, he lofted a six off the same bowler. Eventually, he was dismissed by Avesh Khan, edging a rising ball to Jurel behind the stumps.Pant continued his aggressive approach, reaching his fifty in just 34 balls. He transitioned from 43 to 49 with an overhead six off Kuldeep Yadav, then achieved the milestone with a single on the next delivery. His innings ended when he attempted a sweep off Tanush Kotian and offered a simple catch to substitute Kumar Kushagra.By this time, Pant had also demonstrated his capability as a wicketkeeper, reinforcing his position as the first-choice wicketkeeper batter for India's upcoming two-Test series against Bangladesh.Earlier, India A resumed their innings from 134 for two but were bundled out for 231. Pacers Navdeep Saini (3/60) and Mukesh Kumar (3/62) shared six wickets between them. KL Rahul (37) and Riyan Parag (30) aimed to bridge the gap with an 89-run partnership for the third wicket but struggled against robust bowling from both ends.Parag was caught down the leg side by Pant off Yash Dayal, and Rahul was bowled while attempting a sweep off Washington Sundar, reducing India A to 169 for five.They faced further setbacks as Shivam Dube's (20) aggressive outing was cut short by Mukesh Kumar, with his edge taken by Nitish Kumar Reddy at slips, leading India A to a wobbly 208 for seven by lunch.Kotian, contributing a 71-ball 32, tried to stabilize the innings. However, Sai Kishore induced an edge that was caught by Musheer at forward short leg, thus ending their resistance.At the close of play, India B maintains the upper hand, thanks largely to the aggressive and timely contributions from Pant and Sarfaraz that countered early setbacks by India A's pacers.","Rishabh Pant and Sarfaraz Khan lead India B to a substantial second innings total of 150 for six after facing persistent India A pacers.

Malappuram FC blank Forca Kochi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/malappuram-fc-blank-forca-kochi/articleshow/113156067.cms,"KOCHI: A cohesive Malappuram FC came to Kochi and conquered the home team in their den as they registered a 2-0 win over Forca Kochi FC in the opening match of Super League Kerala at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Kochi, on Saturday.Forca Kochi had an impressive array of stars in their line-up, which included Raphael Santos, Nijo Gilbert, Asif K, and Arjun Jayaraj, giving them a formidable side on paper.However, their performance on the pitch against Malappuram FC was below par. Led by the seasoned Anas Edathodika , Malappuram totally outplayed the home side, giving great joy to the fans who had travelled from Malappuram to support the district’s first professional football team. Pedro Manzi (3) and Faslurahman Methukayil (40) scored a goal each for the winners.Forca Kochi came into the opening match after a training camp of just two weeks, while Malappuram, under ISL-winning coach John Gregory, underwent a pre-season camp of a month and a half. The difference was evident on the pitch as Malappuram totally dictated terms right from the start.Capitalising on Forca Kochi FC's sluggishness, Malappuram needed just two minutes and 43 seconds to seize an early lead, setting the stage for a thrilling encounter. Spanish forward Pedro Manzi soared high to head home a precisely delivered cross from Malappuram's Nandu Krishna from the right wing, leaving Subhasish Chowdhary helpless in the Kochi goal.In the 40th minute, Malappuram extended their lead through Faslurahman. Gurjinder Kumar launched a long ball into the Kochi penalty area, which Manzi headed into Faslu's path. The 29-year-old forward slid onto the ball, deftly placing it beyond the goalkeeper's reach and into the back of the net.Despite a couple of attempts from Kerala Santosh Trophy captain Nijo Gilbert, Kochi's forwards were completely neutralised by Malappuram's resolute four-man defence. Brazilian midfielder Raphael Santos, who was once the favourite of ISL sides, was just a shadow of his former self, while Arjun Jayaraj was nowhere to be seen in the picture.Kochi's most promising scoring opportunity arose in the first minute of added-on time in the first half. Receiving a long ball from a free-kick, Tunisian midfielder Said Mohamed Nidhal attempted a header from a challenging angle. Although his effort was successfully thwarted by Malappuram goalkeeper Midhun V, the ball remained loose, falling to defender Dziri Omran.

Gokulam Kerala scale new heights at 11000ft,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/gokulam-kerala-scale-new-heights-at-11000ft/articleshow/113155298.cms,"LEH: Playing at 11,000 feet above sea level is not a mean feat. But Gokulam Kerala FC conquered the hurdles that came their way throughout the tournament as well as an experienced J&K Bank FC 4-0 in the final to lift the second edition of Climate Cup at Open Stadium here on Saturday.“It was a very difficult task playing here,” new Gokulam coach Antonio Rueda told TOI even as his victorious wards were very busy celebrating their achievement ahead of a new I-League season.“But the boys were impressive.”However, it was not even a closely-fought match unlike the semifinals when they had to struggle for a breakthrough in regulation and extra-time against a youthful 1 Ladakh FC team that gave their all even as the whole of Ladakh – at the venue or following the game online – hoped for a miracle.But on Saturday, the two-time I-League champions – in Ladakh with their first-team Indian players – showed their superiority as they controlled the summit clash from the word go. Player-of-the-tournament Mashoor Shereef found the net with a piledriver in the 23rd minute before an own goal by J&K Bank 11 minutes later took them to the break with a 2-0 lead.The script didn’t change after the change of ends as Thapuia earned them their third just a minute after restart and Vaseem Imamdar put one more into the net in the 87th minute as Gokulam sealed the game with a 4-0 margin for the hard-won trophy.“Playing here was difficult, but I think it is a good thing to win ahead of the pre-season,” said Mashoor. “This was a good experience and I hope we can carry it into the new season.”The dearth of oxygen makes it difficult for players unused to it to play their natural game for 90 minutes, something that the only Indian Super League team at the contest – NorthEast United FC – would vouch for.Coming to Ladakh with their U17 players and beaten by J&K Bank in the semifinals, NEUFC academy coach Suhel Nair, who coached them at Climate Cup, said, “Our boys are very young and enthusiastic and ran a lot more than they should have at this altitude. A couple of them also needed to be administered oxygen during or after the matches.”However, for 90% of them, it was the first time outside the northeast and was a great experience in a new terrain and interacting with a different culture,” he added.Indeed, the Climate Cup – with its wooden trophy in sync with the tournament’s ideology – did not just provide the most beautiful scenic backdrop to a football tournament in India but also brought teams from different parts of India, and Tibet, in contact with the hospitality of the Ladakhis and their unique culture.And the best example of that was witnessed after the presentation as Gokulam players danced with young Ladakhi boys and girls to the tunes of popular Indian songs as music and sports broke barriers and united people from two extreme ends of the country.","Gokulam Kerala FC beat J&K Bank FC 4-0 in the final of the Climate Cup.

NEW DELHI: Taylor Fritz has the opportunity to break a two-decade drought for American men's tennis when he faces world number one Jannik Sinner in the US Open final on Sunday.The 26-year-old believes his current form is ""good enough to win"" and end the 21-year wait for a male Grand Slam champion from the United States, with Andy Roddick being the last to achieve the feat at the US Open in 2003.Fritz's confidence is high, and he feels that his five-set semi-final victory over fellow American Frances Tiafoe on Friday, a match in which he was outplayed for significant periods, was a tougher test than the upcoming clash with Sinner.""I don't think that I'm going be put in a more stressful situation than I was against Frances,"" said Fritz, as quoted by AFP, the first American man in a Slam final since Roddick at Wimbledon in 2009.""I just feel good. I have a feeling I'm going to come out and play really well and win. When I play good tennis, I think that level is good enough to win.""Fritz, currently ranked 12th in the world, has taken full advantage of the unexpected early departures of Novak Djokovic , a four-time US Open champion, and Carlos Alcaraz, the 2022 winner. Their absence has created a significant opportunity for the remaining players in the tournament.Fritz secured his place in the semifinals by defeating Alexander Zverev, the fourth-ranked player and 2020 runner-up, in the quarter-finals.

He's like a very strong ball striker, but I feel like I always hit the ball really nice off his ball,"" explained the American, who had never got past the quarter-finals of a major before this US Open.Sinner claimed his first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January and, despite controversy surrounding two failed drugs tests, has advanced to his second Slam final of 2024.He boasts a flawless record in finals this year, winning all five, with titles in Rotterdam, Halle, Miami, and Cincinnati, alongside his Melbourne victory.At 23 years old, he has accumulated 54 wins and only five losses this season. He is excited about not only facing Fritz but also performing before a lively crowd of 23,000 at the vast Arthur Ashe Stadium.""Being in America for sure, the crowd will be a little bit more on his side,"" said Sinner.""But it's normal. It's like when I play in Italy, so I'm going to accept that.""I have my team and my people who are close to me. In my mind, I know that there are many people watching from home from Italy, and it's just take some support from them.”One concern for the Italian is the condition of his left wrist, which he injured while breaking a fall during his semi-final win against Britain's Jack Draper.Sinner needed a medical timeout to address the injury but quickly reassured that it won’t be a problem on Sunday.""The physio loosened it up very fast on court and it went away by playing, which is good,"" explained Sinner.""Let's see how it is tomorrow when it's cold. It's going to be a different feeling. Hopefully it's nothing to be concerned about. I'm quite relaxed, because if it's something bad, you feel it straightaway a bit more.""Win or lose on Sunday, Fritz believes American men's tennis is on the brink of a new golden age as the country boasts five players in the top 20.""I think it gives hope and shows that we're knocking on the door of winning a Slam,"" Fritz said.""We're all moving in the right direction.

I think this is just the start for all of us.""","Taylor Fritz faces world number one Jannik Sinner in the US Open final on Sunday.
