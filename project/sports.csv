"In Uttarakhand, rugby gives girls of farmer, labourer, hawker a ticket to freedom",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-uttarakhand-rugby-gives-girls-of-farmer-labourer-hawker-a-ticket-to-freedom/articleshow/117410698.cms,"The girls come from backgrounds where playing rugby is unimaginable. Their stories are inspiring young women to break free from conventions

‘Villagers mocked me for wearing shorts, said rugby isn’t for girls’

Assistant coach Anisha Khural says the story of these young girls will inspire other women to break free from conventions and join the game

DEHRADUN: Rugby wasn’t meant to find its way to the rugged lanes of rural Uttarakhand, where traditions are deeply rooted and opportunities, particularly for women, often fall through the crevasses. Yet, breaking barriers, young women from modest backgrounds are rewriting their destinies — with the grit needed for a scrum — to make a name for themselves in the hard sport.Shivani Pal, 21, from Roorkee’s Puhana village knows what it’s like to face resistance head-on. As the eldest of six siblings, she watched her dad ferry construction material on a bullock cart, a job that kept the family afloat but spared little to pursue dreams. Then rugby happened — her tryst with the game taking shape five years ago when she stumbled upon a Telugu movie, Sye.That odd pill-shaped ball caught my eye. Later, I saw a friend’s reel and couldn’t help but ask questions. She introduced me to her coach, and soon I was on the state team,” Shivani told TOI.What followed wasn’t a smooth, unhindered trot to the touchline; it was a bruising grapple. “People in my village mocked me for wearing shorts and said rugby was not for girls,” Shivani said. “Some even tried to pressure my family to stop me.” But she held her ground with the fortitude of a dogged forward. Her parents stood by her side, turning a deaf ear to the critics. Over time, she not only played in two national tournaments but also founded her own rugby club, training young girls from nearby villages. “I want these girls to dream bigger,” she said. “This sport has given me purpose, and I want others to experience the same.”In Dehradun, Jasvinder Kaur’s journey to the pitch was more of a sidestep. The daughter of a street hawker, she had a name as a state-level long-jump athlete before rugby entered her life six months ago. “I heard about rugby from a teammate,” she said. “It was unlike anything I’d done before — the sheer physicality and teamwork excited me.” Jasvinder’s athleticism made her a natural fit for the sport, and she quickly secured a spot on the state team. And shone.But like a player in a ruck, she faced her challenges. A collarbone injury during a match four months ago would have sidelined many, but not Jasvinder. “I didn’t let it red-card my ambitions,” she said with a smile. “My parents, with whatever meagre earnings they had, supported me through recovery and urged me to focus on trials for the National Games.” Her perseverance paid off, and now she’s eyeing gold for Uttarakhand.Radhika, a 21-year-old from Roorkee, likens her entry into rugby to an unexpected kick-off. Introduced to the sport by her cousin, she found herself intrigued by its intensity. “At first, it was daunting,” she admitted. “But I couldn’t resist the challenge.”With her mother, an anganwadi worker, cheering from the sidelines, Radhika quickly rose through the ranks, competing in two national tournaments within two years. “Rugby has taught me resilience,” she said. “The criticism from villagers didn’t faze me because my family was a like a solid defence line behind me.”The newest recruit to the state rugby team is 20-year-old Anjali Saini from Haridwar’s Laksar. “I saw a video on social media and was immediately hooked,” she said, her enthusiasm palpable. Anjali’s parents, farmers by trade, supported her wholeheartedly but added a word of caution. “They worry about injuries,” she said.Assistant coach Anisha Khural marvels at their tenacity. “Their stories will inspire women to break free from conventions and join the game.”","Young women from modest backgrounds rewriting their destinies to make a name for themselves in the hard sport.

star

Stephen Curry

WIZARDS at WARRIORS | FULL GAME HIGHLIGHTS | January 18, 2025

When and where to watch the Golden State Warriors vs Boston Celtics game tonight (January 20, 2025)?

is listed as “questionable” for his team’s upcoming game against the Boston Celtics. Curry rolled his ankle near the end of the Warriors’ most recent game against the Washington Wizards. While Steve Kerr said that the injury wasn’t painful, it seems like things have changed since Saturday. Even Curry mentioned that he felt great and would be seeing us on Monday, so his status for this contest comes as quite a surprise.If he sits out this will be the ninth game that Curry misses for the Dubs this season. He has started 33 games for Golden State and is currently averaging 23.0 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 6.2 assists while shooting 45.0% from the field. Curry has also been on fire from beyond the arc shooting 41.1% on 10.8 attempts per game. Furthermore, the 36-year-old has also been very good against the Celtics through most of his career. Stephen Curry has played 27 regular season games against the Celtics and averages 23.4 points., 5.4 assists and 4.3 rebounds against them. He also had a legendary finals series against them when he led the Warriors to the NBA Championship in 2022. As it is clear to see, Curry has always been key against the Boston Celtics, and having him on the floor tonight will be crucial if the team wishes to record another win.While Curry is questionable, the Warriors have other injuries to deal with. Head coach Steve Kerr will also have to account for the absences of Brandin Podziemski, Draymond Green, Kyle Anderson, and Jonathan Kuminga who are all out for Monday’s games against Boston. The Warriors have just won two games in a row and a win over the Celtics will be huge.The momentum boost from beating the reigning champs is exactly what the Dubs need to salvage their season. Hopefully, Stephen Curry recovers in time and is ready to take the floor against the Boston Celtics tonight. If not, it’ll be interesting to see how Steve Kerr tries to plug the gaps in his lineup.ALSO READ: Boston Celtics vs Golden State Warriors (01/20): Starting five, injury report, start time, game prediction, betting tips, how to watch, and more The Boston Celtics will pay a visit to the Chase Center to take on the Golden State Warriors at 5:00 PM ET.

Brett Favre’s tough playing style results in ongoing health struggles

Brett Favre, the former NFL quarterback, has shared concerns about his health after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement. He is also worried about the long-term effects of his football career, particularly regarding Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), a brain condition linked to repeated head injuries.Brett Favre, known for his bold playing style in the NFL, is now facing health challenges in retirement. His tendency to hold onto the ball and take hits helped him make key plays but may have contributed to the issues he's dealing with now.In a recent interview, Brett Favre, the Hall of Fame quarterback for the Green Bay Packers, shared the details of his Parkinson’s disease diagnosis. He had initially revealed this diagnosis during a congressional hearing on welfare reform in September 2024, making it a public matter. ""I have to admit, I thought the world was caving in on me. It was the end of the world,"" Favre told TMZ. ""I can't believe this, not me. I'm healthy, I'm very active, it doesn't happen to me.""Brett Favre has shared the intense fear that came with his Parkinson's disease diagnosis, stating in his interview, ""There's always the fear of what happens next... what's the next step?"" The ambiguity surrounding his condition has understandably caused distress as he faces the possible advancement of the disease, which can significantly affect his mobility, mental abilities, and overall well-being.Favre's fears have been further worsened by recent events in sports, especially the revelation that former NFL player Frank Wycheck had Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) at the time of his death. CTE, a brain disorder linked to repeated head injuries, has raised concerns among former players as the lasting effects of concussions become clearer.Frank Wycheck’s case increased awareness of how repeated brain trauma can lead to serious cognitive and mental issues, deepening Favre's worries about the potential for CTE, along with his Parkinson’s diagnosis. ""It makes me wonder what the future brings for me,"" Favre said. ""I've already been diagnosed with Parkinson's. I often wonder-and I try not to, but I can't help it-what the future holds.""""I would think that every player that dies from here on out, if they have their brain tested, I'd say a high percentage would have CTE,"" Brett Favre added. ""We're just really scraping the surface of how damaging head trauma can be.I think people now take it seriously, but there is still that 'Ah, you know' attitude, almost like it's a fad, but we know it's not.""Also Read: LSU QB Colin Hurley Hospitalized After Car Crash, Family Shares Positive Health Update Brett Favre's candidness about his difficulties emphasizes the obstacles many retired athletes encounter as they grow older, dealing with both the physical and psychological impacts of their careers.","Brett Favre, the former NFL quarterback, has shared concerns about his health after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

Famous Sportscaster Evan Roberts Believes Pete Alonso Could Still Rejoin The New York Mets After Rejecting Their Deal



Breaking News: Los Angeles Dodgers Sign Tanner Scott - Rico Brogna Episode 414

Pete Alonso Has Reportedly Turned Down Other Teams Also



MLB Notebook: Padres, Michael King, Roki Sasaki, Dodgers, Jack Flaherty, Angels, Pete Alonso, Mets

Pete Alonso, one of the most popular players in Major League Baseball, has been in the news lately for speculations about the team he would be joining for the 2025 MLB season . A few days ago, according to Joel Sherman of the New York Post, Pete has reportedly rejected a pretty expensive deal with the New York Mets. But now, famous sportscaster Evan Roberts believes that Pete still has a chance with the New York Mets.Evan Roberts appeared on the WFAN's “Rico Brogna, An Evan Roberts Podcast” and shared some insights from the MLB world. According to Roberts, all that Pete needs to do is give a call to the New York Mets and discuss about rejoining the team for the 2025 season of Major League Baseball.Roberts added, ""I think Pete Alonso could still pick up his phone, Aaron Judge-style, and call Steven Cohen. Things might have gotten ugly and dirty but he should express the desire to come back and make things work.”According to New York Post’s Joel Sherman Pete Alonso’s former team, the New York Mets, had reportedly offered him a three year deal for a whopping $68 million to $70 million but Pete rejected it. But Roberts believes Pete still has a chance with the New York Mets even after they offered pretty expensive deals to star pitcher, A.J. Minter and outfielder Jesse Winker.However, the deal with the New York Mets is not the only deal that has not worked out for Pete Alonso this season. A few days ago, famous sportscaster Lee Hamilton revealed on his podcast that Pete was “in talks” with the Los Angeles Angels for a two year deal, worth a whopping $50 million.But the deal fell through even though it is not known for sure if Pete and his sports agency were the ones who turned it down or if the Los Angeles Angels took back their offer. According to Lee Hamilton, it was Pete’s sports agency, The Boras Corporation, which is led by Scott Boras, who believed that Pete could seek a higher deal and wanted him to get $31.1 million per season instead of $50 million for two years.Lee slammed Pete and his sports agency for this decision and said, “...And they have to give up two draft picks to sign him because he was given a qualifying offer by the Mets and turned it down? So immediately, it's draft pick compensation. Why would you sign Alonso for a two-year deal with the risk he could opt out after one year, and you lose draft picks too? Right, makes no sense at all.”Pete Alonso joined the New York Mets back in 2019 and stayed with them till the 2024 MLB season. Back in 2024, the New York Mets had also reportedly offered him a qualifying offer which Pete turned down.Also Read: Dodgers' pitchers Freddie Freeman and Alex Vesia’s responses to Roki Sasaki’s decision spark interest ahead of 2025 MLB season","Pete Alonso, one of the most popular players in Major League Baseball, has been in the news lately for speculations about the team he would be joining for the 2025 MLB season.

How Josh Allen Shaped the Bills’ Success

“I’m so proud of our defense. I’m so proud of our offense and special teams. What a complete win.”

Bonuses on the Table for Allen

The Buzz Around Contract Restructuring.



“The Bills and Josh Allen have a great relationship. I would not be surprised if the team offers an adjustment this offseason.”

Next Stop: The Chiefs



Josh Allen, the quarterback for the Buffalo Bills , is having his most impressive season thus far, and the rewards are beginning to appear. With a commanding 27-25 victory over Lamar Jackson's Baltimore Raven, Allen has solidified his status as an outstanding quarterback in the league. He may win the Bills' most prestigious MVP award next season, but they are eager to offer him substantial bonuses and a new contract.Buffalo has clinched the AFC Conference title for the second time in five years thanks to Josh Allen's impressive season, with 3,731 passing yards and 40 total touchdowns. His leadership qualities and ability to handle pressure make him a valuable asset for the Buffalo in their pursuit of securing success in the Super Bowl.With his talent, resilience and determination evident, Allen dominated Baltimore in the game. Although he was statistically outperformed, the Bills made the most of their defense and Allen's consistent play to edge out the Ravens. When discussing the game, Allen expressed his pride in both his teammates and their defensive abilities.Allen's season is not solely focused on breaking records; it also involves earning money. If the Bills beat the Chiefs in the AFC title game , Allen will receive a $1M bonus. Should he go further and deliver Buffalo’s first Super Bowl win since 1994, another $2.5M bonus awaits him. And that’s not all—if he clinches the MVP title, which looks increasingly likely, Allen will pocket an additional $1.5M, bringing his potential season bonus total to $5M.With the value of Allen increasing, talks about a contract restructure are heating up. Why? Reports indicate that the Bills will attempt to negotiate his contract and pay $14.5M in advance. Allen's contract with NFL analyst Ian Rapoport indicates a front-loaded deal worth only $14.5M in the upcoming year.While the bonuses are exciting, Allen’s focus remains on the task ahead. The Bills face Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC title game—a team that has consistently been a roadblock in Buffalo’s path to Super Bowl glory.Allen’s determination and leadership have silenced critics this season, proving he’s the man to lead Buffalo to the top. Will this finally be the year the Bills bring the Lombardi Trophy home?

Who is Charlotte Flair’s mother?



What is next for Charlotte Flair in WWE?



Charlotte Flair ’s father, the legendary Ric Flair, has always been in the public eye due to his remarkable fame as a wrestling sensation. However, The Queen’s mother has chosen always to remain outside of the limelight.Charlotte Flair is considered to be one of the biggest female WWE superstars of all time. The Queen has perhaps transcended the legacy of her legendary father, The Nature Boy Ric Flair and created her own, breaking away from that illustrious shadow.This led to Charlotte claiming multiple accolades and becoming a 14-time WWE Women’s Champion while also competing in the first-ever Women’s main event at WrestleMania . However, there is no doubt that Ric Flair has been very instrumental in Charlotte’s success as a WWE superstar.While the popular father-daughter duo is often seen together onscreen and offscreen during high-profile events, Flair’s mother has been mostly out of the public eye.Charlotte Flair’s mother is Elizabeth Flair, who is also known as Beth. She was Ric Flair’s second wife, whom he met during the early 1980s. The couple fell in love and got married in 1983. Moreover, Elizabeth was often travelling with Ric Flair on the road during his time as a full-time performer and also used to help him manage his schedule.The couple had two children together. One, of course, is Charlotte Flair and the other is former wrestler Reid Flair, who passed away in 2013. Elizabeth and Ric Flair were married for almost two decades before parting ways in 2006. Charlotte Flair remains close to her mother and has often posted pictures with her on social media.Charlotte Flair has not been seen on WWE television programming since December 2023. She injured her knee in a match against Asuka during an episode on SmackDown . Since then, Flair has been undergoing constant rehabilitation to get back to in-ring action.Moreover, after months of speculations, WWE finally confirmed the return of Charlotte Flair. On the January 17 edition of Friday Night SmackDown, WWE aired a video package of Charlotte hyping her comeback. Flair could be seen at various places with a montage of her top moments played in the package. While no exact details were provided on her return date, there is a possibility that it could happen at the upcoming WWE Royal Rumble 2025 event.Also read: Exploring Potential Storylines For Charlotte Flair After WWE Announced Her Return","Charlotte Flair is considered to be one of the biggest female WWE superstars of all time.

“I think more of it is we have a variety of guys around him..The opportunities he has had, he’s done well with them. It’s his play that has been reduced..We got a variety of guys we can use around him. When we didn't, teams were ganging up on. So, it’s a good problem now.

Mecole Hardman’s Recovery: A Beacon of Hope



“We’ll see how that goes here. I haven’t made any decisions on that yet. But he’s worked hard to try and get himself back. We’ll see how that all works out.”

Let's See What Future Holds For The Chiefs'



The Kansas City Chiefs find themselves on the verge of yet another Super Bowl appearance; however, a significant obstacle persists—the formidable Buffalo Bills. As the AFC Championship draws near, head coach Andy Reid has commented on a matter concerning star tight end Travis Kelce , whose contributions have proven to be crucial throughout the season. Reid also provided an optimistic update regarding wide receiver Mecole Hardman ’s potential return to the field, which could significantly influence the team’s offensive strategy.The Chiefs' journey to the AFC Championship has been nothing short of thrilling, with Travis Kelce positioned at the heart of it all. His clutch touchdown against the Texans marked a pivotal moment, cementing Kansas City's standing in this high-stakes contest. During a recent press conference, Andy Reid contemplated how Kelce's role has transformed this season.This so-called ""good problem"" underscores the depth of the team’s roster. Because other offensive players are stepping up, opposing defenses have had to redirect their focus (this has allowed) Kelce to excel in crucial moments. However, it is important to note that success in such situations can be fleeting; although the current strategy works, it may not always be effective.Although Kelce continues to serve as a cornerstone of the offense, fans are equally eager for updates on Mecole Hardman (the speedster who played a crucial role in last year’s Super Bowl victory). Reid addressed the situation in the same press conference, expressing (somewhat) measured optimism regarding Hardman’s potential return.Reid shared.If Hardman is cleared to play, his presence would add another dynamic element to the Chiefs’ offense, giving Patrick Mahomes even more firepower to counter Buffalo’s formidable defense. This situation remains fluid, but the implications are significant.As the Chiefs get ready to face the Bills, the team’s depth, health (which has been a concern) and versatility will be crucial factors in determining their success. Although Kelce continues to perform under reduced pressure, Hardman’s return is looming as a possibility; this gives Kansas City a well-equipped position to make another strong push for the Super Bowl. For Chiefs fans, each decision and every play will carry added significance because the team is inching closer to the NFL’s ultimate prize. However, the stakes are higher than ever.Also read - Here’s How Beating Lamar Jackson is Making Josh Allen Richer Than Ever: Inside the $5M Deal","The Kansas City Chiefs face the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Championship.

"Ex-KKR coaches Gautam Gambhir, Brendon McCullum in 'home' rivalry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/england-tour-of-india-2025/ex-kkr-coaches-gautam-gambhir-brendon-mccullum-in-home-rivalry/articleshow/117412753.cms,"England's new white-ball coach says Team India counterpart is a 'strong leader of men'

KOLKATA: The upcoming white-ball series between India and England brings the coaches on either side under the scanner. Both Gautam Gambhir and England counterpart Brendon McCullum , interestingly, are former coaches and players of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) IPL franchise.After the Test series defeat Down Under, Gambhir's position as head coach is likely to be revaluated on the basis of India's Champions Trophy performance next month, so there is pressure on him. On the other hand, McCullum has made a new start, officially taking over as head coach across formats after having been in-charge of the Test team.McCullum's appointment comes after Matthew Mott was fired as white-ball coach on the back of two disappointing World Cup campaigns. England failed to advance to the semifinals of the ODI World Cup 2023 and just about made the top four in the T20 World Cup last year. The former New Zealand great's immediate task will be to inject some energy into the white-ball set-up.Gambhir got the India job more because of his success as a mentor in white-ball cricket, guiding the Kolkata Knight Riders to the IPL title. He was able to carry on the momentum during the T20I series against Sri Lanka, where India won all the three matches following the retirements of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli from the shortest format. However, the former India opener is yet to secure a win in the 50-over format and the upcoming Champions Trophy is going to be important for his coaching future.McCullum will be carrying high expectations after he revolutionized the team's Test cricket with the 'Bazball' approach after becoming Test coach in July 2022. But he has never coached a white-ball international team, although he had brief stints as T20 coach for two franchise teams, with KKR being one of those.McCullum, for one, expressed respect for his India counterpart on Monday.""What I will say about Gautam Gambhir is that I've worked with him before. He's an outstanding leader. He's a really strong leader of men, and in the time that he's had in any sort of leadership positions he's held previously, he's been able to excel,"" McCullum told reporters here. ""He's only just sort of got underway with this team, but I have no doubt that he'll get the best out of the talent that he's got. And then we've (England) got to find a way to be able to counter that with our own style.""Asked about coaching styles and philosophies, McCullum said, ""Everyone's approaches are very unique. From how I try and operate, it's probably less of a coach and more about trying to make sure that the environment is a happy and enjoyable one, where you guys feel as if they can push their talents and push themselves towards uncomfortable situations, knowing that there's still going to be that support and care there afterwards and be encouraged to go again go towards those.""Other coaches are very different. They like to run things in a quite structured, quite technical way. Other coaches are probably a bit more regimented in how they go about things, so I guess it's all fairly different,"" McCullum said.",Gautam Gambhir and Brendon McCullum are former coaches and players of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) IPL franchise.

NEW DELHI: Paarl Royals continued their winning streak by comfortably chasing 147 against Joburg Super Kings (JSK), sealing a six-wicket victory and moving to the top of the table.Bowlers Bjorn Fortuin (2/22), Mujeeb Ur Rahman (1/28), Joe Root (1/16), and Dayyaan Galiem (1/19) ensured JSK could only post 146/6, despite Jonny Bairstow's valiant 60 off 40 balls and Donovan Ferreira's unbeaten 32 off 19.Miller showcased his finishing skills with a towering six off Lutho Sipamla, completing the chase in style alongside Mitchell van Buuren (44 off 45).Admitting the team’s struggles in the post-match press conference, JSK head coach Stephen Fleming said, ""We are unsettled, but it's the nature of where the squad's at right now. The last two games have been a little underwhelming in terms of some of the quality of our play. And we've just found ourselves in situations where we either run short or just not having a good enough sequence with the ball to put pressure on.""""We're a little bit off from the top down, from management down. We've got to settle and start playing a bit more or putting a bit more rhythm into our cricket , which is not there at the moment,"" he added.On topping the standings, Royals' star Fortuin cautioned, ""We won’t count our chickens too early. The past two seasons we've had good starts and then sort of fallen away towards the back end. So we'll take it game by game.""Fortuin also praised veterans like Joe Root for their invaluable experience, adding, ""With Root and DK (Dinesh Karthik), there's a lot of experience we can lean on. He himself has played almost 500 games, so from a game plan point of view, he's pretty sound. He's not a loud guy who would shout at us, but he has his own way of leading.""With this win, Paarl Royals fortified their playoff hopes, leaving JSK with tough decisions ahead.",Paarl Royals beat Joburg Super Kings by six wickets. Jonny Bairstow and Donovan Ferreira top scored for JSK with 60 and 44 respectively. Bjorn Fortuin took 2/22 and Mujeeb Ur Rahman took 1/28 for Royals.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117412268,imgsize-66612,width-400,resizemode-4/117412268.jpg"

When you play a shot, commit to it. That’s true of life as in golf . No stranger to the No. 1 slot, Joaquin Niemannwas the top-ranked amateur from May 2017 to Apr 2018 and after turning professional, he harboured ambitions to be the world’s best. No surprise there.Having won twice on the PGA Tour , and bubbling as he was labelled the next big thing, the Chilean who loves collecting high-end watches called time on the premier circuit in 2022 and dealt a second hand at the lucrative Saudi-backed LIV Golf . Rumour had it he got paid $100 million to flip the switch. But that was not the whole story.“I always like being in a team atmosphere. So, having that possibility of being in a team and getting better, I feel like it’s much bigger than playing for yourself. So being part of that is nice,” said the golfer from Santiago. And then there were those before him who made that much-maligned move. “The characters that went to LIV were the best – Bryson (DeChambeau), Brooks (Koepka), Dustin (Johnson) and it wasn’t a very difficult decision, and being part of a team process interested me.”“I have always been a team fan,” he reiterated, lest you doubted him.The upshot of soaking in this atmosphere was the downer of losing World ranking points, with LIV being snubbed by the OWGR governing body. And as the Tour craved for legitimacy, the players had to find different routes to the Majors. And so, you saw Niemann hop ping through continents, turning up in European Tour events.One such pathway was the Asian Tour ’s International Series, which was launched in 2022 in an agreement with LIV Golf. “I got enough points to maybe get the attention of the Majors,” the 26-year-old, who won the $5million PIF Saudi Invitational in Dec, said. A second consecutive Masters invite arrived, when Augusta National rewarded him for “showcasing his talent while competing around the world”.Next week, he will be teeing up at the DLF Golf and Country Club’s Black Knight course in Gurugram for the International Series India along with his Torque teammates Sebastian Munoz, Mito Pereira and Carlos Ortiz. “I will come with no expectations and just go to your country without judgment.”",Joaquin Niemann was the top-ranked amateur from May 2017 to Apr 2018.

'I'm looking at building the franchise with Pant'

LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka talks to TOI on his expectations from the new captain....

Can Rishabh's price tag become a burden?

How important is it to have a culture of your own?

KOLKATA: Rishabh Pant's credentials as a leader are growing fast. The wicketkeeper-batter was on Monday named captain of Lucknow Super Giants ( LSG ), the IPL franchise that broke the bank for him at a mind-boggling Rs 27 cr. That at least two franchises were willing to go beyond the Rs 20 crore mark for him proves the kind of trust that Pant commands.""We would not have stopped at this amount,"" LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka says. Pant , however, wasn't surprised. ""Of course I was happy, but it was never about money,"" he told TOI in an exclusive interview.Leadership for me is more about looking after the players. How can you get the best out of them. How can you create an environment where they feel safe and stable so that they can give their 200%.I wasn't surprised, I have to say this (chuckles). But for me it wasn't about the money anyway. When I came to the auction, money wasn't in my thoughts, but I must say I was very happy with what I got. I wanted to be in a place where I could create the right environment with the help of the management. Create a franchise where people aspire to come, play and give their 100%.It's definitely a comfort zone as we have a lot of players who have experience in leadership in international cricket. You want to share that and it's always good to take the views of your seniors. A captain is as good as the team and everyone in the room is also thinking about the game. So, if you listen to everyone, keep everything in account and then make decisions, it is always good for the team. A good leader is always a good listener and that is something I would like to take forward.I've thought about it. I tried to tone myself down and I wanted to change a little, as people sometimes don't like it if I'm a little extroverted. With time you improve as an individual. Your decision-making changes. So, it's a mix of a lot of things. But after my car accident, I realized that there is no need to tone down. If I am excited about something, it means I care about it. Sometimes when you play cricket for a few years, your excitement goes down and you stop enjoying the game. You may be in a different position in your career, but that doesn't mean you need to change.I started playing cricket because I loved it. The thought process was to play for India and give my 200%. Now that I am blessed to be doing that, if I stop enjoying it means I am deviating from my goals. I promised myself that I am going to enjoy it more. There are a few people in the world who can do what they like and make money out of it, and why not. I see it as an opportunity. Coming to a new franchise is an opportunity.I joined when I was 17-18, so it was a very emotional decision. But we are professionals, and this is what we do. I'm not thinking much about that now. Once the decision was made, I knew it would be a very difficult one. I knew I would feel bad but I can't be living in the past. I'd like to move on and get better. Now it's a different family for me and I'll look to build more relationships with the people here.The price tag (for Pant) was only relevant till the time the auction didn't happen. Thereafter, he is the leader. It's not about the tag. It's about his leadership, his performance, how he motivates players, how he strategizes. So, I haven't thought about the price tag for a moment after the auction got over. Everyone has got the same Rs 120 crore purse and it's your discretion on how you distribute it. Rishabh deserves that price. If the bidding had gone on and it was Rs 28 crore, I still would have gone for him as he was fundamental to all our plans. It's about the skills he brings. I'm looking at it for the next 10-12 years. He is 27 and will play till 40. I'm looking at building the franchise with him. The more I see him, the more I'm convinced he is the perfect choice for us.It's important for everyone to feel comfortable and happy. That is what we want to create. Also, we want to have an atmosphere of never-say-die attitude. These are the things that I feel Rishabh embodies. No owner is looking to win all the matches. As long as the win ratio is more than losses, it is good for us.","Rishabh Pant was on Monday named captain of Lucknow Super Giants ( LSG ), the IPL franchise that broke the bank for him at a mind-boggling Rs 27 cr.

Coco Gauff 's dreams of clinching another Grand Slam title came to an abrupt end as her forehand and serve faltered against Paula Badosa in the Australian Open quarterfinals on Tuesday. The No. 3 seed was eliminated by the 27-year-old Spaniard, who secured a straight-set victory, 7-5, 6-4, to advance to her maiden Grand Slam semifinal.Gauff, riding high on a 13-match winning streak and a flawless 9-0 record in 2025, entered the match brimming with confidence following her triumph at the WTA Finals last November. Despite her momentum, the 2023 US Open champion struggled to maintain consistency, committing 41 unforced errors, including six costly double faults and 28 missed forehands. Her serve woes were particularly evident, with a double fault handing Badosa a critical break to lead 5-2 in the second set.Badosa, seeded No. 11, displayed remarkable composure and resilience. ""She’s full of confidence. But I’m playing well, too,"" Badosa said before the match. Her confidence proved justified as she outmaneuvered Gauff in key moments, neutralizing the American's typically dominant baseline game.Gauff's inability to generate a single break point until late in the second set further highlighted her struggles. By the time she began to mount a resistance, the deficit was too great to overcome. At just 20 years old, Gauff will look to rebound in the upcoming tournaments, but this loss serves as a stark reminder of the challenges at the highest level of competition.For Badosa, this victory marks a significant milestone in her career. The Spaniard will now aim to carry her momentum into the semifinals, with her sights set on an even deeper run at Melbourne Park .","Coco Gauff's dreams of clinching another Grand Slam title came to an abrupt end as her forehand and serve faltered against Paula Badosa.

With a scorching 78-run innings off 51 balls, Gulbadin Naib then spearheaded the chase and made sure the Capitals ended a three-match losing streak.With a scorching opening performance, captain Lockie Ferguson kept the Vipers in the game despite the poor first innings total. Ferguson put the Capitals in difficulty at 17/2 after catching Ben Dunk and Khalid Shah in the second over. Opener Shai Hope was run out for eight runs after a mix-up with Gulbadin Naib in the sixth over, despite the run rate being on target.The needed run rate was reduced to fewer than six runs per over when Naib, who had also been dropped for two runs earlier in the innings, made amends in the very next over by taking Nathan Sowter out for three sixes. With Sikandar Raza at one end, Naib hammered his way to a half-century of 31 balls, which included three sixes and two fours.In just 36 balls, the two brought up a 50-run partnership for the fourth wicket. Since the Capitals needed 32 runs in 36 balls at the 14-over stage, they were firmly in control.In the 15th over, Raza, who had taken few opportunities thus far, was caught for 24 runs in 26 balls off the shorter one from Mohammad Amir.

As the Capitals reached the target in 17.4 overs, Naib hit two more sixes.The Vipers, who batted first, got off to a quick start and ended the powerplay with 48/1. Before Dushmantha Chameera bowled him in the second over, Fakhar Zaman set the tone early with a six and a four. Alex Hales led the innings from the opposite end, while Dan Lawrence, who came in at number three, mirrored Zaman's intention.Nevertheless, despite a 58-run stand between Hales and Lawrence, the Capitals took control in the middle innings. Hales, Lawrence, and Sam Curran were all dismissed in three overs, dealing the Vipers a swift triple blow. In the tenth over, Haider Ali removed Hales for 34, and then Gulbadin Naib stopped Lawrence's 24-run attempt. The Vipers were then battling at 80/4 in 11.3 overs as Curran was stumped off Sikandar Raza for three runs.The collapse continued as the Vipers were bowled out for 139 in 20 overs. Wanindu Hasaranga (13) and Azam Khan (10) made brief contributions until both were overtaken by Zahir Khan. In his 27 runs off 24 balls, Sherfane Rutherford gave some hope by hitting three sixes, but Chameera hit for the third time in the penultimate over to put an end to his attack.Player of the Match, Gulbadin Naib said, ""We were at the bottom of the table, so we were looking for momentum. There's still a long way to go. It's not easy facing bowlers of this quality. Luckily, I gave myself some time. After the drinks break, the staff told me I was looking good, so I said to Sikandar, I will play to my strengths.""Desert Vipers captain, Lockie Ferguson said, ""It was a tough one. We were probably a few runs short and had some chances. They bowled well, and the pitch spun. There's a quick turnaround again, but the boys have been batting beautifully.""",Dubai Capitals beat Desert Vipers by six wickets. Dushmantha Chameera and Zahir Khan take three-wicket hauls. Gulbadin Naib hits 78-run innings off 51 balls. Caps end three-match losing streak.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117410582,imgsize-63022,width-400,resizemode-4/117410582.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The wait is finally over. India men's senior selection committee chaired by Ajit Agarkar will pick India's provisional squad for the upcoming Champions Trophy tomorrow (January 18) in Mumbai and they are set to face a happy headache while doing the same. While top-order is more or less clear, they need to find the right pieces for the middle-order puzzle. There are plenty of players in the mix for those 3-4 positions but Shreyas Iyer remains a no-brainer for the middle-overs period.With the right mix of caution and aggression, he has aced the 50-over game in the past and had a stellar 2023 ODI World Cup where he amassed 530 runs in 11 innings. The runs came at a healthy strike-rate and he hit two hundreds and three half-centuries during India's campaign. The right-hander had a turbulent little period where he lost out on an annual contract but bounced back in emphatic fashion during the IPL where he led KKR to the title.There were three ordinary outings against Sri Lanka in the ODIs but he rediscovered the touch during the domestic season where he made substantial contributions, across formats, for Mumbai. 452 runs in five First Class innings were followed by 345 runs in Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and 325 runs in five List A fixtures. He has the weight of runs behind him but more importantly has the game suited for the surfaces in Dubai. With spin expected to play a major role in the tournament, Iyer has what it takes to control the middle period of the game like he did during the 2023 ODI World Cup.He has time and again reiterated that he is not fussy about batting positions and that flexibility will certainly come good. The England ODIs will definitely help coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Rohit Sharma to finalise composition of their middle-order, and it will make a lot of sense if it revolves around Iyer.Yes, there are plenty of right-handers in the middle-order mix at the moment but India do have some flexible left-handers in the lower-order who they can seamlessly move around as per the match situation. Those movements were on display during the three ODIs vs Sri Lanka and it could well continue in the upcoming ODI assignments.Axar Patel or Ravindra Jadeja? Or both?India picked both the left-arm spin all-rounders for the T20 World Cup but only Axar played the Sri Lanka ODIs as Jadeja was rested. The selectors now need to take that tough call because Axar did exceedingly well in the T20 World Cup and looked good in the ODIs vs Sri Lanka too. Jadeja, on the other hand, last played an ODI back in November 2023.It now remains to be seen whether the management moves on from Jadeja or carries both. It will be very difficult to ignore Axar because he lends a lot of balance to the Playing XI with his all-round abilities.All the questions will be answered in a few hours' time as the men who matter will get in a huddle to pick the squad for the multi-nation tournament.",India men's senior selection committee will pick provisional squad for Champions Trophy.

David Miller lauds Lhuan-dre Pretorius after Paarl Royals beat MI Cape Town

Dinesh Karthik on Lhuan-dre Pretorius, start for Paarl Royals in SA20

Jasprit Bumrah injury: Where things stand with BOOM!

Lhuan-dre Pretorius may be living life in the fast lane at the Paarl Royals in the SA20 , but the teenager’s dad Abe is still picking up traffic fines.Pretorius has burst on the global cricket scene in spectacular fashion with the former South Africa U-19 star smashing two half-centuries in three matches to top the SA20 run-scorers list.He has surprised many with the maturity he’s shown at the crease. Unfazed at the prospect of facing up to the likes of Trent Boult, Kagiso Rabada, Marco Jansen and Ottniel Baartman.But Abe Pretorius - Lhuan-dre’s father - claims his son is still just a normal teen finding his way in the world.“I remember when Anrich Nortje bowled to him. He told me an interesting story: ‘Dad, I wasn’t scared of the ball. I was more scared of me running into him because I saw it on TV.’ He was never afraid. Pace never bothered him,” said the senior Pretorius.“But he’s still a baby. He’s only 18. He has a mustache. But his beard is soft. He's still a kid and sometimes I forget.“But he's also not a kid getting all the speed fines. The car is still in my name. It's crazy!”The Pretorius family have certainly been there to support Lhuan-dre and fellow South African schools prodigy Vihan - ‘he’s my baby and can do no wrong’ - cricket aspirations since they first picked up a cricket bat.Abe installed a training net at their home in Potchefstroom early on and since they stayed close to Senwes Park - home of the North West Dragons - would regularly take his sons there to train.Lhuan-dre, therefore, had the privilege of spending time with the likes of SA20 stars Bjorn Fortuin and Rassie van der Dussen from a very young age.“He always wanted to play the game. He was brought up next to the field at Senwes Park. So, I was privileged to have a hospitality suite there. And that’s where he met Bjorn and Rassie.“He always played with them or next to the field to see them playing. And that's what's so nice. He plays now with Bjorn. There's a bit of banter going on between them.”At this critical age parents can often become over-indulged with their children’s sporting careers, forcing them to train when they may no longer enjoy it.Abe was never confronted with this issue.“He lives for cricket. He YouTubes cricket every night. I don’t think he’s watched a cartoon ever in his life. From a young age, before any big game, he would wake me up at five.“And we had a net in our yard at the back. So I needed to throw to him before school. And when he gets picked up and then he's ready in the afternoon.“I think more waking him up for academics. He never wanted to study. That was a headache and we had to get a tutor to assist him.”Whilst it was almost the perfect childhood growing up in Potchefstroom, the major cricket-playing high schools are based in Johannesburg. That’s close to 120 kilometres away.It is common practice for young South African boys to leave their family homes at 12-13 years old after being afforded scholarships to attend these ivy-league schools as hostel boarders.But Abe was having none of it. Instead, he packed up and relocated the entire family to “The Big Smoke” - as Johannesburg is colloquially referred to - for Lhuan-dre to attend the prestigious St Stithians College - alma mater of Kagiso Rabada, Grant Elliot and a certain Kwena Maphaka.The latter is, of course, the same age as Lhuan-dre with their cricket journeys following an almost identical path. They played together at school, youth provincial Lions teams, SA U19, and now at the Royals.And according to Abe, it's Lhuan-dre, who kept wicket for most of this period, that knows how to inspire the tearaway rookie fast bowler.“Lhuan-dre knew just how to switch Kwena on. He would always go up to Kwena and whisper something in his ear, and Kwena would get spitting mad,” he said.“After that, Kwena would run through the teams. There are a lot of video clips of when they were at school together, especially when Lhuan-dre was keeping. They were a mean team.”With Lhuan-dre being a left-handed opening batter that keeps wicket, has Gunn & Moore as his bat sponsor, and also having an aversion to a prospective academic career, the comparisons with Proteas and Durban's Super Giants star Quinton de Kock were inevitable.But according to Abe, Lhuan-dre would not want it any other way, and is looking forward to the Royals’ first clash against the Super Giants at Kingsmead on Thursday, January 23.“He’s had a photo up of Quinny since he was very young. He’s still Quinny’s biggest fan. He simply loved Quinny.“Everything about him is Quinny. Yeah, I think you're going to see when they're going to play each other. It's going to be a challenge. I think he's going to be a star-struck!""Everything is happening at the speed of light for Pretorius right now. If he maintains this early season momentum through SA20 Season 3, it would not be far too to suggest that the powerful left-hander could come into the reckoning as a potential replacement at the Indian Premier League (IPL) in the near future.So, how does a father keep a teenager in check when the whole world suddenly wants to give him everything his heart has always desired?“I'm Afrikaans! That's all. He knows me. I don’t play.“I'm a mining oak and I'm Afrikaans. So, he'll know his way.“That's a cultural thing. He knows how it works. You stay humble.”",Lhuan-dre Pretorius has scored two half-centuries in three matches for Paarl Royals in the SA20. The 18-year-old has surprised many with the maturity he’s shown at the crease.

Numbers elicit praise from likes of Sachin

NAGPUR: Ironic as it may sound, the buzzword in Indian cricket over the past weeks has been a non-cricketing term - PR. Fan wars on social media, ignited by the debacle in Australia, sparked debates on 'paid news' versus authenticity.With the debate still raging, a post on X went viral on social media on Thursday evening. "" Karun Nair has a serious shot at making it to the Indian team if he can afford hiring a PR agency for a while,"" said the post.The witty remark struck a chord, highlighting the one element missing in Nair's arsenal - a robust social media presence. But in the Vijay Hazare Trophy , it wasn't PR that spoke for him; it was his bat, loud and clear.A total of 752 runs, at an unbelievable average of 752 was enough for Nair to trend on X. Social media has been abuzz, with many urging Indian selectors to draft Nair into the Indian squad for the forthcoming England ODI series and the Champions Trophy scheduled in Pakistan and Dubai.With an unstoppable 88* off just 44 balls on Thursday, Nair, who had been knocking on the selectors' door, almost broke it in the semifinal. Coming in to bat in the 35th over, the Vidarbha skipper unleashed his magic in the final 15 balls he played in the match, stacking up 55* runs. His ball-by-ball figures read 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 6, 6, 1, 6, 4, 0, 6, 4, 4, 6. He hit boundaries for fun and toyed with the field at will.Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar lauded Nair's run on Friday. ""Scoring 752 runs in 7 innings with 5 centuries is nothing short of extraordinary, @karun126. Performances like these don't just happen, they come from immense focus and hard work. Keep going strong and make every opportunity count,"" he posted on X.Former Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh too was vocal on his Youtube channel, questioning the double standards of selectors. ""Different rules for different people… that shouldn't be the way. When Nair is scoring runs, you need to play him, right? He doesn't have tattoos, doesn't wear fancy clothes, is that the reason you're not picking him? Does he not work hard,"" he said.Some also drew comparisons of Nair's purple patch with that of VVS Laxman before the stylish batsman was re-drafted in the Indian squad. ""When Laxman made a comeback into the Indian team, he made a big statement with 1,400-odd runs. Nair's stupendous show should be enough for him to launch his comeback,"" a post read.Nair's super show has rewritten history books too. He now tops the list of most runs as a captain in the Vijay Hazare trophy. He is also set to finish as batsman with highest average in Vijay Hazare history.Prior to being dismissed for 112 against Uttar Pradesh, Nair had set a new List A record of scoring 542 runs without being dismissed, going past former New Zealand allrounder James Franklin","Vidarbha batsman Karun Nair scores 752 runs at an average of 752 in Vijay Hazare Trophy.

Hopefully, 2025 will be a better season for us: Sharjah Warriorz captain Tim Southee

ILT20: Captain speak on media day ahead of third season

Sharjah Warriorz clinched a thrilling victory over Dubai Capitals in their first home game of the season, thanks to a stunning counter-attacking innings by Sri Lankan batter Avishka Fernando . With this win, the Warriorz have climbed to the second spot on the points table.The Sharjah Warriorz chased down the target with 5 wickets and 11 deliveries to spare , despite facing a daunting chase of 202 runs. Captain Tim Southee praised Fernando's incredible performance, especially considering he had just arrived on the morning of the match.""To chase down a score like that and that innings from Fernando was incredible. To get off the plane in the morning and do that is special. Fernando was outstanding for us,"" Southee said.Southee acknowledged that there were areas for improvement, particularly in fielding and bowling, but he was pleased with the team's depth, as several players stepped up to perform despite some being sick.Coach JP Duminy echoed Southee's sentiments, emphasising the need to work on their fielding as a collective effort. He expressed the team's desire to excel in this aspect of the game.""Fielding is an area of our game that we can work on. We try to collectively put in a big effort in the field. So, that's something we want to work on and fielding is something we want to be better at for sure,"" Duminy said.Avishka Fernando, who scored a blistering 81 off just 27 deliveries, with 8 sixes and 6 fours, credited his success to focusing on his natural game and maintaining a positive mindset while chasing a formidable target. Fernando's knock was the fastest-ever 50 in the history of the ILT20 .""Focussing on my natural game and thank the lord for today's knock. The wicket was nice to bat today, the thoughts when chasing 200 was to be positive, it came naturally and thankful for that. I did not realise that I have broken the record for the fastest-ever 50.""Coach Duminy showered praise on Fernando, commending his confidence and ability to perform despite having just joined the team. He emphasised the importance of creating an environment where players feel at ease, which is something the Sharjah Warriorz strive for.""Just the mindset that he came in with, he got off the plane last night and got introduced to the team after that. And to have the confidence to arrive and play the way he did, shows, not only his character but also his ability. And just for him to feel at ease in our environment is something we (Sharjah Warriorz) strive for, but that was certainly one of the most special knocks we have seen,"" the coach added.Duminy revealed that the team talk at the halfway stage was light-hearted, focusing on the quality of the pitch and the need to play to their abilities. He emphasised that intent would never be lacking in their lineup and that consistency was the key moving forward.Sharjah Warriorz will face the MI Emirates in their next match at Sharjah on Sunday.",Sharjah Warriorz beat Dubai Capitals by five wickets.

We're a better outfit than the last two games: Super Giants coach Lance Klusener

Keep improving and play some better cricket: Sunrisers' Liam Dawson

Durban's Super Giants faced another setback in the ongoing SA20 League , suffering a 58-run loss to defending champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape at Kingsmead on Friday. The defeat marked their second consecutive loss at home, leaving head coach Lance Klusener visibly disappointed with his team's performance.""We have a proud record from last season playing at home, so this is absolutely disappointing,"" Klusener said after the match. ""I think we're a better outfit than how we turned out in the last two games. While the surfaces have been challenging, that's no excuse. We lacked the aggression to take the first punch, and when you're on the back foot, it's tough to recover.""The Sunrisers, who entered the match on the back of three consecutive losses, delivered a resounding comeback. Klusener credited their sharpness and determination. ""They came in with three losses, so for them to bounce back the way they did was outstanding. They were running well between the wickets, and we all know how well they field. Sometimes it's the small things that make the big difference.""The Super Giants' batting woes continued to be a concern, with the team failing to capitalise on starts. ""It's not about the batting quality; we have outstanding batters. The problem lies in not building partnerships or capitalising on starts. This evening that surface was tough to make a comeback against some quality spin,"" Klusener explained.Noor Ahmad was the standout performer for Super Giants, taking 4 for 25. Klusener praised his former Afghanistan players, Ahmad and Naveen-ul-Haq , the latter finishing with 1 for 44. ""Noor has been an outstanding performer for a few years now. He bowls at a good pace, making it tough to pick him through the air. That's his strength. Naveen is quality too - most wickets in T20s last year. It's great to see them both step up.""Looking ahead, Klusener emphasised the need for self-reflection. ""We need to focus on ourselves rather than worrying too much about the opposition. The way we batted, especially without building partnerships, needs to change. While our bowling is in a better place, we need to score more runs to be competitive,"" he said.Meanwhile, Sunrisers Eastern Cape finally broke their losing streak in the SA20 season with the big win. The defending champions, who had struggled in their first three matches, delivered a performance that Liam Dawson described as crucial for their campaign.""It was a very important win. We know how good they are, especially at home,"" Dawson remarked in the post-match press conference. ""They've got two quality spinners in Noor Ahmed and Keshav Maharaj. So we knew it was going to be tough coming here and getting a win. As a group, we’ve been honest with ourselves—we haven’t played to our potential at all yet in this tournament. This was a massive game for us, and we’re very, very happy to get the win.""Dawson highlighted the team’s resolve to use this victory as a turning point. ""Without doubt, we’d love this to be the catalyst for more winning performances and points on the board. We know we’ve been below our standards in the first three or four games. We’ve got to come back Sunday and try to produce another good performance against a very strong side,"" he said.Acknowledging the competitive nature of the SA20 League, Dawson stressed the need for continuous improvement. ""Every team is strong in this competition. We won’t take this win for granted at all. There’s a lot we need to improve on as a group. The focus is on keeping the momentum and playing better cricket,"" he added.",Durban's Super Giants lost 58-run to Sunrisers Eastern Cape at Kingsmead.

Former India cricketer Aakash Chopra has expressed surprise over the BCCI 's decision to enforce mandatory travel rules for players, requiring them to travel together with the team for matches and practice sessions. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Chopra questioned the necessity of such a regulation and suggested it might have been introduced due to prior misuse.""Players cannot travel separately with families. All players are expected to travel with the team to and from matches and practice sessions. I am extremely surprised by this rule. Going for practice or the match is with the team only,"" Chopra said. ""This has been happening forever. If someone wants to practice more, they request the coach. But has someone been leaving early? Some abuse must have happened; that's why this rule is being enforced,"" he added.The BCCI's decision follows a review meeting held after India's 1-3 loss to Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, attended by captain Rohit Sharma , head coach Gautam Gambhir , and chief selector Ajit Agarkar Referencing recent incidents, Chopra clarified that isolated lapses, like Yashasvi Jaiswal reportedly arriving late to a session, do not reflect a widespread issue. ""I am pretty sure everyone wouldn't have been flouting the rule. Yashasvi Jaiswal couldn't reach recently, and he got punished for being late. That's a different story,"" he explained.Chopra also highlighted the importance of accountability for those who might have allowed exceptions in the past. ""If someone claims they don't need to travel with the team because they're staying elsewhere or it's their city, then whoever permitted this should be called out,"" he asserted.The new rule requires players seeking to travel separately to obtain permission from both the head coach and the chairman of selectors. While acknowledging that such regulations might feel overly strict, Chopra remarked, ""Such things are bound to happen if rules are abused.""",Aakash Chopra has expressed surprise over the BCCI's decision to enforce mandatory travel rules for players.

Axar Patel hints at flexible middle-order ahead of England T20I series

Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has dismissed concerns about Virat Kohli 's recent slump in form, hailing him as the ""greatest white-ball player"" and a ""once-in-a-lifetime cricketer.""Despite Kohli's impressive century in the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Perth, he struggled in the subsequent innings, scoring only 85 runs in the next seven innings.India's senior players, including Kohli and captain Rohit Sharma , failed to deliver, resulting in a 1-3 series loss to Australia.""Virat Kohli is a once-in-a-lifetime cricketer. To score 81 international centuries in a career is something unbelievable. For me, he's probably the greatest white-ball player the world has seen,"" Ganguly said during a Cricket Association of Bengal ( CAB )felicitation programme for the state's players.Ganguly expressed surprise at Kohli's inability to build on his Perth century throughout the remainder of the series.""I was really surprised the way he batted after getting a 100 in Perth. He struggled before that but I thought after the 100 in Perth, it'll be a big series for him.""""But I think it happens. Every player has his weakness and strength. You know, there's no player in the world, who will not have that. It's how you adapt to your weaknesses as you play great bowlers over a period of time.""Ganguly remains confident that Kohli will regain his form in the upcoming three-match ODI series against England and the subsequent Champions Trophy.""He will score runs in this tournament in Indian conditions, and I still feel there's a lot of cricket left in Virat Kohli, the tour of England will be a big challenge for him.""""I'm not too worried about his form in the Champions Trophy, because as I said, he's probably the best white-ball player the world has seen for a long period of time.""Ganguly also believes that India will be one of the favourites in the Champions Trophy, citing their recent success in the 2023 ODI World Cup, where they finished as runners-up, and their unbeaten run to the T20 World Cup title last year.""I know India did not have a great series in Australia, but if you look at the last two World Cups, the T20 World Cup India won it unbeaten, and the 50-over World Cup India lost their final.""""So if you look at India's performance in the last two World Cups, they've just lost one game, in almost about 20 of them. So, I think it's a phenomenal white ball team. For me, they will be the favourites in the Champions Trophy.""Ganguly also backed Indian skipper Rohit Sharma to bounce back in the Champions Trophy.""Rohit Sharma in white-ball cricket is phenomenal, and you will see a different Rohit Sharma once the Champions Trophy starts. And as I said, they (India) will be one of the contenders in the tournament.""However, Ganguly stressed that India needs to improve their Test cricket performance, especially with their upcoming series in England this summer.""Come England in July, they'll have to really work hard to play well there because the conditions are different. The red ball and the seaming, swinging pitches, they'll have to bat a bit better than what they have done.""""I've always said that if you score 350 to 400 runs in first innings of Test matches away from home, you get yourself in a position to win Test matches.""""Now if you're getting out for less than 200, then you're always fighting from behind. And the reason they won in Perth is because they got 400-500 runs on the board in second innings.""Ganguly expressed delight at seeing pacer Mohammed Shami return to full fitness after a lengthy injury layoff.""I'm happy to see Shami fit because I think he's probably the best bowler after (Jasprit) Bumrah in the country.""""I know he'll be a bit nervous because he's playing cricket after a long time, especially with a knee injury, but the good thing is that he bowled a lot for Bengal in the domestic cricket, which is going to help him in the games to come.""Shami is set to make his international comeback in the first T20I against England on Wednesday.Ganguly also endorsed Shami's return to Test cricket, emphasizing his importance to the team's success.""He's as good as anybody in the world. Shami and Bumrah bowling at two ends is different than Bumrah bowling from one end. Both players are vital to each other's success in Test cricket.""Amid the criticism faced by Team India following their loss to Australia, Ganguly highlighted the significance of focusing on performance and maintaining a strong mindset.""There's so much at stake with sport these days, and there will be negativity and opinions. As an athlete, you need to find a way to keep yourself out of it.""","Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has dismissed concerns about Virat Kohli's recent slump in form.

Indian pacer Mohammed Shami is set to make a comeback to the national team after a 14-month hiatus due to an ankle injury on his left leg that required surgery. His last appearance for India was in the ODI World Cup final in November 2023.Shami is expected to return to the Indian team with the first T20I against England at his home ground Eden Gardens on Wednesday. He has also been selected for the ODI Champions Trophy squad.""Country ke liye jo khelne ki bhoonkh hai woh kabhi khatam nahin honi chahiye.

Because once I leave cricket, I may never get this chance again),"" he added.Shami emphasised that a sportsperson can overcome multiple injury setbacks as long as they have an insatiable hunger to play for their country.He was speaking at the Cricket Association of Bengal's felicitation ceremony for the victorious Under-15 women's cricketers at Eden Gardens.""It has never happened that players who represent their state or country think about leaving the game after an injury.

Shami added.Shami, who missed significant events such as the T20 World Cup and the five-match Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test series, emphasised that overcoming injuries is an integral part of an athlete's journey.""If you are hardworking and committed, no injury can keep you away for too long. You will always find a way to return.""Donning the Blue jersey is the highest honour, and he believes every player who plays with loyalty and commitment deserves the opportunity to represent the country.Talking about his deep connection with Eden Gardens, he said, ""The home ground is always special. I started my career here. I've said earlier as well -- though I was born and brought up in Uttar Pradesh, I was made by Bengal. This is my home, my life.""Sharing the stage with cricketing legend Sourav Ganguly and former India women's captains Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami , he expressed heartfelt gratitude for the opportunities earned through sheer dedication.""I have only done one thing -- fulfilled my responsibilities with loyalty.

Axar Patel hints at flexible middle-order ahead of England T20I series

NEW DELHI: England's head coach, Brendon McCullum , known for revolutionising Test cricket with his ultra-aggressive 'Bazball' approach, surprised many on Monday by declaring that England will adopt a ""watchful style of cricket"" in the upcoming limited-overs series against India.This marks McCullum's debut in charge of England's white-ball squad, having achieved remarkable success as their Test coach since May 2022.The five-match T20I series kicks off on Wednesday at Eden Gardens in Kolkata, followed by three ODIs.""I know it's going to be a tough tour, taking on a very good Indian side, but I'm sure we'll play what I hope is a very watchful style of cricket,"" McCullum said during a media interaction in Kolkata.The ODI series is seen as a critical preparatory phase for both teams ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy, scheduled to take place in Pakistan and Dubai from February 19.""We'll use the next few weeks to hit the ground running. There will be times when we don’t quite get it right, but hopefully, we can work through that and be in top shape for the Champions Trophy,"" he added.McCullum, who succeeded Matthew Mott as England's white-ball coach in September, is now balancing dual roles as both Test and limited-overs coach. Despite England’s reputation for power-hitting, McCullum stressed the need to adapt to Indian conditions and leverage their diverse resources.""You won't win every game, but it's about getting the best out of the talent we have, gelling the guys together, and finding complementary skills,"" McCullum noted.England boasts a formidable lineup, with explosive batters, sharp fielders, world-class spinners, and a pace attack capable of unsettling any opponent. McCullum emphasized the importance of blending these strengths effectively to maximize their chances.Skipper Jos Buttler , who led England to the T20 World Cup title in 2022 and was part of their 2019 ODI World Cup-winning squad, has faced challenges in maintaining the team’s dominance in recent months. McCullum, however, expressed full confidence in Buttler’s leadership.""Jos is excited about the team and the opportunities ahead. Leading in the latter part of your career can sometimes feel like a burden, but it can also free you up to enjoy the game and focus on bringing the best out of your teammates,"" McCullum said.The coach predicted a strong resurgence from Buttler, adding, ""I’m sure we’ll see Jos smiling on the field, enjoying himself, and performing at his best.""England’s multi-faceted squad will face a strong Indian team in this high-stakes series, which is expected to provide thrilling encounters and set the tone for the upcoming Champions Trophy.","England coach Brendon McCullum says England will play a 'watchful style of cricket' in T20I series against India.

It was tough because we were in such a tough position early on.""The Super Giants now head back home to Kingsmead for two crucial home matches against MI Cape Town (Tuesday) and Paarl Royals (Thursday).Both Western Cape teams are in form with MI Cape Town heading the table on 14 points with the Royals just two points behind them in second place.Williamson is backing Klaasen to rediscover his form in these two crucial matches for the Super Giants.""He is clearly the best (white-ball) player in the world in my eyes,"" the former New Zealand captain said.""But on some tricky surfaces it is just about complimenting each other as a unit. We know what damage he can do, so we are just trying to use him as best we can.""Williamson also stressed that now is not the time for the Super Giants to retreat and start playing a conservative brand of cricket.""There is a lot of experience in that dressing room and all of us have been in this situation before. And the games come thick and fast. It is just about keeping coming back to the basics and not over-reacting. There are a lot of fantastic players in that dressing room and it's about doing it collectively,"" he said.""Naturally, every game there is the intention to win, but for us is to make those improvements and get nice and clear. Often after a few losses those things are highlighted, it is important for us to play with that freedom and trust the quality in the dressing room.

Champions Trophy Squad: Chief selector Ajit Agarkar and skipper Rohit Sharma PC

NEW DELHI: England coach Brendon McCullum on Monday praised India head coach Gautam Gambhir as a ""strong leader of men"" and expressed confidence in his ability to lead India to success in the near future.Gambhir, who took charge as India's head coach across all formats following the team's title-winning campaign in the T20 World Cup last year, has faced significant criticism after India’s poor performances against New Zealand and Australia.However, McCullum, who previously worked with Gambhir during their time together at Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), voiced his support for his former teammate.""I’ve worked with Gautam before, and I can say he’s an outstanding leader. He’s a really strong leader of men, and in every leadership position he’s held, he has excelled,"" McCullum told reporters in Kolkata.""He’s only just started in this role, but I have no doubt he’ll bring the best out of the talent at his disposal. It’s up to us (England) to find a way to counter his team’s approach with our own style,"" McCullum added.India recently endured a 0-3 whitewash at home against New Zealand and suffered a 1-3 loss to Australia in an away series, derailing their hopes of qualifying for a third consecutive World Test Championship (WTC) final.Gambhir’s tenure also began with India losing a bilateral ODI series to Sri Lanka for the first time in 27 years last August.Despite these setbacks, India secured a series victory against Bangladesh at home under Gambhir's leadership. Throughout his tenure, Gambhir has consistently opposed the ""star culture"" in Indian cricket, prompting the BCCI to introduce a 10-point guideline to promote team unity and accountability.However, his coaching methods have drawn criticism, especially after India lost six of 10 Tests and the ODI series against Sri Lanka under his guidance.Addressing coaching philosophies, McCullum shared his perspective on the varied approaches coaches adopt.""I don’t even know if 'coach' is the right word sometimes,"" McCullum remarked. ""Everyone has their own unique approach to the role.""Explaining his own coaching philosophy, McCullum emphasized the importance of fostering a positive environment.""For me, it’s less about coaching in a traditional sense and more about creating a happy, enjoyable environment where players feel encouraged to push their limits and embrace uncomfortable situations,"" he said.McCullum added that different coaches adopt diverse methods, with some preferring a structured, technical approach, while others operate in a more regimented manner.""It really depends on the individual coach and their style,"" he concluded.McCullum is currently in India with the England team for the upcoming limited-overs series, where his players will face Gambhir's side in what promises to be an exciting contest.",England coach Brendon McCullum praises India head coach Gautam Gambhir.

NEW DELHI: Newly-appointed Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) skipper Rishabh Pant has credited India captain Rohit Sharma , along with other senior players, for shaping his leadership skills.As LSG begins a new chapter, the franchise has placed its faith in Pant, renowned for his fearless batting and commanding presence on the field.Pant, who made his international debut under Virat Kohli in 2017, has also had the privilege of playing alongside the iconic Mahendra Singh Dhoni . Reflecting on his journey, Pant emphasized the value of learning from various leaders.""Yes, I've learned from a lot of captains and many senior players because I believe leadership lessons are not confined to captains alone,"" Pant said after being named LSG captain. ""There’s so much to gain from experienced players and the way they approach the evolving game.""Pant particularly highlighted the influence of Rohit, noting the importance of care and trust in leadership.""With Rohit bhai, I’ve learned how to care for a player, and that resonates with my own philosophy as a captain,"" he explained. ""When you give confidence and trust to a player, he can achieve things beyond imagination for the team.""Pant, who became the most expensive player in IPL history when LSG acquired him for Rs 27 crore, shared his vision for the team.""We’ll back the players, instill trust, and maintain clear communication,"" said Pant, who has previous captaincy experience with Delhi Capitals (DC).Last season, Pant led DC with determination, scoring 446 runs to emerge as the team’s top scorer. However, the franchise fell short of expectations, finishing sixth and missing the playoffs.Pant stressed the importance of fostering a ""never-say-die"" attitude within the LSG squad.""Performance may come and go, but what matters is your fight. Are you giving 100% on the field? Everyone gets tired, but it’s about pushing that extra 20-30% for the team. That’s the culture we want to build.""The 25-year-old will also reunite with former India pace legend Zaheer Khan , who mentored him during his IPL debut in 2016. Zaheer now takes on the role of LSG mentor, succeeding Gautam Gambhir.As LSG embarks on this new journey under Pant’s leadership, his vision of trust, resilience, and character promises to shape a team ready to fight till the last ball.","Rishabh Pant has been named the new captain of Lucknow Super Giants.

NEW DELHI: Rishi Kapoor , the first Delhi footballer to win a national football league title, passed away in a city hospital on Monday. He was 49 and had reportedly been suffering from liver-related issues.Primarily a left-footed midfielder with fine passing ability and a thunderous shot, Kapoor spearheaded Hindustan FC ’s rise in Delhi’s football of the late 1990s and early 2000s, his ability and time on the ball was good enough to catch the attention of the big clubs in the then National Football League and later, the I-League .At a time when the Capital’s footballers were mostly semi-professional and rare on the national clubs’ scene, in 2000, Rishi left to join ITI in Bangalore with ambitions to play in the NFL. Already employed with Delhi Audit , and with ITI mainly an institutional team but times changing in Indian football then, he was one of the first players to be signed on contract by the Bangalore outfit as it rejigged its rules to allow for two outstation players, or ‘guest players’ as they were officially labelled under.It was here that a tweak was made to his positional nature that would immediately further his prospects as a footballer. Partly due to a crowded midfield at ITI, and largely due to his left-footed passing and fondness for playing from the deep, Rishi was converted into a defender at left-back. It may have stifled a bit of his creativity, but his game-reading lent solidity to the defence. His performances at ITI led to Mohun Bagan taking notice.“We’ve lost a very good player today. This is no time to go,” Debjit Ghosh, teammate when Bagan won the title in 2002, told TOI from Kolkata. “When we first saw him at ITI, he was playing as left-back and he really impressed our coach, Subrata Bhattacharya. Much later after we signed him, we realized that he was a natural playmaker, but we needed him in defence. He and I struck up a very fine understanding on the field,” said the ex-India player.Despite a national title and the promise of further professional exposure, Rishi left Bagan to return to Delhi’s Hindustan. “He stayed just one season with us. He wanted to return to keep his job,” remembered Ghosh. It was perhaps this mindset – of saving the job -- that probably cost the Delhi footballer an India call-up. Stephen Constantine, the then India coach, was impressed by Kapoor’s versatility on the left channel, but chose to ignore him because he rightly felt that Delhi’s football didn’t offer a high level of intensity and competitiveness.With his job safe, Kapoor enjoyed brief stints with Salgaocar and Sesa in Goa but always returned to establish himself as an Ambedkar Stadium fixture. A decade later, after his first move, as Delhi football would change character, moving away from the Walled City into the suburbs, Rishi Kapoor would be the symbol of change. Playing for newly-formed Delhi United, he would toy with much-younger footballers, effortlessly doing it even at 35.","Rishi Kapoor, the first Delhi footballer to win a national football league title, passed away in a city hospital on Monday.

Darwin Nunez 's stoppage-time brace secured a crucial 2-0 victory for Liverpool at Brentford , extending their Premier League lead over Arsenal to six points.The Gunners, who were held to a 2-2 draw by Aston Villa after squandering a two-goal advantage, have seen their title challenge falter once more.Despite Liverpool's wastefulness in front of goal, Nunez came off the bench to make a significant impact, scoring his first Premier League goals since November.The Uruguayan striker finished off a neat one-two between Harvey Elliott and Trent Alexander-Arnold before smashing in a second goal, with Elliott providing the assist.""As a striker you get judged on goals, especially at a club like Liverpool,"" said the Reds' captain Virgil van Dijk.

Griezmann blows penalty

Barcelona were held to a 1-1 draw by Getafe in La Liga on Saturday, failing to make up ground on the top two teams in the Spanish title race.Jules Kounde gave Barcelona an early lead, but Mauro Arambarri equalised for Getafe in the first half, and the Catalans were unable to break down Jose Bordalas' well-organised team.The draw leaves Barcelona in third place, five points behind league leaders Atletico Madrid, who suffered a 1-0 defeat at Leganes earlier in the day.Despite winning the Spanish Super Cup last week and thrashing Real Betis in the Copa del Rey, suggesting a return to form after a slump in late 2024, Barcelona dropped two points on the road in their first league match of 2025 against 16th-placed Getafe.""It's not done yet, we still have some matches to play and as I said before, we will fight until the end,"" Flick told reporters.""Today it's one point more, not two points less. We missed (out on) two points, but we have to look forwards and make it better next time.""Flick fielded his strongest side in recent weeks, hoping to secure a result at Getafe, where Barcelona had failed to score in their previous four away visits.The Blaugrana ended that streak in the ninth minute when Kounde, who also scored in the midweek Copa del Rey win against Real Betis, was cleverly set up by Pedri and scored on the rebound after David Soria saved his initial effort.However, Barcelona faced the same difficulties they have often encountered at the Coliseum, with Getafe digging in and denying top scorer Robert Lewandowski any space.Getafe equalized in the 34th minute when Coba's shot was parried by Barcelona goalkeeper Inaki Pena, and Arambarri pounced to score.The hosts maintained their tight defensive setup in the second half, making life difficult for Barcelona.Raphinha missed a golden opportunity to win the game for Barca in the closing minutes, hitting the side netting from close range after being found by Lamine Yamal's cross.""It was a shame, the match, we had control of the game and with one chance they scored one goal against us, it's a shame,"" Kounde told Movistar.After the match, Barcelona defender Alejandro Balde reported being subjected to racist abuse from some home supporters during the first half.On Sunday, Spanish and European champions Real Madrid, currently second in La Liga, host Las Palmas with the aim of moving to the top of the table.In another surprise result, league leaders Atletico Madrid suffered a shock defeat at Leganes, ending their club record run of 15 consecutive victories.Matija Nastasic headed Leganes in front early in the second half, and Antoine Griezmann missed a late penalty, dragging his effort wide, as Atletico fell to their second league defeat of the season.""I thought we were low on energy, it wasn't enough from us,"" Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak told DAZN.""We'll keep our head up after (winning) 15 games, we lost this one and we have to keep going forwards... unfortunately the streak is over.""Leganes, 15th in the table, defended well to keep Atletico at bay in the first half, with Julian Alvarez and Griezmann hitting the woodwork.Nastasic's header from a corner put Leganes ahead early in the second half, and they protected their lead without much trouble until controversially conceding a penalty for a debatable handball by Sergio Gonzalez.Griezmann took responsibility from the spot but rolled his 90th-minute effort wide of the goal.Atletico must now regroup in the Champions League, where they aim to reach the knockout rounds, as they face Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday.""They were 15 extraordinary games, I feel enormously proud at having set the (consecutive) winning record in Atletico's history,"" Atletico coach Diego Simeone told DAZN.""We have to accept that defeat is part of the game and prepare ourselves for Tuesday.""","Barcelona held to a 1-1 draw by Getafe in La Liga on Saturday. Jules Kounde gave Barcelona an early lead, but Mauro Arambarri equalised. Barcelona in third place, five points behind league leaders Atletico Madrid. Atletico lost 1-0 at Leganes, ending their club record run of 15 consecutive victories.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117365968,imgsize-154732,width-400,resizemode-4/117365968.jpg"
