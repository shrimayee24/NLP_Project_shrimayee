NEW DELHI: As the highly anticipated Border-Gavaskar Test series between India and Australia approaches, Australian off-spinner Nathan Lyon has already begun preparing to face India's rising batting star, Yashasvi Jaiswal . The series, which comprises five Tests, is set to start on November 22.Lyon, with an impressive record, is diligently studying Jaiswal, who has emerged as a crucial player for India following a remarkable debut and exceptional performances.Yashasvi Jaiswal made a sensational Test debut with a century against the West Indies last year and followed it up with a stunning 712 runs in a five-Test series against England earlier this year. However, the 21-year-old batsman will encounter new challenges on Australia's fast and bouncy pitches, which have traditionally tested visiting batsmen.""I haven't come across him [Jaiswal] yet, but that will be a massive challenge for all us bowlers,"" Lyon was quoted as saying by ESPNcricinfo. ""The way he played against England, I watched that quite closely and thought that was quite amazing.""The experienced spinner shared that he has been discussing strategies with England's left-arm spinner Tom Hartley, who played against India in the recent series, gaining direct experience bowling to Jaiswal.

Lyon emphasized the importance of turning the tide, especially on home soil.""It's been ten years of unfinished business, it's been a long time, and I know we're extremely hungry to turn things around, especially here at home,"" he said. ""Don't get me wrong, India is an absolute superstar side and extremely challenging, but I'm extremely hungry to turn things around and make sure we get that trophy back.""Lyon also highlighted the difference in the current Australian team under Pat Cummins compared to previous sides that lost to India.""We feel like we are a different team to a couple of years ago. We are on a journey of becoming a great Australian cricket team. We're definitely not there, but we are along that journey and have been playing some decent cricket,"" Lyon concluded.With both teams determined to prove their superiority, the upcoming series promises to be another thrilling chapter in the storied India-Australia rivalry.","Nathan Lyon has begun preparing to face India's rising batting star, Yashasvi Jaiswal.

Sitting outside, it surprises you as a coach as well.

Hopefully at the US Open I can reach even higher levels.”Sabalenka quickly established a commanding 4-1 lead in the opening set against Pegula, taking just 17 minutes to assert her dominance. Despite Pegula's efforts to mount a comeback, including breaking Sabalenka's serve for the first time to level the second set at 5-5, her five double faults proved costly.Sabalenka, however, remained focused and determined, claiming the next two games to secure victory in a match that lasted 1 hour and 14 minutes.“She was playing at a high level and never really came down,” Pegula said. “When she’s serving really well, it’s tough, especially on these fast courts.”Pegula, the sixth-ranked player, faced a tough journey to reach the final. Following her successful title defense in Toronto, the American had to play two matches on Friday due to delays caused by weather conditions. Additionally, three of her matches extended to three sets.“I'm proving to myself that I can play a lot of matches and overcome a lot of challenges,” Pegula said. “I'm looking forward to not doing anything for a few days.""Sabalenka joined top-ranked Iga Swiatek as the only players with 10 or more WTA titles since 2020.

These matches were held in Lahore.In 2017, eight years after the Lahore attack, Sri Lanka returned to Pakistan for a solitary T20I match, which was the final game of their three-match series.

But can Australia play without Nathan Lyon ? Will India play without either Ashwin or Ravindra Jadeja ? No, they won't.

His fitness and off-the-field issues were highlighted, and because of that, you’ve spoiled that boy and harmed Pakistan,” Akmal asserted.The decision to drop Abrar ahead of the Test match has also drawn criticism from other former cricketers.

Despite creating numerous chances, Spurs were unable to capitalize on their opportunities, leaving manager Ange Postecoglou frustrated with his team's profligacy.In a surprising turn of events, Jamie Vardy , who had been expected to miss the match due to a pre-season injury, came off the bench to score the equalizer for Leicester.The 37-year-old striker's header was a testament to his enduring goal-scoring instincts, particularly against Tottenham, having now scored nine Premier League goals in 17 appearances against them.Tottenham's failure to convert their chances proved costly, as they were left to rue their missed opportunities and lack of composure in front of goal. The result highlighted the need for Postecoglou's side to be more clinical in their finishing if they are to achieve their objectives this season.Postecoglou's inaugural season at Tottenham concluded with the club securing a fifth-place finish. The Australian manager's unwavering dedication to an aggressive, offensive style of play ultimately proved detrimental, as it cost the team a spot in the Champions League.Tottenham's performance was once again hindered by a combination of subpar finishing and a lack of defensive concentration.Dominic Solanke, who recently joined the club from Bournemouth in a transfer that could potentially reach £65 million ($84 million), was particularly at fault during his debut match.""Disappointing night for us. First half excellent and controlled the game but wasteful in front of goal. Once Leicester scored, the crowd lifted and we lost our composure,"" Postecoglou said.""It was an issue we had last year as well. We need to keep working hard and be a bit more ruthless in front of goal. At times we made poor decisions. The dominance is great but if you don't score it is meaningless. We have to be stronger in our mindset in the front third. To be that wasteful is disappointing. We just weren't clinical.""Leicester have secured their return to the Premier League following their Championship victory, concluding their brief one-season hiatus from the top flight.As speculation swirls about potential points deductions due to alleged financial rule breaches, newly appointed manager Cooper faces the urgent task of ensuring a strong start to the campaign. Relegation avoidance is the primary objective, and the team's resolute performance in this match serves as a promising beginning to that end.""I was as fit as a fiddle until I got to about 65 minutes if I'm honest!"" Vardy said.""Tottenham are a really good team but we have them too much respect. We started getting after them and it changed the momentum.""When we are at the top of our game we can give anyone a run for their money.""Tottenham nearly took the lead in the opening stages when Rodrigo Bentancur's shot was cleared off the line by Wilfred Ndidi, and Brennan Johnson's powerful follow-up was saved by Mads Hermansen.Solanke directed a diving header straight at Hermansen, while Cristian Romero narrowly missed the target with a header from Porro's cross.Solanke challenged Hermansen again with another headed effort, and Tottenham's persistent pressure paid off in the 29th minute.James Maddison delivered a perfectly weighted cross into the Leicester box, and Porro's well-timed run allowed him to guide a header into the far corner from 12 yards out.Maddison almost provided another assist moments later with a superb cross that Johnson fired narrowly wide.Solanke missed a golden opportunity early in the second half, firing his shot directly at Hermansen, who also managed to parry Bentancur's attempt from close range.Tottenham paid the price for their profligacy in the 57th minute when Leicester scored with their first shot on target. The Spurs defenders were caught napping as Vardy was left unmarked in the six-yard box to head in Abdul Fatawu's cross.It was exactly the kind of sloppy goal that bedevilled Tottenham during their swoon in the closing weeks of last season.Vardy nearly capitalized on more disorganized defending from Tottenham, latching onto Bobby Decordova-Reid's pass, but he couldn't find the precision needed to beat Guglielmo Vicario.Bentancur was left lying face down on the field following a clumsy collision. He received medical attention for seven minutes, which included being administered oxygen, before being carried off on a stretcher to be assessed for a possible concussion.The incident left Tottenham visibly unsettled.

The match, which was interrupted by rain on Thursday night during the second-set tiebreaker, concluded with Monfils claiming victory by scores of 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4.Alcaraz, visibly frustrated, repeatedly smashed his racket on the court, a rare display of emotion from the young star.""I felt like it was the worst match that I've ever played on my career,"" Alcaraz said. ""I've been practicing really well. I was feeling great. But I couldn't play. I want to forget it and try to move on to New York.""The U.S. Open , the next major tournament on the calendar, is set to commence on Aug. 26 in New York City.Despite the rain delay and the opportunity for a fresh start on Friday, Alcaraz, ranked No. 3 in the ATP rankings, struggled to regain his composure and control his emotions on the court.""It never happened before, because I could control those feelings,"" Alcaraz said. ""Today I couldn't. I was feeling that I was not playing any kind of tennis. It was really frustrating for me. At some point, I didn't want to be on the court anymore.""This loss comes on the heels of Alcaraz's silver medal performance at the Paris Olympics , where he was defeated by Novak Djokovic , who also bested him in last year's Cincinnati final.Monfils, who advanced to the next round, later faced No. 15 seed Holger Rune on the same day, ultimately losing 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.""It was a big win for me against Carlos, unexpected to be honest,"" Monfils said.

""I couldn't play.""I don't know what happened. Honestly, I couldn't, I couldn't control myself. I couldn't be better. It was impossible to win, and that's all.""The Spaniard added: ""I came here thinking I'm going to feel good. I'm going to put in a good tennis, because I know how to play on this court.""Alcaraz claimed that this match was the first time he had ever broken a racquet out of rage.The 2023 Cincinnati runner-up and current ATP number three is without a hardcourt victory going into next Monday's US Open, having only played one second-round summer cement match thus far.""It's really difficult to find some goodstuffs from this match -- I want to forget it and try to move on to New York,"" he said.""I'll try to practice well, to get used to those courts.

The Canadian hit 14 aces in the victory.Iga Swiatek , the top-seeded woman, easily defeated Marta Kostyuk 6-2, 6-2 to advance to the quarterfinals for the second time this season.The Pole is currently 3-0 in the rivalry without dropping a set after backing up her victory against the Ukrainian at Indian Wells in March of last year.Swiatek entered the court without following her customary warm-up regimen due to the rainy morning, but she appeared unaffected.After having to battle through three sets to defeat Varvara Gracheva in the previous round, Swiatek was able to wrap up the match with ease.In thirty-one minutes, Swiatek won the first set, and she breezed through the second.""I'm happy that I kept my intensity, in the first match, it got a little bit down,"" Swiatek said. ""But I was ready in every game.""I'm happy I was solid. I was disciplined with all the things that I wanted to take care of.""The number one added: ""I don't really care what my result is going to be here, just trying to do the work.""In her fourth quarterfinal at Cincinnati, third seed and three-time semifinalist Aryna Sabalenka defeated Monfils's wife, Elina Svitolina, 7-5, 6-2.The sixth seed Jessica Pegula defeated 2023 runner-up Karolina Muchova 5-7, 6-4, 6-2 in a postponed second-round match.Mother of two Caroline Wozniacki lost to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 7-5, 6-4 while continuing her WTA comeback attempt.Magdalena Frech of Poland lost to Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen 6-1, 7-5.
