Donovan Mitchell’s team the Cleveland Cavaliers is close to reaching LeBron James



Donovan Mitchell has the utmost respect for LeBron James



The Cavaliers are dominating the 2024-25 NBA season under their leading man Donovan Mitchell . They have a record of 33 wins and only 4 losses. Only the Boston Celtics in the tough competition in the Eastern Conference, are sitting in the 2nd position aiming to climb up to the top. Micthell's solid form with the support of players like Darius Garland and Evan Mobley has put the Cavs at the top of the standings chart. This record is closer to LeBron James ' 2008-2009 Cavs run. Now, as they are inches away from surpassing James’ record, the Cavs are on a different game altogether hoping to lift the 2025 NBA title.The Cleveland Cavaliers have made a strong impact in the 2024-25 NBA season with their star player Donovan Mitchell leading the team. They’ve been a dominant force in the East with a stunning 33-4 record. Their 20-1 home record is also astonishing as they are closer to matching the legendary 2008-2009 Cavs team led by LeBron James. With James, the Cavs were at 20-0 after 20 games in the NBA. However, the current Cavs will not surpass James' record as they have played more games to reach the number.Mitchell has been outstanding, averaging 22.9 points, 4.4 rebounds and 4.6 assists, with 45 field goal percentage.On offense, the Cavs are one of the leading teams in the league with a 122.0 offensive rating, while their defense ranks 7th. Several other stars in the team have also contributed to the overall gameplay which includes, Darius Garland, Evan Mobley, and Jarrett Allen. The Cavs are playing their best basketball since LeBron’s departure in 2018 and are now strong contenders for the 2025 NBA title.Still, there is a lot of work to be done, at least, Mitchell has his reasons to believe so. Recently, the 28-year-old guard shared his thoughts on the Cavaliers' strong start to the 2024-25 season. While the Cavs hold the best record in the NBA and lead the East, Mitchell asserted that there is a long way to go. “We’re playing good basketball, but can we be this team consistently? Can we be this team when we lose two or three in a row? Can we be this team in the dog days right before the All-Star break? How long can we sustain? That’s the challenge,” Mitchell said of his team.Regardless, Mitchell is fully focused on pushing the team to the limit with head coach Kenny Atkinson’s rigorous guidance. As for LeBron James’ LA Lakers, they have been under scrutiny for their devastating performances in their recent games.Mitchell and James are on-court rivals, however, the Cavaliers guard has the utmost respect for the Lakers legend, James. After beating the Lakers with 122-110 on New Year's Eve, Mitchell showered praise for James’ performance as James scored 23 points and 7 assists in the game. ""You respect his availability, his resilience,"" Mitchell hailed the King with appreciation.Also Read: Los Angeles Lakers Legend LeBron James Reacts to California Wildfire Crisis He added, ""You look at his career, he's done so much, and there's so many you pick from, but the biggest thing to me is he's always there no matter what.

He added recalling days of his inspiration when James was in the Cavs.","Cleveland Cavaliers have a 33-4 record in the 2024-25 NBA season. This record is closer to LeBron James'2008-2009 Cavs run.

Seth Rollins Opens Up About His Anger and Frustration with CM Punk's Return,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/seth-rollins-opens-up-about-his-anger-and-frustration-with-cm-punk-return/articleshow/117130080.cms,"Credits: WWE/Getty Images

Seth Rollins Reveals the Real Reasons Behind His Emotional Outburst



Rollins didn't mince words when discussing the incident that was captured on camera, which showed him having, well, a tantrum, in an interview with Chris Van Vliet. For him, the purpose of Survivor Series was to commemorate Randy Orton 's successful comeback following an 18-month hiatus brought on by a severe back injury. But Rollins found it annoying that punk's resurgence took center stage. It's crucial to remember that, both from a plot point of view and outside of the ring, Rollins does appear to have sincere resentment toward punk:

Although the wrestling community was shocked by CM Punk 's unexpected return to the WWE at Survivor Series 2023, it was clear at the time that not everyone was overjoyed to see the Second City Saint back in the squared circle. One of WWE's biggest stars, Seth Rollins , recently shared his now-viral response to Punk's entrance, providing additional context for why he wasn't exactly showing off for his erstwhile rival.There are many people who disagree with punk, and his strong beliefs have made him both adored and despised by his peers. His ten-year absence from WWE was characterized by his refusal to return calls from former coworkers, his wish to disassociate himself from Vince McMahon 's organization after a very contentious exit that also included a legal battle, and the fact that Punk received his release documents the day of his wedding.He said, “You know what I wasn’t happy about was Randy had just come back from a long hiatus. That was his moment. It was a great moment. The reaction for him when he came through the curtain was unreal. We went out there, there was 10 of us out there, and we went out there and had a hell of a contest. [We] just didn’t really need him, but you know, it was Chicago, it’s his city, it’s just the most classic make everything about me CM Punk moment I’ve ever seen.""Rollins defeated The Judgment Day and Drew McIntyre in a vicious WarGames match at the Survivor Series event with the help of Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes, Jey Uso, and Sami Zayn . After the nearly hour-long match, Rollins acknowledged that his emotions were running high. He and his teammates were basking in the crowd's glow when Punk's return was a shock to them:He further stated, “Then that happens and it’s no longer about the performance. It’s no longer about Randy. It’s no longer about what you had done to get to that point. It’s just, hi guys, it’s about me. Remember I’m the guy that you that you miss, remember me, guys? So yeah, just another kind of throw that on the pile of disgusting CM Punk moments. But don’t worry, he’s not selfish. He’s in it for helping everybody else.""ALSO READ: Ex WWE Chairman Vince McMahon Makes $1.3 Million SEC Settlement Payment For all of us who want to watch them battle, Punk's post-match press conference addressed their animosity, acknowledging their lengthy history and implying that Rollins might not let the past be forgotten anytime soon.

Dan Patrick on Tom Brady's 10-year Fox Sports broadcasting gig

Former SportsCenter anchor and host of The Dan Patrick Show, Dan Patrick, was concerned about Tom Brady two months into his 10-year Fox Sports broadcasting gig, calling the arrangement with the six-time Super Bowl winner ""problematic."" Patrick's warning was not designed to generate content for his listeners. The Las Vegas Raiders have indicated that Brady, who is a minority owner, will have a huge say in choosing the team's new head coach and the quarterback successor to the Aidan O'Connell, Gardner Minshew, quarterbacks room issue.Tom Brady's signing a 10-year deal with FOX to call NFL games on television led many to wonder if he'd ever coach again. Now that he's become a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, a team needing a new coach and a plan for the future, assimilation into his new announcing gig only fuels more doubt about his future.Dan Patrick recently discussed the common rumor that Brady will jump ship after announcing the upcoming Super Bowl in New Orleans, highlighting the increasing frequency of such speculations on his Wednesday show. “I just see Brady as a one-and-done,"" he said. ""He does the Super Bowl, and he decides he’s going to be more involved with the Raiders. I just don’t see Tom sort of one foot in and one foot out with the Raiders. He’s too much of a competitor. And it’s one thing, you can compete in this business, like I compete with myself every day. We compete with ourselves each day, but this is different.”He added, “These are wins and losses with Tom. And creating something, building something. And I think that would probably intrigue him, as opposed to being a broadcaster. I mean, Tom can be at a certain level, and he knows that there’ll just be people who don’t like him just because he’s Tom Brady, or he beat their team, or whatever it might be.""He continued, “Tom is competing against Tom. And I don’t know if he gets the same kind of adrenaline rush. Now, he will. When you do a playoff game, when you do a Super Bowl, Tom’s gonna be like, ‘Oh my God, that was awesome,’ but it’s still not that awesome of playing in it or you’re part of a team. He’s used to winning and losing,” said Patrick. “And if you get done with a show, only you decide if you’ve won or lost. ‘Hey, how did I sound?’ ‘Was that good?’ This is different with the Raiders.”Also Read: The iconic quarterback-coach duo of Tom Brady and Bill Belichick might reunite, this time with the Las Vegas Raiders Tom Brady is expected to return for a second season on Fox, despite the potential stigma if he does all of his hype in one season.

Poll Should Rohit Sharma Lead India in the 2025 Champions Trophy? No, Focus Only on Opening and Building a Strong Partnership Yes, Captain and Open for the Team

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

NEW DELHI: From the high of winning the T20 World Cup in June to being severely criticised and viciously trolled by the end of the year and his spot in the Test team being questioned, Rohit Sharma has seen the extremes of cricket in just six months.But all said and done, the Indian captain has been a white-ball colossus and with the ICC Champions Trophy set to get underway from February 19, Rohit is expected to have a shot at redemption.One-day cricket is the go-to game for Rohit - the only cricketer in the world to smash three double hundreds in the format and one among six Indians to score 10,000 ODI runs.And before the Champions Trophy , India will play a three-match ODI series against England and that will give Rohit adequate match practice and assess his gameplan before the ICC tournament.Rohit had led India from the front in the 2023 ODI World Cup, finishing the tournament as the second-highest run scorer (597 runs) after Virat Kohli (765 runs).The flying starts that Rohit gave with the bat at the top of the order was one of the reasons for India's unbeaten streak right through to the final.Under Rohit, the team played so well that even though India fell at the final hurdle against Australia, there was hardly any criticism for the brand of ODI cricket played by Rohit and his men throughout the tournament.In the Champions Trophy, Rohit has played 10 matches scoring 481 runs at an average of 53.44 and a strike rate of 82.50. His lone hundred in the tournament was an unbeaten 123 that came against Bangladesh at Birmingham in the 2017. He has also hit four half-centuries in the two editions that he played (2013 and 2017).But Rohit's mindset will be a crucial element in his ability to fight back and succeed in the Champions Trophy Rohit has a proven track record in ODIs and he will not only have to trust his natural timing and shot-making ability, but would also look to dominate bowlers once he's set and that will keep him motivated as the inning progresses.By staying calm and not letting external pressures - like criticism or expectations - affect his game, Rohit will be able to build patiently rather than go for quick fixes and 50 overs will give him ample time to do that.As captain, leading from the front with consistent performances will boost his, and the team's, morale and staying mentally strong for the team's sake would reinforce his sense of responsibility.There is no doubt that by maintaining a positive, resilient, and fearless mindset, Rohit can fight back and dominate ODI cricket once again. His ability to focus on the process, adapt to challenges, and channel his hunger for runs will be critical in reclaiming his top form in the Champions Trophy.Cricket is a game of highs and lows, and Rohit's experience has taught him to treat both success and failure equally and he understands that some failures won't define his career, but consistent efforts will.",Rohit Sharma is the only cricketer in the world to smash three double hundreds in the format.

Taylor Swift Shocks Everyone By Setting A Record Without Any Promotions



Taylor Swift And Travis Kelce Are In Kansas City



Travis Kelce, the highest paid tight end in the NFL is currently busy as he has set his eyes on winning the Super Bowl Championship for his team, the Kansas City Chiefs. Away from the NFL, Taylor Swift, Travis’ billionaire girlfriend is busy breaking records. Taylor recently released her Lover (Live From Paris) heart shaped vinyl and it broke records by selling 200,000 copies just in the U.S. over two days.While neither Taylor nor her team has confirmed the number of copies they have been able to sell, as per reports, Taylor broke “single-week vinyl sales of any other artist” in history. Currently, no more copies are available as Taylor’s fans had flocked to get their copy as soon as it went live on Tuesday. This has sparked a frenzy among fans as Taylor continues to break records.A fan wrote, “Oh y’all have been craving for that heart shaped vinyl HARD😭”, another fan wrote, “Considering there was like no promotion for this it’s safe to say it’s a good testament to Taylor and her legacy.”As per reports, fans will start receiving their Lover (Live From Paris) vinyl on 20th January. Taylor had held a concert in Paris back in 2019 and was set to hold more tours in 2020 but lockdown changed her plans. The Lover (Live From Paris) vinyl contains 8 versions of songs from the album “Lover” which was recorded in Paris in 2019.But for Taylor, this is not something new. In the last couple of years, the NFL star, Travis’ billionaire pop star girlfriend, Taylor Swift continues to break and make new records. While neither Taylor nor her team have released statements about the massive success that Taylor has achieved, fans have taken the internet by storm and continue to laud Taylor for her talent.Taylor has taken a break from her career since the legendary Eras Tour has been “exhausting” for her. While she moved to her $50 million apartment in New York City for the last few days in December, as per reports, to welcome the new year, Taylor accompanied Travis and flew with him to Travis' $6 million mansion in Kansas City.It seems like for the rest of the 2024 NFL season, Taylor might be spending all her time in Kansas City so that she can be there for her boyfriend, Travis Kelce and provide him the support, care and comfort that he needs to focus on the 2024 NFL playoffs and wins the Super Bowl Championship for his team, the Kansas City Chiefs.Fans are speculating that Taylor might be releasing her album Reputation (Taylor Swift Version) pretty soon but Taylor has not confirmed her next project.Also Read: Travis Hunter’s supporter 'warns' those who attack him for his relationship with fiancée Leanna Lenee, but it leads to heated backlash from fans","Taylor Swift recently released her Lover (Live From Paris) heart shaped vinyl and it broke records by selling 200,000 copies just in the U.S. over two days.

WATCH

The second match of this SA20 season on Friday ended in a pulsating last-ball finish, which saw Durban's Super Giants (DSG) holding nerve to beat Pretoria Capitals (PC) by just two runs at Kingsmead. But before that, there was a moment in the stands that stole the thunder.In the 17th over of DSG's innings bowled by Eathan Bosch, Kane Williamson got down on one knee to smash the ball into the stands behind deep mid-wicket for a six, but it was the one-handed catch by a fan that became a bigger hit than Williamson's maximum, as it fetched him share of the prize money in ‘Catch a Million’ competition announced by the tournament's title sponsor.According to the rules of the compeition, spectators above the age of 18 who take a clean one-handed catch off a six will walk away with a share of one million rand. But if the fan taking the catch is a client of the title sponsor prior to the match, their prize money is doubled.Such was the quality of the catch that commentator Mark Nicholas exclaimed: ""Has he played the game? Triple it (the winning amount) if he has played the game...That is proper!""Coming to the match, PC opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz's blistering 89 off 43 balls, including 7 sixes, and his 154-run opening stand with Will Jacks (64 off 35) laid the foundation required to go past DSG's 209 for 4, but the remaining PC batters couldn't score a mere 56 needed off the last 47 balls with nine wickets in hand.Requiring 14 off the last over to win, PC could score just 11 to finish at 207 for 6, losing by a mere two runs.Afghanistan spinner Noor Ahmad (2 for 34) and England pacer Chris Woakes (2 for 42) brought DSG back in the match after Gurbaz and Jacks's big opening stand had set up the big run-chase.",Durban's Super Giants (DSG) beat Pretoria Capitals (PC) by just two runs at Kingsmead.

Brittany Mahomes Impresses With Fitness Dedication Days Before Delivering Baby No. 3



Credit: Instagram

The Kansas City Chiefs have locked out a postseason advantage that most teams dream about, much like they did last year: a top seed in the AFC. The Chiefs secured their bye and guaranteed homefield with a 29-10 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates in Week 17. Although it may be the last game of the season, this extra time to prepare for the playoffs will benefit players like Patrick Mahomes, who currently faces enormous pressure to guide his team to a third straight Super Bowl while also dealing with exciting life changes.Quarterback Patrick Mahomes is reaping the benefits of Andy Reid's strategic decision to rest most starters in the Week 18 game against the Denver Broncos. This move effectively granted Mahomes two weeks of recovery before their playoff run begins. However, the Chiefs’ trip to Denver wasn’t without drama. A severe winter storm forced the team to stay overnight, leaving Mahomes understandably anxious as his wife, Brittany Mahomes , was nearing her due date.CBS Sports' Tracy Wolfson captured the sentiment, sharing on January 6, ""No one happier to get back to KC than Patrick Mahomes. He told me his wife Brittany is due to give birth to their 3rd child on Sunday. If she doesn’t give birth by then she will be induced Monday. There was def extra motivation for Patrick to get that bye week!""Despite being just days away from delivering their third child, Brittany proved her resilience and dedication to fitness. Her trainer, Kirsty Rae, shared a video of Brittany performing weighted squats. She captioned the post, ""baddie mama @brittany lynne.""Rae noted that this isn't for everyone so soon before their due date. ""When done safely, strength training during pregnancy is one of the most powerful things you can do.""The Mahomes family already have two children, Sterling Skye, 3, and Patrick “Bronze” Lavon, 2, alongside their two dogs, Silver and Steele. Fans are speculating whether their third child’s name will follow the metallic theme, with “Goldie” being a popular guess.While Patrick is focused on leading the Chiefs in their quest for a historic Super Bowl three-peat, Brittany has been actively raising awareness about relief efforts for those affected by wildfires in Los Angeles. Through her Instagram stories, she shared information on organizations working to provide aid, encouraging others to contribute.Also Read: ""Playing with someone’s name won’t be tolerated"": Patriots Drama Escalates as Jerod Mayo’s Wife Claps Back at ‘all the lies’ After Husband’s Firing The wildfires have also impacted the NFL, causing the Los Angeles Rams and Minnesota Vikings Wild Card game to relocate from SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles to Arizona.As the Chiefs prepare for their postseason campaign, Mahomes remains driven, not just by football but also by the joy of expanding his family. If all goes as planned, he may soon celebrate becoming a father of three while leading his team to another Super Bowl victory.","Patrick Mahomes' wife, Brittany, is just days away from giving birth to their third child.

Jimmy Butler and Pat Riley’s Relationship Turned Sour Last Year

The strained relationship between Jimmy Butler and Pat Riley isn’t new. Things have been going sour ever since Riley refused to grant Butler a contract extension over the summer. Butler is now looking forward to being traded by the February 6 deadline and is currently serving a seven-game suspension. Amidst all this, Butler has been spending a lot of time at his newly opened coffee shop called “Bigface”.In a short clip currently making the rounds on social media, Jimmy Butler was seen patting his barista on the back. While doing so, he said, “See, I gave you a compliment. That’s what bosses do. They build you up, they don’t break you down.” Fans believe that Butler’s comment was a subtle shot at Miami Heat president Pat Riley.During last year’s playoffs, Jimmy Butler missed several playoff games as he was dealing with an MCL injury. While addressing his missed games, Butler mentioned that if he had been on the court both the New York Knicks and the Boston Celtics would’ve been eliminated from the playoffs.Heat president Pat Riley did not take kindly to Butler’s comments and called him out saying, “If you're not on the court playing against Boston or on the court playing against the New York Knicks, you should keep your mouth shut.” This is where it all went wrong between Pat Riley and Jimmy Butler. Shortly afterward, Riley also denied Butler a contract extension over the summer.Before this entire debacle, Butler had been the Heat’s best player ever since Dwyane Wade decided to hang up his boots for good. He led the team to two NBA Finals appearances in 2020 and 2023 and was still disrespected by Pat Riley. If it wasn’t for Butler, the Heat might’ve been eliminated in the first round of the playoffs both times.It is also worth noting that it was Butler who eliminated the Boston Celtics during the 2023/24 playoffs. When Butler wasn’t on the floor for next year’s playoffs, the Celtics eliminated the Heat en route to the NBA Championship. Despite all this, he failed to land a contract extension this past summer. Now, Butler is desperate to take his talents to another team and has been taking subtle shots at Pat Riley.ALSO READ: Jimmy Butler Trade Rumor: 6x NBA All-Star opens up about his preferred future teams as trade tensions escalate, Memphis Grizzlies gets a hard pass Fans had been speculating that Butler would return to the Heat following his seven-game suspension.

It’ll be interesting to see where Jimmy Butler lands if the Heat trade him before the February 6 deadline.",Jimmy Butler and Pat Riley's relationship has been going sour ever since Riley refused to grant Butler a contract extension over the summer.

Travis Kelce opened up about the $14,069 NFL fine

Tony Gonzalez , a legendary tight end in NFL history, achieved 15,127 receiving yards, 1,325 receptions, and 111 touchdowns. His iconic goal post dunk celebration was banned by the NFL after his retirement, leaving fans nostalgic for a simpler era of celebratory football. Travis Kelce , who has redefined the tight end position with over 12,000 receiving yards and seven consecutive 1,000-yard seasons, decided to pay homage to Gonzalez with the move. As a result of the lighthearted moment that mixed two eras of NFL glory, Kelce was fined for the joke that came from Jon Runyan's adoration of the number 69.Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce was expecting punishment after celebrating his Christmas Day Game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Kelce's 77th career touchdown on December 25 passed Tony Gonzalez for the most receiving touchdowns in Chiefs franchise history , surpassing Hall of Famer.All-Pro tight end Kelce honored the Chiefs icon by dunking the football on the crossbar after scoring a historic touchdown, a gesture that was a special way to commemorate his historic feat. The league eventually fined Kelce $14,069 for his celebration. It was deemed unsportsmanlike conduct after the Chiefs star used the crossbar as a prop.Kelce discussed an incident on his ""New Heights"" podcast with his brother, Jason Kelce, stating that he was ""of course"" punished by the NFL for his antics. He said, ""They said since I touched the goal post it was a fine."" Kelce admitted that his dunk did not go as planned and that it wasn't his best moment.""I was trying to get my (expletive) old ass up there, man,"" Kelce said. ""Fourth quarter of the game, my (expletive) legs are tired after a 10-play drive. ... I'm just like, 'Screw it, I'm gonna send it one time for old time's sake.'""... That was me slapping the backboard. That wasn't me actually flushing it.""In November, Gonzalez offered Kelce a fine if he dunked the ball, but Kelce declined, stating that while he appreciated the gesture, there was no need for the same. ""Tony, you don't have to do that, dude,"" Kelce said on the podcast. ""It was so cool to hear you even say it, dude, but you don't have to help me pay that fine.""Also Read: “Dumb frat boy”: Fans trash Travis Kelce claiming he is out of his league to marry superstar Taylor Swift Tony Gonzalez set a record for the greatest tight end of all time, but Kelce is making a strong case for the title.

As the Chiefs prepare for another playoff run, Kelce aims to become the best version of himself.","Travis Kelce was fined $14,069 by the NFL for dunking the football on the crossbar after scoring a touchdown.

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

NEW DELHI: Spin legend Ravichandran Ashwin believes that because Rishabh Pant has ""one of the best defences"" in international cricket, he will make a century in every match if the innovative Indian wicketkeeper-batter can control his extravagance and impetuosity.Ashwin praised Pant's ability to completely change a match on his own, but he claimed that many of his strokes are risky and that this prevents him from reaching his full potential.After a valiant 40 in the opening innings of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy match against Australia in Sydney recently, Pant got the second-fastest Test fifty by an Indian.""We have to tell him properly what he has to do if he has to bat solid or bat with intent. He hasn't scored a lot of runs, but he didn't play like someone without runs. He has a lot of time on his hands. Rishabh Pant is yet to realise his fullest potential,"" said Ashwin on his Youtube channel.""He has all the shots -- reverse sweep, slog sweep, everything -- but the problem is that all these shots are high-risk shots. With his defence, he will surely score runs every game if he faces 200 balls.""The point is finding that middle game. If he combines all of it, he will score 100 runs every game. He has to find that middle game,"" the recently-retired cricketer added.In the first innings of the SCG Test, Pant scored 40 runs off of 98 balls, while in the second innings, he scored 61 runs off of 33 balls. However, the keeper was unable to repeat his feats from the 2020-21 BGT, where he led India to a historic victory in the series-decider at Gabba, which was hitherto renowned as Australia's fortress.Ashwin was not shocked by the keeper's persistent innings in the first essay, even though Pant is known for his propensity to play expansive shots.""I have always grown up hearing that you have fight it out. In Sydney, he played two different knocks in one single game. He got hit everywhere and scored a 40, it will be the least spoken innings of Rishabh Pant. It is very unfair.""In the second innings, he scored a swashbuckling fifty, earning him a lot of praise. Everyone forgot that first innings and praised him for the second knock,"" Ashwin pointed out.Speaking about Pant's defensive style, Ashwin claimed that he is among the greatest. He also seemed to think that the Indian, along with Steve Smith and Joe Root, is one of the best hitters of the past seven years, during which time batting has become ""significantly difficult and averages have decreased.""""We must realise that Rishabh Pant rarely gets out playing a defence. He's got one of the best defences in world cricket. Defence has become a challenging aspect, he has the best defence with a soft hand.""I have bowled to him a lot in the nets, he's not gotten out, he doesn't get an edge, he doesn't get LBW, he has the best defence. I have tried telling it to him. One opinion about Rishabh was that he plays a lot of shots, he has to fight it out in Test cricket ,"" Ashwin said.""Test cricket is playing according to situation. In the last seven years, batting has become significantly difficult, from 2018 to 2025. But, in the WTC cycle , batting averages have decreased.""Joe Root is in his own zone. Of course, Williamson... Smith has rediscovered again. What we realised is, Rishabh Pant has played in these times.""The 38-year-old Ashiwn, who announced his retirement from international cricket in the middle of the BGT, stated that he will still play cricket.""It was about me as an India cricketer, that's over. But Ashwin as a cricketer is not over yet. I feel that there is still some distance for that.""I feel that I can talk about my personal decision over a period of time. In fact, I want to document my entire story as an Indian cricketer.""","Ravichandran Ashwin believes Rishabh Pant has ""one of the best defences"" in international cricket.

A 150-plus opening partnership set up Pretoria Capitals (PC) to chase down Durban Super Giants ' (DSG) gigantic total, but they fell agonisingly short by just two runs in an SA20 last-ball thriller at Kingsmead on Friday. Rahmanullah Gurbaz 's blistering 89 off 43 balls, including 7 sixes, and his 154-run opening stand with Will Jacks (64 off 35) laid the foundation required to go past DSG's 209 for 4, but the remaining PC batters couldn't score a mere 56 needed off the last 47 balls with nine wickets in hand.Instead, DSG bowlers held their nerves to stop PC's chase at 207 for 6 in 20 overs for a two-run win in the second match of the season in Durban.After DSG spinner Noor Ahmad broke the stand with the wicket of his Afghanistan teammate Gurbaz in the 13th over, Chris Woakes struck in the next over to remove skipper Rilee Rossouw for just 1.Noor (2 for 34) and Woakes (2 for 42) got another wicket apiece to put pressure back on PC's run-chase, when they sent back Jacks and Senuran Muthusamy (8), respectively, to make it 183 for 4 in 15.5 overs.Big-hitter Liam Livingstone was the Pretoria's best hope to take them home as the equation, 27 runs needed off 25 balls with six wickets in hand, still favouring PC; but the experienced South African spinner and DSG captain Keshav Maharaj removed Livingstone for 13 and Naveen-ul-Haq sent back James Neesham (3) to bring the game on an even keel.With 14 runs needed off the final over, PC batters could hit only one four in the last six balls and fell short of the target by two runs.Earlier, after DSG won the toss and opted to bat, they were given a solid start by openers Bryce Parsons (47) and Matthew Beetzke (33), who stitched together a partnership of 67 runs.Former New Zealand captain Kane Williamson then held the innings together, after Quinton de Kock (15) and Heinrich Klaaasen (0) fell cheaply.All-rounder Wiaan Mulder (45* off 19 balls) then gave Williamson (60* off 40) the support he was looking for, as the duo added a quickfire 91 runs in the last 6.3 overs to take the total past the 200-run mark.Left-arm spinner Muthusamy bowled a crafty spell of left-arm spin to finish with figures of 3 for 21.","Pretoria Capitals (PC) chase down Durban Super Giants'(DSG) gigantic total, but they fell agonisingly short by just two runs in an SA20 last-ball thriller at Kingsmead on Friday.

ICC issues a statement on Champions Trophy, reveals India-Pakistan arrangement

South Africa's Sports Minister, Gayton McKenzie , has publicly advocated for the South African men's cricket team to boycott their upcoming Champions Trophy match against Afghanistan. The tournament is scheduled for next month in Pakistan. McKenzie's call for a boycott stems from his desire to show solidarity with the women of Afghanistan , who have faced significant restrictions on their freedoms and rights since the Taliban regained control in August 2021.McKenzie expressed his support for the boycott, acknowledging the complexities of Afghanistan's history. He feels a moral obligation to advocate for this stance.“Public support for a boycott was ‘a position that I feel morally bound to support, despite the deep complications of Afghanistan’s recent and tragic history’,” Gayton McKenzie stated.McKenzie highlighted the International Cricket Council 's (ICC) stance against political interference in sports administration, noting its apparent inconsistency regarding Afghanistan. He emphasised that the ultimate decision rests not with him, but with the relevant cricketing authorities.“I am aware that the ICC, like most international sporting mother bodies, professes not to tolerate political interference in the administration of sport, despite its obvious inconsistency with Afghanistan.”Also See: ICC Champions Trophy Full Schedule He clarified his personal position, stating his strong opposition to playing against Afghanistan under the current circumstances.“It is not for me as the sports minister to make the final decision on whether South Africa should honour cricketing fixtures against Afghanistan. If it was my decision, then it certainly would not happen.”McKenzie drew a parallel to South Africa's history of apartheid , explaining his stance against discrimination in sports. He stressed the hypocrisy of ignoring the plight of Afghan women while condemning similar injustices faced by South Africans during apartheid.“As a man who comes from a race that was not allowed equal access to sporting opportunities during Apartheid, it would be hypocritical and immoral to look the other way today when the same is being done towards women anywhere in the world.”Peter Hain, a South African-born anti-apartheid activist and member of the UK House of Lords, penned an open letter to Cricket South Africa (CSA) Chief Executive Pholetsi Moseki. The letter, published by Daily Maverick, highlighted the escalating erosion of women's rights in Afghanistan under Taliban rule.“Sport was only the first joy to be removed from women in Afghanistan, and since then the Taliban have removed their most basic human rights and freedoms on a prolific scale.”Hain detailed the extensive restrictions imposed on Afghan women, including limitations on education, employment, healthcare, and even basic freedoms of movement and expression.“Women are denied access to schools and universities, have been barred from most forms of employment and have now been denied all healthcare, as they can no longer train as nurses or be treated by male medics. They are banned from beauty salons, stadiums, gyms and parks, cannot travel alone without a male chaperone, dance, sing or drive. Their faces are banned from view, their voices from being heard, even in prayer. Most recently, the Taliban has banned windows through which women might be glimpsed in their domestic spaces.”Hain appealed to CSA to raise awareness within the ICC about the plight of Afghan women cricketers and to express solidarity with Afghan women and girls who aspire to participate in sports.“Will South African cricket please raise the plight of Afghan women cricketers in the ICC and express firm solidarity with Afghan women and girls who wish to play?”CSA responded with a statement condemning the suppression of women's rights in Afghanistan. They affirmed their commitment to gender equality in cricket.“CSA found ‘the treatment and suppression of women’s rights in Afghanistan abhorrent and firmly believes that women’s cricket deserves equal recognition and resources, an area in which CSA’s record on women’s cricket in South Africa speaks for itself’.”CSA clarified that their stance on Afghanistan's participation in the Champions Trophy would be guided by the ICC's regulations and requirements.“As the Champions Trophy is an ICC event, the position on Afghanistan must be guided by the world body in accordance with international tournament participation requirements and regulations.”CSA President Rihan Richards emphasised the importance of a unified approach from ICC members. He reiterated CSA's commitment to finding a solution that supports women's cricket in Afghanistan and promotes positive change in the country.“We are of the view that a more unified and collective approach from all ICC members will be more impactful. CSA is committed and will continue to engage in constructive dialogue with the ICC and other members to find a solution that upholds women’s cricket in Afghanistan and influences meaningful change in that country.”The Taliban's return to power in August 2021 significantly marginalised women and girls in Afghan society. This drew criticism towards South Africa when they played an ODI series against Afghanistan in Sharjah in September of the following year. Notably, McKenzie, who held his current position at the time, remained silent on the matter.Lawyers for Human Rights, a non-governmental organisation with a long history of fighting oppression, criticised South Africa's decision to play against Afghanistan. They argued that it amounted to an endorsement of the Taliban regime.“South Africa’s decision to continue playing against the Afghanistan national cricket team is not just a sporting choice – it is a tacit endorsement of the Taliban’s repressive regime.”CSA defended their engagement with the Afghanistan Cricket Board, arguing against punishing Afghan cricketers for the actions of the Taliban regime.“CSA believes there is no justification for subjecting Afghan cricket players – both male and female – to secondary persecution for the actions of the Taliban…[CSA will continue] their engagement with the Afghanistan Cricket Board, despite the challenging environment posed by the Taliban regime. Gender advocacy in cricket should never be advanced by meting out punishment on innocent cricket administrators and players for the misdemeanours of a regime that stands to lose nothing from that punishment....”McKenzie's recent statement coincided with the start of the SA20, which includes seven Afghan players.Afghan cricketer Rashid Khan , captain of the MI Cape Town in SA20, spoke about the benefits Afghan cricket has gained from players' participation in T20 leagues, highlighting the learning opportunities and exposure to international competition.“Since our players have been playing in the [T20] leagues, Afghanistan cricket has benefitted. We got to the semi-finals of the [2024] T20 World Cup. Ten years before that, I don’t think anybody would have thought Afghanistan would get to the semi-finals.”Khan emphasised the importance of such leagues for Afghan players, given the lack of a domestic league providing similar opportunities.“We don’t have our own league where we can go and play with superstars. But here you get the opportunity. You share a dressing room with them for a month and you learn from them. That’s how your cricket grows. And I feel that has really helped Afghanistan cricket.”McKenzie's call for a boycott aligns with a similar push by over 160 UK politicians urging England to boycott their Champions Trophy match against Afghanistan.Australia maintains a policy of not engaging in bilateral cricket series with Afghanistan but continues to play against them in international tournaments. They are scheduled to face Afghanistan in Lahore on February 28.South Africa's opening match in the Champions Trophy is against Afghanistan in Karachi on February 21.","South Africa's Sports Minister, Gayton McKenzie, has publicly advocated for the South African men's cricket team to boycott their upcoming Champions Trophy match against Afghanistan.

ILT20 Season 3: One player from each team to watch out for,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ilt20-season-3-one-player-from-each-team-to-watch-out-for/articleshow/117123488.cms,"The upcoming ILT20 tournament spotlights six potential game-changers from each team, including Phil Salt for Abu Dhabi Knight Riders and Sam Curran for Desert Vipers. Other key players to watch are Sikandar Raza, Shimron Hetmyer, Nicholas Pooran, and Tim Southee, each bringing unique skills and recent impressive performances to the competition.

Phil Salt (Abu Dhabi Knight Riders):



Sam Curran (Desert Vipers)



Sikandar Raza (Dubai Capitals)



Shimron Hetmyer (Gulf Giants)



Nicholas Pooran (MI Emirates)



Tim Southee (Sharjah Warriorz)



The third edition of the ILT20 is almost upon us. The squads are finalised, the teams are ready, the plans are prepared. Each of the six teams have an array of match-winners, but some grab the attention more than others. Here we pick one player from each side who could be a game-changer during the tournament. Of course, there are likely to be several players who have an impact, but to begin with at least, the spotlight will shine brighter on these players.He’s explosive, he’s in the prime years of his batting form, and he can keep wickets too if required. In the last two years, Phil Salt has played 101 T20 games and struck at a staggering 164 strike-rate. It’s easy to have spurts of high strike-rate tournaments, but Salt has done so across countries, continents and competitions, and sustained it over a huge number of games. The Knight Riders signed on Salt as a wildcard pick for this season, with teams being allowed to sign two players from last season onwards even after finalising their squads. There couldn’t be a batter more suited to the name than Salt. Even in a side that has Sunil Narine and Andre Russell, it won’t be a surprise if Salt proves to be the most dynamic bat.Sam Curran has had a relatively quieter few years in T20 cricket since the highs of his Man of the Tournament winning turn in England’s T20 World Cup win a couple of years ago. But he remains a potent force with both bat and ball. The versatility he brings with the bat is something very few T20 players offer. Curran can bat anywhere in the middle order from No.3 to No.7, and he’s even opened the innings a few times. With the likes of Alex Hales and Fakhar Zaman in his team, he probably won’t be needed to open, but it’s a comforting thought for the Vipers that they can send a quick-footed, left-hand batter with a proven track record of performance on the biggest stage. The match-up value and quality Curran provides is alone worth it, and that’s without even considering his bowling.Is there anything he cannot do? Very often the quiet hero, Sikandar Raza got the accolades he richly deserved with a Man of the Tournament show in ILT20 2024. And that was no flash in the pan either. Showing that age is no barrier to growth, Raza has enjoyed a renaissance of sorts. In the last three years, his batting strike rate has jumped to 144, where it was a rather low 124 till the end of 2021. He has played 147 of his 264 T20 games since 2022, during his most fruitful period. Incredibly, his bowling has also improved in that same period, the economy rate going from 7.6 to 7.2, and the average decreasing from 34.8 to 24.3. He’s been scoring more runs considerably quicker, and taking more wickets considerably cheaper. He has all the nous and experience that comes with being 38-years-old, and the fitness and desire of someone a decade younger.Sometimes Shimron Hetmyer goes under the radar. That doesn’t happen when he’s facing up to bowlers though. His talent was evident when he burst onto the scene in 2017, barely out of his teens. Over the years, through ups and downs, Hetmyer seems to have found a natural balance as a batter. He can be a powerful finisher. He can bat up the order if required. He can rotate if the innings needs stabilising. And as a left-hander, he has a natural advantage in the T20 world of match-ups. He played 54 T20 matches in 2024, the most he has played in a single year. For Hetmyer, more means better clearly, because he struck at 148, the highest he has achieved in a calendar year. All in all, he looks primed to carry that blazing form into 2025.It is the most cliched pick perhaps, but it is really difficult to look past Nicholas Pooran. He’s the star for his team as well as the X-factor. He’s the captain as well as the primary match-winner. Among current T20 batters, Pooran doesn’t have any superiors – he has only equals. He is inventive against spin, brutal against pace, can hit sixes to any part of the ground, can accelerate before you blink your eyes, and often seems to need no time at all to get ‘set’. Pooran is gifted with remarkable balance, hands and eyes, and he’s used them to devastating effect in T20 leagues all over the world. He led the way to the title for MI Emirates last year, and it’ll take a brave person to bet against him repeating that triumph.He’s retired from international cricket now, but Tim Southee isn’t leaving cricket. He has led New Zealand in the past, but will be a new captain for the Warriorz. For all those watching their games, it will be a close call between wanting to see Southee the bowler, or Southee the batter. The bowler is blessed with great wrists, and can make life difficult for any opposition, especially at the start of the innings. The batter has deservedly earned the ‘Sixer Southee’ label, because his big hits are almost as remarkable as his outswingers. His team will be eager for both facets to be on full display.","The third edition of the ILT20 is almost upon us. The squads are finalised, the teams are ready, the plans are prepared. Here we pick one player from each side who could be a game-changer during the tournament. Phil Salt, Sam Curran, Sikandar Raza, Shimron Hetmyer, Nicholas Pooran, and Tim Southee.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117123488,imgsize-24462,width-400,resizemode-4/117123488.jpg"

When India head coach Gautam Gambhir lost his cool in Australia

NEW DELHI: Spiritual leader Premanand Ji Maharaj praised star India cricketer Virat Kohli for his exceptional contribution to Indian cricket , remarking, “You are spreading happiness in the entire country through your game.”Kohli and his actress wife, Anushka Sharma , recently met Premanand Ji in Vrindavan with their kids, Vamika and Akaay.Premanand Ji also lauded Kohli’s dedication and hard work, emphasising the positive impact his performances have had on millions of fans.Offering words of wisdom, he advised Kohli, ""Aur Abhyaas mein kami nahi honi chahiye"" (there should be no compromise in efforts), stressing the importance of discipline in achieving greatness.Premanand Ji beautifully explained that we both are doing the same thing in our respective fields.""Now, the biggest thing is that we are making people happy through our practice, giving them happiness. And they (Kohli) give happiness to the whole of India through their game. If they win, fireworks are set off across India, and the whole country celebrates. Isn't this their practice too?"" Premanand Ji said.""If they dedicate their victory to God, the whole of India is connected with them. If they achieve victory, every child in India rejoices. So their practice is to stay in their practice, even if it's a game, but the whole of India derives joy from it. If we, for some reason, should focus on the strength of our practice, there should be no lack in our practice, and we should remember the name in between. So this is their practice.""When asked about success and failure Premanand Ji said one has to face the sorrow of defeat despite having perfection.""You will have to face the sorrow of defeat even if your practice is perfect. Destiny sometimes has its role even when practice is not lacking. And if practice is complete together with destiny, then victory is achieved. Sometimes, it is seen that a catch is made; sometimes it is dropped. But destiny also plays a role, and practice too, like among fifteen or twenty.Now, they are very proficient in practice. But this time, destiny is that sorrow has to be endured, so due to the influence of their company, because the whole game will not be from one, your practice will also fail. Practice alone is not enough; destiny is also involved. How should we be in failure? We have to maintain patience while contemplating God at that time. It's very difficult because if someone can smile calmly in failure, it's a big thing. Now, even in failure, embrace it with a smile and move on. God gives that ability. Failure will not always remain. If the day doesn't remain, how can the night remain? We remember God with patience. It's very difficult because the respect received in success is not received in failure.""Premanand Ji praised both Virat and Anushka, saying they are very brave people, as it is very difficult to turn towards devotion even after receiving worldly respect.""The main thing is to chant the name as much as we can, whether sitting or standing, and we will move forward. Both worldly and spiritual progress can be achieved in Kaliyug. If we hold onto the chant, everything will be accomplished. Being dependent on God is the greatest strength. Chant the name, and live with love and joy,"" Premanand Ji concluded.","Premanand Ji Maharaj praised star India cricketer Virat Kohli for his exceptional contribution to Indian cricket. The spiritual leader also lauded Kohli’s dedication and hard work, emphasising the positive impact his performances have had on millions of fans.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117117880,imgsize-68040,width-400,resizemode-4/117117880.jpg"

Along with that, I think the top order with Tom Kohler-Cadmore, Johnson Charles and Jason Roy, if they can be consistent, it gives us a great chance to do well too,” the coach said.“Our captain, Tim Southee also brings a wealth of experience into the team and has always done well in the T20 format over the years, and we just hope we can execute our plans well. How do we give ourselves the best chance is the critical question, and how do we ensure we are prepared every single day in training and in matches is going to be the critical piece.""Rashid, who has played over 400 T20 matches in his career, opened up on the importance of playing to his strengths, working on his plans, and keeping things simple.“For me, it is about playing to my strengths and working on my plans, and keeping things simple. What is my role in the team? I'm in the team to try create chances, and hopefully pick up wickets, so I work accordingly. I have been fortunate to play for 15-plus years, and knowing your game well definitely helps deal with situations during the game,” he concluded.",Sharjah Warriorz are focused on winning crucial moments and maximizing the powerplay overs. The team recognises the importance of understanding the different phases of the game and being able to win them.

NEW DELHI: Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta on Friday acknowledged the difficulty of securing impactful January signings to bolster their trophy ambitions as they aim to break a five-year drought.Recent performances, including a 2-0 League Cup semi-final loss to Newcastle and a 1-1 draw against Brighton, highlighted Arsenal's attacking deficiencies.The results have impacted their Premier League title hopes.Winger Bukayo Saka's hamstring injury, requiring surgery and sidelining him until March, further complicates Arteta's attacking options.Arsenal currently trail Premier League leaders Liverpool by six points, with the Reds having a game in hand. However, Arsenal remain well-positioned for Champions League knockout stage progression.Arteta dismissed the notion that simply adding more forwards in January is the solution. He emphasized the importance of acquiring players who can immediately enhance the team's performance.""Bringing in bodies doesn't help us all,"" said Arteta ahead of Sunday's FA Cup third round tie against Manchester United.""It's just about somebody who can immediately impact our performance and can bring something that we don't have. To find that in this market is very difficult to achieve.""The circumstances (can) change because we have certain injuries for some big players, so it's always a possibility but always it's about somebody that is really going to make us much better.""Arteta's post-Newcastle defeat comments about the match ball being ""tricky"" and ""flying differently"" compared to Premier League balls drew widespread ridicule.Arteta clarified that his remarks were not intended as an excuse for Arsenal's missed chances.""It's not an excuse, it's a reality,"" added Arteta. ""Every pitch is different, the weather conditions are changing in football, that's the beauty of it.""That's it, we adapt to that, and I never use it as an excuse.""","Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta acknowledges difficulty of securing impactful January signings.
