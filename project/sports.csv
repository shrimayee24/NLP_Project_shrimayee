Arn Anderson Criticizes The Undertaker's Streak Ending,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/arn-anderson-criticizes-the-undertakers-streak-ending/articleshow/113103475.cms,"Anderson Says That Letting The Undertaker Win Would Have Been a Better Alternative

The Undertaker vs. Brock Lesnar – WrestleMania 30 — The End of The Streak, only on WWE Network

The Undertaker is a legendary figure in the world of professional wrestling famous for his remarkable career and numerous accolades. His fearsome personality, dark persona, eerie entrance, multiple WWE Championships, and of course killer in-ring expertise have earned him enormous fame, popularity, success, and fortune. He’s been involved in some of the most memorable matches, epic feuds, dramatic feuds, and high-profile matches that have achieved iconic status due to their intriguing themes and narrative.Of all his memorable achievements, it’s his 21-0 undefeated WrestleMania streak where he delivered unforgettable performances and cemented his status as a wrestling icon.This historic streak came to an end nearly a decade ago when he was defeated by Brock Lesner and to this day, this remains one of the most debated subjects in wrestling history. Recently, Arn Anderson spoke dismissively of the end of the wrestling legend’s streak. Let’s shed some light on it.In the recent episode of his podcast, ARN, the former WWE Champion, Arn Anderson shared his perspective on the WrestleMania 30 match that happened almost 10 years ago where the wrestling legend, The Undertaker’s unmatched, historic streak was defeated by Brock Lesner.Speaking about the same, Anderson emphatically stated that the streak should never have been broken as it would have led The Undertaker to retire with an undefeated record. He went on to state that his undefeated record would have complemented his revered position in the realm of wrestling and immense influence in the Locker Room.. Putting in his own words, he said,“I don't think anybody should have ever done it...he is so special. He is so important to that locker room and I just got to see him at SummerSlam backstage, talk to him for a little bit. He's just the most respected guy that walks that hall. He has the biggest following amongst the guys who just love and respect him...I personally think he could have went on and retired that streak undefeated. It certainly did not hurt anybody that put him over right in the middle with his finish the day of WrestleMania. You were a bigger star putting Undertaker over right in the middle after it was over then you were going in.”He pointed out that defeating The Undertaker at WrestleMania didn’t do much to elevate his Lesnar’s position. Rather his letting him maintain his undefeated record would have been more impactful for the latter. In this context, Anderson pointed out his own role in trying to end The Undertaker’s record during WrestleMania 18 when he interfered the smackdown between Ric Flair and The Undertaker by delivering a spinbuster to the latter. This move significantly impacted his own career as after the WrestleMania, he gained enormous recognition that contributed to his rising star status in the wrestling world.","The Undertaker's 21-0 undefeated WrestleMania streak came to an end nearly 10 years ago when he was defeated by Brock Lesner.

Had the Gujarat selectors thought otherwise eleven years ago, the story of Jasprit Bumrah's life may not have followed the path that it has -- with no one in the world disagreeing on him being the once-in-a-generation bowler that Indian cricket got blessed with.Bumrah's journey to the day when the Gujarat selectors picked him for the 2013 Syed Mushtaq Ali tournament is as gripping as watching him make batsmen hop and fall.Hailing from Ahmedabad, Bumrah played his gully cricket in the compound of Goyal Intercity -- the apartment complex where he lived, while his mother tried to make ends meet after the early demise of his father.Studying at the Nirman High School , Bumrah dreamt of making it big in cricket. But with not much headway, a disheartened Bumrah thought of leaving cricket in 2012 and moving to Canada.But inclusion in the district team started a period that kept getting better. The tournament was a virtual trial for the state team. Bumrah got just one game, but it was enough for him to be among the wickets and eventually get into Gujarat's state team.Bumrah made his first class, List A and T20 debuts in 2013. But it was at the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament where he caught the eye of John Wright, who was scouting for young talent for the Indian Premier League franchise Mumbai Indians -- the team that the New Zealander coached at that time.The same year, 2013, Bumrah, with his distinctive stiff-arm action, made his IPL debut as well. He took three wickets even as Chris Gayle was going berserk for Royal Challengers Bangalore.It didn't take Bumrah long to get noticed by the BCCI selectors, as his yorkers and death-overs bowling became the launchpad that earned him India call-up in less than three years from making his debut in the IPL.His first match in the India jersey was an ODI against Australia in 2016. Within three days of that, he made his T20I debut as well. However, he had to wait for another two years before making his Test debut in 2018 against South Africa in Cape Town.The rest as they say is history and reflects in his consistency and tally of wickets. However, with a background of injuries and a brittle back over the years, his workload is now being managed carefully because only once in a generation you get a Jasprit Bumrah.","Jasprit Bumrah is the once-in-a-generation bowler that Indian cricket got blessed with.

My observation is that in the last three-four years, the management and captains have not shown patience to develop the spinners,"" he told PTI.Akmal expressed his concern regarding the exclusion of seasoned spinners from the team. He mentioned that players like Yasir Shah, Noman Ali, Sajid Khan, Bilal Asif, Zahid Mahmood or Usman Qadir should not have been overlooked without proper justification.""When Babar (Azam) was captain, he kept some spinners in the squad but never bothered to play them regularly. Unless spinners get constant exposure, how will they come through?"" he said.Akmal highlighted Pakistan's successful track record in home matches, where they have triumphed by employing a balanced attack of fast bowlers and spinners.""Even when we were forced to play in UAE, we won Tests mainly because of our spinners,"" he said.""We don't have pacers who are as strong as those we had in the past and yet we are expecting them to win us the series. The recent series against Bangladesh is an example.""""Where is Yasir Shah? Isn't he still active in first class cricket? Where has Noman Ali gone? Didn't he take wickets? Did he get punished? He had appendicitis in Australia, got operated on, and was then sidelined.""""What was Usman Qadir's fault? What was Sajid Khan's fault? What was Bilal Asif's fault? All of them have taken five-wicket hauls and yet are out of the team,"" he said.Akmal said Pakistan batters' 'legs start to give way' against pacers. ""Our batters are comfortable against pacers bowling at 130-140 kmph, but when they face a pace of 140 kmph or more, and they see that on the scoreboard during the match, their legs start to give way,"" he said.""See how we struggled against Nahid Rana and Taskin Ahmed who bowl 140 kmph plus. Look at the way our main batters were dismissed,"" he said.Akmal emphasized that players should prioritize domestic cricket rather than solely focusing on overseas leagues.""They prefer to go and play in useless foreign leagues to earn money and this is not helping them develop their skills. This lack of commitment towards domestic cricket is leading to inconsistent performances at the international level.""Kamran said there was nothing wrong with players wanting to earn money from foreign leagues. ""But I think as a professional you have to balance your schedule and ensure that while you earn money you also improve yourself as a player for your country,"" he added.Akmal said Babar is struggling for form due to some technical flaws.""He is unsure of himself and his off-stump early on and has this tendency to leave his leg stump exposed.

Brief Scores:

BENGALURU: Had fans been asked to pick a dream XI at the start of the opening day of the Duleep Trophy match, they would most likely have passed up 19-year-old Musheer Khan , especially when there were the likes of Rishabh Pant, Sarfaraz Khan and Yashasvi Jaiswal to choose from.But those seasoned hands came a cropper under cloudy skies at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, trudging back to the pavilion with little to show which left India B at the bottom of a crater.That was until 19-year-old Musheer (105 batting; 227b; 10x4; 2x6) turned showstopper, making an impressive Duleep debut. Musheer, in the company of Navdeep Saini (29 batting), took the fight to India A with their unbroken 108-run association for the eighth wicket.By the time Musheer made his way out to the crease, the clouds were beginning to lift and he made hay while the sun was shining. India B were 94/7 at one stage, but by stumps they had reached 202/7.Musheer made the most of a lifeline offered to him when Avesh Khan grassed a return catch when the batter was on 67. Patience was Musheer's watch word. He scored just six runs from his first 52 deliveries. His first boundary came off the 66th delivery.It was only in the 50th over of the day that Musheer began to open up by dispatching Kuldeep Yadav for consecutive boundaries. The former India U-19 player brought up his fifty in 118 deliveries and upped the ante when he started to approach his third first-class century in seven outings.Musheer's Mumbai teammate Tanush Kotian was at the receiving end. A slog sweep through deep square-leg signalled his first maximum of the game. Three balls later, he danced into the 90s with a six over deep midwicket. Musheer brought up his century in 205 balls.Earlier, sent into bat, India B openers Jaiswal (30) and Abhimanyu Easwaran (13) looked to see through the tricky opening hour and were largely successful until Easwaran decided to throw away his wicket. Chasing a wide Avesh delivery, Easwaran miscued it to wicketkeeper Dhruv Jurel, who almost flew in front of KL Rahul at first slip to latch on to the catch.Jaiswal, after a slow start, warmed up with a couple of boundaries off Khaleel Ahmed (2/39), before he fell to a short ball, trying to cut but ended up holing it to substitute Shaswat Rawat at backward point.This brought the Khan brothers to the crease. At lunch, Sarfaraz (9 off 28) and Musheer (6 off 52) ensured there were no further casualties with 65 runs coming off 30 overs. Third over after lunch, Avesh angled in a delivery which caught Sarfaraz on the pad. The second session, saw the India B bowlers tightening their bowling with Akash Deep (2/28) claiming the prized wickets of Pant and Nitish Reddy off consecutive deliveries.India B 202/7 in 79 overs (Musheer Khan 105*, Yashasvi Jaiswal 30; Khaleel Ahmed 2/39, Akash Deep 2/28, Avesh Khan 2/42) vs India A",19-year-old Musheer Khan makes impressive Duleep debut for India B.

I knew runs would eventually come,"" he added.Musheer was not alone in his efforts, finding support from late-order batter Navdeep Saini . Their partnership yielded an unbroken 108 runs for the eighth wicket, significantly bolstering the team's total.""When wickets were falling at the other end, I told myself to play intelligently and look for a partnership. Then Saini bhai gave me a lot of confidence saying he will play whether it is two balls or six balls in an over, and just keep faith in him.""He was also able to match my thinking and approach while batting. But generally, I was trying to defend the first three or four balls and then take a single,"" he elaborated.A notable aspect of Musheer's innings was his adept handling of Kuldeep Yadav. Five of his ten boundaries came off the left-arm wrist spinner, including two successive shots down the V. Conversations with senior players like Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant played a crucial role in his preparation.""This is the second time I am playing Kuldeep bhai. We have some experienced players in our side like Shubman bhai and Rishabh bhai who told me which of Kuldeep bhai's balls will be effective and off which ones I can score runs. But once I got set, batting became easy on this wicket,"" said Musheer.The 19-year-old Mumbaikar also termed the opportunity to play in Duleep Trophy as a fine learning experience.""This is a good learning experience for me as there are a lot of senior players in my team and in opposition.""I am observing the way they think, their confidence and how they prepare for a practice session and a match,"" he added.","India B batsman Musheer Khan scores unbeaten century on opening day of Duleep Trophy match. 19-year-old helped India B to 202-7 in overcast weather at the Chinnaswamy Stadium. He found support from Navdeep Saini, who added 108 runs for the eighth wicket.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113099324,imgsize-36182,width-400,resizemode-4/113099324.jpg"

Her time with the USWNT, which began in 2009, has been defined by deep camaraderie, unwavering support among teammates, and a collective fight for greater recognition and investment in women's sports.Her on-field accomplishments are equally impressive. Morgan was instrumental in securing two FIFA Women's World Cup titles for the USWNT, in 2015 and 2019, and played a key role in the team's gold medal victory at the 2012 London Olympics.She departs the international stage as a true legend, having earned two US Soccer Female Player of the Year awards (2012, 2018) and etched her name in the record books.""I grew up on this team, it was so much more than soccer,"" Morgan told the USA football website. ""It was the friendships and the unwavering respect and support among each other, the relentless push for global investment in women's sports, and the pivotal moments of success both on and off the field.""""I am so incredibly honored to have borrowed the crest for more than 15 years,"" Morgan said. ""I learned so much about myself in that time and so much of that is a credit to my teammates and our fans.

She sits fifth on the all-time scoring list with 123 goals and ninth in assists with 53. Her presence on the field translated to an astounding 177-15-32 win-loss-draw record for the USWNT, with the team remaining undefeated (76-0-10) in matches where she found the back of the net.Her combined goals and assists (176) rank fifth all-time, solidifying her place among USWNT icons like Mia Hamm, Abby Wambach, Kristine Lilly, and Carli Lloyd.Beyond her international success, Morgan enjoyed a decorated career in professional leagues.

He emphasised how teams elevate their performance when confronting Mumbai City FC, consistently setting the stage for enthralling contests.""We are embarking on a new chapter, which is why I am incredibly enthusiastic. We have acquired new players and staff. We are diligently working behind the scenes to accomplish our objectives; it's about perpetuating the processes, as we aspire to be at the pinnacle perpetually.

Draper, ranked No. 309 at the time, beat Sinner, the world No. 23, to claim his first Tour-level win. The 22-year-old lefty pushed past a struggling Alex de Minaur 6-3, 7-5, 6-2 to reach his maiden Grand Slam semi-final on Wednesday.A few hours later, Sinner survived a roller-coaster quarterfinal against the 2021 champion Daniil Medvedev 6-2, 1-6, 6-1, 6-4 to power into his third major semifinal of the season.Sinner, the Australian Open champion, has now reached the semi-finals at all four Slams.

""From there to watching his progress - winning the Bergamo Challenger (2019) to getting to the top 20 when all of us were 300, 400 in the world,"" Draper said, adding that the friendship found footing around the locker room. ""It started with sending messages to each other when we're having bad moments or good moments,"" Draper said.""It was a real good thing that we played doubles in Montreal. I loved being on court with him. It was strange being on court with someone that good. We played great doubles, and hopefully I get to play with him again. As a person, he's incredibly kind, genuine, funny, and that's more important than being the great player he is."" Friendship seems to be the theme of the US Open men's semifinals with the 26-year-old Americans Taylor Fritz and Frances Tiafoe also facing off in the last four. They are teammates and long-time friends. Sinner, whose play reflects the steel of his mentality, has no recollection of the doubles match against Draper in the juniors. ""I do remember seeing him from outside. Obviously lefty, there are fewer lefties (on Tour). His ball striking was always very, very good,"" Sinner said. ""In Montreal we got to know each other even more. It's a great friendship.""Draper, who hasn't lost a set so far, got his leg strapped midway through the quarterfinal, but dismissed injury worries with his play in the second half of the match. ""I watched the quarterfinal, he's hitting very, very strong. He's all-round a very good player,"" Sinner said of Draper's form.

It would be awesome for the fans as well to be guaranteed that one of us is going to be in the finals.""Tiafoe, US Open 2022, and Tommy Paul, Aus Open 2023, made the last-four of a Slam before the American No.1.""I was pumped for them,"" Fritz said. ""Every time I was in the quarters I played Novak Djokovic. Then at Wimbledon I played Lorenzo Musetti and he outplayed me. That's when I was, like, that excuse doesn't quite work out anymore.""Fritz added: ""I was genuinely really happy for my friends to see them have the success and if anything it always gave me the confidence that I can do it too.""Tiafoe, the younger of the two semifinalists by three months, describes Fritz as a 'pretty to-himself kind of dude'. The pair met as 12-year-olds playing the juniors. ""When I first met Taylor he was an odd cat, I definitely wasn't thinking he was going to do what he has done,"" Tiafoe said. ""Once we turned pro, we all pushed each other.""Rohan Bopanna and Indonesia's Aldila Sutjiadi went down to the all-American pairing of Donald Young and Taylor Townsend 3-6, 4-6 in the semifinals of the mixed-doubles.

This triumph marked her seventh appearance in a major quarterfinal.""I've been (to the quarters) so many freaking times - I just kept losing,"" she said. ""Finally I can say (I am a) semi-finalist.""Top-ranked Swiatek seemed to be struggling from the beginning of the match, dealing with difficulties in her serve and committing numerous unforced errors that benefited her opponent. The Polish star, who had pulled out of the Canadian Open last month due to exhaustion, made a total of 41 unforced errors throughout the encounter.Despite not having been broken since the tournament's first round, Swiatek lost serve in the opening game and once more in the third, with a double fault contributing to her struggles.In the second set, Pegula appeared to be in complete control, breaking Swiatek's serve again in the third game. However, the 2022 champion showed some resilience by breaking back with a well-executed forehand winner in the fourth game, hinting at a potential comeback.Pegula, determined to maintain her advantage, refused to let her opponent seize control.

Swiatek, visibly frustrated, struck her thigh after misdirecting a forehand on break point.As the final game began, Pegula found herself with a 40-0 lead. However, she required the support of the home crowd to secure the victory, as Swiatek showcased her skills with two impressive winners, refusing to concede easily.It was only when Swiatek's shot sailed beyond the line on match point that Pegula could finally revel in her hard-fought triumph.""Thank you to the crowd,"" she said.

Draper won in straight sets, 6-3, 7-5, 6-2, becoming the first British man to reach the final four at Flushing Meadows since Andy Murray's triumph in 2012.In the other match on Arthur Ashe Stadium, Czech player Karolina Muchova overcame a ""bug"" to defeat Brazil's Beatriz Haddad Maia.The grueling nature of playing five rounds on New York's hard courts was evident, as all four players faced challenges related to injury or illness, causing delays in both matches.Despite the setbacks, Draper maintained his impressive form, remaining the only player in the tournament who has not dropped a set.""I think I played a solid match. I feel the best fitness-wise I've been in a long, long time and I think that's where Alex has sort of got me in the past,"" Draper was quoted by Reuters from his on-court interview. ""I also think he was struggling a little bit today with something, which may have helped me.""From the outset, De Minaur struggled to find his rhythm, committing numerous unforced errors while Draper's serve proved effective, resulting in an early break that set the course of the match.The second set saw a brief interruption as both players faced injury concerns. De Minaur, who had previously withdrawn from Wimbledon due to a hip injury, appeared to be moving uncomfortably, while Draper required a timeout to have his right thigh strapped.Upon resumption, De Minaur managed to break back and level the set at 4-4. However, Draper responded with a break in the 11th game and consolidated his advantage to establish a commanding 2-0 lead in the match.In the third set, Draper's impressive power and accuracy took their toll on De Minaur, ultimately leading to his fourth defeat in a Grand Slam quarter-final throughout his career.""The way he can spread the court, being a lefty and really move you around the court, it takes a toll on the body. Accumulation of matches takes a toll, as well,"" De Minaur said.Muchova, participating in just her sixth tournament since sustaining a wrist injury at the 2023 U.S. Open, advanced to the semifinals of the event for the second year in a row by defeating Haddad Maia 6-1, 6-4 in the early match of the day.In the first set, Muchova displayed excellent form, quickly establishing a 4-0 lead with a double break. She held her serve to love and despite Haddad Maia managing to get on the scoreboard, Muchova closed out the set on her own serve.Haddad Maia's performance improved in the second set, with both players trading breaks. Muchova, after receiving attention from the physio and doctor at her chair, held serve to reach 5-3. Taking advantage of new balls, she sealed the victory on serve with an ace.""I think I played good in the key points, meaning when I had a breakpoint or I was serving for a game, I always pulled out a good shot, I think,"" Muchova said. ""I'm happy that I managed it in two sets again.""""I'm fighting (a) bug a little bit. I'm a little sick. I hope it didn't disturb anyone,"" she said.Haddad Maia, who became the first woman from Brazil to reach the quarterfinals at the US Open since Maria Bueno accomplished the feat in 1968, needed medical attention near the end of her match due to apparent breathing difficulties.""In the night session, top seeded Iga Swiatek will look to reach her seventh Grand Slam semi-final as she takes on sixth seeded American Jessica Pegula, who has not advanced beyond a Grand Slam quarter-final in six tries.""","Jack Draper defeats Alex de Minaur in straight sets to reach US Open semi- finals.
