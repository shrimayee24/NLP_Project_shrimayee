"JEE topper Ved Lahoti questions wrong marking, improves score",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jee-topper-ved-lahoti-questions-wrong-marking-improves-score/articleshow/110855801.cms,"MUMBAI/INDORE: Ved Lahoti 's self-assuredness got him a place in the record book. As a child, if he scored low in any subject, he used to take his maternal grandfather to school and question the teachers. This attitude endures.The all-India JEE (Advanced) topper, who secured 355 marks in the 2024 exam, had initially scored 352, but after IITs released the provisional answer key, he was certain he couldn't have got two questions wrong.He challenged the two questions and after taking the feedback into consideration, IITs acknowledged one answer to be correct and raised his score by an additional three marks.""I was determined to break the JEE (Advanced) score record,"" says Lahoti.Lahoti, who feels ""nothing is impossible"", says he believes in finding logical answers to everything.""If you are determined, everything is possible. There should be a goal in life, and it should be big. After this, hard work should also be of the same level,"" he said.""Have faith in your hard work. If you have worked according to the target, then you will definitely achieve success. To learn, it is necessary to practise as much as possible,"" says Lahoti, who had set his sights on JEE (A) seven years ago and wants to join IIT Bombay's computer science stream.While Lahoti's razor-sharp focus saw him through, Mulund boy Dhruv Doshi, who bagged an all-India rank of 9 and got Mumbai a spot in the top 10 after three years, believes in taking life as it comes. He says he was unsure about preparing for JEE (A) till he took his Class X exams.Now that he is among the top scorers, Doshi, who is the son of an anaesthesiologist and a dentist, is aiming to secure a computer science seat in IIT Bombay.A student at Rahul International School, which offers integrated coaching, he had secured 96.6% in his CBSE Class XII exams this year.""I have always loved mathematics. And my target was to get a seat comfortably in IIT Bombay as it is closer home. But I was not expecting such a good rank,"" says Doshi, adding that the mathematics portion of the exam was simpler than other sections and even previous years. In his free time, Doshi loves to travel, and play cricket and football.Rajkot's Dwija Patel (18) from the IIT Bombay zone, who at rank 7 is the topper among girls this year, says she developed an interest in coding after being introduced to it in Class IX. ""I learnt the basics and I liked it, and mathematics has always been my favourite subject. So, engineering was an obvious choice,"" she says.The daughter of a mathematics teacher, Patel learnt some of her Class XI and XII maths in her secondary school from her father. ""I knew I would get a good rank but was not expecting to be in the top 10 category,"" she says, adding that the paper was relatively easier. Patel, too, wants to pursue computer science from IIT Bombay. As the exam neared, she spent 8-10 hours on preparation.","All-India JEE (Advanced) topper Ved Lahoti secured 355 marks in the 2024 exam.

NEW DELHI: In the 19th match of the T20 World Cup 2024 , India (IND) will take on Pakistan (PAK). This match will be played at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York on June 9 at 8:00 PM IST.This highly anticipated clash between the arch-rivals is set to electrify fans worldwide, with both teams aiming to claim victory and make their mark in the tournament. India enters the match with confidence following a convincing win against Ireland, while Pakistan seeks redemption after a defeat to co-hosts USA.India has a strong record against Pakistan, having won nine out of the 12 matches played between the two teams. In T20 World Cups, India has been dominant, winning six out of seven matches against Pakistan.The pitch at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium has been challenging for batsmen, with low scores being recorded in the tournament so far. The bowlers are expected to play a crucial role, and captains winning the toss may opt to field first.Previous matches at the venue have seen low-scoring affairs, with an average first innings score of 99 and a second innings score of 97.For fantasy cricket enthusiasts, selecting bowlers who can exploit the conditions will be key. Batsmen who can adapt to the pitch and play patiently in the initial stages will also be valuable picks.Virat Kohli boasts an impressive record against Pakistan in T20 World Cups, having scored 308 runs in five innings, including four half-centuries, with just one dismissal. Despite a slow start in this tournament, Kohli's history against Pakistan makes him a reliable choice for fantasy contests.As an all-rounder, Hardik Pandya adds depth to the Indian team. His recent three-wicket haul against Ireland showcased his bowling prowess. Pandya's batting ability, especially against Pakistan as seen in the 2022 T20 World Cup, makes him a valuable pick for fantasy teams, likely to contribute in both innings.Jasprit Bumrah, the leader of India's pace attack, has carried his IPL form into this tournament, taking two wickets against Ireland. His skill and consistency make him a key player to watch, and he could be a game-changer in fantasy contests with his potential to take crucial wickets.Rohit Sharma(c), Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant(w), Suryakumar Yadav, Shivam Dube, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, Mohammed Siraj, Yuzvendra Chahal, Sanju Samson, Kuldeep Yadav, Yashasvi JaiswalMohammad Rizwan(w), Babar Azam (c), Usman Khan, Fakhar Zaman, Shadab Khan, Azam Khan, Iftikhar Ahmed, Shaheen Afridi, Haris Rauf, Naseem Shah, Mohammad Amir, Imad Wasim, Abrar Ahmed, Saim Ayub, Abbas Afridi.Wicketkeeper: Mohammad RizwanBatters: Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma , Babar AzamAll-rounders: Ravindra Jadeja, Hardik Pandya, Ifitikhar Ahmed, Shadab KhanBowlers: Mohammad Amir, Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep SinghOverall, the stage is set for an exciting contest between two arch-rivals, and fans can expect a thrilling encounter between India and Pakistan in the T20 World Cup.","India (IND) will take on Pakistan (PAK) in the 19th match of the T20 World Cup 2024.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batter Kamran Akmal has labeled India's decision to open with Virat Kohli in the T20 World Cup as a significant mistake.In India's tournament opener against Ireland, Kohli, as an opener, was dismissed cheaply, scoring just 1 run off 5 balls. Despite this, the Indian team management appears set to continue with this batting order for their crucial match against Pakistan on Sunday.Akmal expressed his disagreement with this strategy, suggesting that Kohli should be positioned at No. 3, where he can anchor the innings and guide the team through the middle overs.""I don't think the batting order is correct. Virat Kohli can take the pressure at No.3 and finish the match. That is very important for Team India. Yashasvi Jaiswal should open the batting. Kohli should come at 3. If India stick to this batting order (of Kohli) opening, then they may get stuck at some point. Kohli holds one end up and finishes off the game. I think India are making a mistake by opening with Kohli,"" Akmal said on his YouTube channel.Kohli has extensive experience as an opener for his IPL franchise, Royal Challengers Bengaluru . In the recently concluded IPL, Kohli won the Orange Cap, scoring 741 runs at a strike rate of 154.India delivered a comprehensive performance in their first match of the tournament, but their real test lies ahead against Pakistan. The Pakistan team, reeling from a shock defeat to the USA, will be eager to bounce back.""India will be confident. Bumrah bowled well, Siraj did well. Hardik Pandya also got wickets. They have three matches at the same venue, that will also be an advantage,"" Akmal noted.Akmal also criticized the quality of the pitches in New York, calling on the ICC to ensure better playing surfaces for the marquee matches. ""ICC will have to produce better pitches for big matches. Otherwise, people will go away from this World Cup,"" he warned.As India prepare for the high-stakes clash against Pakistan, all eyes will be on their batting order and whether they stick with Kohli as an opener.","Former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batter Kamran Akmal has labeled India's decision to open with Virat Kohli as a significant mistake.

NEW YORK: It was a comeback of dreams as India showed what they are truly capable of. The six-run win over Pakistan in New York's initiation to serious top-flight cricket was truly the spectacle that the sport was so desperately waiting for.Down, out and virtually nailed into the coffin, the bravehearts in blue rose from the ashes as India's entry into Super-8s looks well assured.The toss went against India, a spectacular collapse led to them being dismissed for 119, and when Pakistan score read 80-4 in the 15th over, the game looked all but gone.But that's when India's greatest white-ball match-winner of all time showed his magic. Jasprit Bumrah pitched the ball in the right area and Mohammed Rizwan, who had battled on to 31 till then, played a poor shot to get bowled. The celebration told the story, the Indian bowlers knew they were back in the game.Everyone chipped in after that, with Axar giving two off the 16th and Hardik Pandya removing Shadab Khan off a short ball in the 17th, as the Pakistan wheels started coming off spectacularly.It all boiled down to the 19th over with Pakistan needing 21 and Bumrah back in action. The champion chose to bowl back of the length as Ifthikar Ahmed and Imad Wasim just couldn't get it going. And when Ifthikar departed off the last ball of Bumrah's spell, a blue wave engulfed the stadium.Eighteen off the last over was way beyond Pakistan's reach as Arshdeep, who had scored a vital few runs with the bat as well, did just enough to take India home.Earlier, with the score reading 89-3 in the 12th over, the game looked fairly under control for India. Rishabh Pant (42 off 31 balls), in two gutsy partnerships with Axar Patel and Suryakumar Yadav , seemed to have weathered the early storm.But with the sun coming out and the pitch drying out just a bit, the two-paced nature of the track was slowly coming to the fore. And it was this slight advantage that the Pakistan bowlers utilized brilliantly.Haris Rauf, who had looked ordinary till then, removed Surya, the batter failing to connect his bread-and-butter inside-out shot over mid-off, the pitch playing its part. It sparked off a collapse where India lost seven for 28, a kind of a batting debacle that the Indian fans haven't witnessed in a while. But it didn't matter in the end.",India beat Pakistan by six runs in World Cup opener in New York. India bowled out Pakistan for 119 in 20 overs. Jasprit Bumrah took two wickets in the 19th over to win the match.

NEW DELHI: Indian pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah shared his long-held admiration for bowling and his disinterest in high-scoring run-fests following India's nail-biting six-run victory over Pakistan in their ICC T20 World Cup clash.Bumrah's stellar performance, featuring a miserly three-wicket haul, played a crucial role in India's defense of their modest total, keeping their World Cup hopes alive with two group stage games remaining.In a packed Nassau County Stadium , Bumrah's precise bowling applied relentless pressure on the Pakistani batters, while Rishabh Pant 's counter-attacking knock bolstered India's position. The match, witnessed by a record crowd, highlighted Bumrah's skill and strategic approach to bowling.During the post-match press conference, Bumrah expressed his satisfaction with the recognition the bowlers received for their efforts. He highlighted India's preference for batting and how the recent Indian Premier League season was heavily tilted towards the batters.""We are very happy that we did not come here with that baggage (of IPL being batter friendly) and when we are getting help here, we were trying to use it. I have played a lot of cricket in my young years—when the bat and ball challenge is good it is more interesting to watch the match. When it is bat vs bat, I switch off the TV. I have been a fan of bowling since childhood. When there is a challenge between bat and ball, that is the game I like. No complaints. I am very happy,"" Bumrah said.Reflecting on the victory, Bumrah emphasized the importance of maintaining a balanced approach between controlling the run flow and taking wickets, especially in conditions where seam and swing had diminished. He discussed the need to avoid desperation for a ""magic ball"" and instead focus on accuracy and utilizing the large boundaries to their advantage.""Even when there is help, you can be desperate, and you can try to go fuller and try to pull that magic delivery. I tried not to do that but when we came, the swing and seam had reduced. So, we had to be accurate because if we go for magic deliveries and try to be too desperate, run-making becomes easy and they know the target. So, we had to be very mindful of not overdoing it and yes add up the pressure, use the big boundaries, try to use things to our advantage. That is what we were doing. So, in that we created pressure and everybody got wickets,"" he explained.Bumrah also opened up about his recovery from injuries last year and his journey back to top form, delivering remarkable performances in the 50-over World Cup, IPL, and now the T20 World Cup. He emphasized his focus on controlling the controllable and staying present, despite external pressures and noise.""I try to stay in the present and focus on what I have to do. Because if I look at the outside noise, if I look at people and pressure and emotion take over, then things do not really work for me. So, I was trying to do that, trying to create my own bubble, and trying to focus on that and try to put my best foot forward,"" Bumrah added.He appreciated the support from the largely Indian and Asian crowd at the Nassau County Stadium, which made the team feel at home and boosted their energy levels.""A lot of emotion does come in and it does not feel like we are not playing in India because the support that we get, wherever we go, we get a lot of support and fans come in large numbers. So that does help with the energy part of the setup that we have. So yeah, very happy with the support and we were happy that we were able to give them a win as well,"" he said.",Jasprit Bumrah shares his admiration for bowling and disinterest in high-scoring run-fests.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan coach Gary Kirsten defended the playing surface at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium following the team's narrow six-run defeat to India in a low-scoring T20 World Cup match.Despite India's modest total of 119, their lowest ever against Pakistan in a T20 game, Pakistan fell short in their chase, sparking discussions about the pitch conditions.The venue, featuring a 'drop in' square laid a month before the tournament, has seen all five games produce low scores, raising concerns about the pitch's quality. After India's previous win over Ireland, former Zimbabwe international and ex-England team director Andy Flower labeled the pitch ""dangerous"" due to its uneven bounce.However, Kirsten downplayed these criticisms, suggesting that the pitch, while challenging, was not hazardous. ""I think it wasn't dangerous, I mean the odd one rose up, but not many. Generally, it kept a little bit lower, it was difficult to score from both batting sides and also a fairly slow outfield so it was never going to be a big total,"" he stated.Kirsten acknowledged that a score of 140 would have been competitive, indicating that Pakistan had a strong chance to win after restricting India to 119. ""I would have said 140 would have been a really good score on that pitch, so India didn't get that and so I thought we had the game,"" added the South African.He also emphasized that low-scoring games could be equally entertaining and offered a different kind of contest compared to the high-scoring encounters typical of T20 cricket.""We knew it was going to be tight, but you know sometimes it's fun seeing games like that as well, it's not always about sixes and hitting, getting 260 and 240's, you can actually have a really entertaining game on a 120 chase, so I don't think it's bad for the game,"" Kirsten explained.In response to the criticism, the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) admitted that the pitches at the venue had not met the expected standards and committed to improving them for the remaining matches.Three games remain at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, with the final match scheduled for Wednesday, when India will face co-hosts USA.",Pakistan coach Gary Kirsten defends the pitch at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium.

We are still trying to digest what happened,"" the former India U-19 left-arm pacer, who made the difference with a brilliant Super Over against Pakistan, told PTI in an exclusive interview on Friday.An alumnus of prestigious Cornell University and a senior software engineer at Oracle , Netravalkar adeptly balanced academics and cricket.""I have never felt the pressure. When you love something, it is never a job for you. So when I am out there on the field, I love bowling and trying to out-think a batter. When I am coding , I love doing that and hence it never feels like work,"" the left-arm seamer, who has suddenly become the talk of the town, couldn't have put it more lucidly.""Actually, we just flew down from Dallas to New York. I will be honest that it has been quite overwhelming. I wish I could personally thank each and everyone for their lovely messages. I feel blessed,"" one could sense the gratitude in his voice.What was the strategy for the Super Over, and when did he find out he would be bowling?""It wasn't pre-decided and only after the regulation 20 overs did skipper (Monank Patel) and coach (Stuart Law) informed me about it. I am thankful to them for showing faith in me.""He then gave an insight into the US strategy.""The plan was simple that I will try and bowl wide yorkers to the right handers and try to keep it out of his range as the boundary on that side was bigger. First ball the batter shifted and didn't get a wide and second ball, he stayed rooted and connected, and then, I got a couple of wides, as I was trying for wide lines.""But I must say that 18 runs helped and all those extra runs that Harmeet (Singh) and Aaron (Jones) ran, helped. Basically, if you are defending around 20, all you need is three good balls, and the job is done. It is one of the best matches I have played.""However, Netravalkar would matter-of-factly state that while opportunities in professional cricket are improving in the US, his primary source of income remains his day job at Oracle.""The best part is that I have got very supportive bosses at Oracle and I am allowed to work remotely when I am on tour, playing for the United States.""So on match days, I am excused from work but then there are scheduled project meetings which warrants my presence and then I work my practice schedule accordingly. I would also thank US Cricket board as they also are flexible if I have meetings lined up.""His is a fascinating story.""I can tell you that when I play local matches or club games in the United States, I have often logged in for a meeting at the lunch break and people have been very accommodating.""At Oracle, they all know by now I play cricket and everyone is happy to support. I work in team Oracle text and I am primarily a coder, who works on SQL and C (programming languages),"" he said.What are the prospects of a full-time cricket career in the United States?""Well, if you have a Major League Contracts, those are good and you can have a full-time cricket career.""Minor League Cricket is also seeing an upswing but another avenue is some weekend 'Pop-Up' tournaments, basically played from Friday to Sunday in Houston, Florida where you can actually earn well.""Come June 12, and Netravalkar will be facing the Indian team and he is quite emotional about it.""I know all of them and Surya (Yadav) and myself have played together for Mumbai U15s, U-17, U-19s.

Oman, after winning the toss, opted to bat first at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in North Sound.""175 could have been a good score, but we had too many dot balls on a flat track,"" Aqib said. ""In the batting we have to improve. 150 was par but we dropped too many chances.""Catches, if you take them, puts pressure on the other team. This is cricket, sometimes you are at the top, sometimes you are down.""Aqib's decision to bat first initially seemed promising, as opener Pratik Athavale set the tone with a well-made 54 off 40 balls, supported by Naseem Khushi (10) and Aqib Ilyas (16).However, the momentum was disrupted when Zeeshan Maqsood fell cheaply for three runs, followed by Khalid Kail's run out with just 10 more runs added, leaving Oman struggling at 71-4 after 8.5 overs.Ayaan Khan played a crucial role in stabilizing the innings with an unbeaten 41 off 39 deliveries, receiving support from Mehran Khan, who contributed 13 runs.Among the Scottish bowlers, Safyaan Sharif stood out with two wickets, albeit conceding 40 runs.

Again, we weren't up to the mark in the first six,"" Babar said after the match.When asked about the strategy, Babar mentioned that it was about playing normal cricket.“Tactics were simple to play normally. Just strike rotation and the odd boundary. But in that period, we had too many dot balls. Can't expect much from tail-enders.”Babar had a contrarian view on the surface, differing from many who felt the ball wasn't coming onto the bat.“Pitch looked decent. The ball was coming on nicely. It was a little bit slow, and some balls had extra bounce.”For Pakistan to progress to the Super Eight stage , they'll need to secure convincing victories against Canada and Ireland while also hoping that the USA doesn't defeat either Ireland or India.“Have to win the last two matches.

NEW DELHI: India suffered a significant batting collapse, losing their last 7 wickets for a mere 30 runs, leaving them disappointed with their performance against Pakistan in the T20 World Cup match in New York on Sunday.Losing the toss put India's openers in a challenging position from the start. Despite Rohit Sharma hitting an early maximum before the rain interruption, neither he nor Virat Kohli could make a substantial impact after the resumption of play.Axar Patel, batting at number four, took his chances, as did Rishabh Pant , to keep the scoreboard moving. Although Axar couldn't capitalize on his start, Pant continued to play risky shots and maintained a steady pace.India had a solid foundation at the halfway point, but Suryakumar Yadav's dismissal at the score of 89 in the 12th over triggered a collapse, with wickets falling at regular intervals.India's last hope, Hardik Pandya, failed to make a significant contribution, resulting in India posting a modest total of 119 runs in 19 overs.Pakistan's pace attack, led by Shaheen Afridi and Naseem Shah, has delivered a stellar performance, living up to the expectations of their captain, Babar Azam. The duo set the stage by dismissing both Indian openers early in the innings.Naseem struck again after the Powerplay, but Pakistan struggled to control the flow of runs and displayed some lapses in their bowling. However, when called upon to break a thriving partnership, Haris Rauf stepped up and provided Pakistan with a crucial breakthrough.Naseem Shah and Mohammad Amir soon joined the wicket-taking spree, and the trio maintained the pressure on the Indian batting lineup.Despite a hint of complacency creeping into their fielding towards the end, they managed to bowl out India for the first time in a T20I match, preventing them from staging a recovery.","India lose their last 7 wickets for a mere 30 runs in T20 World Cup match against Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Chennaiyin FC have fortified its attacking lineup by securing the services of the distinguished Nigerian forward , Daniel Chima Chukwu , for the 2024-25 season.At 33, Chukwu brings a wealth of experience to the team, having had stints with other Indian Super League (ISL) teams such as East Bengal and Jamshedpur. His contract with Chennaiyin spans two years, ensuring his presence in the team until 2026, and marks him as the fourth acquisition for the club for the season.Chukwu's contribution to Indian football is noteworthy, especially during his time with Jamshedpur under coach Owen Coyle , where he played a significant role in the team securing the ISL League Shield in 2022. Over three seasons in the ISL, he has appeared in 60 matches, scoring 20 goals and providing four assists. His addition to Chennaiyin FC is anticipated to bolster the team's attack, bringing in a level of experience and leadership that could prove invaluable.Coach Coyle, who has previously worked with Chukwu at Jamshedpur, expressed confidence in the striker's ability to integrate into the squad and make a significant impact. Coyle said, ""I brought Daniel to Jamshedpur in the winter window of the 21/22 season and he scored seven crucial goals in 9 games to help win us the shield. We have brought a goalscorer with a proven track record in India and we are sure he will fit into this squad seamlessly.""Chukwu's professional career, which commenced at Molde FK in Norway in 2010, has been distinguished by consistent goal-scoring and success.

KOLKATA: With his hands on the hip, Sunil Chhetri stood a little distance away from the pack of his teammates in the middle of the park. He stood motionless, as if dazed, for a few seconds, his eyes blank and without expression.

A few minutes ago, Chinese referee Fu Ming had blown the whistle to seal India's goalless draw with Kuwait in their second-round fixture of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, thus ringing the curtain on Chhetri's 19-year-old career in the Blue Tigers jersey.

Suddenly the Salt Lake Stadium stands roared into ""Chhetri, Chhteri"" chants, stirring the 39-year-old out of his trance as he was given a standing ovation He began a lap of honour around the ground. Then he broke down in tears as his teammates, coach Igor Stimac and his coaching staff members lined up to give him the guard of honour. After plethora of hugs and handshakes, he slowly walked down the tunnel, out of everyone's sight and into a new life, leaving behind a legacy Indian football has hardly experienced.

The build-up to Thursday's match was all about Chhetri's send-off. Before the kick-off, the famed Blue Pilgrims stand behind the goalpost unfurled a giant tifo, showing Chhetri holding the earth, a la Hercules. India failed to turn the occasion more memorable and meaningful for Chhetri following the stalemate but that tifo perhaps represents what Chhetri has stood for in Indian football in nearly two decades since making his senior de but against Pakistan in 2005.

He will be remembered as the defining player of his generation, someone who has transcended his sport more than any other, a reference point in Indian football in the true sense of the term.

Unlike IM Vijayan, he might not have an eye for the spectacular. Unlike Bhaichung Bhutia, he might not be a typical fox in the box. Chhetri's game has always been a fable of discipline, dedication and determination.

His goals were cheeky, audacious and brilliant - scoring from midfield to embarrassing the goalkeeper with a Panenka penalty. He made people fall in love with the game.

In a later post-match felicitation, organized by the Indian Football Association, he returned to the ground to receive accolades from the Big 3 clubs - East Bengal , Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting as well as the state government. A few former players like Vijayan, Mehtab Hossain, Alvito D'Cunha and Rahim Nabi then gave him a tight embrace one by one.

KOLKATA: Goodbye Sunil Chhetri. But not a welcome yet for India to a dream place in the third round of the 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifiers .India failed to give their captain a perfect farewell as Igor Stimac 's team was held to a frustrating 0-0 draw against Kuwait at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. As the tearful Chhetri left the international football stage after 151 caps and 94 goals and failing to make an impact in Thursday's game, India's chances of qualifying to the next round now hang in balance.With 5 points from as many matches, and both Afghanistan (4 points from 4 games) and Kuwait (4 points from 5 games) lurking close by, the Blue Tigers now have to beat the already qualified Qatar in their own den in the final Group A fixture next Tuesday to keep hopes alive.A top-two finish in the group is the prerequisite not only for opening the door for brushing shoulders with Asia's best in the third round of World Cup qualifiers, but also guaranteeing a berth in the next edition of Asian Cup .With stakes so high, it felt like a juncture match for Igor Stimac's side. Chhetri's farewell - which drew an official attendance of 58,921 in the stands - further elevated the sense of the occasion.But India never looked in sync with the challenge in question, dishing out another frustrating performance nearly three months after losing 1-2 to Afghanistan in Guwahati and making their job more difficult now.In fact, had Gurpreet Singh Sandhu not effected a string of saves, it could have been quite embarrassing for Chhetri and his team.Stimac started with a new and bold defensive set-up, giving FC Goa left-back Jay Gupta his debut in Blue Tigers jersey and pairing up Rahul Bheke with Anwar Ali in the heart of defence in absence of injured Sandesh Jhingan.But if the Croatian coach's 4-2-3-1 formation was meant to gain early ascendancy, it failed to instil the sort of organisation and obduracy that he would have expected to characterise his backline. The result was a streak of nervy moments invading the home team's play.The match was just four minutes old when Bheke failed to intercept a pass, allowing Mohammad Abdulah to stare at the goal with a world of time and space. But Kuwait's No. 9 ended up hitting straight at Gurpreet.Relieved and reprieved, India tried to make a statement, Liston Colaco seeing his cutback cleared by Kuwait defender Hasan Alanezi for a corner and Chhetri skying an attempt way over the bar.Just when India appeared to have started to establish a more recognisable rhythm, Kuwait shook the hosts out of a false dawn, threatening to upset the applecart.",India fail to give their captain a perfect farewell as Igor Stimac's team was held to a frustrating 0-0 draw against Kuwait at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday.

India's final match is against Asian champions Qatar on June 11, while Kuwait, with four points, will face Afghanistan on the same day.Chhetri's international career spans an impressive 19 years, during which he scored 94 goals, making him the fourth most prolific scorer in international football, behind Portugal superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (128), Iran legend Ali Daei (108) and Argentine wizard Lionel Messi (106).This remarkable achievement is particularly noteworthy for a player from a country like India, and FIFA recognised Chhetri's legendary status upon his announcement of international retirement on May 16.Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium, with a capacity of 68,000, was packed with fans, officials, and former players who came to bid an emotional adieu to Chhetri.His parents, Kharga and Sushila, and wife, Sonam Bhattacharya, were also in attendance.

The first half was action-packed, with both teams creating chances but failing to find the back of the net.The crowd remained engaged, chanting ""Sunil, Sunil"" and ""Vande Mataram"" throughout the match.Kuwait's best chance in the first half came in the fourth minute when Eid Al-Rashidi set up Daham with a perfect through ball. However, Indian goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu made a crucial save to deny Mohammad Daham.India responded in the 11th minute with Liston Colaco's low cross, but Hasan Alanezi's sliding clearance prevented Chhetri from scoring his 95th goal.Debutant Jay Gupta was involved in the action, delivering a sublime low cross from the left in the 25th minute, but the Kuwait defense cleared it for a corner. India failed to capitalize on a freekick in the 28th minute, despite Poojary's impressive run and nutmeg.At the halfway mark, Thapa sent a fantastic ball into the box, which Kuwait cleared to deny Sahal Abdul Samad. The rebound fell to Liston Colaco, who fired a low strike into the side netting from a narrow angle.In the second half, Igor Stimac made changes to India's attacking lineup, introducing Rahim Ali, Brandon Fernandes, and Chheri. However, the desired result was not achieved, as Rahim failed to convert his chances.Kuwait's frustration peaked in the 74th minute when they were denied a penalty claim, leading to a confrontation between players and bench.Replays suggested a foul, but the referee deemed otherwise. Tempers flared up after a challenge on Indian debutant Edmund, resulting in a mini-brawl and yellow cards for both Edmund and Sultan Alenezi.Despite the tension, Edmund rallied the crowd's support with a free-kick opportunity, but Brandon Fernandes' poor delivery meant India's last hope for a win disappeared in the added seven minutes.Stimac handed left-back Gupta his international debut in a 4-2-3-1 formation, with Chhetri as the sole striker.
