NEW DELHI: Taking a swipe at Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi, jailed former cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan has mockingly suggested that Naqvi should pad up as an opener alongside Army Chief General Asim Munir if Pakistan hopes to win a cricket match against India.Imran’s sarcastic remarks came in the wake of Pakistan’s back-to-back defeats to India in the ongoing Asia Cup in Dubai.His sister, Aleema Khan, speaking to reporters on Monday, elaborated on his comments.According to her, Imran said that the only chance Pakistan had of beating India would be if Gen Munir and Naqvi opened the innings, with former chief justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa and Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja serving as umpires.For the role of third umpire, he mockingly suggested Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Sarfaraz Dogar.Aleema added that she had informed her brother about the twin defeats against India, which prompted his jibe.Imran, who captained Pakistan to its only ODI World Cup triumph in 1992, has held Naqvi responsible for the decline of Pakistan cricket, accusing him of “incompetence” and “nepotism.”The 72-year-old has also repeatedly accused Gen Munir of stealing his party’s mandate in the February 2024 general elections with the help of then CJP Isa and election commissioner Raja.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder has been incarcerated since August 2023 in multiple cases.",Imran Khan takes a swipe at Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi.

Kiran Desai is a favorite and US authors make a strong showing on the Booker Prize shortlist,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kiran-desai-is-a-favorite-and-us-authors-make-a-strong-showing-on-the-booker-prize-shortlist/articleshow/124078761.cms,"Indian author Kiran Desai (File photo)

LONDON: Booker Prize -winning Indian author Kiran Desai is a favorite to win the coveted fiction trophy for a second time with her first novel in two decades.""The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny"" is on a US-dominated six-book shortlist announced Tuesday by a judging panel that includes Irish writer Roddy Doyle and actor Sarah Jessica Parker. The almost 700-page tale of two young Indians making their way in the United States is Desai's third novel and her first since ""The Inheritance of Loss,"" which won the Booker Prize in 2006.Two previous Booker finalists are up for the 50,000 ($68,000) prize again: U.K. writer Andrew Miller for ""The Land in Winter,"" set during an early-1960s cold snap, and Hungarian-British writer David Szalay for ""Flesh,"" which charts one man's life across decades.Three novels by Americans complete the list: Susan Choi's family saga ""Flashlight""; Katie Kitamura's tale of acting and identity, ""Audition""; and midlife-crisis road trip ""The Rest of Our Lives"" by Ben Markovits.Doyle - a Booker winner himself in 1993 for ""Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha"" - said the six books tackle big issues, including migration and class, in a ""brilliantly human"" way.""They all follow the human in the stories,"" Doyle said. ""That might seem a bit trite, but I've read novels where I've often felt to myself, if there was a little bit less showing off there would be a good story there.And I don't think any of these books show off.""Founded in 1969, the Booker Prize has a reputation for transforming writers' careers. Its winners have included Salman Rushdie, Margaret Atwood, Ian McEwan, Hilary Mantel and Samantha Harvey, who won last year with ""Orbital.""Past winners have included debut novels - from Arundhati Roy's ""The God of Small Things"" in 1997 to Douglas Stuart's ""Shuggie Bain"" in 2020 - but this year's list is dominated by veterans. All the finalists are decades into their careers, and all but Desai have published at least five books.""That's the best thing about writing books,"" said Kiley Reid, author of the novel ""Such a Fun Age"" and another member of the judging panel. ""It's not gymnastics. You don't peak at any age. And seeing authors late into their careers have these wonderful moments, it's really encouraging.""Originally open to novels from the U.K., Ireland and the Commonwealth, the prize expanded in 2014 to admit American writers. Worries about an American takeover have largely proved unfounded, though this year's list of six includes three American writers and a fourth, Desai, who has long lived in New York.That's likely to reignite grumbling from some in the U.K., especially since big American fiction prizes like the Pulitzer and the National Book Awards are only open to U.S.-based authors.""Well, that's not our only problem"" in the U.S., Parker said.""As somebody who likes to read globally, I always want more and more diversity,"" said the ""Sex and the City"" star, a longtime advocate for reading and literacy. ""So I would love all literary awards and competitions to alert readers to great books, no matter where they're from.""The judges read 153 novels submitted by publishers, selecting 13 semifinalists and then narrowing that to six during a four-hour meeting. Another meeting looms to pick a winner, who will be crowned on Nov. 10 at a ceremony in London.Parker said it had been a joy to immerse herself in a year of reading, but that cutting books from contention was ""real agony.""""We all had a couple of books that our heart was broken,"" she said.","Indian author Kiran Desai is a favorite to win the coveted fiction trophy for a second time.

Rampur's parkour pioneers turn ruins into launchpads,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rampurs-parkour-pioneers-turn-ruins-into-launchpads/articleshow/124080232.cms,"Members of Rampur’s Team Leonine in action

'Started off by copying

Jackie Chan

, got to know much later parkour was a sport'

MEERUT: In Rampur, a city better known for its royal past, a group of young men has turned remnants of that history into something else. Disused courtyards, locked playgrounds and Nawabi-era structures aren't tourist spots - they're practice grounds. For nearly two decades, a group of self-taught athletes has used these overlooked spaces to train in parkour long before most people here knew the word.Some of them would later carry these moves into Bollywood. Aman Kumar, who trained with the group, moved to Mumbai and began working in films. ""I've done stunts in 'Baaghi 4', 'Sultan', 'Devara' - stuff like that,"" he said. ""Directors like working with parkour artists because we don't rely on wires. We know how to land, how to adapt to real locations. There's more control, less need for editing around mistakes.""It began in 2007, when Mujahid Habib, then a teenager, realised the jumping, swinging and vaulting he did for fun had a name, and a global community. ""We used to give our moves random names, copying stunts from Jackie Chan movies,"" he said. ""Then we saw Hrithik Roshan do similar jumps in 'Dhoom 2', and my friend Waseem told me it was actually a sport, parkour.That's when I saw it as something bigger.""Habib kept practising on staircases, rooftops, drains using whatever was available. In 2009, he formed Team Leonine with five others. ""We used to go out at 5am,"" said Aamir Zameer Khan, a founding member. ""We trained on the Kosi riverbank as the sand helped with landings. Then we moved to Nahid Ground. It was always locked, so we started jumping a 10-foot-wide drain to get in.""Parkour also gave them a reason to explore their surroundings differently. ""We began looking for places that could push us - rooftops, old buildings, broken structures,"" said Hassan Khan. ""Some thought we were up to no good. Others would stop and watch. A few gave us fruit or water. It was never the same reaction twice.""They moved through Rampur, trying to read the city physically. Every alley, gate and rooftop was a chance to test technique, timing, nerves. At first, people didn't know what to make of them. Some thought they were trespassing. Others warned them to stop. ""A few even threatened to call the police,"" said Aamir. ""But some people got it. They'd bring chai or snacks. A fruit vendor once handed me a guava after watching us train all morning. ""By 2013, Habib's work had started getting noticed. That year, he won a national parkour competition in Mumbai sponsored by an energy drink brand. The prize took him to Greece, where he saw his first international event.""That trip changed how I thought about what we were doing,"" Habib said.""We had started without knowing others were doing the same. It made everything feel connected,"" he added.","Rampur's self-taught parkour athletes have been practising for two decades.

Dave Portnoy blasts Jake Paul vs Gervonta Davis fight as Netflix clash in Miami sparks ‘clown show’ debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/dave-portnoy-blasts-jake-paul-vs-gervonta-davis-fight-as-netflix-clash-in-miami-sparks-clown-show-debate/articleshow/124070215.cms,"Dave Portnoy blasts Jake Paul vs Gervonta Davis fight as Netflix clash in Miami sparks ‘clown show’ debate (Image via Getty)

Dave Portnoy rips into Jake Paul vs Gervonta Davis matchup

“Jake Paul is arguably the greatest marketer of all time. One absolute clown show after another and somehow people keep paying him and showing up. This is insane.”

“I’m much quicker. He’s much stronger and much bigger, but taller fighters always struggle against shorter ones.”

Gervonta Davis and Jake Paul fight rules, venue change and criticism

Jake Paul’s next boxing show has already been slammed before it even begins. On Monday, September 22, 2025, at a press conference in New York, Paul stood face-to-face with unbeaten champion Gervonta “Tank” Davis. The huge size gap between the two shocked many, including Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, who went online to call the November 14 exhibition fight in Miami, Florida an “absolute clown show.” The bout will stream live on Netflix from the Kaseya Center.Dave Portnoy took to X (formerly Twitter) after the New York press event, mocking the fight as a money-making stunt. He wrote:The criticism comes because Paul, 6-foot-1 with a 76-inch reach, weighed around 200 pounds in his last fight. Davis, in comparison, is only 5-foot-5 and usually fights at 135 pounds. At the presser, Paul towered over Davis.Jake Paul defended himself, saying his game plan is simple: “I’m going to use my reach, my size, and keep him away.”Gervonta Davis, unbeaten at 30-0-1, fired back with confidence:The exhibition fight was first planned for Atlanta, Georgia, but local regulators refused approval.Rick Thompson, chairman of the Georgia Athletic and Entertainment Commission, told USA Today: “This is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. It’s a money grabber, and I’m not OK with that.”Because of that, the fight was moved to Miami. The rules also show it is only an exhibition match, so Davis’s undefeated record will not be affected. Gambling will not be allowed. Judges will still be present to score the bout, so fans will get a winner at the end.Also Read: “Women In America Were...”: Martina Navratilova Once Recalled How Chris Evert’s ‘Girly’ Look Divided Fans And Rivals Jake Paul (12-1) has fought in similar events before.

Davis, a world champion at lightweight, has never fought anywhere near Paul’s weight class before.The fight on November 14, 2025, in Miami will test how far boxing fans are willing to accept the mix of entertainment, streaming numbers, and mismatched opponents.","Jake Paul to fight Gervonta Davis in Miami, Florida, on November 14, 2025.

A personal message from Ronaldo

“Happy Saudi National Day to everyone in Saudi Arabia! 🇸🇦 Wishing you a day filled with pride, unity, and celebration with your loved ones.”

“It’s a fantastic place to live. For me, the most special thing is that it’s a safe country. The league is good, and that’s our job, to come here and play football. And there’s love. I love being here. My family loves being here. It’s a great country.”

“Tourism is very good. The schools for the kids are excellent. The tourist areas are beautiful. And many people still don’t know that. So, I recommend that anyone who doesn’t know Saudi Arabia should come and visit, the tourism is fantastic, and the culture is amazing.”





Living in the Saudi Arabia– Beyond football

“My family always supports my decisions, and we’re happy here in Saudi Arabia. The people treat us in an incredibly warm way. That’s why we want to live here and build our lives here.”

“I will stay two more years as a football player, but also for life because my contribution to this country is not only for football... I want to be part of the country’s growth forever.”

On the occasion of Saudi Arabia’s 95th National Day, football legend Cristiano Ronaldo took to social media to express his deep appreciation for the country he now calls home. His heartfelt tribute not only extended well-wishes to the Saudi people but also offered rare glimpse into his personal connection with the Kingdom, a place he says he and his family have come to cherish deeply.Cristiano Ronaldo, the Al-Nassr and Portugal forward, marked Saudi Arabia’s 95th National Day by sharing a personal message through his official Instagram account. The 40-year-old football star posted several visuals dedicated to the occasion, along with a caption that read:In addition to the post, Ronaldo shared a short video in which he reflected on his life in the Kingdom. Speaking candidly, he praised Saudi Arabia’s culture, safety, and quality of life, positioning it as a top destination for both living and tourism:He highlighted the country's excellent schools, rich cultural heritage, beautiful yet underrated tourist attractions, and its strong sense of safety and hospitality, urging people worldwide to visit and discover what Saudi Arabia truly offers.Ronaldo’s tribute goes beyond a social media gesture. It reflects a deeper, long-term commitment to Saudi Arabia, which he emphasized in a video shared by Al-Nassr Football Club on YouTube earlier this year.In July 2025, following the extension of his contract with Al-Nassr until 2027, Ronaldo made it clear that he envisions a life in the Kingdom well beyond his football career:He went on to describe Saudi Arabia as a “land of peace and safety,” expressing genuine satisfaction with his family’s experience in the country.This includes a strong sense of belonging and admiration for the local community and way of life.Cristiano Ronaldo joined Al-Nassr in late 2022 after a dramatic exit from Manchester United. Since his arrival, he has made a significant impact on the pitch. As of September 2025, he has scored 103 goals across all competitions, including his latest two in a dominant Saudi Professional League win over Al Riyadh on September 22, 2025. The brace brought his career tally to 945 goals, putting him just 55 goals away from the historic 1,000-goal milestone. Watching from the stands, his children and partner Georgina celebrated with infectious joy, a heartfelt scene that added a layer of warmth to an already memorable night.In June 2025, Al-Nassr officially announced the historic extension of Ronaldo’s contract, securing his legendary services until 2027. This remarkable extension will take him beyond his 42nd birthday, a testament to both his extraordinary physical resilience and his relentless hunger for continued success.Despite individual achievements and lifting the King Salman Club Cup, Ronaldo acknowledged that a major domestic or continental title still eludes him at Al-Nassr. But he remains undeterred:His drive stems not from resting on past laurels but from a desire to create a lasting legacy, both in football and in the country he now calls home.September 23, 2025, marks the 95th National Day of Saudi Arabia, a public holiday celebrated across the Kingdom with great enthusiasm. The date commemorates the unification of Saudi Arabia in 1932 under King Abdulaziz Al Saud.This year’s theme is “Our Pride Lies in Our Nature,” celebrating both the Kingdom’s rich cultural heritage and its diverse natural landscapes.Festivities planned in major cities include:All government offices, banks, schools, and both public and private institutions are closed for the day.First officially observed in 1965 during the reign of King Faisal, Saudi National Day became a permanent holiday in 2005 by royal decree under King Abdullah. It has since evolved into a major symbol of national pride and progress, in alignment with Vision 2030, the country’s long-term development blueprint.","Cristiano Ronaldo marked Saudi Arabia’s 95th National Day by sharing a personal message through his official Instagram account.

Who is Jaxson Dart’s mother, Kara, and how she shaped his career



The New York Giants are turning the page in their quarterback saga. Russell Wilson will step aside as the team’s starting quarterback, making way for first-round rookie Jaxson Dart. The 22-year-old will take the helm this Sunday at MetLife Stadium against the undefeated Los Angeles Chargers. Drafted in 2025 after a standout college career at USC and Ole Miss, Dart is ready to bring his arm, leadership, and poise to the Giants’ offense, marking the start of what many are calling the Jaxson Dart era.Born on May 13, 2003, in Kaysville, Utah, Dart grew up in a close-knit, sports-driven family as the oldest of five children. His senior year at Corner Canyon High School saw him lead the team to an undefeated season and a state championship. Beyond football, Dart was a two-time all-state third baseman and enjoyed hunting and fishing with his father, Brandon. These early experiences instilled in him a sense of discipline, resilience, and teamwork that would define his athletic career.Dart’s rise to the NFL was supported every step of the way by his parents. Brandon, a former safety for Utah, taught him the intricacies of football, helping him understand defensive strategies and the mental toughness required to excel as a quarterback.“Brandon taught Jaxson about football from an early age, helping him understand the game’s details and how quarterbacks can outsmart defenses,” family friends note. Meanwhile, his mother, Kara, a former Nordstrom employee and passionate runner, provided emotional guidance, often traveling long distances to support her son through college transitions.Kara Dart has been a constant source of encouragement and clarity for Jaxson. When he faced uncertainty transferring from USC to Ole Miss, it was Kara’s steady voice that helped him navigate the decision. She never pushed him but guided him to think critically about his choices. Jaxson credits her for keeping him confident and focused, allowing him to thrive in challenging moments. Beyond emotional support, Kara also advises on his fashion choices for pre-game walkouts, merging her Nordstrom experience with her son’s rising public profile.Together, Brandon and Kara created a balance of discipline, strategy, and encouragement that allowed Jaxson to pursue his dreams fully. Their influence is evident in Dart’s poise on the field, his leadership among teammates, and his ability to embrace high-pressure moments with confidence. The Jaxson Dart era isn’t just about football—it’s about a family’s unwavering belief in a young man’s potential.Also Read: ""It's going to be painful"": Packers’ Micah Parsons discusses the stakes of taking on Dak Prescott in in Dallas return",Jaxson Dart will start for the New York Giants against the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday.

LeBron James’ agent Rich Paul urges fans and critics not to worry about his future

LeBron James yet to reflect on Los Angeles Lakers new roster



As NBA training camp approaches, speculation about LeBron James ’ future with the Los Angeles Lakers continues to grow. ESPN insider Shams Charania recently reached out to Klutch Sports founder Rich Paul for clarity on the issue. Earlier this offseason, Paul suggested James could consider leaving if the Lakers did not improve the roster. Since then the team has added new stalwarts, but it is still unclear if that satisfies James’ championship hopes.Reportedly, LeBron James was worried at the start of summer that the Los Angeles Lakers would focus more on Luka Doncic. To support the Luka-LeBron pairing, the Lakers signed DeAndre Ayton, Marcus Smart, and Jake LaRavia.Shams Charania said, “I think the other thing that sits here as well is Bryce James is gonna start his freshman year at college. How does he look in that prospect? How does he play into the 2026 NBA Draft? These are the things that LeBron James is open-minded about.”With all the questions about his future, his agent Rich Paul said people should focus on the present. According to ESPN’s Shams Charania, Paul said, “It’s important not to worry about the future when it comes to LeBron James. Just appreciate the present.”LeBron James added more fuel to speculation by using his $52.6 million player option for the next season.Many think he might ask for a trade later if the Lakers are not competing for a championship and join a contender instead.So far, James has not shared his views on the Lakers’ offseason moves. ESPN’s Shams Charania noted that LeBron’s opinion on these changes could shape his next steps.

NHL Trade Rumors: New Jersey Devils’ Luke Hughes holdout continues as preseason begins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-new-jersey-devils-luke-hughes-holdout-continues-as-preseason-begins/articleshow/124078520.cms,"Getty Images

Luke Hughes holdout continues during contract standoff with insight from NHL insider Elliotte Friedman

32 Thoughts Podcast

“As far as I heard on Sunday night, nothing had changed on Luke Hughes, that there was still a bit of a gulf there and they were still working on a long-term deal,”

“I don’t think it’s collusion or anything like that; but I definitely think there is a ‘we have to hold the line’ to some level.”

Ongoing negotiations and what lies ahead for Hughes

As the New Jersey Devils kick off their preseason, defenseman Luke Hughes remains unsigned, extending his holdout into the start of training camp. The 22-year-old, considered one of the team’s top defensive prospects, is reportedly in contract negotiations with the Devils for a long-term deal. Both sides remain at an impasse over the average annual value, creating uncertainty around Hughes’ participation in upcoming preseason games.The holdout has drawn attention not only for its timing but also for its broader implications on NHL contract negotiations. On the latest(9/22), Elliotte Friedman discussed the situation, highlighting a trend among re-extension eligible stars.Friedman said. Regarding the NHL landscape, he added,The Devils and Hughes’ camp remain focused on structuring a contract that reflects Hughes’ potential as a top-tier defenseman while also adhering to the team’s salary-cap strategy. Hughes previously missed the first five days of training camp, surpassing last season’s holdout by Dawson Mercer.The core of the disagreement lies in Hughes’ long-term value versus the team’s approach to the rising NHL salary cap. Hughes’ agent, Pat Brisson, is reportedly advocating for compensation that reflects Hughes’ ascension as the team’s future No.1 defenseman, while the Devils aim to manage cap flexibility in a changing market.Even if Hughes does not secure a roster spot immediately, he remains committed to the Devils organization. Analysts note that the passing of the torch from Dougie Hamilton to Hughes may have already begun, as Hughes assumed PP1 duties last season. Until an agreement is reached, Hughes will continue to sit out, and the preseason games will proceed without him.Luke Hughes’ holdout underscores the growing complexities of NHL contract negotiations in the era of rising salary caps. With both sides showing commitment but remaining firm on key points, the situation is a high-stakes negotiation that will shape not only Hughes’ career but also the Devils’ defensive future. Analysts and fans alike will be watching closely as discussions continue.Also Read: Toronto Maple Leafs prospect Ben Danford stands out against Ottawa Senators","New Jersey Devils defenseman Luke Hughes remains unsigned, extending his holdout into training camp.

Xavier Worthy ’s injury setback and road to recovery

Chiefs’ offense struggles while awaiting reinforcements

The Kansas City Chiefs may have snapped their early-season skid with a win over the New York Giants, but injuries continue to cast a shadow over their campaign. Wide receiver Xavier Worthy, who injured his shoulder in Week 1, remains the biggest question mark heading into Week 4.Xavier Worthy’s NFL debut against the Los Angeles Chargers ended in disappointment when he suffered a torn labrum following a collision with tight end Travis Kelce . Since then, the rookie has been sidelined, missing matchups against both the Philadelphia Eagles and the Giants. Despite five straight limited practices, his recovery is far from complete.Reports suggest that while Worthy has shown progress, he will be playing with a harness for the foreseeable future. That raises concerns about his durability and the risk of aggravating the injury if rushed back too soon. Head coach Andy Reid is aware of the gamble, balancing the need for offensive firepower with the long-term health of his promising wideout.Without Worthy and with Rashee Rice serving a six-game suspension, the Chiefs’ passing game has lacked its usual explosiveness. Marquise Brown has stepped into the No. 1 role, supported by Tyquan Thornton, but defenses have adjusted quickly to Kansas City’s limited depth.Even in their win over the Giants, the Chiefs struggled to capitalize on key opportunities. A fumble by Brashard Smith, a two-yard loss on a Kelce reception, and a missed 40-yard field goal from Harrison Butker highlighted just how thin the margin for error has become.Still, Reid found some positives after the game. “I love Travis’ passion, man,” Reid said after a heated sideline exchange with Kelce, emphasizing the team’s intensity. For now, fans will have to wait and see if Worthy’s return can ignite an offense searching for consistency.Also Read: Who is C.J. Brewer?

Shedeur Sanders’s stunning fall in the NFL Draft and his current challenge



Deion Sanders ’s bold prediction for Shedeur’s Browns future



Shedeur Sanders’s surprising slide in April’s NFL Draft landed him in the fifth round with the Cleveland Browns, a team already juggling veteran Joe Flacco and fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel. That crowded depth chart initially clouded his path to meaningful playing time. Yet, an impressive preseason by Sanders sparked optimism. And now, his father—Hall of Famer and Colorado coach Deion Sanders—has turned that optimism into a bold prediction.Shedeur’s draft-night tumble caught many by surprise. Once projected as a higher-round selection, he instead heard his name called much later than expected. Cleveland saw opportunity where others hesitated, taking him with the intention of developing him behind veterans. But preseason glimpses revealed a poised rookie with flashes of starter potential.Still, his current reality is uphill. Shedeur is listed as Cleveland’s third quarterback, behind Flacco and Gabriel. Stefanski made it clear Gabriel earned the backup job with strong preseason evaluations. Meanwhile, Flacco’s performance has been less than steady—631 yards, two touchdowns, and four interceptions through three games, with a QBR ranked among the league’s worst.The Browns’ defense has carried them to a 1–2 start, but the offense has yet to score more than 20 points in a game.Speaking on the New Heights podcast with Jason and Travis Kelce, Deion didn’t hide his belief in his son’s opportunity.""Be patient and be ready,"" he advised Shedeur. ""You got to be ready when it’s time. But when it’s time, you’re going to know. And it’s coming up. I got a prediction. I ain’t telling nobody. I got a feeling when it’s going to go down. But it’s going to go down this year—he’s going to get a shot.""That confidence from “Coach Prime” mirrors his consistent message about belief and preparation. The Browns view Flacco as a temporary bridge, but with the offense sputtering, the window for change could open sooner than expected. Whether Shedeur gets his chance in 2025 remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: Deion Sanders expects that first start to come before the season ends.Also Read: “Disappointed with how he played”: Mike Tomlin talks Aaron Rodgers’ struggles during opening weeks of season","Shedeur Sanders was drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round of the NFL Draft.

Brewer to their 53-man roster from the practice squad due to Calijah Kancey's injury. Brewer, who previously played for the Houston Roughnecks in the XFL, brings valuable experience and interior pressure to the Buccaneers' defense. His role will be crucial in the upcoming game against the Philadelphia Eagles.

C.J. Brewer ’s road from XFL standout to Buccaneers contributor

Why C.J. Brewer matters for the Buccaneers’ defensive strategy



The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are turning to a familiar face to reinforce their banged-up defensive line. Ahead of their Week 4 matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles, the team signed defensive tackle C.J. Brewer to the 53-man roster after starting the season on the practice squad.For many fans, C.J. Brewer may not be a household name yet, but his football journey shows why the Buccaneers keep turning back to him. After a breakout season in the XFL with the Houston Roughnecks, Brewer joined Tampa Bay in 2023 and immediately proved he belonged. That season, he played in 12 games, recording 12 tackles, two sacks, and two passes defended—solid production for a rotational lineman carving out a role on a playoff-caliber roster.The Buccaneers’ faith in Brewer isn’t just about numbers. His relentless motor and ability to create pressure from the interior have earned him the trust of coaches and teammates alike. In a defense that prides itself on toughness and depth, Brewer brings both at a time when Tampa Bay needs stability the most.The move comes after rookie defensive tackle Calijah Kancey suffered a torn pectoral, forcing the team to reshuffle its depth chart.With Elijah Simmons already added from the Cardinals’ practice squad and Desmond Watson rejoining via Tampa’s own practice unit, Brewer’s promotion signals that the Buccaneers value his experience in Todd Bowles’ system.Against an Eagles offensive line that ranks among the league’s strongest, Brewer could see meaningful snaps sooner than later. His ability to rotate with veterans like Vita Vea will be critical in slowing down Philadelphia’s run-heavy attack.Also Read: Derrick Henry redeems himself with eye-catching first quarter, leaving Lions defense reeling For Brewer, Sunday’s matchup isn’t just another chance to suit up—it’s an opportunity to remind fans exactly who he is: a determined defensive tackle who has worked his way back into the spotlight.",Tampa Bay Buccaneers signed defensive tackle C.J.

Tom Brady ’s sentimental captions celebrate fatherhood but stir deeper speculation

A family shaped by two marriages and a high-profile divorce

Tom Brady may be retired from football, but his latest Instagram activity has fans wondering if he’s still holding onto more than just game-day memories. The NFL legend recently shared a series of throwback photos of his children, paired with heartfelt captions that many believe hint at a deeper reflection on his past family life with ex-wife Gisele Bündchen.The former New England Patriots star posted a set of pictures featuring his three children—Jack, Benjamin, and Vivian. One touching caption read: “Two little stars (not so little anymore) lighting up my life,” alongside a photo of his sons in Patriots jerseys.Brady’s love for his daughter shone through in another post: “My precious Girlie Girl. I love you infinity x infinity.” He added a tender note on a separate image: “Tiny hands, a big smile, and the biggest heart - forever my baby girl.” His final throwback circled back to his sons, calling them his “Mini Mischiefs, Maximum cuteness.”Though framed as a celebration of fatherhood, the posts carried a wave of nostalgia.

NHL insider reveals shocking Penguins decision involving rookie Ville Koivunen’s place in opening night lineup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-insider-reveals-shocking-penguins-decision-involving-rookie-ville-koivunens-place-in-opening-night-lineup/articleshow/124080712.cms,"Penguins rookie Ville Koivunen shocks insiders as Josh Yohe confirms opening night roster lock (Imagn Images)

Penguins rookie Ville Koivunen secures his place in opening-night lineup



A crucial moment in Penguins’ rebuild



The Pittsburgh Penguins may have just found their next breakout star. NHL insider Josh Yohe revealed that rookie winger Ville Koivunen is “a lock to start the season” on the opening-night roster, a development that signals both opportunity and change for a franchise balancing veterans with fresh talent.Koivunen’s journey to this point has been anything but ordinary. Drafted in the second round in 2021, he made an early splash last spring during an eight-game call-up, posting seven assists and proving he could keep pace at the NHL level. That performance placed him firmly on the radar, but his waiver-exempt status left him at risk of being shuffled out for older players. Now, that risk seems gone.With Rutger McGroarty sidelined indefinitely due to an upper-body injury, Koivunen’s chance has grown even clearer. McGroarty was expected to compete directly with him for a top-six spot, but the vacancy has accelerated Koivunen’s rise. Current projections suggest he could line up next to Evgeni Malkin and Anthony Mantha, a role that offers both responsibility and visibility.Koivunen’s ascent couldn’t come at a better time for Pittsburgh. The 21-year-old Finnish forward has already proven his ability to adapt, leading AHL Wilkes-Barre/Scranton with 56 points in 63 games after a strong 56-point campaign in Finland’s Liiga.He has shown consistency across different stages, making the “prospect” label seem outdated.The Penguins, facing an aging core and uncertain playoff future, need young players who can carry the torch forward. As veterans like Bryan Rust or Rickard Rakell could soon become trade pieces, Koivunen’s role in the top six looks increasingly secure. His development since arriving in the Jake Guentzel trade has been rapid, and his presence offers fans a glimpse of what the next era of Penguins hockey might look like.For now, Koivunen is no longer just fighting for a roster spot. He is, in every sense, a player Pittsburgh must begin building around.Also Read: Connor McDavid reportedly chooses loyalty over speculation, standing firmly with Oilers teammates despite departure rumors","Pittsburgh Penguins rookie Ville Koivunen is “a lock to start the season’ on the opening-night roster, according to NHL insider Josh Yohe.

Wayne Gretzky as a unifying figure in Canadian culture

The Gretzky trade and questions of national pride



Wayne Gretzky’s name is often synonymous with greatness on the ice, but his impact extends far beyond goals and assists. In Canada, Gretzky has come to represent something larger: a symbol of national pride, resilience, and the complexities of Canadian identity in a country often overshadowed by its southern neighbor.When Wayne Gretzky entered the NHL in 1979, Canada was experiencing an era of political and cultural uncertainty. Debates over Quebec sovereignty, trade with the United States, and the ongoing struggle to define a modern Canadian identity made the country restless. Then came Gretzky, a small-town kid from Brantford, Ontario, who dominated hockey’s biggest stage with elegance and humility.His dominance wasn’t just athletic—it was cultural. Canadians saw themselves in him: polite, hardworking, and understated, yet capable of competing with the best in the world. Politicians often referenced Gretzky in speeches, framing him as proof that Canadian talent could thrive internationally. His success became a unifying force, giving Canadians something to rally around during times of division.The 1988 trade that sent Gretzky from the Edmonton Oilers to the Los Angeles Kings also revealed the political weight he carried. For many Canadians, the move felt like more than just a business decision—it was seen as a loss of cultural ownership.Editorials at the time compared it to selling a piece of Canada itself.Even today, Gretzky’s legacy remains political. His presence at events, his commentary on the growth of hockey in the U.S., and his role as a global ambassador for the sport keep him firmly linked to the story of Canada’s identity.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky’s controversial silence on Trump’s scandals: Loyalty over conscience?

LeBron James’ agent, Rich Paul, drops a subtle hint about his future in the league



LeBron James revealed he does not have a perfect marriage with his wife, Savannah James, after being together for over two decades



LeBron James, the Los Angeles Lakers’ star player and the NBA legend, is considered to be one of the most talented players in the world even at the age of 40. While many of his peers ended up retiring much before they turned 40, LeBron James has proved that age is just a number. As speculations about his potential retirement grow every year, his agent might have just hinted at something.A few hours ago, ESPN insider Shams Charania spoke about what LeBron James’ longtime agent and friend, Rich Paul, said about the NBA legend’s future in the league.Apparently, Rich Paul said, ""It's important not to worry about the future when it comes to LeBron James. Just appreciate the present.""This message of Rich Paul’s comes at a time when LeBron James’ last season’s performance was highly criticised. The NBA legend was also brutally slammed by fans when he sustained an injury and missed several matches but was always present to cheer on his son, Bronny James.However, neither LeBron James nor his team, the Los Angeles Lakers, have confirmed any speculations about his retirement.While LeBron James is known for his talent, his marriage to Savannah James has also been a topic of discussion in the last few days.LeBron James appeared on the Speedy Morman on the “360 with Speedy” where he was asked about his relationship with Savannah James, as the two have been together for over two decades.LeBron James said, “I’m gonna be honest. A relationship is never picture perfect. But if you’re OK with working through the hardships and the adverse moments, then it will make it all worth it, man.

Mike Tomlin praises Aaron Rodgers ’ leadership beyond the stat sheet

Aaron Rodgers’ chance to prove himself on international stage

The Pittsburgh Steelers are off to a 2-1 start in the 2025 NFL season, but the spotlight remains firmly on veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers . After a rocky debut and flashes of brilliance in recent weeks, head coach Mike Tomlin addressed whether the 41-year-old has truly lived up to expectations.When asked about Rodgers’ impact, Tomlin responded without hesitation: “He certainly has been (what we expected), and not only in terms of his play, but in terms of his relationship with the game. How he interacts with teammates. How he loves the preparation process. All of those things have been double thumbs up and so it’s reasonable to expect the in-stadium performance to mirror that.”Rodgers has thrown seven touchdowns across the first three games, including two in last week’s win over the New England Patriots. While he may not yet be operating at peak efficiency, Tomlin highlighted the intangibles Rodgers brings to the locker room—experience, poise, and a daily commitment that resonates with younger players.The Steelers’ next test comes against the Minnesota Vikings in Ireland, marking a pivotal matchup as the team seeks back-to-back wins. For Rodgers, it is not only a chance to silence doubts about his consistency but also an opportunity to solidify his role as the offensive anchor in what could be his final NFL season.“He may be disappointed with how he played last week, but we’ve got an opportunity this week to do something about it,” Tomlin added, stressing his confidence in the quarterback’s ability to rebound.Also Read: NFL analyst slams Donald Trump’s remarks at Charlie Kirk memorial as “absolutely insane” As Pittsburgh heads overseas, all eyes will be on Rodgers—whether his leadership and arm can help stabilize a team balancing early season highs and lingering questions.","Mike Tomlin praises Aaron Rodgers’ leadership beyond the stat sheet.

Deion Sanders admits turning down Eagles, Ravens calls

Colin Cowherd calls Deion’s decision completely insane

The bigger debate over backup roles and development

Deion Sanders’ revelation that both the Philadelphia Eagles and Baltimore Ravens explored drafting his son Shedeur has ignited a storm of commentary — none sharper than Colin Cowherd’s. On Tuesday, the veteran broadcaster accused the Hall of Famer of “bad parenting” and of projecting his own glittering career onto his son, turning what could have been an NFL opportunity into a point of controversy.The Colorado head coach recently disclosed that the Eagles and Ravens placed calls about Shedeur before the draft. But Sanders made it clear that he didn’t want his son sitting as a backup behind established quarterbacks. “I never sat on the bench and learned a lot. Who learns sitting on the bench?” Sanders said, defending his stance. His insistence on a starting role for Shedeur has now become the center of a heated national debate.Cowherd wasted no time in dismantling Sanders’ logic. “Not great parenting, and this story has been under-covered because Deion’s very popular in the media. But this is insane,” he said. The Fox Sports host argued that many of the game’s greatest names — from Tom Brady to Aaron Rodgers to Patrick Mahomes — all benefited from early years spent studying and developing behind veterans.For Cowherd, the refusal to let Shedeur embrace that process was a critical misstep.In one of his sharpest remarks, Cowherd accused Deion of blurring the line between his own legendary playing career and his son’s trajectory. “This isn’t about you, Prime Time. Your son doesn’t have PrimeTime talent. He’s an after-school special. You were a Prime Time talent. Totally different ballgame. You’re projecting your talent onto your son,” Cowherd declared. His words underscored the perception that Deion’s protective instincts may be overshadowing Shedeur’s individual growth.The exchange highlights a wider debate in football about development, patience, and opportunity. While Deion believes his son should never settle for life as a backup, Cowherd insists that apprenticeship is often the pathway to greatness. With Shedeur still carving his own identity at Colorado under the relentless spotlight of his father, this clash of philosophies may define how the next chapter of his career unfolds.Also read: NFL sends warning to teams about players joining Saudi Arabia flag football event","Colin Cowherd calls Deion Sanders’ decision to turn down Eagles, Ravens calls “insane’” Sanders said he didn’t want his son Shedeur sitting as a backup behind established quarterbacks.

What can Winnipeg fans expect when their hometown legend finally gets to wear a Jets jersey? Toews is now ready to skate in his first-ever game for Winnipeg with excitement all around as the Jets face off against the Edmonton Oilers in a Canadian-level prestige preseason game on Tuesday night. Not only will the match have a ton of rivalry energy, but it will also set the stage to see exactly how Toews blends in with a roster intent on contesting for a title this season.The Jets, now coming off a loss in their preseason opener against the Minnesota Wild in overtime, will be trying to bounce back on Tuesday. Winnipeg lost the contest 3-2 after blowing a two-goal lead, with Morgan Barron and Danny Zhilkin getting their only goals. Now it becomes all about Toews, who should be skating alongside Cole Perfetti and Gustav Nyquist in what may well be his line come regular season times.For Toews, it is the moment not only of returning to an NHL rink but also a homecoming moment in front of Winnipeg fans. A three-time Stanley Cup winner, he brings undue leadership and winning credentials to a hopeful playoff roster. His impact will not come from one preseason game; on the flip side, his presence sets the bar for both locker room and fan base expectations right away.Apart from Toews, there are other storylines worth following. Elias Salomonsson, who registered an assist in the opener, continues to make the case for a roster spot. Should he impress further, he could find himself as the Jets' seventh defenseman and possibly be relied upon for increased minutes alongside veteran Luke Schenn.Danny Zhilkin continues to be watched after his great showing in prospect games.

CHANDIGARH: Group Captain Sharad Aneja, who served as a fighter pilot with the Indian Air Force (IAF) from 1993 to 2016, speaks of the MiG-21 with the kind of affection that words struggle to hold. ""You can't ask a person in love to describe his beloved,"" he says. ""In my opinion, no words can describe the MiG-21— it can only be felt. My comments would be just a drop in that ocean of praise for such a machine.""His memories with the aircraft are as sharp as the day they were lived. Aneja recalls long stints on the ORP — Operation Readiness Platform — manning the northern and western borders. Two aircraft, two pilots, always at the edge of the runway, on five-minute or two-minute standby, ready to scramble at a moment's notice.One such day in 1996 had almost drawn to a close. The western front seemed quiet, their duty nearly over — when suddenly the sirens wailed. A scramble. In those moments, time compressed. The ground crew rushed to action, supplying electrical power and pulling out safety pins, while the pilots strapped in with clockwork precision. Training took over; instincts ruled. Within two minutes, the MiG-21s roared down the runway, climbing into the evening sky.The two-ship formation was vectored close to the border where radar had picked up an unidentified track. Eyes strained, radars scanned, searching for something low and elusive. Drones were not common then, but nothing could be ruled out. They flew orbit after orbit, run after run — yet found nothing. And then, just as they were about to give up, they saw it. A balloon. A shiny silver birthday balloon, floating serenely at 3,000 feet. Never had Aneja felt such relief in facing a non-threatening ""threat."" At speeds of 700–800 kmph, spotting that tiny glint in the sky was itself a tribute to the sharpness of MiG-21 pilots.On MiG-21 often carrying harsh labels like ""flying coffin,"" ""widow maker,"" Aneja said, ""It's a matter of individual perspective, and I am no one to comment,"" he says softly. ""One has to respect the machine and operate it within its prescribed envelope. I was always in awe and in love with it. This thought never even crossed my mind.""His own journey with the MiG-21 began in 1994, fresh out of the Air Force Academy in Dundigal, Hyderabad. From the modest Kiran trainer, landing at 180 kmph, he stepped into the MiG-21, touching down at 340 kmph — a leap as dramatic as it was daunting. Yet mastering the jet was never about bravado; it was about dedication and hard work. Once tamed, the MiG-21 became an extension of body and soul. ""It was a sports car, a combat jet, a deadly bomber — or simply pure joy. ""On phasing out of the iconic flying machine, he added that its vintage and the dwindling supply of spares became its greatest limitations. Still, it remained the workhorse and backbone of the IAF for decades, carrying its weight with quiet dignity.Today, as he flies in the commercial sector, Aneja accepts the phasing out of his beloved machine with a mix of pride and inevitability. ""All good things have to come to an end,"" he reflects. ""Safety has always been the IAF's core virtue. Once they realised it was no longer feasible to fly the MiG-21 safely, they must have taken that decision with every consideration. But for those of us who lived it, the MiG-21 will always be more than just a machine. ""","Group Captain Sharad Aneja served as a fighter pilot with the Indian Air Force (IAF) from 1993 to 2016.

“I think the biggest factor in why Conor McGregor may fight is because no one believes him anymore,”

“Some of that shine is starting to wear off. It doesn’t matter how much money you’ve got; when you’re a guy that developed the level of stardom he reached, and you love the attention, when it starts to fade, you come back and do what you did before.”

Conor McGregor is dreaming big again. The former UFC featherweight and lightweight champion recently teased what could be his final dance in the Octagon, and this time, the venue itself is making headlines. Many fans had long assumed that McGregor, one of MMA’s most electrifying stars, might never return to fight. But questions reappeared when the UFC announced a landmark event at the White House in 2026. McGregor appears dead serious about participating, and with his immense star power, he is a natural frontrunner to headline the card.Yet, McGregor has hinted at a venue even more catchy, one that doesn’t exist in reality. Sharing a post from an account on Instagram, he showcased Paul Pfeiffer’s 2008 sculpture, Vitruvian Figure, which envisions a 1,000,000-seater stadium created in collaboration with the architects behind Sydney’s Olympic Stadium.Alongside the post, McGregor wrote,and added,expressing confidence that he could fill the stadium on his own.Also Read: “There’s s stronger possibility”: Daniel Cormier exposes the harsh truth behind Conor McGregor’s planned UFC return While the White House remains a realistic and historic option, the sculpture represents the boundless scale and spectacle that McGregor seems to crave for his swan song.

He is the youngest American captain since Arnold Palmer in 1963 at age 39. Bradley told The Post that his bond with Bethpage Black, which he visited during college, played a big part in shaping the team's approach. Being so familiar with the course allows him to devise specific game plans for various players and should give Team USA an advantage.Bradley made several big calls, one of them being the six captain's picks he chose Collin Morikawa, Cameron Young, Sam Burns, and the like. His selections suggest a desire to build an aligned team rather than depend only on history.

Matt Shaw explains his bond with Charlie Kirk



Matt Shaw is unfazed by criticism over missed game



Chicago Cubs star Matt Shaw has spoken publicly for the first time about his decision to miss a crucial game in order to attend the memorial service of conservative activist Charlie Kirk . The 23-year-old infielder skipped Sunday’s 1-0 loss to the Cincinnati Reds, a matchup with playoff implications, but insists honoring Kirk in Arizona was something he could not pass up.Addressing reporters Tuesday at Wrigley Field, Matt Shaw described the personal connection he shared with Kirk, who was assassinated earlier this month while speaking at Utah Valley University. The two met while living in the same apartment complex in Arizona and grew close over their shared Christian faith.“My connection with Charlie was through our [Christian] faith,” Shaw said (per Chicago Sun-Times). “That’s something that drives me every day, the reason why I’m able to do what I do every day, and that’s something I’m extremely thankful for.”Shaw called Kirk “one of the biggest Cubs fans I’ve ever met,” adding that the 31-year-old would “text me after every game.” He recalled being overcome with emotion when he learned of Kirk’s death, saying teammates offered him support as he grieved.When Kirk’s widow, Erika, personally invited him to the memorial at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Shaw said the decision was clear. “I felt as though it was something that was really important for me to do,” he explained.Shaw acknowledged the backlash surrounding his absence, given the Cubs are battling for playoff positioning, but emphasized that his priorities in the moment were firmly rooted in faith and loyalty to his late friend.“Whatever backlash comes is OK,” he said. “I feel strong about my faith and that what was meant to be happened.”The Cubs star also confirmed he had the team’s approval before traveling to Arizona and expressed gratitude for the support he received from manager Craig Counsell and his teammates.The Cubs also honored Kirk in their own way, flying the flag at half-staff at Wrigley Field in accordance with MLB’s league-wide tribute. For Shaw, though, the choice to attend the memorial was about something more personal. “If people are wondering who I am and what I stand for,” he said, “I’d say that my faith and the many blessings I’ve been given are why I’m able to be here.”Shaw returned to the lineup Tuesday, slated to bat eighth in the Cubs’ series opener against the New York Mets.Also Read: Chicago Cubs rookie Matt Shaw missed the game against Cincinnati Reds to attend memorial for Charlie Kirk in Arizona","Chicago Cubs rookie Matt Shaw missed Sunday's game against Cincinnati Reds to attend memorial for Charlie Kirk in Arizona.

Joseph Woll's leave of absence confirmed by Maple Leafs management

Joseph Woll's breakout year and big contract with Toronto

Why exactly is Joseph Woll stepping away from the Leafs just as preparations for the new NHL season shoot into full gear? The 27-year-old goaltender is on a leave of absence to handle a personal family matter; the organization has confirmed his absence, with no timeline presently given for the goaltender to return. Fans observantly wait for further updates on the matter.The announcement came in the morning, just prior to Toronto's scheduled preseason encounter with the Ottawa Senators. General manager Brad Treliving addressed the press, emphasizing the club would respect Woll's privacy and would not provide any further information. Treliving said the team fully expects Woll will return to the roster, but cannot give a timeframe for when that will happen.That statement stood by the situation, asking the media and fans for some respect regarding Woll’s situation while reminding everyone that the focus was on providing the space Woll needed for his family matters before coming back to the ice. In the meantime, goaltending responsibilities will be shared among the rest of the netminders at camp until the outlook on Woll becomes clearer.This absence just happens to coincide with his breakout year.He played 42 games in the 2023-24 season with the Maple Leafs and posted a 27-14-1 record with a 90.9 save percentage. However, he could not hold the spotlight through the playoffs much after replacing Anthony Stolarz due to a concussion, as he finished with an 88.6 save percentage in seven games versus the Florida Panthers.Earlier this summer, Toronto signed Woll to a three-year, $11 million contract extension beginning this season, expressing confidence in him. Drafted 62nd overall in 2016, Woll has slowly made his way into the NHL, and the franchise considers him to be a cornerstone of its future between the pipes.Also Read: Alex Ovechkin’s NHL future unclear as he enters his final contract year The timing of Joseph Woll's leave indeed leaves some awkwardly uncertain times for the Maple Leafs, but still, supporting their goaltender remains their primary concern.

Super Bowl champ C.J. Gardner-Johnson released by Texans in shocking early-season move,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/super-bowl-champ-c-j-gardner-johnson-released-by-texans-in-shocking-early-season-move/articleshow/124077565.cms,"C.J. Gardner-Johnson (Image Source: Getty)

Why the Texans made the move

What’s next for C.J. Gardner-Johnson

After only three games into the 2025 NFL season, the Houston Texans have released veteran safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson in a surprise move. The decision to cut the DB comes barely a year after he signed a three-year contract with the team to bolster their secondary, but, given his experience, versatility, and leadership in the locker room, the move has stunned fans and analysts alike.Reports suggest that Gardner-Johnson was released partly because of mediocre play and partly because of issues within the building in Houston. Though he had been viewed as a key part of the defensive backfield, his snap count had fluctuated during the first three weeks. Clearly, it's more important to DeMeco Ryans and the Texans' front office staff to develop their younger guys in the secondary than it is to find an established veteran to help in the short term.Houston could change things up a bit during the season, and Gardner-Johnson's release gives them some salary cap flexibility. The Texans are in the thick of the race for the AFC South right now, and the front office clearly is prepared to make aggressive moves to keep them out front.Also Read: Top 5 artists who could perform at the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show Even with this unexpected action, Gardner-Johnson is a top option; thus, he shouldn't be hitting free agency for long. He is a 2022 Super Bowl champion with the Philadelphia Eagles and has made a name for himself as a physical, versatile defensive back who can play safety and nickel corner.Several teams that need veteran leadership and depth in the secondary, including those with playoff ambitions, could come calling. The fact that Gardner-Johnson is an adept, aggressive player who is known to come out of hibernation with impact plays when teams need him most makes him a notable signing for teams looking to build in the mid-term run.The release is just the next chapter in a career that has already seen its share of highs and lows for Gardner-Johnson. How he responds to this newest chapter will go a long way in determining the next chapter of his NFL career, and many in the league will certainly keep a close eye on wherever he resurfaces.",The Houston Texans have released veteran safety C.J.

Bill Belichick faces mounting pressure after UCF loss



AI distractions overshadow UNC’s on-field reality



It used to be a lighthearted storyline, but now the situation surrounding Bill Belichick at North Carolina feels more troubling. The legendary former New England Patriots coach, now 73, has stumbled badly in his first month leading the Tar Heels. A 34-9 blowout loss to UCF dropped his team to 1-3, leaving fans wondering if this experiment is unraveling faster than anyone imagined.Belichick’s transition to college football was never going to be simple, but the early signs have been brutal. Three lopsided defeats in four games have tested both his legacy and patience. Adding to the drama is his 24-year-old girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, whose constant presence on the sidelines and in the tunnel after games continues to stir debate. Her visibility has become part of the conversation around Belichick’s tenure, whether he likes it or not.Sports media voices have not held back. Bill Simmons, speaking on The Bill Simmons Podcast, admitted his dismay at watching his football hero endure such struggles. ""[Me and] all my Pats fans, we're just like, 'wow',"" Simmons said. ""Could this be going worse? Like this is the greatest NFL coach of all time. This has been the most humiliating year ever.He's getting his a* kicked in these games. He's got this 25 year old coming on the sidelines when he's trying to coach. Like, how did he get to this point?""*As if defeats weren’t enough, digital noise has made the situation even murkier. A viral AI-altered video appeared to show Belichick and Hudson sharing a sideline kiss. The clip, viewed nearly 5 million times, later proved fake. Yet it only intensified the circus, leaving the on-field product overshadowed by online chatter.For now, UNC fans are desperate for wins, not memes. But until Belichick finds a way to stabilize the Tar Heels, his coaching comeback may remain defined less by football and more by the noise surrounding it.Also Read: Chiefs’ Travis Kelce and Andy Reid get into fiery sideline argument on live broadcast: Is everything going well between these two?","Bill Belichick's North Carolina team is 1-3 after a 34-9 loss to UCF.
