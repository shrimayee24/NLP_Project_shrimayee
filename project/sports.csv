"Modern battlefields, ancient strategies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modern-battlefields-ancient-strategies/articleshow/118025121.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

Life is a war; some days, it is merely a battle. Armouring our hearts, we navigate professions, relationships, friends, and foes, and march forward, sometimes with steady steps, sometimes staggering. Some battles are fought within, silent and unseen, while others are waged against the world. We fight to claim what is rightfully ours, to protect what we have painstakingly earned, against injustice, betrayal, and humiliation.

Since we must fight anyway, let us learn to fight well—and fight right. I have learned invaluable lessons about warfare from three different encounters. The most recent comes from a young girl who has made the nation proud—Vaishali Rameshbabu, the chess prodigy who constantly battles to step out of the shadow of her brother Praggnanandhaa.

Recently the Tata Steel Chess Tournament match witnessed an awkward moment— when Vaishali extended her hand for a customary pre-match handshake to Uzbek Grandmaster Nodirbek Yakubboev, but was ignored. Some say this was a psychological tactic, an attempt to unnerve her. Yet, Vaishali remained unshaken. She did not react or look up. Instead, she descended deep within herself, seeing only the 64 squares before her. And then, in a poetic stroke of justice, she defeated her opponent with ease. When you fight, expect humiliation. Swallow it. There is only one way to respond—by winning.

A karate master once shared a story about a ten-year-old boy born without a right arm. The master admitted him to his dojo, moved by the boy’s passion for the sport. When the school faced a rival in a karate tournament, the boy volunteered to compete, even though he was only a reserve. The opposing team had an undefeated star—a warrior who finished each match within seconds. As his teammates fell one by one, the boy stepped forward. The master hesitated but admiring the boy’s courage, allowed him to fight.

As soon as the bout began, the one-armed boy took down the champion and within minutes, he emerged victorious. Later, the master asked the boy how he achieved the impossible. The boy smiled and said, “I observed his pattern—he always seizes the opponent’s right hand before attacking. But he was lost since I had no right hand. Those few seconds of confusion were all I needed to strike.” What we perceive as our weakness can be our greatest strength, and vice versa.

A close associate once underwent a rigorous selection process for a leadership role. She was meticulous and did quite well in the grilling rounds. Observers felt she was the strongest candidate but in the end, she did not make it. Only later did she realise that the decision had been made before the interviews began. She opted to leave the organisation, but had learnt something during her struggle.

The key is to assess the battlefield before preparing for war . You may be a great warrior but if the terrain is set for someone else’s victory, you may not accomplish success.

Valluvar , with his penetrating insights into human psychology, their strengths and weaknesses, gave useful tips for any battle one has to combat.

“Vinaivaliyum Thanvaliyum Maatraan Valiyum

Thunaivaliyum Thookki Cheyal.”

“Assess the force the strife demands, assess your strengths, then that of foes and the allies of both; If favourable, then jump to fight”

The art of battle is not just about fighting. It is about knowing when and how to fight. Even if there is a loss, we return and begin again. Honour and valour are awarded to those who move forward and flourish in their journey.

PANAJI: The Derbi Madrileno or Madrid Derby holds plenty of promise. A depleted Real Madrid and a fired up Atletico Madrid are separated by just a point after 22 matches at the top of the Liga table.When the teams met earlier in the season, it ended 1-1, a feisty game that saw Atletico grab a stoppage time equaliser.The return leg could be a potentially season-defining clash at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday, even though Real Madrid are handicapped with several absentees, particularly in defence. Carlo Ancelotti ’s Real are now without Antonio Rudiger and David Alaba, who joined the sick bay alongside right-back Dani Carvajal, regular centre-back Eder Militao and midfielder Eduardo Camavinga.Even a makeshift defence will not dampen Madrid’s enthusiasm at home, feels Diego Forlan, the former Uruguay striker who spent five years at crosstown rivals Atletico (2007-2011) and won the Golden Boot in 2009, during which he scored 32 goals.""I don't think there's any advantage (for Atletico) because of the injuries,"" Forlan told TOI during a global media interaction, arranged by La Liga earlier this week. ""Real Madrid have a deep squad with so much quality. Many important players will be missing, but with a squad that Madrid possess, they are still at the top of the table. Even though they don't have the regular starting XI, I'm sure it's a team that you have to respect, because they will have others (who can dominate).""Forlan scored over 300 goals in a storied career that won him the Golden Ball for the best player at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. At the club level, the Uruguayan striker won the Pichichi Trophy — the award for the top goalscorer in a La Liga season — at both Atletico and Villareal. Yet, when it came to the Madrid Derby, Forlan didn't taste similar success.In his four seasons at Atletico between 2007 and 2011, Forlan played eight Madrid derbies that resulted in seven losses and one draw. The lack of success wasn't Forlan's fault; between 1999 and 2013, Atletico didn't win in 25 meetings with Madrid, until the arrival of Diego Simeone eventually changed their fortunes. ""Well, we were close to winning against Real Madrid on several occasions but lost or drew. That trend has now changed. So, whether you're playing at home or away, I think the Derby is a lot more equal today. They are now playing on more equal footing,"" said Forlan.It is Simeone's arrival at Atletico that has helped restore the balance. In the 41 derbies played since then, Atletico have won 12, drawing 14 and losing 15. Madrid, though, continue to be the giants, so does Atletico have anything to prove to their city rivals or the world?""There's nothing to prove, you know, for a side that has been great for the last 10 years, winning lots of trophies (even) at the European level. They've made it to the final of the UEFA Champions League (losing to Madrid). This is an important derby, like El Clasico. Atletico and Madrid have always had great players, the derbies were spectacular. Today, the stakes are a lot higher since it's being watched all over the world,"" said Forlan.While Madrid are struggling at the back, their attacking players are fit and firing. There's Kylian Mbappe – playing his first derby after missing the first leg -- Rodrygo and Vinicius, all striking form. At the other end, there's Julian Alvarez, Antonio Griezmann and, of course, Simeone's son Giuliano, ""a real fighter with similar characteristics (like his father), one of the best signings.""",Diego Forlan feels the Derbi Madrileno is now similar to El Clasico.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

NAGPUR: When Harshit Rana took the field in Nagpur for his ODI debut, he was dragging the echoes of controversy behind him. Having come in as a contentious concussion substitute in place of Shivam Dube in the fourth T20I, there was a lot of talk about whether India had been lucky to get away with the decision to replace a batting allrounder with a full-time fast bowler.The subtle jabs from England captain Jos Buttler didn’t help matters.On Thursday, the 23-year-old Delhi pacer hushed the noise.His fiery 3-53 kept England below 250 and ensured an emphatic victory for India in the first ODI in Nagpur. ""People will always talk,"" Rana said. ""I just want to play. I’m not bothered, I want to deliver for my country.""Rana’s ODI debut had its ups and downs. The first storm hit early. His KKR teammate Phil Salt teed off in a brutal 26-run over, hitting three sixes and two fours. But Rana, unshaken, dismissed Ben Duckett and Harry Brook in a crucial over that swung the match.""There are always ups and downs in cricket. I wanted to focus on my lengths, bowl where I have to and I got reward for that later. In my second spell, I just focused on hitting the right areas,"" Rana said, adding: ""It’s a long format. You have to play different roles in different phases.""",Harshit Rana takes three-wicket haul on ODI debut for India in Nagpur. Delhi pacer's fiery 3-53 kept England below 250 in first ODI.

KOLKATA: After Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, it's time for Suryakumar Yadav to strive at getting back among the runs through domestic cricket. In a series which India convincingly won 4-1 against England, the India T20I skipper managed just 28 runs in five innings. He failed to open his account on two occasions and his highest score of 14 did not speak well about the middle-order batter's talent and potential.However, Surya was candid to admit his shortcomings.""If I did well, I would have been in the Champions Trophy team. If I don't do well, it's important to accept that,"" he said before the start of the five-match T20I series against England. The batter was seen working out long hours at the nets a day before Mumbai take on Haryana in a Ranji Trophy quarterfinal at the Eden Gardens here from Saturday. ""I am hopeful of getting my touch back,"" he stated while boarding the team bus.Surya, who last played for his state side earlier this season, scored seven runs in a nine-wicket win over Maharashtra. He returned to the Mumbai side along with allrounder Shivam Dube , giving Mumbai skipper Ajinkya Rahane a nice selection headache.They have three centurions from their previous game, with Siddhesh Lad, Akash Anand and Shams Mulani all getting three-figure scores in their biggest win — by an innings and 456 runs — against Meghalaya in their last group match to qualify for the knockouts.It will thus not be easy to rejig the side with the axe likely to fall on Amogh Bhatkal and Suryansh Shedge.While Shardul Thakur, along with left-arm spinner Shams Mulani and in-form off-spinner Tanush Kotian are likely to shoulder the bulk of the bowling load, Dube was also seen bowling quite a bit in the nets.With the match being shifted to Eden from Lahli at the last moment, Haryana will surely be deprived of their home advantage. But they have played some good cricket this season to make the quarters topping their group with 29 points. With skipper Ankit Kumar, Nishant Sindhu, Himanshu Rana and Yuvraj Singh all among runs, Haryana will hope to put up a good challenge for the defending champions.The Haryana bowlers have also risen to the challenge scripting come-from-behind victories against Punjab and Bengal this season. Pacer Anshul Kamboj has been the rising star of this season picking up 29 wickets in five Ranji matches so far. He is well assisted by Anuj Thakral while the return of Jayant Yadav will add value to the side's batting and bowling departments.","Suryakumar Yadav scored just 28 runs in five innings against England.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

MUMBAI: Soon after his blazing 36-ball 59 helped India coast to a four-wicket win over England in the opening ODI in Nagpur, Shreyas Iyer threw in the shocking revelation that he wasn't even in the team's starting XI for the match.In fact, he was busy watching a movie the night before the game, until the extent of Virat Kohli 's knee injury became clear and forced the Mumbai cricketer's last-minute inclusion.Walking in when India, chasing 249, had slipped to 19/2 in the sixth over, the Mumbaikar produced a stunning counter-attack, smashing two sixes and nine fours to leave England floored. ""So (it is a) funny story. I was watching a movie last night. I thought that I could extend my night, but then I got a call from the skipper saying that you may play because Virat has got a swollen knee. And then (I) hurried back to my room, went off to sleep straight away. I'm going to keep it lowkey and just cherish this moment, the victory,"" Iyer told Star Sports. ""I wasn't supposed to play the first game. Virat unfortunately got injured and then I got the opportunity. But I kept myself prepared, I knew that at any point of time I can get a chance to play.""The fact that he wasn't in the XI for the first ODI is surprising. Does Iyer enjoy the full confidence of the team management? It emerges that he was even in danger of not being picked for this series and even the Champions Trophy that follows before better sense prevailed. ""There was quite a fair bit of debate on his inclusion in the lengthy selection meeting in Mumbai recently. Ultimately, those backing him cited his ODI average (47.69), and he was selected,"" a source told TOI.It helped that the selectors didn't forget his fabulous show in the 2023 ODI World Cup, where he scored 530 runs in 11 matches at 66.25, with two centuries (including a 70-ball hundred in the semifinal against New Zealand at the Wankhede Stadium) and three fifties. His sublime form in domestic cricket — the 30-year-old scored 325 runs in five matches at 325 — with two centuries even as Mumbai were knocked out in the Vijay Hazare Trophy , buttressed Iyer's case. Many, including former Australian captain Ricky Ponting , currently the head coach of Punjab Kings, have been left stumped by the fact that Iyer, who was signed up for Rs 26.75 cr in the IPL auction last year, doesn't automatically find a spot in India's white-ball XI.Former India batsman Pravin Amre , who has coached Iyer from a young age at his Shivaji Park Gymkhana academy and then in the Mumbai team and Delhi Capitals, is pleased with the fact that Iyer is a part of the India squad again, considering that he doesn't even have an India contract as of now.""Before he left to join the Indian team for this series, I told him, ‘Wearing the India jersey again should be a proud moment for you. Hold it with both your hands. God is kind that you've got this opportunity (to play for India) again.'""To be in the India squad is a big thing, and I'm very happy that he's there. And now, after the kind of innings that he's played, he's given a good headache to the decision-makers before the next game (should Kohli recover from his injury), and at the same time, shut his critics,"" Amre told TOI.For someone well-versed with minute details about Iyer's batting, what impressed Amre about the batter's innings was the ease with which he tackled the short ball, something often pointed out in the past to pan him. In the seventh over, Iyer smashed Jofra Archer's short balls for back-to-back sixes, pulling the pacer over deep midwicket and ramping him over the third man.""What was pleasing was that even though he was playing for India after more than six months, it never looked like he was playing for his place. He was playing for the team and did what the team needed him to do. When he walked out to bat, India were in trouble and England's pacers were bowling at 140-plus. I liked the way he timed the ball. He wasn't just slogging wildly. He was playing proper cricket shots. I'm just disappointed he got out to a spinner,"" said Amre.",Shreyas Iyer's blistering 59 helped India coast to a four-wicket win over England in the opening ODI in Nagpur. Iyer was even in danger of not being picked for this series and even the Champions Trophy that follows before better sense prevailed.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118047478,imgsize-155506,width-400,resizemode-4/118047478.jpg"

Eagles Superfan Shares Tips for Longevity



102-year-old Eagles fan shares tips for longevity

She Received a Special Recognition from the Eagles



Secrets to Longevity: Water, Walking, and Laughter



Are you an Eagles fan? Going to cheer for your team when they face and try to stop Chiefs from creating history in New Orleans on February 9? We assume you are one of the biggest fans of the team. But can you match the level of this 102-year-old woman in terms of supporting Eagles? We bet. Lets' meet Eloise Brown, who has been attending games for the team since she was 11, the time when the franchise was founded in 1933.In the world of sports, few fans can boast of a commitment as much as that of Eloise Brown, a 102-year-old die-hard Philadelphia Eagles supporter. For over a century, Brown has passionately cheered for her hometown team, never missing a single game. This season, her dedication was recognized in a heartwarming way—she was gifted a special Eagles jersey from team president Don Smolenski. But beyond her love for the game, Brown is now sharing the secrets behind her remarkable longevity.Eloise Brown’s loyalty to the Eagles is deeply rooted in her identity as a true Pennsylvanian. When asked why she loves the team so much, her answer is simple yet profound: ""I'm a Pennsylvanian. It's my state and my city,"" she told TODAY.com. Born 11 years before the Eagles franchise even existed, she has watched the team evolve over decades, experiencing both victories and heartbreaks.As the Eagles prepare to face the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl 59, Brown is getting ready for yet another monumental moment in her fan journey. This will be the fifth Super Bowl appearance she has witnessed, and she will be watching it surrounded by her children and grandchildren—a tradition that has always been at the heart of her football experience.Her granddaughter, Sabrina Hall, proudly shares that ""Mommom"" never misses a game and always has family around when the Eagles are playing. ""We all sit around, laugh and go up and down when they score,"" Brown says. ""Then we eat chips and have a good time.""Brown’s unwavering support for the team didn’t go unnoticed. This season, she had a once-in-a-lifetime experience when she attended the Eagles’ NFC East-clinching win against the Cowboys on Dec. 29. Accompanied by her granddaughters and great-grandson, Brown received a personalized Eagles jersey featuring her surname and the number 102, signifying her incredible age.But the surprises didn’t stop there. Brown also had the chance to meet head coach Nick Sirianni and several Eagles players, who welcomed her with admiration. Sirianni signed her poster, which read: ""102 Years old and still cheering for the BIRDS! GO EAGLES."" She even held a game ball given to her by the coach, humorously noting, ""I had no clue it was that heavy. It weighed more than me.""Through every high and low, Brown remains an optimistic fan. As the Eagles gear up for the big game, she exudes confidence in her team: “I’m happy when they win, and when they don't win, I'm sad. But they're going to win.""Beyond football, many wonder how Brown has managed to reach 102 years with such enthusiasm and energy. She credits a simple yet effective formula: staying hydrated, staying active, and maintaining a joyful outlook on life.""I like to drink water, I like to walk and I like to laugh,"" she shares, emphasizing the importance of positivity. Every day, weather permitting, Brown takes a 30-minute walk around her neighborhood, ensuring she remains physically active.She also values strong morals and faith, which she believes are essential to a fulfilling life. ""You want to blame everybody responsible for what's going on, but then look at themselves and say, ‘Wait a minute. Am I treating this person right?’"" she reflects.Even when watching games from home, Brown follows her own ritual: ""I'm not in charge of anything, but usually, I'll close my eyes, say a little something, and oop, they win,"" she laughs.Also Read: ""Makes football more dangerous"": Donald Trump takes another shot at NFL rule as he is going to make history in New Orleans As Super Bowl Sunday approaches, one thing is certain—Eloise Brown will be right where she has always been: cheering on her beloved Eagles, surrounded by family, laughter, and a lifetime of memories.","Eloise Brown, 102, has been a Philadelphia Eagles fan since she was 11 years old.

NEW DELHI: Carlos Alcaraz , the Spanish tennis sensation, continued his impressive run at the Rotterdam Open on Friday, securing a spot in the semi-finals with a commanding 6-2, 6-1 victory over his compatriot Pedro Martinez .The world number three, aiming to become the first Spaniard to triumph in Rotterdam, will next face Hubert Hurkacz of Poland in a bid to reach Sunday's final.Alcaraz's performance was nothing short of remarkable, as he maintained a high level of play throughout the match, without any significant dips in form.Despite the challenge of facing a fellow Spaniard, Alcaraz remained focused from the outset, breaking Martinez's serve in the opening game and never looking back.The gulf in class between the two players was evident, with Alcaraz showcasing his superiority through a combination of powerful groundstrokes and precise serving.He wrapped up the first set with an ace and carried the momentum into the second, capitalizing on Martinez's unforced errors to secure another early break.Alcaraz's relentless pursuit of victory was highlighted by a remarkable rally that showcased both players' athleticism and determination.Ultimately, the young Spaniard sealed the match with a whipped crosscourt forehand, his 29th winner, in just over an hour.In the other quarter-final match, Stefanos Tsitsipas , the world number 12, fell victim to an extraordinary run by Italian qualifier Mattia Bellucci , who secured a 6-4, 6-2 upset victory.Bellucci's left-handed serve and combination of flat backhands and heavy topspin forehands, coupled with well-disguised drop shots, proved too much for Tsitsipas to handle.With his sights set on the trophy, Alcaraz remains confident in his ability to continue improving with each match, setting the stage for an enthralling semi-final clash against Hurkacz.","Carlos Alcaraz beat compatriot Pedro Martinez 6-2, 6-1 in Rotterdam Open quarter-final.

NEW DELHI: Manchester United 's FA Cup defence remained alive as they staged a remarkable comeback to defeat Leicester City 2-1 on Friday night at Old Trafford.The match witnessed a fairytale return for former United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy , who was in the opposition dugout as Leicester's interim manager.The first half was a frustrating affair for the home side, as they struggled to create meaningful chances.Leicester took the lead in the 42nd minute through Bobby De Cordova-Reid, who nodded home from close range after Wilfred Ndidi 's initial effort was saved by Andre Onana.United's manager, Ruben Amorim , recognised the need for a change and introduced Alejandro Garnacho at halftime, a move that proved to be a game-changer. The young Argentine winger injected pace and directness into United's attack, causing problems for the Leicester defence.The equaliser arrived midway through the second half when fellow substitute Joshua Zirkzee tapped in from close range after Rasmus Hojlund's flick from Garnacho's cross was blocked.With the momentum firmly in their favour, United pushed for a winner, and it came deep into stoppage time. Harry Maguire rose highest to head home a Bruno Fernandes free-kick, sparking wild celebrations at Old Trafford.While the goal appeared to be offside, the lack of VAR in the FA Cup meant the decision stood, and United secured a hard-fought victory.The match held added significance for Ruud van Nistelrooy, who had enjoyed a brief spell as United's interim manager earlier in the season following the sacking of Erik ten Hag.During his tenure, United had scored eight goals in two games against Leicester, but this time, the Dutchman was on the receiving end of a United comeback.For United, the win provided a much-needed boost after a recent run of poor form at home, where they had suffered five defeats in their previous seven matches across all competitions.The absence of key players like Lisandro Martinez, who sustained a cruciate ligament injury against Crystal Palace, and the January departures of Marcus Rashford and Antony, had left United light in attacking options.However, the introduction of Garnacho and Zirkzee's impact highlighted the depth in United's squad.As the FA Cup defence continues, United will take confidence from their ability to grind out a result against a determined Leicester side. The comeback victory not only kept their hopes of silverware alive but also provided a timely reminder of the resilience and fighting spirit that has been a hallmark of successful United teams throughout their illustrious history.","Manchester United staged a remarkable comeback to defeat Leicester City 2-1 on Friday night at Old Trafford.

'Peaking at the right time': Tony de Zorzi as Sunrisers storm into third consecutive SA20 final

NEW DELHI: South African cricket legend and league ambassador Allan Donald believes MI Cape Town are the favourites to lift the SA20 trophy but warns that two-time defending champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape have peaked at the perfect time to challenge them in Saturday’s final at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg.""You'd have to say going on pure and utter form that MI Cape Town would probably pip as the favourites to take the trophy,"" Donald said in reply to the query fromduring an online interaction. ""But, but and this is a big but, the boys from the Eastern Cape, they have just come charging at the very, very right time. They just look like a team now that has just found utter belief. It's got the making of an unbelievable final.""Sunrisers Eastern Cape stormed into their third successive SA20 final with a commanding eight-wicket victory over Paarl Royals . Having already won two consecutive titles, they are now eyeing an unprecedented hat-trick. Despite MI Cape Town’s dominant run, Donald believes Sunrisers' experience in high-pressure situations makes them a formidable opponent.""You know, you can almost see it. It's going to go down to the bare minimum,"" he said. ""The absolute clinical manner that MI Cape Town have gone about their cricket is just... you'd have to say they deserve to be up there as finalists and maybe they are favourites to win it. But yeah, I think the boys in orange [Sunrisers] will have something else to say.""Donald credited Sunrisers coach Adrian Birrell for his ability to prepare the team mentally for big games. ""I don't think Sunrisers fear it [playing MI Cape Town in the final] at all. They've played in two finals before, had difficult moments, and dealt with them. Adrian Birrell is a bit of a mentalist - he works very, very cleverly with the mind. He knows there's so much skill in that change room, and it's just a matter of fine-tuning it and keeping people calm.""He added that MI Cape Town will feel the pressure of being labeled favourites. ""The only thing that can stop Sunrisers is a dodgy wicket, which I don't think will be the case. I think Wanderers will be a great pitch - pace and bounce. As much as I've said that MI Cape Town are the favourites, the pressure will be all on them because this team in orange will not see it that way. They will come out swinging. The last two wins for them have been so clinical, and they finished those teams in every aspect of T20 pressures. They stood up top. So I just think they're a machine that's going to be hard to stop. I think the boys in blue [MI Cape Town] will have to play out of their boots.""Donald also highlighted standout young South African players from the tournament, naming Rubin Hermann, Lhuan-dre Pretorius, and Jordan Hermann as promising talents. ""Rubin Hermann has done superbly for Paarl Royals, and his brother Jordan flourished when elevated in the batting order. Bjorn Fortuin , the left-arm spinner, has been an unsung hero for Paarl Royals, delivering crucial performances in tough overs.""With both teams in prime form, the SA20 final promises an intense battle between MI Cape Town’s consistency and Sunrisers Eastern Cape’s championship pedigree.",South African cricket legend Allan Donald believes MI Cape Town are the favourites to lift the SA20 trophy.

Thombare-Hartono back in doubles final

MUMBAI: Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi came into the L&T Mumbai Open unranked. Check the live WTA rankings now and you will see the promising 15-year-old’s name in 645th spot after she marched into the semifinals of the WTA 125K tournament at the Cricket Club of India here on Friday.Taking on the 285th-ranked Japanese qualifier Mei Yamaguchi in the quarterfinals, Maaya, not for the first time this week, showed why she is regarded as one of India’s bright, young tennis hopes, as she overcame a second-set wobble to win 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 in just under two hours.To put her victory in context, she is the first Indian female to get this far in a WTA tournament at home in singles since Sania Mirza won a Tour event in her home city of Hyderabad in 2005 — over four years before Maaya was born. And to think that she hadn’t actually planned to play in Mumbai to begin with!Having received a wild card to the qualifiers here, Maaya, who recently joined the Rafa Nadal Academy in Mallorca, hasn’t looked back. From earning six ranking points by virtue of winning her two qualifying matches, the Coimbatore teenager has gone on to amass an additional 49 points as a result of her now reaching the semifinals.“It means a lot,” she said, reserving a word of thanks for tournament director Sunder Iyer. “MSLTA and Sunder sir, they gave me this opportunity. I’m really grateful for that, and it all started from there. As I said, wasn’t part of the plan, but they trusted me and gave me an opportunity, and here it is now.”Indeed. Though when she double-faulted to hand Yamaguchi the second set in a game where she was 40-15 up, the outcome of the match was very much in the balance. But Maaya felt she was prepared after coming through both qualifying matches in three sets.“It’s the third third-set victory this week, and all three of them, I took the first and lost the second. So this is not something new for me,” she said, confidently stating that she didn’t feel the need to recalibrate. “The moment I lost the second set, I knew I had to go all out in the third. And whenever I do that, if I get my legs going, I’ll be winning the third set.”While the 25-year-old Japanese began the match stronger of the two, she would suddenly lose rhythm on her serve, allowing Maaya to claw her way back from a 1-3 deficit and clinch the opening set.The second set saw Yamaguchi, playing with a tightly-strapped right thigh, rediscover the sting in her forehand as well as raise her first serve percentage which helped her put pressure on the young Indian. Just as Maaya had done in the opening set, Yamaguchi would break the Indian’s serve for three consecutive games to even the match.But her challenge fizzled in the deciding set, as an exquisite crosscourt backhand winner followed by a crushing forehand return gave Maaya the double break.On Saturday, the fifth seed Jil Teichmann of Switzerland awaits the teenager in the semifinals. Teichmann had extinguished any hope of seeing an all-Indian last four battle when she outclassed Shrivalli Bhamidipaty 6-2, 6-2 earlier in the day.“It’s a very tough match, but it should be the toughest match of the week for me. And she’s a lefty too. I just hope to compete well, no pressure on me,” said Maaya.India’s top-ranked woman doubles player Prarthana Thombare and Dutch partner Arianne Hartono earned themselves another crack at the title here, as they fought back to beat the British-Russian pairing of Eden Silva and Anastasia Tikhonova 2-6, 6-4, 10-2 in the semifinal on Friday. Thombare and Hartono finished runners-up last year, losing to Dalila Jakupovic and Sabrina Santamaria in the final.","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi beats Japanese qualifier Mei Yamaguchi 6-4, 3-6, 6-2. She is the first Indian female to get this far in a WTA tournament at home in singles since Sania Mirza won a Tour event in her home city of Hyderabad in 2005.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118047963,imgsize-24894,width-400,resizemode-4/118047963.jpg"

Today I think I played even better, technically speaking, against a great opponent but I was in a mindset to fight for every point,"" said the Italian.Bellucci, ranked 92nd globally, had previously showcased his abilities by eliminating second seed Daniil Medvedev in the earlier round.The Italian demonstrated strong defensive skills in the first set, catching Tsitsipas off guard with well-executed drop shots.After breaking Tsitsipas at 4-4, Bellucci successfully served out the set, saving a break point before securing it when his opponent hit a backhand long.The sixth-seeded Greek's difficulties persisted in the second set, with Bellucci breaking serve and establishing a 3-1 lead through skillful drop shots.Tsitsipas contributed to his own defeat by double-faulting on break point, giving up a second break of serve.He managed to save a match point at 5-1, similar to his previous match against Tallon Griekspoor, but couldn't complete another comeback.Bellucci closed out the match confidently, serving to love and earning appreciation from the crowd.His semi-final opponent will be Australia's Alex de Minaur, last year's finalist, who defeated German lucky loser Daniel Altmaier 6-1, 6-4.The tournament's other matches feature world number three Carlos Alcaraz facing fellow Spaniard Pedro Martinez, while Russia's Andrey Rublev competes against Poland's Hubert Hurkacz.","Mattia Bellucci defeats Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-4, 6-2 to reach Rotterdam Open semi-finals.

MUMBAI: It didn't seem like Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi had done much wrong. She had just completed a 6-4, 6-1 over Belarusian Iryna Shymanovich, finishing the match exactly how she had started it, with an ace. It was not just her first round match of the L&T Mumbai Open , this was her WTA main draw debut, and for most part, the 15-year-old looked to have ticked a lot of the right boxes judging by the applause she drew from the Cricket Club of India crowd here on Tuesday.And yet, the promising teenager wasn't totally pleased with her performance while reflecting on it later. “Well, one thing is that I think I played my qualifying rounds better than today. So one thing that I'm happy about is that I managed to win even though I didn't play my best today,” Maaya would say.Winning despite not being at your best! That's a trait that the man whose famous academy Maaya currently trains at often fell back on over the course of his storied career. For now, she is still in the early days of her one-year stint at the Rafa Nadal Academy in Mallorca, and apart from saying “it's going good” and mentioning a “small conversation” she had with Toni, Rafa's uncle and long-time coach, there's not much else Maaya can share just yet.Her racket, however, did the talking against the 225th-ranked Shymanovich, who, Maaya happened to learn would be her opponent “just five minutes” before she was to step on court.As she and Shymanovich were hitting to each other in the warm-up, a livescoring app still showed Yuriko Miyazaki of Great Britain as Maaya's opponent. Miyazaki was forced to withdraw due to illness.Did the late twist throw Maaya off in any way? “Nah, because either way, I didn't know anything about my previous opponent. The same applies to this (player),” the Coimbatore girl grinned.There was notable support for Maaya in the crowd as Grand Slam doubles champion Rohan Bopanna followed the youngster's progress over the first set. “I'm really honoured to have him here because I think he flew down to watch this match and I'm really happy that he was here,” she said.Tuesday's win coupled with her two victories in the qualifiers have earned Maaya 21 WTA ranking points, taking her total points tally to 24 and earning her an entry into the WTA rankings.She will take on Zarina Diyas in the second round, after the Kazakh eliminated defending champion Darja Semenistaja 6-3, 6-3.Meanwhile, Ankita Raina and Shrivalli Bhamidipaty were the other Indian players to advance to the last 16 stage on Tuesday. Raina proved too strong for compatriot Vaishnavi Adkar, coming through 6-2, 6-2, while Bhamidipaty produced a devastating display to take out the 182nd-ranked Elena Pridankina of Russia 6-1, 6-0 in just 64 minutes.","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi beat Belarusian Iryna Shymanovich 6-4, 6-1.

Indian tennis star Sumit Nagal reaches pre-quarterfinals at Rosario Challenger,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/indian-tennis-star-sumit-nagal-reaches-pre-quarterfinals-at-rosario-challenger/articleshow/117908818.cms,"(@nagalsumit Photo on X)

NEW DELHI: Indian tennis player Sumit Nagal secured his place in the pre-quarterfinals following a resilient victory against Argentina's Renzo Olivo in a notable advancement at the 2025 Rosario Challenger .The match concluded with scores of 5-7, 6-1, 6-0 in favour of Nagal, who is the eighth seed in the tournament. This victory marks a significant achievement for the 27-year-old Indian, displaying his ability to recover and dominate after an initial setback.Nagal's next opponent will be determined by the outcome of the match between Tseng Chun-hsin from Chinese Taipei and Bolivia's Hugo Dellien .This triumph comes at a crucial time for Nagal, who recently experienced a decline in his professional standing.Prior to this event, he had fallen out of the ATP top-100 rankings, a position he had maintained for 10 consecutive months since March 2024.This drop was attributed to a series of disappointing performances, with Nagal securing only three main draw victories in 18 tournaments since Wimbledon 2024.Despite this, his earlier entry into the top-100 in February 2024, following a commendable performance at a Grand Slam event, underscores his potential and skill on the international stage.In related developments within Indian tennis, veteran doubles player Rohan Bopanna , aged 44, has also experienced a setback, falling five places to No. 21 in the rankings.This decline followed an early exit from the Australian Open, where he was unable to defend the points from his previous championship win.Bopanna's attempt to retain his standing, alongside new partner Nicolas Barrientos, ended prematurely in the opening round of the competition.Other Indian players, including Sasikumar Mukund, Ramkumar Ramanathan, Karan Singh, and Aryan Shah, maintain their positions within the top-600 in singles rankings.In doubles, alongside Bopanna, players such as Yuki Bhambri, N Sriram Balaji, Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli, and Arjun Kadhe are within the top-100.","Indian tennis player Sumit Nagal secured his place in the pre-quarterfinals following a resilient victory against Argentina's Renzo Olivo.

"Handed wildcards, Indians have a point to prove",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/handed-wildcards-indians-have-a-point-to-prove/articleshow/117891061.cms,"Ramkumar Ramanathan

CHENNAI: Indian tennis is not going through the best of times. While its top-ranked singles player Sumit Nagal has made good strides in recent years, the rest of the crop has struggled in the journey to the top.The player distribution in the Chennai Open Challenger best explains the current scenario. Even in a home tournament, India, in the absence of Nagal, is forced to rely on wildcards for main-draw singles entries as the next-best players from the country find it difficult to directly make the cut. Davis Cuppers Mukund Sasikumar (ranked 365), Ramkumar Ramanathan (406) and Karan Singh will have a point to prove after being awarded wildcards by the organisers.The onus will be on the experienced Ramkumar and Mukund to gain valuable points to move up in the rankings chart. The 28-year-old Mukund had a good run in Chennai last year, reaching the quarterfinals, but could not carry forward the momentum in the tournaments that followed. Ramkumar’s story in the past few years has not been much different, with the 30-year-old’s inconsistency hampering his chances to move to a higher level. Youngster Karan has shown promise in the early stages of his career and is steadily rising up the ladder.Moving to foreign interest, quite a few players are looking to resurrect their careers and compete in the Grand Slams. For instance, Lloyd Harris, who is the second seed in singles, was once ranked as high as 31 and reached the quarterfinals of the US Open in 2021. Injury issues forced the South African to stay away from action for quite a long period and the 27-year-old will compete in his first match since the Wimbledon last year.Former world No. 35 Jiri Vesely had to sit out in 2023 due to injury concerns. The 31-year-old had won the ATP 250 title in Pune in 2020 and had a good time in India in the past. Ahead of the Chennai Open, Vesely said: “Preparations have been good and I am getting used to the weather, but it is not easy. It is always nice to be in India and people are very friendly and supportive. I love coming back here and I hope to have a good run on this trip.”Vesely dropped outside the top-600 a few years ago and since then, he has found it tough to be back to his best. “I wish to move up and it is not easy. A lot of youngsters are playing well and I need to compete with them and give my best.”","India's top-ranked singles player Sumit Nagal has made good strides in recent years.

Jacopo Berrettini looks up to brother Matteo to climb the ladder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/jacopo-berrettini-looks-up-to-brother-matteo-to-climb-the-ladder/articleshow/117890986.cms,"Jacopo Berrettini

CHENNAI: Italian tennis player Jacopo Berrettini does not have to look far for inspiration. The 26-year-old shares a strong bond with his elder brother Matteo Berrettini , a former top-10 singles player and 2021 Wimbledon finalist, whom he regards not only his best friend but also his idol.“I have a good relationship with him. He is a very good human, and I am so glad and lucky to have him. Apart from on-court training, he mentors me off the field and is a good coach. We shared the same (coaching) team for the past three years and now share the same trainer. Before coming here, we trained together for three days in Rome,” Jacopo, who will begin his season at the Chennai Open Challenger , told TOI on Saturday.Jacopo and Matteo had a tough 2023 as their seasons were marred by injuries. Matteo had to take a six-month break, while Jacopo had to miss the majority of the year. In that period, the Berrettini brothers helped each other stay mentally strong. “It was a very tough period for us, for our family. We were trying to be the humans that we are, trying to stay mentally focused and healthy. We had to work a lot after recovery because this sport is so tough mentally and physically. We were trying to enjoy life outside the sport as it is very important as well. After suffering from a lot of injuries, Matteo had a good season last year,” Jacopo added.While Jacopo and Matteo do not spend much time together due to their playing commitments, they are always in touch. “We try to talk often and as much as we can. Sometimes, we train together, but if we are not able to spend a lot of time, it is okay since we travel and play regularly. We are healthy and that is a good thing for us.”‘Aim to carry forward momentum’: Jacopo had a productive season last year and achieved his career-best singles ranking of 317. The Italian will look to carry forward the momentum, starting with his season opener in Chennai. “It was a good year (2024) for me, playing many matches without any injury concerns. I worked on many aspects and will try to keep going. My goal for this year is to compete in the qualifiers of the Grand Slams, for which I have to get close to the 230 mark (rankings).”",Italian tennis player Jacopo Berrettini shares a strong bond with his elder brother Matteo.

Davis Cup: India return to Group 1 with 4-0 win over Togo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/davis-cup-india-return-to-group-1-with-4-0-win-over-togo/articleshow/117873861.cms,"NEW DELHI: India returned to the Davis Cup World Group 1 with a comprehensive 4-0 win over Togo in the Playoff here at the DLTA complex on Sunday. The hosts, who had taken a commanding 2-0 lead by winning the first two singles on the opening day of the tie on Saturday, completed the formality with two dominant wins - in doubles and singles - on Sunday. The fifth rubber was not played. The World Group 1 tie would be played in September later this year and the name of their opponents would be announced later.The doubles pair of Sriram Balaji and Davis Cup debutant Rithvik Bollipalli put the hosts ahead in the fourth game when they broke M'lapa Akomlo, the substitute for regular player Thomas Setodji who pulled out with an injury. Akomlo proved to be the weak link as the Indians, playing some smart tennis with clever ball placement and strong net presence, broke his service to take the set 6-2. The second set was even shorter as the Indians broke Akomlo and his partner Isak Padio once each to claim the set 6-1. The match lasted 57 minutes.With the tie secured, India gave rookie Karan Singh his Davis Cup debut in the dead rubber and the 21-year-old did not disappoint as he beat Isak, whom Togo fielded in place of original choice Setodji. The 20-year-old in fact put up the best show by a Togolese player on the trip as he stretched most of the games. He even managed to break Singh once in the second set as India won the match 6-2, 6-3 - the first instance when Togo won three games in a set on this tour.""I started playing tennis when I was an 11-year-old and I had no idea how far I would go. I just kept going day by day. And here we are today. And I really enjoyed playing the match today. All the teammates were really cheering me,"" Karan later said.The other Davis Cup debutant Bollipalli shared his thoughts: ""Playing in Davis Cup is a different feeling. It's a little bit different from the regular matches that we play.""'Grooming future captain'Interestingly, once India won the doubles match and the Playoff, regular captain Rohit Rajpal took a backseat and allowed Mukund Sasikumar occupy the captain's chair during the fourth rubber, played by Karan Singh. The captain's chairs are placed next to the chair umpire so that the players could consult with the captains during game breaks. ""I always do that. Sometimes it's as important as grooming players. Sitting on that chair has a different kind of pressure you need that experience. It's good for them. They'll be the future captains. We'll come and go as seniors, but these guys are here to stay,"" Rajpal said.","India return to the Davis Cup World Group 1 with a comprehensive 4-0 win over Togo in the Playoff.

Elise Mertens secured her first WTA title in 17 months on Sunday, defeating unseeded Ann Li in straight sets to claim the Singapore Tennis Open.The second-seeded Belgian, who had fallen to McCartney Kessler in the Hobart International final last month, showcased her dominance at the Kallang Tennis Centre , winning 75 percent of her first-serve points to overpower the American 6-1, 6-4.Li had not dropped a set en route to the final but struggled with her serve early on, allowing Mertens to capitalize with three service breaks to wrap up the opening set in just 26 minutes.The American was broken again at the start of the second set but responded by breaking Mertens for the first time in the following game, settling into a better rhythm on serve.However, serving to stay in the match at 4-5, Li committed a pair of unforced errors, handing Mertens the victory after one hour and 22 minutes. The win marked Mertens' ninth career WTA singles title and her first since triumphing at the Monastir Open in Tunisia in October 2023.In the doubles final, second seeds Desirae Krawczyk of the United States and Giuliana Olmos of Mexico clinched the title with a commanding 7-5, 6-0 victory over the third-seeded Chinese duo of Wang Xinyu and Zheng Saisai.","Elise Mertens defeated Ann Li 6-1, 6-4 to win the Singapore Tennis Open.

NEW DELHI: N Sriram Balaji and Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli secured India's place in the Davis Cup World Group I with a commanding straight-set victory , handing the hosts an unassailable 3-0 lead against Togo in the play-off tie on Sunday.With a 2-0 advantage, India needed to win just one of the three matches, and the duo of Balaji and Bollipalli accomplished the task in the opening contest against M'lapa Tingou Akomolo and Hod'abalo Isak Padio, winning 6-2, 6-1 in just 57 minutes at the DLTA Complex .Togo replaced their top player, Thomas Setodji, with M'lapa Tingou Akomolo due to an arm injury, which proved detrimental as Akomolo struggled to hold serve throughout the match. Balaji's serving was exceptional, losing only one point on his serve during the entire contest.The Indians gained their first break when Akomolo served in the third game, and from there, it was a one-sided affair. Bollipalli, making his debut, overcame initial nerves and settled into the match, contributing significantly to the victory.The pair's experience of winning a Challenger together last year proved advantageous, as they displayed a straightforward and efficient performance. India is likely to give young Karan Singh a debut in the dead rubber match.Balaji and Bollipalli's convincing straight-set victory sealed India's place in the Davis Cup World Group I, showcasing their dominance and leaving Togo with little chance for a comeback.","N Sriram Balaji and Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli secured India's place in the Davis Cup World Group I with a commanding straight-set victory.
