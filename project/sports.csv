Just before tipoff of the 2025 NBA Finals between the Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder, a moment of spontaneous hilarity unfolded on live television. It is no secret that Inside the NBA is moving to ESPN from TNT. During a crossover segment between ESPN and TNT, ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith brought his signature energy to the set of Inside the NBA, resulting in a playful clash with Shaquille O’Neal and Kenny Smith.In what fans are calling one of the funniest moments of the Finals pregame coverage, Stephen A. Smith walked onto the Inside the NBA set unannounced, getting in the faces of Shaquille O’Neal and Kenny Smith. Smith wasted no time pushing boundaries—literally—by touching Shaq’s head, prompting an exaggerated but hilarious reaction from the NBA legend.“Get your hands off me, Stephen A. Smith,” said O’Neal, dressed in a brown suit, holding the mic in mock protest. The set erupted in laughter, with Kenny Smith jumping in, echoing, “Back up off my guy, man!”Despite the apparent theatrics, the chemistry between the analysts was clear. As the show continued, Stephen A. kept up his antics, interacting with the panel and playfully testing the boundaries of live television decorum.At one point, O’Neal quipped, “Bring me some hot chocolate so I can spill it on your Blazer,” poking fun at Stephen A.’s choice of outfit while keeping the mood light and jovial.The crew’s animated reactions and laughter showed there were no hard feelings, only friendly rivalry and entertainment gold.As the iconic Inside the NBA prepares to leave its longtime home at TNT, fans have been understandably anxious about how the beloved show will transition to ESPN in the 2025-26 season. Fortunately, recent updates suggest the core of the show will remain untouched, especially its freewheeling postgame format.According to Front Office Sports, ESPN plans to give Inside the NBA the same “extensive” postgame airtime that viewers have come to expect. That means fans can still count on Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, Charles Barkley, and Shaquille O’Neal delivering their signature mix of analysis, comedy, and chaos without being squeezed by strict runtime limitations.“There will be an extensive post-game show, say sources. ESPN’s goal is to let the post-game segment run as long as it does now on TNT,” the report noted.Still, not everyone on the crew is at ease. Kenny Smith shared his lingering concerns in a recent interview with The New Yorker, focusing on the lack of control the crew had in negotiating the move.“We have the same crew of people doing the show,” Smith said. “But the timing: Are we a half hour now? Are we forty-five minutes? Fifteen minutes?”Also Read: ""NBA stars will be forever stained"": Stephen A.

Cam Skattebo's viral moment provokes criticism over NFL history blind spot



Does Cam Skattebo know ball? 🧠

A generation gap or something more?







New York Giants first-year running back Cameron Skattebo became the focus of an unintended NFL tempest—nothing on the field, but for seemingly not knowing anything about the league's greatest legends. In one recent video making its rounds on the internet, Cameron Skattebo can't recognize NFL legends from their pictures, kicking off an emotional Reddit discussion in which fans toggle between anger and empathy.Cameron Skattebo, who played college football at Sacramento State Hornets and Arizona State Sun Devils before the New York Giants drafted him in the fourth round of the 2025 NFL Draft, soon found himself a topic of conversation on Reddit—but not the kind related to his athleticism.In one clip of him now circulating, Cameron Skattebo misidentifies players during a quiz segment. When presented with a picture of Calvin Johnson, better known as ‘Megatron,’ confusion set in.Redditors were both amused and frustrated. One of the top comments stated, “Not knowing Calvin is wild, but an NFL player not knowing Brett Favre is crazy ffs.”Another commenter joked, “Banish him from the league for this,” and others reluctantly empathized, one of them noting, “To be fair, though, Calvin retired when Skattebo woulda been like 13 or 14, and he wasn’t a guy who was in many commercials or broadcast booths.So it’s not thaaaat crazy with all that in mind.”""They’re so disappointed they’re almost speechless by the end lol. The joy fully sucked out of the room,"" another user said.The discussion soon escalated beyond Skattebo, with wider questions about how younger players identify with the history of the league. One commenter wrote that most players don't grow up watching the NFL but rather center on their own development or college careers. “A lot of these guys don't even follow the NFL til they get to the league. Might have been a college fan, or just doesn't watch football,” another Redditor wrote.Even fans conceded trouble identifying helmet-wearing players by face alone. “Not really. I wouldn’t recognize Joe Montana from face alone probably. I definitely wouldn’t recognize megatron from face alone. I think people here are forgetting these dudes play in helmets lol. Outside of a handful of players there’s probably not many non-Eagles I could recognize,” admitted one commenter.Nevertheless, the overall opinion was tilted towards incredulity, particularly in light of Johnson's place in NFL legend.Also read: ‘I still have more to prove’: Giants rookie Cam Skattebo’s giant ambitions While the NFL fan base in turn roasted and justified Cameron Skattebo's viral blunder, the moment highlighted something greater—the transience of fame, the changing tides of fandom across generations, and the way legacy players disappear from popular consciousness sooner than we want them to. Cameron Skattebo learned this lesson not offered in college: understanding the past can inform how you're perceived in the present.","New York Giants running back Cameron Skattebo can't recognize NFL legends from pictures.

Allen Iverson shares posts dedicated to son Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson and wife Tawanna Turner





Former NBA legend, Allen Iverson shares a heartwarming post for his son, Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson on his Instagram. The post contains photos from Isaiah’s childhood, teenage years, and graduation ceremony. Allen went on to praise him saying that he’s the true definition of what a son should be, and the way he always looks out for family is what makes him better than others. He goes on to say how proud of a father he is. However, this post came days after Allen dedicated an entire post for ex-wife, Tawanna Turner.Allen Iverson talks profoundly about his son Isaiah on his recent Instagram post. He talks about Isaiah’s qualities and how he is a son that every father will be proud of.“The true definition of a son,” says Allen as he starts the post, showing how proud he is of Isaiah.Iverson further went on to say how Isaiah takes care of his mother and siblings, and never disrespects his parents. He also went on to say that Isaiah always puts family first and takes responsibility heads on. From his post it seems after Allen and Tawanna separated, it was Isaiah who put on the ""head of the family"" tag and took good care of the family.However, this post comes days after Allen dedicated an entire post to ex-wife Tawanna Turner, with whom he shares five children, Allen Iverson II, Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson, Dream Alijha, Tiaura, and Messiah Lauren. The post had a montage of the couple’s photos from prom, early court days, and as such. Allen captioned the photo as “HER” followed by heart and crossed fingers emoticons.Allen and Tawanna tied the knot in 2001, and had a happy marriage for quite some years. However, trouble entered their married life in the form of lavish expenditures, Iverson’s questionable parenting skills, and alcohol habits. In 2013, when Iverson retired from the world of NBA, his married life also came to an end. The couple called it quits in 2013 and agreed to co-parenting their kids.However, it seems Allen’s life turned upside down soon after his lady luck left. After retirement, Allen spent all of his fortune on expensive cars, and lavish lifestyle. Due to this, he became bankrupt by 2015.Allen was at his top during his time with the Philadelphia 76ers, when he won the MVP of the year in 2001. He also went on to win the Rookie of the Year award in 1997. It was during this time that Iverson was the peak of his career, after which his life took a complete 180-degree turn.However, things have started taking turn for Iverson as he recently signed a deal with Reebok and agreed to be the Vice President of basketball division for the brand. He had earlier made a lifetime deal with Reebok back in 2001, which brought him $800,000 per year. The contract also had a clause that stated Iverson will get an additional $32 million at the age of 55. Will the new role help Iverson turn the course of events or will he fall back into old habits? It remains to be seen.Also Read: Carmelo Anthony spilled beans on weirdest reason why Larry Brown suspended LeBron James, Allen Iverson, and Amar’e Stoudemire just before Olympics","NBA legend Allen Iverson shares heartfelt post on his son days after making sweet gesture towards ex-wife.

The sports media world lit up this week after a war of words ignited between two of its biggest voices—Pablo Torre and Bill Simmons. At the center of the controversy? Torre’s extensive coverage of former Patriots coach Bill Belichick’s relationship with 24-year-old Jordon Hudson—a saga that continues to stir public fascination and criticism alike.Pablo Torre, host of Pablo Torre Finds Out, has gone all in on the story, offering detailed reports that include allegations of Jordon Hudson being banned from UNC’s football facilities, which the university denied, and even securing an Airbnb once used by the couple. “Dear @BillSimmons: Since you have such a strong public opinion about my work… I happen to have a few questions for you,” Torre tweeted, adding, “Unless you’re afraid of @pablofindsout and someone just ‘pretending to be a journalist,’ of course. ”Bill Simmons, founder of The Ringer, took a sharp jab at Torre during a recent episode of his “Rewatchables” podcast. “I’ve never seen anybody dine on a stupider story for a week and a half while pretending you’re a journalist. What the f–k was that? Seriously. ‘Belichick’s dating a girl. Oh, let me do nine shows about it. Settle the f–k down,’” Simmons scoffed. While he later admitted the topic was publicly relevant, he suggested Torre was milking it: “Maybe do two shows about it.The irony? The two are reportedly set to appear together on an upcoming podcast—an episode that may bring more sparks than insights.Torre’s reporting hasn’t been casual. He has pursued public records, explored legal options for transparency, and unpacked the impact of the Belichick-Hudson drama on UNC's football program, where Belichick currently works in an advisory role. Meanwhile, critics debate whether this is journalism at its boldest or a tabloid-style obsession wrapped in podcast branding.With the June 1 date—marking Belichick’s drop in buyout—from $10 million to $1 million now passed, speculation around his future continues to mount. So does curiosity over what Torre might release next.Also Read: Hollywood bribe?

Brad Marchand hints this could be his last Stanley Cup Final appearance







As the Florida Panthers battle the Edmonton Oilers in the 2025 Stanley Cup Final, whispers about Brad Marchand’s NHL future are growing louder—and more expensive. After a standout playoff run that reignited his reputation, the 36-year-old veteran is reportedly attracting major interest across the league, with teams like the Toronto Maple Leafs and Edmonton Oilers emerging as potential suitors.Brad Marchand, once the heart of the Boston Bruins, reinvented himself this season with the Panthers after a surprising late-career move. The gritty winger seamlessly fit into Florida’s hard-hitting system, helping the team surge through the playoffs. He played a pivotal role in narrowing Toronto’s series lead with a dramatic overtime goal in Game 3—his fifth game-winning postseason goal against the Leafs.But despite his impact, Marchand’s time in Florida may be short-lived.According to NHL insider Chris Johnston, “Brad Marchand will have plenty of teams interested, some willing to offer $8M per.” The Panthers, he added, are “unlikely to be able to keep him.” That quote has stirred intense speculation that the Leafs or Oilers could go “all in” on Marchand when free agency opens on July 1.TSN’s Bryan Hayes and Jeff O’Neil even endorsed the idea during a recent discussion. “100%-110%. I confirm it,” Hayes declared.O’Neil added, “Yes, I confirm it. Why not?”—a dramatic shift in tone for fans who once viewed Marchand as Toronto’s biggest playoff nemesis.Amid the rumors, Marchand himself has been reflective. Speaking to NHL.com’s Amalie Benjamin, he acknowledged, “Statistically, it’ll most likely be my last one. Hopefully it’s not, but that’s just how this game works.” He echoed that sentiment with Elliotte Friedman, saying, “I’ve thought about... potential situations. But till you really know what options are like, it’s all theoretical.”Still, Marchand is focused on the present. “I kind of parked all that, and I’m just especially right now just being in the moment and enjoying it,” he said. Wherever he lands next, one thing is clear: Marchand isn’t done making waves.Also Read: “Harshest critics”: Wayne Gretzky's daughter Paulina Gretzky on overcoming criticism and learning to love herself unapologetically","Brad Marchand is reportedly attracting interest from multiple teams, including big spenders.

Jonathan Marchessault’s track record could make him a worthwhile gamble





As the Toronto Maple Leafs confront yet another disappointing early playoff exit, the offseason has quickly become one of the most pivotal in recent franchise memory. With major changes looming and star winger Mitch Marner widely expected to test free agency, Toronto’s front office is reportedly weighing aggressive options — including a potential trade for Nashville Predators veteran Jonathan Marchessault.According to Lyle Richardson of Bleacher Report, Jonathan Marchessault is viewed as a potential target for the Leafs as they search for ways to replace Marner’s elite offensive output. The longtime NHL forward, known for his playoff poise and scoring touch, could be a short-term solution for a team desperate to end its 58-year Stanley Cup drought.“Marchessault's contract could be worrisome,” Richardson wrote, “but the Leafs are in ‘win now’ mode and desperate to end their 58-year Stanley Cup drought. Given his previous playoff success and postseason MVP credentials, they could take that risk if they can get him at a reduced salary.”Marchessault’s first season in Nashville didn’t live up to expectations. Despite appearing in 78 games, he tallied just 21 goals and 35 points — a noticeable dip from his past production. Still, his resume is hard to ignore: over his 12-year NHL career, he’s topped the 20-goal mark eight times and was instrumental in the Vegas Golden Knights’ 2023 Stanley Cup run, where he earned Conn Smythe honors as postseason MVP.Toronto may be hoping that a change of scenery and a strong supporting cast could help the 33-year-old rediscover his scoring groove.While the Maple Leafs would love to add a player of Marchessault’s caliber, pulling off a deal with Nashville may not be simple. Toronto lacks a deep pool of draft picks and top-tier prospects, which could complicate negotiations. However, if the Predators are eager to offload Marchessault’s contract, a reduced-price deal may become more realistic.Also Read: 2025 Stanley Cup anthem drama: Oilers stick with tradition as Panthers face backlash over botched performance For a team caught between contention and frustration, acquiring Marchessault could signal Toronto’s intent to double down on winning now — no matter the cost.",The Toronto Maple Leafs are reportedly considering a trade for Nashville Predators veteran Jonathan Marchessault.

Tommy Rees, offensive coordinator of the Cleveland Browns, is substantiating that all four of his quarterbacks get equal repetitions of drills or plays during practice. But Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk at NBC Sports thinks Kenny Pickett might be the odd man out of the quartet competition at the starting position. Why? Because Joe Flacco has the experience and the fan base. Shedeur Sanders and Dillon Gabriel might be the long-term solution to the Cleveland Browns quarterback problem!However, that’s not all. Tommy Rees is not sure. He says they are all pushing one another to put their best foot forward. Rees says by the time September rolls, they’ll be ready to go! With whom? Only time will tell. Three months to go. For now, Rees is concentrating on the present moment. Let’s hear what he has to say about the reps and quarterbacks.On June 5, Chris Easterling of Akron Beacon Journal reported that Joe Flacco and Kenny Pickett got early 11-on-11 reps in the first open OTA, but in the second OTA, Shedeur Sanders and Dillon Gabriel got their share of the reps as well. Talking about this, Tommy Rees explained further,“Rotation day by day has been kind of fluid. We’re going to continue to work with all the guys we have.We’re going to develop all four of them, and you know, we’re going to push the reps. We’re going to find ways to be creative to make sure that they all have opportunities to develop and put their best foot forward. And you know, when the time comes, we’ll continue to push guys forward as they are.”Tommy Rees diverts focus from the QB situation to other players and says this competition is a great way to maximize the potential of other players. Rees shared, “It’s a great way to maximize, look, it’s not just one position group that’s able to get maximized. You look at young wideouts, young linemen, young skill players across the board that we can get so many reps for now.Instead of them just getting the reps from the sideline or mental reps…now they’re actually out there learning on the fly, and things come up. You might run the same play on two different fields, get two different defenses, and now you have two opportunities to coach off of. So I really do think it benefits the entirety of the team.”Tommy Rees did not spill the beans on who will be the odd man out, but he said, “You can see them all winning the job, I think, right? And, so, in terms of the competition, we’re so early in the process. We’re so early in evaluating that. Yeah, I think, you know, we have a good group of guys that continue to push one another, and by the time September rolls around, we’ll be ready to go.”Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk thinks QB Kenny Pickett may be the odd one out who will end up being traded. On June 5, Florio wrote, “They will trim the competition to three before training camp opens, with one of the quartet being traded. We still think Pickett will be the odd man out, but that’s just a hunch.”Florio said Joe Flacco has the experience and the affection of the fan base. The other two 2025 NFL draftees, Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders, could become the long-term answer to solving the quarterback problem with the Cleveland Browns.","Tommy Rees, offensive coordinator of the Cleveland Browns, is substantiating that all four of his quarterbacks get equal repetitions of drills or plays during practice.

While talking to the podcast co-host April McDaniel, she said,“With the boys especially, it was really hard for me to find identity outside of being a mom. I felt like that is where my identity was supposed to be, so I just kind of put all of the eggs into that basket.”Kids grow up in a flash of time, and the worst part is that time cannot be turned back. As a parent, even Savannah James went through similar things when Bronny, Bryce, and Zhuri were growing up and further went on to take up different careers in life.

So I think that it’s mostly that, just knowing that the groundwork has been laid, and I feel good about the position that I’ve left them in. So I feel comfortable with seeing where my passions are able to take me.”LeBron James and Savannah James recently celebrated a new milestone in their second eldest son, Bryce Maximus’ life, who went on to complete his high school in Sierra Canyon.

The Kansas City Current, co-owned by Brittany Mahomes, has surged to a remarkable $275 million valuation — a staggering 266% increase — making it one of the most valuable teams in the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL). This explosive growth is a direct result of bold investments in infrastructure, talent, and fan engagement, placing the franchise at the heart of a new era in women’s sports.The club’s rise is fueled by its groundbreaking stadium project — the CPKC Stadium — which opened in March 2024 as the first purpose-built stadium exclusively for a women’s professional soccer team. The $120 million venue, entirely privately funded, has become a symbol of progress in the sports world. With a seating capacity of 11,500 and record-breaking sellouts, the stadium alone has significantly boosted the franchise’s brand value and fan base.Equally important is the $18 million training facility unveiled in 2022, which provides state-of-the-art amenities, sports science integration, and a professional-grade environment that rivals top men’s clubs. These strategic moves have not only enhanced player performance but also attracted top-tier athletes and coaching staff to Kansas City.Brittany Mahomes, a former soccer player herself, has played a pivotal role in shaping the Current’s vision since its rebirth in 2020. Her involvement, combined with the entry of husband and NFL star Patrick Mahomes as a co-owner in 2023, has amplified visibility and credibility. Patrick became the first active NFL player to own a stake in an NWSL franchise, further elevating the club’s national profile.The franchise’s growth mirrors the broader surge in women’s sports, with the NWSL experiencing record attendance and increasing media rights deals. In 2023 alone, league-wide viewership jumped over 400%, and the Current consistently outperformed the league average in both ticket sales and engagement.With recent successes like the 2024 NWSL x Liga MX Femenil Summer Cup title and a 2022 championship game appearance, Kansas City is not just building off the field — it’s winning on it too.Also read: Rashee Rice returns to practice with Chiefs after legal drama, joins Patrick Mahomes to refocus on 2025 NFL season The Kansas City Current’s meteoric valuation stands as a testament to what visionary ownership and focused investment can achieve.

Olympic gold medalist Imane Khelif's medical report reveals she's 'biologically male',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/olympic-gold-medalist-imane-khelifs-medical-report-reveals-shes-biologically-male/articleshow/121566346.cms,"Imane Khelif ’s medical report contradicts IOC’s official position

Controversy around the Imane Khelif’s gold medal at Paris Olympic



IOC calls findings misinformation



Response of World Boxing

Fairness and safety concerns from athletes and federations



Ongoing debate on gender and sport eligibility





A leaked medical report from the 2023 World Championships has revealed that Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelifis biologically male, according to chromosome analysis. The report, made public just days after World Boxing ordered Khelif to undergo sex testing for eligibility in future female competitions, shows she has a male XY karyotype. This revelation challenges the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) earlier dismissal of such tests and has intensified debate over fairness and safety in women’s boxing. The findings come amid ongoing controversy surrounding Khelif’s participation in women’s events, sparking calls for stricter verification procedures in sport.The report, published on the 3 Wire Sports website, states that Khelif’s chromosome analysis is “abnormal” and confirms a male karyotype. It was conducted by Dr Lal PathLabs in New Delhi, a lab accredited by the American College of Pathologists and certified by the International Organisation for Standardisation. This directly challenges the IOC’s spokesperson Mark Adams, who had described such test results as “ad hoc” and “not legitimate” during a press conference at the Paris Olympics.The controversy surrounding Imane Khelif ’s Olympic gold medal run began as early as her first bout in Paris, where she faced Italy’s Angela Carini.Carini, an experienced and respected boxer, was visibly shaken during the match. Overwhelmed by Khelif’s strength and intensity, she appeared distressed and left the ring in tears after the fight, later telling media she had feared for her safety. The unease only deepened in the final bout, where Khelif defeated Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting in a dominant display that many felt was physically one-sided. The power difference between the fighters drew sharp criticism, with commentators and athletes calling it “uncomfortable to watch” and likening it to watching a man beat a woman in the ring. The moment became one of the most controversial of the Paris Games, fuelling an international debate over fairness and inclusion in women’s sport.IOC president Thomas Bach dismissed the report as part of a Russian-led misinformation campaign, citing ethical and financial issues within the International Boxing Association (IBA), which conducted the tests. Despite these claims, the legitimacy of the Indian lab’s certification has increased pressure on the IOC to clarify its position and respond to questions about Khelif’s eligibility.Following the leak, World Boxing has declared that Khelif must pass mandatory chromosome testing before competing in any future female events. The 26-year-old Olympic champion, who was allowed to compete in Paris due to her female passport status, has so far not provided evidence to confirm female chromosomes. World Boxing now requires all athletes over 18 in its competitions to undergo PCR genetic testing to verify their sex, a measure introduced in response to this controversy.The case has raised serious safety and fairness concerns within the boxing community. Opponents like Italy’s Angela Carini and Mexico’s Brianda Tamara have spoken out about the physical challenges they faced competing against Khelif. Latin American federations have been particularly vocal, urging that women’s competitions be restricted to athletes assigned female at birth, in order to protect fairness and athlete safety.The Khelif controversy highlights the complex and sensitive issues surrounding transgender and intersex athletes in competitive sport. It underscores the need for clear, consistent policies that balance inclusivity with fairness and safety. As governing bodies reassess their rules, the case remains a key example of the challenges faced in maintaining the integrity of women’s sports.The ongoing debate around Imane Khelif’s case brings to light just how complex and emotionally charged the conversation about gender and eligibility in sport has become. At the heart of it are real athletes — women who train for years and step into the ring expecting fairness. Many feel blindsided and unheard when competing against opponents whose physical attributes raise legitimate concerns about safety and equality. This isn’t about exclusion, but about protecting hard-won opportunities for women in sport. Khelif’s story reminds us that governing bodies must act transparently, thoughtfully, and with empathy for all athletes involved.","Imane Khelif is biologically male, according to chromosome analysis.

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Yograj Singh launched a scathing attack on Punjab Kings captain Shreyas Iyer for his reckless dismissal in the IPL 2025 final, terming it a “criminal offence” that proved costly in the team’s narrow six-run defeat to Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB).In a high-voltage final at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Tuesday, RCB lifted their maiden IPL trophy after 18 seasons. However, Iyer’s early exit — caught behind for just 1 off 2 balls while attempting an ill-judged shot off Romario Shepherd — emerged as the turning point in Punjab’s failed chase of 191.Speaking to ANI, Yograj Singh didn’t mince words. “The shot which Shreyas Iyer played in the final was a criminal offence, according to me. Ashok Mankad told me about this criminal offence, which comes under Section 302. He also told me that the repercussions of this is that you will be banned for two matches. What Shreyas did yesterday is not acceptable. There is no apology for that.”Batting first, RCB posted 190/9, with contributions from Virat Kohli (43), Rajat Patidar (26), and Jitesh Sharma (24). PBKS responded strongly with Shashank Singh’s unbeaten 61 and Josh Inglis’ quickfire 39, but a disciplined bowling effort from Krunal Pandya (2/17) and others held them back at 184/7.Despite Shashank’s 22-run blitz in the final over, PBKS fell just short, with Iyer’s early departure drawing heavy scrutiny as RCB celebrated long-awaited glory.",Former India cricketer Yograj Singh slams Punjab Kings captain Shreyas Iyer for his reckless dismissal in the IPL 2025 final.

NEW DELHI: What was meant to be a day of pure joy and celebration turned into one of sorrow and heartbreak as a tragic stampede outside Bengaluru’s M. Chinnaswamy Stadium claimed 11 lives and injured 33 others on Wednesday.The incident occurred during Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s (RCB) much-anticipated victory parade, celebrating their historic first Indian Premier League (IPL) title after 18 long years.In the aftermath of the tragedy, cricketer Krunal Pandya shared an emotional note on social media.“Yesterday’s event was meant to share our joy with you and it has turned into a heartbreaking tragedy 💔 Sending out my condolences and prayers to the families that are grieving 🙏🏼,” he wrote on Instagram.His message echoed the sentiments of many players and fans who were left shaken by the horrifying turn of events.Inside the stadium, only a brief celebration ensued, with team captain Rajat Patidar and star player Virat Kohli addressing the packed crowd and showcasing the trophy before the event was brought to an early close.Virat Kohli, visibly distressed, later posted on Instagram: “At a loss for words. Absolutely gutted.”His wife, actor Anushka Sharma, also shared RCB’s official statement, expressing her own grief over the loss of lives. The tragedy cast a heavy shadow over what should have been a celebratory milestone for RCB and its passionate fanbase.Former RCB legend AB de Villiers, who was also present at the event, expressed his sorrow on X (formerly Twitter): “My thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by the tragic events at the Chinnaswamy stadium today.”Initial reports suggest that overcrowding and insufficient crowd control measures outside the stadium contributed to the chaos. Thousands of fans had gathered in hopes of catching a glimpse of their cricketing heroes, but the unmanaged swell of supporters led to a tragic crush.The incident has sparked widespread calls for better safety planning and crowd management at large-scale events. What was meant to mark a long-awaited victory has now become a moment of national mourning — a reminder of how celebrations can quickly turn tragic without adequate precautions.","A tragic stampede outside Bengaluru’s M.

Former Sri Lanka off-spinner Sachithra Senanayake has been formally charged under Sri Lanka’s landmark anti-sports corruption law for alleged involvement in match-fixing during a domestic cricket tournament in 2020.The 40-year-old, who played 74 matches for the national side between 2012 and 2016, is accused of attempting to corrupt two players in the Lanka Premier League (LPL) by influencing them to fix matches. The case will be heard at the Hambantota High Court. Senanayake, who was arrested in September 2023, is currently out on bail and has denied all allegations.This marks the first case under the Prevention of Offences Related to Sports Act, enacted in 2019 to tackle growing concerns of corruption in Sri Lankan cricket. If convicted, Senanayake could face up to 10 years in prison, a fine of 100 million rupees (approximately $333,000), or both.The legislation was introduced following pressure from the International Cricket Council (ICC), which had flagged Sri Lanka as one of the most corruption-prone cricket nations.The country’s cricketing integrity has long been under scrutiny. In 2021, ex-sports minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage raised alarm over widespread fixing, while World Cup-winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga previously called for a boycott of matches over mismanagement and corruption.","Sachithra Senanayake has been formally charged under Sri Lanka’s landmark anti- sports corruption law.

World number-one Magnus Carlsen leads World Champion D Gukesh by half a point heading into the final round of Norway Chess 2025 after both players won their classical games in round nine. Carlsen defeated Fabiano Caruana while Gukesh overcame Wei Yi, setting up a thrilling finale with both players vying for the tournament victory.Carlsen's victory came through a pawn sacrifice in the Catalan opening against Caruana, eventually converting an extra pawn in the endgame. The Norwegian felt his opponent's play lacked inspiration throughout the encounter.""I felt that his play was not very inspired most of the time—it didn't feel like he quite had it,"" Carlsen said during the broadcast.Despite his win, Carlsen expressed disappointment about his overall tournament performance, particularly referring to his earlier loss against Gukesh.""The dream of playing a really good tournament burst with that game. I just wanted a score that reflects the fact that I think I'm still significantly better at chess, and since I couldn't achieve that a potential win in the tournament would not mean as much.""Gukesh maintained pressure on Carlsen with an impressive victory over Wei Yi.

But Q3 was the turning point of the game, as the Indiana Pacers started to gain momentum in their play. They were the high scorers for the quarter, but the OKC Thunders were still leading, having scored more than the Pacers in the first half.But finally, in Q4, the Pacers changed the game completely.

BHOPAL: For 15 days in the heat of April-May, a team of wildlife veterinarians trailed a severely injured tiger in Kanha Reserve that seemed to be limping towards death. In a remarkable feat of field medicine, they treated the tiger in the jungle and watched it get back on its feet, regain its vigour and lord over the jungle again.Back from the brink, it took down a 'gaur' (Indian bison) on Wednesday. And its healers were there to quietly cherish the moment. The story began during a routine patrol in early April, when forest staff spotted tiger T118 in distress. It sat next to a waterbody, panting and struggling to get to its feet. Injuries were visible even from a distance. It was in no condition to hunt and would starve to death if the infection didn't kill it sooner.On April 19, a vet team arrived on elephant back, found it in the same location, in a much worse condition. There were deep wounds on its face and limbs. Pus had accumulated.The vets weren't sure if it would survive the journey if they tried to take it to a wildlife hospital. They put together a field treatment plan. After safely tranquilizing the tiger, veterinarians cleaned and sterilised its injuries and administered a combination of antibiotics, anti-inflammatories and antiseptic wound care.Over the next 15 days, oral medications were consistently provided, supported by continuous monitoring.It was a herculean task. It took 10-12 men just to turn it over after it was sedated.Against the odds, T118 began to show signs of recovery. When it began running about, the vets stopped medication but kept up the close supervision with the elephant squad.When they saw it hunt a gaur, they knew their work was done. ""This is a proud moment for us,"" said a senior Kanha official. ""It's not about saving one tiger. It's about refining and validating a model of conservation that treats wildlife in situ - in their natural habitat - with minimal human intervention.""","Injured Kanha Tiger makes triumphant return after 15 days of treatment.

Oklahoma City Thunder game summary





A great surprise, the Indiana Pacers have secured the Game 1 win after trailing behind the Oklahoma City Thunder’s scoreboard almost throughout the game. In a shocking turn, however, the Pacers, like their usual surprise in the playoffs, clinched a narrow 111-110 victory over the dominant Thunder at the Paycom Center in Oklahoma City. Here is the box score, player stats, game summary, and everything you need to know about the Indiana Pacers vs Oklahoma City Thunder Game 1 of the NBA Finals.The Indiana Pacers showed solid offensive execution in their latest game, finishing with a 47.6% shooting mark from the field and a strong 46.2% from three-point range. Leading the scoring effort was Pascal Siakam with 19 points on 7-of-15 shooting. He also added 10 rebounds and 3 assists, continuing to be a reliable presence on both ends. Myles Turner chipped in with 15 points and 9 rebounds in 27 minutes, including two made threes and three blocks.Tyrese Haliburton had a balanced game, scoring 14 points while dishing out six assists and grabbing 10 defensive rebounds. Despite going 0-for-0 from the line, he shot 46.2% from the floor. Andrew Nembhard also added 14 points, connecting on four of his 11 attempts and hitting twice from beyond the arc. His playmaking was evident as he recorded six assists and committed only two turnovers.Obi Toppin came off the bench to provide an efficient 17-point performance, going 6-for-9 from the field and draining five of his eight attempts from deep. Aaron Nesmith hit three three-pointers as well, scoring 10 points and pulling down a team-high 12 rebounds. However, his five turnovers and 33.3% field goal rate slightly marred his overall impact.Among the reserves, T.J. McConnell was efficient, scoring 9 points and handing out four assists in just over 16 minutes. Rookie Ben Sheppard and Thomas Bryant saw limited action, combining for 8 points. The Pacers totaled 111 points, but 24 turnovers and only 15 made free throws out of 21 attempts (71.4%) may have limited their potential to take full control of the game.The Oklahoma City Thunder fell just short of 1 point. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the way once again with a game-high 38 points on 14-of-30 shooting. He knocked down 3-of-6 from deep and went 7-of-8 at the free throw line, also contributing five rebounds, three assists, and three steals in a well-rounded performance.Jalen Williams struggled to find his rhythm offensively, going just 6-of-19 from the floor and 1-of-4 from three, but he still managed 17 points and six assists. Luguentz Dort added 15 points, all from beyond the arc, making 5-of-9 three-pointers while playing over 36 minutes. His energy was felt on defense with four steals and two blocks, even though he ended with a -3 in the plus/minus.Oklahoma City's bench gave a mixed contribution. Alex Caruso chipped in 11 points, six rebounds, and two assists, and Isaiah Hartenstein made a solid impact in limited minutes with 9 points and 9 boards on 60% shooting. Isaiah Joe hit a three and added five quick points in just over 11 minutes of action.Also Read: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Tyrese Haliburton’s dads share a courtside moment before Indiana Pacers vs Oklahoma City Thunder Finals opener Chet Holmgren, however, struggled mightily with just six points on 2-of-9 shooting and no success from deep. He was limited to under 24 minutes and managed only one block. Cason Wallace added six points. The Thunder were efficient from the free-throw line (87.5%) and had 14 steals, but their 39.8% shooting overall and six turnovers ultimately weren’t enough to close the gap.",Indiana Pacers: Box score and player stats.

Rick Carlisle calls leaked ESPN reports ""sad"" and praises Burke’s groundbreaking legacy







Just hours before the Indiana Pacers tipped off Game 1 of the 2025 NBA Finals, head coach Rick Carlisle shifted the pregame narrative away from basketball and directly into the ESPN broadcasting booth. Carlisle passionately defended longtime broadcaster Doris Burke amid swirling reports that she may not return to the network’s top NBA broadcast crew next season. The well-timed show of support came in the wake of a report by The Athletic detailing potential changes to ESPN’s lead trio of Burke, Mike Breen, and Richard Jefferson.During his pregame press conference Thursday, Rick Carlisle used his opening remarks to praise Doris Burke, not for her Finals coverage, but for her astonishing impact on sports media.“She’s changed the game for women in broadcasting,” Carlisle said. “Doris is a great example of courage and putting herself out there. It was just so sad to see these reports leaked, really, unnecessarily, before such a celebrated event.”The coach’s comments come as Burke faces growing scrutiny from some viewers and uncertainty over her future with ESPN. While Mike Breen is reportedly signed long-term, Burke and Jefferson are both out of contract after the Finals.According to The Athletic, ESPN is weighing whether to scale back from a three-person booth that could leave Burke on the outside.Carlisle, also president of the National Basketball Coaches Association, made his personal stake in the matter clear by citing his daughter and the many female professionals inspired by Burke’s work.“I have a daughter who just turned 21… Doris is a friend,” he said. “There are many women she’s paved the way for—Sarah Kustok, Lisa Byington, Kate Scott, Monica McNutt, Katy Wenge, Zora Stephenson, Ann Meyers Drysdale, Marney Gellner… I just want to say thank you to Doris for the example she has put forth for young women like my daughter.”Carlisle also addressed Burke’s basketball IQ, joking, “I’ve asked her many times, why don’t you get into coaching? She has such great knowledge.”Criticism of Burke reached a boiling point when she referred to Oklahoma City Thunder’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander as a “free-throw merchant,” sparking online backlash. Burke addressed the negativity on The ESPN Communications Podcast, saying, “Usually, I can tell I’m doing a decent job when multiple fan bases are pissed off at me… I love SGA. Absolutely love him.”Also Read: “Get your hands off me”: Shaquille O'Neal throws Stephen A Smith out during pregame show in a lighthearted moment While her future at ESPN remains uncertain, Burke certainly has powerful allies, including Carlisle.","Rick Carlisle called Doris Burke's ESPN future ""sad"" and praised her groundbreaking legacy.

'A particularly special feeling': Andy Flower hails Virat Kohli, RCB after historic title win





NEW DELHI: A chilling old warning issued by a Chennai Super Kings (CSK) fan club in 2024 has resurfaced and gone viral in the wake of the tragic stampede during Royal Challengers Bengaluru's (RCB) IPL 2025 victory celebrations that left several people dead and many others injured. RCB clinched their maiden IPL title by defeating Punjab Kings in the 2025 final, prompting massive celebrations in Bengaluru. However, what should have been a historic moment for the franchise turned into a disaster as a stampede broke out during the team’s celebratory parade, resulting in loss of lives and widespread injuries.In the aftermath of the tragedy, fans on social media have revived a 2024 post from a CSK fan account, which had warned about the lack of safety for women and families at Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru during IPL matches.""To our fans who came and supported us today at Bangalore. Hope you reached home safe! Forever grateful for your love and support! However, with the treatment we witnessed towards all the women, children and families, this is shambles. This is not the Bengaluru we knew. What we can say is that Bengaluru is NOT safe for any women to watch an IPL game in Chinnaswamy if you are not part of the local fandom.The security and fan behaviour is a letdown beyond words and imagination,"" the original post from 2024 had stated.Now, in light of the recent tragedy, the same fan account has reposted their warning, expressing frustration over how their earlier concerns were dismissed.“Lot of engagement from fans on this old tweet. Yes, we did raise concerns about security and safety back in 2024! Instead of the RCB management acknowledging the problem and facing it, trolls came for defence with responses like ‘where is the proof’, ‘sore losers’, ‘use burnol’, ‘sympathy’, ‘this is not harassment’, and what not!""Unfortunately, what happened in 2025 could have been easily avoided if only there was responsibility, attitude, and intention to acknowledge reality!” the CSK fan club posted on Thursday.The resurfaced post has sparked a fresh debate on fan behaviour, security lapses, and event management during high-profile cricket events in India — raising difficult questions for RCB and local authorities to answer.IPL champions RCB announced a financial assistance of Rs 10 lakh each for the families of the 11 supporters, who lost their lives in a stampede outside the Chinnaswamy Stadium during the team's IPL victory celebrations.""The unfortunate incident in Bengaluru yesterday has caused a lot of anguish and pain to the RCB family,"" RCB issued a statement on social media on Thursday.""As a mark of respect and a gesture of solidarity, RCB has announced a financial support of Rs 10 lakh to each of the eleven families of the deceased. In addition, a fund called RCB Cares is also being created to support fans injured in this tragic incident,"" it added.More than 50 people were injured in the incident.","IPL champions RCB announced a financial assistance of Rs 10 lakh each for the families of the 11 supporters, who lost their lives in a stampede outside the Chinnaswamy Stadium during the team's victory celebrations.

IPL 2025 Final | Rishi Sunak Interview: 'I am a big Virat Kohli fan... RCB is my team'

Poll What do you think of Carlsen's reaction against Gukesh? Yes, emotions are natural. He should have controlled his emotions in a better way.





Five-time World chess champion V Anand has come up with three significant observations about the Magnus Carlsen meltdown at the ongoing Norway chess tournament.“Carlsen wanted to draw a line in the sand with 2-0 score against Gukesh,” Anand told TOI from Stavanger. “Chess players start to believe that some moves are beneath you, and then you are amazed to find out otherwise,” he added.This explained nicely what Carlsen went through during and after the sixth-round defeat against Gukesh on Sunday and his statement afterwards. The Norwegian, after suffering an out of character defeat, let his frustration known to the world. Besides banging the table while losing to Gukesh, the Norwegian also said he has no motivation to play Classical chess and is unsure of playing the format in near future, including the Norway event next year.Anand pointed out that Carlsen has expressed his reservations about Classical chess in the past too. “It’s natural” and doesn’t surprise him anymore. “But it remains to be seen if the last two rounds in Norway are indeed the last two Classical games of Carlsen’s career,” Anand said.Anand, 55, who also wears several hats —a mentor, deputy president of the world governing body FIDE and a webcast commentator — was asked if Carlsen’s reaction was a result of having fumbled his lines big time against Gukesh.“Everything goes into the pot, right? Certainly the game meant a lot to him, and he came close and slipped. But it could also be fatigue. It could be this new time control. But in this game (vs Gukesh), I think something he wanted to establish, he wanted to draw some line on the sand or tell all these kids, hang on a few years more, whatever. This meant a lot to him. I think with a 2-0 here (100% score against Gukesh), he would have been very, very happy. ”Most importantly, Anand felt Carlsen would have hated losing such a good position against any op - ponent. “These moments matter because you begin to think something that some chess moves (simple moves to convert or draw) are beneath you and you are quite amazed to find out that they are not. You think after so much practice, I should be at least able to trust that I don’t do this (mistake)! That’s the feeling. And as far as the attention it is getting, I’m not complaining!”Anand recalled himself blowing away a winning position against Carlsen in the 2022 Norway meet. And though he didn’t lose that game, the subsequent victory in the Armageddon game didn’t help him feel less miserable anyway.Anand also hailed Carlsen as the “best Classical player in history”. “I understand there are other contenders, but I think he probably pulls ahead because of many details. And on top of that, he’s really put his stamp, especially very early. But keeping that quality all along, winning equal positions, snatching points out of the blue. He’s done so much,” said Anand. “I don’t think it’s our job or my job to particularly react to whether it’s a normal part of life that at some point people stop doing something. But I still have great admiration for what he has done for Classical chess.”Saying that Gukesh is a tenacious defender, Anand said, “And as they say, no one won a game by resigning. That’s the main thing. People often give up and Gukesh just keeps on playing these totally lost positions.“But not pointless ones. He plays the ones where he still has a little bit of counterplay and he finds re - sources to hang in there. And people get careless. In both games (vs Carslen and Arjun), Gukesh played extremely poorly. If that’s a conscious decision to provoke a struggle, I would be alarmed. They were really lousy positions. But then it also tells me that he is an amazing fighter. At the same time, I would not be happy if he depended (only) on that skill. ”","Five-time World chess champion V Anand has come up with three observations about the Magnus Carlsen meltdown at the ongoing Norway chess tournament. “Carlsen wanted to draw a line in the sand with 2-0 score against Gukesh,” Anand told TOI from Stavanger.

It’s not everyday that a team calls back former head coach after firing them, and its even rarer to see a team calling back a coach and offer them the role of an assistant coach. The New York Rangers called their former coach, David Quinn to join them, not as a head coach, but as an assistant to Mike Sullivan. While the designation of Quinn has been demoted, many expected him not to join the Rangers again. However, it seems Quinn is more than happy to be a part of the New York Rangers. Will this new position affect his performance? Or will he be able to guide the team under Sullivan’s umbrella?David Quinn was head coach for the New York Rangers from 2018 to 2021, where he guided the team by making important decisions. However, when Chris Drury became the Rangers’ General Manager, he fired Quinn from his role, which led to a sour departure on Quinn’s side.After getting relieved from the Rangers, Quinn went on to coach the San Jose Sharks from 2022 to 2024, after which he was called back by the Rangers in 2025. But, what made Quinn take this decision/ his last interaction with the Rangers was not exactly roses, but his bond with Mike Sullivan helped the Rangers hire Quinn. Even though the role is smaller than before, it is surprising that Quinn agreed to it.However, it’s not just David Quinn who’s going to join the New York Rangers as there are other spots left in the coaching staff.As per news, Joe Sacco and Ty Hennes will fill out the remaining roles. Though it is not made clear as to what designation Sacco and Hennes will get, it is sure that both will be joining the Rangers.The New York Rangers have failed to win the Stanley Cup since 1994. There have been various changes in coaching staff, players, and other tactics were applied, but all to vain. With Mike Sullivan taking on the role of the head coach, there’s hope amongst fans that the Rangers will rise again.Mike Sullivan guided the Pittsburgh Penguins and helped them win two Stanley Cups in 2016 and 2017. Besides, Sullivan had also coached Team USA at the 4-Nation’s face off, which gives him an edge over other coaches. Another reason as to why Quinn willingly accepted the demoted role was because he had earlier worked with Sullivan in Pittsburgh and Team USA, both in an assistant role.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky makes bold call for Oilers in Stanley Cup Finals showdown","David Quinn was head coach for the New York Rangers from 2018 to 2021.

'We will try and win this for Virat Kohli': Rajat Patidar before IPL Final

Poll Did Shreyas Iyer's leadership positively impact the PBKS squad? Absolutely Somewhat Not really Not at all





As Shashank Singh walked off the field following his 61*(30) in the IPL 2025 final, Shreyas Iyer was among the first to offer solace. Punjab Kings (PBKS) fell short by just six runs, which would have definitely hurt Shreyas, who had earlier shared that winning means everything to him. A win on Tuesday at the Narendra Modi Stadium would've made him the first captain to win two consecutive IPL titles with two different teams.This season, Shreyas had showcased selflessness of the highest order with the way he spearheaded an inexperienced PBKS squad to the final. The Mohali-based franchise had finished ninth in the previous edition and had not qualified for the playoffs in 11 years.While Priyansh Arya and Josh Inglis were featuring in the IPL for the first time, the likes of Nehal Wadhera and Azmatullah Omarzai also had limited experience. Shreyas had to further deal with the exits of Glenn Maxwell and Lockie Ferguson due to injuries. The PBKS setup suffered a major setback in the playoffs following the unavailability of South African all-rounder Marco Jansen, who left the squad due to the World Test Championship (WTC) final.Shreyas navigated all the challenges with his ice-cold calmness, maintaining confidence through thick and thin. There was constant emphasis on making the players feel secure by backing them despite failures.Priyansh enjoyed quality backing despite periods of inconsistency. The show of confidence powered the 24-year-old to score 475 runs at a strike rate of 179.24 in his maiden IPL season. Shreyas further empowered opener Prabhsimran Singh to realise his true potential following a topsy-turvy run in the past. Prabhsimran emerged as the highest-scoring uncapped player in IPL 2025, smashing 549 runs in 17 matches at a strike rate of 160.52.m ""Shreyas talks to me like a friend. He says, 'Just play in the manner which suits you',"" said Arya.Even Wadhera and Shashank made their presence felt, bringing solidity to the middle and lower order. One of Wadhera's most prominent performances came in 'Qualifier 2', where he smashed 48 off 29 balls, enabling PBKS to chase down 204 against MI. Shashank brought explosiveness and experience down the order, stepping up whenever promoted as well.However, the most impressive aspect of Shreyas' captaincy was the way he batted. The PBKS captain amassed 604 runs at an average of 50.33.Shreyas' tally of 39 sixes in IPL 2025 is the second-highest number of sixes registered by an Indian batter in an IPL season. The PBKS captain showcased a batting masterclass in the second qualifier, delivering a beautiful amalgamation of aggression and composure during his unbeaten 87 off 41 balls. The Punjab-based franchise has been quite entertaining under Shreyas, notably smashing more than 200 runs in seven IPL 2025 matches. PBKS hit 173 sixes during the season—an impressive tally compared to second-placed Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), who accumulated 152 sixes.""Shreyas has real hunger in his eyes to do well. He wants to evolve and develop into the best leader and captain that he can be,"" said PBKS head coach Ricky Ponting.Shreyas is known for his ability to perform magic tricks, which certainly reflected in the transformation of the bowling department. The same team which once struggled to defend large totals showcased immense composure to pull off wins comprehensively.While Arshdeep Singh (21 wickets) and Jansen (16 wickets) made their presence felt, Shreyas backed Chahal (16 wickets) despite expensive spells. The spinner repaid the faith, especially in a league match against KKR, picking four wickets as PBKS defended 112.Shreyas' tactical acumen further stood out in his crafty utilisation of Vyshak Vijaykumar, with the pacer's variations frustrating batters. Vyshak bowled wide yorkers in the Eliminator against GT, delivering knuckle-balls craftily in the second qualifier, which made a big difference.While Shreyas is certainly a great teammate, he is also stern about maintaining top-notch standards. The PBKS captain lashed out at Shashank following his clumsy run-out in the second qualifier, showcasing the emphasis on being competitive.",Shreyas Iyer captained Punjab Kings to the IPL 2025 final in Jaipur. PBKS lost to Mumbai Indians by six runs. Iyer is the first captain to win two consecutive IPL titles with two different teams. Shreyas is known for his ability to perform magic tricks.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121649613,imgsize-176626,width-400,resizemode-4/121649613.jpg"
