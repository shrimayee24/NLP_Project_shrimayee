When he has tried and tried so hard — won the Orange Cap yet again and done so much yet again, and the franchise fails again. I understand for the brand of the team and the commercial value he brings to the team... But Virat Kohli deserves a trophy. He deserves to play in a team that could help him to get that trophy,"" Pietersen remarked.Pietersen further pointed out Kohli's roots in Delhi and suggested that he should consider joining Delhi Capitals . He drew parallels with sports icons like David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo , Lionel Messi , and Harry Kane , who switched teams to achieve greater success.""I actually think it should be Delhi. Delhi is the place where Virat needs to go. Virat can go away and stay at home most of the time, I know he has a home in Delhi. He has a young family. He can spend more time there. He is a Delhi boy. Why can't he go back? Delhi are as desperate as Bengaluru,"" he added.With this victory, Rajasthan Royals advance to Qualifier 2, where they will face Sunrisers Hyderabad for a spot in the IPL 2024 final against Kolkata Knight Riders.

' mercurial bunch in final today

CHENNAI: The year was 2012. Shah Rukh Khan 's daughter Suhana still hadn't reached her teens. After the first four years of struggle, as Kolkata Knight Riders won a magical final at Chepauk, beating two-time defending champions Chennai Super Kings, 'King Khan' couldn't control his emotions and was on the verge of jumping from the first floor balcony of the stadium.Suhana stopped her dad that moment, but the celebration (and pandemonium) that followed in the team hotel through the night was the experience of a lifetime for those who were there.Cut to 2024 and KKR are close to revisiting similar sensations. But standing in their way is an unpredictable Sunrisers Hyderabad team, who have lost twice to the Knights this year, the most recent being in the first Qualifier in Ahmedabad on Tuesday.Some of the key protagonists of that 2012 triumph for KKR are still there - then-captain Gautam Gambhir is now the mentor while Sunil Narine remains the No. 1 weapon for the Kolkata team, albeit in a different form.Now with a much-modified action, Narine, with an economy rate of 6.9, is still a bowler who is difficult to score runs off. But it's his no-holds barred batting at the top of the order that has become one of the talking points of this IPL The West Indian has the ability to clear the fence whenever the ball is in his hitting arc, which can be worrying for somebody like Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who banks on his swing early on at a pace of around 130 km/hr. For SRH, the best chance against Narine will be to try and bowl short at a good pace, something that skipper Pat Cummins can do if he chooses to.On Friday, SRH had two unlikely bowling heroes in left-arm spinners Abhishek Sharma and Shahbaz Ahmed on a black-soil pitch, but the track is going to be changed for the final. The game the wrist spinners should get a bit of help, provided the dew doesn't come in.Narine and his mystery spin partner C Varun, who has got 20 wickets in this IPL, could be crucial. Captain Shreyas Iyer stressed on that in the press conference just before KKR's practice schedule was halted by an afternoon shower.""Narine and Varun's roles are going to be important. They have been spot on in terms of executing their plans and have been able to control the runs in the middle overs. I hope they will be able to do that on Sunday as well,"" Iyer said.All the indications are that KKR will start the final as overwhelming favourites, but there's something about this SRH team that doesn't quite rule them out of the contest.While Cummins' astute captaincy is one of the crucial elements, it is the explosive nature of their opening duo of Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head that will keep KKR team management worried. Head didn't play the first time these two teams played against each other this season, while in Qualifier 1, he got a first-ball duck, unable to deal with the pace and swing of the ever-improving Mitchell Starc . But there's always an unpredictability about Head's game and captain Iyer will hope that Starc delivers the sucker punch once again early on.The second big hurdle that can come in KKR's way is in the form of Heinrich Klaasen, who was brilliant during his 34-ball 50 in the second Qualifier on Friday.He has everything in his batting arsenal to deal with the spin threat of Narine and Varun and add to that the confidence that he has gained from his Friday show.But KKR too are hungry. Their mentor Gautam Gambhir's ""obsession for success"" seems to have rubbed on and it will need an extraordinary performance from SRH to stop the marauding Knights from running away with their third title.","Kolkata Knight Riders face Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL final. KKR won the tournament in 2012, beating two-time defending champions Chennai Super Kings.

Ruturaj Gaikwad reveals MS Dhoni's leadership lessons: 'Being neutral and not getting too excited',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/exclusive-ruturaj-gaikwad-reveals-ms-dhonis-leadership-lessons-being-neutral-and-not-get-too-excited/articleshow/110431988.cms,"NEW DELHI: Young skipper with big responsibilities—that's how Ruturaj Gaikwad 's maiden captaincy stint with the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) can be defined. Ahead of IPL 2024 , the legendary Mahendra Singh Dhoni passed the baton to Gaikwad, who has been one of CSK 's most consistent batters.The task was daunting, but a calm Ruturaj grabbed the opportunity with both hands. He had a sense of security with the 42-year-old Dhoni still behind the stumps, guiding him in decision-making, field placements, and tactical use of bowlers in various situations.Despite Ruturaj's inability to guide the five-time champions to the playoffs in IPL 2024, his debut as Dhoni's successor earned him admiration as he showed promise that he will excel in the coming seasons.Ruturaj's team was eliminated from playoff contention after a crucial loss to Royal Challengers Bengaluru. CSK finished fifth with seven wins, seven losses, and 14 points, missing out on the final four due to an inferior net run rate.""Felt good right from the start as it comes with responsibility and I like responsibility. As a captain I take up a balanced approach between both (batting and captaincy),"" Ruturaj told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.When Ruturaj stepped onto the field with a bat, he carried no burden of captaincy. He batted with the same ease and confidence instilled in him by the great Dhoni since his CSK debut. On the field, he was as calm as a cucumber.Ruturaj emerged as CSK's top run-scorer in the tournament, scoring 583 runs in 14 matches at an impressive average of 53.00. He maintained a strike rate of 141.16 and also notched up one century and four half-centuries.Instructing senior players like Dhoni, Ravindra Jadeja , and Ajinkya Rahane may seem daunting to some, but Ruturaj handled it with poise.""I felt good right from the start (of the tournament). I am very approachable for all teammates whenever needed and they always support the team in whatever way the team requires.""""I wouldn't say it’s difficult as all of them are very understanding. All the senior players that are a part of the team are great to be with. Their experience always helps with match situations,"" Ruturaj said.Ruturaj was CSK's primary pick for captaincy, ensuring a seamless transition while Dhoni remained in the team.Despite the weighty expectations set by Dhoni, who led the Yellow Army to five title triumphs (2010, 2011, 2018, 2021, and 2023), Ruturaj remained unfazed by his leadership responsibilities.Instead, he expressed gratitude to CSK fans for accepting the change in the team's leadership.""Being neutral is something that I have learnt from Mahi bhai. Not getting too excited about anything or being down by anything is the right approach that I have picked up,"" Ruturaj said.""While batting irrespective of being captain or not, my approach is always the same. Doesn’t really change a lot. You cannot plan to become leaders so being good team players and putting the team first will always stand a good chance to be one,"" the CSK skipper added.On being asked about his association with Amrutanjan, Ruturaj said: ""I'm extremely delighted to be partnering with Amrutanjan Healthcare for Electro+ Rehydrate. Hydration and maintaining energy levels are crucial, not just for athletes like me, but for everyone in their daily lives"".","Ruturaj Gaikwad captained Chennai Super Kings in IPL 2024.

But the success that this humble Aussie paceman has achieved over the last one and a half years is simply unmatched.Australia broke Indian hearts in the World Test Championship final and ODI World Cup final last year, and now he is one step away from winning T20 cricket's biggest franchise event - the IPL. It was only MS Dhoni who had an ODI World Cup and an IPL title (in 2011) under his belt as captain at the same time, and Cummins knows he can do one better with Sunrisers Hyderabad ""Yes, it's been a great couple of years. But I haven't done much T20 captaincy before this, having captained in ODIs helped though,"" a relaxed Cummins said, taking his eyes off Dhoni as a re-run of a CSK game was being played on a screen inside the press-room.There's an understated nature about his captaincy, even though you can see that he is an astute reader of the game. The Indian team got a feel of his tactical acumen in Ahmedabad last Nov and that's probably one of the reasons the SRH management punted on him, picking Cummins up for Rs 20.5 crore from the auctions.""He is a very practical guy, very humble. He is empathetic towards his teammates and coaching staff. And he keeps it simple, our team meeting today (Friday) went on for like 35 seconds,"" SRH assistant coach Simon Helmot said after the team's win against Rajasthan Royals in the second qualifier.In this day and age, some of the captains are absolutely obsessed with data analysis, but Cummins is probably a little old school in this regard, even though he isn't closed to new-age technology.""I think data analytics play a role but it can take you so far, a captain probably needs to be intuitive. It's actually a balance of information you gather from objective data and your own intuition,"" Cummins said, analysis his methods of captaincy.It's interesting that only three foreign captains have won the IPL - Shane Warne (2008), Adam Gilchrist (2009) and David Warner (2016). It's not always easy for foreigners to understand how it works for Indian rookies, but Cummins, who isn't an IPL regular, seems to have taken to it like a duck to water.""There's a lot of pressure on the Indian guys in the IPL. So, instead of trying to change how they play, it's better to keep them encouraging and see how it works. And when the tough moments come, it is about rallying around each other,"" said Cummins.It's this simplicity in his approach that has taken his team so far and one more win on Sunday will ensure that Cummins holds an exclusive place in Indian cricket history.","Pat Cummins is one step away from winning T20 cricket's biggest franchise event - the IPL.

CHENNAI: Two-time IPL champions Kolkata Knight Riders won both their titles under the captaincy of Gautam Gambhir , but this time as mentor, he once again proved to be a catalyst for them. KKR laid their hands on the IPL trophy for the first time in 2012 at Chepauk, courtesy Gambhir , who was the key contributor to that glory as a captain and a batter. And, now 12 years later, Gambhir, will again be entering the same venue - MA Chidambaram Stadium - for the IPL 2024 showdown, after orchestrating the team into the summit clash.Commending Gambhir's expertise and tactics, KKR captain Shreyas Iyer said the 42-year-old former Indian opener adds a lot of cream to the team. ""I feel that he has got immense knowledge about how the game is played. And his strategies have been spot on, in terms of what execution we have to make against a particular opponent. With his knowledge, hopefully, we'll continue with the same momentum in the final,"" said Iyer.Gambhir, who is in contention for the India coach's job, also created a secure environment where the players were given enough leeway to perform. Iyer feels when young players are given the freedom and are backed in the dressing room, they tend to excel. ""When these young guys come in, they are fearless in their approach. They want to go out there and perform. But then need the freedom. And when you back them during tough times, that's when they deliver the best. And when these guys step up at the right time, they see to it that they win matches for you,"" said Iyer.Ahead of the IPL, Iyer was in the spotlight for the wrong reasons. The Mumbai batter's absence from Ranji Trophy matches cost him a spot on the BCCI's central contract list for the 2024-25 season.After an eventful ODI World Cup in December last year, Iyer said he had some issues and hence was unable to turn up for a few Ranji games.""I was definitely struggling after the World Cup in the longer format. And when I raised my concern no one would agree to it. But at the same time, the competition is with me. When the IPL was approaching, all I wanted was to see to it that I put my best foot forward. And the transformation from red-ball cricket to white ball, it's kind of difficult as a batter. It was difficult at the start. But once you get used to it, I think you pick up the pace and match on with the other players,"" explained Iyer.",Two-time IPL champions Kolkata Knight Riders won both their titles under the captaincy of Gautam Gambhir.

NEW DELHI: Shreyas Iyer-led teams have reached the IPL final twice in the last four years.

Where I stand (as a skipper) is definitely on you (to decide),"" Iyer replied to a query from PTI during the pre-match conference on Saturday.Regarding Gambhir's contribution as the mentor, Iyer described him as one of the finest readers of the game in the T20 format.""About Gautam bhai, I feel he has got immense knowledge about how the game is played. He has won two titles previously with KKR, and his strategies have been spot-on in terms of what execution we have to make against the opposition.""Iyer exuded confidence in KKR's victory over SRH , especially with Gambhir's invaluable inputs from the dugout.""Hopefully, we keep continuing with the same momentum with his knowledge.""The last six months has been quite a roller-coaster journey for the stylish right-hander, whose initial reluctance to play red-ball domestic cricket saw him lose the BCCI central contract.Iyer did come back and play the Ranji Trophy final against Vidarbha where he scored a 95 in the second innings.The 29-year-old had a middling IPL so far and also wasn't remotely in contention for a berth in the T20 World Cup side.The scars have not healed, and were evident when he spoke about how people didn't believe him when he talked about his struggles with a back injury, which seemed to have resurfaced.""I was definitely struggling after the World Cup in the longer format.

West Indies captain Brandon King chose to bat first and led by example, scoring 36 off 22 balls. Kyle Mayers also contributed with an aggressive 32 off 16 balls, including three sixes, before falling in the ninth over with the score at 83-3. Both King and Mayers were dismissed by debutant leg spinner Nqabayomzi Peter, who impressed for South Africa.However, it was the 63-run partnership between Chase and Romario Shepherd that made the difference. Chase showcased his elegant stroke play, hitting seven fours and two sixes, but was denied strike in the final over when Lungi Ngidi picked up two wickets and conceded just three runs. Medium-pacer Andile Phehlukwayo had a challenging day, ending with figures of 2-51 off his three overs.South Africa's reply began with a blistering start, as openers Reeza Hendricks and Quinton de Kock amassed 81 in 4.5 overs before De Kock was bowled by slow left-armer Akeal Hosein for 41 off just 17 balls, having hit four fours and four sixes. Hendricks followed in the next over, bowled by Chase's off-spin for 34 off 18 balls with three sixes.Slow left-armer Gudakesh Motie kept South Africa in check, taking 3-22 from his four overs, including the crucial wicket of skipper Rassie van der Dussen , who had threatened with his aggressive 30 off 22 before hitting a wide full toss to Hosein at long-off.The tourists' tail struggled to keep up with the required run-rate in the final overs, allowing West Indies to secure the series win and serve as a reminder of their potential as two-time winners in the upcoming T20 World Cup.""It's an amazing feeling. Chase is very valuable. Very happy with his performance. They had a good start but it finished well for us.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh managed to salvage some pride by defeating the USA by 10 wickets in the final match of the three-game series on Saturday in Houston. Mustafizur Rahman 's exceptional bowling performance, taking six wickets, restricted the Americans to a mere 104-9 in their 20 overs. The visitors chased down the target in just 11.4 overs without losing a wicket.Despite the loss, the United States claimed the series 2-1, having surprised their higher-ranked opponents by winning the first two games. This series victory serves as a significant boost to their confidence as they prepare to co-host the upcoming T20 World Cup with the West Indies.The American innings started well with Shayan Jahangir and Andries Gous putting on 46 runs before Gous, who had scored 27 off 15 balls with four fours and a six, was caught by Soumya Sarkar off Shakib Al Hasan 's bowling. Jahingir, who contributed 18 runs, followed soon after, caught by Tanzim Hasan Sakib while attempting to pull a delivery from Mustafizur. The hosts struggled to maintain their momentum, scoring only 14 runs while losing three more wickets. Mustafizur, bowling his second spell at the death, finished with his career-best T20I figures of 6-10.Bangladesh's chase was comfortable, with Tanzid Hasan scoring 58 off 42 balls and Soumya contributing 43 off 28 deliveries. The American bowlers failed to exert any significant pressure on the Bangladeshi batsmen.Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto expressed satisfaction with his team's response to the two previous losses, stating, ""I think the boys showed a lot of character today. I think the plan we made before this match, everyone executed.""He acknowledged the disappointment of losing the series but emphasized the importance of finishing on a positive note and gaining valuable experience ahead of the World Cup.USA vice-captain Aaron Jones attributed the loss to poor shot selection by the American batsmen.

"'Struggled with back issues after World Cup, no one...': KKR captain Shreyas Iyer",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/struggled-with-back-issues-after-world-cup-no-one-kkr-captain-shreyas-iyer/articleshow/110426972.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ahead of the Indian Premier League (IPL) final against Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) skipper Shreyas Iyer opened up about his struggles with back issues following the Cricket World Cup last year, noting the lack of understanding he faced.KKR and SRH will clash in the IPL 2024 final at Chennai's Chepauk Stadium on Sunday. KKR topped the league stage with nine wins, three losses, and two no-results, amassing 20 points. They secured a direct spot in the final by defeating SRH in the first qualifier. SRH earned their place in the final by beating the Rajasthan Royals (RR) by 36 runs in the second qualifier.It has been a challenging and mixed period for Iyer. After dealing with fitness and form issues last year, he made his comeback in the Asia Cup but again faced back problems. He returned for the ODI series against Australia just before the World Cup, solidifying his spot in the middle-order.Despite a rough start, Iyer had an exceptional World Cup campaign, scoring 530 runs at an average of 66.25, with two centuries and three fifties. He became the first middle-order batter in World Cup history to score over 500 runs. Iyer peaked near the tournament's end, with consecutive centuries against the Netherlands and New Zealand, the latter in a record 67-ball knock in the semifinals. However, he scored just four runs in the final, which India lost to Australia.Following the World Cup, Iyer had a disappointing Test series in South Africa. He prepared for the next challenge against England at home by playing in the Ranji Trophy but was dropped after poor performances in the first two Tests. He missed the Ranji quarterfinals due to back spasms but returned for the semifinals, scoring 95 runs in the final despite battling back pain. Despite playing a crucial role in Mumbai's 42nd triumph, Iyer's return to domestic red-ball cricket seemed too late, as he was dropped from BCCI's Central Contract list in February.In the IPL, Iyer has participated in all games and earned praise for his leadership, guiding KKR to the finals. In 14 matches, Iyer has scored 345 runs at an average of 38.33 and a strike rate of 146.18, with two half-centuries. His best score, 58*, came in the first qualifier against SRH.Speaking ahead of the final clash, Iyer said during the press conference, ""I was definitely struggling after the World Cup in the longer format (with back issues). When I raised my concern, no one was agreeing to it.""""But at the same time the competition is with myself. When the IPL was approaching all I wanted to see was that I have put my best foot forward and whatever planning and strategising we [KKR] did before it, basically if we could execute it to the best of our abilities, we would have been in a great spot - and that is where we are right now,"" he added.Former Indian cricketer Gautam Gambhir, who led KKR to two titles back in 2012 and 2014, returned as a mentor for this year's tournament for the Knights after two underwhelming seasons spent near the bottom of the points table.Talking about Gambhir's return to the franchise, Iyer said hilariously, ""The hype is definitely created by you guys (about Gambhir's return).""He also lauded Gambhir's ""immense knowledge of the game"". ""His strategies have been spot on in terms of what we have to execute against our opponents. He adds a lot of cream to the team and hopefully we continue the same momentum in the final,"" he added.Talking about his preparations for the IPL, Iyer said that transitioning from red-ball cricket to the white-ball cricket after the Ranji Trophy final was difficult both for batters and bowlers.""It was kind of difficult at the start but once you get used to it, I think you pick up the pace and march on with the other players,"" he added.Iyer said that KKR being two-time champions and one time runners-up does not give them any advantage over SRH being a one-time champion and two-time runners-up.""It is on skill and mindset tomorrow. The best team is going to win,"" he added.On the playing surface, the wicket is different from what it was yesterday during the qualifier two between SRH and Rajasthan Royals (RR), said Iyer.""It is red soil, yesterday it was black. Looking through TV, we thought dew was going to play a role, but it did not the ball started spinning,"" he concluded.","Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) skipper Shreyas Iyer opened up about his struggles with back issues following the Cricket World Cup last year.

NEW DELHI: England defeated Pakistan by 23 runs in the second T20 international at Edgbaston on Saturday, thanks to a stunning innings from captain Jos Buttler , who scored 84 runs.After Pakistan won the toss and chose to field, Buttler capitalized on the favorable batting conditions. He scored 84 off 51 balls, hitting eight fours and three sixes.The 33-year-old opener reached his half-century with his signature premeditated scoop shot, sending a yorker from fast bowler Haris Rauf over fine leg.Buttler received support from Will Jacks, who scored 37, and Jonny Bairstow, who added 21. Despite a middle-order collapse, Jofra Archer stepped up in the final over, hitting Mohammad Amir for a four and a six, helping England to a total of 183-7.Pakistan lost Mohammad Rizwan for a duck in the first over when Moeen Ali had him caught and his opening partner Saim Ayub holed out in the deep to leave the tourists reeling at 14-2.Fakhar Zaman and skipper Babar Azam (32) scored freely to stitch together a 53-run stand off 28 balls but Moeen struck again to dismiss Azam lbw. Zaman fell for a well-made 45 off 21 balls to leave Pakistan at 100-6.Iftikhar Ahmed (23) and Imad Wasim (22) provided resistance but the target proved to be out of reach for Pakistan's tail as they were dismissed for 160.England's Archer (2-28) got his first wickets after 14 months on the sidelines due to an elbow injury when he had both Azam Khan and Wasim caught in the covers.The first match of the four-game series was washed out without a ball bowled. The next two games will be played on Tuesday and Thursday before England travel to the United States and West Indies to defend their T20 World Cup title.","England defeat Pakistan by 23 runs in second T20 international at Edgbaston.

NEW DELHI: Paris Saint-Germain emerged victorious against Lyon in the French Cup final on Saturday, securing a 2-1 win as Kylian Mbappe made his final appearance for the club. Despite Mbappe's inability to add to his impressive goal tally, Ousmane Dembele and Fabian Ruiz found the back of the net in the first half.Lyon mounted a comeback attempt in the second half, with Jake O'Brien scoring to reduce the deficit. However, PSG managed to withstand the pressure and clinch their 15th French Cup title, further solidifying their dominance in the competition over the past decade.The victory allowed PSG to achieve a domestic league and cup double under the guidance of Luis Enrique in his debut season as coach. Nevertheless, the campaign remains somewhat overshadowed by their Champions League semi-final exit against Borussia Dortmund .Unfortunately, the lead-up to the final was marred by clashes between rival fans at a motorway toll south of Lille. The incidents involved approximately 300 supporters from both sides, resulting in two coaches being set on fire and 20 fans sustaining minor injuries. French President Emmanuel Macron , who was present at the final, condemned the violence.Mbappe's farewell appearance for his hometown club marked his 308th match for PSG since joining from Monaco in a high-profile transfer in August 2017.

PARIS: This could be Rafael Nadal ’s last dance at Roland Garros . Then again, maybe not.

“It's a big, big chance that it’s going to be my last Roland Garros,” Nadal said. “But if (you are asking me) that it's 100 percent my last Roland Garros, sorry, I cannot predict what's going to happen.”

“I have been going through a long process of recovery with a very difficult injury, almost two years of suffering, a recovery process that seems like I feel better now,” the 37-year-old said. “I’m not a guy that reacts because I lost there or somewhere else. I react about my personal feelings, and my personal feelings are better now than one month and a half ago.”

“I don't want to close 100 percent the door, because first thing, I’m enjoying playing tennis . Second thing, I’m traveling with the family. They are enjoying. I’m enjoying sharing all this process with them. And third thing, I was not able to explore yet the proper way of how I will be able to play again more or less healthy, playing without limitation.”

Nadal, who will turn 38 in the next few days, asked for time.

“Maybe in a month and a half I say, it's enough, I can't keep going,” he said. “but today, I cannot guarantee that it is going to be the last (Roland Garros).”

Rafael Nadal says he is feeling better,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/french-open/rafael-nadal-says-he-is-feeling-better/articleshow/110426163.cms,"PARIS: Rafael Nadal was in black-and-white practice gear, he was leaning on the grayscale, but that was all the vintage the 14-time Roland Garros champion sparked on an afternoon when the sun was in the shade.The 37-year-old’s shots were short of signature crackle and his stride was a mite slow.Nadal enters the Paris Grand Slam following an anemic match schedule courtesy a hip injury that kept him off his beloved terre battue last year for the first time after 18 consecutive appearances. The Spaniard played four matches in 2023 and has logged just four tournaments in 2024.Nadal, bidding to finish a storied career on his terms, at the very least end where he started it on the tennis court, will go up against the fourth-ranked German Alexander Zverev in the first round on Monday.He’ll need to blast off the blocks. So, where exactly is Rafael Nadal, on a competitive scale?He is ranked outside the top-250 at No 276, but that, in this case, is just a number against a name. Not a measure of the legend.Nadal, who arrived in Roland Garros more than a week before the start of the fortnight, said he’s feeling better than he has in a long time on the tennis court.“This is the first week since I come back that I’m able to run the proper way without having a lot of limitations. That has encouraged me,” said Nadal, who arrived for his pre-championship media interaction in an electric blue tee and a smile to match. “That does not mean that I'm going to play incredible on Monday, no?”The 22-time major winner, who has a glittering 112-3 win-loss record here, retraced his romance at this spectacularly stylish venue.“In some ways this place is magical for me,” he said. “So, if, in the bottom of my heart, I don't have any hope to have success here and to create a beautiful thing this year, I will not be here in front of you guys.”That declaration at once lifted the mood in the packed-to-capacity press room. Nobody wants one of the greatest champions this game has seen, one of the fiercest fighters in all sport, limp into the sunset. That would be a travesty.Nadal, who went down to Hubert Hurkacz in the second round in Rome in his last tournament outing, indicated that he’s able to push more physically.“I don't feel the limitations that I felt in Rome in terms of running,” he said. “I’m not thinking in terms of having amazing results here but thinking about giving myself a little bit more room to think about what can happen in the future.”This then, particularly the last three-four months, has got to be Nadal’s weightiest fight, chasing as he is a wafer-thin chance on the slippery slope of hope. Battling age and wrestling for time.“We did things to try to feel better, and we have been working without a stop to keep progressing, to try to arrive here in a proper way,” he said.Each time Nadal threads the needle with his mélange of heavily spun groundies on a practice court, he’s faced with questions.“I didn't play five-set matches since a long time. I haven’t played this level of opponents since a long time,” he said. “All these questions that you ask me, I’m asking to myself too.”Zverev, more than a decade younger than his opponent, is up to speed having claimed his biggest title in two years ago in Rome last weekThe German is looking to finish a match he couldn’t two years ago when he was wheeled off the court in the middle of their sea-saw semifinal with an ankle injury.“I wanted to play Rafa again, because I didn't want the last memory of me playing against Rafa to be me leaving the court on a wheelchair,’ the 27-year-old said. “For me, in my mind, I'm going to play peak Rafa Nadal. I expect him to be at his absolute best. I expect him to play the best tennis he's played in a long time.”Bring out the popcorn, if only because there's hope yet.",Rafael Nadal says he's feeling better than he has in a long time on the tennis court. The Spaniard played four matches in 2023 and has logged just four tournaments in 2024.
