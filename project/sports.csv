He shot an efficient 14-for-24 from the field, including 4-of-8 from beyond the arc, and added eight rebounds and four assists.Head coach JJ Redick , who has always been a vocal admirer of James’ work ethic and longevity, couldn’t hold back his admiration for the legend. Speaking to reporters in a post-game presser, he shared his honest thoughts on the King’s astonishing performance.“He really just defies anything that's normal, and not just the physical feats and the plays—it’s the mentality,” Redick said. “He is—I believe I saw the other day he's a billionaire—and he's playing on the second night of a back-to-back at 40 after 22 years with every record and every accolade.”Redick continued his witty remark, “And the kids will say that I'm glazing him. He's one of the greatest competitors. [Assistant coach] Nate [McMillan] and I were talking before the game—he's amazing to coach. He brings it every single day, he sets the standard for how you're supposed to approach this craft. That’s to me the most incredible thing—the mindset to do it, get up the next day, do it, over and over again.”James’ ability to maintain this level of excellence post-40 has been undeniably top of the word, according to fan analysts. For two decades, he has maintained his stature as a standout star and forged his legacy with a stunning resume to his name.Additionally, James has just added another milestone in his career. By playing his 1,542nd game, he passed Vince Carter to claim third place on the NBA’s all-time games played list. Now, only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1,560) and Robert Parish (1,611) stand ahead of him. The 1 billion-rich athlete (per Forbes) is currently averaging 24.7 points per game, 7.7 rebounds, and 8.9 assists. James also holds the youngest and oldest NBA star to score 40 points in a game.Also Read: Los Angeles Lakers legend LeBron James creates another milestone surpassing Vince Carter A huge part of the Lakers’ success against Portland also came from Austin Reaves in the recent game against the Trail Blazers. Reaves delivered a stellar performance of his own, finishing with 32 points on 9-for-21 shooting.With this victory, the Lakers improved to 33-21 on the season, now sitting firmly in fifth place in the Western Conference.","The Los Angeles Lakers beat the Portland Trail Blazers 121-112 on Thursday night.

Anthony Edwards’ confident exchange with Barack Obama during Team USA event made headlines



Minnesota Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards has made a name for himself as one of the most promising young players in the NBA. The way the rising standout star has been playing his game led many to draw comparisons between Edwards and the legendary Michael Jordan . However, the 23-year-old guard has made it clear that he is not interested in being measured against the greatest player of all time.During All-Star Weekend, Anthony Edwards was asked about adding any of Michael Jordan ’s signature moves into his own game. Ant-Man did not hesitate to refute the comparison. “No moves, man. Shout out to MJ, he the GOAT. I just wish y’all would stop comparing me to him,” he said. Of course, Edwards appreciates the respect that comes with the comparison, but he seems to feel that it adds unnecessary pressure.Edwards has consistently shown that he wants to be recognized for his own unique style of play rather than living in the shadow of NBA legends.This isn’t the first time Edwards has downplayed his place in the sport. Despite being widely regarded as one of the NBA’s next big superstars, he doesn’t see himself as the future face of the league. When recently asked if he envisions himself as the league’s next top player, especially with legends like LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Stephen Curry nearing the end of their careers, his response was refreshingly candid, “No, not really.” Instead, Edwards pointed to San Antonio Spurs rookie sensation Victor Wembanyama, saying, “That’s what they got Wemby for.”He elaborated further in an interview with TNT, “I’m capable of being that guy. But I don’t want to be that guy, I’ll put it like that. I want to be the guy that just show up and hoop and just kill dudes and go home.” Despite being one of the top stars in the league, Edwards has been humble in his approach about the games he played over the years.Edwards' confidence isn’t just limited to his performances on the court. Recently, he made headlines for his bold exchange with former U.S. President Barack Obama during Netflix’s Court of Gold docuseries, which provided a behind-the-scenes look at Team USA’s preparations for the Paris Olympics.In one interesting moment, Obama jokingly asked Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid about Edwards, saying, “What do you think about this young guy? He can hoop a little bit, huh?” Embiid, with a smile, responded, “Just a little bit.” But Edwards, never one to back down, immediately responded with his usual candid manner, “Nah, y’all better stand down. I’m the truth.”Also Read: Jimmy Butler addresses beef with Miami Heat after blockbuster trade to Golden State Warriors: “It didn’t end the way everybody hoped” The 23-year-old Minnesota Timberwolves star player has been one of the best in the league with astonishing stats already added to his name.

Stephen A Smith Talks About “Healthy Hostility” In Hockey And Why Fans Are Hooked To It



Team Canada proved their worth as they finally won the 4 Nations Face Off against Team USA last night. Sidney Crosby , the captain of Team Canada, is being hailed as a hero by fans due to his impressive performance yesterday. But ESPN’s broadcaster Stephen A Smith has brought in a new perspective to how hockey is perceived in the country as compared to the NBA.In a recent video posted by ESPN’s First Take, Stephen A Smith says, “I’m on a plane flying out West from the East coast yesterday okay. And I’m very very lucky to have a lot of televisions on the jet. So I'm sitting up there and I get up, you know gotta stretch, cant just be sitting there for six hours. And I’m going up and down, just walking you know…let the blood circulate. And I’m looking and every single TV had the hockey game on”.Stephen A Smith then goes on to speak about how the game was not the reason why everyone was hooked to their TV screens as his flight flew to the West from the East Coast yesterday. As per him, it was because of the “intensity of the moment”. He also highlighted how newly elected president Donald Trump wished the Team USA before the match began and how Justin Trudeau “clapped back” at Team USA.These events led to a “healthy hostility” between the two teams and the fans of the two teams; something that as per Stephen A Smith is completely missing from the NBA currently and fans are also agreeing with Stephen A Smith’s controversial opinion.A fan wrote, “True! NBA doesn’t have any rivalry nowadays 🤦‍♂️”, while another fan wrote, “The NBA is a league that built itself on personality. That is wonderful… when that had personalities. These guys are boring now. So it suffers”.A third fan wrote, “Hockey honors history, revels legacy, relinquishes self for team . The today NBA cares of self and that’s why they are in state they are in but they don’t care.”NBA players are yet to respond to Stephen A Smith’s controversial comments.Also Read: Oilers' Evander Kane was sued by a woman after he refused to pay $3,000,000 for aborting their child despite previously agreeing to the deal","ESPN broadcaster Stephen A Smith has brought in a new perspective to how hockey is perceived in the country as compared to the NBA.

Mohammad Amir Exclusive: Champions Trophy hopes, India's absence & retirement talk

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Sourav Ganguly believes KL Rahul 's ""fantastic numbers"" in ODIs may have given him the edge over Rishabh Pant as India's first-choice wicketkeeper-batter in the ongoing Champions Trophy.Head coach Gautam Gambhir backed Rahul to take on the wicketkeeping duties for the marquee ICC event, leaving Pant on the sidelines.""India are such a strong side, especially in batting. Pant is very good. But Rahul has fantastic numbers in ODIs. So, I think that's the reason Gautam Gambhir has backed Rahul,"" Ganguly said after he was announced as the brand ambassador of Vura, a construction chemical brand.""There's very little to choose between them (Rahul and Pant) because both are exceptional,"" he added.The former BCCI chief also backed Virat Kohli to overcome his leg-spin woes, while tipping India as favourites to bag the Champions Trophy title.""India have five Shubman Gills from one, two, three, four, five, six -- who can all score hundreds and win matches. When Axar Patel bats at five for India, can you imagine the depth?""Yesterday, India was in a spot of bother, but then they had KL Rahul coming in. They had Ravindra Jadeja, Hardik Pandya... There's batting after batting.""India have a house of talent because of the systems we have and the way we play our cricket.""Kohli once again fell to a leg-spinner but Ganguly was confident that the star batter will overcome this challenge.""The quality of cricketer Virat Kohli is ---I'm sure he will be able to sort this out. He has got 81 international hundreds, and I'm sure he scored runs against leg-spin also. So, it was probably just one of those days when he got out. He has to find a way to play it.""While India and New Zealand are Ganguly's picks from Group A, he said Australia could miss out on the semifinals due to the absence of key players.""New Zealand have beaten Pakistan. So, New Zealand is ahead. If India beat Pakistan, then Pakistan will probably be out of the competition. So, I see India and New Zealand progressing from this group.""""From the other group, I'm a little worried about Australia because there's no (Pat) Cummins, no Mitchell Starc, and no Josh Hazlewood. Their three best fast bowlers are missing.""Between South Africa, England, and Australia -- any two can qualify. You never count Australia out because of their pedigree and the quality of cricket they play. But I won't be surprised if England and South Africa make it.""The 52-year-old, who has a career best 239 in Tests against Pakistan, also remembered his on-field fights against the neighbours.""I've played an entire lifetime of India-Pakistan cricket, starting from the Independence Cup final in 1996. My first series as captain toPakistan in 2004, where India won the Tests and ODIs for the first time in history. So, I have lots of great memories of playing against Pakistan.""I've seen Javed Miandad's six sixes, and I've also seen the transformation of India after that -- how we started dominating Pakistan in every format.""I say that with respect. India have been a far, far superior team. Looking at this Indian team, it's also far, far superior in the last 20 years,"" he said.","Sourav Ganguly believes KL Rahul has the edge over Rishabh Pant as India's first-choice wicketkeeper-batter in the ongoing Champions Trophy.

Chennai Super Kings , the franchise he has led to five IPL titles, has retained Dhoni ahead of the IPL 2025 auction, demonstrating their continued faith in his abilities.While Dhoni retired from international cricket nearly six years ago, he acknowledges that it takes a significant amount of hard work to maintain fitness and readiness for the two-month IPL tournament.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 Points table ""I only play a couple of months in a year, but I want to enjoy it the way I started playing, that's something that keeps me going,"" Dhoni said during an event on Friday.He emphasizes that age is irrelevant in the IPL, and the level of performance expected remains the same regardless of a player's age.""But, of course, for that, I need to put in a lot of hard work for six to eight months because IPL is one of the toughest tournaments. Nobody really cares about how old you are. If you're playing at this level, the level needs to be the same,"" he added.Dhoni's motivation during his international career stemmed from representing his country, especially coming from a state not known for cricket.""When I started playing international cricket, for me the biggest motivation was representing my country,"" he stated.""It has always been the country for me because coming from where I came, not known for cricket as a state, once I got a chance I wanted to contribute, I wanted to be part of a winning team that was trying to win each and every game, you're trying to win the big tournaments, the bilateral series (and) so (on).""For me, my biggest motivation was that contribution to make India win. Now that I've retired from international cricket, I can't say it's the same, but for me now, it's the love for the sport,"" he added.""It's hard work, but for me now, enjoying the game is the key aspect. When I'm out of the field, trying to be the best kind of a person that I can be so that people remember me for (being) the good human being... so that's something that I always had in my life (that) this is what I am in person.""",MS Dhoni has been an integral part of the Indian Premier League IPL since its inception 17 seasons ago.

Will Travis Kelce Retire? Jason Kelce Believes His Brother Already Knows



As the Kansas City Chiefs eagerly await Travis Kelce’s decision on his NFL future, speculation continues to grow about whether the iconic tight end will retire or play another season. His brother, Jason Kelce , believes Travis already knows what he wants to do, even if the public is still in the dark. With a deadline of March 14 set by the Chiefs, fans are left wondering if they have seen the last of Travis Kelce on the football field.Jason Kelce is no stranger to the emotional turmoil of deciding when to walk away from the game. Speaking on The Steam Room podcast with Charles Barkley and Ernie Johnson, Jason revealed that his brother likely already has his heart set on a decision. “I think Travis, I think he probably, in his heart, already knows what he wants to do,” Jason shared. His comments offered a glimpse into the emotional journey Travis might be facing as he approaches the crucial deadline. “That’s the reality of it,” Jason added.This offseason could mark a turning point for Travis Kelce, who is coming off a heartbreaking Super Bowl LIX loss. Despite the setback, his 12-year career with the Chiefs has been nothing short of legendary, with numerous franchise records to his name. Yet, the 35-year-old is now at a crossroads, having to decide whether to chase another title or hang up his cleats.The Chiefs have made it clear that they need an answer by March 14, as the NFL’s free agency period begins on March 10. Travis’s contract runs through the 2025 season, and he is set to receive an $11.5 million roster bonus on March 15 if he chooses to stay. This financial incentive adds another layer to his decision-making process, which he openly discussed on his podcast, New Heights, just days after the Super Bowl loss.“I know everybody wants to know whether or not I'm playing next year, and right now, I'm just kicking everything down the road. I'm not making any crazy decisions,” Travis stated. His focus remains on supporting his teammates and making a wholehearted decision that reflects his commitment to the game.Jason Kelce acknowledged the complexity of his brother's choice, noting the differences in how they approach major life decisions. “We’re similar people, but we also have different ways of thinking about things,” Jason said.

Who is the face of the league? Media and fans on socials often vote for a star to be the face of the league for their stellar performance. However, NBA veterans and analysts Charles Barkley are not ready to digest the new debate as they have given their thoughts on the matter. Barkley went full rant mode to criticize the discussion, saying that it is not fair to elect someone to make the face of the league.It is no secret that the legendary careers of LeBron James and Stephen Curry are nearing the end. With that note, the debate over who will take the mantle as the new face of the NBA has been the talk of the town. While fans and analysts throw out names like Victor Wembanyama in particular, NBA Hall of Famers Charles Barkley and Shaquille O’Neal have made it clear that this title isn’t something that can be handed out, it must be earned. “You Don’t Give Somebody the Face of the League,” Barkley shared.During a recent episode of Inside the NBA, Barkley candidly shared his frustration with discussions about prematurely crowning the league’s next star.“I saw some guys on another network the other day talking about the face of the league, and I was so annoyed just sitting around watching,” Barkley said. “First of all, you don’t give anybody the face of the league, am I right?”Shaq nodded in agreement as Barkley elaborated on his point. He further asserted that past superstars including Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, and Kobe Bryant, or NBA veterans like LeBron James , and Stephen Curry didn’t have the role handed to them. They took it through their dominance on the court and their impact on the game.“I get so annoyed when I hear these guys, like, you don’t give somebody something. That’s one of the problems we got, these idiots won’t play in the All-Star Game. We’ve given them so much, they don’t have no respect for the history. But you don’t give anybody the face of the game, you take it.”Shaquille O’Neal was also quick to weigh in. He shared, “To counter what Chuck is saying, they, whoever they will be, they will try to put somebody as the face of the league, they do that.” Shaq added, “But Chuck makes a great point, you have to go take it. While they’re sitting saying ‘him,’ Ja Morant is thinking something different, Luka is thinking something different… Ant-Man (Anthony Edwards) is thinking something different.”One of the most frequently mentioned candidates for the future face of the NBA is Victor Wembanyama . The 7-foot-4 San Antonio Spurs sensation has been one of the league’s sensations. Before his recent health setback, Wembanyama was averaging an impressive 24.3 points, 11 rebounds, and 3.7 assists per game.Also Read: A blood clot in shoulder marked the end of Victor Wembanyama's remaining 2025 NBA season However, Wembanyama was recently diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his right shoulder, a condition that led to his shutdown for the remainder of the season.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Mohammed Shami: 'I just go for wickets; don't care about the economy rate at all'

Contrary to the predictions about the playing XI in the second match of Group A in the Champions Trophy on February 20, India opted for Harshit Rana as the second specialist pacer instead of Arshdeep Singh against Bangladesh.The move paid off, as Rana's three-wicket spell (3 for 31) proved to be the perfect foil for Mohammed Shami who led the attack with a five-wicket haul (5 for 53), laying the foundation of India's six-wicket win that saw Shubman Gill leading the run-chase with an unbeaten century (101*).However, for the big match against Pakistan next on Sunday, there is still conjecture whether India should add variation to the pace attack with left-armer Arshdeep or go ahead with the winning combination without any tinkering.On top of that, Pakistan will have to get accustomed to a different track, as they played New Zealand in the tournament opener at home in Karachi before flying out to Dubai for the game against India.The defending champions will undoubtedly be under pressure after their 60-run defeat in the first match against the Kiwis, which puts them in a virtually must-win situation against the archrivals.However, former India leg-spinner Piyush Chawla believes captain Rohit Sharma and head coach Gautam Gambhir may not want to disturb a winning combination going into the Pakistan game.""I had said before the first match that Arshdeep should be there (in the playing XI) because being a left-arm seamer he brings in those (different) angles and can swing the ball. Plus he is such a bowler who can bowl with the new ball as well as can get you wickets in the slog overs,"" said Chawla while talking on Star Sports.""But after the kind of spell Harshit bowled against Bangladesh, I don't think you will see any changes here (in India's playing XI against Pakistan). Same team will play because you would want to continue with the winning combination and not make any changes.""India are currently second in Group A, behind New Zealand on net run-rate (NRR). Both Bangladesh and Pakistan are without any points, but the former is ahead of the hosts at No. 3 with better NRR.Top two teams from each group in the eight-team competition will qualify for the semifinals.",Harshit Rana's three-wicket spell against Bangladesh proved to be the perfect foil for Mohammed Shami.

NEW DELHI: When former cricketer Atul Wassan announced that he wants Pakistan to defeat India in Sunday's Champions Trophy match in Dubai, it caught everyone off guard.Pakistan will take on fierce opponents India in the duel of the heavyweights in an attempt to maintain their championship defense. After losing to New Zealand by 60 runs in the opening match of the competition, Pakistan ended up in this situation.The Men in Green would require a lot of different combinations to work in their favor and sustain their campaign if they lose against India on Sunday. Wassan thinks that if Pakistan wins the crucial match, the competition will become much more thrilling.""I want Pakistan to win because it will be fun, tournament-wise. If you don't let Pakistan win, then what will you do? If Pakistan wins, then it becomes a contest. There should be an equal fight,"" Wassan told ANI.Wassan praised India's batting depth in the starting line-up while analyzing their team for the current Champions Trophy. He believed that India was the greatest squad and supported their plan to launch a spin-heavy attack in Dubai given the circumstances.""You have a lot of good batters: Shubman (Gill), Rohit (Sharma), Virat (Kohli). You are batting until number eight in Axar Patel. Rohit has picked five spinners, and this team is best for Dubai. Have faith in what you have and move ahead,"" he added.India glided to a facile six-wicket victory against Bangladesh to open their account, while Pakistan started the campaign on a losing note.However, Wassan voiced his displeasure at Rishabh Pant 's exclusion from India's starting XI in favor of KL Rahul . Wassan believes that Pant makes the opposition uneasy, something Rahul cannot do.Head coach Gautam Gambhir 's preference for Rahul over Pant did not impress Wassan. He claims that the ""mercurial"" player has been let down by the Indian management, which could have long-term consequences for him.""Gautam Gambhir is picking his own team. I am just very upset that Rishabh Pant is not playing. I don't know why. He's a mercurial player who makes the other team nervous. They feel that he will single-handedly win the match. KL Rahul is a very good player but does not attract such fear from the opposition. You let Rishabh Pant down. If you let a good player enter this situation that he won't play, the hero in him becomes zero,"" Wassan said.","Former cricketer Atul Wassan wants Pakistan to defeat India in Sunday's Champions Trophy match in Dubai.

NEW DELHI: India's newly crowned world No.1 ODI batter, Shubman Gill , lived up to his billing with a magnificent century, steering India to a six-wicket victory over Bangladesh in their ICC Champions Trophy 2025 opener. His composed knock, his second consecutive ODI ton, reinforced his dominance in white-ball cricket and drew high praise from former Australian captain Ricky Ponting Speaking on The ICC Review, Ponting hailed the 25-year-old's rise to the top of the rankings, calling it a reflection of his class and consistency.""He thoroughly deserves to be the number one ranked batter in the world at the moment,"" Ponting said. ""It's a great sign for India that he's got his account underway early in the first game of a Champions Trophy.""While Gill has yet to make a significant mark in Test cricket, Ponting stressed that ODIs and T20s are perfectly suited to his style.""He's been a very, very good international player for a number of years,"" Ponting noted. ""He hasn't sort of transferred that over into Test Match cricket yet, but his white-ball cricket over the last three or four years has been outstanding. Look, he's a big-game player as well. He's played really well in IPLs over the last couple of years, obviously being captain of his franchise there.""Ponting particularly praised Gill's ability to score freely in ODIs, especially against fast bowling.""He can come out and be nice and aggressive early in the power play with the field up, get some boundaries away early by playing good, naturally aggressive cricketing shots,"" Ponting explained. ""He's not a big hitter, he doesn't try to do anything outside of his natural game, but he scores boundaries almost at will against fast bowling.""Beyond his batting prowess, Ponting also sees leadership potential in Gill.""He just seems like a really nice character, very driven for what he wants to achieve in the game,"" Ponting said. ""We've had a chance to catch up over the last couple of years, particularly around the IPL season. I just like his demeanor. He seems like a very driven guy that wants to be the best he possibly can with batting and also in leadership.""Gill's eighth ODI century, helping India chase down 229 against Bangladesh on a tricky pitch in Dubai, further solidified his reputation as India's premier white-ball batter.","Ricky Ponting hails India's world No.1 ODI batter, Shubman Gill.

England XI:

NEW DELHI: An off-colour England and injury-hit Australia will be keen to get off to a strong start in the Champions Trophy campaign when the Ashes rivals face-off in Lahore on Saturday in what appears to be an evenly matched Group B match.In the last two rubbers, world champion Australia has lost to Pakistan (1-2) and Sri Lanka (0-2) as both sides have struggled in the ODI format.Since their catastrophic 2023 World Cup campaign, England, who are currently coached by Brendon McCullum in all forms, have failed to win an ODI series.Also See: India vs Pakistan Head to Head Records The Jos Buttler-led team just suffered a 0-3 loss against India, as they looked unprepared and were unable to compete with the home team.Both teams will be eager to make their mark in this ICC showpiece event.Australia won a five-match series 3-2 in September of last year, giving them the advantage over their Ashes opponents the previous time they played in England.But a lot has changed since then, as the world champions now without five important members of their original squad.Their renowned trio of Pat Cummins , Josh Hazlewood, and Mitchell Starc will not be playing in the event, which will have a significant impact on their pace assault.Additionally, they will be without all-rounders Marcus Stoinis, who made an unexpected retirement from the format after being included in the tournament's original lineup, Mitchell Marsh (back injury), and Cameron Green (injury).In this situation, it is unclear if Australia, led by interim captain Steve Smith , would be able to repeat their previous achievements in what is sometimes called a 'mini' World Cup.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 Points table Smith will probably start at No. 3 in Marsh's absence and shoulder the batting load for a team that won this event back-to-back in 2006 and 2009.Travis Head, the aggressive white-ball opener, will be the center of attention. In their 2022 series, he scored 101 and 89 runs at this very venue.Head is a serious threat after smashing a career-best 154 not out against England at Trent Bridge during the previous year's series.England has suggested a three-pronged pace attack with Adil Rashid's spin to complement Jofra Archer , Mark Wood, and Brydon Carse as a potential counter-strategy.""They're pretty much all-out fast bowling with Adil (Rashid, the leg-spinner) being their banker - he's high quality, and doesn't go underrated in this room - but there's so much excitement around Wood, Jofra, Carse and (Gus) Atkinson,"" head told 'cricket.com.au'.""We're going to have to make sure we start well against them. As an opening batter, how I can counteract that and how I play against that is a great challenge.""Jamie Smith, a rising wicketkeeper-batter for England, is also included. He is probably going to bat at number three.Ben Duckett, who looked in explosive form against India, will try to provide a solid start, while Joe Root will be the batting backbone, as the wicket is predicted to favor batting.Root, who finished the India series as England's second-leading run scorer after Duckett, will try to have a big influence.England, who are vying for their first Champions Trophy, are avoiding thinking about their previous setbacks in India.""Regardless of what happened in India, we've got that belief that we've got the talent, we've got the world-class players, the match-winners in the squad to win the tournament,"" Rashid said.Steve Smith (Capt.), Sean Abbott, Alex Carey, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Aaron Hardie, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Spencer Johnson, Marnus Labuschagne, Glenn Maxwell, Tanveer Sangha, Matthew Short, Adam Zampa.

DUBAI: Cricketing powerhouses India and Pakistan renew their storied if rare rivalry in the most hotly-anticipated match of the 2025 Champions Trophy in Dubai on Sunday.A look at six memorable ODI matches between the bitter rivals ahead of their latest clash:Javed Miandad's last-ball six at the desert venue arguably remains the most dramatic ODI outcome between the two sides as Pakistan clinched a one-wicket victory.Pakistan needed 246 to win in 50 overs and Miandad walked in at 61-3 to hit an unbeaten 116 off 114 balls.With four needed off the final delivery, Indian fast bowler Chetan Sharma bowled a full toss and Miandad blasted the ball into the crowd to trigger wild celebrations among the Pakistan team and fans.Miandad was later presented with a golden sword for his heroics.Imran Khan's best bowling figures of 6-14 were in a one-day international against India but for the flamboyant Pakistan fast bowler it was all in vain.Imran ripped through the Indian batting line-up at Sharjah to send the opposition packing for 125.But Pakistan's own batting imploded, skittled for just 87 with Ramiz Raja, top-scorer with 29, one of only four batsmen in double figures.India's Ajay Jadeja blasted a 25-ball 45 in a late blitz that helped India knock out holders Pakistan in a highly-charged World Cup quarter-final.Jadeja was severe on Pakistan's Waqar Younis as he hit the pace bowler for four fours and two sixes in the final few overs to propel the total to 287-8.In reply, Pakistan were sailing along when opener Aamir Sohail smashed India's Venkatesh Prasad for a boundary before sledging his opponent.But Venkatesh got the left-handed batsman bowled on the next ball to bring the house down and Pakistan lost their way to lose by 39 runs.Sourav Ganguly hit a match-winning century to trump Saeed Anwar's 140 in a deciding best-of-three final of Bangladesh's Silver Jubilee Independence Cup in Dhaka.Ganguly's knock of 124 was laced with 11 fours and one six as India chased down their victory target of 315 with one ball to spare.The left-handed Ganguly was named man of the match but lesser-known Hrishikesh Kanitkar stole the show in the end when India needed three on the final two balls and he hit a boundary on the penultimate delivery.The chase was a world record at the time. Sachin Tendulkar won many matches for India but his 98 against Pakistan at the 2003 World Cup remains special due his duel with fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar Tendulkar stood tall in his 75-ball knock that guided India in their chase of 274 against a Pakistan bowling line-up boasting Wasim Akram, Waqar and Akhtar.He uppercut one of Akhtar's express deliveries to a delightful six over third man - a shot that became iconic in Tendulkar's career.Akhtar later got Tendulkar's wicket but the damage had been done and India won by six wickets.Pakistan came in as underdogs in the Champions Trophy final, but stunned India by 180 runs, riding on a sparkling century by Fakhar Zaman.Zaman's 114 off 106 balls and a 128-run opening stand with Azhar Ali guided Pakistan to a mammoth 338 for four and deflated Virat Kohli 's India at The Oval.The left-hander clobbered the Indian attack, including fast bowlers Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah , hitting 12 fours and three sixes.Pakistan's bowlers then came out firing and dismissed India for just 158 in 30.3 overs despite Hardik Pandya 's 76. Fast bowler Hasan Ali took 3-19.",India and Pakistan renew their storied if rare rivalry in the 2025 Champions Trophy in Dubai on Sunday.
