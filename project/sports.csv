Fritz upset by curfew

On the hottest day in Wimbledon 's history, defending champion Carlos Alcaraz survived a major scare at the hands of 38-year-old Fabio Fognini. It was also a day of numerous seeds falling and history being created by British players.Temperatures at the All England Club topped 32 degrees Celsius (89.6 Fahrenheit), surpassing the previous record of 29.3 Celsius set in 2001.Amid such conditions, Spain's Alcaraz had to dig deep for a 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 7-5, 2-6, 6-1 win over Italy's retiring Fognini in a gruelling clash that lasted four hours and 37 minutes on Centre Court.It was only the first time since Roger Federer narrowly beat Alejandro Falla in 2010 that a defending champion had been taken to a fifth set in the Wimbledon first round.During the match, the 22-year-old Alcaraz rushed to help a spectator who had collapsed in the stands, handing over a bottle of water as medics came to the woman's aid.At the end of the match, Alcaraz pointed to Fognini in appreciation of the Italian's effort. Fognini later revealed his son Federico, an Alcaraz fan, was banned from speaking to the five-time major champion - leaving the youngster angry. To make up for it, Fognini asked Alcaraz for his shirt after the match as a gift for his son.Top women's seed Aryna Sabalenka used ice packs to stay cool during her 6-1, 7-5 win over Canadian qualifier Carson Branstine on Court One.The 27-year-old Belarusian, a three-time Grand Slam champion, has experienced tough three-set defeats in this year's Australian Open and French Open finals.Despite her success, she has never advanced beyond the Wimbledon semi-finals and missed last year's tournament due to a shoulder injury.“I felt really great. I'm super grateful to be healthy, ready to compete, and to have gotten through the first round,” Sabalenka said. Next, she will face Czech player Marie Bouzkova, ranked 48th in the world.As for Branstine, a professional model who funds her tennis by posing for the camera, it was a challenging day out in the sun as well. She needed six hair ties, hairspray for the bun and it still wasn't enough. Absence of a scrunchie didn't help either.Two-time Wimbledon finalist Ons Jabeur was visibly upset and tears streamed down her face as she withdrew from her first-round match against Viktoriya Tomova.The Tunisian player was behind 7-6 (7/5), 2-0 when she decided to withdraw against the Bulgarian, who is ranked 111th in the world.Meanwhile, Daniil Medvedev, a former US Open champion and a semi-finalist at Wimbledon for the past two years, experienced a meltdown during his match against France's Benjamin Bonzi.Bonzi won 7-6 (7/2), 3-6, 7-6 (7/3), 6-2 after three hours and seven minutes. An angry Medvedev smashed his racket against his chair at the conclusion of the match.In other results, Holger Rune lost after squandering a two-set lead, falling to Chile’s Nicolas Jarry. Former finalist Matteo Berrettini was also knocked out, and Stefanos Tsitsipas retired due to injury.Additionally, former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko was defeated by Britain’s Sonay Kartal in three sets, 7-5, 2-6, 6-2.In all, 10 seeds fell on the opening day - seven among men (Medvedev, Rune, Berrettini, Tsitsipas, Tallon Griekspoor, Alexei Popyrin, Francisco Cerundolo) and three among women (Paula Badosa, Ostapenko, McCartney Kessler)For British tennis, it had already been a record-breaking Wimbledon before the gates even opened at SW19. Twenty-three British players entered the singles draws - the highest since 1984. And not since 1976 have there been 14 Britons in action on Day 1 of Wimbledon.By the time day one concluded, well semi-concluded due to the 11pm curfew, seven (Emma Raducanu, Katie Boulter, Sonay Kartal, Cameron Norrie, Billy Harris, Arthur Fery and Oliver Tarvet) had progressed to the second round - the most in a single day in the Open Era. The list includes Tarvet and Fery, ranked 733 and 461 in the world, respectively. The 21-year-old Tarvet pocketed £99,000 for his first round win, except he can't make more than £7,290 a year due to the financial rules.“But I’m not here for the money,” he said after joking he'd hire a private jet to fly to the US where he's a college student. “I’m here just for the experience and to stamp my mark on the ATP circuit. And I think I’ve done a good job so far.”American No. 1 Taylor Fritz expressed frustration, saying, “I couldn’t do anything,” after making a dramatic comeback on No. 1 Court on Monday night.In his first-round match against Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, Fritz led in points and committed fewer errors after two sets. However, he found himself two sets down, losing two tiebreaks to the Frenchman, who has one of the biggest serves in the sport—larger than Fritz’s.Despite the odds, Fritz fought back to win the next two sets, including a dramatic fourth-set tiebreak. Trailing 5-1 and two points from defeat, he rallied to win. Jubilantly, he pumped his chest toward his box, yelled “let’s f—ing go,” and sat down, riding the momentum toward what he believed would be a victorious finis. Or so he thought.However, after a lengthy discussion with a tournament official, play was halted due to Wimbledon’s curfew, set at 11pm local time — even though it was only 10:18 pm when the match was paused. “Then don’t ask me,” Fritz said as he packed up his rackets and sat back in his chair, telling his box he “couldn’t do anything.”The All England Club confirmed that the match was suspended because of the curfew, which was 42 minutes away at the time. Remarkably, the previous four sets between Fritz and Perricard lasted 44, 48, 33, and 45 minutes, respectively, meaning only one of those sets could have been completed within the remaining time.","Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz survived a major scare at the hands of Fabio Fognini. Temperatures at the All England Club topped 32 degrees Celsius (89.6 Fahrenheit), surpassing the previous record of 29.3 Celsius set in 2001. Top women's seed Aryna Sabalenka used ice packs to stay cool during her 6-1, 7-5 win over Canadian qualifier Carson Branstine.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122173001,imgsize-103,width-400,resizemode-4/122173001.jpg"

Candace Parker's legacy reached new heights on Sunday night as the Los Angeles Sparks raised her iconic No. 3 jersey to the rafters at Crypto.com Arena. The halftime ceremony took place during a game against the Chicago Sky. It was a significant chapter in WNBA history. While Angel Reese powered the Sky to a 92-85 win over the Sparks, the true spotlight was on Parker as she was being immortalized by the team she led for 13 seasons. Los Angeles Lakers veteran LeBron James and Hall of Famer Magic Johnson shared their heartfelt messages for the former Sparks superstar.Candace Parker’s jersey retirement made her just the third player in Sparks history to receive the honor, joining Lisa Leslie and Penny Toler. Thousands filled the arena to celebrate her decorated career. Tributes poured in from basketball royalty. LeBron James, the NBA’s all-time scoring leader, took to Instagram to share a brief but powerful reaction to the moment, posting a video of the ceremony with the caption, “🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽”.Magic Johnson, Los Angeles Lakers icon and Sparks co-owner, offered a far more extensive tribute. Taking to X , Johnson wrote: “Candace Parker has left an indelible mark on the Los Angeles Sparks, not only as one of the greatest players to ever grace the court, but as a true ambassador of our franchise and women’s basketball as a whole.”The NBA legend continued, “Beginning with her arrival to the City of Angels in 2008, she not only lived up to the expectations placed on her as a two-time Gatorade Basketball Player of the Year and NCAA National Champion, she far exceeded them. Her unparalleled skill, relentless drive, and leadership elevated the Sparks to new heights and set a new standard of greatness. Candace is the best all-around player that has ever played in the WNBA. ”Johnson went on to add, “Her legacy is immeasurable — she redefined excellence, was a champion on the court and for the Los Angeles community and inspired countless fans and future generations of athletes. Very few champions get to see their jersey hanging from the rafters in this city. Retiring Candace’s No. 3 jersey is not just a celebration of her extraordinary career, but a tribute to the enduring mark she's left on this organization, the WNBA, and the city of Los Angeles. She will forever be a part of the Sparks family.”The tribute didn’t end there. WNBA Hall of Famer Lisa Leslie, who handed the franchise’s leadership to Parker in 2008, praised her successor with heartfelt emotion. “She changed the game. When I handed the keys over to Candace Parker, I knew the Sparks were in good hands,” Leslie said. “Nobody else can do what she’s done for the LA Sparks.”Parker, now a three-time WNBA champion, two-time MVP, and the league’s only player to win a title with three different teams, stood at center court with her family. Reflecting on her journey, she said, “It’s super important to see this jersey in the rafters before any others because my 13 years here were super special. It was ups, downs, wins, losses, heartaches and rewards, but it’s super special to share that with my teammates and coaches with an organization that bet on me with the first pick in the 2008 WNBA Draft. That was a long time ago.”Also Read: Dorian Finney-Smith opts out of Los Angeles Lakers deal, Houston Rockets emerge as serious free agency suitor Candace Parker’s No. 3 jersey will now live forever in Sparks history, as the team honored the legend in her post-WNBA life.

Standing 6'4"" and playing both forward and center, Parker’s versatility and dominance on the court are evident in her career averages: 16.0 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 4.0 assists per game over 410 appearances. She boasts a field goal percentage of 47.9%, a solid 24.4 PER (Player Efficiency Rating), and a win share of 64.3, underlining her efficiency and impact on both ends of the floor.As for Candace Parker's personal life, she and Anna Petrakova share a love story that blossomed through basketball. The two first crossed paths in 2012 while playing for UMMC Ekaterinburg, a Russian team where Parker was already a key player. Petrakova joined that season, and the pair quickly formed a strong bond that began as teammates and grew into something more.By early 2019, Parker proposed, and they quietly married in December that same year. They chose to keep their relationship private, only sharing the news two years later— along with the exciting reveal that they were expecting a baby.","Candace Parker's iconic No. 3 jersey was retired by the Los Angeles Sparks on Sunday night.

However, there is speculation that suggests thecould reunite Anthony Davis with this familiar face and his former 40-year-old teammate.According to Bleacher Report’s Greg Swartz, the Mavericks have a realistic path to acquiring James this summer without dismantling their core.Swartz outlines a potential deal where Dallas sends a package of role players and a future draft pick to Los Angeles:- Players Dallas could trade:- Daniel Gafford- P.J. Washington- Naji Marshall- Caleb Martin- Compensation:- Unprotected 2029 first-round pick""Financially, this trade can work for Dallas without having to give up any of their core players,"" Swartz noted. "" The Lakers could really use this influx of frontcourt talent to complement Doncic and Austin Reaves."" (H/t: Sporting News)- Reunites Davis and James, who won a title together in 2020.- Adds championship experience alongside rising star Cooper Flagg.- Keeps the team in title contention after their 2024 Finals run.- Gains younger, versatile pieces to build around Doncic.- Secures future draft capital.- Moves an aging star while maintaining competitiveness.

A move to Dallas would allow James to play under Kidd—his former Lakers assistant—while joining forces with Davis, Kyrie Irving, and Flagg.While the trade is feasible, concerns remain:- Age and injuries: James is 40, and Davis has struggled with durability.- Chemistry: Integrating multiple stars isn’t always seamless.Still, Swartz believes the Mavericks offer an appealing setup: ""What makes Dallas a more desirable spot for James is the addition of Flagg, who raises this team's ceiling immensely.""A LeBron-to-Dallas trade would be a dramatic twist, but it aligns with both teams’ goals.

Here’s what actually happened, based on the latest credible reporting.On July 1, 2025, the Milwaukee Bucks made two headline-grabbing moves: they waived Damian Lillard—stretching the $113 million left on his contract—and signed free agent center Myles Turner to a four-year, $107 million deal. Lillard, who suffered a torn Achilles in the playoffs, was expected to miss most or all of the upcoming season, prompting Milwaukee to aggressively reshape the roster around Giannis.Despite viral claims, Giannis Antetokounmpo did not post a goodbye message to Damian Lillard or the Milwaukee Bucks. Instead, his only public reaction was a cryptic social media post expressing confusion about the team’s direction. According to multiple reports, Giannis posted, “I don't know what's going on right now,” shortly before news of Lillard’s waiving broke.This message was interpreted as surprise and perhaps frustration, but it was not a farewell or an indication that he was leaving Milwaukee.NBA insider Chris Haynes, who is well-connected with both Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo, reported that Giannis was “not pleased” with the Bucks’ decision to waive Damian Lillard. However, Haynes clarified that Giannis’ displeasure was more about the coldness and manner of the move rather than a desire to leave the team himself. Haynes stated, “He just didn’t appreciate how it was handled,” and noted that Giannis is now reassessing his future but has not made any public demands or posted a goodbye.The rumor of a “goodbye post” appears to have originated from misinterpretations and the emotional tone of Giannis Antetokounmpo’s actual post. The Milwaukee Bucks’ decision to waive Lillard—who was brought in as Giannis’ co-star in a blockbuster 2023 trade—sparked immediate speculation about whether Giannis would follow him out the door. However, there is no evidence that Giannis has requested a trade or is preparing to leave Milwaukee at this time.Milwaukee’s front office made the move to create cap flexibility and keep the team competitive during Giannis Antetokounmpo’s prime years, especially with Damian Lillard likely sidelined for the season. ESPN’s Shams Charania reported that Giannis was on board with the acquisition of Myles Turner, and both players valued the opportunity to partner on the court. Still, the abrupt release of Lillard has added uncertainty about Giannis’ long-term commitment, with insiders noting this is “one more thing added to the equation” as he considers his future.Giannis Antetokounmpo has not shared a goodbye post following the news of Damian Lillard being waived. In fact, his only public reaction has been a cryptic message expressing confusion rather than a farewell.According to NBA insiders, Giannis is indeed frustrated by the situation, but his displeasure is directed at the process itself, not the Milwaukee Bucks organization as a whole. There are no public signs suggesting that Giannis is seeking a trade or planning to leave Milwaukee at this time.Also read: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Becomes NBA’s Highest-Paid Player with $285M Thunder Extension After Historic MVP Season As the Milwaukee Bucks prepare to move forward with a revamped roster, all attention remains on Giannis, whose next move will be pivotal in determining the franchise’s future.

He leaves Toronto with 741 points in 750 games, ranking among the top scorers in team history.

Ayesha Curry reflects on media exposure and Red Table Talk with Jada Pinkett Smith, regret



undefined

In a candid new conversation with Insider, Ayesha Curry , author, entrepreneur, and wife of NBA superstar Stephen Curry, opened up about her growing discomfort with the spotlight. It was a reflection shaped by years of public scrutiny. She particularly expressed regret over her 2019 appearance on Jada Pinkett Smith ’s Red Table Talk, which she says misrepresented her and ultimately shifted her view of fame, privacy, and the public’s expectations of celebrity families.Ayesha Curry’s journey into public life began organically, as her husband’s NBA career skyrocketed with the Golden State Warriors. She was a frequent guest on talk shows, celebrated for her relatable charm and culinary ventures. But behind the public appearances was a growing internal conflict. It became more evident after she appeared in the Red Table Talk interview with Jada Pinkett Smith in May 2019.During that appearance, Ayesha spoke frankly about her insecurities as the wife of a high-profile athlete and how she navigated the attention Steph Curry received from other women.“Stephen is very nice by nature. And he’s very talkative. … Obviously, you know, the devil is a liar.The ladies will always be lurking, hoping for their moment and waiting. You need to be aware of that,” she said on the show. “I honestly hate it. … We had the conversation about it, and he tries really, really hard if we’re going somewhere, he’s introduced me. I don’t like to have to introduce myself.”Looking back, Ayesha told Business Insider in 2023 that she was blindsided by how the interview was edited. “It’s not what I said, and the context was weird,” she explained. “Yeah. I took that one personally.” According to her, the episode portrayed her in a way that didn’t reflect the truth of what she shared.“When the social media thing started, nobody knew what that was going to become,” she said. “If we had known back in the day just how chaotic it would make life, I don’t think we would’ve done it.”Following backlash from her Red Table Talk appearance, Ayesha addressed critics through an emotional Instagram post on May 8, 2019. “I have never been one to cage my feelings and emotions to any capacity. I am human,” she wrote. “It brings me pure joy to speak my mind, be vulnerable at times and to know myself inside and out.”Recognizing that it was Mental Health Awareness Month, she added, “I really want to take the time to encourage everyone to speak their truth regardless of perception, fitting into a mold or offending someone, because it’s YOUR truth. And that’s okay!”Despite her issues with the editing, she still expressed gratitude toward Jada Pinkett Smith: “There is so much more depth to the talk and our family is grateful to @jadapinkettsmith for giving us the opportunity to bond together.”Also Read: Julie Vanloo gets heartbreaking news from Golden State Valkyries right after international flight touches down Years passed by, and Ayesha has long since gotten over that huge public scrutiny.

Joe Burrow shoulders blame as Trey Hendrickson’s contract standoff puts Bengals ’ 2025 season at risk

$28M offer falls short as Hendrickson holdout threatens Bengals’ 2025 hopes



Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow is reportedly blaming himself—not the team—for the unresolved contract situation with star pass-rusher Trey Hendrickson. As Hendrickson’s holdout continues, Burrow’s reaction highlights leadership, but also underscores the growing pressure on the franchise ahead of the 2025 NFL season.According to ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler, Joe Burrow isn’t pointing fingers at the Bengals’ front office for failing to secure Hendrickson’s extension. Instead, he’s internalizing the issue, believing it’s on him to lead the team through the distraction.“He puts it all on his shoulders and says, ‘Hey, we have to get this done. I’m the quarterback of this franchise,’” Fowler reported.While that mindset is admirable, Burrow doesn’t control contract negotiations. The Bengals have reportedly offered Hendrickson a deal worth $28 million per year. But considering Hendrickson has recorded more sacks than any edge rusher in the NFL over the past two seasons, that offer may not reflect his true market value.According to Over the Cap, a $28 million annual salary would rank Hendrickson eighth among edge rushers, trailing players like T.J. Watt and Myles Garrett, even though Hendrickson has outperformed many of them recently.His camp is pushing for a top-five salary, and rightly so, given his consistent impact on the Bengals' defense.Fowler added that Hendrickson remains firmly committed to his stance and is prepared to miss games if a new deal isn’t reached. For a Bengals team aiming to rebound in the AFC and make a deep playoff run, losing their top defensive player could be a massive blow.Burrow’s willingness to take the blame shows leadership, but it doesn’t change the reality. The Bengals must resolve this holdout before it disrupts team chemistry and derails their 2025 campaign.Also Read: Jim Kelly ranked top 15 Super Bowl era QB: Ahead of Lamar Jackson, Bart Starr, and Warren Moon If the Bengals want to remain competitive in 2025, securing Trey Hendrickson with a fair-market deal is critical.

Gary Bettman on possible NHL expansion, the growth of hockey in the US & more | The Pat McAfee Show

As the 2025–26 NHL season was about to begin, Gary Bettman spoke about the progress of the league on “The Pat McAfee Show” in a candid manner. From international tournaments to franchise strength, Bettman went through hockey's growing momentum with a wide-angle view. The conversation went more into the off-ice decisions and global engagement that are now designing the future of professional hockey, rather than staying on scores and standings.In his talk, Gary Bettman emphasized that the NHL is growing in the international sphere. With the 4 Nations Face-Off happening recently and the Milano Cortina 2026 Olympics around the corner, it probably makes him proud that the players are so invested in representing their countries. Moreover, endless international events bring fan engagement to all corners of the globe, but Bettman pointed out that international athletes feel an onslaught of passion from within, never seeing traffic of such magnitude ever crossing their career path.Switching gears, Bettman praised the Florida Panthers for their back-to-back Stanley Cup wins, from their strong ownership, commitment, and dedication from the players.He said that if a team provides the right culture and resources, talent is attracted to it and remains long-term competitive. This is the big difference, he said, between sustainable teams in this league.Expansion talk led to some light-hearted banter as the proud Indianapolis native suggested his city as a potential future team location. Nearly eight cities have shown interest, Bettman affirmed, but the NHL is not pursuing expansion currently. The anticipated strength and stability of its 32 teams are utmost in focus right now, he said, hailing them as the healthiest and most engaged the league has ever seen.Reflecting on the wrapping interview, Bettman said about the 2025 NHL Draft that it was a memorable event: the emotional moments and stars from top draft pick Matthew Schaefer’s reaction to the involvement of celebrities all came together to make it a significant night for our sport, in his words.Also Read: Evander Kane returns to Vancouver Canucks: The hometown dream tarnished with a sudden incident The thoughts from Bettman reveal a league with flux in its native North America and an increased period of extension in global stature.

“Fans are not used to having this weather,”

“Sitting five hours in the sun without moving can be really hard.”

An unexpected event happened during Carlos Alcaraz’s thrilling first-round match at Wimbledon 2025. The crowd was focused on the tennis, but suddenly, all eyes turned to a fan in trouble.

Jimmy Butler’s journey from homeless teen to NBA stardom

Jimmy Butler started from absolute scratch in building a life that gave him a name, fame, and a game — literally. Life had been tough for him from the start. He never even knew who his father was, as he had walked away when Butler was still an infant. Then, at just 13, his mother threw him out of the house. With no home or money, Butler kept himself going with the help of friends and made it to the NBA through sheer hard work, grit, and determination.In an old interview with ESPN, Butler expressed his dislike for being pitied over his tough childhood. “There's nothing to feel sorry about. I love what happened to me. It made me who I am. I'm grateful for the challenges I've faced. Please, don't make them feel sorry for me.”Butler has every right to the respect he’s earned for surviving his teenage years by moving from one friend’s house to another. “I don’t like the look of you. You gotta go,” his mother had said while throwing him out when he was just 13.Among the friends who helped him was Jordan Leslie, who later became an NFL player. Leslie’s mother welcomed Butler into their big family of six-seven children and let him stay with them for a few months — on one condition: he had to follow the same rules as her own kids.Butler once revealed that he couldn’t believe her graciousness, especially after how his own parents had treated him. Michelle Lambert, Leslie’s mother, told ESPN, “I told him my kids looked up to him. He had to stay out of trouble, work hard in school, and set an example. And you know what? Jimmy did it. Anything I asked him to do, he did it without asking questions.”After managing to get through high school, it was Butler’s basketball talent that paved the way forward. He eventually earned an athletic scholarship to Marquette University, where he represented the college team and was named to the All-Big East Honorable Mention list twice during his second and third years.Despite everything, Butler has said he loves his parents and occasionally meets them, holding no hard feelings.Also Read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors predicted to land $20 million Boston Celtics center to support Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler and improve title odds He is now a father to a daughter and two sons with his ex-girlfriend, Kaitlin Nowak.

Regardless, his rags-to-riches story remains one of the most inspiring examples of someone who truly rose from the ashes.","Butler's mother threw him out of the house when he was just 13 years old.

Former Brooklyn Nets star Trendon Watford joins the Philadelphia 76ers for upcoming NBA season

The Brooklyn Nets alum Trendon Watford ended his free agency after joining hands with the Philadelphia 76ers for the upcoming NBA season. After the recent draft sessions, the NBA teams are making the most of the postseason by drafting athletes for the upcoming season. As soon as the free agency started, the Philadelphia 76ers reached out to Trendon Watford with a 45.3 million deal for two years, before even the Brooklyn Nets could think of retaining their former athletes.According to ESPN’s senior NBA writer Shams Charania, forward Trendon Watford was roped in by the Philadelphia 76ers for the next two seasons. The former Brooklyn Nets star ended his free agency recently and is gearing up to play a crucial role in the next NBA season for the Philadelphia 76ers. After representing the Brooklyn Nets for two seasons, Watford entered free agency.During his exit from the Nets back in April, Trendon Watford pointed out his priorities in the NBA fraternity. The talented basketball athlete clearly spoke about what he actually deserves and expectations from free agency. During a press conference, he said,""Obviously, you want to get what you feel like you deserve. Just having a consistent role these past two years, I think I've been able to show not only my organization but other organizations, putting my name out there and earning respect for my name.”Watford further mentioned""I think I've been able to do that with the opportunity that I've been given here. I think this is my second time coming around free agency. I know how it goes, and I know it's a business, but I enjoyed this. I enjoyed the group, and I enjoy being here. I know we gotta have some talks or whatever coming up soon. But, I enjoy being here. I like what we got going on.""Trendon Watford wrapped up the 2024-25 season averaging 10.2 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game, shooting 46.9% from the field and 33% from beyond the arc. After a steady 2023-24 showing with Brooklyn, his role expanded under new head coach Jordi Fernandez, who utilized Watford’s ball-handling skills at the power forward spot more effectively, leading to a noticeable jump in his impact.Also Read: “Wants me to F**king retire”- LeBron James leaked chat with former teammate reveals the true reason behind his future NBA retirement","Former Brooklyn Nets star Trendon Watford joins the Philadelphia 76ers for upcoming NBA season.

Amid the blistering heat of Wimbledon 's hottest opening day in history, it wasn't just the tennis that stole the show - but a moment of genuine compassion from defending champion Carlos Alcaraz that left a lasting impression.Temperatures soared to a sweltering 33°C (91°F) on Monday, marking the hottest Day 1 since the tournament began 148 years ago. Organizers scrambled to keep spectators safe with added water stations, shaded areas, and staff equipped with refillable bottles. Still, the oppressive heat proved too much for some.Midway through a dramatic five-setter against veteran Fabio Fognini on Centre Court, Alcaraz noticed an elderly fan in distress. Without hesitation, he halted play and pointed out the incident to officials. He handed a water bottle into the stands as medical personnel arrived, delaying the match for over 15 minutes.Later that evening, a poignant moment unfolded off the court. The daughter of the woman who fainted posted a message on X, writing: ""Thank you @carlosalcaraz for the concern shown to my mum today who was taken ill during your match. Unlikely you'll see this message but I can try! Thank you.""To the surprise of many, Alcaraz did see it - and responded with warmth: ""You're very welcome, it was nothing! I hope your mum is doing well. Send her a kiss from me and take good care of her!""The touching exchange quickly went viral, showcasing the Spaniard's humility and kindness beyond the baseline.After clinching the match in five thrilling sets (7-5, 6-7, 7-5, 2-6, 6-1), Alcaraz reflected on the extreme conditions: “Fans are not used to this weather. Sitting five hours in the sun without moving can be really hard.”","Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz stopped play after an elderly fan fainted.

The latest developments on the Asia Cup is welcome news for all the stakeholders who were counting on the India-Pakistan clash in multi-nation events. The recent cross-border tension complicated the situation for a bit but with the sides set to lock horns in UAE, the future of this fixture in global tournaments looks bright.It could well act as a catalyst before the Women's ODI World Cup scheduled to take place in India and Sri Lanka. While Pakistan were going to play all their games, including knockouts if they qualify, in Sri Lanka but there were question marks over the future of India-Pakistan cricket after the recent events.

Exclusive | Arjuna Awardee Vantika Agrawal: 'People still ask, 'Chess is fine, but what do you really do?''

Poll Do you believe that chess is perceived differently in Northern and Southern India? Yes, definitely No, it's the same everywhere

NEW DELHI: In the hit HBO series ""Game of Thrones"", those from the North and the South had a contrasting approach towards dominance and survival. And for eventual success? The blood and instinct of the North had to join hands with the alliance-building of the South.Along those lines, a similar story is playing out in Indian chess.23-year-old Vantika Agrawal, a double gold medallist from the 2024 Chess Olympiad and an Arjuna Awardee, says she feels let down by the way chess is perceived in the northern part of the country.""In North India, there is no culture of chess,"" the Uttar Pradesh-born chess star tells TimesofIndia.com.""If someone asks what you do here, and you say, 'I'm a chess player,' their response is usually, 'Okay, but what do you actually do? What are you studying?' I think it's still the same story, even after winning so many medals. People still ask, 'Chess is fine, but what do you really do?'""Her words land like a checkmate: honest, sharp, and damning. And she is not alone.If a line is drawn in the middle, the southern part of India would undoubtedly be the undisputed Dragonstone of Indian chess. From Viswanathan Anand and Koneru Humpy to D Gukesh, from Praggnanandhaa to his sister Vaishali, the land has produced enough crops.Whereas, in North India, in places like Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh, the board looks starkly different.Delhi Chess Association (DCA) president Bharat Singh Chauhan doesn’t sugarcoat it: “By birth, North Indians are different and South Indians are different.There’s a massive cultural difference between North and South India. If I put it bluntly, in the South, even a billionaire can be seen wearing slippers and standing at a bus stop, while here in the North, even someone with Rs 5 crore gets treated like royalty.""In the North, chess often battles for legitimacy — seen by many as a hobby rather than a career.""Speaking of Delhi specifically, Parimarjan Negi, a GM from Delhi who is now settled in the US, and GM Sahaj Grover, too, have almost quit chess. They feel like whatever they wanted to achieve from this sport, they have achieved it. It’s a cultural and mindset difference. In the South, there is a deep-rooted chess culture. Even if you talk to Viswanathan Anand today, you’ll see the difference,"" added the DCA president.The numbers back him up. Delhi NCR alone sees Rs 5 crore in monthly earnings across 200-odd chess coaches. Yet, the quality is not up to the mark, with families switching coaches for marginal cost differences.""Today, there’s no chess player dying of hunger. Here, the thing is, nobody retires. There’s also no control over trainers. Many come promising, 'I’ll make your child the next Anand,' but they’re lying. It’s just marketing. For a profit of Rs 5,000, people switch coaches. That’s what we lack here,"" Chauhan elaborated. ""In the South, there’s loyalty — like Vishnu Prasanna has been with Gukesh for years. The same goes for RB Ramesh and Praggnanandhaa, Vaishali, Aravindh Chithambaram. That culture doesn’t exist here. We are trained thugs.""ALSO READ: 'Earlier, I used to beat Indians at will': What global chess stars in their 30s, 50s, and 80s say about India's dominance Grandmaster SL Narayanan, who hails from Kerala — a state often grouped into the broad 'South' label — goes a step further to make a sharp distinction. “People label everything as ‘South,’ but honestly, only Tamil Nadu has that level of chess support,"" the 27-year-old said. ""In my state, if you become a Grandmaster, it's still not a big deal. But Tamil Nadu? The government awards you. That motivation is powerful.”He isn’t exaggerating. International Arbiter and senior chess administrator Gopakumar Sudhakaran, who also hails from Kerala, says Tamil Nadu’s emergence as the mecca of Indian chess is no accident — it’s the result of cultural evolution. And surprisingly, the COVID-19 pandemic, despite its devastation, played a significant role in accelerating this shift.""In Tamil Nadu, chess is part of household culture. Even if it’s not competitive, the father, mother, everyone knows how to play. That’s not as common in the North. But it's just how societies evolve differently,"" Sudhakaran added.""Post-COVID, online platforms have really helped bridge the gap. Earlier, we couldn’t imagine International Masters coming from places like Jammu & Kashmir; now, it’s happening. Coaching is more accessible, and we’ve entered a kind of cosmopolitan training environment.""Chess was once seen as gambling in some parts of North India, but now parents see its value and support their children.""Shyam Sundar M, a 2013 Grandmaster who now coaches young talents like FIDE World Junior Champion Pranav V and GM Srihari LR at Chennai’s Chess Thulir academy, reveals how and why so many Tamil Nadu players dedicate themselves entirely to chess, often at the cost of academics.“In Tamil Nadu, many players dedicate themselves fully to chess, often sacrificing academics. And I have seen a large trend since the COVID-19 days. Some schools here, like Velammal, are supportive, offering flexibility in terms of attendance and even financial help. When Gukesh won (the World Championship), he was gifted a car worth nearly Rs 1 crore. The state government also gives cash awards,"" the 33-year-old Shyam Sundar explained.“In Tamil Nadu, more players keep coming up. So naturally, some parents start thinking maybe even my child can become like that. They get inspired by other kids’ success. And when more players come, overall interest in the game also increases. That’s how the game becomes more fair and competitive.”The North isn’t barren. But it lacks the sacred institutions that the South has carefully cultivated. Like Jon Snow staring down Daenerys’s dragons, the northern talent still burns bright, just without the firepower behind it.The challenge now is to forge a unified kingdom, one where Vantika doesn’t have to explain her profession, where switching coaches isn’t routine, and where a child from Rohtak can dream as vividly as one from Rameswaram.","Vantika Agrawal, a double gold medallist from the 2024 Chess Olympiad, says she feels let down by the way chess is perceived in the northern part of the country.

NEW DELHI: Despite another solid knock of 45 runs from opener Vaibhav Suryavanshi, India fell agonizingly short as England edged a dramatic one-wicket victory in the second Youth ODI at Hove on Monday, levelling the five-match series 1-1.India had entered the match on a high after their commanding win in the opener, where Suryavanshi top-scored with 48.The young right-hander continued his fine form, scoring a composed 45 to help India recover from a disastrous start after skipper Ayush Mhatre was dismissed for a golden duck.Alongside Suryavanshi, Vihaan Malhotra (49), Rahul Kumar (47), Kanishk Chouhan (45), and Abhigyan Kundu (32) all chipped in with useful contributions, guiding India to a competitive total of 290 in 49 overs.England's bowlers were far from disciplined, leaking 32 extras, including a staggering 26 wides. Still, AM French led the way with 4 for 71, while Jack Home (3/63) and Alex Green (3/50) shared the rest of the spoils.The chase, however, proved to be a rollercoaster. England stumbled early at 7 for 1 and later 47 for 3, with medium pacer RS Ambrish striking twice in quick succession.But a magnificent counterattack from England captain Thomas Rew, who hammered 131 off just 89 balls (16 fours, 6 sixes), turned the tide.His 123-run stand with Rocky Flintoff (39) laid the foundation, but once Rew fell in the 40th over, the match swung back toward India.With England reduced to 254 for 8 by the 46th over, Ambrish (4/80) reignited hopes for India. England needed seven off the final over, and with only one wicket in hand, the game hung on a knife’s edge. But Sebastian Morgan (20 not out) held his nerve, striking a boundary off the third ball of Yudhajit Guha’s over to seal a heart-stopping win.Though India were left to rue missed chances, Suryavanshi’s consistency at the top continues to be a bright spot.

Coco Gauff, Alexander Zverev, Jessica Pegula, Qinwen Zheng, Lorenzo Musetti, Holger Rune, Daniil Medvedev, Paula Badosa all exited Wimbledon in the first round. If you didn't notice, they were all top-10 seeds at the grass court major.The opening two days of Wimbledon witnessed eight top-10 seeds fall - an Open Era record - and 23 in total across men and women - 13 among men and 10 in women. 10 seeds bowed out on the opening day and 13 followed them on the second.With French Open champion Gauff and Pegula both out, it is the first time in the Open Era that two of the top-3 have exited a Slam in the first round.The 13 exits for men's seeds is a Wimbledon record and matches the Slam record from 2004 Australian Open. That number could have been higher with second-seed Carlos Alcaraz, fifth-seed Taylor Fritz and 25th seed Felix Auger-Aliassime all being taken to nervous fifth sets.Accounting for Zverev, a three-time Grand Slam finalist and No. 3 seed, was 72nd-ranked Arthur Rinderknech, who came in with a 1-4 career record at the All England Club and zero trips past the third round in 18 appearances at majors.Musetti, the seventh seed and semi-finalist at Wimbledon last year, was sent packing by Nikoloz Basilashvili, a qualifier ranked 126th who only once has made it as far as the fourth round in his 31 previous Grand Slam tournaments.But none could top the shock of seeing World No. 2 Coco Gauff head out in straight sets 6-7, 1-6 to Dayana Yastremska.Pegula, the third seed was coming off a grass-court title in Germany over the weekend, and was swept aside by 116th-ranked Elisabetta Cocciaretto in a 6-2, 6-3 loss that lasted less than an hour.All said and done, Rinderknech's win over Zverev came out of absolutely nowhere. “What a moment. Such emotions,” Rinderknech, a 29-year-old from France, said after completing his 7-6 (3), 6-7 (8), 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-4 victory across 4 hours, 40 minutes in a match that continued from Monday's suspension at a set apiece. “I don’t even know where to start.”“It’s my first top-five win, in the biggest stadium in the world,” Rinderknech said. “My legs are still shaking. I’m just so happy the match is finished.”During his first-round match on Tuesday night, Novak Djokovic was visited twice by a doctor for a stomach problem and was given what he referred to as “miracle pills.” It helped him see off Alexandre Muller in four sets.In the second set, Muller saved 11 break points and six set points to overturn Djokovic's momentum as the Serb struggled physically. The seven-time Wimbledon champion was also 5-2 up in the tiebreak before squandering that advantage.While trailing 1-2 in the third set, Djokovic took a medical break and was seen again later in that set by a doctor.“I went from feeling my absolute best for about a set and a half to feeling my worst for roughly 45 minutes,” Djokovic explained. “Whether it was a stomach bug — I don't know what it was — I just struggled with that. After some doctor’s miracle pills, my energy bounced back, and I was able to finish the match on a positive note.”Djokovic remains undefeated in the first round at the All England Club, now with a 20-0 record, where he has claimed seven of his 24 Grand Slam titles. He has reached the final in each of the last six years, although he was runner-up to Carlos Alcaraz in 2023 and 2024.“I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t believe I had a chance. I think I always have a chance. I feel I’ve earned my right to believe I can go all the way and win the title,” said the 38-year-old Serbian. “I’ve always felt that grass, especially later in my career, is the surface where I play my best tennis. So, why not try to do it again?”Lyrical pieces are written about how its one-vs-one on the tennis court. It's on the player to figure things out, on their own, when winning or losing. Subsequently, arguments are made against on-court coaching by the traditionalists of the sport.What goes ignored, though, is the mental toll it has on players who travel the world without friends, family or a break. Zverev stressed he would consider therapy following his earliest Slam exit since 2019.In an honest press conference, Zverev said he was struggling to cope with life on the tennis circuit. ""It's funny, I feel very alone out there at times. I struggle mentally. I've been saying that since after the Australian Open,"" he said.""I'm trying to find ways, trying to find ways to kind of get out of this hole. I keep kind of finding myself back in it in a way.""I feel, generally speaking, quite alone in life at the moment, which is a feeling that is not very nice.""Asked if he would consider therapy, Zverev said: ""Maybe for the first time in my life I'll probably need it.""I've been through a lot of difficulties. I've been through a lot of difficulties in the media. I've been through a lot of difficulties in life generally.""I've never felt this empty before. Just lacking joy, just lacking joy in everything that I do. It's not necessarily about tennis. Just lacking joy outside of tennis, as well.""Even when I'm winning, even when I'm winning like in Stuttgart or Halle, it's not necessarily, like, a feeling that I used to get where I was happy, over the moon, I felt motivated to keep going.""It's just not there right now for me, which, again, is the first time in my life which I'm feeling it.""Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova played her final match at the All England Club, bowing out 3-6, 1-6 against Emma Navarro.“This place holds the best memories I could wish for,” said the 35-year-old Kvitova, who will retire after the US Open. “I never dreamed of winning a Wimbledon and I won it twice.""The 35-year-old Czech returned from maternity leave in February following the birth of her son Petr in 2024, but has found it difficult to handle the demands of being a mother while juggling a professional tennis career. Now ranked 572, Kvitova has lost eight of her last nine matches.""I was lucky to have a beautiful court in my last match, where I do have lot of memories. It was a very special, emotional and happy place for me.""She later hijacked the media intercom system to announce to reporters that she was about to conduct her ""last, final"" press conference.""I can't wait to be back here as a member. Thank you very much Wimbledon,"" she said in her goodbye.","Coco Gauff, Alexander Zverev, Jessica Pegula, Qinwen Zheng, Lorenzo Musetti, Holger Rune, Daniil Medvedev, Paula Badosa all exited Wimbledon in the first round. World No. 2 Coco Gauff went out in straight sets 6-7, 1-6 to Dayana Yastremska.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122195590,imgsize-30120,width-400,resizemode-4/122195590.jpg"

Travis Kelce cringes at old dating show, says it’s the worst thing he’s ever done



Travis Kelce Talks NFL Retirement, Chiefs Super Bowl Loss + Bussin’ With The Boys Meets Taylor Swift

Long before Travis Kelce ’s headline-grabbing relationship with Taylor Swift, the Kansas City Chiefs star was navigating a very different chapter of his love life—one that he now looks back on with a wince. The NFL tight end recently opened up on Bussin' With The Boys podcast, candidly discussing his past involvement in the 2016 reality dating show Catching Kelce. And if there was any doubt about how he feels about that experience, Kelce left no room for misinterpretation.“The worst thing I ever did was the dating show,” Kelce said bluntly. “‘Catching Kelce’ was the [expletive] worst thing I ever did.”The show aired for seven episodes and featured 50 women, each representing a different U.S. state, all vying for Kelce’s attention. While Maya Benberry eventually won his heart on the show, the relationship fizzled soon after. Kelce would go on to date sports reporter Kayla Nicole in an on-again, off-again relationship that lasted five years before his romance with pop superstar Swift began dominating headlines.Looking back, Kelce expressed regret—not just for how the show turned out, but for doing it in the first place.“It didn’t set me up for anything,” he said. “I didn’t realize what reality TV really was.” His remarks came with both laughter and visible discomfort, making it clear that the show remains a cringe-worthy memory.The experience, it turns out, also came with a heavy dose of locker-room ribbing. “I was like, ‘Yeah, I’m having fun, I’m having fun, I’m having fun,’ and then I was like, ‘Oh [expletive], everybody is going to be able to see this forever,’” Kelce joked. “I was getting smoked by my teammates all season.” But despite the teasing, Kelce admitted he still performed well on the field that year, so his accountability never faltered.Interestingly, the reason Kelce even agreed to the show wasn’t fame or fun—it was financial. He revealed in a 2023 interview that he had turned the opportunity down multiple times before finally accepting it because he needed the money.Now, as a two-time Super Bowl champion and one half of the most-watched celebrity couple in the world, Kelce can comfortably leave those reality TV days behind. “I don’t even think anybody watched it,” he quipped during the podcast, brushing off the embarrassment with his signature sense of humor.With his podcast New Heights thriving and his relationship with Swift in the spotlight, Kelce has clearly outgrown the shadows of Catching Kelce. Reality TV might have helped kickstart some public recognition, but it's his talent, charm, and candid nature that have kept him at the center of pop culture.Also Read: Taylor Swift's stalker threat intensifies as restraining order extended — Travis Kelce steps up to protect her","Travis Kelce says joining 'Catching Kelce' was his biggest regret ever.

Skip Bayless says Tom Brady betrayed true greatness by crowning LeBron James the GOAT

Kyrie Did Something LeBron NEVER Does! Stay Away From Harden! Caitlin Clark Coverage “Inhumane”?!

Skip Bayless is back in the headlines, and this time he’s going after an unlikely target—his longtime hero Tom Brady. Known for his unwavering support of the NFL legend, Bayless shocked fans by labeling Brady a “sellout” after the quarterback publicly praised LeBron James as the “greatest ever” during a recent appearance on The Shop.Tom Brady, appearing alongside LeBron James at Fanatics Fest in New York City, spoke glowingly of the Los Angeles Lakers star, stating: “He’s always done things the right way. He’s always risen above the noise and the BS and continued to deliver. So you’re witnessing the greatest ever, and I hope you guys appreciate that.”But that praise didn’t sit well with Bayless, who took to his own YouTube show to unleash a scathing response—not just toward LeBron, but surprisingly, toward Brady as well.Bayless accused Brady of pandering to LeBron’s massive global fanbase for financial and branding purposes, especially now that both athletes are navigating their post-career paths. “Tom Brady will say and do whatever is required to polish his good guy image,” Bayless fumed. “He even kissed LeBron’s a** in front of LeBron because he knows how many billions of followers, how many fans LeBron has.”Known for championing Michael Jordan in the GOAT debate, Bayless didn’t hold back his disdain for LeBron’s legacy talk either.“LeBron James just can’t help himself,” he said. “He just can’t hide his runaway insecurity… knowing deep, deep down that he will never ever be seen as the greatest basketball player ever, by those who really know the game.”Since Undisputed was canceled following Shannon Sharpe’s departure in 2023, Bayless has seemingly become even more unfiltered. With no major network to answer to, he’s taken his hot takes to YouTube—turning his critical eye not only on LeBron, but now Brady too.Bayless’s harsh comments signal a major shift in sports media narratives, with fans and analysts alike surprised to see the veteran commentator turn on Brady after years of loyal praise.Also Read: Tom Brady and Orlando Bloom both chasing Sydney Sweeney?

As Travis Kelce gears up for his 13th NFL season, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end is thinking beyond the field—and into the broadcast booth.

It hints at his own post-retirement aspirations, which could include a transition into sports commentary once he decides to hang up his cleats.“I want to see what calling a game feels like,” Kelce admitted, sharing his long-standing fascination with sports broadcasters. “I mean, everybody saw that one. Yeah, it was a sh*t ton of money. No, I've always, I feel like, impersonated guys that call the games and stuff like that growing up. And I don't know, I thought it would always be fun. Just jump in there.”After a challenging 2024 season, which ended with a Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles and a personal stat line that fell below his usual standards—97 receptions, 823 yards, and just three touchdowns—Kelce appears to be looking to reignite his spark.Though retirement isn’t imminent, it’s clear he’s entertaining life beyond the gridiron.Brady’s success off the field seems to be influencing the future Hall of Famer, not just with his FOX role but also as a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders and entrepreneur behind ventures like CardVault.

Gary Bettman humiliates Adam Silver as NHL proves America wants blood, not dunks

In a year packed with All-Star fluff and viral dunk clips, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman made the most daring call of his tenure—and it paid off in spectacular fashion. Scrapping the traditional NHL All-Star Weekend for a bold, high-stakes Four Nations Face-Off wasn’t just a gamble. It was a message. A direct shot at the NBA, its declining midseason format, and Commissioner Adam Silver’s lukewarm grip on fans' attention.“Talk about the state of the sport,” Pat McAfee told Gary Bettman during a recent appearance on The Pat McAfee Show, praising the February 2025 event as a cultural pivot. “It feels like that was a real, like, kickstart to hockey becoming a huge part of Americana.”Bettman didn’t dodge. “There was so much demand for international best-on-best competition,” he said. “The Four Nations was really important to our players, and you could see how much it meant to them.”While Mac McClung’s third Slam Dunk Contest win barely cracked 3.3 million viewers, the NHL’s Four Nations final between Team USA and Canada exploded with over 9.3 million U.S. viewers—the biggest non-Olympic hockey broadcast ever. The tournament opener saw a fight nine seconds in.Anthem standoffs went viral. The final saw Connor McDavid net a sudden-death winner. The NBA simply couldn’t compete.Even Adam Silver admitted the NBA’s All-Star Game has “grown stale,” while hockey delivered a moment that felt like war for the sweater—not brand deals or social media moments.It wasn’t just about numbers. NHL stars returned to their clubs injured because they cared that much. Bettman underscored that point: “They showed it even after Four Nations was over… based on the number of players that came back to their NHL teams injured.”Also Read: Who is Lanny McDonald?

Bowen Byram could receive big offer from another NHL team this summer

Buffalo Sabres may not match a high offer and could choose to trade Bowen Byram

A young NHL defenseman may be on the move this summer. Buffalo Sabres’ restricted free agent Bowen Byram is making headlines as insiders discuss the possibility of him receiving a big offer from another team. The price could be very high, and some experts say it might be too much for the Sabres to match. Could Byram really leave Buffalo after just one season?On July 1, 2025, NHL insiders Elliotte Friedman and Nick Kypreos discussed Buffalo Sabres defenseman Bowen Byram during a segment on Sportsnet 590 The Fan. They talked about the growing possibility of Byram receiving an offer sheet from another team.Bowen Byram is a restricted free agent, meaning another team can offer him a contract, but the Sabres can match it or receive compensation in return. Kypreos said Byram could get up to $10 million per year on the open market. Friedman agreed and compared Byram’s value to Ivan Provorov, who signed a $59.5 million deal with the Columbus Blue Jackets.Friedman also shared that he heard teams were thinking about making a one-year offer sheet for Byram. That would force the Sabres to either match the offer or lose him.If a team offers Byram a contract worth $9 million or more per season, and the Sabres don’t match it, Buffalo would receive a first, second, and third-round pick in return.However, insiders believe this may not help Buffalo right now. The team wants to win now, not wait for future draft picks.Friedman and Kypreos both said the Sabres may prefer trading Byram instead of letting him go through an offer sheet. This would allow them to get better players back in return. The situation is like what happened in 2019 when Sebastian Aho signed an offer sheet with Montreal, but the Carolina Hurricanes matched it quickly.Bowen Byram signed a two-year $7.7 million deal with the Colorado Avalanche before being traded to Buffalo earlier this year in the Casey Mittelstadt deal. He’s still only 23 years old, but already seen as a top young defender.Also Read: “We Judge Women Very Harshly”: Jane Macdougall Exposes Lasting Damage From Fake NHL Affair Rumor With Kirk McLean As of now, no team has officially submitted an offer sheet.

From NHL hopefuls to legal uncertainty

Once rising names in Canadian hockey, five young players—Michael McLeod, Dillon Dube, Carter Hart, Cal Foote, and Alex Formenton—now find their professional careers in limbo as they await a court verdict on July 24, stemming from sexual assault charges tied to a 2018 incident. What began as a celebration of a gold-medal victory at the World Junior Championships has spiraled into a national scandal that shook Hockey Canada and left the futures of these athletes hanging by a thread.The allegations relate to a night in June 2018, following a Hockey Canada gala in London, Ontario. According to investigators, the incident occurred in a hotel room, involving a then-unnamed woman and several players. Now, all five accused have pleaded not guilty, but their absence from NHL rosters and legal entanglements suggest the damage is already done.Michael McLeod, once a top draft pick and playoff hero for the New Jersey Devils, took an indefinite leave in January 2024 and was charged shortly thereafter. He now plays in Russia’s KHL as he awaits his fate.Dillon Dube had a breakout moment with the Calgary Flames during the 2020 playoffs, but after being charged in early 2024, he too left the NHL.He signed with Dinamo Minsk in Belarus, his mental health cited as the reason for his initial leave of absence.Carter Hart, who had once been dubbed Canada’s next elite goaltender, now sits without an NHL contract. His career came to an abrupt stop in 2023, shortly before charges were filed. Once backed by the Philadelphia Flyers, he now finds himself as an unrestricted free agent.Both Cal Foote and Alex Formenton sought refuge in European leagues, their North American careers stalled by the court case. Formenton, notably, left hockey entirely in 2025, taking up construction work in his hometown—a stark contrast to the NHL dream he once lived.Also Read: When will the Hockey Canada sexual assault verdict be delivered?

Los Angeles Lakers line up trio of young rim-running centers via trade discussions

The Lakers have officially moved past playing it safe. With their center position still vacant and the clock ticking toward Luka Doncic’s extension deadline, Rob Pelinka is diving headfirst into trade negotiations. ESPN insider Dave McMenamin has shared that the Lakers are actively seeking a young, athletic big man, with Walker Kessler, Nic Claxton, and Jalen Duren being their primary targets. This isn’t just a stopgap; L.A. is aiming for a foundational change before it’s too late.The Los Angeles Lakers’ pursuit of a skilled, athletic center isn’t just theoretical—it’s becoming a tactical trade operation. According to top ESPN insider Dave McMenamin, the Lakers are “monitoring or even engaging in trade-wise” situations that might not just bring one, but maybe even two centers to L.A. McMenamin mentioned that in a potential domino effect, L.A. could take advantage of the extra resources to secure the depth they really need.Among the players drawing the most interest are Walker Kessler of the Utah Jazz, Nic Claxton of the Brooklyn Nets, and Jalen Duren of the Detroit Pistons. Kessler, at just 23 years old, put up impressive stats last season with an average of 11.1 points, 12.2 rebounds (4.6 of which were offensive), and 2.4 blocks—though it’s reported that Utah is asking for multiple first-round picks in return.Additionally, discussions around the league have also pointed out Claxton and Duren as examples of the rim-running athleticism that Doncic favors.Now that Brook Lopez, Day’Ron Sharpe, Clint Capela, and Santi Aldama are off the table, the Lakers' free-agent options are pretty slim. The only veteran centers still around are Al Horford and DeAndre Ayton, but insiders say L.A. is leaning more towards younger, trade-acquired players that match Doncic’s timeline.There's a real sense of urgency in these negotiations due to a couple of important factors: for starters, Luka Doncic will be eligible for an extension in August and is keen on finding a solid, athletic center to enhance his playing style. On the other hand, LeBron James has chosen to go with his $52.6 million player option for 2025–26, but according to his agent Rich Paul, James' commitment hinges on substantial roster enhancements—especially in the front line.Things are getting tricky with the Lakers' salary-cap strategy. It looks like L.A. is focused on keeping flexibility for a potential max-salary signing in 2027. This means that any center they acquire—whether by trade or a short-term free agent deal—needs to be in line with their cap responsibilities and bird rights structure.Also Read: Los Angeles Lakers Made Jake LaRavia Their Top Free Agency Priority With a $12 Million Deal With Doncic’s extension on the way and James’s future seemingly linked to the team’s performance, Los Angeles is going all out—aggressively pursuing younger, high-potential big men through trades.","The Los Angeles Lakers are actively seeking a young, athletic big man.

In 2023, the year I had joined college, we had gone on a picnic to Budge Budge. The seniors had organised the outing for juniors. I was new to the city and I was all excited about the picnic. While travelling by train to Budge Budge, I was introduced to Monojit Mishra.On reaching the spot, a bagaan baari, we found that two AC rooms on the first floor of the house had been kept for us, one for the girls and the other, for boys.From the time we reached, Monojit started drinking and some of the boys joined him around noon. They were all sitting downstairs in a big hall. I remember, it was around 5.45 pm that my father had called. I went to the boys' room to talk to him as the room was empty at that time.That room had an attached verandah, and I went out there to talk. Suddenly, I turned around to see Monojit striding up to me. He grabbed my hair, dragged me inside and pounced on me. I kept begging him to let me go but he snatched away my phone. He pinned me down and held my hands so tightly that I was not in a position to move. He took that chance and tore my innerwear's strap.I froze and started crying. He called me ‘hot' and bit me so hard that blood started dripping from my earlobes. The bite marks on my neck remained for at least a couple of months.The more I screamed the more Monojit blasted the volume of the music with a remote control so that no one could hear me.The brutality continued for 40 minutes until someone knocked on the door, and he was forced to open it. As he left, I ran downstairs, washed off the blood and went and sat on a bench. My ear was still bleeding, but I covered it with my hair. Just then, he again came up to me and groped me from behind, but I managed to escape. The torment continued till 6.30 pm.My batchmates and seniors sensed my discomfort, and after I confided in them, they asked me to lodge a complaint.

Elon Musk was ‘inspiration’ behind some of these Squid Game characters; Netflix show’s creator confirms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-was-inspiration-behind-some-of-these-squid-game-characters-netflix-shows-creator-confirms/articleshow/122175060.cms,"What Squid Game creator said about Elon Musk and VIPs



“Elon Musk is everywhere these days, right? Everybody talks about him. Not only is he the head of a huge tech company that controls the world almost, but he’s also this showman. After writing [Season 3], of course, I thought, ‘Oh, some of the VIPs do kind of resemble Elon Musk.”

Elon Musk Inspired Squid Game's Villains? Creator Drops CHILLING Truth As Netflix Ends Series

“They take their masks off and go into the game and kill others with their own hands,”

“In the past, those who really controlled the system and maintained power, they were hidden behind the curtain, almost like this big unseen conspiracy. However, it's no longer the case, especially in America,”

“We talk a lot about oligarchy these days, but these so-called big tech owners, they step up, telling everyone who they're backing with their money. The people who really control the power and the system, they no longer hide behind a curtain. They willingly take their masks off, almost as if to declare, ‘We're the ones running everything. We're the ones in control.’”

""Squid Game"" creator Hwang Dong-hyuk has confirmed that some of the Netflix show's characters, particularly its villains, “kind of resemble” Tesla CEO Elon Musk . Hwang stated that this resemblance occurred to him during the writing process. In a recent interview with Time magazine, Hwang discussed the masked VIPs in his popular Netflix series . The show depicts financially struggling individuals competing for a large cash prize and their survival, while a group of billionaires, known as VIPs, who observe the games from comfort and place bets on the outcomes.In an interview with Time magazine, Dong-hyuk said:These VIPs were introduced on Squid Game Season 1, Episode 7, which was also titled “V.I.P.S,” as a group of wealthy, English-speaking men who watch the final rounds of the Game in person. They are portrayed as careless and arrogant, placing bets on the lives of players for amusement. Pampered by the Front Man (Lee Byung-hun) and the Game’s staff, they treat the deadly contest like a spectator sport. The group is led by Oh Il-nam, a rich moneylender who secretly founded the Game. In a surprising twist, Oh Il-nam joins the competition himself as Player 001, concealing his identity while facing a terminal illness. Later, he confesses to Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) that he created the Game as a way to cope with boredom in his final days.In the third and final season, the VIPs become more directly involved by disguising themselves as guards and carrying out the task of shooting the “eliminated” participants, rather than merely observing the games.Dong-hyuk said, describing that it has a more symbolic meaning than simply being a technical detail.he added.Dong-hyuk continued.","""Squid Game"" creator Hwang Dong-hyuk has confirmed that some of the Netflix show's characters, particularly its villains, “kind of resemble” Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

Poll Should Andrew Flintoff have pursued a career in WWE? Yes, it would have been exciting No, boxing was a better choice Maybe, depending on his fitness I have no opinion on this

Former England cricket all-rounder Andrew Flintoff nearly transitioned to professional wrestling after his cricket career ended. He was in negotiations with World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) and came close to signing a contract for a match against The Undertaker After retiring from cricket, Flintoff explored various career options when he received broadcasting opportunities and discovered WWE as a potential path.""I just hid for a bit and started to wonder, 'What am I going to do now?' Some of the TV offers started to come, which was never the plan – I stumbled into that,"" Flintoff told The Overlap’s ""Stick to Cricket"" podcast. ""I nearly joined the WWE, I didn't want to box, that was never the plan. I would have been called 'Big Fred'""""What happened was, it got to a point in Dubai where I was unfit, I'd put on weight and was just not in a good place. I wanted to get fit again, but I needed motivation. As a kid, I loved WWE, so I came up with this idea, because I was doing League of Their Own with Sky, to fight the Undertaker in Manchester""Flintoff's idea reached WWE co-founder Vince McMahon , leading to direct communications between them. He began training for a potential showdown with The Undertaker in Manchester.""I wrote this treatment up and presented the idea to Sky, it started gathering momentum and next minute it's being passed onto WWE. I was in contact with the WWE, Vince McMahon""""Dave Roberts, who was a physiotherapist and lived with us (England cricket team) throughout my career, lived with us and looked after us. I asked him to send a trainer over to Dubai for six weeks because I needed to bulk up. He sent this fella over, I trained my nuts off, got fit and then the WWE flew me to Tampa. Me and the missus have gone over to Tampa, I've got two weeks at wrestling academy.""The reality of professional wrestling training proved to be physically demanding for Flintoff.""They fly us over business class, next morning we get in the car and go to WWE's academy, two massive units all branded. We're sitting in the car and these things are walking past me, like 6ft 8in monsters,"" Flintoff continued.""So I go in and we do the warm-ups, then they put me in the ring for three hours and I just ran the ropes, I'd run into someone and they'd throw me. The second day I went in there, I had lashes all down my back and my missus said, 'Are you alright with this?' I was sore and thought something's not right here. I said to this physio, 'I think I'm having a back spasm,' so they're all like, 'Oh! The English lad has got a back spasm,' so they put me on the couch, he's pushing me and I can feel my ribs separating""WWE offered Flintoff a three-year contract with opportunities to perform at major events like WrestleMania and Royal Rumble within 18 months.""The money was obscene, but we (family) wanted to move back from Dubai. The kids wanted to play cricket and didn't want to go to America, so I just changed it to boxing and had a fight instead,"" he admitted.Despite the lucrative offer, Flintoff ultimately chose to pursue boxing and return to the UK with his family instead of accepting the WWE contract.",Former England cricket all-rounder Andrew Flintoff nearly transitioned to professional wrestling.

Carolina Hurricanes target Nikolaj Ehlers after expiry of $42M Jets deal

Nikolaj Ehlers is expected to hit the open market in NHL Free Agency 2025 after completing a seven-year, $42 million contract with the Winnipeg Jets. The Carolina Hurricanes have emerged as strong contenders to land the 28-year-old winger—known for his speed, scoring touch, and offensive creativity. If he moves, it could be one of the biggest signings of the offseason.According to NHL insider Elliotte Friedman on the Spittin’ Chiclets podcast, the Hurricanes are showing serious interest in Ehlers.“Carolina, I think they really want that guy,” Friedman said, especially now with Mitch Marner likely off the board and other top names from Florida still uncertain.Ehlers perfectly fits Carolina’s style—fast, skilled, and creative. The Hurricanes have traditionally avoided overly physical players, preferring mobile, playmaking forwards. With Ehlers’ ability to generate offense and stretch defenses, he checks every box.The Hurricanes have been playoff regulars in recent seasons, but remain in search of that final push to become true Stanley Cup contenders. Adding a veteran winger with Ehlers’ scoring and skating ability could be the spark they need.Ehlers has played all 674 of his NHL games with Winnipeg, tallying 225 goals and 520 points over nine seasons. His best year came in 2016–17 when he posted 64 points, but even in recent seasons, he's maintained a strong two-way presence.Jets general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff has made it clear that the team wants to re-sign him, calling Ehlers a player who developed within their system and someone they’d like to keep long-term.With the cap rising and several teams flush with spending room, the market could quickly heat up. Alongside Carolina, the Columbus Blue Jackets and Anaheim Ducks have also been linked to Ehlers.Also Read: Mitch Marner traded to Golden Knights in $96 Million deal ahead of NHL free agency If the Jets can't secure an extension before July 1, the Hurricanes appear ready to make a serious offer. With his contract now expired, Ehlers could be one of the most impactful forwards available in this year’s free agent class and Carolina may not wait long to strike.","Carolina Hurricanes target Nikolaj Ehlers after expiry of $42M Jets deal.

Challenges the couple faced and their rise above it



Under the glow of stadium lights and amidst the rhythmic pulse of tennis balls on court, a captivating partnership has emerged. Morgan Riddle, a Minnesota-born influencer-turned-courtroom companion, and Taylor Fritz, America’s tennis rising star, now share more than victories—they share a journey marked by cosmopolitan flair and genuine devotion. Their love story began in the shadow of a global pandemic, yet quickly gained warmth, resilience, and sparkle. As Morgan transformed from a Midwest theater lover into “the most famous woman in men’s tennis,” she and Taylor became symbols of modern romance meeting athletic ambition. Together, they've navigated the intensity of global tours, broadcast fame, and online controversies—all while championing a mission to “make tennis cool again.” This article uncovers how they met, how their bond blossomed both privately and on screen, and how Morgan has become a cultural force against the backdrop of tennis’s elite world.Taylor Fritz and Morgan Riddle’s path crossed in early 2020 on the exclusive dating app Raya, when Morgan—new to Los Angeles during COVID—sought connection. “Because it was during Covid, no restaurants were open, no bars were open so we ordered sushi,” she told People.“We went to his place and I made him watch Midsommar with me, the really messed up horror movie… I think I traumatized him a little bit.”Their first date, flanked by sushi and unsettling horror cinema, became a charming anecdote of mutual curiosity and comfort in isolation. From that moment, the pair grew inseparable—both emotionally and geographically—as Morgan soon joined Taylor on the ATP Tour, supporting him from tournament stands and fostering a shared mission: to breathe fresh energy into tennis culture.Born July 31, 1997, in Saint Paul, Minnesota, Morgan Riddle Kimm was raised with cultural roots grounded in one of America’s hockey heartlands. “Tennis was not a big aspect of her life growing up in Minnesota… I personally was more into theater and speech and debate, not athletic at all,” she explained on Hold On to Your Racket podcast.After earning a degree in English from Wagner College, Morgan briefly worked in real estate before entering media and influencer marketing. She held roles such as Media Director for Love Your Melon and later transitioned to full-time content creation by 2022.Morgan now curates engaging tennis content—from Instagram and TikTok to her YouTube channel—geared toward younger audiences and fashion-forward consumers. She even partnered with Wimbledon to host ""Wimbledon Threads,"" showcasing tournament fashion.Morgan’s online catchphrase—to “make tennis cool again”—is more than aspiration; it’s a calculated movement. With over 436,000 Instagram followers and a growing TikTok presence, she brings fresh attention to one of tennis’s most talented American men.Taylor appreciates her public visibility. Morgan told EssentiallySports, “We travel so well together… we get along really well, which is why I think we’ve been able to make it work the last couple of years.” And when criticism emerged over her content, Morgan swiftly defended her approach on The Squeeze podcast: “Well, f--- that,” she said of criticism—asserting pride in her public persona.Taylor’s backing has been unwavering. Morgan explained, “Taylor has always been really good about [blocking out the noise]… he was very helpful in coaching me through that.” Their mutual support became especially vital during tennis’s global spotlight via Netflix’s Break Point, where Morgan even shared behind-the-scenes glimpses with fans.Ever visible at Wimbledon, the US Open, and Indian Wells, Morgan has become a fixture alongside Taylor. A standout moment came at Wimbledon 2025, when she wore an elegant pink ensemble and was described by media as a “stylish yet figuratively tense” presence courtside as Taylor battled through a five-set epic.Their dynamic also has potential PR impact. A Glamour profile framed Morgan as part of a new wave of influential athlete partners, celebrating how women like her enhance both the sport and its stars.Together, they’ve logged over 30 weeks per year on the road, an uncommon commitment that Morgan says has tested and strengthened their bond: “How do you guys spend that much time…without wanting to rip each other’s heads off? But we get along really well.”Morgan’s rise hasn’t been without friction. Some traditionalists viewed her visibility as capitalizing on Taylor’s status. On The Squeeze, she confronted this head-on: “They expected me to sit in the box, be relatively private… I kinda came in guns blazing.” Taylor backed her stance: “When it first started happening…he’d be like, ‘Why are you reading that?’ Their unity remains unshaken: “We really love each other. We have a very healthy relationship [and] nothing that anyone says online is gonna have any sort of effect on that.”Morgan and Taylor appeared together in Netflix’s Break Point, offering fans a rare look at their off-court life. Morgan later commented: “I think everyone was iffy about it at first…but now the whole tour has warmed up to it.”In interviews, Taylor highlights Morgan’s influence in keeping routines structured and positive. Glamour’s WAG Revival piece also noted the couple’s synergy: “If his ranking had gone down, they'd say it's my fault,” Morgan acknowledged.Also read: The Ultimate Fan Ranking: 10 Greatest Female Tennis Players in History Morgan Riddle and Taylor Fritz represent a refreshing narrative in tennis—a story of love, ambition, and modern partnership.

Morgan’s mission to revitalize tennis culture, coupled with Taylor’s competitive drive, reflects a blend of public influence and private resilience. Facing criticism together, they emerged more unified, committed to each other and the sport. Their journey not only champions tennis but redefines athletic partnership—promising a future where mutual support and authenticity score just as high as grand-slam glory.",Morgan Riddle is a Minnesota-born influencer-turned-courtroom companion of American tennis star Taylor Fritz.
