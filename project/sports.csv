NEW DELHI: “When I reached International Space Station for the first time, the first thing I did was to locate India (on Earth), from where my father belonged to, and Slovenia, from where my mother belonged,” said Indian American astronaut Sunita Williams in Delhi on Tuesday — the only female astronaut who has set the world record for most cumulative spacewalking time by a woman with a total of 62 hours and 6 minutes. During her lifetime, Williams went to space three times as a Nasa astronaut, totalling 608 days in space.Williams’s father, Deepak Pandya, is from Jhulasan village in Gujarat’s Mehsana district, where he was born before migrating to the US. Her mother, Ursuline Bonnie Pandya, is of Slovenian-American descent. Nicknamed ‘Suni’ or ‘Soncka’ in Slovenia, Williams was born in the US state of Ohio and has an elder brother, Jay Thomas, and a sister, Dina Ann.“Though I spent nine months in space during my latest trip to the ISS, I missed meeting Group Captain Subhanshu Shukla who reached the station just after I left,” Williams said during an interactive session, 'Eyes on the Stars, Feet on the Ground' at American Center here.During her last trip to space before hanging her astronaut suit, Williams went to ISS in 2024 for a scheduled 8-day space trip but had to spend 9 months on ISS as the Boeing Starliner that took her to ISS malfunctioned and had to return empty-handed.Later, SpaceX's Dragon brought Williams and her crewmate Butch Wilmore back to Earth on March 18, 2025, with the duo ending up spending 286 days in space. India’s Group Capt Shukla went to space as part of the Axiom mission on June 25, 2025.Williams faced several health issues after returning to Earth after remaining in zero gravity for a long time. However, the 60-year-old was seen in high spirits in Delhi on Tuesday, guiding and inspiring Indian students to join the space sector. To cheer her at the Delhi event was the mother of another Indian-American astronaut, Kalpana Chawla, who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia crash in 2003. Williams, wearing a trademark deep blue space overalls and sporting a pair of space-themed canvas shoes, stepped off the dais and reached out to Chawla’s mother, Sanyogita Chawla, 90, who was sitting in the front row, and gave her a warm hug.When asked about the renewed global interest in the Moon, Williams acknowledged the existence of a modern “space race”. “I think there is a space race going on. We want to get back to the moon sustainably and start the conversation about rules of engagement— how we actually work together with other countries. We want to do this in a productive, democratic way, much like Antarctica,” she said.Williams asserted that the horizon of space exploration is rapidly expanding beyond traditional boundaries, stating that the commercialisation of space is creating unprecedented opportunities for innovation. “Commercialisation of space is great. It means there are opportunities for people to work in so many different companies— not only rockets and spacecraft, but parts of space, experiments, satellites, and 3D printing of metals,” she said.“In my childhood, I never dreamt of becoming an astronaut. We used to watch Star Trek on black & white TV. After I did my schooling and graduated, my brother pushed me to join the military and, thereafter, I became a Navy officer,” she said. Williams had logged more than 3,000 flight hours in more than 30 types of aircraft during her career in the US Navy before donning the astronaut suit. While flying aircraft as a Navy commander, I then wished that I should go to the Moon. From then on, I pursued the career of an astronaut,” Williams recalled.“When I reached the ISS, I was craving for Indian food. I was delighted to see that somebody sent me an Indian dish (in the food cargo) though others were making faces. I was glad to also receive 3D printed models of my dogs on ISS.” In Nasa circles, Williams was called the ‘samosa astronaut’, as she liked carrying samosas to space.An athlete since childhood, Williams wanted to participate in a marathon. “So, my sister told me, ‘I will run on your behalf on the ground and you run in space. So that is how I decided to run a marathon in space,” she revealed. Williams ran the Boston Marathon in space in 2007 after qualifying by running the Houston Marathon in 2006, marking the first time a marathon was completed in orbit. She ran on a treadmill aboard the ISS, finishing in 4 hours and 24 minutes while her sister and others ran on Earth.Recalling her most difficult space job, Williams said she went for a spacewalk after the Starliner faced a technical issue and returned to Earth and the Dragon spacecraft was docking at ISS. “While I was replacing a defected reflector, I had ensured that the Dragon capsule was not damaged with my steel helmet. So, I did the job of replacing the reflector by bending my head on one side for over 1.5 hours. After I returned to my space cabin, I faced neck cramps the whole time. ”Williams, during her extended 9-month stay on ISS, conducted along with her crew over 150 scientific experiments and technological demonstrations, accumulating more than 900 hours of research across various fields like space gardening, microgravity biology, and water recovery systems.The Nasa astronaut said the perception about life on Earth changes when people go to space. “I am married and I argue with my husband like other couples do. But after reaching space (seeing the vast expanse of universe), I used to wonder why we argue (on minor issues) at all,” she said, adding, “The first thing I ate after returning to Earth was the bread my husband baked for me.”","Indian American astronaut Sunita Williams spoke in Delhi on Tuesday.

Sunita Willaims Is Free: Hugs, Tears At ISS As SpaceX Replacement Crew Meets Stranded Astronauts

NEW DELHI: Calling her visit to India a homecoming, Indian-origin Nasa astronaut Sunita Williams on Tuesday said India held personal importance for her as it was the country where her father was born.Speaking at an interactive session at the American Center in New Delhi, Williams said, ""One of the first things you do when you get to space is that we all want to look for our home, like our immediate home. I grew up in Massachusetts. My father's from India. My mother's from Slovenia. I'm obviously looking for these places to call home.""Williams also spoke about her extended stay aboard the International Space Station after an eight-day mission stretched to more than nine months due to technical issues with the Boeing spacecraft. Recalling life aboard the ISS, she said, “We are not the best singers, but we can make space cakes,” drawing laughter from the audience. “You would see almost 12 people on the ISS at one point in time,” she said.Reflecting on how space travel changed her outlook, Williams said, “It really makes you feel like we are just one,” adding that differences between people seem far smaller when seen from orbit.""Every person I know is there, every animal, every plant, everything we know is there. We're all in this one little space in our solar system, and I think it changes your perception about us having any differences. It really makes you feel like we are just one and we all should probably work a little bit closer and easier together,"" Williams said.",Indian-origin Nasa astronaut Sunita Williams calls her visit to India a homecoming.

NEW DELHI: An American woman faced a shocking incident of sexual harassment on the Delhi Metro when a teenage boy groped her after she agreed to a photo. The boy's mother and sister defended his actions, claiming he was simply curious about blondes.Gaurav Sabnis, an Indian-origin professor at New Jersey's Stevens Institute of Technology, shared the woman's account on X. He had warned his former student to stay cautious during her India trip for a friend's wedding, especially in Delhi where she might draw unwanted attention as a white .""When this former student called me in November for suggestions for her India trip for a friend's wedding, I told her, be on guard for sexual harassment. Especially in Delhi. Here, you're just another blond. There, you'll be a target. Sadly, it came true,"" Sabnis wrote, posting a screenshot of her text.The woman described the ordeal: “While my colleagues and hosts were great and I had a fun memorable 8 days in India, there was one unfortunate and ugly incident. That just soured my mood so much that I was withdrawn and depressed for a couple of days.”""A teenage boy, maybe 14 or 15, at a Delhi Metro station just ruined it forever.He was with his mom and sister so thought okay why not. He puts an arm on my shoulder. Weird but okay, he's a teenager. And then, professor, he just straight up grabbed my breasts hard and spanked my butt and giggled like he had played a joke. pretty much EXPLODED in anger, grabbing him by the collar and pushing him away. He fell and his mother started getting upset at me saying I was ""overreacting"". That he had never met a blond lady up close so he got ""carried away"". What kind of parenting is that? I loved your country and I wish I could say return, but don't think ever will. In fact I'm going to give all of South Asia a pass.""Social media users condemned the family's defense as enabling and victim-blaming. Many highlighted molestation as a serious crime and suggested filing a complaint, while other Indians apologised .on behalf of the boy and his family.One wrote, ""I know exactly what you mean. Whenever my daughter travelled in India, she was left deeply bewildered—why people spoke to her while staring at her chest instead of meeting her eyes, why they asked for selfies as if she were an object rather than a person, and why so many felt entitled to touch, feel, or grab her. The experience was confusing, unsettling, and profoundly violating.""Another said, ""Most unfortunate. The over protective mother’s reaction is highly condemnable and a major factor in moulding the way men behave.""A third commented, ""Victim blaming is a common thing in North India especially"" and ""“Overreacting"" what a disgusting reaction from the lady, instead of reprimanding her kid.""","An American woman faced a shocking incident of sexual harassment on the Delhi Metro when a teenage boy groped her after she agreed to a photo.

Chirag Paswan Hits Out At Tejashwi Yadav Over ‘People Lost In Democracy’ comment

Stage set for

Tejashwi Yadav

vs

Misa Bharti

?

NEW DELHI: The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) is set to convene a meeting of its national executive in Patna later this week, with key leadership decisions expected to be made.“Yes, the national executive meeting will be held on January 25. Besides Lalu, all top leaders are expected to be in attendance. Issues that are deemed important by the leadership may be taken up for discussion,” RJD spokesperson Chitaranjan Gagan told PTI, referring to party supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav Yadav, a former Bihar chief minister, has been leading the Rashtriya Janata Dal since forming it in 1997, after he broke away from the erstwhile Janata Dal.However, while Lalu Yadav’s authority remains unquestioned, sources said that his advancing age and health concerns have prompted discussions on the need for a second line of leadership to manage the organisation’s day-to-day affairs.According to party sources, a decision could therefore be taken to appoint a “working national president.”The leading contender for the post is Tejashwi Yadav, a former deputy CM and the current leader of the opposition in Bihar. He was the RJD’s chief ministerial face in last November’s assembly elections, in which the party’s tally fell sharply to 25 seats from 75 in 2020. Tejashwi is the youngest of the nine children of Lalu Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi, herself an ex-chief minister.Another section of RJD workers are reportedly of the opinion that the post should go to Misa Bharti, the eldest of the nine siblings and the current Lok Sabha MP from Pataliputra.""It is not a question of lack of trust in Tejashwi's leadership. The fact is, the BJP-led NDA, our rival, has for long been trying to paint the RJD as a patriarchal organisation in which women are denied their due,"" a party leader noted.""The outbursts of Rohini Acharya after the poll results have made matters worse. Just look at how all leaders of the BJP and chief minister Nitish Kumar's JD(U) had latched on to the opportunity to accuse Lalu ji of giving a raw deal to his daughters,"" he added, referring to a sibling of Tejashwi Yadav and Misa Bharti.Notably, Acharya, who is based in Singapore, had come to Bihar for the poll campaign. She stormed out of her parents' home two days after results came out alleging that abuses were hurled at her and a slipper was flung to hit her when she questioned the role played by two close aides of Tejashwi, including Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Yadav, in the RJD's poor show.Another topic of discussion may be the replacement of Mangani Lal Mandal as the RJD's Bihar unit president. Mandal, a party hopper, was with the JD(U) till a few years ago and his return to the RJD failed to effectively cut into the EBC (extremely backward classes) votes.",The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) is set to convene a meeting of its national executive in Patna later this week.

Bill Belichick returns to TV as ESPN adds him to national title broadcast

Bill Belichick is back on television. Just weeks after finishing a difficult first college football season at the University of North Carolina, the 73-year-old coaching legend has landed a new role with ESPN. The network confirmed that Bill Belichick will appear on the ACC Network’s broadcast of the College Football Playoff national championship game, set to be played in South Florida at Hard Rock Stadium.The game will feature the Indiana Hoosiers against the University of Miami Hurricanes and is scheduled for a 7:30 p.m. kickoff. ESPN announced that Belichick will be part of the on-air team, marking his return to TV while he continues working as head coach of the Tar Heels in Chapel Hill.ESPN said Bill Belichick will be paired with former Miami and Georgia head coach Mark Richt for the ACC Network’s coverage.The move comes only weeks after North Carolina ended a rough season with a 4–8 record, missing both a bowl game and the expanded College Football Playoff.Belichick became North Carolina’s head coach in 2025, taking his first job at the college level after leaving the New England Patriots following the 2024 NFL season.Before going to Chapel Hill, he spent months on television. He appeared on “Monday Night Football’s ManningCast” with Peyton Manning and Eli Manning and also made regular appearances on The Pat McAfee Show.Now, Bill Belichick is mixing both worlds. He is still leading North Carolina’s rebuild, but he is also stepping back into the media spotlight.ESPN’s announcement said the move brings “one of football’s greatest minds” back to the broadcast booth.Bill Belichick is the only head coach in NFL history to win six Super Bowls with one team. He also won two more Super Bowls as a defensive coordinator with the New York Giants.While returning to television, Bill Belichick has stayed busy on the recruiting trail. One of his biggest recent moves was bringing in quarterback Billy Edwards Jr. to Chapel Hill.ESPN’s Pete Thamel reported that Edwards chose North Carolina after being granted a medical redshirt, giving him one more year of college eligibility.Billy Edwards Jr., a Virginia native, transferred to Wisconsin in August 2025 after playing at Maryland.He later suffered a knee injury and missed the rest of the season. Now, he will compete with Gio Lopez for the Tar Heels’ starting job.He will also work under Belichick and new offensive coordinator Bobby Petrino, another longtime NFL coach.The addition matters for a North Carolina team that struggled badly. The Tar Heels beat only two Power Four teams, Syracuse and Stanford, during the 2025 season.Off the field, Bill Belichick has also faced attention around his personal life, including heavy media focus on his relationship with Jordon Hudson.Despite the noise, sources around the program say Belichick has stayed locked in on recruiting and player development.North Carolina will next hold its spring game on April 12 at Kenan Stadium, where fans will get their first look at the new roster.",Bill Belichick will appear on the ACC Network’s broadcast of the College Football Playoff national championship game.

Minnesota Wild controls early stages of play to withstand Maple Leafs' push



Marcus Foligno Notches First Career Hat Trick vs. Maple Leafs

Marcus Foligno gave a historic performance on Monday night, with his first career hat trick to lead the Minnesota Wild in beating the Toronto Maple Leafs 6-3 on the road. He completed his hat trick with an empty-net goal in the third period, breaking the home-winning streak of the Toronto Maple Leafs.The Minnesota Wild had the game in hand, going up by four before fending off their best effort in the third period. Their balanced attack, strong power play, and disciplined defensive systems overwhelmed the Maple Leafs, who opened a five-game homestand hoping to shake off an iffy road trip.The Minnesota Wild made little wait to set the tempo, burying a power play goal midway through the first period. Vladimir Tarasenko scored from a cross-crease pass to put Toronto on its heels and opened a multi-goal hole that Minnesota made no effort to fill, scoring again from the crease through Ryan Hartman to give it an early 2-0 edge.The Toronto Maple Leafs finally capitalized towards the end of the first period as John Tavares completed a power-play opportunity from the slot, reducing the gap by half and momentarily steadying the momentum. This surge was, however, short-lived for Toronto as Minnesota soon regained momentum in the early portion of the second frame. Foligno redirected a point shot, restoring the two-goal margin, paying homage to the Wild for their efforts in parking the presence in front of the crease and crowding the middle ice.The pace quickly escalated as Tarasenko dished past the defense and wristed the puck past Joseph Woll, giving the Blues a 4-1 lead. The Wild continued to apply pressure to the Toronto defense, and Foligno scored once more with the main advantage late in the second period, tipping the puck past the defense from the point to give the Wild a commanding lead going into the third period.Foligno sealed any hopes of a comeback attempt with an empty-net goal, finishing his hat trick in his 915th game in the NHL. This is a career milestone for the player, having only achieved 12 instances of scoring two goals in a game before this.","Marcus Foligno scored his first career hat trick to lead the Minnesota Wild in beating the Toronto Maple Leafs 6-3 on the road.

Three road trips that could shape the Toronto Blue Jays’ 2026 campaign,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/three-road-trips-that-could-shape-the-toronto-blue-jays-2026-campaign/articleshow/126836334.cms,"Vladimir Guerrero Jr. (Image Source: Getty)

High expectations and a season on the line

Chicago White Sox (April 2–5)

New York Yankees (May 18–21)

Seattle Mariners (July 3–5)

Why these road trips matter for Blue Jays

The Toronto Blue Jays have a lot of expectations regarding the 2026 season of the MLB, as they were beaten by only slight margins in the World Series last year. As the roster was reinforced by newcomers and the team was once again on the quest to win the championship, a number of road trips can be viewed as possible turning points. The depth, the strength, and the consistency of a team are usually put to the test when they are away, and these three series may prove to be conclusive in the season of Toronto.The first major road test by Toronto is against the Chicago white Sox, early. Although Chicago cannot be regarded as a powerhouse, the early-season games can precondition the months. An impressive performance in this series would enable the Blue Jays to gain confidence and momentum during the transition between Spring Training and the regular season grind. It also offers a competitive environment where the new players get a chance to bond outside of the home.There is no other rivalry in baseball that can be compared to the level of Blue Jays vs Yankees, and this Bronx series might have significant consequences on the American League East ranking. New York is among the most challenging divisional rivals of Toronto, and it is never easy to win on the ground in Yankee Stadium.This series will probably put Toronto to the test with the pitching strength, the lineup composition, and the psychological strength.It is a West Coast road trip to Seattle, which comes at a critical junction of the season. The Mariners have a good home track record and a competitive team, and this is not the place any other team wants to work. In the case of Toronto, this series may spell the difference between the club continuing momentum into the second half, or it may get tired and be weighed down by travel.As a group, these three road trips offer a combination of early-season foundation building, pressure-induced rivalry, and endurance-induced pressure in the middle of the first half. The Blue Jays' performance in Chicago, New York, and Seattle may play a major role in their path in the 2026 season.Being able to be consistent on the road has always been a characteristic of the championship teams, and the fact that Toronto overcame such obstacles might actually be what determines whether they will go back to the World Series with business to finish or another season of close calls.","The Toronto Blue Jays have a lot of expectations regarding the 2026 season of the MLB.

John Harbaugh’s wife Ingrid turns heads during Giants’ headline-making entrance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/john-harbaughs-wife-ingrid-turns-heads-during-giants-headline-making-entrance/articleshow/126741471.cms,"John Harbaugh’s wife (New York Giants/X)

John Harbaugh's New York Giants era puts family and future in focus



John Harbaugh's New York Giants era has officially begun, and the first signs point to a cultural reset inside one of football’s most scrutinized franchises. The moment the deal became final on January 17, the Giants signaled that stability and experience now sit at the center of their long-term vision. After years of inconsistency, New York turned to a coach known for structure, accountability, and sustained relevance in the NFL.John Harbaugh arrives with context that matters. His exit from Baltimore followed an 8–9 finish in 2025, the Ravens’ first missed postseason since 2021. Injuries to Lamar Jackson shaped that outcome, but after 18 seasons, both sides understood change was inevitable. For the Giants, it was not about chasing trends. It was about leadership, credibility, and setting a tone that can last beyond one season.The hiring did more than reshape the Giants’ coaching staff. It pushed the Harbaugh family into a new spotlight. Fans quickly turned their attention to his inner circle, including his daughter Alison, a former Notre Dame lacrosse player who later continued her academic and athletic journey at the University of South Florida.Just as visible is Ingrid Harbaugh, whose steady presence has followed John through every chapter of his coaching life.Their story began years ago at Western Michigan. John was working as a graduate assistant under his father Jack, while Ingrid held a role in the baseball office as a student. What started on campus became a lifelong partnership that has now landed in New York. That connection felt front and center when the Giants shared a video of the couple together, welcoming them with the caption, ""Coach Harbaugh has arrived"".Beyond the emotion lies real football intrigue. John Harbaugh steps into a roster filled with young talent and unfinished promise. Jaxson Dart represents a quarterback project with upside. Malik Nabers, if healthy, gives the offense a dynamic edge. The appeal of this move rests in Harbaugh’s ability to develop players while demanding discipline from day one.Expectations will rise quickly. The Giants are not asking for miracles. They are asking for direction. With Harbaugh, they finally believe they have it.",John Harbaugh's New York Giants era has officially begun.

What the New York Mets Gain and Weighing Risks

The New York Mets are adjusting after parting ways with a player who spent nearly a decade with the organization. With Brandon Nimmo now in Texas, the front office is focused on finding a short-term outfield option that limits spending and avoids long-term commitments.That approach has led them to Max Kepler. He is not viewed as a marquee signing but as a steady replacement. A reported one-year deal worth $7.6 million would give the Mets reliable defense and left-handed power while preserving roster flexibility.The New York Mets’ direction changed after a one-for-one trade with the Texas Rangers sent Nimmo to Texas in exchange for second baseman Marcus Semien. Nimmo waived his full no-trade clause to complete the deal, ending his eight-year, $162 million tenure in New York.Nimmo was still productive in 2025. He appeared in 143 games and hit .261 with 23 home runs and 82 RBIs.Even so, the Mets chose to address their infield and manage payroll. Semien now anchors second base, but the trade left a clear vacancy in left field.Max Kepler became a free agent after a one-year, $10 million season with Philadelphia that was limited by knee issues. His surface numbers declined, but the Mets value his defense and remaining power. In 2025, he ranked among the league’s best outfield arms and fits cleanly into a corner role.A short-term deal also matches the Mets’ plans. Prospect Carson Benge is expected to push for a larger role soon, and Max Kepler would fill the gap without blocking that path. The lower salary compared to Nimmo’s deal also leaves room to address pitching.Max Kepler would bring reliable defense in the corner outfield, a strong arm, and pop against right-handed pitching without a big price tag. His expected salary is well below Brandon Nimmo’s yearly average, giving the Mets a way to add value while staying mindful of the luxury tax.The concerns are durability and age. Kepler is in his mid-30s and coming off a down year. He also does not solve the center-field situation long term, leaving the Mets to rely on internal options.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Cincinnati Reds predicted to sign $10.2 million New York Yankees; Brady Singer key trade asset? Even with those risks, the move fits the moment. The New York Mets stay competitive, protect their payroll, and keep a clear path open for younger players.","Max Kepler would bring reliable defense in the corner outfield, a strong arm, and pop against right-handed pitching without a big price tag.

Despite the loss, his form has remained sharp.The 34-year-old returned to action in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday night and produced an impressive performance. Aspinall defeated Lourence Ilagan 6-1 in the first round, recording an average of 100.93. While his darts were on fire, the conditions off the stage were just as intense, with hot weather playing its part in his preparation.After his dominant win over Ilagan, Nathan Aspinall joked that the weather had been just as challenging as his opponent. He explained that temperatures were around 25 degrees and that he had not played competitively since Bahrain. After arriving in Saudi Arabia on Sunday, he spent time relaxing by the pool instead of practicing.Aspinall said the sunny conditions were enjoyable but admitted he stayed out too long.He shared that his skin showed clear signs of spending too much time in the sun. According to him, this was his first visit to Saudi Arabia, and he fully embraced the warm weather, perhaps a bit too much.The Stockport-based player went on to admit that this is something he often does. He explained that whenever he goes on holiday, he tends to overdo it on the very first day. He said he ended up feeling extremely hot and sunburnt, even joking that he had given himself mild sunstroke. Despite that, he added that he planned to be back by the pool again the following day.On the sporting side, Aspinall now turns his attention to the quarter-finals. He will face Man Lok Leung, who caused a surprise by beating Danny Noppert 6-3. It will be a tough test, but Aspinall’s recent form suggests he is ready.There is also plenty at stake. The winner of the quarter-final match is guaranteed at least $10,000 for reaching the semi-finals. The player who loses will still earn $5,000 for making the last eight. The overall winner of the Saudi Darts Masters will take home a top prize of $30,000, adding extra motivation for Aspinall as he continues his run in Riyadh.",Nathan Aspinall is in Saudi Arabia for the Saudi Darts Masters. The 34-year-old beat Lourence Ilagan 6-1 in the first round on Tuesday. He will face Man Lok Leung in the quarter-finals on Wednesday.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126791286,imgsize-557298,width-400,resizemode-4/nathan-aspinall.jpg"

"World's largest railway station has 44 platforms, and it is situated here",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/worlds-largest-railway-station-has-44-platforms-and-it-is-situated-here/articleshow/126642797.cms,"Grand Central Terminal, an iconic New York City landmark, features 44 platforms and 67 tracks spread over two expansive levels, enabling the efficient transit of millions each year. Since its inauguration in 1913, the terminal has displayed innovative architectural choices, such as sloped platforms and concealed mezzanines, addressing contemporary urban transport needs.

Where exactly is it located

Why 44 platforms matter

Built for the future, long ago

More than a travel stop

How it shaped city travel

Disclaimer: This article is based on verified public information about Grand Central Terminal. Facts mentioned in the story are accurate at the time of writing and meant for general knowledge only.

The world’s largest railway station is not measured by height or area alone. It is measured by movement. With 44 platforms, this station handles a steady flow of people every day and still feels calm, grand, and timeless. This place is Grand Central Terminal, and it sits in the heart of New York City, USA.Grand Central Terminal stands in Midtown Manhattan, on 42nd Street and Park Avenue. The location matters. Offices, schools, libraries, and landmarks surround it. Trains do not just arrive here. They connect daily life across New York and nearby states.Most stations struggle with space. Grand Central does the opposite. Its 44 platforms and 67 tracks sit on two underground levels. This design allows hundreds of trains to move without chaos. Morning rush hours feel busy but controlled, and that is rare for a city this large.The station opened in 1913, long before modern transport planning tools existed. Yet, its design solved problems cities still face today. Sloped platforms help trains slow naturally. Hidden levels separate long-distance and local trains. Every detail saves time and energy.This is not just a station. It has restaurants, shops, a food market, and quiet corners. Many locals pass through daily. Some stop only to look up at the famous painted ceiling. Others meet friends under the clock. The place feels personal, even with crowds.Grand Central very much changed how cities think about transport hubs. It showed that stations can be functional and beautiful at the same time. Many modern terminals borrow ideas from it. Few manage to match its balance of scale and warmth.Big structures often feel cold. This one does not. The station proves that planning with care creates comfort, even for millions. The real achievement is not the number 44. It is how smoothly everything works, day after day.","The world’s largest railway station is not measured by height or area alone. It is measured by movement.

Lara Trump shares viral golfing photos with Donald Trump and granddaughter

Bill Maher Clashes With Lara Trump After She Downplays Trump’s ‘Piggy’ Insult On Air Force One

Social media responds with warmth and nostalgia

How a shared family moment cut through public tension





Lara Trump has recently bestowed upon social media participants a rare treat with a glimpse into the less familiar, more personal side of the Trump family. Through the sharing of just a few images on X, she has reached the hearts of many with this intimate family picture involving her young daughter's fun-filled golf game with her grandfather, US President Donald Trump himself, with whom she gets to spend quality time while playing their favourite game, golf. This is one instance where the family, known for its political fervour, has been accepted with such fervour not for their political ideology but for this common family experience that speaks volumes about their humanity despite their fame and power, resonating widely with audiences who cherish authentic, tender moments beyond politics.The photographs depicted Donald Trump behind the wheel of a golf cart, with his granddaughter sitting alongside him, looking happy and carefree. Moreover, there were no signs of poses or dramatic settings, only a serene capture of moments spent with each other. The informal nature of this post was a major factor that led to its success. The post was not meant for any particular message or statement, but only for a casual share by Lara Trump. The post succeeded in gathering tens of thousands of views, not because it was political or held any significance, but because it was something that was widely understood.The online response was largely positive, with many people describing the photographs as “wholesome” and “heartwarming”. Several users reflected on the special bond between grandparents and grandchildren, sharing how the images stirred personal memories and emotions. One user wrote, “What a great moment for her! My kids miss their Gramps,” while another commented, “Core memory unlocked!”, capturing the sense of nostalgia the post evoked. Others reacted more light-heartedly, with remarks such as, “Awww, I was wondering what Grandpa Trump was up to today!” and “Cutest thing I have seen all day.”Part of the post’s impact lay in its timing and tone. At a moment when public discourse is often polarised, the photographs presented a version of public life stripped of commentary and conflict. They highlighted how figures who dominate global headlines also occupy familiar family roles, such as grandparents enjoying simple moments with their loved ones.","Lara Trump has shared intimate family photos on social media.

NEW DELHI: A video claiming that the Indore crowd shouted “ Gautam Gambhir haaye haaye” after the third ODI against New Zealand has gone viral on social media, but the claim is misleading. The clip shows Virat Kohli reacting during the post-match presentation at the Holkar Stadium, and many users linked his reaction to alleged chants against head coach Gautam Gambhir.After India lost the match and the series 2-1, the video was widely shared on X and Instagram.Some fans said the chants showed anger towards the team management after recent home series losses, while others read different meanings into Kohli’s body language.However, a fact check suggests the crowd did not target Gambhir in Indore.Journalists and media personnel present at the stadium have said they did not hear any such chants during the ceremony. While the video visuals are real and were shot in Indore, the audio does not appear to be genuine.The sound in the clip seems to be taken from an older incident in Guwahati, where similar chants were heard during a Test match last year.The same audio pattern matches that earlier event, indicating the video was edited.This is important because misleading videos can create unnecessary controversy, especially when the team is already under pressure.Based on available information, the viral clip should not be seen as proof that the Indore crowd shouted slogans against Gautam Gambhir.With the 2-1 result, the Black Caps won an ODI series in India for the first time in 37 years, following their 3-0 Test series whitewash against India last year.India, however, have little time to dwell on the setback. The focus shifts to the shortest format, with a five-match T20I series against New Zealand starting Wednesday as part of the final build-up to the T20 World Cup. With less than three weeks remaining, the series serves as a vital dress rehearsal.The spotlight will be on captain Suryakumar Yadav. Since taking over as India’s T20I skipper in 2024, he has led the side to a winning percentage above 72, even as his batting form has remained under scrutiny.

Shubman Gill on missed chances, fielding lapses & World Cup preparation after ODI series loss

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli ’s bat once again became the loudest response after India lost the three-match ODI series against New Zealand 1-2, with the former captain’s elder brother Vikas Kohli taking a pointed swipe at critics questioning the great’s choices late in his career.India went down by 41 runs in the series decider in Indore, but Kohli stood tall amid the collapse, producing a sublime 124 while chasing a daunting 338. Across the three matches, the 37-year-old amassed 240 runs at an average of 80, with scores of 93, 23 and 124, underlining his enduring dominance in the format.The knock came days after former India batter and commentator Sanjay Manjrekar questioned Kohli’s decision to retire from Test cricket and continue in what he described as the “easy” format of ODIs. The remark, made during the fifth Ashes Test in Sydney where Joe Root and Steve Smith struck centuries, drew widespread criticism from fans.Vikas Kohli joined the chorus on Sunday, soon after Virat registered his 54th ODI hundred and 85th international ton. In a post on Threads that has since gone viral, he aimed a sharp barb at Manjrekar. “I wonder if Mr Expert of cricket has some suggestions for the easiest form of cricket.You need to be there to do that. Anyways, as I said, Easier said than done,” he wrote.The numbers back the sentiment. In Kohli’s last six ODIs, he has scored three centuries and two half-centuries. He also struck a hundred and a fifty for Delhi in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, silencing doubts about his motivation after stepping away from Tests.Kohli will next feature in India colours in July 2026 during the England ODI tour. Before that, he will turn his focus to IPL 2026, aiming to help Royal Challengers Bengaluru defend their title.",Vikas Kohli hits back at critics of his brother's decision to retire from Test cricket.

Most hundreds vs NZ (ODIs)

NEW DELHI: Run-machine Virat Kohli once again proved why he remains the heartbeat of India’s ODI batting, producing a majestic century against New Zealand in the third and final match of the series on Sunday. In a chase that looked to be slipping away early, Kohli stood tall, registering his record-extending 54th ODI hundred - 85th overall in international cricket, and keeping India’s hopes alive deep into the innings.This knock also carried historic significance. Kohli, who finished the match with 12,662 runs batting at number three in ODIs, has now gone past Australian great Ricky Ponting ’s tally of 12,655 to become the highest run-scorer in the format at that crucial position.7 - Virat Kohli (36 inns)*6 - Ricky Ponting (50 inns)6 - Virender Sehwag (23 inns)5 - Sachin Tendulkar (41 inns)5 - Sanath Jayasuriya (45 inns)Kohli also climbed to the top of another elite list. He now has the most ODI hundreds against New Zealand, with seven centuries in just 36 innings. Only Ricky Ponting and Virender Sehwag come close, with six each, while legends Sachin Tendulkar and Sanath Jayasuriya finished with five apiece.The century came at a critical moment. India were reeling at 71 for four after New Zealand posted a daunting 337 for eight. On a wicket that demanded composure, Kohli opted for control and persistence. He brought up his hundred with a single off Zak Foulkes on the final ball of the 40th over, having struck eight fours and two sixes in a 91-ball innings.It marked a landmark across formats and conditions. This was Kohli’s 85th international century, his 54th in ODIs, his 41st on Indian soil, and his seventh against New Zealand. He now has seven or more ODI hundreds against five different opponents, with 10 against Sri Lanka, nine against West Indies, eight against Australia, and seven each against South Africa and New Zealand.After missing out on a hundred in the series opener at Vadodara, where he fell for 93, Kohli made sure there was no repeat. He held one end firmly and built partnerships that dragged India back into the contest.The revival began with Nitish Kumar Reddy, who scored 53. Their 88-run stand for the fifth wicket restored belief before Kohli accelerated further alongside Harshit Rana. The pair added 99 runs in just 69 balls, with Rana contributing a fluent 52 off 43 deliveries.As long as Kohli remained at the crease, the sense persisted that another miracle was still possible. He eventually fell for a valiant 124 off 108 balls, a moment that effectively ended India’s chase. Until then, though, he had ensured belief never faded.The result may not have gone India’s way, but Kohli’s innings stood out as a reminder of his enduring greatness and his unmatched ability to make the impossible feel within reach.","Virat Kohli scores record-extending 54th ODI hundred against New Zealand.

I can’t push it anymore.”Her career was significantly affected by a knee injury sustained at the Rio 2016 Olympics.While she mounted a strong comeback with a World Championships bronze in 2017 and Commonwealth Games gold in 2018, recurring issues persisted.In 2024, she revealed she has arthritis and worn cartilage in her knees.",India's star shuttler Saina Nehwal has confirmed her retirement from competitive badminton.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan captain and well-known cricket commentator Ramiz Raja had an awkward moment during a Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) 2025–26 match when the crowd did not respond to him.The incident happened at the toss, before the match began. Raja was on the ground with the two captains, hosting the toss as part of the broadcast team. As he often does, the 63-year-old turned towards the stands and asked the fans to “make some noise”.But instead of loud cheers, there was almost complete silence in the stadium. Only a few faint claps and shouts were heard on television. For a brief moment, Raja looked surprised by the lack of response. He quickly collected himself and continued with the toss and the captain interviews.The short clip was soon shared widely on social media platforms like Instagram and X.Many users found the moment awkward and joked about it, as some labelled it as “cringe-worthy”. The video spread fast and became a popular topic among cricket fans around the world.Watch:Some fans defended him and said the situation may not have been his fault.They pointed out that stadium microphones often fail to capture crowd noise properly.Others said the toss usually happens when many fans are still entering the ground, so the stands are not always full or loud. A few also felt that the crowd may not have clearly heard Raja’s request.Ramiz Raja has been a familiar voice in cricket for many years.Despite the brief embarrassment, the incident has not affected his reputation.","Former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja had an awkward moment during a Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) 2025–26 match.

Shubman Gill on missed chances, fielding lapses & World Cup preparation after ODI series loss

Poll Is it time for India to explore new talents in ODIs over seniors? Yes, fresh blood is needed. No, experience matters. A mix of both would be ideal. It depends on performance.

INDORE: India’s maiden ODI home series defeat to New Zealand here at the Holkar Stadium saw Virat Kohli, who smashed 124 off 108 balls in the last match, come out with flying colours. However, two other ageing modern-day greats are firmly under the scanner. Ravindra Jadeja and Rohit Sharma had a poor series, which doesn’t help with younger options snapping at their heels.The 37-year-old Jadeja went wicketless. In fact, in his last five ODIs, the Saurashtra allrounder has only managed to take one wicket. Jadeja’s leftarm spin, which once both stopped the run flow and provided crucial breakthroughs, seems to have lost its bite. Remember, T20I vice-captain Axar Patel , a like-for-like replacement, is waiting in the wings.Sreevats Goswami, who shared the dressing room with Jadeja in the 2008 U-19 World Cup that India won under Virat Kohli’s leadership, even posted on social media that the third ODI against New Zealand may well have been Jadeja’s last in the 50-over format. “We should celebrate him before he silently exits, because India play their next ODI only in June against England in England,” Goswami posted.Apart from his bowling, Jadeja has failed to make any significant contribution with the bat as well.Jadeja and fellow spinner Kuldeep Yadav’s inability to grab wickets in the middleovers was one of the key reasons for India being vanquished 2-1 by the Black Caps.Meanwhile, the debate around whether Rohit would play in the 2027 ODI World Cup was supposed to have ended after he put together a series of good scores against Australia (away) and then South Africa (home). That run included a match-winning century (121*) against Australia in Sydney, apart from three fifties. One even got to see a slimmed-down version of Rohit, indicating that he had worked a lot on his fitness.The 38-year-old’s decision to continue in ODIs has meant that left-hander Yashavi Jaiswal, who scored his maiden ODI century in the third ODI against South Africa in Vizag last Dec, has had to cool his heels in the dugout.Rohit will turn 39 on April 30 and is he motivated enough to keep playing only one format in international cricket?However, captain Shubman Gill defended his opening partner, saying, “Rohit is in terrific form, right through from the Australia to the South Africa series. You won’t always be able to convert the starts that you get.”","Ravindra Jadeja and Rohit Sharma had a poor series, which doesn't help with younger options snapping at their heels.

Shubman Gill on missed chances, fielding lapses & World Cup preparation after ODI series loss

Poll How do you feel about the removal of the Grade A+ category affecting players like Kohli and Rohit? It's unfair to senior players. It's a reasonable adjustment. I have mixed feelings about it. I support the change.

NEW DELHI: The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) is set to make a major overhaul in its Annual Central Contracts system, with sweeping changes that could significantly reshape the hierarchy of Indian cricket’s elite players. As per an ANI report citing sources within the BCCI, the selection committee has proposed doing away with the prestigious Grade A+ category altogether, a move that would directly impact senior stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.The proposal, put forward by the Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee, recommends restructuring the contracts into just three categories — A, B and C — instead of the current four-tier system. As per sources familiar with the discussions, the A+ category, which currently carries an annual retainer of Rs 7 crore, is likely to be scrapped if the model receives approval from the BCCI’s apex council.“If the new structure is cleared, players will be grouped based on current format involvement rather than stature or legacy,” a BCCI official was quoted by ANI on condition of anonymity. Under the proposed framework, Kohli and Rohit — who are now active only in ODIs — are expected to be placed in Grade B, which currently carries a retainer of Rs 3 crore.The apex council is expected to deliberate on the proposal in its next meeting, where clarity will also emerge on whether the monetary slabs will be revised along with the structural changes. “Nothing is final yet, but there is a clear intent to align contracts with workload, formats played and future planning,” another senior BCCI source added.The existing 2024-25 central contracts list, announced in April 2025, featured Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ravindra Jadeja and Jasprit Bumrah in Grade A+. Grade A included Mohammed Siraj, KL Rahul, Shubman Gill, Hardik Pandya , Mohammed Shami and Rishabh Pant, while Grade B housed players such as Suryakumar Yadav, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shreyas Iyer. A large pool of emerging players were placed in Grade C.Central contracts are annual retainers paid in addition to match fees and serve as both financial security and an indicator of a player’s standing in the national setup.","The Board of Control for Cricket in India is set to make a major overhaul in its Annual Central Contracts system.

India’s designated No. 3 in T20Is, Tilak Varma, is set to reach the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence (CoE) on Tuesday, TimesofIndia.com has learnt.Tilak has been ruled out of the first three T20Is against New Zealand, starting Wednesday, after undergoing surgery in Rajkot for an abdominal issue a couple of weeks ago during the Vijay Hazare Trophy.TimesofIndia.com also understands that India’s Asia Cup hero is not feeling any pain and is heading to the CoE for a fitness test and further assessment to get Return to Play.“If everything goes well, he will be fit before the fourth T20I on January 28 in Visakhapatnam. He has resumed physical training and, in a day or two, will start batting and other skill-based activities,” a source tracking developments told TimesofIndia.com.After playing the T20I series against South Africa in December, Tilak led Hyderabad in two 50-over matches at the Vijay Hazare Trophy. He scored 109 against Chandigarh on January 3 and followed it up with 34 against Bengal on January 6. It was after this match that Tilak experienced pain and was immediately advised to undergo scans.India’s ODI vice-captain and Punjab Kings skipper Shreyas Iyer has been added to the squad for the first three matches, as Tilak has not been ruled out of the entire series.Iyer last played a T20I in December 2023 against Australia at home and had since fallen out of India’s T20I plans. He has not featured in any T20s since last year’s IPL final, missed the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy while recovering from a spleen injury, but returned for the Vijay Hazare Trophy and also featured in the recently concluded ODI series against New Zealand.Tilak has been a key member of India’s T20I setup over the past year.

Pune Headlines Today — Key Stories You Shouldn’t Miss.







PUNE: A debacle in the PMC election has posed a tough revival challenge before both factions of Shiv Sena and Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS).Deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde's Sena and MNS did not win a single seat, while Shiv Sena (UBT) won only one seat in the PMC poll where 165 corporators were elected from 41 wards. Moreover, the city unit chiefs of all three parties lost their battles in their respective wards to their opponents.Shinde Sena's city chief Nana Bhangire was defeated in Mohammadwadi-Undri ward by an NCP candidate, while MNS head Sainath Babar was defeated in Kondhwa-Kausarbaug ward by a Congress nominee. Shiv Sena (UBT)'s city head Sanjay More was defeated in Raviwar Peth-Nana Peth ward. A lone corporator, Nitin Gawde of Shiv Sena (UBT), entered PMC from Hadapsar-Satavwadi ward.Sources from the city's political circle said Shiv Sena and MNS faced their worst defeats in the recent PMC polls.A united Sena won 10 seats in the 2017 civic polls, while MNS clinched victory in two seats. After the split in the Sena, most corporators decided to remain with Uddhav Thackeray.Later, they all jumped to other parties, leaving Shiv Sena (UBT) without a single former corporator before the election. In Shinde's camp, Bhangire was the only former corporator besides Aba Bagul, who joined Sena from Congress ahead of the polls.Sources said lack of active campaigning by the state leadership of both parties hampered their performances. The campaigning failed to gather pace, and both parties lacked strong candidates. Shinde's Sena was in discussions with the BJP until the last day for seat sharing.The party demanded at least 25 seats from the BJP in a pre-poll alliance, but talks failed, and with few hours before the deadline for filing nominations, the party decided to go solo. This gamble did not work in its favour.MNS contested as many as 44 seats. Raj Thackeray campaigned towards the end, but the party's candidates failed to perform.The Sena (UBT) fought the polls jointly with Congress, but despite the alliance, the party failed to gather support from voters.On the other hand, Congress came up with a better performance, winning 15 seats, compared with its 2017 performance when it won only nine seats.",Deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde's Sena and MNS did not win a single seat.

, Giannis, Curry, Jokić… the league’s fresh faces are dominating headlines and votes Format changes – the All-Star Game now mixes U.S. vs World and other tweaks that can shake up traditional fan favorites







Fans react as an era quietly closes

buzzing

If you grew up watching the NBA in the 2000s, you basically grew up with LeBron James starting every All-Star Game. For 21 consecutive years, LeBron was the starter fans, players, and media voted onto the court, making the NBA All-Star Game feel like his personal stage. But now? That streak has officially come to an end.Yes, you read that right, 21 straight seasons as an All-Star starter and the 2026 fan voting results finally broke the streak. It’s a reminder that even the longest eras eventually end.To be clear, LeBron’s All-Star starter streak is over but this doesn’t necessarily mean he won’t be at the game at all. The distinction here is “starter.” LeBron could still be selected as a reserve but he won’t kick off the All-Star Game as part of the starting five, something he’s done every single year since 2005.So no, LeBron isn’t “out of the game,” but the era of him automatically being the starting face of the All-Star Game is officially behind us.So why did the streak end after 21 years? A few things are at play:It’s not about LeBron declining, it’s about the league evolving and new stars taking the spotlight. And honestly? It’s kind of poetic. The NBA is literally passing the torch while we’re all watching.Twitter and X are. Fans are realizing that this is one of those “you’ll never see it again” moments.People who’ve grown up seeing LeBron start every All-Star Game are now getting a rare taste of transition.But even without starting, LeBron’s impact and legacy are untouchable. The streak ending doesn’t take away from 21 years of domination and consistency. If anything, it makes it feel even more historic.The streak ending is a reminder that every era has a chapter. LeBron’s streak was iconic, almost mythical. And while it’s officially over, he’s still LeBron, still making history, still a reason the NBA is must-watch.So yeah, the starter streak is gone, but the King? He’s still sitting on his throne.","For 21 consecutive years, LeBron James was the starter in the NBA All-Star Game. That streak has officially come to an end.

San Antonio Spurs vs Utah Jazz: Game Overview (January 19, 2026)

Matchups to Watch Tonight

What This Game Means

San Antonio Spurs welcome the Utah Jazz to the Frost Bank Center on January 19, 2026, with all signs pointing toand in the starting five. He isn’t listed on the injury report, and there are no indications of any minutes restriction.The Spurs come into the matchup playing solid basketball, while the Jazz are still trying to find their footing in what has been a rough season. With the teams trending in opposite directions, how cleanly each side executes and who shows up early could shape the game before it ever settles in.There are no indications that Victor Wembanyama will miss this game. Recent previews list him in the starting lineup, and no current injury concerns are attached to his name. A minor knee issue mentioned earlier in the month is no longer part of the conversation.Wembanyama is projected to record around 26 points, 11 rebounds, and four assists. Those numbers follow a recent 39-point performance and reflect his consistent role as the Spurs’ main scoring option and defensive anchor.San Antonio enters the matchup at 29–13 and has been difficult to beat at home all season. Tip-off is set for 5:00 PM ET.The Spurs have leaned on their size and defense, paired with efficient scoring, to stay in control of games, especially when facing teams lower in the standings.The Utah Jazz arrive with a 14-28 record and sit near the bottom of the Western Conference. While Utah remains competitive in stretches, closing games has been a recurring issue.San Antonio Spurs hold a clear advantage in the frontcourt. Wembanyama’s presence around the rim creates problems on both ends, especially against a Jazz lineup still adjusting defensively. Utah is expected to lean on Jusuf Nurkic inside, while Keyonte George carries most of the scoring load on the perimeter.George is projected to finish in the low-20s, around 22 points, but Utah continues to struggle to find steady scoring beyond him. San Antonio holds the edge in most game projections, thanks to better depth and a more reliable offense, especially around the rim where the Spurs have consistently been more efficient.Fresh off earning his first NBA All-Star starting nod, Wembanyama gets another opportunity to underline why he belongs in that spotlight. His value isn’t limited to points on the board. His presence on the glass and his shot-blocking change how teams attack, often forcing opponents to second-guess shots they would normally take.For San Antonio, this game is about holding ground in the Western Conference and handling business at home. For Utah, it is another measuring stick against a team that knows what it wants to do, led by a player who dictates the flow whenever he is on the floor.","San Antonio Spurs welcome the Utah Jazz to the Frost Bank Center on January 19, 2026.

From Olympic gold to global business icon, Anthony Joshua's financial journey



Anthony Joshua has turned his boxing success into a legacy. From Olympic hero to global superstar, his rise over the past decade has been steady and powerful. Now, the British star is not only known for knockouts. He is also known for smart contracts, big-brand deals, and careful business moves. His net worth growth reflects consistency at the top level of sport.As of now, Anthony Joshua’s estimated net worth stands at around $150 million (per celebrity net worth). Some reports suggest it could rise closer to $200 million after his recent mega fights. His paycheques come from huge fight purses, global endorsements, and business investments. Joshua is now one of the richest boxers in the world.Anthony Joshua’s big payday journey began after his gold medal win at the 2012 London Olympics. By 2016, his professional career was booming. He won world titles and quickly became a box office star. His early title fights earned him millions and pushed his net worth into the tens of millions.The defining moment came in April 2017. Joshua defeated Wladimir Klitschko at Wembley Stadium.The fight made him a global name. It also delivered one of his first massive paydays. From that point, Joshua became a stadium fighter who could sell out any venue.Between 2017 and 2018, Joshua defended his titles against Carlos Takam, Joseph Parker, and Alexander Povetkin. Each fight brought eight-figure earnings. Sponsors followed. Brands like Under Armour, Beats by Dre, and Hugo Boss signed major deals with him. His clean image and athletic build made him highly marketable.In 2019, Joshua reached a financial peak. Although he lost to Andy Ruiz Jr. in June, the rematch later that year changed everything. He earned a reported $57.5 million in Saudi Arabia. This became the biggest payday of his career at the time. His net worth jumped sharply after that fight.Anthony Joshua faced setbacks in 2021 and 2022 with losses to Oleksandr Usyk. Still, the money kept flowing. His second fight against Usyk alone earned him over $40 million. Even in defeat, Joshua remained one of boxing’s highest-paid stars.From 2023 onward, Anthony Joshua rebuilt both his career and brand. Wins over Jermaine Franklin and Robert Helenius kept him active. In March 2024, he knocked out Francis Ngannou and earned around $50 million. This single fight added significantly to his wealth.By late 2025, reports claimed Joshua had earned over $195 million in total career income. His December 2025 fight vs Jake Paul was another big payday. This pushed his net worth toward $150 million.Outside the ring, Joshua has invested in real estate and business ventures through his company, 258 Group. These assets give him income beyond boxing. From 2016 to 2026, Anthony Joshua built his net worth with power and smart planning.Also Read: Kamaru Usman faces fans wrath after he releases video of Anthony Joshua’s emotional private call after tragic Nigeria crash","Anthony Joshua is one of the richest boxers in the world.

The locker-room video that instantly went viral after Shams shared it

Why Nikola Jokić and the Quesarito have been linked for over a decade

Some NBA storylines take years to make sense and this one is a classic example of that. Nikola Jokić finally eating a Quesarito is apparently one of them. A locker-room video shared by Shams Charania has sent NBA fans into disbelief after showing the Nuggets star casually eating the infamous Taco Bell item that has followed him since draft night. What started as a long-running internet joke has now turned into a real, viral moment and the NBA internet is having a field day with it.In the clip circulated by Shams, Jokić is seen in the locker room calmly eating a Quesarito, showing no concern for the cultural earthquake it was about to cause online. No announcement. No dramatic reveal. Just Jokić, food in hand, doing what fans were convinced he would never do.Within minutes of being shared, the video spread online with fans reacting as if a major NBA mystery had finally been solved.To understand why this moment matters, you have to go back to the 2014 NBA Draft. Jokić was selected during a Taco Bell commercial promoting the Quesarito, a coincidence that became legendary once he turned into a two-time MVP and one of the best players in the league.Over the years, Jokić has openly said he never ate Taco Bell which only strengthened the myth. The Quesarito became shorthand for one of the strangest draft-night moments in NBA history, and fans treated the idea of Jokić actually eating one as something that would never happen.Until now.The fact that Shams Charania shared this, makes it even more fun. NBA fans are used to Shams breaking news about trades, injuries, and signings not locker-room food moments. That contrast is exactly why the internet ran with it.Part of why this resonated so strongly is because it fits Jokić perfectly. He has always been known for being low-key, uninterested in hype and unintentionally hilarious without trying to be.Seeing him finally eat the Quesarito felt like the closing chapter of an inside joke the NBA has shared for more than a decade.Also read - Ja Morant and Vince Williams Jr. seen arguing during Grizzlies Germany practice — what’s behind it?",Nikola Jokić has been linked with the Quesarito for over a decade.
