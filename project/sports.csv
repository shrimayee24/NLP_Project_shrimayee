The Human Toll: A Ghost Killed Those Children?

A police bulldozer is used to uncover a drain to search for bodies, outside a house in Noida on the outskirts of New Delhi, on December 29, 2006. The police has arrested two men after recovering from a drain, parts of 15 skeletons of girls and boys behind an industrialist's house. The caretaker of the house Subhash alias Surendra reportedly told the cops he had been sexually abusing and strangulating his victims before disposing of their bodies in the drain.

The Culmination

The painful truths

Investigative systems can fail, especially when constrained by corruption, negligence, or lack of urgency.

Evidence matters, but how it's collected — and whether due process is followed — can make or break a case.

Confession is a double-edged sword: powerful, but only if obtained fairly and documented properly.

NOIDA/NEW DELHI: For years, the narrow lanes of Nithari whispered the same story: children vanished, one after another, swallowed by a darkness no one could name.Inside D-5, where life seemed ordinary from the outside, investigators later uncovered fragments of a nightmare scattered through drains, courtyards and rooms that refused to give up their truth.Two decades on, Nithari remains less a crime scene and more a wound — a place where every unanswered question still walks the streets.The Nithari case remains one of country's most chilling and controversial serial-killing episodes. It centers around Bungalow D-5 in Nithari village, Noida and involves two men — the homeowner, Moninder Singh Pandher and his domestic helper, Surinder Koli The macabre tale that unfolded over years involved skeletal remains in drains, allegations of rape, murder, necrophilia, and organ trading — and a deeply flawed investigation that has haunted the judicial process for nearly two decades.The nightmare began in May 2006, when Nand Lal , father of a 22-year-old woman named Payal (also known as Deepika), reported her missing.Payal had visited Pandher’s bungalow D-5 in Sector 31, Nithari, allegedly to talk about a job for her brother — but she never returned.It was later reported that Koli had called her from a public phone booth.Despite the serious nature of the disappearance, the police response was strikingly delayed.According to a former investigator (then sub-inspector, later DSP), no FIR was registered for months.It was only after a court application under Section 156(3) of the CrPC, filed by Nand Lal, that an FIR was formally lodged on October 7, 2006 — nearly five months after Payal vanished.Things took a horrifying turn on December 29, 2006, when investigators discovered eight skeletal remains in a roadside drain next to the D-5 bungalow.This grim find, lead to the arrest of both Koli and Pandher. Within days, more bone fragments were unearthed in and around the drainage system.The discovery shook the nation and exposed the full extent of what had been a series of missing persons — children and young women — in and around Nithari.The initial investigation by the Uttar Pradesh Police came under criticism almost immediately. According to the first investigator, crucial delays had allowed the case to spiral: The FIR was filed only after months of pressure, and formal search operations began six months too late.These early lapses, he said, sowed the seeds of deeper problems.By January 10, 2007, due to mounting public outrage and the scale of the horror, the case was handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Within days, CBI teams conducted intensive searches around the bungalow and adjoining areas, recovering more human remains — skulls, bone pieces and dismembered body parts.The sheer scale of recovered remains made it difficult even for the investigators to determine how many victims there might have been.In the early months of the investigation, charge sheets were filed in 16 cases, spanning accusations of murder, rape, abduction, criminal conspiracy, destruction of evidence and more.On March 1, 2007, Koli made a highly detailed recorded confession.He reportedly admitted to murdering six children and one woman. He described luring them into the bungalow, strangling them, sexually abusing the bodies, dismembering them and discarding the remains in drains.He also made claims of cannibalism, stating that he sometimes cooked and ate flesh from the victims.The case proceeded in a special CBI court in Ghaziabad, and on February 13, 2009, both Koli and Pandher were sentenced to death in the first case.The trial court would go on to deliver verdicts over many years, across multiple hearings, more than 2,000 hearings were held during this prolonged trial.Koli was eventually convicted in 13 cases by the trial court and awarded death sentences in all, though one of these was commuted to life imprisonment.In a later case (May 2022), a special CBI court awarded him another death sentence for the rape and murder of a woman.While the trial court’s judgments were gruesome and seemed to close the case, the story was far from over.On September 11, 2009, the Allahabad high court delivered a big verdict: While upholding Koli’s death sentence, it acquitted Pandher in at least one prominent case, citing “no evidence” against him.Over time, Koli’s legal team mounted a fierce appeal. On October 16, 2023, in a landmark decision, the Allahabad high court acquitted Koli in 12 of the death-sentence cases and Pandher in two, overturning the trial court’s verdicts.The court did not mince words: It stated that the investigation had been botched up and that “basic norms of collecting evidence were brazenly violated.”A particularly scathing point in the high court’s judgment was the failure to probe possible organ trade — an angle raised by a high-level committee from the Ministry of Women and Child Development.Investigators, the court said, “opted for the easy course” by pinning blame on Koli and demonising him, instead of exploring deeper and more alarming conspiracies.The court also questioned the credibility of Koli’s confession. It noted procedural irregularities: the confession was allegedly recorded 60 days into police remand, yet there was no medical examination or independent witness.Moreover, the court highlighted contradictions in prosecution testimony about where and when the confession was made.Recovery of skeletal remains, according to the court, came from a drain outside the boundaries of Pandher’s house — not from inside, as had often been claimed.Ultimately, the court declared that the guilt of Koli and Pandher had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt, particularly because the case rested largely on circumstantial evidence.The judgment drew sharp criticism from victim families, who saw it as a deep betrayal after nearly two decades of pursuing justice.Following the high court’s 2023 acquittal, Moninder Singh Pandher was released from Luksar Jail on October 20, 2023, after spending 14 years behind bars.Surinder Koli, meanwhile, was not immediately freed — he continued to serve a life sentence in a separate conviction.But his legal fight was not over.In July 2025, the Supreme Court upheld the Allahabad HC’s acquittal of Koli in the 12 previously overturned cases. The apex court ruled that police lapses had rendered crucial evidence inadmissible.Then, on November 11, 2025, in a decisive moment, the Supreme Court accepted Koli’s curative plea (his last judicial recourse), acquitted him in the final pending case (Rimpa Haldar case) and ordered his immediate release.The man once dubbed the “Nithari killer” has now been acquitted in all major Nithari murder cases.When word of his acquittal reached his barrack, Koli had remained seated for some time, staring at the floor. Then a faint smile crossed his face. “He was relaxed, and there was a smile on his face,” a senior jail official told TOI.While Koli did give a detailed confession, the courts later scrutinised the conditions of its recording, It came long into police custody, without independent witnesses, and with no medical examination — casting shadows on its voluntariness and authenticity.Perhaps most damning was the court’s assertion that organ trade – a horrifying, but plausible, motive – was not properly probed.The investigation, according to the HC, seemed to choose the less difficult path of blaming a single man rather than confronting possible organised crime.One sacked officer, Simranjeet Kaur was arrested by the CBI in 2007 for allegedly framing false records to protect Pandher and Koli, having received payments.The mysterious death of a key witness, Jatin Sarkar, whose daughter was among the missing. His body was later found in a pond in Bengal.Parents of missing children watched as time passed with no clear answers. The high court’s 2023 acquittals were met with “dejection” by many, signaling that legal closure did not equal emotional closure.The community around Nithari, once traumatised by the gruesome revelations, still remembers the D-5 bungalow as a somber landmark.The Supreme Court’s acquittal in the 13th, and final, case against Koli left the families devastated.A 63-year-old Jhabbu Lal and his wife Sunita (60) continued seeking justice for their daughter Jyoti — one of the children who went missing in 2006 and was later found among the Nithari victims.“I had six children, and the fifth was Jyoti. She went missing in 2006,” Lal recalled, his voice shaking. “Her body was later found in the drain outside house number D5 (Moninder Pandher's bungalow where Koli worked).”Lal spent decades fighting in courts, selling valuables and even a house in Sangam Vihar, Delhi, to fund the case.Lal said, “If he didn’t commit the crime, then who did? If he is freed, that means someone else killed our children. Why was Koli kept behind bars for so many years?”Sunita Lal added, “Even after all these years, the pain hasn’t faded. Every time I pass that bungalow, it feels like I’m standing at the same place where my world ended. We never got our child back — only the memories and a lifetime of waiting for justice.”Another mother of a deceased said ""Moninder (Moninder Singh Pandher) and Surinder Koli, killed so many children. But the case is not being done anything about. Who is guilty now? Was there a ghost in that house which killed all children? They used to kill children and indulge in organ trafficking. Now they say that they are innocent. Law is letting them go; God won't.""When the Supreme Court finally granted his curative petition in November 2025 and ordered his immediate release, it marked the end of a long, fraught journey.The ruling underscored deep flaws in the original investigation: procedural lapses, contested confessions and weak evidence.Moninder Pandher, too, walked free earlier when the high court acquitted him.It was noted that during his release in October 2023, Pandher was frail, battling health issues including tuberculosis.The bungalow D-5, once infamous, now lies overgrown and decaying — a ghostly testament to the violence that took place there.Even when courts finally render a verdict, emotional justice may remain elusive for victims and their families.The Nithari killings case, is more than a crime story; it is a mirror to systemic failures, a cautionary tale about investigative hubris, and a study in how the quest for justice can stretch over decades.The courtroom battles — convictions, acquittals and final release — have reshaped public memory of D-5 bungalow.But the wounds remain: for the families who lost children, for a village scarred by horror, and for a nation forced to reckon with how easily its systems can be outpaced by darkness.","Nithari case remains one of country's most chilling and controversial serial- killing episodes.

Insult meted out to my sister is intolerable: Tej Pratap

PATNA/NEW DELHI: RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad's daughter Rohini Acharya's outburst at her brother Tejashwi Yadav and his close associates for ""abusing"" and ""throwing"" her out of home is snowballing into a full-blown family feud and hints at increasing internal rumblings over the decisions of the party's anointed heir after its bid for office unravelled spectacularly in the assembly polls.As she dropped another bombshell on Sunday by saying she was dissed for donating her ""dirty kidney"" to Lalu and was accused of extracting crores of rupees and a Lok Sabha ticket, three of her sisters - Ragini, Chanda and Rajlakshmi - left their parents' Patna residence.Their brother Tej Pratap Yadav, disowned by his father and ousted from the party last year, spoke up against Rohini's ""humiliation"".Lalu, his younger son and political heir Tejashwi and other family members have maintained silence, an indication of the division and conflicted emotions within. The party too has kept mum.Some party leaders suggested that differences among the siblings have long been simmering as Tejashwi took firmer control of the party and leaned on a set of advisers loyal to him to run its affairs. That arrangement has come up for questioning.But the Bihar assembly poll debacle has opened up this style of functioning to questioning. Rohini said everybody is wondering what fate has befallen RJD, a party that governed Bihar between 1990 and 2005.Tej Pratap said in a social media post, ""Yesterday's incident has shaken me. But the insult meted out to my sister is intolerable.""I tolerated whatever happened to me but her humiliation cannot be tolerated under any condition... The consequence of this injustice will be very dire.""He accused 'Jaichands' (betrayers), widely believed to be a reference to a couple of Tejashwi's close associates, including Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Yadav, of targeting the Yadav family. Appealing to Lalu, he said, ""Just one nod, and the people of Bihar will bury these Jaichands themselves. This fight is not for any party; it is for the honour of the family, the dignity of the daughter, and the self-respect of Bihar.""As the family fallout played out, TV footage showed three more daughters of Lalu's reaching Patna airport with their children to catch a flight, reportedly for Delhi. None of them spoke to the media. Incidentally, their departure came hours after Rohini advised women to ""look after your in-laws and families and take care of your children"" rather than parents.""I would tell all married women never to do anything to save their parents, and if they have a brother, they should ask him to donate his own kidney or ask his Haryanavi friend to do so,"" she said in an emotional post. She said she had committed a blunder by not obtaining permission from her husband and in-laws and not thinking about the future of her three children before donating a kidney to her father.Earlier, she alleged she was humiliated and abused, and a slipper was lifted to hit her. She said her parents, Lalu and Rabri Devi, both former CMs, were crying and blamed Sanjay Yadav and Rameez Nemat Khan, who hails from Uttar Pradesh and is said to be Tejashwi's friend, for her ""fate"".She named her brother too but directed most of her anger at his two associates.The developments followed RJD's disastrous performance in the just-held assembly elections in Bihar, in which the party could win only 25 seats after contesting 143. Tejashwi was officially projected as MGB's chief ministerial candidate.Meanwhile, the JD(U) asked Lalu to explain the developments and act. ""She is the daughter of entire Bihar, then why are you silent, Lalu ji... Please break your silence,"" JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said.","Rohini Acharya's outburst at her brother Tejashwi Yadav is snowballing into a full-blown family feud.

PM Modi Predicts Major Congress Split After NDA’s Bihar Win And Warns Allies Of Growing Instability

NEW DELHI: Lalu Prasad Yadav 's daughter Rohini Acharya, who disowned the family after RJD's Bihar poll debacle, took another potshot at brother Tejashwi Yadav , saying those who called her kidney ""impure"" should first ""donate their kidneys in his (Lalu's) name"" to the needy.Rohini said those who claim to do things in Lalu Yadav's name should ""stop offering false sympathy and instead step forward to donate their kidneys to the lakhs of poor patients in hospitals who are counting their final breaths for want of one"".""If they truly care about Lalu Ji, they should donate their kidneys in his name,"" she said in a dig at Tejashwi, who is RJD's heir apparent. Rohini also challenged Tejashwi to ""gather the courage to debate her openly on a public platform"".""Those who criticised a married daughter for donating her kidney to her father should gather the courage to debate her openly on a public platform,"" she said.Lalu's daughter also lashed out at Tejahswi's close aide, Sanjay Yadav, whom she called ""Haryanvi Mahapurush"" and accused ""Haryanvi troll armies"" of endlessly abusing her.""Let the act of this supreme donation, giving a kidney to someone in need, begin with those who called the daughter’s kidney ""impure.”Then let the so-called 'Haryanvi Mahapurush' come forward, followed by the pliant journalists and the Haryanvi troll armies who endlessly abuse me.

They are the ones who have expelled me from the family because they don’t want to take responsibility,” she told reporters.“The whole world is saying that we will ask questions to whoever becomes Chanakya. The party workers are asking Chanakya why the RJD has reached this state. If Sanjay, Rameez’s name is taken, you will be thrown out of the house and defamed. You will also be hit with slippers,” she added.Her remarks echoed the frustration she had earlier expressed in a social media post announcing that she was quitting politics and “disowning” her family.Hours after announcing publicly that she had severed ties with her family, Lalu Prasad Yadav’s daughter, Rohini Acharya, claimed she was ""thrown out"" by her brother, Tejashwi Yadav, and his close aides, Sanjay Yadav and Rameez.Speaking on the Rashtriya Janata Dal 's (RJD) humiliating defeat in the Bihar assembly polls, Rohini said she was ""disgraced, abused, and even hit"" when she questioned Sanjay Yadav and Rameez.Later, Tej Pratap Yadav launched a strong attack on individuals within his family and RJD, accusing them of acting like “traitors” and warning that he would not accept any insult directed at his sister.In a post shared on his Janshakti Janta Dal party’s Instagram account, Tej Pratap warned those he described as “traitors” and made a heartfelt appeal to his father, Lalu Prasad Yadav.“Yesterday’s incident has shaken me to the core. What happened to me — I endured it. But the insult done to my sister is absolutely unbearable under any circumstances,” he wrote, adding: “Listen, traitors— If you target our family, the people of Bihar will never forgive you. When the emotions of the people are wounded, the dust covering their judgment is blown away.”The RJD, which was the largest party in the Mahagathbandhan, saw its tally collapse from 75 to just 25 seats -- one of its most disappointing performances since 2010. The dramatic slide, which resulted in the loss of over 100 seats to NDA allies, came despite the coalition uniting behind Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial face.","Rohini Acharya says those who called her kidney ""impure"" should first ""donate their kidneys in his (Lalu's) name"" to the needy.

Gisele Bündchen's shifting balance between support, career and self-fulfillment

Moving from high-stakes partnership to reinventing life on her own terms





In her March 2023 interview with Vanity Fair, supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, how their lives evolved, and what she discovered in the space that followed. While details of their split had played out in headlines, Bündchen offered fresh context and a more nuanced perspective.Gisele Bündchen admitted that the marriage was “like a death and a rebirth,” and described her own shift from supporting a partner’s career to rediscovering her personal dreams. Her reflections reveal not just a high-profile breakup, but a woman reclaiming her voice and defining success on her own terms.When Gisele Bündchen met Tom Brady at age 26, she said she was, “so ready” for family and partnership. Traditionally one of the world’s highest-earning models, she gradually scaled back her runway work after 2015 to support the family life they were building.Gisele Bündchen describes relocating to Tampa without ever having lived there before, “When we moved to Tampa, I actually had never been there before. I just arrived and that was my life.”Yet despite her enormous success, much of the public narrative painted her as “against football” or overshadowed by Brady’s career, a portrayal she calls “very hurtful” and “the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”Gisele Bündchen underscores that marriage didn’t unravel overnight. “That takes years to happen.” As she puts it, “Sometimes you grow together; sometimes you grow apart … When you love someone, you don’t put them in a jail and say, ‘You have to live this life.’ You set them free to be who they are.”Gisele Bündchen's message: supporting someone doesn’t mean losing yourself, and that truth became clearer to her as her kids grew and her dreams quietly changed..Today, Gisele Bündchen speaks of her next act in Costa Rica, building a home, raising her children, and exploring wellness and nature far from red carpets. She asserts, “I have my own dreams..”While Tom Brady continued his historic career, Bündchen’s focus shifted inward. She embraced spiritual practices, daily rituals, and the idea that success is not just professional acclaim but authenticity and fulfillment. She says the breakup felt like both a loss and a liberation, “I believed in fairy tales when I was a kid. I think it’s beautiful to believe in that.”Gisele Bündchen's reflection on Brady is remarkably gracious. “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever … If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him.”In doing so, Gisele Bündchen rejects reductive headlines and stereotypes, choosing instead to present a fuller picture of love, change and self-discovery. As she said, “What’s been said is one piece of a much bigger puzzle. It’s not so black and white.”In the end, this isn’t a story solely of one of fashion’s biggest icons stepping aside. It’s the story of a woman stepping forward, redefining when a chapter ends, a new one begins..Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s post divorce evolution raises question: did Tom Brady underestimate what letting her go would cost him?","Supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady.

How Michael Irvin discovered his wife’s early-onset Alzheimer’s

“We recognized some things were going wrong with her about ten years ago… We thought it was menopause… We buried my mom. She had Alzheimer’s. My mother-in-law was living with us because she had Alzheimer’s. And now we thought my wife was going through menopause at 49 because she’s coming at 50.”

Michael Irvin On Wife Having Alzheimer's In Her 50s | CLUB SHAY SHAY

“It’s quite hard to take care of someone 24 hours a day… I have to keep a 24-hour nurse with her all the time.”

“If anyone has earned the right to stay in her house, MY WIFE HAS!!! … That I shall honour. No matter what it takes.”

Being a football legend is one thing, but facing life’s toughest plays off the field is a whole different ballgame. Michael Irvin , the iconic Dallas Cowboys wide receiver, has opened up about one of the most personal challenges of his life, his wife Sandy Harrell (née Irvin) has been diagnosed with very early-onset Alzheimer’s disease.Irvin, known for his unforgettable catches and fiery personality on the field, revealed that his wife’s symptoms first appeared around 8–10 years ago. At the time, they thought it might be normal aging or menopause but it soon became clear that something more serious was happening and it needed attention. His emotional revelation gives fans a glimpse of the human side of a public figure often celebrated for his athletic prowess.Talking candidly, Irvin shared:This initial uncertainty highlights how subtle the early signs ofcan be especially in someone so young. Very early-onset Alzheimer’s (diagnosed under 65) is rare, and Irvin’s story shows the complex emotions families face when symptoms first appear.Irvin didn’t shy away from describing the realities of caring for his wife:Balancing the responsibilities of caregiving with his public life has been a profound challenge. Yet, Irvin’s dedication never wavered. He emphasizes the emotional labor behind every decision, reflecting a side of him fans rarely see, the deep and unwavering devotion of a husband navigating one of life’s hardest battles.For Michael Irvin, the focus has always been on Sandy’s comfort and dignity. He explained :Rather than placing her in a facility, the couple relies on a live-in caregiver to ensure Sandy remains in the home they built together. This choice underscores both love and respect, showing that Irvin’s heroics aren’t just on the football field they’re at home, too.Michael Irvin’s story is a reminder that real strength often comes in quiet, daily acts of love and care. Through sleepless nights, emotional trials, and public attention, he stands by Sandy, determined to honor her wishes and protect her dignity.

Golden State Warriors’ Injury Report vs the Orlando Magic (November 18, 2025)

Orlando Magic’s Injury Concerns vs the Golden State Warriors (November 18, 2025)

How the Injuries Could Shape the Game

Thewill meet on November 18, 2025, in a regular-season clash that will be shaped heavily by injuries on both sides. As both teams head into a demanding stretch of the NBA calendar, the absence of key contributors will add intrigue to a matchup already fueled by contrasting styles - Golden State’s perimeter-oriented offense versus Orlando’s evolving defensive identity.With several rotational players sidelined, the contest is expected to become a test of depth, adaptability, and coaching adjustments. Both teams will be forced to redistribute responsibilities, lean on unexpected contributors, and rely on their established stars to steady the pace. Understanding the injury landscape on both sides helps explain how the game may unfold and why certain matchups could become more important than usual.The Golden State Warriors will enter the night dealing with multiple absences that may influence their game plan. Jonathan Kuminga, sidelined due to bilateral knee patellar tendonitis, is expected to miss the game entirely as he continues managing a persistent condition that has affected his mobility and availability throughout the season. His absence will remove one of Golden State’s most athletic two-way options on the wing.De’Anthony Melton will also be unavailable while recovering from left ACL surgery, thinning the Golden State Warriors’ backcourt depth and removing a strong defensive presence. Buddy Hield, listed as probable as he battles an illness, adds another layer of uncertainty to Golden State’s rotation. With these gaps, the Warriors may lean more heavily on supporting pieces, including players like Moses Moody, who has stepped up in recent outings to provide scoring and perimeter defense.Orlando Magic will enter the matchup with its own list of critical injuries. Paolo Banchero, the team’s rising star forward, is expected to remain out with a left groin strain, marking his third consecutive missed game. His absence will weaken both the Magic’s offense and interior defense. Jalen Suggs is questionable due to right groin soreness and is considered close to a return, though final availability will be confirmed before tip-off.The Orlando Magic will also be without Moritz Wagner, who continues recovering from a left knee injury, adding strain to their frontcourt rotation. Two-way players Colin Castleton and Orlando Robinson will be unavailable as well, reducing flexibility for lineup experimentation. Jamal Cain is cleared to play and is anticipated to receive increased opportunities. Franz Wagner, dealing with a recent facial injury, will be available but will require a protective mask.Also read: Is Stephen Curry playing tonight vs the Orlando Magic? Latest update on the Golden State Warriors star's injury report (November 18, 2025) Both teams are expected to feel the ripple effects of their missing players. Golden State Warriors will have to compensate for Kuminga’s athleticism and Melton’s defense, placing more pressure on their perimeter creators and bench. Orlando Magic, missing Banchero, will likely face challenges generating consistent offense but may lean on defensive effort and physicality to stay competitive. With Stephen Curry remaining the focal point for Golden State, the matchup will likely showcase how injuries can reshape an NBA game’s rhythm, strategy, and overall tone in a long, grueling season.","The Golden State Warriors and the Orlando Magic will meet on November 18, 2025, in a regular-season clash that will be shaped heavily by injuries on both sides.

Potential Concerns

Will the Trade Actually Happen?

Thehave burst out to a strong 9-3 start, winning four of their last five games, but there’s still a noticeable gap in their backcourt. With Fred VanVleet sidelined for the entire 2025-26 season due to an ACL injury, Houston is operating without a true point guard - and that absence is shaping the conversation around the team’s long-term ceiling. Amen Thompson has stepped up admirably, yet the franchise ideally wants him back in his natural off-ball role, pushing the front office to explore creative options.That exploration has led to a surprising blockbuster trade idea: reuniting Kevin Durant with NBA champion Kyrie Irving. The concept, highlighted by CBS Sports’ Sam Quinn, suggests Houston could take advantage of Dallas’ uncertainty around Irving’s future while addressing its own need for a primary playmaker. With the Rockets already thriving without VanVleet and Dorian Finney-Smith yet to suit up, the proposal is gaining attention - especially with Irving expected to return later this season from his ACL setback.The Houston Rockets are navigating the season with Amen Thompson stepping into playmaking duties, but the organization ideally wants him back in his natural off-ball role. Meanwhile, VanVleet is expected to miss the entire 2025-26 season, leaving Houston without a veteran distributor.According to CBS Sports writer Sam Quinn, Kyrie Irving stands out as a surprisingly logical target given the Rockets’ roster construction and timeline. As Quinn wrote last Thursday, “Irving’s trade value is a total mystery. There’s really only one team that makes sense, and that’s Houston, where he could reunite with Kevin Durant.” (H/t: Sporting News)Irving is currently recovering from a torn ACL but is projected to return later this season - unlike VanVleet. Even with the risk, the potential reward of pairing Irving with Durant again is enough to generate intrigue for the surging Western Conference team.Here is the structure of the hypothetical deal outlined by Quinn, which brings significant star power to the Houston Rockets without heavy disruption to their rotation:Quinn notes that the Houston Rockets “wouldn’t really miss” Finney-Smith in this scenario since the veteran forward has yet to debut for Houston this year.Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving shared the court for 2.5 seasons with the Brooklyn Nets. Although their tenure fell short of championship expectations, the duo delivered some of the most electric basketball of the early 2020s.• Irving’s elite ball-handling and shot-making• Durant’s effortless scoring from all three levels• Their ability to take over games individually or interchangeably• Ratings-friendly, highlight-heavy playstyleThe Nets didn’t capture a title or even reach the Finals during their run, but few duos matched their entertainment value or scoring chemistry.• The Rockets are winning without a true point guard• VanVleet is sidelined all season• Irving is expected to return before the playoffs• Durant benefits from high-level shot creation next to him• The Western Conference race is tightening, making veteran experience valuableIf Houston continues its strong play deep into the season, taking a calculated swing on Irving could elevate the team into legitimate contender territory.• Irving’s health following ACL recovery• Contract commitment (three years remaining, $118 million)• Team chemistry with a young core• Fit alongside Durant in a new system• Long-term flexibility versus short-term upside• A true point guard with elite scoring ability• A proven playoff performer when healthy• Immediate pressure relieved from Amen Thompson• Championship-level tandem with Durant• Availability issues• Contract size• Risk of disrupting team rhythm• Defensive liabilities in certain matchupsEverything hinges on timing. If Houston maintains its momentum and Irving nears a healthy return, the franchise may find it worthwhile to “give the former Cleveland Cavaliers star a look on the trade market,” as the original article suggests.For now, the rumor exists as an intriguing hypothetical - one that connects an overachieving young team with two aging superstars who once formed one of the league’s must-watch duos.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could sign $54 million Dallas Mavericks superstar to for deadly duo with Luka Doncic And as Sam Quinn emphasized, “They’re not going to trade Irving just to trade him. They’d have to get something of substance.” Whether Houston decides to be that team will be one of the season’s most fascinating subplots.","The Houston Rockets are off to a strong 9-3 start, but there’s still a noticeable gap in their backcourt.

Swifties think Taylor Swift’s ‘The Fate of Ophelia’ is aimed directly at Joe Alwyn

More coverage on NFL:

Taylor Swift’s latest track, “The Fate of Ophelia,” is sparking a fresh wave of online theories and Swifties are convinced she’s weaving real-life heartbreak into a Shakespeare-inspired narrative. The song, featured on The Life of a Showgirl, flips the tragic Ophelia storyline into one of revival, and fans immediately tie the imagery to Taylor’s emotional journey after her six-year relationship with Joe Alwyn.With lyrics that feel pointed, timing that feels deliberate, and symbolism that leans heavily into themes of rescue, rebirth, and choosing a new path, this track has become the latest cultural flashpoint as listeners dissect what Taylor may be saying between the lines.Swifties didn’t waste time pulling receipts. The lyric “dug me out of my grave” is being hailed as a symbolic nod to Travis, the man fans believe helped lift Taylor from the emotional stagnation she experienced during her long romance with Joe. And the shade? It’s there in sharpened form.When Taylor Swift sings, “All that time, I sat alone in my tower / You were just honing your powers,” listeners immediately connected it to Joe’s famously private lifestyle and his recent role in a new Hamlet film.The overlap between Ophelia, Hamlet, and Taylor’s real-life history is simply too on-the-nose for fans to ignore.What makes the moment hit even harder is how openly Swift seems to be reclaiming her narrative. Rather than turning her breakup into bitterness, she’s framing it as the final chapter of a darker era, one that allowed her to rise stronger and choose a love that fits her world rather than hides from it. Joe Alwyn, for his part, has subtly signaled he’s over the conversation, reportedly saying he’s moved on and suggesting fans do the same. But Swifties aren’t budging.For Swift, this track feels like a mic-drop: a poetic goodbye to the past, a wink at the present, and a reminder that she’ll always turn heartbreak into art, even if some people would prefer not to be name-checked in her mythology..","Swifties interpret lyrics about rescue and rebirth as a nod to her current relationship, contrasting it with her past.

More NFL coverage

Dak Prescott and his fiancée, Sarah Jane Ramos, are in a new chapter as parents of two daughters. Their growing family has become a steady part of the quarterback’s life as his career continues to rise. Prescott, now the highest-paid player in league history, has shown that his off-field world is just as meaningful as anything he accomplishes with the Cowboys. Ramos has been at his side through record moments, personal milestones and the joy of parenthood, shaping a partnership rooted in support and shared growth.The couple first welcomed their daughter, Margaret Jane Rose, on Leap Day in 2024. Their second daughter, Aurora Rayne, arrived in May 2025, giving them a fuller home and an even stronger bond. With each milestone, Prescott has spoken about how fatherhood changed his sense of responsibility and purpose, and Ramos has echoed the same pride and excitement as they build their life together.Ramos grew up in Tampa Bay, Florida, and stayed close to home while studying criminalistics and criminal science at Florida State University. Her early career began in hospitality before she moved into the wine industry, where she built an impressive path as a specialist and later an on-premise area manager at Southern Glazer’s Wine & Spirits.Her work placed her at the center of well-known brands like Diageo and Moet Hennessy, and she carved out a reputation for herself long before she entered the public spotlight.Sports have always been part of her life. She cheers for the Cowboys, but her heart belongs to hockey. She often celebrated the Tampa Bay Lightning and once wrote, “Waking up to a Bolts win on a Monday > 👏😍.” Ramos also enjoys golf and has shared several moments from the course, showing how much she values being active and outdoors.Ramos and Prescott were first linked in 2023 after she attended a Cowboys win over the Giants. Their relationship became public when she posted a photo hugging him in a leather Cowboys jacket. By February 2024, they welcomed MJ Rose, writing, ""MJ Rose, Being your parents is the biggest blessing life has to offer and we are so fortunate that you are ours! Welcome into this world, baby girl, you will always be loved and protected! We are so IN LOVE with you. ""Prescott later shared, ""I feel different. When you wake up in the morning and you see that baby, you understand responsibilities."" Ramos added her own joy, telling Sports Illustrated, ""I can’t wait to watch Dak become a girl dad, part two. He’s perfect. He’s the best girl dad ever.""When Aurora Rayne arrived, Prescott celebrated with, ""Thank You God! Welcome, Aurora Rayne! May 22, 2025. God is Great. I love you @sarahjane and the Family we’ve created ♥️.""Their engagement followed months later. Prescott proposed with a golf-themed surprise, saying, “Yeah I’m super excited… I got the ring a few months ago. Set it up with a couple friends. She had no idea.” He reportedly spent $1 million on a 10-karat diamond, and jeweler Jason Arasheben said, “Dak was so easy to work with and was very intentional with every detail of this ring.”Together, Prescott and Ramos have built a life that balances football, family and a deep sense of commitment. Their relationship continues to show how much strength the quarterback draws from the people closest to him.","Dak Prescott and his fiancée, Sarah Jane Ramos, are parents of two daughters.

How “Tweaker” Became a Cultural Phenomenon

GELO - Tweaker (Official Video)

Tweaker 's Chart Domination and Viral Impact on Fans

How LiAngelo Ball Went From Basketball to Music Trailblazer

LiAngelo Ball’s transformation from overlooked basketball prospect to music industry headliner has officially reached a historic milestone. His debut single “Tweaker,” released under the stage name Gelo, has achieved platinum status - an achievement that puts him in the same conversation as heavyweight artists like Drake . For an athlete-turned-musician, this level of success is both unprecedented and culturally significant, signaling a genuine crossover moment that few have ever achieved.This accomplishment not only redefines LiAngelo’s public identity but also marks the peak of a rapid rise that began in early 2025. From a player often overshadowed by his brothers Lonzo and LaMelo Ball, LiAngelo has carved out an entirely new lane, proving that his artistic instincts and musical ambition were far more than a curiosity.Released in January 2025, “Tweaker” exploded online almost instantly. Its nostalgic, bouncy beat - powered by piano, organ keys, and lush synth pads - captured the spirit of early-2000s hip-hop. Paired with Gelo’s melodic, sing-song delivery and a catchy “whoa” hook reminiscent of Big Tymers-era anthems, the track resonated widely. Produced by Kunica and Glockie Cheez, the song painted a picture of luxury, swagger, and newfound fame, creating an irresistible vibe that appealed to both younger listeners and fans of classic hip-hop aesthetics.Its momentum grew even stronger as the song spread into sports culture.NBA and NFL teams, including the Detroit Lions, Chicago Bulls, and Cleveland Cavaliers, embraced “Tweaker” as a celebratory anthem in locker rooms and warm-up sessions, pushing its reach far beyond the usual music circles.The success of “Tweaker” eventually led to a massive $13 million record deal with Def Jam and Universal Music Group. The contract included an extraordinary $8 million guaranteed signing bonus—more than what many current NBA players earn annually. This landmark deal solidified Gelo’s credibility and marketability within the hip-hop and R&B world.Adding even more momentum, a high-profile remix featuring Lil Wayne elevated the track’s status, giving it a stamp of approval from one of rap’s most influential figures.“Tweaker” made history by reaching No. 1 on the US Rhythmic Billboard chart - an exceptional feat for a debut single from a former basketball player. The song sparked viral dance trends across social platforms and earned praise from artists like T-Pain, Lil Yachty, and Joe Budden. Its appeal spanned music, sports, and online culture, cementing LiAngelo Ball as 2025’s breakout music star.Before his rise in music, LiAngelo Ball spent years navigating international basketball leagues and the NBA G-League. Eventually, he stepped away from the sport entirely - a decision validated by his explosive success. His debut album League of My Own, released in July 2025, showcased his evolution as an artist and reaffirmed his place in the industry.LiAngelo Ball’s platinum achievement for “Tweaker” is more than a win for himself - it is a defining cultural moment. By stepping into music and dominating charts, he has written a rare success story that bridges athletics, entertainment, and mainstream culture.","LiAngelo Ball’s debut single “Tweaker,” released under the stage name Gelo, has achieved platinum status.

Drake Maye fires back as Cam Newton calls Patriots’ early success ‘fool’s gold’ in bold season drama



The Patriots keep stacking wins, but not everyone is willing to celebrate their climb. Cam Newton, once the face of Carolina football and later a one-year starter in New England, is not convinced the Patriots’ 9–2 start deserves real praise. His sharp comments arrived on ESPN’s First Take after the Patriots’ 27–14 victory over the Jets, a win that tightened their grip on the AFC East. Instead of focusing on the surge behind rookie quarterback Drake Maye, Newton questioned whether the team’s rise can withstand tougher competition ahead.During the show, Newton dismissed the idea that the AFC now runs through Foxborough. He called the Patriots’ record “fool's gold,” adding an even sharper comparison. “Cubic zirconia, middle of the mall,” ranted Newton when asked if the AFC now runs through Foxborough. He acknowledged Maye’s strong play but credited it to one familiar coach. “And yes, is Drake Maye playing good football? Absolutely. And I would like to attest his great play to one specific person that I know too well, Josh McDaniels. Now, Josh McDaniels may not be a great head coach, but he is a brilliant offensive mind.”Newton later pushed further, saying, “The thing that I have a problem with. Is if you keep playing sorry scrubs, then you’re going to have this falsetto of a mentality going into the playoffs, and it has one-and-done written all over it.”Newton’s comments carried extra weight because Maye grew up admiring him in North Carolina. When Maye was asked about the criticism during his weekly radio appearance on WEEI, he brushed it off. ""Oh no, I don’t even know what show he’s on,"" Maye explained. ""I think they get paid to make remarks and make certain comments. So, I just worry about what people in our organization think, and worry about we think and what my teammates think. People are going to have different opinions. I’m just going out there on Sunday and worrying about ourselves.""Patriots coach Mike Vrabel also weighed in and refused to turn Newton’s comments into fuel. “What are we gonna do, put Cam Newton clips up there?"" he joked on WEEI's The Greg Hill Show. “We’d rather put our clips or the Bengals clips.” He added, ""Anything that anybody says, we are going to come to work, we’re going to focus on us. We’re going to try to improve, and we’re going to focus on the Bengals, and going on the road, trying to get our 10th win. ""Newton may have a point about the schedule. New England opened the season with one of the league’s easiest slates and only three of their nine wins came against teams with winning records. Still, the Patriots now control their path. With matchups against the Bengals, Giants, Bills, Ravens, Jets and Dolphins, they are chasing both a playoff return and their first division title since 2019.Also Read: Bernie Kosar shares emotional video update after life-saving liver transplant following canceled surgery and internal bleeding scare","Drake Maye and Mike Vrabel respond to Cam Newton's harsh jab at Patriots.

How did Bryce Dunlap die?

Bryce Dunlap was just 21 and hailed from Ohio, recognized by his friends as a die-hard Cleveland Browns supporter. His untimely death on November 16, 2025, has left his family and community in mourning, further complicated by the unanswered questions about what led to his health crisis. While the precise initial cause is still unclear in public discussions, family members have recounted the progression of events—from breathing difficulties to fatal brain injury—through social media and interviews.Bryce Dunlap passed away due to complications from an anoxic brain injury that followed a sudden medical emergency the week before. His stepmother, Nicole Dunlap, shared on Facebook on November 12, 2025, that Bryce became unresponsive because of respiratory distress, which quickly escalated to cardiac arrest, cutting off oxygen to his brain and leading to irreversible damage.Despite being on a ventilator and showing short-lived signs of responsiveness, such as hand squeezes, he was unable to recover. Doctors informed the family that the anoxic injury—resulting from extended oxygen deprivation—was fatal, as mentioned in a GoFundMe update by his aunt Tracy McCanna on November 17, 2025. The family has not publicly shared any underlying reasons for the initial respiratory failure, like illness or outside factors, in their statements to outlets such as Fox 8 News Cleveland.In the haze of loss, the family turned to Bryce's prior wish to donate organs, a choice that brought purpose to their pain. Discussions with LifeBanc, the nonprofit organ procurement organization serving Northeast Ohio, began immediately after his passing. It was here that the connection to Bernie Kosar emerged.Kim Kane explained the major exchange to the Fox 8 I-Team on November 18, 2025: ""My ex-husband and I looked at each other and said Bernie Kosar is going through some terrible stuff. And we said put Bernie on the list.She said, ""Are you serious and we said yeah put Bernie on the list."" The ""she"" refers to a LifeBanc representative during the consultation. Kane added, reflecting on Bryce's fandom, ""This would have meant so much to him to do something.""The liver transplant was completed successfully on Monday, November 17, 2025, with Kosar recovering well enough to post a video update from his hospital bed that afternoon. LifeBanc confirmed to Fox 8 on November 18, 2025, that they handle all donations compassionately while adhering to federal privacy laws, but declined specifics on this case.The support we've received has been incredible. By November 19, 2025, the GoFundMe, which was set up to help with funeral and memorial expenses, had brought in $58,253, exceeding its original target to help the family financially. McCanna mentioned in the update, ""Bryce touched countless lives, and will continue to do so as an organ donor. We want to honor him in a way that reflects the love he shared so freely.""The suddenness of Bryce's passing still leaves us with so many questions. Family statements haven't really identified a specific cause apart from the respiratory issues, and medical privacy keeps us from knowing more. As Kane mentioned to the I-Team, the emphasis is on his legacy: a young fan whose last gift connected generations of Browns supporters.Also Read: Who is Damone Clark?

Suspension upheld after NFL/NFLPA review as the hearing officer backs the league’s decision



The Cincinnati Bengals took a major hit this week as the NFL upheld Ja’Marr Chase’s one-game suspension, a decision that now comes with a heavy financial price. The ruling means Chase will reportedly lose $507,156 in salary, a massive setback for Cincinnati at a time when their offense depends heavily on his production. The hearing, led by the appointed NFL and NFLPA officer Jordy Nelson, confirmed the suspension stemming from the incident involving Steelers defender Jalen Ramsey, leaving the team without its star wideout for their upcoming matchup against the Patriots.This is not just another disciplinary update, the decision directly affects the Bengals’ game plan, their rhythm on offense, and their chances of building momentum in the AFC. Chase missing a full game forces Cincinnati to rework its passing strategy overnight, and the salary loss adds another layer of significance to the ruling. The confirmed financial penalty reflects how seriously the league viewed the on-field altercation, and it sends a clear signal about accountability during crucial moments of the season.According to the league, Chase’s one-game ban was upheld after a formal hearing where the incident was reviewed in detail.The ruling confirms that the NFL considered the act serious enough to maintain the suspension instead of reducing it to a fine. With no adjustment to the penalty, the decision stands as originally issued.Chase’s absence now forces the Bengals to rely on secondary receivers and shift their offensive structure. Losing a high-impact playmaker for an entire game affects both the confidence and the rhythm of the unit, especially for a team trying to stay competitive in a tight AFC race.The reported $507,156 salary forfeiture amplifies the impact of the suspension. For Chase, it marks a costly outcome. For the Bengals, it is a significant setback. And for the league, it becomes a strong example of how disciplinary decisions carry consequences beyond a single game.As the Bengals move forward, all eyes turn to how the team responds to this sudden shift. Chase’s absence changes the pace of their offense and adds pressure on the supporting cast to rise quickly.

Shedeur Sanders' house was robbed while he played his first NFL snaps



Shedeur Sanders’ first regular season appearance in the NFL became unforgettable for reasons far beyond football. While he stepped onto the field for the Cleveland Browns and took over in the second half against the Baltimore Ravens, three masked suspects slipped into his Medina County home. Police confirmed that the intruders stole close to two hundred thousand dollars in property during the short window Sanders was at the stadium. The crime added a jarring twist to a milestone day for the rookie quarterback.Officials said the burglary began at 6:46 p.m., a time that lined up with the early moments of the Browns’ 23 to 16 loss. Sanders’ debut came after Dillon Gabriel entered concussion protocol at halftime. Sanders finished 4 of 16 for 47 yards with an interception and two sacks. Hours later, he learned his home had been targeted.The Medina County Sheriff’s Office released a detailed statement on Tuesday that described how the break-in unfolded. The department said, ""On November 16, 2025, at approximately 6:46 pm three suspects entered the residence of Cleveland Browns football player Shedeur Sanders. Surveillance cameras in the residence were able to capture video footage of the suspects as they entered and exited different portions of the home.The suspects were wearing masks and gloves and can be seen exiting the residence at approximately 6:58 pm with various property belonging to Mr. Sanders. It is estimated that approximately $200,000 in property was stolen. The Medina County Sheriff's Office is currently investigating the incident.""Investigators added that the burglary lasted only twelve minutes. No arrests have been made, but the sheriff’s office is urging anyone with information to contact Captain Eric Bors. The footage has become a key part of the active investigation.Sanders, 23, is now one of several athletes targeted in what law enforcement believes may be a wider pattern. Recent break-ins involving Joe Burrow, Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Bobby Portis Jr. and Mike Conley appear connected to a burglary ring under FBI review. Officials have warned athletes to avoid sharing their locations online, since many crimes happened when players were known to be away.In Sanders’ case, the incident happened during a home game, making the crime even bolder. Despite the shock, he is expected to start for Cleveland in Week 12 against the Raiders.Also Read: Drake Maye challenges Cam Newton’s claim that Patriots’ surprising 2025 campaign is just ‘fool’s gold’","Shedeur Sanders' house was robbed while he played his first NFL snaps.

Kai Kara-France steps away to focus on personal growth



Cultural and spiritual priorities fuel Kara-France’s break



Fans of the UFC flyweight division were stunned when Kai Kara-France, a former title challenger and New Zealand’s top MMA star, vanished from the official rankings following UFC 322. Ranked No. 5 just the week prior, the 32-year-old fighter was nowhere to be found on the updated list, leaving fans speculating about suspensions, releases, or injuries.The mystery was clarified when journalist Ariel Helwani revealed that Kara-France had voluntarily stepped away from active competition. The decision comes as he plans to take a year off to focus on personal, cultural, and spiritual pursuits. This is not a retirement but a temporary pause, during which he will also remove himself from the UFC’s anti-doping testing pool, making him ineligible for rankings.Kai Kara-France is looking for personal space. “Don’t Blink” is reportedly paused his mixed martial arts career. “He informed the UFC he would be taking the year off and that there are other things he wants to do. He is not retiring necessarily, but he is taking a break — taking at least a year off. He wants to get into some cultural things, things that have nothing to do with fighting. He’s very spiritual, and we’ve seen him do things for his culture, his people, and his heritage,” Helwani explained.Kara-France’s recent fight history provides context for the decision. He fought Alexandre Pantoja in June 2025 at UFC 317 for the flyweight title but lost by rear-naked choke in the third round. Prior to that, he earned a first-round stoppage of Steve Erceg at UFC 305, a win that secured his title shot. Despite these highs, Kara-France went 1-3 in his last four bouts, battled injuries, and faced concussion issues. A mental and physical reset appears crucial at this stage of his career.Beyond the Octagon, Kara-France has increasingly embraced his Māori heritage. He has shared the importance of reclaiming his Māori name and identity, describing it as a source of pride.For now, the UFC flyweight rankings have adjusted, with fighters like Brandon Moreno, Joshua Van, and Amir Albazi moving up. Kara-France’s absence is temporary, and fans can expect him to return once he completes this personal and cultural reset.Also Read: Who is Paige Calendine?

Dana White’s long-term plan surfaces with UFC 324’s first official fight



Paramount Plus deal reshapes expectations for Dana White’s 2026 rollout



The UFC’s shift into its Paramount Plus era has taken a clearer shape after months of speculation about the promotion’s 2026 schedule. With only a handful of events left on the ESPN contract, fans had been left guessing about how Dana White would open the new broadcast partnership.Now that picture has sharpened. UFC 324, set for January 24 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, will launch the new era with a confirmed light heavyweight matchup and the promise of a major card built for a global streaming audience.The announcement comes at a time when the organization is preparing for a massive transition. With Paramount’s $7.7 billion deal set to redefine how the UFC delivers its pay-per-views and international programming, even a single fight reveal draws attention.The first confirmed bout of 2026 will reportedly see Modestas Bukauskas take on Nikita Krylov in a matchup that sets an early tone for the Paramount era (per MMA Fighting). Bukauskas has rebuilt his career since returning to the promotion in 2023, stacking four consecutive wins and delivering highlight finishes. That run includes the knockout of Paul Craig in Paris that effectively ended Craig’s career. A victory in January would push Bukauskas into the light heavyweight top 15 and solidify his resurgence.Krylov arrives in a far more urgent place. The veteran has dropped two straight, suffering back-to-back knockout losses to Bogdan Guskov and Dominick Reyes. His experience and durability have long made him a tough assignment, but he enters UFC 324 needing to stop the slide. The matchup gives both fighters something significant to fight for as the new broadcast deal begins to take shape.White confirmed earlier this year that every UFC event beginning in 2026 will stream on Paramount Plus, with select cards appearing on CBS. The partnership has already expanded to include Latin America and Australia, creating a worldwide launch moment in January. That has raised expectations for UFC 324.Matchmaking for the card has only just begun. When asked whether lightweight champion Ilia Topuria could appear on the first Paramount card, White left the door open, saying, “We literally — today, matchmaking was today,” before adding, “It’s a possibility.”Also Read: Netflix scramble revealed as Jake Paul weighed three unexpected replacement fighters leaked by top boxing insider",UFC 324 is set for January 24 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.

A surprising Geno Smith twist quietly shadows Travis Kelce’s lost QB dream

Raiders quarterback Geno Smith had a profound effect on Kansas Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce years before their NFL careers started. Now, recently. QB Geno Smith of Las Vegas was forced to apologies to Travis Kelce for ruining his college quarterback hopes at the West Virginia Mountaineers after Jason Kelce confronted him on the pitch.The animosity between Kelce and Smith extends far beyond their AFC West division. Travis still remembers a moment from their high school years, even though it began long before the NFL. Additionally, Jason Kelce, an ESPN analyst and Travis' brother, disclosed on November 17 that Smith reportedly destroyed Travis' college quarterback tryout.Smith had a brief conversation with ESPN commentator Jason Kelce on the field prior to Monday night's game against the Cowboys. The two shared a humorous story about Smith 'ruining' the Chiefs tight end's college quarterback tryout.According to the discussion, Smith's domination that day unintentionally propelled his brother, an ESPN commentator, into tight end immortality, a favor far larger than any scholarship could have been. Jason said to Geno Smith:“Geno, I know you know this... So, you ruined Trav’s chances of ever playing quarterback for West Virginia by showing him up at that recruiting camp…He remembers you, I know that.”Smith swiftly followed it up with a three-word message for Travis, giving the impression that he was a little sorry about it:“My bad, Trav... It worked out.”Jason told Smith:""You ruined Trav's chances of ever playing quarterback for West Virginia by showing him up at that recruiting camp.. He remembers you, I know that. My bad, Trav. But hey, it worked out.""In 2022, when Smith was still a member of the Seahawks, Travis shared the heartbreaking story on a New Heights episode. The legend states that the two first met during a recruiting trip to West Virginia when they were both trying out for Rich Rodriguez's team as quarterbacks.When Smith was speaking with Jason and other reporters on the field prior to the Raiders' game against the Dallas Cowboys, he made it apparent that he was aware of the story. Later on, though, Jason also concurred that everyone benefited from it.Kelce had shared the story on his New Heights podcast in 2022. Travis on the podcast said:“I’ve seen Geno sling it around since we were in high school.. When we both went on a recruiting visit to West Virginia, and he was just dotting it. And the way the ball was coming out of his hand… I walked out of there empty-handed, and Geno Smith walked out of there with an offer. I just remember seeing him throw the ball, and I was just sitting on the sideline like, ‘Man, I ain’t got that.”Meanwhile, Travis didn't say about Geno and his recent comment.Also read: ""She was breaking"": Taylor Swift’s emotional confession about Travis Kelce sparks panic about her past with Joe Alwyn","Travis Kelce and Geno Smith first met during a recruiting trip to West Virginia when they were both trying out for Rich Rodriguez's team as quarterbacks.

Dodgers’ Notable Departures

Theare approaching this offseason with caution after last year’s expensive gamble on Tanner Scott didn’t go as planned. The club invested $72 million in the left-handed reliever, only to watch him struggle to a 4.74 ERA while blowing 10 saves before losing his role to Roki Sasaki during the team’s World Series push. That experience has clearly shaped how the Dodgers are handling this winter’s free-agent market, especially when it comes to high-priced bullpen arms.With several contenders, including the New York Mets, Atlanta Braves, and Toronto Blue Jays, reportedly preparing for a $102 million bidding war over elite closer Edwin Díaz, Los Angeles appears reluctant to jump in. Instead, early indications suggest the Dodgers may pivot toward a more modest addition, focusing on Tampa Bay Rays right-hander Pete Fairbanks after Tampa Bay declined his 2026 team option.According to USA Today’s Jesse Yomtov, the organization may stay away from the expensive sweepstakes surrounding elite closer Edwin Díaz. Yomtov wrote, “With Scott on the books for three more years, the Los Angeles Dodgers may prefer to stay out of the Diaz sweepstakes, which is expected to end in a four- or five-year deal worth about $100 million.” His projection suggests that Los Angeles could target a more affordable arm instead.Scott finished 2025 with a 4.74 ERA in 61 regular-season games, blowing 10 saves before being replaced by Roki Sasaki for the Dodgers’ World Series run. Despite the rocky debut season, the team still believes the 31-year-old can rebound after posting dominant numbers in 2023 and 2024.Rather than chase the biggest names on the board, the Los Angeles Dodgers are expected to show interest in Tampa Bay Rays right-hander Pete Fairbanks, who became available after the Rays declined his 2026 team option. Fairbanks profiles as a lower-risk, potentially high-upside addition who can serve as insurance for Scott while deepening the bullpen without massive financial commitment.• Lower expected salary compared to Díaz• Proven late-inning experience• Flexibility to work in multiple relief roles• Helps stabilize the bullpen without forcing Scott out of the pictureLos Angeles Dodgers’ Recent Free-Agency ChallengesThe Tanner Scott signing is at the center of the Los Angeles Dodgers’ cautious strategy. The organization invested heavily, expecting him to anchor the ninth inning for years. Instead, Scott missed the entire postseason and struggled to consistently command his pitches.Despite the dip, the Dodgers are not ready to give up on him. With three years left on his contract, the front office remains confident he can return to form.The Dodgers’ bullpen isn’t the only area facing uncertainty. The team is also losing several players to free agency. Outfielder Michael Conforto is set to hit the market, and utility veteran Kiké Hernández could depart as well.

Teammates who joined Kris Boyd during the night out

Investigation developments and reactions from the Jets

New York Jets cornerback Kris Boyd, 29, is still in the hospital after being shot early Sunday in Manhattan. He had received a gunshot wound after an evening out with some teammates and was taken to Bellevue Hospital.Boyd had been at a hotspot restaurant and lounge on West 38th Street overnight, where he had been mingling with two fellow Jets players, before clashes inside the venue turned into an open-air beat-down, officials said.Boyd was out that night with Jamien Sherwood, a rookie linebacker, and Irvin Charles, a wide receiver on the practice squad, sources said. The trio had been wining and dining at a high-end Asian-fusion hot spot popular with athletes and celebrities. But the mood soured when another group within the venue began ""deriding the players' outfits and appearance,"" investigators said, and the Jets crowd walked out.When they went outside about 2 a.m., there was a fight involving the two groups. In the minutes before the first blow, two shots, one of which hit Boyd in the stomach, were captured on surveillance video, reportedly tens of minutes before Boyd was shot. Neither Sherwood nor Charles suffered injuries, and investigators say there's no indication either student was armed or firing a weapon.Also Read: 'Unemployed' Tyreek Hill’s ACL tear led to a shocking decision no one anticipated Detectives are still reviewing video, and an arrest is yet to be made in this case, according to the New York Police Department. Following them was another luxury sedan, before both cars fled the scene at high speed, officers said, releasing images of the high-end SUV with Michigan plates. Investigators believe the firearm assailant might have been within one of them.The restaurant stated that the incident occurred after closing time and outside its premises, adding that it is fully cooperating with the ongoing investigation. The Jets organisation issued a brief statement acknowledging the situation and declining further comment. Several players offered public messages of support, urging fans to keep Boyd in their thoughts as he recovers.Boyd, who has been on injured reserve this season due to a shoulder issue, joined the Jets in March 2025 following stops with the Minnesota Vikings, Arizona Cardinals and Houston Texans. Police continue to interview witnesses as they work to identify the shooter and piece together the events leading to the confrontation.","New York Jets cornerback Kris Boyd, 29, is still in the hospital after being shot early Sunday in Manhattan.

How Ryan Hartman’s absence impacts Minnesota Wild’s first-line strategy

Ryan Hartman Pulls Off Slick Spin-O-Rama And Roofs It Vs. Tampa Bay Lightning

The NHL injury update concerning the Minnesota Wild comes at a very critical time for a team that is trying to build up good momentum in the Western Conference. The season's intensity has intensified, and the Wild are now compelled to deal with unexpected lineup problems that might affect both the team's atmosphere and its flow. What at first appeared to be a rather straightforward series of games has rapidly turned into a challenge—the depth, timing, and adaptability of coach John Hynes and his staff are being tested.The worry shot up dramatically when it was announced that forward Ryan Hartman would miss the next week due to a lower-body injury. Hartman incurred the injury during the Sunday game against the Vegas Golden Knights, leaving the ice in the third period after showing he was in pain during his last shift with the other two stars, Kirill Kaprizov and Mats Zuccarello. His injury stopped a streak of 20 consecutive games that he had played this season, and during this period, he scored 4 goals and gave 3 assists.As per the information received from ESPN, the young and talented forward Danila Yurov is likely to assume the position of the center on the first line in the absence of Hartman. It is a big responsibility for the rising star, particularly with the Wild trying to gain the momentum from their last two wins.On the other hand, there is a slight hope that Vladimir Tarasenko may play, as he skated during Tuesday’s practice after being out for two games because of a lower-body injury. Though he is still questionable for the game against the Carolina Hurricanes on Wednesday, his early-season statistics—two goals and eight assists—make it a critical point to follow his status.With Hartman out and Tarasenko being a game-time decision, the Wild will now rely more on their depth and flexibility as they get ready for the Hurricanes. The way the team reacts in the next few games could determine the direction of their early season.Also Read: Colorado Avalanche locks in rising star Gavin Brindley with two-year contract extension","Minnesota Wild forward Ryan Hartman will miss the next week due to a lower-body injury.

Sophie Cunningham’s viral comment showcases a close bond with Indian Fever teammate Caitlin Clark



Sophie Cunningham is spending her WNBA offseason exploring new ventures off the basketball court. But during a rapid-fire interview with Front Office Sports, the Indiana Fever guard delivered one of her most viral comments yet. When asked who she would never want running her social media accounts, Cunningham immediately pointed to her teammate, Caitlin Clark. The answer came with zero hesitation and a lot of humor, giving fans another glimpse into the team’s off-court chemistry.Cunningham did not hold back when explaining why Clark would be her last choice. “Oh, 1000% Caitlin Clark,” she said. “She is a shit starter. She would definitely start some stuff over there.” Her blunt response quickly caught attention online. Cunningham and Clark played together last season, but both suffered season-ending injuries, keeping them out of the Indiana Fever’s playoff run. While Clark battles back from a groin injury, Cunningham entered free agency after an MCL tear ended her WNBA season.Sophie Cunningham’s lighthearted jab at Caitlin Clark comes as both players continue recovering from injuries that cut their seasons short.Cunningham appeared in 30 games before tearing her MCL, averaging 8.6 points, 3.5 rebounds, 1.2 assists, and 1.0 steals. Clark played 13 games before getting ruled out of her rookie campaign.Even without their stars, the Indiana Fever reached the WNBA semifinals, losing to the eventual champions, the Las Vegas Aces, in five games.Notably, Cunningham is now a free agent, exploring options during the offseason, while Clark focuses on her recovery in hopes of returning stronger next season.Cunningham has been one of Clark’s most vocal defenders throughout the league. In an episode of her “Show Me Something” podcast last August, she addressed the criticism and jealousy directed at Clark, saying, “It literally pisses me off when people are like, ‘She’s not the face of the league.’ What?”She continued, praising other WNBA stars but insisting Clark’s impact is undeniable, “But when people try to argue that she’s not the face of our league or our league would be where we’re at without her, you’re dumb as st. You’re literally dumb as fk.”Caitlin Clark remains central to the WNBA’s rise in popularity, and with a new CBA looming in 2026, her influence will only continue to shape the league’s future.Also Read: “He’s in Gordon’s clutches” - Adam Peaty’s wedding drama deepens as his mother reveals surprising details about Holly Ramsay’s family","Sophie Cunningham made a viral comment about her teammate Caitlin Clark.

NHL Trade Rumor: Will the Toronto Maple Leafs acquire Rasmus Andersson in the midst of market challenges?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumor-will-the-toronto-maple-leafs-acquire-rasmus-andersson-in-midst-of-market-challenges/articleshow/125416121.cms,"Rasmus Andersson (Image Via Twitter)

What are insiders saying about possible trade moves for Toronto Maple Leafs?



Rasmus Andersson To Toronto? + Other Leafs Trade Rumours | SDP

The Toronto Maple Leafs are again at the center of the NHL rumors as the speculation of Rasmus Andersson goes on and gets hot. Difficulty in road consistency and a weak defense have cracked the ice and opened up for Andersson, who has been the target linked to Toronto. However, as the insiders of Sportsnet and Leafs Morning Take talk about, the Flames’ asking price and the Leafs’ little trade assets may turn this chase into one that is less easy than what the fans expect. The interest is there, but the market around Toronto may not be the best.Within the organization, there is trade pressure continuing to grow, but at the same time, all possible solutions are complicated by the issues of salary, prospect value, and teams looking for roster improvements being heavily competitive. The Toronto Scorpions are after an impact defender, and getting someone like Andersson would necessitate a perfect mix of timing and flexibility. As speculation around the Leafs’ next move is escalating, the franchise is now positioned at a turning point where it needs to determine its level of aggressiveness in a difficult NHL marketplace.According to Jay Rosehill, a league source has confirmed that the Toronto Maple Leafs are interested in trading Rasmus Andersson.However, the host of the podcast doubted whether the team has enough assets, especially because Andersson will probably need an extension before being traded.In addition, Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman stated that the team in question was previously unable to get Rasmus Andersson last season, and it is possible for Calgary to ask for top prospect Easton Cowan in their next trade round, something the Leafs are not ready to do.Adam Proteau from The Hockey News hinted at a possible trade of Morgan Rielly with some other team, but the no-move clause over Erik Karlsson and Dougie Hamilton’s desire to stay in New Jersey are some of the reasons why this kind of scenario is not real. Proteau put forth names such as Max Domi, Calle Jarnkrok, Nick Robertson, and Bobby McMann as possible depth moves, but none of them would yield any significant returns. On the other hand, as per Terry Koshan from the Toronto Sun, the teams still have eyes on Cowan and Matthew Knies, who are two players Vancouver is very much unwilling to let go of.The Leafs might be looking at all possible scenarios, but the insiders seem to agree that the team’s limited assets and their top prospects not being sold off leave them with very few realistic trade possibilities. Unless there’s a change in the market, the roster shakeup in Toronto might be much smaller than fans expect.Also Read: NHL Injury Update: St. Louis Blues forward Mathieu Joseph sidelined before clash with Calgary Flames","The Toronto Maple Leafs are again at the center of the NHL rumors as the speculation of Rasmus Andersson goes on and gets hot.

SEC’s new TV deal with ESPN creates a major divide in the NCAA gymnastics



The Southeastern Conference (SEC) has changed the NCAA gymnastics broadcast picture with its latest 2026 announcement. Every SEC program will receive full-season coverage across ESPN networks. This means fans across the country will see SEC teams every week, while most other NCAA programs get little to no national exposure. The change creates a clear visibility gap even before the season begins.The opening schedule reveals the imbalance right away. The 2026 season starts with the Sprouts Farmers Market Collegiate Quad on ABC and ESPN2 on January 10. After that, SEC teams dominate the national broadcast windows on ESPN2 and SEC Network from mid-January to late February. Even top programs outside the SEC, such as Oklahoma, appear far less. As the season moves forward, non-SEC teams get only scattered opportunities to be on national television.The SEC’s expanded TV coverage may have a profound impact on the NCAA gymnastics. The conference now has full-season national exposure that no other league comes close to. ESPN and the SEC Network provide strong production, wide reach, and prime-time slots.This gives SEC athletes more chances to be seen by fans, scouts, and sponsors.Even Oklahoma, one of the sport’s most successful programs, highlights the contrast. The Sooners announced eight nationally televised meets for 2026. It is a strong lineup, but it still does not match the SEC’s season-long coverage. Five of Oklahoma’s regular-season meets will air on the SEC Network, yet their non-SEC opponents will not get the same visibility. This leaves most programs across the country with limited national airtime.This imbalance could impact recruiting. Since more TV time can also help athletes grow their NIL value. When athletes appear regularly on ESPN platforms, brands notice. More viewers also means stronger social media followings.The NCAA Championships will still air on ESPN+, ESPN2, and ABC. The NCAA Championship Preview Show and the NCAA Championship final on April 18, 2026, will also air on ABC. But the SEC Network remains the main home for Friday Night Heights.The long-term concern is whether non-SEC athletes will lose opportunities. Less TV time can mean fewer sponsors, weaker recruiting power, and slower program growth. The SEC’s broadcast strength may lift its teams even higher while others struggle to keep up.Also Read: Simone Biles drops jaw-dropping $90K flex on Chicago Bears sidelines while celebrating husband Jonathan Owens’ win",The Southeastern Conference (SEC) has changed the NCAA gymnastics broadcast picture with its latest 2026 announcement.

xQc suggests QT used Vanillamace’s nomination as a peace offering

“is not even close to being on the scale of this category,”





Twitch star xQc has stirred up conversation once again after claiming that QTCinderella deliberately added streamer Vanillamace to the Best Breakout Streamer category as a way to smooth over their past drama. The comments have reignited an ongoing discussion surrounding the integrity of creator award shows and how personal relationships may influence nominations. According to xQc, Vanillamace’s sudden appearance in the category feels less tied to her streaming momentum and more connected to QT’s attempt to mend past tensions. His remarks quickly spread across social media, sparking debates among fans about favoritism and behind-the-scenes decision-making.This controversy arrives at a time when QT is already dealing with community backlash over previous statements involving bigotry and interpersonal conflicts, issues that also involved Vanillamace. The existing friction between the two makes the nomination even more scrutinized, with xQc suggesting it was less a reflection of merit and more a strategic move to rebuild bridges. Fans of all three creators have since weighed in, with some defending the nomination and others siding with xQc’s assertion that the choice seemed out of place in a highly competitive category.At the center of the debate is xQc’s claim that Vanillamaceimplying that her inclusion doesn’t match the level of growth and impact typically expected from nominees. He further speculated that QTCinderella added her name because of their past disagreements, using the nomination as a gesture to ease tensions. The streamer argued that the choice appeared more like relationship management than a recognition of breakout success, reigniting accusations of favoritism within the award selection process.The broader situation builds on previous drama involving QT, Vanillamace, and conversations around QT’s criticism of bigotry and certain community behaviors, tensions that have persisted for months. As conversations escalate, many viewers have begun questioning the transparency of streamer-led award shows and how much influence personal dynamics may have on final decisions. Despite the backlash, neither QT nor Vanillamace has issued a detailed response addressing xQc’s comments directly.The controversy highlights simmering divisions within the streaming community and ongoing debates about fairness in nomination-based events. Whether QT’s decision was genuinely merit-based or influenced by past conflicts remains a matter of opinion, but xQc’s remarks have undeniably renewed scrutiny around the awards and the relationships behind them.Also Read: Adin Ross to take legal action after Cuffem suffers major head injury at Carti concert",Twitch star xQc claims QTCinderella deliberately added streamer Vanillamace to the Best Breakout Streamer category as a way to smooth over their past drama.

FIFA Shuts Down Trump's 2026 World Cup 'Unsafe Cities' Threat With Bold Remark

Poll Do you think Curacao's qualification for the World Cup will inspire other small nations in football? Yes, definitely! Possibly, but it depends on circumstances. Not really, it's a unique case. No, small nations face too many challenges.

In one of the most extraordinary nights in CONCACAF football history, the tiny Caribbean island of Curacao — home to just 156,000 people — scripted an unprecedented chapter by becoming the smallest country ever to qualify for the FIFA World Cup . Their tense 0-0 draw against Jamaica in Kingston on Tuesday was enough to secure passage to the 2026 finals in the United States, Canada and Mexico.The result capped a dramatic, nerve-wracking finale to the qualifiers, where Curacao survived relentless pressure from Jamaica — who struck the woodwork three times in the second half — and escaped a last-minute penalty scare. Salvadoran referee Ivan Barton initially pointed to the spot after Jeremy Antonisse clipped Dujuan Richards inside the box, but VAR overturned the call in a stunning twist that preserved Curacao’s historic dream.Coached by veteran Dutch tactician Dick Advocaat, who missed the clash due to a family emergency, the ‘Blue Wave’ finished atop Group B with 12 points from six matches, one clear of Jamaica. Curacao now surpass Iceland (population ~350,000 in 2018) as the smallest nation to ever reach a World Cup — a milestone made possible in the first edition featuring 48 teams.Elsewhere, the night produced more fairytale scenes. Haiti, forced to play “home” matches in Curacao due to political unrest, sealed their first World Cup appearance since 1974 after a crucial 2-0 win over Nicaragua.Goals from Louicius Don Deedson and Ruben Providence, combined with Honduras’ goalless draw against Costa Rica, lifted Haiti to the top of Group C with 11 points.Meanwhile, Panama secured the final automatic CONCACAF berth with a dominant 3-0 win over El Salvador, extinguishing Suriname’s hopes despite their qualification for the playoffs.For Curacao, the smallest of football nations, a World Cup dream once thought impossible is now gloriously real — a landmark for the island, the Caribbean, and world football itself.","Smallest nation to qualify for the World Cup, Curacao, beats Costa Rica 1-0. First time in history that two nations have qualified for the same tournament. The first time that two teams from the same country have done so.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125426769,imgsize-106144,width-400,resizemode-4/curacao.jpg"
'What are they doing to themselves?': Australia captain questions Gautam Gambhir’s pitch strategy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-south-africa/what-are-they-doing-to-themselves-australia-captain-questions-gautam-gambhirs-pitch-strategy/articleshow/125426434.cms,"Kolkata: India's coach Gautam Gambhir with Ravindra Jadeja (PTI Photo/Swapan Mahapatra)

'When you don't play well, this is what happens': Gautam Gambhir reacts to 1st Test defeat, points out what India lacked

India’s dominance in home Tests has started to slip over the past year, raising serious questions about their approach to pitch preparation. What once felt like an almost impenetrable fortress is now beginning to show cracks, with visiting teams finding ways to challenge and even defeat India on surfaces designed to take turn from the opening day. After India’s 30-run defeat to South Africa at Eden Gardens, Australia women’s captain Alyssa Healy has openly questioned why India continue to prepare sharply turning wickets that even their own batters are failing to handle.Speaking on the Willow Talk Cricket podcast, Healy said she is baffled by India’s strategy. She pointed out that facing spin has become a challenge worldwide, regardless of where batters are raised, and suggested that India are only making things tougher for themselves. According to her, India suffered a similar fate against New Zealand last year under comparable conditions. She believes flatter pitches would help India avoid repeat collapses.“I just don’t know what they’re doing to themselves. Batting against spin is not an easy thing around the world at the moment, even if you grow up on those wickets. They keep giving themselves turning wickets, thinking it’s going to help them, and it hasn’t.New Zealand beat them at home doing that. So, build yourself some flat wickets and let them go,” Healy said.Her comments come while head coach Gautam Gambhir continues to defend the Kolkata surface, saying it matched exactly what he had requested. Gambhir has repeatedly stressed that India’s batters need to show better technique and patience against spin. But Healy feels the players themselves are not enjoying such conditions. She also believes India’s spinners have greater impact on pitches that offer moderate assistance, allowing them to attack the stumps rather than rely on excessive turn.“I think their spinners are actually more effective on wickets that don’t do as much and their batters enjoy that as well. If that’s what they asked for I don’t understand it because it actually brings the opposition back into the attack. When you think about Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav , Washington Sundar and Axar Patel , they were effective attacking the stumps and when the ball turns too much it goes out of their wheelhouse a little bit. They’re losing Test matches at home which is a really bizarre thing for India to do. They’re going to have to look at it and think about better wickets,” she added.Since Gambhir’s arrival, India have dropped four of their six home Tests, with their only series win coming against a struggling West Indies side. With the second Test against South Africa beginning on November 22 in Guwahati, India will be desperate to prevent their first home series loss to the Proteas since 2000.",India's dominance in home Tests has started to slip over the past year.
