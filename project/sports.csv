Brett Favre’s tough playing style results in ongoing health struggles

Brett Favre, the former NFL quarterback, has shared concerns about his health after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement. He is also worried about the long-term effects of his football career, particularly regarding Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), a brain condition linked to repeated head injuries.Brett Favre, known for his bold playing style in the NFL, is now facing health challenges in retirement. His tendency to hold onto the ball and take hits helped him make key plays but may have contributed to the issues he's dealing with now.In a recent interview, 55-year-old Brett Favre, the Hall of Fame quarterback for the Green Bay Packers, shared the details of his Parkinson’s disease diagnosis. He had initially revealed this diagnosis during a congressional hearing on welfare reform in September 2024, making it a public matter. ""I have to admit, I thought the world was caving in on me. It was the end of the world,"" Favre told TMZ. ""I can't believe this, not me. I'm healthy, I'm very active, it doesn't happen to me.""Brett Favre has shared the intense fear that came with his Parkinson's disease diagnosis, stating in his interview, ""There's always the fear of what happens next... what's the next step?"" The ambiguity surrounding his condition has understandably caused distress as he faces the possible advancement of the disease, which can significantly affect his mobility, mental abilities, and overall well-being.His fears have been further worsened by recent events in sports, especially the revelation that former NFL player Frank Wycheck had Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) at the time of his death. CTE, a brain disorder linked to repeated head injuries, has raised concerns among former players as the lasting effects of concussions become clearer.Wycheck’s case increased awareness of how repeated brain trauma can lead to serious cognitive and mental issues, deepening Favre's worries about the potential for CTE, along with his Parkinson’s diagnosis. ""It makes me wonder what the future brings for me,"" Favre said. ""I've already been diagnosed with Parkinson's. I often wonder-and I try not to, but I can't help it-what the future holds.""""I would think that every player that dies from here on out, if they have their brain tested, I'd say a high percentage would have CTE,"" Favre added. ""We're just really scraping the surface of how damaging head trauma can be.I think people now take it seriously, but there is still that 'Ah, you know' attitude, almost like it's a fad, but we know it's not.""Also Read: LSU QB Colin Hurley Hospitalized After Car Crash, Family Shares Positive Health Update Favre's candidness about his difficulties emphasizes the obstacles many retired athletes encounter as they grow older, dealing with both the physical and psychological impacts of their careers.","Brett Favre, the former NFL quarterback, has shared concerns about his health after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

Top 7 Controversial Moments in WWE Royal Rumble History,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/top-7-controversial-moments-in-wwe-royal-rumble-history/articleshow/117344736.cms,"1. The 1994 Royal Rumble: The Double Winner Controversy

5. The 2014 Royal Rumble: The Crowd Turns on Batista

6. The 2015 Royal Rumble: Roman Reigns’ Unwanted Victory

7. The 2018 Royal Rumble: Ronda Rousey Overshadows Asuka

The Royal Rumble is one of WWE’s most exciting and unpredictable events, but over the years, it has also been plagued with controversies, including but not limited to questionable eliminations, botched finishes, and booking decisions that left fans outraged. Here’s a look at some of the biggest Royal Rumble controversies and what really happened behind the scenes.For the first and only time in history, two wrestlers—Lex Luger and Bret Hart—were declared co-winners of the Royal Rumble. Both men went over the top rope and hit the floor at the same time, leading to confusion about who had actually won. WWE (then WWF) wanted to push both Luger and Hart as top stars heading into WrestleMania X, so the decision to have a tie was planned. However, the audience’s overwhelming support for Bret Hart led to him getting the title shot, while Luger’s push ended.“Stone Cold” Steve Austin was eliminated by Bret Hart, but the referees didn’t see it. Austin slid back into the ring and eliminated Hart, winning the match. This was a scripted decision to fuel the legendary Austin vs. Hart feud. It led to their iconic submission match at WrestleMania 13, where Austin bled profusely and became a fan favorite despite losing, simply because of his dedication.Vince McMahon entered the match as a competitor, spent most of the match outside the ring, and ultimately eliminated Stone Cold Steve Austin to win. Fans were furious, as Austin was the clear favorite. The plan was to build Austin vs. McMahon for WrestleMania XV. However, many felt it hurt the credibility of the match by allowing a non-wrestler to win. It spiralled into a big controversy which ultimately backfired from the original plan.John Cena and Batista both tumbled over the ropes at the same time, unintentionally recreating the 1994 Rumble finish. The referees were confused, and chaos broke out. But, this was not planned. Vince McMahon stormed down to the ring, visibly furious, and attempted to restart the match—but tore both of his quads while entering the ring. This was one of the most shocking eliminations in the Royal Rumble to date. Batista ultimately won after the match was restarted.Fans were expecting Daniel Bryan to enter the match, but he never appeared. Instead, Batista won, and the crowd booed him mercilessly. WWE originally planned for Batista to main-event WrestleMania 30, but the backlash forced them to insert Daniel Bryan into the title picture. Bryan went on to win the championship in one of the most iconic WrestleMania moments ever, proving that WWE was also at the mercy of the audience.Fans were still upset from the previous year and wanted Daniel Bryan to win. However, Bryan was eliminated early, and Roman Reigns was booked to win instead. Even with The Rock raising his hand in victory, the crowd booed uncontrollably. WWE miscalculated fans’ loyalty to Bryan and their rejection of Reigns being pushed as the new face of the company. This moment was a turning point in how WWE booked Reigns for years.Asuka won the first-ever Women’s Royal Rumble, but instead of celebrating her victory, WWE had Ronda Rousey's debut immediately after—stealing all the attention. WWE wanted Rousey to be the focus heading into WrestleMania 34, but this took away Asuka’s big moment, making her win feel secondary. It was met with a lot of backlash from fans over social media,Also Read: WWE Friday Night Smackdown Review The Royal Rumble is always unpredictable, but sometimes controversy takes center stage.

LiAngelo Ball Was Cut From the NBA Three Times Before Getting His Big Break

NBA Legend LeBron James who is also the NBA’s all-time leader in career earnings, recently took to Instagram to highlight the Ball Brothers, Lonzo, LaMelo, and LiAngelo Ball ’s stellar achievement. James reacted to a post highlighting that the Ball Brothers have earned a combined $296 million throughout their careers. LeBron James put the post on his Instagram story and used the raise arms emoji to praise LiAngelo, LaMelo, and Lonzo’s amazing achievement.It is worth noting that LeBron James' NBA Career earnings alone stand at $528,695,302. Close to double of what the Ball Brothers have achieved for themselves over their relatively young careers. This figure mainly consists of the career earnings of NBA stars Lonzo and LaMelo. The eldest brother, Lonzo Ball signed a $80 million contract back in 2021. LaMelo Ball who is the Charlotte Hornets’ best player signed a $203.8 million deal with the team back in July 2023.Last but not least, LiAngelo Ball’s recent hip-hop hit “Tweaker” has earned him a $13 million deal with recording label, Def Jam. This was a much-needed win for LiAngelo who has been a little unfortunate in comparison to his brothers. Lonzo and LaMelo have made a name for themselves in the NBA with LaMelo Ball being one of the most exciting prospects in the league. LiAngelo was supposed to be in the league with them but could never make it work.LiAngelo signed three separate contracts with two different NBA teams. He first inked an Exhibit 10 contract with the Detroit Pistons on December 2, 2020. But, was waived by them just 12 days later on December 14, 2020. Ball was able to land himself another contract with the Charlotte Hornets on October 14, 2021. Unfortunately, he was waived just a day later on October 15, 2021. LiAngelo Ball got another opportunity with the Hornets on September 26, 2022. But, the Hornets decided to waive him once again on October 15, 2022. Following this, Ball spent some time in the G-League but failed to land himself an NBA contract. Then Ball did a brief stint in a Mexican league, but it seems like music was his true calling. With any luck, Tweaker will be the first of many hits that LiAngelo Ball puts out this year.ALSO READ: Lamelo Ball's Brother, LiAngelo Ball, Signs Massive $8 Million Deal With Def Jam LiAngelo Ball’s deal with Def Jam also allows him to retain all the rights to his music and record label. LaVar Ball was ridiculed for saying that all three of his sons would be superstars in the future. LeBron James’ reaction to the astonishing achievements of his sons will surely be enough to silence all who doubted him. It is also important to note that LiAngelo, Lamelo, and Lonzo are still at the early stages of their career. They'll sure add a lot more than $296 million, by the time they're done.What are your thoughts on the massive wealth that the Ball Brothers, Lonzo, LiAngelo, and LaMelo have amassed for themselves? Let us know in the comments below.","The Ball Brothers, Lonzo, LiAngelo, and LaMelo have earned a combined $296 million. LeBron James is the NBA’s all-time leader in career earnings.

Theare gearing up for a crucial Eastern Conference matchup against the Toronto Raptors on Friday, January 17. However, all eyes remain on the status of their star forward,, who has beenon the injury report due to a lingering right patella tendinopathy injury.Giannis Antetokounmpo, a vital piece of the Milwaukee Bucks ' success, has been dealing with this issue for some time.Despite the setback, he has continued to deliver exceptional performances, showcasing his determination and resilience. The Bucks, currently holding a 22-17 record and sitting in fourth place in the Eastern Conference, will rely heavily on his presence to maintain their momentum as they fight for a top spot.In Wednesday’s victory against the Orlando Magic, Giannis Antetokounmpo was also listed as probable but showed no signs of slowing down. The Greek Freak recorded 26 points, 11 rebounds, and played 30 minutes, leading the Bucks to a convincing win. His ability to perform at such a high level despite the injury is proof of his toughness and leadership on the court.Over the past few weeks, Giannis Antetokounmpo has been nothing short of spectacular, averaging over 30 points, 10 rebounds, and five assists per game. His shooting efficiency has remained consistent, making him a formidable threat on both ends of the floor. Additionally, his defensive prowess, highlighted by multiple blocks and steals, has kept Milwaukee competitive even during tough stretches.However, when Antetokounmpo is sidelined, the Milwaukee Bucks' offense often struggles. Without his presence on the court, their play becomes more stagnant and overly reliant on outside shooting. This allows opposing defenses to collapse on players like Khris Middleton and Damian Lillard, limiting their effectiveness. Moreover, Milwaukee’s ability to capitalize on fast-break opportunities significantly diminishes without Antetokounmpo’s speed and finishing ability.The Milwaukee Bucks are on a two-game win streak after a shocking 34-point loss to the New York Knicks and will look to carry this momentum into Friday's game. Fans can be cautiously optimistic about Antetokounmpo’s availability, as his recent performances suggest he is capable of managing his injury while continuing to dominate.With the Raptors on deck, all eyes will be on Antetokounmpo’s readiness. Judging by his recent showings, fans have every reason to expect another stellar performance from the reigning leader of the Bucks.","The Milwaukee Bucks host the Toronto Raptors on Friday, January 17.

New York Knicks star Karl-Anthony Towns

KNICKS at SIXERS | FULL GAME HIGHLIGHTS | January 15, 2025

When and where to watch the Minnesota Timberwolves vs New York Knicks game tonight (January 17, 2025)?

has been listed as “questionable” for Friday’s game against the Minnesota Timberwolves . Towns is currently dealing with an injury to his thumb that occurred during the team’s last game against the Philadelphia 76ers. Towns has been very reliable for the Knicks this season and has started 38 out of their 42 games. However, it seems like he’s still iffy to suit up against his old team, the Timberwolves.Karl-Anthony Towns’ fortunes seem to have turned around ever since he left the Timberwolves. He is currently averaging 25.4, 13.9 rebounds, and 3.3 assists per game while shooting 55% from the field. Furthermore, Towns’ move to a big market team has also been beneficial for his career and pr. It is also worth noting that KAT averaged 21.8 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 3 assists per game during his last season with the Timberwolves.His move away from Minnesota has been a step forward regardless of how you look at it. However, KAT is still 50-50 and might not be able to suit up against the Timberwolves tonight. His star duo, Jalen Brunson is listed as probable and is likely to be a part of the proceedings. Without Towns on the floor, Brunson will have to carry a heavier load than the one he does on a nightly basis.Currently, he is averaging 26 points, 3 rebounds, and 7.5 assists per game while shooting 48.7% from the field. Brunson and Karl-Anthony Towns' combined efforts are a big part of the reason behind the Knicks being third in the East. However, the Timberwolves might be able to defeat them tonight. Without KAT contesting, the Timberwolves will be able to have their way in the paint. Towns may not be the most elite defender but his presence on the glass and length are big factors behind the Knicks’ solid interior defense.With Mitchell Robinson yet to make his season debut, the Knicks will surely struggle to protect the paint. It’ll be interesting to see how Jason Kidd adjusts to the absence of his most elite rim protectors.ALSO READ: Minnesota Timberwolves vs New York Knicks (01/17): Starting five, injury report, start time, game prediction, betting tips, how to watch, and more The Minnesota Timberwolves will visit Madison Square Garden to take on the New York Knicks at 7:30 PM ET.

""I've been on the other side as a member of the New York Giants and even if I felt some type of way, I probably wouldn't give them any extra fuel. I'm pretty sure Philly fans have seen that comment.

""When I see that green and white I hate it,"" he said. ""I actually get upset. Like I actually genuinely get hot.”Growing up just outside Philadelphia did little to foster any affection for the Eagles in Verse.

Sindhu, Kiran crash out

NEW DELHI: As a packed audience egged them on, India's men's doubles pair of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty hit turbo mode in their quarterfinal clash against South Koreans Yong Jin and Kang Min Hyuk. It was a demolition job as Sat-Chi waltzed into the semifinals of the India Open Super 750 tournament with a 21-10, 21-17 win here at the KD Jadhav Indoor Stadium on Friday.It was a near-clinical display against the Korean duo, who had upset the top seeds and World No. 1 pair of Kim Astrup and Anders Skaarup Rasmussen of Denmark in the opening round. In the semifinal, Satwik-Chirag will face third seeds Sze Fei Goh and Nur Izzuddin of Indonesia.The match began with a fierce rally but thereafter it was complete domination from Satwik and Chirag. The Indians kept the rallies short, launching relentless attacks and criss-cross net play to lead 11-3 at the break in the opening game. Jin and Kang tried mixing rallies with drops and deep tosses but the Indians dashed to an 18-8 lead. The Indian pair soon earned 11 game points with two more smashes. Another thunderbolt from Satwik sealed the first game.In the second game, Jin and Kang started well, going into a 4-3 lead. But the Indians launched a barrage of attacking shots which helped them make it 9-4. They went into the interval with a five-point cushion following Satwik's down-the-line smash.The Koreans recovered to make it 13-15, and also won a glorious 37 shot rally to level the score at 16-16. However, Chirag unleashed a smash to douse any hope of a Korean revival, and with a final net error from the Koreans, Satwik and Chirag grabbed three match points. The Indian pair sealed the match at the first opportunity.""Right from the word go, we went all guns blazing. That's what we wanted,"" Chirag said. ""We kept believing that if we are positive from the start, things will work out well for us,"" Satwik added.The other two Indians, PV Sindhu (women's singles) and Kiran George (men's singles), exited following contrasting losses. Two-time Olympic medallist Sindhu suffered a heartbreaking 9-21, 21-19, 17-21 loss to Paris bronze medallist and fourth seed Indonesian Gregoria Mariska Tunjung in a gripping quarterfinal.""It is sad that I lost in the third set after fighting so hard. The match was such that it could've gone either way,"" Sindhu said.Kiran George, meanwhile, fought hard and even saved a match point in the second game but lost 13-21, 19-21 to China's Hong Yang Weng.

Jimmy Butler returns with a two-word statement through his agent

Jimmy Butler is set to return to the Miami Heat after serving a seven-game suspension. Certainly, fans are excited and his agent stirred even more buzz with a simple, two-word statement showing that Butler is ready for on-court action. The Heat have faced challenges without their star player, and Butler’s return is crucial for their playoff hopes. Following his seven-game ban, all eyes are on Butler as he steps back into his role on the roster.Miami Heat star Jimmy Butler is set to return on Friday against the Denver Nuggets after serving a seven-game suspension.The Heat suspended Butler for ""conduct detrimental to the team"" after his publicly announced trade request. In a surprising twist, Butler announced his return in a way that mirrored Michael Jordan ’s famous 1995 ""I'm back"" message.Through his agent, Bernie Lee, the six-time All-Star recreated Jordan’s iconic return after his brief 17-month retirement to pursue baseball. Now, Butler is back to lead the Heat as they push forward in the season.“The following statement was released today by Jimmy Butler, through his agent, Bernie O. Lee, President of Thread Sports Management LLC. (""THREAD"") located in Miami, FL., in response to questions about his future career plans: ‘I'm back,’” Butler’s agent shared.If fans have missed the reference, Butler added more to resonate his return with the NBA legend.

So it's my job to prepare this team and get them ready to play at a high level, and that’s what I’m doing.”""That’s what the plan is,"" Spoelstra continued.

I’m looking for getting this team ready to play at a high level.”The Heat head coach further dismissed questions surrounding the Butler-Heat drama, especially, the teams’ president Pat Riley . “In terms of silly questions about what’s the temperature of the room or how everybody is feeling, that just sounds so dramatic.

Vijay Hazare Trophy: Dominant Karnataka take on red-hot Vidarbha,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/vijay-hazare-trophy-dominant-karnataka-take-on-red-hot-vidarbha/articleshow/117346167.cms,"Agarwal's boys have their task cut out against Nair & Co

The career trajectories of Mayank Agarwal and Karun Nair is uncannily similar. Both made their List A debut in 2012, made triple centuries in first class cricket and earned their Indian Test caps on the strength of their domestic performances. But have fallen off radar of the national selectors.Agarwal is only a few months older than 33-year-old Nair, but both are at the crossroads of their careers, fighting to make inroads back into the national team.Both have hit a purple patch in the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy , emerging the leading run-getters. Nair tops the list with a remarkable 752 runs from seven innings, while Agarwal follows with 619 runs in nine innings. As far as a platform for comebacks go, the two Bengaluru boys have left the rest of the pack in the shade.Come Saturday, the two who have played together since their U-14 days, will find themselves on opposite sides as Nair leads Vidarbha and Agarwal marshals Karnataka in the title match in Vadodara. While Vidarbha are first-time finalists, Karnataka are four-time champions. The last time Karnataka won the Trophy - in 2019-20 - Nair and Agarwal were a part of the team.Individually, there is a lot at stake for the two batters, they are both keen to ensure their team lands the spoils.Vidarbha has been in red-hot form, winning all six league matches convincingly before making light work of Maharashtra's challenge in the semifinals with a 69-run victory. The only blemish in Karnataka's campaign has been a loss to Hyderabad in the league phase. They knocked out defending champions Haryana by a five-wicket margin to make the final.As Nair comes up against his former team, whom he represented for over a decade, Agarwal, focused on ending his team's title drought, told TOI, ""I'm very happy for Karun for the kind of performances he has had. I think the numbers speak for themselves. He has had a massive impact in this tournament for Vidarbha.""Nair, who has featured in seven Tests and two One-Dayers, took over the Vidarbha reins this season and has marshaled his resources well. But so too has Agarwal, who has 25 Tests and five ODIs to his name. He has led the Karnataka team, with a bevy of youngsters, adroitly with KV Aneesh, R Smaran and KL Shrijith (with the bat) and Abhilash Shetty (with the ball) making it count.On the rookies in his squad, Agarwal, who opens the innings with the in-form Devdutt Padikkal said, ""This generation is a very confident bunch. They have a lot of belief in their game, and we have seen that in the three batters. Abhilash has flown high. He made his debut in this tournament, and for him to pick up 4-5 wickets in crucial matches is very heartening, especially since he doesn't have games under his belt.""It has also helped Agarwal to have the experienced V Koushik in the pace department. The return of his now deputy Shreyas Gopal to spearhead the spin attack had only augured well.But Vidarbha's dominance in the tournament is not lost on Agarwal. ""They have been playing very good cricket. They dominated almost all oppositions. That's why they are in the final. I think it makes for a very good and interesting final.""Good and interested because he believes Karnataka have more than earned their spot in the final.""We have played really good cricket. From chasing down 380 against Mumbai to winning the game against Punjab with a wicket in hand is amazing. People have stepped up at crucial times and put in defining performances. In the final, I'm looking forward to guys turning up, putting their hands up and giving their best. We want to go out there, back our skills, believe in ourselves and execute our plans.

Career and personal life

Bonnie Blue , a 25-year-old OnlyFans creator from Derbyshire , claims to have set a world record by having sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours, reports Daily Mail.The event took place in London, allegedly surpassing the previous record of 919 men in 24 hours set by adult actress Lisa Sparks in 2004, with Bonnie claiming she ""bedded 1,057 in 12 hours.""In a video shared on TikTok, Bonnie thanked those who participated, saying, “Thank you to all the barely legal, barely breathing and the husbands.”She added that her skin looked better after the event and described the experience: “The room was absolutely full. We did groups of five, like one after the other. It was a rotating circle.”Her PR team confirmed the tally, stating, “She slept with 1,057 people. As she hit 1,000, there were still 57 left in the queue who Bonnie wanted to pleasure before ending the 12-hour day.” Calculations suggest she averaged 41 seconds per partner.The stunt sparked outrage online, with comments such as “How embarrassing” and “Sad that men would want to do that too—all for fame and money.” Bonnie is no stranger to controversy, having previously defended her claims of sleeping with “barely legal” 18-year-olds and encouraging men to cheat on their wives.Bonnie's real name is Tia Billinger , who says she earns up to £750,000 a month from her OnlyFans content. Despite criticism, she insists her work is educational. “I can’t think of one situation where an 18-year-old has had sex where they’ve had to bring a passport, sign consent forms, and do a breathalyser,” she said on ITV’s This Morning.She also addressed criticism for sleeping with married men, arguing, “If wives aren’t going to pleasure husbands, let them go elsewhere. It’s just an act; the husbands mean nothing to me.”Bonnie transitioned to sex work after moving to Australia in 2022 with her now ex-husband, Oliver Davidson. Formerly a recruitment professional, she launched her career as a cam girl and later joined OnlyFans.She claims her family now supports her career, with her mother even assisting her business by booking appointments and handing out condoms for marketing. “It’s changed their life completely for the better,” she said.Bonnie defended her actions, stating, “These 18-year-olds can go to the army, they can drive, they can drink… If they want to use their own bodies to come and sleep with me, that is their decision.”","Bonnie Blue, 25, claims to have had sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours.

They say, all supermen wear capes. Some wear bibs.

Mo Farah

is one of them.

One of only two athletes to win the 5000m and 10,000m gold at successive Olympic Games (London 2012 and Rio 2016), the 41-year-old visited the Times Of India office at CST in his capacity as an event ambassador of the Tata Mumbai Marathon, which celebrates its 20th edition this Sunday.

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

During the course of an hour-long conversation, Farah spoke eloquently on a range of issues, from being trafficked from Djibouti to Great Britain as a nine-year-old, his journey to becoming an all-time great track runner, his transition to becoming a marathon runner and who he sees playing Mo Farah if a biopic were made on him. Excerpts.

Since you're here as event ambassador for the Tata Mumbai Marathon, what's your daily fitness routine? Do you still run?

The world knows you as a great long-distance runner, but we recently got to know you're a pretty talented sprinter as well. There was a story that came out about you chasing down these thieves who snatched your phone and were trying to escape in a van. Tell us what happened.

How different is the UK right now with all the immigrants and all those problems from when you started and chose to live in it?

You've won all the possible medals in 5000 metres and 10,000 metres, but when it came to transitioning to the marathon, how difficult was it?

There will be around 60,000 people running in different categories of the races on Sundays. Have you ever seen this kind of running group?

From the 2011 World Championships to the 2017 World Championships, with two Olympics in between, you were on top of your sport. What sacrifices does a person have to make to stay on top for such a long time?

Do you think you could have done something better in the marathon than your personal best of 2:05:11?

You had that racer's instinct where you stayed on the shoulders of the lead bunch for the last part of the race and then struck the hammer in the final stretch. Were you always like this when you were young, or was it something that you developed?

Noted high-performance coach and physiologist Barry Fudge in his book called you the most decorated distance runner ever. He also refers to the meticulous planning that was put in place behind the golden period you enjoyed from 2011 to 2017. Can you give us an idea as to what went on in that period that led to a remarkable transformation?

Barry also says that your toughest race was against Caleb Ndiku over 5,000 metres at the 2015 World Championships.

Which was the race you thought you might not be able to carry on further, but yet ended up winning?

When you won your first two gold medals at the London Olympics, which of the two gave you greater satisfaction?

In 2022, you told the BBC about how you were trafficked. Was it a very tough thing to admit? You waited pretty much until your retirement to talk about it? Is it because you didn't want to distract yourself from your career?

At what point did you begin running? At what stage did you discover that you can run, and what did running do for you at that time?

What did you feel when it was announced that you were going to be knighted? You came from zero, almost nothing from Somaliland…

You made a return to track competition and spoke of wanting to defend your 10,000m Olympic title in Tokyo. But you missed the qualifying mark by 19 seconds in June 2021. You had said that the reasons you wanted to return to track were because you had missed it, and you felt that you could still win medals. How much of a disappointment or reality check was it for you to miss the bus?

Do you think anyone can achieve the quadruple double (winning the 5000m and 10000m titles at two successive Olympics and world championships) again?

Did you ever think of reverting to your original name, Hussein Abdi Kahin?

The Kenyans and Ethiopians have a galaxy of long-distance runners. Why is it? Is it because they are genetically superior? Is it the climate? Is it the high altitude?

How would you measure up to the original African legend, Kenenisa Bekele?

When do you think long distance or distance runners will become as popular as the sprinters? What do they lack?

About your personal well-being. So how many hours do you sleep? Do you run every day; do you work out every day? What's your diet like?

Being a practising Muslim, how did you cope with fasting while competing?

A lot of people in India are taking to running very late, you know in the middle age. So, if someone like that comes to you for advice, what would you tell them?

Did you run by instinct or by strategy?

So, say if you were running a marathon, did you have a plan or did you run by instinct depending on what your body was telling you?

At what stage, say in the 5000 or 10000m did you know that this is the time to accelerate and move into the next gear?

Mo, your story as an athlete is marvellous and of course it is a bigger human story full of drama and emotion. The material is quite fertile for a biopic or a web series. If there is a biopic on Mo Farah, who do you think should play Mo Farah and why?

Every year shoes evolve, how much do you think shoe technology has been helping runners?

By when do you see any athlete running the marathon under two hours?

Ten-15 years? Considering it is under 2:01 at the moment?

Firstly, thank you guys for welcoming me to India. It's been an amazing trip to Mumbai. It's my first time. It's great to see the Tata Mumbai Marathon and how changes have happened over the years. It is celebrating the 20th edition, which is important for all of us. After I stopped running, my purpose is to be able to give back to others, work with charities, show people through sports what we can overcome.Now, I just go for a run to clear my head but really not much more than that. I do play a little bit of paddle with my family. My kids are quite active, so often I will run with my kids or go on family runs. But compared to someone who was running 120 miles a week, I'll probably say I'm just running 10% of it or not even that (smiles).I was doing a running session with my wife, not too far from where we live. We were doing a hill session. Around that time someone tried to take it, and my wife said to me, ""Something's going on there."" So, I ran down to the bottom and dealt with the situation. But yeah, I'd probably say I'm not as fast as I used to be, not anymore.The situation we're in the UK or throughout the world, there are always changes, and they will continue to be a lot of changes. But for me, I was very grateful that the country embraced me with both hands as a young boy. Coming to the UK wasn't easy being trafficked as a child; I was in a difficult situation. But my PE teacher and the people around me recognised my talent and embraced me. If I didn't have that opportunity, I would never become this man.I was lucky to have the career I did on the track. So for me, when I moved to the marathon, I wanted something to change. I wanted something that could inspire me, something that I was hungry about. It was about trying to motivate myself. The transition to the marathon was hard. I won my first major marathon at the 2018 Chicago Marathon with a British record of two hours and five minutes. But it was challenging because you got to understand the event and know how you can win.At all times in a marathon, the more you're on your feet, the more things can go wrong. But perhaps I didn't quite understand the marathon as much as I did the track. On the track, if you do 10,000 metres, you can do another 10,000 three-four weeks later. You can recover so quickly after a 5,000 metres race that if you do a 5,000 this weekend, you can do it the following week because you can recover quickly. But in a marathon, you don't quite recover. It takes six months for my body to recover fully, and that was the frustrating part for me.I've seen it competing at the London Marathon. It's one of the biggest marathons in the world. If you look at this race (Mumbai), you know we're capable of (having more runners). How many millions live in India? I think we have to change the attitude, the belief, the system, them viewing and bringing in people because I believe the power of sports can change many things. The power of sports can change the lack of languages, characters, and colours because all you want to see is people taking part, having fun. It doesn't matter what they look like or what language they speak or where they come from. And I think that's the power. And we do recognise that, particularly in the marathon happening, that can bring in the community and change society.For me, it's incredible to be an ambassador for the Tata Mumbai Marathon. As an ambassador, I think it's important for us to understand the event. That's why I came to India, Mumbai particularly, I believe what they're doing is incredible. We're celebrating the 20th edition. If we were talking 20 years ago, someone would say, ""You are going to start a marathon here?"" It shows people, if you're given that opportunity, we can make the most of it.It's very difficult as an athlete to stay on top year after year. The reason why it is harder is because if one knows what piece I'm writing today, they know your style of writing. It's the same as running, where people knew my strengths and weaknesses, and to stay on top of that wasn't easy. But I was always willing to think that the goal post is always changing. If you think the goal post is going to stay in the same place, that's the day when your opposition gets hold of you and you start to lose races. For me, I was always a bit hungrier.At the same time, I had to understand my opposition, what they're doing, how they're doing it, who's going to be my threat, who's going to be my danger, and then keep grafting, keep believing in yourself. For me, after 2017, it became a little bit harder to motivate myself. And that's one of the reasons why I moved to the marathon to find that new goal, new ambition, new challenge.I believe in being honest. You could say that the shoe technology is moving, new things are coming in, but at my time, that was my limit.It's something that I developed. That's something I understood. When I was younger, I used to think, 'At some point in the race, as long as you made an effort, it didn't matter, even if you hurt yourself.' That was me. Later, I realised that's not the way to win a race. With more races, you have to figure out tactics where you can beat others, and they can't come close to you. I was stronger towards the latter stage of the race. When it comes down to one lap to go, that was where I was at my strongest, where I would sprint and then hold and don't let anyone pass you.I worked with Barry for many years throughout my career. I remember meeting Barry in 2010 when I won 10,000m and 5,000m gold at the European Championships. When I met him later down the line, it was about understanding and having data on myself. As an athlete, it's really important to have data to be able to know what your heart rate is, what's your threshold, what's your maximum speed. So, the idea to meet Barry was to be able to understand, 'Why am I not good at this guys? What do I need to do?' I didn't understand that before and then training with the Ethiopians and figuring out training, learning from them, it's definitely helped.Caleb was a great athlete, and I've said often that when you race against athletes that are ruthless, who put themselves through the line, it's hard to beat. And I remember that race; it was at the Beijing World Championships where he went in so hard in the race, and he almost broke me, and perhaps if he would have gone a little bit later, he would have beaten me. We went through one of the miles during the race in sub-four minutes, and then I think we ran the fastest 1k during that race. So, he did give me a tough race. But that's what sport is about, giving people entertainment and giving it your best.(Thinks hard and sighs) Probably the toughest one is the 10,000 metres. I'm thinking, how am I going to find that extra gear? How am I going to find that just a bit more, and you end up winning the race. The 10,000 metres, I would say in Daegu, winning the 5,000 metres and coming so close to winning the 10,000 metres in the 2011 World Championships. I honestly thought I was going to get there, and I didn't quite get there. But for me, you just have to drive to the line and don't take things for granted.Probably the first one for me is the ones that, as an athlete, define you as Olympic champion. And no one could take that. And to be able to do it in front of my home crowd in London, for me, that 10,000 metres was epic. That Saturday, they called it 'Super Saturday' where we had myself, Jessica Ennis and Greg Rutherford where, in a 45-minute window, there were three Olympic champions on the track, and I was one of them.It was very difficult for me because I didn't want to be in that situation. And then for me, in school, I went to social services. The school knew, so we talked about it. Then I was moving from that environment to being somewhere else. And for me, that's when I started to enjoy more. I was free and had that amazing career. And as I got older and had my own family, my kids were the biggest reason why I did it because they were asking me questions. 'Where is your brother? Where is your grandma? Why can we not see them?' When I looked at them at times, I couldn't imagine them going through what I did. And honestly, I just wanted to be honest with them and be transparent for them. Also, for me, it was so hard to carry that with you for 30 years. I just wanted to be free.I discovered it through my PE teacher (Alan Watkinson), who took me to a local club. I could always play football and run around. I was that kid who was always very active, but when I was 11, I joined the running club. In 1996, when I was 12, I started competing for the clubs. But running was what saved me. Without running, I would have struggled mentally as well as physically. Because running was a way of being free, a way of giving me things that I could control. And sometimes, you know, people go, 'where does he get that fearless drive?' And for me, it's just knowing my story just made me more resilient, more grounded, hungrier, and grabbing the chance with both hands. When you get that opportunity in life, grab it with both hands and thrive.As I said, I've had an amazing career. Even though at times as a kid, you think, I did struggle. And now I'm not struggling. But still, I do think about the things I went through. But yet, you know, if somebody would say to you in this room, when I was a young boy, said to you — you're going to achieve four Olympic gold medals, you're going to be given world titles, you're going to be knighted by Her Majesty, the Queen, I wouldn't believe you. I would have taken one of those things. And to be recognised there because of your talents and the medals you won for your country, it's an amazing feeling because there are things that you can't control. To have that title, the same thing as Sir Alex Ferguson and so many great role models I had growing up, it's incredible. It just shows you in life, anything is possible, you never know.It's all about being as honest and transparent as possible. But as an athlete, when you win stuff, your mindset is different from normal people. You always think you're good enough and you can do it. If the Olympics would have happened when it was supposed to happen (Aug 2020), I would have retired there. But then Covid happened, and the Games were delayed by a year. Then I got injured, and I found it hard. But I just didn't want to stop there. I wanted to stop at the Olympics. I was trying to qualify, but that's all I had. With age, the body slows down. Yes, I was disappointed, but I didn't want to look back and say, 'I'm so disappointed'. I was grateful to have got the opportunity to compete in my country and win this medal. It was more frustration than disappointment.There are a lot of athletes who have won so many medals but not done what I did. It was only Lasse Virén, I believe, who did the Olympic double-double, and Kenenisa Bekele , I think, is short of one medal. But I believe he's one of the best athletes that we will ever see in terms of long distance.Haile Gebrselassie came close too, but not quite so. To be in the same bracket as Lasse Virén is incredible for me. No one really stands out to me that could do that in the next 10 or 15 years. Jakob Ingebrigsten is another great athlete, but he's coming from 1500 metres to 5000 metres. But I don't see anyone at the minute who can go 5000, 10000 metres and repeat that over an Olympic cycle. But we will see someone while we're still alive get close or maybe even beat it.My mom gave me my birth name, Hussein. And one of the reasons why I named my son Hussein was because I never got a chance to call myself by that name. So, in our family, my son is Hussein. I couldn't see myself as another Hussein because I think most people know me now as Mo. We'll continue. My mom, though, still calls me Hussein.Indeed. They can run indefinitely (laughs). It's a combination of two elements. Firstly, it's genetic. If you are born in that part of the world, East Africa, your frame is more petite. And then the other aspect is training and understanding that if you're born at 10,000ft above sea level and you train against somebody who's at sea level, you're going to be superior because you're accustomed to a place where there's less oxygen.If I look at all the people that I raced against and think who was the strongest, I'll probably say Kenenisa Bekele. Just for what he did on the cross country, on the track, world records, Olympic titles, world championships. He's run what, 2.01 in the marathon. I think it's not often talked about, but if you put all these things on a piece of paper, you probably go, wow, he's definitely up there.We need to make it happen (laughs). It's the lack of personalities. When I observe football, rugby or these other sports, I wonder why they receive such extensive publicity when we are running and working 10 times more intensely. It's an individual sport, not a team event. The athlete is out there, representing their country. Personally, I aspire to see running reach new heights. I want to witness the participation numbers at the Mumbai Marathon grow annually. I want to see women, girls and people surmounting various challenges.My diet is sensible, a lot of chai as you can see. That's my second cup (points to the cup of tea in front of him), a lot of coffee. But it's important to look after your body whether you are an athlete or not. I think sleep is the most important and recovery. I sleep about 8 to 9 hours, minimum of 7, it depends. And I will always have my watch on which give me every night's sleep (data), how many steps. I'll take about 10 to 15,000 steps a day, just walking, and now and then, I would go for a little jog just to clear my head.In 2012, I really struggled because during the Olympic time, it was on that time. So, the days that I couldn't do it, I followed up on it. But for me, each one is different. And with Ramadan, it keeps moving 10 days. So now is easier because you're going into the winter and December time. But during 2012, it does get harder. But for me, I'm quite reserved. The days I do kind of miss, and I can't do it, I do catch up. Honestly, one of the best feeling I had this year was being able to go to Mecca, because my dream, when I did stop, was to do that. And I did that with my wife, and it just changes you.It's hard when you start something so late, but also, wherever you start, you have to have a passion and a belief. For me, to achieve all these great things, if I didn't have the drive, I would never have won anything. So, it's important for people to feel in love in the moment. But running, often people go, 'running is just…why would you run?' But when you get the taste of running, then that running bug and that feeling of you did something great, you want to continue to go out, and you keep doing more and more.Strategy.If I listened to my body each time what it was saying, I would never have won. It's a funny thing, because the body sometimes doesn't like being challenged. It tells you 'Oh you're tired'. But if you listen to that, you will be tired. It's a bit of both.But even in the last lap, somebody could go in as hard and I knew at that point if they're coming past me, just don't give him more than what's necessary, so hold them. And sometimes, you might have to go out flat out for the first bit but have something left towards the end. It's just when you do more races, you learn about it, you understand more. And I was good at tactically just winning races really more than anything else. Because if you look back, all the things I've won, it's come by tactics more than fast times or records. Because I didn't win those titles in certain amount of record time.Hollywood or Bollywood? You pick Bollywood for me, I'll pick Hollywood. It's hard to pick, honestly. Hollywood, it would have to be Denzel Washington . If I could give back anything to people, have that character of him. He's one of my favourite actors in Hollywood.Yeah, as I said, shoe technology is moving so fast, it's incredible. I remember back when, even for people competing in marathon, it took weeks, like one week, ten days to recover. Now when you do a marathon, not (just) recover, but you can walk again. I'm sure you hear some amazing stories. Like some people can't even walk after a marathon. Now after a marathon, you can walk up the stairs, down the stairs, and that's how technology is going.I think it's a matter of time. Ten-15 years.(Laughs) I'll have to be a bit more cautious. But…. I don't know. The way we are operating, because the women just run under 2:10, right? Under 2:10 is under 5-minute miling. So if you break it down and go with 'if women can run sub-5-minute a mile, what are the men capable of? I think we might even see it sooner than we think.","Mo Farah is one of only two athletes to win the 5000m and 10,000m gold at successive Olympic Games (London 2012 and Rio 2016) The 41-year-old visited the Times Of India office at CST in his capacity as an event ambassador of the Tata Mumbai Marathon.

NEW DELHI: The wait is finally over. India men's senior selection committee chaired by Ajit Agarkar will pick India's provisional squad for the upcoming Champions Trophy tomorrow (January 18) in Mumbai and they are set to face a happy headache while doing the same. While top-order is more or less clear, they need to find the right pieces for the middle-order puzzle. There are plenty of players in the mix for those 3-4 positions but Shreyas Iyer remains a no-brainer for the middle-overs period.With the right mix of caution and aggression, he has aced the 50-over game in the past and had a stellar 2023 ODI World Cup where he amassed 530 runs in 11 innings. The runs came at a healthy strike-rate and he hit two hundreds and three half-centuries during India's campaign. The right-hander had a turbulent little period where he lost out on an annual contract but bounced back in emphatic fashion during the IPL where he led KKR to the title.There were three ordinary outings against Sri Lanka in the ODIs but he rediscovered the touch during the domestic season where he made substantial contributions, across formats, for Mumbai. 452 runs in five First Class innings were followed by 345 runs in Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and 325 runs in five List A fixtures. He has the weight of runs behind him but more importantly has the game suited for the surfaces in Dubai. With spin expected to play a major role in the tournament, Iyer has what it takes to control the middle period of the game like he did during the 2023 ODI World Cup.He has time and again reiterated that he is not fussy about batting positions and that flexibility will certainly come good. The England ODIs will definitely help coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Rohit Sharma to finalise composition of their middle-order, and it will make a lot of sense if it revolves around Iyer.Yes, there are plenty of right-handers in the middle-order mix at the moment but India do have some flexible left-handers in the lower-order who they can seamlessly move around as per the match situation. Those movements were on display during the three ODIs vs Sri Lanka and it could well continue in the upcoming ODI assignments.Axar Patel or Ravindra Jadeja? Or both?India picked both the left-arm spin all-rounders for the T20 World Cup but only Axar played the Sri Lanka ODIs as Jadeja was rested. The selectors now need to take that tough call because Axar did exceedingly well in the T20 World Cup and looked good in the ODIs vs Sri Lanka too. Jadeja, on the other hand, last played an ODI back in November 2023.It now remains to be seen whether the management moves on from Jadeja or carries both.

Numbers elicit praise from likes of Sachin

NAGPUR: Ironic as it may sound, the buzzword in Indian cricket over the past weeks has been a non-cricketing term - PR. Fan wars on social media, ignited by the debacle in Australia, sparked debates on 'paid news' versus authenticity.With the debate still raging, a post on X went viral on social media on Thursday evening."" Karun Nair has a serious shot at making it to the Indian team if he can afford hiring a PR agency for a while,"" said the post.The witty remark struck a chord, highlighting the one element missing in Nair's arsenal - a robust social media presence. But in the Vijay Hazare Trophy , it wasn't PR that spoke for him; it was his bat, loud and clear.A total of 752 runs, at an unbelievable average of 752 was enough for Nair to trend on X. Social media has been abuzz, with many urging Indian selectors to draft Nair into the Indian squad for the forthcoming England ODI series and the Champions Trophy scheduled in Pakistan and Dubai.With an unstoppable 88* off just 44 balls on Thursday, Nair, who had been knocking on the selectors' door, almost broke it in the semifinal. Coming in to bat in the 35th over, the Vidarbha skipper unleashed his magic in the final 15 balls he played in the match, stacking up 55* runs. His ball-by-ball figures read 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 6, 6, 1, 6, 4, 0, 6, 4, 4, 6. He hit boundaries for fun and toyed with the field at will.Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar lauded Nair's run on Friday. ""Scoring 752 runs in 7 innings with 5 centuries is nothing short of extraordinary, @karun126. Performances like these don't just happen, they come from immense focus and hard work. Keep going strong and make every opportunity count,"" he posted on X.Former Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh too was vocal on his Youtube channel, questioning the double standards of selectors. ""Different rules for different people… that shouldn't be the way. When Nair is scoring runs, you need to play him, right? He doesn't have tattoos, doesn't wear fancy clothes, is that the reason you're not picking him? Does he not work hard,"" he said.Some also drew comparisons of Nair's purple patch with that of VVS Laxman before the stylish batsman was re-drafted in the Indian squad. ""When Laxman made a comeback into the Indian team, he made a big statement with 1,400-odd runs. Nair's stupendous show should be enough for him to launch his comeback,"" a post read.Nair's super show has rewritten history books too. He now tops the list of most runs as a captain in the Vijay Hazare trophy. He is also set to finish as batsman with highest average in Vijay Hazare history.Prior to being dismissed for 112 against Uttar Pradesh, Nair had set a new List A record of scoring 542 runs without being dismissed, going past former New Zealand allrounder James Franklin","Vidarbha batsman Karun Nair scores 752 runs at an average of 752 in Vijay Hazare Trophy.

Pursuing a daunting 202-run target set by the Dubai Capitals , Fernando smashed a breathtaking 81 off just 27 balls, reaching his fifty in a tournament-record 16 balls.Fernando’s explosive innings, studded with eight towering sixes and six boundaries, powered the Warriorz to victory in 18.1 overs with five wickets to spare.

You don’t usually see 202 in Sharjah, so I was pretty confident it was a strong score, and we should have been able to win the game. Shai has been a fantastic addition to the team, and hopefully, the other players around him step up as well. The wicket got better later, and the dew made it tougher.

NEW DELHI: Brazilian football star Neymar jr recently shared his perspective on the dynamics within the Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) team during his time there.In a podcast hosted by Romário, a Brazilian World Cup winner, Neymar discussed the impact of Lionel Messi's arrival at the club in August 2021.According to Neymar, his former teammate Kylian Mbappé became ""a little jealous"" after Messi joined the team. Neymar suggested that Mbappé, who has since joined Real Madrid, didn't want to share the spotlight with anyone else, leading to some conflicts and a change in behaviour.“No, he is not. I have my things with him, we had a little fight, but he was fundamental for us when he arrived. I used to call him golden boy. I always played with him, said he was going to be one of the best. I always helped, talked to him, he came to my place, we had dinner together,” Neymar said.Neymar acknowledged that he had a good partnership with Mbappé initially, referring to him as the ""golden boy"" and praising his potential to become one of the best players.“We had some good years of partnership, but after Messi came he was a little jealous. He didn't want to split me with anyone. And then there were some fights, a change in behavior,” the Brazilian further added.While Neymar didn't explicitly name individuals, he mentioned that big egos within the team often hindered their performances in crucial matches.“It is good to have egos, but you have to know that you don't play alone. There needs to be another guy by your side. (Big) egos were almost everywhere, it can't work,” Neymar said. “If nobody runs and nobody helps, it is impossible to win anything.”Neymar also reflected on the possibility of returning to Brazil after his contract with Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia expires later this year.It's worth noting that neither Mbappé nor Messi has responded to Neymar's comments as of now.","Neymar discussed the impact of Lionel Messi's arrival at Paris Saint-Germain.

Rohit won us the T20 World Cup and he was the captain when India reached the World Cup (ODI) final. Mumbai Indians won 5 IPLs under Rohit's captaincy. He stepped down in the last Test (of BGT) to give someone else the chance, how many captains have done that in the past? I look at what he has done in the last 3-5 years, one tournament can't decide.

Under his leadership, India experienced a 10-match winning streak during the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup, culminating in a final loss to Australia.However, the team also secured an ICC T20 World Cup title in 2024 and reached the final of the ICC World Test Championship 2023, where they were defeated by Australia.Since the second half of 2024, Sharma has faced challenges both as a batter and captain.

NEW DELHI: A couple of days before the national selectors meet to pick the ODI team for the three-match series against England and the ICC Champions Trophy , the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) is planning to probe why Sanju Samson did not participate in the Vijay Hazare Trophy.BCCI top brass and selectors are not happy with Samson's decision to skip the event since they have tried to ensure domestic cricket remains relevant, TOI has learnt.The Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) didn't pick the wicketkeeper after Samson expressed his unavailability for a preparatory camp ahead of the tournament. KCA secretary Vinod S Kumar had stated that the association didn't want a youngster to lose his place due to the uncertainty over Samson's availability.BCCI sources say the matter needs to be discussed before the selectors get down to picking the Champions Trophy squad on Jan 19.""The selectors and the board have been very clear on the importance of domestic cricket. Last year, Ishan Kishan and Shreyas Iyer lost central contracts for missing domestic matches without seeking permission. Even in Samson's case, the board and selectors were not given any reason why he missed the tournament. All that is known so far is that he spends much of his time in Dubai,"" BCCI sources said.Also See: Champions Trophy Fixtures 2025 Samson has been picked for the T20I series at home against England starting next week. However, since the Vijay Hazare Trophy is played in a 50-over format, it becomes a crucial tournament going into the Champions Trophy.""The selectors would want a valid reason. Otherwise, it will be difficult to consider him for the ODI season. Samson has had a bitter history with the KCA, but that needs to be sorted out for him to play in domestic cricket. It can't be that the state association and him have a misunderstanding, and he misses out on game time. He did play in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy preceding the Vijay Hazare Trophy,"" the source said.Samson is considered to be contender for one of the two wicketkeepers' spots along with Rishabh Pant KL Rahul and Dhruv Jurel. There is uncertainty over Rahul's willingness to keep wickets in longer formats since he has endured major hamstring injuries in the past two years.It will be interesting to see how the selectors balance the squad if Rahul is unavailable to keep wickets.",BCCI top brass and selectors are not happy with Samson's decision to skip the event.

What does the horoscope of struggling Prithvi Shaw say?

NEW DELHI: Astrologer Greenstone Lobo has predicted a challenging period ahead for Prithvi Shaw , the young Indian cricketer who has been struggling to find consistency in his career.In his special series, 'StarPlay: Cricket & Astrology' for TOI Sports, Lobo shared a detailed picture of Shaw's astrological analysis and what it could mean for the out-of-form cricketer.According to Lobo, Shaw’s planetary alignment indicates hurdles that could test his resolve both on and off the field. Despite his immense talent, the astrologer suggests that Shaw must navigate these turbulent phases with patience, determination, and discipline to rediscover his form.Lobo further explained, ""Shaw was born in the GREY LIZARD patch which was between 1997 to 1999 and he has a decent horoscope with planet Pluto in the GREY LIZARD avatar. Planet X is in exaltation and Planet Y is strongly placed. It's a good chart. He's a Scorpio so the passion and the intensity is definitely intact,"" Lobo explained.""He within his limited capacity on the planet has done very well for himself. In a very short time, you know sometimes what it takes for some people to earn a lifetime's income, he has earned within a very short period of time,"" Lobo added.On the pertinent question of whether he is going to see some kind of a resurrection in his career? Lobo stated, ""It doesn't look like he is going to make a huge comeback, if at all he has any kind of chance to make a comeback, I would say that the possibilities are there in 2026 when Planet Y will become stronger, so in 2026, if he does something interestingly well in the domestic cricket, then probably he may get some sort of a comeback in domestic circuit, but if you're going to talk about the international cricket, I would say that probably the chances are very very low because he will definitely be completely replaced. There is really really no place for him.""Shaw is set to be sidelined for Mumbai's upcoming Ranji Trophy matches, further extending his absence from competitive cricket. The 25-year-old last played in December during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (SMAT) but was left out of the Vijay Hazare Trophy squad.Once touted as India’s next big star, Shaw’s career has faced setbacks due to fitness concerns and discipline issues. He last represented India in 2021 and has played five Tests, six ODIs, and one T20I. Despite his undeniable talent, Shaw’s struggles to maintain consistency and address off-field issues have hindered his progress at the international level.",Astrologer Greenstone Lobo has predicted a challenging period ahead for Prithvi Shaw.

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar feels Rohit Sharma will have autonomy to decide when he retires from international cricket but acknowledged that the selectors may have a say in the matter too.India's recent 3-1 Test series loss in Australia saw Rohit struggling with the bat, scoring only 31 runs in five innings.His decision to sit out of the Sydney Test further fueled speculations about his international future, espicially in the longest format.""I believe that in Indian cricket, Tendulkar decided his future, and Rohit Sharma will decide his future. Retirement is a personal decision—how long you want to play or how much more you want to contribute is up to the player. Ultimately, though, it’s also up to the selectors—in this case, Mr. Ajit Agarkar and his team,"" said Manjrekar on an episode of 'Deep Point' podcast by Star Sports.Manjrekar also suggested that Virat Kohli should consider playing a season of County cricket in England to improve his Test game ahead of the five-match series in June. He cited Cheteshwar Pujara's example, who benefitted from the the experience of playing in Country cricket.Although the County season clashes with the Indian Premier League (IPL), Kohli could still play red-ball cricket in England, joining the India 'A' squad for the shadow series before the main Test series.Kohli had a disappointing tour of Australia, where he was often dismissed while chasing deliveries outside the off-stump.“Kohli needs to play a lot of red-ball cricket. The first Test in England is in June, while the County Championship begins in April. He could join a County team, like Pujara did, and gain valuable match practice. India can then evaluate his performances in the initial Test matches.”“If there are positive signs, he can continue. But the last thing you want is Kohli going there and struggling, as we’ve seen before. That wouldn’t be good for Indian cricket. Playing County cricket could be a very sensible move for him,” he added.Former RCB head coach and ex-India batting coach Sanjay Bangar too was optimistic about Kohli's future. He believes that Kohli's excellent fitness levels will allow him to play for several more years.“I’m still backing him. Even at 36 (years old), he’s as fit as ever. His fitness levels are remarkable, and I believe he can continue playing at the highest level.”",Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar feels Rohit Sharma will have autonomy to decide when he retires from international cricket.

NEW DELHI: Saud Shakeel and Mohammad Rizwan staged a crucial recovery for Pakistan on the opening day of the first Test against the West Indies in Multan, guiding their team to 143-4 after a shaky start.The day, curtailed by fog and poor air quality, saw only 41.3 overs bowled, with Pakistan fighting back from 46-4 when the duo came together.Shakeel remained unbeaten on 56, registering his ninth Test half-century, while Rizwan scored 51 not out, marking his 11th fifty in the format. The pair added a vital 97-run partnership to stabilize Pakistan’s innings after early damage inflicted by West Indies pacer Jayden Seales .The home side, aware of the dry and grassless nature of the Multan pitch that promises a tough batting challenge in the later stages, chose to bat first after winning the toss. However, their decision backfired early as Seales exploited the conditions to return impressive figures of 3-21 from 10 overs.Seales struck in the sixth over, inducing an edge from debutant Muhammad Hurraira (6) to wicketkeeper Tevin Imlach. Left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie then removed Shan Masood for 11, courtesy of another catch behind the stumps. Seales continued to trouble the hosts, trapping Kamran Ghulam leg-before for 5 and dismissing Babar Azam (8) with an edge, leaving Pakistan reeling at 46-4.Shakeel and Rizwan, showcasing composure and excellent shot selection, countered the three-spinner attack fielded by the West Indies. Shakeel struck four boundaries in his knock, while Rizwan hit seven. Their left-right combination provided much-needed stability to Pakistan's innings.Earlier, poor visibility caused by fog and low air quality delayed the start of play and wiped out the first session. Both teams opted for spin-heavy bowling lineups, with three spinners each and a solitary frontline pacer.The match is part of the ICC World Test Championship 's third cycle (2023-2025), with Pakistan ranked eighth and the West Indies ninth. With spin expected to play a decisive role on a deteriorating pitch, the Test promises an intriguing battle in the coming days.","Saud Shakeel and Mohammad Rizwan guide Pakistan to 143-4 on the opening day of the first Test against the West Indies in Multan.

MUMBAI: Battling poor form, senior batsman Rohit Sharma , who led Team India to the final of the 2023 ODI World Cup, is set to continue as India’s ODI captain.This was confirmed when the BCCI announced on Friday that, at 12.30pm on Saturday, Rohit will address a press conference along with chief selector Ajit Agarkar at the BCCI headquarters at the Wankhede Stadium here where the Indian team for the 2025 Champions Trophy in Dubai and Pakistan, which starts from Feb 19 and ends on March 9, and the three-match ODI series at home against England preceding that, will be picked by the national selectors.There was much speculation about Rohit's future in international cricket after he stood down from India's XI in the fifth and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy earlier this month in Sydney. However, in an interview to official telecaster, the 37-year-old clarified that the decision shouldn't be misconstrued as a retirement.In the three-Test series at home against New Zealand, all Rohit managed to score was 91 runs in six innings at an abysmal average of 15.16. His slump worsened in the BGT in Australia after that, as all he put together in three Tests (in five innings) was 31 runs@ 6.20. In a bid to rediscover his form, Rohit has even trained at the Wankhede Stadium with the Mumbai team, leading up to the second leg of the Ranji Trophy, even though he hasn’t decided to yet on his participation in Mumbai’s next Ranji match against J&K at the Mumbai Cricket Association’s ground in BKC from Jan 23.Meanwhile, afflicted by a back injury which prevented him from bowling for a major part in the fifth and final Test at Sydney, ace fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah is unlikely to be a part of the 15-man squad for the global tournament, unless the selectors decide to take a chance with him to see if he can indeed recover before the knockouts of the event.Playing all their matches in the eight-team Champions Trophy under a hybrid model in Dubai, launch their campaign against Bangladesh on Feb 20, before taking on arch-rivals Pakistan on Feb 23, and then New Zealand in their final league match on March 2.The ODIs against England are scheduled for Feb 6, 9 and 12.It will be interesting to see if the selectors pick veteran batsman Karun Nair , who has been in sensational form in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, where he has scored 752 runs in just seven innings at an incredible average of 752, with five hundreds-four on the trot, to steer Vidarbha into the VHT final for the first time will be picked for the global tournament.The BCCI and the selectors have emphasized on the importance of domestic cricket in recent times, but it won’t be easy to make space in the ODI team for Nair.“Whom do you drop if you have to pick Karun in the 15? You can't drop someone like Shreyas Iyer, who smashed a century in the 2023 ODI World Cup semifinal at the Wankhede Stadium and has been in fabulous form across formats in domestic cricket. However, there is set to be a deep discussion on Karun,” a source in the BCCI told TOI.India have played just six ODIs since their heart-breaking loss in the ODI World Cup final to Australia in Ahmedabad in Nov 2023, and lost an ODI series 2-1 in Sri Lanka in July last year.","Rohit Sharma set to continue as India’s ODI captain.

Dinesh Karthik on Lhuan-dre Pretorius, start for Paarl Royals in SA20

Jasprit Bumrah injury: Where things stand with BOOM!

Lhuan-dre Pretorius may be living life in the fast lane at the Paarl Royals in the SA20 , but the teenager’s dad Abe is still picking up traffic fines.Pretorius has burst on the global cricket scene in spectacular fashion with the former South Africa U-19 star smashing two half-centuries in three matches to top the SA20 run-scorers list.He has surprised many with the maturity he’s shown at the crease.Unfazed at the prospect of facing up to the likes of Trent Boult, Kagiso Rabada, Marco Jansen and Ottniel Baartman.But Abe Pretorius - Lhuan-dre’s father - claims his son is still just a normal teen finding his way in the world.“I remember when Anrich Nortje bowled to him. He told me an interesting story: ‘Dad, I wasn’t scared of the ball. I was more scared of me running into him because I saw it on TV.’ He was never afraid. Pace never bothered him,” said the senior Pretorius.“But he’s still a baby. He’s only 18. He has a mustache. But his beard is soft. He's still a kid and sometimes I forget.“But he's also not a kid getting all the speed fines. The car is still in my name. It's crazy!”The Pretorius family have certainly been there to support Lhuan-dre and fellow South African schools prodigy Vihan - ‘he’s my baby and can do no wrong’ - cricket aspirations since they first picked up a cricket bat.Abe installed a training net at their home in Potchefstroom early on and since they stayed close to Senwes Park - home of the North West Dragons - would regularly take his sons there to train.Lhuan-dre, therefore, had the privilege of spending time with the likes of SA20 stars Bjorn Fortuin and Rassie van der Dussen from a very young age.“He always wanted to play the game. He was brought up next to the field at Senwes Park. So, I was privileged to have a hospitality suite there. And that’s where he met Bjorn and Rassie.“He always played with them or next to the field to see them playing. And that's what's so nice. He plays now with Bjorn. There's a bit of banter going on between them.”At this critical age parents can often become over-indulged with their children’s sporting careers, forcing them to train when they may no longer enjoy it.Abe was never confronted with this issue.“He lives for cricket. He YouTubes cricket every night. I don’t think he’s watched a cartoon ever in his life. From a young age, before any big game, he would wake me up at five.“And we had a net in our yard at the back. So I needed to throw to him before school. And when he gets picked up and then he's ready in the afternoon.“I think more waking him up for academics. He never wanted to study. That was a headache and we had to get a tutor to assist him.”Whilst it was almost the perfect childhood growing up in Potchefstroom, the major cricket-playing high schools are based in Johannesburg. That’s close to 120 kilometres away.It is common practice for young South African boys to leave their family homes at 12-13 years old after being afforded scholarships to attend these ivy-league schools as hostel boarders.But Abe was having none of it. Instead, he packed up and relocated the entire family to “The Big Smoke” - as Johannesburg is colloquially referred to - for Lhuan-dre to attend the prestigious St Stithians College - alma mater of Kagiso Rabada, Grant Elliot and a certain Kwena Maphaka.The latter is, of course, the same age as Lhuan-dre with their cricket journeys following an almost identical path. They played together at school, youth provincial Lions teams, SA U19, and now at the Royals.And according to Abe, it's Lhuan-dre, who kept wicket for most of this period, that knows how to inspire the tearaway rookie fast bowler.“Lhuan-dre knew just how to switch Kwena on. He would always go up to Kwena and whisper something in his ear, and Kwena would get spitting mad,” he said.“After that, Kwena would run through the teams. There are a lot of video clips of when they were at school together, especially when Lhuan-dre was keeping. They were a mean team.”With Lhuan-dre being a left-handed opening batter that keeps wicket, has Gunn & Moore as his bat sponsor, and also having an aversion to a prospective academic career, the comparisons with Proteas and Durban's Super Giants star Quinton de Kock were inevitable.But according to Abe, Lhuan-dre would not want it any other way, and is looking forward to the Royals’ first clash against the Super Giants at Kingsmead on Thursday, January 23.“He’s had a photo up of Quinny since he was very young. He’s still Quinny’s biggest fan. He simply loved Quinny.“Everything about him is Quinny. Yeah, I think you're going to see when they're going to play each other. It's going to be a challenge. I think he's going to be a star-struck!""Everything is happening at the speed of light for Pretorius right now. If he maintains this early season momentum through SA20 Season 3, it would not be far too to suggest that the powerful left-hander could come into the reckoning as a potential replacement at the Indian Premier League (IPL) in the near future.So, how does a father keep a teenager in check when the whole world suddenly wants to give him everything his heart has always desired?“I'm Afrikaans! That's all. He knows me. I don’t play.“I'm a mining oak and I'm Afrikaans. So, he'll know his way.“That's a cultural thing. He knows how it works. You stay humble.”",Lhuan-dre Pretorius has scored two half-centuries in three matches for the Paarl Royals in the SA20. The 18-year-old has surprised many with the maturity he’s shown at the crease. Abe Pretorius says his son is still a normal teen finding his way in the world.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117332449,imgsize-38972,width-400,resizemode-4/117332449.jpg"
