Punjab cross the 300-run mark

After enduring a series of low scores on his comeback to the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy as Punjab ’s captain, Abhishek Sharma produced a breathtaking counterattack on Sunday morning, hammering a record-breaking century against a seasoned Bengal bowling attack at the Gymkhana Ground in Hyderabad.Sent out to open after Punjab opted to bat first, Abhishek found rhythm immediately. He blasted his way to a half-century in just 12 deliveries, launching into his former SunRisers Hyderabad teammate Mohammed Shami for 23 runs in a single over.The scale of the assault was astonishing. By the time he reached his fifty, the left-hander had scored 50 of his first 51 runs in boundaries, smashing five sixes and five fours to leave Bengal stunned.Alongside him, Prabhsimran Singh also fired up early, helping Punjab surge past 120 inside eight overs. Abhishek continued to muscle sixes straight down the ground, repeatedly targeting the V region with brutal precision.The carnage didn’t stop. Abhishek stormed to a century in 32 balls, finishing with 11 sixes and seven fours before reaching triple figures. This knock marked his eighth T20 hundred in 157 innings, bringing him level with Rohit Sharma.Among Indian batters, only Virat Kohli (nine) has more T20 centuries.Just last season, Abhishek smashed a 28-ball hundred against Meghalaya, the joint-fastest by any Indian in T20 cricket. He also struck 87 sixes in T20s in 2024, the most by an Indian man in a single year.With 16 sixes in this innings alone, Abhishek went past his 2024 tally, becoming the first Indian to cross 90 T20 sixes in a calendar year.Abhishek eventually departed for a spectacular 148 off 52 balls, with 16 sixes and eight fours, but not before powering Punjab to a score beyond 300. They have now become only the second Indian T20 side, after Baroda against Sikkim in 2024, to breach the 300-run barrier.",Abhishek Sharma smashes a record-breaking century for Punjab.

Bo Bichette’s injuries spark big concern as MLB analysts explain Blue Jays’ slow approach

Bo Bichette is in the news again as MLB analysts wonder why the Toronto Blue Jays have still not re-signed him. The questions grew louder this week when the team signed starting pitcher Dylan Cease to a seven-year, two hundred and ten million dollar deal. Many fans thought the team would sign Bo Bichette first because he is one of their top players. Instead, the Blue Jays chose to move fast with Dylan Cease, and that raised doubts.On Thursday, Jeff O’Neill, Bryan Hayes and Dave Feschuk spoke about this on TSN’s “Overdrive” show from Toronto. They said the delay with Bo Bichette may show that the team has concerns. They also said there could be “red flags” that the Blue Jays are thinking about before offering a long contract.Bryan Hayes said the Toronto Blue Jays may still be trying to understand Bo Bichette’s true market value. He explained that the team did not need to study Dylan Cease’s price because many teams were already ready to offer him big money.But with Bo Bichette, he said the team may be unsure about the right number. He added that Bo Bichette may also believe he should get top pay, but that does not always match what a team wants to spend.Dave Feschuk then spoke about Bo Bichette’s injury issues. He said these injuries cannot be ignored.He explained that Bo Bichette was not healthy for most of the playoffs last year. He also said that the shortstop missed a large part of the 2024 season when the Blue Jays finished last in the American League East. Dave Feschuk said these things matter because teams think carefully before giving a long contract that covers many years.Bo Bichette missed eighty-one games in the 2024 season. His injuries included right knee tendonitis, a right quad strain and a right calf strain. He missed the final month of the regular season while he was leading MLB in hits. He returned only for the World Series.Dave Feschuk also said teams may be more careful with money because the next Collective Bargaining Agreement talks will happen after the 2026 season.He said some teams believe a salary cap could arrive, so they do not want to spend too much before the MLB rules change. Bo Bichette has been a career point two nine four hitter with one hundred eleven home runs and four hundred thirty-seven RBIs. His hitting numbers remain strong, but teams must decide how his injuries will affect his future deals.Also Read: San Francisco Giants Jump Ahead Of $8.2B New York Yankees In Rising Race For Tatsuya Imai","The Toronto Blue Jays signed starting pitcher Dylan Cease to a seven-year, two hundred and ten million dollar deal.

Inside India nets in Ranchi: How Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma prepared for first ODI vs South Africa

Former India skipper Rohit Sharma ’s fluent half-century came to an abrupt end on Sunday after a brief mid-pitch consultation with Virat Kohli led to the opener deciding against reviewing an LBW decision, a call that left fans buzzing across social media during the first ODI against South Africa.The moment unfolded in the 22nd over of the Indian innings.Marco Jansen went short of a length, the ball stayed lower than expected and struck Rohit around the back thigh as he swivelled into a pull shot.The Proteas went up immediately, the umpire raised the finger, and Rohit paused, turning to non-striker Kohli for a quick word.After a few seconds of discussion, the two agreed there was no need for DRS.Rohit began the walk back, ending what had been a composed, commanding outing. Replays later suggested the delivery would have clipped the top of the stumps at worst, validating the decision to move on.Rohit departed for 57 off 50 balls, hitting five fours and three sixes, and in the process rewriting ODI history.Earlier in his innings, the 38-year-old had sent two clean hits sailing over deep midwicket off spinner Prenelan Subrayen to draw level with Shahid Afridi’s tally of 351 sixes, the previous record for most in One-Day Internationals.Moments later, a towering pull off Jansen over deep square leg carried him past the former Pakistan star.With 352 ODI sixes, Rohit is now the most prolific six-hitter the format has ever seen, achieving the feat in just 270 innings, far quicker than Afridi’s 398-match career.He also brought up his 60th ODI half-century before his exit, extending a legacy built since his debut in 2007.","Rohit Sharma's fluent half-century came to an abrupt end after a brief mid-pitch consultation with Virat Kohli led to the opener deciding against reviewing an LBW decision.

Leon Draisaitl and Connor McDavid still carry the Oilers’ offense

Leon Draisaitl made news when he gave a short and cold answer to people talking about the Edmonton Oilers’ leadership. A podcast online said the team’s top players, like Leon Draisaitl and captain Connor McDavid, were not showing enough strong direction when the team struggled. The video spread fast, and many fans talked about it. When Leon Draisaitl saw the clip, he replied with just one word: “Lol.” His reply was simple, but it got a lot of likes and showed he did not agree with the talk about weak leadership.The podcast hosts said the team’s main leaders should be the ones pulling everyone together during tough nights. They felt the Edmonton Oilers still leaned too much on older veteran players for guidance. They also said Draisaitl and McDavid are now older and should not need as much help. This started a big discussion because both players have already led the Oilers to long playoff runs.The Oilers reached the Stanley Cup Final in both 2024 and 2025. Connor McDavid played a huge role and won major awards. Leon Draisaitl also had strong numbers and scored many big points. They were the two players who pushed the team forward each year.Because of this, some fans feel the criticism is unfair, while others think it is needed for the team to grow.But even with their talent, this season has not been smooth. The Oilers have been up and down. They have wins and losses that keep them in the middle. Their offense still shines because of Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, who both continue to score and make plays. But the team’s biggest problem is still on defense. They give up too many goals, and the goalies face too much pressure each night. This hurts their chances to move up in the standings.Connor McDavid has many points this season and still drives the attack every game. Leon Draisaitl also has strong numbers and helps the team stay in games. Their power play is strong, and they create many chances. But offense alone cannot fix everything. The team needs better defense and better support if they want to reach the Stanley Cup Final again.Leon Draisaitl’s “Lol” reply showed he is not worried about outside noise.

Travis Kelce sent a resounding message on Browns rookie Shedeur Sanders



Cleveland finally felt a long awaited spark when Shedeur Sanders stepped onto the field for his first NFL start. The Browns needed someone to steady an offense that had been stuck for most of the season, and Sanders delivered a performance that shifted the mood in the city. His debut not only brought a win but also caught the attention of two of Cleveland’s most accomplished sons, Jason and Travis Kelce . Their excitement set the tone for a conversation that echoed across the league.Travis Kelce did not hide how thrilled he was. He sent a strong message to Sanders on the latest episode of New Heights, praising the rookie with all the energy fans expect from him. “Talk your sh**, Shedeur, let’s f**ing go. My dog goes in, gets his first start, gets his first dub. Let’s f*cking go, man. The 45th starting QB for the Browns since 1994. First Browns QB to win in his first official start since 1995. Cleveland’s been waiting for this. We’ve been waiting for this,” Travis said.For Travis, this moment carried extra meaning. He grew up in Cleveland, starred at the University of Cincinnati and has always kept a place in his heart for the Browns. Seeing Sanders command the offense and lead a 24 to 10 victory over the Raiders reminded him of what the city has been longing for. Jason Kelce agreed, saying Sanders brought something that had been missing. “In one game, Shedeur showed them more than they had seen, really, in any of the games with Gabriel,” he said.Jason noted that Sanders was not perfect, but his poise and timely throws stood out.Sanders went 11 for 20 for 209 yards with one touchdown and one interception. His best throw came on a play where Las Vegas brought heavy pressure. Instead of folding, he rolled right and sent a 52 yard strike to Isaiah Bond. His touchdown came later when rookie Dylan Sampson turned a screen into a 66 yard score. It was the type of play Cleveland had been desperate to see.A week earlier, Sanders struggled in relief duty. He entered cold and completed only four passes against Baltimore. This time he had preparation, rhythm and confidence. Now he faces a much tougher test when the Browns meet the 49ers. With the Kelce brothers and the city behind him, Sanders steps into Week 13 with belief and momentum on his side.Also Read: Meet Taylor Burr, the Chiefs’ breakout sideline personality who’s living her dream and charming viewers nationwide",Shedeur Sanders made his debut for the Browns against the Raiders.

Perez Hilton defends Meghan Markle in new “Green Gown-gate” talk

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry join Thanksgiving service event





Pop culture podcaster Perez Hilton has reacted to a new rumor about Meghan Markle and a green gown. This rumor started again after the trailer for Meghan Markle’s upcoming Netflix holiday special came out. In the trailer, Meghan is seen wearing a green dress. Soon, many people online began to say that this dress looked like the same $1,695 gown she wore for a Variety 2022 photoshoot. Some people online claimed she took the dress home “without asking.”These new talks grew bigger after Page Six posted a report on November 24. The outlet wrote that one source claimed Meghan “took the emerald green gown from the shoot without permission.” Another source told Page Six that Meghan was “required to archive all her looks” because of royal rules. But Page Six also added that a different source said there was no such royal rule.The rumor became huge on social media, and many people began to argue about Meghan again. So, Perez Hilton decided to speak about it. He wrote about it in his November 26 blog, saying the scandal was now called “Green Gown-gate.” He also spoke about an interview with journalist Vanessa Grigoriadis, who said the Sussexes took “a lot of stuff” after a past photoshoot.Perez Hilton reacted strongly to the dress rumor. He said the whole story sounded silly and wrote:“This sounds like a bunch of nonsense. We really doubt Meghan would steal a dress, and then wear it for her Netflix show!”Perez Hilton also said that many stars take home outfits after shoots and that Meghan Markle likely had an agreement with the designer. He added that this happens “all the time” in Hollywood. Soon after, Meghan Markle’s representative spoke to E! News and denied all the claims. The rep said:“The idea that anything was taken without the full knowledge or agreement of the stylists or their teams is false and highly defamatory. Anything kept was done with transparency and followed all contracts.”Prince Harry and Meghan Markle also made news for a good reason this week. On November 26, they spent Thanksgiving week helping the group Our Big Kitchen Los Angeles through their charity, the Archewell Foundation. The couple cooked and packed meals with their children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.In a press release, the Archewell team said they wanted to support people who are struggling with food insecurity during the holiday season.Meghan Markle also shared a warm Thanksgiving note in her As Ever brand newsletter, thanking her family and wishing everyone a happy holiday.

What Hailey Sikman and Jade Dickens said about Jammie Booker at the Texas event



Jammie Booker, 28, lost her World’s Strongest Woman title after officials said she is a biological male and also after explicit photos spread during the event. This happened at the 2025 contest in Arlington, Texas, last weekend. On Tuesday, the Official Strongman Games said they removed her win because they only allow people to compete in the category of the sex marked at birth. This pushed Andrea Thompson , 43, from Great Britain, into first place.Rivals told the Daily Mail and Fox News Digital that they only learned about Booker’s gender after the event. They said the photos and videos were sent to them later. One photo showed Booker grabbing her chest and sticking out her tongue. The Daily Mail also said competitors shared adult pictures and videos that seemed to show Booker had worked in porn. Because of this, the event became a huge controversy.Strongwomen Hailey Sikman and Jade Dickens said they felt “conned” because they did not know anything about Jammie Booker’s gender before the contest ended. Jade Dickens told Fox News Digital that she was “beyond mad.” She said, “Nobody knew he was a man.”She also said Booker was quiet, and she believed Booker’s voice might have revealed the truth.Hailey Sikman said she tried to talk to Booker during the event, but Booker did not respond. Sikman said many women felt Jammie Booker was “arrogant” and “talking s***.” They believed she kept a distance from other athletes.On Tuesday, the Official Strongman Games shared a strong statement. They said, “It appears that an athlete who is biologically male and who now identifies as female competed in the Women’s Open category.” They also said they tried to contact Booker but did not get a reply.The Daily Mail looked into claims that Booker worked in adult entertainment. Their report said Booker looks like a porn performer named Jammie Jay, and Booker also uses the TikTok name @jammiejaysvids. The IAFD (Internet Adult Film Database) shows that “Jammie Jay” was nominated at the Trans Erotica Awards in 2020 and 2022. The site also lists several adult movie titles under that name.The Daily Mail reached out to Booker and her coach but got no response. They also contacted the Official Strongman Games to ask if these photos and videos were part of the decision to remove the title.In a 2017 YouTube video, Jammie Booker said she was a “21-year-old trans woman” with a hard past and strict parents. In a July podcast with champion strongwoman Erin Murray, Booker talked about having three partners and said she uses Google Calendar to plan time with each one.She said she trains early in the morning and keeps her schedule tight so she can balance work, partners, and strongwoman training.Also Read: Why Did A Biological Male Win The World’s Strongest Woman?

How will Marcus Foligno’s injury affect Minnesota’s Wild lineup?

Marcus Foligno (#17) All 23 Goals of the 2021-22 NHL Season

The veteran winger Marcus Foligno has been placed on injured reserve by the Minnesota Wild effective November 26, after he picked up a lower-body injury in the course of the game against the Chicago Blackhawks, which went into overtime on Wednesday night. Foligno was involved in a collision with Oliver Moore and had to leave the match late in the second period, and the Wild has since called up Nicolas Aubé-Kubel from their AHL affiliate in Iowa to take his place on the roster. Minnesota is currently without five forwards, including Ryan Hartman, Vinnie Hinostroza, Marco Rossi, and Vladimir Tarasenko, while they have approximately $3.43 million in cap space.Foligno will be out for the next three games at least and can only return as early as December 4 against the Calgary Flames. This winger, who is 34 years old, has not been very productive offensively in recent times, getting only two assists in 23 games, and his average ice time of 13:07 is the lowest in the last seven years. Nevertheless, he still plays a vital defensive role, and numbers like expected goals against per 60 minutes (2.63) and scoring chances against per 60 (28.29) show that he is worth having in his own zone.The Wild have to deal with the problem of performing up to standard while the crucial forwards are out of the lineup.The head coach, John Hynes, has not given any specific time frame for Marcus Foligno’s full recovery, so Minnesota has to cope with using its depth players, together with recalled Aubé-Kubel, to keep its lineup alive.Foligno's IR placement is very timely as the team is poised to extend its winning streak to six and fortify its Central Division position. The Wild will have to make extensive ice time adjustments, change line combinations, and rethink deployment strategies to remain competitive during his absence.Foligno's injury puts additional strain on the Minnesota forwards; however, good roster management and the help from the fit players are going to be the key factors in getting through the upcoming fixtures.Also Read: NHL Updates: Montreal Canadiens re-sign defenseman Mike Matheson to a long-term extension","Marcus Foligno has been placed on injured reserve by the Minnesota Wild.

Chicago Bulls Injury Report vs the Charlotte Hornets (November 28, 2025)

Theenter their NBA Cup showdown against the Chicago Bulls on November 28, 2025, with renewed energy, thanks to. Tip-off is set for 7:30 PM ET, and for the first time in a while, Charlotte’s star point guard walks into a matchup without an injury tag shadowing him. His clean bill of health is reassuring for a fanbase that has watched him battle ankle concerns all season.Charlotte is desperate for stability, especially with their record slipping further below .500. Having Ball at the helm offers something this team has lacked in recent weeks: direction. And considering the Bulls are arriving with a battered roster and numerous rotational uncertainties, the Hornets know this is a prime opportunity to regain momentum. With Black Friday bringing a national spotlight to the tournament slate, the timing couldn’t be better.LaMelo Ball enters tonight’s contest after logging 27 minutes in Wednesday’s outing against the Knicks, where he posted 11 points, six rebounds, and four assists. Despite a rough 4-for-14 shooting night, his presence alone boosted Charlotte’s tempo and spacing. Even as whispers of ongoing ankle management persist, the official injury report listed him as fully available.That clarity allows the Hornets to lean on his signature dynamism - no-look passes, deep-range orchestration, and paint manipulation.This comes after a turbulent stretch in which Ball missed significant time due to a right ankle impingement. His return has been gradual, but the recent uptick in minutes shows that the team is confident in his durability. With Brandon Miller also cleared, Charlotte’s offensive engine finally resembles what it was designed to be earlier this season. Still, Hornets fans understand how quickly fortunes can shift if Ball tweaks the ankle again.Chicago enters Spectrum Center in disarray. The Bulls are dealing with an injury avalanche headlined by Zach Collins, who remains out with a left scaphoid fracture, and Isaac Okoro, listed as doubtful due to lumbar radiculopathy. Several others are questionable: Nikola Vucevic (knee), Coby White (calf/injury management), Patrick Williams (wrist), Kevin Huerter (pelvic contusion), and Dalen Terry (calf). In total, the Bulls could be missing up to seven rotation players.Also read: Is Joel Embiid playing tonight vs the Brooklyn Nets?

Given the Bulls’ depth concerns, the Hornets have an opportunity to control pace, dictate matchups, and punish mismatches on both ends.","Charlotte Hornets host Chicago Bulls in NBA Cup on November 28, 2025.

Donald Trump and his love for golf

The current President of the USA is known for his love of golf. In fact, he loves it so much that since he started on his second term, he has golfed 75 out of 313 days of his presidency. Which is basically about 25% of his second term. And that did not come without costing a pretty buck, as latest reports suggest that President Trump has spent more than 70 million taxpayer dollars to continue his hobby.He travels not just all around the United States, but the world to feed his obsession with the sport. From New Jersey to Scotland to Dubai, he will travel anywhere as long as it means he gets to play golf, and while it's a fun time for the president, it does cost the average American citizen a pretty penny they pay in the form of taxes.Before he became the president of the United States, Donald Trump was invested in the real estate business, and owns about 17 golf courses worldwide. And he travels all around to play golf in whichever course he pleases. Sometimes it's close to home, in Washington D.C., sometimes it's a little far away in Indonesia, but golfing hasn't stopped. On Thanksgiving Day, Trump was asked about his handicap, to which he said,""I’ve won 38 club championships and I don't get to practice....SoI'm a very low handicap, and I've won 38…everyone legitimately. So I guess I got to be around scratch or better. I beat a plus three.""Having spent 75 out of 313 days of his second presidency golfing, the president has cost American taxpayers more than $70 million, and if the numbers stay the same, by the end of his tenure, he will have spent about $300 million. He frequently travels to Florida and New Jersey by air, as well as frequents his local course in Washington, D.C. to keep his love for the sport alive. He has spent a pretty penny designing these high-end golf courses and providing every amenity possible. But the cost in comparison seems a little too much.Also Read: Donald Trump brags about golf achievements after announcing National Guard Sarah Beckstrom’s death in DC shooting","The current President of the USA is known for his love of golf.

Clayton Keller is going through one of the hardest times of his life, but the captain of the Utah Mammoth, who just lost his father, Bryan Keller, has decided to go on the ice the very next day. The matchup against the Dallas Stars is emotional for Keller, who is a 27-year-old star forward, but it is also a decision based on loyalty and his inner strength.

His communication clarified that the whole organization is together with Keller, honoring his choice and at the same time making sure that he gets the support he needs.During a period characterized by sorrow, Keller’s decision to go on and Tourigny’s calm direction reflect the strong trust and bond that exists in the Mammoth organization.Also Read: NHL Updates: Marcus Foligno placed on injured reserve, will miss upcoming games for Minnesota Wild","Clayton Keller, captain of the Utah Mammoth, lost his father, Bryan Keller, on Friday.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close. Gates has recommended five books and he believes that all these titles spark curiosity and reflection during the quieter days of the winter season. “Each of these books pulls back the curtain on how something important really works: how people find purpose later in life, how we should think about climate change, how creative industries evolve, how humans communicate,” wrote Gates.In the blog post, Gates has also explained that holidays are the perfect tome to slow down and also catch up on reading. “There’s something about the quieter days around the holidays that makes it easier to sit down with a good book,” he wrote. His list on 2025 book recommendations reflects on his fascination with how the world works and how you can start a great conversation.The book belongs to the fiction genre and its a story of an aging janitor and a wise octopus captive hime with its empathy and storytelling. “Van Pelt's story made me think about the challenge of filling the days after you stop working—and what communities can do to help older people find purpose,” said Gates.The books explains about the climate challenges. The book structures 50 big questions on climate change, nuclear power and renewables. “ I’ve followed Hannah’s work at Our World in Data for years, and her new book is one of the clearest explanations of the climate challenge I’ve read. She’s realistic about the risks but grounded in data that shows real progress,” said Gates.It is a memoir which recounts the Diller’s extraordinary career in Hollywood, media, and technology, blending personal anecdotes with reflections on power, risk-taking, and the evolution of entertainment and digital industries. “He’s spent his life betting on ideas before they were obvious, and the industries he’s transformed show how much those bets can pay off,” said Gates.The book explains about the mysteries of human behaviour and how people communicate. “Although the topic itself is pretty complicated, the book is readable and practical, and it made me see everyday social interactions in a new light,” added Gate.The books offers a glimpse of at why America seems to struggle to build things and what it will take to fix that. The book argues that progress depends not just on good ideas but on the systems that help ideas spread.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close.

CHENNAI: At 20, most athletes begin to find their place on the international stage. But for South Africa’s Jaydon Brooker, the men’s Junior Hockey World Cup is not another ‘teeth-cutting’ tournament — it is a curtain call. A farewell to the sport that shaped his childhood, long before cricket began tugging at his sleeve.For Brooker, hockey has shared space with another passion –- cricket. A professional cricketer, Brooker made his first-class debut for Potchefstroom-based team, North West. Brooker now walks the fine line between the wistfulness of an ending and the thrill of a fresh sporting pursuit.“I am still playing both sports very actively, but after the tournament, I will take the cricketing route. I am enjoying my final international hockey tournament, and from next year, I will focus on my cricket career,” Brooker, a dragflicker, told TOI from Madurai.There is a famous precedence to Brooker’s story. The legendary Jonty Rhodes was part of the South African hockey team before moving to cricket. His hockey reflexes went a long way in Jonty becoming the supreme fielder in the 1990s and 2000s.Brooker’s family has a history of playing both cricket and hockey. His uncle, Finley Brooker, played 55 first-class matches for Griqualand West. In 2017, Brooker, who also featured in the 2023 edition of the competition, received a hockey scholarship from Jeppe High School, Johannesburg's oldest public school and an institution with a rich cricketing tradition. He represented the school’s U-14 cricket team. “I first played hockey and then took up cricket at nine. There is a tradition of hockey in my family, so I decided to follow that path,” Brooker said.","South Africa's Jaydon Brooker is a professional cricketer.

Coi Leray and Justin LaBoy’s growing visibility follows months of hints



Coi Leray drew attention at the Boston Celtics vs Cleveland Cavaliers showdown after appearing courtside with media personality Justin LaBoy. Their arrival at Rocket Arena added another layer of intrigue to a night already filled with high-pressure basketball.Fans online had plenty to say about the pair sitting together, and the buzz only grew as clips circulated from the arena. The moment became part of the larger conversation around their recent public outings and the signals they continue to send.The Celtics delivered a tense 117-115 win despite missing two key starters, and the game’s energy seemed to match the reaction that followed the Leray and LaBoy sighting.Coi Leray and Justin LaBoy appeared courtside at the Celtics vs Cavs on November 30. The caption reflected the tone of fans who noticed how comfortable they looked sitting together. Their presence at such a competitive matchup added fuel to a conversation that began weeks earlier when Justin LaBoy posted a photo hugging her from behind with the words, “MY COIIIII #RESPECTFULLY.” Videos from that same night showed him smiling as he said, “This my girl,” which only intensified the commentary.Their courtside appearance arrived at a moment when the Celtics earned a hard-fought win behind Jaylen Brown’s triple-double and Payton Pritchard’s standout 42-point performance.Pritchard sealed the game with two free throws in the final seconds. Afterward, he said, “I was disappointed with how I played last night in Minnesota, so I wanted to come out here and give it everything I’ve got tonight and try to pull out this win on a back-to-back. ”Coi Leray and Justin LaBoy have appeared together often since mid-September, when he first shared the photo that set off the guessing game.

God said, ‘Everybody gon’ drop her for you. ’ It’s a blessing” (per Rap-Up).The interest only grew when Leray told viewers she preferred men who stay low-key and admitted she had linked with someone she “actually like.” She later described LaBoy as the “most amazing man on earth,” which pushed speculation beyond rumor territory.Also Read: Luka Doncic and fiancée Anamaria Goltes share adorable moments of their daughter’s second birthday",Coi Leray and Justin LaBoy appeared courtside at the Celtics vs Cavs on November 30.

Sitanshu Kotak press conference: Big statement on Virat Kohli, India win and more

RANCHI: Studies have shown that couples often tend to resemble each other in a long-standing relationship. And 102 innings together, spanning over 15 years scoring 5619 runs with 20 century stands and 17 half-century partnerships, is indeed long enough.So, when an animated Rohit Sharma applauded Virat Kohli ’s record-extending 52nd ODI ton here on Sunday with a few choice expletives which would be a delight for lip-readers, it looked like some of his longtime partner’s characteristics had rubbed off on him after all these years. Characteristically, the Mumbai man is famous for his cool and relaxed attitude on and off the field, while King Kohli is known for wearing his heart on his sleeve. On Sunday, it was as if Rohit was completing Kohli’s sentences.If you paused to regard the emotion Rohit laid bare in those few seconds, it becomes evident that the Hitman is making a statement for both the veterans of the format. That Ro-Ko is clearly here to stay on their own despite all the murmurs of their ODI retirement plans. While Kohli notched up his 83rd international ton at JSCA International Stadium, Rohit scored a 51-ball 57 with five boundaries and three maximums.In the process, the former India captain went atop the list of batters with most number sixes in ODIs — 352. The duo is now third on the list of highest overall partnership runs by a pair in ODIs, behind only Sourav Ganguly-Sachin Tendulkar (8227 runs) and Mahela Jayawardene-Kumar Sangakkara (5992). Ro-Ko surpassed another Sri Lankan pair of Tillakaratne Dilshan and Sangakkara on Sunday. With the 50-over World Cup in South Africa in two year’s time, the two of the all-time greats once again showed why they are still invaluable in the ODI set-up along with other seniors in the side.While stand-in skipper KL Rahul scored a 56-ball 60 at No. 6, all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja proved his worth down the order with 32 off 20 balls. However, the players looking to break into the XI or trying to cement their place failed to utilise the opportunities coming their way due to the unavailability of regulars like Shubman Gill, Shreyas Iyer in the lineup.Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal (18) flattered to deceive after a brisk start; Ruturaj (8) failed at No. 4 while allrounder Washington Sundar, who came at No. 5 ahead of Rahul, returned after scoring only 13. Though the Maharashtra opener had to bat in the middle order leaving his regular slot, it was Gaikwad’s fourth consecutive sub-10 score in ODIs.The onus was on the senior pros to give their bowling unit a big total to defend. Rohit has publicly talked about his desire to play the 2027 World Cup after the final heartbreak at home in 2023. Shedding 10 kilos ahead of the Australia tour in Oct and looking fitter than ever, Rohit’s intention is quite clear.Kohli, with 49 runs of his 135 coming by running between the wickets on Sunday – and 42 of those being singles – is as fit as ever and conducted a fine class on how to build an ODI innings. Despite all the noise and chatter swirling around, the ODI batting greats of India are still carrying responsibility with aplomb.",Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli have been together for over 15 years. The pair have scored 5619 runs with 20 century stands and 17 half-century partnerships. Kohli scored his 52nd ODI ton while Rohit scored a 51-ball 57 with five boundaries.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125684920,imgsize-93344,width-400,resizemode-4/virat-kohli-and-rohit-sharma.jpg"

What the Yankees Rotation Would Look Like With Peralta

Why This Move Makes Financial Sense for New York

The New York Yankees may have no choice but to answer the Toronto Blue Jays’ aggressive offseason moves, especially after Toronto landed Dylan Cease on a massive deal. Following a frustrating exit in the 2025 ALDS at the hands of their division rivals, the Yankees are now predicted to counter with a major swing of their own: a blockbuster trade for Milwaukee Brewers ace Freddy Peralta.Bleacher Report’s Joel Reuter, as cited by writer TJ Morin, laid out why this move feels both urgent and realistic. According to Reuter, “swinging for the fences with a blockbuster deal to acquire Freddy Peralta would give them a rotation that stacks up to any in baseball once everyone is healthy.” (H/t: Sporting News)The hypothetical trade centers around Peralta, a two-time All-Star who carries a manageable $15.5 million salary. The Yankees would be buying elite value without the luxury-tax damage typically tied to acquiring top-end pitching.Here’s how the predicted trade looks:This deal would send three pitching prospects to Milwaukee while delivering an immediate frontline starter to New York.New York Yankees’ rotation depth has taken several hits. Gerrit Cole, Carlos Rodón, and Clarke Schmidt are all expected to open the season on the injured list.That leaves the front office balancing competitiveness with cost control, especially after acquiring Max Fried earlier in the offseason.• Multiple starters sidelined to start the year• Need to match Toronto’s Dylan Cease acquisition• Pressure to contend in a tightening AL East• Desire to add high-end talent without escalating payrollPeralta fits each of these needs.Freddy Peralta is coming off one of the strongest years of his career, putting together ace-level production across the board. His combination of strikeout power and durability makes him a perfect match for the Yankees’ long-term outlook.These numbers place him among the most valuable starters in baseball and explain why his contract is viewed as a bargain.If this predicted trade becomes reality, the Yankees could field a rotation that rivals the Dodgers for the best in baseball.Projected Yankees Rotation (Fully Healthy)Slot Pitcher1 Gerrit Cole2 Max Fried3 Carlos Rodón4 Freddy Peralta5 Cam SchlittlerThis group features power pitching, postseason experience, and a rare mix of frontline arms. Analysts already see it as potentially the strongest rotation in MLB outside of Los Angeles.The Yankees want to contend without pushing their payroll deeper into luxury territory. Peralta’s contract - under $16 million per year - offers top-tier production at mid-tier cost. In today’s market, that kind of efficiency is rare.Key financial advantages:• Peralta is an All-Star-level starter at a midrange salary• No long-term mega-contract risk• Freedom to maintain flexibility for future acquisitions• Helps balance the roster until Cole, Rodón, and Schmidt returnThe value proposition is clear: elite pitching at an affordable number.The Yankees were already facing pressure to respond after being eliminated by the Blue Jays in the 2025 ALDS. Toronto signing Dylan Cease only widened the gap. A Freddy Peralta trade could close it.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Baltimore Orioles proposed to pursue $6.5 million Washington Nationals All-Star ace after missed Dylan Cease signing If New York wants to stay in the championship conversation without ballooning its payroll, this predicted move checks every box.

Max Verstappen wins Qatar Grand Prix 2025

Where did Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris go wrong in Qatar?



What’s next in Formula 1?



It was Max Verstappen’s day at the Qatar Grand Prix on Sunday as the Red Bull star moved closer to his dream of winning a fifth F1 Championship title. The Red Bull driver managed to get ahead of pole-winner Oscar Piastri in the race as well as in the Drivers’ Standings, and ahead of the current championship leader Lando Norris, in the penultimate round of the season at the Lusail International Circuit. This is the first time in 15 years that three drivers are in contention for the title going into the final round of the F1 Championship, to be held in Abu Dhabi this year.After giving his fans a massive reason to celebrate, Max Verstappen shared a bunch of celebratory moments on his Instagram page after the race. He captioned it: “Yes!!! Incredible strategy @redbullracing, what a team. We’re still in it,” along with clapping and flexed-biceps emojis. His girlfriend Kelly Piquet showered the post with several heart emojis in the comments section.Four-time world champion Max Verstappen had recently said that had he been driving the McLaren, he would have won the championship much earlier. The 28-year-old told F1 TV, “We wouldn't be talking about a championship. It would already have been won, easily. I mean they (McLaren) won the constructors' championship so early that yeah ...you can fill it in yourself.”Williams driver Carlos Sainz joined Verstappen and Oscar Piastri on the podium. He managed to push Norris to the fourth position. Mercedes driver George Russell, who was expecting a podium in Qatar, finished sixth.After winning the F1 Sprint a day earlier, Oscar Piastri also secured pole position. But the 24-year-old could only finish second. He said, with disappointment writ large on his face, “Feeling pretty ***** as you can imagine. The pace was strong and I didn't put a foot wrong. I left it in the team's hands to decide what to do as they have more information than I do. I just need to drive like I did this weekend, that was more than enough to dominate this weekend. ”Lando Norris still looked confident despite finishing fourth in the race. The McLaren driver continues to lead the F1 Championship. He is 12 points ahead of Max Verstappen in the Drivers’ Standings.Speaking after crossing the finish line, Norris said, “It's tough. We just have to have faith in the team making the right decision. It was us that took a gamble in a way. And we lost it, Oscar lost the win and I lost P2. Not our finest day, but that is life. [Red Bull] did a better job as a team, they made the right call. You can't get them all right. We just need to do a better job, I'll do my job and we'll be fine.”McLaren team principal Andrea Stella accepted that it was a mistake on the team’s part not to pit. “It is a disappointing result overall. We had the potential to win the race with Oscar, and he deserved that. And the podium was available for Lando. So we lost the victory for Oscar and the podium for Lando. We need to review the decision we made with the Safety Car. It was a decision not to pit. We did not expect everyone else to pit. When you are the lead car, you do not know what everyone else will do. It would have been a loss to Lando with the double stack, but the decision was due to not expecting everyone else to pit,” he said.Next is the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, which will mark the end of the ongoing F1 season. It is scheduled to begin on December 5, with the final race on December 7. The finale will be held at the Yas Marina Circuit at 5 pm local time (6:30 pm IST).Also Read: Qatar Grand Prix: Novak Djokovic lights up podium as Oscar Piastri wins F1 Sprint, Lewis Hamilton’s remark sparks buzz",Max Verstappen wins Qatar Grand Prix ahead of Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris.

MeltIsLIVE’s high-speed crash reignites broader concerns about IRL streaming safety





In a shocking incident that left viewers stunned, Twitch streamer MeltIsLIVE survived a high-speed car crash that unfolded live on stream over the weekend. The clip, which has since exploded across social media, shows the streamer speeding down a Georgia highway late at night with multiple passengers in the vehicle. Moments before the impact, the car suddenly jerks out of control, and seconds later the stream violently shakes as the vehicle slams into another car and skids across the roadway. Panic immediately filled the chat as viewers watched the chaos unfold in real time.The incident took place Saturday near the Spring Street and Pine Street exits in Atlanta, an area known for heavy late-night traffic flow. Emergency services reportedly arrived quickly, though neither MeltIsLIVE nor Atlanta Police have released official updates about his condition. Footage suggests he was wearing a seatbelt at the time, which may have helped him avoid serious injury. As the clip continues to spread, fans have expressed both relief at his survival and deep concern over the dangers associated with livestreaming while driving at high speeds.The most pivotal moment of the crash came immediately after the loud impact, when the stream abruptly fell into a tense silence broken only by muffled noises inside the car.Thousands watching feared the worst as the camera captured the aftermath in near darkness. MeltIsLIVE later clarified that he had not been reading chat or using his phone, but many viewers and creators argue that livestreaming itself, especially during high-risk activities like speeding, is an unnecessary distraction.This is not MeltIsLIVE’s first streaming-related accident. In April 2024, he clipped another vehicle while driving distractedly, a moment that similarly sparked backlash online. Critics point out that the pursuit of adrenaline-filled IRL content has pushed some creators toward increasingly reckless behavior, often at the expense of their own safety and that of others on the road. Some community members are now calling for stricter platform penalties, including temporary or even permanent bans for driving-stream incidents.MeltIsLIVE’s survival has brought immense relief to fans, but the Atlanta crash serves as yet another cautionary moment for the broader streaming community. As IRL content continues to grow, both creators and platforms may need to rethink how far livestreaming should go, especially when lives are at stake. For now, viewers are simply grateful the streamer walked away from the terrifying wreck and hope it prompts meaningful changes in streamer safety expectations.Also Read: Twitch feud intensifies as Adin Ross targets Hasan in ban-appeal stunt"," Twitch streamer MeltIsLIVE survived a high-speed car crash that unfolded live on stream over the weekend.

Luke Nichols films Alaska snowstorm trip for Steven from MyLifeOutdoors





Luke Nichols, who runs the Outdoor Boys YouTube channel, has stepped in to help another creator, Steven from the MyLifeOutdoors channel, as Steven takes time off to care for his wife after her cancer diagnosis. This is the most important part of the story, and it sets the stage for everything that follows. Luke shares this right at the start of the new video so fans understand why he is filling in.This moment also comes during Luke’s own break from YouTube. Months ago, Luke told his viewers that he needed to step away because life had become too busy. His Outdoor Boys channel grew very fast, more than 12 million new subscribers in just 18 months. By May 2025, he had nearly 15 million subscribers. Luke said all the attention made things hard for his family. People recognized him everywhere, and constant messages became too much. He said the rise felt “overwhelming,” and he wanted to stop before things got “out of hand.”So even though Luke is on a break, he came back for one reason, to help Steven. Luke said he wanted Steven to “worry about one thing at a time.” That one thing right now is his wife and their four children.This simple, kind act sets the tone for the whole story and shows how much the YouTube community supports each other.In the new video posted on the MyLifeOutdoors channel, Luke goes to Alaska to film a full outdoor trip. The video is titled Camping in Snowstorm With No Tent, No Sleeping Bag. The trip starts fast because Luke has only two hours before sunset. He looks around and finds a fallen birch tree with a big root ball. He uses that root ball to build a warm shelter and makes a fire to get ready for a very long night that he says will last 17 hours.Luke Nichols gathers a large pile of firewood, reviews outdoor gear in Steven’s usual style, and cooks moose stew over the fire. As he walks around the snowy area, he warns viewers about thin ice on the creek and shows water flowing under it. He keeps things light and jokes that he is “getting a late start,” which is something Steven often says in his own videos.Near the end, Luke asks fans to support Steven during his family’s hard time. He encourages viewers to subscribe to MyLifeOutdoors and watch older videos because it would “mean a lot to them.” The final scene shows Luke digging his car out of deep snow and driving out of an unplowed lot before heading home.Also Read: Who Is Keith Castillo?

Maga 'Civil War': Nikki Haley's Son Nalin BLASTS Ramaswamy's 'Third World Parenting' Style





Nalin Haley, the son of former South Carolina governor and US diplomat Nikki Haley, on Sunday, responded sharply to people calling him a “nepo baby” and a “spoiled brat”.Political activist Olivia Julianna called him a “nepo baby” and said he sounded like a “spoiled brat” every time he appeared on television. She also said she had “earned” her place without any help from her parents.Nalin reacted: “Spoiled brat for standing up to greedy corporations and wanting my friends and fellow Americans to have jobs, affordability and safety?” he wrote. He said he had received “zero help” from his parents and accused critics of assuming he got opportunities because of his family.Another commentator joined the criticism, saying it was unclear whether Nalin was “the public face of some op or just another rich kid railing against strawmen.” He argued that he ignored issues that were actually hurting young people, such as rising college costs and housing barriers, and accused him of choosing “performative” arguments instead.A few days ago, Nalin clashed with Canadian anti-transgender activist Chris Elston, who said that young men with a “woe-is-me attitude” needed to “snap out of it.” Nalin replied that his comments were being misread.“This isn’t about me,” he wrote. “I have a good job. This is about my friends and my generation who worked hard to get degrees in Business, Computer Science and Engineering and can’t get jobs because they have to compete with foreigners working for half their paycheque and with AI.”The wave of criticism followed Nalin's interview with the New York Post, where he said many of his friends were unemployed more than a year after graduating, despite doing everything “they were supposed to.” He said he believed the recent victory of Democrat Zohran Mamdani showed widespread frustration among young voters across political lines.","Nalin Haley, the son of former South Carolina governor and US diplomat Nikki Haley, on Sunday, responded sharply to people calling him a ""nepo baby"" and a ""spoiled brat"" The wave of criticism followed Nalin's interview with the New York Post, where he said many of his friends were unemployed more than a year after graduating.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125682882,imgsize-24396,width-400,resizemode-4/1280720-2025-12-01t061203984.jpg"
