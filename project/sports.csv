‘Accident’ that wasn’t: Bengaluru techie crashes SUV twice to finish off friend; cops uncover chilling dashcam truth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/dashcam-shows-techie-ramming-suv-into-wall-killing-friend-clinging-to-car/articleshow/127583686.cms,"Bengaluru Headlines Today — The Biggest Updates You Need to Know.





BENGALURU: What a passer-by reported as a road crash turned out to be bone-chilling act of murder on Ananthnagar Road in Electronics City late Sunday evening. The deceased, Prashanth M, 33, and accused, Roshan Hegde, 36, were friends, said police. Roshan works as a software engineer with a firm in Domlur.The murder came to light when M Narayana, DCP (Electronics City), noticed the car dashcam and ordered the footage to be examined. Police said Roshan intentionally crashed the SUV twice to kill Prashanth -- who was clinging to the front-left side of the car -- after driving for 600 metres.Prashanth was a resident of Veerasandra in Electronics City. Roshan is a resident of Vignananagar and a native of Udupi district.Based on a complaint by Prashanth's mother Anu, police have registered a murder case against Roshan.A passerby mistook the scene for a road crash and alerted police, following which, Roshan was rushed to a hospital. The case was initially treated as an accident until M Narayana, DCP (Electronics City), noticed the dashcam on the vehicle and ordered the footage to be examined.Dashcam footage revealed that Roshan had suddenly accelerated and deliberately rammed the vehicle, an SUV, first against a compound wall and then reversed and crashed it again against a tree.In the twin blows, victim Prashanth, who was clinging on the vehicle from outside, suffered serious injuries and died on the spot.""After confirming it was an intentional act, we went to the hospital where Roshan was undergoing treatment. Doctors informed us that his tongue was almost severed and that he underwent a minor surgery. He was discharged on Monday and was taken into custody for interrogation,"" Narayana told TOI.Police said a group of men had gathered to play cricket in Kammasandra on Sunday evening and later consumed alcohol. In a drunken stupor, Prashanth allegedly approached Roshan, seeking a lighter and abused him, triggering an argument. ""In a fit of rage, Roshan assaulted Prashanth and both attacked each other with beer bottles. As the situation escalated, Roshan got into his Tata Safari and tried to leave,"" the police officer said.As Roshan drove away, Prashanth jumped onto the SUV's left footboard and clung on to the front-left window. Dashcam footage showed Roshan initially driving around 35 kmph before accelerating on a deserted stretch, ramming the vehicle into a compound wall, reversing it, and crashing into a tree.Police said the dashcam also captured the two abusing and threatening each other, adding that Sunday's altercation was the fallout of a feud during a cricket match played Saturday.","Prashanth M, 33, and accused, Roshan Hegde, 36, were friends.

While his fan base is large and organized, the success of TVK hinges on converting this popularity into votes, a challenge that has tripped up other stars.

Possibilities for TVK

NEW DELHI: When Prashant Kishor entered Bihar’s electoral arena with Jan Suraaj, he set out to challenge the state’s entrenched caste politics with a different pitch — one centred on governance failures, migration and the promise of jobs. The message found an audience. The votes, however, did not follow.Kishor’s transition from celebrated strategist to politician fell short, highlighting just how hard it is for political outsiders to break through systems built on long-standing loyalties and social networks.A case in contrast was Arvind Kejriwal, who left his government job and formed the Aam Aadmi Party after the successful India Against Corruption campaign.Kejriwal made his mark in his first electoral outing by winning 28 out of 70 seats, and thereafter, in subsequent elections, he went on to sweep the Delhi Assembly.As Tamil Nadu prepares for another assembly election, a familiar outsider story is taking shape once again. Actor Vijay Thalapathy has positioned himself as an alternative for the people in a state where politics, for a very long time, has revolved around the Dravida Munnetra Kashagan (DMK) and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK).But will Vijay face the same fate as Prashant Kishor, or will he do a Kejriwal? There is one key difference. This is Tamil Nadu — a state where cinema does not merely entertain, but also governs.Film stars are worshipped like gods in Tamil Nadu. Before the screening of their films, fans offer milk baths on towering cut-outs of these stars. Many stars even have temples across the state.This level of popularity could be one of the reasons that motivates these stars to pivot to politics and attempt to transform their fan base into a voter base. The best examples are M G Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa, who withdrew from active stardom and went on to occupy the top job in the state. While MGR served as chief minister of Tamil Nadu for more than a decade, Jayalalithaa was chief minister for over 14 years across six terms.Similarly, several other actors like Rajinikanth, Kamal Haasan, Sivaji Ganesan and Vijayakanth have experimented with politics and turned into full-time politicians.However, many stars were unable to convert their stardom into votes and fell flat during polls.Kamal Haasan launched his party - Makkal Needhi Maiam - in February 2018, positioning it as a centrist, non-Dravidian alternative to the DMK and AIADMK. However, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the party failed to win a single seat. In the 2021 Tamil Nadu assembly elections, Kamal Haasan himself contested from Coimbatore South but lost to the BJP.Additionally, MNM could garner only a little over 2.6 per cent of the statewide vote, as per electoral records.In March 2024, MNM joined the DMK-led Secular Progressive Alliance ahead of the general elections, choosing alliance-building over ideological isolation. Haasan was subsequently offered a Rajya Sabha seat as part of the alliance’s power-sharing arrangement.Rajinikanth, too, had made a euphoric announcement to his fans that he would launch a political party, claiming that his outfit would contest all 234 assembly seats in the state.However, he soon made a U-turn and dropped the plan to take the plunge into politics, citing health concerns.“With extreme sadness, I say that I can’t enter politics. I alone know the pain I went through while announcing this decision,” Rajinikanth said in a three-page statement.“Without entering electoral politics, I will serve the people. This decision of mine will disappoint my fans and people, but please forgive me,” he added.Unlike Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan, Vijay has decided to bid farewell to films after a long career spanning 33 years.His upcoming film Jana Nayagan (if released) would be his last.“Politics is not a time pass for me. It is a deep quest. I wish to immerse myself completely in politics. I have decided to dedicate myself entirely to the service of the people after completing my responsibilities towards one more film I have signed up for,” the 51-year-old Vijay said.Meanwhile, actors like Kamal Haasan and Vijayakanth had to face unfavourable electoral results after deciding to remain active in both films and politics.By stepping away from cinema altogether, Vijay is attempting to address a credibility gap that has historically hurt actor-politicians. Full-time political commitment — rather than episodic engagement between film releases — has often been a prerequisite for voter trust in Tamil Nadu, as demonstrated by stalwarts like MGR and Jayalalithaa in the state.Ahead of the upcoming elections, TVK has been successful in pulling crowds. In October 2024, TVK drew over 8 lakh people during its first state conference in Vikravandi.Thousands of people attend Vijay’s rallies to hear him speak or catch a glimpse of him. The superstar has supporters across every class, gender and age group in different regions of Tamil Nadu.Unlike many film stars, Vijay’s supporters are organised and politically active. In the 2021 local body polls, his “fan club” candidates won 115 of the 169 seats they contested.Meanwhile, his fan clubs have also taken on the role of foot soldiers on social media and regularly conduct blood-donation camps, free medical check-ups, education support drives and disaster-relief work.Additionally, TVK has a significant social media presence. Vijay has claimed that his party has the largest social media force in India.“TVK’s social media army is the biggest in India — not just our claim, but what others are saying after witnessing it. You are no longer just fans on social media; you are TVK’s virtual warriors,” he had said.Yet, Tamil Nadu’s electoral history suggests that crowd mobilisation does not automatically translate into seat conversion. Booth-level organisation, caste arithmetic and alliance mathematics continue to play a decisive role — factors that even popular actors have struggled to master in their first electoral outings.After the Karur stampede, Vijay’s die-hard fans defended him and his party even after the top leadership of TVK went off the radar.However, Vijay and his party may also have to bear the brunt of the stampede in Karur, which claimed 41 lives. Both the AIADMK and DMK have pinned the blame on TVK functionaries and accused Vijay of mismanagement that allegedly led to chaos in September last year.Moreover, the CBI is also grilling Vijay over the stampede, taking up a significant chunk of his time that could otherwise have been used for pre-poll strategy or campaigning.On January 19, the central probing agency questioned the TVK chief for over six hours at its headquarters in New Delhi for the second time in connection with the stampede case.According to officials, several questions related to decision-making about the rally, reasons for his delay, continuation of the speech, his knowledge of the chaos, turnout and crowd mismanagement were put to him.The call on attributing responsibility to individuals in the chargesheet will be taken only after a thorough analysis of the statements of the actor, senior political officials of his party, and police and district administration officials involved in granting clearance and managing the rally, they said.Politically, the impact of the probe remains ambiguous. While rival parties have sought to frame the stampede as evidence of administrative inexperience, sections of Vijay’s support base view the investigation as pressure politics — a narrative that could either erode confidence or consolidate sympathy, depending on how the case unfolds closer to polling.Since Independence — barring a brief stint of Congress rule — the chief minister’s post in Tamil Nadu has largely alternated between the two Dravidian parties — DMK and AIADMK. Vijay’s entry into state politics as a challenger has given voters a third option.At the same time, Vijay’s emergence has introduced new calculations for both the DMK and AIADMK. While the DMK appears wary of losing sections of its youth and urban vote, the AIADMK is closely watching whether TVK dents its traditional base or cuts deeper into the ruling party’s support.Amid reports that the BJP has been pressuring him to join the NDA — citing the CBI inquiry into the Karur stampede and the CBFC sitting on the certification of his film Jana Nayakan — Vijay has said he will not give in to any pressure.He said TVK would contest the assembly elections on its own and win if other parties chose not to align with it. “Unlike the party that ruled and the one that is ruling, we will not allow corruption … I won’t touch a paisa, you know that I don’t need to touch that,” Vijay said, asking his party functionaries and cadres to be as clean.Cleaning up the system cannot be done overnight, he said, adding, “It’s a process.”Even if TVK were to emerge only as the third-largest party, its presence could still alter Tamil Nadu’s political arithmetic. In a fractured mandate, a strong TVK showing could place Vijay in the role of a potential kingmaker — reshaping alliances and bargaining power within the state.In a tripartite contest, it will be interesting to see whether Vijay can emerge as a winner — or whether his entry ends up splitting votes to the advantage or disadvantage of the DMK or AIADMK.Just as the box office determines whether a film is a hit or a flop, election results will reveal whether Vijay succeeds or fails in his political endeavour.","Actor Vijay Thalapathy has launched a political party, TVK, in Tamil Nadu. The actor has decided to quit films after 33 years to enter politics. Tamil Nadu politics has been dominated by the Dravida Munnetra Kashagan (DMK)","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127623112,imgsize-855573,width-400,resizemode-4/127623112.jpg"

Is there a possibility of 4B in India then?



These lines are not lifted from the script of an ultra-feminist film where the protagonist finally walks away from patriarchy in the closing scene.They are spoken to real women, in real classrooms, playgrounds, homes, and workplaces, in response to the question: 'What is it that you got to hear because you are a woman?'When asked if they took any action against it, the answer was mostly negative.And yet, in some parts of the world, women have begun doing something radical: they have stopped trying to negotiate with patriarchy altogether. In South Korea, a small but radical feminist movement emerged in the late 2010s that rejected not just misogyny, but the social institutions built around it. Called 4B — short for— the movement is where women opt out of four things entirely.No marriage.No childbirth.No dating.No sex.The terms sound radical, but they are, at their core, a language of refusal to participate in patriarchal norms.Known as the 4B movement, the name comes from four Korean words beginning with, meaning “no”:(no marriage),(no childbirth),(no dating), and(no sex). Together, they form a clean break from heterosexual relationships as they are traditionally structured in South Korea.“Patriarchy breaks every sense of one's existence. As much as you might want to resist you somehow see yourself being a part of it. It's a sad state because then you don't feel honest but also can't help,” said Varalika Aditya Singh, who studied law, and is currently “figuring out new normal after marriage”.“Breakthrough from the entire conditioning is important. I don't believe we can resist and also be a part of it,” she added.Like earlier “separatist” feminist movements, 4B is not about personal lifestyle branding so much as political resistance: a rejection of institutions many women see as pipelines to unpaid labor, diminished autonomy, and systemic inequality.“Patriarchy’s hold on women runs so deep that from the moment they are born until they die, the dark, unyielding shadow of men follows them everywhere,” said Bhagya Luxmi, a former journalist.There’s no exact incident that triggered the movement, no single spark that neatly explains why some South Korean women began collectively opting out of marriage, motherhood, dating, and sex. Instead, 4B coalesced through accumulation—years of online hostility, public violence, and institutional indifference layering into something heavier than outrage: resolve.The backdrop was already hostile. In the early 2010s, the rise of Ilbe Storage, a notoriously misogynistic online forum, helped harden what became known as South Korea’s “gender wars,” normalising slurs, rape jokes, and open contempt for women in mainstream digital culture. Against this tide, feminist counter-spaces began forming. By 2015, ideas that would later define 4B—no marriage, no childbirth, no dating, no sex—were circulating within the Megalia community, which became known for its use of “mirroring” tactics: reflecting misogynistic language back at men to expose its violence and absurdity.In mid-2016, resistance took on a physical form with the emergence of the “escape the corset” movement. Young women rejected South Korea’s rigid beauty standards by cutting their hair short and destroying makeup on camera, reframing appearance as a site of control and reclaiming bodily autonomy—an ethos that would feed directly into 4B’s refusal of gendered expectations.Later that year, the Gangnam Station femicide, in which a woman was murdered by a stranger who said women had ignored him, shattered any lingering illusion that misogyny was merely rhetorical. Mass protests followed. Around the same time, the release of a so-called “pink birth map,” which reduced women to their reproductive potential, further inflamed feminist anger by rendering women as demographic tools rather than citizens.By 2017, the term “4B” itself began appearing on Daum Cafe forums and Twitter, as South Korea’s own #MeToo movement gained traction and feminist networks tightened. Through 2017 and 2018, these online circles solidified the movement, propelled by the aftershocks of the Gangnam murder and a growing wave of sex crime scandals, including illegal filming and image-based abuse. By 2019, 4B had achieved broader recognition on social media, peaking in visibility before declining domestically—even as its ideas continued to reverberate beyond South Korea’s borders.In that sense, 4B was not born of a moment but of momentum: a slow, collective decision that participation itself had become a liability.The conditions that produced 4B in South Korea are not exceptional—and in India, the parallels are often stark.As in South Korea’s “gender wars,” India’s digital spaces have increasingly normalised misogyny. In 2020, theincident exposed a private Instagram group of teenage boys sharing morphed images of underage girls, issuing rape threats, and casually discussing sexual violence.What unsettled many observers was not just the content but its ordinariness: the ease with which entitlement and cruelty flourished in supposedly liberal, urban spaces. Much like South Korea’s Ilbe Storage, the episode revealed how online ecosystems can incubate misogyny long before it escalates into physical harm.India’s reckoning with gendered violence, however, predates social media scandals. The 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder in Delhi remains a defining rupture—a moment comparable to South Korea’s Gangnam Station femicide. The crime triggered mass protests, legal reforms, and global attention. Yet the burden of change fell unevenly. Women were urged to be vigilant and resilient; institutions were reformed on paper, while everyday patriarchy remained structurally intact.The scale of violence women face in India remains stark. According to the NCRB’sreport, cases of crimes against women rose slightly by 0.7% in 2023, from 4.45 lakh to 4.48 lakh cases. As in previous years, the most common crime was cruelty by husband or relatives, which made up nearly 30% of all cases—about 1.33 lakh incidents, affecting 1.35 lakh women. While this category saw a small dip from 2022, it continues to dominate the data, underscoring how violence is often rooted inside the home. The NCRB also recorded 29,670 rape cases in 2023, involving 29,909 victims, with over 10,700 cases still pending from the previous year. Most victims were young: nearly 20,000 were between 18 and 30 years old, and 852 were children, including some below the age of six.Shravya Singh, a teenager who studies in a co-ed school in Ranikhet, recalled the differences in treatment meted out to boys and girls in her school""I remember once, when I was standing with a friend, a teacher came up to us and said that your body looked 'heavy' and the shirt looked ‘odd’ and asked to go sit in the medical room instead,” she recalled.Asked if she saw a possibility of “ditch the sweater” as a protest in her school, she said that if we try to do any such thing, it would mean “direct suspension”.“Too far fetched,” said Varalika Aditya Singh, however, adding that she agreed with the concept “of sort of abstinence from every possible aspect where patriarchy does play a huge role”.“But in India I still believe we only do things to please, a lot under pressure to be accepted, validated and to be looked at a certain way. Women might choose to live this way but secretly,” she said.“In India it's mostly vocal, nothing in action,” Neeraja Nath, who works as a news writer said.Given the fact that marriage is something so ingrained in Indian culture, when asked if it was a patriarchal institution, Singh “absolutely” agreed.However, she added that “marriage might not be entirely patriarchal but the conditioning has always been that.”“I cannot and also don't want to defy an entire institution because patriarchy has seeped everywhere. Marriage is just more convenient also because there's a lot of stigma attached if in the longer run the relationship doesn't work out,” she said.","In South Korea, a small but radical feminist movement emerged in the late 2010s that rejected not just misogyny, but the social institutions built around it. Called 4B — short for— the movement is where women opt out of four things entirely. 4B coalesced through accumulation of online hostility, public violence, and institutional indifference layering into something heavier than outrage.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127620543,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Buried Past

.

Walk down the narrow lanes of this small town — located about 45km southwest of Chandigarh — and you’d find it hard to believe that Chinese scholar Hiuen Tsang trod these very paths some 1,300 years ago. Or that north Indian ruler Prithviraj Chauhan had once passed this way at the head of his army.It’s as if history no longer felt welcome here and moved out, mournful and uncared for. But there was a time when history ebbed and flowed through its narrow lanes. Sirhind — or Sar-iHind, the crown of India — was, after all, the last major outpost before invaders reached the Yamuna. Temples of the Hindu Shahis — who made Sirhind their capital, with its grandeur said to be second only to Lahore’s — still stand south of Islamabad, the oldest surviving temples in Pakistan.But monuments and structures that are often eloquent narrators of past glories stand in Sirhind as mute spectators, listlessly dotting farmlands and alleyways. In many cases, they exist — plastered, painted over, forgotten — as bricks that were repurposed as construction material to build nameless walls of homes that have sprung up in recent decades.The town, which forms a twin city with the adjacent Fatehgarh Sahib, has not only shrunk in size and significance, it has also gone missing from Punjab’s mindscape and its cultural discourse.It is where Humayun defeated the Suris to re-establish Mughal rule and where Guru Gobind Singh’s sons were so cruelly bricked up alive. Sirhind is said by some to go back to the time of the Mahabharata, a melting pot of lore and legend. But, then, how did history itself become a victim in historic Sirhind?Dr Daljit Singh, professor of history at Punjabi University, Patiala, toldthat Sirhind is a treasure trove for archaeologists, but it hasn’t got its due. Encroachments are gobbling up what should be protected spaces. The sense one gets on talking to locals is that every brick and old structure here can tell its own history. The only tough part is to actually find and identify them for what they really are.There is little evidence of any sustained effort by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to explore the historical importance of the area. Despite its rich past as a major provincial centre, there has not been a survey in years to identify historical remains that may lie buried beneath the ground.Some sites, like Gurudwara Shri Fatehgarh Sahib, Rauza Sharif Shrine and a Jain Mandir, are well maintained. But many historical places like Jahazi Haveli of Diwan Todar Mal — not to be confused with Raja Todar Mal of Akbar’s Navratna fame — Aam Khas Bagh and Sadna Kasai Masjid have remained neglected for long. Areas like Harbanspura, Mahadian, Bara and Talanian, where one would stumble on relics three decades ago, are yet to be explored. Buildings and monuments lie crumbling in wheat fields.In the 19th century, French traveller V Jacquemont had described Sirhind as “the biggest ruins in India after Delhi”. Yet today, few ever talk of it. As if it had fallen off the map. There is no trace of the Hindu Shahis in any museum in the country.Elderly residents of Sirhind recall instances of when tilling of the land would turn up artefacts. “Every few days, we would hear someone’s plough had dug up something from history. Bricks were very common to find. Even now such articles turn up. The famous Laalan Wala Bazar near Talanian village is all farmland now,” said 77-yearold Sukhdev Singh. “There were at least four tombs in the area, but we know of two, the Ustad and Shagird tombs. We don’t know what happened to the other two,” he added.Shamsher Singh, 75, of Talanian village, said silver coins, Sirhind bricks and artefacts of various shapes were regularly found near tombs and in the fields. “There was a raised structure near the village but it gradually disappeared as people levelled it up. Now, farming is going on in the same ground. Govt should have protected these historical sites,” he said.At Mahadiyan, famed for how often buried history was dug up during farming, former sarpanch Balwant Singh, 75, said one of the mausoleums he saw as a child has vanished and houses have come up there. “Some 30-35 years ago, ‘Tailay’, which was a sort of currency, would be found in the fields every now and then. Who knows what else would have been found had there been a proper dig?” Khalifa Syed Muhammad Sadiq Raza, who manages affairs at the mausoleum (dargah) of the 17th-century Sufi saint Shaikh Ahmad Faruqi Sirhindi (Mujaddid Alf Sani), said Sirhind was an important province for the Mughals as it lay midway between Delhi and Lahore.Punjab Shahi Imam, Maulana Usman Ludhianvi, said, “Sirhind is an important historical area and needs to be explored in the historical context”.Anecdotes and tales of Sirhind’s buried and forgotten history still keep coming up in conversations. But there are not many who want the past to be dug up. Their fear is that history unearthed would before long get overrun by the present. And will Sirhind then remain the land of fables and myth? Asked about excavations in Sirhind, Sanjeev Kumar Tewari, director-tourism, culture and archaeology, said none has been carried out in the recent past. ASI is carrying out excavations at Sanghol in Fatehgarh Sahib and some other places nearby, he said.“As of now, Jahazi Haveli is being restored. Around 80% of the work has been completed,” he said. Asked why other monuments are in such a state of disrepair, he said minor restoration work was done at the Ustad and Shagird tombs and at the Tomb of Bibi Subhan. “We are getting estimates drawn up for restoration of other monuments. Also, the property towards the rear of Aam Khas Bagh is being given out for commercial usage in PPP mode,” he said.Deputy commissioner Sona Thind acknowledged that Aam Khas Bagh and other tombs needed maintenance and said she has written about it to the tourism and cultural affairs department.","There is little evidence of any sustained effort by Archaeological Survey of India to explore the historical importance of the area.

Patrick Mahomes battles quiet rehab as Brittany Mahomes creates stability for their children,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/patrick-mahomes-battles-quiet-rehab-as-brittany-mahomes-creates-stability-for-their-children/articleshow/127473169.cms,"Patrick Mahomes is enduring a demanding offseason as he recovers from an ACL and LCL tear, limiting his usual family routine. While he focuses on rehabilitation and a possible Week 1 return, Brittany Mahomes is creating joyful moments for their children, helping maintain normalcy as the Chiefs star patiently works through recovery.

Brittany Mahomes steps forward as Patrick Mahomes grinds through rehab

Patrick Mahomes is used to controlling chaos on the field. This offseason, control is not an option. The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback is rehabbing a serious knee injury in near silence, learning patience while his body resets and his routine disappears. Training days have turned into long recovery sessions, and the familiar rhythm of movement, travel, and playtime now looks very different.At home, life keeps moving. Brittany Mahomes has taken on the emotional heavy lifting, making sure Sterling, Bronze, and Golden Raye still experience joy while their father watches more than he participates. The family recently stepped out together, not for football, but for normalcy. It was a small escape, yet a telling one, as Mahomes continues one of the toughest offseasons of his career.The injury changed everything. Patrick Mahomes tore his ACL and LCL late in the season after taking a hit while extending a play against the Chargers. Surgery followed, along with a long recovery timeline that demands restraint, something not often associated with his improvisational style.Brittany Mahomes documented a family trip to Disney On Ice, sharing moments of Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, and Donald Duck skating as the family briefly stepped away from their Missouri home.She described the day simply as the “best time today,” a phrase that reflected effort, not ease.Behind the scenes, Mahomes is already focused on returning. His goals remain clear, even as medical caution shapes every step. “I want to be ready for Week 1,” Mahomes said. “The doctors said I could. But I can't predict what will happen throughout the process. That's the goal to play Week 1 and have no restrictions.“You want to be out there healthy and give us the best chance to win. I hope to do some things in OTAs and training camp and be able to do things there.”Outside voices have urged patience. Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio has noted how late-season ACL injuries complicate timelines, especially for quarterbacks who rely on movement. Examples like Adrian Peterson offer hope, but Mahomes faces multiple ligament repairs in a modern recovery environment built around caution.For now, the Chiefs star heals quietly. Brittany keeps life bright. Together, they move forward one careful step at a time.","Patrick Mahomes tore his ACL and LCL late in the season.

Why Kyle Tucker Would Have Fit Toronto Blue Jays’ Long-Term Plan

Toronto Blue Jays (Image Source - Getty Images)

What Each Side Would Have Gained

The Risks That Would Have Come With It

If Kyle Tucker had reached the open market instead of signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers in January 2026, the Toronto Blue Jays would likely have emerged as one of the most aggressive teams in pursuit.Tucker is one of the rare players who checks every box. He brings power without selling out his approach, plays strong defense in the outfield, and is still firmly in his prime. Players like that almost never become available, which is why his hypothetical free agency would have reshaped conversations across the league. Toronto, facing growing pressure after several playoff appearances that failed to produce a deep run, would have been well positioned to act.The Blue Jays have hovered on the edge of true contention for years. They’ve had talent, depth, and pitching, but the lineup has often lacked a single, game-altering presence who changes how opponents plan an entire series. Tucker fits that role cleanly. He’s not just another bat in the order; he’s the type of hitter who forces pitchers to work differently and reshapes how defenses align.Timing would have mattered as much as talent. With the Houston Astros managing payroll constraints and Tucker nearing the most expensive years of his career, the idea of him becoming available had already loosened the market.For Toronto, this would not have been about adding depth or chasing marginal gains. It would have been a direct attempt to raise the team’s ceiling and move from contender to legitimate title threat.Any discussion around Kyle Tucker begins with contract reality. Industry expectations suggest his next deal could comfortably exceed $400 million, a figure that would place him among baseball’s highest-paid players. For Houston, moving him before that point would have meant gaining young, controllable talent while avoiding a massive long-term obligation.Toronto, meanwhile, would have seen a rare opening. The organization has both the prospect depth and the competitive urgency to justify a major swing. While any deal would have required real sacrifice, either top prospects or players ready for everyday roles, the payoff would have been immediate. This would have been the type of move that defines an era rather than supplements it.From Toronto Blue Jays’ point of view, adding Kyle Tucker would have solved multiple problems at once. He offers consistent middle-of-the-order production, with a track record of strong averages, power, and run creation. That kind of reliability has been uneven in recent Blue Jays lineups, especially when games tighten late in the season.There’s also the matter of presence. Tucker carries star weight. His arrival would have sent a clear message to both the clubhouse and the fanbase that the front office was willing to push beyond comfort to chase a championship.For Tucker, Toronto would have represented a chance to step into a major market with a competitive roster already in place. The environment would have supported both performance and profile, while positioning him for the type of long-term contract his production suggests is coming.The cost would not have been light. Toronto would have needed to part with valuable future assets, potentially thinning out depth that matters over a long season. There’s also the reality of Tucker’s recent injury history, including time missed in 2024, which adds uncertainty to any long-term commitment.For Houston, moving on from a cornerstone player would have meant an immediate hit to star power and lineup balance. The success of such a move would hinge entirely on how quickly and effectively the return pieces developed.Tucker himself would have faced the pressure that comes with a new league, a demanding market, and heightened expectations. Toronto is not a quiet place to struggle, especially for a player brought in to change outcomes.Had Tucker not already committed to the Dodgers, Toronto would have been one of the clearest teams ready to move first and spend big. The fit made sense in terms of timing, roster construction, and competitive goals. While the risks would have been real on every side, so would the upside.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Mets exploring blockbuster move for $116.5 million Arizona Diamondbacks star following Jeff McNeil exit Deals like this don’t just alter a single roster. They change how a team is viewed for years.

“Coming home” hits differently as Mike McCarthy’s daughter Alex reacts to his emotional Steelers introduction



Alex Noel McCarthy (Alex Noel McCarthy/Instagram)

Mike McCarthy is back where it all began. The Pittsburgh native has officially taken the helm as head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers, marking a full-circle moment in his career. “This city, this franchise, this fan base means the world to me because Pittsburgh is my world and it's just awesome to be back here,” McCarthy said, visibly emotional during his first press conference at Acrisure Stadium. With his family by his side, he promised a renewed drive for Super Bowl glory.For McCarthy, this isn’t just a coaching job-- it’s personal. Born and raised in the blue-collar Greenfield neighborhood, he grew up watching the Steelers dominate the 1970s, winning four Super Bowls. His father’s legacy as a police officer, firefighter, and bar owner instilled in him a love for community and grit. “I want to make sure when we do get that seventh trophy in the case, we'll start that victory parade at 1137 Greenfield Ave. ,” he shared, referencing his childhood home. His connection to Pittsburgh goes beyond football; it’s about pride, roots, and unfinished business.McCarthy becomes only the fourth Steelers head coach since 1969, following Chuck Noll, Bill Cowher, and Mike Tomlin.That history alone explains the weight of the job. Tomlin leaves behind 19 seasons without a losing record and a Super Bowl title, setting a standard few franchises can match.McCarthy’s resume shows he understands expectations. Across stops in Green Bay and Dallas, he built a 174-112-2 regular season record with 11 postseason wins. His Super Bowl victory came against the Steelers in 2011, a twist of fate that now adds irony to his return.The emotional impact of the hire reached his family too. His oldest daughter, Alex Noel McCarthy, shared moments from the press conference online, including a photo of her father’s name lighting up the stadium screen. She also reposted a fan video defending the hire, adding a simple message: “Let’s. Go.”Adding another twist of irony, McCarthy expressed hope to reunite with quarterback Aaron Rodgers in a Steelers uniform next season. It’s a poetic nod to the past, considering Rodgers led Green Bay to victory against McCarthy’s Packers in the 2011 Super Bowl. Beyond stats and history, McCarthy’s return embodies heart, legacy, and a promise to Pittsburgh: more championships, more pride, and a coach who calls this city home.","Mike McCarthy has officially taken the helm as head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers. “Pittsburgh is my world and it's just awesome to be back here,” McCarthy said, visibly emotional during his first press conference at Acrisure Stadium.

Bill Belichick Hall of Fame snub explained



Bill Belichick Hall of Fame discussions rarely carry suspense. This time, they did. The football world woke up to a shock as the most decorated head coach of the Super Bowl era failed to clear the final step into Canton on his first try. For a figure synonymous with winning, preparation, and longevity, the delay landed like a thunderclap across the NFL landscape.The decision stunned fans, former players, and executives alike. Belichick’s résumé has long been treated as untouchable. Yet when the Pro Football Hall of Fame votes were counted, history paused instead of marching forward. The result immediately ignited debate about legacy, standards, and whether greatness can ever be separated from controversy.According to ESPN’s Seth Wickersham and Don Van Natta Jr., the six-time Super Bowl champion head coach has not been elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame on his first ballot.“In voting earlier this month, Belichick fell short of the 40 out of 50 votes needed for induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame during his first year of eligibility,” the duo wrote for ESPN.com on Tuesday. “Belichick received a call from a Hall representative last Friday afternoon with the news that he won't be inducted into the Hall in Canton, Ohio, this summer.”“Six Super Bowls isn't enough?” Belichick reportedly asked an associate, per Wickersham and Van Natta Jr.—who added that he also asked another, ""What does a guy have to do?”While Belichick stands among the greatest coaches the NFL has ever seen, voters reportedly struggled to separate his success from past controversies. Multiple sources confirmed that Spygate and Deflategate surfaced during deliberations, reopening old wounds tied to the Patriots dynasty.“The only explanation [for the outcome] was the cheating stuff, ”a veteran Hall of Fame voter told ESPN. “It really bothered some of the guys.”Belichick, 73, coached New England from 2000 to 2023 and compiled a staggering 333-178 overall record, including postseason play. His teams captured 17 AFC East titles, nine conference championships, and six Super Bowls, numbers that usually guarantee instant enshrinement.Yet one voter reportedly argued for patience. “A voter who spoke on condition of anonymity said that Polian… told some voters he believed Belichick should 'wait a year' before induction as penance for Spygate, the 2007 cheating scandal that cost the team a first-round draft pick.”Reaction across the league was swift. Patrick Mahomes summed up the disbelief felt by many.""Insane… don't even understand how this could be possible,"" Mahomes wrote on social media.Belichick will now wait until the 2027 vote, a delay that adds an unexpected chapter to a career defined by control and certainty.","Bill Belichick fell short of the 40 out of 50 votes needed for induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame during his first year of eligibility.

Cardi briefly acknowledged the chant as the moment went viral. The incident split fan opinion and added fresh controversy to New England’s Super Bowl buildup.

Patriots celebration turns tense as fans target Cardi B with explicit chants

The celebration on the field should have been simple. Confetti. Cameras. A ticket to the Super Bowl. Instead, the moment turned loud and uncomfortable when Cardi B joined Stefon Diggs after the New England Patriots clinched the AFC Championship. What followed was not scripted and not ignored. Fans near the tunnel began chanting an explicit insult aimed at her estranged husband, dragging personal history into a football night meant for triumph.Cardi did not retreat. She raised her fist, acknowledging the noise as Diggs stood beside her. The clip spread fast, cutting across sports and pop culture timelines. For some fans, it felt like harmless chaos. For others, it crossed a line and reflected poorly on the franchise. The scene added another layer to a postseason already filled with drama, scrutiny, and off field tension.The video sparked immediate debate online. One commenter brushed it off, writing, “They so corny for that. Them folks happy and wasn’t even thinking bout cuzz.” Another fan took a harsher view, saying, “I love the patriots that being said I’ve NEVER been more disgusted in my life with our organization.” The divide showed how quickly joy can turn into discomfort when personal narratives take center stage.Before her relationship with Diggs, Cardi B was married to Offset from 2017 to 2023. They share three children. Since moving on, Cardi and Stefon Diggs have welcomed a child together, deepening public attention on their relationship.That attention now follows Diggs into a critical stretch. The Patriots will face the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl LX, a rematch loaded with history. Yet Diggs’ focus may be split. Days after the game, he is scheduled for an arraignment related to felony strangulation and misdemeanor assault charges. He has denied the allegations.Cardi previously defended him with a post later removed, stating, “Not once has that woman said anything to me about being touched.. NOT ONCE!!”As the Super Bowl nears, the Patriots stand at the center of celebration and controversy. The noise is only getting louder.","Patriots celebration turns tense as fans target Cardi B with explicit chants. Fans chanted an explicit insult aimed at her estranged husband, Offset.

Agent completes historic 24-hour Arctic survival challenge





Twitch streamer ‘Agent’ achieved a historic milestone by finishing a full day of streaming from the Arctic region during his 24-hour broadcast. The North Pole served as the location for the challenge, which experienced temperatures that reached below -45°F (-42°C). The first streamer to survive extreme conditions for an entire day became Agent. He ended his stream on January 27, 2026. He fought through freezing winds while his eyelashes and beard developed ice accumulation, and he faced extended periods of darkness and complete physical fatigue. The achievement quickly gained attention online, with fans praising his determination and endurance.This extreme stunt demonstrates the evolution of live streaming over time. What began as bedroom gaming has evolved into real-life survival content. Agent made the decision to push himself more than ever after being inspired by well-known streams from producers like Kai Cenat and IShowSpeed. His Arctic stream focused on mental toughness, preparation, and strategy in addition to entertainment. Watchers watched the entire trip in real time, aware that even one mistake could be fatal in such a hostile setting.Agent’s success came after an earlier failure. In December 2025, he attempted the same challenge but had to quit after about 10 hours. At that time, temperatures ranged between -25°F and -40°F. Agent later admitted that he was not fully prepared for the cold or the isolation. He also shared concerns about safety after stream snipers reportedly managed to track him down, which added to the risk of staying overnight in the wilderness.Agent persisted in spite of the setback. Rather, he watched videos, studied survival skills, and upgraded his gear for weeks. Even though it was much colder when he returned to the Arctic a month later, his preparation paid off. Agent maintained composure, controlled his energy, and adhered to a well-defined plan throughout the last stream. He celebrated live after finishing the full 24 hours and thanked his audience for their support, claiming that hard work and learning from past mistakes were the keys to his success.The agent is not giving up on the Arctic. His next big challenge, which is to survive in the Amazon jungle for a full day, has already been made public. The challenge will be very different but equally dangerous due to the heat, heavy rain, and dangerous wildlife. Agent's Arctic survival stream sets a new benchmark and demonstrates the extent to which creators are prepared to go in order to produce memorable moments, as streamers continue to raise the bar for live content.","Twitch streamer ‘Agent’ achieved a historic milestone by finishing a full day of streaming from the Arctic region.

Edmonton Oilers ’ blue line dominance turns the tide against Anaheim Ducks



NHL Highlights | Ducks vs. Oilers - January 26, 2026

Mattias Ekholm gave Edmonton fans something to cheer about. In his 938th NHL game, the veteran defenseman scored his first career hat trick, helping the Oilers beat the Anaheim Ducks 7-4. It wasn’t just about the goals; his performance highlighted the strength and depth of Edmonton’s defense in a big way.Ekholm’s hat trick came after a long goal drought this season, highlighting persistence and timing. He wasn’t just scoring; he was making history. The Oilers became the first team in NHL history to have defensemen score hat tricks in consecutive games, with Evan Bouchard accomplishing the feat just two nights earlier. It was a defensive showcase turned offensive explosion.The night truly belonged to Edmonton’s blue line. Ekholm opened the second-period surge with a give-and-go finish, and Darnell Nurse quickly followed to extend the lead. Within minutes, the Oilers had turned a tight game into a commanding advantage, fueled by defensemen breaking plays out of their zone, joining the rush, and creating scoring opportunities that kept Anaheim constantly on their heels. Connor McDavid and Zach Hyman each scored a goal and added an assist, while Leon Draisaitl set up four more, showing how well the Oilers’ offense works together. Tristan Jarry made 36 saves, keeping Edmonton in control and giving the team the confidence to keep going. The team’s strong chemistry and balanced attack made it hard for Anaheim to find any momentum.For the Ducks, Mikael Granlund scored a power-play hat trick, with Beckett Sennecke assisting twice, keeping Anaheim in the fight. Still, Edmonton’s mix of aggressive defense and opportunistic offense was too strong. Empty-net goals from McDavid and Ekholm wrapped up the 7-4 win, leaving a big mark on the season and reinforcing the Oilers as a threat from every part of the ice.Coach Kris Knoblauch praised Ekholm’s night, noting how unusual it is for a defenseman to score three goals in a single game. The performance highlighted Ekholm’s persistence and also showed just how deep and versatile Edmonton’s squad has become, able to turn defensive play into scoring chances at any moment.","Mattias Ekholm scored his first career hat trick, helping the Edmonton Oilers beat the Anaheim Ducks 7-4.

Understanding the basic rules and how the Super Bowl game flows

Super Bowl LX is set to bring together the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks on February 8, 2026, and millions of viewers will be tuning in, whether they are lifelong fans or watching their first NFL game. American football can feel confusing at first, especially during an event this big, but understanding a few core rules makes the experience far more enjoyable.From how teams move the ball to how points are scored, the Super Bowl follows the same structure as any regular NFL game. Addititonally a slew of electrifying performances from Green Day, Charlie Puth, and Bad Bunny are also attractions that will ensure that the ceremony is grand and full of spectacle.Each team has 11 players on the field at a time, with one side playing offense and the other defense. The goal is to score more points than your opponent by moving the ball down the field and into the end zone. Teams can advance the ball by running it or throwing it forward. The offense is led by the quarterback, who touches the ball on almost every play.The offensive team is given four chances, known as downs, to move the ball at least 10 yards.If they succeed, they earn a fresh set of four downs. If they fail, the other team takes over possession. A touchdown is worth six points and occurs when the ball crosses into the end zone.After a touchdown, teams usually kick an extra point to get an additional score, or they can aim for a two-point conversion by running or passing the ball into the end zone again. A field goal, which is often used when a team stalls near scoring range, is worth three points. A safety gives the defense two points if they tackle an offensive player in their own end zone.Every game begins with a kickoff, which also happens after halftime and after each scoring play. If an offense cannot gain enough yards, it may punt the ball to push the opposing team farther back. Defensive measures include interceptions, which are when a defender catches a pass meant for the offense and immediately becomes the attacking team.The Super Bowl is played over four quarters, each for 15 minutes. If the score is tied at the end of regulation, overtime begins with a coin toss. The winner of the toss can choose to either receive the ball or kick it away. Super Bowl LX will air live on NBC, featuring Mike Tirico, Cris Collinsworth, and Melissa Stark. Fans without cable can stream the game and halftime show on Peacock, Fubo, Hulu + Live TV, YouTube TV, and NFL+.","Super Bowl LX is set to bring together the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks on February 8, 2026.

What happened in Nashville?

When family came before football

Dallas Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer’s family faced a frightening situation this week after a severe ice storm hit Nashville, forcing his wife Gemmi to flee their home and seek safety in a hotel.As dangerous weather swept through the city, Gemmi took to social media to share just how serious the situation had become. In a short video posted on her Instagram story, she showed icy roads and wrote that getting out of their neighborhood was “scary,” before adding that the family was grateful to be safe and warm.The storm struck quickly, with temperatures dropping well below freezing and snow and ice covering large parts of the city. According to Gemmi’s posts, nearly 200,000 homes across Nashville were left without electricity as the weather worsened.“Scary stuff trying to get out of our neighborhood,” she wrote, showing the treacherous conditions outside their home. In another post, she shared that power outages were widespread and that the storm was something the city had not seen in “generations.”Eventually, the Schottenheimers made it safely to a nearby hotel, where Gemmi posted a final photo of their two dogs sitting calmly on a bed.“Grateful for hotel life,” she wrote, offering a small moment of relief after a tense few hours.While Brian Schottenheimer is best known for his demanding role as the Cowboys’ head coach, the incident highlighted how quickly football takes a back seat when family safety is at stake.Schottenheimer has often spoken about his strong values, famously getting a tattoo that reads “faith, family, football” when he joined Dallas as offensive coordinator in 2023. The words reflect the order of priorities in his life, and this week’s storm brought that message into sharp focus.The coach and his wife weren't the only ones who had a hard time. City officials said that the roads were unsafe, schools were closed, and there was a lot of disturbance while emergency services attempted to restore power and clean the roadways.The ice storm left much of Nashville at a standstill, with authorities advising residents to remain indoors and avoid travel unless absolutely necessary. Temperatures were expected to remain low for several days, raising concerns about continued power outages and frozen pipes.Brian Schottenheimer is still working on changing the Cowboys' coaching staff and getting ready for the new NFL season. His family's close call is a reminder that even in the world of professional sports, real-life catastrophes may happen without warning.","Dallas Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer's family was forced to flee their home after a severe ice storm hit Nashville.

Skal Labissiere gets a short-term chance with the Washington Wizards ahead of the trade deadline

Strong G League run puts Skal Labissiere in line for a bigger role with the Washington Wizards

According to Shams Charania of ESPN, Skal Labissiere signed a 10-day deal with the Washington Wizards on Tuesday. Since the Atlanta Hawks acquired Trae Young in exchange for C.J. McCollum and Corey Kispert, Washington has had a roster spot available. With Nikola Vukcevic and Marvin Bagley III sidelined due to injuries, the Wizards are lacking in frontcourt.Amidst this, Charania reported that Labissiere signed the contract to join Brian Keefe's team. The 29-year-old is a former Kentucky first-round selection. Additionally, the Capital City Go-Go, the Wizards' G League affiliate, has called him up. Furthermore, Labissiere played in 36 games during his one year at UK, averaging 15.8 minutes per game.Labissiere’s 10-day contract will expire on Thursday, February 5, if it is formalized today, but the Wizards may terminate it early if they need the roster slot to make a trade-deadline move. Announcing the same, Charania wrote on X:“The Washington Wizards are signing center Skal Labissiere to a 10-day contract out of their Capital City affiliate, agent Daniel Hazan tells ESPN. Labissiere enters a sixth NBA season after being a first-round pick in 2016. He has shot 55% from field and 44% from 3 in G League…”In 2016, the Phoenix Suns selected Labissiere with the 28th overall pick.The Sacramento Kings later acquired the former five-star recruit. He played for the Kings for the first three seasons of his NBA career. Prior to his 2018–2019 move to the Portland Trail Blazers, he maintained a consistent role.Labissiere averaged 7.2 points and 4.5 rebounds in 17.5 minutes per night while playing in 148 regular season games for Sacramento and Portland. Washington has a $131,970 cap charge, but Labissiere will make $153,330 on his 10-day contract.The 6'10"" player could play for the Wizards for up to six games before his contract expires if he signs before Tuesday's game against Portland. Before getting another chance with the Kings last season, the former Kentucky great played in Puerto Rico and the G League for a number of years.This fall, Labissiere made a comeback to the G League and has been performing admirably for the Capital City Go-Go, a Washington affiliate. With a strong shooting line, he has averaged 19.2 points, 7.7 rebounds, 2.5 blocks, and 2.1 assists in 31.0 minutes per game over 26 games.The 29-year-old has been with the Wizards' G League club for the whole 2025-26 season after being cut by Washington during the preseason. In 30.9 minutes per game, Labissiere has averaged 19.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, 2.3 blocks, 2.3 three-pointers, 2.0 assists, and 0.7 steals. Additionally, in 26 games, he has shot 55.4 percent from the field and 44.1 percent from beyond the arc.While Marvin Bagley (back) and Tristan Vukcevic (hamstring) are both prone to injuries, Labissiere may be a part of the rotation in the near future as starting center Alex Sarr's primary backup.",Skal Labissiere signed a 10-day deal with the Washington Wizards on Tuesday.

William Nylander's NHL fine reflects tough league policy on player conduct



Toronto Maple Leafs star forward William Nylander has made headlines for all the wrong reasons after the NHL fined him $5,000 for an obscene gesture he made on live television during a recent regular-season game in Toronto. The controversy, sparked by an obscene gesture on live television during Game No. 819 on Sunday, January 25, quickly went viral on social media.The NHL fined William Nylander on Monday, citing that the player conduct policy is in effect at all times during an NHL game, both on and off the ice. The incident occurred when William Nylander, who was not playing due to injury, made the gesture from the press box during the Leafs’ game against the Colorado Avalanche.William Nylander made the obscene gesture at a television camera operator. In contrast, the broadcast camera was focused on him and the rest of the Maple Leafs players in the press box. The gesture was caught live on television during the broadcast of the game.NHL Senior Vice President of Player Safety George Parros addressed the situation in a formal statement, “Nylander directed an inappropriate gesture at a television camera operator while the camera was directed at Mr.Nylander and his teammates in the press box. The gesture was shown live on-air during the game broadcast,"" he said. “This serves as a reminder that the code of conduct governing players extends throughout the arena at NHL games and in public game situations. ”Nylander, a Swedish international and one of the most productive forwards for the Toronto team this year, has since apologized for the incident on his Instagram story. In his apology, he stated that he regretted the incident, which he claimed was a momentary lapse of judgment due to frustration, but that he still appreciates the support of Leafs fans and hopes to return to the ice soon.Fans on X were very critical of Nylander’s actions, labeling the gesture as unprofessional considering his pay and status as a franchise player. Several fans drew parallels between this incident and other NHL incidents in the past, while others felt that the incident represented a larger issue with the Maple Leafs’ season.Although the fine has officially put the incident to rest from the league’s point of view, it seems that the conversation about player conduct, media attention, and fan expectations in the most intensely watched hockey market in the world is far from over.","The NHL fined William Nylander $5,000 for an obscene gesture he made on live television during a recent regular-season game in Toronto.

Dez Bryant says Davante Adams’ reaction shows pain and hard work behind those tears

Davante Adams, wide receiver for the Los Angeles Rams, stood before reporters with tears in his eyes after his team lost 31-27 to the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship Game on Sunday, January 25, 2026 at Lumen Field in Seattle, Washington. This loss ended the Rams’ season and kept Adams from reaching his first Super Bowl, even after a long and great NFL career.Adams has now lost five NFC title games, four with the Green Bay Packers and once with the Rams and the pain of falling short once again was clear on his face and in his voice. He said the feeling was hard to put into words and that it was “heartbreak” to see his journey end without a chance to play in the biggest game of the season. His honest emotion struck a chord with many fans and former players across the league.Former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant reacted to Adams’ emotional postgame video on Monday, January 26, 2026, and he spoke in simple, real-talk about what Adams is feeling.Bryant wrote on X that most people don’t understand how much work and belief it takes to chase a Super Bowl.Bryant wrote that from the first day a player dreams of the Super Bowl as a child, to every practice and game, there is hard work and sacrifice behind every moment.He said that Adams had put in countless hours and had to stay confident through the whole season only to have a short chance, sometimes just 17 games to reach this goal.Bryant continued, saying that playing in a Super Bowl means outplaying the best teams and that winning one is a badge of honor no matter who you are.He added, “It’s a lot of pain and sacrifice behind those tears! Adams, first ballot. It’s more to his legacy, and I respect it!” This was Bryant showing support and respect for what Adams has done over his long career.After the Rams’ loss in the NFC title game, Adams spoke to reporters and explained his feelings. He said the moment was tough and that it was hard to think about the future right away.Adams said he was proud of his teammates and how they fought all season, but that it still “sucks” to come up short.In that January 25 game, quarterback Matthew Stafford threw for 374 yards and three touchdowns, and Adams caught four passes for 89 yards and a touchdown. But the Seahawks’ defense made key plays late to keep the Rams out of the Super Bowl.Adams’ career has been full of big moments, six Pro Bowl appearances, multiple All-Pro honors, and many NFL records but a Super Bowl trip still has not come. His emotional reaction and Bryant’s support show just how much this loss means to him.","Davante Adams, wide receiver for the Los Angeles Rams, stood before reporters with tears in his eyes after his team lost 31-27 to the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship Game on Sunday, January 25, 2026.

What happened between Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union in 2013?



Dwyane Wade, the NBA legend, and his wife, popular actress Gabrielle Union , try to live pretty private lives with their only daughter, Kaavia Wade.While the high profile couple is pretty strict about maintaining their privacy, Gabrielle Union has been pretty open about how she felt when she learnt that Dwyane Wade had a child with a friend while the two had split for a while in 2013.A few years ago, in 2021, Dwyane Wade’s wife, Gabrielle Union, wrote in TIME about the things she felt as she learnt about it.Gabrielle Union wrote, ""It should go without saying that we were not in a good place at the time that child was conceived…”The popular actress added, “But we were doing much better when he finally told me about the pregnancy.

What will decide the game

Theare in Philadelphia on Tuesday night for an Eastern Conference game that looks very different depending on who is able to play. Milwaukee is already confirmed to be without Giannis Antetokounmpo, while the 76ers are still deciding on the availability of Joel Embiid and Paul George.Both teams are dealing with injuries that affect how they play on both ends of the floor. With key starters missing or limited, this game could come down to depth, shooting, and who controls the paint.Milwaukee Bucks will be without several rotation players, led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, who remains sidelined with a right calf strain.Without Giannis, the Bucks lose their main scoring option and their best defender. Damian Lillard will handle most of the offense, while Brook Lopez and Andre Drummond will be asked to protect the rim and rebound. Milwaukee’s ability to score inside is limited without Giannis, making outside shooting more important.Philadelphia 76ers enter the night with uncertainty around its top players.Embiid has been managed carefully due to his knee. If he does not play, Andre Drummond or Adem Bona would handle most of the minutes at center.Paul George is dealing with knee soreness and remains day to day. Quentin Grimes’ status matters for perimeter defense and spacing. Tyrese Maxey and Kelly Oubre Jr. would take on more scoring responsibility if either star sits.Over the last three seasons, including 2025-26, the teams have met nine times. Milwaukee holds a 7-2 record in those games. Most matchups have been physical and close, with home court often playing a role. Philadelphia has been harder to beat when Embiid is available.Philadelphia rebounds better and shoots free throws more reliably. Milwaukee shoots better from the field and from three.The result depends on availability. If Embiid plays, Philadelphia controls the paint and forces Milwaukee to defend without fouling. If he sits, the Bucks gain more room to attack inside. Outside shooting and turnovers are likely to decide the outcome late.This game is less about matchups on paper and more about who is healthy enough to execute.","Milwaukee Bucks host Philadelphia 76ers (January 27, 2026) Bucks will be without several rotation players, led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, who remains sidelined with a right calf strain. 76ers are still deciding on the availability of Joel Embiid and Paul George.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127650271,imgsize-89678,width-400,resizemode-4/76ers-vs-bucks.jpg"

Carlos Alcaraz praises father and team after win over Alex de Minaur

Carlos Alcaraz stood tall at Melbourne Park with a smile and a full heart. The world No. 1 reached his first-ever Australian Open semi-final after a strong win over Alex de Minaur. He won the match 7-5, 6-2, 6-1 and ticked off a big dream in his young career. But this win was not just about tennis. It was also about family.Right after the match, Carlos Alcaraz spoke about his father and how much this moment meant to both of them. He shared how having his family and team close makes him feel calm and happy. That support, he said, helps him play better tennis. With the semi-final now set, Alcaraz is chasing another big step at the Australian Open, but he is doing it with his people by his side.After beating Alex de Minaur, Carlos Alcaraz spoke on court with Jim Courier. He was asked about having his father and brother with him in Australia. Alcaraz answered with honesty and joy.“It’s great for me,” Carlos Alcaraz said. “Sometimes we make jokes in the locker room. Other players tell me, ‘You can’t play a football match with your team.’ It’s funny, but I need it. I need my team and my people around me.”He explained how his team helps him off the court. “They are the reason I play such great tennis because off the court they make me feel great.They make me feel like I’m at home every single time,” he said.Alcaraz then spoke about his father in an emotional moment. “Having my brother and my dad here, part of my family, my uncle as well, it’s been great,” he said. “Living these kinds of things, it was my dad’s dream when he was playing tennis. I’m really proud to see him living his dream with me.”Carlos Alcaraz has been in strong form all tournament. Even after ending his long partnership with coach Juan Carlos Ferrero in the off-season, his support system stayed strong. Samuel Lopez is now his head coach, while his father and brother Alvaro are also with him in Melbourne.Next, Alcaraz will face Alexander Zverev in the semi-final. Zverev beat him at this venue two years ago. Alcaraz knows the challenge ahead.“I have to increase my level,” Carlos Alcaraz said. “He is playing great tennis, really solid and aggressive. We have to be ready, not only me, but my team as well.”Before the match, Carlos Alcaraz plans to rest. He may play a little golf, a habit he enjoys during Grand Slams. “I will try to make the most of my time in these two days,” he said.","Carlos Alcaraz reached his first-ever Australian Open semi-final.

Why does Sam Malinski’s extension matter for the Colorado Avalanche’s Stanley Cup push?



The Colorado Avalanche secured its blue-line defense by signing Sam Malinski to a contract extension. Malinski has steadily earned the trust of his coaches through his intelligent position play, his reliable performance, and his constant ability to play effectively on both offense and defense. The development of his skills has caused him to become more vital to the Colorado team's extensive defensive unit.He developed his skills step by step after remaining undrafted through his first two years until joining the Bismarck Bobcats in the NAHL and later playing three years at Cornell University before turning professional in 2023. His consistent performance and ability to play important minutes throughout games have established him as a reliable choice for teams competing in the Stanley Cup playoffs.The Colorado Avalanche announced Sam Malinski's four-year contract extension, which carries an annual value of $4.75 million.

Philadelphia 76ers vs Milwaukee Bucks Betting and on-court impact (January 27, 2026)

What to watch before tip-off

Theare waiting on a late call withahead of Tuesday night’s home game against the Milwaukee Bucks on. Embiid is listed as questionable because of left-knee injury management, and the team is not expected to decide until close to tip-off.This is a familiar situation for the Sixers. Embiid was given a planned rest day in Monday’s game against the Charlotte Hornets, the first half of a back-to-back. Philadelphia has followed this pattern for the last couple of seasons, often sitting him in one game to manage his knee and keep him available for bigger matchups.Joel Embiid’s status is the main question, but he is not the only Sixer on the report. Paul George is listed as probable with left-knee injury management, while Quentin Grimes is questionable because of a right ankle sprain.Milwaukee enters the game without Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is out with a calf injury. That absence makes Embiid’s availability even more important in shaping how this game plays out.If Joel Embiid does not play, Philadelphia 76ers will rely on Andre Drummond and Adem Bona at center. Tyrese Maxey would be asked to carry more of the scoring load. Drummond has helped in spot minutes this season, but he does not offer the same scoring options, defensive impact, or on-court attention that Embiid brings.If Embiid plays, expect him to be heavily involved. He is averaging about 25 points, 7 rebounds, and 3.6 assists per game this season. He has also logged several high-minute games in January, including a 45-minute overtime win against Houston. With Giannis out, Embiid would face a Bucks frontcourt without its usual interior presence.Philadelphia 76ers is currently favored by around 10.5 points at home, even with Embiid listed as questionable. That suggests sportsbooks expect him to play. If he is on the floor, the Sixers gain a clear edge in the half court and on the glass, while Milwaukee would be forced to adjust its defense around him.The final update is expected 90 to 120 minutes before the game, usually after shootaround. Embiid’s involvement in warm-ups will matter, and any late movement in the betting line could hint at his status.Also read: Milwaukee Bucks vs Philadelphia 76ers injury report: Who's playing, injured and questionable players, head-to-head records, team stats, and more (January 27, 2026) Embiid has not been ruled out, but nothing is confirmed.

Princess Santiago seeks DNA test as she names NBA icon Paul Pierce in paternity lawsuit

Paul Pierce faces fresh scrutiny after past DUI arrest details resurface

Event director Princess Santiago has filed a paternity lawsuit against retired NBA player Paul Pierce. Santiago filed the lawsuit on January 12, claiming that the 48-year-old former Brooklyn Nets and Boston Celtics player might be the biological father of her unborn child.According to the lawsuit, which TMZ Sports was able to obtain, Pierce is required to perform a DNA test in order to determine whether the basketball player is the child's biological father. The source has a copy of the lawsuit that Santiago, an event director in Los Angeles, filed.Following the filing of a paternity suit against NBA icon and Boston Celtics champion Paul Pierce, Princess Santiago's name started to make headlines. Santiago is requesting a DNA test to support her allegations that Pierce is the father of her unborn kid.On social media, Santiago has been sharing details about her pregnancy experience. The event manager posted a video of a pool inside her ""new home"" on Instagram in November 2025. The post’s caption read:""New Home making sure my son has the BEST. My blessing.""In another post, the soon-to-be mother stood under some Christmas decorations and the caption read:""My KING awaits. 'Children are a blessing and a gift from the Lord.'Psalm 127:3.""A third post read:""Last year was tough in so many ways. Grateful, thankful blessed God gave me a Son. My King Jeremiah 29:11.""Santiago stated in a statement to TMZ Sports that she has made ""multiple"" attempts to ""resolve"" the issue ""privately"" and that she does not wish to file for paternity papers. The renowned basketball player is once again in the public eye as a result of Santiago's allegation.Santiago said in a statement:""I filed for paternity papers after multiple attempts to resolve this privately.. Paul Pierce is the father of my son, King, and I am simply asking for a paternity test so the truth can be confirmed.""She added:""This isn’t about drama or attention — it’s about accountability and doing what’s right for my child.. Paul Pierce is the father of my son, King, and I am simply asking for a paternity test so the truth can be confirmed.""This isn’t the first time Pierce made the headlines. He was detained on suspicion of DUI in October 2024, and a few weeks later, authorities charged him after claiming his blood alcohol content was higher than permitted. At approximately 10:40 p.m., California Highway Patrol officers arrived at the scene where multiple vehicles collided.About an hour later, they noticed a Range Rover SUV stopped in the road south of the collision when they reopened the lanes. According to the press release, after observing Pierce dozing off at the wheel and ""noticing signs of alcohol impairment,"" officers opened a DUI investigation.The Los Angeles city attorney examined the misdemeanor accusation of driving while intoxicated that led to his arrest. Pierce, who entered a not guilty plea in the case, also seemed to refute claims that he had been drinking and driving at the time. He further stated on Threads that it was because he was ""old"" and ""tired"" and that he was sitting in traffic. After that, he didn’t say anything else regarding the same.","Princess Santiago seeks DNA test as she names NBA icon Paul Pierce in paternity lawsuit.

Stonehenge mystery solved? Study reveals how 25-tonne stones reached the site in southern England,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/stonehenge-mystery-solved-study-reveals-how-25-tonne-stones-reached-the-site-in-southern-england/articleshow/127561744.cms,"

Researchers uncovered the truth behind Stonehenge’s 25 tonne stones

Salisbury Plain shows no sign of ancient ice

Sarsens were local but still demanding

Bluestones point clearly to human effort

What the science changes and what it does not





Stonehenge sits on open chalk land in southern England, familiar and yet still awkwardly unexplained. For decades, one practical question has hovered over the site without settling. How did stones weighing many tonnes arrive here long before wheels, metal tools or written plans. A new study led by geologists at Curtin University shifts that discussion onto firmer ground. By analysing tiny mineral grains in local river sediments, the researchers tested whether glaciers once carried the stones south during the Ice Age. The results point away from ice and towards people. The landscape around Salisbury Plain shows no chemical trace of glacial delivery. Instead, the sediments reflect local recycling. This strengthens the view that Neolithic communities moved the stones themselves, deliberately, over long distances alone.The research “Detrital zircon–apatite fingerprinting challenges glacial transport of Stonehenge’s megaliths” focuses on detrital minerals, mainly zircon and apatite, found in streams that drain Salisbury Plain. These grains act as long-lived markers of where sediment has travelled. If glaciers had crossed the area, they would likely have left behind mineral signatures from Wales or northern Britain.That signal is absent. The zircon ages instead match rocks already known from southern England, suggesting the material has been recycled locally rather than dumped by ice. This matters because glacial transport has often been used as a convenient explanation. If ice sheets had carried the stones close to Stonehenge, human effort could be seen as minimal. The new data makes that position harder to hold.The study also reinforces a growing consensus among geomorphologists. There is little physical evidence that glaciers ever reached Salisbury Plain during the Pleistocene. No clear moraines, no consistent erratic trails, no buried till layers. While ice did extend far into Britain during earlier cold periods, its southern limits remain well north of the monument.Fine sediments can travel far beyond glaciers through meltwater. Large stones usually do not. The absence of glacial fingerprints in the surrounding sediment makes it unlikely that multi-tonne blocks arrived by chance.Not all of Stonehenge came from far away. The largest stones, the sarsens, were sourced from West Woods, about 25 kilometres to the north. That distance may sound modest, but the stones weigh around 25 tonnes each. Moving them would still have required planning, labour and time. The mineral analysis does not focus on sarsens directly, but it supports a broader pattern. Stonehenge was not constructed using random materials that happened to be located nearby. Its materials were selected and brought in with intent.The smaller bluestones tell a sharper story. Their geological fingerprints match outcrops in the Preseli Hills of west Wales, around 230 kilometres away. Some stones may have travelled by sea for part of that journey, others overland. Either way, the distances involved rule out casual movement. One stone stands out even more. The Altar Stone appears to come from the Orcadian Basin in northeast Scotland. If correct, that implies a journey of more than 700 kilometres. No known ice route explains this. Human organisation does.The study does not describe exactly how the stones were moved. Sledges, rollers and boats remain plausible tools. What it does change is the balance of probability. Stonehenge looks less like a monument finished by chance and more like one completed through sustained effort. There is no single moment where the mystery disappears. Instead, the space for easy answers narrows. The stones arrived because people brought them. That idea now sits more comfortably with the evidence, even if the work behind it remains only partly visible.","Geologists at Curtin University, Australia, have uncovered the truth behind Stonehenge’s 25 tonne stones.

Keeping the memory alive



It has been six years since the world stood still at the news of the helicopter crash that claimed the lives of NBA legend Kobe Bryant , his 13-year-old daughter Gianna “Gigi” Bryant, and seven others. This Monday, on January 26, 2026, the sports world stood still alongside the Bryant family and paused once again to remember their legacy.Natalia Bryant, Kobe and Vanessa's eldest, took to her Instagram stories to post a heartfelt tribute on the anniversary. The 23-year-old USC alumna shared a picture of her father and Gigi, paired with a single red heart emoji, a small but deeply affectionate sign of remembrance. The image's simplicity, devoid of any additional text, conveyed a powerful message, mirroring the quiet resilience the Bryant family has shown since the tragic loss in 2020.While the Los Angeles Lakers and the NBA celebrated the ""Black Mamba"" for his five championships and relentless drive, Natalia’s tribute focused on the man behind the jersey. In recent years, Natalia has balanced her burgeoning career in the fashion and film industries with her role as a torchbearer for her father’s mission.Just last year, she starred in a high-profile Nike commercial alongside Jalen Brunson, ensuring the ""Mamba Mentality"" continues to inspire the next generation of athletes.The Lakers organization also joined in the remembrance, sharing the now-iconic photo of Kobe in his orange WNBA hoodie alongside Gigi. Their message was brief but enduring: ""Mamba & Mambacita forever."" Former rivals and teammates, including Vince Carter, also shared memorials. Carter, who entered the league in the same era as Kobe, wrote on social media, ""Rest easy Kobe Bean and Gigi the world truly misses you both. .."" followed by a handshake emoji. He also shared a photo of all 9 people who lost their lives that day in 2020.Vanessa Bryant, Kobe's widow, has remained the bedrock of the family, raising Natalia, 9-year-old Bianka, and 6-year-old Capri while championing the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation. She also shared an image of Kobe and Gigi on her Instagram with red heart emojis, sharing her love for the two precious family members she lost.As for Natalia, she continues to carve out her own path. She recently began serving as a creative director for Lakers-related projects, and her tributes serve as a reminder that while the world lost a basketball icon, she lost a father and a sister. Six years later, that bond remains as visible and vibrant as ever. And alongside the Bryant family, the world continues to mourn and remember Kobe and Gigi Bryant.Also Read: Vanessa Bryant honors Kobe Bryant and daughter Gianna with a heartfelt tribute on their death anniversary","It has been six years since the helicopter crash that claimed the lives of NBA legend Kobe Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna “Gigi” Bryant.

United Center pays tribute to Kobe Bryant and Gigi in emotional Lakers–Bulls matchup

How Los Angeles transformed into living memorial for Kobe-Gianna and the lives lost?

January 26 marks the sixth anniversary of the tragic helicopter crash that took the lives of the Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna Bryant, and seven others. And even after six years, the pain of that day still feels close for basketball fans around the world, especially for those who grew up watching Kobe's on-court greatness.On Monday night, the Los Angeles Lakers were in Chicago for a matchup against the Chicago Bulls. Midway through the game, the United Center paid tribute to Kobe and Gianna, according to ClutchPoints, creating a moment that brought applause from both Lakers and Bulls supporters.On January 26, 2020, Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, and seven others boarded a helicopter headed to a youth basketball event in Southern California. The aircraft never reached its destination. The crash claimed nine lives and sent shockwaves through the global sports community. The grief that followed was overtly overwhelming in a way the NBA league had never seen before.The tribute in Chicago held special significance. Kobe’s journey into the league began in the same city where Michael Jordan built his empire.As a teenager in 1996, Kobe faced Jordan, learning firsthand what excellence looked like. That connection created a lasting bond between Bryant and the city. Years later, when the Lakers franchise had a fallout with Shaquille O’Neal, Chicago nearly became Kobe’s next chapter. He explored the idea seriously, even spending time exploring life in the city. Yet destiny had other plans. Kobe remained in Los Angeles, where he delivered some unforgettable moments, including an iconic 81-point performance that the Lakers recently celebrated on its 20th anniversary.Soon after the tragic passing of Kobe and his daughter Gigi Bryant, Los Angeles soon transformed into a city of tributes. Fans gathered outside Staples Center, murals appeared across neighborhoods, and jerseys with the numbers 8 and 24 became symbols of remembrance. Alongside Kobe and Gigi, the lives lost included families and individuals whose lives were equally honoured - parents, young athletes, a dedicated coach, and the pilot, all remembered as a part of a shared tragedy that united millions in grief across cultures and countries.","January 26 marks the sixth anniversary of the tragic helicopter crash that took the lives of Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna Bryant, and seven others.

Auston Matthews highlights trust and teamwork as U.S. aims for Olympic gold



The Secret To Auston Matthews' Wicked Release | On The Couch With Colby

Auston Matthews is fully aligned with Team USA’s mission heading into the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics. With NHL players returning to the Olympic stage for the first time since 2014, expectations around the American roster are no longer cautious. The standard has been set clearly, and Auston Matthews believes the group is ready to carry it.That mindset traces back to August, when U.S. general manager Bill Guerin made it clear that silver would not be enough. As the tournament draws closer, Auston Matthews says that belief has only strengthened inside the locker room.Auston Matthews’ confidence reflects a broader shift in how the United States views itself in men’s international hockey. Speaking ahead of the Games, the Toronto Maple Leafs captain pointed to Guerin’s trust in the roster as a driving force. “I think it’s just about the belief and the confidence that he has in you and the group of Americans that we have going and representing the country,” Matthews said. For Matthews and his teammates, that confidence has translated into a shared expectation to contend for gold, not simply compete.Rather than discouraging the group, recent near-misses have sharpened its edge.“I think we feel like we’re up there and we should be competing for gold,” Matthews said. The experience has reinforced how close the U.S. already is to the top and helped build chemistry that will carry over into Italy.The stakes are significant. The U.S. has not won Olympic gold in men’s hockey since the Miracle on Ice in 1980, despite reaching the gold medal game in both 2002 and 2010. On each occasion, Canada stood in the way. More recently, that familiar rival denied the Americans again in the 4 Nations Face-Off final last February, a game that still lingers for Matthews. He had two prime chances to end it in overtime before Connor McDavid sealed a 3-2 Canadian win.He credits the team’s ability to buy into roles as a defining strength. Many players arrive from their clubs used to heavy minutes and power-play responsibility, yet the Americans quickly adapted to a balanced, team-first approach at the 4 Nations. That willingness to adjust, in Matthews’ view, is what separates strong teams from championship ones.Matthews also highlighted the depth within the U.S. forward group, singling out Brock Nelson for his form and reliability. Having played alongside him in past international events, Matthews sees Nelson’s current surge as another asset heading into the Olympics.Off the ice, Matthews is looking forward to the overall Olympic experience. After years in the NHL, being part of the Games brings a different kind of meaning.","Auston Matthews is fully aligned with Team USA’s mission heading into the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics.

First, Jaxon Smith-Njigba has never played for the Dallas Cowboys. Second, his team, the Seattle Seahawks, is one of the finalists to compete for the Super Bowl. Third, Jerry Jones’ Cowboys last won a Super Bowl in 1996, so it has been 30 years. Now, what is the connection between America’s Team and the Seahawks’ third-year wide receiver?NFL Memes shared an 11-second video of Smith-Njigba seated on the bench. At the end, the camera focuses on the wideout’s tattoo, which features the Dallas Cowboys’ logo, a simple navy blue five-pointed star. They captioned their X post: “Congratulations to the Dallas Cowboys on finally making it to the Super Bowl this century.” How did cybercitizens react to this never-thought-before connection?“Cowboys fans reading this while still wearing their 1995 championship rings,” wrote one X user. Another said, “We got JSN’s tattoo AND D-Law in the Super Bowl! Go Seallas Cowhawks.” D-Law is DeMarcus Lawrence, a linebacker for Seattle who previously played for the Cowboys.A third user talked about Lawrence specifically: “Think about it this way: In Demarcus Lawrence’s 1st season with the Seahawks, he’s made more conference championships and a Super Bowl in 1 season than the Cowboys have in 30 Years. It’s a foolproof theory that once you leave the Cowboys, you are guaranteed a SB appearance soon.”A fourth user expressed, “D Law deserves a super bowl. He put up with a lot of disappointing seasons with the Cowboys.” A fifth user shared, “I noticed that too. I had to look him up and yeah, he’s from Texas.” A Cowboys fan commented, “Hey…we are going!! On his arm…but that is the closest we have gotten! Sigh.”Maliik Obee, a Seahawks.com Contributor, reported in Nov. 2023 that among Jaxon Smith-Njigba’s tattoos, one on his right arm honors his native Dallas as a tribute to his roots.When he returned to Dallas for the first time as an NFL player in 2023, Smith-Njigba shared, “I’m super excited to go home. I love playing in Dallas; it’s my favorite place to play. It’s going to be very special to me; I’ve been playing in that stadium since I was a kid.For me to have a Seahawks uniform on playing against the [Dallas] Cowboys - it’s an actual dream that I get to live out.

Seahawks Got the Win, but Kupp Got the Moment Everyone Will Remember

The Rams-Kupp Split Sounds Messier Than People Thought, and He Just Made Them Watch

Cooper Kupp did not just beat the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday. He scored the touchdown that held up in a 31-27 NFC Championship Game win, sending his former team home and putting the Seattle Seahawks in the Super Bowl.Then the postgame reporting made the moment sharper. According to The Athletic’s Michael Silver, Kupp believed Los Angeles pushed him toward retirement and even tried to steer other teams toward lowball offers after he hit free agency.Seattle advanced to its fourth Super Bowl appearance in franchise history by beating the Rams by four points, per The Sporting News. Quarterback Sam Darnold led the way with 346 yards and three touchdowns after a rough regular-season history against Los Angeles, but Kupp landed the headline play.Kupp scored Seattle’s final touchdown in the third quarter to make it 31-20. That ended up being the winning score once Puka Nacua narrowed it to 31-27. Kupp finished with four catches for 36 yards and a touchdown, fourth on the Seahawks in receiving behind Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Kenneth Walker, and Rashid Shaheed.After the win, Kupp posted “IT WAS WRITTEN.” on social media.The reporting around Kupp’s exit paints a breakup that went beyond football decisions.In February, Kupp said the Rams intended to trade him and added, “I don’t agree with the decision and always believed it was going to begin and end in L.A.” He was later released in March and eventually landed with Seattle.Silver reported that “rather than trying to negotiate a salary reduction with the former All-Pro, the Rams had unceremoniously cut ties, urging him to retire.” Silver also reported that Kupp “came to believe that some L.A. officials had cautioned potential suitors against paying him anything more than the veteran minimum, suggesting that age and an accumulation of injuries had provoked a steep decline.”Kupp acknowledged the relationship was strained by the end. “When it ended with the Rams,” he told Silver, “we weren’t in a good place.”Now, the Rams have to sit with the optics: the player they could not trade, then released, just helped knock them out of the NFC title game and is headed to Super Bowl LX against the New England Patriots.",Cooper Kupp scored the go-ahead touchdown as the Seattle Seahawks beat the Los Angeles Rams 31-27 in the NFC Championship Game.

Edmonton Oilers' defenseman Mattias Ekholm reflects on his first career hat-trick performance against Anaheim Ducks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/edmonton-oilers-defenseman-mattias-ekholm-reflects-on-his-first-career-hat-trick-performance-against-anaheim-ducks/articleshow/127637434.cms,"Mattias Ekholm with the Oilers last night (Via Getty Images)

Edmonton Oilers set record while Mattias Ekholm’s hat-trick ends Anaheim’s Ducks’ undefeated streak

For a player who readily admits he's not known for offensive production, Mattias Ekholm picked quite the moment to find his scoring touch. The veteran defenseman recorded his first NHL hat trick Monday night in the Oilers' 7-4 victory over the Ducks, capping the achievement with an empty-net goal in the final seconds.The accomplishment made history beyond Ekholm's personal milestone. Edmonton became the first team in NHL history to feature defensemen scoring hat tricks in consecutive games, with Bouchard's three-goal, three-assist performance on Saturday followed by Ekholm's Monday masterpiece.While the Oilers entered yesterday’s game as the clear favorites, the visiting Ducks were in red-hot form. But by the time the final buzzer went off, Edmonton had demolished the away team, winning their second game in a row at Rogers placeEkholm remained the star of the show and when asked if he was jealous of Evan Bouchard's hat trick performance just two days earlier against Washington, Ekholm laughed off the suggestion. ""Yeah, yes, nothing I thought about before, but I guess that's how it turned out,"" he said. ""So yeah, fun moment.""The timing couldn't have been more unexpected for the 35-year-old Swedish defenseman. Playing in his 938th career game, Ekholm entered the contest with just three goals through 53 games this season. He'd gone 20 consecutive games without finding the back of the net before Monday's explosion.""I'm usually not known for my goal-scoring ability,"" Ekholm told reporters.""I couldn't buy a goal for 20 games and then three in one."" The self-deprecating comment captured Ekholm's surprise at the achievement. When asked if this was his first career hat trick, he paused before confirming it was indeed his first at any level as far as he could remember.Ekholm's final goal came on an empty-net opportunity with Edmonton protecting a two-goal lead. ""That last face-off, we're up by two,"" he explained. ""If we were up by one, I'd probably just try to chip it out. But yeah, I tried to take a look at it at least, to see what happens. Fortunate enough to get it in there.""The performance helped Edmonton snap Anaheim's seven-game winning streak and improved the Oilers to 27-19-8 on the season. Leon Draisaitl contributed four assists while Connor McDavid and Zach Hyman each added a goal and an assist.The Oilers will look to build momentum when they host San Jose on Thursday, seeking their first three-game winning streak of the season.",Mattias Ekholm recorded his first NHL hat trick Monday night in the Oilers' 7-4 victory over the Ducks.
