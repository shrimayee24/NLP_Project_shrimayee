"Tigress survives years with snare knotted around stomach, raises healthy cubs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tigress-survives-years-with-snare-knotted-around-stomach-raises-healthy-cubs/articleshow/120743307.cms,"PILIBHIT: A tigress whose lower back was cinched for years by a metallic snare - an injury so severe it had reshaped her into a silhouette almost cheetah-like - continued not only to survive but to give birth to healthy cubs , a rare feat observed recently in the Surai forest range of Terai East forest division. First sighted with the embedded snare in 2022, and rediscovered in Dec 2023, the tigress stunned forest officials who, as they prepared to dart her for rescue, witnessed her carrying a cub gently in her mouth, a moment that suspended the operation and reframed the story they thought they were about to tell.From the beginning, her case defied expectation. The metallic loop had lodged itself deep in her lumbosacral region, an area crucial for mobility and balance. Yet, despite the physical restrictions - and the internal damage that experts later suspected - she moved through her habitat with enough stealth and strength to hunt, mate, conceive, and rear a litter. Drone surveillance launched after the interrupted rescue attempt confirmed what seemed almost improbable: four cubs, nursed and nurtured, thriving in her care.Today, three of those cubs, now around sixteen months old, roam the forest with their mother, who continues to hunt and provide for them with a tenacity that belies the injury written into her body. To the team observing her, and to the wider circle of wildlife biologists, her survival - and that of her cubs - has become a living case study in endurance, adaptation, and the hidden margins of possibility in the wild.At the Wildlife Institute of India, where a detailed plan for her future is under discussion, Dr Parag Nigam told TOI that the need to rescue the tigress remained urgent. ""The metallic snare poses serious physical and spinal risks that could worsen with time,"" he said, adding that her images would be sent to WII's tiger cell to cross-reference her history with national tiger databases.Veterinary experts studying her case noted the narrow anatomical escape that had allowed her to survive and reproduce. Dr R K Singh, former veterinary head of Kanpur zoo, explained that the snare's position likely spared her kidneys and ovaries, trapping mostly the intestinal loops instead.","A tigress whose lower back was cinched for years by a metallic snare continued to survive and give birth to healthy cubs.

Shannon Sharpe, the NFL legend who used to co-host ESPN’s First Take with Stephen A. Smith, enjoyed a pretty successful and lucrative career until it all came to a standstill a few days ago.

Shedeur Sanders' net worth 2025: How much money does the new Browns quarterback have?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/shedeur-sanders-net-worth-2025-how-much-money-does-the-new-browns-quarterback-have/articleshow/120730178.cms,"Shedeur Sanders, once college football’s top NIL earner, risks stability for an uncertain NFL career after being drafted in the fifth round by the Browns.

What is Shedeur Sanders' net worth?



As the 2025 NFL Draft unfolded, many eyes were glued to the screen for one reason — Shedeur Sanders . The Colorado quarterback, known for his playmaking skills and magnetic persona, was expected to be an early pick. However, the draft night narrative took an unexpected twist. Sanders slid all the way to the 144th pick, where the Cleveland Browns finally took the leap.“Draft time is not real time,” reflected veteran agent Leigh Steinberg. “It’s water-torture time. Every second seems like a minute. Every minute seems like an hour. Drip, drip, drip.”For Sanders, this wasn’t just about waiting — it was about watching his payday shrink. Still, the dynamic quarterback enters the league not in his father's shadow, but blazing a path of his own, already among college football's top earners.Shedeur Sanders, son of NFL legend Deion Sanders, has had one of the most watched journeys in modern football. Once hailed as the face of the NIL revolution, Shedeur’s decision to go pro—despite lucrative college opportunities—underscores both the allure and risks of chasing an NFL dream.Sanders has a net worth of $4 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth . Born on February 7, 2002, and raised under the tutelage of his father, Shedeur developed into a standout quarterback at Trinity Christian School in Texas. A four-star recruit, he initially committed to Florida Atlantic University before pivoting to Jackson State when his father took over as head coach. There, he didn’t just thrive—he dominated. Winning the Jerry Rice Award as the best freshman in FCS football, he quickly became one of college football’s most recognizable stars.His move to the University of Colorado only amplified his visibility. Though the Buffaloes had mixed results, Shedeur’s individual performance—marked by accuracy, decision-making, and mobility—kept NFL scouts intrigued. Off the field, he was a marketing juggernaut. With endorsement deals from Gatorade, Beats by Dre, and Mercedes-Benz, and a social media following that rivaled pro athletes, his NIL earnings reportedly topped $5 million. “He was the highest-paid NIL player in college sports,” noted various reports.But despite the potential to earn even more by staying in college—especially as players like Carson Beck and Darian Mensah continued profiting from NIL—Shedeur entered the 2025 NFL Draft. Deion Sanders confidently declared his son a top-five pick, but doubts around Shedeur’s mechanics and leadership led to a surprising slide. The Cleveland Browns selected him in the fifth round, 144th overall.His rookie deal averages just over $1.16 million annually—with no guaranteed money. And given the NFL’s harsh reality, where nearly half of fifth-rounders don’t make the roster, Shedeur’s professional path is filled with uncertainty.Still, with his pedigree, media appeal, and raw talent, Shedeur Sanders may yet prove that betting on oneself—despite the odds—is the ultimate power move in today’s evolving football economy. NFL world will keep an sharp eye on him.Also Read: Is Shedeur Sanders making a financial sacrifice by entering the NFL instead of staying in college?","Shedeur Sanders, son of NFL legend Deion Sanders, entered the 2025 NFL Draft.

Details



LeBron’s Player Option



LeBron James holds a $52.6M option for 2025-26. If he opts in, he can veto any trade due to his no-trade clause.



New Contract Possibility



If LeBron signs a new deal without a no-trade clause, the Los Angeles Lakers could move him mid-season.

Dolphins’ new quarterback choice signals a bold shift in long-term strategy

Backup quarterback’s seven-figure loss reflects deeper emotional stakes

The Miami Dolphins have sparked major conversation across the NFL landscape after drafting a new quarterback from the Texas Longhorns, a move signaling potential change at the most critical position. As a result, current starter Tua Tagovailoa finds himself navigating a wave of uncertainty, with both emotional and financial consequences rippling through the team.In an unexpected but calculated move, the Miami Dolphins' front office made it clear they are thinking beyond the present by investing in a young quarterback prospect. This decision doesn’t just add competition—it signals the beginning of a strategic transition. With fresh talent entering the locker room, the message is unmistakable: the franchise is determined to secure its future, even if it means re-evaluating relationships with established stars like Tagovailoa.Tua Tagovailoa’s career with the Dolphins has been a testament to both brilliance and adversity. After battling through a series of injuries, especially concussions, Tagovailoa showed resilience time and again. Yet, the physical toll of the game has never been far from mind for both the player and the organization. The recent draft move forces a tough reality into focus—balancing loyalty to a battle-tested leader with the practical need to protect the team’s long-term viability.Adding to the drama, the team’s backup quarterback reportedly suffered a jaw-dropping seven-figure financial loss in the wake of the draft move.

Former Indian off-spinner R Ashwin revealed he contemplated retirement after his 100th Test but made the final decision during the Australia tour when he wasn't selected for the Perth Test, with Washington Sundar playing instead. Ashwin, who retired at the Gabba after the third Test against Australia, shared these details during a new podcast by Chennai Super Kings with Mike Hussey.Ashwin played his final Test match at the Gabba after featuring in the second Test at Adelaide. He had been left out of the playing eleven for the third Test where he announced his retirement.The 38-year-old spinner, who is currently playing for Chennai Super Kings, finished his Test career as India's second-highest wicket-taker with 537 scalps.""To be very honest, I wanted to do it after my 100th Test. And then I thought, Ok, let me give it a go in the home season. Because, I mean, you're playing well, and you're getting wickets, you're making runs,"" Ashwin said.""I thought I'd probably close off with the Chennai Test here. I ended up getting a six-wicket haul and a hundred. So it's very tough to quit when you're doing very well,"" he added.""So, I went on with the series, and we lost against New Zealand. So, one after the other, it was just building up. And then I thought, okay, let me go to Australia. Let me see how this goes. Because the last time I was in Australia, I had a great, great tour.""Family time was becoming a significant factor in his decision to retire. The physical and mental demands of the game were taking their toll.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? ""I thought it does make sense to play a bit. I was having a lot of fun, but the whole hard yards that I had to put through to put myself in the park again, physically and mentally, one of the most important things that was pulling me down was the family time,"" he explained.His non-selection in Perth ultimately influenced his decision to retire. ""And when I didn't start in Perth, it was like, okay, this whole circle keeps going again. People add very little value to what you're going through emotionally,"" Ashwin said.""They don't really consider that because your emotions are yours, and it doesn't matter to anybody else.

John Lynch’s lesson to Shedeur Sanders



Lynch shows empathy for Shedeur Sanders



In the high-stakes world of the NFL Draft, where hype often overshadows talent, one quarterback is proving that where you're picked doesn’t always determine your future. Brock Purdy , selected as the final pick of the 2022 NFL Draft, is shattering expectations. Now, as he leads the San Francisco 49ers to Super Bowl glory and two NFC Championship appearances, the team is looking to extend his contract. His rise to NFL stardom is a powerful lesson for Shedeur Sanders , who faced an unexpected slide in the 2023 draft.Shedeur Sanders , known for his stellar college career and impressive stats, leading the Big 12 in passing yards, touchdowns, and completion percentage was widely expected to be one of the top quarterbacks selected in the 2023 NFL Draft. Instead, he found himself dropping to the fifth round, a surprising fall that left many scratching their heads. Despite his college success, the Cleveland Browns passed on him twice in the second round before selecting him in the fifth.In the wake of Sanders' draft slide, John Lynch, the 49ers' general manager, stepped forward with a message of encouragement. Reflecting on the unexpected success of Brock Purdy, Lynch reminded everyone that a player’s draft position doesn't define their potential. ""It’s not when you go, it’s not where you go, it’s what you do with that opportunity,"" Lynch shared in a post-draft press conference. Purdy’s journey from being overlooked by 31 teams to leading the 49ers to the brink of a Super Bowl—proves that success is built on the right mindset and seizing opportunities, no matter when or where they come.Lynch showed empathy for Sanders, acknowledging the emotional toll of the draft process. “It’s tough for a young man, but I know that he's a competitor.” Lynch said, recognizing the pressure and disappointment Sanders likely faced. But he also emphasized Sanders' competitive nature, expressing confidence that the quarterback now has the chance to prove his worth with the Cleveland Browns.Much like Purdy, Sanders now has a golden opportunity to prove his doubters wrong. While his fall in the draft may have been a blow to his pride, it also positions him to make a statement and potentially redefine his career. This is the moment where he can transform his narrative from an overlooked prospect to a standout NFL star.Also Read: “How Much Time Do You Have?” Jalen Milroe’s honest yet witty reply on where he needs to improve As Lynch reminded everyone, the real question isn’t about when or where you’re drafted, but what you do once you get the chance. And now, the ball is in Sanders' court. Can he rise above the doubt and take his career to new heights, just like Brock Purdy did? Only time will tell, but if his competitive spirit matches his talent, he might just become the next success story the NFL never saw coming.","Shedeur Sanders was widely expected to be one of the top quarterbacks selected in the 2023 NFL Draft.

Yuzvendra Chahal strength of a warrior sir.”The comment, shared on Instagram, quickly gained attention — not only for the praise it heaped on Chahal, but also because of ongoing dating rumours linking the RJ and the star spinner.The post added fuel to fan curiosity while celebrating one of the greatest bowling displays of IPL 2025 so far.Playing for Punjab Kings, Chahal turned the tide in the 19th over of the CSK innings at Chepauk.With CSK cruising at 177 for 5 and looking to finish strong, the leg-spinner struck gold, removing MS Dhoni , Deepak Hooda, Anshul Kamboj, and Noor Ahmad in the space of just six balls.He finished with incredible figures of 4 for 32 in just three overs.Dhoni, who had just hit Chahal for a six, was caught trying to clear long-off.Hooda and Kamboj followed in quick succession, both falling cheaply.Chahal sealed his hat-trick with the wicket of Noor Ahmad, joining an elite list of bowlers to take four wickets in a single IPL over.This was Chahal’s second IPL hat-trick and a record-breaking ninth instance of him claiming four or more wickets in an innings, the most in league history.The performance stunned CSK and tilted the momentum completely in Punjab’s favour.","Punjab Kings spinner Yuzvendra Chahal took a hat-trick against Chennai Super Kings.

Giannis Antetokounmpo and Tyrese Haliburton’s father’s altercation stole the spotlight at Gainbridge Fieldhouse



Fans reacted to Giannis Antetokounmpo’s confrontation with Tyrese Haliburton’s father

The Indiana Pacers edged out a dramatic 119-118 overtime victory against the Milwaukee Bucks . While Tyrese Haliburton 's game-winning shot over Giannis Antetokounmpo lit up Gainbridge Fieldhouse, the postgame headlines were stolen by a courtside altercation between Giannis and Haliburton's father, John. Fans online are not happy with John’s move, as many are asking the NBA to ban him from the playoffs.Giannis Antetokounmpo was making his way off the court when John Haliburton approached him, waving a towel with his son's face on it and allegedly yelling, “This is what we do.” The bold move did not sit well with the two-time MVP, who interpreted the act as a blatant show of disrespect. Giannis responded, and the two ended up in a tense face-to-face standoff that required players and staff from both benches to intervene.Giannis later addressed the confrontation: “I believe in being humble in victory. That’s who I am,” he said in his postgame comments. “Some people will say when you win the game, you can talk s___ and say it’s a green light for you to be disrespectful. I disagree. I’ve won a championship, they haven’t.”The Bucks star added, “I feel like that’s very, very disrespectful.”Tyrese Haliburton didn’t shy away from the issue either. Addressing the incident in his postgame press conference, he took accountability for his father’s actions. “As far as the incident between Giannis and my pops, I had no idea until I got to the back and was shown the video. I don’t agree with what transpired... I don’t think that my pops was in the right at all there.”Fans online quickly shared their thoughts on the matter. Many demand a ban on John Haliburton from the NBA games as a form of punishment.“Better be banned for the rest of the playoffs for this dumb s*it,” one fan wrote on X.“Father should be banned for rest of playoffs,” another echoed the same.“Father a bad example of sportsmanship,” another wrote.“I’m glad i saw this angle cause Hali dad was deff in the wrong for taunting Giannis after a big loss like that,” another shared.“What a clown,” one fan condemned the action of John.“Why is he seeking out a 7 foot Greek god like that.

NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings (PBKS) have suffered a major blow ahead of their crucial IPL 2025 clash against Chennai Super Kings , as star Australian all-rounder Glenn Maxwell has been ruled out of the remainder of the tournament due to a fractured finger.PBKS skipper Shreyas Iyer confirmed the news at the toss on Wednesday, saying, “Unfortunate that he's got a fractured finger. Haven’t decided on a replacement so far.”Maxwell, bought for a hefty Rs 4.2 crore, has had a disappointing season with the bat, scoring just 48 runs in seven matches at an average of 8.00.While he managed to pick up four wickets, his overall performance fell well short of expectations, and his absence now leaves a significant hole in the PBKS middle order.PBKS will still back themselves to perform at Chepauk, coming into the match with five wins from nine games and sitting fifth on the table.With the playoffs in sight, they’ll look to cement their position with a win against a struggling CSK.For Chennai, this is a do-or-die clash. Languishing at the bottom of the table with just two wins in nine matches, the Super Kings are desperate to reignite their campaign.Despite the return of MS Dhoni as captain after Ruturaj Gaikwad’s injury, CSK have failed to turn things around. Poor form from senior players like Ravindra Jadeja, Rachin Ravindra, and Matheesha Pathirana has hurt their chances badly.However, CSK have found hope in young Ayush Mhatre, who impressed on debut and will again be key against PBKS’s potent bowling attack, especially in the powerplay against Arshdeep Singh.The duel between Shivam Dube and Yuzvendra Chahal in the middle overs could also prove decisive.With both teams having everything to play for, fans can expect a high-stakes showdown tonight in Chennai.","Glenn Maxwell ruled out of remainder of IPL with fractured finger.

Washington Capitals rely on playoff experience and offensive depth



Hurricanes and Capitals renew playoff rivalry



The Washington Capitals and Carolina Hurricanes are on a collision course in the Eastern Conference Second Round and this isn’t just another playoff matchup. It’s a rematch layered in history, hostility, and high-speed chaos. With both teams emerging from emotional first-round battles, this next chapter promises physicality, mind games, and no shortage of drama.After eliminating the Montreal Canadiens in five games, the Capitals look locked in. Dylan Strome leads the charge with nine points, while veterans like Alex Ovechkin and Tom Wilson are delivering when it matters most. Washington’s attack is deep, and its power play remains lethal.But the injury to starting goalie Logan Thompson adds uncertainty. Backup Charlie Lindgren has held his own but can he hold up under the relentless pressure Carolina brings? Washington’s ability to control possession will be key. As Strome said bluntly: “Everyone kind of knows how they play, they dump a lot of pucks in.”The Capitals know how to win. But against a team like Carolina, playoff experience must be paired with relentless hustle and discipline or it could unravel quickly.The Hurricanes advanced after a double-overtime thriller against the New Jersey Devils. Led by Sebastian Aho and Andrei Svechnikov, Carolina’s offense is quick, smart, and opportunistic. But what truly separates them is their style, constant puck pressure, aggressive forechecking, and smart zone denial.Goaltending could be the swing factor. Frederik Andersen posted elite numbers before his injury, and Pyotr Kochetkov stepped in to close out the Devils. If Carolina’s crease remains steady, their system can suffocate even elite offenses.This isn’t the first time these teams have clashed in the postseason, Carolina knocked out Washington in seven games back in 2019. That wound hasn’t healed, and both sides know what’s at stake now.Also Read: Gustavsson's sudden illness forces Fleury into action as Minnesota Wild fall to Golden Knights in overtime From Alex Ovechkin’s firepower to Carolina’s grit and grind, this series has all the makings of a playoff classic.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

"Chaos at PNC Park: Pirate fan falls from 21-foot Clemente Wall mid-game in Pittsburgh, players halt play to call for help",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/chaos-at-pnc-park-fan-falls-from-21-foot-clemente-wall-mid-game-in-pittsburgh-players-halt-play-to-call-for-help/articleshow/120782092.cms,"A fan is carted off the field at PNC Park after falling out of the stands during the seventh inning of a baseball game between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Chicago Cubs in Pittsburgh, Wednesday, April 30, 2025. (AP)

What began as a thrilling seventh-inning rally by the Pittsburgh Pirates on Wednesday night quickly turned into a scene of fear and silence, as a man fell from the 21-foot-high Clemente Wall in right field at PNC Park .The fall occurred moments after Andrew McCutchen smacked a two-run double that gave the Pirates a 4-3 lead over the Chicago Cubs . But as fans roared and players celebrated, attention abruptly shifted toward the warning track, where the man lay motionless after plummeting over the outfield wall.Players from both teams urgently waved for medical help. Pirates manager Derek Shelton and Cubs manager Craig Counsell immediately rushed to alert the umpiring crew. “Even though it’s 350 feet away, the way he went down and then just laid there, it was awful,” Shelton said. “That’s an understatement.”Trainers from both teams and stadium staff tended to the man for nearly five minutes before he was carefully loaded onto a cart and driven off the field. The Pirates later said he was taken to Allegheny General Hospital. His condition remains unknown.McCutchen was seen holding a cross from his necklace, praying alongside teammates. Cubs players dropped to their knees, heads bowed. “I didn’t see it happen, but from the look on Counsell’s face, I knew it was serious,” said Cubs shortstop Dansby Swanson. “I’ve never been part of something like that. I hope I never am again.”The incident rekindled painful memories of previous stadium tragedies, including the 2015 fall of a Braves fan at Turner Field and the 2011 death of a Texas Rangers fan reaching for a ball. Despite those past warnings, fans continue to fall victim to steep drops at sporting venues.Though play resumed, the atmosphere inside PNC Park never fully recovered.As Swanson put it: “Fans are why we get to do what we love. Tonight was a brutal reminder of how fragile life can be—even in a ballpark.”",The fall occurred moments after Andrew McCutchen smacked a two-run double that gave the Pirates a 4-3 lead over the Chicago Cubs.

What’s the tile game Meghan Markle played on Netflix? A beginner’s guide to mahjong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/whats-the-tile-game-meghan-markle-played-on-netflix-a-beginners-guide-to-mahjong/articleshow/120736644.cms,"Meghan Markle played the game of Mahjong in her Netflix series

From the Qing dynasty to pop culture

How is mahjong played?

Connor Wan, a 29-year-old British-Chinese artist, learned mahjong while visiting family in Hong Kong. He enjoyed it so much that he started the Four Winds Mahjong Club in London, and later brought it to Toronto after moving there in 2024. “Moving countries is hard, especially when you don’t know anyone,” he said. The club became popular quickly, not as a place for gambling, but for making friends and celebrating Asian culture. Nicole Wong, a writer and audio producer from California, started playing mahjong as a teenager with her grandparents. She later began The Mahjong Project in 2019 to share the game’s cultural stories and organise pop-up game nights. This year, she published a book called Mahjong: House Rules from Across the Asian Diaspora. Nicole says the sound of the tiles is especially powerful. “Mahjong is more than just fun,” she says. “It has a deep history and brings back strong memories.” In Toronto, Robyn Feldberg has taught over 250 people how to play mahjong through her courses. She donates all the money—about $50,000 so far—to charities like Save A Child’s Heart. She says the game is especially popular with young mothers who want a fun way to relax and connect with others. “They tell me, ‘We want something that’s just for us,’” she said.

A centuries-old Chinese game called mahjong is having a modern revival across continents, from luxury cruise ships and trendy hotel lounges to Meghan Markle’s Netflix series.In the sixth episode of her docuseries With Love, the Duchess of Sussex invites friends for a cosy game night – playing mahjong, reports the Globe and Mail.The four-person tile-based game, traditionally associated with Chinese culture, is now catching on with new generations across the globe. “The game itself is really so fun,” says Markle. “But what was so great was the idea of learning something new with your friends, together... the mahjong becomes the background of the expansion of friendship. It’s the feeling of community.”Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China. Traditionally played with 144 tiles, the game blends skill, strategy and a touch of luck. Players pick and discard tiles to form winning hands, much like the card game rummy.The game’s expansion across the world has now erupted into a full-blown trend. The World Mahjong Championship was recently held in Mississauga, Ontario – the first time it’s been hosted in North America. Hotels such as the Ace Hotel New York and Thompson Hotel Dallas regularly hold mahjong-themed nights.Fans with money to spare are buying fancy mahjong sets from Hermès, Louis Vuitton, and Ralph Lauren. Some are even splashing out on luxury tables that shuffle the tiles automatically – costing over $4,500.Even cruise ships have joined the trend, offering mahjong tournaments and special rooms just for playing the game.Mahjong is played with 144 tiles. Players begin by shuffling the tiles face down. Everyone rolls dice and the highest roller becomes the dealer. Each player picks 36 tiles and builds a wall—two rows of 18 tiles. The walls are pushed forward, creating a space in the middle for discards. Each player then draws 13 tiles (the dealer starts with 14), and the game begins.Players take turns drawing one tile and discarding one, always keeping 13 tiles in hand. You can draw a new tile or pick up someone’s discarded one. If a discarded tile helps complete a set (called a meld), you can grab it, announce the set, and show the tiles. To win, a player must have four melds (like three or four matching tiles or a sequence of three in a suit) and one pair (two matching tiles)—making 14 tiles total.There are five types of tiles: Bamboo, Characters, Dots (these are the three main suits), and special tiles called Honors (Dragons and Winds) and Bonus (Flowers and Seasons). Each suit goes from 1 to 9. Honors and Bonus tiles add extra excitement but aren't needed to win. Mahjong mixes strategy and memory with a bit of luck—and it’s all about building the right sets before your opponents do.For many mahjong fans, it’s not just a game but a deeply social experience.","Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China.

As the world mourns the passing of Pope Francis , a TikToker has found a viral way to keep younger audiences engaged in the otherwise secretive process of choosing the next Pope by turning it into a fantasy league, reports The Washington Times.The papal conclave , set to begin on May 7 at the Vatican, will see cardinals from across the globe gather behind closed doors to vote for the next head of the Catholic Church . While the centuries-old process is steeped in tradition, one content creator on TikTok is bringing a modern twist to it.The Tik Toker named Max, going by the username of @itismaxhooray has launched what he calls the Pope League , a fantasy football-style game where users pick a cardinal and earn points based on how their pick performs in the voting rounds.“There are 10 times the number of people in this sweepstakes as there are cardinals in the Catholic Church, making it bigger and therefore more legitimate than the real conclave,” Max was quoted as saying by the Independent.The idea quickly went viral. The Washington Times reported that over 2,000 people signed up for the game on the very first day, after Max’s videos were viewed more than 100,000 times. Participants can earn ""Pope points"" and even imagine themselves “becoming the next Pope” through the game.The real conclave is expected to be closely watched, especially since most of the cardinals voting were appointed by Pope Francis himself. This has raised questions about whether the next Pontiff will continue the current path of reform or shift to a more moderate direction.Pope Francis died on April 21 at the age of 88 in Vatican City. His funeral was attended by world leaders, dignitaries, and thousands of mourners from around the globe.","The papal conclave, set to begin on May 7 at the Vatican, will see cardinals from across the globe gather behind closed doors to vote for the next head of the Catholic Church.

Fresh from their thumping nine-wicket win over Gujarat Titans, Rajasthan Royals will lock horns against high-flying Mumbai Indians (MI) in match no 50 of the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) at the Sawai Mansingh in Jaipur on Thursday.With 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi potentially playing the knock of the tournament on Monday, the Royals have found a ray of hope in what has been an IPL campaign of missed opportunities. The hosts still have a mathematical chance of making the play-offs but deep down the management has accepted its fate.For Hardik Pandya-led Mumbai Indians, the return of Jasprit Bumrah has coincided with their ascent to the top of the table. The perennial slow starters have now collected five wins on the bounce and look unstoppable.Historically, chasing has been easier at Sai Mansingh, often due to dew setting in later in the evening, which can make the pitch flatter and harder for bowlers to grip the ball. Expect a match where batsmen can score freely, and chasing might be the preferred strategy. However, bowlers will need to be smart with their variations and lengths to contain the run flow.Yashasvi Jaiswal, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Riyan Parag (c), Nitish Rana, Dhruv Jurel (wk), Shimron Hetmyer, Shubham Dubey, Wanindu Hasaranga, Jofra Archer, Maheesh Theekshana, Sandeep SharmaTushar Deshpande and Kumar Kartikeya,Rohit Sharma, Ryan Rickelton, Will Jacks, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Naman Dhir, Deepak Chahar, Mitchell Santner, Jasprit Bumrah, Trent BoultVignesh Puthur and Karn SharmaHead-to-head301415Temperature is likely to hover in range of 28°C to 39°C during the day and evening match hours.

We need to be more proactive all the way through: Stephen Fleming

The gravity-defying catch Dewald Brevis pulled off on Wednesday night was probably the lone shining light for the Chennai Super Kings (CSK), who are enduring a dismal season.Brevis' catch stunned the cricketing world, and the 22-year-old has been appreciated for his exceptional presence of mind at the boundary rope.In the first two balls of the 18th over, Punjab Kings' Shashank Singh hammered Ravindra Jadeja for a boundary and a six. Shashank was looking to finish the game in a hurry and was looking to clear the rope again, but Brevis, with his excellent awareness, caught it in the thin air at deep mid-wicket.Brevis, patrolling at long-on, ran and made the first contact with the ball inside the field of play as he caught it, then threw it up in the air. He crossed the rope but was airborne when he flicked the ball back inside the field of play and then came back to catch it.Meanwhile, with another loss, CSK's journey in IPL 2025 came to a disappointing end as they became the first team to be officially eliminated from the playoff race following a thrilling four-wicket loss to Punjab Kings at the MA Chidambaram Stadium.This marks a historic low for the MS Dhoni-led franchise, as they have now failed to make it to the playoffs in two consecutive seasons – something that had never happened before in the team’s illustrious history.Batting first at Chepauk, CSK rode on a magnificent knock by Sam Curran, who scored a fluent 88 off just 47 balls, featuring nine fours and four sixes. Coming in at a precarious 48 for 3 in the power-play, Curran took charge of the innings and stitched a vital 78-run stand with Dewald Brevis (32), steadying the ship and lifting CSK towards a competitive total.When CSK seemed to be setting up a strong finish, Yuzvendra Chahal turned the game on its head. The leg-spinner, who had bowled just two overs until the 19th, returned to bowl the penultimate over and scripted a remarkable collapse.After being hit for a six by Dhoni, Chahal dismissed him the very next ball. What followed was a procession – Deepak Hooda, Anshul Kamboj, and Noor Ahmad all fell in quick succession as Chahal picked up a sensational hat-trick, his second in the IPL, to restrict CSK to 190.In reply, Punjab Kings, despite losing a few wickets in the middle overs, including the well-set Prabhsimran and Shashank Singh (23), remained calm. Iyer's composed acceleration and a bit of luck at the death helped Punjab chase down the target in 19.4 overs.",Dewald Brevis caught Shashank Singh off the bowling of Yuzvendra Chahal. CSK lost by four wickets to Punjab Kings at the MA Chidambaram Stadium.

Preity Zinta Applauds PBKS Openers

Punjab Kings (PBKS) co-owner Preity Zinta says she is a ""happy girl"" after her team defeated Chennai Super Kings by four wickets at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Wednesday.After a tense finish, where Punjab got over the line, the PBKS team owner wrote on X: ""Yeahhhhhh !!! appa jeet gaye (We won)! What a superb team effort!""Chasing 191, Punjab Kings openers Priyansh Arya and Prabhsimran put on 44 for the first wicket. Prabhsimran brought up his second successive fifty in 31 balls, but his momentum was halted when he miscued a big shot off Noor and was caught at deep midwicket for 54. At that stage, PBKS were 116/2 after 13 overs, needing 75 from 42 balls. Shreyas Iyer tried to finish things in style but was bowled by a full delivery from Pathirana for a sublime 72 off 41 balls.Punjab's captain also received high praise from Preity Zinta.""Captain’s knock, openers’ fifty, an amazing hattrick & stunning catches! What a brilliant chase on a tricky ground, almost giving me a last-over heart attack.""So proud of the way Sadda Punjab played. I’m a happy girl tonight.
