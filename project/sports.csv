Sidney Crosby 15 years long relationship with girlfriend Kathy Leutner





NHL legend Sidney Crosby has not only guided the Pittsburgh Penguins to championship heights but has also established a quiet, solid, long-lasting relationship off the ice with long-time girlfriend American model Kathy Leutner. Though Sidney Crosby's on-ice accomplishments are well-documented, his love life has long been kept under wraps. Kathy Leutner has been his constant companion, regularly seen cheering him on at pivotal matches but never hankering for the limelight herself.The two began dating back in 2008 when they were introduced by common friends. Sidney Crosby was an NHL superstar by then, while Kathy Leutner was establishing a thriving modeling career for brands including Abercrombie & Fitch, Hollister, and Faviana. She was selected in 2011 to appear on Sports Illustrated's model search and was one of the very few women from her agency to receive an in-office interview with the editorial team. Kathy Leutner has been Sidney Crosby's rock since the start of his NHL career. They met when he was just 21 years old, in his third NHL season with the Pittsburgh Penguins.Born in 1986 in Chantilly, Virginia, Kathryn A. Leutner is the daughter of John and Judith Leutner.She graduated from Chantilly High School in 2004 and was offered a partial athletic scholarship from James Madison University, a testament to her prowess in the sport. Despite her strong ties to athletics, modeling quickly took over. She was discovered at a mall near her hometown, just a year after graduating from high school, while shopping with her mother.Kathy began her modeling career in 2005 and got her big break in 2011 when she appeared in Sports Illustrated magazine.Leutner once confessed in an initial interview that sports was her main focus, but the moment she entered the modeling world, she knew that this was what she was meant to do. Her dream came true when she started gracing the covers of Fitness Magazine and landing campaigns for big lifestyle brands.The couple is yet to make any announcements of marriage plans; their long-term relationship speaks of a connection much stronger than social media pronouncements or red carpet sightings.Sidney Crosby and Kathy Leutner are arguably the sport's most low-key celebrity couple, but their almost two-decade relationship is telling. Where fame usually drowns out personal life, this couple shows us that true love doesn't require attention. While Crosby keeps working on building his NHL legacy, Leutner is his biggest fan, sitting quietly in the background while still playing an important role behind the scenes.Also Read: With Mike Sullivan gone and Dan Muse in, Sidney Crosby’s loyalty faces the ultimate test","Sidney Crosby and Kathy Leutner have been together for 15 years.

Why Reaves Could Be on the Move

How This Trade Impacts the Lakers





Theare no strangers to blockbuster moves, and this offseason could bring another seismic shift. Rumors are swirling that the franchise may be eyeing a trade with the Dallas Mavericks to acquire rising star center—a dynamic big man with proven chemistry alongside Luka Dončić. In a potential multi-team deal, the Lakers could part ways with fan favorite Austin Reaves to secure the 21-year-old rim protector, signaling a bold pivot toward youth and athleticism.According to Sports Illustrated’s Jackson Caudell , the Lakers could part ways with Austin Reaves in a multi-team deal to acquire Dereck Lively II, the 21-year-old big man who thrived in Dallas.Caudell outlines a potential trade scenario involving multiple teams and players: Los Angeles Lakers receive: Dereck Lively II and Terance Mann- Mavericks receive: Austin Reaves, Dalton Knecht, Georges Niang, Shake Milton, a 2027 second-round pick, and a 2029 second-round pick- Hawks receive: Naji Marshall and P.J. Washington""Yes they lose Reaves, but they get one of the best centers in the NBA and one that has plenty of familiarity with Doncic. They keep their picks and have other expiring deals they can send out to upgrade the rest of their roster around Doncic, Lively, and (LeBron) James."" (H/t: Sporting News He also notes that Reaves’ impending contract extension could make trading him now a smarter long-term move.While not yet a superstar, Lively has proven to be an elite pick-and-roll finisher, particularly with Luka Doncic . His strengths include:- Elite screening ability – Creates space for guards- Strong rim-running – Excels in transition and half-court sets- Efficient scoring – Shot 74.7% from the field last seasonDespite injuries limiting his playing time, Lively has been highly productive when on the court.Austin Reaves had a solid season but didn’t elevate his game enough in the playoffs to cement his place as a long-term Laker.With the team looking to build around LeBron James and potentially another star, moving Reaves for a young, athletic center like Lively could be a strategic play.Caudell adds:""Reaves is going to be due a massive contract extension soon and if the Lakers are building around Doncic and James, it might be best to deal him now for a young center.""If this deal goes through, the Los Angeles Lakers would:- Upgrade at center – Lively is a defensive anchor and elite lob threat- Maintain future flexibility – Keep draft assets for further moves- Improve bench depth – Terance Mann adds another reliable rotation pieceThe Los Angeles Lakers are clearly exploring ways to maximize their roster around LeBron James. Trading Austin Reaves for Dereck Lively II could be a bold but calculated move, giving them a young, high-upside center while keeping future options open.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors could sign $110 million Cleveland Cavaliers duo to bolster squad in blockbuster 3-way deal including the Miami Heat As the offseason unfolds, all eyes will be on whether this blockbuster trade materializes.","The Los Angeles Lakers could part ways with Austin Reaves in a multi-team deal to acquire Dereck Lively II.

Taylor Swift’s fairytale with Travis Kelce turns sour as NFL life kills the glam



When late-night glamour meets early morning training sessions

Romance under pressure: Love in the time of strict schedules





As Kansas City Chiefs star tight end Travis Kelce enters what could be the most critical—and possibly final—season of his NFL career, insiders reveal that his once fairytale romance with pop superstar Taylor Swift is beginning to encounter growing strain, as the stark contrast between Kelce’s rigid training schedule and Swift’s glamorous, fast-paced lifestyle creates subtle but mounting tension behind closed doors.According to Star Magazine, the couple—both 35—are entering a challenging new chapter in their relationship. Travis Kelce, still reeling from a devastating Super Bowl loss, has thrown himself into a punishing fitness schedule, complete with strict calorie tracking, early nights, and intense workouts. And while Taylor Swift has been supportive, even traveling to Florida recently for a quiet night out in West Palm Beach, sources say the pop icon is starting to feel the strain.“Everyone told her dating an athlete comes with sacrifices,” an insider reportedly told Star Magazine. “But she didn’t expect the lifestyle to be so rigid.”Taylor Swift, known for her electrifying performances and glamorous public appearances, is reportedly finding Kelce’s football-focused lifestyle less than thrilling. As one source put it, the idea of winding down by 9 p.m. clashes with the singer’s fast-paced, often nocturnal routine.“Going to bed by 9 p.m. doesn’t quite match the singer’s usual vibe,” the source added.This lifestyle shift comes just as Kelce is under immense pressure to redeem his team after last season’s disappointing finish. With training camp looming, his focus has turned almost entirely to the field. That drive for redemption has reportedly left little room for the kind of spontaneous fun the couple once enjoyed—whether that meant surprise date nights or jet-setting between concert stops.Though their relationship remains strong on the surface, close friends say Swift misses the spark of earlier days—those filled with concert cameos, hand-in-hand appearances on red carpets, and playful social media posts. Now, reality is setting in as they try to balance two high-octane careers that demand very different daily rhythms.Still, Taylor Swift continues to show up for Travis Kelce. Insiders describe her as “supportive but struggling,” trying to adapt to a lifestyle built around protein shakes and playbooks rather than champagne toasts and creative chaos.Also Read: “Looks like someone’s grandfather”: Travis Kelce’s bold new hairstyle at family wedding with Taylor Swift sets social media abuzz As training season intensifies, fans are left wondering: will love win out, or will the tension between spotlight sparkle and locker room discipline prove too much?Only time—and perhaps a few more late nights—will tell.","Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift are entering a challenging new chapter in their relationship.

Cam Skattebo's viral moment provokes criticism over NFL history blind spot



Does Cam Skattebo know ball? 🧠

A generation gap or something more?



by face





New York Giants first-year running back Cameron Skattebo became the focus of an unintended NFL tempest—nothing on the field, but for seemingly not knowing anything about the league's greatest legends. In one recent video making its rounds on the internet, Cameron Skattebo can't recognize NFL legends from their pictures, kicking off an emotional Reddit discussion in which fans toggle between anger and empathy.Cameron Skattebo, who played college football at Sacramento State Hornets and Arizona State Sun Devils before the New York Giants drafted him in the fourth round of the NFL Draft 2025, soon found himself a topic of conversation on Reddit—but not the kind related to his athleticism.In one clip of him now circulating, Cameron Skattebo misidentifies players during a quiz segment. When presented with a picture of Calvin Johnson, better known as ‘Megatron,’ confusion set in.Redditors were both amused and frustrated. One of the top comments stated, “Not knowing Calvin is wild, but an NFL player not knowing Brett Favre is crazy ffs.”Another commenter joked, “Banish him from the league for this,” and others reluctantly empathized, one of them noting, “To be fair, though, Calvin retired when Skattebo woulda been like 13 or 14, and he wasn’t a guy who was in many commercials or broadcast booths.So it’s not thaaaat crazy with all that in mind.”""They’re so disappointed they’re almost speechless by the end lol. The joy fully sucked out of the room,"" another user said.""Well we didn’t teach him memory skills at ASU I guess,"" a fan joked.""Tbf I haven’t seen most of these guys without a helmet on,"" another defended, ""I got Colston and Megatron though.""""This dude off my draft board,"" one Reddit user said to which another replied, ""I imagine Cam needs to watch it again too. Dude looked like he got concussed 4 times during it.""A fan tried to defend Skattebo's 'ignorance' by commenting: ""Calm down guys, memory is hard. I can't even remember the last time the Buffalo Bills won a superbowl.""""As a filthy casual with incredible face blindness I feel seen,"" another added.The discussion soon escalated beyond Cameron Skattebo, with wider questions about how younger players identify with the history of the league. One commenter wrote that most players don't grow up watching the NFL but rather center on their own development or college careers. “A lot of these guys don't even follow the NFL til they get to the league. Might have been a college fan, or just doesn't watch football,” another Redditor wrote.Even fans conceded trouble identifying helmet-wearing players by face alone. “Not really. I wouldn’t recognize Joe Montana from face alone probably. I definitely wouldn’t recognize megatron from face alone. I think people here are forgetting these dudes play in helmets lol. Outside of a handful of players there’s probably not many non-Eagles I could recognize,” admitted one commenter.""I mean, not knowing Golden Tate, Kam Chancellor, and Darren Sprolesis honestly understandable,"" one more added.""I was about to say. ESPECIALLY Golden Tate. I don't even understand how he is in this conversation,"" another replied.Nevertheless, the overall opinion was tilted towards incredulity, particularly in light of Johnson's place in NFL legend.While the NFL-Fan base in turn roasted and justified Cameron Skattebo's viral blunder, the moment highlighted something greater—the transience of fame, the changing tides of fandom across generations, and the way legacy players disappear from popular consciousness sooner than we want them to. Skattebo learned this lesson not offered in college: understanding the past can inform how you're perceived in the present.Also Read : Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce delight fans with synchronized dance at Tennessee wedding",New York Giants first-year running back Cameron Skattebo can't recognize NFL legends from their pictures.

NEW DELHI: Nicholas Pooran , one of West Indies’ most explosive and dependable white-ball cricketers of the modern era, announced his retirement from international cricket on Monday at the age of 29.The left-handed batter, who holds the record for most T20I runs and appearances for West Indies, confirmed the decision via an emotional Instagram post. Along with the post, he mentioned that it was very difficult, but he had thought long and hard before coming to this decision.“Wearing that maroon, standing for the anthem, and giving everything I had each time I stepped on the field... it's hard to put into words what that truly means to me,” Pooran wrote. “To have led the team as captain is a privilege I will always hold close to my heart.”Pooran’s career was marked by highs, including his rise to become the team’s all-time leading scorer in T20Is, as well as a few lows — notably his brief suspension in 2019 for ball-tampering against Afghanistan. He bounced back swiftly and went on to captain the team during Kieron Pollard ’s absence, leading West Indies to a 4-1 series victory over Australia.He was later named permanent white-ball captain in 2022, though he stepped down following a disappointing T20 World Cup exit in Australia.In 106 T20Is, Pooran amassed 2,275 runs at a strike rate that made him a constant threat. He also featured in 61 ODIs, scoring three centuries and representing West Indies in the 2019 World Cup.Cricket West Indies hailed him as a “game-changer” and thanked him for his “outstanding contributions” to the game and the team.","Nicholas Pooran retires from international cricket at the age of 29.

Poll Do you agree with Sanjay Manjrekar's view that Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli should not be treated as equals in Test cricket? Yes, they are in different leagues No, they should be compared Not sure It depends on the format

Gautam Gambhir sends stern message after Bengaluru tragedy





NEW DELHI: As Team India embarks on a new era in Test cricket without two of its biggest icons — Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma — former cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar has sparked a debate by urging the cricketing community to stop treating the duo as equals in the red-ball format.Reacting to new Test skipper Shubman Gill ’s remark that he will feel the pressure of not having Kohli and Rohit in the England series, Manjrekar took to Instagram to share a candid assessment.“It stirred up the bee in my bonnet, which has been there for a while. It's not so much about the statement, but the fact that Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli tend to get clubbed together,” he said.The former India batter asserted that while comparisons may be valid in white-ball cricket, Kohli and Rohit are in very different leagues in Test cricket. “We even have a term for them, RoKo. I can understand it in white-ball cricket… but when it comes to red-ball cricket, there’s absolutely no comparison between the two,” he added.Backing his stance with numbers, Manjrekar pointed to Kohli’s dominant record in SENA (South Africa, England, New Zealand, Australia) countries. “Virat Kohli has got 12 hundreds. Rohit Sharma in SENA countries — just the one, against England at The Oval in 2021.He's played over 100 innings and averages 40.”“And I dare say, had he gone to England, that average would have dropped into the 30s,” he said, before ending with a blunt punchline: “So, when it comes to red-ball cricket… I say, RoKo, stop that.”Manjrekar's comments have reignited discussions on India's red-ball legacy and the contrasting impact of two modern giants of Indian cricket.","Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are in very different leagues in Test cricket, says Sanjay Manjrekar.

'Daring, Dynamic, Different': Ponting hails PBKS young guns despite final loss

Poll Will Punjab Kings bounce back stronger and win the IPL next season? Definitely I don't think so





Punjab Kings fell short of the ultimate prize in the 18th edition of the Indian Premier League by the finest of margins. PBKS lost by six runs in the IPL final to Royal Challengers Bengaluru as Rajat Patidar's RCB claimed their first-ever crown. While Punjab, led by Shreyas Iyer were also in the quest for a maiden crown, it was their rivals that prevailed. Despite the heartbreak in the final, PBKS coach Ricky Ponting attracted praise for his managerial prowess and the relationship he formed with the members of his squad.The former Australian international and legend also showered praise on his side after the defeat in the final, and took pride in the fact that the team showcased something 'different' this year. In a recent clip posted on PBKS's official X handle, the coach takes out his 'funny' side in an interaction with co-owner and Bollywood star Preity Zinta . The latter was urged to do something never seen before by the coach in response to a question regarding his alternating demeanour while representing the franchise.""How does somebody be so aggressive on the ground and as a person, but be so calm and chilled out?"", asked Zinta as she expressed her curiosity on the 50-year-old's behavior on the pitch. The former Australia skipper is know for wearing his heart on his sleeve, but also for his polite and kind nature off of it.Chuckling in response, the coach made a hilarious offer to the co-owner to debunk her assumption. ""You need to come and sit next to me in the dugout sometimes because you will see that it's not always calm. Look, I'm an aggressive natured person, especially when it's cricket time.""Ponting made headlines for his trust on skipper Shreyas Iyer, who was not retained by Kolkata Knight Riders in 2025, but was made PBKS skipper and ultimately led the franchise to their first final since 2014. Ponting then clarified that he very jolly and cheerful outside of cricket and will have a laugh with anyone regardless. However, he stressed that when it comes to his duty, he makes zero compromises.""I'll have a laugh and a joke and a coffee and a sit down with anyone and talk about anything outside of cricket time. But when it's cricket time, it's my job to bring high performance to this team. And so I'm not gonna waste a minute, I'm not gonna waste a day, I'm not gonna waste a training session where I'm not trying to be the best coach that I can be and make every single player that's playing with me the best player that they can be,"" said an earnest Ponting.The PBKS coach also assured that his side will bounce back stronger next year.","Punjab Kings lost by six runs to Royal Challengers Bengaluru in IPL final.

Cleveland Cavaliers ’ Darius Garland faces extended recovery after toe surgery





The Cavaliers’ chances of making the playoffs look dimmer now that Darius Garland will be out for a long time. Because of the painful injury to his left great toe in the playoffs, Garland was operated on June 9, 2025, and is expected to be out for about four to five months. Since he is not expected to be ready before September, his absence may influence both the squad’s guard unit and how the Cavaliers operate during the offseason.Cleveland Cavaliers point guard Darius Garland, who is 25 years old, had successful surgery to fix a left great toe injury that affected his play during the 2025 NBA playoffs. The operation was carried out by Dr. Nicholas Strasser at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, with input from Cavaliers team doctor Dr. James Rosneck and Dr. Bob Anderson from OrthoCarolina. The Cavaliers shared that Garland should be back to basketball activities by the beginning of training camp in late September.Garland got hurt on March 23, 2025, and even though he dealt with it during the regular season, he ended up missing four playoff games. He came back for Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Indiana Pacers but had a tough time, averaging only 14 points with a shooting percentage of 34.2% in the last three games.The front office of the Cavaliers is now dealing with some key decisions about roster building and possible trades. With Garland's recovery timeline still up in the air, the team might need to check out options to enhance the backcourt. Moreover, Garland's injury could sway the Cavaliers' strategy regarding free agent guard Ty Jerome, who recently enjoyed the best season of his NBA career.As the Cavaliers deal with these hurdles, everyone will be keeping an eye on how much Garland's absence affects them. His leadership and scoring skills played a huge role in the team's success throughout the regular season, and how quickly he recovers will be crucial for the Cavaliers' chances in the next season.Also Read: Jrue Holiday's $32.4M cap hit makes him prime trade candidate for cost-cutting Boston Celtics Darius Garland not being able to play due to surgery is a big disadvantage for the Cleveland Cavaliers as they approach the new season.Even though the team is optimistic about having him during training camp, not knowing for sure leaves the Cavaliers with a challenge during the offseason.In the following months, it will matter a lot how Garland is doing and how the team will move forward while he is absent.",Cleveland Cavaliers point guard Darius Garland had successful surgery to fix a left great toe injury that affected his play during the 2025 NBA playoffs.

A life-sized statue of cricket legend Wasim Akram , unveiled in April at Hyderabad's Niaz Stadium in Pakistan , has drawn widespread social media attention after a handle on X shared its photo, with fans expressing amusement over its unflattering appearance despite attempts to honour the fast-bowling great.The statue depicts Akram in Pakistan's 1999 World Cup jersey, capturing his signature slingy bowling action. While the sculptor accurately portrayed his body dimensions and structure, the facial features appeared distorted, with his concentrated expression appearing more like a frown and his hair making him look older than intended.""Does Wasim Akram know that it's him?"" asked one social media user.""Made with 10% cement, 90% disappointment 😂,"" tweeted another.The reaction mirrors similar criticism faced when Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium unveiled Sachin Tendulkar's statue, which fans thought resembled Australian cricketer Steve Smith instead.Akram's illustrious cricket career spanned from 1984 to 2003, during which he played 104 Test matches and 356 One Day Internationals. He claimed 414 Test wickets at an average of 23.62 and became the first bowler to reach 500 ODI wickets, finishing with 502 at an average of 23.52.The cricket icon demonstrated his batting prowess by scoring over 6,000 runs across formats, with an unbeaten 257 as his highest Test score. He was also part of Pakistan's victorious 1992 World Cup team and participated in four World Cups overall.Akram's role as a leader included captaining his country in 25 Tests and 109 ODIs. His post-playing career has been equally notable, having served as a coach in the IPL, domestic cricket, and briefly with the Pakistan national team. Currently, he contributes to cricket through commentary and broadcast work across various competitions.","A life-sized statue of cricket legend Wasim Akram was unveiled in April at Hyderabad's Niaz Stadium in Pakistan.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep. 6: Harish Thawani on cricket's TV market and the watershed moments





There was talk from Day 1, but Sunday night was the perfect catalyst for the tennis world to go into a tizzy. At 22, Rafael Nadal had won five Grand Slam titles and when Carlos Alcaraz did the same by outlasting Jannik Sinner at Rafa's ‘home' Roland Garros, the comparison calls became louder.""It is a stat that I am going to keep for me forever, winning the fifth Grand Slam at the same time as Rafa – my idol, my inspiration. It's a huge honour,"" Alcaraz said after the five-and-a-half-hour epic.Both are Spaniards, both share a never-say-die attitude, both are die-hard Real Madrid fans. The surface similarities between the two are many. So much so that the Rafa loyalist over a decade and a half feels Alcaraz is a natural heir to his throne of the heart.But is it that simple? Are Nadal and Alcaraz cut out of the same cloth? The answer is probably ‘no'.Nadal came at a time when the world was in awe of the jaw-dropping beauty of Roger Federer . The victories were becoming routine when this Spanish matador rocked the citadel of tennis with incredible ability to endure. Federer, who had grown up on Swiss clay and believed till 2005 that it was a matter of time before he won the French, suddenly didn't know how to get past his young nemesis on the red clay of Paris.It was a riddle that Federer never solved — he beat Rafa on other surfaces, but never at Roland Garros.Nadal won 14 French Open titles — a record that is unlikely to be broken — and it had a lot to do with the different facets of his game that he went on adding to his basic repertoire of being an unbelievable retriever. But to start off, the myth of Rafa began as a counterpoint to the elegance of Federer.That's a fundamental difference between Alcaraz and Nadal. The Murica boy appeared on the big stage almost as a saviour in early 2022 when Federer was all but gone, Nadal was in a decline and Novak Djokovic was the untouchable master. Tennis was getting slightly unidimensional, and it needed the gold dust of artistry to keep it enticing for the consumer pampered by the Swiss-Spanish royalty for close to two decades.""The basic difference between Nadal and Alcaraz is that the latter is as good on any surface as he is on clay. His first Slam came on the hard courts of the US Open. He conquered grass when nobody expected him to do so, and now he is a two-time French Open champion. On the other hand, Rafa's first four Grand Slam titles were all at Roland Garros, till the 2008 Wimbledon final happened,"" Indian legend Ramesh Krishnan told TOI.While Nadal became an extremely reliable volleyer and kept on adding new shots and facets to his game, the 22-Slam winner's core strength was his ability to defend on slightly slower surfaces. Alcaraz, on the other hand, even as a teenager, was a combination of attack and defence – his ability to play outrageous winners has been the cornerstone of some of his best moments so far. Be it his drop shot down 0-30 serving for the match against Novak Djokovic in 2023 Wimbledon final or his ability to pull winners out of his bag in the final set tiebreak on Sunday, Alcaraz was more Federer than Nadal for the tennis tragic.The biggest compliment for Alcaraz probably came from the other master Djokovic, who feels that he hasn't ""played a player like him"" after the 2023 Wimbledon final loss. ""Roger and Rafa had their own strengths and weaknesses, but Carlos is an amazing player. I would say his game has the best of all three of us.""That probably sums up Alcaraz's game. And when John McEnroe said on Sunday that ""these guys (Alcaraz and Sinner) would beat Roger and Rafa in their prime"", you're left with the dilemma: ""Who would you pay to watch? Nadal or Alcaraz?Krishnan smiled at the query. ""I will probably pay to watch both.""","Carlos Alcaraz beat Jannik Sinner to win the French Open at Roland Garros. At 22, Rafael Nadal had won five Grand Slam titles. Nadal's first 4 Slam wins came in Paris.

Who’s the real head coach here?

UNC fans are blasting the program for letting Jordon Hudson operate behind the scenes



“A coach who is clearly being run by a woman who is young enough to be his granddaughter … makes UNC look foolish.”

Even though she's not on the payroll, Hudson’s involvement feels a little too official







UNC brought in NFL legend Bill Belichick hoping for order, structure, and maybe even a little magic. What they didn’t expect? A flood of alumni emails claiming his 24-year-old girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, is calling shots off the books. From helping out at practice to reportedly handling interviews, Hudson’s involvement has left Tar Heel supporters wondering:It didn’t take long for UNC diehards to start raising red flags. According to reports, the university has received multiple complaints from concerned supporters who think Hudson is far too involved for someone who isn’t on staff.One longtime fan didn’t hold back, telling the university president directly:Yikes. That line alone lit a fire online, with some fans worried this relationship could turn UNC football into a circus sideshow.UNC reportedly reminded Hudson she has no official role with the team but the issue is, no one’s buying that anymore. She’s been seen helping coordinate media duties, attending practices, and even participating in team activities.Belichick insists she’s not employed by the school. But critics argue: If she’s organizing interviews and hanging around team functions, what do titles even matter? It’s not about paperwork, it’s about influence.And fans think she’s got way too much of it.Belichick is a football icon, no doubt. But this isn’t New England anymore. Some fans say his current situation makes the program look more like reality TV than a disciplined team. And they’re not just blaming Hudson, they’re blaming Belichick for letting it happen.Here’s where things get even messier: Belichick’s contract reportedly includes a $1 million buyout, pocket change for someone of his stature. If UNC applies too much pressure, could he just walk?Supporters are asking tough questions. Is the school tiptoeing around the relationship to keep Belichick happy? Is the coach subtly flexing his power by involving Hudson, knowing no one wants to lose him?Whether this cools down or blows up even further depends on how UNC responds and whether Belichick adjusts his setup. For now, fans are watching every move. Because when your Hall of Fame head coach is trending for off-field drama before even winning a game, the clock starts ticking fast.Also read - Is Dua Lipa the next Super Bowl halftime star?

Indianapolis Colts keep ownership in the Irsay Family as Carlie Irsay-Gordon, Casey Foyt, and Kalen Jackson step into power

Carlie Irsay-Gordon takes charge as Indianapolis Colts begin new era under Irsay Sisters ’ leadership





A familiar face is officially taking the reins in Indianapolis. After the passing of longtime Colts owner Jim Irsay on May 21, the franchise announced that Carlie Irsay-Gordon will now serve as team owner and CEO. The move isn’t a surprise—Carlie has been involved with the Colts for years—but it marks a major moment for the organization. Her sisters, Casey Foyt and Kalen Jackson, are also stepping into expanded roles as the next generation of Irsay leadership begins. Carlie Irsay-Gordon has been around the Colts her entire life, and for the last 16 years, she’s been helping run the show behind the scenes. She started as a vice president in 2008 and has been a steady presence ever since, not just within the team, but across the NFL. She's part of several league committees—covering everything from media operations to fan conduct and long-term investments.Now, she’s taking over the top job. The Colts made it official Monday: Carlie is the new team owner and CEO. And she’s not leading alone. Her sisters are right there with her—Casey Foyt will serve as executive vice president, while Kalen Jackson becomes chief brand officer and keeps her role as president of the Colts Foundation.The team noted that the new structure follows “longstanding plans set forth by Jim Irsay.” That track—Jim had made it clear over the years that his daughters would one day take over.Jim Irsay, who was 65, led the franchise for nearly three decades. He became principal owner in 1997 after the death of his father, Robert Irsay, and helped turn the Colts into a consistent contender. Under his watch, the team won 16 playoff games, captured two AFC titles, and brought home a Super Bowl.This isn’t a total reset for the Colts. The Irsay sisters have been in the building, shaping decisions and building community programs for more than a decade. Now, the titles are just catching up to the work they’ve already been doing.With Carlie Irsay-Gordon officially in charge, the Colts are staying in the family—and moving forward.Also Read: Houston Texans CB Ronald Darby announces surprise retirement after 10 NFL seasons","Carlie Irsay-Gordon is the new team owner and CEO of the Indianapolis Colts.

Gunther has become a two-time World Heavyweight Champion







Gunther has once again reached the top of the mountain in WWE The fight field was set for a huge collision on this week's edition of Monday Night RAW. Weeks ago, Gunther had announced that he would challenge for the World Heavyweight Championship on the June 9th edition of RAW in Phoenix, Arizona. The night had come and his opponent was none other than the man who dethroned him at WrestleMania 41 for the title, Main Event Jey Uso . Following an explosive rematch between the duo, it was The Ring General who shocked the world with a huge title win.Jey Uso walked into the match less than 100%. He had been a part of a huge tag team match at last weekend's Money in the Bank Premium Live Event, where he and Cody Rhodes had defeated John Cena and Logan Paul. With momentum on his side, The YEET man was ready for the high-stakes title showdown; however, standing in his way was the dominant Gunther, who wanted to reclaim the title he lost at WrestleMania 41.As soon as the bell rang, both men went up against each other, trading blows and power-packed moves. Gunther tried to establish dominance, but Uso had the heart, the support of the fans, and most importantly, his son, watching at ringside.The champion came back each time to combat the fury of The Ring General. Moreover, this led to loud cheers from the WWE Universe who were enthralled with the action in front of them at the PHX Arena.As the title match came down to its final moments, Uso delivered a spear and looked to follow it up with a Uso splash. However, Gunther put him in the sleeper hold submission. The leader of the YEET movement tried to reverse it, but Gunther had the grip much tighter. After holding for a long time, Uso passed out, and the match was over.The dust settled, and Gunther was the new World Heavyweight Champion, which was a huge shocker. With The Ring General back on top, he now begins his second reign of dominance as the title holder.Also read: WWE RAW Results & Highlights (6/9/25): Gunther reclaims World title, John Cena's next opponent revealed and more

Bryce Harper’s injury leaves Phillies struggling for wins

Phillies trade deadline looms as Phillies search for needed help





The Philadelphia Phillies have hit a rough patch in early June. On Friday, June 7, 2025, they lost 5–4 to the Pittsburgh Pirates at PNC Park in a game that ended with a walk-off sac fly by Nick Gonzales . This loss marked their third straight defeat and now they are 1–7 in their last eight games. Adding to their worries, Bryce Harper has been placed on the 10-day injured list with right wrist inflammation as of June 7, 2025 . With the NL East race slipping away, Phillies fans are watching the trade deadline closely.On Saturday, June 7, 2025, the Phillies made room on their roster by placing Bryce Harper on the 10-day IL, effective the same day . Harper, a two-time NL MVP, has been battling wrist pain since he was hit by a pitch from Braves pitcher Spencer Strider on May 27. His bat cooled—he went 1-for-11 after returning from elbow trouble . Before his injury, Harper was batting .258 with nine home runs and 34 RBIs in 57 games.In response, the team called up top prospect Otto Kemp from Triple-A Lehigh Valley. Kemp brings a .317 average, 14 homers, and a 1.018 OPS in the minors .They also added pitcher Daniel Robert, while sending Alan Rangel back down.The Phillies have lost seven of their last eight, dropping from first to second in the NL East . Their fall left them 2½ games behind the New York Mets, weakening their hold on the division lead .Also Read: Bryce Harper Hits Injured List With Wrist Inflammation As Phillies Enter Panic Mode The absence of Bryce Harper puts extra pressure on the Phillies to act before the trade deadline on July 30. Their offense lacks its usual power and timing, and pitching struggles continue to worsen . Harper’s injury and slump match a broader trend of poor performance from the offense and bullpen .During Friday’s loss, Phillies starter Bailey Falter lasted just 3⅔ innings, giving up four runs . Meanwhile, Trea Turner was a bright spot, with three hits and two RBIs, but he couldn’t offset the overall lack of production .Fans are talking online about the urgency. Some suggest the front office may need to bring in a power bat or pitching depth to hold the division spot. General Manager Dave Dombrowski hasn’t made a big move yet, but whispers are growing louder.With Harper sidelined, the clock is ticking. The Phillies’ path forward will likely be shaped by what they do before the trade deadline and whether they can fill the gap left by their star first baseman.","The Philadelphia Phillies lost 5–4 to the Pittsburgh Pirates on Friday, June 7, 2025.

Should the Toronto Maple Leafs pursue divisive veteran Brad Marchand in free agency



THE TRADE THAT KEEPS ON GIVING 👏 Discussing Brad Marchand’s impact in the Stanley Cup Final | SC

What would Brad Marchand bring to Toronto Maple Leafs



176 playoff games

155 points (63G, 92A)

2011 Stanley Cup champion

Ultimate verdict: Calculated aggression or costly sentiment?







The Toronto Maple Leafs have endured Brad Marchand's frustrating exploits for more than a decade. Brad Marchand, along with his unparalleled capacity to incense his foes, has been Toronto's playoff demon, sending the Leafs packing five times—most recently in a comprehensively won 6–1 Game 7 against the Florida Panthers. Now, with the divisive veteran set to hit unrestricted free agency, GM Brad Treliving has a tempting dilemma: Should the Leafs go get Brad Marchand at long last—or leave him alone?Now 37, Brad Marchand continues to show why he's one of the game's most consistent stars. He had 23 goals and 28 assists in 71 games with the Boston Bruins and Florida Panthers this season, and has once more dialed it up during the playoffs with 17 points (7G, 10A) in 19 games going into the Stanley Cup Final.But scoring is just half the story. Following the victory, Brad Marchand was surprised by showing a facet: he was raised a Leafs supporter.If Leafs management is serious about altering the team's playoff DNA, Brad Marchand is the guy. He's clutch, disruptive, and battle-hardened—exactly what a Leafs core that has underperformed when it needed to show up most lacks.His playoff resume is among the best:Toronto has about $25.7 million of estimated cap space coming into the offseason.With John Tavares' $11 million deal expiring after next season and Mitch Marner's $10.9 million perhaps being off the books, the Leafs are in a great position to make moves.A reasonable goal for Marchand might be $7.5 to $8 million AAV—a substantial price for a player on the back end of his career. The Leafs took the same risk on Patrick Marleau, only to trade him and a first-round pick just to get rid of his $6.25 million cap hit.If the Leafs are in “win-now or never” mode, Marchand makes sense. He’d bring swagger, experience, and playoff credibility to a team that’s long lacked it. But anything more than two years or $7.5 million AAV could backfire, especially if his production dips.Also read: Brad Marchand’s playoff dominance sparks free agency buzz as Panthers push for Stanley Cup glory Toronto needs to stand strong against sentiment and nostalgia, no matter if Marchand grew up a Leafs supporter.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep. 6: Harish Thawani on cricket's TV market and the watershed moments





Juan Carlos Ferrero walked the edge with Carlos Alcaraz in the French Open final. After three hours and 43 minutes of play, facing three match points, the 45-year-old felt the moment as did the full house on Court Philippe Chatrier.At 3-5, 0-40 in the fourth set a veil of silence descended on the arena as Alcaraz was getting ready to serve. The 22-year-old looked at Ferrero, his long-time coach. “It was like he was saying, I’m still here,” Ferrero said, “I’m not saying that I believed he would recover from 3-5, love-40, but with Carlos everything is possible.”The word Ferrero was looking for was ‘attitude’, which when translated to body language spelt ‘vamos’.Not long after Ferrero had exited the media room, the world No. 2 — who had scripted that awe-inspiring 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (10-2) win over the world No. 1 Jannik Sinner to claim his fifth Grand Slam title — was asked if he believed he was in the match when staring down the barrel.“Absolutely,” Alcaraz said. “The match was not finished, it’s one point from losing the match. A lot of times people come back from match point down in the final of Grand Slams.I wanted to be one of those players, who saved match points in a Grand Slam final and ended up winning.”Some of Alcaraz’s winners in the business end of the fifth set as he attempted to put the finishing touches to one of the greatest fightbacks in the sport were electric, it charged the crowd, and defined the exchange. The Spaniard had 70 in the match.The first Grand Slam men’s championship match between two players born in the 2000s made history, turning into the longest Roland Garros final on record at five hours and 29 minutes, the second longest of Major finals after the 2012 Australian Open that lasted five-hours and 53-minutes.Alcaraz had the spectators — nearly 15,000-strong on Chatrier, including celebrities from the entertainment industry and the world of sport, young fans and seasoned spectators — gasping, thumping their palms and jumping up on their feet and screaming ‘Carlitos, Carlitos, Carlitos’. The chant is fast becoming a crowd favourite wherever he plays.The Spaniard, who won his first Major crown at the 2022 US Open as a 19-year-old, has now won at least one Slam in four consecutive seasons.The world No. 2, who was propelled into the contest by the energy of the crowd in the early part of the match when Sinner looked to be running away with it, thanked fans by playing his best tennis on the home stretch, the 12th game of the fifth set and the match tie-break. He pulled off winners from impossible positions, finding angles where most players would only see lines.“I had to go for it no matter what, no matter if I was down, no matter if it was the super tiebreak,” Alcaraz said of his decision to accelerate, which was exactly what the Italian failed to do when he had the match points. “I thought it was time to go for it, not be afraid of mistakes. That’s why I (played) my best tennis in crucial moments, at 6-5 in the fifth. I still don’t know how I did it. I still don’t know how I saved that game. ”At 22 years and 34 days old, Alcaraz became the third-youngest man to win five Grand Slam titles in history. He trails Bjorn Borg (22 years, 5 days) and Rafael Nadal (22 years, 33 days).“The coincidence of winning my fifth Grand Slam in the same age as Rafa Nadal, I’m going to say that’s destiny,” Alcaraz said. “It is a stat I’m going to keep with me forever, winning the fifth Grand Slam at the same time as Rafa, my idol, my inspiration is a huge honour.”Alcaraz, who became the ninth man in the Open Era to come from two sets down in a Major final, has rallied twice before from difficult situations in Grand Slam finals.“I prefer to win in three sets,” the champion said smiling. “But when the situation is against you, you have to keep fighting. It is a Grand Slam final, it’s no time to be tired, it’s no time to give up. The real champions are made in those situations when you deal with that pressure.”Alcaraz should know.",Carlos Alcaraz beat world No. 1 Jannik Sinner in five sets to win the French Open. The Spaniard saved three match points in the final set. The match was the longest Roland Garros final on record at five hours and 29 minutes.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121742453,imgsize-26714,width-400,resizemode-4/121742453.jpg"

DeMarcus Cousins loses cool post-ejection as hostile Puerto Rico fans push tensions to the edge







Former Sacramento Kings superstar DeMarcus Cousins, now playing for Guaynabo in Puerto Rico’s Baloncesto Superior Nacional, made headlines again. During a heated game on Monday night, Cousins found himself at the center of an ugly scene that spiraled from a routine ejection into a near-chaotic confrontation with fans. A viral video capturing the entire incident has sparked debate across the basketball world, raising serious questions about player-fan boundaries and emotional control.DeMarcus Cousins’ emotional outburst overshadows Puerto Rico league performance. He was once considered among the NBA’s most dominant centers. Cousins now averages an impressive 19 points and 9 rebounds for the Guaynabo Mets. However, his game was abruptly overshadowed by controversy when a courtside altercation escalated quickly.After a round of trash talk from a fan seated near the court, Cousins lost his temper and had to be restrained. What followed was a dramatic ejection that left the arena buzzing and social media in flames.As Cousins was escorted off the court, fans began hurling food and drinks in his direction. The 34-year-old reacted by flexing, gesturing angrily, and flipping off a fan before trying to charge into the stands. Security and team staff intervened just in time to prevent a full-blown brawl.Per several reports, the staff members who restrained Cousins played a crucial role in preventing it from escalating further.While Cousins has a long-standing reputation for being fiery and emotional, this latest incident pushes the conversation beyond player temperament and into fan accountability.Cousins’ NBA journey included stints with the Kings, Pelicans, Warriors, Rockets, Clippers, Bucks, and Nuggets before his last season in 2022. Though no longer under the bright lights of the NBA, his passion for the game can be seen in his ventures beyond the NBA, of course, with added intensity that occasionally boils over.Also Read: “I just fainted” – Overwhelmed OKC Thunder fans stunned by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s hot summer look as he flies to Indiana for Game 3 Fortunately, the confrontation did not turn into another Malice at the Palace, though the parallels were hard to ignore.
