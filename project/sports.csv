Travis Kelce Puts an End to the Argument: Andy Reid is the Greatest Coach in NFL History



“[Andy Reid is] the greatest to ever do it. The wins are there. The Super Bowls are there. Everywhere he’s gone, he’s won, and he’s done it in a way that’s so much respected by everybody that plays for him,”

“It’s a unique blend of being able to be relatable to everybody, no matter how old he gets and how young these players are getting in the league. He always has the ability to relate to guys, and that’s big in the football world,”

An interview with Travis Kelce, Drake suing his own label

Reid's Legacy: Numbers Don't Lie



273 regular-season wins

26 playoff victories

11 appearances in the playoffs

12 seasons with Kansas City.

Six consecutive AFC Championship games

Four Super Bowl appearances in five seasons, three championships.

What Makes Reid Different?



“He’s tough, and he shows his toughness every single day. I never see his truck leave this parking lot. This guy loves being accountable and loves coming in and being his best for this organization and this city,”

Conclusion: Reid Over Belichick?



“The wins are there. The Super Bowls are there.

The debate of the NFL's greatest head coach is one of those endless sports conversations that might divide even the most loyal fanbases. Could it be the architect of the New England Patriots and six Super Bowl rings, Bill Belichick , or the one behind Kansas City's modern domination of football as Andy Reid is? Recently while appearing on The Stephen A.Smith Show , Kelce confidently threw in his support towards ""this"" coach. Let's read ahead to know who:.Appearing on The Stephen A. Smith Show, Travis Kelce made a bombshell statement. In one fell swoop, he declared Andy Reid the greatest coach in NFL history.Kelce said, confidently silencing any doubts.This is not without merit. Reid's resume is replete with accolades: three Super Bowl championships, playoff appearances nearly annually, and an organizational culture steeped in class and success. As Kelce noted, no one, regardless of age or background, ever seems to fall out of favor with Reid, as they do so frequently in this league.Kelce added.It's one thing is to shower praise on the personality and the leadership style of a coach but Reid's statistics support every aspect of Kelce's endorsement. Over his several decades of being in the field, Reid established himself as one of the most consistent and innovative minds in the NFL.and, placing him fourth in all-time standings.out of(2018–2023).He has also molded the Chiefs into a perennial powerhouse with an offense, led by the face of the NFL today in Patrick Mahomes. His adjustment to new challenges while remaining faithful to his football philosophy puts him among the all-time greats.It's the wins and the rings, however, that only set Andy Reid apart. And for Kelce, it was the relentless hard work and dedicated attitude toward his players.Kelce said.In contrast, Bill Belichick has been inextricably linked with Tom Brady and the Patriots dynasty. Sure, Belichick won six Super Bowls, but can it be said that his success was based upon Brady's greatness? Reid has tended to repeat his successes across the franchises to which he has clung, testifying to his flexibility and strategic brilliance.Travis Kelce’s unapologetic praise for Andy Reid might ruffle some feathers, especially among New England fans. But his reasoning is hard to ignore. Reid’s unique combination of tactical brilliance, adaptability, and personal connection with his players makes him a coach like no other.Whether you’re Team Belichick or Team Reid, one thing’s for sure: if Reid continues to add to his already legendary resume, the GOAT debate might soon have a clear winner. As Kelce said,” Reid’s legacy, much like his Chiefs, isn’t slowing down anytime soon.Also read - This Sports Journalist Spent $20,000 on Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour Tickets Expecting It to Be Good—See What Happened Next!","Travis Kelce said Andy Reid is the greatest coach in NFL history.

James reacted to a post highlighting that the Ball Brothers have earned a combined $296 million throughout their careers. LeBron James put the post on his Instagram story and used the raise arms emoji to praise LiAngelo, LaMelo, and Lonzo’s amazing achievement.It is worth noting that LeBron James' NBA Career earnings alone stand at $528,695,302. Close to double of what the Ball Brothers have achieved for themselves over their relatively young careers. This figure mainly consists of the career earnings of NBA stars Lonzo and LaMelo. The eldest brother, Lonzo Ball signed a $80 million contract back in 2021. LaMelo Ball who is the Charlotte Hornets’ best player signed a $203.8 million deal with the team back in July 2023.Last but not least, LiAngelo Ball’s recent hip-hop hit “Tweaker” has earned him a $13 million deal with recording label, Def Jam. This was a much-needed win for LiAngelo who has been a little unfortunate in comparison to his brothers. Lonzo and LaMelo have made a name for themselves in the NBA with LaMelo Ball being one of the most exciting prospects in the league. LiAngelo was supposed to be in the league with them but could never make it work.LiAngelo signed three separate contracts with two different NBA teams. He first inked an Exhibit 10 contract with the Detroit Pistons on December 2, 2020. But, was waived by them just 12 days later on December 14, 2020. Ball was able to land himself another contract with the Charlotte Hornets on October 14, 2021. Unfortunately, he was waived just a day later on October 15, 2021. LiAngelo Ball got another opportunity with the Hornets on September 26, 2022. But, the Hornets decided to waive him once again on October 15, 2022. Following this, Ball spent some time in the G-League but failed to land himself an NBA contract. Then Ball did a brief stint in a Mexican league, but it seems like music was his true calling. With any luck, Tweaker will be the first of many hits that LiAngelo Ball puts out this year.ALSO READ: Lamelo Ball's Brother, LiAngelo Ball, Signs Massive $8 Million Deal With Def Jam LiAngelo Ball’s deal with Def Jam also allows him to retain all the rights to his music and record label. LaVar Ball was ridiculed for saying that all three of his sons would be superstars in the future. LeBron James’ reaction to the astonishing achievements of his sons will surely be enough to silence all who doubted him.What are your thoughts on the massive wealth that the Ball Brothers, Lonzo, LiAngelo, and LaMelo have amassed for themselves?

Sydney Cricket Ground is love at first sight: SCG museum, walk of fame and all the facilities

NEW DELHI: Jasprit Bumrah has been advised bed rest at home and the future course of action will be finalised only after swelling in his back subsides. The seamer reached home last week after a long tour of Australia and the current situation doesn't look very encouraging.It is reliably understood that while Bumrah will have to report to the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Bengaluru, there is no date of his check-in yet.""Bumrah could go to the CoE next week but right now there is no fixed date yet. He has been advised bed rest at home to help the muscles recover and the swelling to subside. Once that is done, future course of action will be ascertained,"" said a well-placed source.The initial word is that it's just swelling in the back and Bumrah will not be rushed back to cricket at this stage. With his history of back issues, the last thing stakeholders want is aggravating it. There is no clarity on his exact diagnosis yet but if it's something severe than just swelling, return could take longer.""Bed rest doesn't sound good. I hope it's not a disc bulge or a muscle swelling which is of a higher grade. The approach has to be similar with him - wrap him in cotton wool and preserve the talent like him,"" added the source.Former Team India strength and conditioning coach Ramji Srinivasan feels the exact time of rest and recovery can only be ascertained after a thorough diagnosis. He further explained that it depends whether the swelling is in the muscle or on disc.""Swelling happens if there is a tear because of edema formation - which depends on the grade of tear in the muscle. If it's a disc bulge or swelling then recovery also depends on grade, individual capacity, medical intervention and post medical rehab work,"" says Srinivasan.The stakeholders would hope that it remains swelling in the back because a disc bulge could delay his return to professional cricket. There is a long season ahead with the Champions Trophy, IPL and India's tour of England and Bumrah needs to carefully manage his recovery and return.There are still few days left before India pick their provisional squad for the Champions Trophy and it now remains to be seen whether the selectors include him in the list of 15. They are allowed to make changes until February 13 and are understood to be waiting for the final report from the medical team before taking the crucial Bumrah call.","Jasprit Bumrah has been advised bed rest at home and the future course of action will be finalised only after swelling in his back subsides.

NEW DELHI: A couple of days before the national selectors meet to pick the ODI team for the three-match series against England and the ICC Champions Trophy , the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) is planning to probe why Sanju Samson did not participate in the Vijay Hazare Trophy.BCCI top brass and selectors are not happy with Samson's decision to skip the event since they have tried to ensure domestic cricket remains relevant, TOI has learnt.The Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) didn't pick the wicketkeeper after Samson expressed his unavailability for a preparatory camp ahead of the tournament. KCA secretary Vinod S Kumar had stated that the association didn't want a youngster to lose his place due to the uncertainty over Samson's availability.BCCI sources say the matter needs to be discussed before the selectors get down to picking the Champions Trophy squad on Jan 19.""The selectors and the board have been very clear on the importance of domestic cricket. Last year, Ishan Kishan and Shreyas Iyer lost central contracts for missing domestic matches without seeking permission. Even in Samson's case, the board and selectors were not given any reason why he missed the tournament. All that is known so far is that he spends much of his time in Dubai,"" BCCI sources said.Samson has been picked for the T20I series at home against England starting next week. However, since the Vijay Hazare Trophy is played in a 50-over format, it becomes a crucial tournament going into the Champions Trophy.""The selectors would want a valid reason. Otherwise, it will be difficult to consider him for the ODI season. Samson has had a bitter history with the KCA, but that needs to be sorted out for him to play in domestic cricket. It can't be that the state association and him have a misunderstanding, and he misses out on game time. He did play in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy preceding the Vijay Hazare Trophy,"" the source said.Samson is considered to be contender for one of the two wicketkeepers' spots along with Rishabh Pant KL Rahul and Dhruv Jurel. There is uncertainty over Rahul's willingness to keep wickets in longer formats since he has endured major hamstring injuries in the past two years.It will be interesting to see how the selectors balance the squad if Rahul is unavailable to keep wickets.",BCCI top brass and selectors are not happy with Samson's decision to skip the event.

Fans Have Called Out Sam Heughan For His “Disrespectful” Behaviour Towards Taylor Swift



Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce continue to be one of the most popular couples in the world currently. While everyone is a fan of their love for each other, it seems like famous Hollywood actor Sam Heughan thought differently. Sam Heughan recently appeared on the famous The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon and spoke about his viral video where he believed Taylor might break up with Travis and fall in love with him instead, while he was in his costume for the famous drama series Outlander.Back in June 2024, when the billionaire global pop star, Taylor Swift was in Scotland as part of her Eras Tour, Sam Heughan had made a video on Instagram where he is seen in his costume for the hot series Outlander.In the video he says, “We are gonna go see Taylor Swift play in Scotland and I think most of the cast is going. She obviously doesnt know this but when she comes to Scotland and she sees me in the audience, she’s gonna forget all about….him.As he references Taylor’s boyfriend, Travis Kelce in his video, he continues to add, “And fall for a man in a ginger wig. How could she resist? You know, she’s gonna shake him off and take me out instead. Im really excited”In the segment posted by The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon on X, Fallon first asks Sam about his experience at the Eras Tour that happened in Scotland back in June 2024. Sam said he had an incredible experience at the Eras Tour, more so because not a lot of “big artists” come to Scotland, as most prefer to go to London or other neighbouring big cities. Fallon then shows him the video that he had posted on his Instagram as the audience gasps.Sam and Fallon laugh it off as they start talking about how Sam’s exceptional experience at the Eras Tour and how he had received a lot of friendship bracelets from Taylor’s fans at the show.While Sam might have laughed it off since he was joking when he made that video on his Instagram account, people have not taken it lightly. A fan took to X and wrote, “This is creepy and ridiculous”, another fan shared the same sentiment and wrote, “i wouldn’t play around with this knowing that her boyfriend is a 2 meters football player 😅”However, neither Sam nor Taylor have made any statements about this controversy yet.

NEW DELHI: Former Team India all-rounder Yuvraj Singh backed Indian head coach Gautam Gambhir and skipper Rohit Sharma 's leadership skills, despite recent setbacks.Yuvraj expressed his support on Thursday for Rohit's captaincy, emphasising the need to evaluate his overall performance rather than focusing solely on recent series losses.The left-handed batter highlighted Rohit's achievements, including leading India to victories in the T20 World Cup and guiding Mumbai Indians to five IPL titles .""Gautam Gambhir needs to be given more time as he has just come into the system. Rohit won us the T20 World Cup and he was the captain when India reached the World Cup (ODI) final. Mumbai Indians won 5 IPLs under Rohit's captaincy. He stepped down in the last Test (of BGT) to give someone else the chance, how many captains have done that in the past? I look at what he has done in the last 3-5 years, one tournament can't decide. For me, the series defeat at home was more disappointing as India losing 3-0 against New Zealand was tougher,"" Yuvraj told reporters during an event.Rohit Sharma's captaincy tenure has been a mix of notable successes and disappointing lows. Under his leadership, India experienced a 10-match winning streak during the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup, culminating in a final loss to Australia.However, the team also secured an ICC T20 World Cup title in 2024 and reached the final of the ICC World Test Championship 2023, where they were defeated by Australia.Since the second half of 2024, Sharma has faced challenges both as a batter and captain.

When India head coach Gautam Gambhir lost his cool in Australia

NEW DELHI: Indian cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has called on the Board of Control for Cricket in India BCCI ) to reduce the squad size for the upcoming Test series against England in June. Gavaskar, writing in his column for Sportstar, expressed concerns about the oversized contingent India took on their recent tour of Australia, which included 19 players, reserves included.Gavaskar acknowledged the need for a larger squad in Australia due to logistical challenges but insisted the England tour requires a more streamlined approach.""Carrying more than 16 players will indicate the selectors are unsure, and that's never a good sign. Just because the BCCI can afford to send a large party doesn't mean the India cap should be given just like that,"" he stated.While he recommended taking additional bowlers for practice purposes, Gavaskar was firm on not awarding them the India cap unless absolutely necessary. ""The usual problem overseas is a lack of practice bowlers, so by all means take a few bowlers over, and they can be given the training and clothing, but not the India cap,"" he added.Gavaskar also emphasised the importance of practice matches, urging the Indian team to schedule as many as possible during the England series. Reflecting on the recent Border-Gavaskar Trophy , where India opted for intra-squad games and a single tour match, Gavaskar called for a shift in approach.Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy ""There will be some gaps between the Test matches, and these need to be utilised for practice games. Travel in England is by road almost every time, and the India team will drive down to the next Test venue on the last evening of the previous Test match. Since there won't be a travel day involved, giving the next day off after the Test is understandable, but the next couple should be used for practice,"" he explained.The batting great also suggested eliminating optional practice sessions, advocating for the coach and captain to determine the team's schedule. ""This recent tradition of optional practice should be done away with, and only the coach and captain should decide who gets days off from practice, and this should not be left to the individual player to decide,"" he wrote.Also See: Champions Trophy Fixtures 2025 Concluding his remarks, Gavaskar expressed optimism about India's depth and the opportunity for a refreshed squad to make a strong statement in England.

Famous Sportscaster Lee Hamilton Reveals A $50 Million Deal That Was Cancelled Between Pete Morgan And The Los Angeles Angels

Pete Morgan’s Career In The MLB So Far



Pete Morgan Alonso, the star player and the former first baseman of the New York Mets, has now found himself in an uncomfortable situation. The star player’s one year contract with his previous team, the New York Mets ended in 2024 and now Pete might have been “in talks” with the Los Angeles Angels. However, as per sportscaster Lee Hamilton, the deal with the Los Angeles Angels did not go through.On the new episode of his podcast, Lee revealed that the Los Angeles Angels had agreed for a $50 million deal for two years; which essentially means $25 million per season. While this might seem like a fair deal for Pete, apparently the deal was rejected.According to Lee, he is unsure if the Los Angeles Angels themselves cancelled the deal or Pete’s sports agency, the Boras Corporation rejected him. Apparently, as per Lee, Scott Boras , the founder of Boras Corporation wants Pete, the star baseman to be paid $31.1 million instead of $25 million per season.Lee added, “Well, he's not going to get the max if he goes to Anaheim at two years, $25 million per season. Why would the Angels do that?”Lee continued to add that in reality it makes no sense for the Los Angeles Angels to offer a hefty $50 million deal to Pete with an offer to leave after the first year. He continued, “...And they have to give up two draft picks to sign him because he was given a qualifying offer by the Mets and turned it down? So immediately, it's draft pick compensation. Why would you sign Alonso for a two-year deal with the risk he could opt out after one year, and you lose draft picks too? Right, makes no sense at all.”While neither Pete nor has the Los Angeles Angels confirmed the deal or the contract value yet, it sure seems like a tough situation to be in for Pete. Pete has played consistently well and made his debut in the MLB back in 2019 with the New York Mets.In the 2023 season of the Major League Baseball, Pete had signed a $14.5 million salary during the arbitration period. This salary increased to a one year contract with the New York Mets in 2024 when Pete agreed to a one year deal that was signed at a value of $20.5 million.He continued to prove his worth and when the 2024 MLB season ended, the New York Mets agreed to offer him a qualifying deal but Pete did not agree to it.Currently, Pete is a free agent and it becomes interesting to see which team he finally chooses to be in for the 2025 MLB season.Also Read: MLB star pitcher Corbin Burnes' $210 million deal with Arizona Diamondbacks stirs “concerns” in rival teams and excitement in Diamondbacks, agent reveals","Pete Morgan Alonso, the star player and the former first baseman of the New York Mets, has now found himself in an uncomfortable situation.

Career and personal life

Bonnie Blue , a 25-year-old OnlyFans creator from Derbyshire , claims to have set a world record by having sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours, reports Daily Mail.The event took place in London, allegedly surpassing the previous record of 919 men in 24 hours set by adult actress Lisa Sparks in 2004, with Bonnie claiming she ""bedded 1,057 in 12 hours.""In a video shared on TikTok, Bonnie thanked those who participated, saying, “Thank you to all the barely legal, barely breathing and the husbands.”She added that her skin looked better after the event and described the experience: “The room was absolutely full.We did groups of five, like one after the other. It was a rotating circle.”Her PR team confirmed the tally, stating, “She slept with 1,057 people. As she hit 1,000, there were still 57 left in the queue who Bonnie wanted to pleasure before ending the 12-hour day.” Calculations suggest she averaged 41 seconds per partner.The stunt sparked outrage online, with comments such as “How embarrassing” and “Sad that men would want to do that too—all for fame and money.” Bonnie is no stranger to controversy, having previously defended her claims of sleeping with “barely legal” 18-year-olds and encouraging men to cheat on their wives.Bonnie's real name is Tia Billinger , who says she earns up to £750,000 a month from her OnlyFans content.

NEW DELHI: The Jukskei Derby between the Joburg Super Kings (JSK) and the Pretoria Capitals (PC) at the Wanderers Stadium was abandoned due to heavy rain.Prior to the downpour, the Joburg Super Kings' spin trio of Moeen Ali Imran Tahir , and Donovan Ferreira proved to be a formidable force.The Super Kings made a strategic decision to rest Proteas spinner Tabraiz Shamsi and instead handed Moeen Ali his first match of Season 3.Ali partnered with the experienced Imran Tahir and the promising Donovan Ferreira.Ferreira, who opened the bowling in the Powerplay, struck early by dismissing the dangerous Rahmanullah Gurbaz, caught by Tahir at point. Moeen Ali, introduced after the Powerplay, also made an immediate impact by clean bowling Capitals captain Rilee Rossouw.With Will Jacks already back in the pavilion, the Super Kings took control at 52/3. Kyle Verreynne (39 off 31 balls) and Liam Livingstone (22 off 30 balls) attempted a fightback, but Jimmy Neesham's 30 off 21 balls was the only significant contribution as the Super Kings' spin trio maintained a tight grip.Moeen Ali finished with impressive figures of 2/21 from his four overs, while Ferreira claimed 2/17 from three overs. Tahir was economical, conceding only 17 runs from his spell.The Super Kings' captain, Faf du Plessis , displayed astute tactical awareness in managing his spin bowlers and their introduction into the attack, which played a crucial role in restricting the Capitals to 138/8 before the rain intervened.Both teams secured two points each, with JSK moving to the top of the log with 10 points, while the Capitals are joint second with MI Cape Town on nine points.","The Jukskei Derby between the Joburg Super Kings (JSK) and the Pretoria Capitals (PC) at the Wanderers Stadium was abandoned due to heavy rain.

The Indian cricket team is set to receive an addition to the support staff as the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) has decided to add Sitanshu Kotak , currently the India A head coach, as the batting coach. Kotak will join head coach Gautam Gambhir from the home series versus England which features five T20Is and three ODIs.It is understood that Gambhir had asked for a batting coach during the BCCI review meet following the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and the Indian cricket board has agreed to the request.Kotak has been part of the India A set-up and National Cricket Academy (NCA) for a very long time.""Coach Gambhir had asked for a batting coach during the review meeting. Discussions were ongoing since then and now Kotak will be added to the support staff,"" said a senior BCCI official who was part of the meeting which also featured captain Rohit Sharma Considering how the batters have struggled in the last two Test series, the Indian cricket board also felt the need to have a full time batting coach.""Most of our batsmen [batters], including the seniors, have struggled badly in the last two series. There's clearly a need to strengthen the support staff of the Indian men's cricket team from the batting point of view,"" says a reliable source in the BCCI.Kotak was the India A head coach during the tour of Australia in November last year, and the head coach of the Jasprit Bumrah-captained Indian team which toured Ireland in August 2023.The 52-year-old former left-hander, who captained Saurashtra, was a colossus in domestic cricket. He played from the 1992-93 season to 2013 and scored 8061 runs in 130 first-class matches at an average of 41.76, with 15 hundreds and 55 fifties.Post retirement, the seasoned cricketer has entered full-time coaching and after coaching Saurashtra, became a batting coach at the NCA in Bengaluru. For the last four years, he has been regularly appointed by the BCCI as the India A head coach, as the side went on tours to Bangladesh, South Africa and Australia. He was also the assistant coach of the now defunct Gujarat Lions in IPL 2017.Currently, India's coaching staff, consisting of Morne Morkel (bowling coach), Abhishek Nayar (assistant coach), Ryan ten Doeschate (assistant coach) and T Dilip (fielding coach), besides the head coach Gautam Gambhir, doesn’t have a batting coach, though Nayar's role is focused on working with the batters.After India were blanked 3-0 at home by New Zealand and lost 3-1 in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, the role of the support staff of the team has come under heavy scrutiny, particularly with players like Virat Kohli, skipper Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill failing to shrug off their poor form.",India cricket team set to receive an addition to the support staff.

Despite losing a few wickets, Zaman remained steadfast, striking four sixes and three fours en route to his half-century.

We just planned to play out their overs and take the game deep. It was because of the way the bowlers were bowling and the leg-side boundary was big, so I was looking for runs on the shorter boundary,” said Fakhar as the Vipers maintained the winning streak after their third consecutive victory in the season.MI Emirates skipper Nicholas Pooran expressed satisfaction with their total of 160, considering the tricky nature of the pitch.Also See: Champions Trophy Schedule 2025 ""I felt we were in the game; we were happy with 160, the way the pitch was playing, it seemed to be very tricky.

They bring a unique style to the game, and we know they will push us hard. Test cricket is about adapting to challenges, and as a team, we are prepared to respond to whatever comes our way,"" Masood said. ""The series win against England at home has given us a lot of confidence and momentum. We are fully focused on putting in strong performances and carrying forward that winning attitude,"" he added.Pakistan's 15-member squad has completed three days of comprehensive training, whilst the Kraigg Brathwaite-led visitors trained for two days at Multan Cricket Stadium. The touring team also participated in a three-day practice match against Pakistan Shaheens at the Islamabad Club last week.West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite emphasised the importance of performing well in Pakistani conditions, noting that most squad members, including himself, are visiting the country for the first time.""We are very excited to be here in Pakistan, I personally had never come to Pakistan before and probably the majority of players are also touring for the first time and we are really looking forward to doing well in the series. Pakistan are a strong side at home, so we look forward to doing well in these conditions,"" he said. ""Our team's performance will be quite crucial here, and obviously putting runs on the board is important but taking 20 wickets will be the key to winning the Test match.""Our preparations are going well, we had a few days in Islamabad where we played a practice game which went quite good for us as a group and we had our sessions here in Multan which were helpful as well,"" Brathwaite added.","The two-Test series between Pakistan and West Indies begins at Multan Cricket Stadium on January 17, with the second match scheduled at the same venue from January 25. During their previous Test series in Pakistan, the home side, led by PCB Hall of Famer Inzamam-ul-Haq, secured a 2-0 victory in the three-match series. West Indies currently occupy the bottom position in the WTC standings.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117299077,imgsize-55518,width-400,resizemode-4/117299077.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Left-arm spinner Tilly Corteen-Coleman stated that England wants to enjoy playing top-tier competitive cricket in the run-up to the 2025 U19 Women's T20 World Cup.In 2023, England lost to India in the final in Potchefstroom, South Africa, and ended as runners-up.""As a team, I think we are looking to have loads of fun out there, but playing high-quality and competitive cricket is what we are really going out there for.We have a bit of a team motto: 'evolve, embrace, enjoy' - evolve ourselves, embrace the challenge, and enjoy ourselves. All of our cricket will be playing with those values in mind.""We are going to be doing our very best to win. I was in school at the time of the last one (U19 Women's T20 World Cup), I couldn't watch all of it. I followed as much as I could. I knew a lot of the players in the team, so I was rooting for them. It's a shame they didn't get over the line but they played some really exciting cricket,"" Tilly was quoted as saying by ICC.Before becoming the youngest player and youngest wicket-taker in the history of The Hundred women's competition, Tilly made her debut in 2024 when she took four wickets in four balls for South East Stars in the Charlotte Edwards Cup. Growing up near Kent's home ground in Canterbury, Tilly was persuaded to play cricket by his older brother Hugo.Tilly progressed through the ranks at Kent, learning a lot about the game from Laura Marsh, Lydia Greenway, Charlotte Edwards, and Tammy Beaumont after deciding to move from seam bowling to spin on the recommendation of her under-11s coach, David Sear.""I started at my local club, St Lawrence and Highland Court, when I was six. I really started because I wanted to copy my brother. We are really competitive and I couldn't bear the thought that he might be better than me at something.""From a young age, I knew it was what I wanted to do. I remember going to junior school and we had a careers day where we had to come to school dressed as what you want to be when you're older. I went dressed as a cricketer. So, I always knew what I was going to do,"" she said.Tilly's cricket career took a drastic turn in 2024 when she was called up late for the South East Stars' preseason tour of Abu Dhabi. ""I had absolutely no idea. I'm so lucky and grateful for the opportunities I had last season. I hadn't even played a match for South East Stars when I was called up to the pre-season tour.""I then went to Sri Lanka and was lucky to be part of the travelling squad with the England U19s, which was amazing. That is when I got the call from Lottie (Charlotte Edwards) about being drafted by Southern Brave. It all went very quickly from there. A couple of weeks later I got the call from Surrey (South East Stars at the time) offering me a pay-as-you-play contract. That was pretty incredible.""Tilly's maiden wicket in The Hundred was of former Australian captain Meg Lanning , something she never would have imagined in her wildest fantasies, following her stunning performance of taking four wickets in four deliveries against the Northern Diamonds.""I can't lie, I hadn't even realised I was on a hat-trick or four in four. It was only because it was the last wicket of the game that I was celebrating on the pitch with the team. They told me to look at the big screen and that is when I saw it. It was pretty unexpected and an incredible day.""The Hundred was so special and I'm so grateful for the opportunity given to me by Lottie, and to work with such an incredible group of players and coaches. To play on such a huge stage and have such amazing support from the crowd is everything I'd wanted and more. To have Meg Lanning as your first wicket, and caught and bowled, it's even better.""It was such a whirlwind, the Hundred and my first wicket. I wouldn't have wanted to do it with anyone else. I knew a couple of them, but not many, but they were such a great group of girls but to go straight in and play in every game, with Lottie showing such faith in me, so it was an amazing experience all-round,"" she concluded.",Tilly Corteen-Coleman is the youngest player and youngest wicket-taker in The Hundred women's competition.

Barcelona advanced to the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey with a resounding 5-1 victory over Real Betis on Wednesday. The star of the show was 17-year-old Lamine Yamal , who put on a dazzling display at the Olympic Stadium.Gavi opened the scoring for Barcelona early in the match, and the Catalans continued to dominate with goals from Jules Kounde, Raphinha, Ferran Torres, and Yamal himself.The young winger's performance was particularly impressive, as he scored and helped create two more goals.Barcelona's confidence was high coming into the match, having recently won the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia by thrashing Real Madrid. Despite resting key players like Robert Lewandowski, the team's attacking prowess was on full display.Pau Cubarsi, a 17-year-old defender who came through Barcelona's youth academy alongside Yamal, praised his teammate's performance.""I've been enjoying watching him for many years, now the whole world is, and he deserves it all.""Barcelona's dominance was evident from the start, with Dani Olmo, who recently obtained a temporary playing license, starting as a false nine in place of Lewandowski. Olmo was involved in the opening goal and had several chances of his own, hitting the post and firing over.Kounde scored Barcelona's second goal after a sublime pass from Yamal, exploiting the right side of Betis' defense. Although Kounde had a second goal disallowed for a marginal offside, Barcelona continued to create chances.In the second half, Yamal had a goal of his own disallowed for an offside in the build-up, but it didn't matter as Raphinha scored minutes later after another surging run from the young winger. Ferran Torres added a fourth goal, and Yamal finally got on the scoresheet himself with a near-post finish.Betis managed to pull one back from the penalty spot through Vitor Roque, who is on loan from Barcelona, after Kounde fouled Jesus Rodriguez in the area.After the game, Gavi praised Yamal as the best player in the world after Lionel Messi, and coach Hansi Flick also commended the winger's talent.""Gavi's very emotional, so I say also yes (he's the best),"" joked Flick.""You can see it, in great matches you see big talent and he showed it many many times, he's on a good (path).""Yamal, who shone for Spain during their Euro 2024 victory last summer, has an impressive tally of nine goals and 13 assists across all competitions for Barcelona this season.In other Copa del Rey action, Atletico Madrid joined Barcelona in the last eight with a comfortable 4-0 win over second division Elche. This marked Atletico's 15th consecutive victory across all competitions.Atletico coach Diego Simeone rested some of his regular starters, but the team still managed to secure a commanding win. Alexander Sorloth scored twice in the first half, and Elche's chances of a comeback were further diminished when Nico Fernandez was sent off early in the second half.Rodrigo Riquelme and Julian Alvarez added to Atletico's lead, sealing an emphatic victory for the Rojiblancos.The Copa del Rey action continues on Thursday, with defending league champions Real Madrid hosting Celta Vigo and cup holders Athletic Bilbao welcoming Osasuna.","Barcelona defeated Real Betis 5-1 in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday.

London: Arsenal reignited their Premier League title challenge with a 2-1 victory over Tottenham on Wednesday, while Newcastle secured a spot in the top four thanks to a brace from Alexander Isak.In other matches, David Moyes had a disappointing return to the Everton dugout as his team lost 1-0 to Aston Villa at Goodison Park.The win at the Emirates lifts Arsenal to within four points of league leaders Liverpool, who drew 1-1 with Nottingham Forest on Tuesday, and ended a three-match winless run for the Gunners across all competitions.Tottenham took the lead through Son Heung-min in the 25th minute, but Arsenal equalised 15 minutes later when Gabriel's header from a corner deflected off Dominic Solanke for an own goal.Arsenal completed the turnaround just before halftime, with Leandro Trossard blasting a shot past new Spurs goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky.Despite numerous chances to extend their lead, Arsenal failed to do so and had a nervous moment when Pedro Porro hit the post in stoppage time.Arsenal now sits on 43 points after 21 matches, four points behind Liverpool, who have a game in hand.Mikel Arteta, the Arsenal manager, praised his team's performance, calling it ""outstanding.""""We had some big chances and big situations. At the end we had to suffer more than we wanted,"" he told the BBC.""When you have opportunities (to close the gap) you have to take them. We are on a really consistent run in the Premier League. It's about recovery tomorrow and Aston Villa on Saturday, going and going.""The defeat is another setback for injury-plagued Tottenham, who have taken only five points from their last nine Premier League games and have fallen to 13th in the table.Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou was critical of his team's performance, saying, ""Nowhere near good enough, especially in the first half. We were too passive.""Newcastle moved into fourth place, ahead of struggling Chelsea, with a 3-0 victory over Wolves, thanks to a record-chasing performance from Isak, who scored for the eighth consecutive league match.Isak's deflected shot off Wolves defender Rayan Ait-Nouri put Newcastle ahead in the 34th minute, and he doubled the lead before the hour mark with his 15th league goal of the season.Anthony Gordon added a third goal for Newcastle.""I feel amazing,"" said Isak, who has Jamie Vardy's record of scoring in 11 straight Premier League games in his sights.""Individually I feel free and confident but looking at the team we are doing so well as well, defending and with threats going forward. It is a team and I have to keep contributing with goals.""At Goodison Park, Ollie Watkins scored the only goal for Aston Villa in the 51st minute, slotting past England teammate Jordan Pickford after being sent through by Morgan Rogers.Despite their efforts, Everton lacked creativity, which is unsurprising for a team that has scored only 15 league goals in 20 matches this season.The result lifts Aston Villa to seventh in the table, while Everton remain in deep trouble, just one point above the relegation zone in 16th place.Everton, who have been in the top flight since 1954, have struggled against relegation for the past three seasons and are once again in a perilous position.David Moyes, who enjoyed success during his 11-year stint at Goodison Park from 2002 to 2013, was brought back by Everton's new American owners, the Friedkin Group, after they sacked Sean Dyche last week.""Obviously it's been a bit of a whirlwind,"" Moyes said. ""Sean Dyche left a group of players that have great character and a great attitude.""I'm really pleased to take over that. What I need to do is add quality and find a way of getting results but you can't change the whole thing around straight away.""In another match, Leicester suffered their sixth consecutive league defeat, losing 2-0 to Crystal Palace, which leaves them second from bottom in the table.Jean-Philippe Mateta scored for Palace early in the second half, and Marc Guehi secured the points with a late second goal.","Arsenal beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 to move within four points of Premier League leaders Liverpool.

Liverpool 's charge towards the Premier League title was halted by stubborn Nottingham Forest in a 1-1 draw between the top two on Tuesday as Manchester City 's resurgence came undone in a 2-2 draw at Brentford.Chris Wood fired Forest in front early on at a raucous City Ground, but Liverpool dominated almost the entire 97 minutes and got back on level terms thanks to substitute Diogo Jota's goal with his first touch.Only a brilliant goalkeeping performance from Matz Sels denied the leaders victory, but the point maintained a six-point cushion over Forest for Arne Slot's men, who also have a game in hand.Forest had won their last seven games in all competitions to raise the possibility of matching Leicester's incredible title win of 2015/16.The in-form Wood had the home fans believing after just eight minutes when he slotted in Anthony Elanga's pass.Liverpool enjoyed over 70 percent possession and had 23 shots on goal but only posed a serious threat in front of goal after the break.Jota had only been on the field a matter of seconds when he nodded in Kostas Tsimikas' corner.Sels then made incredible saves to deny Jota, Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo a winner, while Salah also had a goalbound effort cleared off the line.""I could not have asked for more,"" said Slot. ""Second half was outstanding.""There are not many teams that can create so many chances against an opponent so defensively strong. Unfortunately we couldn't get a second.""Liverpool's second consecutive league draw opens the door for Arsenal to cut the gap at the top to four points when they host Tottenham in the north London derby on Wednesday.Any suggestion City could get themselves back in the title race was ended in a late collapse in west London as Brentford struck twice in the final 10 minutes for a deserved point.Phil Foden's double had City on course for a fourth consecutive win after a run of just one victory in 13 games.However, the English champions' defending was not convincing all night and they were punished as Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard netted for the Bees.Foden's return to the form that saw him crowned Premier League player of the year last season was the one positive for City.But Pep Guardiola will reflect on a missed opportunity to make up ground on the top four as City remain down in sixth, 12 points off the top.Foden produced a brilliant deft touch from Kevin De Bruyne's inviting delivery and then smashed in a rebound for his fourth goal in five league games.Brentford wasted a host of chances before conceding but finally got some reward for their attacking endeavour when Wissa slotted in from Mads Roerslev's cross to become the club's all-time leading goalscorer in the Premier League.They completed the comeback in stoppage time when Norgaard's header had too much power for Stefan Ortega.""We are not (at our best) and we didn't take the right decisions,"" said Guardiola. ""It's fine, it's not a good place to come. Unfortunately, we couldn't win.""Fourth-placed Chelsea's miserable run extended to five league games without a win but they were grateful for captain Reece James' stoppage-time equaliser salvaging a point in a 2-2 draw at home to Bournemouth.Cole Palmer's cool finish from Nicolas Jackson's through ball had given Chelsea the perfect start.But Bournemouth hit back through Justin Kluivert's penalty, before Antoine Semenyo's blistering near-post effort put the visitors in front.James has endured another injury-hit season but showed his quality by curling home a free-kick at the death.West Ham boss Graham Potter enjoyed a winning home debut as Fulham were beaten 3-2 at the London Stadium.Carlos Soler, Tomas Soucek and Lucas Paqueta were on target for the Hammers to take Potter's men above Manchester United and Tottenham into 12th.",Liverpool held to 1-1 draw by Nottingham Forest at the City Ground.

Conceicao success

Milan: Atalanta creeped closer to Serie A leaders Napoli on Tuesday after drawing an entertaining match with Juventus 1-1 and moving to within four points of the summit, while AC Milan came from behind to beat Como.Mateo Retegui salvaged a point for Atalanta with a close-range header 12 minutes from time, not long after returning to action from the bench following four weeks on the sidelines with a hamstring injury.The Italy striker's finish, which levelled Pierre Kalulu's 54th-minute opener for Juve, put him out on his own at the top of the Serie A scoring charts on 13 goals and pushed Atalanta to 43 points, ahead of table-topping Napoli's crucial trip to Bergamo this coming weekend.Gian Piero Gasperini's side, who are bidding for their first league title after winning the Europa League last season, sit level on points with second-placed Inter Milan.However, champions Inter have two games in hand on both Atalanta and Napoli and play the first of those fixtures against Bologna at the San Siro on Wednesday.""It was a great match tonight, and I'm very happy with the way my boys played,"" said Gasperini to Sky.""It was difficult going behind because we were hoping to go ahead but I think at the end of the day a draw is probably a fair result.""Tuesday's draw was Atalanta and Juve's rescheduled fixture due to their trip to Saudi Arabia to contest the Italian Super Cup earlier this month with Inter and winners AC Milan.Juve were again without a recognised striker due to an injury crisis which has left both Dusan Vlahovic and Arkadiusz Milik sidelined but Thiago Motta's side were a constant threat.Moments before his opener Kalulu watched on in frustration as his glancing header hit the inside of the post and was just scooped off the line by Atalanta goalkeeper Marco Carnesecchi.And Kenan Yildiz put wide a great chance to snatch a last-gasp win deep in stoppage time, shortly after substitute Nicolo Zaniolo slapped a golden opportunity for the hosts straight at Juve goalkeeper Michele Di Gregorio.""To draw like that in the closing minutes hurts a bit. We played well and had the chances to win today,"" said Kalulu.Juve remain unbeaten but have now drawn 13 of their 20 league fixtures and sit fifth, 13 points behind Napoli.Earlier, Theo Hernandez and Rafael Leao saved Milan from an embarrassing defeat at Como with the goals which gave Sergio Conceicao's new team a 2-1 win.Trailing to Assane Diao's fine low strike on the hour mark, star players Hernandez and Leao turned the match around by the 76th minute, handing Conceicao his first league win as Milan coach.Tuesday's victory in one of their two games in hand moved Milan up to seventh on 31 points, five behind fourth-placed Lazio as Conceicao tries to reignite the Italian giants' bid for Champions League qualification.""They (Como) are a good team with a good coach, it's not easy to play here,"" said Conceicao.""It was an even game but we can't concede as much as we did, we need to be more organised.""Left flank pairing Hernandez and Leao had reportedly been at loggerheads with Conceicao's predecessor Paulo Fonseca, who was sacked at the end of December following a dismal opening half of the season.Both praised their new coach after he arrived just before the new year and immediately won the Super Cup for Milan, who came from two goals behind to beat Inter in Saudi Arabia earlier this month.Hernandez levelled for Milan 11 minutes after Como new boy Diao's opener when his mishit volley sliced off his left boot and looped past goalkeeper Jean Butez.Leao dinked home the decisive goal shortly afterwards, meeting substitute Tammy Abraham's excellent through ball before netting his seventh goal in all competitions.",Atalanta draw 1-1 with Juventus in Serie A.
