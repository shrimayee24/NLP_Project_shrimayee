Crime shows to crime scene



A clue in the burn pattern



Revenge and confession



NEW DELHI: It was meant to be ""perfect murder"" -- until it wasn't. A 21-year-old forensic science student's elaborate plan to kill her 32-year-old live-in partner and disguise it as an accident fell apart after CCTV footage and expert analysis exposed her crime.Amrita Chauhan, along with her ex-boyfriend Sumit Kashyap (27) and their friend Sandeep Kumar (29), strangled UPSC aspirant Ramkesh Meena to death this month. The trio then poured oil, ghee, and wine on his body to ensure it burned completely, police said.Meena had allegedly refused to delete Amrita's private photos and videos stored on his hard disk, the dispute which turned fatal for him.According to police, Amrita, a forensic science student, used her academic knowledge and ideas inspired by crime web series to stage the murder as an accidental fire. “The case was one of the perfectly planned murders, but it was solved even more perfectly by the Delhi Police through relentless investigation and scientific analysis,” said Special Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Ravindra Yadav told PTI news agency.Investigators said Amrita was obsessed with crime web series and binge-watched them regularly, using what she learned to plot the murder. Initially, the crime scene -- a north Delhi Gandhi Vihar flat -- appeared to show a cylinder blast, with no visible signs of violence.Yadav said, “At the onset, it appeared to be an accidental fire. But no matter how perfect a plan is, criminals always leave some clue. Our team worked more perfectly and cracked the case.”Police said Amrita used her forensic training to erase evidence, pouring oil, ghee, and wine on the body and leaving the cylinder valve open before igniting it. “Amrita, being a forensic student, had used her knowledge to erase evidence,” Yadav added.However, forensic experts soon noticed irregularities in the burn marks that didn’t match an accidental fire. This led investigators to re-examine the case.“We scanned several CCTV cameras around the area and found two masked men entering the building on the night of October 5, followed by Amrita and another man later. Moments after they left, the fire erupted,” Yadav said.The CCTV footage shifted the course of the probe. Combined with call data records and technical surveillance, it placed Amrita near the scene when the fire broke out. Police tracked her movements and arrested her from Moradabad on October 18.During interrogation, Amrita broke down and confessed. She told police that Meena had recorded intimate videos of her and refused to delete them after their breakup. Furious, she sought help from her ex-boyfriend Sumit, who, along with Sandeep, helped her plan and execute the murder.Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) Raja Banthia said, “The hard disk has been sent for forensic examination. Further investigation into the matter is under way.”On the night of October 5–6, the trio went to Meena’s flat. Sumit and Sandeep strangled him, while Amrita poured oil, ghee, and wine on his body. Sumit, an LPG distributor, opened the cylinder knob near Meena’s head before setting it on fire. They locked the flat from inside using Amrita’s hand through a removed portion of the iron gate net and escaped with Meena’s hard disk, laptops, and other belongings. An hour later, the cylinder exploded, engulfing the body in flames.“We have substantial evidence to prove the crime -- from CCTV footage to recovered items and digital traces,” Yadav said.Following her arrest, police recovered Meena’s hard disk, a trolley bag, and a shirt belonging to the victim. Sumit was later caught from Moradabad on October 21, and Sandeep was nabbed two days after. Their phones and other evidence used in the crime were also seized.What was meant to be a “perfect murder” planned by a forensic mind turned into a perfect case solved by forensic science itself.","Amrita Chauhan, her ex-boyfriend and their friend strangled UPSC aspirant Ramkesh Meena to death this month.

Ryan Kesler’s NHL legacy now collides with legal controversy





Former NHL center Ryan Kesler is facing major legal scrutiny after being charged with two counts of fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct in Michigan. The alleged incident took place on January 1 in Orchard Lake, near Kesler’s hometown of Livonia. Police spent nearly 10 months investigating before filing charges, placing the retired hockey star at the center of a headline-grabbing scandal that now threatens his public image and family life.Kesler, 41, appeared via Zoom on October 27 and pleaded not guilty. He was released on bond after paying 10% of a $50,000 bail and is restricted from leaving Michigan without court approval. Authorities have not shared details about the alleged victim or the incident, keeping much of the case sealed while the legal process continues.A probable cause hearing is scheduled for November 6, followed by a preliminary exam on November 13 — key dates that will determine whether the case proceeds to trial. With Kesler maintaining his innocence, the court’s upcoming decisions will be closely followed by fans and media alike.Behind the scenes of the controversy is Kesler’s wife, Andrea Kesler — the woman now unexpectedly thrust into the public eye. Known for staying private throughout Kesler’s NHL career, she has supported him since their teenage years, long before the fame, endorsements, and Olympic appearances.Andrea Kesler has been a constant presence throughout Ryan Kesler’s NHL journey, from his early days with the Vancouver Canucks to becoming a Selke Trophy winner and an Olympic silver medalist.They married in 2010 and share four children together — a close family that has always projected stability, especially during Kesler’s toughest professional years battling injuries. Now, that same family is dealing with an entirely different kind of pressure as legal headlines circulate worldwide.Ryan Kesler built one of the most competitive reputations in modern hockey, spending 15 seasons in the NHL after being selected 23rd overall by the Vancouver Canucks in the 2003 NHL Draft. His hard-nosed style and elite defensive play made him a core piece in Vancouver before he was traded to the Anaheim Ducks in 2014. Across 1,001 career games, Kesler recorded 573 points and earned the prestigious Selke Trophy as the league’s top defensive forward. He also represented Team USA on the Olympic stage, cementing his place as a standout two-way center.However, as Kesler faces criminal sexual conduct charges in Michigan, his decorated career is now overshadowed by legal uncertainty. The focus has shifted from highlight-reel performances to courtroom dates, raising major questions about his legacy and future.Amid the ongoing legal challenges, his wife Andrea Kesler continues to support him and keep their family grounded while the case gains national attention.Also Read: Connor McDavid’s wife Lauren Kyle and Leon Draisaitl’s wife Celeste Desjardins steal the show with iconic Halloween looks","Former NHL center Ryan Kesler is facing two counts of criminal sexual conduct in Michigan.

Who is Shane Bieber's wife Kara Bieber?



When Toronto Blue Jays ace Shane Bieber met his future wife, Kara, he didn’t exactly make a stylish first impression. The MLB star, who’s now battling for a World Series title against the Los Angeles Dodgers, once showed up to their first meeting in jeans and sandals. It was a fashion choice that earned him a quick roast from Kara. Years later, the couple laughs about it, but at the time, she wasn’t impressed at all.Before he became a World Series starter and a two-time All-Star, Shane Bieber was just another college alumnus back in town. During an alumni weekend at UC Santa Barbara, he met Kara through mutual friends. The connection was instant, but not without a little humor.In a candid chat with Paradise Valley City Lifestyle, Kara Bieber recalled the moment vividly. “It was alumni weekend, and Shane was back in town. We had mutual friends who introduced us and instantly hit it off. He showed up in jeans and sandals, and I remember thinking, ‘Wow, this guy needs a wardrobe update.’”That first impression didn’t last long. Beneath the casual outfit, Kara saw someone genuine and grounded. The pair began dating soon after and stayed together through Shane’s rise with the Cleveland Guardians before tying the knot in January 2023 at Hevadu Vineyard Estate in Malibu.In July of that same year, they celebrated their fifth anniversary as a couple.This year has been especially eventful for the couple. In March, they welcomed their first child, a son named Kav McClain. Just a few months later, Shane was traded to the Blue Jays in exchange for Khal Stephen, and now he finds himself pitching on the game’s biggest stage.Kara Maxine Bieber is much more than a baseball spouse. A Northern California native and former college athlete, she balanced basketball, volleyball, and even rodeo competitions during her time at UC Santa Barbara.After graduation, she channeled her competitive drive into entrepreneurship, founding Kara Maxine LLC, along with two thriving brands— Kinlike, a clothing label, and TELT Skincare, a wellness line known for its clean formulas.Kara is also open about her journey into motherhood, sharing heartfelt reflections online. “Kav McClain, you didn’t just enter our lives, you rewrote it,” she wrote on Instagram. “Every emotion, step I take and purpose I have is now altered in the very best way.”As her husband Shane dominates on the mound, Kara continues to build her own empire off it.Also Read: Shane Bieber clears years of confusion and confirms no relation to Justin Bieber after Toronto Blue Jays' World Series clash at Dodger Stadium","Kara Bieber roasted Shane Bieber's wardrobe choices on their first date.

In a stunning upset at the Paris Masters on Tuesday, World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz lost to unseeded Cameron Norrie 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.

The defeat to Norrie ended Alcaraz's impressive 17-match winning streak in Masters 1000 events.Alcaraz struggled throughout the match, making 54 unforced errors and winning only 64% of his first-serve points. The Spanish star's frustration was visible as he had an animated discussion with his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero after dropping the second set.""I'm really disappointed about my level,"" Alcaraz admitted after the match. ""I didn't feel well today. A lot of mistakes.""For Norrie, the victory marked his first career win against a top-ranked player.

Tyler Shough’s first NFL start comes against tough Rams defense in Week 9



The New Orleans Saints are making a bold quarterback change after their 23-3 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 8. Rookie Tyler Shough will now take over the starting job from Spencer Rattler, as head coach Kellen Moore shifts direction to evaluate the team’s long-term future under center.The decision comes after Rattler started the first eight games of the season, posting 1,586 passing yards, eight touchdowns, and five interceptions. While not disastrous, his performances lacked the consistency and explosiveness needed to elevate the Saints’ struggling offense. Moore made the switch during Sunday’s game, inserting Shough for his first NFL action.Shough completed 17 of 30 passes for 128 yards with one interception, adding 12 rushing yards on three attempts. The second-round pick showed poise and mobility, enough for the Saints’ coaching staff to hand him the reins moving forward. According to NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport, Moore informed the quarterbacks that the “Saints making rookie QB Tyler Shough their starter,” signaling the franchise’s commitment to evaluating Shough’s potential immediately.Shough’s first start won’t come easy. He will face the Los Angeles Rams’ high-pressure defensive front in Week 9 — a difficult matchup for any rookie quarterback making his debut as a starter.With a Week 11 bye ahead, Shough will have two opportunities to prove he belongs before a break allows the Saints to recalibrate and fine-tune the offense around him. The timing makes this a critical evaluation window.New Orleans currently projects to hold the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, which puts the team in a franchise-defining position.

William Nylander’s status remains unclear ahead of Maple Leafs’ second game against Calgary Flames

If not Nylander, who will replace him in the Calgary match?

Also read:

Toronto Maple Leafs forward William Nylander’s status remains unclear and is in question for the team ahead of their match against the Calgary Flames. This is the second consecutive game against Calgary, which will be hosted at the Scotiabank Arena. According to the Maple Leafs, Nylander will be a game-time decision for the Toronto Maple Leafs, and this is due to the major injury that the player has sustained recently. Let’s find out if Nylander is fit to play against the Calgary Flames or if he still needs time to recover. Maple Leafs right winger William Nylander ’s status remains unclear ahead of the team’s second game against the Calgary Flames, which is set to be played at the Scotiabank Arena on Tuesday. As per the team, they are preparing for a pivotal clash with the Calgary Flames, with Nylander once again a game-time decision for the second straight game.Previously, Nylander left Friday’s 5-3 setback to the Buffalo Sabres at KeyBank Center with a lower-body injury. The player did not return to the ice for the warm-up and remains in doubt for Tuesday’s game, too.Reports suggest that Nylander took part in the morning skate for the return match on Saturday but was held out despite taking line rushes.He took part in a full practice on Monday, but Maple Leafs head coach Craig Berube said they would see how he feels in the morning. Meanwhile, a game-time decision assessment was given again on Tuesday to check his health status.Speaking to Craig Berube regarding Nylander’s return, the head coach stated, “I think it depends on a couple of things,” Berube said. “I really don't want to get too detailed into it, but there's a couple of areas where he needs to feel right.”Berube further continued, “It's hard for him to know until it's game time out in the warm-up, and how he feels and how he's doing certain things. That's the decision that's going to be made.”As the Leafs are bracing for the possibility of Nylander’s absence in the upcoming match against the Calgary Flames, the team is currently busy finding his replacement for the clash. Sources claimed that Sammy Blais could have a potential debut. After being claimed off waivers before the season started, Blais could make his Leafs debut in the club’s 10th game of the regular season.Berube also dropped a hint at his possible appearance in the game, stating, “He's a physical player. He likes to throw his body around on the forecheck,” Berube said of Blais. “And from the past that I had Sammy, he's got really good hands. He's good and tight with the puck and can do pretty incredible things.”Additionally, he might be a choice for the team as Berube coached Sammy Blais during the St. Louis Blues’ 2019 Stanley Cup run and a couple of years afterward.","William Nylander’s status remains unclear ahead of Maple Leafs’ second game against Calgary Flames on Tuesday.

Buffalo Sabres’ Rising Fire: Why Alex Tuch and Tage Thompson believe this year feels different,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/buffalo-sabres-rising-fire-why-alex-tuch-and-tage-thompson-believe-this-year-feels-different/articleshow/124879287.cms,"Alex Tuch (Image Via Twitter)

How did Alex Tuch characterize the Buffalo Sabres’ unforeseen resurrection?

Watch All Of Alex Tuch's 36 Goals From The 2024-25 Buffalo Sabres Season | Goal Highlights

What makes Tage Thompson sure this team is ready to compete?

The Buffalo Sabres have come alive, and this time the trust is genuine. After a difficult beginning of the season, Buffalo has managed to climb into the Eastern Conference wild-card battle, proving that sometimes the soul can be stronger than the past. Though for years optimism has been far and few between in upstate New York, the Sabres’ revival with powerhouses like Tuch and Thompson has cast a dream shadow over the fans — even if it still feels like a bit too early for the hope.Not too long ago, the Sabres were in such a bad space that after three defeats in a row and just two goals scored, many had already written them off for a season to be forgotten. However, Alex Tuch, when asked about the situation, remarked that it was a rapid transformation. “Our compete has been through the roof, honestly, since Day 1,” he said. “We're starting to find our scoring touch here. Everyone is chipping in, everyone is producing. ”Buffalo went off the charts in its offense, scoring eight against Ottawa and then freezing the defending champ Florida Panthers. They even matched the Maple's strength, winning and losing in one home-and-home series, respectively, and even getting three out of four points.It’s not flawless — but it’s a sign of something good.Tage Thompson thinks this is not a coincidence — it’s development. “Every single game we've played this season, we've been right there,” he stated. “Sometimes it just comes down to bad puck luck, sometimes it's self-inflicted with our puck decisions.”The power play of Buffalo is very much the main story. The once 24th-ranked unit has now made it to the list of top 10 in the league and is flourishing with a very simple philosophy — shoot more and think less. Thompson even said, “When we keep it simple and shoot and get to the net is when we get their PK spinning a bit, and that's when we've had success.”The Atlantic Division might still be very strong, but the stumbling of typical giants such as Tampa Bay and Toronto has led to the opening of a window. Whether the Sabres will actually be able to take advantage of it is not clear yet, but what is certain is that this particular team has decided to stop playing scared. Belief on the ice is back for Buffalo.Also Read: Brad Marchand shines at 37, but the Florida Panthers need more support","The Buffalo Sabres have come alive, and this time the trust is genuine.

Suryakumar Yadav press conference: On Shreyas Iyer's injury, his own form and Australia series

The terrifying moment

BCCI confirms stability

‘He’s recovering well’: Teammates rally around Iyer

In a moment that stunned fans and teammates alike, India’s vice-captain Shreyas Iyer suffered a spleen laceration and internal bleeding during the third ODI against Australia in Sydney — an injury that briefly turned life-threatening before swift medical intervention saved the day.What looked like a routine fielding effort quickly spiraled into panic when Iyer collapsed on the ground, clutching his abdomen after completing a brilliant diving catch to dismiss Alex Carey. Within minutes, it was clear something was seriously wrong. His blood pressure dropped, and he was rushed off the field by the team’s medical staff.The incident occurred midway through Australia’s innings when Iyer sprinted backward from point to complete a stunning catch, diving full length and landing awkwardly on his ribs and elbow. At first, it appeared he had just winded himself. But as teammates gathered around him, concern mounted when Iyer began showing signs of distress.He was immediately taken to St. Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney, accompanied by team doctor Dr. Rizwan Khan. Initial X-rays suggested rib bruising, but a subsequent CT scan revealed a far more serious issue — a laceration to his spleen, causing internal bleeding. Medical staff classified it as a grade-two splenic injury, which can be potentially fatal if untreated.Those tracking developments say, “it could have been touch and go” had the bleeding not been stopped in time. A hospital insider described the next few hours as “critical,” but fortunately, doctors managed to arrest the bleeding without the need for surgery.The BCCI later confirmed the nature of the injury in an official release: “Shreyas Iyer sustained a blunt injury to his abdomen, resulting in a laceration of his spleen with internal bleeding. The bleeding was promptly arrested. His condition is stable, and he continues to be under observation.”BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia added that Iyer’s recovery has been “better than initially expected” and credited the prompt response of medical personnel.Dr. Rizwan has remained in Sydney to monitor Iyer’s progress, while arrangements have been made for his sister Shresta Iyer to fly in and join him during recovery. “He’s talking, smiling, and already joking with the nurses,” a team source revealed.""He's recovering well, replying to us on phone that means he is doing absolutely fine. It is unfortunate what happened but the doctors are taking care of him. He'll be monitored for the next few days but nothing to be worried about,"" said India captain Suryakumar Yadav on the eve of the five-match T20I series against Australia.","India's vice-captain Shreyas Iyer suffered a spleen laceration and internal bleeding during the third ODI against Australia in Sydney.

NEW DELHI: Babar Azam ’s much-anticipated return to T20 internationals turned into a nightmare on Tuesday as Pakistan crashed to a 55-run defeat against an under-strength South Africa in the series opener at Rawalpindi.Making his first T20I appearance since December 2024, Babar’s comeback lasted just two balls before he was dismissed for a duck, offering a simple catch to Reeza Hendricks at cover.The dismissal stunned a packed 16,000-strong crowd that had erupted in cheers as he walked out to bat, just nine runs short of breaking Rohit Sharma ’s all-time T20I runs record. Moments later, Rawalpindi fell silent as Pakistan’s most celebrated batter trudged back to the pavilion.The evening also saw Babar drop George Linde in the 17th over — a simple catch at mid-on that not only spared the South African all-rounder but also rolled over the boundary rope. Linde capitalised on the reprieve, hammering 36 off 22 balls to propel South Africa to 194/9 after being put in to bat.Reeza Hendricks anchored the innings with a fluent 40-ball 60, while debutant Tony de Zorzi chipped in with a blistering 33 off 16.Despite Mohammad Nawaz’s 3/26 and a couple of tidy overs from Saim Ayub (2/31), Pakistan’s bowlers struggled to contain the Proteas’ early onslaught, particularly during the powerplay where the visitors piled up 74 runs.In reply, Pakistan’s chase never took off. Corbin Bosch led the Proteas’ charge with 4/14, dismissing both openers before sending Babar back early. Only Ayub (37 off 28) and Nawaz (36 off 20) offered resistance as Pakistan folded for 139 in 18.1 overs.With the series moving to Lahore for the remaining two matches, Babar will hope to rewrite his comeback story — and silence the growing whispers around his T20 future.",Babar Azam dismissed for a duck in Pakistan's 55-run defeat to South Africa.

Shreyas Iyer’s condition critical after suffering life-threatening injury in Sydney | Inside details

India cricketer Shreyas Iyer is now stable after a frightening on-field injury during the third ODI against Australia in Sydney on Saturday that led to internal bleeding and emergency ICU care.The 30-year-old suffered a spleen laceration while diving forward to catch Alex Carey. What first appeared to be a rib injury turned serious soon after, as Iyer’s body vitals dropped sharply in the dressing room, prompting an immediate rush to Sydney’s St Vincent’s Hospital. Doctors later confirmed he had sustained a blunt abdominal impact causing a ruptured spleen and internal bleeding.The BCCI , in a statement on Tuesday, confirmed the diagnosis: “The injury was promptly identified, and the bleeding was immediately arrested. His condition is now stable, and he continues to be under observation. A repeat scan on October 28 has shown significant improvement. The BCCI Medical Team, in consultation with specialists in Sydney and India, will continue to monitor his progress.”Iyer’s condition was initially life-threatening, with sources revealing that his blood pressure had dropped to “alarmingly low levels” before doctors acted swiftly to control the bleeding.He was shifted to the ICU and underwent a non-surgical medical procedure to stop the hemorrhage.BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia told TOI that Iyer’s recovery has been faster than expected.“Shreyas is much, much better. His recovery has been much faster than what doctors anticipated. He didn’t undergo surgery but a different procedure. He’s stable, out of ICU, walking, and eating normally now,” Saikia confirmed.The BCCI is also arranging for Iyer’s sister Shresta Iyer to travel to Sydney to be by his side. The board’s medical representative, Dr. Rizwan Khan, continues to oversee his treatment.Providing an update from Canberra, India’s T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav said: “We spoke to him the first day we found out. He’s been replying to messages and talking normally, which means he’s doing fine. The doctors there are taking good care of him.”Medical experts describe a spleen laceration as a delicate and potentially fatal injury, as the spleen is one of the most vascular organs in the body. Internal bleeding can be severe, making rapid diagnosis and control crucial.Iyer, who scored 496 runs in 11 ODIs this year, is expected to remain under observation for at least a week and could miss India’s upcoming South Africa ODI series starting November 30.For now, though, cricket fans can exhale — Shreyas Iyer’s vitals are stable, the bleeding has been controlled, and his recovery in Sydney is progressing well.",India cricketer Shreyas Iyer is now stable after a frightening on-field injury.

NEW DELHI: Senior pacer Mohammed Shami on Tuesday reaffirmed his readiness for an India comeback, declaring that his “hard work is paying off” after a stunning performance for Bengal in the Ranji Trophy . The veteran fast bowler, who has been sidelined from national duties following ankle surgery, delivered a fiery spell to lead Bengal to a 141-run win over Gujarat at the Eden Gardens — a result that has reignited calls for his recall to the national side.“Grateful for the rhythm and hard work paying off. Always proud to represent my team,” Shami wrote on X, sharing photos from the match and the game ball — a subtle yet powerful message to critics and selectors alike.The 35-year-old pacer was at his vintage best, taking 5 for 38 in Gujarat’s second innings and finishing with eight wickets in the match. His figures marked his 13th five-wicket haul in first-class cricket and cemented his position among the top three wicket-takers in this Ranji season, with 15 wickets at 10.46 from just four innings.Speaking after the game, Shami said his motivation was simple: to stay fit and perform. “Every person wants to play for the country. So, I am ready for that again. My job is to stay fit and keep performing; the rest is in the selectors’ hands,” he said.The Eden Gardens win was particularly special — Bengal’s first Ranji victory over Gujarat since 2003 — and Shami’s devastating burst on the final day turned the match decisively.“It’s a relief, mentally and physically. Coming back after such a difficult time and still performing well shows that there’s plenty of cricket left in me,” he said.Shami, who was not selected for India’s recent white-ball tour of Australia, had been at the centre of a public spat with chief selector Ajit Agarkar over his fitness status. Agarkar claimed Shami wasn’t match-ready; the pacer responded sharply that updating selectors on fitness wasn’t his responsibility. His recent spell, however, seems to have done all the talking.Bengal head coach Laxmi Ratan Shukla hailed Shami’s effort, saying, “Mohammed Shami doesn’t need a certificate from anyone. His bowling is the certificate. He’s completely fit and in top rhythm.”","Mohammed Shami has been sidelined from national duties following ankle surgery.

Why Virat Kohli in India XI for World Cup 2027 will be bad news | Greenstone Lobo predicts

NEW DELHI: After Rohit Sharma 's explosive knock and India’s win over Australia in the third ODI, the batter’s childhood coach, Dinesh Lad, expressed his happiness on Saturday and revealed that the veteran opener will retire after playing the 2027 ICC Cricket World Cup.Rohit smashed his 50th international century in Sydney during the third ODI and finished as the top scorer in the recently concluded series against Australia.During India’s chase of 237, his power-packed 121* and partnership with long-time teammate Virat Kohli enthralled fans who had packed the stadium, possibly witnessing their final appearance together on Australian soil.""The way Rohit batted today and how he contributed to India's win -- it felt great to watch today's match. He will play the 2027 ODI World Cup and retire after that,"" Dinesh Lad said.Speaking about Virat, who bounced back with a rock-solid 74* after two successive ducks in Perth and Adelaide, Lad said there are frequent misconceptions about him.""There are misunderstandings about Virat everyday. He is someone who can thrive anytime and anywhere. The way he played today, it feels good. Sachin had said in a function way back that Rohit and Virat would be the players who would break his records.Both getting closer to his records feels really good,"" he added.Rohit was named both ‘Player of the Match’ and ‘Player of the Series’ for top-scoring in the series with 202 runs, including a century and a fifty.After entertaining fans at the Sydney Cricket Ground in the third ODI — a match that left many emotional and teary-eyed — Indian stalwarts Rohit and Virat are set to return for the upcoming ODI series against South Africa, beginning November 30.India and South Africa will play a three-match ODI series, with the first game scheduled for November 30 in Ranchi, followed by the second ODI on December 3 in Raipur, and the third and final match on December 6 in Visakhapatnam.",Dinesh Lad says Rohit Sharma will retire after the 2027 ICC Cricket World Cup.

What is Bronco Test? Will Rohit Sharma and Mohammed Shami be able to clear it? An expert explains!

NEW DELHI: In a rare show of collective dissent, several senior Indian cricketers — led by Mohammed Shami Ajinkya Rahane , and Karun Nair — have publicly voiced their frustration over the selection policies and communication gaps under chairman Ajit Agarkar ’s selection committee. From questions about transparency to age bias, the simmering tension between players and selectors has once again come to the fore.The spark came from Mohammed Shami, who dismissed the notion of his recent appearance for Bengal being a “comeback.” The veteran pacer, who claimed 5 for 38 in a commanding Ranji Trophy win, questioned the constant media narrative around his career and hinted at a lack of clarity from selectors. “When you call it a comeback match, I honestly don’t understand. Playing for Bengal always comes straight from the heart,” he said.Shami’s comments follow his earlier swipe at the selection panel after being excluded from India’s Test squad for the West Indies series. Agarkar had claimed Shami hadn’t played enough cricket post-surgery to be considered fit, but the 35-year-old hit back, saying “It’s not my job to give updates on fitness. My job is to play matches.” Since then, Shami’s form in domestic cricket has been blistering, his performances seemingly doing all the talking ahead of India’s South Africa tour.Meanwhile, Ajinkya Rahane, another senior pro, expressed disappointment over what he called “age-based selection” after scoring 159 for Mumbai against Chhattisgarh in the Ranji Trophy. “Age is just a number. It’s about intent and passion,” Rahane said, drawing parallels to Michael Hussey’s late but impactful Test career. He lamented the lack of communication from the selectors and stressed that his experience could have aided India during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy defeat in Australia.“I’ve been playing domestic cricket consistently for years, just like the selectors ask. Sometimes it’s not about runs, it’s about intent and experience,” he added, subtly reminding the selectors that consistency and seniority still hold value in red-ball cricket. Rahane also encouraged younger players like Sarfaraz Khan to “focus on controllables” amid the uncertainty surrounding team selection.Karun Nair, too, finds himself at odds with the system. Despite scoring 1,553 runs across the last two Ranji seasons for Vidarbha, he was overlooked for both the West Indies series and the India ‘A’ squad. “It’s quite disappointing, but I know I deserve to be there after the last two years I’ve had,” Nair said, adding that he had set personal goals to push his way back into contention.Even Shardul Thakur , while less confrontational, indirectly addressed the selection dynamics, noting that he’s eyeing a bowling all-rounder’s spot for the 2027 ODI World Cup. “Good performances will help in selection. I’m ready if asked to play tomorrow,” he said, signalling his intent to stay in the national frame.Taken together, these statements highlight a growing sentiment among experienced players that communication between selectors and cricketers has weakened, with performance and fitness updates often lost in translation. While Agarkar’s panel has prioritised youth and fitness consistency, veterans like Shami and Rahane believe experience and intent remain irreplaceable ingredients in India’s cricketing setup.",Several senior Indian cricketers have publicly voiced their frustration over the selection policies and communication gaps under chairman Ajit Agarkar ’s selection committee.

Kyle Dugger brings physicality, versatility and major starting experience

Steelers betting big on staying in the AFC race



The Pittsburgh Steelers wasted no time responding to the injury of DeShon Elliott, swooping in to acquire veteran safety Kyle Dugger from the New England Patriots in a deal that could reshape their secondary. New England receives a 2026 sixth-round pick and sends Dugger and a 2026 seventh-rounder to Pittsburgh in return, per multiple reports. It marks the Patriots' second defensive trade of the day after shipping pass rusher Keion White to the 49ers.For Steelers fans, this move feels like the front office refusing to let a key injury derail momentum. Elliott, who suffered a knee injury that leaves him “week-to-week,” will be placed on injured reserve. And as Mike Tomlin suggested earlier, the team had to make a move. They didn’t just make one. They made the right one.Dugger has long been a staple of New England’s defense, starting 69 of 81 games across five-plus seasons. Although his role shifted this year, he recently reclaimed starting duties in back-to-back games, signaling that the veteran still has plenty left to give.At 28, Dugger blends size and coverage ability with a linebacker-like presence near the box.Through seven appearances this season, he totaled 17 tackles and continued showcasing his trademark explosiveness in run defense. The Patriots clearly valued him recently too. Ahead of 2024, they signed him to a four-year, $58 million extension.That’s why this deal carries a touch of shock. You don’t often see playoff hopeful teams add a player with a premier contract who is still in his physical prime. The Steelers now inherit a proven defensive asset for a mid-round pick swap. That’s shrewd business.With the Colts up next, there is already “a chance Dugger will get the start,” according to reports. And if he hits the field right away, he could stabilize a safety group that needed help the moment Elliott went down.Meanwhile, New England’s defensive identity continues its shift under new leadership. Dugger becomes yet another Bill Belichick-era cornerstone moved out as the organization reshapes from the ground up.For now, Pittsburgh adds toughness, playoff experience and a player hungry for a fresh opportunity. And if Dugger becomes the glue that strengthens a resurgent Steelers defense, this trade could look like one of the most underrated deadline wins of the year.Also Read: Why the Patriots moved on from Keion White and why the 49ers think he’s worth the gamble",Pittsburgh Steelers have acquired veteran safety Kyle Dugger from the New England Patriots.

George Springer injury update: Blue Jays star’s status in doubt after MRI results ahead of Game 4,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/george-springer-injury-update-blue-jays-stars-status-in-doubt-after-mri-results-ahead-of-game-4/articleshow/124886530.cms,"George Springer walks off the field with manager John Schneider and assistant athletic trainer Voon Chong during the seventh inning of Game 3 of the World Series.

George Springer’s MRI results leave the Blue Jays cautious



Losing George Springer would be a serious blow to Toronto’s offense



Toronto Blue Jays slugger George Springer will miss a crucial Game 4 of the World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers after suffering a right-side injury in Monday night’s 18-inning marathon. Though the team has opted not to remove him from the World Series roster, uncertainty looms over his availability for the rest of the series as the Blue Jays fight to even things up at Dodger Stadium.George Springer’s injury occurred in the seventh inning of Game 3 when he fouled off a pitch and immediately clutched his right side in visible pain. He left the field accompanied by a trainer and was later diagnosed with “right side discomfort.” Despite fears of an oblique strain, the MRI did not reveal major damage — but his return remains a day-to-day decision.“MRI showed that he's hour-to-hour, day-to-day, so just see how he kind of navigates the next couple hours,” manager John Schneider said Tuesday before Game 4 (via Sportsnet). “Right now the options are either in the lineup or on the bench.”Springer, who was the first player to arrive at Dodger Stadium on Tuesday for treatment, reportedly did everything possible to test his readiness.Schneider noted, “Swinging will be the key to determining if he’s in there or not. He was the first one here… a lot of treatment, a lot of work, and George is going to do everything he can to be ready.”The Blue Jays are being cautious. Removing Springer from the roster would rule him out for the remainder of the series. For now, Bo Bichette will serve as the designated hitter, while Nathan Lukes leads off in Springer’s place.Springer’s absence is a massive setback for a Blue Jays team already trailing 2-1 in the series. The veteran outfielder has been among Toronto’s most consistent postseason performers, hitting .246 with four home runs and nine RBIs through 14 games. His power and experience have often fueled the team’s offense, including a clutch three-run homer in Game 7 of the ALCS against Seattle.“He plays for moments like this,” Schneider said. “Whenever this season’s over, you guys will be surprised to see kind of how much he has grinded physically. So yeah, if he's good to go in any way, shape, or form, I want George in.”Springer, 36, delivered one of his finest regular seasons with a .309 average, 32 home runs, and a team-leading 161 OPS+. A four-time All-Star and 2017 World Series MVP, he ranks third all-time in postseason home runs.While the Blue Jays remain hopeful for a late-series return, their championship hopes may hinge on how quickly Springer’s body responds in the coming days.Also Read: How much tax does Shohei Ohtani really have to pay?

Shane Bieber ends years of confusion confirming no family link to pop icon Justin Bieber

Shane Bieber prepares to pitch Game 4 in Toronto

Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Shane Bieber tackled the persistent speculation regarding his famous namesake, once again confirming that he has no familial connection to pop star Justin Bieber . This clarification came during the heightened excitement of Game 3 of the 2025 World Series, where Justin was seen at Dodger Stadium donning a custom Blue Jays jersey with Shane's name and number on it. This moment underscored their mutual admiration, even without any blood relation, as the Blue Jays went up against the Los Angeles Dodgers in a tough 18-inning showdown.Shane Bieber has consistently denied any connection to Justin Bieber, with his most recent clarification on October 28 highlighting this during the playoffs' attention. In a statement shared by Yahoo Sports Australia, Bieber mentioned, ""Folks, as fun as the alternative would be, I regret to inform you that Shane Bieber is not, in fact, related to Justin Bieber. There is no familial connection here whatsoever.""The mix-up has been around for years, but Bieber first joked about it publicly during MLB's Players Weekend in 2019. While playing for the Cleveland Guardians, he sported a custom jersey that said ""Not Justin"" on the back. Reflecting on the ongoing mix-ups, Bieber told MLB Network reporters at the time, ""I mean, I’ve been hearing it since college... A lot of people like to make the joke and try to mistake me for him.So, I thought I’d make it obvious and put it on the back of my jersey to let everyone know I’m not Justin Bieber. "" .Shane has also talked about how the jokes carry over to the field. In a tweet from 2019, he shared a picture of a baseball card that mistakenly labeled him as ""Justin Bieber,"" and he found the mix-up pretty funny. Opposing teams have even played Justin's songs like ""Baby"" while Shane is on the mound, which Bieber has referred to as ""fun"" in previous interviews.Game 3 happened at Dodger Stadium on October 27, 2025, with the Blue Jays behind 2-1 in the best-of-seven series. The Dodgers won 6-5 in the 18th inning, courtesy of a walk-off single from Mookie Betts, but it was a tense showdown where Shohei Ohtani smashed two home runs. Amidst the drama, Justin Bieber and his wife, Hailey Bieber, made an appearance as passionate supporters of Toronto, grabbing the spotlight in the stands.Justin, who hails from Stratford, Ontario and has been a Blue Jays fan for life, wore a powder-blue Shane Bieber No. 57 jersey over some baggy jeans, topped off with a maroon beanie. This outfit was a thoughtful homage, ""Justin wanted to represent the pitcher who shares his last name."" He debuted the jersey a day early, ahead of Shane's scheduled start in Game 4, calling it a ""cool gesture"" in coverage from the event.Bieber's energy was definitely noticeable. The cameras caught him giving a thumbs-down—some interpreted it as a single-finger salute—when Ohtani hit a homer in the third inning, putting the Dodgers up 2-0. He was cheering for the Blue Jays and taking photos with fans, but the couple got booed by the rowdy Dodgers crowd, which caused them to relocate to a private suite for their own safety. Hailey, wearing a laid-back gray hoodie, joined in the cheers, turning it into a rare public date night for the duo.With the series at 3-1 in favor of the Dodgers as of October 29, 2025, Shane Bieber is on the mound for Game 4 in Toronto. His mix of fastballs and curveballs, which has been a staple for Cleveland's rotation, might just shift the momentum back to the Jays. Analysts are optimistic that Bieber's experience will be a game-changer, possibly extending the Blue Jays' playoff adventure.Justin Bieber keeps teasing us with new music while also backing Toronto sports. Whether he's at the game or in the studio, his move at Dodger Stadium showed that namesakes can create real friendships. As the World Series plays out, the Bieber duo highlights that true connections are based on shared interests, not just family ties.Also Read: Shohei Ohtani becomes the only player in MLB postseason history to be intentionally walked four times in a single game","Shane Bieber has consistently denied any connection to Justin Bieber, with his most recent clarification on October 28 highlighting this during the playoffs' attention.

When Love Turns Lethal: Inside India’s Honeymoon Murders | The Silent Crisis No One Talks About





NEW DELHI: Amrita Chauhan knew exactly what to do. The 21-year-old forensics science graduate used her academic training not to solve a crime — but, as police allege, to cover one up.As her boyfriend lay dead in their Delhi flat, Amrita reportedly guided her new partner and his friend through a chilling clean-up: they poured ghee, oil, and even wine over the body, opened the gas cylinder, and set it alight. Moments later, the room erupted in flames — a fire meant to erase all evidence of a murder.It was a gruesome end to a relationship that had begun as an office romance just months earlier. When 32-year-old Ramkesh Meena met Amrita during a job interview in Noida this May, their connection was instant.They chatted, went for coffee, exchanged numbers, and soon began dating. By August, they had moved in together in a flat in Timarpur, Delhi.Their love grew intense — and impulsive. The couple began recording intimate moments together, unaware that those videos would later become the very spark of tragedy.Police say that by early September, cracks began to appear in their relationship. Amrita’s ex-boyfriend, Sumit Kashyap — a gas cylinder distributor from Moradabad — re-entered her life.The two, once social media collaborators, appeared to rekindle their romance. Ramkesh, increasingly sidelined, became withdrawn.While Amrita filled her Instagram feed with cheerful reels between September 8 and October 1, Ramkesh grew desperate.To win her back, he began sending her clips of their earlier intimate moments — a move investigators say crossed into blackmail.Furious, Amrita demanded the hard disk containing the videos so she could destroy them. When Ramkesh refused, police allege she conspired with Sumit to recover it by force.She soon moved in with Sumit at a rented house in Chhatarpur, and together they roped in his friend, Sandeep Kumar. The plan: stage a robbery at Ramkesh’s home to retrieve the device.On the night of October 6, Sumit and Sandeep arrived at Ramkesh’s house wearing masks. Police suspect Amrita had already tied and gagged him on the pretext of an intimate act.A struggle broke out, and Ramkesh was choked to death as the trio tried to force him to reveal the hard disk’s location.Realising what they had done, the trio set out to stage an accident. Amrita’s background in forensic science came into play — she allegedly advised on how to make the death appear like a gas explosion. Sumit, familiar with cylinders, handled the setup.They poured ghee, oil, and wine over the body, turned on the gas, and ignited it before locking the door through a mesh. Moments later, a blast ripped through the flat, setting it ablaze.Initially, police suspected an AC malfunction had caused the fire. But CCTV footage showing masked figures leaving the house, mobile phone location data, and sharp detective work soon exposed the truth.Amrita, Sumit, and Sandeep were arrested soon after. During questioning, each blamed the other.What began as a chance encounter between two young professionals ended in betrayal, death, and a coldly calculated cover-up — one that turned the tools of forensic science into the instruments of destruction.","Amrita Chauhan, 21, and Ramkesh Meena, 32, were found dead in their Delhi flat.

""What I heard was that he worked very hard for his game, and he was very talented. He was just very aggressive, and he did things his own way, so it was tough on him. He wanted to see himself through me, and he wanted me to play for India,"" Yuvraj shared.The 2011 World Cup hero chose to live with his mother, Shabnam Singh, when he was 17. He expressed deep appreciation for her sacrifices, stating, ""I think only a mother can make the sacrifices that my mom made to bring me up.

England’s greatest fast bowler, James Anderson, has officially been knighted for his extraordinary contributions to cricket, marking a fitting tribute to one of the most enduring and successful careers in sporting history. The 43-year-old was conferred the honour by Anne, Princess Royal, at Windsor Castle on Tuesday, after being named in former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s resignation honours list earlier this year.Anderson, who retired from Test cricket in July after a monumental 22-year international career, stands as the most successful fast bowler in Test history with 704 wickets — a record unmatched by any seamer. His remarkable journey began with his Test debut against Zimbabwe at Lord’s in 2003, and two decades later, he fittingly brought the curtain down on his storied career at the same venue.During his career, Anderson became synonymous with mastery of swing and seam, often dismantling batting line-ups with precision and patience. His control and longevity made him a cornerstone of England’s success across eras — from the early 2000s rebuild to the modern-day dominance under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum.In total, Anderson represented England in 188 Test matches, the most by any English player and second only to Sachin Tendulkar ’s 200 in world cricket. He also took 269 wickets in ODIs, another national record, and 18 wickets in 19 T20Is.Anderson joins an illustrious list of English cricketers to receive knighthood, including Sir Ian Botham, Sir Geoffrey Boycott, Sir Alastair Cook , and Sir Andrew Strauss . His long-time new-ball partner Stuart Broad was honoured with a CBE last year.“Arise, Sir James Anderson! A special day for @jimmy9 as he received his knighthood from Princess Anne at Windsor Castle. The greatest fast bowler to ever do it,” Lancashire Cricket wrote on X, celebrating the moment.Even in retirement, Anderson remains active in the domestic circuit and is in talks with Lancashire over a one-year extension for the 2026 season, continuing his deep connection with the game that made him a legend.From Burnley to Buckingham Palace, Anderson’s journey embodies cricketing greatness — a blend of skill, endurance, and humility that has earned him the title every English cricketer dreams of: Sir James Anderson.",James Anderson has been knighted for his contributions to cricket.

Heated press conferences: How India and Pakistan went at each other in Asia Cup 2025

Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf’s nightmare run of form has continued, as the fiery quick endured another forgettable outing in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, where he was taken apart by Sialkot’s rising batter Aashar Mehmood. Once hailed as Pakistan’s premier death bowler, Rauf’s struggles since the Asia Cup final disaster against India have now spilled over into the domestic circuit — raising serious doubts about his immediate international future.Rauf was among Pakistan’s most expensive bowlers in the Asia Cup final, conceding heavily as India snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. His wayward lengths and lack of control cost Pakistan dearly, and the selectors responded swiftly — dropping him from the T20I squad against South Africa and demoting him to the reserves.Looking to redeem himself, Rauf turned up for Islamabad Region in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy. However, things went from bad to worse as Sialkot’s Aashar Mehmood launched a brutal assault, smashing 73 off just 49 balls with 10 fours and 3 sixes, treating Rauf’s pace with disdain.Despite Rauf’s efforts to vary his line and length, Mehmood looked completely at ease, driving and lofting confidently against deliveries clocking well over 140 km/h. The Pakistan speedster ended the innings with 2 for 82 in 17 overs, and later managed 1 for 34 in 10 in the second — numbers that did little to repair his dented confidence.Sialkot went on to crush Islamabad by 311 runs, compounding the misery for Rauf and his team.",Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf has endured a nightmare run of form.

Jaxson Dart brings smiles as Superman at children’s hospital



Real heroes wear courage, not jerseys, always



Quarterbacks are often celebrated for their touchdowns and trophies, Jaxson Dart just earned applause for something far greater—his heart. The New York Giants’ rising star turned a simple Halloween visit into a moment of pure magic when he showed up at a local children’s hospital dressed as Superman. What followed was not just about costumes or candy, but about connection, courage, and the kind of heroism that doesn’t need a football field.The visit became an instant internet favorite after a young boy named Giuseppe shared the moment on his Instagram account, Giuseppe Strong. Dart, the Giants’ rookie sensation and former Ole Miss standout, was seen hugging Giuseppe in a heart-melting scene that quickly went viral. The caption described it as part of the hospital’s trick-or-treating fun, but the emotions behind it went far deeper.Giuseppe recognized Dart right away, his face lighting up as the quarterback flashed his million-dollar smile. The post drew thousands of reactions, including one that stood out from a Philadelphia Eagles fan who commented, “As an eagles fan, I love this guy.” When even rival fans are showing love, you know the moment has struck a chord.The NFL world has recently seen more of these acts of humanity. After Cam Skattebo’s season-ending ankle injury against the Eagles, their head of security, Dom DiSandro—affectionately called Big Dom—brought cheesesteaks and pizzas from Angelo’s to the hospital where the Giants’ star was recovering. It showed that compassion easily transcends rivalries.Giants backup quarterback Russell Wilson, who often visits children’s hospitals himself, once learned he was being benched for Dart during one such visit. It’s fitting, because players like Dart and Wilson seem to understand that perspective better than most.Seeing children like Giuseppe—brave, cheerful, and full of hope—reminds even the toughest athletes what real strength looks like. Sports may give us heroes on the field, but moments like these remind us who the true champions are.As Giuseppe’s post perfectly captured, Dart gave him “the best time” trick-or-treating. And perhaps without realizing it, the young quarterback reminded everyone that sometimes, being a superhero simply means showing up with kindness.Also Read: NFL trade deadline drama: Eagles’ AJ Brown at center of massive insider update and speculation","Jaxson Dart, the New York Giants’ rookie sensation, visited a children’s hospital dressed as Superman.

The rivalry lives on, even in retirement season

Kylie Kelce may no longer live with the week-to-week chaos of NFL season schedules, but the Philadelphia vs. Dallas rivalry is still very much alive in her household. The wife of retired Eagles legend Jason Kelce recently shared a hilarious warning for any young Cowboys fans thinking of stopping at their door this Halloween, proving that NFC East animosity truly never retires.During an appearance on the podcast Not Gonna Lie, Kylie was asked a very serious holiday question: What happens if a child dressed as a Cowboys player or cheerleader shows up trick-or-treating? Her response was pure Philadelphia energy.“If we receive trick-or-treaters, which we do not, hypothetically speaking, I would give every other kid a piece of candy, and then I would march my a-- to the kitchen and get a box of raisins and drop that right in that bag.”She wasn’t done. Kylie doubled down with the kind of ruthless accuracy that would make the Eagles defense proud.“Guys, raise your kids right. That’s the best advice I can give you. I’m not going to tell you how to parent your kids, but this is where I draw the line. Oh, maybe like an old avocado. I’d consider it. If you know, you know, there’s always at least one far-gone avocado in my kitchen. One. At any given time. Yeah, I stand by all that.Yup, that’s that.”Somewhere in Texas, Cowboys fans just gasped at the horror of raisins replacing Reese’s.Jason Kelce called it a career after a Hall of Fame-worthy run: seven Pro Bowls, six All-Pro selections, and a Super Bowl victory that will forever be part of Philadelphia lore. Meanwhile, Cowboys fans are still waiting for a return to the NFC Championship Game. The last time Dallas made it that far, Toy Story was the biggest movie of the year and DVDs were the peak of technology.That context makes Kylie’s Halloween stance feel like a loving jab across state lines. Football may be fun and games, but rivalries like this are the secret sauce that keeps fans invested all year long.As fall decorations go up and trick-or-treaters start planning their routes, one thing is clear: Cowboys costumes are not welcome at the Kelce doorstep. Unless you’re willing to trade your chocolate bars for a mushy avocado.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s songs reignite confusion about Joe Alwyn breakup and Travis Kelce romance timeline",Kylie Kelce is the wife of retired Eagles player Jason Kelce.

NFL trade deadline drama: Eagles’ A.J. Brown at center of massive insider update and speculation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-trade-deadline-drama-eagles-a-j-brown-at-center-of-massive-insider-update-and-speculation/articleshow/124886139.cms,"A.J. Brown Trade Rumors Cool Down as Eagles Reaffirm Team-First Mindset (Getty Images)

A.J. Brown’s trade talk hits pause amid growing team confidence



Eagles leadership doubles down on commitment to winning



The Philadelphia Eagles may be flying high in the NFC East, but one storyline continues to hover over their dominant season — the future of star wide receiver A.J. Brown. After missing Week 8 against the New York Giants with a hamstring injury, Brown has remained at the center of trade speculation as the deadline approaches. However, a recent update from trusted NFL insiders has all but silenced the rumors.A.J. Brown’s occasional frustration with his usage and target share has fueled ongoing debates about his long-term fit in Philadelphia’s offense. The Eagles’ identity often leans on a strong ground game led by Jalen Hurts and, at times, a featured running back like Saquon Barkley. That balance occasionally limits Brown’s opportunities, sparking speculation that the team could explore trade options for future draft capital.However, ESPN’s Adam Schefter set the record straight during The Adam Schefter Podcast, saying, “One move I’m not expecting; I’m not expecting A.J. Brown to be traded, despite all the conversation.” His comments suggest the Eagles remain committed to keeping their star receiver in the fold as they push for another deep postseason run.Before his injury, Brown was electric — posting 121 yards and two touchdowns on just four catches in his best outing of the season.Yet inconsistency has been his biggest challenge, with two games this year where he failed to surpass 10 receiving yards. That uneven rhythm mirrors a broader offensive theme, as DeVonta Smith has also seen fluctuating production.Amid all the noise, Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie made it crystal clear how the franchise views any potential trade scenario. When asked by The Athletic’s Dianna Russini what he would do if Brown requested a trade, Lurie’s answer reflected the team’s unwavering priorities: “We do what’s best for the team,” he said. “We don’t even consider it seriously unless it’s best for the Eagles. We will always do what gives us the best chance of winning big. Everything else is secondary.”That response echoes Philadelphia’s championship mindset — stability over speculation. With Brown expected to return after the bye, the focus now shifts to restoring his health and reigniting chemistry with Hurts. The Eagles know that a fully engaged A.J. Brown is one of the most dangerous offensive weapons in the league — and a crucial key to keeping their Super Bowl dreams alive.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s rare game appearance with Brittany Mahomes steal the spotlight as Travis Kelce scores big in Chiefs victory over Commanders","Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver A.J.

Rick Tocchet’s lineup decisions raise eyebrows as Philadelphia Flyers seek consistency



“We’ve got to find a way to get him out there more. He brings a different kind of energy.”

How Rick Tocchet’s lineup shake-up could shape the Philadelphia Flyers’ season



The Philadelphia Flyers are shaking things up ahead of Tuesday night’s NHL Frozen Frenzy showdown against the Pittsburgh Penguins at Wells Fargo Center. In what’s shaping up to be one of the more talked-about lineup decisions of the early season, head coach Rick Tocchet is rolling out a few unexpected changes — including a goaltending switch, a notable benching, and yet another adjustment on the blue line. The Flyers are searching for consistency as they face a red-hot Penguins team sitting near the top of the Metropolitan Division at 7-2-1.On Tuesday morning, the Philadelphia Flyers confirmed that Sam Ersson will get the start in goal, giving Dan Vladar an extended rest after his solid showing last Thursday against the Ottawa Senators, where he stopped 31 of 33 shots. Tocchet’s decision to go with Ersson, who has had an uneven start to the season, signals a move to keep the goaltending tandem fresh amid a demanding stretch of games.More surprising, however, is the change among the skaters. Nikita Grebenkin will sit out in favor of Nick Deslauriers, despite Tocchet’s repeated insistence that he wants to get the 21-year-old Russian forward more ice time. Tocchet made those comments last week in Voorhees, saying,That message now rings hollow with Grebenkin watching from the press box.While the young winger’s performance hasn’t been flawless — he ranks 19th out of 22 Flyers skaters in 5-on-5 expected goals percentage (45.82%), per Natural Stat Trick — the move feels like a step backward for player development.This decision also comes just one day after Jett Luchanko was returned to the OHL, a move made, according to team officials, “to ensure he plays bigger minutes.” It raises questions about the Flyers’ handling of young talent, especially given the team’s stated emphasis on building through youth.Defensively, the revolving door continues. Egor Zamula will replace Adam Ginning on the third pairing, marking yet another shuffle on the blue line. Ginning had appeared to solidify his spot before Zamula began chipping away at his minutes. Tocchet has been clear that the competition for that final defensive slot “remains open,” and Tuesday’s lineup confirms it.The Flyers, currently 4-5-1 in their last ten meetings with Pittsburgh, have been outscored 39-31 in that span. The Penguins have emerged as an early-season force, making this Keystone State matchup a critical test for a Flyers squad still trying to find its identity.As Philadelphia looks to rebound and establish a consistent rhythm, Tocchet’s decisions ahead of Tuesday’s game may define more than just one night. Whether it’s Ersson’s opportunity to reclaim confidence, Zamula’s push for defensive trust, or Grebenkin’s puzzling benching, every move carries weight. Against a surging rival in Pittsburgh, the Flyers aren’t just fighting for two points — they’re fighting for direction.Also Read: Toronto Maple Leafs line changes: Sammy Blais Set for Season Debut vs. Calgary Flames","Philadelphia Flyers head coach Rick Tocchet is making some surprising lineup decisions.
