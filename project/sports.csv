Rohit Sharma Unplugged: Funniest Press Conference Moments

India's Test cricket captain Rohit Sharma announced his immediate retirement on Wednesday at the age of 37. His final appearance was during the fourth Test against Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, which resulted in a defeat. He was subsequently dropped for the fifth Test as India lost the series 1-3.Sharma took over the Test captaincy in 2021 following Virat Kohli 's resignation. His tenure began with a two-match series against Sri Lanka, and he led India to the World Test Championship final in the 2021/23 cycle, where they ultimately lost to Australia.The initial phase of Sharma's captaincy showed promise with successful campaigns. He secured a series victory in the West Indies and followed it with a commanding 4-1 triumph over England in 2024.However, his later tenure faced significant challenges. A 0-3 home series loss to New Zealand and a 1-3 defeat in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia created mounting pressure. His retirement comes before India's upcoming five-match Test series in England scheduled for June.Under Sharma's leadership, India played 24 Test matches, winning 12, losing 9, and drawing 3. His captaincy record includes notable series victories against Sri Lanka (2-0 at home), Bangladesh (2-0 away), and Australia (2-1 at home).The team also achieved positive results against West Indies (1-0 away win) and drew 1-1 with South Africa away from home. A significant highlight was the 4-1 victory over England at home, followed by another 2-0 success against Bangladesh at home.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Sharma's batting performance showed distinct patterns during his captaincy period. As captain, he scored 1,254 runs in 24 matches at an average of 30.58, including four centuries. In comparison, his record before captaincy showed 3,047 runs in 43 matches at a higher average of 46.87, with eight centuries.His series results as captain demonstrate a mixed record of success and setbacks. The initial victories against Sri Lanka and Bangladesh set a positive tone, while the World Test Championship final loss to Australia marked a significant disappointment.The comprehensive victory over England in 2024 represented a high point in his captaincy. However, the subsequent losses to New Zealand at home and Australia away proved challenging. Notably, Sharma did not captain India during their victory in the first Test in Perth against Australia.His retirement marks the end of a significant chapter in Indian cricket, with reports suggesting Shubman Gill as the likely successor to the Test captaincy role.","India's Test cricket captain Rohit Sharma announced his immediate retirement on Wednesday at the age of 37.

Rohit Sharma Unplugged: Funniest Press Conference Moments

Rohit Sharma on Wednesday announced his retirement from Test cricket.Rohit's last Test appearance was in Melbourne during the fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. However, for the fifth Test in Sydney, Rohit dropped himself.“I spoke to the coach and the selector, and they kind of agreed, well, there was an argument around it,” Rohit told former Australian captain Michael Clarke during the Beyond23 Cricket podcast.“I had to be honest with myself. I wasn’t hitting the ball well. I didn’t want to put myself there only because we had dropped the other guys who were struggling as well.“I didn’t have a great game (in Adelaide). Then I went back to the room, and I was like, I should have opened, man. I would rather fail doing what I do and where I do it. That’s my place, that’s my position. I would rather go there and bat, whether I get success or not, it’s a different story. But I’m in my natural position for the team,” he told Clarke.Rohit had struggled in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series in Australia, which India lost 3-1. He averaged just 6.20 in five innings and also dropped himself for the final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Before that, Rohit had a forgettable time in India’s 3-0 home series defeat to New Zealand, averaging just 15.16.However, back then in Australia, Rohit had said that he had no immediate plans to retire and that he believed he could turn around his form.“I have come from such a long distance; I have not come here to sit outside or to not play the match,"" Rohit had told Star Sports in Sydney.""I have to play and make the team win, and from the first day when I came to the dressing room in 2007 till now, I have been thinking that I have to make the team win.""But sometimes you have to understand what is the need of the team. If you do not put the team first, then there is no use. That is why we call it a team, because eleven people are playing, not one person or two people; eleven people are playing, so it is a team. Whatever is the cost to the team, try to do that.”Rohit's career batting average was 40.57 across his 67 Test matches, including 12 hundreds and 18 half centuries.India are due to face England in a five-Test series this summer, starting at Headingley on June 20.",Rohit Sharma announced his retirement from Test cricket on Wednesday.

The Boston Red Sox have taken a daring step to solve their first base problem. The Red Sox are signing veteran first baseman Anthony Rizzo, who played last for the arch-rival New York Yankees, reports The Athletic. The move follows just days after Boston lost Triston Casas to a severe knee injury. Anthony Rizzo is bringing experience, leadership, and Gold Glove-level defense to a young Red Sox roster struggling to remain competitive in the AL East.Following the loss of Triston Casas to a ruptured left patellar tendon, the Red Sox had a large void to fill at first base. Triston Casas was injured on Friday attempting to beat out an infield single and was put on the injured list on Saturday.

Anthony Rizzo was initially drafted by Boston in 2007 before he was traded away. The 34-year-old Anthony Rizzo comes with a wealth of experience after playing in the 2024 World Series with New York and earlier assisting the Cubs to win a title in 2016.Though his bat isn't what it used to be he batted a mere.224 with eight home runs and a.637 OPS last season. Anthony Rizzo is still a good defender. He might take a little time to get rid of rust before diving into everyday work, but his glove and leadership should serve Boston immediately.Anthony Rizzo's signing indicates that Boston is not ready to give up on the playoff chase even without Casas. Although internal solutions such as Gonzalez provide some flexibility, Anthony Rizzo provides a genuine first baseman's glove and veteran leadership.His return to the Red Sox is almost two decades since the team originally drafted him. The signing also creates intrigue for future Yankees.

Rohit Sharma’s Final Test Practice: Exclusive Farewell Visuals

Rohit Sharma Unplugged: Funniest Press Conference Moments

Indian cricket’s senior statesman Rohit Sharma announced his retirement from Test cricket on Wednesday, closing the chapter on a distinguished red-ball career that spanned over a decade. The 38-year-old made the announcement via an Instagram story, writing, ""Hello everyone, I would just like to share that I am retiring from Test cricket. It's been an absolute honour to represent my country in whites. Thank you for all the love and support over the years.""The decision follows speculation over his place in the Indian Test side, particularly with the five-match series in England on the horizon. As reported by TOI earlier this week, the BCCI was already considering a change in leadership, and Rohit's Test selection was no longer guaranteed.Rohit, however, clarified that he will continue to be available for selection in the ODI format. The veteran opener had earlier retired from T20Is after leading India to a title win in the 2024 ICC T20 World Cup, ending the nation’s 13-year drought in ICC tournaments.Rohit’s Test career began in 2013, and he went on to play 67 matches, scoring 4,301 runs at an average of 40.6, including 12 centuries and 18 fifties. His highest score was a masterful 212. Known for his elegance and timing, Rohit matured into a dependable opener in the latter half of his career.His recent Test form, however, was underwhelming. In his last nine Tests, he averaged just 10.93. During the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, he even opted to drop himself for the Sydney Test, saying, “I have to be honest to myself… I wasn’t hitting the ball well.”Australia went on to win that match and reclaim the Border-Gavaskar Trophy 3-1.With his whites now hung up, Rohit’s legacy will continue in the shorter formats—where his leadership and batting remain invaluable.","Rohit Sharma has announced his retirement from Test cricket.

Michael McLeod defense questions David Humphrey complainant's version of events



""They were laughing at me"": Female complainant tells the jury at world juniors sex assault trial

The trial of five former players of Canada's 2018 World Junior Championship squad, including now-former NHL player Michael McLeod , escalated into a contentious phase on Tuesday as defense counsel David Humphrey resumed his cross-examination of the complainant. The female complainant, identified only by the initials E.M. for reasons of a court-ordered publication ban, claims she was sexually assaulted inside a London, Ontario hotel room following a Hockey Canada gala last June.Michael McLeod, along with Carter Hart, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dube, and Cal Foote, have entered not guilty pleas to one charge of sexual assault. Michael McLeod has a second charge of sexual assault as a party to the offence.David Humphrey, acting for Michael McLeod, concentrated considerably on E.M.'s memory of that night's events—specifically at Jack's Bar, where she met McLeod and other players. Humphrey alluded to a man, Matt Maccarone, a bar customer and support figure; a police detective had testified earlier about a man who had talked favorably about McLeod. Asked if he had heard anything concerning McLeod being ‘an elite player’, E.M. said she had not, remembering instead that Maccarone had characterized him as ""a good guy"" who had money.Security video from the nightclub dance floor was shown during the session, with Humphrey pointing out frames where E.M. seems to put her hand on McLeod's crotch voluntarily. Although E.M. admitted to that incident, she maintained that team members had manipulated her hand in similar manners throughout the evening, making it difficult for her to know what she was consenting to.“They made it seem like it was fine, and with the amount I had to drink, I thought I’d go along with it. I thought maybe I should feel flattered and not question it too much.” said E.M.Humphrey asked further why E.M. didn't leave the bar or McLeod, to which she replied, “I've always had a hard time saying no to people.”Additional attention was paid to two video recordings inside the hotel room, at 3:25 a.m. and 4:26 a.m., during which E.M. can be heard stating that the acts were consensual. Humphrey relied on this evidence to challenge her credibility, but E.M. insisted that her consent then was influenced by pressure and alcohol consumption, claiming McLeod only sought verbal confirmation at the point of filming.“I didn't feel like I had a choice,"" she reaffirmed in testimony, describing the tone of the evening changed significantly after the videos. Asked about her earlier assertions regarding ‘rude’ conduct, she testified McLeod uttered a dismissive comment: “Are you leaving anytime soon?”Also read: The jury saw the surveillance footage of hockey players from the 2018 Hockey Canada sexual assault scandal Humphrey finished up his cross-examination by challenging the complainant's romantic involvement at the time, inferring that she acted out of guilt feelings over having cheated on her boyfriend.

1. Something big is being planned for the “Big Dog”

Paul Heyman WrestleMania 41 highlights | Betrayal of CM Punk and Roman Reigns

2. Reigns might be injured

3. Roman might deal with Rollins alone

Paul Heyman aligns with Seth Rollins, BETRAYING CM Punk and Roman Reigns: WrestleMania 41 highlights

After getting betrayed by his “Wiseman” Paul Heyman, the “OTC” Roman Reigns retaliated on the first RAW episode after WrestleMania 41 by attacking Seth Rollins. But in a monumental shock, he was in for a huge surprise as Bron Breakker emerged to be the new disciple of the Wiseman and pulverized Roman, before doing the same with CM Punk(who was also betrayed by Heyman at WrestleMania).Then on this weeks’ RAW, Seth Rollins challenged Jey Uso for the World Heavyweight Championship the world anticipated for Roman to come back and do something about it. But instead it was Punk who saved the day for the “Yeet” master.Let’s explore the reasons and repercussions of Roman Reigns absence from Raw this weekRoman Reigns has constantly been in action over the last six months, after he came back from a hiatus following his defeat at WrestleMania 40. He even main evented WrestleMania 41, night one. In that match, he was backstabbed by his Wiseman Paul Heyman who decided to side with his arch nemesis Seth Rollins. Following that he made an appearance on the next RAW episode, where he was annihilated by the brand-new duo of Rollins and Bron Breakker, under the guidance of Heyman. Now it is being murmured around that Roman and Punk are gonna team up against the team of Rollins and Breakker, possibly at SummerSlam. So to build that match up, Roman might have taken a sabbatical from WWE TV.There were also rumors that the “Head of the Table” might have suffered minor injuries during either of the WrestleMania main event or the RAW episode in which he appeared. To nurse that injury he might have taken a rest of week or two. Since he would have been required in some kind of action on RAW, WWE might be circumspect with Roman, as he is one of the biggest stars and crowd pullers in the WWE currently.Although Heyman betrayed both Punk and Reigns on the same night, when he decided to help Rollins through a steel chair, there might be plans by the WWE management to put Rollins against Roman separately. Reigns not being a part of the RAW segment involving Rollins, Punk and Breakker also indicates the same. Therefore, Reigns might be utilized to have a one on one storyline against one of Seth or Breakker going ahead.","Roman Reigns has been absent from WWE TV for the last six months.

Rafael Devers shifting to first could open the door for Nolan Arenado at third

Cardinals have leverage, and Chaim Bloom’s Boston ties could shape the deal

Just as the Boston Red Sox were starting to gain some momentum in their playoff chase, the bottom fell out. Slugger first baseman Triston Casas was lost for the season with a knee injury suffered in a collision at first base, leaving a hole to fill in the infield and in the batting order. Now, as the front office looks to get off the mat somehow, one name has resurfaced — Nolan Arenado. The St. Louis Cardinals have been trying to trade the veteran third baseman, and the Red Sox, suddenly in need of infield help, may finally be a match.So rather than stand pat for the next few seasons, as top prospect Triston Casas (currently held back by a sprained thumb) plays his way up to the majors, the Red Sox could fast-track a maneuver that’s been whispered about inside the team for some time. Devers has been competent at third, but he has never been a defensive secret, and moving him over to first could both help the team’s collective glove work and extend his career. That would, of course, open up third base — where Arenado would fit perfectly.He had a tough year in 2024, but the veteran Gold Glover is making a comeback in 2025, and he still provides imposing defensive value and leadership. He was in his prime, but he has the potential to bolster any lineup. For the Red Sox, Arenado would represent a pure stopgap solution, but could also represent a longer-term fix at the hot corner.Any deal involving Arenado will come with financial considerations. The Cardinals are reportedly insistent that any team trading for him absorb a significant chunk of his remaining contract. With the Red Sox now in need and willing to compete, St. Louis might find itself in a rare position of leverage.The potential deal is complicated by the presence in the Cardinals’ front office of Chaim Bloom. Bloom had previously headed Boston’s baseball operations and had played a big part in drafting and developing many of their current prospects. His knowledge of Boston’s farm system could also expedite conversations and close valuation gaps. It might not just be speculation: An Arenado-to-Boston blockbuster could happen if the stars align.Also Read: Red Sox’s Alex Bregman is one swing away from joining the 200 HR club","The St. Louis Cardinals have been trying to trade the veteran third baseman, and the Red Sox may finally be a match.

Thesuffered a shocking overtime loss to the New York Knicks in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals, and’ sudden exit played a major role. Now, with Game 2 looming, fans are eager to know if the Latvian center will return to the court.Kristaps Porzingis left Game 1 in the second quarter due to an illness, finishing with zero points in just 13 minutes. His absence allowed the Knicks to exploit Boston’s lack of size, fueling their 20-point comeback and eventual overtime win.The latest injury report lists Porzingis as probable for tonight’s game, meaning he is likely to play. Known for his toughness, Porzingis has played through injuries before—like in the first round when he returned from a forehead laceration to post a 20-point double-double.Head coach Joe Mazzulla hinted that this illness might be the same one that sidelined Porzingis for eight games late in the regular season.While Porzingis’ return is encouraging, his condition will be closely monitored.Losing Game 1 at home was a major setback for Boston. Another loss tonight would put them in a dangerous 0-2 hole before heading to New York.What the Boston Celtics need to fix:- Better defensive presence without Porzingis (if he’s limited).- More consistency from Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.- Containing Jalen Brunson, who dropped 43 points in Game 1.All signs point to yes.

Rohit Sharma’s Final Test Practice: Exclusive Farewell Visuals

Rohit Sharma Unplugged: Funniest Press Conference Moments

In a remarkable coincidence that has stirred the sentiments of Indian cricket fans, both MS Dhoni and Rohit Sharma announced their retirements at the exact same time—19:29 IST. The uncanny symmetry doesn’t end there. Both legends played their final home Test at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium and wrapped up their red-ball careers with a last appearance in Melbourne.Rohit Sharma, 38, announced his retirement from Test cricket via Instagram on Wednesday evening. ""It’s been an absolute honour to represent my country in whites. Thank you for all the love and support over the years,"" he wrote. This comes on the heels of a TOI report suggesting that Rohit was not a guaranteed pick for the upcoming Test series in England, with the BCCI eyeing a new leadership direction.The timing, 19:29, instantly drew parallels with Dhoni’s own quiet exit from International cricket in 2020. Then, too, Dhoni’s retirement statement was issued at 19:29.Rohit’s Test career ends with 4301 runs in 67 matches, including 12 centuries, and a captaincy record of 9 wins in 14 Tests. While he struggled for form in the recent Border-Gavaskar series, even dropping himself for Gill in Sydney, his overall leadership impact was undeniable.Quiz : Who's that IPL player? However, the 38-year-old, who led India to the Champions Trophy triumph, maintained he will continue to play ODI cricket.From Wankhede to Melbourne, and from 19:29 to 19:29, Indian cricket once again bows out a leader with poise, dignity and perfect timing.","Both MS Dhoni and Rohit Sharma announced their retirements at the exact same time.

Alex Bregman's scorching start in Boston has plopped him back amidst the league leaders

Red Sox ready for moment as Alex Bregman nears milestone

Alex Bregman has gotten off to a quick and impressive start to his Boston Red Sox career, and now he's only one big swing away from hitting a significant milestone. With 199 career home runs after homering last Friday, the veteran third baseman is just one away from joining the elite 200-home run club, a feat only 318 players in MLB history have achieved before him.Alex Bregman has been one of Boston's best hitters this year. He's hit several home runs, driven in a good amount of runs, and has one of the best batting forms of his life. If the season ended today, his batting average would be the highest in his career, and his on-base and slugging numbers would be his best since the year 2019, when he was the AL MVP runner-up.In his tenth year in the majors, Alex Bregman proved himself as Boston's best-hitting option. That dependability was welcomed early in the year when star third baseman Rafael Devers struggled from the beginning. Alex Bregman's clutch hitting hasn't gone unrecognized, with manager Alex Cora calling Bregman consistent and a leader.The 31-year-old isn’t in the MVP race this year, but he’s providing veteran stability and power in the middle of Boston’s lineup. Home run No. 200 is more than just a number; it's a symbol of Alex Bregman’s long-term success and the new life he’s found in a Red Sox uniform. With eight homers already, he’s on pace for his best power season since the shortened 2020 campaign.Alex Bregman can reach the milestone today when the Red Sox host the Texas Rangers. The Rangers will send right-hander Tyler Mahle to the hill, and the first pitch is scheduled for 6:45 p.m. E.T.Fans and teammates, as well, will be paying attention. When that 200th home run hits, it'll be more than a statistic; this will be a testament to the type of player that Alex Bregman is still, and how much he's meant to Boston so far in 2025.Also Read: “Loving The Newborn Phase”- Alex Bregman’s Wife And New Mama Reagan Elizabeth Feels Thankful About Motherhood",Alex Bregman is one swing away from joining the elite 200-home run club.

FOX Sports tweet sets GTA vibes with flashy new NFL poster drop

When Rockstar drops even a whiff of GTA news, the whole internet lights up. So naturally, with GTA 6 trailer buzz back in full swing, FOX Sports decided to ride the wave, dropping a flashy, comic-book-style NFL poster that looks like it was pulled straight out of Vice City. But while the visuals had fans hyped, it didn’t take long for the conversation to shift. Not about who was in the poster but who wasn’t.The poster is a visual treat. Clearly inspired by GTA’s iconic promo art, it features stylized versions of several NFL stars surrounded by city skylines, neon colors, and gritty video-game energy. Josh Allen, Tyreek Hill , Justin Jefferson , CeeDee Lamb, and Ja’Marr Chase are all front and center, looking like they belong in a mission briefing.It’s a clever blend of sports culture and gaming aesthetic, dropped at just the right time with GTA 6 Trailer 2 release. And while the GTA angle got props, it wasn’t long before fans were asking the one question that derailed the hype:Where. Is. Mahomes?Fan reactions go wild over Patrick Mahomes ’ absence and player choicesFOX probably expected fire emojis and retweets. Instead, they got roasted. Here’s just a glimpse of what NFL fans had to say:Sure, there were compliments, some called the design clean, others said it was fire. But once people realized the Super Bowl MVP wasn’t on the poster along with many others, everything shifted.Leaving out Mahomes is kind of wild. He’s the NFL’s biggest name right now, a generational QB with two Super Bowl wins and the face of the league for the past five years. His jersey sells out everywhere. He’s in every State Farm commercial. And when it comes to winning, no one’s been more dominant.Also read - Olivia Ponton dodges Joe Burrow dating rumors after F1 Miami appearance sparks wild internet speculation So how did FOX Sports leave him out of a “star players” lineup?

Because when you play with GTA aesthetics, you should expect a little chaos. But leaving out Mahomes? That’s the kind of choice that sparks a Twitter war.","FOX Sports released a GTA-inspired NFL poster with the release of the GTA 6 trailer.

Martin Brundle speaks out

“I think he (Verstappen) knows that there’s something a bit more street fighter about Oscar Piastri, he saw it in Jeddah.”

“I think Max knows he’s got a different animal when Oscar’s in his mirrors, not by much, than Lando. Just (in terms of the) positioning of the car, there’s a decisiveness about what he did (overtaking Verstappen in Miami).”

“You can’t criticise Lando’s race craft because the way he passed the Mercedes and eventually Max was just top drawer. But I have absolutely no doubt, and just what he says as well, that Max realises Oscar’s a different deal in wheel to wheel combat.”

Zak Brown dials Max Verstappen

“Oh yes, about that call… It is my job to explore the market and to know what is going on.”

“We have to remember that at that time I was also negotiating a new contract with my own driver [Piastri].""

“I want to be able to estimate whether a possible stone may fall, which can cause a domino effect. Because that could rekindle interest in my driver. That’s the reason I inquired. I’m a happy camper.”

“Yes, but I think that didn’t last long, When he knew how much he would have to pay, it was over immediately.”

While the two McLaren drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris, are racing against each other, the F1 ace driver with Red Bull, Max Verstappen has very carefully understood who he has to fight.

While he remains calm behind his wheels, F1 World Champion Max Verstappen has been rallying behind, and it is important for him to understand who his actual threat is.Oscar Piastri has the fastest car, and there is no doubt about that. He has overtaken Max Verstappen while everybody else on the grid is just struggling behind.Martin Brundle, speaking on Sky Sports, regarding Max Verstappen’s different approach towards Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris, said he approaches the two differently.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Steelers boost star power with DK Metcalf and George Pickens — Yet Robert Woods signing leaves doubts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/steelers-boost-star-power-with-dk-metcalf-and-george-pickens-yet-robert-woods-signing-leaves-doubts/articleshow/120968679.cms,"Steelers sign DK Metcalf, George Pickens, and Robert Woods (Image via: Getty Images)

Will Robert Woods be the fix for Steelers' young offense?



Steelers reportedly trading WR George Pickens to Cowboys | Pro Football Talk | NFL on NBC

The Pittsburgh Steelers shook up their offseason by trading for DK Metcalf , pairing him with the explosive George Pickens to create a formidable receiving duo. However, while the top of the depth chart shines, the bottom remains a concern. Enter Robert Woods coming off his worst season yet. At 32, can he really provide the depth the Steelers need, or is Pittsburgh’s gamble on Woods a sign of a bigger problem?Instead of using the 2025 NFL Draft to address a thin wide receiver corps, the Steelers went a different route.They selected quarterback Will Howard and running back Kaleb Johnson as their only offensive picks leaving out a rookie receiver or any real development on the depth chart. The team is clearly placing its trust in Metcalf and Robert Woods to carry the load. But is that a smart bet?Signing the 32-year-old Woods to a one-year, $2 million deal may seem low-risk, but it raises more questions than answers. After all, Woods is coming off the worst season of his 12-year career with just 20 catches, 203 yards, and zero touchdowns. On a Texans team ravaged by injuries, Woods still couldn’t make an impact. That’s not a bad year, it’s a decline.Still, Pittsburgh is hoping Woods can provide veteran leadership and solid run-blocking, shoring up a fragile receiver room. But this move feels more like desperation than a strategic play. With Calvin Austin III still unproven, and limited options beyond Metcalf and Pickens, is Woods really the answer?Also Read: Why trading George Pickens to Dallas could backfire spectacularly Arthur Smith’s offense values physicality and veteran know-how, but relying on Woods, who hasn’t scored in over a year, feels like patching up a much bigger problem. The Steelers had a chance to inject some youthful energy into the position during the draft but chose to roll the dice on a veteran who might be past his prime. If Woods can turn back the clock and make an impact, it will be a welcome surprise. This move is more of a gamble than the Steelers are willing to admit. As they chase playoff contention, the weight of this decision could make or break their chances.","Pittsburgh Steelers signed Robert Woods to a one-year, $2 million deal.

Cardinals enter Sistine Chapel to start centuries-old secret ritual to elect a pope,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/cardinals-enter-sistine-chapel-to-start-centuries-old-secret-ritual-to-elect-a-pope/articleshow/120980628.cms,"AP File Photo





VATICAN CITY: With all pomp, drama and solemnity that the Catholic Church can muster, 133 cardinals Wednesday began the secretive, centuries-old ritual to elect a successor to Pope Francis, opening the most geographically diverse conclave in the faith’s 2,000-year history.Two by two, the cardinals entered Sistine Chapel chanting “Litany of the Saints” as Swiss Guards stood at attention. The hymn implores the saints to help the cardinals find a new leader of the 1.4 billionstrong Catholic Church. They bowed before the altar and took their places before taking an oath of secrecy and shutting Sistine Chapel doors to start the conclave.Earlier, the dean of the College of Cardinals, cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, presided over a morning mass urging voters to set aside all personal interests and find a pope who prizes unity. The world today needs a leader who can awaken consciences, he said.Hailing from 70 countries, the cardinals have been sequestered from the outside world until they find a new leader. Francis named 108 of the 133 “princes of the church”, choosing many pastors from farflung countries that had never had a cardinal before.His decision to surpass the usual limit of 120 cardinal electors and include younger ones from the “global south” — often marginalised countries with lower economic clout — has injected an unusual degree of uncertainty in a process that is full of suspense, with smoke signals telling the world if a pope has been elected or not.Many cardinals hadn’t met one another until last week and lamented they needed more time to get to know each another, raising questions about how long it might take for one man to secure the two-thirds majority needed to become the 267th pope. While cardinals are supposed to resist any “secular” influences in their choice, such lobbying abounded in Rome in recent days .Many challenges face the new pope and weigh on the cardinals — above all whether to continue Francis’ progressive legacy on several issues or roll it back to try to unify a polarised church. Since Francis chose 80% of the voters, continuity is likely, but the form it might take is uncertain.","133 cardinals begin the secretive, centuries-old ritual to elect a successor to Pope Francis.

What’s the tile game Meghan Markle played on Netflix? A beginner’s guide to mahjong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/whats-the-tile-game-meghan-markle-played-on-netflix-a-beginners-guide-to-mahjong/articleshow/120736644.cms,"Meghan Markle played the game of Mahjong in her Netflix series

From the Qing dynasty to pop culture

How is mahjong played?

Connor Wan, a 29-year-old British-Chinese artist, learned mahjong while visiting family in Hong Kong. He enjoyed it so much that he started the Four Winds Mahjong Club in London, and later brought it to Toronto after moving there in 2024. “Moving countries is hard, especially when you don’t know anyone,” he said. The club became popular quickly, not as a place for gambling, but for making friends and celebrating Asian culture. Nicole Wong, a writer and audio producer from California, started playing mahjong as a teenager with her grandparents. She later began The Mahjong Project in 2019 to share the game’s cultural stories and organise pop-up game nights. This year, she published a book called Mahjong: House Rules from Across the Asian Diaspora. Nicole says the sound of the tiles is especially powerful. “Mahjong is more than just fun,” she says. “It has a deep history and brings back strong memories.” In Toronto, Robyn Feldberg has taught over 250 people how to play mahjong through her courses. She donates all the money—about $50,000 so far—to charities like Save A Child’s Heart. She says the game is especially popular with young mothers who want a fun way to relax and connect with others. “They tell me, ‘We want something that’s just for us,’” she said.

A centuries-old Chinese game called mahjong is having a modern revival across continents, from luxury cruise ships and trendy hotel lounges to Meghan Markle’s Netflix series.In the sixth episode of her docuseries With Love, the Duchess of Sussex invites friends for a cosy game night – playing mahjong, reports the Globe and Mail.The four-person tile-based game, traditionally associated with Chinese culture, is now catching on with new generations across the globe. “The game itself is really so fun,” says Markle. “But what was so great was the idea of learning something new with your friends, together... the mahjong becomes the background of the expansion of friendship. It’s the feeling of community.”Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China. Traditionally played with 144 tiles, the game blends skill, strategy and a touch of luck. Players pick and discard tiles to form winning hands, much like the card game rummy.The game’s expansion across the world has now erupted into a full-blown trend. The World Mahjong Championship was recently held in Mississauga, Ontario – the first time it’s been hosted in North America. Hotels such as the Ace Hotel New York and Thompson Hotel Dallas regularly hold mahjong-themed nights.Fans with money to spare are buying fancy mahjong sets from Hermès, Louis Vuitton, and Ralph Lauren. Some are even splashing out on luxury tables that shuffle the tiles automatically – costing over $4,500.Even cruise ships have joined the trend, offering mahjong tournaments and special rooms just for playing the game.Mahjong is played with 144 tiles. Players begin by shuffling the tiles face down. Everyone rolls dice and the highest roller becomes the dealer. Each player picks 36 tiles and builds a wall—two rows of 18 tiles. The walls are pushed forward, creating a space in the middle for discards. Each player then draws 13 tiles (the dealer starts with 14), and the game begins.Players take turns drawing one tile and discarding one, always keeping 13 tiles in hand. You can draw a new tile or pick up someone’s discarded one. If a discarded tile helps complete a set (called a meld), you can grab it, announce the set, and show the tiles. To win, a player must have four melds (like three or four matching tiles or a sequence of three in a suit) and one pair (two matching tiles)—making 14 tiles total.There are five types of tiles: Bamboo, Characters, Dots (these are the three main suits), and special tiles called Honors (Dragons and Winds) and Bonus (Flowers and Seasons). Each suit goes from 1 to 9. Honors and Bonus tiles add extra excitement but aren't needed to win. Mahjong mixes strategy and memory with a bit of luck—and it’s all about building the right sets before your opponents do.For many mahjong fans, it’s not just a game but a deeply social experience.","Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China.

UK Magic Circle to honour woman thrown out for 'masqueradeing' as man,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-magic-circle-to-honour-woman-thrown-out-for-masqueradeing-as-man/articleshow/120584411.cms,"Representative Image (AI)

LONDON: Over 30 years after Britain's elite Magic Circle expelled a woman for posing as a man to gain admittance, the formerly male-only society is to welcome her back as a full member.The London-based international magic organisation ejected Sophie Lloyd after she masqueraded as a male in 1991 to win membership.But after her story came to light last year, the society's first female chair Laura London launched a search to track down Lloyd and apologise.She was eventually located living abroad and will later on Thursday be presented with a membership certificate at a special ceremony at the organisation's London headquarters.""It is so exciting after all these months tracking Sophie... I can't tell you how happy we are as a society to welcome her back into the fold,"" London told BBC radio.Lloyd posed as Raymond Lloyd for 18 months before unmasking herself as a woman.But members, who voted to admit women in September 1991, were so angered by her ""deliberate deception"" that they went ahead with her expulsion.The deception was in fact a two-person act involving the late magician Jenny Winstanley, who recruited Lloyd to help her prove that women magicians were just as good as men.""I did a 20-minute show in front of 200 people, three examiners, and spoke to the examiner for an hour-and-three-quarters afterwards,"" Lloyd said, recalling how she managed to pull the wool over everyone's eyes.After the Magic Circle changed its stance on allowing women in, Winstanley, who died in 2004, phoned the society to explain.""Two days later we got a letter to say Raymond's been expelled,"" said Lloyd.""We couldn't get our heads round it. We just thought, 'come on it's funny, it's amusing' but they didn't think so and Jenny was completely snubbed, unfortunately.""After the expulsion, Lloyd continued to perform magic for 11 years in an anti-bullying variety show before eventually moving overseas.She said the Magic Circle had changed out of all recognition in the 30 years since she was thrown out, adding: ""This is for Jenny really, Jenny would have loved it.""London said Thursday's ceremony would also be a chance to recognise Winstanley both for her contribution to magic and her audacious trick at the Magic Circle's expense.""I just think she's a wonderful woman and I know she'd have loved to be here and I just wish more than anything I could have met her myself,"" she said.The Magic Circle was founded in 1905 by around 20 magicians at a restaurant in London's Chinatown district.Members must vow never to give away the secrets of magic.Although women have now been admitted to the Magic Circle for over 30 years, they still make up only around five percent of the society's 1,700 membership.The body says, however, that increasing numbers are now coming through in the 10-18-year-old age group.","Sophie Lloyd was expelled from the Magic Circle after posing as a man to gain admittance.

They were 60 for 5 at one stage. The only higher successful chase in such a scenario came earlier this season when Delhi Capitals chased down 210 after being 65 for 5 against LSG in Vizag.",Chennai Super Kings beat Kolkata Knight Riders by two wickets.

Rohit Sharma’s Final Test Practice: Exclusive Farewell Visuals

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricket team captain Sourav Ganguly offered praise for Rohit Sharma following his retirement announcement on Wednesday, acknowledging India's numerous trophy victories under his leadership.""He is a great player for India, but someone has to leave the game. My best wishes to him. He had a good career, he will play One Day for India and IPL... BCCI's work is to support the player. When I was part of BCCI, we thought he would be a great captain for India and so he was. We won World Cup, Champion's trophy, Test Cricket under him,"" Ganguly told ANI.On Wednesday, Rohit Sharma announced his retirement from Test cricket, concluding a notable phase in his international career. The 38-year-old cricketer shared this news on Instagram, expressing appreciation to supporters whilst reflecting on his time in Test cricket.Rohit's Test career began against the West Indies in November 2013, spanning 67 matches. He accumulated 4,301 runs with an average of 40.57, including 12 centuries and 18 half-centuries.His highest score of 212 was achieved during a home series against South Africa in 2019, placing him as India's 16th-highest run-scorer in Tests. His journey began impressively with a score of 177 against the West Indies at Eden Gardens, Kolkata in 2013.Despite showing potential and delivering notable performances, Rohit initially faced challenges establishing himself in the Test format, particularly in away matches. Between 2013-18, he participated in 27 Tests, scoring 1,585 runs at an average of 39.63, with three centuries and 10 fifties in 47 innings.His highest score stood at 151. The right-handed batsman encountered difficulties away from home, notably in SENA countries (South Africa, England, New Zealand, Australia). Success in these nations is considered a benchmark for Indian batsmen.Rohit's home performance was exceptional, scoring 2,535 runs in 34 Tests at an average of 51.73, with 10 centuries and eight fifties across 55 innings. However, his overseas record showed 1,644 runs in 31 Tests at an average of 31.01, with two centuries and 10 fifties in 57 innings.In neutral venues, he played two Tests, scoring 122 runs at an average of 30.50, with a highest score of 43. His most notable overseas performance came during the 2021-22 Pataudi Trophy in England, where he led India's scoring with 368 runs in four Tests at an average of 52.57, including a century of 127, his sole hundred in SENA nations.","Rohit Sharma announced his retirement from Test cricket on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) secured their Champions League final spot with a 2-1 victory against Arsenal in the second leg of their semi-final, achieving a 3-1 aggregate win on Wednesday.Fabian Ruiz struck from outside the box in the 27th minute at the Parc des Princes, following Arsenal's initial attacking pressure.With PSG already ahead from Ousmane Dembele's first-leg goal, they maintained control despite Vitinha's missed penalty in the latter half.Achraf Hakimi extended their lead in the 72nd minute, whilst Bukayo Saka managed a consolation goal for Arsenal.The victory sparked celebrations across Paris, including the Champs-Elysees, as PSG advanced to face Inter Milan in Munich on May 31.This marks PSG's second Champions League final appearance, following their 2020 loss to Bayern Munich in Lisbon.""We have worked hard as a club to get this and to deserve it. It has been a long, hard road,"" PSG captain Marquinhos told broadcaster Canal Plus.""The job is done in terms of getting to the final but it's not finished, we want more. We really want to win the trophy.""Arsenal's European aspirations ended, falling short of reaching their second final since losing to Barcelona 19 years ago in Paris.With their last trophy being the 2020 FA Cup, Arteta's squad now focuses on securing another second-place Premier League finish.""To do what we have done in Paris today against this team is remarkable, but the fact is that we are out,"" admitted Arteta.""Sometimes you have to applaud the opposition, and what the 'keeper did in both games. He won the game for them,"" he added regarding PSG's Gianluigi Donnarumma.The electrifying atmosphere in Paris witnessed PSG reaching a final before their supporters for the first time, unlike their 2020 semi-final victory against RB Leipzig during the pandemic's closed-door period.Despite pre-match excitement, PSG's previous Champions League disappointments and Dembele's absence from the starting lineup due to a hamstring issue raised concerns.Arsenal, strengthened by Thomas Partey's return from suspension, initially dominated with Rice heading wide and Donnarumma denying both Martinelli and Odegaard within eight minutes.PSG gradually improved, with Kvaratskhelia striking the post before Ruiz netted his first Champions League goal from Partey's clearance.Donnarumma's outstanding saves continued, notably denying Saka, before a controversial handball penalty against Lewis-Skelly, which Raya saved from Vitinha.Hakimi's subsequent goal, assisted by substitute Dembele, appeared decisive until Saka's response. Arsenal's hopes finally ended when Saka missed an open goal from Calafiori's cross, confirming PSG's triumph.",Paris Saint-Germain beat Arsenal 2-1 in Champions League semi-final second leg.

Rohit Sharma Unplugged: Funniest Press Conference Moments

Chennai Super Kings, long out of the playoff race, played spoilsport at Eden Gardens with a spirited victory over Kolkata Knight Riders in Match 57 of IPL 2025. The win, only their third of the season, has dented KKR’s campaign at a crucial juncture.KKR, who were pushing for a late surge into the top four, remain stuck on 11 points from 12 games. Their Net Run Rate (NRR) has also taken a hit, pushing them further behind Delhi Capitals in the mid-table battle. With just two games left, KKR now not only need to win both but also hope for favourable results from other matches to stay alive in the playoff race.CSK, meanwhile, are still at the bottom of the table. They now have 3 wins from 12 games, While still out of contention, the win was a morale-booster for a side enduring its toughest IPL season in recent memory.Gujarat Titans sit atop with 16 points from 12 matches and a robust NRR of +0.753. Their eighth win puts them within touching distance of a playoff berth.Royal Challengers Bengaluru are second with 16 points as well, having played one game fewer. Their NRR of +0.482 gives them a good cushion. Punjab Kings remain in third with 15 points from 11 games and a healthy NRR of +0.376. They’re hot on the heels of the top two.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Mumbai Indians are fourth with 14 points and the best NRR in the league at +1.156. They remain well-placed, but cannot afford slip-ups. Delhi Capitals are fifth with 13 points in 11 matches, staying in contention with a NRR of +0.362.KKR are now sixth, still on 11 points from 12 games, with NRR of +0.193 and their path to qualification looks increasingly steep. LSG follow with 10 points and a NRR of -0.469, meaning their playoff push hinges on big wins and other results.Sunrisers Hyderabad (3 wins, NRR -1.192) and Rajasthan Royals (3 wins, NRR -1.173) are officially out.As the league enters its final week, the playoff race remains intense — and today’s result shows that even the bottom teams can still turn the tide on those chasing the top four.","Chennai Super Kings beat Kolkata Knight Riders in Match 57 of IPL 2025.

Kolkata Knight Riders face a must-win clash against Chennai Super Kings at Eden Gardens on Wednesday, with their playoff hopes hanging by a thread.KKR, currently on 11 points, must win all three of their remaining matches to reach 17, with qualification likely coming down to net run rate and other results. They come into the game on the back of a dramatic one-run win over Rajasthan Royals, boosted by Andre Russell’s explosive return to form.Venkatesh Iyer, under pressure due to his hefty price tag, will be keen to contribute significantly, while Russell’s battle against CSK’s spinners, especially Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin, could prove decisive on a surface offering some grip.CSK, though out of the playoff race, are not expected to make it easy for the hosts. Youngster Ayush Mhatre has been a revelation, stepping in for injured captain Ruturaj Gaikwad. The 17-year-old made an instant impact with a 32-run cameo against Mumbai Indians and followed it up with a stunning 94 off 48 balls versus RCB, despite the team’s narrow loss.With little to lose, CSK are likely to play with freedom, making for a high-stakes and entertaining encounter between two high-profile sides.The Eden Gardens surface presents a fascinating challenge. With dimensions of 66m and 60m square, and 74m straight, it’s a relatively small ground, favouring big hitters. The pitch itself appears dry and dark with patches of dead grass and a few bare areas. Although it lacks live grass, the surface is holding together well and is unlikely to break up or behave inconsistently like the occasional jigsaw-type Eden wicket. There could be some early grip for spinners as it may slow down in the first half, but overall, it looks good for batting.Rahmanullah Gurbaz (w), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Moeen Ali, Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Ramandeep Singh, Varun Chakaravarthy, Vaibhav AroraImpact Player – Harshit RanaShaik Rasheed, Ayush Mhatre, Sam Curran, Ravindra Jadeja, Dewald Brevis, Deepak Hooda, MS Dhoni (w/c), Noor Ahmad, Khaleel Ahmed, Anshul Kamboj, Matheesha PathiranaImpact Player - Shivam DubeAjinkya Rahane (c), Rinku Singh, Quinton de Kock (wk), Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Rovman Powell, Manish Pandey, Luvnith Sisodia, Venkatesh Iyer, Anukul Roy, Moeen Ali, Ramandeep Singh, Andre Russell, Anrich Nortje, Vaibhav Arora, Mayank Markande, Spencer Johnson, Harshit Rana, Sunil Narine, Varun Chakaravarthy and Chetan Sakariya.MS Dhoni (c, wk), Shaik Rasheed, Ayush Mhatre, Deepak Hooda, Sam Curran, Ravindra Jadeja, Dewald Brevis, Shivam Dube, Noor Ahmad, Khaleel Ahmed, Matheesha Pathirana, Anshul Kamboj, R Ashwin, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Ramakrishna Ghosh, Jamie Overton, Vijay Shankar, Rahul Tripathi, Shreyas Gopal, Devon Conway, Rachin Ravindra, Mukesh Choudhary, Nathan Ellis, C Andre Siddarth, Urvil Patel.Played: 30KKR wins: 11CSK wins: 19Kolkata will experience a partly sunny and very warm Wednesday, with a chance of isolated thunderstorms in the afternoon, but the weather is expected to clear up by evening.

Surya Kumar Yadav edges ahead in the Orange Cap race with 510 runs, maintaining his top spot by scoring a steady 35 in his recent outing against Gujarat Titans. Though Mumbai Indians couldn’t secure the win, Surya’s form has been a standout throughout the season. With an impressive average of 63.75 and a blazing strike rate of 170.56, he continues to anchor the MI batting order.His ability to consistently contribute, even under pressure, has made him one of the most dependable performers this IPL. As the playoff race intensifies, Surya’s form could be crucial for MI’s campaign.Hot on his heels are Sai Sudharsan (509 runs) and Shubman Gill (508 runs), both of whom remain in red-hot form. Gill, in particular, made a big impact in the last match, guiding GT to a DLS win over MI with a composed and match-winning knock, earning him the Player of the Match award. Virat Kohli (505 runs) continues to showcase his vintage form for RCB, while Jos Buttler (500 runs) remains a key force in Gujarat’s top order. Other strong performers like Yashasvi Jaiswal, Prabhsimran Singh, and Nicholas Pooran are also keeping the run charts competitive with impactful contributions.On the bowling front, Prasidh Krishna firmly holds the Purple Cap with 20 wickets in 11 matches. His pace and control have made him Gujarat Titans' most reliable bowler this season. Although he went wicketless in the last game, his tight lines and economy under pressure helped restrict MI to a chaseable score. Close contenders like Josh Hazlewood and Trent Boult (18 wickets each) continue to deliver for their teams, while bowlers like Noor Ahmad, Varun Chakaravarthy, and Arshdeep Singh are making their mark as the tournament heats up.As the race for both the Orange and Purple Caps narrows, every run and wicket becomes crucial. The fight for individual glory is adding even more spice to the playoff race.","summarize: IPL Orange Cap Updated List 2025. IPL Purple Cap updated list 2025. Player Name. Team. Name.

Poll What do you think was the main reason for MI's defeat against GT? Poor weather conditions Sub-par batting performance Dropped catches No-balls bowled by MI

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 4: Prof. Ratnakar Shetty on BCCI, cricket politics & Indian cricket's growth

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians captain Hardik Pandya described the no-balls bowled by him and his teammates as a ""crime"" following their three-wicket defeat via the DLS method against Gujarat Titans in a thrilling contest at the Wankhede Stadium. In the midst of a tight playoffs race, heavy rain momentarily swung momentum in Mumbai’s favour, with the hosts ahead by five runs on the DLS chart after 18 overs. As MI waited in the dressing room, hoping for a rain-shortened win, Gujarat Titans remained ready for any opportunity.Eventually, there was just enough time left on the clock for a one-over shootout to determine the winner. GT needed 15 runs off the final six deliveries, and Mumbai were left with only four fielders outside the inner circle after being penalised for a slow over rate.Deepak Chahar was handed the task of bowling the final over. He conceded a boundary and then a massive six, reducing the equation to five runs from three balls. Succumbing to pressure, he bowled a no-ball that handed the momentum squarely to the Titans.In addition to Deepak’s costly error, Hardik himself overstepped twice during his 11-ball eighth over. The no-ball troubles weren’t MI’s only missteps—earlier, they dropped a crucial catch of Gujarat captain Shubman Gill on the second ball of the 12th over. Gill miscued a shot off Ashwani Kumar, and though Tilak Varma sprinted in to take the catch, he failed to hold on.Reflecting on the defeat, which ended MI’s six-match winning streak, Hardik said, ""Catches did not really cost us, but the no-balls, with my no-balls and even in the last no-ball, in my eyes in T20s, it is a crime and more often than not, it bites you. But I am really happy with the boys for giving their 120 per cent, ensuring we were in the game and not giving up.""Mumbai's bowlers had fought valiantly after the batters put up a sub-par performance. Despite top-order failures, Will Jacks (53), Suryakumar Yadav (35), and Corbin Bosch (27) managed to take MI to 155/8—helped by some fortunate moments.Jasprit Bumrah and Trent Boult then led a spirited bowling effort. Bumrah dismissed Gill and Shahrukh Khan, while Boult trapped Sherfane Rutherford lbw to keep MI in the hunt.Hardik admitted that Mumbai were 20–30 runs short of a competitive total but commended the bowling unit for their resilience.""Yes, definitely (tough way to go down). We fought well with the total we had. Most of the time, we were out of the game, but we pushed as a group. It was a game of margins,"" he said.""It was definitely not a 150-wicket. It was a 175-wicket, we were short in batting by 20-25 or maybe 30 runs if we had batted well. Credit to the bowlers. They kept fighting, and we could not finish the job,"" he added.Rain repeatedly interrupted the match, and although Hardik acknowledged the disruptions were far from ideal, he stressed the need to adapt.""The ground, in the first innings, was not wet, but post that, throughout, the ball kept getting wetter. Not sure if it helped us or not, it was difficult. Rain kept coming in, not ideal to have stoppages and start again. But the game goes on, we had to play a game (in the end), and we definitely did,"" he concluded.","Hardik Pandya describes no-balls bowled by Mumbai Indians as a ""crime"" MI lost by three wickets via the DLS method against Gujarat Titans. Hardik admits that Mumbai were 20–30 runs short of a competitive total.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120949855,imgsize-55224,width-400,resizemode-4/Pandya-0705-IPL.jpg"

Rohit Sharma’s Final Test Practice: Exclusive Farewell Visuals

Rohit Sharma Unplugged: Funniest Press Conference Moments

Defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders are virtually out of the IPL 2025 playoff race after suffering a heartbreaking two-wicket defeat to Chennai Super Kings at Eden Gardens on Wednesday. In a match full of momentum shifts, CSK held their nerve in a tense chase to seal their third win of the season and dent KKR’s fading hopes of qualification.Chasing 180, CSK were rocked early, losing both openers for ducks. But debutant Urvil Patel brought the chase back to life with a dazzling 31 off just 11 balls, displaying fearlessness against the new ball. However, his dismissal triggered another collapse as CSK stumbled to 60/5.Just when it seemed KKR were on course to defend the total, Dewald Brevis flipped the script with a blistering 52 off 25 balls. The South African took apart Vaibhav Arora for 30 runs in a single over, drastically tilting the momentum in CSK’s favour.Shivam Dube held the innings together with a calm and composed 45 off 40 balls. And with the ever-reliable MS Dhoni at the other end, CSK ensured there would be no panic. Even two wickets in the penultimate over didn’t rattle Dhoni, who delivered a trademark six in the final over. Anshul Kamboj hit the winning runs, taking CSK over the line with just a ball to spare.Earlier, KKR opted to bat first and rode on a solid foundation laid by skipper Ajinkya Rahane , who scored 48 off 33 balls. Sunil Narine contributed with a brisk start, while Andre Russell chipped in with a powerful 38 (21). Manish Pandey provided support through the middle overs with an unbeaten 33.But the innings belonged to CSK’s young Afghan spinner Noor Ahmad, who picked up a stunning 4/31. He triggered a mid-innings collapse by dismissing Narine, Raghuvanshi, Russell, and Rinku, ensuring KKR were restricted to 179/6 — a total that looked competitive but proved just short.KKR, now on 11 points from 12 matches, have just two games left and are heavily reliant on other results and net run rate , to have any chance of sneaking into the top four. For CSK, already out of playoff contention, the win was a morale boost and a reminder that pride still matters.","Kolkata Knight Riders are virtually out of the IPL 2025 playoff race after suffering a heartbreaking two-wicket defeat to Chennai Super Kings at Eden Gardens on Wednesday.
