Inside details of how PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi ran away with the Asia Cup trophy!

Poll Should politics be kept separate from sports like cricket? Yes, absolutely No, they are interconnected

Former Indian cricket captain Kapil Dev called for keeping politics separate from cricket following India's refusal to accept the Asia Cup trophy and medals from Pakistan 's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi after their five-wicket victory over Pakistan in the final at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on September 28, 2025.The presentation ceremony was delayed and shortened after the Indian team declined to receive the awards from Naqvi, who heads both the Pakistan Cricket Board and the Asian Cricket Council. The Indian team instead celebrated their victory on the field without the official awards.The match itself saw Pakistan make a strong start with an 84-run opening partnership between Fakhar Zaman and Sahibzada Farhan. However, they suffered a dramatic collapse, losing nine wickets for just 33 runs to finish at 146 in 19.1 overs. India successfully chased down the target despite losing three early wickets.""I just want to say — your responsibility, and responsibility for the entire media also we should look into the sports side rather than looking into the politics side. Yes, media has the responsibility to bring everything on the table, but as a sportsman, I would like to see that we should stick to sports. It will be much better,"" Kapil Dev said in an interview with India Today.The controversy extended beyond the trophy presentation. Pakistan's Haris Rauf received a fine of 30 percent of his match fee for making a provocative 'plane crash' gesture during the Super Four match. Additionally, Sahibzada Farhan received a warning for his 'gunshot' celebration after scoring fifty runs, which he defended as a cultural expression.Kapil Dev, who led India to their first World Cup victory in 1983, also commented on the current state of Pakistani cricket talent compared to previous generations.""Yeah, I think they don't have the similar talent they used to have in the '80s, '90s or before that. Pakistan has given us, to the world, one of the best cricketers. You can talk about Imran Khan, you can talk about Javed Miandad, Zaheer Abbas, Wasim Akram , Waqar Younis. They have given us that talent. But unfortunately, we can't see similar talent today — not even one percent of what they used to have,"" Kapil Dev added.The Asia Cup final victory marked a significant achievement for India, despite the controversy surrounding the presentation ceremony. The team's performance demonstrated their ability to handle pressure situations, successfully chasing down the target with two balls remaining in their innings.The incident has highlighted the ongoing challenges in keeping sports separate from political tensions between the two nations. Despite these challenges, the focus remains on the cricket played on the field and the sporting achievements of both teams.The match will be remembered not only for India's victory but also for the broader context of cricket diplomacy and its role in India-Pakistan relations. The events surrounding the trophy presentation have added another chapter to the complex history of cricket encounters between these two cricket-playing nations.",Former Indian cricket captain Kapil Dev calls for keeping politics separate from cricket.

It's our cancer.""According to Union, she was scared and even worried that she would have to raise the kids in Dwyane Wade’s absence. The Bring It On star further mentioned,""I'll speak for myself when I say that the decisions that he was making hurt me about his cancer. It felt like, 'Oh, you're trying to kill me.And I'm going to be alone raising these kids. It's a very selfish response that I had, and it caused all kinds of problems, but [so did] his need for secrecy about his cancer decisions.

Who am I without this big life, and without this healthy body? But you also don’t understand the journey and the toll that it takes on your marriage, on your family, on your kids.”After being married for 11 long years, Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union share a daughter named Kaavia via surrogacy.

How Taylor Swift got pulled into Blake Lively’s legal saga

Travis Kelce Shares His First Reaction About Taylor Swift Engagement Ring Before NFL Game

Why the friendship may not recover anytime soon

The once-unshakable friendship between Taylor Swift and Blake Lively is under the microscope again as legal battles surrounding It Ends With Us spill over into the personal lives of Hollywood’s biggest names. What began as a lawsuit between Lively and director Justin Baldoni has now dragged Swift into the fray, sparking speculation about whether her bond with Lively can survive the fallout.Although It Ends With Us premiered more than a year ago, its book-to-screen adaptation continues to generate drama. Lively filed a lawsuit against the production company, and in the process, Swift was deposed. Matters escalated when a process server attempting to deliver legal documents to Swift was arrested for trespassing outside Travis Kelce ’s Kansas City home.An anonymous insider told Radar Online, “For Taylor, that arrest was it. She believes Blake opened the door to all of this, and watching a process server get handcuffed at Travis’ home because of Blake’s lawsuit was humiliating. It has ended whatever was left of their bond.”This alleged breaking point comes as Swift and Kelce prepare for the next chapter of their lives together. With their engagement making headlines worldwide, Swift reportedly views the incident as not just embarrassing but also invasive, adding pressure to protect her fiancé from unwanted drama.Sources claim Swift feels betrayed by being dragged into what she considers Lively’s personal feud with Baldoni. Another insider suggested, “Taylor has dealt with stalkers and security scares for years, but being dragged into Blake’s drama with Baldoni feels different. She sees it as betrayal. That arrest was the moment she decided she’s done.”While Lively continues pursuing her legal battle and lining up new projects for 2026 and beyond, Baldoni faces an uncertain career path after his defamation case was dismissed. For Swift, however, the focus seems to have shifted to safeguarding her relationship with Kelce and distancing herself from any fallout connected to her former friend.Also Read: “A major rift”: Numerologist warns Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce may face challenges despite fairytale romance As both legal teams press on, the bigger question remains: can one of Hollywood’s most high-profile friendships recover from this rift, or has it quietly come to an end?","The friendship between Taylor Swift and Blake Lively is under the microscope again as legal battles surrounding It Ends With Us spill over into the personal lives of Hollywood’s biggest names.

Tua Tagovailoa’s “keeping us safe” line raises questions as Tyreek Hill leaves on a cart

Miami Dolphins players react to losing Tyreek Hill after their first win of the season



The Miami Dolphins finally secured their first win of 2025, beating the New York Jets 27-21 on Monday night. The celebration did not last long. Wide receiver Tyreek Hill suffered a devastating knee injury in the third quarter, tearing multiple ligaments. Quarterback Tua Tagovailoa ’s postgame thanks to God for “keeping us safe, for the most part” turned into the headline moment as fans questioned his words while Hill was rushed to the hospital.Tua Tagovailoa opened his ESPN interview with thanks. “All glory belongs to God, my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,” he said. “Just want to thank Him for this victory and keeping us safe, for the most part.”The phrasing immediately lit up social media. “Keeping us all safe, except our best player, whose leg is now backwards,” one fan wrote on X. Others pointed to Tagovailoa’s concussion history, joking about memory loss.An edited clip stripped out his mention of Hill, but the full interview shows Tagovailoa adding: “My prayers go out to all of those who got injured tonight, my boy Tyreek.” The full quote did little to stop the backlash.Tyreek Hill went down in the third quarter while being tackled along the sideline. Trainers placed his leg in an air cast before carting him off Hard Rock Stadium.He was then taken by ambulance to a Miami hospital.Head coach Mike McDaniel confirmed Hill would stay overnight. “I know he’s at the hospital. I know he’s staying overnight. I know it was a dislocation,” McDaniel told reporters. He called Hill’s calm reaction inspiring: “He immediately had wide eyes and was talking, ‘I’m good, just make sure the guys get this win.’”ESPN’s Adam Schefter later reported that Hill tore his ACL and other ligaments. The 31-year-old will need surgery and is out for the season. Medical experts noted that severe dislocations raise concerns about arteries and nerves in the leg, which is why Hill was hospitalized so quickly.The Dolphins extended their lead just three plays after Hill was carted off, but the team described the moment as bittersweet. Left tackle Patrick Paul called it “a huge blow… a leader for our team, someone who’s very vocal.” Defensive lineman Zach Sieler admitted he could not look at the replay, saying he immediately began to pray for Hill.Jaylen Waddle described the loss as emotional: “It’s mixed emotions having one of our captains, leader, and a player that just means so much to the team. Prayers to him. It’s tough.” Running back De’Von Achane said, “We just got to face the fact that we might not have him.”Former teammates also chimed in. Patrick Mahomes posted, “Prayers up man….. 🙏🏽🙏🏽.” Terron Armstead shared on X that Hill FaceTimed him from the hospital, laughing through pain. “First thing he said ‘man I’m just happy we got that win.’”","Miami Dolphins beat the New York Jets 27-21 on Monday night.

The Golden State Warriors made headlines with a flurry of free agent acquisitions, including veteran Al Horford, before club members returned to the Bay Area for the opening of training camp and media day.

However, before revealing any of their offseason plans, the Warriors are awaiting the resolution of their contract impasse with restricted free agent Jonathan Kuminga.Players at Monday's media day were unable to respond to some questions regarding their new teammate since Horford's rumored contract was not yet made public. Nevertheless, certain media outlets continued to ask about Horford and his compatibility with the Warriors. Jimmy Butler was questioned regarding his relationship with Horford on the same day. The reporter asked Butler his opinion regarding the signing of the center, and the forward gave a witty reply. As a reply, Butler asked:""What you gon ask me (the question) for.”When asked what he thought of Horford, the former Miami Heat player joked and answered:""Who's that?""Butler was making fun of the former Celtics star by refusing to recognize him.

Kirill Kaprazov has grown up not only as a star rookie but also one of the biggest stars in hockey. His net worth is destined to shoot up since he has got the record breaking contract. The Minnesota Wild star is entering a new financial stage and the specifics of his historic agreement are already controversial throughout the league.Kirill Kaprizov's net worth is said to be between $5 million and $10 million as estimated by Mabumbe. This amount includes his NHL salaries, a few endorsements, and other assets, but we don’t have the specifics on his investments or personal spending.The estimate shows how quickly he’s climbed in the league since 2020, while also considering the high taxes, agent fees, and living expenses that come with being a pro athlete. With his new contract extension signed today, his net worth is set to grow significantly, possibly multiplying several times in the next decade just from guaranteed earnings alone.Thanks to the new deal, Kaprizov's total earnings might go over $181 million by 2034, which includes $45 million from his current contract and a $136 million extension. After taxes (which are about 40-50% for high earners in Minnesota) and fees, his net worth could reach anywhere from $50 to $100 million or even higher, depending on his investments and endorsements.This contract solidified Kaprizov as the Wild's main star and a financial giant in hockey, celebrating his rise from a late draft selection to a superstar.Kaprizov just signed an eight-year, $136 million deal with the Minnesota Wild, which is the highest total value contract ever in NHL history. The contract has an AAV and cap hit of $17 million that kicks in for the 2026-27 season. This keeps him with the team until the 2033-34 season and includes full no-movement clauses (NMC) each year.This setup gives Kaprizov a good chunk of cash right away, shielding him from possible lockouts or changes in the salary cap. The AAV is roughly 16.35% of the expected 2026-27 salary cap, which makes him the top earner in the league.This extension not only ensures Kaprizov's future but also brings stability to the Wild franchise, which has depended on his scoring skills—he's led the team in points for four out of five seasons, racking up 185 goals and 386 points in 323 games. Even with a season in 2024-25 limited by injury (56 points in 41 games), his worth is still unparalleled.Also Read: Kirill Kaprizov makes history as he signed the biggest deal in NHL with Minnesota Wild","Kirill Kaprizov just signed an eight-year, $136 million deal with the Minnesota Wild, which is the highest total value contract ever in NHL history.

Sources say AJ Brown’s tweet was intentionally directed at people within the Eagles organization

Fans react to AJ Brown’s tweet: social media buzz and speculation

AJ Brown fans, buckle up, your favorite receiver just threw some shade on social media. After Sunday’s game against the Buccaneers, where Brown only caught two passes for seven yards despite nine targets, the star wideout posted a cryptic tweet that immediately set the Eagles fanbase buzzing. The quote he shared wasn’t subtle:And insiders say it was very much “intentionally directed” at someone inside the Eagles organization.Jeff McLane reported that Brown’s tweet was “intentionally directed” at someone within the Eagles organization.While McLane didn’t name names, speculation is flying, offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo, head coach Nick Sirianni, and even quarterback Jalen Hurts are all on the hot seat in fan conversations. With Brown averaging just 37.3 receiving yards per game, well below his career norms, it’s easy to see why he might feel sidelined.Nick Sirianni stepped up to the mic to assure everyone that Brown’s intentions are rooted in passion, not drama. The coach emphasized that AJ’s competitiveness is a strength, and he remains a key piece of the Eagles’ undefeated 4-0 puzzle. While Sirianni didn’t promise immediate changes to the offense, he acknowledged that Brown’s desire to contribute more is clear and the team values that fire.It wasn’t just a rough stat line, Brown’s limited involvement felt personal to some fans. The Eagles have leaned heavily on a run-first offense this season, ranking second in rushing attempts while sitting last in pass attempts per game. Brown’s tweet came hours after Philadelphia’s 31–25 win, and the timing made it crystal clear, he’s frustrated with how things are going in the passing game.As you’d expect, social media blew up. Some fans are sympathizing, saying the Eagles need to get Brown the ball more.Others are defending the team’s run-heavy strategy, arguing that Brown is still getting his opportunities just not as many as in previous seasons. Memes, hot takes, and debates are flooding Twitter, turning a single tweet into the latest viral Eagles saga.AJ Brown’s cryptic tweet has put the spotlight on potential tension in the Eagles’ offense but he’s still a core part of the team.

NHL analysts debate possible blockbuster trades to replace Aleksander Barkov

Who should Panthers target to help fill Barkov injury void?

Panthers coach Paul Maurice admits there’s no true Barkov replacement

The Florida Panthers’ Stanley Cup title defense has taken a serious hit with captain Aleksander Barkov sidelined following surgery to repair torn ACL and MCL ligaments. The recovery window of seven to nine months means the Panthers could be without their franchise cornerstone for nearly the entire season, forcing the team to explore high-profile replacements.On TSN’s That’s Hockey, analysts Frankie Corrado and Martin Biron discussed potential paths Florida might take. Biron suggested the Panthers could swing for the fences: “If you're going to be aggressive and you want to hit that grand slam, you go after (Penguins’ Evgeni) Malkin. Look, he's on an expiring contract. He's on a bad team. ... I think Malkin gets moved this year.""Corrado, meanwhile, highlighted more practical names such as Alex Wennberg, JG Pageau, and even Columbus captain Boone Jenner, who has ties to Panthers GM Bill Zito. He also floated a more daring scenario: if the Los Angeles Kings stumble early, Florida could pursue Anze Kopitar, noting, “And then you replace a Selke centerman with another Selke centerman and Kopitar.”The analysts agreed that patience could pay off, as struggling teams may become more open to trading top talent by November or December.Despite the trade chatter, Florida head coach Paul Maurice was blunt about the irreplaceable nature of his captain.“What we’re going to get to experience now is you’ll get to know some of the other leaders that we have in our room. We’ll get to see other players. At the end of the day, I know there’s the idea of next man up, I get all that, but there’s not a next man for his skates.”Also Read: Why Connor McDavid’s future with the Edmonton Oilers depends on more than just contract numbers Barkov, now in his 13th NHL season, leads the Panthers in virtually every franchise scoring category.

Max Domi projected to take first-line trial with Auston Matthews and Matthew Knies in Toronto Maple Leafs’ lineup

Impact on Toronto Maple Leafs lineup structure, depth chart, and long-term NHL strategy

The Toronto Maple Leafs are expected to address Mitch Marner’s absence with Max Domi projected to take his spot on the top line alongside Auston Matthews and Matthew Knies. According to Sportsnet insider Luke Fox, this projected lineup could play in the final preseason game, though changes are possible ahead of the Oct. 8 home opener.Domi, 30, has reportedly impressed enough in training camp to secure the right-wing role on Toronto’s first line. Head coach Craig Berube explained that he wants Domi to be more aggressive, shoot the puck, and avoid overpassing, traits that make him a fitting complement to Matthews’ elite scoring ability. Knies provides size and puck retrieval, giving the line a clear mix of skill, speed, and physical presence.While Marner traditionally drove play through extended possessions, Domi thrived in quicker transitions. His ability to move the puck rapidly and attack the slot could accelerate Toronto’s offensive tempo at five-on-five. The chemistry between Matthews and Domi from last season also makes this adjustment less of a gamble, especially in the high-pressure environment of opening night.With Max Domi moving up to the first line, Toronto can test Matias Maccelli, in third-line or situational roles, helping ease pressure on newcomers while maximizing roster depth.According to Sportsnet insider Luke Fox, this projected lineup is expected to dress for Toronto’s final preseason tune-up against the Detroit Red Wings before key players rest ahead of the Oct. 8 home opener.This approach allows head coach Craig Berube to maintain consistency on the top line while experimenting with versatility across the rest of the roster. It also signals that the Maple Leafs may lean into a more direct, vertical style of play compared to previous seasons, designed to create higher-danger scoring chances and reduce dead time in the offensive zone.Max Domi stepping into Marner’s role may not be a permanent solution, but it reflects a calculated decision to balance chemistry, depth, and pace. As Toronto prepares for the season opener, all eyes will be on how well Auston Matthews, Matthew Knies, and Domi mesh together.

Raising a ‘strong objection’ to the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) president Mohsin Naqvi's act of taking away the Asia Cup trophy and the medals, the BCCI “cornered” Naqvi, who also happens to be Pakistan's interior minister, in the ACC AGM held in Dubai on Tuesday, TOI has learnt.Vice-president Rajeev Shukla and former treasurer Ashish Shelar were BCCI's representatives in the AGM, which they attended virtually. “Both Shukla and Shelar completely cornered Naqvi on the issue, which was not listed on the agenda but was taken up before the meeting ended. India raised a strong objection to Naqvi taking away the Asia Cup trophy and medals with him on Sunday night in Dubai after India beat Pakistan in the final by five wickets.When he was asked to return the trophy and medals won by India, Naqvi said that the Indian captain, Suryakumar Yadav , could collect them from him at the ACC office in Dubai.However, he was told that BCCI's stance was very clear: the Indian captain would not take the trophy from Naqvi. After Shukla and Shelar put forward India's argument strongly, Naqvi went on the backfoot and was subdued in the meeting. Bangladesh Cricket Board president Aminul Islam Bulbul suggested that the matter could be resolved later.The matter has been deferred and will now be dealt with between Naqvi and the BCCI, with a mediator in between,” a source told TOI.“We are hopeful that better sense will prevail on Naqvi and he will do the needful, otherwise India will lodge a complaint against him in the ICC,” he added.Explaining how Naqvi was 'yorked' in the ACC meeting by BCCI representatives, the source said, “Naqvi was under the impression that being the ACC president, only he could present the trophy on the stage. However, the BCCI representatives told him that there was no such mandate. They cited that in 2022, it was Sri Lanka Cricket president Shammi Silva who presented the trophy to the then Asia Cup champions Sri Lanka, and not Jay Shah , who was then the ACC chairman. He was also told that BCCI was firm in its stance that Surya would not take the trophy from Naqvi, especially in light of his anti-India social media posts recently.”The source added: “No country attending the AGM supported Naqvi's act. In fact, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka supported India’s stance.”",Mohsin Naqvi took away the Asia Cup trophy and medals with him on Sunday night in Dubai after India beat Pakistan in the final by five wickets.

Poll Should Mohsin Naqvi step down from one of his roles? Yes, he should focus on one role. No, he can manage both roles.

NEW DELHI: Mohsin Naqvi, at the center of controversy after walking off with the Asia Cup trophy and refusing to hand it over to the winning Indian team, has reportedly been asked to choose between two of his roles—Chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) or Interior Minister. Critics feel he has struggled to manage both responsibilities effectively.According to reports, former all-rounder Shahid Afridi has urged Naqvi to relinquish one of his positions following the Asia Cup debacle on Sunday. To complicate matters, Naqvi also serves as President of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC).Pakistan finished as runners-up in the regional tournament, but the team’s repeated losses to India in the Asia Cup have sparked criticism of both the side’s batting performance and the PCB’s leadership.Naqvi’s handling of the board is now under intense scrutiny, Telecom Asia Sport reported on Tuesday.“My request or advice to Naqvi Saheb is that you have two very important posts, and they are big jobs and need time,” Afridi said.“PCB is totally different from the Interior Ministry, so they must be kept separate.”Afridi added that a decision should be taken without delay.“It would be a big decision and should be taken as soon as possible.Pakistan cricket needs special attention and time,” he told telecomasia.He also criticised Naqvi’s advisers.“Naqvi cannot rely totally on advisers. These advisers are taking him nowhere, and he himself admits he doesn’t know much about cricket,” Afridi said.Afridi stressed the need for competent cricket advisers. “He needs to appoint good and knowledgeable advisers who understand the game,” he said.The report noted that Afridi has been vocal about Naqvi holding dual posts, but his warnings have largely gone unheeded. Sources added that Afridi even suggested to the country’s army chief that Naqvi should step down from one position to focus properly on the other.Mohsin Naqvi insisted on handling the trophy presentation himself. When India refused to accept it from him, he ordered the Asia Cup trophy and medals to be removed from the stadium and left the venue, leaving the Indian team and supporters waiting before they celebrated on their own terms.After the Asia Cup final, Mohsin Naqvi, ignoring protocol and common sense, insisted on presenting the trophy himself.

NEW DELHI: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has reportedly suspended all No Objection Certificates (NOCs) for players planning to participate in foreign T20 leagues following the national team’s defeat to India in the Asia Cup 2025 final.Pakistan suffered a five-wicket loss to India on Sunday at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, as the Suryakumar Yadav-led side secured India’s ninth Asia Cup title.On September 29, Sumair Ahmad Syed, the PCB’s Chief Operating Officer, issued a notice to players and agents regarding the suspension of NOCs.This decision directly impacts key players such as Babar Azam, Shaheen Afridi, Faheem Ashraf, and Mohammad Rizwan, who are among seven Pakistani cricketers scheduled to play in Australia’s Big Bash League (BBL).In addition, 16 Pakistani players, including Naseem Shah, Saim Ayub, and Fakhar Zaman, are registered for the International League T20 (ILT20) auction, set to begin on October 1 in the UAE.The board has indicated that the move is intended to encourage players to focus on domestic tournaments, particularly the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, Pakistan’s premier first-class competition, which is set to start in October. However, there is no clarity on when the current NOC suspension might be lifted or how long the evaluation process will take.Pakistan endured three consecutive defeats against India in the Asia Cup, including a seven-wicket loss in the group stage, a six-wicket defeat in the Super Fours, and the five-wicket loss in the final.The post-final presentation ceremony descended into chaos when Indian players refused to accept the winner’s trophy from Mohsin Naqvi, who also serves as chairman of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC).As Naqvi waited on one side of the stage, the Indian team remained about 15 yards away, refusing to move. The delay continued for several minutes, and when Naqvi finally stepped onto the stage, Indian fans booed loudly, chanting “Bharat Mata Ki Jai.” Officials then informed Naqvi that the Indian players would not accept the trophy from him.With the trophy unclaimed, the presentation concluded without the formal handover. Naqvi eventually left the dais still holding the trophy and winners’ medals.

New Delhi:

Shubman Gill's exquisite drives, lofted shots and innovative reverse sweeps in the nets

A month before the official announcement, Shubman Gill was told that he was going to be India’s next Test captain.In a meeting with coach Gautam Gambhir , chief selector Ajit Agarkar, and a top cricket administrator, he was informed that he would lead India in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.The 25-year-old couldn’t believe it when the news was broken to him. For a cricketer obsessed with batting, Test captaincy wasn’t something he was expecting, but the men who matter asked him to ""dream big"" and start preparing for the England tour.Gill knew wearing the captain’s band wasn’t going to be enough — he needed to score runs in Tests. His elevation to captaincy created a stir, with many questioning his place in the XI itself.Right before the start of the IPL, he asked Avinash Kumar, his childhood friend who was with Gujarat Titans as a side-arm thrower, to carry red Dukes balls with him.Avinash was given strict instructions to pitch it full onto the stumps. Gill struggled initially because he was tweaking his technique.Gill had one recurring problem — a slow weight transfer onto the front foot, which created a gap between bat and pad. He had paid for that in the past, even in Indian conditions.It was fascinating how such a small flaw had remained uncorrected for years.There was an air of rigidity because he had scored all his runs with the same technique, and dominated oppositions too. A sense of batting ego had crept in and the flaw remained unattended. But he was aware that something different was required for the tough assignment in England, and a 12-hour-long session followed.Data was the key talking point, and a ten-year sheet was presented to Gill by the people who work closely with him. The result was straightforward — 80% of the runs scored in England during that period were behind square. With a technique where the bat mostly faced towards covers while defending, some immediate tweaks were required.Gill agreed but remained unsure about making drastic changes before his first series as captain. Afraid of failure, he asked those close to him: ""What if I fail?"" The instant reply from his father Lakhwinder Gill was: ""What if you pass and smash all records?""The IPL began, but Gill’s confusion persisted. That’s when three calls were arranged — to Steven Smith , Kane Williamson , and Sachin Tendulkar .All three highlighted his technical issue.Smith spoke mainly on the mental side of batting in England. He guided him about the lengths England pacers would attack and asked him to do shadow practice to create muscle memory before working on technique in the nets.Williamson’s advice was to play close to the body, with gentle hands, and not to chase drives. He told him concentration is key in England — give 45 minutes to the bowlers, and then it’s a feast.Before the call with Sachin Tendulkar, Gill was tense and shivering. The legend noticed it immediately.It is reliably learnt that the Master Blaster calmed him down, cracked a couple of jokes, and shared his experience in England. In the last 15 minutes, he gave a demo of where the bowlers would target him. He explained why a small tweak — making sure the bat faced mid-off — would reduce the gap and turn inside edges, which usually hit the stumps, towards square leg.Those words echoed in Gill’s mind. ""Sachin sir bol rahe hain toh galat kaise ho sakta hai (If Sachin Tendulkar is saying it, then something is seriously wrong in my technique — he can’t be wrong),"" he said to people in his very close circles.The hard work began in the IPL nets.In his first press conference in England as captain, Gill looked unfazed and surprised everyone when he declared: ""When I want to go out there and bat, I want to play as a batter and not think about the captaincy, which can put pressure on me. I want to be the best batter in the series.""And he walked the talk, finishing the series with 754 runs.Gill’s 754 runs shattered the previous record of 752 set by Graham Gooch in 1990, the most ever by a batsman in a Test series between India and England.He surpassed Sunil Gavaskar’s 732 runs as captain against West Indies in 1978-79, a record unchallenged for 47 years. Gill not only overtook it but also came within touching distance of Sir Don Bradman’s iconic 810-run mark for a captain in a series.Shubman also broke Virat Kohli ’s record, becoming the first Asian batter to cross 700 runs in a series in SENA countries. His tally of 754 outstripped Kohli’s 692 runs from the 2014-15 Border-Gavaskar Trophy.To achieve all this, Gill had to battle ego, fix technical flaws — and listen to a stern warning from the God himself.After the highs of the Asia Cup, India’s captain will don the blazer for the first time on home soil on October 2, when his team faces West Indies at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.It will be a new challenge for Gill, but now he knows how to shed his ego — and he’s ready to script the next chapter in his career.","Gill's elevation to captaincy created a stir, with many questioning his place in the XI itself.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi came under intense criticism and ridicule on social media after Pakistan’s third straight defeat to India in the Asia Cup, with calls mounting for his immediate removal. Pakistan lost to India in Sunday’s final, and the post-match presentation descended into chaos when the Indian players refused to accept the winner’s trophy from Naqvi, who also serves as the chairman of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC).As Naqvi waited on one side of the stage for the ceremony to begin, the Indian team stood about 15 yards away, refusing to move. The delay continued for several minutes, and when Naqvi eventually stepped onto the stage, Indian fans inside the stadium booed loudly, chanting “Bharat Mata Ki Jai.” Officials then informed Naqvi that the Indian team would not accept the trophy from him.With the Indian players refusing to take the trophy, the ceremony concluded without the presentation. Naqvi left the dais with the trophy and winners’ medals still in his possession. The Indian team later celebrated by pretending to hold an invisible trophy, while Suryakumar Yadav announced in the post-match press conference that he would donate his Asia Cup match fees to the Indian armed forces.""This ‘selected’ Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, if he has any guts, should take notice against Mohsin Naqvi, who has destroyed Pakistan cricket in such a short time,"" senior Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leader Moonis Elahi wrote on X. “This shameless man feels no remorse, but those who installed him should reflect. He must be removed immediately.""Former Sindh governor Mohammad Zubair also criticized Naqvi, alleging that he dropped Pakistan’s top players, contributing to the team’s three consecutive defeats against India. ""Pakistan’s best batsman Babar Azam was dropped by this man. He also dropped Pakistan's best wicketkeeper batsman Rizwan, selecting instead players like Salman Agha and Harris. He destroyed our batting,"" Zubair said.Jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan drew a political comparison, stating: “What Mohsin Naqvi is doing to cricket is exactly what Army Chief Gen Asim Munir is doing to Pakistan.”Other critics accused Naqvi of sidelining genuine talent. ""He held a grudge against Amir Jamal for his #804 gesture (Imran Khan’s jail cell number) and sidelined him permanently. What a pity,” activist Sana tweeted.Journalist Umar Draz Gondal said whether the Indian captain refused to shake hands or take the trophy from Naqvi, “the only answer is to defeat India in the stadium and shut their mouths.” He added: ""Cricket in Pakistan has already declined, just like hockey. Why? Because Naqvi was appointed through a slip from the ‘big boss’ and became chairman only because he is their blue-eyed. No one can hold him accountable.""",Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi came under intense criticism and ridicule on social media after Pakistan’s third straight defeat to India in the Asia Cup.

Poll Do you think Tilak Varma's performance was crucial in winning the Asia Cup? Yes No

NEW DELHI: Winning the Asia Cup was the ""best reply"" to an aggressive opposition, middle-order batter Tilak Varma said on Tuesday, revealing how he handled initial pressure and verbal volleys from Pakistan players en route to his match-winning half-century in the final. Tilak scored an unbeaten 69 to guide India to a five-wicket victory over their arch-rivals at Dubai last Sunday.""There was some pressure and nerves initially. But I have placed my country ahead of everything else and I wanted to win the match for the country. I knew if I succumbed to the pressure at that time I would be letting down myself and 140 crore people of the country,"" Tilak said after arriving from Dubai.""I believed in the basics that I learned as a young cricketer from my coaches and executed it. The best reply to them was to win the match and that's what we did,"" he added.Tilak admitted that the Pakistan players indulged in intense sledging during the match, but he chose to remain silent while chasing 147.""After Operation Sindoor, they came hard on us. We have replied in a good way to them by playing sports the way it should be played. We lost three wickets quickly and things were a bit heated up then.""I came to bat a bit earlier than normal. But I did not say anything or play a rash shot, as it would have let the team and country down then,"" he said.However, the Hyderabadi revealed that he spoke his mind to the Pakistan players only after India surpassed the target.""During the match, I was just focusing on my basics, I was not ready to answer them. Whatever I want to tell them I told them after the match and not when the game was going on.""There were a lot of things happening in the middle but I can't reveal all of them. Those things happen in India vs Pakistan matches and they are part of the game. But our focus was on winning the match,"" he said.India needed 10 runs off the final over bowled by pacer Haris Rauf, and Tilak said he was able to stay calm under pressure.""I was calm under pressure (in the last over). I knew that I will win the game. I was just thinking about my country and was focussing on one ball at a time. I backed myself to deliver for the country and I am so proud of it,"" he added.Unsurprisingly, Tilak described the innings as one of the best of his young career.""I would rate this as one of the best innings. (Along) with this, I could also rate one more innings which I played earlier in Chennai against England (an unbeaten 72 that steered India to a two-wicket win).""Of course, playing in the Asia Cup, that too against Pakistan under pressure, is one of the greatest feelings. So, I would rate this as my one of the best innings compared to my two hundreds. This is the best feeling ever I experienced,"" he gushed.Tilak credited India’s win to partnerships on a tricky batting pitch.""I agree with Surya bhai's statement of 'no rivalry' but this is sports and we knew that they will come prepared for the final.""We were expecting that and we were prepared when they took the pace off the ball and the pitch was also not easy to bat on. We made some good partnerships and won the match and are proud of that,” he noted.After managing a tense chase successfully, Tilak was compared to Virat Kohli, the original 'chase master', but the 22-year-old remained grounded.""It is always a matter of pride when you get spoken in the same breath as a legend like Virat bhai. But my focus is just winning the matches for the country,"" he said.Tilak now has his sights set on next year's T20 World Cup at home.""I am happy that I could make India win the Asia Cup. I started playing cricket after the 2011 World Cup. The (T20) World Cup is going to take place soon. That is my real aim. I will get sleep only after I win the World Cup,"" he added.He also expressed gratitude to his childhood coaches who shaped his early career.""Everyone knows my name now, everyone knows who Tilak Varma is. But when nobody knew me, my coaches were with me, backed me big time, and have helped me build and shape my career since I was a child.""Ups and downs are a part of the game. I started at Legala Cricket Academy, and whenever I practice here, I gain confidence. I know if I'm on this soil, I'll get confidence.""My coaches, Salam (Bayash) sir and Prithvi sir, are everything to me, and they've done a lot for me. Special thanks to the Hyderabad Cricket Association and the BCCI for giving me this opportunity,"" he signed off.After the Asia Cup final, Mohsin Naqvi, ignoring protocol and common sense, insisted on presenting the trophy himself.

‘They complement each other perfectly,’ Suryakumar Kumar on Abhishek Sharma-Shubman Gill stand vs Pakistan

Former Indian cricket captain Kris Srikkanth has expressed serious concerns about current T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav 's batting performance following India's Asia Cup victory. Despite leading India to triumph in the continental tournament, Suryakumar's batting form has been a significant issue, scoring only 72 runs throughout the competition and facing criticism for his consistent low scores.Suryakumar Yadav's recent batting statistics paint a concerning picture. In 2025, as India's T20I captain, he has managed only 100 runs in 11 innings, maintaining an average just above nine. His overall performance as captain shows 330 runs in 20 innings, highlighting an extended period of batting struggles.The Asia Cup tournament particularly highlighted these concerns, with Suryakumar recording a series of low scores - 0, 5, 12, and 1 in his last four matches. In the final match, chasing a target of 147 runs, he was dismissed for just 1 run, putting additional pressure on the team.""Suryakumar Yadav let me down. His scores are like a pin code these days. Both batting lineups had several pin codes, with Pakistan being much worse, of course. But yes, Surya's form is very concerning, along with Shubman Gill ,"" Srikkanth said on his YouTube channel.Srikkanth's critique extended to vice-captain Shubman Gill's performance in the T20 format as well.""Shubman Gill doesn't look very deadly in the T20 format. He is fantastic in Tests and ODIs. Though they made him the vice-captain, with the World Cup coming up, we have to see what they do with him. He wasn't even in my team during the initial selection. But they made him the vice-captain as well,"" he added.The 1983 World Cup winner's concerns go beyond individual performances, extending to the overall team composition for the upcoming T20 World Cup. His assessment suggests that while the current lineup might suffice against lesser opposition, it could face significant challenges against stronger teams.""This team is not the right one for the T20 World Cup. It was enough for the below average sides in this tournament. But if we play with this team in the T20 World Cup, it'll be curtains for us,"" said Srikkanth.The statistics from the Asia Cup underline these concerns. Suryakumar's highest score in the tournament came against Pakistan in the group stage, where he managed 47 runs. This was his only innings crossing the 20-run mark throughout the competition.The criticism comes at a crucial time as India prepares for future international competitions.

Abhishek Sharma trolls Shaheen Afridi, smashes Pakistan bowlers and dominates

Poll Do you support Suryakumar Yadav's gesture of donating his match fees to the Indian Army? Yes, absolutely! No, it's controversial.

India clinched their second T20 Asia Cup crown with a nail-biting five-wicket win over Pakistan in the 2025 final on Sunday, but the action on the field was only half the story. The post-match statements from both teams took as much spotlight as the cricket itself.Before the final, former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi and Muhammad Yunus had said the team would dedicate the Asia Cup trophy to the Pakistan Air Force if they managed to win. Afridi even revealed that he had personally reached out to players with this suggestion, hoping to inspire them for the big clash.However, it was India who walked away with the title. Chasing 147 after dismissing Pakistan for 146, Suryakumar Yadav’s side got home with two balls to spare. Tilak Varma stood tall with a composed unbeaten 69, supported by Shivam Dube’s 33, ensuring India sealed the contest.This was India’s third win over Pakistan in the tournament, having already beaten them in the league stage and the Super Fours.In the post-match press conference however, it was India captain Suryakumar Yadav that donated his match fees to the Indian Army. “As a gesture, I want to donate my match fees from all the games in this tournament to the Indian Army.I don’t know if people will call it controversial, but for me, it’s the right thing to do,” he said, before exiting.Also read: 'Senseless Pakistan' – Shoaib Akhtar’s emotional outburst after Asia Cup final defeat Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha followed suit in his own way. “We as a team, are donating our match fees to all the civilians who lost their lives during the Indian attack and to our kids who were affected by it.

Injuries pile up as Ravens’ season begins to resemble past disappointments



Is it too early to bury Baltimore’s playoff chances?



The Baltimore Ravens find themselves in turmoil after a 1–3 start that has shaken confidence in their Super Bowl chances. A lopsided defeat to the Kansas City Chiefs and concerns over Lamar Jackson ’s health have only added to the pressure. With injuries mounting and expectations unmet, questions now surround whether Baltimore can recover before it’s too late.The Baltimore Ravens’ season has barely begun, but some analysts are already ready to write them off. After a 1–3 start capped by a lopsided loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, ESPN’s Chris Canty delivered one of the strongest proclamations yet: “It’s a wrap for the Baltimore Ravens.”The biggest concern in Baltimore revolves around quarterback Lamar Jackson. The former MVP left the Chiefs game with an injury, and although head coach John Harbaugh suggested it likely isn’t season-ending, the uncertainty casts a long shadow. Without Jackson, the Ravens’ chances of competing at a high level are slim to none.Canty compared the situation to Baltimore’s 2015 campaign, a season derailed by injuries and unfulfilled expectations. He went so far as to call it a “travesty” that the team has yet to reach a Super Bowl with Jackson at his peak, pointing to the window of opportunity slowly closing.Beyond Jackson, injuries across the roster are stacking up, making it harder for the Ravens to establish consistency.Depth has always been a strength of Harbaugh’s teams, but against elite competition like Buffalo, Detroit, and Kansas City—their three losses so far—the cracks have shown.While Canty’s bold statement has gained traction, others argue it’s too soon to sound the alarm. The Ravens are only four games into the season, and their losses came against some of the league’s toughest opponents. With a softer schedule ahead, the possibility of treading water until Jackson is healthy could keep playoff hopes alive.If Baltimore can steady the ship, they still boast one of the NFL ’s most dangerous quarterbacks, a proven coaching staff, and a defense capable of matching up with anyone in January. Critics may doubt them now, but football seasons often hinge on timing and health.Also Read: “Woefully ignorant”: Travis Kelce and Andy Reid’s sideline behavior shocks fans after weeks of tension Canty’s words—“It’s a wrap for the Baltimore Ravens”—could age like a spot-on prediction or a viral misfire.

Auston Matthews takes playful jab at reporters



Auston Matthews aims for bounce-back season



The Toronto Maple Leafs are heading into their annual team bonding trip, a tradition that offers players a chance to relax, connect, and reset before the grind of a long NHL season. For captain Auston Matthews, it’s more than just a breather from camp—it’s also a lighthearted escape from Toronto’s famously relentless media.Matthews has never been shy about voicing his thoughts when it comes to media coverage. Earlier this offseason, he drew a firm line on questions regarding former teammate Mitch Marner, reminding reporters that at some point, he moves on. This week, before the Leafs left for their bonding trip, he teased the press again, joking that the break isn’t just about team chemistry, but also about enjoying some time away from reporters.It was a subtle reminder of the unique spotlight that comes with playing in Toronto, where every shift and statistic is dissected. For Matthews, that attention has often been a double-edged sword. Despite battling injuries last season and falling short of the 40-goal mark, he still remained a central figure in the lineup. Yet, his performance was framed by many as a “down year.”Healthy for the first time since his 69-goal campaign, Matthews enters this season with renewed energy and fresh motivation.His placement at 15th on the NHL Network’s Top 50 Players list—considered far too low by many fans—only adds fuel to his competitive fire. Critics have also questioned how he might perform without Marner on his line, but Matthews has shown time and again that he can adapt and still produce at an elite level.The Leafs, meanwhile, have assembled one of their deepest rosters in years. With added salary cap flexibility, management still has room to make further moves, setting the stage for what could be a defining season.As the bonding trip unfolds, Matthews’ light jab at the media captures his mindset perfectly: focused, relaxed, and ready to prove doubters wrong once the real games begin.Also Read: Max Pacioretty reportedly ends NHL career to start new chapter at University of Michigan","Auston Matthews jokes about Toronto media as Maple Leafs head for team bonding trip.

Ja’Marr Chase questions Cincinnati Bengals ’ desire and calls out lack of urgency after blowout loss



Zac Taylor defends Ja’Marr Chase’s passion while Jake Browning refuses to question team effort



The Cincinnati Bengals are collapsing, and wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase has had enough. Cincinnati was embarrassed 28-3 by the Denver Broncos on Monday night, dropping to 2-2 while still missing quarterback Joe Burrow . The offense totaled only 159 yards and failed to reach the end zone for the second week in a row.Chase, who finished with five catches for 23 yards, went viral for a heated sideline exchange with head coach Zac Taylor. After the loss, he posted on X, “Man yall better leave me alone man” with laughing emojis and added, “I play with passion.”Chase spoke directly about what went wrong in Denver. “Urgency is there, man, it’s just you gotta want it,” he told reporters. “At the end of the day, we gotta want it. Today, it didn’t look like we wanted it.”He admitted emotions took over while the Bengals’ offense stalled drive after drive. “It’s not good ever losing, so, gotta learn from it. Trying to overcome adversity. Get some wins, man. … Just gotta get better at getting first downs. … I’m always frustrated if I’m losing, you know what I’m saying. But it’s part of the game, man. Sometimes emotions take over. Sometimes it looks like what it’s not supposed to. But, yeah, it happens.Cincinnati punted on its final eight drives after an early field goal. The team recorded only 159 total yards, becoming the first since the 2009 Oakland Raiders to stay under 200 yards in three of its first four games. Eleven penalties for 65 yards stalled what little momentum the offense found.Head coach Zac Taylor backed his frustrated receiver and downplayed the sideline moment. “Ja’Marr Chase, coming off a game like this, is one of my favorite players to deal with quite frankly, because he’s just competitive. He wants to win, and it comes across as emotional, but that’s just a captain that works his tail off. … All he wants to do is win the game. All he wants to do is affect the game, and oftentimes he feels like if, ‘I have the ball in my hand, I can do that,’ and I don’t disagree with him. ”Backup quarterback Jake Browning, filling in for the injured Joe Burrow, refused to blame effort. “I don’t question anybody’s effort in the locker room,” Browning said after throwing for 125 yards. He acknowledged mistakes across the offense but stood by his teammates’ commitment.Cincinnati has now been outscored 76-13 in back-to-back weeks, its worst two-game stretch since 1968. Without Burrow, the Bengals look lost, and Chase’s public frustration shows how close the locker room might be to boiling over.","Cincinnati Bengals lost 28-3 to the Denver Broncos on Monday night.

Artem Lobov devastated by his injury

“I’m absolutely devastated,”

“This was the fight I wanted for a long time. Unfortunately, the doctors wouldn’t clear me.

My apologies to Zubaira and the fans—I hope PFL can make this matchup happen again.”

The fight failing to make it to the stage

Artem Lobov’s long road back to the cage just hit another setback. The veteran fighter has pulled out of his scheduled clash with Zubaira Tukhugov at this week’s PFL Champions Series. After a training accident left him with a nasty cut near his right eye, he had to withdraw.The promotion broke the news on Tuesday, confirming that Lobov won’t be competing on Friday’s card. Soon after, Lobov took to Instagram to explain what happened. According to him, a head clash during sparring opened up the gash, and doctors quickly ruled him out.Lobov wrote.For MMA fans, the bout wasn’t just another fight. Lobov and Tukhugov have been linked since 2018, when their teams were at the center of the infamous Conor McGregor–Khabib Nurmagomedov rivalry. That feud boiled over during UFC 223 fight week, when McGregor stormed a bus carrying Nurmagomedov after the Dagestani confronted Lobov.Later that year, Lobov was lined up to face Tukhugov at UFC Fight Night 138.But the fight never happened, Tukhugov was pulled from the card, replaced by Michael Johnson, and Lobov ended up losing by decision. He was released from the UFC shortly after, leaving the grudge unsettled.Also Read: Legal War Brews Between Conor McGregor and Artem Lobov Over Proper No. Twelve Fortune That history made this PFL booking in Dubai so intriguing.

Mats Zuccarello ’s injury timeline confirmed by Bill Guerin



Minnesota Wild need to rely on depth till Zuccarello returns

The new NHL season has not yet started, and the Minnesota Wild are already getting into a major hurdle. Veteran winger Mats Zuccarello became the focal point after news of his injury came just days before opening night. With fans expecting the Wild to make a push for the Western Conference, they now have to quickly adjust while one of their most trusted forwards goes through recovery.On the other hand, on Tuesday, Wild general manager Bill Guerin confirmed that forward Mats Zuccarello would miss at least seven to eight weeks due to a lower-body injury. Guerin had said earlier in September that something came up during training camp, but he was unsure whether surgery would be necessary.Head coach John Hynes also remarked that there was no timetable for Zuccarello's return, calling it a back-related setback. With the updated timeline put to use, this veteran is now considered to miss nearly 20 games and is unlikely to return before late November.Zuccarello, now 38, continues to represent one of Norway's significant NHL exports and a vital part of Minnesota's lineup. Last year, he counted 19 goals and 35 assists in 69 contests while adding three points in six playoff games.Their goal-scoring touch and setup ability will be a difficult talent to substitute in the short term.The regular season itself opens with a clash between the Wild and St. Louis Blues on October 9. However, Zuccarello's group will have to make do without him. The injury in the top six rotation leaves an inadequate number, and the rest of the team will have to step into bigger roles.One of those players is Liam Ohgren, Minnesota's 2022 first-round draft choice, who is likely to join Joel Eriksson Ek and Vladimir Tarasenko on the big line. Ohgren's excellent AHL season sets him up perfectly to take advantage of this chance.Also Read: Anaheim Ducks lock down star center Mason McTavish with blockbuster six-year deal Having Zuccarello injured is far from ideal for the Wild, especially on the eve of the season.

Rising pressures on Travis Kelce from multiple fronts

Why insiders and teammates fear a breaking point

The Kansas City Chiefs were expected to have a strong start this season, but it’s not looking great. Travis Kelce ’s frustration on the sidelines, a costly drop, and even a fine are grabbing more attention than his receptions. Plus, with the Eagles getting their revenge for the Super Bowl, the Chiefs find themselves at 0-2. With all the media focus and his personal life already in the spotlight, Kelce’s on-field issues bring up a major question. Has the pressure finally gotten to him?Kelce is dealing with some stress, particularly because of his engagement to Taylor Swift , which was announced on August 26, 2025, after he popped the question in a garden. An insider mentioned to Star magazine, released on September 23, 2025, that Kelce is ""juggling so much with his podcast, brands, endorsements, his acting aspirations, his new Kansas City restaurant — and now football season is in full swing.""The relationship increases the focus; the same insider pointed out, ""Things have gone up a level in terms of scrutiny as he plans out the rest of his life with Taylor."" Swift showed up for the games on September 14 and 28, cheering for Kelce even during the tough losses.Kelce's contract is set to end after 2025, and he's been dropping hints about retirement. In a recent game, his snap count fell to 66%, the lowest it's been in more than two years, as the team tries to manage his workload at 35 years old.On the September 22, 2025 episode of the New Heights podcast, family pressure came up when Jason Kelce mentioned that their mom, Donna, is ""putting pressure"" on Travis to start a family with Swift. Donna shared with ExtraTV that she's really looking forward to having grandkids.An insider told the National Enquirer, ""Travis is losing it and people around him are worried because of everything he has going on right now."" They added, ""There’s more of an edge to him now and his temper is getting the best of him.""Travis Kelce feels ""claustrophobic"" due to the nonstop media attention, ""Before he can get off the field, he’s getting bombarded by the media asking him questions and trying to nose into his relationship with Taylor, plus he’s being overloaded with pressing emails and business queries.""Perez Hilton reported on September 25, 2025, similar fears: ""The fear is he’s going to buckle under the pressure."" Insiders attribute this to ""overreaching ambition,"" but note ""the guy is cracking up.""Travis Kelce has a lot on his plate, and it's starting to become apparent.

Auston Matthews gets slammed by former NHL player Sean Avery



Auston Matthews’ performance on the ice was highly criticised in the last season



The Toronto Maple Leafs’ captain and one of the most popular players in the league, Auston Matthews, had a rough season last time as he was dealing with his injuries. The Leafs’ captain ended up appearing in only 67 games last season and the team recorded a pretty poor performance on the ice. While things were looking hopeful for Auston Matthews initially in the new season, the Toronto Maple Leafs have already lost two of the four preseason matches held in the last few days, and now, this has raised eyebrows about the star player’s performance.A few hours ago, former NHL player Sean Avery made a few controversial remarks about the Toronto Maple Leafs’ captain.Former NHL player Sean Avery made an appearance on the Spittin’ Chicklets podcast, where he slammed Auston Matthews.He said, ""Auston Matthews, if there's a guy right now in the league that I say that might not have the next gear to win, he might be at the top of my list…Elias Patterson might be second.""While Auston Matthews has not reacted to Sean Avery’s comments on his performance yet, the Toronto Maple Leafs GM, Brad Treliving, had praised him a few days back.The Toronto Maple Leafs GM, Brad Treliving, made an appearance on Sportsnet's The Real Kyper & Bourne, where he spoke about Auston Matthews' return to the ice this season.The Toronto Maple Leafs GM, Brad Treliving, said, “To me, it starts with his preparation. He was back here early in the summer. It is amazing; when he shows up, it seems like everyone else is here now, too. He was here probably a month before we got going, and with the preparation he puts toward his craft and the way he practices, he sets the standard.”Auston Matthews spent the whole of last season trying to recover from his injuries and could only participate in 67 games total. This had sparked concern among fans as many criticised his focus and performance on the ice.While Auston Matthews looks pretty fit in the new season, the recent losses in the preseason has sparked some concern and panic among fans.Also Read: ""He's in a position of power"": Chris Pronger and Luke Gazdic react to Connor McDavid’s uncertain future with the Edmonton Oilers",Former NHL player Sean Avery slammed Auston Matthews on the Spittin’ Chicklets podcast.

Who Is Saeed Ezatolahi?

Saeed Ezatolahi’s journey from defensive anchor to game changer

Tactical implications and reactions to Saeed Ezatolahi’s strike

In an exciting AFC Champions League Group B clash, Shabab Al-Ahli gave hosts Al Ittihad a jolt with a piece of magic from Iranian midfielder Saeed Ezatolahi. He scored the stunner in the 40th minute. However, the goal slightly changed the dynamics of the tie as the visitors gained both the lead and momentum early on in the contest.Largely a defensive or deep-lying midfielder, Saeed Ezatolahi rarely has game-breaking attacking moments. At this point, his core competencies are in breaking up play, shielding the back line, and recycling possession. At 1.90 m, he has made a name for himself as a steady fixture in the center.He has also had an interesting journey during this time. He is a product of the Malavan youth system, broke into the senior side as a teenager in Iran’s top flight, then played overseas in Russia and Europe, and now the UAE Pro League. He was once Iran's youngest-ever scorer at an international level after he scored in a World Cup qualifier in 2015.The focus today is probably his highest-profile contribution, neither simply for its aesthetic nor its chronology, but its timing and effect.Interestingly, a player like him can produce in the final third, which perhaps raises the possibility of a shift in his role in later tournament matches to maximize attacking output.Also Read: Houssem Aouar Net Worth in 2025: How Much Is the Al Ittihad Star Midfielder Worth The goal by Ezatolahi changed how both sides approached the remainder of the match; such was the impact of the Iranian midfielders finding the back of the net. Al Ittihad is a club brimming with both star quality and offensive expectation, so to concede to a defensive midfielder not only hit hard psychologically but also ushered in a wave of even greater aggression and potentially unfulfilled areas of defence.In contrast, Shabab Al-Ahli would be more inclined to adopt a slower approach, taking the sting out of the game and slowing down the tempo to frustrate their hosts with possession and game control.Pundits and fans have immediately begun buzzing, many talking about how a player who has built his reputation on defensive discipline turned a key match fixture on its head. Within hours of the goal, social media was praising the finish, and analysts began discussing whether his coaches might try using Ezatolahi in slightly more advanced positions.",Shabab Al-Ahli beat Al Ittihad 1-0 in the AFC Champions League Group B clash. Midfielder Saeed Ezatolahi scored the only goal of the game in the 40th minute. The goal slightly changed the dynamics of the tie as the visitors gained both the lead and momentum early on.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124243309,imgsize-787833,width-400,resizemode-4/saeed-ezatolahi.jpg"

Poll Who do you think will play a key role for the West Indies in the upcoming Test series against India? Jomel Warrican Khary Pierre Darren Sammy West Indies Batters

One step, rock back, bowl. One step, rock back, bowl. It was a routine that Jomel Warrican kept doing for about 35 minutes in the nets at the Narendra Modi Stadium here on Tuesday as the West Indies prepared for the first of the two-match Test series vs India, starting Thursday. “It was basically to service my action so that I can get more body into it and help me get more revs on the ball,” he explained.The 33-year-old left-arm spinner knows he will have a massive role to play if the West Indies are to compete. But he will take heart from seeing the names of bowlers that succeeded in India last year: Mitchell Santner and Ajaz Patel, both getting 10-wicket hauls in Pune and Mumbai respectively to bowl New Zealand to memorable wins.Left-arm finger spin, especially fastish left-arm finger spin, has historically troubled India even in home conditions. The red-soil pitch on display for the first Test could be his friend if he bowls accurately. Warrican could also have spin-twin Khary Pierre bowl with him if the first-class veteran, known to be metronomical and quick, gets to wear the legendary maroon cap, bearing the number 341 for the first time.Warrican can pass on to Pierre any information that he gathered from his sojourn to these shores in 2018. “Day Three and Four, the ball starts turning a lot. First innings runs are going to be vital,” he states.For those runs, coach Darren Sammy has put his wards through a six-day camp. The Windies arrived in Ahmedabad on Sept 24. “We had two allday sessions after coming here. Batters practised a lot of sweeps, defensive strokes, pulling off the back foot, and lofted strokes,” Warrican revealed.Warrican, 33, has played only 21 Tests in a 10-year career so far and has taken 73 wickets with two five-fors. Both came in Multan, in Jan vs Pakistan . A sensational spell of 7-32 did not result in victory for the West Indies. In the next Test, though, he took 4/43 and 5/27 and also scored 36 not out to bowl West Indies to a rare away win.If the red-soil pitch in Ahmedabad plays true to character like most redsoil pitches in India, expect additions to the tally of five-fors.",West Indies face India in the first Test in Ahmedabad on Thursday. Left-arm spinner Jomel Warrican has taken 73 wickets with two five-fors. The 33-year-old has played only 21 Tests in a 10-year career.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124247713,imgsize-42628,width-400,resizemode-4/jomel-warrican.jpg"
